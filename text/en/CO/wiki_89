<text>Twin Peaks, Washington is a fictional town that serves as the primary setting of the television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, created by Mark Frost and David Lynch, and the associated films &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot; (1992) and &quot;Twin Peaks: The Missing Pieces&quot; (shot 1991, released 2014). Although the series states that the town is &quot;five miles south of the Canadian border, and twelve miles west of the Washington-Idaho] state line&quot; (i.e., within the Salmo-Priest Wilderness), most of the show&#x27;s stock exterior footage was shot in the neighboring Washington towns of Snoqualmie, North Bend, and Fall City, around 25-30 miles from Seattle.

Lynch and Frost started their location search in Snoqualmie on the recommendation of a friend of Frost. In the area, they found all of the locations that they had written into the pilot episode. Common locations within the series originally filmed in the Snoqualmie area include the characters&#x27; various homes, the Sheriff&#x27;s Department, the Double R Diner, The Great Northern Hotel, Big Ed&#x27;s Gas Farm, and Twin Peaks High School. In addition, two supernatural locations are accessible through portals in the forests surrounding Twin Peaks: The Black Lodge and The White Lodge.

Although the pilot, &quot;Fire Walk with Me&quot;, &quot;The Missing Pieces&quot;, and many scenes in season 3 of the television series (2017) were shot on location in Washington state, for convenience, much of the filming for seasons 1 and 2 took place in the Los Angeles area. Many exterior scenes were filmed in wooded areas of Malibu, California, and most of the interior scenes were shot on standing sets in a San Fernando Valley warehouse.

==Double R Diner==
In the series, the Double R Diner is owned and managed by Norma Jennings (Peggy Lipton). Norma employs two waitresses: Shelly Johnson (Mädchen Amick) and Heidi (Andrea Hays).

In the pilot, the Mar-T Cafe (North Bend, Washington) stood in for the Double R Diner. The producers then built a Hollywood soundstage set modeled on the Mar-T Cafe for the remaining interior scenes in seasons one and two.

After the series was cancelled, the cafe was sold to Kyle Twede ( ), who renamed it Twede&#x27;s Cafe. In 2000, arsonists set a fire that gutted the cafe; contemporary reports said that the arsonists were burglars trying to cover up their theft of $450. In an interview from May 2015, Kyle Twede described the arsonists as kids who had broken into the cafe to mess around and drink wine coolers and, fearing they would get in trouble, chose to set the place on fire. The interior was destroyed, while the exterior neon sign and the structure remained.

Twede&#x27;s Cafe reopened in 2001 with a new interior that discarded many features of the original Double R Diner. However, in advance of season three (which was filmed on location), the producers paid to restore the cafe to its original appearance.

==The Great Northern Hotel==
In seasons one and two, lead character Dale Cooper flies in from Philadelphia and rents a room in The Great Northern Hotel. The hotel is owned by Ben Horne, a businessman who also owns the local department store and maintains his offices at the Great Northern. In the first two seasons, much of Ben&#x27;s time is devoted to building Ghostwood, a new country club and residential estate that is intended to replace the Packard Sawmill. Ben&#x27;s attorney Leland Palmer assists him with the Ghostwood project; the death of Leland&#x27;s daughter Laura Palmer is the catalyst for the series.

The exterior of The Great Northern Hotel is the Salish Lodge in Snoqualmie, WA. However, the hotel was originally inspired by the Kiana Lodge in Poulsbo, Washington. The Kiana Lodge was built in the late 1920s and is furnished with alder bentwood pieces dating from that era.

==Black and White Lodges==

The Black Lodge is an extradimensional place that seems to include, primarily, the &quot;Red Room&quot; first seen by Agent Cooper in a dream early in the series. As events in the series unfold, it becomes apparent that the characters from the Red Room, the Black Lodge, and the White Lodge, are connected.

At first, it is revealed that there is a mysterious dark presence in the woods that the town&#x27;s Bookhouse Boys have been combatting for generations. Although they do not know what it is, Native American policeman Deputy Hawk says that the Black Lodge is from the mythology of his people, describing it as:

The shadow-self of the White Lodge. The legend says that every spirit must pass through there on the way to perfection. There, you will meet your own shadow self. My people call it &#x27;the Dweller on the Threshold&#x27; ... But it is said, if you confront the Black Lodge with imperfect courage, it will utterly annihilate your soul.
During the second season, Windom Earle relates a story about the White Lodge:

Once upon a time, there was a place of great goodness, called the White Lodge. Gentle fawns gamboled there amidst happy, laughing spirits. The sounds of innocence and joy filled the air. And when it rained, it rained sweet nectar that infused one&#x27;s heart with a desire to live life in truth and beauty. Generally speaking, a ghastly place, reeking of virtue&#x27;s sour smell. Engorged with the whispered prayers of kneeling mothers, mewling newborns, and fools, young and old, compelled to do good without reason ... But, I am happy to point out that our story does not end in this wretched place of saccharine excess. For there&#x27;s another place, its opposite: a place of almost unimaginable power, chock full of dark forces and vicious secrets. No prayers dare enter this frightful maw. The spirits there care not for good deeds or priestly invocations, they&#x27;re as likely to rip the flesh from your bone as greet you with a happy &quot;good day&quot;. And if harnessed, these spirits in this hidden land of unmuffled screams and broken hearts would offer up a power so vast that its bearer might reorder the Earth itself to his liking.
As the Black and White Lodges become more prominent in the story, Major Briggs claims that during one or more of his disappearances, he had visited the White Lodge and goes on to offer advice regarding it.

===Location===
Although the Red Room began exclusively as a location within Agent Dale Cooper&#x27;s dreams, the inhabitants began appearing in other locations in the town, inciting other elements in the plot, to the point where the Red Room and White/Black Lodge stories became one. After discovering a mysterious map in Owl Cave, it becomes evident to Earle and Cooper—both independently and with different motivations for wanting to visit it—that the entrance to the Black Lodge is located in Ghostwood Forest which surrounds the town of Twin Peaks, at a pool of a substance that smells like scorched engine oil and surrounded by 12 young sycamore trees. This area is known as Glastonbury Grove.

It is said that the key to gain entrance to the Black Lodge is fear—usually an act of brutal murder. This is in contrast to the key to the White Lodge, which is love. Another requirement to enter the Black Lodge through the entrance in Glastonbury Grove is that it may only be entered &quot;...when Jupiter and Saturn meet...&quot; When the above requirements are met and one approaches the pool in Glastonbury Grove, red curtains appear, which the person walks between before the curtains vanish once again.

===Interior===

There is little furniture in the Red Room aside from a few armchairs, a wheeled table and a couple of floor lamps. There is also a replica of the Venus de Medici (often mistaken for the &quot;Venus de Milo&quot;; the &quot;Venus de Milo&quot; can be seen in the hallway). There are no doors to speak of; movement from room to room is accomplished by crossing through another set of red curtains that lead to a narrow hallway. The floor is a chevron pattern of brown and white, and all sides of any room and all walls of any hallway encountered are covered by identical red curtains. In the final episode, a second room in the Lodge is seen, identical to the first. Between the two rooms is a narrow corridor which has the same floor and &quot;walls&quot; as the other two rooms.

Although the Lodge inhabitants speak English, their voices are warped and strangely clipped and their movements are unnatural (this effect is accomplished by the actors speaking in reverse and the footage is then played backwards). Residents often speak in riddles and non-sequiturs. The main inhabitants of the Lodge are The Man from Another Place, The Giant and Killer Bob.

In the final episode of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, Cooper meets The Man from Another Place, who refers to the Red Room as the &quot;waiting room&quot;. This echoes Hawk&#x27;s claim that every spirit must pass through the Black Lodge on the way to perfection and that the Red Room leads to the White Lodge as well.

The red curtains, zig-zag floors and bright spotlights of the White and Black Lodges have also appeared in several of David Lynch&#x27;s other films, suggesting that Lynch may view their influences as ongoing in his narrative worlds. As the Masonic historian archeologist David Harrison notes in his article on &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, the floor resembles a zig-zag version of the &quot;Mosaic Pavement&quot; in a Masonic lodge, hence the names &quot;Black Lodge&quot; and &quot;White Lodge&quot;, which consists of squares in the middle, but of triangles at the borders. As the focus of the series is on how to pass through from one surreal realm into the other, or how to transcend from one level of fear of this metaphysical realm to the one associated with love and that both are a way to come to a cumulative, final interpretation on the matter of reality itself, reachable from &quot;both sides of the medal&quot;, the condensation and reduction of the symbolism to a zig-zag floor makes sense in context of the series&#x27; themes.

===Inhabitants===
The Black Lodge and White Lodge are home to many spirits and people alike, including Bob, Mike, the Man from Another Place, the Giant, Laura Palmer (passing through the Red Room before ascending to the White Lodge), and Dale Cooper.

The spirits can possess humans if they are let in: Bob possesses Leland Palmer but not Laura, who refuses to let him in. Later, Bob possesses Dale Cooper&#x27;s doppelganger (not Cooper himself); The Giant and an elderly waiter from the Great Northern Hotel were &quot;one and the same&quot;. Mike and The Man From Another Place (Mike&#x27;s arm) possess Phillip Gerard.

===References in popular culture===
In the two-part &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode, &quot;Who Shot Mr. Burns?&quot;, Chief Clancy Wiggum has trouble solving the case and falls into a dream sequence in which he sits in the Red Room with Lisa Simpson, who speaks backwards. She gives him clues in reverse-speak, but Wiggum is unable to understand her until she gives up in frustration and speaks normally. As with &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, while recording Lisa&#x27;s lines for the segment, Yeardley Smith recorded the part backwards and it was reversed. Several other parts in the segment are direct references to &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, including a moving shadow on the curtain, and Wiggum&#x27;s hair standing straight up after waking.

In the manga series &quot;Soul Eater&quot;, the Red Room is used as a motif when Soul Eater and Maka Albarn are infected with Black Blood. A demon who dances backward (similar to The Man from Another Place) to a skipping jazz record attempts to convince them to give in to the Black Blood&#x27;s madness.

The Red Room is also parodied as &quot;The Sitting Room&quot; in multiple episodes of &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated&quot;, first accessed by Scooby-Doo in a dream and later accessed by all of Mystery, Inc. under mass hypnosis. A helper figure similar to The Man from Another Place appears there, and, like the original Man, is played by Michael J. Anderson. The Sitting Room appears to be a spirit realm where both helpful and malicious entities can dwell, as well as pieces of the souls of those tainted by the Treasure of Crystal Cove.

A parody of the Red Room is featured as &quot;The Club&quot; in &quot;Gravity Falls&quot;, Season 1, Episode 4 &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Mabel&quot;.

In an interview, Atlus co-founder Kazuma Kaneko confirmed that the Black Lodge was the main source of inspiration for the Velvet Room&#x27;s design in the &quot;Persona&quot; video game series, though the color of the room was altered to blue in reference to David Lynch&#x27;s film &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;.

The cult classic video game &quot;Deadly Premonition&quot;, that was heavily influenced by Twin Peaks, also has a Red Room of sorts that the protagonist Agent York Morgan visits on his dreams.

The video game &quot;The Evil Within 2&quot; frequently uses the Red Room motif, in association with one of the primary antagonists, Stefano Valentini.

On an episode of &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot; in September 2017, the opening segment featured actor Kyle MacLachlan having turned his dressing room into the Red Room, including speaking in the warped backwards manner.

It is also referenced in &quot;All Hail King Julien&quot; in the third episode of season three &quot;Dance, Dance, Resolution&quot; in which Mort speaks backwards to King Julien in the black lodge, you can see the mythical pineapple shadow on the red curtains and King Julien&#x27;s parents there, to which King Julian asks &quot;Mort why are you talking backwards!?&quot;, Mort then does a strange forward walk that also seems somewhat backwards to which King Julien&#x27;s parents clap, King Julien then tries to please his parents which then turns into Maurice, then King Julien awakes.

===&quot;Black Lodge&quot; (song)===
&quot;Twin Peaks&quot;&#x27; score conductor Angelo Badalamenti helped write the song &quot;Black Lodge&quot; on the 1993 &quot;Sound of White Noise&quot; album by Anthrax. The song was released as the album&#x27;s third single on August 19, 1993.

The sound of the song differs greatly from the band&#x27;s earlier thrash metal tracks, with AllMusic&#x27;s Dave Connolly describing it as &quot;cooled-down&quot;.

==== Music video ====
A music video was created for the song, being directed by past filmmaker Mark Pellington.

The video centers on a man and his wife, with the latter appearing to be a paraplegic. The man bathes, feeds, and dresses his wife, puts her in the backseat of a car and drives down Hollywood Boulevard. The man picks up a woman off of the street, Daphne (played by Jenna Elfman), with his assistant drugging her and taking her to an empty building. The assistant dresses Daphne up to look like the wife then straps her into a chair and places electrodes on her, while the wife sits across from her in a similar chair. The man tries to stimulate Daphne by rubbing her legs and having a puppy lick her face while the wife seems to feel what the woman does. The wife quickly returns to a catatonic state, while the assistant carries Daphne off and takes her picture in front of a backdrop that resembles the Red Room. As the video ends, the camera cuts to a shot of a board with several dozen pictures of other women who went through the same ordeal that Daphne did.

The band members briefly appear in the video, showing up in quick shots in the Red Room.

<doc id="1304986" wikidata="Q636906" url="?curid=1304986" title="Young Sherlock Holmes">
<text>Young Sherlock Holmes (also known with the title card name of Young Sherlock Holmes and the Pyramid of Fear) is a 1985 American mystery adventure film directed by Barry Levinson and written by Chris Columbus, based on the characters created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The film depicts a young Sherlock Holmes and John Watson meeting and solving a mystery together at a boarding school.

The film is notable for being the first full-length movie to feature a completely computer-generated character, created by Lucasfilm&#x27;s Graphics Group. This was a historical landmark in special effects history and influenced other CGI future films such as Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Toy Story&quot;.

At the 58th Academy Awards for films produced in 1985, the film was nominated for Best Visual Effects (Dennis Muren, Kit West, John R. Ellis, and David W. Allen).

==Plot==
Following the closure of his old school in the countryside, a young John Watson enrolls at London’s Brompton Academy, where Sherlock Holmes befriends him immediately. Holmes’ mentors there include Rupert Waxflatter, an eccentric retired professor to whom the school has given a large attic space for his inventions, which include a flying machine. Waxflatter&#x27;s niece, Elizabeth, and Holmes, are in love.

Elsewhere in the city, a hooded figure with a blowgun shoots two men with thorns that induce nightmarish hallucinations, causing their apparent suicides. Holmes brings his suspicions of foul play to Scotland Yard detective Lestrade, who rebuffs him.

After rival student Dudley frames him for misconduct, Holmes is expelled from Brompton. He has one last duel with Professor Rathe, the fencing instructor. While Holmes says goodbye to Watson, Waxflatter is shot with a thorn and stabs himself. Dying, he whispers the word &quot;Eh-Tar&quot; to Holmes.

Holmes, Watson and Elizabeth secretly investigate the murders, uncovering the existence of Rame-Tep, an ancient Egyptian cult of Osiris worshippers. The trio track the cult to a London paraffin warehouse and a secret underground wooden pyramid, where they interrupt the sacrifice of a young girl. The Rame-Tep shoot them with thorns and they escape to a cemetery to endure the hallucinations.

Back in Waxflatter&#x27;s loft, Holmes and Watson find a drawing of six men, including the three victims and a fourth man, Chester Cragwitch, who is still alive. That night, Holmes and Watson go to see Cragwitch, who explains that in his youth, he and the other five men were in Egypt, where they looted an underground pyramid containing the tombs of five Egyptian princesses. The resulting protest was violently put down by the British Army. A local boy named Eh-Tar and his sister vowed to seek revenge for their parents&#x27; deaths in the protests, and replace the bodies of the five princesses. As they return to the school, a chance remark by Watson causes Holmes to realize that Eh-Tar is none other than Professor Rathe.

Rathe and his sister, school nurse Mrs. Dribb, abduct Elizabeth to use as the final sacrifice. Using Waxflatter&#x27;s flying machine, Holmes and Watson reach the warehouse just in time to rescue Elizabeth and burn the pyramid down. When Rathe tries to shoot Holmes, Elizabeth shields Holmes with her body and is mortally wounded. In a resulting duel, Rathe falls into the frozen River Thames.

Holmes transfers to another school, and Watson gives him an antique pipe that he bought during the investigations as a Christmas/farewell present.

A mid-credits scene reveals that Rathe survived. Checking in at a hotel in Switzerland, he signs under a new name, &quot;Moriarty&quot;, foreshadowing his role as Holmes&#x27; future nemesis.

==Cast==
==Production==
While the film is based on characters created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the story is an original one penned by Chris Columbus. Though he admitted that he was &quot;very worried about offending some of the Holmes purists&quot;, Columbus used the original Doyle stories as his guide. Of the creation of the film, Columbus stated:

When Steven Spielberg came aboard the project he wanted to make certain the script had the proper tone and captured the Victorian era. He first had noted Sherlockian John Bennett Shaw read the screenplay and provide notes. He then had English novelist Jeffrey Archer act as script doctor to anglicize the script and ensure authenticity.

The cast includes actors with previous associations to Sherlock Holmes. Nigel Stock, who played Professor Waxflatter, portrayed Dr. Watson alongside both Douglas Wilmer and Peter Cushing in the BBC series of the 1960s. Patrick Newell, who played Bentley Bobster, played both PC Benson in 1965&#x27;s &quot;A Study in Terror&quot; as well as Inspector Lestrade in 1979&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson&quot;. As well, cast member Alan Cox&#x27;s father, actor Brian Cox, would later have a connection: he would play Dr. Joseph Bell, the inspiration for Holmes, in the television film &quot;The Strange Case of Sherlock Holmes &amp; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&quot;.

The film is notable for including the first fully computer-generated photorealistic animated character, a knight composed of elements from a stained glass window. This effect was the first CG character to be scanned and painted directly onto film using a RGB laser. The effect was created by Lucasfilm&#x27;s Industrial Light &amp; Magic and John Lasseter

The fencing scenes were shot at Penshurst Place in Kent.

In the United Kingdom and Australia, the film was titled &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes and the Pyramid of Fear&quot;; while in Italian &quot;Pyramid of fear&quot; (&quot;Piramide di paura&quot;), in Spanish and in French &quot;The secret of the pyramid&quot; (&quot;El secreto de la pirámide&quot;, &quot;Le secret de la pyramide&quot;), and in German &quot;The Secret of the Hidden Temple&quot; (&quot;Das Geheimnis des verborgenen Tempels&quot;) there was no hint to Sherlock Holmes.

==Music==
The film music was composed and conducted by Bruce Broughton, who has a long-standing history of scoring orchestral film soundtracks.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film was a box office disappointment domestically, grossing $19.7 million against an $18 million budget and ranking 46th for the year at the box office. Internationally it performed better, grossing $44 million for a worldwide total of $63.7 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 64% based on reviews from 22 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot; is a charming, if unnecessarily flashy, take on the master sleuth.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 65% based on reviews from 15 critics.

Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, and wrote: &quot;The elaborate special effects also seem a little out of place in a Sherlock Holmes movie, although I&#x27;m willing to forgive them because they were fun.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote: &quot;The production is first-rate in all technical ways imaginable, but the villain that Holmes and Watson chase is not worth their intellect or time or ours.&quot;
Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com called the film &quot;great fun&quot;.
Reviewing the film for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Leslie Bennetts called it &quot;a lighthearted murder mystery that weds Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to the kind of rollicking action-adventure that has made Steven Spielberg the most successful movie maker in the world&quot;.

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #77, and stated that &quot;Conan Doyle&#x27;s creation is reduced to an irritating sequence of in-jokes about deerstalkers, violins and pipes. Instead of sleuthing we get swashbuckling in the blazing temple and swordplay on the frozen Thames; creditable acting, but a crass production from start to finish.&quot;

Pauline Kael wrote, &quot;This sounds like a funnier, zestier picture than it turns out to be. ... As long as the movie stays within the conceits of the Holmesian legends, it&#x27;s mildly, blandly amusing. But when one of the imperilled old men gives an elaborate account of the background of the villainy ... your mind drifts and you lose the plot threads. And when the picture forsakes fog and coziness and the keenness of Holmes&#x27; intellect – when it starts turning him into a dashing action-adventure hero – the jig is up. ... the movie lets you down with a thump when Holmes and his companions enter a wooden pyramid-temple hidden under the London streets. ... There&#x27;s a resounding hollowness at the center of this picture – Levinson&#x27;s temple of doom&quot;.

R.L. Shaffer writing for IGN in 2010, felt the film &quot;doesn&#x27;t hold up all that well&quot; and that ultimately &quot;the film shall remain a cult classic – loved by some, but forgotten by most.&quot; DVD Verdict stated that the film was both &quot;a reimagining of the detective&#x27;s origin story, but it is also respectful of Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s work&quot; and &quot;a joy from beginning to end.&quot;

===Awards===
*1985 – Academy Award For Visual Effects (nominated)
*1985 – Saturn Award for Best Music - Bruce Broughton (won)

==Video game==
A video game based on the movie was released in 1987 for the MSX called &quot;Young Sherlock: The Legacy of Doyle&quot; released exclusively in Japan by Pack-In-Video. Although the game is based on the film, the plot of the game had little to do with the film&#x27;s story.

<doc id="1304989" wikidata="Q4906480" url="?curid=1304989" title="Big Sugar (band)">
<text>Big Sugar is a band formed in Toronto in 1988 by Gordie Johnson, the band&#x27;s lead singer, lead guitarist and main songwriter. Between 1996 and 2016, Big Sugar was among the top 25 best-selling Canadian bands in Canada. They are still active today, releasing new music, vinyl re-releases and touring.

==History==
Big Sugar originally consisted of Johnson, bassist Terry Wilkins, and drummer Al Cross. The three musicians had already played together for several years as a supporting band for Molly Johnson&#x27;s jazz performances, and as an informal jam band with members of the Bourbon Tabernacle Choir. When Molly Johnson returned to rock music with Infidels, she helped her former bandmates secure a record deal, leading to the eponymous debut album released in 1991 on Hypnotic Records.

==Success==
Wilkins left the band in 1993. Big Sugar recorded the album &quot;Five Hundred Pounds&quot; with the help of guest musicians, including harmonica and tenor saxophonist Kelly Hoppe, a.k.a. Mr. Chill. Hoppe and Johnson were longtime friends from the same home town; Hoppe had given Johnson his first gig as a guitarist. He brought a blues and old-school R&#x27;n&#x27;B influence into the band&#x27;s sound and later added keyboards and melodica. He became a regular member of the band in September 1994, while bassist Garry Lowe had joined the band that July.

Lowe moved to Toronto in the mid-1970s from Kingston, Jamaica, became a bass player for touring reggae recording artists, and was a founding member of Culture Shock, a popular Toronto reggae band. Johnson had long admired Lowe; his was the bass sound that Johnson had been looking for. Johnson told &quot;The Globe &amp; Mail&quot;, &quot;His bass sound became how I envisioned Big Sugar&#x27;s sound—a blend of blues and rock anchored by his reggae groove.&quot; Johnson told &quot;Artsfile&quot; Ottawa of their unique musical language, &quot;...so much of our connection was unspoken. We didn&#x27;t work things through musically. If I played a little something, he would play a little something back. It was a very symbiotic relationship.&quot;

In 1993, Big Sugar released the album &quot;Five Hundred Pounds&quot;, which had little publicity or radio airplay but sold 10,000 copies in Canada on the strength of their live shows. In 1995, Johnson also recorded an album under the name Don&#x27;t Talk Dance, with Tyler Stewart of Barenaked Ladies and Chris Brown of the Bourbon Tabernacle Choir.

In 1994 they appeared in the drama film &quot;The Circle Game&quot;, portraying the blues band of which the film&#x27;s lead character was a member, and performing several numbers in that context.

In 1995, Big Sugar released two EPs, &quot;Dear M.F.&quot; (which featured a cover version of Traffic&#x27;s &quot;Dear Mr. Fantasy&quot;) and &quot;Ride Like Hell&quot;. Drummer Stich Wynston, who had taken over from Al Cross, was replaced by Walter &quot;Crash&quot; Morgan. During a show in Iowa, Morgan suffered a heart attack and died on stage. Tyler Stewart flew in to help finish the tour, followed by Tony Rabalao. Lowe&#x27;s musical partner Tony &#x27;Raffa&#x27; White was enlisted for recording and other live performances, becoming Johnson&#x27;s favorite studio drummer and appearing on many Big Sugar albums. Former Odds member Paul Brennan subsequently joined as the band&#x27;s new drummer, playing on one of their most commercially successful albums, 1996&#x27;s &quot;Hemi-Vision&quot;. In May 1997, Brennan left the band; Al Cross returned in 1998.

A French version of &quot;Hemi-Vision&quot;″s single &quot; Up Baby&quot; was recorded, titled &quot;Ouvres-Toi Bébé&quot;, for radio stations in Quebec. The song gained widespread airplay in the province, and for their next album, 1998&#x27;s platinum-selling &quot;Heated&quot;, the band recorded a French version of each single they released; the French songs were collected on the 1999 EP &quot;Chauffe à bloc&quot;. Also that year, Johnson and Hoppe began to perform acoustic shows as a duo, billed as &quot;Big Sugar Acoustic—Two Fools on Stools&quot;.

In 1999, Big Sugar added a new rhythm guitarist, Lloyd &#x27;Mojah&#x27; Benn. In February that year they opened for The Rolling Stones at the Air Canada Centre, and in July, performed at Woodstock 1999.

In 2000, the band released a dub album, &quot;Extra Long Life&quot;, under the stage name AlKaline, which toured as an eight-piece band, complete with horn section. In 2001, Big Sugar released &quot;Brothers and Sisters, Are You Ready?&quot;; a complete track-for-track French version, &quot;Brothers and Sisters, Êtes Vous Ready?&quot;, was released the same year. The English album concluded with a blistering rendition of &quot;O Canada&quot; that became their signature version and was included on the 2017 Universal Music box set &quot;Canada 150: A Celebration of Music&quot;, released as part of the 150th anniversary of Canada.

==&quot;Hit And Run: The Best Of Big Sugar&quot;==
The two-CD compilation &quot;Hit &amp; Run&quot;, that included a special edition, limited-run live concert performance disc, was released in 2003. The live performance disc, &quot;Run&quot;, sold out on release day, with the two-disc set becoming a collector&#x27;s item.

==Hiatus==
Johnson moved to Austin, Texas, where, in 2003, he had co-founded the band Grady with &quot;Whipper&quot; Chris Layton on drums and Big Ben Richardson on bass. Described as &#x27;cowboy metal&#x27;, Grady recordings included some alternate versions of Big Sugar songs and was signed to the Jello Biafra label Alternative Tentacles as well as the Norwegian metal label Voices of Wonder. Stricken with carpal tunnel syndrome Johnson had surgery not knowing if he would be able to play guitar again. While recovering he taught himself to play triple neck steel guitar. Pairing that with Moog bass pedals, Johnson formed the duo Sit Down, Servant!!, first with drummer Stephane Beaudin, who was replaced by Brannen Temple. Sit Down, Servant!! toured the world, opening for Joe Satriani and George Thorogood. Kelly Hoppe formed Mr. Chill and The Witnesses, a roots music group. Mojah and Garry Lowe formed the reggae band Truth and Rights Revue, releasing one album. Johnson also formed the group Snakes of Central Texas, which is still active when Johnson is not on tour.

==Reunion==
Big Sugar reunited at the Telus World Ski &amp; Snowboard Festival in Whistler, B.C. on April 23, 2010, with tour dates through that summer. In June 2011, they released the album &quot;Revolution Per Minute&quot;, which included keyboard player and rapper DJ Friendlyness. &quot;Revolution Per Minute&quot; was released on CD and vinyl, with the vinyl album containing Alkaline dub remixes and bonus songs. This album contained the number one radio hit &quot;Roads Ahead&quot;. In 2012, Big Sugar released &quot;Eliminate Ya! Live!&quot;, a double CD/DVD set that included a new single covering Al Tuck&#x27;s &quot;Eliminate Ya!&quot;, recorded at the Burton Cummings Theatre in Winnipeg, Canada.

In 2012, the band welcomed special guest reggae legend Willi Williams on their national tour.

In 2014, Big Sugar released the album &quot;Yard Style&quot;, which contains unplugged versions of nine of their original songs, plus four previously unreleased songs. The album was recorded live off the floor with the large group of musicians, most on hand drums, sitting in a circle &#x27;yard style&#x27;. This release was followed by a three-month national theatre tour with the ensemble of musicians from the studio recording, resulting in 10–12 musicians on stage nightly. In June 2014, Raffa died of cancer.

Their next studio album, &quot;Calling All The Youth&quot;, was released in 2015 and distributed by eOne Records. The next two years were spent touring, including Big Sugar European tours, the North American acoustic tour, and summer festival dates. In 2015, Johnson&#x27;s wife, Alex Johnson, who had been Big Sugar&#x27;s manager since the &#x27;90s, joined the band on percussion and backing vocals.

In May 2017, Hoppe retired from touring and the band. DJ Friendlyness left to focus on his band, The Human Rights. Austin-based Rey Arteaga, master of Afro-Cuban Congas, joined Big Sugar, which had become a percussion-heavy, guitar-based band as it no longer had keyboards, harmonica or horns. On July 7, 2018, Garry Lowe died of cancer. Big Ben Richardson, Johnson&#x27;s partner in Grady who played bass in Big Sugar briefly before Lowe joined the band, returned to the stage and Chris Colepaugh joined on drums.

On December 28, 2018, the date of Garry Lowe&#x27;s birthday, Big Sugar played a tribute concert in Toronto of the Big Sugar song catalogue. Joining them were members of Barenaked Ladies, Bedouin Soundclash, Broken Social Scene, Sloan, Danko Jones, Dream Warriors, The Road Hammers, The Human Rights, I Mother Earth, The New Deal, Culture Shock, and Wide Mouth Mason, plus Tom Wilson, Isax Injah, Maestro Fresh Wes, Julian Taylor, Willi Williams, Errol Blackwood, Mojah Benn, Adrian Sheriff Miller, and Leroy Sibbles.

In 2018, Universal Music&#x27;s ICON album series released a &quot;Big Sugar ICON&quot; album. In 2020, Universal released the first album of new music in 5 years, the Big Sugar album &quot;Eternity Now&quot;. Recorded and mixed at the Johnsons&#x27; studio, The Sound Shack, it features Alex Lifeson of Rush playing guitar on the title track. With the world going into lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the release show and tour was cancelled and Johnson performed a record release show online, singing and playing live, accompanied by the recorded bedtracks. He then performed a record release show for the Deluxe Anniversary Hemi-Vision 25th Anniversary album, this time re-recording all parts himself and performing guitar and vocals live along with Warren Haynes, Chris Robinson, Rich Robinson, Colin James and Jason McCoy. A rendition of &quot;If I Had My Way&quot; saw hundreds of fans videos edited into the performance. It was such a feat that the record release show had to be delayed a day as Johnson put it all together in his studio. During the lockdown, Johnson also produced a one-season weekly series on YouTube called &quot;GJ in the SoundShack&quot;, in which he talked about songwriting, recording and the equipment he uses.

In 2021, Johnson launched the tour &quot;One Man Big Sugar Show—The Acoustical Sounds of Gordie Johnson&quot;, which is an acoustic performance of his songbook along with a showcase of his comedic skills.

In the years of pandemic shutdown, Gordie Johnson reimagined the band as a power trio. Resuming touring in 2022 he welcomed Garry Lowe&#x27;s son, bassist Ben Lowe, to the band. The new band also included drummer Joe Magistro (of The Black Crowes and The B-52&#x27;s). Universal Music Group released a deluxe 25th anniversary edition of the Big Sugar platinum album &quot;Heated&quot;, which featured &quot;An Evening With&quot; concert format of two sets, with the first being the album played live in its entirety for the first time, followed by hit songs and rarities after an intermission. Big Sugar&#x27;s much-anticipated “Heated 25th Anniversary Tour” continued through 2023 as Gordie Johnson returned to the stage with new bassist and fellow Austinite Anders Drerup and 22-year-old phenom drummer Root Valach. “Our music has always been about roots and culture and this is a perfect piece of that evolution.&quot;

2024 started with a Third Man Records vinyl deluxe release of &quot;Five Hundred Pounds&quot;, which sold out when announced, before the official release day. A second pressing of the album has gone into production. Label owner Jack White is a fan of the band, and has stated that &quot;Five Hundred Pounds&quot; is &quot;the best blues-based record to ever come out of Canada.&quot; White performed &quot;Ride Like Hell&quot; live during his concert in Toronto in 2022.

Big Sugar is touring with the &quot;500 Pounds Theatre Tour&quot; through 2024, which sees the entire album played live in the first set followed by hits and favorites in the second set.

<text>Magnolia guatemalensis is a tree found in the highlands and mountains of Guatemala, Chiapas, El Salvador, and Honduras. It is considered an indicator species of the cloud forest.

It is known locally as mamey, a common name that is also used for the unrelated species &quot;Pouteria sapota&quot; from Cuba and the fruit tree &quot;Mammea americana&quot; from Central and South America.

==Description==
&quot;Magnolia guatemalensis&quot; is an attractive tree, growing up to 15 meters high. It has tough glossy leaves, with red shiny stipules and sepals. The species is polymorphic, with leaves varying in size and shape, and sometimes lacking pubescence on the lower surface. It flowers from late February to late May. The species&#x27; flower petals are also polymorphic, varying in size and shape.

==Range and habitat==
&quot;Magnolia guatemalensis&quot; is found in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Its exact range is not well known. The type specimen was collected in Tactic, Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, where it is locally abundant in the marshes. It is also found in Guatemala&#x27;s Sierra de las Minas Biosphere Reserve. It is found in El Salvador&#x27;s Cerro de Montecristo National Park, and in the Opalaca, Montecillos, and Guajiquiro cordilleras of Honduras. Its estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) is 45,000 km2.

It is native to humid cloud forests and moist mixed forests between 1,300 and 2,600 meters elevation.

The species is threatened with habitat loss and deforestation across parts of its range, including illegal logging, human-caused fires, and clearing forests for cattle pasture and agriculture. 

==Subspecies==
There are two subspecies: &quot;M. guatemalensis&quot; subsp. &quot;guatemalensis&quot;, endemic to Guatemala; and &quot;M. guatemalensis&quot; subsp. &quot;hondurensis&quot;, commonly known as the Honduran magnolia, native to El Salvador and Honduras. Both subspecies have been assessed as endangered by the IUCN.

==Cultivation==
This species has been successfully hybridized with the Southern magnolia (&quot;M. grandiflora&quot;).

<doc id="1304997" wikidata="Q1645216" url="?curid=1304997" title="Australian garden orb weaver spider">
<text>The Australian garden orb weaver spider (Hortophora transmarina) is a very common species of spider with many variants in size, shape, and colour across the coastal and northern regions of Australia. They have very large abdomens when well-fed and exhibit a tremendous colour-range from off-white through tan, brown to almost black. They have a roughly leaf-shaped pattern on the top of their abdomen with a complex outline that is darker than the surrounding area. There may also be several whitish spots or one or more stripes. The spiders&#x27; cephalothoraxes (heads) and proximal (closer to the body) leg segments are usually darker, mostly reddish or reddish brown. They are able to change their colour with each moult to better match the background upon which they rest during the day.

The spiders are notable for the often large and intricate webs which they weave at night. They are usually nocturnal feeders, resting head down in their webs waiting to catch flying insects. They make their sticky rounded orb webs near lights and between trees where insects are likely to fly. During the day the spider will often rest somewhere near the web, usually under a leaf or twig, or in a crevice in bark or rock. They are commonly found around human habitation so may be found resting under leaves and in similar places. When disturbed they will retreat towards this rest area, although under imminent danger the spider will drop to the ground and &quot;play dead&quot;. Occasionally individual spiders will remain on the web during the day, possibly when prey has not been caught for a while, but this makes them more vulnerable to predation by birds.

Their bite is not dangerous to humans but may induce mild, local pain, redness, and occasionally swelling for a period of 30 minutes up to three to four hours.

The female is larger than the male, having a body length of 20 – 25 mm compared with 15 – 17 mm for the males. Females may also be distinguished by a needle-like epigynum protruding in the direction of the spinnerets.

<text>The 38th [[Grey Cup]], played at Varsity Stadium in Toronto on November 25, 1950, before 27,101 fans, also known as the Mud Bowl, was the Canadian football championship game played between the Toronto Argonauts and the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. The Argonauts won the game 13–0.

==Conditions on the field==

On the day before the game, a rare, heavy late November snowfall blanketed the field. Heavy equipment was dispatched to clear the snowfall before the game. However, the equipment damaged the turf, which was already in bad shape from poor groundskeeping during the regular season. To make matters worse, on the morning of the game the weather turned much warmer, and the snowfall turned to steady rain. By game time, the field was torn up and soaked with water, with the rain continuing through the entire game. Both teams had difficulty moving the ball in the conditions.

==Summary==
The game was remembered more for its poor field conditions than the actual game itself. The 1950 Grey Cup, forever dubbed &quot;The Mud Bowl,&quot; was won by the Toronto Argonauts, as they shut out the Winnipeg Blue Bombers 13–0. The game featured two teams facing each other for the sixth time in the Canadian football classic.

The wet and muddy conditions at Toronto&#x27;s Varsity Stadium created a quagmire but did not prevent the Argonauts from winning their eighth Grey Cup title. The Argos kicked for what turned out to be the winning point in the first quarter. Winnipeg&#x27;s Tom Casey misjudged Joe Krol&#x27;s punt from the Blue Bombers 49-yard line, as the ball went over his head and into the end zone for a rouge. Joe Krol avoided a potential turnover later in the half when he dropped the ball on an attempted kick in Bombers territory. The Argo star picked it up and raced around the end for 10 yards, putting the ball on the Winnipeg 15. After failing to make another first down, Nick Volpe kicked a 21-yard field goal to put the Argos up 4-0.

Before the end of the first half, the Argos increased the margin to 7-0. Toronto&#x27;s Billy Bass recovered Indian Jack Jacobs fumble at the Winnipeg 19. After two running plays from Ulysses &quot;Crazy Legs&quot; Curtis and Teddy Toogood, Nick Volpe was successful on a field goal from the Winnipeg 23. The Argos completed the scoring in the third quarter. Toronto&#x27;s Jake Dunlap blocked Jacobs&#x27; kick which the Boatmen recovered at the Winnipeg 20. Billy Bass and Al Dekdebrun carried to the four-yard line and Toogood to the one. On third down Dekdebrun slid across the goal line for the only touchdown of the game. Volpe missed the convert, but Joe Krol later kicked a single for the final point of the game. Dekdebrun directed Toronto&#x27;s ground offence all game, which steamrolled the Winnipeg defence for 232 yards.

This is the last time a team has been shut out in the Grey Cup final.

==Legacy==

The aftermath of the game generated severe criticism of the Canadian Rugby Union and the choice of Varsity, which had traditionally hosted the game almost every year due to its relatively large capacity and generally warmer weather in late November and early December compared to other cities. Some believed the game could have been played a week earlier to avoid adverse weather conditions. Wrote one writer, &quot;Because the field was like a pig&#x27;s wallow, what should have been a football classic turned into a slogging show.&quot; The lack of a tarpaulin to protect the field, which could have been obtained for approximately $5,000, was noted. The Calgary Stampeders, who had faced bad field conditions in the 1948 championship game, offered to pick up the expense on behalf of the league, but this offer was declined. Although Varsity Stadium, and later Exhibition Stadium, continued to be the primary venue for the Grey Cup, the criticism of the conditions at both fields eventually led to the venue shifting among the cities of the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union and the Western Interprovincial Football Union on a regular basis.

<doc id="1305003" wikidata="Q230887" url="?curid=1305003" title="Mariana Victoria of Spain">
<text>Mariana Victoria of Spain (; 31 March 1718 – 15 January 1781) was an &quot;Infanta of Spain&quot; by birth and was later the Queen of Portugal as the wife of King Joseph I. She acted as regent of Portugal in 1776–1777, during the last months of her husband&#x27;s life, and as advisor to her daughter, Maria I of Portugal, during her reign.

==Early life==
Mariana Victoria was born at the Royal Alcazar of Madrid in Madrid on 31 March 1718 and was given the same forenames as her paternal grandmother Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria, wife of &quot;Le Grand Dauphin&quot;. She was an &quot;Infanta of Spain&quot; by birth and the eldest daughter of Philip V of Spain and his second wife Elisabeth Farnese. Her father was a grandson of Louis XIV and had inherited the Spanish throne in 1700. At the time of her birth, Mariana Victoria was fifth in line to the throne of Spain behind her half brothers Infante Louis, Prince of Asturias, Infante Ferdinand, Infante Pedro as well as her full brother Infante Charles. As an &quot;Infanta of Spain&quot;, she had the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;.

===Engagement to Louis XV===

After the War of the Quadruple Alliance, France and Spain decided to reconcile by engaging the Infanta Mariana Victoria to her first cousin the young Louis XV of France. Organised by Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, Regent of France for the 11-year-old Louis XV, the match was part of a wider set of engagements which included the proposal of Philip V&#x27;s eldest son Infante Louis, Prince of Asturias to Élisabeth d&#x27;Orléans, &quot;Mademoiselle de Montpensier&quot; followed by another proposal between Philippine Élisabeth d&#x27;Orléans, &quot;Mademoiselle de Beaujolais&quot; to the young Infante Charles.

The Duc de Saint-Simon, the French ambassador, requested her hand on 25 November 1721. The exchange of the young Infanta and &quot;Mademoiselle de Montpensier&quot; was on the &quot;Île des Faisans&quot; (&quot;Isle of Pheasants&quot;) and was the site where their common ancestors, Louis XIV and Maria Theresa of Spain, had met in 1660. Mariana Victoria arrived in Paris on 2 March 1722 amongst much celebration, and took up residence at the Palais du Louvre. The young Infanta was nicknamed the &quot;l&#x27;infante Reine&quot; (&quot;Queen-Infanta&quot;) as the couple were not to be married until Mariana Victoria reached a more mature age. Mariana Victoria was in awe of Louis XV and was popular with the court – apart from the king himself, who avoided her presence.

According to the mother of the Regent, Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, Mariana Victoria was the &quot;sweetest and prettiest little thing&quot; and had considerable wit for her age. Her education was placed in the care of Marie Anne de Bourbon, the legitimised daughter of Louis XIV and Louise de La Vallière, and Madame de Ventadour was appointed her governess. In February 1723, Louis XV reached his majority and from then on governed the country according to his wishes.

Her establishment in France was not to be. Under the influence of the Prime Minister Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon, and his mistress Madame de Prie, the decision was made to send the seven-year-old Mariana Victoria back to Spain on 11 March 1725. Bourbon had wanted to maintain influence over the young Louis XV and offered his sister Henriette Louise de Bourbon as a potential wife who, unlike Mariana Victoria, was old enough to conceive. The situation was not helped by the Spanish rejection of Louise Élisabeth d&#x27;Orléans, whose husband died having ruled as Louis I of Spain for only seven months. As their marriage had not been consummated, the Spanish refused to support her and ordered that she return to France with her sister Philippine Élisabeth. Mariana Victoria left Versailles on 5 April 1725 and travelled to the frontier where she and the two Orléans daughters were then exchanged. Louis XV subsequently married Marie Leszczyńska in September 1725, and Mariana Victoria&#x27;s sister the Infanta Maria Teresa Rafaela married Louis XV&#x27;s son in 1745 to reassure the insulted Spanish court.

==Crown Princess of Portugal==
Her arrival in Spain was taken as a great insult, and caused a diplomatic rift between Spain and France. The offended Spanish soon afterward concluded a treaty with Austria, the 1725 Treaty of Vienna, whilst England sought support from France. Having remained unmarried she was still eligible to inherit the throne, but was displaced by her younger brother Infante Philip who was born in 1720. Discussions with the Kingdom of Portugal began in 1727 and a marriage was negotiated by the Portuguese ambassador the Marquis of Abrantes. She was a rumored bride for Emperor Peter II of Russia, grandson of Peter the Great. Another double marriage was planned. Mariana Victoria would marry the Infante José, &quot;Prince of Brazil&quot;, son and heir of João V of Portugal. Her older half-brother Ferdinand, &quot;Prince of Asturias&quot;, would marry José&#x27;s sister the Infanta Bárbara. Mariana Victoria married the &quot;Prince of Brazil&quot; (traditional title for the Portuguese heir to the throne) on 19 January 1729 at Elvas in Portugal. The &quot;Prince of Asturias&quot; (traditional title for the Spanish heir to the throne) married the Infanta Bárbara the next day at Badajoz. From her marriage until the time of her husband&#x27;s accession to the throne in 1750, she was styled &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; the Princess of Brazil.

Mariana and Joseph would soon have a close relationship. The couple enjoyed hunting as well as music – Mariana Victoria was an accomplished singer – they patronized Italian opera singers and the theatre but were both passionately religious. Despite this, her husband maintained various mistresses, much to the dislike of his strong-willed wife. During her marriage, Mariana Victoria gave birth to eight children, four of whom survived infancy. Her first child Infanta Maria was given the style &quot;Princess of Beira&quot; as the heir apparent to her father. Two of Mariana Victoria&#x27;s daughters remained unmarried. Her daughter Infanta Mariana Francisca was a proposed bride for the Dauphin of France, son of Louis XV, but Mariana Victoria herself rejected the plan. When her other daughter Infanta Doroteia was proposed as a wife for the future &quot;Philippe Égalité&quot; Mariana Victoria again refused to the match. Her youngest daughter Infanta Benedita married José, Prince of Brazil, Mariana Victoria&#x27;s grandson. The latter marriage was organised by Mariana Victoria herself after the death of her husband.

==Queen and regent==
At the death of her father-in-law, King John V, in 1750, her husband became the ruler of the Portuguese Empire which had significant territories in South America. Her husband&#x27;s reign was dominated by the influence of the &quot;Marquis of Pombal&quot; who was a favourite of the Queen mother. Joseph I soon left the governing of the state to Pombal who used his power to remove the influence of the church at the court as well as that of his enemies. Mariana Victoria and her daughter disliked the influence Pombal had over Joseph I. Her husband&#x27;s reign was marred by the devastating 1755 Lisbon earthquake of 1 November 1755 which killed 100,000 people. The earthquake caused Joseph I to develop a severe case of claustrophobia and he was never again comfortable living within a walled building. Consequently, he moved the royal court to an extensive complex of tents in the hills of Ajuda. It was Pombal who organised the reconstruction of Lisbon in the aftermath of the earthquake.

In 1759, the &quot;Távora affair&quot; emerged after an assassination attempt on her husband failed and the powerful Távora family were, in the eyes of Pombal, completely responsible for the attack. Pombal later ordered the execution of all members of the noble family and it was only at the intervention of Mariana Victoria and her daughter, the Princess of Brazil, that some women and children were spared. As Pombal was &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the state, Mariana Victoria and her husband took a less prominent role in politics.

Her husband, having suffered from a series of strokes, decided to allow his wife to take his place as head of government. As such, Mariana Victoria was created Regent of Portugal in her husband&#x27;s name. Created Regent on 29 November 1776, she remained so until her husband&#x27;s death on 24 February 1777. Upon her husband&#x27;s death, their eldest daughter became the first queen regnant as Maria I. Throughout Maria I&#x27;s reign Mariana Victoria exerted significant influence on her daughter, who would often ask her mother&#x27;s advice on matters of state. In the early days of Maria I&#x27;s reign, Pombal was exiled to the country.

==Queen dowager==

When her daughter had assumed government, Mariana Victoria took it upon herself to improve relations with her native Spain, which was ruled by her older brother Carlos III. The two countries had been in conflict regarding territorial possessions in the Americas. Leaving Portugal on 28 October 1777, Mariana Victoria travelled to Spain where she stayed for just over a year, residing both in Madrid and at Aranjuez. Mariana Victoria helped bring about a treaty between the two nations which was to be cemented by a double marriage between her grandchildren. These unions were between Charles III&#x27;s son Infante Gabriel and Mariana Victoria&#x27;s granddaughter the Infanta Mariana Vitória. The second marriage was between the Infanta Carlota, eldest granddaughter of Carlos III and Infante João. While in Spain, Mariana Victoria had had an attack of Rheumatism and was confined to a wheelchair for some time in August 1778. She returned to Portugal in November 1778. Her illness was furthered when it became clear that she was suffering from heart disease as well. The elderly Mariana Victoria died at the &quot;Real Barraca de Ajuda&quot;, a building which is where the present Ajuda National Palace is, on 15 January 1781. She was buried at the Church of Saint Francis of Paola in Lisbon.

==Legacy==

She was the godmother of Marie Antoinette who was born a day after the 1755 Lisbon earthquake devastated Lisbon. Mariana Victoria has descendants ranging from the present King of Spain, King of Belgium, Grand Duke of Luxembourg pretending Duke of Parma and the French Count of Paris. In 1822, her great-grandson Pedro became the first emperor of Brazil.

<doc id="1305019" wikidata="Q1542261" url="?curid=1305019" title="Izumi Matsumoto">
<text>, known by his pen name , was a Japanese manga artist best known for &quot;Kimagure Orange Road&quot;. His career started in 1982, publishing his comic &quot;Milk Report&quot; in the manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;. But real success came in 1984, publishing &quot;Kimagure Orange Road&quot; in the same magazine.

In 2005, he revealed that he was afflicted with a cerebrospinal fluid disease (possibly stemming from a car accident when he was three years old) that had forced him to take six years off work, and he hoped to bring attention to this disorder through a new manga.

On 3 November 2019, Matsumoto revealed that he had been diagnosed with spinal stenosis. Matsumoto died at 61 on October 6, 2020.

==Career==
Izumi Matsumoto began working for &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; when he cold called them and formed a relationship with Toshimasa Takahashi, then a junior editor in charge of answering phones. His work &quot;Live! Tottemo Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; then won a newcomer award. This led to the 1982 publication of &quot;Milk Report&quot; in &quot;Fresh Jump&quot;.

Just two years later he began &quot;Kimagure Orange Road&quot; in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;, which was an instant success. Following its end, he began &quot;Sesame Street&quot; (not to be confused with the television series of the same name) in &quot;Super Jump&quot;.

In 1994, Matsumoto conceived the idea for a digital manga on CD-ROM, the first of its kind. The five-volume &quot;Comic On&quot; was also possibly the first &quot;trans-hemispheric manga compilation&quot; as the semi-animated content set to music and dialogue also contained work by Jan Scott-Frazier and Lea Hernandez. Matsumoto set up his own company Genesis DPC to fund the project and partnered with Toshiba EMI to sell it. Manga publishers considered this a competitor, and Matsumoto struggled to get permission from Shueisha to use his own &quot;Kimagure Orange Road&quot; characters in the work.

==Works==
* &quot;Kimagure Orange Road&quot; (1984–1987, &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;)
* &quot;Comic Gunbuster&quot; (1989)
* &quot;Sesame Street&quot; (1990–1992, &quot;Super Jump&quot;)
* &quot;Comic On&quot; (1996)

<text>Field experiments are experiments carried out outside of laboratory settings. 

They randomly assign subjects (or other sampling units) to either treatment or control groups to test claims of causal relationships. Random assignment helps establish the comparability of the treatment and control group so that any differences between them that emerge after the treatment has been administered plausibly reflect the influence of the treatment rather than pre-existing differences between the groups. The distinguishing characteristics of field experiments are that they are conducted in real-world settings and often unobtrusively and control not only the subject pool but selection and overtness, as defined by leaders such as John A. List. This is in contrast to laboratory experiments, which enforce scientific control by testing a hypothesis in the artificial and highly controlled setting of a laboratory. Field experiments have some contextual differences as well from naturally-occurring experiments and quasi-experiments. While naturally-occurring experiments rely on an external force (e.g. a government, nonprofit, etc.) controlling the randomization treatment assignment and implementation, field experiments require researchers to retain control over randomization and implementation. Quasi-experiments occur when treatments are administered as-if randomly (e.g. U.S. Congressional districts where candidates win with slim margins, weather patterns, natural disasters, etc.). 

Field experiments encompass a broad array of experimental designs, each with varying degrees of generality. Some criteria of generality (e.g. authenticity of treatments, participants, contexts, and outcome measures) refer to the contextual similarities between the subjects in the experimental sample and the rest of the population. They are increasingly used in the social sciences to study the effects of policy-related interventions in domains such as health, education, crime, social welfare, and politics.

==Characteristics==
Under random assignment, outcomes of field experiments are reflective of the real-world because subjects are assigned to groups based on non-deterministic probabilities. Two other core assumptions underlie the ability of the researcher to collect unbiased potential outcomes: excludability and non-interference. The excludability assumption provides that the only relevant causal agent is through the receipt of the treatment. Asymmetries in assignment, administration or measurement of treatment and control groups violate this assumption. The non-interference assumption, or Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), indicates that the value of the outcome depends only on whether or not the subject is assigned the treatment and not whether or not other subjects are assigned to the treatment. When these three core assumptions are met, researchers are more likely to provide unbiased estimates through field experiments. 

After designing the field experiment and gathering the data, researchers can use statistical inference tests to determine the size and strength of the intervention&#x27;s effect on the subjects. Field experiments allow researchers to collect diverse amounts and types of data. For example, a researcher could design an experiment that uses pre- and post-trial information in an appropriate statistical inference method to see if an intervention has an effect on subject-level changes in outcomes. 

==Practical uses==
Field experiments offer researchers a way to test theories and answer questions with higher external validity because they simulate real-world occurrences. Some researchers argue that field experiments are a better guard against potential bias and biased estimators. As well, field experiments can act as benchmarks for comparing observational data to experimental results. Using field experiments as benchmarks can help determine levels of bias in observational studies, and, since researchers often develop a hypothesis from an judgment, benchmarks can help to add credibility to a study. While some argue that covariate adjustment or matching designs might work just as well in eliminating bias, field experiments can increase certainty by displacing omitted variable bias because they better allocate observed and unobserved factors. 

Researchers can utilize machine learning methods to simulate, reweight, and generalize experimental data. This increases the speed and efficiency of gathering experimental results and reduces the costs of implementing the experiment. Another cutting-edge technique in field experiments is the use of the multi armed bandit design, including similar adaptive designs on experiments with variable outcomes and variable treatments over time.

==Limitations==
There are limitations of and arguments against using field experiments in place of other research designs (e.g. lab experiments, survey experiments, observational studies, etc.). Given that field experiments necessarily take place in a specific geographic and political setting, there is a concern about extrapolating outcomes to formulate a general theory regarding the population of interest. However, researchers have begun to find strategies to effectively generalize causal effects outside of the sample by comparing the environments of the treated population and external population, accessing information from larger sample size, and accounting and modeling for treatment effects heterogeneity within the sample. Others have used covariate blocking techniques to generalize from field experiment populations to external populations.
Noncompliance issues affecting field experiments (both one-sided and two-sided noncompliance) can occur when subjects who are assigned to a certain group never receive their assigned intervention. Other problems to data collection include attrition (where subjects who are treated do not provide outcome data) which, under certain conditions, will bias the collected data. These problems can lead to imprecise data analysis; however, researchers who use field experiments can use statistical methods in calculating useful information even when these difficulties occur. 

Using field experiments can also lead to concerns over interference between subjects. When a treated subject or group affects the outcomes of the nontreated group (through conditions like displacement, communication, contagion etc.), nontreated groups might not have an outcome that is the true untreated outcome. A subset of interference is the spillover effect, which occurs when the treatment of treated groups has an effect on neighboring untreated groups. 

Field experiments can be expensive, time-consuming to conduct, difficult to replicate, and plagued with ethical pitfalls. Subjects or populations might undermine the implementation process if there is a perception of unfairness in treatment selection (e.g. in &#x27;negative income tax&#x27; experiments communities may lobby for their community to get a cash transfer so the assignment is not purely random). There are limitations to collecting consent forms from all subjects. Comrades administering interventions or collecting data could contaminate the randomization scheme. The resulting data, therefore, could be more varied: larger standard deviation, less precision and accuracy, etc. This leads to the use of larger sample sizes for field testing. However, others argue that, even though replicability is difficult, if the results of the experiment are important then there a larger chance that the experiment will get replicated. As well, field experiments can adopt a &quot;stepped-wedge&quot; design that will eventually give the entire sample access to the intervention on different timing schedules. Researchers can also design a blinded field experiment to remove possibilities of manipulation.

==Examples==
The history of experiments in the lab and the field has left longstanding impacts in the physical, natural, and life sciences. Modern use field experiments has roots in the 1700s, when James Lind utilized a controlled field experiment to identify a treatment for scurvy. 

Other categorical examples of sciences that use field experiments include:

* Economists have used field experiments to analyze discrimination (e.g., in the labor market, in housing, in the sharing economy, in the credit market, or in integration), health care programs, charitable fundraising, education, information aggregation in markets, and microfinance programs.
* Engineers often conduct field tests of prototype products to validate earlier laboratory tests and to obtain broader feedback.
*Social psychology has pioneering figures who utilized field experiments, including Kurt Lewin and Stanley Milgram. 
*Agricultural science researcher R.A. Fisher analyzed randomized actual &quot;field&quot; experimental data for crops. 
*Political Science researcher Harold Gosnell conducted an early field experiment on voter participation in 1924 and 1925.
*Ecology Joseph H. Connell’s field experiment.

<text>Neuroscience and intelligence refers to the various neurological factors that are partly responsible for the variation of intelligence within species or between different species. A large amount of research in this area has been focused on the neural basis of human intelligence. Historic approaches to studying the neuroscience of intelligence consisted of correlating external head parameters, for example head circumference, to intelligence. Post-mortem measures of brain weight and brain volume have also been used. More recent methodologies focus on examining correlates of intelligence within the living brain using techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), positron emission tomography and other non-invasive measures of brain structure and activity.

Researchers have been able to identify correlates of intelligence within the brain and its functioning. These include overall brain volume, grey matter volume, white matter volume, white matter integrity, cortical thickness and neural efficiency. 

Analyses of the parameters of intellectual systems, patterns of their emergence and evolution, distinctive features, and the constants and limits of their structures and functions made it possible to measure and compare the capacity of communications (~100 m/s), to quantify the number of components in intellectual systems (~1011 neurons), and to calculate the number of successful links responsible for cooperation (~1014 synapses). 

Although the evidence base for our understanding of the neural basis of human intelligence has increased greatly over the past 30 years, even more research is needed to fully understand it.

The neural basis of intelligence has also been examined in animals such as primates, cetaceans, and rodents.

==Humans==

===Brain volume===
One of the main methods used to establish a relationship between intelligence and the brain is to use measures of brain volume. The earliest attempts at estimating brain volume were done using measures of external head parameters, such as head circumference as a proxy for brain size. More recent methodologies employed to study this relationship include post-mortem measures of brain weight and volume. These have their own limitations and strengths. The advent of MRI as a non-invasive highly-accurate measure of living brain structure and function (using fMRI) made this the pre-dominant and preferred method for measuring brain volume.

Overall, larger brain size and volume is associated with better cognitive functioning and higher intelligence. The specific regions that show the most robust correlation between volume and intelligence are the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes of the brain. A large number of studies have been conducted with uniformly positive correlations, leading to the generally safe conclusion that larger brains predict greater intelligence. In healthy adults, the correlation of total brain volume and IQ is approximately 0.4 when high-quality tests are used. A large scale study (n = 29k) using the UK Biobank found a correlation of .275. The strength of this relationship did not depend on sex, contradicting some earlier studies. A study using a sibling-design in two medium sized samples found evidence of causality with an effect size of .19. This study design rules out confounders that vary between families, but not those that vary within families.

Less is known about variation on scales less than total brain volume. A meta-analytic review by McDaniel found that the correlation between intelligence and in vivo brain size was larger for females (0.40) than for males (0.25). The same study also found that the correlation between brain size and Intelligence increased with age, with children showing smaller correlations. It has been suggested that the link between larger brain volumes and higher intelligence is related to variation in specific brain regions: a whole-brain measure would under-estimate these links. For functions more specific than general intelligence, regional effects may be more important. For instance evidence suggests that in adolescents learning new words, vocabulary growth is associated with gray matter density in bilateral posterior supramarginal gyri. Small studies have shown transient changes in gray-matter associated with developing a new physical skill (juggling) occipito-temporal cortex 

Brain volume is not a perfect account of intelligence: the relationship explains a modest amount of variance in intelligence – 12% to 36% of the variance. The amount of variance explained by brain volume may also depend on the type of intelligence measured. Up to 36% of variance in verbal intelligence can be explained by brain volume, while only approximately 10% of variance in visuospatial intelligence can be explained by brain volume. A 2015 study by researcher Stuart J. Ritchie found that brain size explained 12% of the variance in intelligence among individuals. These caveats imply that there are other major factors influencing how intelligent an individual is apart from brain size. In a large meta-analysis consisting of 88 studies Pietschnig et al. (2015) estimated the correlation between brain volume and intelligence to be about correlation coefficient of 0.24 which equates to 6% variance. Taking into account measurement quality, and sample type and IQ-range, the meta-analytic association of brain volume in appears to be ~ .4 in normal adults. Researcher Jakob Pietschnig argued that the strength of the positive association of brain volume and IQ remains robust, but has been overestimated in the literature. He has stated that &quot;It is tempting to interpret this association in the context of human cognitive evolution and species differences in brain size and cognitive ability, we show that it is not warranted to interpret brain size as an isomorphic proxy of human intelligence differences&quot;.

===Grey matter===

Grey matter has been examined as a potential biological foundation for differences in intelligence. Similarly to brain volume, global grey matter volume is positively associated with intelligence. More specifically, higher intelligence has been associated with larger cortical grey matter in the prefrontal and posterior temporal cortex in adults. Furthermore, both verbal and nonverbal intelligence have been shown to be positively correlated with grey matter volume across the parietal, temporal and occipital lobes in young healthy adults, implying that intelligence is associated with a wide variety of structures within the brain.

There appear to be sex differences between the relationship of grey matter to intelligence between men and women. Men appear to show more intelligence to grey matter correlations in the frontal and parietal lobes, while the strongest correlations between intelligence and grey matter in women can be found in the frontal lobes and Broca&#x27;s area. However, these differences do not seem to impact overall Intelligence, implying that the same cognitive ability levels can be attained in different ways.

One specific methodology used to study grey matter correlates of intelligence in areas of the brain is known as voxel-based morphometry (VBM). VBM allows researchers to specify areas of interest with great spatial resolution, allowing the examination of grey matter areas correlated with intelligence with greater special resolution. VBM has been used to correlate grey matter positively with intelligence in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes in healthy adults. VBM has also been used to show that grey matter volume in the medial region of the prefrontal cortex and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex correlate positively with intelligence in a group of 55 healthy adults. VBM has also been successfully used to establish a positive correlation between grey matter volumes in the anterior cingulate and intelligence in children aged 5 to 18 years old.

Grey matter has also been shown to positively correlate with intelligence in children. Reis and colleagues have found that grey matter in the prefrontal cortex contributes most robustly to variance in Intelligence in children between 5 and 17, while subcortical grey matter is related to intelligence to a lesser extent. Frangou and colleagues examined the relationship between grey matter and intelligence in children and young adults aged between 12 and 21, and found that grey matter in the orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, cerebellum and thalamus was positively correlated to intelligence, while grey matter in the caudate nucleus is negatively correlated with intelligence. However, the relationship between grey matter volume and intelligence only develops over time, as no significant positive relationship can be found between grey matter volume and intelligence in children under 11.

An underlying caveat to research into the relationship of grey matter volume and intelligence is demonstrated by the hypothesis of neural efficiency. The findings that more intelligent individuals are more efficient at using their neurons might indicate that the correlation of grey matter to intelligence reflects selective elimination of unused synapses, and thus a better brain circuitry.

===White matter===

Similar to grey matter, white matter has been shown to correlate positively with intelligence in humans. White matter consists mainly of myelinated neuronal axons, responsible for delivering signals between neurons. The pinkish-white color of white matter is actually a result of these myelin sheaths that electrically insulate neurons that are transmitting signals to other neurons. White matter connects different regions of grey matter in the cerebrum together. These interconnections make transport more seamless and allow us to perform tasks easier. Significant correlations between intelligence and the corpus callosum have been found, as larger callosal areas have been positively correlated with cognitive performance. However, there appear to be differences in importance for white matter between verbal and nonverbal intelligence, as although both verbal and nonverbal measures of intelligence correlate positively with the size of the corpus callosum, the correlation for intelligence and corpus callosum size was larger (.47) for nonverbal measures than that for verbal measures (.18). Anatomical mesh-based geometrical modelling has also shown positive correlations between the thickness of the corpus callosum and Intelligence in healthy adults.

White matter integrity has also been found to be related to intelligence. White matter tract integrity is important for information processing speed, and therefore reduced white matter integrity is related to lower intelligence. The effect of white matter integrity is mediate entirely through information processing speed. These findings indicate that the brain is structurally interconnected and that axonal fibres are integrally important for fast information process, and thus general intelligence.

Contradicting the findings described above, VBM failed to find a relationship between the corpus callosum and intelligence in healthy adults. This contradiction can be viewed to signify that the relationship between white matter volume and intelligence is not as robust as that of grey matter and intelligence.

===Cortical thickness===

Cortical thickness has also been found to correlate positively with intelligence in humans. However, the rate of growth of cortical thickness is also related to intelligence. In early childhood, cortical thickness displays a negative correlation with intelligence, while by late childhood this correlation has shifted to a positive one. More intelligent children were found to develop cortical thickness more steadily and over longer periods of time than less bright children. Studies have found cortical thickness to explain 5% in the variance of intelligence among individuals. In a study conducted to find associations between cortical thickness and general intelligence between different groups of people, sex did not play a role in intelligence. Although it is hard to pin intelligence on age based on cortical thickness due to different socioeconomic circumstances and education levels, older subjects (17 - 24) tended to have less variances in terms of intelligence than when compared to younger subjects (19 - 17).

=== Cortical convolution ===
The folding of the brain’s surface, known as cortical convolution, has become more pronounced throughout human evolution. It has been suggested that this increased folding serves as a neurological foundation for some of the brain’s most unique cognitive functions. As a result, the extent of cortical convolution may play a role in shaping individual intelligence within the human species. 

An analysis published in 2019 found the contours of 677 children and adolescent (mean age 12.72 years) brains had a genetic correlation of almost 1 between IQ and surface area of the supramarginal gyrus on the left side of the brain.

===Neural efficiency===

The neural efficiency hypothesis postulates that more intelligent individuals display less activation in the brain during cognitive tasks, as measured by Glucose metabolism. A small sample of participants (N=8) displayed negative correlations between intelligence and absolute regional metabolic rates ranging from -0.48 to -0.84, as measured by PET scans, indicating that brighter individuals were more effective processors of information, as they use less energy. According to an extensive review by Neubauer &amp; Fink a large number of studies (N=27) have confirmed this finding using methods such as PET scans, EEG and fMRI.

fMRI and EEG studies have revealed that task difficulty is an important factor affecting neural efficiency. More intelligent individuals display neural efficiency only when faced with tasks of subjectively easy to moderate difficulty, while no neural efficiency can be found during difficult tasks. In fact, more able individuals appear to invest more cortical resources in tasks of high difficulty. This appears to be especially true for the Prefrontal Cortex, as individuals with higher intelligence displayed increased activation of this area during difficult tasks compared to individuals with lower intelligence. It has been proposed that the main reason for the neural efficiency phenomenon could be that individuals with high intelligence are better at blocking out interfering information than individuals with low intelligence.

===Further research===
Some scientists prefer to look at more qualitative variables to relate to the size of measurable regions of known function, for example relating the size of the primary visual cortex to its corresponding functions, that of visual performance.

In a study of the head growth of 633 term-born children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort, it was shown that prenatal growth and growth during infancy were associated with subsequent IQ. The study’s conclusion was that the brain volume a child achieves by the age of 1 year helps determine later intelligence. Growth in brain volume after infancy may not compensate for poorer earlier growth.

There is an association between IQ and myopia. One suggested explanation is that one or several pleiotropic gene(s) affect the size of the neocortex part of the brain and eyes simultaneously. 

====Parieto-frontal integration theory====

In 2007, Behavioral and Brain Sciences published a target article that put forth a biological model of intelligence based on 37 peer-reviewed neuroimaging studies (Jung &amp; Haier, 2007). Their review of a wealth of data from functional imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography) and structural imaging (diffusion MRI, voxel-based morphometry, in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy) argues that human intelligence arises from a distributed and integrated neural network comprising brain regions in the frontal and parietal lobes.

A recent lesion mapping study conducted by Barbey and colleagues provides evidence to support the P-FIT theory of intelligence.

Brain injuries at an early age isolated to one side of the brain typically results in relatively spared intellectual function and with IQ in the normal range.

==Primates==

===Brain size===
Another theory of brain size in vertebrates is that it may relate to social rather than mechanical skills. Cortical size relates directly to pair-bonding lifestyle and among primates, cerebral cortex size varies directly with the demands of living in a large complex social network. Compared to other mammals, primates have significantly larger brain sizes. Additionally, most primates are found to be polygynandrous, having many social relationships with others. Although inconclusive, some studies have shown that this polygynandrous statue correlates to brain size.

Intelligence in chimpanzees has been found to be related to brain size, grey matter volume, and cortical thickness, as in humans.

== Health ==
Several environmental factors related to health can lead to significant cognitive impairment, particularly if they occur during pregnancy and childhood when the brain is growing and the blood–brain barrier is less effective. Developed nations have implemented several health policies regarding nutrients and toxins known to influence cognitive function. These include laws requiring fortification of certain food products and laws establishing safe levels of pollutants (e.g. lead, mercury, and organochlorides). Comprehensive policy recommendations targeting reduction of cognitive impairment in children have been proposed.

<doc id="1305048" wikidata="Q1155243" url="?curid=1305048" title="Council of State (Netherlands)">
<text>The Council of State () is a constitutionally established advisory body in the Netherlands to the government and States General that officially consists of members of the royal family and Crown-appointed members generally having political, commercial, diplomatic or military experience. It was founded in 1531, making it one of the world&#x27;s oldest still-functioning state organisations.

The Council of State must be consulted by the cabinet on proposed legislation before a law is submitted to parliament. The Council of State Administrative Law division also serves as one of the four highest courts of appeal in administrative matters. The King is president of the Council of State but he seldom chairs meetings. The Vice-President of the Council of State chairs meetings in his absence and is the &quot;de facto&quot; major personality of the institution. Under Dutch constitutional law, the Vice-President of the Council is acting head of state when there is no monarch such as if the royal family were to become extinct.

==History==
===Habsburg Netherlands===
Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor founded a Council of State on 1 October 1531 as one of three &quot;Collateral Councils&quot; (the other two were the &quot;Privy Council&quot; or &quot;Secret Council&quot; and the &quot;Council of Finances&quot;) to advise his sister Mary of Hungary, his regent in the Habsburg Netherlands, and her successors, on , in other words the main questions of government, foreign affairs and defense. Members of the council were the great nobles of the realm and a few of the great prelates.

After the accession of Philip II of Spain to the throne and his departure to Spain in 1559 the Council became the forum for the strife between the Spanish representatives in the Council, led by Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle and the Netherlandish grandees like the Prince of Orange and the Counts of Horne and Egmont. The latter faction felt themselves pushed aside and resigned in 1567, leaving the field to a Spanish-dominated Council at the start of the Dutch Revolt. After the death of Luis de Requesens y Zúñiga, then governor-general of the Habsburg Netherlands, in 1576, the Council of State temporarily assumed his authority as representative of king Philip, awaiting the arrival of the new governor-general, Don Juan. Before he could arrive the members of the Council were arrested in a coup by the Brussels garrison. Soon afterwards the Pacification of Ghent was concluded pitting the States-General of the Netherlands against the Spanish crown, represented by Don Juan. When the latter retreated to Namur in early 1577 the Council of State split in two rumps, one joining Don Juan (and forming the nucleus of what would become the Council of State of the Spanish Netherlands and later the Austrian Netherlands) the other remaining close to the rebellious States-General. These members were discharged by king Philip in 1578, formally ending the Council as a Habsburg institution in what was to become the Dutch Republic.

===Under Anjou and Leicester===
When the Duke of Anjou came to be temporarily recognized as the new sovereign of the rebellious provinces in 1581, a new Council of State was appointed to advise him and to perform certain executive duties, pertaining to defense and finances. This Council soon split in two regional councils, one for the area West of the river Meuse, the other for the area East of that river. The first, residing in Antwerp where the States-General also convened, played the main role up to the departure of the Duke. After his departure the (again unified) Council followed the States-General to Middelburg, Delft, and The Hague. After the assassination of the Prince of Orange in 1584 the Council was given new executive powers and temporarily assumed full executive authority in the place of the Prince. The States-General meanwhile took the lead in the search for another protecting sovereign. This resulted in the Treaty of Nonsuch of 1585 with Elizabeth I of England that explicitly assumed a leading role of the Council in the evolving constitution of the provinces of the Union of Utrecht. Article XIV of the treaty authorised Elizabeth to appoint two English representatives on the Council, besides the Governor-General, who would preside the council. The next articles gave far-reaching authority to the Governor-General, acting with the council, in matters of defense, finance and government. For instance, the Stadtholders of the provinces would henceforth be appointed by the Governor-General and the Council (art. XXIV), though the States of Holland and West Friesland preempted this by appointing Maurice, Prince of Orange stadtholder before the Earl of Leicester, who would accept the Governor-Generalship, conferred on him by the States-General against the wish of Elizabeth, arrived in the Netherlands. 
This was the first instance of the way the mighty province of Holland frustrated the policies of Leicester. His attempt to found a new Council of Finances (the old one had been dissolved in 1580), which was supposed to take a number of the financial powers of the Council of State, was quietly thwarted. On the instigation of the Land&#x27;s Advocate of Holland, Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, who was a member of the Council, more and more executive tasks of the Council were taken over by the States-General, to dilute English influence on the Dutch affairs of state. These tasks and this influence of the Council did not return after Leicester had left the Netherlands at the end of 1587.

===Under the Dutch Republic===
By 1588 the Council had therefore reached the structure and functions it would possess during the entire existence of the Dutch Republic. The Council was henceforth made up of members appointed by the States-General on the nomination of the Provincial States (usually about 12), with two members (between 1598 and 1625 one) appointed by the English government. The stadtholders of the provinces were &quot;ex officio&quot; members, at least outside the First Stadtholderless Period and Second Stadtholderless Period. The executive powers of the Council were limited to military policy (both on land and sea); administering the Dutch States Army&#x27;s financial aspects (naval affairs were administered by the five &quot;Admiralties&quot;, founded by Leicester); and formulating and executing tax policy for the Generality Lands.

The Council usually played a self-effacing role, as laid down in its Instruction of 1651, at the beginning of the first Stadtholderless Period. However, the secretary of the Council, Simon van Slingelandt played a leading role in an attempt at constitutional reform (which would have greatly increased the executive powers of the Council, as intended in the time of Leicester) in 1717. This attempt came to nothing, however.

After the overthrow of the regime of stadtholder William V, Prince of Orange and the founding of the Batavian Republic in 1795, the Council was dissolved, together with the States-General.

===Under the Kingdom of the Netherlands===
Though an advisory council with the nostalgic name Council of State was again instituted in the waning days of the Batavian Republic in 1805, and also the successor Kingdom of Holland had an institution with that name (modeled on the contemporary French Council of State), these councils disappeared again during the years of the annexation by France (1810-1813). However, after the restoration of Dutch independence in 1813 a new Council of State was founded as laid down in the Constitutions of 1814 and 1815. These constitutions explicitly stated that all &quot;Acts of Sovereign Dignity&quot; by the Sovereign Prince and later the King, would only be enacted after the advice of the Council was heard. These included both Acts of the States-General and Royal Decrees, important, because the first king, William I of the Netherlands liked to rule by decree. The King presided over the new Council, and the Crown-Prince would be a member &quot;ex officio&quot; after reaching the age of majority. In practice, however, a vice-president presided over the deliberations of the Council, the King only taking over on ceremonial occasions. Members were appointed from all provinces, both &quot;Dutch&quot; and &quot;Belgian&quot;. After the Belgian Revolution of 1830 the Belgian members left. The new Kingdom of Belgium did not institute its own Council of State until 1946 as an administrative court.
Under the new constitution of 1848 the Council of State was reformed in the sense that its structure and functions were delegated to an Organic Law. The first such law (the Council of State Act) was enacted in 1861. The most important innovation of this law was that besides the advisory task of the Council in matters of law giving the Council would also advise in cases in which conflicts between administrative organs (like provinces and municipalities) were put before the Crown (king and ministers) for resolution. For this type of advice a new subdivision of the Council was formed that came to act like an administrative court (though the formal decision rested with the Crown). This function of high administrative court was enlarged in the succeeding century. Finally, the 1861 law made the Council the institution that would exercise royal authority in the absence of the king or a regent. This case did happen for short periods in 1889 and 1890, in those periods the Council served as regent for King William III under the Vice-President Gerlach Cornelis Joannes van Reenen. 

In 1887 the revised constitution opened the way for making the Council a formal administrative court. This did not actually happen before 1963 when the &quot;Wet Beroep Administratieve Beschikkingen&quot; (BAB, Administrative Decisions Review Act) was enacted, replaced in 1976 by the &quot;Wet Administratief Beroep Overheidsbeschikkingen&quot; (AROB, Administrative Decisions Appeals Act). This setup was changed in 1988, because the European Court of Human Rights had deemed in &quot;Benthem v Netherlands&quot; that the fact that the Council of State was not an independent institution ran contrary to the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights. To permanently remedy this defect the &quot;judicial&quot; part of the Council was in 1994 made formally independent from the part that advised on legislative matters. This split in two separate parts was confirmed in the most recent revision (2010) of the Council of State Act.

<text>Imperial Sugar Company is a major U.S. sugar producer and marketer based in Sugar Land, Texas, with sugar refinery operations in California, Georgia, and Louisiana. The company was established in 1843 and has undergone ownership changes multiple times. The current name, Imperial Sugar Company, was established after a change in ownership in 1907. The company went through major expansion through acquisitions beginning in 1988, but filed for bankruptcy in 2001, emerging in the same year and embarking on a downsizing strategy. In May 2012, the company was purchased by Louis Dreyfus Group of the Netherlands. In November 2022, Dreyfus sold Imperial to U.S. Sugar.

==History==
The company has been headquartered in Sugar Land since its inception. The city itself is named for the company and the company&#x27;s crown logo is featured in the city&#x27;s seal. The company was founded in 1843 by Samuel May Williams and passed through a series of owners until its purchase in 1907 by the I. H. Kempner family of Galveston. The company was later renamed the Imperial Sugar Company, in an effort to emphasize quality. Up until 1988 the company had only one plant, at its original location in Texas, when they purchased the Holly Sugar Corporation, a sugar beet processor headquartered in Colorado Springs. At that time Imperial Sugar Company became Imperial Holly Corporation and began publicly trading on Nasdaq.

Since the initial acquisition the company has made several more acquisitions that effectively doubled the corporation&#x27;s size each time. The company&#x27;s name returned to Imperial Sugar Company in 1999.

On , the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, attributing its problems to lower sales for refined sugar as well as higher energy costs. Then on August 29, 2001, the company emerged from Chapter 11 and has since turned its focus inward as it downsizes its operations. In 2003, Imperial won the Wharton Infosys Business Transformation Award for innovative use of web technology to help turn around the business. The company no longer refines sugar at its original plant in Sugar Land (the facility was closed in 2003) but its corporate headquarters are still located in its founding city.

On , two buildings of the Sugar Land factory were demolished by controlled explosion to facilitate the development of the property for residences, business properties and park land.

In 2010, Imperial exchanged its aging nineteenth-century Gramercy, Louisiana refinery to Louisiana Sugar Refiners, LLC (LSR) for a one-third interest in the new company. LSR commenced operations on . Imperial continues to operate a small-bag processing facility at Gramercy.

=== 2008 explosion ===

On , an explosion at a Port Wentworth, Georgia, sugar refinery killed 14 people and injured more than 40. It was likely caused by an overheated bearing on a conveyor beneath the sugar silos, which ignited sugar dust, then spread in a chain reaction of sugar dust explosions in the finished-sugar packaging area of the plant. OSHA had been criticized in a 2006 US Chemical Safety Board report for lack of preparation for such explosions and a safety program that &quot;inadequately addresses dust explosion hazards&quot;. As of August 26, 2008, the death toll had risen to 14, with one still in critical condition.

The plant, originally built as the Dixie Crystals sugar refinery in 1916–1917, had been acquired by Imperial Sugar in 1997. At the time of its purchase, the Port Wentworth refinery was the second-largest sugar refining operation in the U.S.

=== Acquisition by Louis Dreyfus Group ===
On 1 May 2012, Louis Dreyfus Commodities LLC announced that one of its subsidiaries would acquire all outstanding Imperial Sugar stock for $6.35 per share and assume $125 million in Imperial Sugar debt. The price per share represented a 57% premium over Imperial Sugar&#x27;s closing price on 30 April. A spokesman for Dreyfus group said the acquisition was part of the company&#x27;s efforts to expand into refining and distribution of sugar.

=== Acquisition by U.S. Sugar ===
In November 2021, US Sugar and Imperial Sugar announced their intentions to merge the two companies. They were sued by the US Department of Justice who claimed in a statement that the deal was anticompetitive and would “leave an overwhelming majority of refined sugar sales across the Southeast in the hands of only two producers”. Imperial Sugar and US Sugar stated that they disagreed with the antitrust lawsuit and that they fully intended to litigate.

US Sugar completed the $315 million purchase of Imperial in November 2022.

On July 13, 2023, 7he 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia rejected the U.S. government&#x27;s claim that the merger violated antitrust and refused to undo the merger.

<doc id="1305071" wikidata="Q2532492" url="?curid=1305071" title="Bridge (graph theory)">
<text>In graph theory, a bridge, isthmus, cut-edge, or cut arc is an edge of a graph whose deletion increases the graph&#x27;s number of connected components. Equivalently, an edge is a bridge if and only if it is not contained in any cycle. For a connected graph, a bridge can uniquely determine a cut. A graph is said to be bridgeless or isthmus-free if it contains no bridges.

This type of bridge should be distinguished from an unrelated meaning of &quot;bridge&quot; in graph theory, a subgraph separated from the rest of the graph by a specified subset of vertices; see bridge in the Glossary of graph theory.

==Trees and forests==
A graph with formula_1 nodes can contain at most formula_2 bridges, since adding additional edges must create a cycle. The graphs with exactly formula_2 bridges are exactly the trees, and the graphs in which every edge is a bridge are exactly the forests.

In every undirected graph, there is an equivalence relation on the vertices according to which two vertices are related to each other whenever there are two edge-disjoint paths connecting them. (Every vertex is related to itself via two length-zero paths, which are identical but nevertheless edge-disjoint.) The equivalence classes of this relation are called 2-edge-connected components, and the bridges of the graph are exactly the edges whose endpoints belong to different components. The bridge-block tree of the graph has a vertex for every nontrivial component and an edge for every bridge.

==Relation to vertex connectivity==
Bridges are closely related to the concept of articulation vertices, vertices that belong to every path between some pair of other vertices. The two endpoints of a bridge are articulation vertices unless they have a degree of 1, although it may also be possible for a non-bridge edge to have two articulation vertices as endpoints. Analogously to bridgeless graphs being 2-edge-connected, graphs without articulation vertices are 2-vertex-connected.

In a cubic graph, every cut vertex is an endpoint of at least one bridge.

==Bridgeless graphs==
A bridgeless graph is a graph that does not have any bridges. Equivalent conditions are that each connected component of the graph has an open ear decomposition, that each connected component is 2-edge-connected, or (by Robbins&#x27; theorem) that every connected component has a strong orientation.

An important open problem involving bridges is the cycle double cover conjecture, due to Seymour and Szekeres (1978 and 1979, independently), which states that every bridgeless graph admits a multi-set of simple cycles which contains each edge exactly twice.

==Tarjan&#x27;s bridge-finding algorithm==
The first linear time algorithm (linear in the number of edges) for finding the bridges in a graph was described by Robert Tarjan in 1974. It performs the following steps:
* Find a spanning forest of formula_4
* Create a Rooted forest formula_5 from the spanning forest
* Traverse the forest formula_5 in preorder and number the nodes. Parent nodes in the forest now have lower numbers than child nodes.
* For each node formula_7 in preorder (denoting each node using its preorder number), do:
** Compute the number of forest descendants formula_8 for this node, by adding one to the sum of its children&#x27;s descendants.
** Compute formula_9, the lowest preorder label reachable from formula_7 by a path for which all but the last edge stays within the subtree rooted at formula_7. This is the minimum of the set consisting of the preorder label of formula_7, of the values of formula_13 at child nodes of formula_7 and of the preorder labels of nodes reachable from formula_7 by edges that do not belong to formula_5.
** Similarly, compute formula_17, the highest preorder label reachable by a path for which all but the last edge stays within the subtree rooted at formula_7. This is the maximum of the set consisting of the preorder label of formula_7, of the values of formula_20 at child nodes of formula_7 and of the preorder labels of nodes reachable from formula_7 by edges that do not belong to formula_5.
** For each node formula_24 with parent node formula_7, if formula_26 and formula_27 then the edge from formula_7 to formula_24 is a bridge.

==Bridge-finding with chain decompositions==
A very simple bridge-finding algorithm uses chain decompositions.
Chain decompositions do not only allow to compute all bridges of a graph, they also allow to &quot;read off&quot; every cut vertex of &quot;G&quot; (and the block-cut tree of &quot;G&quot;), giving a general framework for testing 2-edge- and 2-vertex-connectivity (which extends to linear-time 3-edge- and 3-vertex-connectivity tests).

Chain decompositions are special ear decompositions depending on a DFS-tree &quot;T&quot; of &quot;G&quot; and can be computed very simply: Let every vertex be marked as unvisited. For each vertex &quot;v&quot; in ascending DFS-numbers 1...&quot;n&quot;, traverse every backedge (i.e. every edge not in the DFS tree) that is incident to &quot;v&quot; and follow the path of tree-edges back to the root of &quot;T&quot;, stopping at the first vertex that is marked as visited. During such a traversal, every traversed vertex is marked as visited. Thus, a traversal stops at the latest at &quot;v&quot; and forms either a directed path or cycle, beginning with v; we call this path
or cycle a &quot;chain&quot;. The &quot;i&quot;th chain found by this procedure is referred to as &quot;Ci&quot;. &quot;C=C1,C2...&quot; is then a &quot;chain decomposition&quot; of &quot;G&quot;.

The following characterizations then allow to &quot;read off&quot; several properties of &quot;G&quot; from &quot;C&quot; efficiently, including all bridges of &quot;G&quot;. Let &quot;C&quot; be a chain decomposition of a simple connected graph &quot;G=(V,E)&quot;.
# &quot;G&quot; is 2-edge-connected if and only if the chains in &quot;C&quot; partition &quot;E&quot;.
# An edge &quot;e&quot; in &quot;G&quot; is a bridge if and only if &quot;e&quot; is not contained in any chain in &quot;C&quot;.
# If &quot;G&quot; is 2-edge-connected, &quot;C&quot; is an ear decomposition.
# &quot;G&quot; is 2-vertex-connected if and only if &quot;G&quot; has minimum degree 2 and &quot;C1&quot; is the only cycle in &quot;C&quot;.
# A vertex &quot;v&quot; in a 2-edge-connected graph &quot;G&quot; is a cut vertex if and only if &quot;v&quot; is the first vertex of a cycle in &quot;C - C1&quot;.
# If &quot;G&quot; is 2-vertex-connected, &quot;C&quot; is an open ear decomposition.

<doc id="1305075" wikidata="Q4347730" url="?curid=1305075" title="1956 United States Senate elections">
<text>The 1956 United States Senate elections were elections for the United States Senate that coincided with the re-election of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The 32 seats of Class 3 were contested in regular elections, and three special elections were held to fill vacancies. Although Democrats gained two seats in regular elections, the Republicans gained two seats in special elections, leaving the party balance of the chamber unchanged.

Democrats defeated incumbents Herman Welker (R-Idaho), George H. Bender (R-Ohio), and James H. Duff (R-Pennsylvania), as well as winning a Republican-held seat in Colorado. Republicans defeated incumbent Earle C. Clements (D-Kentucky) as well as winning Democratic-held seats in Kentucky, New York, and West Virginia. Thus, this election caused Kentucky&#x27;s Senate delegation to flip from two Democrats to two Republicans.

During the next Congress, Republican John D. Hoblitzell Jr. was appointed to the seat of deceased Senator Matthew M. Neely (D-WV), while Democrat William Proxmire won a special election for the seat of deceased Senator Joseph McCarthy (R-Wisconsin). Also, Democrat Ralph Yarborough won a special election for the seat of Price Daniel (D-Texas), who had resigned from the Senate after being elected Governor of Texas. The net result was to leave the party balance unchanged. Republicans would not win a Senate election in West Virginia again until 2014.

===Kentucky (special)===
Following the death of Alben Barkley on April 30, 1956, Robert Humphreys was appointed June 21, 1956 to continue the term, pending a special election. Humphreys did not run in the special election to finish the term that would end in 1961.

Republican former-senator John Sherman Cooper, who had twice won special elections to that seat in 1946 and 1952, was again elected to finish the term.



This time, however, Cooper would be re-elected in 1960 and again in 1966, serving until his 1973 retirement.

==Maryland==





==Missouri==





==Nevada==





==New Hampshire==





==New York==


In New York, the Republican state convention met on September 10 at Albany, New York, and nominated New York State Attorney General Jacob K. Javits. The Democratic state convention met on September 10 at Albany, New York, and nominated Mayor of New York City Robert F. Wagner Jr., for the U.S. Senate. The Liberal Party endorsed the Democratic nominee, Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr., for the U.S. Senate. On October 1, a movement was launched to vote for General of the Army Douglas MacArthur as a write-in candidate for the U.S. Senate. On October 2, MacArthur disavowed the campaign, and stated that he was not a candidate.

The Republican candidate was elected.




==North Carolina==





==North Dakota==


In North Dakota, the incumbent, Republican Milton Young, sought and received re-election to his third term, defeating North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party candidate Quentin N. Burdick, son of North Dakota congressman Usher L. Burdick.

Only Young filed as a Republican, and the endorsed Democratic candidate was Quentin Burdick, the son of well-known politician Usher Burdick, and former candidate for Governor of North Dakota. Young and Burdick won the primary elections for their respective parties.

One independent candidate, Arthur C. Townley, also filed before the deadline. Townley would later seek the state&#x27;s other senate seat in 1958, and was known for creating the National Non-Partisan League.



==Ohio==





==Oklahoma==





==Oregon==


In Oregon, Republican-turned-Independent-turned-Democrat Wayne Morse decided to seek re-election for his first full term as a Democrat. Morse defeated Republican candidate Douglas McKay in the hotly contested general election.




==Pennsylvania==


In Pennsylvania, incumbent Republican U.S. senator James H. Duff sought re-election to another term, but was defeated by the Democratic nominee, Joseph S. Clark Jr.




==South Carolina==
In South Carolina the regular election was held simultaneously with the special election.

===South Carolina (regular)===

Incumbent Democrat Olin D. Johnston handily defeated Republican mayor of Clemson Leon P. Crawford. Olin D. Johnston, the incumbent Senator, faced no opposition from South Carolina Democrats and avoided a primary election. Leon P. Crawford, the mayor of the town of Clemson in the Upstate, faced no opposition from South Carolina Republicans and avoided a primary election. Crawford campaigned as a defender of states&#x27; rights and denounced Johnston for backing the New Deal and the Fair Deal. The state Republican Party believed that Crawford could have a chance in the election if he galvanized the 128,000 registered black voters, although they were weary of being labeled as the black party. In the end, Johnston remained highly popular with the voters who were still leery of the Republican party and he easily defeated Crawford in the general election.



===South Carolina (special)===

The special election resulted from the resignation of Senator Strom Thurmond on April 4, 1956, who was keeping a campaign pledge he had made in the 1954 election. Thurmond was unopposed in his bid to complete the remaining four years of the term. Senator Strom Thurmond faced no opposition from South Carolina Democrats and avoided a primary election. There was a possibility that Governor George Bell Timmerman Jr. might enter the race, but Thurmond was held in such high regard by the voters that there would have been no chance of defeating Thurmond. With no challenge to the remainder of the term, Thurmond did not conduct a campaign and rejoined his old law firm in Aiken until he returned to the Senate after the general election.



==South Dakota==





==Utah==





==Vermont==


In Vermont, incumbent Republican George Aiken ran successfully for re-election to another term in the United States Senate, defeating Democratic challenger Bernard G. O&#x27;Shea.









==Washington==





==West Virginia (special)==


Following the death of Harley M. Kilgore on February 28, 1956, William Laird III was appointed to fill this seat and assumed office on March 13, 1956. Laird did not opt to run in the special election to fill the remainder of Kilgore&#x27;s term through the end of the 85th Congress on January 3, 1959. This was the last time until 2014 that the Republicans won a U.S. Senate election in the state and the last time until 2024 that they won the Class I seat.


== Wisconsin ==


Incumbent Republican Senator Alexander Wiley easily won reelection to a fourth and final term, defeating the Democratic candidate, Henry W. Maier, by a margin of 17.4%. This would be the last time a Republican would win a Senate race in Wisconsin until Bob Kasten in 1980, and the last time a Republican would win more than 2 terms until Ron Johnson&#x27;s victory in 2022.

<doc id="1305081" wikidata="Q4412076" url="?curid=1305081" title="Jota Quest">
<text>Jota Quest is a Brazilian pop rock band. The band was founded in 1993 in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais as &quot;J. Quest&quot;, but due to trademark issues with Hanna-Barbera, they renamed themselves &quot;Jota Quest&quot; (&quot;jota&quot; being the Portuguese name for the letter &quot;j&quot;). The band members include: Rogério Flausino (vocals), Marco Túlio Lara (guitar), Márcio Buzelin (keyboards), PJ (bass) and Paulinho Fonseca (drums). &quot;Jota Quest&quot; initially stood apart from Minas Gerais&#x27; musical tradition by garnering national success with pop rock and blue-eyed soul-tinged pop. Eventually the band exposed its Clube da Esquina influences, including collaborations with Minas Gerais exponents Paulinho Pedra Azul and Milton Nascimento in Oxigenio as well as jams with 14 Bis and a collaboration with Roberto Carlos over his hit single &quot;Alem do Horizonte&quot;. &quot;Jota Quest&quot; sold over 4,000,000 copies in Brazil, Latin America and Portugal.

==Biography==
The group played their first show as J. Quest inspired by the cartoon Jonny Quest, the idea of bassist PJ. At the time, the group played the bar circuit and schools of Belo Horizonte and gathered more than 2,000 people per show. With this, the band was gaining ground. Next the contract with Sony Music came, and then the first official CD was released in August 1996. The bar band&#x27;s most successful song is their rendition of &quot;As Dores do Mundo&quot;, a huge hit by Bahian soulman Hyldon in the &#x27;70s. It quickly entered the charts, followed by other singles, while the band toured Brazil. On this first tour, the band members came on stage wearing &quot;black power&quot; wigs. Another hit from their first album was &quot;Encontrar Alguém&quot;, a very disco. Even with the success, it took a while for them to get on television. On 11 January 1997, they were invited by the presenter Xuxa to perform at what was then called &quot;Xuxa Hits&quot;, which belonged to Rede Globo television. It was the first performance of Jota Quest on TV.

The band&#x27;s second release was &quot;De Volta ao Planeta&quot;, more conventionally pop rock, spawning more hit singles, especially the signature song &quot;Fácil&quot;. The album&#x27;s title song was &quot;De Volta ao Planeta&quot; with monkey noises backgrounding its chorus. The album became a Brazilian best-seller. This tour was marked for the first Brazilian Solar Energy supplied live show, a project with Greenpeace. In 2009, the title track of the album was used in the hugely successful telenovela &quot;Caras &amp; Bocas&quot;, resulting in the song receiving moderate airplay on Brazilian radio and a short stay on the national charts.

A relative commercial failure, due to the band&#x27;s previous sales figures, their association with an Internet provider as well as advertising for Fanta. The band tried a new direction on its third record, an ecological oriented and experimental release called &quot;Oxigênio&quot;. It moved away from the dance floor, with increased production values, experimental songwriting and sponsored by the greatest Coca-Cola marketing campaign in Latin America. The Brazilian Grammy winner singer Milton Nascimento recorded with the band on this album the song &quot;Destes Tantos Modos&quot;. Although the album went Platinum it is largely considered a hodgepodge.

In 2001, they returned to their original formula with bass guitar grooves, funk rock guitar riffs and beautiful lyrics with Discotecagem Pop Variada, their fourth album. Jota Quest recapped the bar band feeling with hits like &quot;Na Moral&quot; and the ballad &quot;Só Hoje&quot;. In 2002, Rogério Flausino was invited by Disney to sing the Brazilian version of the Treasure Planet&#x27;s soundtrack. The song is called Estou Aqui. With the success of the last record, the Jota Quest recorded on days 1 and 2 May 2003, the CD/DVD &quot;MTV ao Vivo: Jota Quest&quot; at the Praça do Papa, in Belo Horizonte, broadcast by MTV Brasil. First live record of the group, gathered the biggest hits of the band and also had the special participation of Arnaldo Antunes and Thaíde. In the same year, they were the only ones in Latin America to be invited to participate in the soundtrack of the movie Spider-Man 2, that also had a version for the cartoon. The lyrics were made by Rogério Flausino.

Ten years after launching the first CD, the band was consolidated in the Brazilian pop rock&#x27;s scenario. Altogether there were five CDs, thousands of shows and attendance records all over Brazil, presentations in the U.S. and recently in Europe, where they attended the opening of the &quot;Rock in Rio Lisboa&quot;, sharing the stage with Carlos Santana and Roger Waters. After four years without releasing a CD with new material, the group got isolated in his studio in Belo Horizonte to record the album &quot;Até Onde Vai&quot;, which arrived at the stores in October 2005, and since then, remains between the country&#x27;s best-selling CDs. The album fused rock and funk elements and contained their cover version of Brazilian singer Roberto Carlos&#x27;s &quot;Além do Horizonte&quot; which became a major hit. The album produced a further string of hit singles, all receiving heavy rotation on Brazilian radio stations, including: &quot;O Sol&quot;, &quot;Palavras de Um Futuro Bom&quot; at the tail-end of 2006, and most recently &quot;Já Foi&quot; in the first half of 2007. This album was a 7th Annual Latin Grammy nominated. Lead singer Rogerio Flausino was also invited to sing in English on electronic dance act Layo and Bushwacka&#x27;s 2006 album. In 2007, Rogério Flausino received the Multishow Award for being the best singer in Brazil. In the same year on 13 August, he became a father, having her first daughter, Nina. The &quot;Até Onde Vai&quot; toure were the longest one of Jota Quest.

In 2008, the band released the album La Plata, recorded in the studio Minério de Ferro, three years after their last record. The CD quickly became successful on the radio with the songs &quot;La Plata&quot;, which was on the soundtrack of TV Globo&#x27;s soap opera &quot;Cama de Gato&quot;, and the ballad &quot;Vem Andar Comigo&quot;, very well played, and theme of the Soap Opera &quot;Caras e Bocas&quot;,

In late July, the third single &quot;Seis e Trinta&quot; was released on the radio and the music video came out in September. At the end of November 2009 the ballad &quot;Único Olhar&quot; was released, the seventh track of La Plata. In 2010 &quot;Tudo Me Faz Lembar Você&quot; was also released as the soundtrack of the film &quot;Muita Calma Nessa Hora&quot;.

<text>Agnes of Babenberg (; 1108/13 – 24/25 January 1163) was a scion of the Franconian House of Babenberg and by marriage High Duchess of Poland and Duchess of Silesia.

==Family and personality==

Agnes was a daughter of Leopold III, Margrave of Austria, and Agnes, daughter of Emperor Henry IV.
Through her mother, Agnes was a descendant of the Salian dynasty, which ruled the Holy Roman Empire since 1024 until her maternal uncle, Emperor Henry V, died without issue in 1125. She was the half-sister of Duke Frederick II of Swabia and King Conrad III of Germany, both born from her mother&#x27;s first marriage with Duke Frederick I of Swabia. Of her full siblings, one sister, Judith, married Marquess William V of Montferrat, and one brother was Bishop Otto of Freising, a renowned medieval chronicler.

According to Wincenty Kadłubek, Polish chronicler and bishop of Kraków (and this opinion is shared by other sources), Agnes was a very ambitious, energetic woman, and proud of her origins. It is no wonder the bishop called her &quot;Tigress&quot; in his &quot;Chronica Polonorum&quot;.

==Marriage==
The ruler of Poland, Duke Bolesław Wrymouth, in order to hold his ground against the Empire wanted to obtain a powerful ally against King Lothair III of Germany. He therefore forged an alliance with the Babenbergs and the Hohenstaufen families, who, as relatives of the extinct Salian dynasty, were the natural rivals of Lothair. In order to seal this alliance, a marriage between Bolesław III&#x27;s eldest son Władysław and Agnes was agreed. The wedding took place around 1125; according to some historians, the couple had already received the Duchy of Silesia from Bolesław III as a gift.

==High Duchess of Poland==
Bolesław III died on 28 October 1138. In his will, he divided Poland between his sons. As the oldest son, the supreme authority in the country was assigned to Władysław II with the title of high duke (&quot;princeps&quot;). In addition to Silesia, he received the Seniorate Province (which included Lesser Poland, eastern Greater Poland and western Kuyavia) and the authority over Pomerania. His half-brothers Boleslaw IV, Mieszko III and Henry received hereditary fiefs as junior dukes. In addition, Władysław II would also receive the lands of Łęczyca, then granted by Bolesław III to his widow, Salomea of Berg, for life as her dower and to revert to the Seniorate Province upon her death.

Almost immediately, the high duke began his efforts to unify the country under his rule. Wincenty Kadłubek stated that the confrontation between Władysław II and his half-brothers was mainly instigated by Agnes, who believed that her husband, as the eldest son, had the right to be the sole ruler of the whole country.

In order to strengthen the authority of the high duke, it is believed that Agnes took part in the downfall of one of the most powerful nobles in the country, the voivode Piotr Włostowic, who supported the junior dukes. According to a legend, the capture of Włostowic was thanks to Agnes, because she sent her own retainers to his castle and they captured him during the night. This event was recorded in German contemporary historiography; however, since this story is not confirmed, it not generally accepted by modern historians. Agnes demanded Włostowic&#x27;s death, but her husband decided instead to make an example of him. Włostowic was blinded, muted and sentenced to exile.

==Deposition and exile==
The tyrannical rule of Władysław II and Agnes led to many of their subjects switching their allegiance to the junior dukes. In early 1146 the high duke&#x27;s forces were finally defeated near Poznań. Władysław II escaped to Bohemia, while Agnes and her children remained in Kraków, where for some time they maintained resistance against the junior dukes from the Wawel Castle. However, the attempts to defend the city were unsuccessful and, in the end, the whole family was reunited in exile.

After a short time at the Bohemian court of Duke Vladislaus II, Agnes&#x27; half-brother, King Conrad III of Germany, offered his hospitality to the Polish ducal family, who settled at the &quot;Kaiserpfalz&quot; of Altenburg. At first, it seemed that Władysław II would soon regain power in Poland. A German expedition against the junior dukes was launched in 1146, but due to flooding of the Oder River and the pressures on the German king by the margraves Albert the Bear and Conrad of Meissen, the campaign failed.

The failure of the expedition did not discourage Agnes, who continued with her attempts to restore her husband. She asked for the intervention of Pope Eugenius III, who decided to raise the question in the 1148 Council of Reims, and sent his legate Guy to Poland to obtain the submission of the junior dukes. However, they refused to accept the return of Władysław II, and the pope declared a ban over Poland. The pope&#x27;s actions had few repercussions thanks for the united support of the Polish church hierarchy for the junior dukes.

In 1152 King Conrad III died and was succeeded by his nephew Frederick Barbarossa. With the accession of this energetic ruler, the hopes of Agnes and Władysław II of returning to Poland were rekindled. With the encouragement of his aunt, the new German king launched an expedition against Poland in 1157. The campaign was a success but unexpectedly Barbarossa did not restore Władysław II to the Polish throne. Instead High Duke Bolesław IV was declared a vassal of Emperor Frederick and was compelled to pay tribute to him. In compensation to Władysław II, he forced Bolesław to promise the restitution of the Silesian duchy to Władysław&#x27;s sons.

==Death and aftermaths==
Both Agnes and Władysław II knew that their battle was finally lost. They remained in Altenburg, where Władysław II died on 30 May 1159. Agnes&#x27; day of death is generally placed by sources between 24 and 25 January, but the year remained disputed among historians and sources. Certainly she survived her husband, and it is known that she did not return to Silesia with her sons when they were finally restored in their heritage in 1163. Thus, it is believed that Agnes died between 1160 and 1163. She was buried in the Cistercian abbey of Pforta near Naumburg on the Saale river.

==Children==
Agnes and Wladyslaw had the following children:

#Bolesław I the Tall (1127 – 8 December 1201).
#Mieszko I Tanglefoot (1131 – 16 May 1211).
#Richeza (1140 – 16 June 1185), married firstly in 1152 to Alfonso VII, King of Galicia, Castile and León, secondly in 1162 to Ramon Berenguer II, Count of Provence and thirdly by 1167 to Count Albert III of Everstein.
#Konrad Spindleshanks (1146/57 – 17 January 1180/90).

<doc id="1305094" wikidata="Q248378" url="?curid=1305094" title="Kaçanik">
<text>Kaçanik () or Kačanik (, ), is a town and municipality located in the Ferizaj District of southern Kosovo. According to the 2024 census, the town of Kaçanik has approximately 10,000, while the municipality has 27,742 inhabitants.

The municipality covers an area of , including the town of Kaçanik and 31 villages.

==Name==
The founder of the town Koxha Sinan Pasha called the town &quot;Kaçaniku.&quot; 

In 1660, Ottoman writer and traveller Evliya Çelebi visited Kosovo and wrote that the town&#x27;s name derived from the Ottoman Turkish word &quot;kaçanlar&quot; in reference to a group of Albanian bandits that operated in Üsküb and used the region of Kaçanik as a hideout.

==History==
===Early history===
The region of Kaçanik was one of the pathways, which were employed during Central European (akin to the Lusatian culture) migrations in the southern Balkans between 1200 and 1150 BCE. Roman era monuments include an altar that dates to 158–9 CE and is dedicated to a deity named &quot;Andinus&quot; (&quot;Deo Andino&quot;). The name &quot;Andinus&quot; appears among the central Illyrian and Dalmatian names, but the worship of &quot;Andinus&quot; seems to have been a local cult of southwestern Dardani as it doesn&#x27;t appear in other parts of Illyria or the Roman Empire.

===Middle Ages===
After 9th century part of kingdom Raška and empire Serbia. Kaçanik was captured by the Ottomans in the 1420s. At that time Kaçanik was only a village registered by the Ottomans in 1455 defter as nahiyah.

Kaçanik was founded by Koca Sinan Pasha, who erected a tower, the town mosque which exists even today, a public kitchen for the poor (&quot;imaret&quot;), a school near the mosque, two &quot;hane&quot; (inns similar to &quot;caravanserais&quot;), one Turkish bath (&quot;hammam&quot;), the town fortress called Llanishta Fortress and a few mills on the Lepenci river.

Kaçanik became known administratively as a town by the end of the 16th century, and up to year 1891 it was a part of the Ottoman Sanjak of Üsküb, which again belonged to the Kosovo Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire.

===Modern===
On January 2, 1690 Albanian insurgents participated in a battle on the side of the Austrian forces fought against the Ottomans at the Valley of Kaçanik.

In 1878, Kaçanik was intended to become a part of the Principality of Bulgaria according to the Treaty of San Stefano, but per the Treaty of Berlin it was returned to the Ottomans.

During the Albanian Revolt of 1910, the area of Kacanik was the battlefield between Ottoman and Albanian forces.

After 1912 the town became part of the Kingdom of Serbia, and after 1918 part of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (the first incarnation of Yugoslavia). From 1929 to 1941 Kaçanik was part of the Vardar Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

During World War II, from 1941 to 1945, the town became part of the Kingdom of Bulgaria.

In 1990, after the suspension of Kosovo&#x27;s autonomy, the members of the Kosovan assembly gathered in the town and adopted the &quot;Kaçanik Constitution&quot;, based on which the Republic of Kosova was proclaimed in 1991.

During the Kosovo War, Yugoslav forces including the army, police and paramilitary groups carried out operations in the town that led to high numbers of civilian casualties and mass flights of civilians from Kaçanik.

==Demographics==
According to the last official census done in 2011, the municipality of Kaçanik has 33,409 inhabitants. Based on the population estimates from the Kosovo Agency of Statistics in 2020, the municipality has 34,420 inhabitants.

With the exception of eight Roma and 30 Bosniaks, the municipality is ethnically homogeneous Albanian.

==Economy==
The municipality is known for the production of construction materials at several area companies. There are also many cultivated farmlands and areas suited for the development of farms, apiculture, arboriculture as well as various craftsman and artisans. The area is well suited for the development of winter and summer tourism. The downtown area is home to a bus station, a small radio station, the remains of a Turkish fort, several streets lined with shops, banks, several restaurants, and a weekly farmers market for produce, livestock and housewares.

Kaçanik has an old tradition in private manufactures, especially when it comes to the production of calcareous stone, wood for construction purposes and other services and artisan skills.

<text>Brazil&#x27;s Legal Amazon (abbreviation BLA), in Portuguese Amazônia Legal (), is the largest socio-geographic division in Brazil, containing all nine states in the Amazon basin. The government designated this region in 1948 based on its studies on how to plan the economic and social development of the Amazon region.

== Area ==
The official designation Amazônia Legal encompasses all seven brazilian states of the North Region (Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima and Tocantins), as well as most of Mato Grosso in the Center-West Region and the western part of Maranhão in the Northeast Region. Amazônia Legal is a 5,016,136.3 km2 region with around 24 million inhabitants; in other words 59% of the geographic territory of Brazil is part of Amazônia Legal, but only 12.34% of the Brazilian population lives there. The administrative unit was initially established by Federal Law No. 5.173 (Art. 2). 

Although called &quot;Amazônia Legal,&quot; the region overlaps three different biomes: all of Brazil&#x27;s Amazon biome, 37% of the Cerrado biome, and 40% of the Pantanal biome. The main characteristic of the region is the abundant and tropical vegetation, including large sections of rainforest.

The Legal Amazon is divided into two parts: Western Amazon (Amazônia Ocidental, in portuguese) and Eastern Amazon (Amazônia Oriental, in portuguese).

Amazônia Ocidental comprises the states of: Acre, Amazonas, Roraima and, Rondônia.

Amazônia Oriental comprises the states of: Pará, Maranhão, Amapá, Tocantins and, Mato Grosso.

== Subdivisions ==

=== The western region ===
The western region corresponding to 44.54% of the territorial extension of the Legal Amazon (72% of the Amazon Forest), most preserved part. It is made up of the brazilian states of: Amazonas, Acre, Rondônia and, Roraima. The economy of region is based on: agroindustry, fish farming, livestock farming, food industry, plant and mineral extraction, agriculture and ecotourism, in which economy and sustainability go hand in hand.

=== The eastern region ===
The western region is made up of the brazilian states of: Pará, Maranhão, Amapá, Tocantins and, Mato Grosso. This is also formed by 20% of the cerrado biome and part of the pantanal. Its population is 12.4% of the national population (21,056,532 inhabitants).

== Demographics ==
A total population of 24.7 million inhabitants lives in the area, including more than 300,000 indigenous people belonging to more than 170 ethnicities. Among these are many traditional extractive communities.

Because of its remoteness, this region was the last to be colonized by Brazilians of European descent. It still has a very low population density.

<doc id="1305110" wikidata="Q4703903" url="?curid=1305110" title="Al Gore 1988 presidential campaign">
<text>The 1988 presidential campaign of [[Al Gore]], U.S. Senator of Tennessee and former House Representative began on April 11, 1987. He campaigned for President of the United States as a Democratic candidate in the 1988 presidential election, against Democratic candidates Joe Biden, Dick Gephardt, Paul Simon, Jesse Jackson, and Michael Dukakis (who eventually won the Democratic nomination). 

Age 39 at the time, Gore was described as the first serious young presidential candidate since John F. Kennedy in 1960. He was characterized as a political centrist aligned with many other Southern Democrats. Despite eventual defeat, Gore, who came in a third place, was one of the front-runners that year. Al Gore, at that time, represented the Southern Democrats and some of the Conservative Democrats in 1980s.

==Announcement==
On April 11, 1987, Senator Gore of Tennessee announced his candidacy. He stated that he believed he could offer, &quot;clearer goals&quot; than the other candidates.

Gore was further described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as: 

At the time of the announcement, Senator Gore was 39 years old, making him the &quot;youngest serious Presidential candidate since John F. Kennedy.&quot;

==Campaign==

=== Political views ===
According to CNN, Gore ran his campaign as, &quot;a Southern centrist, [who] opposed federal funding for abortion. He favored a moment of silence for prayer in the schools and voted against banning the interstate sale of handguns.&quot; He positioned himself as a centrist alternative to fellow leading candidates Jesse Jackson and eventual primary winner Michael Dukakis. Gore stated that he made numerous speeches concerning global warming and the greenhouse effect on the campaign trail that received minimal media attention.

=== Campaign developments ===

CNN notes that &quot;in 1988, for the first time, 12 Southern states would hold their primaries on the same day, Super Tuesday.&quot; As the only other Southern candidate, Gore chose to criticize Jesse Jackson often. Gore began to criticize Jackson for his Middle East policies. In particular, &quot;Albert Gore Jr. assailed Mr. Jackson&#x27;s foreign policy views and said he was &#x27;dismayed&#x27; by Mr. Jackson&#x27;s &#x27;embrace of Arafat and Castro&#x27;.&quot; Jackson responded by stating that, &quot;The issue is not whether the Israelis and Palestinians are moral equivalents. Both of them are human beings and both are trapped in the cycle of death and pain. And they are trapped in the cycle of mutual annihilation. I wanted to offer leadership that will move from mutual annihilation to coexistence to break the cycle of death.&quot; 

Gore was heavily criticized for his attacks against both Jackson and Dukakis. Jackson also retracted some of his previous statements. It was Gore who first mentioned the Massachusetts furlough program Dukakis had supported as Governor by asking him questions in a debate right before the 1988 New York primary, about &quot;weekend passes for convicted criminals&quot;; this later developed into the Willie Horton pro-George H. W. Bush attack ad. However, unlike commonly believed, Gore did not mention Horton by name.

During the Democratic debate, Gore argued that his foreign policy platform was different from his rivals, but they disagreed. &quot;&#x27;I reject Gore&#x27;s efforts to try to pin labels,&#x27; Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri told reporters after the event.&quot;

Jackson defeated Gore in the South Carolina Primary, winning, &quot;more than half the total vote, three times that of his closest rival here, Senator Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee.&quot; Gore next placed great hope on Super Tuesday where they split the Southern vote: Jackson winning Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Virginia; Gore winning Arkansas, North Carolina, Kentucky, Nevada, Tennessee, and Oklahoma.

==Dropping out==
The Gore campaign came to a close after Dukakis won the New York primary with 51% of the vote, followed by Jackson at 37%, and Gore only received 10%. &quot;The New York Times&quot; argued that he lost support due to his attacks against Jackson, Dukakis, and others, as well as for his endorsement by Koch.

Gore was eventually able to mend fences with Jesse Jackson, who supported the Clinton-Gore ticket in 1992 and 1996, and who also campaigned for the Gore-Lieberman ticket during the 2000 presidential election. According to some, Gore&#x27;s policies had changed in 2000, reflecting his eight years as Vice President.

==Statewide contests won==

South: Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, Arkansas, Oklahoma

Outside the South: Nevada, Wyoming

==Popular vote position==
*Dukakis - 9,898,750 (42.51%)
*Jackson - 6,788,991 (29.15%)
*Gore - 3,185,806 (13.68%)
*Gephardt - 1,399,041 (6.01%)
*Simon - 1,082,960 (4.65%)

==Endorsements==

47th Texas Governor, Republican Rick Perry, who at the time was a Democrat in the Texas State House, campaigned for Gore during the primaries.

Gore was later endorsed by New York Mayor Ed Koch, who made statements in favor of Israel and against Jackson. These statements further cast Gore in a negative light. The endorsement led voters away from Gore who only received 10% of the vote in the New York Primary.

<text>The Old World rats and mice, part of the subfamily Murinae in the family Muridae, comprise at least 519 species. Members of this subfamily are called murines. In terms of species richness, this subfamily is larger than all mammal families except the Cricetidae and Muridae, and is larger than all mammal orders except the bats and the remainder of the rodents.

==Description==
The Murinae are native to Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia. They are terrestrial placental mammals. They have also been introduced to all continents except Antarctica, and are serious pest animals. This is particularly true in island communities where they have contributed to the endangerment and extinction of many native animals.

Two prominent murine species have become vital laboratory animals: the brown rat and house mouse are both used as medical subjects.

The murines have a distinctive molar pattern that involves three rows of cusps instead of two, the primitive pattern seen most frequently in muroid rodents.

==Fossils==
The first known appearance of the Murinae in the fossil record is about 14 million years ago with the fossil genus &quot;Antemus&quot;. &quot;Antemus&quot; is thought to derive directly from &quot;Potwarmus&quot;, which has a more primitive tooth pattern. Likewise, two genera, &quot;Progonomys&quot; and &quot;Karnimata&quot;, are thought to derive directly from &quot;Antemus&quot;. &quot;Progonomys&quot; is thought to be the ancestor of &quot;Mus&quot; and relatives, while &quot;Karnimata&quot; was previously thought to lead to &quot;Rattus&quot; and relatives, although it is now thought to be a member of the extant tribe Praomyini. All of these fossils are found in the well-preserved and easily dated Siwalik fossil beds of Pakistan. The transition from &quot;Potwarmus&quot; to &quot;Antemus&quot; to &quot;Progonomys&quot; and &quot;Karnimata&quot; is considered an excellent example of anagenic evolution.

==Taxonomy==
Most of the Murinae have been poorly studied. Some genera have been grouped, such as the hydromyine water rats, conilurine or pseudomyine Australian mice, or the phloeomyine Southeast Asian forms. It appears as if genera from Southeast Asian islands and Australia may be early offshoots compared to mainland forms. The vlei rats in the genera &quot;Otomys&quot; and &quot;Parotomys&quot; are often placed in a separate subfamily, Otomyinae, but have been shown to be closely related to African murines in spite of their uniqueness.

Three genera, &quot;Uranomys&quot;, &quot;Lophuromys&quot;, and &quot;Acomys&quot;, were once considered to be murines, but were found to be more closely related to gerbils through molecular phylogenetics. They have been assigned a new subfamily status, Deomyinae.

Molecular phylogenetic studies of Murinae include Lecompte, et al. (2008), which analyzes African murine species based on the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and two nuclear gene fragments. Lecompte, et al. (2008) estimates that African murines colonized Africa from Asia approximately 11 million years ago during the Miocene.

The following phylogeny of 16 Murinae genera, based on molecular phylogenetic analysis of the Interphotoreceptor Retinoid Binding Protein (IRBP) gene, is from Jansa &amp; Weksler (2004: 264).
==Distribution==
The following is a list of Murinae genus divisions ordered by the continents that they are endemic to. Most of the diversity is located in Southeast Asia and Australasia.

*Africa
**Aethomys division – 1 genus
**Arvicanthis division – 6 genera
**Colomys division – 3 genera
**Dasymys division – 8 genera
**Hybomys division – 3 genera
**Malacomys division – 1 genus
**Oenomys division – 5 genea
**Otomyini division/tribe – 3 genera
*Eurasia
**Apodemus division – 2 genera
**Micromys division – 6 genera
**Genus &quot;Mus&quot;
*South Asia

**Pogonomys division – 11 genera
**Uromys division – 5 genera
**Xeromys division – 3 genera
**Genus &quot;Mirzamys&quot;
*Australia
**Pseudomys division – 8 genera

==List of species==
As of 2005, the Murinae contained 129 genera in 584 species. Musser and Carleton (2005) divided the Murinae into 29 genus divisions. They treated the Otomyinae as a separate subfamily, but all molecular analyses conducted to date have supported their inclusion in the Murinae as relatives of African genera. In a recent expedition in the Philippines, seven more &quot;Apomys&quot; mice were added and the genus was proposed to split into two subgenera - &quot;Apomys&quot; and &quot;Megapomys&quot;, based on morphological and cytochrome b DNA sequences. In 2021, a major revision was taken of Praomyini.

The tribes are based on the classification by the American Society of Mammalogists. Some of the division placement is based on Pages &quot;et al&quot;., 2015 and Rowe &quot;et al&quot;., 2019.

<text>Françoise David (; born January 13, 1948) is a former spokesperson of Québec solidaire – a left-wing, feminist, and sovereigntist political party in the province of Quebec, Canada. She was elected to serve as the Member of the National Assembly of Quebec for the riding of Gouin in the 2012 Quebec election, and then again in the 2014 Quebec election. Quebec Solidaire was born from the merger of Option Citoyenne with l&#x27;Union des Forces Progressistes. She is the author of the book/manifesto &quot;Bien commun recherché – une option citoyenne&quot; (over 7,000 copies sold in Quebec) which attempts to combine the concepts of &quot;common good&quot;, social justice, ecology and economic democracy into a coherent political doctrine. On January 19, 2017, Françoise David announced her immediate retirement as both party spokesperson and as a Member of the National Assembly due to her health.

==Biography==
In 1987, Françoise David became coordinator for the &quot;Regroupement des centres de femmes du Québec&quot;. Seven years later, she was named president of the &quot;Fédération des femmes du Québec&quot; (FFQ). In this capacity, she ensured that women&#x27;s issues, including poverty and violence against women, remained at the forefront in Canada. She was president of the FFQ from 1994 to 2001.

She is the daughter of cardiologist and Progressive Conservative Senator Paul David. Her grandfather Athanase David was a Liberal Senator. She is also the sister of political science professor and director of Raoul-Dandurand Chair, Charles-Philippe David.

Two of her best-recognised public successes have been the 1995 Women&#x27;s March against Poverty and the 2000 World March of Women against Poverty and Violence.

In addition to her work experience, Françoise David is a member of numerous community organizations. In January 2000, she participated in the non-governmental observation mission to Iraq, and in December 2001 she traveled to Mali with the Canadian University Service Overseas.

In 1999, she was made a Knight of the National Order of Quebec. In 2002, she was awarded the Governor General&#x27;s Award in Commemoration of the Persons Case.

David ran in the riding of Gouin in central Montreal in the 2007 Quebec election, finishing second to the PQ incumbent Nicolas Girard. David received 7913 votes, amounting to 26% of the vote in her riding, behind Girard&#x27;s 11,318 votes (37%). Quebec Solidaire received 3.7% of the vote provincewide.

David ran in Gouin a second time in the 2008 Quebec election, receiving 7987 votes, or approximately 32% of the total, but again losing out to Girard, who received 10,276 votes (41%). Quebec Solidaire received 3.8% of the vote provincewide and David&#x27;s co-leader Amir Khadir won the party&#x27;s first seat in the National Assembly of Quebec in the neighbouring riding of Mercier.

In the 2012 Quebec election, David was elected for the first time. She was re-elected in 2014, her party winning the most seats in its history.

Her younger sister, Hélène David, was elected as a Liberal MNA for the provincial riding of Outremont in the 2014 Quebec election. David holds a PhD in psychology and since 1984 she was an instructor and vice-rector at the University. From 2008 to 2010 she was Assistant Deputy Minister for higher education in the Quebec Ministry of Education, Recreation &amp; Sport under Premier Jean Charest. When asked if her sister Françoise tried to persuade her to join Québec solidaire, Hélène said that the two have &quot;known for a long time that we&#x27;re not necessarily from the same political family.&quot; Unlike Françoise, Hélène is a federalist.

Françoise David is married to François Larose, with whom she had one child.

<text>The Ursid (URS) meteor activity begins annually around December 17 and runs for over a week, until the 25th or 26th. This meteor shower is named for its radiant point, which is located near the star Beta Ursae Minoris (Kochab) in the constellation Ursa Minor.

== History ==
The Ursids were probably discovered by William F. Denning, who observed them for several years around the start of the 20th century. While there were sporadic observations after, the first coordinated studies of the shower didn&#x27;t begin until Dr. A. Bečvář observed an outburst of 169 per hour in 1945. Further observations in the 1970s and ongoing to current have established a relationship with comet 8P/Tuttle. Peter Jenniskens and Esko Lyytinen discovered that outbursts could happen when comet Tuttle was at aphelion because some meteoroids get trapped in the 7/6 orbital resonance with Jupiter.

== Technical information==
Earlier observations described an average radiant of RA=, DEC=, with maximum occurring at a solar longitude of 270.66 deg (about December 22), with the duration being established as December 17–24.

The Ursids have a particularly narrow stream, prompting veteran meteor observer, Norman W. McLeod, III (Florida) to comment that the Ursids &quot;must be a compact stream like the Quadrantids. You have to be within 12 hours of maximum to see much.&quot;

<text>P. F. Chang&#x27;s China Bistro is an American-based, casual dining restaurant chain founded in 1993 by Paul Fleming and Philip Chiang that serves Asian fusion cuisine. Centerbridge Partners owned and operated Chang&#x27;s until acquired by the private equity firm TriArtisan Capital Advisors on March 2, 2019. P. F. Chang&#x27;s is headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona.

The chain specializes in American Chinese cuisine, plus other Asian dishes. P.F. Chang’s operates 300 locations in 22 countries and U.S. airports, including P.F. Chang’s To Go takeout locations.

The name &quot;P. F. Chang&#x27;s&quot; is derived from those of Paul Fleming (P. F.) and Philip Chiang (whose surname was simplified to &quot;Chang&quot;).

==History==
The chain was founded in 1993 by Paul Fleming and Philip Chiang - son of restaurateur Cecilia Chiang. The first restaurant was opened at the Scottsdale Fashion Square in Scottsdale, Arizona. In 1993, P.F. Chang&#x27;s China Bistro, Inc. was formed from the acquisition of the original four bistro restaurants.

In 2010, P.F. Chang&#x27;s Home Menu was introduced in supermarkets. The brand represents a group of frozen appetizers and meals that were sold under license by Unilever.

In 2012 Chang&#x27;s accepted an offer from private investment firm, Centerbridge Partners in a deal valued at $1.1 billion.

ConAgra Foods, Inc. acquired the P.F. Chang&#x27;s Home Menu license from Unilever in August 2012.

In 2015, P.F. Chang&#x27;s filed for bankruptcy for its Canadian division.

In December 2017, Chang&#x27;s announced that they would open a location in Shanghai during the first part of 2018, Chang&#x27;s first location in China. There were Chinese people who came to the restaurant after learning about it on the U.S. television show &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;. The Shanghai location is marketed to local Chinese customers as American food, and has 10 menu items unique to the company&#x27;s China operations. Additionally, as of 2018 P.F. Chang&#x27;s operates a restaurant in South Korea.

In January 2019, Chang&#x27;s announced it was in talks to be sold to TriArtisan Capital Partners and Paulson &amp; Co. for approximately $700 million from its previous owner, Centerbridge Partners.

In January 2020, Chang’s announced its first P.F. Chang’s To Go take-out only location would be in Chicago, Illinois. 

Chang&#x27;s obtained more than $5 million in small-business loans as part of the Paycheck Protection Program (coronavirus relief).

===2004 restatement===
On March 15, 2004, Chang&#x27;s reported that it had modified its partnership accounting, which resulted in a restatement of its financial results for prior years. On March 17, 2005, the company adjusted its accounting for leases in order to conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, management and the audit committee determined that the company&#x27;s previously issued consolidated financial statements, including those in the company&#x27;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2003, and those in the company&#x27;s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the first three fiscal quarters of 2004, should no longer be relied upon.

===2013–14 credit card breach===
In mid-2014, P.F. Chang&#x27;s confirmed that a breach had occurred targeting credit and debit cards used at their restaurants. The breach was initially identified by Brian Krebs, a cybersecurity journalist.

==Menu==
The chain specializes in Asian fusion cuisine. Special items on their menu include their Chang&#x27;s Lettuce Wraps, Chang&#x27;s Spicy Chicken, Peking duck, and various types of sushi. Wine, specialty drinks, Asian beers, sake, cappuccino, and espresso are available outside standard beverage offerings.

<text>The agreste (, &quot;countryside&quot;) is a narrow zone of Brazil in the states of Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe and Bahia between the coastal forest &quot;zona da mata&quot; and the semiarid &quot;sertão&quot;. The agreste fades out after it reaches Rio Grande do Norte due to the break of the mountain-chain that blocks air currents from the Atlantic ocean. This barrier is what induces high rainfalls in the coastal Atlantic forest zone.

Most of the agreste is hilly, its hills becoming higher at south, except near the narrow valley of São Francisco River. This land is mostly used for mixed farming, prevailing fruits, of which melons have especial importance. Like the sertão, the agreste is frequently affected by drought, though generally with less severe effects. Only some highland regions mostly in Pernambuco, where cities like Garanhuns and Triunfo are located, are able to reach temperatures below 10 degrees Celsius for a part of the year, usually coinciding with the south-American winter.

==Climate==
The climate is hot and sub-humid, with rainfall in the area&#x27;s principal city of Campina Grande averaging about 700 millimetres per year - ranging from less than 10 millimetres in October and November to about 120 millimetres in May and June.

<text>Infante (, ; f. infanta), also anglicised as &quot;infant&quot; or translated as &quot;prince&quot;, is the title and rank given in the Iberian kingdoms of Spain (including the predecessor kingdoms of Aragon, Castile, Navarre, and León) and Portugal to the sons and daughters (&quot;infantas&quot;) of the king, regardless of age, sometimes with the exception of the heir apparent or heir presumptive to the throne who usually bears a unique princely or ducal title. A woman married to a male &quot;infante&quot; was accorded the title of &quot;infanta&quot; if the marriage was dynastically approved (e.g., Princess Alicia of Bourbon-Parma), although since 1987 this is no longer automatically the case in Spain (e.g., Princess Anne d&#x27;Orléans). Husbands of born &quot;infantas&quot; did not obtain the title of &quot;infante&quot; through marriage (unlike most hereditary titles of Spanish nobility), although they were occasionally elevated to the title &quot;de gracia&quot; (&quot;by grace&quot;) at the sovereign&#x27;s command.

While the title belonged by right to all sons and daughters of a monarch (even when they ceased to be children of the reigning sovereign), it was also often accorded to sons-in-law and male-line grandchildren of the sovereign (e.g., Prince Ferdinand of Bavaria, Infante Pedro Carlos of Spain and Portugal), sometimes to other agnates of the ruling dynasty (e.g., Infante Enrique, Duke of Seville), and to female-line relatives of the monarch (e.g. Infante Sebastian of Portugal and Spain, Infante Alfonso de Orléans-Borbón).

==History==
Although the title is derived from the same root as &quot;infant&quot;, in Romance languages the term may be more broadly interpreted to mean &quot;child&quot; (cf. French &quot;enfants de France&quot;), and historically indicated that the &quot;infante&quot; or &quot;infanta&quot; was the child of the nation&#x27;s monarch.

Like the &quot;enfants de France&quot;, all &quot;infantes&quot; in the various Iberian kingdoms were princes of the blood royal, although since 1987 the Spanish sovereign may also confer the title &quot;infantado&quot; by decree upon a person (typically the spouse of an &quot;infante&quot; or &quot;infanta&quot;) who is not of royal descent.

==Spanish infantes==

In the Spanish royal family, the dynastic children of the monarch and of the heir apparent are entitled to the designation and rank of &quot;infante&quot; with the style of Royal Highness (&quot;infantes by birth&quot;). A second category of &quot;infantes&quot; may be granted that title by royal decree (&quot;infantes by grace&quot;), but only bear the style of Highness. Previously, the title and rank of &quot;infante of Spain&quot; was often granted to relatives and in-laws of Spain&#x27;s monarchs, but unlike those created under the 1987 decree, their dynastic wives were automatically &quot;infantas&quot; and bearers of the title were &quot;Royal Highnesses&quot;.

In addition, some distant relatives of Spanish sovereigns, usually children of &quot;infantes by grace&quot;, were accorded the &quot;honours and treatment&quot; of &quot;infante&quot; or &quot;infanta&quot;, but were not granted the title itself, Included in this category were the children of Infante Carlos de Borbón-Dos Sicilias&#x27; second marriage to Princess Louise d&#x27;Orléans, those of Infante Fernando de Bavaria y Borbón&#x27;s marriage with Infanta Maria Teresa of Spain, and those of Infante Alfonso de Orléans-Borbón&#x27;s marriage to Princess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (e.g., Princess María de las Mercedes of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Countess of Barcelona, Prince Alvaro de Orléans-Borbón, Duke di Galliera).

===Current infantes of Spain===
The current infantes of Spain are (by precedence):
*Infanta Sofía (daughter of King Felipe VI and Queen consort Letizia, younger sister of Leonor, Princess of Asturias, the heir presumptive);
*Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo (elder daughter of former King Juan Carlos I and former Queen consort Sofía);
*Infanta Cristina, former (stripped in 2015) Duchess of Palma (younger sister of above);
*Infanta Margarita, Duchess of Soria (younger sister of former King Juan Carlos I)

==Portuguese infantes==
&quot;Infante&quot; had no feminine form at first in Portugal and may be compared to the &quot;infanções&quot; of the lower Portuguese nobility, who were also cadets of their families with no prospect of inheriting the main possessions of the noble families to which they belonged, being distinguished in law by some prerogatives, but little patrimony.

Later, the word &quot;infanta&quot; emerged in Portugal as a feminised form applied to Portuguese princesses after the 16th and 17th centuries. Also, after Edward, King of Portugal, in the 15th century, the heir apparent and his eldest son, or daughter if there was no son, came to be styled &quot;prince&quot; or &quot;princess&quot;. The first prince in Portugal was the future Afonso V, his eldest son, maybe adopting the French royal style by an English influence imported by Philippa of Lancaster&#x27;s retinue.

After the accession of the House of Braganza to the throne, the honorific of &quot;Most Serene&quot; (&quot;Sereníssimo&quot;) was prefixed to the title of &quot;infante&quot; (&quot;Sereníssima&quot; for an &quot;infanta&quot;), since the complete appellation of this dynasty was &quot;Most Serene House of Braganza&quot; (&quot;Sereníssima Casa de Bragança&quot;), a style granted by the Pope. The style, however, does not seem to have been used with the title of Prince Royal.

===Current infantes of Portugal===
Portugal has been a republic since 1910. Close relatives of Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza, head of the Portuguese royal house, using the title are:
*Infanta Maria Francisca, Duchess of Coimbra: Duarte Pio&#x27;s 2nd child;
*Infante Dinis, Duke of Porto: Duarte Pio&#x27;s 3rd child;
*Infante Miguel, Duke of Viseu: Duarte Pio&#x27;s 2nd brother

Afonso, Prince of Beira, Duarte Pio&#x27;s eldest son and heir apparent, is styled Prince of Beira, not &quot;infante&quot;.

<text>Robert Gilmour &quot;R. G.&quot; LeTourneau (; November 30, 1888 – June 1, 1969), born in Richford, Vermont, was a prolific inventor of technologies related to earthmoving machinery, and founder of LeTourneau Technologies and LeTourneau University. His factories supplied machinery which represented nearly 75 percent of the earthmoving equipment used by the Allied forces during World War II, and more than half of the Alaska Highway in Canada, &quot;Alcan&quot;, was built using LeTourneau equipment. Over the course of his life he secured 299 patents, relating to earthmoving equipment, manufacturing processes, and machine tools.

LeTourneau sold most company assets in 1953 for US$ 31M, but reentered the heavy equipment field as LeTourneau Technologies, the oversight of which was left to his son, Richard LeTourneau, on his retirement in 1966. Its manufacturing and offshore drilling assets were sold in 1970 to Marathon Manufacturing Co., to become Marathon LeTourneau Co. (the assets of which became and remain divided between various manufacturing and rig-technology companies).

In his later life and retirement, the elder LeTourneau was involved in philanthropic pursuits, many related to his Christian faith.

==Early life and education==

Robert Gilmour LeTourneau, known as &quot;R.G.&quot; to friends, was born on November 30, 1888, to a farming family living in Richford, Vermont. He moved with them to Duluth, Minnesota, and then to Portland, Oregon, where he attended school through high school, dropping out at the age of 14 to take on an apprenticeship as an ironworker, at the East Portland Iron Works.

There he learned the foundry and machinist trades, and, at the same time, did correspondence study of the &quot;basics of mechanical engineering&quot;, although he never completed any course assignments in those International Correspondence Schools courses. LeTourneau then began his working life in a variety of jobs that taught him &quot;valuable technical skills&quot;.

==Career==

===Early career===

LeTourneau eventually moved to San Francisco, where he worked at the Moore and Scott Iron Works at the personal invitation of the owner. After the San Francisco earthquake and fire, work was hard to come by. As described in a 2007 LaTourneau company biography (after his passing, when the company was under ownership by Rowan Companies), before 1909he was employed at the Yerba Buena Power Plant and learned welding skills and became familiar with the application of electricity. In 1909, he moved to Stockton, California. During this time, LeTourneau worked at a number of jobs including wood cutter, farm hand, miner and carpenter&#x27;s laborer, acquiring a sound knowledge of the manual trades that would prove invaluable in later life.

In 1909 he took an automobile correspondence course granting himself a &quot;Bachelor of Motorcycles&quot; as he learned about vehicle mechanics and graduated by taking apart and putting back together his newly acquired motorcycle in a day. After working on a project to build a bridge across the Stanislaus River, and seeing first hand the Fresno scraper, he was anxious to put to use his mechanical skills. 

As described in the 2007 company biography, &quot;[i]n 1911, LeTourneau was employed at the Superior Garage in Stockton, California, where he learned about vehicle mechanics and later became half-owner of the business.&quot; His stake was $1,000, and the building may have been the first in that section of California designed exclusively for the sales and servicing of cars.

LeTourneau was further described in the 2007 company biography:Refused military service because of permanent neck injuries sustained in a car racing accident, LeTourneau worked during World War I as a maintenance assistant at the Mare Island Navy Yard in California, where he was trained as an electrical machinist and improved his welding skills. After the war, LeTourneau returned to Stockton and discovered the Superior Garage business had failed. In order to repay his portion of the debts, he took a job repairing a Holt crawler tractor, and was then employed by the tractor owner to level using the tractor and a towed scraper.

===Move into manufacturing===

As also described in the company biography:This type of work appealed to LeTourneau and in January of 1920, he purchased a used Holt tractor and, with a hired scraper, commenced business as a land leveling contractor. In May of 1921, he purchased a plot of land in Stockton, California, and established a small engineering workshop, where he designed and built several types of scrapers. Combining contracting and earthmoving equipment manufacturing, his business soon began to expand and, in 1929, ...were incorporated in California as R. G. LeTourneau, Inc.

Continuing, the biography states,Letourneau completed many earthmoving projects during the 1920&#x27;s and early 1930&#x27;s, including the Boulder Highway to Hoover Dam in Nevada, the Marysville Levees, Orange County Dam and the Newhall Cut-off in California. In 1933, LeTourneau retired from contracting to devote his attention to the manufacturing of earthmoving equipment. In 1935, he built a manufacturing plant in Peoria, Illinois, and the continued expansion of his business saw the establishment of manufacturing plants in Toccoa, Georgia in 1938; Rydalmere, Australia in 1941; Vicksburg, Mississippi in 1942, and Longview, Texas in 1945.

===Later career===
In 1953, LeTourneau sold his entire earthmoving equipment line—including plants, land, machinery, and inventory—to the Westinghouse Air Brake Company for US$ 31 million. In 1958, at the age of seventy, LeTourneau re-entered the earthmoving equipment manufacturing business, offering contractors a range of high capacity earthmoving, transportation, and material handling machines. These were based on his recently developed electric wheel drive (wheel hub motor).

In 1966, at age 77, LeTourneau handed over leadership of the work and assets of the remaining company, LeTourneau Technologies, to his son, Richard LeTourneau. After 1966, LeTourneau continued to work each day and could be found at the drawing board in his modest office, designing new ways to move larger loads faster and more economically.

LeTourneau Technologies was sold to Marathon Manufacturing Company in 1972, becoming Marathon LeTourneau Company, which was in turn acquired by Rowan in 1986, and Joy Global in 2011, the last of which was acquired by and renamed to Komatsu Mining Corp. That company&#x27;s assets—electric wheel and oil rig technologies—became and remain divided between various manufacturing and rig-technology companies.

==Contributions==
The LeTourneau name became synonymous with earthmoving worldwide. LeTourneau was largely responsible for the invention and development of many types of earthmoving machines now widely used. He designed and built machines using technology that was years, sometimes decades, ahead of its time, and became recognized worldwide as a leader in the development and manufacture of heavy equipment.

LeTourneau is credited with:
* introduction of land scaper equipment with a single person-operated power control unit, allowing it, in combination, to load, haul, dump, and spread earth;
* replacing earlier-used &quot;wide steel wheels&quot; that &quot;cut into sandy soil&quot;, with large rubber truck tires, and the development of low-pressure, heavy-duty rubber tires;
* placing diesel-generator powered electric motors (akin to diesel-electric locomotives) on each driving wheel of his scrapers;
* and with developing the two-wheeled &quot;Tournapull&quot; tractor unit; and numerous other improvements relating to scrapers;
* as well as the concepts related to and used in mobile offshore drilling platforms.

===Outside of business===

With the help of his wife, the late Evelyn Peterson (1900-1987), he founded LeTourneau University, a private, Christian institution, in Longview, Texas. LeTourneau was widely known as a devout Christian and generous philanthropist to Christian causes, including the &quot;LeTourneau Christian Center&quot; camp and conference grounds in Rushville, New York, and Georgia Baptist Conference Center in Toccoa, Georgia. LeTourneau was often referred to by his contemporaries as &quot;God&#x27;s businessman&quot;.

==Personal pursuits==
As described in his 2007 company biography, &quot;[i]n 1917, [R.G.] married Evelyn Peterson, the daughter of a draying company owner from Minnesota.&quot;

In 1965, International Correspondence Schools awarded LeTourneau his diploma in engineering, 50 years after he studied from their course materials. LeTourneau was 76 at the time and, in accepting the diploma, jovially remarked to executive assistant, Nels Stjernstrom: &quot;So now I&#x27;ve got a diploma. Now I&#x27;m educated.&quot;

LeTourneau held many respected positions throughout his life as a Christian layman, including as a leader in the Christian &amp; Missionary Alliance Church, of Christian Business Men&#x27;s Connection International, (CBMC, then the Christian Business Men&#x27;s Committee International), and of the Gideons International. For 30 years he flew thousands of miles each week to maintain Christian speaking engagements around the United States and overseas.

LeTourneau set aside 90 percent of his salary and company profits for religious donations, living on the other 10 percent. He once stated that &quot;I shovel out the money, and God shovels it back – but God has a bigger shovel&quot;. &quot;You have made the word of God a glorious, practical reality,&quot; radio program host Robert Ripley told LeTourneau, then turned to the audience with his own trademark flourish. &quot;And of such is the work of faith...believe it or not.&quot;

LeTourneau was a firm believer in the effectiveness of practical instruction combined with classroom studies; and, in 1946, he purchased an unused military hospital, accompanying land and buildings in Longview. There he established the LeTourneau Technical Institute at the site of the former Harmon General Hospital to provide sound technical and mechanical training, traditional college courses, and training for missionary technicians, based on the philosophy of combining work, education, and Christian testimony. The LeTourneau Technical Institute became a college in its own right, in 1961, and eventually gained &quot;university&quot; status to become LeTourneau University.

In 1953, LeTourneau began a development project in the country of Liberia, West Africa, with the diverse goals of colonization, land development, agricultural development, livestock introduction, evangelism and philanthropic activities. In 1954, a colonization project with similar objectives to those in Liberia was established in the country of Peru, South America. The project in Peru was called &quot;Tournavista&quot;.

==Death==

In March 1969, LeTourneau suffered a severe stroke from which he never recovered. He died on June 1, 1969, at the age of eighty. He was survived by his wife, Evelyn, and five children: four sons (Richard, Roy, Ted, and Ben), and a daughter, Louise Dick.

==Awards, recognition, and legacy==
Known throughout the construction world as, &quot;The Dean of Earthmoving,&quot; LeTourneau is considered to this day to have been the world&#x27;s greatest inventor of earthmoving and materials handling equipment. Few manufacturers of that era had such a profound effect upon the art of earthmoving as did LeTourneau. Just two years prior to his death, LeTourneau recorded his thoughts about the future of earthmoving equipment:Construction machinery will grow bigger and bigger, and more and more powerful. Instead of &#x27;tons&#x27; of capacity, they&#x27;ll be in &#x27;hundreds of tons&#x27;, and instead of hundreds of horsepower, they&#x27;ll all be rated in &#x27;thousands’ of horsepower&#x27; ... We&#x27;re already seeing it in big hauling units in the mines, and believe me, when the contractor and mining companies start looking for bigger and more profitable hauling units and earthmoving equipment, I&#x27;m going to be right there, the firstest with the mostest.

LeTourneau was active in his company as president and chairman of the board from 1929 until 1966. He also held the position of chief engineer, personally working alongside his engineers and employees throughout his working life. Having spent his entire life around earthmoving equipment, LeTourneau (by description of those close to him), was just as likely to be seen at the controls of one of his machines as attending to corporate matters; he preferred the former. LeTourneau, as described by the peers at the university he founded, shunned the high-life often associated with successful businessmen, preferring to spend his time at the drawing board with the engineers designing new machinery or spending time on the factory floor overseeing his employees.

LeTourneau Hall at Toccoa Falls College was named in his honor. Toccoa Airport, also known as R. G. LeTourneau Field, was built by LeTourneau and named in his honor.

Throughout his career, he was the recipient of more than 30 awards and honors related to engineering, manufacturing, and the development of heavy equipment. In 1936, he was presented with the &quot;Appreciation of Service Achievement 1931-1935,&quot; by Six Companies Incorporated for supplying earthmoving equipment to the &quot;Boulder Dam&quot; project. He was awarded the Frank P. Brown Medal in 1956. Recognition of service to the earthmoving industry later came from many other contractors in the industry, and, in February 1958, LeTourneau was presented with the &quot;Beavers Award&quot; at the third-annual awards dinner of the &quot;Beavers&quot;, an association of leaders in the heavy construction industry. In presenting the award to LeTourneau, &quot;Beaver&quot; president George H. Atkinson, of the highly respected U.S. contractors, Guy F. Atkinson Company, of San Francisco, said, &quot;There is hardly any place in the vast industry that has not benefited through the products of Mr. LeTourneau&#x27;s inventive genius.&quot;

<doc id="1305143" wikidata="Q2700588" url="?curid=1305143" title="Tennis (1984 video game)">
<text>is a tennis video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Family Computer (Famicom). It was originally released in Japan in 1984, with an arcade game version titled VS. Tennis released for the Nintendo VS. System the same year, becoming a hit at Japanese and American arcades that year; it was the sixth top-performing arcade game of 1984 in the United States. &quot;Tennis&quot; is one of 17 launch games for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in North America and Europe. The game was re-released for the Game Boy as a launch game in North America.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Tennis&quot; features single-player and two-player modes for singles and doubles matches, with either competitive or cooperative gameplay. A computerized opponent&#x27;s artificial intelligence can be set to one of five difficulty levels. Mario is the official.

==Development and release==
In 1983, the Famicom had only three launch games, and its library would total seven, including &quot;Tennis&quot;. Shigeru Miyamoto said he was &quot;directly in charge of the character design and the game design&quot;. The game was developed in 1983.

In 1984, it was included in the Nintendo VS. System arcade game series under the name which was released in Japan on January 18, 1984. In 1985, Hudson Soft published &quot;Tennis&quot; for the PC-8801. It was re-released for the North American launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System in October 1985. Nintendo ported the game to the Game Boy in 1989, and to the Nintendo e-Reader in 2002.

The NES version is embedded in the life simulation game &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; (2001), and in the party video game &quot;&quot; (2004) as one of 9-Volt&#x27;s minigames. For the Virtual Console, Nintendo republished the NES version to the Wii in 2006 and the Wii U in 2013 and the Game Boy version to the Nintendo 3DS in 2011. This version was added to Nintendo Switch Online in late 2018.

== Reception ==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;VS. Tennis&quot; in its March 15, 1984 issue as the most successful table arcade cabinet of the month. It again topped the &quot;Game Machine&quot; table arcade game charts in April and May 1984. In the United States, &quot;Vs. Tennis&quot; topped the arcade software conversion kit charts of &quot;RePlay&quot; (July 1984) and &quot;Play Meter&quot; (August 1984). It became the sixth top-performing arcade game of 1984 in the United States. In Europe, it had become a popular arcade game by 1986.

<text>Lincang () is a prefecture-level city located in the southwest of Yunnan province, People&#x27;s Republic of China.

== History ==
Lincang was previously called Baihuai during the Shang dynasty.

On December 26, 2003, the state council approved the cancellation of Lincang District and set up prefecture-level Lincang city.

==Geography and climate==

Lincang covers latitude 23° 05′－25° 02′ N and longitude 98° 40′－100° 33′ E, thus straddling the Tropic of Cancer in the southern part of its administrative area, or prefecture. It is situated on the middle to lower reaches of the Mekong, known as the Lancang in China, and the Salween, or the Nu. Bordering prefectures are Pu&#x27;er to the southeast, and Baoshan and Dali to the northwest. It also borders Burma&#x27;s Shan State. Elevations within the prefecture range from .

Located at an altitude of above and within 30 arc minutes to the north of the Tropic of Cancer, Lincang has a mild subtropical highland climate (Köppen &quot;Cwb&quot;), bordering on a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cwa&quot;), with muddled distinction between the seasons and daytime temperatures remaining warm year-round. Highs peak in May before the core of the rainy season and reach a minimum in December; however, the warmest and coolest months are June and January respectively. June through September accounts for nearly 70% of the annual rainfall of and during this time, some rainfall occurs on most days, pushing relative humidity above 80% and there is a marked reduction in sunshine. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 24% in July to 75% in January, the city receives 2,227 hours of bright sunshine annually.

==Subdivisions==

==Demography==

Among the resident population, the Han population is 1,523,670, accounting for 62.72% of the total population; the ethnic minorities population is 905,835, accounting for 37.28% of the total population.


==Natural resources==
Mineral resources mined and extracted in the Lincang area include coal (including waste coal ash), germanium and uranium. Lincang is also home to the world&#x27;s oldest cultivated tea tree, especially pu&#x27;er tea, some 3,200 years old, in the village of Jinxiu (), Xiaowan town, of Fengqing County.

<text>The Artuqid dynasty (alternatively Artukid, Ortoqid, or Ortokid; , pl. ; ; ) was established in 1102 as an Anatolian Beylik (Principality) of the Seljuk Empire. It formed a Turkoman dynasty rooted in the Oghuz tribe, and followed the Sunni Muslim faith. It ruled in eastern Anatolia, Northern Syria and Northern Iraq in the eleventh through thirteenth centuries. The Artuqid dynasty took its name from its founder, Artuk Bey, who was of the Döger branch of the Oghuz Turks and ruled one of the Turkmen beyliks of the Seljuk Empire. Artuk&#x27;s sons and descendants ruled the three branches in the region: Sökmen&#x27;s descendants ruled the region around Hasankeyf between 1102 and 1231; Ilghazi&#x27;s branch ruled from Mardin and Mayyafariqin between 1106 and 1186 (until 1409 as vassals) and Aleppo from 1117–1128; and the Harput line starting in 1112 under the Sökmen branch, and was independent between 1185 and 1233.

== History ==

The dynasty was founded by Artuk, son of Eksük, a general originally under Malik-Shah I and then under the Seljuk emir of Damascus, Tutush I. Tutush appointed Artuk governor of Jerusalem in 1086. Artuk died in 1091, and was succeeded by his sons Sökmen and Ilghazi who were expelled from Jerusalem by the Fatimid vizier al-Afdal Shahanshah in 1098; the Fatimids lost the city to the Crusaders the following year after the siege of Jerusalem of 1099.

Sökmen and Ilghazi established themselves in Diyarbakır, Mardin, and Hasankeyf in al-Jazira where they came into conflict with the Seljuk sultanate. Sökmen, bey of Mardin, defeated the Crusaders at the Battle of Harran in 1104. Ilghazi succeeded Sökmen in Mardin and imposed his control over Aleppo at the request of the &quot;qadi&quot; Ibn al-Khashshab in 1118. The next year, Ilghazi defeated the Crusader state Principality of Antioch at the Battle of Ager Sanguinis of 1119.
After pillaging the County of Edessa, Ilghazi made peace with the Crusaders. In 1121, he went north towards Armenia with his son-in-law Mazyad Dubais II ibn Sadaqah and Sultan Malik of Ganja. Ilghazi invaded Georgia and was defeated by David IV of Georgia at the Battle of Didgori of 1121. Ilghazi died in 1122, and although his nephew Belek Ghazi nominally controlled Aleppo, the city was really controlled by ibn al-Khashshab. Ibn al-Kashshab was murdered by Assassins in 1125, and Aleppo fell under the control of Zengi, atabeg of Mosul, in 1128. After the death of Belek Ghazi, the Artuqids were split between Harput, Hasankeyf and Mardin. Sokman&#x27;s son Rukn al-Dawla Dāʾūd, bey of Hasankeyf, died in 1144, and was succeeded by his son Kara Aslan. Kara Aslan allied with Joscelin II of Edessa against the Zengids, and while Joscelin was away in 1144, Zengi recaptured Edessa, the first of the Crusader states to fall (see Siege of Edessa). The Artuqids became vassals of the Zengids during the reign of Nur al-Din Zengi (r. 1146–1174).

Kara Aslan&#x27;s son Nūr al-Dīn Muḥammad allied with the Ayyubid sultan Saladin against Kilij Arslan II, Seljuk sultan of Rûm, whose daughter had married Nur ad-Din Muhammad. In the peace settlement with Kilij Arslan II, Saladin gained control of the Artuqid territory, even though the Artuqids were still technically vassals of Mosul, which Saladin did not control. The Seljuk Empire completely disintegrated soon after that in 1194.

The Artuqid dynasty remained in nominal command of al-Jazira, but their power declined under Ayyubid rule. The Hasankeyf branch conquered Diyarbakır in 1198 and its center was moved here, but was demolished by the Ayyubids in 1231 when it attempted to form an alliance with the Seljuks. The Harput branch was destroyed by the Sultanate of Rum due to following a slippery policy between the Ayyubids and Seljuks. The Mardin branch survived for longer, but as a vassal of the Ayyubids, Sultanate of Rûm, Il-Khanate, Timurids and the Qara Qoyunlu. Qara Arslan (r.1260–1292), ruler of Mardin, submitted to the Mongol Hulegu. Qara Qoyunlu ruler Qara Mahammad invaded Mardin in 1384 and received the submission of its Artuqid ruler Majd al-Din Isa Al-Zahir (1376-1407). From this point onwards, the Artuqids operated as a vassal state of the Qara Qoyunlu. The Kara Koyunlu captured Mardin and finally put an end to Artuqid rule in 1409.

== Art ==

Despite their constant preoccupation with war, members of the Artuqid dynasty left many architectural monuments. Artuqid rulers commissioned many public buildings, such as mosques, bazaars, bridges, hospitals and baths for the benefit of their subjects. They left an important cultural heritage by contributing to literature and the art of metalworking. The door and door handles of the great Mosque of Cizre are unique examples of Artuqid metal working craftsmanship, which can be seen in the Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum in Istanbul, Turkey.

They made the most significant additions to Diyarbakır City Walls. Urfa Gate was rebuilt by Muhammad, son of Kara Arslan. In the same area of the western wall, south of Urfa Gate, two imposing towers, Ulu Beden and Yedi Kardeş were commissioned in 1208 by the Artuqid ruler Nāṣir al-Dīn Maḥmūd who designed the Yedi Kardeş tower himself and apposed the Artuqid double-headed eagle on its walls.

A large caravanserai in Mardin as well as the civil engineering feat of Malabadi Bridge are still in regular use in our day. The partially standing Old Bridge, Hasankeyf, was built in 1116 by Kara Arslan.

The Great Mosques of Mardin and Silvan were possibly but in any case considerably developed over the 12th century by several Artuqid rulers on the basis of existing Seljuk edifices. The congregational mosque of Dunaysir (now Kızıltepe) was commissioned by Yülük Arslan (1184–1203) and completed after his death in 1204 by his brother Artuk Arslan (1203–1239).

===Literature===
The Artuqids are known for their sponsoring of literary works in Arabic. A copy of al-Sufi&#x27;s book on astronomy &quot;The Book of Fixed Stars&quot;, a synthesis of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot; and Arabic astronomical traditions, was made in 1131 in Artuqid Mardin. Kara Arslan (1148–1174 CE) commissioned a new Arabic translation of &quot;De Materia Medica&quot; by an Arab Christian author named Abu Salim al-Malti, probably from Malatya.

The Artuqid ruler Nasr al-Din Mahmud (r. 1201–1222) is known to have commissioned an edition of the &quot;Al-Jāmi‘ fī ṣinā‘at al-ḥiyal&quot; of Ibn al-Razzaz al-Jazari, devoted to the depiction of mechanical devices, in April 1206 at the Artuqid court (Ahmet III 3472, Topkapı Sarayı Library). The miniatures are thought to reflect various aspects of the Artuqid court at the time. Ibn al-Razzaz al-Jazari was employed at the Artuqid court during the last quarter of the 12th century, and this is the earliest known manuscript of his opus. Many of the figures in the manuscript wear the characteristic Turkic dress, with long coat and boots, and the &quot;sharbush&quot; headgear (of a special type seen only in Artuqid manuscripts, with a very tall cap behind the headplate and the limited usage of fur around the rim).

An early edition of the &quot;Maqamat al-Hariri&quot; (Bibliothèque Nationale de France, Arabe 3929) is also considered as probably belonging to the same Artuqid school of painting.

<text>The Aesti (also Aestii, Astui or Aests) were an ancient people first described by the Roman historian Tacitus in his treatise &quot;Germania&quot; (circa 98 AD). According to Tacitus, the territory of Aesti was located somewhere east of the &quot;Suiones&quot; (Swedes).

==Overview==
Tacitus described the Aesti as having lived &quot;upon the right of the Suevian Sea&quot; and had the same customs and attire as the Germanic Suevi. It has been suggested that the Aesti worshipped the mother of the gods, similar to the Nerthus cult among northern Germanic peoples. Though they were most likely of Baltic origin, they had extensively intermingled with the neighbouring Gothic tribes.

Tacitus wrote that the Aesti were &quot;the only people who collect amber—&quot;glaesum&quot; is their own word for it—in the shallows or even on the beach&quot;. &quot;Glaesum&quot;, an apparently Latinised word for amber (in Latin, &quot;sucinum&quot;), is the only surviving example of the Aestian language. The word is quoted of being of Germanic origin, given its similarity to the Gothic word &quot;glas&quot;. Tacitus, however, describes the language of the &quot;Aestii&quot; as closer to that spoken in Britain than those of other neighbouring tribes.

The Old Prussian and modern Lithuanian names for the Vistula Lagoon, &quot;Aīstinmari&quot; and &quot;Aistmarės&quot;, respectively, appear to derive from &quot;Aesti&quot; and &quot;mari&quot; (&quot;lagoon&quot; or &quot;fresh-water bay&quot;), which suggests that the area around the lagoon had links with the Aesti.

== Historical sources ==

=== Tacitus ===


The writers of antiquity, beginning with Tacitus, who was the first Roman author to mention them in his &quot;Germania&quot;, provide very little information on the Aesti. Although Tacitus never travelled to Magna Germania himself and only recorded information he had obtained from others, the short ethnographic excursus below is the most detailed ancient account of the Aesti that we have:

&quot;Upon the right of the Suevian Sea the Aestian nations reside, who use the same customs and attire with the Suevians; their language more resembles that of Britain. They worship the Mother of the Gods. As the characteristic of their national superstition, they wear the images of wild boars. This alone serves them for arms, this is the safeguard of all, and by this every worshipper of the Goddess is secured even amidst his foes. Rare amongst them is the use of weapons of iron, but frequent that of clubs. In producing of grain and the other fruits of the earth, they labour with more assiduity and patience than is suitable to the usual laziness of Germans. Nay, they even search the deep, and of all the rest are the only people who gather amber. They call it &quot;glesum&quot;, and find it amongst the shallows and upon the very shore. But, according to the ordinary incuriosity and ignorance of Barbarians, they have neither learnt, nor do they inquire, what is its nature, or from what cause it is produced. In truth it lay long neglected amongst the other gross discharges of the sea; till from our luxury, it gained a name and value. To themselves it is of no use: they gather it rough, they expose it in pieces coarse and unpolished, and for it receive a price with wonder. 
::::(&quot;Germania&quot;, chapter ).

The placement of the Tacitean Aesti is based primarily on their association with amber, a popular luxury item during the life of Tacitus, with known sources at the southeastern coast of the Baltic Sea. The Baltic amber trade, which appears to have extended to the Mediterranean Sea, has been traced by archaeologists back to the Nordic Bronze Age; its major center was in the region of Sambia.

This trade probably existed before the historical Trojan War in the 13th century BCE, as amber is one of the substances in which the palace of Menelaus at Sparta was said to be rich in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;.

===Cassiodorus===

Cassiodorus&#x27; &quot;Variae&quot;, published in 537, contains a letter written by Cassiodorus in the name of Theodoric the Great, addressed to the Aesti:

It is gratifying to us to know that you have heard of our fame, and have sent ambassadors who have passed through so many strange nations to seek our friendship.&lt;br&gt;We have received the amber which you have sent us. You say that you gather this lightest of all substances from the shores of ocean, but how it comes thither you know not. But as an author named Cornelius (Tacitus) informs us, it is gathered in the innermost islands of the ocean, being formed originally of the juice of a tree (whence its name succinum), and gradually hardened by the heat of the sun. Thus it becomes an exuded metal, a transparent softness, sometimes blushing with the color of saffron, sometimes glowing with flame-like clearness. Then, gliding down to the margin of sea, and further purified by the rolling of the tides, it is at length transported to your shores to be cast upon them. We have thought it better to point this out to you, lest you should imagine that &quot;your supposed secrets have escaped our knowledge&quot;. We sent you some presents by our ambassadors, and shall be glad to receive further visits from you by the road which you have thus opened up, and to show you future favors.

The style of the letter proves that the nation was at that time independent, not ruled by the Ostrogoths. Apparently, Cassiodorus considered it politically essential to establish friendly relations with the Nordic region. The letter also implies that the Aesti were fully confident of the value of amber and had made out of it a trade secret. Sending presents and promising to show future favors were in ancient times a cordial way of giving &quot;de jure&quot; recognition to another power.

=== Jordanes ===

The sixth-century historian Jordanes makes two references to the Aesti in his book, &quot;The Origins and the Deeds of the Goths&quot;, which was a treatment of Cassiodorus&#x27; longer book (which no longer survives) on the history of the Goths. The first quote geographically places the Aestii beyond the Vidivarii, on the shore of the Baltic: &quot;a subject race, likewise hold the shore of Ocean.&quot; The next quote concerns the subjugation of the Aesti by Hermanaric, king of the Gothic Greuthungi: &quot;This ruler also subdued by his wisdom and might the race of the Aesti, who dwell on the farthest shore of the German Ocean&quot;.

=== Alfred the Great ===

In an 11th-century manuscript of King Alfred&#x27;s account of the voyage from Hedeby to Truso by Wulfstan, held by the British Museum, includes ethnographic information on the medieval Aesti, in which the terms &quot;Esti&quot;, &quot;Est-mere&quot; and &quot;Eastland&quot; are used referring to Old Prussians. In the text, a summary description of the country and its riches is followed by a very detailed account of the people&#x27;s funeral customs.
 It mentions the old trading port Truso of Old Prussians and also calls the land Witland - &quot;the Vistula is a very large river, and near it lie Witland and Weonodland; and Witland belongs to the Esthonians [&quot;belimpedh to Estum&quot;].&quot;

=== Adam of Bremen ===
During the 11th century, Adam of Bremen, citing Einhard (who in the &quot;Vita Caroli Magni&quot; states that &quot;the Slavs and the Aisti live on the shores of the Eastern Sea&quot;), mentions the coastal tribe as the Haisti, and refers to today&#x27;s Estonia as Aestland.

<text>Latinxua Sin Wenz () is a historical set of romanizations for Chinese. Promoted as a revolutionary reform to combat illiteracy and replace Chinese characters, Sin Wenz distinctively does not indicate tones, for pragmatic reasons and to encourage the use of everyday colloquial language. Beifangxua Latinxua Sin Wenz (), for Mandarin Chinese, was the original iteration, and a number of variations for various varieties of Chinese were developed by regional Sin Wenz associations.

Latinxua is historically notable as being the first romanization system used in place of Chinese characters by native Chinese speakers. It was originally developed by groups of Chinese and Russian scholars in the Soviet Union and used by Chinese expatriates there until the majority of them left the Soviet Union. Later, it was revived for some time in Northern China where it was used in over 300 publications before its usage was ended by the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

==History and development==
The work towards constructing the Beifangxua Latinxua Sin Wenz (北方話拉丁化新文字) system began in Moscow as early as 1928 when the Soviet Scientific Research Institute on China sought to create a means through which the large Chinese population living in the far eastern region of the USSR could be made literate, facilitating their further education.

This was significantly different from all other romanization schemes in that, from the very outset, it was intended that the Latinxua Sin Wenz system, once established, would supersede the Chinese characters. They decided to use the Latin alphabet because they thought that it would serve their purpose better than Cyrillic. Unlike Gwoyeu Romatzyh, with its complex method of indicating tones, Latinxua Sin Wenz system does not indicate tones at all.

The eminent Moscow-based Chinese scholar Qu Qiubai (1899–1935) and the Russian linguist V.S. Kolokolov (1896–1979) devised a prototype romanization system in 1929.

In 1931 a coordinated effort between the Soviet sinologists Alekseyev V.M., Dragunov A.A. and Shprintsin A. G., and the Moscow-based Chinese scholars Qu Qiubai, Wu Yuzhang, Lin Boqu, Xiao San, Wang Xiangbao, and Xu Teli established the Latinxua Sin Wenz system. The system was supported by a number of Chinese intellectuals such as Guo Moruo and Lu Xun, and trials were conducted amongst 100,000 Chinese immigrant workers for about four years and later, in 1940–1942, in the communist-controlled Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region of China. In November 1949, the railways in China&#x27;s north-east adopted the Latinxua Sin Wenz system for all their telecommunications.

In 1940, several thousand members attended a Border Region Sin Wenz Society convention. Mao Zedong and Zhu De, head of the army, both contributed their calligraphy (in characters) for the masthead of the Sin Wenz Society&#x27;s new journal. Outside the CCP, other prominent supporters included Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s son, Sun Fo; Cai Yuanpei, the country&#x27;s most prestigious educator; Tao Xingzhi, a leading educational reformer; and Lu Xun. Over thirty journals soon appeared written in Sin Wenz, plus large numbers of translations, biographies (including Lincoln, Franklin, Edison, Ford, and Charlie Chaplin), some contemporary Chinese literature, and a spectrum of textbooks. In 1940, the movement reached an apex when Mao&#x27;s Border Region Government declared that the Sin Wenz had the same legal status as traditional characters in government and public documents. Many educators and political leaders looked forward to the day when they would be universally accepted and completely replace Chinese characters. Opposition arose, however, because the system was less well adapted to writing regional languages, and therefore would require learning Mandarin. Sin Wenz fell into relative disuse during the following years.
For a time, the system was very important in spreading literacy in Northern China; and more than 300 publications totaling half a million issues appeared in Latinxua Sin Wenz. However:

In 1944 the latinization movement was officially curtailed in the communist-controlled areas [of China] on the pretext that there were insufficient trained cadres capable of teaching the system. It is more likely that, as the communists prepared to take power in a much wider territory, they had second thoughts about the rhetoric that surrounded the latinization movement; in order to obtain the maximum popular support, they withdrew support from a movement that deeply offended many supporters of the traditional writing system.
==Description==
Sin Wenz was designed so that every dialect had its own form of the alphabet. The letters below represent only one of the thirteen possible schemes present, the below form being Beifangxua Latinxua Sin Wenz: that for Northern Mandarin.

Much of Beifangxua Latinxua Sin Wenz is similar to Pinyin in its orthography. However, it is based upon the pronunciation outlined by the Commission on the Unification of Pronunciation, rather than upon the Beijing pronunciation (as with Hanyu Pinyin), hence the distinction between sounds such as palatalized alveolars (&quot;zi–ci–si&quot;) and palatalized velars (&quot;gi–ki–xi&quot;), or spellings such as &quot;yo&quot; and &quot;ung&quot; instead of &quot;ye&quot; or &quot;eng&quot;. Thus, Beijing is written as &#x27; and Tianjin as &#x27; in Sin Wenz, and the characters () and () are written as &#x27; and &#x27;, with the same initial character.

===Initials===
===Finals===

1&quot;e&quot; and &quot;ye&quot; is written as &quot;o&quot; and &quot;yo&quot; after initials &quot;g&quot;, &quot;k&quot; and &quot;x&quot;. For example: &#x27; (), &#x27; ()&lt;br&gt;
2Standalone &quot;ui&quot;, &quot;un&quot; and &quot;ung&quot; are written as &quot;wei&quot;, &quot;wen&quot; and &quot;weng&quot; respectively.&lt;br&gt;
3What is written as &quot;i&quot; (IPA ) after &quot;zh&quot;, &quot;ch&quot;, &quot;sh&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, &quot;c&quot; and &quot;s&quot; in pinyin is not written in Sin Wenz. This &quot;null vowel&quot; feature is identical to Zhuyin.

As in pinyin, spacing in Sin Wenz is based on whole words, not single syllables. Except for &quot;u&quot;, others syllables starting with &quot;u&quot; is always written with a &quot;w&quot; replacing the &quot;u&quot;. The syllable &quot;u&quot; is only preceded by a &quot;w&quot; when it occurs in the middle of a word. For syllables starting with &quot;i&quot;, the &quot;i&quot; is replaced by a &quot;j&quot; (in case of the syllables &quot;i&quot;, &quot;in&quot; and &quot;ing&quot;, preceded by a &quot;j&quot;) only in the middle of a word. Syllables starting with &quot;y&quot; is preceded by a &quot;j&quot; only when preceded by a consonant in the middle of a word. These are unlike pinyin, which always uses &quot;w&quot; and &quot;y&quot; regardless of the positions of the syllables. As in pinyin, the apostrophe (&#x27;) is used before &quot;a&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, and &quot;e&quot; to separate syllables in a word where ambiguity could arise.

===Irregular spellings===
Because Sin Wenz is written without indicating tones, ambiguity could arise with certain words with the same sound but different tones. In order to circumvent this problem, Sin Wenz defined a list of exceptions: &quot;characters with fixed spellings&quot; (). For example, () and () are of the same sound but different tones. The former is written as &#x27; and the latter is written as &#x27; in Sin Wenz. 
The word () is also special; it is written as &#x27;, as opposed to &#x27;, which may be ().

Telegrams sent by workers for the railways in the northeast of China switched from Zhuyin to Sin Wenz in 1950, then from Sin Wenz to Hanyu Pinyin in 1958; the 5 irregular spellings of 买 &quot;maai&quot;, 试 &quot;shii&quot;, 板 &quot;baan&quot;, 不 &quot;bu&quot;, and 李 &quot;lii&quot;, in use during the Hanyu Pinyin period, were inherited from Sin Wenz.

In addition, Sin Wenz also calls for the use of the postal romanization when writing place names in China, as well as preservation of foreign spellings (hence &quot;Latinxua&quot; rather than &quot;*Ladingxua&quot;).

<text>Centro-Sul (, &quot;South-Central&quot;) is a geographic area that encompasses the Southeastern, Southern and Central-West regions of Brazil (see Brazil Regional Division), excluding the north of Minas Gerais, most of Mato Grosso, and parts of Tocantins.

== Demographics ==
About 135 million Brazilians live in this region. Most industries are concentrated in the area and are responsible for ~75% of the national GDP. In addition, the majority of the population is predominantly of European descent, and more than half of the population self-identifies as White Brazilian.

The region also is characterized by having a high standard of living (HDI of ~0.787, in average), compared to the rest of the country.
The &quot;Centro Sul&quot; region now has similar development to that of Uruguay and Argentina; the richest South American countries.

<text>Belle Mead is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located within Montgomery Township, in Somerset County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the CDP&#x27;s population was 5,569, reflecting an expansion of the CDP from in 2010 to in 2020. 

==History==
Up until about 1875, Belle Mead, then named Plainville, was considered to be part of the community of Harlingen. It was a quiet farming region when about that time a New York City contractor named Van Aken bought up all the local farms and set out to develop a city. He had the farms laid out into lots, some streets put through and named after the style of New York. He donated land for the railroad station that had a dining room underneath (the station was torn down in February, 1940). There is an abandoned train station in Belle Mead. When Van Aken went broke, the property was sold to a U.S. Senator, John R. McPherson, who changed the name from Vanaken to Belle Mead in honor of his daughter, Edna Belle Mead McPherson, according to one popular story.

Woods Tavern in Belle Mead was a popular stop for travelers for more than 100 years and played an important social and political role. Horace Greeley spoke there in 1872 as part of his campaign for President of the United States. The tavern burned down in 1932.

The Belle Mead Army Depot was the nation&#x27;s largest military supply facility during WWII. The depot operated until 1991, and no buildings remain. Now a Superfund site, it is undergoing remediation and part is a county park. James Baldwin, the author and civil rights advocate, lived in Belle Mead in the early 1940s while working at the depot.

Dr. John Summerskill and his wife, Mimi LaFollette Summerskill established the LaFollette Vineyard in Belle Mead in the 1970s. President Bill Clinton and 14 Democratic governors met for a strategy session and press conference at the vineyard during the 1992 presidential campaign.

The abandoned train station was built by Reading Railroad in the 1930s, and was removed from service in 1984. Since then, restoration projects have been announced, but none have progressed any further than cleaning up tree debris and graffiti.

The Belle Mead section straddles the northern portion of Montgomery Township and the southern portion of Hillsborough Township. For many years residents of Belle Mead had been served by the Belle Mead Post Office located on Route 206 in Montgomery Township having ZIP code 08502. In the late 1990s, Hillsborough Township was granted its own post office serving all of its residents (ZIP code 08844), including that section of town formerly serving the Belle Mead area. Since that time the Belle Mead post office and its associated ZIP code (08502) serves only the remaining area of Belle Mead located in the northern section of Montgomery Township.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Belle Mead had a total area of 0.740 square miles (1.917 km2), all of which is land.

<text>Newcastle International Sports Centre, currently known as McDonald Jones Stadium for sponsorship reasons, is a multi-purpose sports stadium located in Newcastle, Australia. The ground is home to the Newcastle Knights (National Rugby League) and Newcastle Jets FC (A-League). It is owned by the Government of New South Wales and is administered by Venues NSW . Due to past sponsorship deals, the ground has been previously known as Marathon Stadium, [[EnergyAustralia]] Stadium, [[Ausgrid]] Stadium and Hunter Stadium. Newcastle International Sports Centre is also known as Newcastle Stadium when in use during AFC competitions due to conflicting sponsorship reasons.

==History==
Work began on the stadium on 1 December 1967, and was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 10 April 1970. It was originally known as the &quot;International Sports Centre&quot;, and is still part of the ISC complex to this day. The playing surface back then was originally oval shaped to allow both codes of rugby, soccer and cricket to be able to make use of it.

The Newcastle Knights secured a lease on the stadium in 1986, and converted it from an oval to a rectangle layout. During the 1988 Great Britain Lions tour, the Newcastle Knights, in their first season, hosted a match at the ground. On that occasion the Lions, captained by Ellery Hanley, defeated the Knights 28–12.

In 1992, local tyre outlet Marathon Tyres became the naming rights sponsor for the stadium, and it was renamed &quot;Marathon Stadium&quot;. That year the Knights played Great Britain for a second time as part of the Lions Tour of Australasia. The Ellery Hanley captained Lions took the Knights apart winning 22–0. Later in the 1992 NSWRL season, the Knights qualified for their first ever Finals series.

Towards the end of 2001, energy supplier EnergyAustralia took over naming rights, and thus the stadium became &quot;EnergyAustralia Stadium&quot;. In February 2011 it was announced that the stadium would be renamed Ausgrid Stadium after EnergyAustralia was renamed Ausgrid.

Before redevelopment, the stadium had a capacity of 28,000, including 5,000 in the main grandstand. The ground attendance record for a sporting event at the venue prior to the redevelopments is 32,642, which was set when the Knights took on the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in July 1995.

Following the retirement of former Knights captain Andrew Johns, the new eastern grandstand was renamed &quot;The Andrew Johns Stand&quot; in honour of Johns in front of a packed crowd before the Knights vs Brisbane Broncos NRL match on 22 April 2007.

The name (Newcastle International Sports Centre) is used primarily by those who wish to mention stadiums by original names, such as non-commercial organisations like the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and those with other corporate interests such as FIFA or the Asian Football Confederation.

On 16 October 2011, the venue&#x27;s all-time record sporting attendance was set with 32,890 attending the Australia vs New Zealand Rugby League test match.

In October 2016, McDonald Jones Homes, a local Newcastle company, was named as the new naming rights sponsor of the stadium. This new deal left behind a five year gap between naming rights sponsors at the ground.

===Redevelopments===
====2003–05====
The stadium underwent redevelopment during the years 2003–05, funded mostly by local and state government grants.

Factors that brought on the redevelopment included:
* non-compliance of National Rugby League (NRL) stadium criteria, especially the dressing rooms;
* failure to attract major sporting events to the area, specifically the 2003 Rugby World Cup;
* inadequate and ageing spectator and corporate facilities;
* covered seating capacity well below best practice and NRL standards;
* minimal areas within the grandstand to increase members&#x27; patronage both during a sporting event and on non-match-days;
* poor facilities for media officials;
* unsatisfactory temporary spectator facilities to the north and south of the western stand;
* the perceived need for the incumbent State Labor government to contribute to the public infrastructure in a region of safe seats.

The first stage of the redevelopment was completed in early 2004. This consisted of;
* The construction of the lower level of the Eastern Stand (brought into operation for the 2004 NRL season and Anzac Test between Australia and New Zealand). This level holds 7,700 people.
* The relocation of corporate boxes and seating to the North and South stands.

The second stage of construction began in 2004 and was completed in 2005. This consisted of:
* The construction of the Eastern Stand&#x27;s second level of seating and corporate boxes;
* a new video screen; and
* remedial work for the Western Grandstand, including updating the media facilities.

====2008–11====
During the 2007 NSW Election campaign, the Premier Morris Iemma promised $30 million towards an upgrade of the stadium, conditional on the Federal Government matching the funds.

On 1 April 2008 the federal government confirmed $10m towards the development of the Western Grandstand. This was in addition to the $30m commitment from the state government. This was a critical step for the stadium&#x27;s development for the upgrade to be in by 2011. The A$40 million contributed to an expansion of the stadium&#x27;s capacity to eventually hold over 40,000 as well as general improvements in the stadiums facilities.

From 2008 to 2010 the stadium was upgraded again to around 33 000 seats, with a hope for the stadium to be involved in the 2015 Asian Cup and 2018 World Cup were Australia be the host of those tournaments (Australia did host the Asian Cup, but not the World Cup). As part of the announcement, Morris Iemma stated that the capacity of 33,000 could be increased to the 40,000 necessary for World Cup Hosting, through temporary seating. The total cost of the upgrade was estimated as $60 million, with $50 million from the state government and $10 million from the Federal Government.
Although construction was slated to take place during both the Newcastle Knights and Newcastle Jets seasons, developers stated that there would be minimal effect on attendances due to the staged approach.

The stadium development was planned to be carried out over four stages.

*Stage 1 (now completed) included dressing, warm up and medical rooms, with showers, toilets, ice baths and 855-seats of the spectator concourse in the stadium&#x27;s south-west.
*Stage 2 (now completed) replicates Stage 1 on the northern side of the Western Grandstand and also included the main western stand&#x27;s lower concourse.
*Stage 3 (now completed) demolished the old western Grandstand and is replacing it with one similar to the eastern stand.
*Stage 4 (undertaking preparation) will involve building the northern and southern ends of the ground, replacing the grass hills with seated areas.

====Newcastle Knights Centre of Excellence====
In June 2018, plans were announced for a Centre of Excellence for the Newcastle Knights located at the southern end of the ground at a cost of $20 million with $10 million provided by the NSW government with the other $10 million funded by the Knights&#x27; owners The Wests Group.

====2024 upgrades====
Prior to the start of the 2024 NRL season, the two video screens at the ground were replaced with two 160sqm screens along with a series of minor upgrades to spectator facilities.

==Transport==
The nearest railway station is Broadmeadow. Newcastle Transport operate a shuttle service from Queens Wharf on match days.

==Uses==
===Rugby league===
The Newcastle Knights of the National Rugby League team have been tenants of the ground since their formation in 1988.

In October 2011 the ground hosted a rugby league one-off test match between Australia and New Zealand. This event set a new ground attendance record for a sporting event of 32,890.

===Soccer===
During the National Soccer League competition, three clubs have played their home ground games at this stadium. They are Newcastle KB United (1978–84); Newcastle Rosebud United (1984–86) and Newcastle United (2000–04). The NSL competition folded in 2004.

In 2005, the newly formed national competition (A-League) began to operate. Newcastle United Jets was part of the newly formed competition, and have played at this ground ever since.

The stadium also hosted two 2015 AFC Asian Cup group stage matches, and also a semi final between Australia and the United Arab Emirates and a third place playoff between United Arab Emirates and Iraq.

In February 2017 it was announced that the National Premier Leagues Northern NSW Grand Final would be taking place at the ground in September that year. In the Grand Final between the Edgeworth Eagles and Lambton Jaffas a crowd of 4174 was on hand to see the Jaffas clinch the title beating the Eagles 2–0 deep into Extra Time.

The 2018 A-League Grand Final was held at the venue, contested by the Newcastle Jets and Melbourne Victory, on 5 May 2018.

===Baseball===
The Hunter Eagles were formed for the 1994–95 Australian Baseball League season after purchasing the Sydney Wave&#x27;s licence. The Eagles played in the Australian Baseball League until the end of the 1997–98 season.

===Rugby union===
In 2012, it was used for the first match of the 2012 Scotland rugby union tour of Oceania. Scotland won the match, beating Australia 9–6.

<text>Thiepval Barracks is a British Army barracks and headquarters in Lisburn, County Antrim. It is also the site of the stone frigate HMS &quot;Hibernia&quot;, Headquarters of the Royal Naval Reserve in Northern Ireland.

==History==
The barracks were built in 1940. They are named after the village of Thiepval in northern France, an important site in the Battle of the Somme and site of the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme.

From 1954, the barracks contained the operational headquarters of No 31 Belfast Group Royal Observer Corps (ROC) who operated from a protected nuclear bunker on Knox Road within Thiepval Barracks. Converted from a 1940s anti-aircraft operations room (AAOR), the bunker would support over one hundred ROC volunteers and a ten-man United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation warning team, responsible for the famous four-minute warning in the event of a nuclear strike on the UK. The ROC would also detect radioactive fallout from the nuclear bursts and warn the public of approaching fallout. The two organisations were stood down at the end of the Cold War.

In early 1970, the barracks also became home to 39 Infantry Brigade and provided the headquarters for the Ulster Defence Regiment. The brigade, as 39 Airportable Brigade, was involved in The Troubles in Northern Ireland, eventually taking on responsibility under HQ Northern Ireland for an area including Belfast and the eastern side of the province, but excluding the South Armagh border region. For most of the conflict, signals support for the brigade was provided by 213 Signal Squadron. From September 1970, the brigade was commanded by (then) Brigadier Frank Kitson.

On 7 October 1996 the Provisional Irish Republican Army penetrated the heavily fortified base to detonate two car bombs. The first detonated at 15:35 GMT followed by the second around ten minutes later close to the base&#x27;s medical facilities where victims were gathering. Warrant Officer James Bradwell (43) was killed and 21 soldiers and 10 civilians were injured. This bombing was the first major attack on a military base in Northern Ireland since the ending of the IRA&#x27;s ceasefire with the 1996 Docklands bombing.

The 39 Infantry Brigade took on some units from 3 Brigade when that brigade was disbanded on 1 September 2004. The HQ 8 Infantry Brigade, based in Shackleton Barracks, Ballykelly, County Londonderry, was disbanded and handed over responsibility to HQ 39 Infantry Brigade at Thiepval Barracks on 1 September 2006.

On 1 August 2007, the brigade was amalgamated with 107 (Ulster) Brigade when the new non-deployable brigade HQ, the 38 (Irish) Brigade, was formed in the province.

=== HMS &quot;Hibernia&quot; ===
HMS &quot;Hibernia&quot; is the name given to a stone frigate of the Royal Navy, which serves as the headquarters of the Royal Naval Reserve in Northern Ireland and is Northern Ireland&#x27;s only Royal Navy stone frigate. It was commissioned in 2009 to replace the C-class cruiser as the training establishment for the RNR in Northern Ireland, &quot;Hibernia&quot; is located within Thiepval Barracks. The unit numbers approximately 100 officers and ratings and is also home to University Royal Naval Unit (URNU) Belfast.

<text>Geeta Zutshi (born 2 December 1956) is a former Indian track and field athlete. She established several national and Asian running records in the 800 metres and 1500 metres events.

Zutshi won the women&#x27;s silver medals for the 800 m in 1982, and for the 1500 m in both 1978 and 1982. As the top Indian woman athlete at the 1982 Asian Games in New Delhi, she took the oath on behalf of the competitors during the opening ceremony. For her achievements she has been awarded the Arjuna award and the Padma Shri.

She has inspired other Indian women, such as Bachendri Pal, the first Indian woman to successfully climb Mount Everest. As a child, Pal began to aspire to national fame after seeing a newspaper photograph of Zutshi with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.

She was coached by Mohammad Ilyas Babar. After 17 years in the United States, she returned to India in July, 2002, and took over as coach of the Indian junior athletics team (800 m and 1500 m).

<doc id="1305252" wikidata="Q5533719" url="?curid=1305252" title="Reg Vermue">
<text>Reginald Vermue is a Canadian indie rock singer from Guelph, Ontario. Born in Trenton, Ontario, he has recorded music under the stage names Gentleman Reg and Regina Gently. His musical style has been compared to Elliott Smith, Aimee Mann, The Smiths and Cat Power. He had a cameo role in the 2006 film &quot;Shortbus&quot;.

Most recently he began performing with a new band called Light Fires with James Bunton from the band Ohbijou, debuting songs in October 2010 at Pop Montreal. In Light Fires, Vermue performs in drag, adopting the alternate persona Regina Gently.

==Career==
His first album, &quot;The Theoretical Girl&quot;, was released in 2000 on Three Gut Records. He released two more albums, &quot;Make Me Pretty&quot; in 2002 and &quot;Darby &amp; Joan&quot; in 2004, on Three Gut before the label dissolved in 2005.

He subsequently signed to Arts &amp; Crafts in 2008. His first release for that label, &quot;Little Buildings&quot; in 2008, was a compilation of tracks from his Three Gut albums. The album was created for release in the United States, where his earlier albums had never secured wide distribution. At the same time, he also released &quot;You Can&#x27;t Get it Back&quot;, an advance single from his first album of new material for Arts &amp; Crafts, &quot;Jet Black&quot;, which was released in full on 24 February 2009. &quot;Jet Black &quot; was the first proper studio album that he released in the United States.

Members of Royal City and The Constantines have regularly appeared as Vermue&#x27;s band, live and on recordings, as well as long-time drummer Greg Millson, who now performs with Great Lake Swimmers. Vermue was also a member of The Hidden Cameras for several years and has performed with Broken Social Scene, sung backup for Sufjan Stevens, and often guests with Owen Pallett. He also appeared on a tribute CD for The Breeders, &quot;Hellbound&quot;, performing the song &quot;Doe&quot;.

Songs by Gentleman Reg have appeared in such films as &quot;Shortbus&quot;, &quot;Wilby Wonderful&quot;, &quot;Twist&quot;, &quot;The End of Silence&quot;, &quot;Late Fragment&quot;, and on the television show &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;.

Vermue, who is openly gay, appears in a cameo role in the 2006 John Cameron Mitchell film &quot;Shortbus&quot;. In it, his character claims to be an albino — although Vermue is fair-skinned and has very light blond hair, he is not in fact an albino. Songs by Gentleman Reg are featured on the soundtrack of the film.

In 2019 Vermue released &quot;Good People&quot;, the first single to be credited to Regina Gently as a solo act. The following year he released &quot;Don&#x27;t Wait to Love Me&quot;, the first full-length Regina Gently album.

<text>Swami Lakshman Joo (9 May 1907 – 27 September 1991), born Lakshman Raina and also called Lal Sahib by his followers, was a mystic and scholar of Kashmir Shaivism.

== Biography ==
Lakshman Joo was born in a Kashmiri Hindu Brahmin family in the city of Srinagar in Kashmir. He was the fifth child in a household of four boys and five girls. 

His mother&#x27;s name was Arnyamali Raina.

At the age of five he was introduced to the path of spirituality by his elder brother Maheshvaranath. Up to the age of eight his spiritual progress in the lineage of Kashmiri Shaivam was monitored by his family priest, Pandit Swami Ram Joo (1854-1915), and later by his chief disciple Swami Mehatab Kak (1870?-1942). At the age of 19, it is said, he experienced a clear taste of Self-realisation. Shortly afterwards he left home, as he wrote, &quot;in search of the Supreme&quot; and moved to the famous ashram of Sadhamalyun (Sadhuganga) in Handwara. Persuaded by his father to return to Srinagar, he continued to study Sanskrit and Shaiva philosophy under the guidance of a scholar named Maheshwar Razdan.

From 1934 to 1935, Lakshman Joo moved to an isolated place above the village of Gupta Ganga near Nishat suburb of Srinagar where his parents built him a house. This was where Abhinavagupta had lived nine centuries ago. In 1962 he moved down the hill to a place closer to the famous Dal Lake a few hundred metres from the Nishat Gardens. Around the age of 30 Lakshman Joo traveled in India, spending time on a Mumbai beach and a short time with Mahatma Gandhi at Sevagram and then with Sri Aurobindo at Pondicherry. From there he found his way to Tiruvannamalai to meet Ramana Maharshi. There he spent some weeks and later commented; &quot;I felt those golden days were indeed divine&quot;.

Little was known about the Swami for almost three decades (1930-1960), as it was his habit to spend the winter months in silence and seclusion. Still, in the summer he had occasional visits from both scholars and saints. The Indian Spiritual Master Meher Baba visited his ashram in 1944. In 1948 Lilian Silburn from the National Centre for Scientific Research, Paris, visited the Swami. She would return regularly for the next ten years, during which time she studied the major texts of Kashmir Shaiva philosophy, all of which were published in French. It was through Silburn that André Padoux, another prolific scholar of Kashmir Shaivism came to meet the Swami. Paul Reps, the American artist, author and poet stumbled across the Ashram in 1957. With Swami Lakshmanjoo he studied the ancient text of &quot;Vijnana Bhairava Tantra&quot;, and later published the 112 practices of transcending in the fourth chapter of his book &quot;Zen Flesh, Zen Bones&quot;. This teaching also influenced Osho, and formed the basis of &quot;The Book of Secrets&quot;.

It was a few years later, in 1965, after attending a Sanskrit conference in Varanasi, chaired by the renowned Sanskrit Tantra scholar Gopinath Kaviraj, that the word quickly spread that the tradition of Kashmir Shaivism was alive and well, and fully embodied in the person of Swami Lakshman Joo. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi visited the Swami each summer from 1966 to 1969. The two saints formed a lasting relationship. Baba Muktananda, of Siddha Yoga also visited on two occasions. Until his death in 1991, Swami Lakshmanjoo freely taught, giving weekly lectures on the mystical and philosophical texts of Kashmir Shaivism. Many of these lectures were audio recorded by John Hughes and later published. Lakshman Joo&#x27;s interpretation of Kashmir Shavism attracted the attention of both Indian and western Indologists. The Swami has correspondence with Professor Giuseppe Tucci of the University of Rome La Sapienza, and his regular visitors included scholars, such as, Jaideva Singh, Professor Nilkanth Gurtoo, Acharya Rameshwar Jha, Jankinath Kaul &quot;Kamal&quot;, Raniero Gnoli, Alexis Sanderson and Mark Dyczkowski.

In 1991 the Swami traveled to the United States and established the Universal Shaiva Fellowship where he designated John Hughes and his wife Denise to continue publishing his teachings of Kashmir Shaivism. In India the teachings of Lakshman Joo are carried on by Ishwar Ashram Trust, an organisation founded shortly after his death.

<text>The North End of Halifax is a neighbourhood of Halifax, Nova Scotia occupying the northern part of Halifax Peninsula immediately north of Downtown Halifax.

==History==

Prior to European colonization, the Mi&#x27;kmaq inhabited the land throughout Atlantic Canada and Northern Maine.

The North End of Halifax began as an agricultural expansion north from central Halifax as African American and German Foreign Protestant settlers arrived in the province.

It became the focus of industry in Halifax with the construction of the Nova Scotia Railway in the 1850s which located its terminal in the North End. Factories such as the Nova Scotia Cotton Manufacturing Company, Hillis &amp; Sons Foundry, and the Acadia Sugar Refinery, made the North End the focus of manufacturing in Halifax. Railway growth intensified with the extension of railways further into the North End and construction of the North Street Station in 1878, the largest station east of Montreal. Wharves warehouses lined the waterfront, along with the city&#x27;s prison at Rockhead and major defence installations such as HMC Dockyard and Stadacona (formerly HMCS Stadacona and Wellington Barracks, now part of CFB Halifax).

On 6 December 1917, the Halifax Explosion damaged and destroyed much of the North End. The explosion&#x27;s aftermath saw the area north of North Street razed, and a new street grid was superimposed over the old street patterns. New residential construction saw the creation of the Hydrostone neighbourhood, built during the relief construction following the disaster. Today the memorial bells at Fort Needham, which were recovered from a church that didn&#x27;t survive the event, may be heard in the carillon and monument to the disaster. The Memorial was designed by Nova Scotia architect Keith L. Graham. The Halifax Shipyard was built in 1918 beside the Naval Dockyard, further entrenching the industrial character of the North End.

The area once included historic Africville. A former African-Canadian community settled by African slaves coming to Canada, it was located on the shores of the Bedford Basin within the North End. A consequence of the Halifax Explosion, the community was damaged on 6 December 1917. In January 1964, the City Council of Halifax voted to relocate the residents of the community. The municipal government justified the destruction of Africville by citing the poor living conditions of the community, despite having historically refused to extend those services to the community. The community was torn down in the 1960s preceding a proposed urban redevelopment of the region which would see new highways and the construction of the A. Murray MacKay Bridge, although the lands of the community were never used in a proposed port expansion. In the ensuing controversy it was designated as parkland. The Africville expropriation is often characterized as an example of institutional racism in Halifax. Descendants and residents of Africville were dispersed among some of the North End&#x27;s public housing projects, as well as into other communities throughout the urban area, and beyond. Seaview Park on the Bedford Basin is the site of Africville

The North End has traditionally been home to a number of important African Nova Scotian institutions. Provincial institutions like the African United Baptist Association and the Nova Scotia Association for the Advancement of Colored People were formed in the North End at New Horizons Baptist Church. Throughout the 20th century, Gottingen Street was the epicenter for black business and enterprise in Nova Scotia, including being home to a beauty shop and school owned by Viola Desmond. The North End housed one of the first Afrocentric schools in Canada, St. Patrick&#x27;s-Alexandra School (closed in 2011). A neighbourhood with strong African Nova Scotian roots, the area has undergone gentrification in recent years. As a result, the proportion of Black residents in the neighbourhood has fallen from 30% in 2006 to 15% in 2016.

In 1966, the Halifax North Memorial Public Library was opened in memory of the victims of the explosion. Located on at 2285 Gottingen Street.

==Geography==


By the end of the 19th century, the perception of the North End had come to generally include Richmond as well. Following its total destruction in the Halifax Explosion, Richmond never again regained its individual identity. The area underwent significant redevelopment during the inter-war period and gradually became an extension of the original North End.

The northern part of the Halifax Peninsula comprises thin soil resulting from glacial deposits, as well as outcroppings of a dark sedimentary shale known as ironstone. The entire peninsula has no significant surface water, unlike the areas northeast and southwest of Halifax Harbour (the Eastern Shore and South Shore respectively).

At in elevation, Citadel Hill is the highest point on the peninsula and when combined with the expansive undeveloped parkland of the North Common, creates a physical boundary that separates the various neighbourhoods. Fort Needham is another glacial drumlin located in the heart of the North End.

The neighbourhood referred to as the &quot;North End&quot; by Halifax residents was bounded by the north of the Bedford Basin, and on the east by &quot;The Narrows&quot; of Halifax Harbour. Its other boundaries as not as sharply defined, but the western limit of the neighbourhood is generally agreed to be Windsor street. The southern boundary was, traditionally, the northern limit of the original settlement of Halifax along the slope of Citadel Hill (now Cogswell Street), and continuing along the northern edge of the North Common to Quinpool Road. The northern boundary has steadily migrated toward the Bedford Basin since Halifax&#x27;s founding. The boundary originally ended at North Street, just as the South End ended at South Street. A neighbourhood further to the north was Richmond, and was located on the eastern slope of Fort Needham. Further north of Richmond, at the end of the Campbell Road, was the former community of Africville.

==Culture==
The areas of Creighton Street, Gottingen Street, and Maynard Street were traditionally home to a large middle-class African Canadian population, while lower-income families lived nearby in Uniacke Square. Many of the black home owners operated businesses, or were working professionals. The North End has long been seen as a center of commerce, education, entertainment, and religion among African Nova Scotians. However, uncontrolled gentrification of the North End has changed the area&#x27;s demographics considerably.

In recent years, the North End has become a popular destination for Halifax&#x27;s growing university population. As the prices of apartments closer to Dalhousie University and Saint Mary&#x27;s University continue to rise, and as the cost of transportation has fallen due to the introduction of the U-pass, students are finding cheaper accommodations in the North End. This has spawned a thriving artistic community, with many musicians, painters, and writers lured to this neighbourhood, at the expense of some long time residents. There is still a Black presence in the community, although it is shrinking and for the most part limited to the confines of the public housing surrounding Uniacke Square. As of 2019, only a handful of homes are still owned by Black families.

The area has become home to organizations such as the Bloomfield Centre, Grainery Food Co-Op, Turnstile Pottery Cooperative, the North End Community Gardening Association, Anchor Archive Zine Library, North By North End, and the Nova Scotia Youth Project. Plans are now under way for the redevelopment of Bloomfield Centre.

===Historic buildings===
The Halifax Armoury, on North Park Street, is a National Historic Site. The massive Romanesque Revival building resembles an old castle, but it boasted numerous technological innovations when it opened in 1899, including the adoption of electricity and the truss structure that permitted a large interior space with no columns or walls. HMCS Stadacona is home to numerous other historic military buildings.

The North End is also home to the Halifax Shipyard, sited just to the north of HMC Dockyard. Founded in 1889, the shipyard has built many vessels for the Royal Canadian Navy and is the largest full-service shipyard on the east coast. In 2011 the shipyard was selected to build the navy&#x27;s new combat fleet, comprising 21 vessels costing $25 billion over a period of 30 years. Irving Shipbuilding, owner of the shipyard, has undertaken a $300 million upgrade of the facility, boasting that Halifax will have &quot;the most modern shipyard in North America&quot;. The shipbuilding contract is expected to employ between 2,000 and 2,500 people at the height of construction in 2021.

The North End is home to several historic churches. The Little Dutch Church, adapted as a church in 1756, is the second-oldest building in the municipality. St. George&#x27;s Church is a unique round church at the corner of Brunswick and Cornwallis Streets completed in 1801. After St. George&#x27;s Church was badly burned in an accidental 1994 fire, Prince Charles, who had visited it in 1983 with Princess Diana, was among those who donated toward its reconstruction. The restoration was completed in 2000. 

St Patrick&#x27;s Church, also on Brunswick Street, was founded in 1843 and rebuilt in its present form in 1885.

The Africville Church, established in 1849 and razed under cover of darkness in 1969, was reconstructed in 2011 as part of the Africville Apology.

===Military installations===

The North End is home to several of military installations within CFB Halifax, the country&#x27;s largest military base. His Majesty&#x27;s Canadian Dockyard (HMC Dockyard Halifax) is a sprawling complex that occupies the harbourfront area next to the traditional North End. Stadacona, on the opposite side of Barrington Street, is host to barracks and a host of supporting facilities housed in both historic and modern structures. In the centre of the peninsula, away from the shoreline, Windsor Park and Willow Park are home to base transport and supply, housing, the Canadian Forces Exchange System, the curling club, the Military Police, and the Military Family Resource Centre.

==Demographics==
The Gottingen Street area population declined from high of 11,939 people in 1951, to a low of 4,494 people in 1996. However, in recent years the trend has reversed as more housing is built in the area and as vacant lots have been developed. The population has risen substantially since the 1996 Census, resulting in an ever-more diverse neighbourhood.

==Economy==

Gottingen Street is the commercial and entertainment heart of the North End, and is home to numerous shops, bars, clubs, and performance venues. In 1950, the four blocks of Gottingen closest to downtown were the site of more than 130 enterprises, including two cinemas. The street declined in stature as the peninsula lost population during the latter half of the 20th century, and as a result of car-oriented urban renewal schemes. Many nearby residences were demolished when the northern part of Barrington Street was transformed into a highway to serve the Macdonald Bridge, and when the Cogswell Interchange was built. In 1958, several blocks of houses and apartment buildings were demolished in an attempt to boost patronage on Gottingen by providing additional car parking. Seven new parking lots were built, displacing local residents to other areas, but according to a Dalhousie University study, this had &quot;no positive impact on the vitality of the Gottingen Street commercial district&quot;.

Agricola Street, which runs parallel to Gottingen Street, is a commercial district home to many local galleries, restaurants, and shops. It has also benefited from new residential developments that have increased the local population.

Businesses of The Hydrostone serve as the commercial centre of the northern half of the North End.

==Transportation==
The North End, located on the Peninsula, is served well by public transportation.

<doc id="1305275" wikidata="Q2815107" url="?curid=1305275" title="Myakka River State Park">
<text>Myakka River State Park is a Florida State Park, that is located east of Interstate 75 in Sarasota County and a portion of southeastern Manatee County on the Atlantic coastal plain. This state park consists of , making it one of the state&#x27;s largest parks. It is also one of the oldest parks in the state. It was delineated in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps. A small portion () of the park was the gift of the family of Bertha Palmer to the state. The park is managed and maintained by the Florida Department of Environment Protection&#x27;s Division of Recreation and Parks, with help from the Friends of Myakka River. The park is named after the Myakka River, Florida&#x27;s first &quot;Wild and Scenic River.&quot;

==Environment==
Myakka River State Park is in the southeastern conifer forests ecoregion. Plant communities in areas of the park with drier soils are a mixture of pine forests, scrubby flatwoods, and dry prairies. Florida longleaf pine flatwoods are woodlands dominated by longleaf pine (&quot;Pinus palustris&quot;). South Florida pine flatwoods are open woodlands of (&quot;Pinus elliottii&quot; var. &quot;densa&quot;) with a dense ground cover of grasses and shrubs. Florida dry prairies are flat, nearly treeless plains with dense cover of grasses, forbs, saw palmetto (&quot;Serenoa repens&quot;) and other low shrubs

Wetlands in the park include marshes and forested wetlands. Floridian highlands freshwater marshes are depression marshes composed of different herbaceous plant communities that vary based on water depth. Southern coastal plain nonriverine cypress domes are small wetlands of bald cypress (&quot;Taxodium distichum&quot;) notable for their dome-shaped appearance.

A karst sinkhole named Deep Hole is located on the northwest bank of the Myakka River in the Wilderness Preserve. The sink is deep though no evidence of a spring was found by a 2011–2012 research team.

Rivers in the park support hammocks and floodplain forests. Near the floodplains of spring-fed rivers grow southern coastal plain hydric hammocks, dense forests of evergreen and deciduous hardwood trees. Blackwater rivers support southern coastal plain blackwater river floodplain forests of baldcypress along their banks.

===Climate===
== Things to do ==

The park is noted for its wildlife and some of the rare birds seen only in Florida, such as the roseate spoonbill, frequent the park. Native flora flourishes in the park. There are many species of fish, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals to learn about and enjoy watching as well.

Myakka River State Park has an excellent system of hiking trails. Walking trails crisscross the eastern side of the park.

Six primitive campgrounds are accessible by trail throughout the park: Mossy Hammock, Bee Island, Panther Point, Honore, Oak Grove and Prairie.

Horseback riding and biking is permitted on certain designated trails and roads in the park. This part of the park is dominated by expanses of very low vegetation, fields of palmetto, that make a transition to islands, or hammocks, of tall pine and oak trees.

A good portion of the park is accessible by automobile. Myakka River State Park&#x27;s main road, a drive between the north and south ends, leads visitors to a boardwalk out to the river and a lake that is excellent for bird watching.

The main drive is also popular with cyclists, runners, and skaters. Bicycle traffic can be heavy, especially on weekends and holidays.

A short walk from the main road reveals Myakka&#x27;s canopy walkway, which is North America&#x27;s first public treetop trail and is a novel suspension bridge and tower providing researchers and visitors with views of the forest canopy and a spectacular above-the-treetops view of the entire park. The walkway is suspended 25 feet above the ground and 100 feet through the hammock canopy, with the tower soaring 74 feet in the air. 

Picnic areas, canoeing, boat tours, and developed campsites are available, as well as an outpost, which contains bike and canoe rentals, a souvenir shop, a camping supply store, and the Pink Gator Cafe. 

The park even has five cabins that were built not with logs, but with the trunks of native sabal palms.

== History ==
In 1843, a European surveyor by the name of Sam Reid encountered a group of Seminoles who told him the river he encountered was called the &quot;Miarca,&quot; which was later spelled on maps as Myakka, as well as the headwaters of the river were called &quot;Locha-notia,&quot; which translates to &quot;sleeping turtle.&quot; Between the 1850s and 1930s, settlers established cattle to the region and much of the cattle was used for beef in the Civil War. In 1910, Bertha Palmer, a Chicagoan businesswoman, bought a vast amount of land near the Myakka River for cattle and swine ranching. During the Great Depression, President Roosevelt signed the New Deal and funded the Civilian Conservation Corps, where Palmer&#x27;s land was gifted to be developed into a state park. The Myakka River State Park officially opened in 1941.

<doc id="1305280" wikidata="Q4959444" url="?curid=1305280" title="The Gardens Greyhound and Sporting Complex">
<text>Ladbrokes Gardens is an Australian stadium located in Newcastle, New South Wales. The complex is known as Newcastle Greyhounds when it was used as a greyhound racing venue. It was the former home of the Newcastle Breakers, who played in the National Soccer League (NSL) from 1991 until 2000. It was also the home ground of the short-lived Hunter Mariners rugby league team, who participated in the only season of the Super League in 1997. The stadium is currently used by soccer team Wallsend FC.

==History==
The ground was primarily used for soccer, hosting the Newcastle Breakers during their tenure in the National Soccer League. It was later used by rugby league team Hunter Mariners. Despite redevelopment in 2005 and 2006 which added a greyhound running track, the stadium is still used for soccer and rugby league with Wallsend FC a current tenant.
===Naming===
The stadium was named Breakers Stadium after the Newcastle Breakers. In the early 1990s it was sponsored by hardware chain Mitre 10 and known as Mitre 10 Stadium. In the mid-1990s, sports manufacturer Topper sponsored both the team and the ground, and was known as &quot;Topper Stadium&quot;. When the company went into administration, it withdrew its sponsorship, and it reverted to its original name. The stadium became known as the Gardens Greyhound &amp; Sporting Complex, and is also referred to as Newcastle Greyhounds.

==Structure and facilities==
The single stand on the eastern side holds 2,000 general viewing seats with corporate facilities behind. It also has a restaurant/bistro below the stadium and change rooms for the sport teams that play there.

<doc id="1305286" wikidata="Q1785329" url="?curid=1305286" title="Nickelodeon Movies">
<text>Nickelodeon Movies Inc. is an American film production company based in Los Angeles, California and owned by Paramount Global. Originally founded in 1995, it serves as both the film production arm of the American children&#x27;s network Nickelodeon and the family film distribution label of Paramount Pictures.

The division has earned numerous accolades including two Academy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, over 13 Saturn Awards nominations, a People&#x27;s Choice Award and four in-house honors via the Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards. Since its launch, over 40 feature films have been produced for theatrical release and starting in October 2021, the studio has been producing films for streaming on Paramount+ and Netflix.

==History==
===1993–95: Nickelodeon/20th Century Fox deal===
In 1993, Nickelodeon agreed to a two-year contract with 20th Century Fox to make feature films. The joint venture would mostly produce new material, though a Nickelodeon executive did not rule out the possibility of making films based on &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;, &quot;Rugrats&quot; and &quot;Doug&quot;. None of the movies were produced due to the 1994 acquisition of Paramount Pictures by Nickelodeon&#x27;s parent company, Viacom, and they would distribute the movies instead. With the creative differences with John Kricfalusi, the creator of &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; and an inability to market that property in a family-friendly manner instead of a &quot;cynical and gross humor&quot; scuttled the film. However, Paramount and Viacom would go forward and start development on &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot; a year after the acquisition.

The Nickelodeon version of the &quot;Doug&quot; film was not made due to the acquisition of the show&#x27;s production studio, Jumbo Pictures, by The Walt Disney Company in 1996. With this, the show moved to Disney&#x27;s ABC network and new seasons aired as a part of its programming block &quot;Disney&#x27;s One Saturday Morning&quot; as &quot;Disney&#x27;s Doug&quot;. In 1999, Walt Disney Pictures released a film finale to the series, &quot;Doug&#x27;s 1st Movie&quot;.

===1995–99: Founding and early years===
Nickelodeon Movies was then founded on February 25, 1995. On July 10, 1996, the studio released its first film, &quot;Harriet the Spy&quot;, a spy-comedy film based on the 1964 novel of the same name.

On July 25, 1997, the studio released its second film, &quot;Good Burger&quot;, a comedy film, starring Kenan Thompson, Kel Mitchell, Abe Vigoda, Dan Schneider, Shar Jackson, Josh Server, Lori Beth Denberg, Jan Schweiterman, Linda Cardellini and Sinbad. It was based on the &quot;Good Burger&quot; sketch on Nickelodeon&#x27;s popular sketch comedy series &quot;All That&quot;.

On November 20, 1998, the studio released &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot;, which was Nickelodeon Movies&#x27; first animated film and the first Nicktoon to be shown in theaters. It received mixed critical reception, but despite this, the movie became a box office success, becoming the first animated film not released by Disney to ever gross over $100 million domestically. The success of the film led to two sequels.

===2000s===

On February 11, 2000, the studio released &quot;Snow Day&quot;, a comedy film starring Chevy Chase, Chris Elliott, Zena Grey, Josh Peck, Mark Webber, Schuyler Fisk, Jade Yorker and Emmanuelle Chriqui. This film met negative reviews, yet it grossed $62,464,731 worldwide. Nine months later, the studio released &quot;Rugrats in Paris: The Movie&quot; on November 17, 2000. It was the first sequel to &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot; and grossed $76,507,756 at the domestic box-office and $103,291,131 worldwide. The film received favorable reviews, becoming the most critically acclaimed &quot;Rugrats&quot; film to date.

On December 21, 2001, the studio released its first CGI-animated film, &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot;. It was based on a series of shorts that aired on Nickelodeon in 1998. It became a critical and box office success, earning $80,936,232 in the United States and $102,992,536 worldwide. It stars voice actors Debi Derryberry, Rob Paulsen, Carolyn Lawrence, Jeffrey Garcia, and Candi Milo, and co-starred Martin Short and Patrick Stewart. On March 24, 2002, &quot;Jimmy Neutron&quot; was nominated for the first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, but lost to &quot;Shrek&quot;. It was the first Nickelodeon film to be nominated for an Academy Award. The success of the film spawned a TV series, &quot;The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot;, which aired on Nickelodeon from 2002 to 2006.

On March 29, 2002, the studio released &quot;Clockstoppers&quot;, a sci-fi action film, starring Jesse Bradford, Paula Garcés, and French Stewart. This film received mixed-to-negative reviews and failed to make back its budget in theatres. On June 28, Nickelodeon Movies released &quot;Hey Arnold!: The Movie&quot;, starring the series&#x27; original cast members and guest starring Paul Sorvino as Scheck, the CEO of a real estate company called Future Tech Industries. The film received negative reviews and grossed a small profit of $15.2 million. It was originally going to be a TV film entitled &quot;Arnold Saves the Neighborhood&quot;, but executives of Paramount Pictures decided to release this film theatrically. It was the first animated film from Nickelodeon to get a PG rating.

In 2002 and 2003, the studio, along with Klasky Csupo, released two films based on popular TV shows, &quot;The Wild Thornberrys Movie&quot; and &quot;Rugrats Go Wild&quot;, respectively. &quot;The Wild Thornberrys Movie&quot; was released on December 20, 2002, starring the show&#x27;s original cast members, Lacey Chabert, Tim Curry, Jodi Carlisle, Danielle Harris, Michael &quot;Flea&quot; Balzary, and Tom Kane. This film received positive reviews and was a moderate box office success, grossing $40.1 million domestically and $60.7 million worldwide. On March 23, 2003, this film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. &quot;Rugrats Go Wild&quot;, a crossover of &quot;Rugrats&quot; and &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot;, was released on June 13, 2003. This film met with negative critical reception and was a minor box office success, unlike previous &quot;Rugrats&quot; movies, earning $39.4 million in the United States and $55.4 million worldwide. This film is also the only &quot;Rugrats&quot; film to receive a PG rating.

On November 19, 2004, Nickelodeon released &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot;, based on the popular Nickelodeon television series, &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. This film received positive reviews and grossed $85.4 million in the United States and $140.2 million worldwide. The success of this film led to a sequel, and it was adapted into various media, including its own video game, soundtrack, books, and toy line.

Nickelodeon Movies had purchased the film rights of the &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; book series in May 2000. Paramount Pictures, owner of Nickelodeon Movies, agreed to co-finance, along with Scott Rudin. Various directors, including Terry Gilliam and Roman Polanski, were interested in making the film. One of author Daniel Handler&#x27;s, Lemony Snicket&#x27;s real name, favorite candidates was Guy Maddin. In June 2002, Barry Sonnenfeld was hired to direct. He was chosen because he had previously collaborated with Rudin and because of his black comedy directing style as seen in his films &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; and &quot;Get Shorty&quot;. Sonnenfeld referred to the &quot;Unfortunate Events&quot; books as his favorite children&#x27;s stories. The director hired Handler to write the script with the intention of making &quot;Lemony Snicket&quot; as a musical, and cast Jim Carrey as Count Olaf in September 2002. Sonnenfeld eventually left over budget concerns in January 2003 and director Brad Silberling took over. This film was released on December 17, 2004, a month after &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot; was released, and received positive reviews despite not making back its budget. This film won the Academy Award for Best Makeup in 2005, becoming the first film from Nickelodeon Movies to win an Academy Award.

In 2005, the studio and Paramount Classics purchased a documentary film, &quot;Mad Hot Ballroom&quot;, at the 2005 Slamdance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. It became the studios&#x27; first (and so far only) documentary film, the first Nickelodeon feature to be released outside of the main Paramount Pictures label, and their only film to have a limited theatrical release. The movie made back its&#x27; low budget and was also a critical success.

Several months later, the studio and Paramount Pictures released their first co-production with both Columbia Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and released a family comedy film, &quot;Yours, Mine and Ours&quot;, a remake of the 1968 film of the same name. This film stars Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo. This film was critically panned and failed to make a profit in theatres.

On June 16, 2006, Nickelodeon released the wrestling comedy film &quot;Nacho Libre&quot;. It was very loosely based on the story of Fray Tormenta. This film stars Jack Black, Héctor Jiménez, and Ana de la Reguera. This film met with mixed critical reception, but was a box office success, earning $80,197,993 in the domestic box office and grossed $99,255,460 worldwide. A sequel to this film is being considered.

Two months later, the studio released another animated film, &quot;Barnyard&quot;, starring the voices of Kevin James, as Otis, a carefree cow who loves throwing parties, Courteney Cox as Daisy, a kind-hearted cow, David Koechner as Dag, an evil coyote, Sam Elliott as Ben, Otis&#x27;s father and the leader of the barnyard, Danny Glover as Miles, an old mule, among other Los Angeles voice actors. This film met with negative critical reception, but was a moderate box office success, earning $72,637,803 at the United States box office and grossed $116,476,887 worldwide. Like &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot;, the film&#x27;s success has spawned into a TV show, &quot;Back at the Barnyard&quot;, which ran from 2007 to 2011 on Nickelodeon, longer than &quot;The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot;. Chris Hardwick replaced Kevin James as the role for Otis.

On December 15, 2006, the studio released &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot;, a family drama film based on E. B. White&#x27;s book of the same name, starring Dakota Fanning, Kevin Anderson, Beau Bridges, and the voices of Dominic Scott Kay, Julia Roberts, Steve Buscemi, John Cleese, Oprah Winfrey, Robert Redford, Reba McEntire, Kathy Bates, with Thomas Haden Church and Cedric the Entertainer. This film became a critical and box office success, earning $82,985,708 in the United States and $144,877,632 worldwide. This was Nickelodeon&#x27;s first G-rated film in five years and first live-action film rated G, as well as the studio&#x27;s highest-grossing film with that rating. Dakota Fanning won a Blimp Award for Favorite Movie Actress at the 2007 Kids&#x27; Choice Awards.

Two years later, on February 14, 2008, the studio released &quot;The Spiderwick Chronicles&quot;, a fantasy drama film based on the bestselling book of the same name, starring Freddie Highmore, Sarah Bolger, Mary-Louise Parker, Martin Short, Nick Nolte, and Seth Rogen. This film was released in both regular and IMAX theaters and received favorable reviews and was a box office success, earning $71,195,053 in the United States and $162,839,667 outside of the United States.

On July 28, 2008, Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies released a coming-of-age comedy film, &quot;Angus, Thongs, and Perfect Snogging&quot;, based on two bestselling British novels by Louise Rennison, &quot;Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s OK, I&#x27;m Wearing Really Big Knickers&quot;. The film met with positive reviews and was a box office success. It was released in theaters in the United Kingdom, earning £8,647,770 and grossed £13,835,569 worldwide. To date, it has a direct-to-DVD release in the United States and has made its U.S. premiere on Nick at Nite on March 12, 2009. It was also the first film from Nickelodeon Movies to receive a PG-13 rating.

On January 16, 2009, &quot;Hotel for Dogs&quot; was released under Paramount&#x27;s DreamWorks label, starring Emma Roberts, Jake T. Austin, Johnny Simmons, Kyla Pratt, Troy Gentile, with Lisa Kudrow, Kevin Dillon and Don Cheadle. It was based on the 1971 novel of the same name by Lois Duncan. This film received mixed reviews from film critics, but was a box office success, earning $73,034,460 in the United States box office and grossed $117,000,198 worldwide. Five months later on June 12, Paramount Pictures released Nickelodeon Movies&#x27; &quot;Imagine That&quot;, a comedy-drama film starring Eddie Murphy, Thomas Haden Church, Nicole Ari Parker, Martin Sheen, Marin Hinkle, and Yara Shahidi. The film received mixed reviews, which criticized Murphy&#x27;s performance, and failed to profit at the box office.

===2010s===
On January 8, 2007, Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies announced that they had signed M. Night Shyamalan to write, direct and produce a trilogy of live-action films based on the &quot;&quot; series, the first of which would encompass the main characters&#x27; adventures in Book One. The film was later released in theaters in 3D on July 1, 2010, and was universally panned by critics, fans, and even from audiences who weren&#x27;t familiar with the TV series and is often considered one of the worst movies ever made. A year later, it won five Razzies, including worst screenplay, worst director and worst picture of the year. This was the studio&#x27;s first feature film released in 3-D. On its opening day in the United States, &quot;The Last Airbender&quot; made $16 million, ranking fifth overall for Thursday openings. Despite negative critical reception, the film was a box office success, and grossed $131,601,062 in the United States box office, also grossed $187,340,196 in other countries, making for a total of $318,941,258 worldwide. That planned trilogy was finally scrapped in 2018, to make way for a new, unrelated, live-action series produced by Netflix.

On March 4, 2011, Nickelodeon Movies released &quot;Rango&quot;, an animated western comedy film, directed by Gore Verbinski and starring Johnny Depp, Isla Fisher, Bill Nighy, Abigail Breslin, Alfred Molina, Harry Dean Stanton, Ray Winstone, Timothy Olyphant and Ned Beatty. The film was produced by Gore Verbinski&#x27;s production company Blind Wink, and Graham King&#x27;s GK Films. The animation was created by Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), marking its first full-length animated feature. ILM usually does visual effects for live-action films. It was also the first animated film for Verbinski. During voice recording, the actors received costumes and sets to &quot;give them the feel of the Wild West&quot;; star Johnny Depp had 20 days in which to voice Rango and the filmmakers scheduled the supporting actors to interact with him. Verbinski said his attempt with &quot;Rango&quot; was to do a &quot;small&quot; film after the large-scale &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; trilogy, but that he underestimated how painstaking and time-consuming animated filmmaking is. This film has met universal acclaim from critics and general audiences alike and was the first Nickelodeon film to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, ten years on since the category was introduced when &quot;Jimmy Neutron&quot; was nominated. The success of &quot;Rango&quot; led Paramount to create its own animation studio, Paramount Animation.

Nine months later, Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies partnered with Columbia Pictures once again and released &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, a performance-captured animated 3D film, directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by Peter Jackson, with the voices of Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, and based on three from the comic book series of the same name by Hergé, &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot; (1941), &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; (1943), and &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; (1944). This film was released in 3D and IMAX 3D theaters, as well normal &quot;2D&quot; theaters, and earned $77,591,831 in North America and $296,402,120 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $373,993,951. It also was studio&#x27;s first animated film to be shown in 3D. John Williams, the composer for the film, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score. This film became the first non-Pixar film to win a Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film, and was the first Nickelodeon film to do so.

On February 28, 2012, a sequel to &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot; titled &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water&quot; was announced to be in production and was scheduled to be released in 2015. Philippe Dauman, the president and CEO of the studio&#x27;s parent company Viacom, told sources:

&quot;We will be releasing a &quot;SpongeBob&quot; movie at the end of 2014, which will serve to start off or be one of our films that starts off our new animation effort.&quot;
Dauman also once again said that the Paramount animation productions would be a new opportunity for his company as they would each cost less than $100 million, and the animation unit would only have 30 to 40 people, allowing for good financial returns and profits. Thanks to modern technology, the films still look &quot;great&quot; despite the lower cost, he said. He also lauded his studio team for winning an animation Oscar for &quot;Rango&quot;, the studio&#x27;s first fully owned CGI effort. &quot;We&#x27;re very proud of that,&quot; he said.

The sequel was directed by Paul Tibbitt, written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger, produced by Mary Parent, and executive-produced by the series&#x27; creator, Stephen Hillenburg. The series&#x27; cast members reprised their roles from the first film. The sequel was animated using the same animation style (traditional animation) as the TV show.

In 2012, following the news of the Viacom buyout of the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; franchise, it was announced that Nickelodeon would produce a new film through Paramount Pictures with an expected release date sometime in 2012. In late May 2011, it was announced that Paramount and Nickelodeon had brought Michael Bay and his Platinum Dunes partners Brad Fuller and Andrew Form on to produce the next film that would reboot the film series. Bay, Fuller, and Form would produce alongside Walker and Mednick. For the script, the studio originally hired Art Marcum and Matt Holloway to write the film for close to a million dollars. A year later the studio turned to writers Josh Appelbaum and André Nemec to rewrite the script. In February 2012, Jonathan Liebesman was brought into negotiations to direct the film. It was released on August 8, 2014.

On October 26, 2012, the studio released a Halloween comedy film, &quot;Fun Size&quot;, starring Victoria Justice, Johnny Knoxville, and Thomas Mann. This film met with negative reviews and was a box office failure. It grossed $11.4 million and is the lowest wide-grossed film ever produced by Nickelodeon Movies.

A reboot of &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; opened on August 8, 2014. It was the biggest opening weekend for any movie produced by Nickelodeon Movies, grossing over $65 million in its first three days of release in the United States. It has since become Nickelodeon Movies&#x27;s highest-grossing movie domestically (in North America) and worldwide, with over $191 million domestically and a total of $493.3 million worldwide.

On February 6, 2015, &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water&quot;, the second film based on &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, was released. The film grossed almost $163 million in the United States and $323.4 million worldwide, making it the third-most successful film produced by the studio.

On June 3, 2016, the studio released &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows&quot;. The film was met with mixed reviews and grossed $240.6 million worldwide.

Nickelodeon Movies was also involved in the film &quot;Monster Trucks&quot;, though merely as a label partner as Paramount vacillated several times about including the Nickelodeon Movies vanity card within the film. It was released on January 13, 2017 and was unsuccessful at the box office.

An original animated feature produced by Paramount Animation and Nickelodeon Movies in association with Ilion Animation Studios, titled &quot;Wonder Park&quot;, released on March 15, 2019 after several changes in its release due to internal corporate politics, with reviews being mixed, praising the animation and voice acting while criticizing the story and tone, grossing $119 million against a budget of $80–100 million, and a subsequent planned animated series was shelved.

On August 9, 2019, the studio released the first film based on Nick Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Dora the Explorer&quot;, titled &quot;Dora and the Lost City of Gold&quot;. Produced by Paramount Players, it was directed by James Bobin. It received positive reviews and was a box office success.

Nickelodeon Movies distributed an original feature called &quot;Playing with Fire&quot;, starring John Cena, and directed by Andy Fickman. The film was released on November 8, 2019. It received negative reviews but was a modest box office success.

===2020s–present===
A third &quot;SpongeBob&quot; film, &quot;Sponge on the Run&quot;, was released in Canadian theaters on August 14, 2020, and digitally on Netflix in other territories on November 5, 2020, followed by a release via PVOD and on Paramount+, in the United States, on March 4, 2021, following the COVID-19 pandemic.

The film was produced in Canada by Spin Master Entertainment, with Nickelodeon Movies signing on to present the film internationally.

The film received praise for animation, acting and songs though some criticized the plot.

<doc id="1305292" wikidata="Q7797510" url="?curid=1305292" title="Three Gut Records">
<text>Three Gut Records was a Guelph, Ontario, Canada based independent record label. It was founded in 1999 by Lisa Moran and Tyler Clark Burke as a vehicle for releasing albums by their friends; it became an influential player in Canadian music with the breakout success of the Constantines&#x27; self-titled 2001 release on the label. Three Gut releases were distributed by Outside Music.

Other artists who released music on Three Gut include Royal City, Cuff the Duke, Jim Guthrie, Sea Snakes and Gentleman Reg. The label&#x27;s name came from their first release, Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;A Thousand Songs&quot;, which included a song called &quot;The Fantabulous World of Jimmy 3-Guts&quot;, a title derived from reversing the syllables in Guthrie&#x27;s surname.

Three Gut was also the Canadian label for two albums by the American band Oneida, the only non-Canadian act to have released material on Three Gut.

In 2005, it was announced that Three Gut Records would no longer release new albums.

==Life after Three Gut==
The closing of Three Gut Records meant all their artists would need to find a new home. Cuff the Duke were the first band to switch to a new label, when they became the first band to sign to Hayden&#x27;s Hardwood Records. Constantines released a limited-edition vinyl split of Neil Young covers with The Unintended on Toronto&#x27;s Blue Fog Recordings in early 2006. They signed to Arts &amp; Crafts in 2008 to release &quot;Kensington Heights&quot;. Another Three Gut alumnus, Gentleman Reg, also signed with Arts &amp; Crafts in July 2008. Jim Guthrie&#x27;s new band, Human Highway, released their debut album on Montreal&#x27;s Secret City Records in August 2008, while his follow-up to &quot;Now, More Than Ever&quot;, called &quot;Takes Time,&quot; came out in 2013 on Static Clang. Sea Snakes and Royal City have since disbanded, while Oneida continues to work with Jagjaguwar.

<doc id="1305297" wikidata="Q117684575" url="?curid=1305297" title="MTV Entertainment Studios">
<text>MTV Entertainment Studios (formerly MTV Production Development from 2003 until 2018 and MTV Studios from 2018 until 2021) is an American film and television production and distribution company and is the film and television production arm of the MTV Entertainment Group, itself a subsidiary of the Paramount Media Networks division of Paramount Global. It primarily produces content aimed at adolescent and adult audiences, including original productions for the namesake cable channel and its siblings, or theatrical films released through Paramount Pictures.

MTV Entertainment Studios was formed in 2021 as a consolidation of the original MTV Productions founded in 1991, the former MTV Films group established in 1996, the MTV Production Development/MTV Studios group of 2003, and the relaunched MTV Studios of 2018.

== History and Background ==

=== MTV Productions ===
MTV Productions was founded in 1991. It went into expansion two years later, with Doug Herzog serving as president, to produce content for theatrical releases, broadcast television and cable, syndication, and the international marketplace. MTV then signed a two-picture deal with Geffen Pictures. MTV Productions also tried for an entertainment strip called &quot;Real Time&quot;, to be distributed by Viacom Enterprises, and scheduled on air for the 1994–95 season, but never materialized. 

&quot;Joe&#x27;s Apartment&quot;, based on a short aired on MTV, would be the only film to come out of the Geffen Film deal due to the 1994 acquisition of Paramount Pictures by MTV&#x27;s parent company Viacom. It was later released on July 26, 1996, and grossed $4.6 million on a $13 million budget, making it a box office bomb. Since its acquisition by Viacom, Paramount Pictures began to distribute material from MTV and Nickelodeon. After &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; was cancelled, Paramount began distributing and producing MTV&#x27;s &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot; for the syndication market.

The Paramount Television Group and MTV Productions signed a deal to develop projects commissioned by MTV in 1994, and gave Paramount the right of first refusal on projects developed by MTV. 

In the 1997–98 television season, MTV Productions, in conjunction with Paramount Network Television, debuted the NBC comedy &quot;Jenny&quot;, the UPN (then-sister of MTV) comedy &quot;Hitz&quot;, and the WB drama &quot;Three&quot;. None of these lasted more than one season.

=== MTV Films ===
By 1995, David Gale was named head of MTV Films.

MTV developed its first feature film in collaboration with Paramount Pictures, &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do America&quot;. Based on MTV&#x27;s animated series &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, the film grossed $63.1 million on a $12 million budget.

On August 21, 1998, MTV Films released &quot;Dead Man on Campus&quot;, which starred Tom Everett Scott and Mark-Paul Gosselaar. It got negative reviews, and was a box office bomb, grossing $15.1 million on a $14 million budget. MTV Films&#x27; next feature project, &quot;200 Cigarettes&quot;, released on February 26, 1999, and was also a box office bomb, grossing $6.8 million on a $6 million budget.

In 2001, &quot;Zoolander&quot; was released under the &quot;VH1 Films&quot; label, and grossed $60.7 million on a $28 million budget.

On August 21, 2006, Nickelodeon Movies, Comedy Central Films, and MTV Films became labels of the Paramount Motion Pictures Group. Less than eleven years later, Paramount Players was created in 2017 as a joint venture with MTV Films, Nickelodeon Movies, and BET Films.

=== Relaunch and consolidation ===
In 2018, a new production unit under the MTV Studios name was launched to produce revivals of MTV library shows. Over the next two years, MTV Studios would launch its &quot;MTV Documentary Films&quot; label for producing and acquiring documentary features , while MTV Films would be folded into MTV Studios in 2020. 

In 2021, MTV Studios became MTV Entertainment Studios, now encompassing content for, and based on, all brands within the MTV Entertainment Group.

<doc id="1305298" wikidata="Q597808" url="?curid=1305298" title="Crash Bash">
<text>Crash Bash is a 2000 party video game developed by Eurocom Entertainment Software in association with Cerny Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation. It is the fifth title in the &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; series and the first entry in the series in the party genre. The game includes a collection of 28 mini-games playable within three modes of gameplay, as well as eight playable characters from the &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; series.

&quot;Crash Bash&quot; is the first game in the series not to be developed by Naughty Dog, as well as the last &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; game to be exclusively released on a Sony console, with subsequent installments being released on a wider variety of platforms. The game received mixed reviews from critics, who widely noted its similarity to &quot;Mario Party&quot;, but regarded it as an enjoyable multiplayer experience despite a perceived lack of depth and originality. The mini-games were determined to be varied but repetitive, and the graphics were appreciated for replicating the look and feel of previous &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; titles.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Crash Bash&quot; is a party video game featuring eight playable characters with differing powers and skills: Crash, Coco, Tiny, Dingodile, Cortex, Brio, Koala Kong, and newcomer Rilla Roo. The gameplay consists of 28 different mini-games divided into seven categories with multiple variations each. The categories consist of: &quot;Ballistix&quot;, in which players pilot hovercraft to deflect steel balls away from their goal; &quot;Polar Push&quot;, in which players riding polar bear cubs must knock opponents off of an icy arena; &quot;Pogo Pandemonium&quot;, in which players navigate a grid on pogo sticks to paint squares with their color; &quot;Crate Crush&quot;, in which players throw or kick stone crates at their opponents to deplete their health and eliminate them from play; &quot;Tank Wars&quot;, a tank battle involving mines and missiles; &quot;Crash Dash&quot;, a multi-lap race on a circular track; and &quot;Medieval Mayhem&quot;, a variety of challenges played within a circular arena. &quot;Crash Bash&quot; includes multiplayer compatibility for up to four human players with the use of the PlayStation Multitap.

&quot;Crash Bash&quot; features three distinct modes of play: &quot;Adventure&quot;, &quot;Battle&quot; and &quot;Tournament&quot;. In the Adventure mode, one or two human players must win all 28 mini-games and retrieve trophies, gems and crystals by accomplishing certain challenges presented for each mini-game. The mini-games are accessed from a series of &quot;Warp Room&quot; hub areas, with the first Warp Room consisting of four mini-games. A trophy is won by achieving victory in three rounds of any given mini-game. After obtaining a trophy, the player(s) can return to the mini-game and receive a gem or crystal by winning one round under special conditions. When a minimum number of trophies, gems and crystals have been won, the Warp Room&#x27;s &quot;Boss Arena&quot; becomes accessible, in which the player(s) must defeat a boss character by depleting his health. Winning a Warp Room&#x27;s Boss Arena will grant entry to the next Warp Room. When three of the game&#x27;s four Boss Arenas have been won, mini-game challenges become available in which the player(s) can win gold or platinum Relics by defeating advanced computer-controlled opponents. The Adventure mode is completed when all trophies, gems, crystals and relics have been won.

The Battle mode is a quick match within any mini-game that has previously been won in the Adventure mode. The mini-games within this mode can be played as a free-for-all or in teams. In the Tournament mode, players compete in four consecutive mini-games and accumulate points; the player with the most points wins the tournament. In both the Battle and Tournament modes, the number of rounds needed to win a mini-game can be adjusted between two and seven, and the skill level of computer-controlled opponents can be adjusted between &quot;easy&quot;, &quot;medium&quot; and &quot;hard&quot;.

==Plot==
The Adventure campaign features a frame story centering on Aku Aku and Uka Uka, who seek to resolve their feud via a contest between teams who battle in their stead, as the brothers are forbidden from fighting each other directly. During the course of the campaign, Uka Uka plots to use the crystals obtained by the player, a scheme which Aku Aku becomes wise to. The ending is determined by the player&#x27;s choice of character. If the player chose a character from Aku Aku&#x27;s team, Aku Aku locks the crystals away and banishes Uka Uka into the vacuum of space, but if the player chose a character from Uka Uka&#x27;s team, Uka Uka wields the crystals&#x27; destructive power to his own ends. If two players complete the campaign with a character from each team, the characters are subject to a special tie-breaking game to decide which team prevails.

==Development and release==
Following the release of &quot;Crash Team Racing&quot; in 1999, &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; creator Naughty Dog began development on &quot;Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy&quot; for the PlayStation 2, and were soon acquired by Sony Computer Entertainment, with Universal Interactive retaining control of the &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; intellectual property. As Naughty Dog&#x27;s deal with Universal expired, Universal president Mark Cerny departed the studio and formed the independent consultancy Cerny Games to continue his relationship with Naughty Dog and Sony.

Universal&#x27;s first &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; game without Naughty Dog&#x27;s involvement would be the Eurocom-developed &quot;Crash Bash&quot;, with Cerny and Michael John of Cerny Games acting as designers. Naughty Dog, however, donated its entire &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot;-related art database for the game&#x27;s development. Eurocom&#x27;s Jon Williams, Sony&#x27;s Grady Hunt, and Universal&#x27;s Vijay Lakshman served as producers. The programming team consisted of Dave Pridmore, Stuart Johnson, Julian Walshaw-Vaughn, Steve Bak, and Kris Adcock. The graphics were created by Matt Dixon, Steve Bamford, Clive Stevenson, and Jon Parr, while the audio was created by Steve Duckworth. Universal&#x27;s Sean Krankel and Ricci Rukavina provided additional mini-game design. The character Rilla Roo was created due to the lack of suitable player characters from the Naughty Dog games. Dixon credited the character&#x27;s concept to Cerny and the design to lead character artist Bamford. The game was showcased at E3 2000, and shipped to North American retailers on November 7, 2000, with a European release following on November 29. It is the final &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; game to be released exclusively for a Sony console, with subsequent installments being released on the Xbox and PlayStation 2.

A game demo of &quot;&quot; is accessible via a cheat code entered at the title screen. While a game demo of &quot;Crash Bash&quot; is, in turn, accessible from &quot;Spyro: Year of the Dragon&quot;&#x27;s title screen, an alternate input entered at the demo&#x27;s title screen unlocks a debug menu, granting access to a near-complete beta copy of the game. While all the game&#x27;s levels are available, the Adventure mode&#x27;s final hub area is missing, necessitating use of a GameShark to access its levels. The Japanese version of the game features Fake Crash – an odd doppelganger of Crash who had made cameos in previous &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; games – as an unlockable character.

==Reception==
&quot;Crash Bash&quot; received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Reviewers widely compared the game to &quot;Mario Party&quot; and the then-upcoming &quot;Sonic Shuffle&quot;. While perceiving a lack of depth and originality, they nevertheless regarded the multiplayer experience as enjoyable.

Shawn Sparks of &quot;GameRevolution&quot; commended the variety of mini-games, but was displeased by the requirement of playing through the Adventure mode to unlock mini-games in the multiplayer modes. Matt Helgeson of &quot;Game Informer&quot; admired the challenge and innovative concepts provided by the mini-games, but felt that the Adventure mode was monotonous and lacked purpose. Greg Sewart of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; interpreted Eurocom&#x27;s eschewing of the board game formula established by &quot;Mario Party&quot; in favor of a more action-based format as an attempt to not appear completely derivative, which he deemed unsuccessful. He also complained of the lack of diversity in the Tournament mode, which grouped together mini-games of the same basic type, and felt that it made the mini-game completion requirement of one of the players winning at least three rounds especially tedious. Dean Hager, also of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, felt that some of the mini-games were forced and awkward to control, and observed that an excessive amount of power-ups and &quot;general chaos&quot; made concentration difficult. Out of the mini-games, Sewart and Hager deemed those in the &quot;Ballistix&quot; category to be the most fun. Although Doug Perry of &quot;IGN&quot; appreciated the different variations of the mini-games, he and Daniel Erickson of &quot;Next Generation&quot; found them generally repetitive. Ryan Davis of &quot;GameSpot&quot; dismissed &quot;Crash Bash&quot; as &quot;utterly run of the mill, completely middle of the road&quot;, and criticized the unbalanced AI.

The graphics were appreciated for replicating the look and feel of the Naughty Dog titles, but Helgeson and Human Tornado of &quot;GamePro&quot; were troubled by the distant camera, with the latter observing that the characters often bunched together in several games. While Davis admired the game&#x27;s explosion, particle and lighting effects, he was annoyed by their abundance distracting from the gameplay and sporadically causing slowdown.

Perry summarized the music as &quot;kooky and light and it&#x27;s fun to listen to&quot; and remarked on its resemblance to the Naughty Dog games, elaborating that &quot;the thumping vibes and bubblegum Congo drumbeats are right on target&quot;. Davis determined the audio to be &quot;standard, with Hanna-Barbera-style background music that is appropriate to the various environments and a somewhat limited set of taunts and yelps for each character&quot;, and warned that the audio may quickly wear thin.

According to the NPD Group, &quot;Crash Bash&quot; was the 16th highest selling console game of December 2000 in North America, as well as the 7th best-selling PlayStation title. In the United Kingdom, the game received a &quot;Platinum&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies.

<text>Flirtin&#x27; with Disaster is the second studio album by American rock band Molly Hatchet, released in 1979 by Epic Records. The album was re-issued in 2001 with four bonus tracks. It is their best-selling album.

The cover is a painting by Frank Frazetta titled &quot;Dark Kingdom.&quot;

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote that &quot;Molly Hatchet is little more than just another in a too-long line of senseless and unimaginative southern boogie bands, rehashing party-boogie licks and singing the joys of cheap booze and even cheaper women.&quot;

&quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; deemed the title track &quot;an obvious Skynyrd rip ... [that] possesses a certain rough charm.&quot;

<text>Ashford is a small village situated in the north-west on the Northern Tablelands of the state of New South Wales. The New England rural village of Ashford lies within the broad sunlit lands 748 km north of Sydney, 500 km south west of Brisbane, close to the Queensland border. Ashford is 430 metres above sea level and located 56 km north of Inverell on a major arterial road, connecting the Gwydir and Bruxner highways through to the Queensland border.

==History==

&quot;Frazer&#x27;s Creek&quot; Post Office was established in 1853 and renamed Ashford in 1863. The first police station was opened in 1864 and the first school in 1868.

Fred Ward a bushranger, known as &quot;Captain Thunderbolt&quot; rode in the area in 1867. Primary industries in the town over the years included tobacco farming and a local coal mine though each of these have ceased.

Today, the surrounding areas are used for sheep and cattle farming.

==Today==
Ashford is a small community with a K-12 public school, basic shops, churches, and recreation and entertainment facilities, including a swimming pool, golf course and bowling club. Ashford Roosters play in the Group 19 Rugby League competition. It is the hub of a large agricultural area, an active retirement community, and regional tourism. Local attractions include Pindari Dam on the Severn River, MacIntyre Falls, the annual Ashford Salami Festival and Ashford Caves at Kwiambal National Park.

<text>The autism rights movement, also known as the autistic acceptance movement, is a social movement allied with the disability rights movement. It emphasizes the neurodiversity paradigm, viewing autism as a set of naturally occurring variations in human cognition, a disability with both strengths and weaknesses, rather than as a disease to be cured or a medical disorder. This paradigm contradicts and diverges from the medical model of disability, without opposing all aspects of it.

Central to the autism rights movement&#x27;s beliefs is the right to self-determine if one is part of the autism community, that autistic people should be seen as the primary voice for autistic people, and that autistic people have the final say in what language should be used when talking about autism. A common motto used by the autism rights movement, borrowed from the disability rights movement, is the phrase &quot;nothing about us without us&quot;.

Autism rights movement advocates strive for widespread acceptance of people with autism, as well as the traits and behaviors (e.g. stimming, lack of eye contact, and special interests) associated with autism, for autistic people to socialize on their own terms, and to mitigate the double empathy problem. The movement seeks to reform, advance, and foster autism-oriented support services, interventions or therapies in accordance with neurodiversity principles to emphasize coping skills for challenging situations, promote adaptive skills, and promote psychological well-being and mental health, through incorporating voices and perspectives of autistic people in intervention reforms, advancements, and developments.

The movement criticizes therapies and interventions that—implicitly or explicitly—encourage masking behaviors associated with autism and imitating neurotypical social behaviors, as higher tendencies of camouflaging, autistic masking, or passing as neurotypical are associated with worse mental health outcomes according to most recent studies and multiple systematic reviews and some autistic adults who experienced some forms of behavioral interventions reported adverse effects such as detrimental effects on their mental health due to increased or excessive camouflaging or masking.

The movement also advocates for autistic people to be recognized as a minority group rather than as having a disorder. Within the autism rights movement, autism is often compared to different variations in human biology not categorized as disorders, such as homosexuality.

==History==

=== 1980s–1990s: Autistic-run organizations, newsletters, and conferences ===
Jim Sinclair is credited as the first person to communicate the autism rights perspective. In the early 1990s, Sinclair frequently participated in autism conferences led by parent-centric organizations but found them &quot;overwhelmingly hostile from both sensory and emotional standpoints&quot;. In 1992, Sinclair co-founded the Autism Network International (ANI) with Donna Williams and Kathy Grant, an organization that publishes newsletters &quot;written by and for autistic people.&quot;

The ANI newsletter, &quot;Our Voice&quot;, had its first issue distributed online in November 1992 to an audience of primarily neurotypical professionals and parents of young autistic children. The number of autistic people in the organization increased over the years, and ANI eventually became a communication network for like-minded autistic people. Sinclair wrote the essay &quot;Don&#x27;t Mourn for Us&quot; (1993) in the ANI newsletter (Volume 1, Number 3) with an anti-cure perspective on autism. Some have considered the essay a touchstone for the autism rights movement, and it has been mentioned in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;New York Magazine&quot;.

ANI established the yearly retreat &quot;Autreat&quot; in 1996. Autreat was a retreat and conference held in the United States specifically for autistic people and was held every year from 1996 to 2013, except in 2001. The theme of the first conference in 1996 was &quot;Celebrating Autistic Culture&quot;, and it had close to 60 participants. It was hosted at Camp Bristol Hills in Canandaigua, New York. The success of Autreat later inspired similar retreats, such as the Association for Autistic Community&#x27;s conference, Autspace, in the United States; Autscape in the United Kingdom; and Projekt Empowerment in Sweden.

Martijn Dekker, an autistic computer programmer from the Netherlands, launched an e-mail list called &quot;Independent Living on the Autism Spectrum&quot;, or &quot;InLv&quot;, in 1996. The list also welcomed those with similar conditions, such as ADHD, dyslexia, and dyscalculia. American writer Harvey Blume was a member of the list and described it as embracing &quot;neurological pluralism&quot; in a 1997 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Blume discussed the concept of neurological diversity with Australian sociologist Judy Singer. The term &quot;neurodiversity&quot; was first published in Judy Singer&#x27;s 1998 Honours thesis and in Harvey Blume&#x27;s 1998 article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;.

=== 2000s–2010s: The rise of self-advocacy ===
Aspies For Freedom (AFF) was founded in 2004. They established June 18 as Autistic Pride Day starting in 2005. AFF member Joe Mele initiated a protest against the National Alliance for Autism Research in 2004. AFF also initiated protests against Cure Autism Now and the Judge Rotenberg Center.

In 2004, Canadian autism researcher Michelle Dawson challenged applied behavior analysis (ABA), a common behavioral intervention for people with autism, on ethical grounds. She testified in &quot;Auton v. British Columbia&quot; against the lack of required government funding for ABA. That same year, &quot;The New York Times&quot; covered the autism rights perspective by publishing journalist Amy Harmon&#x27;s article, &quot;How About Not Curing Us, Some Autistics Are Pleading&quot;.

In 2006, The Autism Acceptance Project (TAAP) was founded by Estée Klar, the mother of an autistic child, with help from an autistic advisory and board. The project is affiliated with the Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) and other activist groups in North America.

From 2005 to 2007, TAAP organized arts-based events. TAAP also sponsored the Joy of Autism: Redefining Ability and Quality of Life events and lectures in Toronto, featuring dozens of autistic artists and speakers such as Jim Sinclair, Michelle Dawson, Phil Schwartz, Morton Ann Gernsbacher, and Larry Bissonnette.

In 2007, an ASAN initiative helped halt the New York Child Study Campaign. The advertising campaign launched in 2007 depicted conditions like autism and ADHD as kidnappers holding children for ransom. The campaign was canceled two weeks after its launch when the center&#x27;s director had received an estimated 3000 e-mails and phone calls, most of them &quot;expressing anger and hurt&quot;. ASAN halted another advertising campaign in 2008 where PETA had implied a link between autism and casein in milk. Phone calls, letters, and petitions organized by ASAN contributed to the removal of the advertisements.

The internet has provided a space for members of the autism movement to organize and communicate independently without relying on non-autistic people, such as family members, healthcare workers, or events hosted by non-autistic individuals, especially considering the geographical distance and communication and speech patterns of autistic individuals.

=== 2020–present ===
The COVID-19 pandemic caused a drop-off in physical events in the summer of 2020, including autism pride events. Much of autism awareness and campaigning was driven by social media, including the notable growth of TikTok and the emergence of autistic advocates like Chloé Hayden and Paige Layle.

Autism advocacy made progress within the traditional media, making its way into influential business publications such as Harvard Business Review and Fast Company. A comprehensive approach to inclusion in the workplace, the Canary Code, was developed in 2022 by Ludmila Praslova, specifically focusing on autistic talent and other marginalized communities.

===Neurodiversity and autistic self-advocacy movement===
Judy Singer coined the term &quot;neurodiversity&quot; in the late 1990s as a middle ground between the two dominating models of disability, the medical model and the social model, dismissing both of them as insufficiently capturing the solution for—and cause of—disability.

Steve Silberman describes neurodiversity as seeing the virtue of different conditions while taking into consideration that the conditions also convey challenges. Autistics for Autistics, a self-advocacy group, describes neurodiversity this way: &quot;Neurodiversity means that—like biodiversity—all of us have a role to play in society ...and we should be valued for who we are. Included in public life, such as school and employment. For nonverbal autistics, this also means equal and fair access to communication, such as AAC.&quot; 

The autistic self-advocacy movement, made up of autistic individuals, works from a social model of disability perspective. For example, the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network describes its mandate as &quot;to advance the principles of the disability rights movement with regard to autism&quot;.

Autistic people are considered to have neurocognitive differences that give them distinct strengths and weaknesses, and they are capable of succeeding when appropriately accommodated and supported. According to Ludmila Praslova, author of &quot;The Canary Code&quot;, creating systems that support the employment of autistic people and their success through organizational transparency, justice, and flexibility benefits all employees.

There is no leader of the neurodiversity movement, and little academic research has been conducted on it as a social phenomenon. As such, proponents of the neurodiversity approach have heterogeneous beliefs but are consistent in the view that autism cannot be separated from an autistic person. The movement opposes therapies that aim to make children &quot;indistinguishable from their peers&quot;. Instead, they advocate for accommodations in schools and work environments and including autistic people when making decisions that affect them. Neurodiversity advocates oppose researching a &quot;cure&quot; for autism, and instead support research that helps autistic people thrive as they are.

An analysis of data from the UK and Hungary in 2017 found evidence that autistic or intellectually disabled self-advocates are rarely involved in leadership or decision-making within organisations. It also showed that poverty, unpaid positions at disability organisations, and lack of support are significant barriers for most autistic people, including autistic people with an intellectual disability who wish to self-advocate.

==Perspectives==

=== Autism diagnosis ===

The autism rights movement rejects the classification by psychiatrists of autism as a disorder. Autistic self-advocates also reject terming the reported increase in autism diagnoses as an &quot;epidemic&quot; since the word implies autism is a disease and point out that the increase is likely due to an expansion of diagnostic criteria rather than an epidemic.

=== Rejection of functioning labels ===
The autism rights movement rejects the use of the labels &quot;high-functioning&quot; and &quot;low-functioning&quot; when describing different autistic people, arguing that the strengths and struggles of autistic people are on a spectrum and not linear.

=== Opposition to cure and prevention ===
The autism rights movement opposes &quot;curing&quot; autism, criticizing the idea as misguided and dangerous. Instead, autism is viewed as a way of life and advocate acceptance over a search for a cure. The autism rights movement is a part of the larger disability rights movement and acknowledges the social model of disability. Within the model, struggles faced by autistic people are viewed as discrimination rather than deficiencies. 

Autism rights activists are opposed to attempts to eliminate autism genes, and argue that doing so would decrease human genetic diversity. In particular, there is opposition to prenatal genetic testing of autism in fetuses, which some believe might be possible in the future. On 23 February 2005, Joseph Buxbaum of the Autism Genome Project at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai said there could be a prenatal test for autism within 10 years. However, the genetics of autism have proven to be extremely complex. A wider debate on the ethics involved in the possible elimination of a genotype that has advantages as well as disadvantages, has focused on possible negative effects of tampering with natural selection. 

Some people lament that professionals, such as social workers, may discourage autistic people from having children. Activists are concerned that the &quot;ultimate cure will be a genetic test to prevent autistic children from being born&quot; and that most fetuses with so-called &quot;autism genes&quot; would be aborted if prenatal tests for autism are developed.

The anti-cure perspective is the view of autism as a normal occurrence—an alternate variation in brain wiring or a less common expression of the human genome—rather than a disorder. Advocates of this perspective believe that autism is a unique way of being that should be valued, and efforts to eliminate autism should not be compared to curing cancer but instead to the &quot;efforts of a previous age to cure left-handedness&quot;.

Activist Jim Sinclair expresses in his essay &quot;Don&#x27;t Mourn For Us&quot; that wishing that an autistic person be cured is equivalent to wishing that an entirely different person exists in their place.

Canadian autism researcher Michelle Dawson writes that &quot;No one has yet calculated the costs to autistics, and to society, of the current widespread autism advocacy effort to create a world where there are no autistic people at all.&quot;

Temple Grandin comments that if autism were eliminated, society would lose scientists, musicians, and mathematicians; a caveman &quot;with high-functioning Asperger&#x27;s&quot; might have developed the stone spear.

Most autistic self-advocates agree that autistic people should not be made to act exactly like everyone else but that society should accommodate their disability and that autism services should focus on quality of life rather than conformity.

=== Autistic culture ===
Some autistic activists suggest that life with autism is like being born among people who speak a different language, follow a religion or philosophy one does not share, and live a lifestyle that feels alien. Social media, meetups, and specific professions are spaces where autistic people connect and may share common interests.

=== Self advocacy and inclusion in decision-making ===
A common theme expressed among autism rights activists and neurodiversity groups is that they are different from parent- and professional-led organizations and conferences that dominate the autism scene.

In 2003, autism researcher Michelle Dawson criticizes the norm of allowing parents to speak on behalf of their autistic children at conferences to the exclusion of autistics: &quot;With the happy and proud collaboration of governments, courts, researchers, service providers, and funding bodies&quot;, she says, &quot;parents have succeeded in removing autistics from the vicinity of any important discussions or decisions.&quot; She says that the exclusion results in policy and treatment decisions being made solely by individuals who do not directly experience autism.

In 2005, Autism rights activist Jim Sinclair states that autism conferences are traditionally geared toward neurotypical parents and professionals, and that to an autistic person they may be quite &quot;hostile&quot; in terms of sensory stimulation and rigidity.

=== Autism interventions and therapies ===
In 2011, Aspies For Freedom (AFF) stated that they believe many unethical therapies and treatments for autism have become common. AFF argued that extensive—40 hours per week—applied behavior analysis (ABA) and restricting stimming and other coping mechanisms associated with autism are mentally harmful, that aversion therapy and the use of restraints are physically harmful, and that non-medically approved treatments like chelation therapy and exorcism are dangerous.

United Nations (UN) human rights experts have expressed that autistic people are particularly at risk for harmful medical practices and some approaches amount to &quot;ill-treatment or torture.&quot;

Canadian autism self-advocate Michelle Dawson testified in court against government funding of ABA therapy. The Canadian organization Autistics for Autistics (A4A) has outlined some of the main objections to ABA from autistic self-advocates.

In 2004, Jane Meyerding, who is autistic, criticized therapy that attempts to remove autism typical behaviors and states that the behaviors are often attempts to communicate. Studies have shown that efforts to pass as non-autistic is associated with poorer mental health and psychological well-being, and such findings were consistent across various age groups. There have been accounts and qualitative evidence that some forms of behavioral interventions increase masking or worsen mental health for some autistic people. American autism rights advocate Ari Ne&#x27;erman argues that by addressing individual traits of autism, it is possible to reduce harmful behavior and avoid encouraging camouflaging behaviors.

== Criticism of Autism Speaks ==

Autism Speaks has faced criticism from autism rights advocates for failing to represent autistic people and for exploitative practices.

Until he resigned in 2013, John Elder Robison was Autism Speaks&#x27; only board member openly recognized as being on the autism spectrum. His resignation came two days after the release of an op-ed by the group&#x27;s co-founder Suzanne Wright which, according to Robison, &quot;is simply not defensible for someone who feels as I do, and I cannot continue to stand up for the public actions of an organization that makes the same mistakes over and over again by failing to connect to the community it purports to represent&quot;.

Simone Greggs, the mother of an autistic child, filed a lawsuit against Autism Speaks for disability discrimination after her job offer was rescinded. The suit alleges that she lost the job offer due to asking for an accommodation on behalf of her autistic son.

Autism Speaks has produced the documentary films &quot;Autism Every Day&quot; (2006) and &quot;Sounding the Alarm&quot; (2014) and the short video &quot;I Am Autism&quot; (2009), each met with strong opposition from autism rights advocates. &quot;Autism Every Day&quot; is a documentary featuring interviews of parents with mostly negative opinions about autism and their situations. It has been criticized due to parents speaking about their children as if they are not there. In one interview, former board member Alison Singer, while in the same room as her autistic daughter, reveals she had contemplated driving herself and her daughter off a bridge. &quot;I Am Autism&quot; is a short video that personifies autism as a narrative voice, which compares itself to several life-threatening diseases and makes the false claim of causing divorce. &quot;Sounding the Alarm&quot; is a documentary exploring the transition to adulthood and the cost of lifetime care. It was criticized by the Autistic Women &amp; Nonbinary Network for being &quot;full of dehumanizing rhetoric&quot; and portraying ignorance of nonverbal communication.

Autism Speaks fundraising events have been the object of several organized protests by autism rights advocates.

In 2013, the organization Boycott Autism Speaks published a list of companies that donate money to Autism Speaks along with their contact information, urging those in the autistic community to pressure those companies into dropping their support via an active boycott, since direct appeals to Autism Speaks did not result in the desired changes. A month later, ASAN published its 2014 Joint Letter to the Sponsors of Autism Speaks, signed by 26 different disability-related organizations, appealing to the moral responsibility of the sponsors, donors, and other supporters.

==Autism rights groups==
There are several organizations in the autism rights movement. Some like ASAN are led exclusively by autistic people, while others such as Autism National Committee encourage cooperation between autistic people and their non-autistic allies.

==Events and activities==
Autism activist activities do not always look like other forms of political activism. For example, many autistic people cannot participate in in-person public protests due to sensory overload from the noise. Other cultural assumptions about the correct way to engage in activism, such as &quot;giving people a voice&quot;, are not consistent with valuing non-speaking autistic people.
*In 2010, Autistics Speaking Day was a response to the then-upcoming first commemoration of Communication Shutdown. The annual Communication Shutdown event encourages non-autistics to refrain from using social networking websites for one day as a perspective-taking exercise, while Autistics Speaking Day encourages autistic people to become &quot;more&quot; active on social media and to describe their experiences during a time when there are fewer neurotypical voices in the mix.
*In 2012, autistic activist Zoe Gross organized the first Disability Day of Mourning vigil held in memory of people with disabilities murdered by family members or caregivers. These vigils are now held annually on 1 March globally, often by local self-advocacy and disability rights groups.
*In 2015, autistic activist Alanna Rose Whitney created the social media campaign #WalkInRed, later rebranded #RedInstead to be more inclusive of wheelchair users, as another alternative to Light It Up Blue.
*Autism rights activists organize protests against organizations they consider objectionable, most notably Autism Speaks and the Judge Rotenberg Center. In the United States, activists affiliated with ASAN have organized numerous protests against Autism Speaks events, typically protesting and leafleting at fundraising walks. Autistic activists including Shain Neumeier and Lydia Brown have organized lobbying days and protests aiming to close or more strictly regulate the Judge Rotenberg Center.

==Terminology==
There is disagreement within the autism community on whether to use person-first terminology (e.g., &quot;person with autism&quot;) or identity-first terminology (e.g., &quot;autistic person&quot;). The autism rights movement encourages the use of identity-first terminology to stress that autism is a part of an individual&#x27;s identity rather than a condition they have.

Phrases like &quot;&quot; are objectionable to many people, and are discouraged by both the American Psychological Association&#x27;s style guide and National Center on Disability and Journalism&#x27;s style guide.

The autistic community has developed their own terminology such as:
* &quot;Aspie&quot; – a person with Asperger&#x27;s syndrome. Not as frequently used with Aspergers being removed as an official diagnosis.
* &quot;Autie&quot; – an autistic person.
* &quot;Autistics and cousins&quot; (AC) – a cover term including aspies, auties, and their &quot;cousins&quot;, i.e., people with some autistic traits but no formal diagnosis
* &quot;Curebie&quot; – a person with the desire to cure autism. This term is considered derogatory.
* &quot;Neurodiversity&quot; – the framework for understanding some disabilities, such as autism, as a variation in human neurological makeup rather than a disorder.
* &quot;Neurotypical&quot; (&quot;NT&quot;) – a person who does not have any neurological differences. It is often used to describe an individual who is not autistic.
* &quot;Allistic&quot; – a person who is not autistic. Originally it was used satirically to describe those without autism.

== Autistic pride ==
Autistic pride promotes the idea that autistic people are not defective. It emphasizes the variation and diversity in human neurology.

Autistic pride asserts that autistic people are not impaired or damaged; rather, they have a unique set of characteristics that provide them many rewards and challenges, not unlike their non-autistic peers.

== Autistic culture and community ==

With the recent increases in autism recognition and new approaches to educating and socializing autistics, an autistic culture has begun to develop. Autistic culture is based on a belief that autism is a unique way of being and not a disorder to be cured. The &quot;Aspie world&quot;, as it is sometimes called, contains people with Asperger syndrome (AS) and high-functioning autism (HFA), and can be linked to three historical trends: the emergence of AS and HFA as labels, the emergence of the disability rights movement, and the rise of the Internet. Autistic communities exist both online and offline; many people use these for support and communication with others like themselves, as the social limitations of autism sometimes make it difficult to make friends, to establish support within general society, and to construct an identity within society.

Because many autistics find it easier to communicate online than in person, a large number of online resources are available. Some autistic individuals learn sign language, participate in online chat rooms, discussion boards, and websites, or use communication devices at autism-community social events. The Internet helps bypass non-verbal cues and emotional sharing that autistics tend to have difficulty with. It gives autistic individuals a way to communicate and form online communities.

Conducting work, conversation and interviews online in chat rooms, rather than via phone calls or personal contact, helps level the playing field for many autistics. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article said &quot;the impact of the Internet on autistics may one day be compared in magnitude to the spread of sign language among the deaf&quot; because it opens new opportunities for communication by filtering out &quot;sensory overload that impedes communication among autistics.&quot;

== Notable events ==
===World Autism Awareness Day===

World Autism Awareness Day, sometimes referred to as World Autism Day, is marked yearly on 2 April. It was designated by the United Nations General Assembly at the end of 2007.

Some autism rights advocates have campaigned to rename it Autism Acceptance Day because of a misconception that the day is affiliated with Autism Speaks.

===Autism Sunday===
Autism Sunday is a global Christian event observed annually on the second Sunday of February. It is supported by church leaders and organisations around the world. The event was initiated by the founders of Autism Awareness Campaign UK, Charika Corea and Ivan Corea. Autism Sunday was launched in London in 2002 with a service at St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

===Autism Awareness Year===
The year 2002 was declared Autism Awareness Year in the United Kingdom—the idea was initiated by Ivan and Charika Corea, parents of an autistic child, Charin.

Autism Awareness Year was led by bibic, Brainkind, Shirley Foundation, National Autistic Society, Autism London, and 800 other organizations in the United Kingdom. It had the personal backing of British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

The 2002 Autism Awareness Year helped raise awareness of the serious issues concerning autism and Asperger&#x27;s syndrome across the United Kingdom. A major conference, Autism 2002, was held at the King&#x27;s Fund in London with debates in the House of Commons and the House of Lords in Westminster. Autism awareness ribbons were worn to mark the year.

Some British autism advocates want autistic people acknowledged as a minority rather than as disabled, because they say that &quot;disability discrimination laws don&#x27;t protect those who are not disabled but who &#x27;still have something that makes them look or act differently from other people. But the autism community is split over this issue, and some view this notion as radical.

=== Autistic Pride Day ===
Autistic Pride Day is an Aspies For Freedom initiative celebrated on 18 June each year. It is a day for celebrating the neurodiversity of people with autism. Inspired by LGBT+ communities, Autistic Pride often compares their efforts to the civil rights and LGBT social movements.

=== Autistics Speaking Day ===
Autistics Speaking Day is a yearly event designated on 1 November, a self-advocacy campaign run by people with autism to raise awareness and challenge negative stereotypes about autism by speaking for themselves and sharing their stories. The first Autistics Speaking Day was held in 2010. According to Corina Becker, one of the early founders, the day is to &quot;acknowledge our difficulties while sharing our strengths, passions, and interests.&quot; The idea for the event developed out of opposition to a &quot;Communication Shutdown&quot; fundraising campaign led by United States charity Autism Speaks. Participants had been asked to &quot;simulate having autism&quot; by straying from all forms of online communication for one day. The event received criticism and accused Autism Speaks of missing the point of what autism actually is, referring to autistic individuals&#x27; comfort using other means of communication.

=== Autism Acceptance Project ===
In 2006 the Autism Acceptance Project (TAAProject) was founded by Estée Klar, the mother of an autistic child, with help from an autistic advisory board. The project was dedicated to promoting acceptance and accommodations for autistic people in society and was primarily supported by autistic people. The website for TAAProject disappeared a decade later, but the idea of promoting acceptance has now been adopted with other campaigns such as Autism Acceptance Month.

=== Autism Acceptance Day ===
In 2011, the first Autism Acceptance Day celebrations were organized by Paula Durbin Westby, as a response to traditional &quot;Autism Awareness&quot; campaigns which the autistic community found harmful and insufficient. Autism Acceptance Day is now held every April. &quot;Awareness&quot; focuses on informing others of the existence of autism while &quot;acceptance&quot; pushes towards validating and honoring the autism community. By providing tools and educational material, people are encouraged to embrace the challenges autistic people face and celebrate their strengths. Rather than making autism into a crippling disability, acceptance integrates those on the autistic spectrum into everyday society. Instead of encouraging people to wear blue as Autism Awareness Day does, Autism Acceptance Day encourages people to wear red.

=== Autreat ===
At Autreat—an annual autistic gathering—participants compared their movement to gay rights activists, or the Deaf culture, where sign language is preferred over surgery that might restore hearing. Other local organizations have also arisen: for example, a European counterpart, Autscape, was created around 2005.

==Scholarship==
Autism received increasing attention from social-science scholars in the early 2000s, with the goals of improving support services and therapies, arguing that autism should be tolerated as a difference not a disorder, and by how autism affects the definition of personhood and identity. Sociological research has also investigated how social institutions, particularly families, cope with the challenges associated with autism.

A study published on 20 January 2021, by the University of Texas at Dallas suggests that educating non-autistic people about the strengths and challenges of autistic people can help reduce stigma and misconceptions surrounding autism, which may help increase social inclusion of autistic people. The study also found that implicit biases about autism were harder to overcome for non-autistic people.

== Media portrayals ==
Much of the public perception of autism is based on its portrayals in biographies, movies, novels, and TV series. Many of these portrayals have been inaccurate, and have contributed to a divergence between public perception and the clinical reality of autism. For example, in the 2005 movie &quot;Mozart and the Whale&quot;, the opening scene gives four clues that a leading character has Asperger syndrome, and two of these clues are extraordinary savant skills. The savant skills are not needed in the film, but in movies savant skills have become a stereotype for the autism spectrum, because of the incorrect assumption that most autistic people are savants.

Some works from the 1970s have autistic characters, who are rarely labeled. In contrast, in the 2013 BBC2 television miniseries &quot;The Politician&#x27;s Husband&quot;, the impact of Noah Hoynes&#x27; Asperger syndrome on the boy&#x27;s behavior and on his family, and steps Noah&#x27;s loved ones take to accommodate and address it, are prominent plot points in all three episodes.

Popular media have depicted special talents of some children with autism, including exceptional abilities as seen in the 1988 movie &quot;Rain Man&quot;.

Since the 1970s, fictional portrayals of autistic people have become more frequent. Public perception of autism is often based on these fictional portrayals in novels, biographies, movies, and TV series. These depictions of autism in media today are often made in a way that brings pity to the public and their concern of the topic, because their viewpoint is never actually shown, leaving the public without knowledge of autism and its diagnosis. Portrayals in the media of characters with atypical abilities (for example, the ability to multiply large numbers without a calculator) may be misinterpreted by viewers as accurate portrayals of all autistic people and of autism itself. Additionally, the media frequently depicts autism as only affecting children, which promotes the misconception that autism does not affect adults.

==Notable individuals==
Some notable figures such as Temple Grandin, a food animal handling systems designer and author, and Tim Page, a Pulitzer Prize-winning critic and author are autistic.

Notable individuals known to have Asperger syndrome include Craig Nicholls, lead singer, songwriter, guitarist and only constant member of the Australian rock band The Vines, who was diagnosed in 2004, and actor Paddy Considine.
Swedish environmentalist Greta Thunberg, who in August 2018 started the &quot;School strike for climate&quot; movement, has explained how the &quot;gift&quot; of living with Asperger syndrome helps her &quot;see things from outside the box&quot; when it comes to climate change. In an interview with presenter Nick Robinson on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;, the 16-year-old activist said that autism helps her see things in &quot;black and white&quot;. She went on to say:

Additionally, media speculation of contemporary figures as being on the autism spectrum has become popular in recent times. &quot;New York&quot; magazine reported some examples, which included that &quot;Time&quot; magazine suggested that Bill Gates is autistic, and that a biographer of Warren Buffett wrote that his prodigious memory and &quot;fascination with numbers&quot; give him &quot;a vaguely autistic aura&quot;. The magazine also reported that on &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot;, Drew Pinsky deemed basketball player Dennis Rodman a candidate for an Asperger&#x27;s diagnosis, and the UCLA specialist consulted &quot;seemed to concur&quot;. Nora Ephron criticized these conclusions, writing that popular speculative diagnoses suggest autism is &quot;an epidemic, or else a wildly over-diagnosed thing that there used to be other words for&quot;. The practice of diagnosing autism in these cases is controversial.

== Controversies ==
There are a wide variety of both supportive and critical opinions about the movement among people who are autistic or associated with people with autism. A common criticism leveled against autistic activists is that the majority of them do not have co-occurring intellectual disability and critics argue that their views do not represent the views of autistic people with intellectual disability and their parents.

<text>Beatin&#x27; the Odds is the third studio album by American rock band Molly Hatchet, released in 1980 by Epic Records. The album is the first to feature singer Jimmy Farrar, who replaced original singer Danny Joe Brown. A remastered edition of the album was issued in 2008 by Rock Candy Records, with four live bonus tracks and extensive liner notes. The remastering was directed by British producer Jon Astley.

<text>Puu Ōō (also spelled Pu‘u‘ō‘ō, and often written Puu Oo, , ) is a volcanic cone on the eastern rift zone of Kīlauea volcano in the Hawaiian Islands. The eruption that created Puu Ōō began on January 3, 1983, and continued nearly continuously until April 30, 2018, making it the longest-lived rift-zone eruption of the last two centuries.

By January 2005, of magma covered an area of more than and added of land to the southeast coast of Hawaii. The eruption claimed at least 189 buildings and of highways, as well as a church, a store, the Wahaula Visitor Center, and many ancient Hawaiian sites, including the Wahaula heiau. The coastal highway has been closed since 1987, as parts of the road have been buried under lava up to thick.

== Etymology ==

The hill was initially nicknamed &quot;Puu O&quot; by volcanologists, as its position when marked on a map of the area coincided with an &quot;o&quot; in &quot;Lava flow of 1965&quot;. Later, the elders of the village of Kalapana were asked to name the new hill, and chose &quot;Puʻu ʻŌʻō&quot;, meaning &quot;hill of the digging stick&quot;. The name is also often translated as &quot;Hill of the Ōō Bird&quot;. In 2021, the Hawaiʻi Board of Geographic Names updated the spelling of the cone as &quot;Pu‘u‘ō‘ō&quot; for consistency with the board&#x27;s spelling guidelines. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory began following the new recommended naming convention shortly thereafter.

== Geologic history ==

=== 1983 – 1986: High lava fountains build tall cinder and spatter cone ===

The Puu Ōō eruption began when fissures split the ground in the remote rainforest of the eastern rift zone, on January 3, 1983. By June 1983, the activity had strengthened and localized to the Puu Ōō vent. Over the next three years, 44 eruptive episodes with lava fountains as high as stopped traffic at points across east Hawaii. The fallout of cinder and spatter from the towering lava fountains built a cone high.

=== 1986 – 1991: Eruption shifts east to Kūpaianahā ===

In July 1986, the conduit feeding magma to Puu Ōō ruptured, and the eruption abruptly shifted downrift to form the Kūpaianahā vent. With the new vent came a new style of eruption: continuous, quiet effusion from a lava lake replaced the episodic high fountaining. After a few weeks, a roof formed over the main lava outflow channel, which created a lava tube. The lava tube allowed the fluid pahoehoe lava to retain heat and flow long distances. In less than a year, overflow from the lake created a broad and low shield about above Kūpaianahā.

Lava streams were first visible from the town of Kapaau in November, 1986. In the course of that month, lava cut a swath through Kapaahu, covered the coastal highway, and finally reached the ocean from the vent. Some weeks later, the lava flow shifted eastwards and buried 14 houses in the town of Kalapana within one day. The lava flow at Kalapana ceased when the lava tube system shut down.
In 1990, the eruption entered its most destructive phase, when flows turned eastward and completely destroyed the villages of Kalapana and Kaimū. Kaimū Bay and Kalapana Black Sand Beach were also completely covered with lava. Over 100 homes were destroyed by the ever-broadening flow field in a nine-month period. New tubes diverted lava away from Kalapana early in 1991, and lava once again entered the ocean within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.

=== 1992 – 2013: Steady lava effusion ===

The volume of lava erupted from Kūpaianahā declined steadily through 1991, and in early 1992, the vent died. The eruption then returned to Puu Ōō, where flank vents on the west and southwest sides of the cone constructed a new lava shield. Soon lava tubes were feeding lava from the vents to the ocean, with few surface flows in between. The flank vents have held center stage ever since, with the exception of a two-month pause in activity, early in 1997, which followed a brief fissure eruption in Nāpau Crater, a short distance southwest of Puu Ōō.

On the evening of January 29, 1997, a series of earthquakes struck Kīlauea&#x27;s east rift zone. Deep within the rift zone, magma was escaping from the conduit leading to the Puu Ōō vent, cutting off the supply to the ongoing eruption. The lava pond at Puu Ōō drained, and residents away heard a low, rumbling roar as the crater floor dropped and the west wall of the Puu Ōō cone collapsed. A few hours later, as magma found a new path to the surface, the ground cracked in nearby Nāpau Crater, and lava fountains lit up the night sky. However, activity in this area was short-lived, and the center of activity soon shifted back to Puu Ōō.


As of January 2007, 3.1 cubic km of lava had covered and added to Kīlauea&#x27;s southern shore. The new shoreline was long. The lava flows have destroyed 189 structures and covered of highway with as much as of lava.

In 2007, after a cluster of earthquakes, activity in Puu Ōō subsided and the crater floor collapsed, with no incandescence visible in the crater after the end of August. Lava began emerging from a series of cracks in the northeast rift zone and spread slowly east and south as a perched flow, with slow advances of aā. The flow spread mostly over flows of 1983–1986, with minor incursions into adjoining forests.

In late July 2008, additional flows extended from the eastern vents of Puu Ōō and in October multiple new fissures opened along the length of the tube expanding into Royal Gardens Subdivision and covered a large area of the coastal flats in November 2008.

On March 5, 2011, the floor of the Puu Ōō crater deflated, then collapsed. Two hours later, a new eruption occurred in Kīlauea&#x27;s middle east zone, between Puu Ōō and Napau Crater. Lava fountains were reported to be high.

On March 26, 2011, lava began to refill the crater&#x27;s floor, being visible in USGS HVO webcam. The USGS stated that the accumulation of lava had put the crater floor about below the eastern crater rim, as of June 1.

On September 21, 2011, lava in the west lava lake in Puu Ōō Crater fed a series of lava flows that traveled down the west flank of Puu Ōō during September 20–21. At about 0225 UTC on September 21, activity in the crater and overflows to the west suddenly decreased, as lava broke through the upper east flank of Puu Ōō, bypassing the crater. The new fissure fed a channelized aā lava flow that advanced rapidly downslope southeast. A second flow to the west of the first began the next day. In addition, a small pad of lava actively refilled the bottom of the drained east lava lake and small flows were barely active at the west edge of Puu Ōō Crater. The channelized aā lava flow reached long on 23 September and then stalled within the Kahaualeʻa Natural Area Reserve. Most of the active lava spread south and west of Puʻu Halulu ( northeast of Puu Ōō) during 23–27 September. Minor lava activity resumed within Puʻu ʻOʻo Crater with short lava flows issuing from the base of the east wall on 25 September and from the west wall base during 25–26 September. The crater floor of Puu Ōō slowly subsided. Lava activity resumed within the east lake on 26 September. The floor of the crater continued to subside during 26–27 September, opening up cracks in the north crater floor.

The 2011 activity ultimately destroyed all remaining homes in the Royal Gardens Subdivision. Jack Thompson evacuated his home March 2, 2012. His evacuation and return to the property was documented by Leigh Hilbert.


===2014 – 2016: Lava flow threatens Pāhoa ===
On June 27, 2014, new vents opened on the northeast flank of the Puu Ōō cone that fed a narrow lava flow to the east-northeast. On August 18, the flow entered a ground crack, traveled underground for several days, then resurfaced to form a small lava pond. The sequence was repeated twice more over the following days with lava entering other cracks and reappearing farther downslope. In this way, the flow had advanced approximately from the vent, or to within of the eastern boundary of the Wao Kele o Puna Forest Reserve, by the afternoon of September 3. Advancing to the northeast at intermittent rates, the flow had entered the village of Pāhoa and was within of the waste recycling center on October 31.

In December 2014, a sustained lava breakout from this lava flow (informally named the &quot;June 27 flow&quot; by Hawaiian Volcano Observatory scientists) threatened to enter the town of Pāhoa, and to cut Highway 130, the only route into and out of Lower Puna. As a result, work was begun to reopen Chain of Craters Road, initially as a one-lane gravelled surface, and to make Railroad Avenue and Government Beach Road usable as emergency routes. However, the flow stopped just short of entering Pāhoa.

By March 2015, the June 27 flow retreated to within 6 kilometers of Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō, greatly reducing the threat to Pāhoa. Lava from the June 27 flow remained active in this area through the remainder of 2015.

On May 24, 2016, a new vent opened on the east flank of Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō that cut the supply of lava to the June 27th flow, which became inactive by June 8, 2016. Lava from the new vent, informally named the &quot;61g&quot; flow by the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, flowed south and began entering the ocean at Kamokuna on July 26, 2016. Lava from the 61g flow covered part of the regraded (but never reopened) new section of the Chain of Craters Road. The road is kept flat for use by authorities, but is no longer a public thoroughfare.

===2018: Activity at Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō stops; eruption shifts to the Lower East Rift Zone ===
On April 30, 2018, Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō&#x27;s crater floor collapsed as magma drained from the area beneath the cone. Following the collapse, seismicity and ground deformation increased downrift of Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō. On May 3, fissures opened up at the Leilani Estates, marking the beginning of the 2018 lower Puna eruption. Through the rest of 2018, Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō continued to experience intermittent collapses.

In January 2019, Hawaiian Volcano Observatory scientists stated that, considering historical data of prior rift zone eruptions and criteria used by the Global Volcanism Program to determine the end of an eruption, the Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō eruption was most likely over.

<text>A vlog (), also known as a video blog or video log, is a form of blog for which the medium is video. Vlog entries often combine embedded video (or a video link) with supporting text, images, and other metadata. Entries can be recorded in one take or cut into multiple parts. Unlike a more general video diary, vlogs are often recorded depicting the maker throughout.

In recent years, &quot;vlogging&quot; has spawned a large community on social media, becoming one of the most popular forms of digital entertainment. It is popularly believed that, alongside being entertaining, vlogs can deliver deep context through imagery as opposed to written blogs.

Video logs (vlogs) also often take advantage of web syndication to allow for distribution of the video over the Internet, using either the RSS or Atom syndication formats, for automatic aggregation and playback on mobile devices and personal computers (see video podcast). The vlog category is popular on the video-sharing platform YouTube.

==History==
In the 1980s, New York artist Nelson Sullivan documented his experiences travelling around New York City and South Carolina by recording videos in a distinctive vlog-like style.

On January 2, 2000, Adam Kontras posted a video alongside a blog entry aimed at informing his friends and family of his cross-country move to Los Angeles in pursuit of show business, marking the first post on what would later become the longest-running video blog in history. In November of that year, Adrian Miles posted a video of changing text on a still image, coining the term &quot;vog&quot; to refer to his video blog. Filmmaker and musician Luuk Bouwman started in 2002 the now-defunct Tropisms.org site as a video diary of his post-college travels, one of the first sites to be called a vlog or videolog. In 2004, Steve Garfield launched his own video blog and declared that year &quot;the year of the video blog&quot;.

===YouTube===

Vlogging saw a strong increase in popularity beginning in 2005. The most popular video sharing site, YouTube, was founded in February 2005. The site&#x27;s co-founder Jawed Karim uploaded the first YouTube vlog clip &quot;Me at the zoo&quot; on his channel &quot;jawed&quot; in April 2005. The ordinary &quot;everydayness&quot; and &quot;dry aesthetics&quot; of &quot;Me at the zoo&quot; set the tone for the type of amateur vlogging content that would become typical of YouTube, especially among YouTubers. By July 2006, YouTube had become the fifth most popular web destination, with 100million videos viewed daily and 65,000 new uploads per day. The Yahoo! Videoblogging Group also saw its membership increase dramatically by August 2005.

Many open source content management systems have enabled the inclusion of video content, allowing bloggers to host and administer their own video blogging sites. In addition, the convergence of mobile phones with digital cameras allows publishing of video content to the Web almost as it is recorded. Radio and television stations may use video blogging as a way to help interact more with listeners and viewers.

Throughout the lifetime of the YouTube platform, vloggers have developed large social communities by expressing emotions of vulnerability and encouraging their viewers to do the same. The effect of this emotional exchange between strangers has been documented, for example, in the popularity of bereavement vlogs, in which grieving individuals reassure each other through friendly comments.

===Miscellaneous events===

* 2005, January – Vloggercon, the first vlogger conference, is held in New York City.
* 2006, November – Irina Slutsky created and hosted The Vloggies, the first annual video blog awards.
* 2007, May and August – &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; places a grandmother on the front page of its Personal Journal section. In August 2007, she was featured on an &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; segment showing the elderly now becoming involved in the online video world.
===Guinness World Record===
In May 2019, Charles Trippy was awarded the Guinness World Record for the &quot;Most Consecutive Daily Personal Video Blogs Posted On YouTube&quot;, having recorded 3653 consecutive videos to his &quot;Charles and Allie&quot; YouTube channel over the previous ten years.

== Uses ==

===Impressions===

Vlogs have made it possible to learn about a Vlogger&#x27;s persona, culture, and impressions using non-verbal hints. Researchers have conducted experiments using crowdsourcing for Amazons Mechanical Turk to determine what kind of personality traits the Vlogger might have. Many Vlogs have been personified by five big personality traits such as Extraversion, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Neuroticism, and Openness to Experience. Along with Mechanical Turk, researchers also looked at the cues that take place within Vlogs. Vlogs can be broken down to their elements considering that there are a lot of factors that play in the creation of one such as placement of camera, lighting, location, amount of time spent looking at the camera, pitch, delivery and amount of the interactions. Using this information and crowdsourcing, results have revealed that the highest rate in personality research was Agreeableness which makes Vlogging a great place to form Agreeable impressions. However, more non-verbal hints are more noticeable in other form traits such as Extraversion. Regardless, Personality impressions have made a more interesting Vlog viewing experience.

===Education===

Vlogging has been experimented with school systems to determine if it is a reliable platform to deliver higher educational practices to students. Researchers have done an experiment that placed 42 college freshmen into a control and experimental group of 21 each. Oral proficiency exams were given to all students to reflect their current speech skills, after a year of teachings based on each of the groups preference. The control group was instructed to work with their standard writing skills and create their own blogs, while the Experimental group tested their skills with online interaction. Scores for both groups had increased after both tests, however the experimental group had outperformed the control group due to the improvement of speech proficiency that came as a result of a more interactive learning environment between teachers and classmates. The control group claimed that not using video blogs &quot;lowered their confidence&quot; in their speaking proficiency.

===Health===
Researchers have investigated how vlog-style YouTube videos made by creators who suffer from chronic illnesses can raise health awareness among viewers and create social communities among those suffering. A 2014 study evaluated the contextual relationship between vloggers who shared that they had diabetes, cancer, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and their audiences. Most of the creators of these vlogs chose to focus their videos on how disease diagnosis and treatment had impacted them physically and emotionally. Commenters on the vlogs who shared personal characteristics formed ad hoc small groups; these impromptu support groups expanded over time as more and more people discovered the health vlogs.

=== Women&#x27;s rights ===
Vlogging is used by both feminist and anti-feminist voices to share their points of view. For the former, vloggers such as Hayla Ghazal who is based in Dubai, use humour to point our disparities between attitudes to genders in their country. The latter might involve &quot;tradwife&quot; content, for example.

== Live broadcasting ==

YouTube announced a live broadcasting feature called YouTube Live in 2008. This feature was also established by other social platforms such as Instagram, Facebook and Twitch.

== YouTube presence ==
YouTube currently ranks among the top three most-visited sites on the web. As a high traffic area for video bloggers, or &quot;vloggers&quot;, YouTube has created a platform for these participants to present their personal videos, which oftentimes are filmed using hand held point and shoot cameras. The popularity of vlogs in the YouTube community has risen exponentially in the past few years; out of the top 100 most subscribed YouTube channels, 17 provide vlogs as their primary style of footage. Many of these vloggers are a part of the YouTube Partner Program, which professionalizes the industry and allows for monetary gain from video production. This professionalization additionally helps increase exposure to various channels as well as creates a sense of stability within the field. Additionally, this professionalization allows content creators to be deemed a credible source by their viewers. Furthermore, many vloggers have been able to turn their channels into sustainable careers; in 2013, the highest paid vlogger brought in a minimum of $720,000 for the year. Hollywood is taking notice of this rising medium, and has placed its value ranked over other entertainment companies such as Marvel, which is also owned by Disney.

<text>Crash Team Racing (stylized as CTR: Crash Team Racing) is a 1999 kart racing video game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation. It is the fourth installment in the &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; series. The game&#x27;s story focuses on the efforts of Crash Bandicoot, Doctor Neo Cortex, and other ragtag team of characters in the &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; series, who must race against the egomaniacal Nitros Oxide to save the Earth from destruction. In the game, players can take control of one of fifteen &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; series characters, though only eight are available at first. During the races, offensive and speed boosting power-ups can be used to gain an advantage.

&quot;Crash Team Racing&quot; was released on October 19, 1999, in North America, and in December 1999 in Europe. It was praised by critics for its gameplay and graphics, though the audio was met with mixed opinions. A successor, &quot;Crash Nitro Kart&quot;, was released in 2003 for the Game Boy Advance, GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox and N-Gage. A remaster of the game, titled &quot;Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled&quot;, was announced at The Game Awards 2018 and was released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch on June 21, 2019.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Crash Team Racing&quot; is a kart racing game in which the player controls characters from the &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; universe, most of whom compete in karts. While racing, the player can accelerate, steer, reverse, brake, hop or use weapons and power-ups with the game controller&#x27;s analog stick and buttons. Two distinct forms of crates are scattered throughout the tracks and arenas of &quot;Crash Team Racing&quot;. Crates with question marks on them hold power-ups and weapons, which can be obtained by driving through and breaking apart said crates. When the player collects a weapon or power-up, it will appear in a box at the top of the screen. The player can activate the weapon or power-up to wreak havoc on the other racers or supplement the player&#x27;s own performance. &quot;Fruit Crates&quot; carry &quot;Wumpa Fruit&quot; that increase the speed of the player&#x27;s kart and strengthen the player&#x27;s weapons and power-ups if ten of them are obtained.

A crucial maneuver in &quot;Crash Team Racing&quot; is the power slide; the player executes the slide by holding down one of the shoulder buttons to perform a hop, and steering before the kart lands. While sliding, the &quot;Turbo Boost Meter&quot; on the lower-right corner of the screen fills up and goes from green to red. At the same time, the exhaust gas from the player&#x27;s kart turns black. To get a speed boost, the player quickly presses the opposite shoulder button while the Turbo Boost Meter is red. The player can execute three speed boosts in a row during a power slide, with the third speed boost being more powerful than the previous two. If the player waits too long into the power slide for a boost, the kart back-fires and the chance for a speed boost is lost; power sliding for too long causes a spin-out. Aside from power slides, speed boosts can be obtained by gathering when leaping over gaps in the track. The longer the player is in the air, the bigger the speed boost will be when the kart lands.

===Modes===
&quot;Crash Team Racing&quot; features 5 racing modes: Adventure, Time Trial, Arcade, Versus and Battle. In each mode, the player selects 1 from 8 characters to control. A PlayStation multitap can be installed to allow three or four-player games. The &quot;Adventure Mode&quot; is a one-player game where the player must race through all of the tracks and arenas in the game and collect as many trophies, Relics, Boss Keys, CTR Tokens and Gems as possible. The objective of the Adventure Mode is to save the world from the story&#x27;s antagonist, Nitros Oxide, by winning races on 16 different tracks. In the beginning of the game, the player only has access to two levels. As the player wins more races, more tracks on multiple worlds become available. In each level, the player must win a trophy by coming in first place. When the player receives all four trophies in a world, the &quot;Boss Garage&quot; of that world can be accessed. In the Boss Garage, the player competes in a one-on-one race against a boss character. If the boss character is defeated, the character will relinquish a Boss Key, which the player uses to access new worlds and ultimately to face Oxide inside his spaceship.

After beating levels, new modes become available, such as the Relic Race, in which the player races through the track alone and completes three laps in the fastest time possible. &quot;Time Crates&quot; scattered throughout the level freeze the game timer when a player drives through them. If all of the Time Crates are destroyed, the player&#x27;s final time is reduced by ten seconds. The player wins a Relic by beating the time indicated on the screen. Another mode, the CTR Challenge, is played like a normal race, except that the player must also collect the letters C, T and R scattered throughout the track. If the player manages to collect all three letters and come in first place, a &quot;CTR Token&quot; is awarded. These tokens come in five different colors: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow and Purple. The Purple CTR tokens are awarded for beating the Crystal Bonus Round by collecting 20 crystals under a certain time limit. If the player collects four tokens of the same color, the player will be able to access the Gem Cup of the corresponding color. Gem Cups are racing tournaments held against computer-controlled opponents and are accessible in a secret area in the &quot;Gemstone Valley&quot; world. A Gem Cup consists of four tracks in a row, in which the player must race for points. If one of these cups is won, a Gem is awarded. To win the game, the player must collect all trophies, Boss Keys, Relics, CTR Tokens and Gems before defeating Nitros Oxide in a one-on-one race.

The &quot;Time Trial&quot; mode is a single-player mode where the player attempts to set the best time on any of the tracks in the game. There are no other racers to hinder the player and no power-ups. When the Time Trial is finished, the player has the option to save a &quot;ghost&quot;, a replay of that race; the next time that track is accessed in this mode, the player can race against the ghost. In the &quot;Arcade&quot; mode, the player can quickly scroll through and race on a selection of tracks. The player can choose to select a Single Race or enter a Cup, in which the player races on four tracks in a row for points. In the Single Race and the Cup Race, one or two players race with the remaining computer-controlled drivers. The difficulty of the race and number of laps can be customized. The &quot;Versus&quot; mode is similar to that of the Arcade mode, with the exception that two or more human players must be involved.

In the &quot;Battle&quot; mode, up to four players can fight customized battles, launching weapons during combat in one of seven special battle arenas. The type and length (the latter modifies how many hit points or minutes the battle will have) of the battle can be adjusted beforehand, allowing for three types of battles. In a &quot;Point Limit Mode&quot; battle, the first player to achieve 5, 10 or 15 points wins. In the &quot;Time Limit Mode&quot; battle, the player with the highest points after 3, 6 or 9 minutes wins. In the &quot;Life Limit Mode&quot;, each player has a set number of lives (3, 6 or 9) and the battle has a time limit (3, 6 minutes or forever). The player with the most lives at the end of the time limit wins. If &quot;forever&quot; is chosen as the length, the battle lasts until only one player is standing. Three and four players can team up for 2-vs.-1, 2-vs.-2, 3-vs.-1 or 1-vs.-1-vs.-2 battles.

==Plot==

===Characters===

Fifteen characters are playable in &quot;Crash Team Racing&quot;, although only eight of them are playable from the start. Crash Bandicoot, the main protagonist of the series, is an all-round racer with balanced acceleration, top speed and handling. Doctor Neo Cortex, Crash&#x27;s archenemy, is a mad scientist who wants to stop Nitros Oxide so that he may conquer the world himself. Like Crash, his kart is an all-round performer. Coco Bandicoot, Crash&#x27;s younger sister, is a computer genius who installed computer chips into her kart to increase its acceleration prowess. Doctor N. Gin is a rocket scientist who, like Coco, added custom parts to his kart to improve its acceleration. Pura and Polar pilot karts with low speed but improved handling, allowing them to navigate tight corners. Tiny Tiger and Dingodile control karts built for top speed at the cost of turning prowess.

The main antagonist of the story, Nitros Oxide, is the self-proclaimed fastest racer in the galaxy who threatens to turn Earth into a concrete parking lot and make its inhabitants his slaves. Oxide appears only as an opponent in the game&#x27;s final race and time trials, and cannot be controlled by the player. Preceding Oxide are four boss characters: Ripper Roo, a deranged straitjacket-wearing kangaroo; Papu Papu, the corpulent leader of the island&#x27;s native tribe; Komodo Joe, a Komodo dragon with a speech sound disorder; and Pinstripe Potoroo, a greedy pinstripe-clad potoroo. The four boss characters, along with an imperfect and morally ambiguous clone of Crash Bandicoot named Fake Crash, become accessible as playable characters if the Adventure Mode is fully completed. Doctor Nefarious Tropy appears as the player&#x27;s opponent during the Time Trial races and an unlockable playable character, while a bonus character, Penta Penguin, can only be unlocked via cheat code.

Appearing as the player&#x27;s tutors in the game are the sentient twin witch-doctor masks Aku Aku and Uka Uka, both of whom give hints that help the player develop their racing skills. They double as obtainable &quot;Invincibility Mask&quot; power-ups during the races, temporarily protecting the player from all attacks and obstacles while increasing the kart&#x27;s speed. However, their power does not protect the player from chasms or deep water.

===Story===
The inhabitants of Earth are visited by an extraterrestrial named Nitros Oxide, who claims to be the fastest racer in the galaxy. Challenging Earth to a game called &quot;Survival of the Fastest&quot;, he beckons Earth&#x27;s best driver to race him. If Earth&#x27;s driver wins, he promises to leave Earth alone, but if Oxide wins, he will turn Earth into a concrete parking lot and enslave the Earthlings. In response, the player character gathers all four Boss Keys needed to access Oxide&#x27;s spaceship and races him in a one-on-one match. Upon Oxide&#x27;s defeat at the hands of the player character, he temporarily leaves Earth, but promises that he will return when all of the Time Relics have been gathered. Oxide faces the player again after all the Time Relics are gathered. After losing once more, Oxide keeps his word and angrily leaves Earth forever. An epilogue is relayed during the end credits, explaining what the characters of the game did after the events of the story. Nitros Oxide himself returns to his home planet of Gasmoxia and secludes himself from society. After undergoing years of therapy to cope with his loss, he takes up unicycle-racing, only to get into a gruesome accident.

==Development==

Development of &quot;Crash Team Racing&quot; started with block-headed characters with no Crash or otherwise related personalities. Naughty Dog showed their development to Sony, and showed interest in having the game be Crash-themed, to which Sony agreed, and made a deal with Universal. The game could have had original characters in case the deal did not come through. Naughty Dog began production on &quot;Crash Team Racing&quot; after the completion of &quot;Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back&quot;; the game engine for &quot;Crash Team Racing&quot; was created at the same time &quot;Crash Bandicoot: Warped&quot; was produced. Development took place over the course of eight months on a budget of $2.4 million by a team of 16–18 staff. The characters of the game were designed by Charles Zembillas and Joe Pearson, who designed the characters of the last three installments of the series. Nitros Oxide was originally a mad scientist obsessed with speed who plotted to speed up the entire world until the end of time. However, having exhausted human, animal, machine, and various combinations for &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; bosses in the past, it was decided to have Nitros Oxide be an otherworldly character. The original &quot;speed up the world&quot; plot is referenced in a promotional comic (written by Glenn Herdling and drawn by Neal Sternecky) featured in the Winter 2000 issue of &quot;Disney Adventures&quot;.

During the game&#x27;s prototypical stage, the team built a replica of the &quot;Crescent Island&quot; course from &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot; to test whether a racetrack of the same scope and scale was possible on the PlayStation. To address the complication of potentially having up to 64 kart tires on a four-player split-screen, programmer Greg Omi developed a method of rendering the tires as camera-based two-dimensional sprites. The turbo system that gives the player boosts of speed during power slides and by gathering hang time was added to make &quot;Crash Team Racing&quot; feel more interactive and involving than older kart-racing games. The central antagonist character Oxide was never intended to be playable in the game due to the PlayStation console&#x27;s memory limitations. Said limitations further affected the game&#x27;s roster of playable characters; Polar and Pura were originally to ride in the same kart and be played as a single character, but were ultimately split into separate characters, and both Komodo Brothers were to appear in the game before Komodo Moe was omitted.

David Baggett produced the game&#x27;s soundtrack, with Josh Mancell of Mutato Muzika composing the music. Sound effects were created by Mike Gollum (who also provided some voice-acting), Ron Horwitz and Kevin Spears of Universal Sound Studios. The voice of Crash was provided by Chip Chinery, while Clancy Brown voiced Doctor Neo Cortex and Uka Uka, and Brendan O&#x27;Brien voiced Doctor N. Gin, Tiny Tiger and Pinstripe Potoroo. Additional voices were provided by David A. Pizzuto, Mel Winkler, Michael Ensign, Hynden Walch, Billy Pope and Michael Connor. &quot;Crash Team Racing&quot; went into the alpha stage of development in August 1999, and the beta stage on September. NASCAR vehicle No. 98 was given a custom &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot;-themed paint job in promotion of the game. A playable demonstration was included on a promotional compilation disc released by Pizza Hut on November 14, 1999.

==Reception==
&quot;Crash Team Racing&quot; received &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; described &quot;Crash Team Racing&quot; as &quot;the game that made kart racing cool&quot; and proclaimed that &quot;nothing has ever matched its quality.&quot; &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; noted that the game was &quot;heavily inspired by &quot;Mario Kart&quot;, but still an amazing multiplayer racer.&quot; Doug Perry of IGN stated that the game was &quot;rock solid&quot; in playability and graphics, but was critical of &quot;the insanely capitalistic smile of Crash.&quot; Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot called the game &quot;a great &quot;Mario Kart&quot; clone&quot;, and opined that it succeeded where similar games like &quot;Mega Man Battle &amp; Chase&quot;, &quot;Bomberman Fantasy Race&quot;, &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot;, &quot;Chocobo Racing&quot; and &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; had failed. Johnny Liu of &quot;GameRevolution&quot; concluded that despite the fact that the game &quot;doesn&#x27;t add much to the tired genre, it manages to do everything well.&quot;

The game&#x27;s controls were well received. The D-Pad Destroyer of &quot;GamePro&quot; praised the controls as &quot;nearly-perfect&quot; and explained that &quot;the transparent controls allow you to concentrate on racing and blasting your opponents, and so the races are faster, more fluid and more fun.&quot; Johnny Liu of &quot;GameRevolution&quot; concluded that the controls &quot;feel very natural, with an emphasis on maintaining speed rather than fighting lousy controls.&quot; However, Joe Ottoson of All Game Guide said that the inability to reconfigure the controls was &quot;the only real drawback to &quot;Crash&quot;&#x27;s presentation.&quot;

The graphics of the game were positively received. The D-Pad Destroyer of &quot;GamePro&quot;, while noting that the graphics were not too complex, cited the &quot;cartoony look and the ingenious use of textures and colors&quot; as high points in the graphics department. Doug Perry of IGN commended the &quot;sharp looking&quot; environments as &quot;clean and fully formed&quot; and the characters are &quot;full of funny animations and cleanly designed&quot;. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot said that the environments &quot;are reasonably large, and they convey the cartoon-like attitude of the game very nicely.&quot; &quot;GameRevolution&quot; Johnny Liu stated that the graphics were &quot;smooth and seem to push the PlayStation&#x27;s limits.&quot;

Critics expressed mixed opinions of the game&#x27;s audio. The D-Pad Destroyer of &quot;GamePro&quot; said that the &quot;whimsical&quot; background music is &quot;quite enjoyable&quot; and the character sound bites are &quot;varied enough to avoid becoming annoying.&quot; IGN&#x27;s Doug Perry had a more mixed take, saying that the &quot;classic bouncy, xylophone-heavy beat&quot; is &quot;not necessarily great&quot;, and that after a few courses, &quot;you either stop hearing it, or the incessant simplicity of it makes you want to cry or pull your hair out&quot;. On the subject of the voice acting, he concluded that there is &quot;nothing really that cute, clever or memorable&quot; in the game, and noted that Crash&#x27;s voice in the game is extremely similar to that of Luigi from the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot wrote that while the music and sound effects &quot;push the game&#x27;s cartoon theme,&quot; the themes were not too &quot;over the top&quot; or incessant. Johnny Liu of &quot;GameRevolution&quot; passed the music off as &quot;standard kitschy fare&quot; and added that while the sound effects &quot;add to the cartoon quality of the game&quot;, some of the character voices were unsatisfactory. Joe Ottoson of Allgame noted that the characters &quot;are all quite vocal&quot;, and the music &quot;sets off the whimsical mood nicely&quot;.

&quot;Crash Team Racing&quot; was nominated for Console Racing Game of the Year at the 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards. 

===Sales===
&quot;Crash Team Racing&quot; has sold 1.9 million units in the United States and over 300,000 units in Japan. As a result of its success, the game was re-released for the Sony Greatest Hits line-up in 2000 and for the Platinum Range on January 12, 2001. An indirect sequel titled &quot;Crash Nitro Kart&quot; was released in 2003 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, Game Boy Advance and N-Gage and was the first game in the &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; series to feature full motion video.

<doc id="1305365" wikidata="Q3072525" url="?curid=1305365" title="Financial Post">
<text>The Financial Post is a financial news website, and business section of the &quot;National Post&quot;, both publications of the Postmedia Network. It started as an English Canadian business newspaper, which published from 1907 to 1998. In 1998, the publication was folded into the new &quot;National Post&quot;. The name &quot;Financial Post&quot; also lives on in the &quot;Post&quot;″s monthly business magazine, &quot;Financial Post Business&quot;.

The &quot;Financial Post&quot; started publication in 1907 by John Bayne Maclean. It was a weekly publication, and one of the core assets of Maclean&#x27;s media business, which eventually became Maclean-Hunter.

The paper was purchased by Sun Media in 1987, and expanded into a daily tabloid on February 1, 1988, and added newspaper home delivery in 1990, with a reformatted &quot;Financial Post Magazine&quot; following shortly after. In 1998, Sun Media sold the &quot;Financial Post&quot; to Hollinger, whose CEO Conrad Black had been seeking a way to establish a national newspaper. Sun Media acquired the &quot;Kitchener-Waterloo Record&quot;, the &quot;Guelph Mercury&quot;, the &quot;Hamilton Spectator&quot; and the &quot;Cambridge Reporter&quot; from Hollinger in exchange, but has since sold all four papers.

The Hollinger transaction was finalized in July 1998. Originally slated to launch on October 5, 1998, the &quot;National Post&quot;″s launch was delayed until October 27 by the financial complications of the &quot;Financial Post&quot; purchase.

The &quot;Financial Post&quot; retains a loyal audience of English business readers in Canada, offering coverage similar to the &quot;Report on Business&quot; by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. Though there has been frequent speculation that the &quot;Financial Post&quot; would be merged into the business sections of the regional newspapers owned by the &quot;National Post&quot;″s parent, Postmedia News, much of the &quot;Post&quot;″s editorial content is now syndicated to other Postmedia newspapers through the Postmedia News Service. The &quot;Financial Post&quot; publishes several popular editorial features throughout the year, including the annual competition Financial Post&#x27;s Ten Best Companies to Work For.

Editors of the paper included Floyd Chalmers, John Godfrey and Diane Francis, who was the paper&#x27;s last editor prior to the launch of the &quot;National Post&quot;.

<text>Telč (; ) is a town in the Jihlava District in the Vysočina Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 5,200 inhabitants. The town is well known for its historic centre, which is protected by law as an urban monument reservation and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Administrative division==
Telč consists of five municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Telč-Podolí (970)
*Telč-Staré Město (2,429)
*Telč-Štěpnice (1,414)
*Telč-Vnitřní Město (260)
*Studnice (78)
Studnice forms an exclave of the municipal territory.

==Etymology==
The settlement was originally named Teleč. The name was created by adding the possessive suffix to the personal name Telec (meaning &quot;young calf&quot;) and was masculine. The current name Telč is feminine.

==Geography==

Telč is located about southwest of Jihlava. It lies in the Křižanov Highlands. The highest point is the hill Studnická Ostražka at above sea level, located near Studnice.

The stream of Telčský potok flows through the town and contributes the Moravian Thaya River in the south. The Moravian Thaya partly forms the eastern border of the municipal territory. The territory of Telč is rich in fishponds. The system of ponds Štěpnický rybník, Ulický rybník and Staroměstský rybník is located in the centre of the town.

==History==
According to local legend, the town was founded in 1099, however the first written mention is from 1335. The Gothic castle, Gothic houses and water fortification were built in the mid-14th century. The development ended during the Hussite Wars. The town was conquered by the Hussites but the castle resisted.

Telč slowly recovered and another period of prosperity occurred during the rule of Zachariáš of Hradec. In the middle of the 16th century, he had the medieval castle rebuilt in the Renaissance style. He also had the Gothic houses rebuilt into Renaissance houses with arcades and decorated façades. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the town was shortly occupied by the Swedish army. The counter-reformation brought the Jesuits to the town, who built the Church of the Name of Jesus in 1667, and founded the Jesuit Latin Grammar School.

During the 18th century, the town profited from wealthy townspeople who had statues, fountains, chapels and Marian column built. In 1773, the rights of the Jesuit Order were cancelled. From 1785, Telč was germanised. During the 19th century, the industry developed. The railway was built in 1898.

==Demographics==
==Transport==
Telč is located on the railway line Havlíčkův Brod–Slavonice. The town is served by two train stations.

==Sights==

The historic town centre is located between the Štěpnický and Ulický ponds and also delimited by town walls. The historic centre is protected as an urban monument reservation and the town part of Telč-Staré Město is an urban monument zone. Since 1992, Telč has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The town square is a unique complex of long urban plaza with well-conserved Renaissance and Baroque houses with high gables and arcades. The houses have been uniformly reconstructed in the Renaissance styles and later gables and façades of some of them were individually remodelled, in most cases in the Baroque style.

The 17th-century Renaissance château with an English-style park is one of the main landmarks of the square and whole town. One of the most valuable parts is the Chapel of All Saints with stucco decoration. There are several exhibition routes and the château also houses a branch of the Vysočina Museum with ethnographic, historical and archaeological collections.

==In popular culture==
In 1963 Vojtěch Jasný made the film &quot;The Cassandra Cat&quot; in Telč. In 1979 Werner Herzog filmed the movie &quot;Woyzeck&quot; in Telč.

Multiple Czech fairy tale movies were filmed in the Telč Castle, most known are &quot;The Proud Princess&quot; (1952) and &quot;Z pekla štěstí&quot; (1999).

The duo was formed in 1983 in Zürich, Switzerland, by Felix Haug (drums and keyboards) and Kurt Maloo (guitar and vocals) out of the trio Ping Pong of which both Maloo and Haug were members. Ping Pong formed in 1981, and had some early success with a single entitled &quot;Rhythm Walk&quot;. They also recorded with Phil Manzanera of Roxy Music, though due to legal issues none of their collaborations were able to be released.

Ping Pong had some success with singles and several appearances around Europe in music festivals.

Prior to releasing their debut album, the duo issued a few singles, of which &quot;Naningo&quot;, &quot;Rangoon Moon&quot;, and &quot;Woman of the World&quot; were the most popular. The duo were initially into experimental rock with &quot;Naningo&quot;, featuring music unlike that on their later albums.

The high point of the duo&#x27;s career came shortly after the late 1985 release of their first full-length album, &quot;Blue&quot;. The album contained two of the band&#x27;s earlier singles as well as the international smash hit, &quot;The Captain of Her Heart&quot;; a plaintive, atmospheric ballad, which was an immediate success throughout Europe upon its 1986 single release. It reached No. 8 in the UK Singles Chart, and eventually hit the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at the end of the year, climbing to No. 16.

Their next album, &quot;Dou3le&quot;, followed in 1987, but, despite including the acclaimed single &quot;Devils Ball&quot;, it failed to emulate the success of its predecessor. The pair began work on a third album, but split by early 1989 due to musical differences, though they remained friends. Haug began to compose music for films and advertising, while Kurt Maloo pursued a solo career, in the course of which he has released five albums – &quot;Single&quot; (1990), &quot;Soul and Echo&quot; (1995), &quot;Loopy Avenue&quot; (2006), &quot;Summer of Better Times&quot; (2009) and &quot;What About&quot; (2014).

During the late 1990s the pair reunited in Can Studio in Cologne to record nine new tracks. The duo were happy with the results, but it was felt there was not enough material for an album, and the project was postponed. In 2003, for the 20th anniversary of the band, the pair attempted to complete the project; however, Felix Haug died following a heart attack on 1 May 2004. Maloo took the results of this session and gave the tracks to Pit Baumgartner for remixing. These were included on Maloo&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Loopy Avenue&quot;.

==Members==
* Kurt Maloo – vocals, acoustic guitar (1983–1987)

<text>Molly Hatchet is an American rock band formed by guitarist Dave Hlubek in Jacksonville, Florida in 1971. They experienced popularity and commercial success during the late 1970s and early to mid-1980s amongst southern rock and hard rock communities and listeners. The band released six studio albums on Epic Records between 1978 and 1984, including the platinum-selling hit records &quot;Molly Hatchet&quot; (1978), &quot;Flirtin&#x27; with Disaster&quot; (1979) and &quot;Beatin&#x27; the Odds&quot; (1980). They also had charting singles on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, including &quot;Flirtin&#x27; with Disaster&quot;, &quot;The Rambler&quot;, &quot;Bloody Reunion&quot; and &quot;Satisfied Man&quot;. Molly Hatchet has released many more studio albums since their split with Epic Records in 1985, although none have been as successful as their early albums, nor have charted in the United States.

As of August 2, 2020, all of the band&#x27;s original members are deceased. The Molly Hatchet trademark is owned by Bobby Ingram, their guitarist since 1987 (when he replaced founding member Dave Hlubek, who rejoined the band eighteen years later and stayed with them until his death in 2017). The other veteran in the lineup is keyboardist John Galvin, who has been a member since 1984 (with the exception of a break in the mid-1990s). Also included in the current lineup are veteran musicians of the Southern scene, drummer Shawn Beamer, bassist Tim Lindsey and vocalist Parker Lee.

==History==
=== Classic era and commercial success (1971–1980)===
Molly Hatchet was founded by guitarist Dave Hlubek in 1971. The band originated and was based in Jacksonville, Florida, and shared influences and inspiration with what is perhaps the most well-known act in the Southern rock genre, Lynyrd Skynyrd.

During the late 1960s, Hlubek (vocals, guitar), Skip Lake (drums), Tim Lindsey (bass) and Chris Caruso (keyboards) were in the Psychedelic music outfit Mind Garden. Lindsey left (only to return many years later and is the current bassist for Hatchet) and Hlubek and Lake formed Molly Hatchet in 1971, along with lead singer/frontman Bobby Maddox and guitarist Steve Holland, who had replaced Caruso. Guitarist Donald Hall was also briefly a member in these early days, after Holland left temporarily in 1973.

In an interview Dave Hlubek told the story of the band&#x27;s name:

&quot;A friend of ours went to University of Florida in Gainesville. Bobby Maddox was his name. This was long before Danny Joe. Bobby Maddox was a real Mick Jagger type. We were looking for a name for the band. We were wanting to work. There were around twelve rock clubs in the Jacksonville area in the 70s. You could make a hell of a living. By the time you made your way through the twelfth, it was time to start all over again. We were changing the name of the band every two weeks. They would just get used to the name of the group and we would finish the twelfth club and start over as &quot;The Imbeciles&quot; or something. People would not know who we were. This was the same band that packed the place a few weeks before. Finally, we said, &#x27;We need to come up with a name for the group.&#x27; We took a John Deere Tractor hat and everybody came up with three names apiece and put them in the hat. We did it like the lottery. We said that whatever name was pulled out of the hat, by God, was going to be the name of the band and that&#x27;s it. Well, the eighteenth name, the only one left, was Molly Hatchet! We said, ‘What the hell is that&#x27;? Everyone was asking, ‘Who&#x27;s the girl in the band&#x27;? The people of Jacksonville took it upon themselves to start making bumper stickers. We just kept the name. Molly was an axe murderess. Her name was Abigail something. The history books called her Hatchet Molly. She was some passion killer.
Bassist Banner Thomas joined in 1973, invited by his friend Donald Hall. During this period, the band even toyed with changing the group&#x27;s name to Bandit but soon went back to the Molly Hatchet moniker. Maddox was gone by this time and shortly afterwards, Hall was replaced by Duane Roland and Fred Bianco, a friend Thomas had met working in a music store, joined as drummer. Roland only lasted a month before he left and Kenny Niblick was the new guitarist until he and Bianco quit in mid-1975 as Steve Holland returned and Bruce Crump became the drummer. Roland (who had subbed for Hlubek for some shows) returned to take his position as third guitarist in the band later on the following year. And after Maddox left, Hlubek was the band&#x27;s vocalist prior to former Rum Creek singer Danny Joe Brown&#x27;s entrance in the spring of 1976.

The first lineup of Molly Hatchet to record was in place by 1976. Guitarists Dave Hlubek and Steve Holland, bassist Banner Thomas and drummer Bruce Crump were joined in the spring of 1976 by Brown. And Duane Roland returned later during that same year to complete the group, leading to the so called &quot;Three Guitar Army&quot;. In a 2008 interview in &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine, Crump talked about the band&#x27;s early days, signing with manager Pat Armstrong and Ronnie Van Zant&#x27;s interest in producing Molly Hatchet:

&quot;We started playing the Florida bar circuit until some of the guys from 38 Special recommended a guy they knew from Macon, Georgia who had managed a few bands. Pat Armstrong and his brother Jack ran a management/booking agency in Macon, so we went up and played for them. I guess they liked what they heard, because they encouraged us to start writing our own material. We did just that, and the next thing you know, we’re in the studio recording some demos. By now we’re into 1977, and Ronnie Van Zant from Skynyrd got wind of what we were doing and took us under his wing—even letting us cut some songs at the Skynyrd studio. As best as I can remember, Ronnie was given the green light to produce some bands and we were going to be one of them. Then the worst possible thing happened. We were coming back to Atlanta after playing a gig near Lynchburg, Tennessee. When we pulled into the hotel parking lot, Pat Armstrong, who had become our manager and had gone with us, went inside the hotel to check us in. All of a sudden, he walked onto the bus, white as a sheet, and said that the Skynyrd plane had crashed.&quot;
After meeting recording engineer Tony Reale in Atlanta, Armstrong was introduced to Epic Records producer and A&amp;R man Tom Werman, who recommended them to Epic head Lenny Petze, who signed the band in December 1977. Werman, the producer on their first record, who was known for working with straight rock music acts such as Cheap Trick and Ted Nugent, combined boogie, blues and hard rock. The band released their first album, &quot;Molly Hatchet&quot;, in September 1978, supported by &quot;Dreams I&#x27;ll Never See&quot; (a cover of the Allman Brothers Band 1969 track &quot;Dreams&quot;), which got AOR (album-oriented rock) airplay. The album was followed a year later by &quot;Flirtin&#x27; with Disaster&quot;, with its title song another AOR hit, as was its first track, &quot;Whiskey Man&quot;, from the album. Molly Hatchet proceeded to tour behind both records and expanded their fan base, appearing at theaters, arenas and stadiums with the likes of AC/DC, Aerosmith, The Babys, The Charlie Daniels Band, Cheap Trick, Def Leppard, Journey, Judas Priest, Eddie Money, The Outlaws, REO Speedwagon, Rush, Santana, Scorpions, Bob Seger, Thin Lizzy, .38 Special, Pat Travers, UFO and The Who.

===First changes and breakup (1980–1990)===
Lead singer Danny Joe Brown left the band in May 1980 due to diabetes and conflicts with the others, only to return two years later. After Brown left Molly Hatchet, he formed the Danny Joe Brown Band.

Brown was then replaced in Molly Hatchet by vocalist Jimmy Farrar, a native of LaGrange, Georgia. The earlier albums seemed to some commentators to exhibit a distinct southern cultural influence; that sound changed with the addition of Farrar. Danny Joe Brown&#x27;s stage persona, gruff voice and cowboy horse-whistling were replaced by Jimmy Farrar&#x27;s new vocal style, mixed with a new, harder-rocking sound. 

With the success of the next album, &quot;Beatin&#x27; the Odds&quot; released in September 1980, the band had started to venture away from the Southern rock sound of their first albums. Nonetheless, Molly Hatchet toured successfully in support of &quot;Beatin&#x27; the Odds&quot;, opening for bands such as Blue Öyster Cult, AC/DC and The Outlaws, as well as headlining their own tour that was supported by the Michael Schenker Group and the Johnny Van Zant Band. 

By 1981, Molly Hatchet had evolved to a straight-ahead rock style and a slicker production, as exhibited on &quot;Take No Prisoners&quot; (November 1981). The band remained a successful act on the touring circuit.

Longtime bass player Banner Thomas abruptly quit the band after playing a show with the Rolling Stones at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, New York on November 28, 1981 following a heated argument with the other band members and was replaced by Ralph &quot;Riff&quot; West (ex-White Witch). During the following year, drummer B. B. Borden (also known as B. B. Queen as a member of the funk rock band Mother&#x27;s Finest) replaced Crump, who had moved to Los Angeles. Farrar then left the group to make way for Brown&#x27;s return. Brown rejoined the band in May 1982.

In March 1983 the line-up of Brown, Hlubek, Holland, Roland, West and Borden released the band&#x27;s fifth album &quot;No Guts...No Glory&quot;. While touring for the album during the spring and summer of 1983, Hatchet was touring with fellow Jacksonville natives Blackfoot. Just before a gig at Memorial Hall in Kansas City, Kansas on June 11, 1983, though, Brown, Holland and Roland decided to leave and return home, leaving only Hlubek, West and Borden to play the show. After a quick rehearsal backstage, Blackfoot&#x27;s Rickey Medlocke took Brown&#x27;s place as front man and their other guitarist, Charlie Hargrett, played behind Hlubek&#x27;s lead. Danny and the other members of Molly Hatchet rejoined the tour the next day, but Holland decided to leave the band once again in 1984 and was replaced by former Danny Joe Brown Band keyboardist John Galvin, who already guested in &quot;No Guts..No Glory&quot; the year before. 

In November 1984 the album &quot;The Deed Is Done&quot; was released, produced by Terry Manning, which was more of a straightforward Pop rock offering, with Bruce Crump returning on drums.

November 1985 featured the unveiling of the band&#x27;s double live album &quot;Double Trouble Live&quot;, after which the band was dropped by Epic. After mulling over possibly changing their sound to even more of a Pop rock style, they ended up retaining Brown and their Southern rock style.

Guitarist/founder Hlubek, who later admitted to suffering from drug troubles, left Molly Hatchet in January 1987. He was replaced by Bobby Ingram, who had contributed backup vocals to &quot;Double Trouble&quot;, had played as a guitarist in the Danny Joe Brown Band together with John Galvin and had also played in the Seventies with Brown in Rum Creek.

In the summer of 1988, Scott Zsymoski filled in on drums for Bruce Crump, who was home with his wife as she was giving birth to their baby. 

Molly Hatchet&#x27;s first studio album in five years, and only release on Capitol Records, &quot;Lightning Strikes Twice&quot; was released in 1989, and was their first one not to appear on the charts. One of its singles, &quot;There Goes the Neighborhood&quot;, did, however, enter the top 30 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The band went on a year-long tour to support the album, playing smaller venues such as clubs and theaters, as opposed to the stadiums and arenas that had expanded their popularity.

On July 8, 1990 Molly Hatchet, which had been dropped by Capitol after the commercial failure of &quot;Lighting Strikes Twice&quot;, announced at a show in Toledo, Ohio, that the concert would be their final one; after that night, the band would be disbanding. A greatest hits collection released by Epic, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, featuring two newly recorded songs, was released in the fall of 1990, with sales reaching gold status. At the time Duane Roland, left as last in 1990, was the owner of the Molly Hatchet name. The agreement in the band had always been that the last man standing got the brand.

=== Refoundation and rotating members (1990–2005)===

In late 1990, after some failed attempts to involve former members, a revised version of the band led by Brown and Ingram - both temporarily licensed from guitarist Duane Roland and Armstrong Management to the use of the name Molly Hatchet - featured new players Rik Blanz (guitar), Rob Scavetto (keyboards), Eddie Rio (bass) and David Feagle (drums). But the lineup in the 1990s was more like a revolving door. Rio was replaced in 1991 by Rob Sweat and then Kevin Rian. Feagle was succeeded the same year by drummer Kenny Holton. Blanz left in mid-1991 and Phil McCormack stood in for Brown briefly in early 1992.

By 1993, the lineup was: Brown, Ingram, Erik Lundgren (guitar, from The Johnny Van Zant Band), Mac Crawford (drums) and a returning Banner Thomas (bass), with Mike Kach (keyboards), who was replaced in 1994 by Andy Orth. Bryan Bassett (ex-Wild Cherry) took over as second guitarist in 1994 and Buzzy Meekins (formerly of the Outlaws and Danny Joe Brown Band) was bassist after Banner left again in 1995.

During the first half of the 1990s, Molly Hatchet played selected shows and tours, but did not record again until 1995, when they began working on a new studio album with German producer Kalle Trapp.

In April 1995 after continuing health problems, Brown had to once again leave the band and Jimmy Farrar was brought back for a few weeks to front the group and help &quot;legitimize&quot; the current version. The crowd reaction to Farrar being back was not overly positive, though, so Ingram and Brown together made the decision to bring back Brown&#x27;s 1992 stand-in, Phil McCormack, as the permanent singer. During the rest of the decade, the line-up did not feature any of the members who had performed in Molly Hatchet prior to 1983. Farrar later rejoined other original members of Molly Hatchet in Southern Rock Allstars and Gator Country.

McCormack fronted Molly Hatchet for their next album &quot;Devil&#x27;s Canyon&quot; (June 1996). At this point, the band consisted of vocalist Phil McCormack, guitarists Bobby Ingram and Bryan Bassett, returning keyboardist John Galvin, bassist Andy McKinney, and drummer Mac Crawford. This line-up recorded also one second album &quot;Silent Reign of Heroes&quot; (June 1998). In that same period, keyboardist Tim Donovan began filling in for Galvin on the road and Sean Shannon became the group&#x27;s new drummer in 1998 after Crawford left. In 1999 the band traveled coast to coast with Charlie Daniels and the Volunteer Jam. Guitarist Mike Owings briefly filled in for Bassett in 1999 when he returned to help out his old band Foghat. He was back by the end of that year, but was then called away from Hatchet again in 2000 to become Foghat&#x27;s permanent axe man. 

Former Hatchet singer Danny Joe Brown, despite a long battle with diabetes and the effects of a stroke, was able to take the stage one last time at the Jammin&#x27; for DJB benefit concert organized by former Hatchet bassist Riff West on July 18, 1999, at Orlando, Florida&#x27;s Club LaVela. With the help of his friends and former members Bruce Crump, Banner Thomas, Steve Holland and Dave Hlubek, he ended the show with &quot;Flirtin&#x27; with Disaster&quot;.
In June 2000 Bobby Ingram became the sole owner of the trade and service mark &quot;Molly Hatchet&quot;, acquired from management and from original guitarist Duane Roland. Also in 2000, &quot;Kingdom of XII&quot; was recorded by the stable line-up of McCormack, Ingram, Bassett, Galvin, McKinney and Shannon and released in Europe and they then toured Europe to promote the album. It was released in the United States in June 2001. But new changes were ahead: after the recording of &quot;Kingdom&quot;, guitarist Russ Maxwell came aboard after Bassett left the group to rejoin Foghat.

Drummer Dale Rock replaced Sean Shannon in 2001 before Shawn Beamer (from Southern Rock Rebellion) took over the drum chair permanently that fall. Bassist Jerry Scott (formerly with Brian Howe&#x27;s band) joined in early 2002 after McKinney departed. That same year, Ingram took a short break from touring after suffering a heart attack and the band continued with only Maxwell on guitar. Also John Galvin, though he continued to appear on the band&#x27;s albums, was again not touring with the band in the 2000s (except for a short European tour in December 2001). Tim Donovan (1997–2002), Scott Woods (2002), Jeff Ravenscraft (2003–2004), Gary Corbett (2004) and Richie Del Favero (2004–2005) played live keyboards until 2005, after which the group dispensed with having a touring keyboardist for a while. Bassist Jerry Scott was replaced by J.J. Strickland in May 2003 and then by Tim Lindsey, former of Lynyrd Skynyrd, the Rossington Band, Artimus Pyle Band and Mind Garden (with longtime friend Dave Hlubek), coming full circle back to his roots to take over in June 2003. &quot;Locked and Loaded&quot; (a live recording from 2000) was released in 2003, &quot;25th Anniversary: Best of Re-Recorded&quot; followed in 2004, and &quot;Live In Hamburg&quot; (with second guitarist Jake Rutter) in 2005.

=== Continued activity and deaths of former members (2005–2023)===

From that point Molly Hatchet kept on producing music around the core duo Ingram/Galvin plus rhythm section Lindsey/Beamer, with McCormack as frontman. But 2005 marked also the return of founding member Dave Hlubek after 18 years. Initially another guitarist, Jimbo Manion, played live alongside Ingram until Hlubek had satisfied his other commitments and was able to return full time later that year.

Danny Joe Brown died on March 10, 2005 at his home in Davie, Florida. He was 53. The cause was kidney failure.
On June 19, 2006 guitarist Duane Roland died at his home in St. Augustine, Florida, at the age of 53. His death was listed as being of &quot;natural causes&quot; according to a June 25, 2006, obituary in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;.

Singer David &quot;Dino&quot; Ramsey filled in for an ill McCormack during the spring of 2006. 

With Hlubek back in the line-up, Molly Hatchet released studio albums &quot;Warriors Of The Rainbow Bridge&quot; (2005) and &quot;Justice&quot; (recorded in Germany in 2010 on SPV Records), plus one live and two cover albums. The band&#x27;s &quot;Southern Rock Masters&quot; (April 2008) was an album of classic rock covers and was released again in a slightly realtered form as &quot;Regrinding the Axes&quot; (June 2012). Molly Hatchet toured extensively once again.

In 2008 keyboardist John Galvin returned to the live stage after Hlubek&#x27;s recurring health issues prevented him from appearing at all of the band&#x27;s gigs.

In 2011 drummer Shawn Beamer had a heart attack and a temporary drummer, Scott Craig, was brought in. In 2013 Beamer returned to the band.

In 2014 former bassist &quot;Riff&quot; West died from the complications of a car accident, while in 2015 it was original drummer Bruce Crump who died after a bout with throat cancer.
On September 2, 2017, guitarist Dave Hlubek died of a heart attack. After Hlubek&#x27;s passing, the group continued to perform with just one guitarist, as Ingram stated that he &quot;could not&quot; replace him. The typical guitar harmonies of the band are reproduced by Ingram and the keyboards of Galvin.
In the same year also original bassist Banner Thomas died.
On October 29, 2018, former singer of the Eighties Jimmy Farrar died due to complications from congestive heart failure, kidney failure and liver failure.

Molly Hatchet continued to tour extensively but had to replace frontman Phil McCormack due to persistent illness conditions. Singer Jimmy Elkins, from a Hatchet tribute band called Bounty Hunter, took his place for live gigs. McCormack died on April 25, 2019.

Jimmy Elkins was officially announced as the band&#x27;s new vocalist in October 2019: he is featured on the &quot;Battleground&quot; live album. Tony Mikus (Big Engine) briefly stood in for Elkins in some live gigs of 2022.

Steve Holland, the last original member of the group, died on August 2, 2020.

=== Recent events (2023–present)===
Despite having no original members left, Molly Hatchet continues to perform and record. Their current lineup features half of the &quot;Lightning Strikes Twice&quot; era lineup (guitarist Bobby Ingram and keyboardist John Galvin) plus twenty and more years serving members, drummer Shawn Beamer and bassist Tim Lindsey.

In early 2023, new singer Parker Lee suddenly replaced Jimmy Elkins (who suffered a bad bike accident) fronting the band in US and European tours. Ingram reported to the press that a new Molly Hatchet album was in the works and intended for a 2024 release. The band debuted with Lee on vocals &quot;Firing Line&quot;, their first song in thirteen years, on November 15, 2023.

==Name and iconic cover art==
Molly Hatchet took its name from a prostitute who allegedly mutilated and decapitated her clients. One iconic aspect of Molly Hatchet&#x27;s image is that many of the band&#x27;s album covers feature art inspired by heroic fantasy, several of which were painted by artists such as Frank Frazetta, Boris Vallejo, and Paul R. Gregory.

<text>The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) is an office of the U.N. Secretariat that promotes and facilitates peaceful international cooperation in outer space. It works to establish or strengthen the legal and regulatory frameworks for space activities, and assists developing countries in using space science and technology for sustainable socioeconomic development.

The Office was established in 1958 to assist and advise the &quot;ad hoc&quot; Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS), which was established by the UN General Assembly to discuss the scientific and legal aspects of exploring and using outer space to benefit humankind. The Committee became permanent the following year, with UNOOSA undergoing several structural changes before its relocation in 1993 to the United Nations Office in Vienna, Austria.

As the secretariat of COPUOS, the Office is responsible for helping implement the major international treaties, legal principles, and General Assembly resolutions that together comprise space law. Other duties include advising governments and nongovernmental organizations on space law; maintaining a registry of vessels and objects launched into space; convening forums to discuss various space-related matters; and sponsoring programmes that provide access to space technology.

== History ==
In 1957, the launching of &quot;Sputnik 1&quot; prompted a global conversation and debate on the legal, scientific, and political implications of space exploration.

On 13 December 1958, the &quot;ad hoc&quot; Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) was established by the General Assembly in its resolution 1348 (XIII), becoming a permanent body within the General Assembly. They soon met for the first time to discuss a peaceful and legally ordered approach to space exploration. Concurrently, the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) was created as a small expert unit within the UN Secretariat in New York to assist the Committee in its work.

In 1962, UNOOSA was moved to the Department of Political and Security Council Affairs (DPSCA), where it was transformed into the Outer Space Affairs Division.

In 1967, the Outer Space Treaty, which had been developed by COPUOS, entered into force, creating the first international legal framework governing the conduct of space activities.

In 1992, the Outer Space Affairs Division changed to its current form as the Office for Outer Space Affairs, remaining within Department for Political Affairs and Peacebuilding (which succeeded the DPSCA). The following year, UNOOSA was relocated to its current headquarters at the United Nations Office at Vienna.

At the start of the 21st century, UNOOSA undertook initiatives and programs to fulfill its mandate of promoting widespread and peaceful international involvement in space. In 2005, the International Committee on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (ICG) was established to promote compatibility, interoperability and transparency between all the satellite navigation systems, particularly for developing nations. The following year, the UN-SPIDER programme was created to provide an accessible platform for developing states to use space-based technologies for disaster management and emergency response. Two offices were established (in Bonn, Germany and Beijing, China) to further the programme&#x27;s work.

In 2009, Japanese astronaut Takao Doi became Chief of Space Applications.

In 2010, the Human Space Initiative was launched to further UNOOSA&#x27;s mission of providing developing countries with access to the use and exploration of space.

In March 2014, the UN Secretary-General appointed Simonetta Di Pippo of Italy as Director of the Office, who had previously served as Director of Human Spaceflight at the European Space Agency.

In September 2015, pursuant to the Human Space Initiative, UNOOSA partnered with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to launch the &quot;KiboCUBE&quot; programme, which allows developing countries to deploy their own indigenously produced CubeSats from the Japanese Kibo module on the International Space Station. Through the programme, Kenya and Guatemala launched their first satellites in 2018 and 2020, respectively.

On 16 June 2016, UNOOSA announced a partnership with the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) to give nations the opportunity to fly their experiments and personnel on board the Chinese space station Tiangong.

In September 2016, UNOOSA announced the first United Nations space mission, with an initial target launch date in 2021. The mission will utilize the Dream Chaser spaceplane, designed by the American Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), to enable developing nations to send microgravity payloads into low-Earth orbit.

In 2019, the launch date for the proposed Dream Chaser mission, expected to carry up to 35 payloads, was updated to sometime in 2024.

On 26 June 2023, Aarti Holla-Maini, former general secretary of Global Satellite Operators Association, was appointed as the current UNOOSA director.

== Mandate ==
UNOOSA works primarily to implement the decisions of UN General Assembly and of the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. The office has the dual objective of supporting the intergovernmental discussions in the Committee and its Scientific and Technical Subcommittee and Legal Subcommittee, and of assisting developing countries in using space technology for development.

The mandate has been adjusted a number of times to allow the Office to undertake, among other tasks, the coordination of the inter-agency cooperation within the United Nations on the use of space technology - UN-Space (resolution 3234 implementing the United Nations Programme on Space Applications (resolution 2601A (XXIV)) and the UN-SPIDER Programme for disaster risk management and emergency response (resolution 61/110).

The Office also coordinates and cooperates with space agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations involved in space-related activities and, on behalf of the United Nations Secretary-General, the Register of Objects Launched into Outer Space. The office also helps poor nations suffering from climate change related problems by helping them access satellite images for free.

== Structure ==
UNOOSA is headed by a Director appointed by the UN Secretary-General, from 2023 this is Aarti Holla-Maini of Belgium and the UK. The Director&#x27;s Office is responsible for public outreach, the Register on Objects in Outer Space, and programmes for youth engagement. It has two sections: the committee, Policy, and Legal Affairs (CPLA), headed by Takemi Chiku from Japan, and the Space Applications Section (SAS), headed by Lorant Czaran from Romania. The CPLA fulfills the Office&#x27;s secretarial duties to the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, its subcommittees, and its working groups. It also convenes and services the Inter Agency Meeting on Outer Space Activities, known as UN-Space, which is the central inter-agency coordination mechanisms in the UN system on overarching space matters. UN-Space meets annually to discuss current and future activities, emergent technologies of interest, and other related matters, particularly regarding the global development agenda. The section is concerned with the establishment of a legal and regulatory framework governing space activities, and actively fosters capacity-building in space law and policy.

The Space Applications Section works on building capacities in the practical application of space technology and space-derived information for development. The Programme concentrates its efforts on ensuring the equal access of all countries to new space-based technologies, especially developing nations. To facilitate the capacity building with focus on developing countries, the office provides three initiatives:

* The Human Space Initiative focuses on the public outreach to promote increased awareness among Member States to the benefits of space technology and its applications.
* The Basic Space Technology Initiative enhances access to space application tools for sustainable development through building capacity in basic space technology.
* The Basic Space Science Initiative supports the growth of small research groups in universities and research institutions in the developing countries in the fields of astronomy and space science.

The Programme also focuses efforts on the potential of space-based information for disaster management and emergency response. The UN-SPIDER programme (established 2006) helps to achieve this objective by being a gateway to space information for disaster management support, serving as a bridge to connect the disaster management and space communities and being a facilitator of capacity-building and institutional strengthening, in particular for developing countries.

The International Committee on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (ICG) promotes voluntary cooperation on matters of mutual interest related to civil satellite-based positioning, navigation, timing, and value-added services. To support the work of ICG, the Office was designated as the Executive Secretariat of ICG. In that capacity, UNOOSA is organizing regional workshops, training courses, and international meetings focusing on capacity-building in the use of GNSS-related technologies in various rapidly growing fields of science and industry.

== Staff ==
Citizens of more than 50 countries have served as staff members, consultants, and interns.

Staff members of the Office have a wide range of educational backgrounds, including space science (including interdisciplinary fields), physics, engineering, computer science, political science, international affairs, and law (including public international law and space law).

At different times, a number of other distinguished people, including Adigun Ade Abiodun, Vladimír Kopal, Mazlan Binti Othman, Luboš Perek, Nandasiri Jasentuliyana, and Takao Doi served at various positions.

<text>Robert Edward &quot;Bo&quot; Rein (July 20, 1945 – January 10, 1980) was an American football and baseball player and football coach. He was a two-sport athlete at Ohio State University and served as the head football coach at North Carolina State University from 1976 to 1979, compiling a record of 27–18–1. Following the 1979 season, Rein had assumed the role as head coach at Louisiana State University, but was killed in an aircraft accident in January 1980 before he ever coached a game for the Tigers. Rein is the namesake of football player awards at Ohio State and NC State.

==Early life==
Rein was born and raised in Niles, Ohio, where he is still remembered as a legendary high school athlete for the Red Dragons of Niles McKinley High School. Rein played at Niles during their heyday, when the Red Dragons under coach Tony Mason were one of the top big school powerhouses in high school football in Ohio.

==Baseball career==
Rein played baseball at Ohio State University from 1965 through 1967, helping the Buckeyes win the 1966 College World Series, the school&#x27;s only NCAA baseball title. Rein played shortstop and left field. He led his team in stolen bases in 1965 and 1966, and in doubles and runs in 1966. Rein had 49 career stolen bases, which stood as a team record until he was surpassed by Roy Marsh in the early 1990s.

In 1965 and 1966, Ohio State participated in the College World Series, and Rein was selected in both years to the All Tournament team. In 1965, the Buckeyes lost the championship game to Arizona State. In 1966, Ohio State won the championship, defeating Oklahoma State. In the championship game, Rein contributed a double.

After he finished his college career, Rein was drafted by the Cleveland Indians. He was playing for the Portland Beavers, the Indians&#x27; Triple-A farm team, when Achilles tendon and hamstring problems ended his baseball career.

==Football playing career==
From 1964 to 1966, Rein was a three-year starter at left halfback for the Ohio State Buckeyes football team. He led his team in receptions in 1964 and 1965, and in rushing in 1966. Rein finished at Ohio State the team career receptions leader. Following his Ohio State career, Rein was drafted by the Baltimore Colts.

Former teammate, and later Mayor of Columbus, Ohio, Greg Lashutka said of Rein, &quot;He wasn&#x27;t the biggest guy, but pound for pound he was tough as they come. He had that inner drive and did everything to the fullest. He could play.&quot; A continuing tradition at Ohio State is that at the end of every season, the team votes to award one teammate the &quot;Bo Rein Most Inspirational Player Award.&quot;

==Football coaching career==
Lou Holtz, a former assistant coach at Ohio State, had taken the head coaching position at William &amp; Mary in 1969, and Holtz offered an assistant coaching job to Rein. When Holtz accepted an offer from North Carolina State University in 1972, Rein went with him. In 1975, Rein was hired as offensive coordinator for the University of Arkansas under Frank Broyles and helped the Razorbacks win the Southwest Conference and the 1976 Cotton Bowl Classic.

When Holtz moved on to New York Jets of the NFL in 1976, Rein became the youngest college football head coach upon his hiring by North Carolina State. Guiding the NC State Wolfpack football team, Rein was an advocate of the coaching philosophy of Ohio State&#x27;s Woody Hayes for whom Rein played. During Rein&#x27;s four years at NC State, he led the team to two bowl games, defeating Iowa State in the 1977 Peach Bowl and defeating Pittsburgh in the 1978 Tangerine Bowl. In Rein&#x27;s final year at NC State, his team won the 1979 Atlantic Coast Conference championship. However, it did not play in a bowl game, having declined an invitation to the Garden State Bowl–to date, the last power conference champion to decline participation in a bowl game.

Among Rein&#x27;s top players at NC State were Outland Trophy winner Jim Ritcher, a center for the Wolfpack who later started at guard on four Super Bowl teams with the Buffalo Bills, and linebacker Bill Cowher, who later coached the Pittsburgh Steelers for 15 seasons and won Super Bowl XL.

Following every season, the NC State football team awards the &quot;Bo Rein Award&quot; to a player that makes a vital contribution in an unsung role.

==Death==
Following the 1979 season, Rein was hired away from NC State by Louisiana State University. In January 1980, Rein took a recruiting trip to Shreveport, Louisiana. On his January 10, 1980, return trip back to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, his private aircraft crashed, leaving no survivors. Rein, who was hired at the end of November 1979, had been head coach for less than two months.

Rein and experienced pilot Louis Benscotter left Shreveport in a Cessna 441 aircraft. The flight was planned to be a 40-minute trip, but when Benscotter rerouted east to avoid a storm, air traffic control lost contact with him. The aircraft climbed to and kept heading due east. After being tracked on radar, the aircraft was eventually intercepted by U.S. Air National Guard Convair F-106 Delta Dart fighter aircraft over North Carolina, off-course and at an altitude of , feet higher than its maximum certified ceiling. The military pilots could not see anyone in the cockpit and the aircraft continued on over the Atlantic Ocean, where it crashed after running out of fuel. A US Coast Guard crew spotted some debris, but no wreckage was ever recovered. The bodies of Rein and Benscotter have never been found.

The cause of the crash is undetermined but was most likely cabin depressurization causing hypoxia, a lack of oxygen, resulting in the occupants losing consciousness as in the 1999 South Dakota Learjet crash.

In 1982, Rein&#x27;s widow, Suzanne Kay, reached an out-of-court settlement for an undisclosed amount after filing a $10 million damage suit against a number of defendants, including the Cessna Aircraft Company, Cruse Aviation Inc., who serviced the aircraft, and Nichols Construction Corporation, who owned it.

<text>Kyle John Baker (born 1965) is an American cartoonist, comic book writer-artist, and animator known for his graphic novels and for a 2000s revival of the series &quot;Plastic Man&quot;.

Baker has won numerous Eisner Awards and Harvey Awards for his work in the comics field.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Kyle Baker was born in the Queens, New York City, the son of art director John M. Baker and high-school audiovisual-department manager Eleanor L. Baker. He has a brother and a sister. Their parents had both attended Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, and their father, who, Baker said, &quot;worked in advertising [and] made junk mail&quot;, would &quot;draw pictures for us and entertain us.&quot; Aside from this exposure to art, Baker has said, his early artistic influences included comic book artist Jack Kirby, caricaturist Jack Davis, and painter and magazine illustrator Norman Rockwell. He noted:

Other influences included the Charlton Comics artwork of Jim Aparo and Steve Ditko.

===Breaking into comics===
In his senior year of high school, Baker became an intern at Marvel Comics, making photocopies and filing fan mail. &quot;I sort of fell into Marvel because I happened to know somebody there,&quot; he said. &quot;But I always thought I was going to do funny stuff&quot; rather than superhero comics. He became background assistant to Marvel inker Josef Rubinstein, and later also assisted Vince Colletta and Andy Mushynski. He cited Marvel artists Walt Simonson, Al Milgrom and Larry Hama and writer and editor-in-chief Jim Shooter as providing him art and storytelling advice. Part of his duties involved photocopying, and he would take copies of John Buscema penciling home on which to practice inking. While working for Marvel, Baker attended the School of Visual Arts, in Manhattan, studying graphic design and printmaking, but dropped out after two years. Through that connection, however, he began freelancing with famed graphic designer Milton Glaser, an SVA instructor, assisting him on a set of children&#x27;s books.

Baker&#x27;s first credited work at Marvel is penciling the half-page entry &quot;Kid Commandos&quot; in &quot;The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot; #13 (February1984). After a handful of inking assignments on issues of &quot;Transformers&quot;, &quot;The Avengers Annual&quot; #14 (1985) and elsewhere, Baker made his professional story-illustration debut as penciler and inker of the publisher Lodestone Comics&#x27; &quot;Codename: Danger&quot; #2 (October 1985), with a 23-page story written by Brian Marshall, Mike Harris, and Robert Loren Fleming. Cover penciling and more interior inking for Marvel and occasionally DC followed. His first story penciling for one of the two major comics companies was the three-issue &quot;Howard the Duck: The Movie&quot; (December 1986 - February 1987), adapting the 1986 film &quot;Howard the Duck&quot;, and which he self-inked.

During this time, Baker also attempted to sell humor spot illustrations, but was rejected by the major newspaper syndicates. Jim Salicrup, a Marvel editor, did commission him &quot;to write a few one-panel gags about [the superhero team] the X-Men&quot;, titled &quot;It&#x27;s Genetic&quot; and appearing in the Marvel-produced fan magazine &quot;Marvel Age&quot;.

===First graphic novel===
At the recommendation of freelance artist Ron Fontes, an editor at the Dolphin imprint of the publishing house Doubleday expressed interest in Baker&#x27;s sample strips of the character Cowboy Wally, &quot;and asked if I had any more. I lied and said I did.&quot; This led to the 128-page graphic novel &quot;Cowboy Wally&quot;. &quot;The character of Noel was pretty much based on me,&quot; Baker said in 1999. &quot;I lie all the time. The first part of the books is the collected strips, and the other three chapters were written for the book. &quot;It didn&#x27;t sell many copies,&quot; Baker said, &quot;but at least it convinced DC [Comics] I should be allowed to draw, not just ink.&quot;

Baker went on to draw DC&#x27;s 1980s comics revival of the pulp fiction hero &quot;The Shadow&quot;, beginning with &quot;The Shadow Annual&quot; #2 (1988), followed by the monthly series from issue #7 to the final issue, #19 (February 1988 - January 1989). He did assorted other DC work including &quot;Justice, Inc.&quot; In 1990, Baker and writer Len Wein produced three issues of &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; for The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s Hollywood Comics, the first two issues containing original stories, the third an adaption the 1990 &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; film.

He began scripting comics around this time: Baker penciled and inked First Comics&#x27; &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; #3 &amp; 21 (February 1990 &amp; March 1991), adapting, respectively, &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; and &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;. While Peter David scripted the latter, Baker himself wrote the adaptation of the Lewis Carroll work. &quot;I&#x27;d never planned to become a writer,&quot; Baker said in 1999. &quot;I wrote short gags, like the kind you see in the newspapers and Cowboy Wally, but not stories. I only learned to write stories because people kept paying me to write them. In the years 1991-1994, 90 percent of my income was from writing, and I received very few offers to draw. I figured I should learn to write.&quot;

===&quot;Why I Hate Saturn&quot;, commercial illustration===

Baker achieved recognition and won an Eisner Award for his 1990 graphic novel &quot;Why I Hate Saturn&quot;, published by the DC Comics imprint Piranha Press. Baker said in 1999 of his breakthrough work:

Baker&#x27;s cartoons and caricatures began appearing in &quot;BusinessWeek, Details, Entertainment Weekly, ESPN, Esquire, Guitar World, Mad, National Lampoon, New York, The New York Times, Rolling Stone, Spin, Us, Vibe&quot;, and &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. He spent three years illustrating the weekly strip &quot;Bad Publicity&quot; for &quot;New York&quot; magazine.

===Animation===
Baker&#x27;s animation has appeared on BET and MTV, and in animated &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; projects, including the animated feature &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;. Baker was &quot;guest art director&quot; for Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Class of 3000&quot;, and storyboarded the &quot;Class of 3000&quot; Christmas special.

in 1994, Baker directed an animated video featuring the hip hop singer KRS-One, called &quot;Break The Chain&quot;. Marvel Comics had published &quot;Break the Chain&quot; as a comic book packaged with a read-along hip-hop audiocassette. That same year and next, he contributed to the four-issue Dark Horse Comics humor anthology &quot;Instant Piano&quot; (December 1994 - June 1995), including drawing the cover of the premiere. For another anthology, DC&#x27;s &quot;Elseworlds 80-Page Giant&quot; #1 (August 1999), Baker drew, colored, lettered and with his wife, teacher Elizabeth Glass, whom he married July 18, 1998, wrote the 10-page parallel universe story &quot;Letitia Lerner, Superman&#x27;s Babysitter&quot;. It would win a &quot;Best Short Story&quot; Eisner Award despite DC destroying all copies intended for the North American market after deeming some of the content unsuitable, though copies were still distributed in Europe.

Baker said in 1999 he was writing a Christmas movie for Paramount Pictures, titled &quot;U Betta Watch Out&quot;, and was animating a TV-movie title &quot;Corey Q. Jeeters, I&#x27;m Telling on You&quot;.

At this point in his career, Baker stated in an interview, &quot;Nobody tells me what to write or how to draw. Only an idiot would dare tell Kyle Baker how to make a good cartoon. Hollywood and the magazine world are full of idiots. They water my stuff down and make it unfunny.&quot;

He is credited with writing and storyboarding on the &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; television episodes &quot;Candace Loses Her Head&quot; and &quot;Are You My Mummy?&quot;.

===2000s===
Baker drew writer Robert Morales&#x27; Marvel Comics miniseries &quot;&quot; #1-7 (January–July 2003), a Captain America storyline with parallels to the Tuskegee experiment. He also wrote and drew all but two issues (#7 and #12) of the 20-issue comedic adventure series &quot;Plastic Man&quot; vol. 4 (February 2004 - March 2006), starring the Golden Age of Comic Books superhero created by Jack Cole for Quality Comics. Baker contributed to the Dark Horse Comics series &quot;The Amazing Adventures of the Escapist&quot;, a spin-off of Michael Chabon&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay&quot;.

In 2006, his company, Kyle Baker Publishing, serialized a four-part comic book series about Nat Turner, and published the series &quot;The Bakers&quot;, based on his family life, in two anthologies, &quot;Cartoonist&quot; and &quot;Cartoonist Vol. 2: Now with More Bakers&quot;. He has also continued to provide comics material sporadically to Marvel, DC and Image Comics through at least 2010. In 2007 and 2008, Image Comics published Baker&#x27;s six-issue Image Comics miniseries &quot;Special Forces&quot;, a teen-soldier military satire that criticizes the exhortation of felons and disabled Americans into military service. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewed the 2009 trade-paperback collection of the first four issues, calling it &quot;the harshest, most serrated satire of the Iraq War yet published.&quot;

In 2008, Watson-Guptill published &quot;How to Draw Stupid and Other Essentials of Cartooning&quot;, Baker&#x27;s art instruction book. That same year, Baker hosted the comics industry&#x27;s Harvey Awards. In 2010, he became regular artist on Marvel Comics&#x27; mature-audience MAX-imprint series, &quot;Deadpool Max&quot;.

<doc id="1305412" wikidata="Q364552" url="?curid=1305412" title="Cristóvão Falcão">
<text>Cristóvão Falcão (c. 1512 – c. 1557), sometimes &quot;Cristóvão Falcão de Sousa&quot; or &quot;Cristóvão de Sousa Falcão&quot;, was a Portuguese poet, that came of a noble family settled at Portalegre in the Alentejo, which had originated with John Falconet, one of the Englishmen who went to Portugal in 1386 in the suite of Philippa of Lancaster. His father, João Vaz de Almada Falcão, was an upright public servant who had held the captaincy of Elmina on the West African coast, but died, as he had lived, a poor man.

There is a tradition that in boyhood Cristóvão fell in love with a beautiful child and rich heiress, D. Maria Brandão, and in 1526 married her clandestinely, but parental opposition prevented the ratification of the marriage. Family pride, it is said, drove the father of Cristóvão to keep his son under strict surveillance in his own house for five years, while the lady&#x27;s parents, objecting to the youth&#x27;s small means, put her into the Cistercian convent of Lorvão, and there endeavoured to wean her heart from him by the accusation that he coveted her fortune more than her person. Their arguments and the promise of a good match ultimately prevailed, and in 1534 D. Maria left the convent to marry D. Luís de Silva, captain of Tangier, while the broken-hearted Cristóvão told his sad story in some beautiful lyrics and particularly in the eclogue &quot;Chrisfal&quot;.

He had been the disciple and friend of the poets Bernardim Ribeiro and Francisco de Sá de Miranda, and when his great disappointment came, Falcão laid aside poetry and entered on a diplomatic career. There is documentary evidence that he was employed at the Portuguese embassy in Rome in 1542, but he soon returned to Portugal, and we find him at court again in 1548 and 1551. The date of his death, as of his birth, is uncertain.

Such is the story accepted by Teófilo Braga, but Delfim Guimarães shows that the first part is doubtful, and, putting aside the testimony of a contemporary and grave writer, Diogo do Couto, he even denies the title of poet to Cristóvão Falcão, arguing from internal and other evidence that &quot;Chrisfal&quot; is the work of Bernardim Ribeiro; his destructive criticism is, however, stronger than his constructive work. The eclogue, with its 1005 verses, is the very poem of saudade, and its simple, direct language and chaste and tender feeling, enshrined in exquisitely sounding verses, has won for its author lasting fame and a unique position in Portuguese literature. Its influence on later poets has been very considerable, and Camões used several of the verses as proverbs.

The poetical works of Cristóvão Falcão were published anonymously, owing, it is supposed, to their personal nature and allusions, and, in part or in whole, they have been often reprinted. There is a critical edition of &quot;Chrisfal&quot; and &quot;A Carta&quot; (the letter) by Epiphandro da Silva Dias under the title &quot;Obras de Christovão Falcão&quot;, (Porto, 1893), and one of the &quot;Cantigas Esparsas&quot; by the same scholar appeared in the &quot;Revista Lusitana&quot; (vol. 4, pp. 142-f 79, Lisbon, 1896), under the name &quot;Fragmento de um Cancioneiro do Século XV&quot;. The &quot;Trovas de Chrisfal&quot;, in what appears to be the earliest known version, consists of 1015 verses. This text, though known earlier, was finally edited in 1995 (by Rip Cohen), all previous editions having been based on the edition of Ferrara.

<text>Yvon Chouinard (born November 9, 1938) is an American rock climber, environmentalist, and businessman. His company, Patagonia, sells outdoor products, outerwear, and food. He was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2023.

== Early life ==
Chouinard&#x27;s father was a French Canadian handyman, mechanic, and plumber. In 1947, Yvon and his family moved from Lewiston, Maine to Southern California. They were Catholic.

His early climbing partners included Royal Robbins and Tom Frost. A Sierra Club member, in his youth he founded the Southern California Falconry Club, and it was his investigations of falcon aeries that led him to rock climbing. To save money and to make adaptations for the way he was climbing, he decided to make his own climbing tools by teaching himself blacksmithing, and eventually started a business.

== Yosemite rock climber to leading alpinist ==
Chouinard was one of the leading climbers of the &quot;Golden Age of Yosemite Climbing.&quot; He was one of the protagonists of the film made about this era: &quot;Valley Uprising&quot; (2014). He participated in the first ascent of the North America Wall in 1964 (with Royal Robbins, Tom Frost, and Chuck Pratt), using no fixed ropes. The next year, his and TM Herbert&#x27;s ascent of the Muir Wall on El Capitan improved the style of previous first ascents. Chouinard became the most articulate advocate of the importance of style, the basis of modern rock climbing.

In 1961, he visited Western Canada with Fred Beckey, and made several important first ascents, including the North Face of Mount Edith Cavell (Rockies), the Beckey-Chouinard Route on South Howser Tower in the Bugaboos (Purcell Mountains), and the North Face of Mount Sir Donald (Selkirk Mountains). These climbs opened his eyes to the idea of applying Yosemite big-wall climbing techniques to mountain climbing, and his advocacy was important to modern, high-grade alpinism. Also in 1961, he visited Shawangunk Ridge for the first time, freeclimbing the first pitch of Matinee (the hardest free climb done at Shawangunk Ridge at the time); and introducing chrome-molybdenum steel pitons to the area, which revolutionized climbing protection. In 1968, he climbed Cerro Fitzroy in Patagonia by a new route (The Californian Route, 3rd overall ascent of the mountain) with Dick Dorworth, Chris Jones, Lito Tejada-Flores, and Douglas Tompkins.

Chouinard has also traveled and climbed in the European Alps and in Pakistan.

== Chouinard Equipment, Ltd. ==
In 1957, he bought a second-hand coal-fired forge, and started making hardened steel pitons for use in Yosemite Valley. Between time spent surfing and climbing, he sold pitons out of the back of his car to support himself. The improved pitons were a big factor in the birth of big-wall climbing from 1957 to 1960 in Yosemite. The success of his pitons caused him to found Chouinard Equipment, Ltd.

In the late 1960s, Chouinard and business partner Tom Frost began studying ice climbing equipment, and re-invented the basic tools (crampons and ice axes) to perform on steeper ice. These new tools and his book &quot;Climbing Ice&quot; (1978) started the modern sport of ice climbing.

Around 1970, he became aware that the use of steel pitons made by his company was causing significant damage to the cracks of Yosemite. These pitons composed 70 percent of his income. In 1971 and 1972, Chouinard and Frost introduced new aluminum chockstones, called Hexentrics and Stoppers, along with the less successful steel Crack-n-Ups, and committed the company to the advocacy of the new tools and a new style of climbing called &quot;clean climbing.&quot; This concept revolutionized rock climbing and led to further success of the company, despite cannibalizing the sales of pitons, formerly his most important product.

They applied for a U.S. patent on Hexentrics in 1974, and it was granted on April 6, 1976. These are still manufactured by Black Diamond Equipment.

In the latter 1960s, Chouinard attempted a number of significant technological and technique changes to ice climbing after trips to the Alps in Europe and Sierra Nevada ice gullies in autumn. He removed the flex from crampons, making them more rigid for front-pointing. He drew the taper of a rock hammer into a point for better ice purchase. He increased the cross section of ice screws while also using lighter materials. He experimented with pick and blade issues with ice axes. Prior to this, much of ice climbing was seen as mere step cutting. He attempted to replace hand ice picks (climbing type) with a small ice axe head called a Climaxe.

In 1989, Chouinard Equipment, Ltd. filed for bankruptcy protection in order to protect it from liability lawsuits. The hard assets of Chouinard Equipment, Ltd. were acquired by its employees through the Chapter 11 process, and the company was reestablished as Black Diamond Equipment, Ltd.

== Patagonia and environmentalism ==
Chouinard is most known for founding the clothing and gear company Patagonia. Chouinard started to sell clothes by chance as a way to support his moderately profitable equipment business. In 1970 on a trip to Scotland, he purchased some rugby shirts and sold them with great success. From this small start, the Patagonia company developed a wide selection of rugged technical clothing. According to Chouinard, the intent of Patagonia is to make clothes for people under the rugged, southern Andes/Cape Horn conditions of places like Patagonia.

Recognizing that the financial success of the company provided the opportunity to also achieve personal goals, Chouinard committed the company to being an outstanding place to work, and to be an important resource for environmental activism. In 1984, Patagonia opened an on-site cafeteria offering &quot;healthy, mostly vegetarian food,&quot; and started providing on-site child care. In 1986, Chouinard committed the company to &quot;tithing&quot; for environmental activism, committing one percent of sales or ten percent of profits, whichever is the greater. The commitment included paying employees working on local environmental projects so they could commit their efforts full-time.

In the early 1990s, an environmental audit of Patagonia revealed the surprising result (at the time), that corporate cotton, although it was a natural material, had a heavy environmental footprint. In 1996, Chouinard committed the company to using all organic cotton.

In 2002, Yvon Chouinard founded 1% for the Planet and Patagonia became the first business to commit 1% of annual sales to the environment.

In 2014, Patagonia supported the advocacy documentary film &quot;DamNation&quot;, which is about changing attitudes in America towards its dams. Chouinard was the executive producer of the film, and he was also featured in the film commenting about dams.

In 2018, in acknowledgment that sustainability and responsible practices are core to Patagonia, Yvon Chouinard was recognized with the Sierra Club&#x27;s top award, the John Muir Award.

In 2022, Chouinard announced that he was donating ownership in Patagonia to a trust to ensure profits are used for addressing climate change. Chouinard&#x27;s family retains control of the company&#x27;s voting stock through the Patagonia Purpose Trust.

== Personal life ==
In 1971, Chouinard met and married his wife, Malinda Pennoyer, who was an art and home economics student at California State University, Fresno. They have a son (Fletcher) and a daughter (Claire), both of whom work for Patagonia.

In 2021, Yvon Chouinard received an honorary degree from Bates College.

<text>The Warehouse District/Hennepin Avenue station is a light rail station on the Blue Line and Green Line in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This was the original northern terminus of the Blue Line until the new Target Field station opened on November 14, 2009 to provide access to the new Northstar Commuter Rail line.

The Warehouse District station is located on 5th Street North, between 1st Avenue North and Hennepin Avenue in downtown Minneapolis. This is a center-platform station with one traffic lane to the south of the platform. Service began at this station when the Blue Line opened on June 26, 2004, and this station is where the opening ceremony was held. The first train departed at 11:00 a.m. on that day.

The station was designed by ESG Architecture &amp; Design, who also designed the adjacent Nicollet Mall station. To reflect its neighborhood, the station incorporates brickwork and metal columns into the design. The public art installation, &quot;Untilted&quot;, by Penny Rakoff and Bill McCullam depict labor disputes that occurred in the city in the first half of the 20th century, most notably the Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934. Images are printed onto ten 15.5 × 12.25 inch and two-hundred 2.75 × 2.75 inch tiles.

This station is planned to a stop on the METRO E Line.

The Target Center, home of the Minnesota Timberwolves, is a block from the station. Although Target Field station is the official stop for the Minnesota Twins&#x27; Target Field, Warehouse/Hennepin also sees significant traffic during Twins games.

<doc id="1305430" wikidata="Q16972959" url="?curid=1305430" title="Hook 'em Horns">
<text>Hook &#x27;em Horns is the chant and hand signal of The University of Texas at Austin. Students, alumni, and fans of the university employ a greeting consisting of the phrase &quot;Hook &#x27;em&quot; or &quot;Hook &#x27;em Horns&quot; to show school pride.

The gesture is meant to approximate the shape of the head and horns of the UT mascot, the Texas Longhorn Bevo. The sign is made by extending the index and pinky fingers while grasping the second and third fingers with the thumb. The arm in use is usually extended, but the sign can also be given with the arm bent at the elbow. The sign is often seen at sporting events, during the playing of the school song &quot;The Eyes of Texas&quot;, and during the playing of the school fight song &quot;Texas Fight&quot;. It is one of the most recognized hand signals of all American universities. A variant of the Horns, formed upside down with the thumb pointed outward, is often used by rivals of the Longhorns and is considered insulting, especially when performed by a player or coach of the team in question. It is widely held that entrepreneur Joe Re of Fayetteville West Virginia was the first to introduce the “horns down” gesture when Texas took on West Virginia University in 2012. West Virginia won the game by a score of 48-45 with quarterback Geno Smith throwing 4 touchdown passes in the victory.

==History==
The first known usage of the &quot;Hook &#x27;em&quot; phrase comes from a South Saint Paul Booster Club organized for the Saint Paul Winter Carnival in 1916 and achieved national scope from use at the University of Minnesota through the 1930s. Minnesota didn&#x27;t trademark the phrase or the hand signal. Neither did the University of Iowa. There was also a Texas basketball team during the 1930s known as the &quot;Hook &#x27;Em Cows&quot; which may have contributed to the use of the phrase and gesture at the University of Texas.

In 1955, Harley Clark, who would later introduce the signal, got the idea for the hand-sign from his colleagues Tom Butts and Henry K. Pitts, who had been casting shadows on the wall at the Texas Union. Clark was a member of the Tejas Club, as well as head cheerleader at UT, a position that was elected by the student body. &quot;It was second only in importance to the Texas governor,&quot; he jokes. Clark showed an enthusiastic student body the sign a few nights later at a football pep rally at Gregory Gym. According to Neal Spelce, who attended the rally when he was a student at the university, &quot;a lot of people didn&#x27;t get it right at first,&quot; but it caught on rapidly from there. By the thousands, students extended an arm to create the now famous salute. The next day, at the Texas Longhorn vs. TCU football game, Clark stood in awe as the &quot;Hook &#x27;em Horns&quot; hand sign surged from one side of the stadium to the other.

Within a few years, the symbol was widely known to football fans across the state and country. Sports Illustrated featured the Hook &#x27;em Horns symbol in front of a Texas pennant on the cover of their 10 September 1973 issue. That issue of the magazine highlighted the Texas football program as the best in the nation at that time.

Beginning in 2004, The University of Texas has featured the slogan in a television advertisement titled &quot;Rallying Cry&quot;. The advertisement is one of nine ads that make up the &quot;What Starts Here Changes the World&quot; campaign, all of which are narrated by university alumnus Walter Cronkite. The narration for &quot;Rallying Cry&quot; is:

:Is there a rallying cry for the thinkers and doers of tomorrow? A motto that sums up their passion for creativity and their pursuit of discovery? Sure there is: &quot;Hook &#x27;em, Horns&quot;. We&#x27;re Texas. What starts here...changes the world.

The hand gesture is not featured in the advertisement, which shows an aerial view flying along Interstate 35, then over downtown Austin, Texas, past the Texas State Capitol and finally arriving at the Tower of the Main Building as Cronkite says the slogan. The advertisements are typically run during NCAA sporting events.

==Identical gestures==

In other parts of the world, specifically Italy, the identical corna gesture is often used to imply cuckoldry. The gesture is also sometimes associated with the occult and satanism. The images of Jenna Bush publicly &quot;throwing the horns&quot; made headlines on tabloid news in Norway and caused the First Lady&#x27;s press secretary, Gordon Johndroe, to giggle when he discovered the gesture, signed on one hand (&quot;the head&quot;) in conjunction with flapping of the fingers on other hand (the &quot;business end&quot;), means bullshit in sign language.

In 1985, five Americans were arrested, due to its satanic connotations after dancing and displaying the gesture in front of the Vatican. According to an article authored by Jack Douglas, Jr., in Russia, it&#x27;s a derogatory symbol for the newly rich, arrogant and poorly educated.

The sign is also heavily used as a symbol for Heavy Metal music and sub-culture since the early 1970s. It was popularized by the singer Ronnie James Dio during concerts.

<text>Bayview is a station on Line 4 Sheppard of the Toronto subway. It is located at 550 Sheppard Avenue East, at Bayview Avenue. It opened in 2002.

== History ==
Bayview opened on November 24, 2002, along with the other stations on Line 4 Sheppard.

In 2013, the TTC announced plans for a second Bayview station on Line 5 Eglinton. This station was renamed Leaside in January 2016.

== Station description ==
Like all the other stations on the Sheppard line, Bayview is fully accessible. The main entrance on the northeast corner of Sheppard Avenue and Bayview Avenue is fully accessible, with elevator, escalator, and stair access to the west concourse level, where another elevator connects to the subway platform level. A second automatic entrance at the southeast corner of the intersection is also fully accessible, providing elevator, escalator, and stair access to the east concourse level. There is also a third entrance at the northwest corner of the intersection that is not accessible.

== Architecture and art ==

Stevens Group Architects designed the station with Walter Construction being the general contractor. The high-ceilinged entrance pavilion is a distinctive feature of the station, with extensive glazing and long angled roofs overhanging the structure, evoking mid-century architecture.

The public art installed at the station by Gem Campbell Terrazzo &amp; Tile is titled &quot;From Here Right Now&quot;, consisting of a variety of &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; illustrations on the walls and floors created by Toronto artist Panya Clark Espinal. This led travel magazine BootsnAll to declare Bayview one of the 15 most beautiful subway stops in the world in 2011.

== Subway infrastructure in the vicinity ==
The station itself was built by cut-and-cover but east of the station the tracks continue through dual bored tunnels toward Bessarion station, while west of the station similar tunnels go to Sheppard–Yonge station, where the tracks cross over the Line 1 Yonge–University tracks.

== Nearby landmarks ==
Nearby landmarks include the Bayview Village Shopping Centre and the Kenaston Gardens YMCA, which has an entrance directly adjacent to the station. There is no indoor access to the subway from either Bayview Village or the YMCA.

== Surface connections ==

A transfer is needed to connect to all bus routes at the curbside stops located directly outside the station.

TTC routes serving the station include:

<doc id="1305434" wikidata="Q551601" url="?curid=1305434" title="Al-Afdal Shahanshah">
<text>Al-Afdal Shahanshah (; ; 1066 – 11 December 1121), born Abu al-Qasim Shahanshah bin Badr al-Jamali, was a vizier of the Fatimid caliphs of Egypt. According to a later biographical encyclopedia, he was surnamed al-Malik al-Afdal (&quot;the excellent king&quot;), but this is not supported by contemporary sources.

== Ascent to power ==
He was born in Acre, the son of Badr al-Jamali, an Armenian mamluk who became Muslim. Badr was vizier for the Fatimids in Cairo from 1074 until his death in 1094, when al-Afdal succeeded him. Caliph Al-Mustansir Billah died soon afterwards, and al-Afdal appointed as caliph al-Musta&#x27;li, a child, instead of al-Mustali&#x27;s much older brother Nizar ibn al-Mustansir. Nizar revolted and was defeated in 1095; which led to tension between Al-Afdal and Nizar’s supporters, mainly Hassan-i Sabbah, and his Nizari Isma&#x27;ili group known also as the order of Assassins.

At this time Fatimid power in Palestine had been reduced by the arrival of the Seljuk Turks. In 1097 he captured Tyre from the Seljuks, and in 1098 he took Jerusalem, expelling its Artuqid governor Ilghazi and installing in his place the Fatimid official Iftikhar al-Dawla. Al-Afdal restored most of Palestine to Fatimid control, at least temporarily.

Under al-Afdal, the caliphs were confined in their palace, away from public view, and even bereft of their ceremonial functions, which al-Afdal arrogated to himself. The vizier even moved the setting for most public ceremonies and the celebration of festivals away from the caliphal palace to his own palace, the , which he built in 1106–1108 outside the city walls of Cairo. Built on the shore of the Nile outside the city walls of Cairo, the large vizieral palace of has since disappeared without a trace.

== Conflict with the Crusaders ==
Al-Afdal misunderstood the Crusaders as Byzantine mercenaries; this misperception caused al-Afdal to conclude that the Crusaders would make for natural allies, as each were enemies of the Seljuk Turks. Fatimid overtures for an alliance with the crusaders were rebuffed, and the crusaders continued southward from Antioch to capture Jerusalem from Fatimid control in 1099.

When it became apparent that the Crusaders would not rest until they had control of the city, al-Afdal marched out from Cairo, but was too late to rescue Jerusalem, which fell on 15 July 1099. On 12 August 1099, the Crusaders under Godfrey of Bouillon surprised al-Afdal at the Battle of Ascalon and completely defeated him. Al-Afdal would later reassert Fatimid control of Ascalon, as the Crusaders did not attempt to retain it, and utilize it as a staging ground for later attacks on the Crusader states.

When al-Musta&#x27;li died in December 1101, al-Afdal raised the five-year-old al-Amir bi-Ahkam Allah to the throne as imam and caliph. To further strengthen the familial ties with the young caliph, he married him to his own daughter. As the vizier, father-in-law, and uncle of the young ruler, al-Afdal placed the caliph before him on his own horse during al-Amir&#x27;s inaugural procession. A decree, dictated by al-Afdal, renewed his appointment as vizier with plenipotentiary powers and ensured his ascendancy over the child-caliph. 

Al-Afdal marched out every year to attack the nascent Kingdom of Jerusalem, and in 1105 attempted to ally with Damascus against them, but was defeated at the Third Battle of Ramla. Al-Afdal and his army enjoyed success only so long as no European fleet interfered, but they gradually lost control of their coastal strongholds; in 1109 Tripoli was lost, despite the fleet and supplies sent by al-Afdal, and the city became the centre of the Crusader state of the County of Tripoli. In 1110 the governor of Ascalon, Shams al-Khilafa, rebelled against al-Afdal with the intent of handing over the city to Jerusalem (for a large price). Al-Khilafa was assassinated by his Berber troops, sending his head to al-Afdal.

Al-Afdal also introduced tax (&quot;iqta&quot;&#x27;) reform in Egypt, which remained in place until Saladin took over Egypt. Al-Afdal was nicknamed &quot;Jalal al-Islam&quot; (&quot;Glory of Islam&quot;) and &quot;Nasir al-Din&quot; (&quot;Protector of the Faith&quot;). Ibn al-Qalanisi describes him as &quot;a firm believer in the doctrines of Sunnah, upright in conduct, a lover of justice towards both troops and civil population, judicious in counsel and plan, ambitious and resolute, of penetrating knowledge and exquisite tact, of generous nature, accurate in his intuitions, and possessing a sense of justice which preserved him from wrongdoing and led him to shun all tyrannical methods.&quot;

== Final years and assassination ==

In 1115, an assassin tried to kill al-Afdal, but he was saved by his bodyguards. While he was not harmed, his health deteriorated from that time, leading to assigning his brother Ja&#x27;far the task of adding the official, calligraphic signature to documents, while in 1115, he designated his son, Sama&#x27; al-Mulk Husayn, as his deputy (and thus heir-apparent). Following another failed attack by three assassins in 1118, al-Afdal suspected his own sons, and had them deprived of their positions and incomes.

On 13 December 1121, during a procession on the last day of Ramadan, al-Afdal was assassinated. The deed was commonly attributed to (and claimed by) the Nizari Order of Assassins. However, the contemporary Syrian chronicler Ibn al-Qalanisi states that the murder was the work of the Caliph al-Amir, and of al-Afdal&#x27;s chief of staff, al-Ma&#x27;mun al-Bata&#x27;ihi, who would succeed him as vizier. Modern scholars commonly accept the Assassins&#x27; responsibility for the deed, apparently as revenge for Nizar&#x27;s death, but whatever his true role in his master&#x27;s death, al-Bata&#x27;ihi moved quickly to take control of the situation. He took his master&#x27;s body to the vizieral palace and delayed the announcement of his death until al-Amir could be notified. On the morning of the next day, Eid al-Fitr, al-Amir appointed al-Bata&#x27;ihi as vizier and publicly reasserted his position as head of the state by presiding at the day&#x27;s ceremony. Al-Afdal&#x27;s adult sons were imprisoned, but the other members of al-Afdal&#x27;s family, to whom after all the caliph himself was related, were allowed to partake in the ceremony, and al-Afdal received a funeral and burial appropriate to his station. At the same time, al-Amir moved quickly to confiscate al-Afdal&#x27;s enormous wealth, houses, and estates, and brought the moveable items to his own palace. So great was the treasure amassed by al-Afdal that chroniclers describe it as larger than that of any previous king, and it took forty days to move it to the caliph&#x27;s palace.

== Buildings ==
Little survives today of the buildings commissioned by al-Afdal during his long regency. The only known mosque commissioned by al-Afdal was the Mosque of the Elephant, built south of Fustat (Old Cairo), on a hill above the Lake of the Abyssinians (Birkat al-Habash). It was the site of the first, failed attempt to build a new observatory in 1119, before it was realised that the site was unsuitable. Some reports indicate that al-Afdal also rebuilt the mosque at Gizeh, which had been destroyed by the Nile floods, but this cannot be corroborated. Al-Afdal did also erect new minarets, including at the Mosque of Amr, but these do not survive. The large vizieral palace () that was built on the shore of the Nile, outside the city walls of Cairo, has also disappeared without a trace. The only surviving piece of work is the mihrab of the Mosque of Ibn Tulun, commissioned during the first months of his rule.

<doc id="1305435" wikidata="Q2503631" url="?curid=1305435" title="Texas State Highway 6">
<text>State Highway 6 (SH 6) runs from the Red River, the Texas–Oklahoma state line, to northwest of Galveston, where it is known as the Old Galveston Highway. In Sugar Land and Missouri City, it is known as Alvin-Sugarland Road and runs perpendicular to Interstate 69/U.S. Highway 59 (I-69/US 59). In the Houston area, it runs north to Farm to Market Road 1960 (FM 1960), then northwest along US 290 to Hempstead, and south to Westheimer Road and Addicks, and is known as Addicks Satsuma Road. In the Bryan–College Station area, it is known as the Earl Rudder Freeway. In Hearne, it is known as Market Street. In Calvert, it is known as Main Street. For most of its length, SH 6 is not a limited-access road. In 1997, the Texas Legislature designated SH 6 as the Texas Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway.

==History==

===Historic routes===

SH 6 was one of the original 25 state highways proposed on June 21, 1917, overlaying the King of Trails Highway. From 1919, the routing mostly followed present-day US 75 from Oklahoma to Dallas, then US 77 to Waco.

=== Current routes ===
On August 21, 1923, SH 6 was extended along the eastern Gulf Division branch of SH 2 to keep SH 2 from having two separate highways with the same number. In 1926, US 75 and US 77 were overlaid on northern SH 6 from Waco northward through the Dallas area to Denison, and US 75 was overlaid on the section from Houston to Galveston. In 1935, US 290 was overlaid on the section from Hempstead to Houston. While the routes were marked concurrently, the concurrent SH 6 kept its numbering until September 26, 1939, when SH 6 was truncated to the Gulf Division routing ending at Waco. It was rerouted south from Hempstead to Galveston, replacing SH 242 and SH 38.

On September 26, 1945, the roadway was extended northwest to Breckenridge over SH 67, continuing northwest to near Throckmorton along SH 157, which was decommissioned. That same day, the section in southeast Texas between Hempstead and Sugar Land was canceled, as it was redundant with the new FM 359. On August 20, 1952, the route was truncated on the north side, ending near Breckenridge. This section was transferred to US 183. On September 26, 1967, SH 6 was rerouted to bypass Bremond, with the old route through Bremond transferred to SH 14 and FM 46. On November 1, 1968, the section between Hempstead and Sugar Land was re-established, as it was routed along US 290 until it reached FM 1960, then replacing FM 1960 southward to where the southern branch of SH 6 intersected to what is now I-69/US 59 in Sugar Land. That portion of FM 1960 from US 290 to then US 90 at Addicks was built in the 1950s, replacing and rerouting some of what was known as Jackrabbit Road. In the early 1970s, the northern section underwent a massive rerouting due to realignments of numerous U.S. and state highways. On August 4, 1971, the section from Breckenridge south to Eastland was redesignated as SH 69. SH 6 was instead rerouted west along US 80 to Cisco, then replaced US 380 northwest to near Old Glory. The route was again extended on July 31, 1975, replacing SH 283 between Old Glory and Stamford northward to the Texas–Oklahoma border, completing the current routing of SH 6. The old route of SH 6 was transferred to new SH 283. On October 27, 1989, a section from US 90A to McKeever Road (McKeever Bypass) was added.

A spur, SH 6A was designated on August 1, 1928, from SH 6 to Texas City. On March 19, 1930, this route was renumbered as SH 146.

In June 2016, a section of the highway in Eastland County between Cisco and Albany was destroyed due to major flooding.

==Route description==
SH 6 begins at an intersection with I-45 and SH 3 in Bayou Vista, and proceeds to the northwest, paralleling the ATSF railroad tracks. The highway makes a mostly straight line through Galveston, Brazoria, and Fort Bend Counties, passing through the city of Alvin. As the highway traverses through Sugar Land, it makes a turn to the north after passing intersections with I-69/US 59 and Alternate US 90. The highway continues north into western Harris County, reaching the Westpark Tollway and I-10. It then intersects US 290 in CyFair, joining it as they travel to the northwest, thus finishing a large routing around the southern and western portions of Houston. The route continues northwest with US 290 as a limited-access highway. At Hockley, the highway veers to the right, forking from an old alignment of the highway, and bypassing the cities of Waller and Hempstead to the north. At Hempstead, it splits from US 290 and turns northward into Grimes County, where it bypasses the city of Navasota, while Business SH 6 passes through town. The highway then turns northwest again, crossing into Brazos County. The highway starts another bypass here, going around the Bryan–College Station area to the northeast, while the business route goes through these cities. On the northeast side of Bryan, the highway meets US 190, and they travel together to the northwest out of the region. SH 6 splits with US 190 in the town of Hearne, but joins US 79 before that route splits to the northeast about a mile north of town. SH 6 then continues northwest, traveling through lesser populated farmlands, before approaching Waco. Before entering Waco, it turns southwest on Loop 340, and bypasses Waco to the south. It reaches an intersection with I-35, and then turns to the northwest again, crossing over Lake Waco. The highway continues northwest and west through more farmland regions in Central Texas, before reaching an intersection with I-20 just south of Eastland. The route briefly turns west, traveling along the former route of US 80, before turning back to the northwest at Cisco. As it continues, it is briefly concurrent with US 180/US 277 in north central Texas. Just northwest of Stamford, the highway makes its final turn to the north at an intersection with SH 283. The highway then travels through sparsely populated areas of Haskell, Knox, Foard, and Hardeman counties before ending north of Quanah at the Red River, where it meets Oklahoma State Highway 6.
