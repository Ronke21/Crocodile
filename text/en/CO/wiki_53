<text>Interstate 280 (I-280) is a Interstate Highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It provides a spur from I-80 in Parsippany–Troy Hills, Morris County, east to Newark and I-95 (New Jersey Turnpike) in Kearny, Hudson County. In Kearny, access is provided toward the Holland Tunnel and Lincoln Tunnel to New York City. The western part of the route runs through suburban areas of Morris and Essex counties, crossing the Watchung Mountains. Upon reaching The Oranges, the setting becomes more urbanized and I-280 runs along a depressed alignment before ascending again in Newark. I-280 includes a vertical-lift bridge, the William A. Stickel Memorial Bridge, over the Passaic River between Newark and East Newark/Harrison. The highway is sometimes called the Essex Freeway. I-280 intersects several roads, including the Garden State Parkway in East Orange and Route 21 in Newark.

A part of present-day I-280 in Newark west of the Stickel Bridge was legislated as Route 25A in 1939, a spur of Route 25 (US Route 1/9 [US 1/9]) that was to run from Jersey City west to Newark. This portion of road would become Route 58 in 1953 (the Route 58 designation was removed in the 1990s). When the Interstate Highway System was being planned, the Route 3 freeway was planned to become an Interstate. The New Jersey State Highway Department favored the Essex Freeway instead between Interstate 80 in Parsippany–Troy Hills to Interstate 95 in Kearny. The latter would become the Interstate and be designated I-280. This road was built in the 1960s and completed west from Newark in 1973. The portion east of Newark to the New Jersey Turnpike opened in 1980. I-280 was once planned to continue east to Interstate 78 near the Holland Tunnel but never was extended east of the New Jersey Turnpike. In the 2000s, the Stickel Bridge was reconstructed after the original structure was determined to be structurally deficient.

==Route description==

I-280 begins at the interchange with I-80 and US 46 in Parsippany–Troy Hills, Morris County, and heads southeast into wooded surroundings as a four-lane freeway. The road comes to its first interchange with New Road before crossing the Whippany River into East Hanover Township. The freeway runs near some fields before heading back into woods and entering Roseland, Essex County, at the crossing of the Passaic River. Shortly after the Passaic River, I-280 has a cloverleaf interchange with Eisenhower Parkway (CR 609). At this point, the roadway widens to six lanes and runs near wooded suburban areas, passing over the Morristown and Erie Railway&#x27;s Whippany Line before reaching CR 527 at another cloverleaf interchange. Past CR 527, I-280 makes a turn to the east before heading southeast into Livingston and interchanging with Laurel Avenue (CR 634). Following this exit, the road enters West Orange and passes through the Second Watchung Mountain in a cut. Past the mountain, the road heads back into suburban areas and comes to the exit for Pleasant Valley Way (CR 636), where the highway widens to eight lanes here and heads east to an interchange with Prospect Avenue (CR 577). After Prospect Avenue (CR 577), I-280 makes a sharp turn to the south and goes through the First Watchung Mountain in another cut, resuming into suburbs again and heading south-southeast as it intersects Mt. Pleasant Avenue (CR 660) and Northfield Avenue (CR 508 Spur).

The terrain becomes urban soon after exit 10, when it enters Orange. Here, I-280 narrows back to six lanes and heads onto a depressed alignment with frequent overpasses, running a short distance to the south of NJ Transit&#x27;s Morristown Line. Along this portion, the roadway has ramps to Essex Avenue, Day Street, and Center Street. Continuing into East Orange, the freeway passes under more streets as it runs next to the Morristown Line, passing south of Brick Church station and interchanging with Harrison and Clinton streets. Near East Orange station, I-280 comes to a full interchange with the Garden State Parkway, which also has access to CR 509 and Oraton Parkway. Following this junction, the highway widens to eight lanes before becoming 10 lanes at the border with Newark.
After crossing under more city streets, the roadway comes to exit 13, a left-side exit and entrance to and from the west accessing 1st Street and a ramp from the east to Orange Street. At this point, the total number of lanes on the road decreases from 10 to four, and I-280 eastbound heads up and over the exit 13 ramps, rejoining the westbound lanes on a bridge over 1st Street, Orange Street, and NJ Transit&#x27;s Newark Light Rail line. As the road returns to surface level and begins to parallel NJ Transit&#x27;s Morris &amp; Essex Lines and Montclair-Boonton Line to the north, an unused bridge carries the western end of the 1954 section of freeway over the railroad to Orange Street east of Duryea Street. After this, I-280 passes under Clifton Avenue, which it has access to, and Nesbitt Street. It rises again to pass over Martin Luther King Boulevard, which is also has access to, Broad Street, and Route 21. Just after a large interchange with Route 21, I-280 crosses the Passaic River again on the six-lane William A. Stickel Memorial Bridge, a vertical-lift bridge, briefly entering East Newark, Hudson County before it enters Harrison.

I-280 continues to run just north of the railroad as a six-lane freeway through Harrison, reaching an interchange with CR 508. The road continues southeast through urban surroundings before turning east and passing to the north of a railroad yard, splitting from the railroad line as it runs into Kearny and enters the New Jersey Meadowlands. At the final interchange with CR 508, I-280 has access to the Holland Tunnel via Route 7, US 1/9 Truck, and Route 139. Past CR 508, the freeway narrows to four lanes and comes to the toll plaza for the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) at exit 15W, at which point I-280 ends. Full access is provided with the Western Spur of the New Jersey Turnpike, which carries through I-95 traffic; ramps to and from the north on the Eastern Spur of the New Jersey Turnpike allow for access to the Lincoln Tunnel via Route 495.

==History==
What is now the easternmost part of I-280 was legislated as Route 25A in 1939. This route was a branch of Route 25 (US 1/9) that ran from Jersey City west through Kearny and Harrison across the Passaic River and into Newark, connecting with Route 21 and Clifton Avenue. The William A. Stickel Memorial Bridge opened in 1949, with approaches stretching east to Harrison Avenue (now CR 508) in Harrison (crossing Cleveland Avenue and Hamilton Street at-grade) and west beyond Route 21 to Broad Street. Route 25A was redesignated as Route 58 in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, and, the next year, an extension opened west beyond Clifton Avenue to Orange Street east of Duryea Street.

Around the time the Stickel Bridge opened, the Essex Freeway was planned to connect US 46 in Morris County east to the New Jersey Turnpike in Hudson County, with the intention of alleviating traffic along Route 10. During planning for the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s, the Bureau of Public Roads proposed an Interstate Highway along Route 3, to the north of Newark. The New Jersey State Highway Department countered with the proposed Essex Freeway, which would run from Interstate 80 to the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95) via the existing Route 58, saying that the Route 3 corridor &quot;does not meet Interstate standards, and cannot be economically converted to such standards.&quot; The Essex Freeway was selected as the Interstate corridor, which was called FAI Corridor 105 before being designated I-280 in 1958.

Construction progressed slowly, starting in 1960 near Orange. There were many obstacles that had to be overcome when constructing I-280. The first was whether to build the highway on an elevated or depressed alignment through urbanized areas of East Orange and Newark. Following opposition to the elevated option, it was decided to build I-280 on a depressed alignment through the area. In addition, there was an issue of building the road across First Watchung Mountain in West Orange. A tunnel had initially been considered, although the expense of such a project caused this alternative to be rejected. Instead, a rock cut along a longer route was built through the mountain. Much of the material that was excavated from this section of I-280 and east was removed via a temporary rail line that was built in the center of the right-of-way west to Interstate 80.
The construction of I-280 destroyed a large part of the historic urban cores of Orange, East Orange, and Newark, while providing a path for shoppers to head to shopping malls in surrounding suburban communities rather than shop in aging downtowns that had been disrupted by the highway construction. Many commercial buildings and historic Victorian homes in Orange and East Orange were demolished in the process. In the 1966 plans, I-280 was to continue east to Interstate 78 in Jersey City near the Holland Tunnel, following the CR 508 and Route 7 corridors; this was planned again in the 1970s but never built. I-280 fully opened west from Newark to Interstate 80 in Parsippany–Troy Hills in 1973. The portion of I-280 east of Newark was planned on an alignment that would disrupt the fewest homes and would utilize existing railroad and utility right-of-way. The section east from Newark to the New Jersey Turnpike was built in 1979–1980.

By 1997, the redundant Route 58 designation had been removed from the portion through Newark. 

I-280, like many other highways in New Jersey, once had solar powered emergency call boxes every , however, with the advent of cell phones, the usage of these call boxes became extremely limited. To save on maintenance costs, NJDOT removed these call boxes in 2005.

In September 2006, construction began on improvements to exit 12. This project, which replaced the ramps with longer and wider ones, was completed in November 2007 at the price of $11 million, and was completed three years ahead of schedule.

In 2001, the state determined the Stickel Bridge over the Passaic River and its approaches were structurally deficient and was going to need to be replaced after sections of it were falling apart. Instead of replacing the bridge, in 2007, the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) decided to rehabilitate it at a lower cost. Reconstruction of the bridge was completed in April 2009 at a cost of $33 million (equivalent to $ in ).

A major reconstruction occurred at exit 15 in Newark from 2015 to 2018.

Replacement of partial access in central Harrison with service roads, a new interchange, and an overpass (to improve access to Harrison Avenue, the PATH station, and Sports Illustrated Stadium, and to give north–south passage to local street traffic) is in the planning stages.

<text>Interstate 280 (I-280) is a auxiliary Interstate Highway in Ohio that connects I-75 in northeast Toledo with I-80/I-90 (part of the Ohio Turnpike) southeast of the city in northeastern Wood County. Built between 1955 and 1959, the route was originally part of the Detroit–Toledo Expressway. Although first designated in 1959, the highway originally contained several at-grade intersections and other features which left it substandard to the Interstate Highway System until 1990. Further construction in 2007 built a new crossing of the Maumee River, replacing an outdated drawbridge. The highway serves as an easterly bypass of the Toledo metropolitan area, passing through the communities of Northwood and Oregon. It is one of two auxiliary Interstate Highways serving Toledo, the other being I-475.

==Route description==

The southern end of I-280 is an interchange in Wood County with exit  71 along the Ohio Turnpike, which carries I-80 and I-90 at this point. South of this interchange, the I-280 freeway transitions to State Route 420 (SR 420), a divided highway without access control, that also provides access to a truck stop and other businesses. Continuing north, I-280 runs through farmland and through an interchange with Bahnsen Road, which also provides access to other motorist- and trucking-related businesses and access to Latcha and Hanley roads. North of the SR 795 interchange, the freeway turns to the northwest. At the Walbridge Road interchange in Walbridge, I-280 turns back due north. On either side of the Interstate, the surroundings transition from farms to residential subdivisions. I-280 crosses a major Norfolk Southern Railway railroad line also used by the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; and &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; passenger train routes operated by Amtrak. North of this crossing, the freeway passes into Lucas County. I-280 turns northwesterly again in the city of Oregon. This area is suburban residential neighborhoods as the freeway approaches the Maumee River. The Interstate crosses the river on the Veterans&#x27; Glass City Skyway, an , cable-stayed bridge. On the opposite bank of the river, I-280 turns northward and passes through an interchange with SR 25. There is one final interchange with I-75 where I-280 terminates.

==History==
The highway that would eventually carry I-280, the Detroit–Toledo Expressway, opened as a relocated SR 120 between US Route 20 (US 20) and SR 51 by 1955. The highway was extended to Summit Street in Toledo by 1957 and, by 1959, was extended into Michigan. By this time, the I-280 designation had been added, but the portion carrying I-280 was not fully converted to Interstate standards until 1990.

Initially, the freeway had several at-grade intersections with crossroads: Hanley and Latcha roads near Millbury; Ayers, Lemoyne, and Walbridge roads near Walbridge; and Curtice Road in Northwood. The Walbridge intersection was later upgraded to a traffic signal, one of the few on the Interstate Highway System at the time, while the intersection underwent study for conversion to an interchange. Hanley and Latcha roads were truncated to dead-end just before the freeway, but access to both roads was retained by construction of a new interchange and service drives in the early 1970s; the Ayers and Lemoyne crossings were also upgraded to overpasses at this point. The removal of direct access to Hanley and Latcha was originally disputed by business owners who owned motels and gas stations along those roads. The crossing at Curtice Road was upgraded to an interchange concurrently with the upgrade of the nearby interchange with Woodville Road.

Originally, I-280 was carried across the Maumee River by the Robert Craig Memorial Bridge, a drawbridge that frequently caused backups along the route. In addition, a ramp leading from northbound Summit Street to southbound I-280 merged directly onto the bridge with no acceleration room, so it was removed in the mid-1990s. On June 24, 2007, the Veterans&#x27; Glass City Skyway opened, replacing the drawbridge. After the Glass City Skyway opened, the Craig Bridge was reconstructed, and it now carries SR 65. Its construction also led to the reconstruction of the Front Street exit and removal of the Summit Street interchange entirely; access from I-280 to Summit Street is now provided by the Front Street exit and the Craig Bridge.

<text>Thayer David (born David Thayer Hersey; March 4, 1927 – July 17, 1978) was an American film, stage, and television actor. He was best known for his work on the ABC serial &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; (1966–1971), as Dragon, the Albino ex-Nazi Director of C-2 in &quot;The Eiger Sanction&quot; (1975) and as the fight promoter Miles Jergens in &quot;Rocky&quot; (1976).

His raspy, distinctive voice lent itself to voice-over work in commercials and instructional films.

==Early life==
Thayer David was born March 4, 1927, in Medford, Massachusetts. His father, Thayer Frye Hersey, was an executive in the paper pulp industry. David attended Harvard University in the 1940s but did not graduate, concentrating instead upon a career on the stage. With financial support from his father, he co-founded the Brattle Theater Company (1948–1952) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and established himself in the professional theatre.

He went on to act in &quot;The Relapse&quot; 1950 (Sir Tunbelly Clumsey); &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; 1951 (Grumio); &quot;The Way of the World&quot; 1954 (Petulant); &quot; The Carefree Tree &quot; 1955 (The Sixth Son); &quot;King Lear&quot; 1956 (Duke of Cornwall); &quot;Mister Johnson&quot; 1956 (Gollup); &quot;Saint Joan&quot; 1956 (The Inquisitor); &quot;Protective Custody&quot; 1956 (Dr. Steidl); &quot;Oscar Wilde&quot; 1957 (Oscar Wilde); &quot;The Golden Six&quot; 1958 (Tiberius); &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; 1961 (Cardinal Wolsey); &quot;La Belle&quot; 1962; &quot;Andorra&quot; 1963 (pub keeper); &quot;The Seagull&quot; 1964 (Sorin); &quot;The Crucible&quot; 1964 (Danforth); &quot;Baker Street&quot; 1965 (Moriarty); &quot;The Royal Hunt of the Sun&quot; 1965 (Miguel Estete); &quot;Ring Round the Moon&quot; 1966 (Messerchann); &quot;Those That Play the Clowns&quot; 1966 (Henning); &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; 1966 (Rusty Trawler); &quot;The Sorrows of Frederick&quot; 1967; &quot;The Bench&quot; 1968 (Phillipi); &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; 1971 (Serebryakov); &quot;The Jockey Club Stakes&quot; 1973 (Sir Dymock Blackburn); and &quot;The Dogs of Pavlov&quot; 1974.

==Film and television==

David played the dark and menacing role of Count Saknussem in the film &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; (1959). From 1966 to 1971, David portrayed various characters on ABC&#x27;s daytime phenomenon &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;. His many roles on &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; included Matthew Morgan, Ben Stokes, Professor T. Elliot Stokes, Sandor Rakosi, Count Andreas Petofi, Timothy Stokes (Parallel Time), Mordecai Grimes, and Ben Stokes (Parallel Time). David played different roles in each of the spinoff movies - &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot; (1970, playing Professor T. Elliot Stokes); and &quot;Night of Dark Shadows&quot; (1971, playing Reverend Strack).

On the big screen, he played Reverend Silas Pendrake in &quot;Little Big Man&quot; (1970). He also played the professional arsonist Charlie Robbins in &quot;Save the Tiger&quot; (1973) with Jack Lemmon, the afflicted spymaster Dragon in &quot;The Eiger Sanction&quot; (1975) with Clint Eastwood, and fight promoter Miles Jergens in &quot;Rocky&quot; (1976) (reunited with Save the Tiger director John G. Avildsen).

He played numerous characters on different TV series, including &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;Ellery Queen&quot;, &quot;Kojak&quot;, &quot;Petrocelli&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, and &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;.

David appeared in TV movies such as Nikita Khrushchev in &quot;Francis Gary Powers: The True Story of the U-2 Spy Incident&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Amazing Howard Hughes&quot; (1977), as well as miniseries such as &quot;Roots&quot;, &quot;The Rhinemann Exchange&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

In 1977, David played the title role in &quot;Nero Wolfe&quot;, Paramount Television&#x27;s made-for-TV movie based on the Rex Stout novel &quot;The Doorbell Rang&quot;. David portrayed the corpulent detective Nero Wolfe, who took on clients grudgingly and solved mysteries dazzlingly. Intended to be the pilot for a series, the film was shelved by ABC. It eventually aired December 18, 1979, 17 months after David&#x27;s death. He also played an important role as the lead antagonist, Mr. Edward Byron, in the made-for-TV film &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (1977), which served as the pilot for the 1978 TV series &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;.

==Personal life==
A resident of Manhattan, David collected walking sticks, 18th century European landscape paintings, and Victorian furniture. &quot;He was the most widely educated and best-read actor I&#x27;ve ever encountered,&quot; said Frank D. Gilroy, who wrote and directed the 1977 TV movie &quot;Nero Wolfe&quot;.

He was married to and divorced from film and television actress Valerie French.

David died July 17, 1978, of a heart attack in New York City at the age of 51. He and French had been planning to remarry. He was cremated.

<doc id="1287467" wikidata="Q1371024" url="?curid=1287467" title="Joseph Ward">
<text>Sir Joseph George Ward, 1st Baronet, (26 April 1856 – 8 July 1930) was a New Zealand politician who served as the 17th prime minister of New Zealand from 1906 to 1912 and from 1928 to 1930. He was a dominant figure in the Liberal and United ministries of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Ward was born into an Irish Catholic family in Melbourne, Victoria. In 1863, financial hardship forced his family to move to New Zealand, where he completed his education. Ward established a successful grain trade in Invercargill in 1877 and soon became prominent in local politics. He became a Member of Parliament in 1887. Following the election of the Liberal Government in 1891, Ward was appointed as Postmaster-General under John Ballance; he was promoted to Minister of Finance in the succeeding ministry of Richard Seddon.

Ward became Prime Minister on 6 August 1906, following Seddon&#x27;s death two months earlier. In his first period of government, Ward advocated greater unity within the British Empire, led New Zealand to Dominion status, and increased New Zealand&#x27;s contribution to the Royal Navy. His government faced strong opposition from the Reform Party and the newly formed socialist parties. He led the Liberal Party to two election victories, in 1908 and 1911, albeit with a one-seat majority in the latter. He resigned as head of government on 28 March 1912.

During the First World War, Ward led his party in a coalition with the Reform Party. As co-leader of the government, Ward had a strained working relationship with Prime Minister William Massey. The coalition was dissolved in 1919 and Ward resigned as Liberal leader.

After a six-year absence from national politics, Ward returned to parliament in 1925. He became Prime Minister on 10 December 1928, as leader of the United Party, which had formed from the remnants of the former Liberal Party. Ward attempted to rejuvenate liberal support in New Zealand but his party lost ground to the New Zealand Labour Party. Failing health forced his retirement from leadership on 28 May 1930.

==Early life==

Ward was born in Melbourne on 26 April 1856 to a Roman Catholic family of Irish descent. His father, William, died in 1860, aged 31 – Ward was raised by his mother, successful businesswoman Hannah Ward Barron. In 1863, the family moved to Bluff (then officially known as Campbelltown), in New Zealand&#x27;s Southland region, seeking better financial security – Hannah Ward Barron established a shop and a boarding house.

Ward received his formal education at primary schools in Melbourne and Bluff. He did not go to secondary school. He did, however, read extensively, and also picked up a good understanding of business from his mother. In 1869, Ward found a job at the Post Office, and later as a clerk. Later, with the help of a loan from his mother, Ward began to work as a freelance trader, selling supplies to the newly established Southland farming community.

==Early political career==







Ward became involved in local politics very quickly. He was elected to the Campbelltown (Bluff) Borough Council in 1878, despite being only 21 years old – at age 25 he became Mayor, the youngest in New Zealand. He also served on the Bluff Harbour Board, eventually becoming its chairman. In 1887, Ward stood for Parliament, winning the seat of Awarua. Politically, Ward was a supporter of politicians such as Julius Vogel and Robert Stout, leaders of the liberal wing of Parliament – Ward&#x27;s support was unusual in the far south.

Ward became known as a strong debater on economic matters. In 1891, when the newly founded Liberal Party came to power, the new Prime Minister, John Ballance, appointed Ward as Postmaster General. Later, when Richard Seddon became Prime Minister after Ballance&#x27;s death, Ward became Treasurer (Minister of Finance). Ward&#x27;s basic political outlook was that the state existed to support and promote private enterprise, and his conduct as Treasurer reflects this.

Ward&#x27;s increasing occupation with government affairs led to neglect of his own business interests, however, and his personal finances began to deteriorate. In 1896, a judge declared Ward &quot;hopelessly insolvent&quot;. This placed Ward, as Treasurer, in a politically difficult situation, and he was forced to resign his portfolios on 16 June. In 1897, he was forced to file for bankruptcy, which legally obligated him to resign his seat in Parliament. A loophole meant that there was nothing to stop him contesting it again, however. In the resulting by-election he was elected with an increased majority. Ward gained considerable popularity as a result of his financial troubles – he was widely seen as a great benefactor of the Southland region, and public perceptions were that he was being persecuted by his enemies over an honest mistake.

Gradually, Ward rebuilt his businesses, and paid off his creditors. Seddon, still Prime Minister, quickly reappointed him to Cabinet where he served as Minister of Railways and Postmaster-General. On 19 June 1901, on the occasion of the visit of TRH the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later King George V and Queen Mary) to New Zealand, he was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) for overseeing the introduction of the Penny Post throughout New Zealand.

Ward gradually emerged as the most prominent of Seddon&#x27;s supporters, and was seen as a possible successor. As Seddon&#x27;s long tenure as Prime Minister continued, some suggested that Ward should challenge Seddon for the leadership, but Ward was unwilling. In 1906, Seddon unexpectedly died. Ward was in London at the time. It was generally agreed in the party that Ward would succeed him, although the return journey would take two months – William Hall-Jones became Prime Minister until Ward arrived. Ward was sworn in on 6 August 1906.
==First premiership==

Ward was not seen by most as being of the same calibre as Seddon. The diverse interests of the Liberal Party, many believed, had been held together only by Seddon&#x27;s strength of personality and his powers of persuasion – Ward was not seen as having the same qualities. Frequent internal disputes led to indecision and frequent policy changes, with the result being paralysis of government.

The Liberal Party&#x27;s two main support bases, left-leaning urban workers and conservative small farmers, were increasingly at odds, and Ward lacked any coherent strategy to solve the problem – any attempt to please one group simply alienated the other. Ward increasingly focused on foreign affairs, which was seen by his opponents as a sign that he could not cope with the country&#x27;s problems.

In 1901, Ward established the world&#x27;s first Ministry of Health and Tourism, and became the British Empire&#x27;s first Minister of Public Health. On 26 September 1907, Ward proclaimed New Zealand&#x27;s new status as a Dominion. He presided over a period of economic prosperity and provided state funds to help new settlers to the country. Public works schemes continued under his government with new infrastructure being built.

In the 1908 election the Liberals won a majority, but in the 1911 election Parliament appeared to be deadlocked. The Liberals survived for a time on the casting vote of the Speaker, but Ward, discouraged by the result, resigned from the premiership in March the following year. The party replaced him with Thomas Mackenzie, his Minister of Agriculture, whose government survived only a few more months.

Ward, who most believed had finished his political career, returned to the back benches and refused several requests to resume the leadership of the disorganised Liberals. He occupied himself with relatively minor matters, and took his family on a visit to England, where he was created a baronet by King George V on 20 June 1911.

==Leader of the Opposition==

On 11 September 1913, however, Ward finally accepted the leadership of the Liberal Party once again. Ward extracted a number of important concessions from the party, insisting on a very high level of personal control – he felt that the party&#x27;s previous lack of direction was the primary cause for its failure. He also worked to build alliances with the growing labour movement, which was now standing candidates in many seats. Ward lead the Liberals into the 1914 election and gained two seats. Despite the gains the Reform government was reduced to a bare minimum majority and when a by-election in Dunedin Central was triggered early the next year there was much at stake. The Liberal Party chose not contest the election themselves but Ward actively toured the electorate holding meetings to encourage the electors to vote for the Labour candidate Jim Munro. In the event of a Labour victory it was conceivable for Ward to form a minority government with Labour support. Ward had made preparation for a return to power, but the Reform Party managed to hold the seat.

On 12 August 1915, Ward and accepted a proposal by William Massey and the governing Reform Party to form a joint administration for World War I. Ward became deputy leader of the administration, also holding the Finance portfolio. Relations between Ward and Massey were not good – besides their political differences, Ward was an Irish Catholic, and Massey was an Irish Protestant. The administration ended on 21 August 1919 following a decision made by caucus to do so two months earlier.

In the 1919 election Ward lost the seat of Awarua, and left Parliament. In 1923, he contested a by-election in Tauranga, but was defeated by a Reform Party candidate, Charles Macmillan. Ward was largely considered a spent force. In the 1925 election, however, he narrowly returned to Parliament as MP for Invercargill. Ward contested the seat under the &quot;Liberal&quot; label, despite the fact that the remnants of the Liberal Party were now calling themselves by different names – his opponents characterised him as living in the past, and of attempting to fight the same battles over again. Ward&#x27;s health was also failing.

In 1928 the remnants of the Liberal Party reasserted themselves as the new United Party, focused around George Forbes (leader of one faction of the Liberals), Bill Veitch (leader of another faction), and Albert Davy (a former organiser for the Reform Party). Forbes and Veitch both sought the leadership, and neither gained a clear advantage. Davy invited Ward to step in as a compromise candidate, perhaps hoping that Ward&#x27;s status as a former Prime Minister would create a sense of unity.

==Second premiership==

Ward accepted an offer from Albert Davy and became leader of the new United Party, fighting off three other contenders. His health, however, was still poor, and he found the task difficult. In the 1928 election campaign, Ward startled both his supporters and his audience by promising to borrow £70 million in the course of a year to revive the economy – this is believed to have been a mistake caused by Ward&#x27;s failing eyesight. Despite the strong objections his party had to this &quot;promise&quot;, it was sufficient to prompt a massive surge in support for United – in the election United gained the same number of seats as Reform.

With the backing of the Labour Party, Ward became Prime Minister again, 22 years after his original appointment. He also briefly served as Minister of External Affairs in 1929. Ward was also attempting to rejuvenate liberal support in New Zealand. His cabinet was rather youthful, with only two members (Thomas Wilford and Āpirana Ngata), other than himself, having held ministerial portfolios before. Ward, as Finance Minister, passed a mini-budget at the end of 1928 appropriating £1,175,000 for public works construction. In 1929 the government reneged on the £70 million borrowing promise and introduced a watered down land tax. In October, under increasing pressure from Labour, Ward made moves to reduce the growing unemployment numbers.

==Health and death==
Ward&#x27;s health continued to decline. From late-September 1929 Ward seldom attended debates in the House and from March 1930 Ward was too ill to even hold meetings of the Cabinet. He suffered a number of heart attacks, and soon it was Forbes who was effectively running the government. Ward was determined not to resign, and remained Prime Minister until well after he had lost the ability to perform the role effectively. On 28 May 1930, Ward succumbed to strong pressure from his colleagues and his family, and passed the premiership to Forbes. Ward had been promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1930 New Year Honours.

Ward remained a member of the cabinet as a Minister without Portfolio, but died shortly afterwards, on 8 July. He was given a state funeral with a Requiem Mass celebrated on 9 July at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Hill St, Wellington. Ward had been an active worshipper there (and at its destroyed predecessor, St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral) for all of his thirty-seven years as an MP.

The Mass was celebrated by Bishop O&#x27;Shea (the Coadjutor Archbishop of Wellington), and Archbishop Redwood, 1st Archbishop of Wellington, delivered the panegyric.

Ward was buried with considerable ceremony in Bluff. His son Vincent was elected to replace him as MP for Invercargill.

<text>Judith Richardson Haimes is an American woman from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who worked as a psychic in Newark, Delaware, until an allergic reaction to the iodine tracer injected for a CAT scan allegedly disabled her psychic abilities. She sued Temple University Hospital and was awarded over $600,000 for pain and suffering and loss of income. This award was later overturned on appeal, 39 Pa. D. &amp; C.3d 381 (Pa.Com.Pl. 1986). Haimes currently lives with her husband Allen Haimes in Florida and writes a syndicated newspaper column on grieving.

Haimes&#x27; case was the subject of the book &quot;Judith&quot; by her husband.

The case is often cited in discussions of frivolous lawsuits and tort reform in the United States, but the facts are also often misrepresented. Contrary to popular belief, Haimes never claimed that a CAT scan had caused her to lose her psychic powers. In fact, the often alluded-to CAT scan never took place. Haimes only claimed that the headaches resulting from her allergic reaction prevented her from earning a living as a psychic.

Haimes previously earned a lucrative living by offering sessions in which she ostensibly read individuals&#x27; auras, offering them medical as well as personal advice. She gained a reputation following an article in Philadelphia magazine that described seances she conducted at a wealthy Chestnut Hill patron&#x27;s house.

<text>Alpha Lambda Delta () is an honor society for students who have achieved a 3.5 GPA or higher during their first year or term of higher education.

==History==
Alpha Lambda Delta was founded in 1924 by the Dean of Women, Maria Leonard, at the University of Illinois to recognize academic excellence among freshmen women. One year before, Dean Thomas Arkle Clark had founded Phi Eta Sigma, an honor society to recognize academic excellence among freshmen males. Both groups operated as single sex organizations until the mid-70s when they both became coeducational in response to Title IX.

At the first meeting of the chapter, Florence Finn, president of the society, presented a passage from Plato&#x27;s Republic in which Socrates asks the question, &quot;“Will they hold torches and pass them to one another...?”&quot;. This idea, together with the symbol of a candle and the concept of sharing the love of learning with others, caught the imagination of the charter members.

The honor society soon became a national organization through the chartering of chapters at Purdue University in 1926, at DePauw University in 1927, at the University of Michigan in 1927, and at the University of Oklahoma in 1929. 

The first national convention was held in 1930 on the campus of the University of Illinois. Conventions were suspended during the Depression years because of travel expenses. The third convention was held in 1938 at the University of Michigan. A decision was made at that convention to suspend holding a national convention and to invest those funds into establishing a graduate fellowship fund. The first fellowship was awarded to Louise Houssiere for graduate study at MIT in 1940.

The Association of College Honor Societies was organized in 1925 to consider matters of mutual concern to member organizations; Alpha Lambda Delta has been active in the Association since its admission to membership in 1939. In 1976 in response to Title IX, the National Council voted for the Society to become coeducational. In 1981, the first two male members of the National Council were installed.

Alpha Lambda Delta has continued to be innovative and responsive in recognizing academic excellence by providing Senior Certificates and the Maria Leonard Senior Book Award since 1939, offering workshops since 1978, recognizing outstanding chapters with the Order of the Torch Award since 1989, recognizing an Outstanding Adviser of the Year since 1990, and taking advantage of technology by posting a national web site in January 1997.

The Society has over 1.3 million lifetime members. ALD initiates between 25,000 and 30,000 new members each year.

==Symbols==
The society&#x27;s colors are maroon and gold. Members are entitled to wear Alpha Lambda Delta honor cords at their graduation exercises. 

Its symbol is the candle. Its annual publication is &quot;The Flame&quot;. The Alpha Lambda Delta pillars are Academics, Scholarships, Service, Career Development, and Belonging.

==Activities==
Each year, National Alpha Lambda Delta awards over $211,000 in scholarships and to members. Undergraduate members may also be awarded the Jo Anne Trow Scholarship; 50 scholarships are given annually. The James G. Stemler Scholarship was designed for members who wish to study abroad, and 20 scholarships are awarded each year. Twenty eight graduate fellowships are awarded annually to members pursuing graduate education.

Students in each chapter who have succeeded in maintaining the highest GPA from among their school&#x27;s membership may be awarded the Maria Leonard Senior Book Award, the presentation of a book with an inscribed bookplate.

== Chapters ==

Alpha Lambda Delta has chapters at 410 campuses in the United States.
== Membership ==
Members are invited to join by the local chapters, after the chapter has determined that the student has achieved a 3.5 or higher GPA in their first year or term of enrollment in an institution of higher education. The members of the local chapters are also considered to be members of the National organization.

== Governence ==
The National organization is governed by a Board of Directors. The policies adopted by the Board of Directors, and annually by the chapters, are administered by ALD Headquarters. Headquarters is located in Fairport, New York. All administrative details of operating the Society are carried out through ALD Headquarters.

<doc id="1287482" wikidata="Q4580939" url="?curid=1287482" title="Jeffrey Hudson">
<text>Jeffrey Hudson (1619 – ) was a court dwarf of the English queen Henrietta Maria of France. He was famous as the &quot;Queen&#x27;s dwarf&quot; and &quot;Lord Minimus&quot; and was considered one of the &quot;wonders of the age&quot; because of his extreme but well-proportioned smallness. He fought with the Royalists in the English Civil War and fled with the Queen to France but was expelled from her court when he killed a man in a duel. He was captured by Barbary pirates and spent 25 years enslaved in North Africa before being ransomed back to England.

==Early life and rise to prominence==
Hudson was baptised in Oakham in Rutland on 14 June 1619. His parents, three brothers, and a half-sister were all of average size. Hudson&#x27;s father, John, was keeper of the baiting bulls for George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham. Hudson&#x27;s marvellous smallness and normal proportions became apparent in early childhood. Various theories existed for his size, including that his mother choked on a gherkin while pregnant, but he probably had a growth hormone deficiency caused by a pituitary gland disorder.

In 1626, Jeffrey Hudson was presented to the Duchess of Buckingham as a &quot;rarity of nature&quot;, and she invited him to join the household. A few months later, the Duke and Duchess entertained King Charles I and his young French wife, Queen Henrietta Maria, in London. The climax of the lavish banquet was the presentation of Jeffrey to the Queen, served in a large pie. When the pie was placed in front of the Queen, Hudson arose from the crust, tall and dressed in a miniature suit of armour. The Queen was delighted, and the Duke and Duchess of Buckingham offered Hudson to her as an amusing gift.

==Hudson at the Queen&#x27;s court==

Hudson moved into Denmark House in London in late 1626, where the Queen maintained her royal household, with its many French attendants and Catholic priests. He was one of several natural curiosities and pets, among whom were a giant Welsh porter named William Evans, two disproportionate dwarves, and a monkey called Pug. He later developed a routine with Evans in which the porter pulled Hudson out of his pocket along with a loaf of bread and proceeded to make a sandwich. As he matured, Hudson learned to amuse and entertain with his wit, courtly behaviour, and appearance. Dwarves were not rare in the courts of Europe, but Hudson&#x27;s proportions and tiny size made him uniquely famous. His size was repeatedly described as 18 or 19 inches, and he was reported to have grown little between 7 and 30 years of age. He was often cast in picturesque roles in the elaborate costumed masques which were staged by Inigo Jones for the amusement of the court.

Hudson rode a horse with the queen and her household. Sidesaddles were provided for ten ladies and three laundry maids, while the &quot;dwarffe&quot; was provided with an elaborate livery saddle of velvet with laces and silver and silk fringes. The court tailor, Gilbert Morrett, made clothes for Hudson. He had &quot;an ash colour barracan suit with sleeves&quot;, &quot;a black mourning suit of Flanders say&quot;, and scarlet hose to wear under his armour. The Queen&#x27;s tailor, George Gillin, made clothes for the female dwarf Sarah, or &quot;little Sara&quot;, including an Italian gown of scarlet baize. Hudson and Sarah were dressed in the same fabrics as Henrietta Maria&#x27;s children. Daniel Mytens was commissioned to paint his portrait, &quot;a picture at large of Jeffry the dwarf in a wood or wilderness&quot;, for £40 in 1627.

In 1630, Hudson was included in a mission to France at about ten years of age. Although the principal purpose of the mission was to return with a midwife for the Queen&#x27;s first pregnancy, Hudson was likely sent for the appreciation of the French court. On the return journey across the English Channel, their ship was captured by Dunkirk pirates, who plundered the ship but eventually released them to return to England. Hudson&#x27;s second trip across the channel occurred in 1637, at age 18, when a group of courtiers travelled to the Netherlands to observe the siege of Breda, as the Dutch were attempting to expel the Spanish army.

Hudson was educated in the Queen&#x27;s household and learned the manners of the court. He was brought up in the Roman Catholic Church of her household. He learned to ride a horse and shoot a pistol. He was celebrated in a variety of poems and narratives of the day. However, despite his wit and intelligence, the novelty of his shortness was most prized, and all understood that if he had been of average height, he would have had no place at court. This is explicitly acknowledged in one of several adulatory poems.

==The coming of the Civil War and the dissolution of the court==
By 1640, the relationship between King Charles and the Parliament had deteriorated to plots and attempted arrests. Armed conflict broke out between the Royalists and the Parliamentarians in 1642. As Charles led the Royalist army, the Queen took a small number of her retinue, including Hudson, to the Netherlands to raise money and support for him. By selling articles from her palace, she raised enough to buy some supplies for the Royalist army but was unsuccessful in obtaining official support from the Protestant Dutch government. She returned to England with her courtiers, and they found themselves in the middle of a civil war.

They were able to join Royalist forces at Oxford. The Queen appointed Hudson a &quot;Captain of Horse.&quot; It is not known whether he commanded troops or saw combat in one of Prince Rupert&#x27;s cavalry raids. Still, he considered the appointment an honour rather than a joke and continued to style himself as &quot;Captain Jeffery Hudson&quot; later in life.

As it became apparent that the war was broadening rather than concluding, the Queen fled to France in 1643 with a small group of courtiers and household staff, again including Hudson. Although they were warmly received in France and provided with space in the Louvre Palace, the Queen was ailing after a difficult delivery, and she soon moved her court in exile to the spa at Nevers.

==Duel and disaster==
Royalist courtiers collected around the Queen, but Hudson had no interest in resuming his role of pet or clown and let it be known he would suffer no more jokes or insults. There is no record of the precise offence offered, but in October 1644, Hudson challenged the brother of William Crofts to a duel. Crofts arrived at the duel brandishing a large water squirt, but his flippancy would lead to his death, as Hudson fatally shot him in the forehead. Crofts&#x27;s death was a disaster for Hudson. Duelling had been outlawed in France, and this could be considered a transgression against hospitality, in addition to the fact that William Crofts was a powerful figure as the Queen&#x27;s Master of Horse and head of her lifeguard. Hudson was initially sentenced to death, but Henrietta Maria interceded for his life, and he was sent back to England.

==Slavery and redemption, poverty and death==
Hudson&#x27;s movements after leaving the Queen&#x27;s court in late 1644, aged 25 years, are unknown. Within months, he was on a ship captured by Barbary pirates. Hudson was enslaved in North Africa, where he spent perhaps his next 25 years labouring. The date and circumstances of his rescue or redemption are not known. In the 1660s, several missions were sent from England to Algeria and Tunis to ransom English captives, and his first documented presence back in England was in 1669. No details of his captivity were recorded except one fact: he claimed to have grown to during this time, doubling his height after 30 years of age, which he attributed to the hardships he had suffered.

The few contemporary records of Hudson&#x27;s years between 1669 and his death in 1682 consist of a few receipts for grants of money from the Duke of Buckingham and the new King. He did not return to the Queen&#x27;s court, even after the royal Restoration in 1660 and her return at the invitation of her son, Charles II. She resided in London for only five years, fleeing to France during the London plague of 1665. She died in France in 1669, when Hudson first reappeared in English records.

Hudson lived in Oakham for several years, where he was interviewed and a short record of his life made, by James Wright the antiquarian. In 1676, Hudson returned to London, perhaps to seek a pension from the royal court. He had the misfortune of arriving at a time of turbulent anti-Catholic activity, which included the &quot;Popish Plot&quot; of Titus Oates (also from Oakham) and was imprisoned &quot;for a considerable time&quot; at the Gatehouse Prison. Being a &quot;Roman Catholick&quot; was his only recorded offence, but he was not released until 1680. He died about two years later on an unknown date, in unknown circumstances, buried in an unmarked Catholic paupers&#x27; grave. A payment from Charles II in 1681 is the last record of Hudson.

<doc id="1287505" wikidata="Q465701" url="?curid=1287505" title="American Memory">
<text>American Memory is an Internet-based archive for public domain image resources, audio, video, and archived Web content. Published by the Library of Congress, the archive launched on October 13, 1994, after $13 million was raised in private donations.

==History==
The pilot for the American Memory project was a digitization program which started in 1990. Selected Library of Congress holdings including examples of film, video, audio recordings, books and photographs were digitized and distributed on Laserdisc and CD-ROM. When the World Wide Web accelerated in 1993, the pilot program was refocused to deliver digitized materials by way of the internet.

==Funding==
The National Digital Library was created through bipartisan support in the United States Congress. Initially publicly funded with $15 million over five years, a public-private partnership of entrepreneurs and philanthropists led to more than $45 million in private sponsorship from 1994 through 2000. At first, only $13 million was donated from private sectors but the project gained momentum as the years went on.

Beginning in 1996, the Library of Congress sponsored a three-year competition with a $2 million gift from the Ameritech Corporation to enable public research, and academic libraries, museums, historical societies, and archival institutions (with the exception of federal institutions) to digitize American history collections and make them available on the library&#x27;s American Memory site. The competition produced 23 digital collections that complement American Memory, which now features more than 100 thematic collections.

==Beginnings==
The American Memory project started as a two-part effort of the National Digital Library Project (NDLP). Starting in 1994, the goal of the NDLP to digitize millions of items by the year 2000 would not only be met but would even go beyond that when the year finally came. The first part or phase of the effort was piloted by the American Memory project which would have an extensive amount of the Library of Congress&#x27; source-materials digitized. Another segment of the first phase possessed the goal of establishing a way or model to somehow share or distribute such source-materials between libraries. Phase two of the project saw the continuation of the digitization of the materials from the Library of Congress but also other libraries as well.
The content included in the digital library through American Memory and the NDLP is vast and includes a wide array of historical items. Some items featured include, but is not limited to, the photographic collection on transportation, Henry Ford and the automobile, the sewing machine, and Robert J. Oppenheimer. As a result of the three-year competition and all the new individual projects making American Memory more readily available, American Memory started to become recognized on a larger scale. In 1996, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named American Memory one of the top ten best websites in the United States. The website was also among the six finalists in the Education segment of the National Information Infrastructure Awards Program in 1996. The project continued to receive citations and awards since it was established in 1990 and it has also helped serve on the research front from time to time.

==Significance==
The National Digital Library exceeded its goal of making five million items available online by 2000. American Memory will continue to expand online historical content as an integral component of the Library of Congress&#x27;s commitment to harnessing new technology as it fulfills its mission &quot;to sustain and preserve a universal collection of knowledge and creativity for future generations.&quot;

<text>Mekong Airlines was an airline based in Cambodia.

==History==
Founded in 1998 as Yana Airlines (), the company was renamed to Mekong Airlines in 2002. Mekong Airlines operated scheduled flights to several destinations in southeast Asia using a leased Boeing 737-500, which was put in service 15 January 2003 and returned on 16 October of that year, marking the end of the airline&#x27;s business. The airline was made up of mostly Australian management thanks to an agreement between Australian and Cambodian investors.

<doc id="1287511" wikidata="Q2448421" url="?curid=1287511" title="Echelon formation">
<text>An echelon formation () is a (usually military) formation in which its units are arranged diagonally. Each unit is stationed behind and to the right (a &quot;right echelon&quot;), or behind and to the left (&quot;left echelon&quot;), of the unit ahead. The name of the formation comes from the French word échelon, meaning a rung of a ladder, which describes the shape that this formation has when viewed from above or below.

== Military formation ==

Use of the formation dates back to ancient infantry and cavalry warfare, as an alternative to column, line-abreast, or phalanx (box) formations. One of its earliest uses was at the Battle of Leuctra, when the Thebans attacked the Spartan right with a column 48 men deep while their weaker center and right were repelled. The echelon formation may have been used by Hannibal at the Battle of Cannae, Alexander the Great at the Battle of Gaugamela, Frederick II of Prussia, and the Confederate army at the Battle of Gettysburg.
The tactic still persists and is regularly employed by all branches of the modern armed forces. Tactically, echelon formations are used because of the excellent range of vision offered to each participant in the formation. In particular, it is commonly employed by armored cavalry because of the large, overlapping fields of fire that it gives to each tank in the formation, and by combat aircraft, allowing them to communicate visually and maneuver as a single unit. 

&quot;Echeloning&quot; is the name of a tactic in use by the United Kingdom&#x27;s armed forces, mainly the infantry. It consists of using a company to attack a set of positions. Once the first platoon in the company has reached its limit of advance (ammunition has been expended, fatigue has become high, or casualties are mounting) another platoon &quot;echelons through&quot; it to continue onto the next position. The tactic is similar to leapfrogging.

Echelon formations are also commonly used by civic or riot police to move crowds either to the left or right. &quot;En echelon&quot; is also used for a type of arrangement of gun turrets on ships: see .

==Derived meanings==
The name has been adopted by the birdwatching community to describe the familiar V-shaped formations of flights of geese, ducks and other migratory birds, though this more symmetric formation is more strictly defined as a V formation.
In geology, &quot;en echelon&quot; describes an arrangement where a set of short linear features overlap or are staggered in a line that runs obliquely to the strike of the individual features. Echelon faults and en echelon veins are examples.

In sheet material response to shear stress it is typical for a series of echelon cracks to form. This is commonly seen in asphalt roads subject to shear stress imposed by aseismic fault creep.
In mathematics, the term row echelon form refers to a kind of matrix where the non-zero elements are shaped in an echelon-like manner. 

In road bicycle racing, an echelon formation is a diagonal line of racers, which allows cooperative drafting in crosswinds.

<doc id="1287520" wikidata="Q888126" url="?curid=1287520" title="Lester C. Hunt">
<text>Lester Callaway Hunt, Sr. (July 8, 1892June 19, 1954), was an American Democratic politician from the state of Wyoming. Hunt was the first to be elected to two consecutive terms as Wyoming&#x27;s governor, serving as its 19th governor from January 4, 1943, to January 3, 1949. In 1948, he was elected by a decisive margin to the U.S. Senate, and began his term on January 3, 1949.

Hunt supported a number of federal social programs and advocated for federal support of low-cost health and dental insurance policies. He also supported a variety of programs proposed by the Eisenhower administration following the Republican landslide in the 1952 elections, including the abolition of racial segregation in the District of Columbia, and the expansion of Social Security.

An outspoken opponent of Senator Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s anti-Communist campaign, Hunt challenged McCarthy and his senatorial allies by championing a proposed law restricting Congressional immunity and allowing individuals to sue members of Congress for slanderous statements. In June 1953, Hunt&#x27;s son was arrested in Washington, D.C., on charges of soliciting sex from an undercover male police officer (homosexual acts were prohibited by law at the time). Some Republican senators, including McCarthy, threatened Hunt with prosecution of his son and wide publication of the event unless he abandoned plans to run for re-election and resigned immediately, which Hunt refused to do. His son was convicted and fined on October 6, 1953. On April 15, 1954, Hunt announced his intention to run for re-election. He changed his mind, however, after McCarthy renewed the threat to use his son&#x27;s arrest against him. On June 19, Hunt died by suicide in his Senate office; his death dealt a serious blow to McCarthy&#x27;s image and was one of the factors that led to his censure by the Senate later in 1954.

==Early years==
Lester C. Hunt was born in Isabel, Illinois on July 8, 1892, a son of William Hunt and Viola (Callaway) Hunt. He was raised in Atlanta, Illinois, and graduated from Atlanta&#x27;s high school in 1912. Hunt played semi-professional baseball in Illinois, and visited Wyoming for the first time at age 19, when he joined a team in Lander.

Hunt attended Illinois Wesleyan University from 1912 to 1913, where he was a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, and then worked as a railroad switchman to put himself through dental school at Saint Louis University. After graduating with a DDS degree in 1917, he moved to Lander to establish a practice. He joined the United States Army Dental Corps when the United States entered World War I, and served as a lieutenant from 1917 to 1919. After postgraduate study at Northwestern University in 1920, Hunt resumed his practice in Lander. He was president of the Wyoming State Dental Society and began his career in government when appointed as president of the Wyoming State Board of Dental Examiners, serving from 1924 to 1928.

==Political career==

===Wyoming===
Hunt was elected in 1933 to the Wyoming House of Representatives from Fremont County. He sponsored eugenics legislation that would have permitted the sterilization of inmates at Wyoming institutions if &quot;afflicted with insanity, idiocy, imbecility, feeblemindedness, or epilepsy&quot;. The legislation, though similar to that enacted in several neighboring states in the 1920s, failed, and he later stated that he regretted sponsoring it. He was elected as Wyoming Secretary of State in 1934 and 1938, serving from 1935 to 1943. In 1935, he commissioned muralist Allen Tupper True to design the Bucking Horse and Rider that has appeared on Wyoming license plates since 1936. While serving as Secretary of State, Hunt personally claimed the copyright of the &quot;Wyoming Guidebook&quot;, a Work Projects Administration publication, after the Governor and legislature failed to act to preserve the bucking horse and rider design as the state&#x27;s intellectual property. The book proved popular, and there were questions as to whether Hunt benefited personally from its sales. He was able to demonstrate that he had endorsed all quarterly royalty checks and turned them over to the state treasurer, and he transferred the copyright to the State of Wyoming in 1942.

Hunt became the first person elected to two consecutive four-year terms as governor, serving from 1943 to 1949. He faced hostile majorities in both houses of the legislature throughout his years as governor. The principal legislative accomplishment of his first term was the enactment of a retirement system for teachers. He repeatedly proposed a retirement system for state workers in his second term without success. During his first term, Republican U.S. Senator Edward V. Robertson charged that the Japanese citizens interned at Heart Mountain, Wyoming, were leading pampered lives and hoarding supplies. The &quot;Denver Post&quot; wrote an exposé backing his complaints. Hunt dismissed that as a &quot;political story&quot; and said that &quot;food stuffs cannot be brought into a city to feed 13,500 people in a wheel barrow and it would not be good business to bring it in every day.&quot; He toured the camp and said the internees&#x27; &quot;living standard was, to my way of thinking, rather disgraceful.&quot; At the end of the war, he wrote to the War Relocation Authority that &quot;We do not want a single one of these evacuees to remain in Wyoming.&quot;

When President Roosevelt issued an executive order on March 16, 1943, creating Jackson Hole National Monument, Hunt joined in mobilizing opposition and said he would use state police to remove any federal official who tried to exert authority in the Monument&#x27;s lands. Congress refused to fund the Monument until 1950, when Wyoming&#x27;s two U.S. Senators, Joseph C. O&#x27;Mahoney and Hunt, reached a compromise with the Truman administration. It merged most of the Monument&#x27;s lands into Grand Teton National Park, provided compensation for lost revenue, and protected local property owners.

Hunt was a Wyoming delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1940, 1944, and 1948. He chaired the National Governors Association in 1948. His official gubernatorial portrait was painted by artist Michele Rushworth and hangs in the state capitol building in Cheyenne, Wyoming.

===U.S. Senate election===
Hunt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1948 to a term beginning January 3, 1949, defeating incumbent Republican E.V. Robertson by a comfortable margin. His political positions combined fiscal conservatism and opposition to big government with support for public housing and increased federal aid to education. During his tenure in the Senate, Hunt became a bitter enemy of Wisconsin senator Joseph R. McCarthy, and his criticism of McCarthy&#x27;s tactics marked him as a prime target in the 1954 election. For example, he campaigned for a law to restrict Congressional immunity by allowing individuals to sue members of Congress for slanderous statements. He called for reform of Senate rules: &quot;If situations confront the Congress in which it can no longer control its members by the rules of society, justice and fair play, then Congress has, I feel, a moral obligation to take drastic steps to remedy those situations.&quot;

===U.S. Senate tenure===
In 1949, he recommended that the American Medical Association (AMA) and the American Dental Association (ADA) consider endorsing a plan for the federal government to offer health insurance policies with low deductibles to cover &quot;medical, surgical, hospital, laboratory, nursing and dental services.&quot; He told an ADA convention:
He served on the Senate Crime Investigating Committee (known as the Kefauver Committee) and the Senate Armed Services Committee. He backed foreign aid programs and supported a call for disarmament designed to demonstrate that Russia&#x27;s peace proposals were not serious.

Following Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s landslide victory in the 1952 election, Hunt announced that he felt obliged to support the administration&#x27;s legislative proposals wherever possible. He cited complete agreement with plans for agricultural subsidies, the expansion of Social Security, the creation of a Fair Employment Practices Commission, and the abolition of segregation in the District of Columbia.

==Son&#x27;s arrest and Hunt&#x27;s suicide==
On June 9, 1953, Hunt&#x27;s 25-year-old son Lester Jr., known as &quot;Buddy&quot;, who was a student and president of the student body at the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was arrested in Washington, D.C., for soliciting sex from a male undercover police officer in Lafayette Square, just north of and adjacent to the White House property. It was his first offense, which police normally handled quietly as a matter for the offender&#x27;s family to address, but the arrest became known to Senate Republicans. According to Drew Pearson&#x27;s &quot;Washington Merry-Go-Round&quot; column published after Hunt&#x27;s death, Senators Styles Bridges and Herman Welker threatened that if Hunt did not immediately retire from the Senate and agree not to seek his seat in the 1954 election, they would see that his son was prosecuted and would widely publicize his son&#x27;s arrest.

In a closely divided Senate, Hunt&#x27;s resignation would have allowed Wyoming&#x27;s Republican governor to appoint a Republican to fill the remainder of Hunt&#x27;s term and to run as an incumbent in the 1954 election, possibly affecting the balance of power in the Senate in favor of Republicans. Hunt refused, and in response, Republican Senators threatened Inspector Roy Blick of the Morals Division of the Washington Police Department with the loss of his job for failing to prosecute Buddy Hunt. Buddy Hunt was prosecuted, and Senator Hunt attended the trial. On October 7, 1953, Buddy Hunt paid a fine for soliciting a plainclothes policeman &quot;for lewd and immoral purposes&quot;, and on the same day, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published the story. Buddy Hunt&#x27;s attorney was quoted in an October 8 &quot;New York Times&quot; account as saying his client preferred &quot;to avoid any further publicity.&quot; Aside from these brief media accounts, the arrest and prosecution of Buddy Hunt was not widely publicized at the time.

In December 1953, Hunt told journalist Pearson that he would not stand for re-election if the opposition used his son&#x27;s arrest against him, fearing that the publicity would have a negative effect on his wife&#x27;s health. Despite the threats of publicity from his political opponents, including a specific threat to distribute in Wyoming 25,000 leaflets about his son&#x27;s arrest, Hunt did announce on April 15, 1954, that he would be a candidate for re-election. A poll taken on April 5, 1954, gave Hunt 54.5% support, with his nearest opponent at 19.3%.

In May 1954, as a member of the Senate&#x27;s &quot;liberal bloc&quot;, he proposed rules for Senate committees designed to eliminate some of McCarthy&#x27;s tactics. Later that month, Bridges renewed his threat to publicize Hunt Jr.&#x27;s offense to Wyoming voters. The Eisenhower administration, taking a different tack, offered Hunt a high-paying position on the U.S. Tariff Commission if he agreed never to run for the Senate again. On June 8, following a medical examination at Bethesda Naval Hospital, Hunt changed his mind about running again, and wrote to the chair of the Wyoming Democratic party, citing health concerns as the reason: &quot;I shall never again be a candidate for an elective office.&quot; He did not, however, resign from the Senate.

On June 19, 1954, Hunt shot himself at his desk in his Senate office, using a .22 caliber rifle he apparently brought from home. He was taken to Casualty Hospital, where he died a few hours later at age 61. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that he acted &quot;in apparent despondency over his health&quot; and left four sealed notes.

Just one day before Hunt&#x27;s suicide, McCarthy had accused an unnamed member of the Senate of &quot;just plain wrong doing&quot;. After Hunt&#x27;s suicide, McCarthy&#x27;s ally Senator Karl Mundt of South Dakota denied that McCarthy was referring to Hunt.

===Aftermath===
The day after Hunt&#x27;s suicide, Pearson published his charges about how Republican Senators had threatened Hunt, but described Hunt&#x27;s motives as complex:

In private, he confirmed that Hunt had no serious health problem and wrote in his diary that &quot;Unfortunately I am afraid that the morals charge against his son and the experience Hunt suffered was the main factor.&quot;

Hunt was buried on June 22 in Cheyenne at Beth El Cemetery following a brief church service. At the time of his death, Hunt was a major in the Army Reserve Corps.

On June 24, acting Wyoming Governor C.J. Rogers appointed Republican Edward D. Crippa to fill the remainder of Hunt&#x27;s Senate term, which expired in January. On July 4, the conservative &quot;Washington Times-Herald&quot; reported Buddy Hunt&#x27;s arrest and conviction from the previous year, with Hunt&#x27;s death giving the story wider circulation than it had previously received.

On July 9, Blick signed an affidavit exonerating Bridges and Welker of pressuring him, but his decision to prosecute Buddy Hunt under circumstances which did not normally warrant prosecution remained unexplained. On November 9, the Senate eulogized its members who had died recently and Bridges called Hunt &quot;a man who demonstrated the best qualities of an American. He was loyal and he served well&quot;. Hunt&#x27;s cousin, William M. Spencer, president of the North American Car Corporation in Chicago, wrote Welker after learning he had eulogized Hunt:
Democrat Joseph C. O&#x27;Mahoney won Hunt&#x27;s Senate seat in the election on November 2, defeating the Republican nominee, Congressman William Henry Harrison III.

Buddy Hunt later worked on the staff of Catholic Charities in Chicago and then for the Industrial Areas Foundation of Chicago. With his co-worker there, Nicholas von Hoffman, he co-authored a paper, &quot;The Meanings of &#x27;Democracy&#x27;: Puerto Rican Organizations in Chicago&quot;, that appeared in &quot;ETC: A Review of General Semantics&quot;, an academic journal of linguistics in 1956. In October 2015, Buddy completed his first on-camera interview about his arrest and his father&#x27;s suicide, for the Yahoo News documentary “Uniquely Nasty: The U.S. Government’s War on Gays.” Buddy Hunt died in Chicago on January 6, 2020, at the age of 92.

==Later references==
Allen Drury, a journalist who covered the U.S. Senate for United Press International, used Hunt&#x27;s blackmail and suicide as the basis for his 1959 best-selling and Pulitzer Prize–winning novel &quot;Advise and Consent&quot;. In the novel, Senator Fred Van Ackerman from Wyoming uses a homosexual affair to blackmail Utah Senator Brigham Anderson. In 1962, the novel was made into a movie starring Henry Fonda and directed by Otto Preminger.

University of Wyoming historian T.A. Larson, author of a history of the state, wrote an account of Hunt&#x27;s suicide and submitted it to Hunt&#x27;s widow Nathelle, seeking her permission to publish it. Instead she threatened him with a lawsuit and he never published the results of his research.

Hunt&#x27;s anti-McCarthyism and his son&#x27;s arrest appear in fictionalized form in Thomas Mallon&#x27;s &quot;Fellow Travelers&quot; (2007), a novel that describes a young man&#x27;s introduction to hardball Washington politics in the 1950s as he discovers his gay identity. It is included as well in the 2023 television miniseries based on the novel.

In 2013, at a mock trial of Hunt&#x27;s Senate colleagues McCarthy, Welker, and Bridges, all three were &quot;found guilty of a variety of charges, including blackmail and causing bodily injury&quot;. Former Wyoming Governor Dave Freudenthal, who played the prosecuting attorney in the Cheyenne event, said: &quot;This particular part of Wyoming history had been swept under the rug. So I&#x27;m really delighted to participate in drawing attention to it.&quot; The event was organized to coincide with the publication of a new study of Hunt&#x27;s death, &quot;Dying for Joe McCarthy&#x27;s Sins&quot; by Rodger McDaniel, a Presbyterian pastor, former Wyoming legislator (1971–1981), and Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in 1982. He used some of Larson&#x27;s research.

<text>Kamarupi Prakrit is the postulated Middle Indo-Aryan (MIA) Prakrit language used in ancient Kamarupa (11th–13th century). This language has been derived from Gauda-Kamarupi Prakrit and the historical ancestor of the Kamatapuri lects and the modern Assamese language; and can be dated prior to 1250 CE, when the proto-Kamta language, the parent of the Kamatapuri lects, began to develop. Though not substantially proven, the existence of the language that predated the Kamatapuri lects and modern Assamese is widely believed to be descended from it.

The evidence of this MIA exist in systematic errors in the Sanskrit language used in the Kamarupa inscriptions. A distinguishing characteristic of Kamarupa inscriptions is the replacement of &quot;ś&quot; and &quot;ṣ&quot; by &quot;s&quot;, which is contrary to Vararuci&#x27;s rule, the main characteristic of Magadhi Prakrit, which warrants that &quot;ṣ&quot; and &quot;s&quot; are replaced by &quot;ś&quot;. Linguists claim this apabhramsa gave rise to various eastern Indo-European languages like modern Assamese and felt its presence in the form of Kamrupi and Kamatapuri lects.

==Etymology of various names==
The speech is known by different names, which generally consists of two words — prefix such as &#x27;Kamrupi&#x27;, &#x27;Kamarupi&#x27;, &#x27;Kamarupa&#x27; referring to Kamarupa and suffixes &#x27;dialect&#x27;, &#x27;Apabhramsa&#x27;, sometimes &#x27;Prakrit&#x27;. 
Suniti Kumar Chatterji named it as &quot;Kamarupa dialect&quot; (the dialect of Magadhi) as spoken in Kamarupa.
Sukumar Sen and others calls it as &quot;old Kamrupi dialect&quot;; the speech used in old Kamrup
Some scholars termed it as Kamrupi Apabhramsa, Kamarupi language or proto-Kamrupa.

==Characteristics==

Though the epigraphs were written in classical Sanskrit in kavya style of a high degree, they abound in forms varying from the standard.

* Loss of repha and reduplication of the remaining concerned consonants.
* Shortening of vowels.
* Lengthening of vowels.
* Substitution of one vowel for another.
* Avoidance and irregularity of sandhis.
* Loss of initial vowel.
* Substitution of Y by i.
* Total loss of medial Y.
* Reduplication of consonants immediately followed by r.
* Absence of duplication where it is otherwise necessary.
* Varieties of assimilation.
* Wrong analogy.
* Varied substitution for m and final m.
* Substitution of h by gh and substitution of bh by h.
* Indiscriminate substitution of one sibilant for another.
* Irregularity of declension in case of stems ending in consonants.
* Absence of visarga even where it is invariably necessary.

==Apabhramsa==
Some linguists claim that there existed a Kamrupi apabhramsa as opposed to the Magadhi apabhramsa from which the three cognate languages---Assamese, Bengali and Odia---sprouted. The initial motive comes from extra-linguistic considerations. Kamarupa was the most powerful and formidable kingdom in the region which provided the political and cultural influence for the development of the Kamrupi apabhramsa.

Xuanzang (or Hiuen Tsang), when he visited Kamarupa in 643 CE mentioned that the language spoken in Kamarupa was a &#x27;little different&#x27; from the one spoken in mid-India is provided as evidence that this apabhramsa existed as early as the 5th century.

==Geographical vicinity==
Assamese, or more appropriately the old Kamarupi dialect entered into Kamrup or western Assam, where this speech was first characterized as Assamese. 
Golockchandra Goswami in his An introduction to Assamese phonology writes, &quot;in early Assamese there seems to be one dominant dialect prevailing over the whole country, the Western Assamese dialect.&quot;
Similarly Upendranath Goswami says, &quot;Assamese entered into Kamarupa or western Assam where this speech was first characterised as Assamese. This is evident from the remarks of Hiuen Tsang who visited the Kingdom of Kamarupa in the first half of the seventh century A.D., during the reign of Bhaskaravarman&quot;

==Works==
The sample of the old Kamrupi dialect are found in different inscriptions scattered around eastern and northern India, such as Bhaskar Varman&#x27;s inscriptions. Daka, a native of Lehidangara village of Barpeta composed an authoritative work named Dakabhanita in the 8th century A.D.

<doc id="1287524" wikidata="Q342790" url="?curid=1287524" title="Acrolein">
<text>Acrolein (systematic name: propenal) is the simplest unsaturated aldehyde. It is a colorless liquid with a foul and acrid aroma. The smell of burnt fat (as when cooking oil is heated to its smoke point) is caused by glycerol in the burning fat breaking down into acrolein. It is produced industrially from propene and mainly used as a biocide and a building block to other chemical compounds, such as the amino acid methionine.

==History==
Acrolein was first named and characterized as an aldehyde by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius in 1839. He had been working with it as a thermal degradation product of glycerol, a material used in the manufacture of soap. The name is a contraction of &#x27;acrid&#x27; (referring to its pungent smell) and &#x27;oleum&#x27; (referring to its oil-like consistency). In the 20th century, acrolein became an important intermediate for the industrial production of acrylic acid and acrylic plastics.

==Production==
Acrolein is prepared industrially by oxidation of propene. The process uses air as the source of oxygen and requires metal oxides as heterogeneous catalysts:
About 500,000 tons of acrolein are produced in this way annually in North America, Europe, and Japan. Additionally, all acrylic acid is produced via the transient formation of acrolein.

Propane represents a promising but challenging feedstock for the synthesis of acrolein (and acrylic acid).The main challenge is in fact the overoxidation to this acid.

When glycerol (also called glycerin) is heated to 280 °C, it decomposes into acrolein:
:(CH2OH)2CHOH → CH2=CHCHO + 2 H2O
This route is attractive when glycerol is co-generated in the production of biodiesel from vegetable oils or animal fats. The dehydration of glycerol has been demonstrated but has not proven competitive with the route from petrochemicals.

===Niche or laboratory methods===
The original industrial route to acrolein, developed by Degussa, involves aldol condensation of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde:
:HCHO + CH3CHO → CH2=CHCHO + H2O
Acrolein may also be produced on lab scale by the action of potassium bisulfate on glycerol (glycerine).

==Reactions==
Acrolein is a relatively electrophilic compound and a reactive one, hence its high toxicity. It is a good Michael acceptor, hence its useful reaction with thiols. It forms acetals readily, a prominent one being the spirocycle derived from pentaerythritol, diallylidene pentaerythritol. Acrolein participates in many Diels-Alder reactions, even with itself. Via Diels-Alder reactions, it is a precursor to some commercial fragrances, including myrac aldehyde (&quot;lyral&quot;) and norbornene-2-carboxaldehyde. The monomer 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3&#x27;,4&#x27;-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate is also produced from acrolein via the intermediacy of tetrahydrobenzaldehyde.

==Uses==
===Military uses===
Acrolein was used in warfare due to its irritant and blistering properties. The French used the chemical in their hand grenades and artillery shells during World War I under the name &quot;Papite&quot;.

===Biocide===
Acrolein is mainly used as a contact herbicide to control submersed and floating weeds, as well as algae, in irrigation canals. It is used at a level of 10 ppm in irrigation and recirculating waters. In the oil and gas industry, it is used as a biocide in drilling waters, as well as a scavenger for hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans.

===Chemical precursor===
A number of useful compounds are made from acrolein, exploiting its bifunctionality. The amino acid methionine is produced by addition of methanethiol followed by the Strecker synthesis. Acrolein condenses with acetaldehyde and amines to give methylpyridines. It is also an intermediate in the Skraup synthesis of quinolines.

Acrolein will polymerize in the presence of oxygen and in water at concentrations above 22%. The color and texture of the polymer depends on the conditions. The polymer is a clear, yellow solid. In water, it will form a hard, porous plastic.

Acrolein has been used as a fixative in preparation of biological specimens for electron microscopy.

==Health risks==
Acrolein is toxic and is a strong irritant for the skin, eyes, and nasal passages. The main metabolic pathway for acrolein is the alkylation of glutathione. The WHO suggests a &quot;tolerable oral acrolein intake&quot; of 7.5 μg per day per kg of body weight. Although acrolein occurs in French fries (and other fried foods), the levels are only a few μg per kg. In response to occupational exposures to acrolein, the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set a permissible exposure limit at 0.1 ppm (0.25 mg/m3) at an eight-hour time-weighted average. Acrolein acts in an immunosuppressive manner and may promote regulatory cells, thereby preventing the generation of allergies on the one hand, but also increasing the risk of cancer.

Acrolein was identified as one of the chemicals involved in the 2019 Kim Kim River toxic pollution incident.

===Cigarette smoke===
Connections exist between acrolein gas in the smoke from tobacco cigarettes and the risk of lung cancer. Acrolein is one of seven toxicants in cigarette smoke that are most associated with respiratory tract carcinogenesis. The mechanism of action of acrolein appears to involve induction of increased reactive oxygen species and DNA damage related to oxidative stress.

In terms of the &quot;noncarcinogenic health quotient&quot; for components in cigarette smoke, acrolein dominates, contributing 40 times more than the next component, hydrogen cyanide. The acrolein content in cigarette smoke depends on the type of cigarette and added glycerin, making up to 220 μg acrolein per cigarette. Importantly, while the concentration of the constituents in mainstream smoke can be reduced by filters, this has no significant effect on the composition of the side-stream smoke where acrolein usually resides, and which is inhaled by passive smoking. E-cigarettes, used normally, only generate &quot;negligible&quot; levels of acrolein (less than 10 μg &quot;per puff&quot;).

===Chemotherapy metabolite===
Cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide treatment results in the production of acrolein. Acrolein produced during cyclophosphamide treatment collects in the urinary bladder and if untreated can cause hemorrhagic cystitis.

=== Endogenous production ===
Acrolein is a component of reuterin. Reuterin can be produced by gut microbes when glycerol is present. Microbe-produced reuterin is a potential resource of acrolein.

==Analytical methods==
The &quot;acrolein test&quot; is for the presence of glycerin or fats. A sample is heated with potassium bisulfate, and acrolein is released if the test is positive. When a fat is heated strongly in the presence of a dehydrating agent such as potassium bisulfate (), the glycerol portion of the molecule is dehydrated to form the unsaturated aldehyde, acrolein (CH2=CH–CHO), which has the odor peculiar to burnt cooking grease. More modern methods exist.

In the US, EPA methods 603 and 624.1 are designed to measure acrolein in industrial and municipal wastewater streams.

<text>Xiamen Airlines ( ) (branded as XiamenAir), is an airline based in Xiamen, Fujian, China. XiamenAir has its northern headquarters in Beijing and eight branches in Fuzhou, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Hunan, Beijing, Quanzhou, Chongqing and Shanghai, and two subsidiaries in Hebei Airlines (99.47% shareholding) and Jiangxi Airlines (60% shareholding, based on the former Xiamen Airlines Nanchang Branch). Founded on July 25, 1984, XiamenAir is the first airline in China to operate independently as an enterprise. It was established as a joint venture between the Shanghai Administration of Civil Aviation Administration of China, Xiamen Special Economic Zone Construction Development Company (now Xiamen C&amp;D Group) and Fujian Investment Enterprise Company. The shareholders are China Southern Airlines Corporation (55%), Xiamen C&amp;D Group (34%) and Fujian Investment and Development Group (11%). The current chairman of XiamenAir is Zhao Dong and the general manager is Wang Zhixue.

XiamenAir operates more than 320 domestic and international routes from Xiamen Gaoqi International Airport, Beijing Daxing International Airport, Fuzhou Changle International Airport and Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport, with 3,500 to 4,000 flights per week and carries nearly 25 million passengers per year. XiamenAir&#x27;s logo is &quot;A Heron Flying High&quot;, a well-known trademark in China, and its frequent flyer program is the Xiamen Airlines White Egret Frequent Flyer Program. The airline features in-flight announcements in Mandarin and English, but also in Minnan, which are broadcast by Xia Hui, a former broadcaster for the Central People&#x27;s Radio station and Xiamen Broadcasting Company.

XiamenAir is the 19th member of the international airline alliance SkyTeam and the first airline in mainland China to join one of the world&#x27;s three major airline alliances other than the three major state-owned airlines (including China Southern, which withdrew from SkyTeam on January 1, 2019) and Shanghai Airlines, which joined the alliance as an affiliate member, and the fourth full member of SkyTeam in Greater China (the first three being China Southern, China Eastern, and China Airlines, of which China Southern withdrew from the alliance on January 1, 2019).
==History==

=== Xiamen Civil Aviation ===
The history of Xiamen&#x27;s aviation industry can be traced back to the Xiamen Wutong Civil Aviation Academy in 1928, which was one of the only three aviation academies in the Republic of China at that time.

In 1929, the Zhangxia Navy established the Zengcuo Aun Naval Airport in Xiamen, and in 1932, the China Airlines Xiamen Office, a joint venture between China and the United States, operated air transportation to various places. Later, the airport was abandoned due to the Japanese invasion of China.

In 1941, during the Second World War, the Japanese who occupied Xiamen built Gaoqi Airport in the east of Gaoqi Village for both military and civilian use. From December 5 of the same year, first commercial flight between Xiamen and Taipei took off and landed at Gaoqi Airport.

After Japan&#x27;s defeat and surrender, Gaoqi Airport was taken over by the Nationalist government and converted to a civilian airport on November 1, 1947. On August 24, 1949, the last scheduled Xiamen to Taipei flight took off from Gaoqi Airport to Taipei and then was discontinued (the route was not converted to a regular service until 2006, when holiday charters resumed, and after December 2008). For the next 33 years, Xiamen&#x27;s aviation industry was disrupted and Gaoqi Airport was abandoned after a brief period of military use.

After the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Xiamen was in a state of war for a long time and had no civil aviation airport of its own because of its location on the front of the Taiwan Strait. At that time, the citizens of Xiamen could only travel by boat or train. This contradiction was even more prominent after the establishment of Xiamen Special Economic Zone. On January 10, 1982, the Central Military Commission and the State Council approved the construction of Xiamen Gaoqi Airport. In October of the following year.

However, the airport had no airline that operated as a hub, and still could not solve the issue of lack of capacity. At the opening ceremony of Xiamen Airport, Zhang Ru, Vice Governor of Fujian Province Government, proposed to Shen Tu, Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), who attended the opening ceremony, that the CAAC and Fujian Province cooperate to establish an airline company, and received support on the spot. Immediately afterwards, the CPC Fujian Provincial Committee assigned Vice Governor Zhang Ru and Vice Mayor of Xiamen City Xiang Zhen to work with Director Wang Dao of the Planning Department of CAAC to study the establishment of an airline company.

=== Founding ===
On October 16, 1983, the chairman of Aloha Airlines, Chen Qing who is a Chinese American, visited Xiamen to study the plan of establishing a Sino-foreign joint venture airline in Xiamen. Wu Zhongliang, who was involved in the establishment of Xiamen Airlines at that time, recalled that Aloha Airlines even had the intention of moving its base to Xiamen at that time.

On January 10, 1984, the Xiamen Municipal Government drafted the &quot;Conceptual Plan and Opinions on Sino-foreign Joint Venture to Operate China Xiamen Special Zone United Airlines Co. Ltd.&quot; On January 25, representatives from Fujian Province and Xiamen City went to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) for project report, mentioning that priority would be given to joint undertakings by CAAC and Fujian Province as long as aircraft and funds were guaranteed. Subsequently, the CAAC, Fujian Province and Xiamen City held a special meeting on the proposed joint venture airline proposal, and finally rejected the joint venture airline proposal drawn up by the Xiamen City Government on the basis of air rights and other issues.

On March 2, 1984, the Civil Aviation Administration of China and Fujian Provincial Government jointly issued the &quot;Approval of Agreement on Joint Venture Operation of Xiamen Airlines Co. Ltd. Xiamen Air Co. Ltd was officially established on July 25, 1984, as the first comprehensive local airline company and the first joint venture between the central and local governments. Gaoqi Airport have being chosen for the base of this new funded airline.

At the early years of the airline, Xiamen Airlines set itself as a regional airline, but the investment of 20 million RMB from the three shareholders was not available at the beginning of its establishment, and it only registered with a bank account with 5,000 RMB, without any aircraft and livery.

On January 5, 1985, 9:55 a.m., a wet-lease Boeing 737 airliner of Xiamen Airlines landed safely at Beijing Capital Airport at 12:27 p.m. after 2 hours and 32 minutes of flight time, which was the first route opened by Xiamen Airlines. In the afternoon, the company&#x27;s second route, Xiamen-Guangzhou, was also officially opened, with the participation of Jiang Ping, vice mayor of Xiamen, and leaders of Xiamen Airlines, etc. On January 10, the company opened its third route, Xiamen-Shanghai. In these routes, the aircraft of Civil Aviation Administration of Shanghai operates Shanghai-Xiamen and Xiamen-Guangzhou routes once per week; the aircraft of Civil Aviation Administration of Guangzhou (the predecessor of China Southern Airlines) operates Guangzhou-Xiamen, Xiamen-Beijing routes and Xiamen-Hong Kong charter flights once per week. On February 12, 1985, Xiamen Airlines leased its first 737-200 aircraft, and on December 18, 1985, the third meeting of the first board of directors and the first meeting of the second board of directors of Xiamen Airlines decided to transfer the shares of the Civil Aviation Administration of Shanghai for Xiamen Airlines to the Civil Aviation Administration of Guangzhou, with the same ratio of capital contribution from each party. The agreement of joint venture operation of Xiamen Airlines by the three shareholders and the articles of association of Xiamen Airlines were amended and submitted for approval and became effective on January 1, 1986. On November 16, the first 737-200 aircraft was transferred from Guangzhou to Xiamen as the base of Xiamen Airlines. In November 1987, Xiamen Airlines introduced the second 737-200 aircraft, and in this year, Xiamen Airlines reversed the operating loss of the first three years and made a profit of 3.17 million RMB for the first time.

=== Expansion ===

Xiamen Airlines has made innovative breakthroughs in corporate organization, operation and management, and transportation services. At the time of its establishment, Xiamen Airlines was positioned as an independently accounted, self-financing limited liability company. In 1989, reforms were made to the organization, personnel management, labor distribution, housing system, medical insurance, employee benefits, etc. In 1997, the contract system for employees was implemented.

On November 16, 1986, the first aircraft of Xiamen Airlines was transferred from Guangzhou to Xiamen to start its operation. In the same year, Xiamen Airlines bid farewell to its losses and opened the curtain on 27 years of continuous profitability. On August 8, 1988, Xiamen Airlines took over the ownership of its first new passenger aircraft from Boeing (Xiamen Airlines had previously operated old aircraft sold to Xiamen Airlines by China Southern Airlines and Southwest Airlines). The aircraft was a Boeing 737-25C Advanced (registration number B-2524), the last Boeing 737 classic airliner produced by Boeing Civil Aircraft. The aircraft was retired from service in 2003 and resold to Blue Dart Express.

In 1991, the General Administration of Civil Aviation (GACA) approved Xiamen Airlines to adopt &quot;Blue Sky and White Heron&quot; as its corporate logo. In the same year, the Civil Aviation Administration separated the government and enterprises and established China Southern Airlines, and the shares held by the Civil Aviation Guangzhou Administration were transferred to China Southern Airlines.

On August 12, 1992, Xiamen Airlines took delivery of its first Boeing 757-200 aircraft, registered as B-2819, which was also the 100th aircraft delivered to the Chinese civil aviation system by Boeing. This aircraft was retired in 2008 and sold to Blue Dart Aviation who converted the aircraft to a cargo plane.

In 2000, Xiamen Airlines launched the service between Xiamen and Bangkok, which was the first international service of Xiamen Airlines and operated as MF897/8.On July 25, 2012, Xiamen Airlines changed its VI logo for the first time from &quot;Blue Sky with White Heron&quot; to &quot;One Heron Flying High&quot; and the aircraft painting theme was changed from &quot;Reform Music&quot; to &quot;Sea and Sky&quot;. The theme of the aircraft painting was changed from &quot;Reform Music&quot; to &quot;Sea and Sky&quot;. To upgrade the logo of Xiamen Airlines, the Chinese design master Chen Youjian and TEAGUE, the design team appointed by Boeing, were invited to design, revise and prove the new corporate logo, hence the rebranding to XiamenAir.

On December 1, 2018, XiamenAir&#x27;s last Boeing 757 (No. B-2868) was retired after its last flight from Shanghai Hongqiao-Xiamen, and since then there have been no Boeing 757 passenger aircraft in Greater China.

As China&#x27;s aviation sector developed, the airline expanded to regional Asian destinations while the delivery of wide-body Boeing 787 Dreamliners permitted the airline to offer long-distance services. The airline&#x27;s first intercontinental expansion was to Europe, which commenced with an Amsterdam service from July 26, 2015, and a Paris service from December 11, 2018. Services to Sydney followed from November 30, 2015, and Melbourne a year later. The airline&#x27;s first North American service, to Vancouver, was launched on July 26, 2016. XiamenAir&#x27;s first US service was to Seattle, followed by Los Angeles and then New York.

By early 2020, the airline had set up bases at Fuzhou Changle International Airport, Nanchang Changbei International Airport, Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport, Tianjin Binhai International Airport, Changsha Huanghua International Airport, Beijing Daxing International Airport (moved from Beijing Capital International Airport in 2020), Quanzhou Jinjiang International Airport, Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport and Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport.

On November 17 of the same year, SkyTeam officially announced the details of XiamenAir&#x27;s membership in the alliance and signed a letter of intent to join the alliance in Rome, Italy. On November 21, 2012, XiamenAir officially became the 19th member of SkyTeam and added three new hubs to the alliance—Xiamen, Fuzhou and Hangzhou—making it the first airline in China to join one of the three global airline alliances, in addition to the three major state-owned airlines (of which China Southern, the parent company of XiamenAir, withdrew from SkyTeam on January 1, 2019) and Shanghai Airlines, which joined the alliance as a subsidiary member.

<text>The Blauzes are two small New York City islands in City Island Harbor which are part of a reef extending 600 yards northwest of the northern tip of Hart Island. They are composed of Manhattan schist bedrock with a slightly bluish tint and are semi-hemispherical in shape.

The Blauzes is derived from &quot;Little Blue Ones&quot; in Dutch. The name comes from the Belgian Huguenots, who were the first Europeans to settle the area. They are jokingly referred to by local residents as the Blue Breasts because their odd shape resembles that of a voluptuous woman&#x27;s bosom. 

The pair are part of the Pelham Islands.

<doc id="1287548" wikidata="Q513788" url="?curid=1287548" title="Quadra Island">
<text>Quadra Island is a large island off the eastern coast of Vancouver Island, in British Columbia, Canada. It is part of the Discovery Islands, in the Strathcona Regional District.

==Etymology==
In 1903, the island was named after the Peruvian Spanish navigator Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra, who explored and settled the Vancouver Island area in the late 18th century.

==History==
The island was claimed by the Peruvian Spanish navigator Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra for the Spanish Empire in the 1700s. A settlement was not successfully negotiated and ownership of the island remained in dispute between Britain and Spain in the early 1790s. The two countries nearly began a war over the issue; the confrontation became known as the Nootka Crisis. That was averted when both agreed to recognize the other&#x27;s rights to the area in the first Nootka Convention in 1790, a first step to peace. Finally, the two countries signed the second Nootka Convention in 1793 and the third Convention in 1794. As per the final treaty, the Spanish dismantled their fort on Vancouver Island and left the area after both countries agreed that no permanent settlements should be established in the area neither by Spain nor by Britain, while rights of trade and shipping were to be shared by the two powers.

In 1846, the Oregon Treaty was signed by the British and the U.S. to settle the question of the U.S. Oregon Territory borders. The Treaty made the 49th parallel latitude north the official border between the two countries. In order to ensure that Britain retained all of Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands, it was agreed that the border would swing south around that area.

The Coast Salish inhabited Quadra Island when Captain George Vancouver visited and wrote about their village at Cape Mudge in 1792; he described long houses, boats and a population of roughly 300 people. The Salish were driven out by other First Nations in the late 1800s.

B.C. historian Jeanette Taylor states that &quot;the We-Wai-Kai, with roots to the north among the Kwakwaka’wakw, took over the island through a complex process of both warfare and intermarriage&quot;. They fished for salmon year-round. The We-Wai-Kai band of the Kwagiulth live in Cape Mudge today. According to the historian, they &quot;were prohibited from buying alcohol and barred by the government from the mechanized fishing fleet until 1926. Even their ceremonial gatherings – potlatches – were made illegal&quot;. In 1922, after mass arrests, the We-Wai-Kai people surrendered their masks and regalia to the government. The property was not returned to them for some 50 years, to the Nuuyumbalees Cultural Centre.

The first school was built by the Kwagiulth people at Cape Mudge in 1893; the fishing fleet in operation at that time is still successful today. A copper and gold mine, the Lucky Jim, opened in 1903 but was destroyed by fire in 1941. In 1904, the island had &quot;two post offices, a school, hotel, lumber camps, mills, and a mission&quot;, according to one report. A passenger ferry commenced service in 1949 and a ferry for vehicles started in 1960.

By 1904, Quadra had two post offices, a school, hotel, lumber camps, mills, and a mission. Severe fires devastated Quadra over the years leading to a poor economy well into the 1930s.

==Geography==
Quadra Island is separated from Vancouver Island by Discovery Passage, and from Cortes Island by Read Island and the Sutil Channel, and is linked to that island by a ferry from Heriot Bay on its eastern shore. The island has many beaches, trails, lakes, and parks. Main Lake Provincial Park is located on the northern part of the island, and Rebecca Spit Marine Provincial Park is on the eastern shore, near Heriot Bay.

Quadra Island is about from its northernmost point to its southernmost point. The island at its narrowest point, on its southern peninsula, is less than wide, and at its widest point, about wide. With an area of , Quadra Island is the largest island of the Discovery Islands and the second largest island in the Salish Sea after Whidbey Island in Washington.

===Geology===
Few of the island&#x27;s soils are well suited to agriculture. Most are coarse and, outside of poorly drained areas, have classic podzol profile development; well-drained podzols are mapped as Kye loamy sand and Quinsam gravelly sandy loam. A small area of dark well-drained unpodzolized soil (Lazo loamy sand) is mapped around the southeast corner. Dashwood gravelly loamy sand, a brown podzolic trending to podzol, is commonly associated with Kye and Quinsam. Imperfectly drained areas have brown podzolic Bowser loamy sand or classic podzol Sayward loamy sand. The more moist Custer loamy sand, a groundwater podzol, is present locally. Poorly drained areas have Arrowsmith peat, Parksville sandy loam, or Tolmie loam (the latter two are gleysols).
In spite of this, many residents have very successful home gardens, and the island boasts a well attended Garden Club and a bi-annual Quilt and Garden Tour.

==Demographics==
The population of island and surrounding mainland inlets, as of the 2006 federal census (excluding First Nations Reserves, tallied separately), was 2,472, down from the 2001 federal census count of 2,548. A more recent report (2017) suggest an estimated population of 4,000, with most at the southern end of the island, and states that many are &quot;involved in the arts, fishing, logging, and tourism&quot;.

The Cape Mudge Reserve on the southern tip of the island is home to the We-wai-kai, one of the main bands comprising the Southern Kwakiutl (the other being the We-wai-kum nation|We-wai-kum based in Campbell River on Vancouver Island). Together they are known as the Laich-kwil-tach (historically known as the Euclataws or Yucultas, names more familiar to speakers of British Columbia English).

===Education===
There is an elementary school on the island. School children in grades 6-12 travel by ferry to Campbell River to attend École Phoenix Middle School or Carihi Secondary School. These schools are part of School District 72 Campbell River.

==Culture==

The Nuyumabalees Cultural Centre is located within the Cape Mudge Village. The Centre opened in 1987 to hold the &quot;Sacred Potlatch Collection&quot; which was returned by the Federal Government. The Centre continues its efforts in &quot;researching, locating and repatriating potlatch artifacts&quot; from other sources around the world, according to a local report.

The Southern Kwakiutl (part of the larger Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw ethnic grouping) migrated into the northern Georgia Strait from Queen Charlotte Strait over two centuries ago, displacing and absorbing the Comox and Pentlatch peoples who lived there.

A recent report about Cape Mudge Village (Yaculta) states that &quot;the territory of the Kwa&#x27;Kwa&#x27;Ka&#x27; Wa&#x27;Kw Nation includes territory between a line running from Cape Mudge, Quadra Island to the mouth of Bute Inlet northward to Smith Inlet and around Vancouver Island to Quatsino Sound&quot;. The report adds that today, the We Wai Kai band of the Laichwiltach People &quot;are a prosperous people involved with several major concerns in nearby Campbell River and on Quadra Island ... [they operate] a full service resort Tsa-Kwa-Luten Lodge &amp; RV Park&quot;. The other two main villages are Quathiaski Cove, the island&#x27;s commercial hub, and Heriot Bay a picturesque community.

==Transportation==

The BC Ferry terminal is located at Quathiaski Cove on the island, connecting to Campbell River on Vancouver Island. Each day, the ferry makes 18 round trips. Taxi service is available on the island. Flights from Vancouver stop at Campbell River and District Airport (YBL).

Many services are available at nearby Campbell River but Quadra has some too, according to the Discovery Island publication: a bank, ATMs, auto and marine repair services, a gas station (without automotive diesel), marine gas and diesel, cafes, restaurants, library, medical clinic, pharmacy, book store, groceries, an elementary school, childcare, RCMP detachment, real estate agents, hardware store, adventure tour operators and more.

==Notable people==

<doc id="1287559" wikidata="Q839447" url="?curid=1287559" title="Privacy laws of the United States">
<text>Privacy laws of the United States deal with several different legal concepts. One is the &quot;invasion of privacy&quot;, a tort based in common law allowing an aggrieved party to bring a lawsuit against an individual who unlawfully intrudes into their private affairs, discloses their private information, publicizes them in a false light, or appropriates their name for personal gain.

The essence of the law derives from a &quot;right to privacy&quot;, defined broadly as &quot;the right to be let alone&quot;. It usually excludes personal matters or activities which may reasonably be of public interest, like those of celebrities or participants in newsworthy events. Invasion of the right to privacy can be the basis for a lawsuit for damages against the person or entity violating the right. These include the Fourth Amendment right to be free of unwarranted search or seizure, the First Amendment right to free assembly, and the Fourteenth Amendment due process right, recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States as protecting a general right to privacy within family, marriage, motherhood, procreation, and child rearing.

Attempts to improve consumer privacy protections in the U.S. in the wake of the 2017 Equifax data breach, which affected 145.5 million U.S. consumers, failed to pass in Congress.

==Right to privacy==
===Early years===
The early years in the development of privacy rights began with English common law, protecting &quot;only the physical interference of life and property&quot;. The Castle doctrine analogizes a person&#x27;s home to their castle – a site that is private and should not be accessible without permission of the owner. The development of tort remedies by the common law is &quot;one of the most significant chapters in the history of privacy law&quot;. Those rights expanded to include a &quot;recognition of man&#x27;s spiritual nature, of his feelings and his intellect.&quot; Eventually, the scope of those rights broadened even further to include a basic &quot;right to be let alone,&quot; and the former definition of &quot;property&quot; would then comprise &quot;every form of possession – intangible, as well as tangible.&quot; By the late 19th century, interest in privacy grew as a result of the growth of print media, especially newspapers.

Between 1850 and 1890, U.S. newspaper circulation grew by 1,000 percentfrom 100 papers with 800,000 readers to 900 papers with more than 8 million readers. In addition, newspaper journalism became more sensationalized, and was termed yellow journalism. The growth of industrialism led to rapid advances in technology, including the handheld camera, as opposed to earlier studio cameras, which were much heavier and larger. In 1884, Eastman Kodak company introduced their Kodak Brownie, and it became a mass market camera by 1901, cheap enough for the general public. This allowed people and journalists to take candid snapshots in public places for the first time.

Privacy was dealt with at the state level. For example, &quot;Pavesich v. New England Life Insurance Company&quot; (in 1905) was one of the first specific endorsements of the right to privacy as derived from natural law in US law. Judith Wagner DeCew stated, &quot;&quot;Pavesich&quot; was the first case to recognize privacy as a right in tort law by invoking natural law, common law, and constitutional values.&quot;

Samuel D. Warren and Louis D. Brandeis, partners in a new law firm, feared that this new small camera technology would be used by the &quot;sensationalistic press.&quot; Seeing this becoming a likely challenge to individual privacy rights, they wrote the &quot;pathbreaking&quot; &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; article in 1890, &quot;The Right to Privacy&quot;. According to legal scholar Roscoe Pound, the article did &quot;nothing less than add a chapter to our law&quot;, and in 1966 legal textbook author, Harry Kalven, hailed it as the &quot;most influential law review article of all&quot;. In the Supreme Court case of &quot;Kyllo v. United States&quot;, 533 U.S. 27 (2001), the article was cited by a majority of justices, both those concurring and those dissenting.

===Brandeis and Warren article===
The development of the doctrine regarding the tort of &quot;invasion of privacy&quot; was largely spurred by the Warren and Brandeis article, &quot;The Right to Privacy&quot;. In it, they explain why they wrote the article in its introduction: &quot;Political, social, and economic changes entail the recognition of new rights, and the common law, in its eternal youth, grows to meet the demands of society&quot;. More specifically, they also shift their focus on newspapers:

The press is overstepping in every direction the obvious bounds of propriety and of decency. Gossip is no longer the resource of the idle and of the vicious, but has become a trade, which is pursued with industry as well as effrontery. To satisfy a prurient taste the details of sexual relations are spread broadcast in the columns of the daily papers. ... The intensity and complexity of life, attendant upon advancing civilization, have rendered necessary some retreat from the world, and man, under the refining influence of culture, has become more sensitive to publicity, so that solitude and privacy have become more essential to the individual; but modern enterprise and invention have, through invasions upon his privacy, subjected him to mental pain and distress, far greater than could be inflicted by mere bodily injury.

They then clarify their goals: &quot;It is our purpose to consider whether the existing law affords a principle which can properly be invoked to protect the privacy of the individual; and, if it does, what the nature and extent of such protection is&quot;.

Warren and Brandeis write that privacy rights should protect both businesses and private individuals. They describe rights in trade secrets and unpublished literary materials, regardless whether those rights are invaded intentionally or unintentionally, and without regard to any value they may have. For private individuals, they try to define how to protect &quot;thoughts, sentiments, and emotions, expressed through the medium of writing or of the arts&quot;. They describe such things as personal diaries and letters needing protection, and how that should be done: &quot;Thus, the courts, in searching for some principle upon which the publication of private letters could be enjoined, naturally came upon the ideas of a breach of confidence, and of an implied contract&quot;. They also define this as a breach of trust, where a person has trusted that another will not publish their personal writings, photographs, or artwork, without their permission, including any &quot;facts relating to his private life, which he has seen fit to keep private&quot;. And recognizing that technological advances will become more relevant, they write: &quot;Now that modern devices afford abundant opportunities for the perpetration of such wrongs without any participation by the injured party, the protection granted by the law must be placed upon a broader foundation&quot;.

There have been many laws related to privacy and data protection in recent years that have been enforced as a result of the rapid technological advancements. However, critics and scholars have argued that these guidelines are usually focused on legal factors, rather than technical details, which make it difficult for engineers and developers to ensure that new designs meet the guidelines stated in privacy laws.

==Modern tort law==

In the United States,&quot;invasion of privacy&quot; is a commonly used cause of action in legal pleadings. Modern tort law, as first categorized by William Prosser, includes four categories of invasion of privacy:
* Intrusion of solitude: physical or electronic intrusion into one&#x27;s private quarters
* Public disclosure of private facts: the dissemination of truthful private information which a reasonable person would find objectionable
* False light: the publication of facts which place a person in a false light, even though the facts themselves may not be defamatory
* Appropriation: the unauthorized use of a person&#x27;s name or likeness to obtain some benefits

===Intrusion of solitude and seclusion===

Intrusion of solitude occurs where one person intrudes upon the private affairs of another. In a famous case from 1944, author Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings was sued by Zelma Cason, who was portrayed as a character in Rawlings&#x27; acclaimed memoir, &quot;Cross Creek&quot;. The Florida Supreme Court held that a cause of action for invasion of privacy was supported by the facts of the case, but in a later proceeding found that there were no actual damages.

Intrusion upon seclusion occurs when a perpetrator intentionally intrudes, physically, electronically, or otherwise, upon the private space, solitude, or seclusion of a person, or the private affairs or concerns of a person, by use of the perpetrator&#x27;s physical senses or by electronic device or devices to oversee or overhear the person&#x27;s private affairs, or by some other form of investigation, examination, or observation intrude upon a person&#x27;s private matters if the intrusion would be highly offensive to a reasonable person. Hacking into someone else&#x27;s computer is a type of intrusion upon privacy, as is secretly viewing or recording private information by still or video camera. In determining whether intrusion has occurred, one of three main considerations may be involved: expectation of privacy; whether there was an intrusion, invitation, or exceedance of invitation; or deception, misrepresentation, or fraud to gain admission. Intrusion is &quot;an information-gathering, not a publication, tort ... legal wrong occurs at the time of the intrusion. No publication is necessary&quot;.

Restrictions against the invasion of privacy encompasses journalists as well:

The First Amendment has never been construed to accord newsmen immunity from torts or crimes committed during the course of newsgathering. The First Amendment is not a license to trespass, to steal, or to intrude by electronic means into the precincts of another&#x27;s home or office.

===Public disclosure of private facts===

Public disclosure of private facts arises where one person reveals information which is not of public concern, and the release of which would offend a reasonable person.
&quot;Unlike libel or slander, truth is not a defense for invasion of privacy.&quot; Disclosure of private facts includes publishing or widespread dissemination of little-known, private facts that are non-newsworthy, not part of public records, public proceedings, not of public interest, and would be offensive to a reasonable person if made public.

===False light===

False light is a legal term that refers to a tort concerning privacy that is similar to the tort of defamation. For example, the privacy laws in the United States include a non-public person&#x27;s right to privacy from publicity which creates an untrue or misleading impression about them. A non-public person&#x27;s right to privacy from publicity is balanced against the First Amendment right of free speech.

False light laws are &quot;intended primarily to protect the plaintiff&#x27;s mental or emotional well-being&quot;. If a publication of information is false, then a tort of defamation might have occurred. If that communication is not technically false but is still misleading, then a tort of false light might have occurred.

The specific elements of the Tort of false light vary considerably even among those jurisdictions which do recognize this tort. Generally, these elements consist of the following:
* A publication by the defendant about the plaintiff;
* Made with actual malice (very similar to that type required by &quot;New York Times v. Sullivan&quot; in defamation cases);
* Places the plaintiff in a false light; and
* Highly offensive (i.e., embarrassing to reasonable persons)

Thus in general, the doctrine of false light holds:

One who gives publicity to a matter concerning another before the public in a false light is subject to liability to the other for invasion of privacy, if (a) the false light in which the other was placed would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and (b) the actor had knowledge of or acted in a reckless disregard as to the falsity of the publicized matter and the false light in which the other would be placed.

For this wrong, money damages may be recovered from the first person by the other.

At first glance, this may appear to be similar to defamation (libel and slander), but the basis for the harm is different, and the remedy is different in two respects. First, unlike libel and slander, no showing of actual harm or damage to the plaintiff is usually required in false light cases, and the court will determine the amount of damages. Second, being a violation of a Constitutional right of privacy, there may be no applicable statute of limitations in some jurisdictions specifying a time limit within which period a claim must be filed.

Consequently, although it is infrequently invoked, in some cases false light may be a more attractive cause of action for plaintiffs than libel or slander, because the burden of proof may be less onerous.

What does &quot;publicity&quot; mean? A newspaper of general circulation (or comparable breadth) or as few as 3–5 people who know the person harmed? Neither defamation nor false light has ever required everyone in society be informed by a harmful act, but the scope of &quot;publicity&quot; is variable. In some jurisdictions, publicity &quot;means that the matter is made public, by communicating it to the public at large, or to so many persons that the matter must be regarded as substantially certain to become one of public knowledge.&quot;

Moreover, the standards of behavior governing employees of government institutions subject to a state or national Administrative Procedure Act (as in the United States) are often more demanding than those governing employees of private or business institutions like newspapers. A person acting in an official capacity for a government agency may find that their statements are not indemnified by the principle of agency, leaving them personally liable for any damages.

Example: If someone&#x27;s reputation was portrayed in a false light during a personnel performance evaluation in a government agency or public university, one might be wronged if only a small number initially learned of it, or if adverse recommendations were made to only a few superiors (by a peer committee to department chair, dean, dean&#x27;s advisory committee, provost, president, etc.). Settled cases suggest false light may not be effective in private school personnel cases, but they may be distinguishable from cases arising in public institutions.

===Appropriation of name or likeness===
Although privacy is often a common-law tort, most states have enacted statutes that prohibit the use of a person&#x27;s name or image if used without consent for the commercial benefit of another person.

Appropriation of name or likeness occurs when a person uses the name or likeness of another person for personal gain or commercial advantage. Action for misappropriation of right of publicity protects a person against loss caused by appropriation of personal likeness for commercial exploitation. A person&#x27;s exclusive rights to control their name and likeness to prevent others from exploiting without permission is protected in similar manner to a trademark action with the person&#x27;s likeness, rather than the trademark, being the subject of the protection.

Appropriation is the oldest recognized form of invasion of privacy involving the use of an individual&#x27;s name, likeness, or identity without consent for purposes such as ads, fictional works, or products.

==Privacy law legislation==

=== Fair Credit Reporting Act ===
The Fair Credit Reporting Act became effective on April 25, 1971, and implemented limitations on the information that could be collected, stored, and utilized by agencies such as credit bureaus, tenant screenings, and health agencies. The law also defined the rights granted to individuals in regards to their financial information including the right to obtain a credit score; the right to know what information is in your financial file; the right to know when your information is being accessed and used; and the right to dispute any inaccurate or incorrect information.

=== Video Privacy Protection Act ===
The Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 (VPPA) was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan to preserve the privacy of people&#x27;s information collected when they rented, purchased, or delivered audio visual materials, and specifically videotapes. The law arose out of the Bork tapes controversy surrounding the Washington City Paper&#x27;s publication of a list of films rented by Robert Bork, a U.S. District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals Judge who had been nominated to fill a seat on the United States Supreme Court at the time. The law prohibits the disclosure of personal information collected by video tape service providers unless it falls under certain exceptions. The VPPA became a focus of attention in the legal industry once again around 2022. Its revival came as part of a larger trend in consumer class actions filed based on privacy law violations, both through new laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act and older laws like the VPPA and wiretapping statutes.

=== Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ===
Signed in law on August 21, 1996, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a piece of legislation passed in the United States that limits the amount and types of information that can be collected and stored by healthcare providers. This includes limits on how that information can be obtained, stored, and released. HIPAA also developed data confidentiality requirements that are a part of &quot;The Privacy Rule.&quot;

=== Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ===
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLA) is a federal law that was signed into effect on November 12, 1999. This act placed increased limits and requirements for data collection by financial institutions, as well as limited how that information could be collected and stored. It focused on requiring financial institutions to take specific measure to increase the safety and confidentiality of the information being collected. In addition to this, the law also put limitations on what type of data could be collected by financial institutions and how they could use that information. The act strives to protect NPI, or nonpublic personal information, which is any information that is collected regarding an individual&#x27;s finances that is not otherwise publicly available.

===Children&#x27;s Online Privacy Protection Act===

The Children&#x27;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), passed on April 21, 2000, is a federal law in the United States that puts severe restrictions on what data companies can collect, share, or sell about children who are under the age of 13. A core provision under COPPA is that a website operator must &quot;obtain verifiable parental consent before any collection, use, or disclosure of personal information from children.&quot;

==Constitutional basis for right to privacy==

===Federal===

Although the word &quot;privacy&quot; is actually never used in the text of the United States Constitution, there are Constitutional limits to the government&#x27;s intrusion into individuals&#x27; right to privacy. This is true even when pursuing a public purpose such as exercising police powers or passing legislation. The Constitution, however, only protects against state actors. Invasions of privacy by individuals can only be remedied under previous court decisions.

The First Amendment protects the right to free assembly, broadening privacy rights. The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States ensures that &quot;the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.&quot; The Fourth Amendment was the Framers&#x27; attempt to protect each citizen&#x27;s spiritual and intellectual integrity. A government that violates the Fourth Amendment in order to use evidence against a citizen is also violating the Fifth Amendment. The Ninth Amendment declares that &quot;The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.&quot;

===State===

====Alaska====
On August 22, 1972, the Alaska Right of Privacy Amendment, Amendment 3, was approved with 86% of the vote in support of the legislatively referred constitutional amendment. Article I, Section 22 of Alaska&#x27;s constitution states, &quot;The right of the people to privacy is recognized and shall not be infringed. The legislature shall implement this section.&quot;

====California====

The California Constitution articulates privacy as an inalienable right.

CA SB 1386 expands on privacy law and guarantees that if a company exposes a Californian&#x27;s sensitive information this exposure must be reported to the citizen. This law has inspired many states to come up with similar measures.

California&#x27;s &quot;Shine the Light&quot; law (SB 27, CA Civil Code § 1798.83), operative on January 1, 2005, outlines specific rules regarding how and when a business must disclose use of a customer&#x27;s personal information and imposes civil damages for violation of the law.

California&#x27;s Reader Privacy Act was passed into law in 2011. The law prohibits a commercial provider of a book service, as defined, from disclosing, or being compelled to disclose, any personal information relating to a user of the book service, subject to certain exceptions. The bill would require a provider to disclose personal information of a user only if a court order has been issued, as specified, and certain other conditions have been satisfied. The bill would impose civil penalties on a provider of a book service for knowingly disclosing a user&#x27;s personal information to a government entity in violation of these provisions. This law is applicable to electronic books in addition to print books.

The California Privacy Rights Act created the California Privacy Protection Agency, the first data protection agency in the United States.

====Florida====

Article I, §23 of the Florida Constitution states that &quot;Every natural person has the right to be let alone and free from governmental intrusion into the person&#x27;s private life except as otherwise provided herein. This section shall not be construed to limit the public&#x27;s right of access to public records and meetings as provided by law.&quot;

====Montana====
Article 2, §10 of the Montana Constitution states that &quot;The right of individual privacy is essential to the well-being of a free society and shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest&quot;.

====Washington====
Article 1, §7 of the Washington Constitution states that &quot;No person shall be disturbed in his private affairs, or his home invaded, without authority of law&quot;.
* Law enforcement are required to obtain a warrant before using IMSI-catcher technology.
* Private individual&#x27;s text messages are protected from warrantless searches.

==State privacy laws==

The right to privacy is protected also by more than 600 laws in the states and by a dozen federal laws, like those protecting health and student information, also limiting electronic surveillance.

As of 2022 however, only five states had data privacy laws.

==&quot;Opt-out&quot; requirements==
Several of the US federal privacy laws have substantial &quot;opt-out&quot; requirements, requiring that the individual specifically opt-out of commercial dissemination of personally identifiable information (PII). In some cases, an entity wishing to &quot;share&quot; (disseminate) information is required to provide a notice, such as a GLBA notice or a HIPAA notice, requiring individuals to specifically opt-out. These &quot;opt-out&quot; requests may be executed either by use of forms provided by the entity collecting the data, with or without separate written requests.

==Privacy of health-related information==

The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act) is an important piece of legislation in the United States that relates to the privacy of health-related information. Enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the HITECH Act addresses the privacy and security concerns associated with the electronic transmission of health information.

<text>Karl Terrence Hudson-Phillips, ORTT, QC (20 April 1933 – 16 January 2014) was an Attorney-General of Trinidad and Tobago and a judge of the International Criminal Court. He was also lead counsel in the murder trial of Grenadian Prime Minister Maurice Bishop.

==Biography==
Hudson-Phillips attended Tranquillity School and Queen&#x27;s Royal College in Port of Spain, Trinidad, before going to England to read law at Selwyn College, Cambridge. In 1959, he was called to the bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn, London. He returned to Trinidad and Tobago where he established a distinguished legal practice and was conferred the honour of Queen&#x27;s Counsel - the mark of professional eminence in the British Commonwealth in 1971. He was the youngest Attorney General within the Commonwealth at the age of 36. Hudson-Phillips graduated from the University of Cambridge, England (1952–1956), M.A, LLB. He was a member of the Bar of the following countries: United Kingdom, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Barbados, St Kitts, Antigua, The British Virgin Islands and Jamaica. 

He entered active politics in 1966, when he was elected a Member of Parliament for the constituency of Digeo Martin East. Prior to that, he had been active in student politics and social activities and was the President of the Cambridge University West Indian Society in 1945–1956. He was also Chairman of the first Overseas Party Group of the ruling People&#x27;s National Movement (PNM) Party in 1958, soon after Dr Eric Williams came into power.

Hudson-Phillips returned to Trinidad in 1959 and commenced his law practicewith his father, who was then a prominent member of the Trinidad Bar. He became active in politics of Trinidad at a Party level and served on several party committees being the Party delegate to the conference on the Constitution for an independent Trinidad and Tobago in 1961. He was appointed a member of the Board of the Trinidad and Tobago Electricity Commission on which he served for four years from 1962-1966.

On entering Parliament in 1966, he continued his law practice while being introduced into active politics at Parliamentary level. In 1968, he made his first major speech in the House when he pioleted the first amendment to the Independent Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago to provide a widening of the provisions permitting Trinidad and Tobago citizens to have dual citizenship and to extend the date of application for citizenship by certain classes of Trinidad residents.

Between the period 1966 and 1969, he was the Government&#x27;s delegate to several international conferences including, Conference of non-nuclear states -Geneva 1968 and Law of the Sea Conference 1969. Hudson-Phillips became a minister with Cabinet rank on 29 September 1969 and, on 24 December 1969, at age 36, the youngest serving Attorney General in the British Commonwealth. 

Soon after his appointment to Attorney General, civil disturbances started in Trinidad and Tobago. The Black Power riots and Army Mutiny of 1970. 

In 1973, Hudson-Phillips fell out of favour with then Prime Minister Eric Williams (for openly campaigning to replace Williams, who had spoken about retirement). This ended his political career in the PNM.

In 1974, Hudson-Phillips founded the National Land Tenants and Ratepayers Association of Trinidad and Tobago. In 1980, he founded the Organisation for National Reconstruction (ONR), a political party which contested the 1981 General Elections. Despite getting the second-highest vote tally in the election, the ONR failed to secure a single seat in Parliament. The ONR went on to form an accommodation with the National Alliance to contest the 1983 local government elections, and went on the merge with those parties to form the National Alliance for Reconstruction (NAR). Hudson-Phillips and Basdeo Panday, as the leaders of the two largest factions in what became the NAR, decided to step aside and allow A. N. R. Robinson, leader of one of the smaller parties, to become party leader. The NAR contested the 1986 general elections and won 33 of the 36 seats in Parliament. Hudson-Phillips did not take an active role in the party after the election.

In addition to the Grenada murder trial, Hudson-Phillips has been involved in many high-profile cases throughout the Caribbean, as both Prosecutor and Defender. In 1999, he was elected President of the Law Association of Trinidad and Tobago.

In February 2003, Hudson-Phillips was elected to the first ever bench of International Criminal Court judges. As &quot;dean of the judges&quot;, he chaired the first meetings of judges before the election of the Presidency. He also contributed actively to the drafting of the Regulations of the Court. He resigned from the court for personal reasons on 14 March 2007, effective 30 September 2007.

On 23 July 2010, Sihasak Phuangketkeow, President of the UN Human Rights Council, announced that Hudson-Phillips would head a panel of experts to investigate whether Israel&#x27;s Gaza flotilla raid on 31 May 2010 breached international law. Along with Hudson-Phillips, the panel included Briton Desmond Lorenz de Silva and Malaysian Mary Shanthi Dairiam.

Hudson-Phillips died in London on 16 January 2014.

<doc id="1287575" wikidata="Q64515943" url="?curid=1287575" title="Mario's Cement Factory">
<text>is an LCD handheld electronic game developed by Nintendo and published in 1983 under their &quot;Game &amp; Watch&quot; series. It follows earlier &quot;Mario&quot; games, like the arcade and Game &amp; Watch versions of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. Players control Mario as he navigates elevators and funnels cement through a factory, while trying to prevent the cement from crushing his fellow workers. Two modes were released: a tabletop model; and a handheld version akin to most other Game &amp; Watch titles. Development was headed by Nintendo R&amp;D1, led by engineer Gunpei Yokoi.

The game has been re-released several times; it was featured as part of &quot;Game Boy Gallery&quot; for the Game Boy, &quot;Game &amp; Watch Gallery 4&quot; for the Game Boy Advance, and as a digital download for the Nintendo DSi. It has been described by critics as one of the strangest games in the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Mario&#x27;s Cement Factory&quot; puts players in control of Mario, who works at a cement factory where he funnels cement into cement trucks. Mario must navigate two dangerous elevators and avoid falling or being crushed and losing a life. He must also continually empty cement into the trucks, or else the cement will overflow and crush one of the workers below, which costs players a life. There are two game modes: A and B, the latter being faster paced and more difficult.

==Development==
&quot;Mario&#x27;s Cement Factory&quot; was developed by Nintendo R&amp;D1, which at the time was led by Gunpei Yokoi, and published by Nintendo. Like all Game &amp; Watch releases, each unit is a standalone portable device that doubles as a clock and can only play the one game. Hirokazu Tanaka composed the game sounds.
Two versions of the game were released. The first is part of the Game &amp; Watch Table Top series and debuted on April 28, 1983. It has a full color illuminated screen, and approximately 250,000 models were produced. The Table Top series did not sell as well, leading to &quot;Mario&#x27;s Cement Factory&quot; being one of only four Table Top units ever produced. A smaller handheld version was later released on June 8 that year as part of the New Wide Screen series. It has a monochrome screen with a color overlay, and approximately 750,000 units were produced.

The game was released the same year that Nintendo&#x27;s Famicom system debuted in Japan, and two years after the first &quot;Mario&quot; title (the arcade game &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;).

==Re-releases==
&quot;Mario&#x27;s Cement Factory&quot; has been re-released in various forms. It was included in the 1995 &quot;Game Boy Gallery&quot; for Game Boy, featuring updated graphics. It was also re-released in the Nintendo Mini Classics line, which repackaged Game &amp; Watch games in small Game Boy-like devices. Both the New Wide Screen and an updated version were included in the 2002 &quot;Game &amp; Watch Gallery 4&quot; for the Game Boy Advance. In 2009, the game was re-released for the Nintendo DSi&#x27;s DSiWare download service (along with other Game &amp; Watch games). The DSi version was released in Japan on August 18. It was released in North America and Europe in March 2010. The DSi version was also given as a reward on Nintendo&#x27;s now-defunct Club Nintendo service.

==Reception==
&quot;Mario&#x27;s Cement Factory&quot; received generally positive reception, called one of the best Game &amp; Watch games, and praised for its relative complexity and fun factor. It was identified as a favorite by &quot;Wired&quot; writer Andy Robertson, and in a preview of &quot;Game &amp; Watch Gallery 4&quot;, &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; writer Ben Kosmina expressed that he loved &quot;Mario&#x27;s Cement Factory&quot;. Staff for the magazine &quot;Video Games&quot; regarded it as a more difficult game than many before it. It was also named the 10th best Game &amp; Watch game in a survey of &quot;ITMedia&quot; readers. Despite this positive reception, it received some criticism, considered primitive by the standards of today, In a review by &quot;IGN&quot; writer Lucas M. Thomas felt that the controls were too &quot;picky and precise&quot;. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; writer Corbie Dillard noted it as being among the most popular Game &amp; Watch titles, feeling that it&#x27;s more playable and enjoyable thanks to the diversity of its gameplay. He noted that though there may be nostalgia involved in the enjoyment of Game &amp; Watch games, he legitimately had fun with the game. It has been called one of the stranger entries in the &quot;Mario&quot; series. Mario&#x27;s role as a cement factory worker has been mentioned in multiple articles that cover the array of professions Mario has undertaken.

The original units have become collector&#x27;s items and, like many Game &amp; Watch titles, a complete-in-box unit can sell for over US$100. The game was featured in a Gunpei Yokoi exhibit in Harajuku in 2010.

<text>In mathematics, a vertex operator algebra (VOA) is an algebraic structure that plays an important role in two-dimensional conformal field theory and string theory. In addition to physical applications, vertex operator algebras have proven useful in purely mathematical contexts such as monstrous moonshine and the geometric Langlands correspondence.

The related notion of vertex algebra was introduced by Richard Borcherds in 1986, motivated by a construction of an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra due to Igor Frenkel. In the course of this construction, one employs a Fock space that admits an action of vertex operators attached to elements of a lattice. Borcherds formulated the notion of vertex algebra by axiomatizing the relations between the lattice vertex operators, producing an algebraic structure that allows one to construct new Lie algebras by following Frenkel&#x27;s method.

The notion of vertex operator algebra was introduced as a modification of the notion of vertex algebra, by Frenkel, James Lepowsky, and Arne Meurman in 1988, as part of their project to construct the moonshine module. They observed that many vertex algebras that appear &#x27;in nature&#x27; carry an action of the Virasoro algebra, and satisfy a bounded-below property with respect to an energy operator. Motivated by this observation, they added the Virasoro action and bounded-below property as axioms.

We now have post-hoc motivation for these notions from physics, together with several interpretations of the axioms that were not initially known. Physically, the vertex operators arising from holomorphic field insertions at points in two-dimensional conformal field theory admit operator product expansions when insertions collide, and these satisfy precisely the relations specified in the definition of vertex operator algebra. Indeed, the axioms of a vertex operator algebra are a formal algebraic interpretation of what physicists call chiral algebras (not to be confused with the more precise notion with the same name in mathematics) or &quot;algebras of chiral symmetries&quot;, where these symmetries describe the Ward identities satisfied by a given conformal field theory, including conformal invariance. Other formulations of the vertex algebra axioms include Borcherds&#x27;s later work on singular commutative rings, algebras over certain operads on curves introduced by Huang, Kriz, and others, D-module-theoretic objects called chiral algebras introduced by Alexander Beilinson and Vladimir Drinfeld and factorization algebras, also introduced by Beilinson and Drinfeld. 

Important basic examples of vertex operator algebras include the lattice VOAs (modeling lattice conformal field theories), VOAs given by representations of affine Kac–Moody algebras (from the WZW model), the Virasoro VOAs, which are VOAs corresponding to representations of the Virasoro algebra, and the moonshine module &quot;V&quot;♮, which is distinguished by its monster symmetry. More sophisticated examples such as affine W-algebras and the chiral de Rham complex on a complex manifold arise in geometric representation theory and mathematical physics.

== Formal definition ==
===Vertex algebra===
A vertex algebra is a collection of data that satisfy certain axioms.

==== Data ====
* a vector space formula_1, called the space of states. The underlying field is typically taken to be the complex numbers, although Borcherds&#x27;s original formulation allowed for an arbitrary commutative ring.
* an identity element formula_2, sometimes written formula_3 or formula_4 to indicate a vacuum state.
* an endomorphism formula_5, called &quot;translation&quot;. (Borcherds&#x27;s original formulation included a system of divided powers of formula_6, because he did not assume the ground ring was divisible.)
* a linear multiplication map formula_7, where formula_8 is the space of all formal Laurent series with coefficients in formula_1. This structure has some alternative presentations:
** as an infinite collection of bilinear products formula_10 where formula_11 and formula_12, so that for each formula_13, there is an formula_14 such that formula_15 for formula_16.
** as a left-multiplication map formula_17. This is the &#x27;state-to-field&#x27; map of the so-called state-field correspondence. For each formula_18, the endomorphism-valued formal distribution formula_19 is called a vertex operator or a field, and the coefficient of formula_20 is the operator formula_21. In the context of vertex algebras, a field is more precisely an element of formula_22, which can be written formula_23 such that for any formula_24 for sufficiently small formula_25 (which may depend on formula_13). The standard notation for the multiplication is
::formula_27

==== Axioms ====
These data are required to satisfy the following axioms:

* Identity. For any formula_28 and formula_29.
* Translation. formula_30, and for any formula_31,
::formula_32

* Locality (Jacobi identity, or Borcherds identity). For any formula_31, there exists a positive integer such that:
::formula_34

===== Equivalent formulations of locality axiom =====
The locality axiom has several equivalent formulations in the literature, e.g., Frenkel–Lepowsky–Meurman introduced the Jacobi identity: formula_35,

:formula_36

where we define the formal delta series by:

:formula_37

Borcherds initially used the following two identities: for any vectors &quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, and &quot;w&quot;, and integers &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; we have

:formula_38
and
:formula_39.

He later gave a more expansive version that is equivalent but easier to use: for any vectors &quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, and &quot;w&quot;, and integers &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, and &quot;q&quot; we have

:formula_40

Finally, there is a formal function version of locality: For any formula_41, there is an element

:formula_42

such that formula_43 and formula_44 are the corresponding expansions of formula_45 in formula_46 and formula_47.

===Vertex operator algebra===
A vertex operator algebra is a vertex algebra equipped with a conformal element formula_48, such that the vertex operator formula_49 is the weight two Virasoro field formula_50:

:formula_51

and satisfies the following properties:
* formula_52, where formula_53 is a constant called the central charge, or rank of formula_1. In particular, the coefficients of this vertex operator endow formula_1 with an action of the Virasoro algebra with central charge formula_53.
* formula_57 acts semisimply on formula_1 with integer eigenvalues that are bounded below.
* Under the grading provided by the eigenvalues of formula_57, the multiplication on formula_1 is homogeneous in the sense that if formula_61 and formula_13 are homogeneous, then formula_63 is homogeneous of degree formula_64.
* The identity formula_65 has degree 0, and the conformal element formula_66 has degree 2.
* formula_67.

A homomorphism of vertex algebras is a map of the underlying vector spaces that respects the additional identity, translation, and multiplication structure. Homomorphisms of vertex operator algebras have &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;strong&quot; forms, depending on whether they respect conformal vectors.

==Commutative vertex algebras==
A vertex algebra formula_1 is commutative if all vertex operators formula_19 commute with each other. This is equivalent to the property that all products formula_70 lie in formula_71, or that formula_72. Thus, an alternative definition for a commutative vertex algebra is one in which all vertex operators formula_19 are regular at formula_74.

Given a commutative vertex algebra, the constant terms of multiplication endow the vector space with a commutative and associative ring structure, the vacuum vector formula_65 is a unit and formula_6 is a derivation. Hence the commutative vertex algebra equips formula_1 with the structure of a commutative unital algebra with derivation. Conversely, any commutative ring formula_1 with derivation formula_6 has a canonical vertex algebra structure, where we set formula_80, so that formula_81 restricts to a map formula_82 which is the multiplication map formula_83 with formula_84 the algebra product. If the derivation formula_6 vanishes, we may set formula_86 to obtain a vertex operator algebra concentrated in degree zero.

Any finite-dimensional vertex algebra is commutative.
Thus even the smallest examples of noncommutative vertex algebras require significant introduction.

==Basic properties==
The translation operator formula_6 in a vertex algebra induces infinitesimal symmetries on the product structure, and satisfies the following properties:

* formula_88
* formula_89, so formula_6 is determined by formula_81.
* formula_92
* formula_93
* (skew-symmetry) formula_94

For a vertex operator algebra, the other Virasoro operators satisfy similar properties:

* formula_95
* formula_96
* (quasi-conformality) formula_97 for all formula_98.
* (Associativity, or Cousin property): For any formula_41, the element

:formula_100

given in the definition also expands to formula_101 in formula_102.

The associativity property of a vertex algebra follows from the fact that the commutator of formula_19 and formula_104 is annihilated by a finite power of formula_105, i.e., one can expand it as a finite linear combination of derivatives of the formal delta function in formula_106, with coefficients in formula_107.

Reconstruction: Let formula_1 be a vertex algebra, and let formula_109 be a set of vectors, with corresponding fields formula_110. If formula_1 is spanned by monomials in the positive weight coefficients of the fields (i.e., finite products of operators formula_112 applied to formula_65, where formula_25 is negative), then we may write the operator product of such a monomial as a normally ordered product of divided power derivatives of fields (here, normal ordering means polar terms on the left are moved to the right). Specifically,

:formula_115

More generally, if one is given a vector space formula_1 with an endomorphism formula_6 and vector formula_65, and one assigns to a set of vectors formula_119 a set of fields formula_110 that are mutually local, whose positive weight coefficients generate formula_1, and that satisfy the identity and translation conditions, then the previous formula describes a vertex algebra structure.

=== Operator product expansion ===
In vertex algebra theory, due to associativity, we can abuse notation to write, for formula_122
formula_123
This is the operator product expansion. Equivalently,
formula_124
Since the normal ordered part is regular in formula_125 and formula_126, this can be written more in line with physics conventions as
formula_127
where the equivalence relation formula_128 denotes equivalence up to regular terms.

==== Commonly used OPEs ====
Here some OPEs frequently found in conformal field theory are recorded.

== Examples from Lie algebras ==
The basic examples come from infinite-dimensional Lie algebras.
=== Heisenberg vertex operator algebra ===
A basic example of a noncommutative vertex algebra is the rank 1 free boson, also called the Heisenberg vertex operator algebra. It is &quot;generated&quot; by a single vector &quot;b&quot;, in the sense that by applying the coefficients of the field &quot;b&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) := &quot;Y&quot;(&quot;b&quot;,&quot;z&quot;) to the vector &quot;1&quot;, we obtain a spanning set. The underlying vector space is the infinite-variable polynomial ring formula_129, where for positive formula_25, formula_131 acts obviously by multiplication, and formula_132 acts as formula_133. The action of &quot;b&quot;0 is multiplication by zero, producing the &quot;momentum zero&quot; Fock representation &quot;V&quot;0 of the Heisenberg Lie algebra (generated by &quot;b&quot;n for integers &quot;n&quot;, with commutation relations [&quot;b&quot;n,&quot;b&quot;m]=&quot;n&quot; δn,–m), induced by the trivial representation of the subalgebra spanned by &quot;b&quot;n, n ≥ 0.

The Fock space &quot;V&quot;0 can be made into a vertex algebra by the following definition of the state-operator map on a basis formula_134 with each formula_135,

:formula_136

where formula_137 denotes normal ordering of an operator formula_138. The vertex operators may also be written as a functional of a multivariable function f as:

:formula_139

if we understand that each term in the expansion of f is normal ordered.

The rank &quot;n&quot; free boson is given by taking an &quot;n&quot;-fold tensor product of the rank 1 free boson. For any vector &quot;b&quot; in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space, one has a field &quot;b&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) whose coefficients are elements of the rank &quot;n&quot; Heisenberg algebra, whose commutation relations have an extra inner product term: [&quot;b&quot;n,&quot;c&quot;m]=&quot;n&quot; (b,c) δn,–m.

The Heisenberg vertex operator algebra has a one-parameter family of conformal vectors with parameter formula_140 of conformal vectors formula_141 given by
:formula_142
with central charge formula_143.

When formula_144, there is the following formula for the Virasoro character:

:formula_145

This is the generating function for partitions, and is also written as &quot;q&quot;1/24 times the weight −1/2 modular form 1/η (the reciprocal of the Dedekind eta function). The rank &quot;n&quot; free boson then has an &quot;n&quot; parameter family of Virasoro vectors, and when those parameters are zero, the character is &quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot;/24 times the weight −&quot;n&quot;/2 modular form η−&quot;n&quot;.

=== Virasoro vertex operator algebra===
Virasoro vertex operator algebras are important for two reasons: First, the conformal element in a vertex operator algebra canonically induces a homomorphism from a Virasoro vertex operator algebra, so they play a universal role in the theory. Second, they are intimately connected to the theory of unitary representations of the Virasoro algebra, and these play a major role in conformal field theory. In particular, the unitary Virasoro minimal models are simple quotients of these vertex algebras, and their tensor products provide a way to combinatorially construct more complicated vertex operator algebras.

The Virasoro vertex operator algebra is defined as an induced representation of the Virasoro algebra: If we choose a central charge &quot;c&quot;, there is a unique one-dimensional module for the subalgebra C[z]∂z + &quot;K&quot; for which &quot;K&quot; acts by &quot;c&quot;Id, and C[z]∂z acts trivially, and the corresponding induced module is spanned by polynomials in &quot;L&quot;–n = –z−n–1∂z as &quot;n&quot; ranges over integers greater than 1. The module then has partition function

:formula_146.

This space has a vertex operator algebra structure, where the vertex operators are defined by:

:formula_147

and formula_148. The fact that the Virasoro field &quot;L(z)&quot; is local with respect to itself can be deduced from the formula for its self-commutator:

formula_149

where &quot;c&quot; is the central charge.

Given a vertex algebra homomorphism from a Virasoro vertex algebra of central charge &quot;c&quot; to any other vertex algebra, the vertex operator attached to the image of ω automatically satisfies the Virasoro relations, i.e., the image of ω is a conformal vector. Conversely, any conformal vector in a vertex algebra induces a distinguished vertex algebra homomorphism from some Virasoro vertex operator algebra.

The Virasoro vertex operator algebras are simple, except when &quot;c&quot; has the form 1–6(&quot;p&quot;–&quot;q&quot;)2/&quot;pq&quot; for coprime integers &quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot; strictly greater than 1 – this follows from Kac&#x27;s determinant formula. In these exceptional cases, one has a unique maximal ideal, and the corresponding quotient is called a minimal model. When &quot;p&quot; = &quot;q&quot;+1, the vertex algebras are unitary representations of Virasoro, and their modules are known as discrete series representations. They play an important role in conformal field theory in part because they are unusually tractable, and for small &quot;p&quot;, they correspond to well-known statistical mechanics systems at criticality, e.g., the Ising model, the tri-critical Ising model, the three-state Potts model, etc. By work of Weiqang Wang concerning fusion rules, we have a full description of the tensor categories of unitary minimal models. For example, when &quot;c&quot;=1/2 (Ising), there are three irreducible modules with lowest &quot;L&quot;0-weight 0, 1/2, and 1/16, and its fusion ring is Z[&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;]/(&quot;x&quot;2–1, &quot;y&quot;2–&quot;x&quot;–1, &quot;xy&quot;–&quot;y&quot;).

=== Affine vertex algebra ===
By replacing the Heisenberg Lie algebra with an untwisted affine Kac–Moody Lie algebra (i.e., the universal central extension of the loop algebra on a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra), one may construct the vacuum representation in much the same way as the free boson vertex algebra is constructed. This algebra arises as the current algebra of the Wess–Zumino–Witten model, which produces the anomaly that is interpreted as the central extension.

Concretely, pulling back the central extension

:formula_150

along the inclusion formula_151 yields a split extension, and the vacuum module is induced from the one-dimensional representation of the latter on which a central basis element acts by some chosen constant called the &quot;level&quot;. Since central elements can be identified with invariant inner products on the finite type Lie algebra formula_152, one typically normalizes the level so that the Killing form has level twice the dual Coxeter number. Equivalently, level one gives the inner product for which the longest root has norm 2. This matches the loop algebra convention, where levels are discretized by third cohomology of simply connected compact Lie groups.

By choosing a basis &quot;J&quot;a of the finite type Lie algebra, one may form a basis of the affine Lie algebra using &quot;J&quot;a&quot;n&quot; = &quot;J&quot;a &quot;t&quot;&quot;n&quot; together with a central element &quot;K&quot;. By reconstruction, we can describe the vertex operators by normal ordered products of derivatives of the fields

:formula_153

When the level is non-critical, i.e., the inner product is not minus one half of the Killing form, the vacuum representation has a conformal element, given by the Sugawara construction. For any choice of dual bases &quot;J&quot;a, &quot;J&quot;a with respect to the level 1 inner product, the conformal element is

:formula_154

and yields a vertex operator algebra whose central charge is formula_155. At critical level, the conformal structure is destroyed, since the denominator is zero, but one may produce operators &quot;L&quot;&quot;n&quot; for &quot;n&quot; ≥ –1 by taking a limit as &quot;k&quot; approaches criticality.

==Modules==
Much like ordinary rings, vertex algebras admit a notion of module, or representation. Modules play an important role in conformal field theory, where they are often called sectors. A standard assumption in the physics literature is that the full Hilbert space of a conformal field theory decomposes into a sum of tensor products of left-moving and right-moving sectors:

:formula_156

That is, a conformal field theory has a vertex operator algebra of left-moving chiral symmetries, a vertex operator algebra of right-moving chiral symmetries, and the sectors moving in a given direction are modules for the corresponding vertex operator algebra.

=== Definition ===
Given a vertex algebra &quot;V&quot; with multiplication &quot;Y&quot;, a &quot;V&quot;-module is a vector space &quot;M&quot; equipped with an action &quot;Y&quot;M: &quot;V&quot; ⊗ &quot;M&quot; → &quot;M&quot;((&quot;z&quot;)), satisfying the following conditions:

: (Identity) &quot;Y&quot;M(1,z) = IdM
: (Associativity, or Jacobi identity) For any &quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot; ∈ &quot;V&quot;, &quot;w&quot; ∈ &quot;M&quot;, there is an element

:formula_157

such that &quot;Y&quot;M(&quot;u&quot;,&quot;z&quot;)&quot;Y&quot;M(&quot;v&quot;,&quot;x&quot;)&quot;w&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;M(&quot;Y&quot;(&quot;u&quot;,&quot;z&quot;–&quot;x&quot;)&quot;v&quot;,&quot;x&quot;)&quot;w&quot;
are the corresponding expansions of formula_45 in &quot;M&quot;((&quot;z&quot;))((&quot;x&quot;)) and &quot;M&quot;((&quot;x&quot;))((&quot;z&quot;–&quot;x&quot;)).
Equivalently, the following &quot;Jacobi identity&quot; holds:

:formula_159

The modules of a vertex algebra form an abelian category. When working with vertex operator algebras, the previous definition is sometimes given the name &quot;weak formula_1-module&quot;, and genuine &quot;V&quot;-modules must respect the conformal structure given by the conformal vector formula_66. More precisely, they are required to satisfy the additional condition that &quot;L&quot;0 acts semisimply with finite-dimensional eigenspaces and eigenvalues bounded below in each coset of Z. Work of Huang, Lepowsky, Miyamoto, and Zhang has shown at various levels of generality that modules of a vertex operator algebra admit a fusion tensor product operation, and form a braided tensor category.

When the category of &quot;V&quot;-modules is semisimple with finitely many irreducible objects, the vertex operator algebra &quot;V&quot; is called rational. Rational vertex operator algebras satisfying an additional finiteness hypothesis (known as Zhu&#x27;s &quot;C&quot;2-cofiniteness condition) are known to be particularly well-behaved, and are called &quot;regular&quot;. For example, Zhu&#x27;s 1996 modular invariance theorem asserts that the characters of modules of a regular VOA form a vector-valued representation of formula_162. In particular, if a VOA is &quot;holomorphic&quot;, that is, its representation category is equivalent to that of vector spaces, then its partition function is formula_162-invariant up to a constant. Huang showed that the category of modules of a regular VOA is a modular tensor category, and its fusion rules satisfy the Verlinde formula.

=== Heisenberg algebra modules ===

Modules of the Heisenberg algebra can be constructed as Fock spaces formula_164 for formula_140 which are induced representations of the Heisenberg Lie algebra, given by a vacuum vector formula_166 satisfying formula_167 for formula_168, formula_169, and being acted on freely by the negative modes formula_131 for formula_171. The space can be written as formula_172. Every irreducible, formula_173-graded Heisenberg algebra module with gradation bounded below is of this form.

These are used to construct lattice vertex algebras, which as vector spaces are direct sums of Heisenberg modules, when the image of formula_81 is extended appropriately to module elements.

The module category is not semisimple, since one may induce a representation of the abelian Lie algebra where &quot;b&quot;0 acts by a nontrivial Jordan block. For the rank &quot;n&quot; free boson, one has an irreducible module &quot;V&quot;λ for each vector λ in complex &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space. Each vector &quot;b&quot; ∈ Cn yields the operator &quot;b&quot;0, and the Fock space &quot;V&quot;λ is distinguished by the property that each such &quot;b&quot;0 acts as scalar multiplication by the inner product (&quot;b&quot;, λ).

=== Twisted modules ===

Unlike ordinary rings, vertex algebras admit a notion of twisted module attached to an automorphism. For an automorphism σ of order &quot;N&quot;, the action has the form &quot;V&quot; ⊗ &quot;M&quot; → &quot;M&quot;((&quot;z&quot;1/N)), with the following monodromy condition: if &quot;u&quot; ∈ &quot;V&quot; satisfies σ &quot;u&quot; = exp(2π&quot;ik&quot;/&quot;N&quot;)&quot;u&quot;, then &quot;u&quot;n = 0 unless &quot;n&quot; satisfies &quot;n&quot;+&quot;k&quot;/&quot;N&quot; ∈ Z (there is some disagreement about signs among specialists). Geometrically, twisted modules can be attached to branch points on an algebraic curve with a ramified Galois cover. In the conformal field theory literature, twisted modules are called twisted sectors, and are intimately connected with string theory on orbifolds.

== Additional examples ==
=== Vertex operator algebra defined by an even lattice ===
The lattice vertex algebra construction was the original motivation for defining vertex algebras. It is constructed by taking a sum of irreducible modules for the Heisenberg algebra corresponding to lattice vectors, and defining a multiplication operation by specifying intertwining operators between them. That is, if is an even lattice (if the lattice is not even, the structure obtained is instead a vertex superalgebra), the lattice vertex algebra decomposes into free bosonic modules as:

:formula_175

Lattice vertex algebras are canonically attached to double covers of even integral lattices, rather than the lattices themselves. While each such lattice has a unique lattice vertex algebra up to isomorphism, the vertex algebra construction is not functorial, because lattice automorphisms have an ambiguity in lifting.

The double covers in question are uniquely determined up to isomorphism by the following rule: elements have the form for lattice vectors (i.e., there is a map to sending to α that forgets signs), and multiplication satisfies the relations &quot;e&quot;α&quot;e&quot;β = (–1)(α,β)&quot;e&quot;β&quot;e&quot;α. Another way to describe this is that given an even lattice , there is a unique (up to coboundary) normalised cocycle with values such that , where the normalization condition is that ε(α, 0) = ε(0, α) = 1 for all . This cocycle induces a central extension of by a group of order 2, and we obtain a twisted group ring with basis , and multiplication rule – the cocycle condition on ensures associativity of the ring.

The vertex operator attached to lowest weight vector in the Fock space is

:formula_176

where is a shorthand for the linear map that takes any element of the α-Fock space to the monomial . The vertex operators for other elements of the Fock space are then determined by reconstruction.

As in the case of the free boson, one has a choice of conformal vector, given by an element &quot;s&quot; of the vector space , but the condition that the extra Fock spaces have integer &quot;L&quot;0 eigenvalues constrains the choice of &quot;s&quot;: for an orthonormal basis , the vector 1/2 &quot;x&quot;i,12 + &quot;s&quot;2 must satisfy for all λ ∈ Λ, i.e., &quot;s&quot; lies in the dual lattice.

If the even lattice is generated by its &quot;root vectors&quot; (those satisfying (α, α)=2), and any two root vectors are joined by a chain of root vectors with consecutive inner products non-zero then the vertex operator algebra is the unique simple quotient of the vacuum module of the affine Kac–Moody algebra of the corresponding simply laced simple Lie algebra at level one. This is known as the Frenkel–Kac (or Frenkel–Kac–Segal) construction, and is based on the earlier construction by Sergio Fubini and Gabriele Veneziano of the tachyonic vertex operator in the dual resonance model. Among other features, the zero modes of the vertex operators corresponding to root vectors give a construction of the underlying simple Lie algebra, related to a presentation originally due to Jacques Tits. In particular, one obtains a construction of all ADE type Lie groups directly from their root lattices. And this is commonly considered the simplest way to construct the 248-dimensional group &quot;E&quot;8.

=== Monster vertex algebra ===
The monster vertex algebra formula_177 (also called the &quot;moonshine module&quot;) is the key to Borcherds&#x27;s proof of the Monstrous moonshine conjectures. It was constructed by Frenkel, Lepowsky, and Meurman in 1988. It is notable because its character is the j-invariant with no constant term, formula_178, and its automorphism group is the monster group. It is constructed by orbifolding the lattice vertex algebra constructed from the Leech lattice by the order 2 automorphism induced by reflecting the Leech lattice in the origin. That is, one forms the direct sum of the Leech lattice VOA with the twisted module, and takes the fixed points under an induced involution. Frenkel, Lepowsky, and Meurman conjectured in 1988 that formula_177 is the unique holomorphic vertex operator algebra with central charge 24, and partition function formula_178. This conjecture is still open.
=== Chiral de Rham complex ===
Malikov, Schechtman, and Vaintrob showed that by a method of localization, one may canonically attach a bcβγ (boson–fermion superfield) system to a smooth complex manifold. This complex of sheaves has a distinguished differential, and the global cohomology is a vertex superalgebra. Ben-Zvi, Heluani, and Szczesny showed that a Riemannian metric on the manifold induces an &quot;N&quot;=1 superconformal structure, which is promoted to an &quot;N&quot;=2 structure if the metric is Kähler and Ricci-flat, and a hyperkähler structure induces an &quot;N&quot;=4 structure. Borisov and Libgober showed that one may obtain the two-variable elliptic genus of a compact complex manifold from the cohomology of the Chiral de Rham complex. If the manifold is Calabi–Yau, then this genus is a weak Jacobi form.

=== Vertex algebra associated to a surface defect === 
A vertex algebra can arise as a subsector of higher dimensional quantum field theory which localizes to a two real-dimensional submanifold of the space on which the higher dimensional theory is defined. A prototypical example is the construction of Beem, Leemos, Liendo, Peelaers, Rastelli, and van Rees which associates a vertex algebra to any 4d &quot;N&quot;=2 superconformal field theory. This vertex algebra has the property that its character coincides with the Schur index of the 4d superconformal theory. When the theory admits a weak coupling limit, the vertex algebra has an explicit description as a BRST reduction of a bcβγ system.

== Vertex operator superalgebras ==
By allowing the underlying vector space to be a superspace (i.e., a Z/2Z-graded vector space formula_181) one can define a &quot;vertex superalgebra&quot; by the same data as a vertex algebra, with 1 in &quot;V&quot;+ and &quot;T&quot; an even operator. The axioms are essentially the same, but one must incorporate suitable signs into the locality axiom, or one of the equivalent formulations. That is, if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are homogeneous, one compares &quot;Y&quot;(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;z&quot;)&quot;Y&quot;(&quot;b&quot;,&quot;w&quot;) with ε&quot;Y&quot;(&quot;b&quot;,&quot;w&quot;)&quot;Y&quot;(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;z&quot;), where ε is –1 if both &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are odd and 1 otherwise. If in addition there is a Virasoro element ω in the even part of &quot;V&quot;2, and the usual grading restrictions are satisfied, then &quot;V&quot; is called a &quot;vertex operator superalgebra&quot;.

One of the simplest examples is the vertex operator superalgebra generated by a single free fermion ψ. As a Virasoro representation, it has central charge 1/2, and decomposes as a direct sum of Ising modules of lowest weight 0 and 1/2. One may also describe it as a spin representation of the Clifford algebra on the quadratic space &quot;t&quot;1/2C[&quot;t&quot;,&quot;t&quot;−1](&quot;dt&quot;)1/2 with residue pairing. The vertex operator superalgebra is holomorphic, in the sense that all modules are direct sums of itself, i.e., the module category is equivalent to the category of vector spaces.

The tensor square of the free fermion is called the free charged fermion, and by boson–fermion correspondence, it is isomorphic to the lattice vertex superalgebra attached to the odd lattice Z. This correspondence has been used by Date–Jimbo–Kashiwara-Miwa to construct soliton solutions to the KP hierarchy of nonlinear PDEs.

== Superconformal structures ==
The Virasoro algebra has some supersymmetric extensions that naturally appear in superconformal field theory and superstring theory. The &quot;N&quot;=1, 2, and 4 superconformal algebras are of particular importance.

Infinitesimal holomorphic superconformal transformations of a supercurve (with one even local coordinate &quot;z&quot; and &quot;N&quot; odd local coordinates θ1...,θN) are generated by the coefficients of a super-stress–energy tensor &quot;T&quot;(z, θ1, ..., θN).

When &quot;N&quot;=1, &quot;T&quot; has odd part given by a Virasoro field &quot;L&quot;(&quot;z&quot;), and even part given by a field

subject to commutation relations

* formula_183
* formula_184

By examining the symmetry of the operator products, one finds that there are two possibilities for the field &quot;G&quot;: the indices &quot;n&quot; are either all integers, yielding the Ramond algebra, or all half-integers, yielding the Neveu–Schwarz algebra. These algebras have unitary discrete series representations at central charge

:formula_185

and unitary representations for all &quot;c&quot; greater than 3/2, with lowest weight &quot;h&quot; only constrained by &quot;h&quot;≥ 0 for Neveu–Schwarz and &quot;h&quot; ≥ &quot;c&quot;/24 for Ramond.

An &quot;N&quot;=1 superconformal vector in a vertex operator algebra &quot;V&quot; of central charge &quot;c&quot; is an odd element τ ∈ &quot;V&quot; of weight 3/2, such that
:formula_186

&quot;G&quot;−1/2τ = ω, and the coefficients of &quot;G&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) yield an action of the &quot;N&quot;=1 Neveu–Schwarz algebra at central charge &quot;c&quot;.

For &quot;N&quot;=2 supersymmetry, one obtains even fields &quot;L&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) and &quot;J&quot;(&quot;z&quot;), and odd fields &quot;G&quot;+(z) and &quot;G&quot;−(z). The field &quot;J&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) generates an action of the Heisenberg algebras (described by physicists as a &quot;U&quot;(1) current). There are both Ramond and Neveu–Schwarz &quot;N&quot;=2 superconformal algebras, depending on whether the indexing on the &quot;G&quot; fields is integral or half-integral. However, the &quot;U&quot;(1) current gives rise to a one-parameter family of isomorphic superconformal algebras interpolating between Ramond and Neveu–Schwartz, and this deformation of structure is known as spectral flow. The unitary representations are given by discrete series with central charge &quot;c&quot; = 3-6/&quot;m&quot; for integers &quot;m&quot; at least 3, and a continuum of lowest weights for &quot;c&quot; &gt; 3.

An &quot;N&quot;=2 superconformal structure on a vertex operator algebra is a pair of odd elements τ+, τ− of weight 3/2, and an even element μ of weight 1 such that τ± generate &quot;G&quot;±(z), and μ generates &quot;J&quot;(&quot;z&quot;).

For &quot;N&quot;=3 and 4, unitary representations only have central charges in a discrete family, with &quot;c&quot;=3&quot;k&quot;/2 and 6&quot;k&quot;, respectively, as &quot;k&quot; ranges over positive integers.

== Additional constructions ==
* Fixed point subalgebras: Given an action of a symmetry group on a vertex operator algebra, the subalgebra of fixed vectors is also a vertex operator algebra. In 2013, Miyamoto proved that two important finiteness properties, namely Zhu&#x27;s condition C2 and regularity, are preserved when taking fixed points under finite solvable group actions.
* Current extensions: Given a vertex operator algebra and some modules of integral conformal weight, one may under favorable circumstances describe a vertex operator algebra structure on the direct sum. Lattice vertex algebras are a standard example of this. Another family of examples are framed VOAs, which start with tensor products of Ising models, and add modules that correspond to suitably even codes.
* Orbifolds: Given a finite cyclic group acting on a holomorphic VOA, it is conjectured that one may construct a second holomorphic VOA by adjoining irreducible twisted modules and taking fixed points under an induced automorphism, as long as those twisted modules have suitable conformal weight. This is known to be true in special cases, e.g., groups of order at most 3 acting on lattice VOAs.
* The coset construction (due to Goddard, Kent, and Olive): Given a vertex operator algebra &quot;V&quot; of central charge &quot;c&quot; and a set &quot;S&quot; of vectors, one may define the commutant &quot;C&quot;(&quot;V&quot;,&quot;S&quot;) to be the subspace of vectors &quot;v&quot; strictly commute with all fields coming from &quot;S&quot;, i.e., such that &quot;Y&quot;(&quot;s&quot;,&quot;z&quot;)&quot;v&quot; ∈ V&quot;z&quot; for all &quot;s&quot; ∈ &quot;S&quot;. This turns out to be a vertex subalgebra, with &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, and identity inherited from &quot;V&quot;. And if &quot;S&quot; is a VOA of central charge &quot;c&quot;S, the commutant is a VOA of central charge &quot;c&quot;–&quot;c&quot;S. For example, the embedding of &quot;SU&quot;(2) at level &quot;k&quot;+1 into the tensor product of two &quot;SU&quot;(2) algebras at levels &quot;k&quot; and 1 yields the Virasoro discrete series with &quot;p&quot;=&quot;k&quot;+2, &quot;q&quot;=&quot;k&quot;+3, and this was used to prove their existence in the 1980s. Again with &quot;SU&quot;(2), the embedding of level &quot;k&quot;+2 into the tensor product of level &quot;k&quot; and level 2 yields the &quot;N&quot;=1 superconformal discrete series.
* BRST reduction: For any degree 1 vector &quot;v&quot; satisfying &quot;v&quot;02=0, the cohomology of this operator has a graded vertex superalgebra structure. More generally, one may use any weight 1 field whose residue has square zero. The usual method is to tensor with fermions, as one then has a canonical differential. An important special case is quantum Drinfeld–Sokolov reduction applied to affine Kac–Moody algebras to obtain affine &quot;W&quot;-algebras as degree 0 cohomology. These &quot;W&quot; algebras also admit constructions as vertex subalgebras of free bosons given by kernels of screening operators.

==Related algebraic structures==
* If one considers only the singular part of the OPE in a vertex algebra, one arrives at the definition of a Lie conformal algebra. Since one is often only concerned with the singular part of the OPE, this makes Lie conformal algebras a natural object to study. There is a functor from vertex algebras to Lie conformal algebras that forgets the regular part of OPEs, and it has a left adjoint, called the &quot;universal vertex algebra&quot; functor. Vacuum modules of affine Kac–Moody algebras and Virasoro vertex algebras are universal vertex algebras, and in particular, they can be described very concisely once the background theory is developed.
* There are several generalizations of the notion of vertex algebra in the literature. Some mild generalizations involve a weakening of the locality axiom to allow monodromy, e.g., the &quot;abelian intertwining algebras&quot; of Dong and Lepowsky. One may view these roughly as vertex algebra objects in a braided tensor category of graded vector spaces, in much the same way that a vertex superalgebra is such an object in the category of super vector spaces. More complicated generalizations relate to &quot;q&quot;-deformations and representations of quantum groups, such as in work of Frenkel–Reshetikhin, Etingof–Kazhdan, and Li.
* Beilinson and Drinfeld introduced a sheaf-theoretic notion of &quot;chiral algebra&quot; that is closely related to the notion of vertex algebra, but is defined without using any visible power series. Given an algebraic curve &quot;X&quot;, a chiral algebra on &quot;X&quot; is a &quot;D&quot;X-module &quot;A&quot; equipped with a multiplication operation formula_187 on &quot;X&quot;×&quot;X&quot; that satisfies an associativity condition. They also introduced an equivalent notion of &quot;factorization algebra&quot; that is a system of quasicoherent sheaves on all finite products of the curve, together with a compatibility condition involving pullbacks to the complement of various diagonals. Any translation-equivariant chiral algebra on the affine line can be identified with a vertex algebra by taking the fiber at a point, and there is a natural way to attach a chiral algebra on a smooth algebraic curve to any vertex operator algebra.

<text>Doug Rhodes (born May 28, 1945) is an American multi-instrumentalist who performed with 1960s rock bands the Music Machine and the Millennium.

Growing up in Garden Grove, California, Rhodes began his music career as a jazz saxophonist at the age of 16, playing with older brother Robbie Rhodes. Eventually, he became the member of a band called The Spats, for whom he played organ. He was kicked out of the band late in 1965. After moving to L.A. in January 1966, Rhodes met producer Curt Boettcher, who got him work as a studio musician. He played celeste for the Association&#x27;s No. 1 hit &quot;Cherish&quot;.

In the summer of 1966, Rhodes joined the rock band the Music Machine, for whom he primarily played the organ and provided backing vocals. After the release of the band&#x27;s first LP, &quot;(Turn On) The Music Machine&quot;, and a promotional tour, four of the five members, including Rhodes, quit the group, leaving only singer/songwriter Sean Bonniwell. According to Rhodes, there was conflict over money and Bonniwell&#x27;s attitude toward the other members. Bonniwell continued to use the band name and released a second album mostly of older recordings on which Rhodes had performed.

Rhodes continued to work with Curt Boettcher, forming the band the Millennium along with two other former Music Machine members. The Millennium&#x27;s debut LP was released by Columbia Records in 1968. After the short-lived Millennium dissolved, Rhodes kept busy as a session musician, playing for the likes of the Association, Taj Mahal, Chad and Jeremy, Tommy Roe, and Van Dyke Parks. He was also involved in the Millennium-splintered group Bigshot, which was signed to Together records, the label set-up by Gary Usher and Boettcher in 1969. The others members of Bigshot included drummer Ron Edgar, guitarist Michael Fennelly, and ex-Goldebriars guitarist Murray Planta. Some demos were recorded but never issued. The producer of those sessions was Joey Stec.

In 1971, Rhodes moved to British Columbia, Canada. He continued to play around with various musicians, including Valdy. Eventually, he settled in Victoria, B.C., became a professional at piano tuning and restoration, as well as playing 1920s style jazz with an orchestra called The Belevedere Broadcasters. He has a son, Davis Lamar Rhodes, and a daughter, Sasha Marie Rhodes. he plays with the Yiddish Columbia State Orchestra, a Klezmer band, led by Marion Siegel.

<text>Sir William Sidney Smith (21 June 1764 – 26 May 1840) was a British naval officer and politician. Serving in the American War of Independence and French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, he rose to the rank of admiral in the Royal Navy. Smith was known for his outspoken character and penchant for acting on his own initiative, which caused a great deal of friction with many of his superiors and colleagues. 

His military skill, personal intelligence and enterprise led to his involvement in a variety of tasks which involved warfare, diplomacy and espionage. He became a hero in Britain for leading the successful defence of Acre in 1799, thwarting Napoleon&#x27;s plans of further conquest in the Sinai. Napoleon Bonaparte, reminiscing later in his life, said of him: &quot;That man made me miss my destiny&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Sidney Smith, as he always called himself, was born into a military and naval family with connections to the Pitt family. He was born at Westminster, the second son of Captain John Smith of the Guards and his wife Mary Wilkinson, daughter of wealthy merchant Pinckney Wilkinson. Sidney Smith attended Tonbridge School until 1772. He joined the Royal Navy in 1777 and fought in the American War of Independence. From June 1777 to January 1778 he served under Commander Jahleel Brenton on board the storeship . He moved to the post ship , and in her saw action in 1778 against the American frigate .

For his bravery under Rodney in the action near Cape St Vincent in January 1780, Sidney Smith was, on 25 September, appointed lieutenant of the 74-gun third-rate , despite being under the required age of nineteen.

He distinguished himself under Admiral Thomas Graves at the Battle of the Chesapeake in 1781 and under Admiral George Rodney at the Battle of the Saintes. In consequence he received his first command, the sloop . He was soon promoted to captain a larger frigate, but following the peace of Versailles in 1783, he was put ashore on half pay.

During the peace, Smith chose to travel to France and first became involved with intelligence matters while observing the construction of the new naval port at Cherbourg. He also travelled in Spain and Morocco which were also potential enemies.

==Service in the Royal Swedish Navy==
In 1790, he applied for permission to serve in the Royal Swedish Navy in the war between Sweden and Russia. King Gustav III appointed him to command one light squadron and to be one of his principal naval advisers. Smith led his forces in the attempt of clearing the Bay of Viborg of the Russian fleet and later at the Battle of Svensksund (Finnish: Ruotsinsalmi, Russian: Rochensalm). The Russians lost sixty-four ships and over a thousand men. The Swedes lost four ships and had few casualties. For this, Smith was knighted by the king and made a Commander Grand Cross of the Swedish Svärdsorden (Order of the Sword). Smith used this title, with King George III&#x27;s permission.

==Service in the French Revolutionary Wars==

In 1792, Smith&#x27;s younger brother, John, was appointed to the British embassy to the Ottoman court in Constantinople. Smith obtained permission to travel to Turkey. While there, war broke out with Revolutionary France in January 1793. Smith recruited some British seamen and sailed to join the British fleet under Admiral Lord Hood which had occupied the French Navy&#x27;s principal Mediterranean port of Toulon at the invitation of the French Royalist forces.

By Smith&#x27;s arrival in December 1793, the Revolutionary forces, including a colonel of artillery, Napoleon Bonaparte, had surrounded the port and were attacking it. The British and their allies had insufficient soldiers to mount an effective defence and so the port was evacuated. Smith, serving as a volunteer with no command, was given the task of burning as many French ships and stores as possible before the harbour could be captured. Despite his efforts, lack of support from the Spanish forces sent to help him left more than half of the French ships to be captured undamaged. Although Smith had destroyed more French ships than had the most successful fleet action to that date, Nelson and Collingwood, among others, blamed him for this failure to destroy all of the French fleet.

On his return to London, Smith was given command of the fifth-rate and in 1795 joined the Western Squadron under Sir John Borlase Warren. This squadron consisted of some of the most skilful and daring captains, including Sir Edward Pellew. Smith fitted this pattern and on one occasion took his ship almost into the port of Brest to observe the French fleet.

In July 1795, Captain Smith, commanding the western frigate squadron in HMS &quot;Diamond&quot;, occupied the Îles Saint-Marcouf off the coast of Normandy. He sacrificed two of his gun vessels, and , to provide materials and manpower for fortifying the islands and setting a temporary naval garrison. Further defences were constructed by Royal Engineers, and Royal Marines and Royal Artillery detachments were established. The islands served as a forward base for the blockade of Le Havre, a launching point for intercepting coastal shipping, and as a transit point for French émigrés, and were held by the Royal Navy for nearly seven years.

Smith specialised in inshore operations, and on 19 April 1796, he and his secretary John Wesley Wright were captured while attempting to cut out a French ship in Le Havre. Smith had taken the ship&#x27;s boats into the harbour, but the wind died as they attempted to leave the harbour, and the French were able to recapture the ship with Smith and Wright aboard. Instead of being exchanged, as was the custom, Smith and Wright were taken to the Temple prison in Paris where Smith was to be charged with arson for his burning of the fleet at Toulon. As Smith had been on half pay at the time, the French considered that he was not an official combatant. Whilst in the Temple prison he commissioned a drawing of himself and his secretary John Wesley Wright from the French artist Philippe-Auguste Hennequin, which is now in the British Museum. Another drawing by Hennequin, depicting only Smith, is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Smith was held in Paris for two years, despite a number of efforts to exchange him and frequent contacts with both French Royalists and British agents. Notably Captain Jacques Bergeret, captured in April 1796 with the frigate &quot;Virginie&quot;, was sent from England to Paris to negotiate his own exchange; when the Directoire refused, he returned to London. The French authorities threatened several times to try Smith for arson, but never followed through on the threats. Eventually in 1798 the Royalists, who pretended to be taking him to another prison, helped Smith and Wright to escape. The royalists brought the two Englishmen to Le Havre, where they boarded an open fishing boat and were picked up on 5 May by on patrol in the English Channel, arriving in London on 8 May 1798. Bergeret was then released, the British government considering the prisoner exchange as completed.

==Service in the Mediterranean==
Following Nelson&#x27;s overwhelming victory at the Battle of the Nile, Smith was sent to the Mediterranean as captain of , a captured 80-gun French ship of the line which had been bought into the Royal Navy. It was not a purely naval appointment, although he was ordered to place himself under the command of Lord St Vincent, the commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean. St Vincent gave him orders as Commodore with permission to take British ships under his command as required in the Levant. He also carried a military and diplomatic mission to Istanbul where his brother was now a Minister Plenipotentiary to the Sublime Porte. The mission&#x27;s task was to strengthen Turkish opposition to Napoleon and to assist the Turks in destroying the French army stranded in Egypt. This dual appointment caused Nelson, who was the senior officer under St Vincent in the Mediterranean, to resent Smith&#x27;s apparent superseding of his authority in the Levant. Nelson&#x27;s antipathy further adversely affected Smith&#x27;s reputation in naval circles.
Napoleon, having defeated the Ottoman forces in Egypt, marched north along the Mediterranean coast with 13,000 troops through Sinai and into what was then the Ottoman province of Syria. Here he took control of much of the southern part of the province, representing modern-day Israel and Palestine, and of a single town in today&#x27;s Lebanon, Tyre. On the way north he captured Gaza and Jaffa, the latter with much brutality towards the civilian population and the massacre of 3,000 captured Ottoman soldiers, whom he was unable to take with him or send back to Egypt. Napoleon&#x27;s army then marched to Acre.
Smith sailed to Acre and helped the Turkish commander Jezzar Pasha reinforce the defences and old walls and supplied him with additional cannon manned by sailors and Marines from his ships. He also used his command of the sea to capture the French siege artillery being sent by ship from Egypt and to deny the French army the use of the coastal road from Jaffa by bombarding the troops from the sea.

Once the siege began in late March 1799, Smith anchored HMS &quot;Tigre&quot; and so their broadsides could assist the defence. Repeated French assaults were driven back, several attempts to mine the walls were prevented. By early May, replacement French siege artillery had arrived overland and a breach was forced in the defences. However, the assault was again repelled and Turkish reinforcements from Rhodes were able to land. On 9 May after another fierce bombardment, the final French assault was made. This, too, was repelled and Napoleon began making plans for the withdrawal of his army to Egypt. Shortly after this, Napoleon abandoned his army in Egypt and sailed back to France evading the British ships patrolling the Mediterranean.
Smith attempted to negotiate the surrender and repatriation of the remaining French forces under General Kléber and signed the Convention of El-Arish. However, because of the influence of Nelson&#x27;s view that the French forces in Egypt should be annihilated rather than allowed to return to France, the treaty was abrogated by Lord Keith who had succeeded St Vincent as commander-in-chief.

The British decided instead to land an army under Sir Ralph Abercromby at Abukir Bay. Smith and &quot;Tigre&quot; were involved in the training and transport of the landing forces and as liaison with the Turks, but his unpopularity resulted in the loss of his diplomatic credentials and his naval position as Commodore in the eastern Mediterranean. The invasion was successful and the French defeated, although Abercromby was wounded and died soon after the battle. Following this Smith then supported the army under Abercromby&#x27;s successor John Hely-Hutchinson, which besieged and captured Cairo and finally took the last French stronghold of Alexandria. The French troops were eventually repatriated on terms similar to those previously obtained by Smith in the Convention of El-Arish.

==Service in British waters==

On his return to England in 1801, Smith received some honours and a pension of £1,000 for his services, but he was overshadowed again by Nelson who was being acclaimed as the victor of the Battle of Copenhagen. During the brief Peace of Amiens, Smith was elected Member of Parliament for Rochester in Kent in the election held in 1802. There is strong evidence that he had an affair with Princess Caroline of Brunswick, the estranged wife of the Prince of Wales. Although she became pregnant, she was notorious for having a number of other lovers at the same time, such as George Canning and Thomas Lawrence, so it is unlikely the child was Smith&#x27;s.

With the resumption of war with France in 1803, Smith was employed in the southern North Sea off the coast between Ostend and Flushing part of the forces gathered to prevent Napoleon&#x27;s threatened invasion.

Smith was interested in new and unusual methods of warfare. In 1804 and 1805, he worked with the American inventor Robert Fulton on his plans to develop torpedoes and mines to destroy the French invasion fleet gathering off the French and Belgian coasts. However, an attempt to use the new weapons combined with Congreve rockets in an attack on Boulogne was foiled by bad weather and the French gunboats that came out to threaten the attackers. Despite this setback, suggestions were made that the rockets, mines and torpedoes be used against the Combined French and Spanish Fleet in Cádiz. This was not necessary as the combined fleet sailed to defeat at the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805.

==Further service in the Mediterranean==
In November 1805, Smith was promoted to rear admiral, he was again sent to the Mediterranean under the command of Collingwood, who had become the commander-in-chief following Nelson&#x27;s death. Collingwood sent him to assist King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies to regain his capital of Naples from Napoleon&#x27;s brother King Joseph, who had been given the Kingdom of Naples.

Smith planned a campaign using Calabrian irregular troops with a force of 5,000 British officers and men to march north on Naples. On 4 July 1806, they defeated a larger French force at the Battle of Maida. Once again, Smith&#x27;s inability to avoid offending his superiors caused him to be replaced as commander of the land forces despite his success. He was replaced by Sir John Moore, one of Britain&#x27;s most able soldiers. Moore abandoned Smith&#x27;s plan and resorted to making the island of Sicily a strong British base in the Mediterranean.

Smith was sent to join Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth&#x27;s expedition to Constantinople in February 1807. This was intended to forestall the French from making an alliance with the Turks to allow free passage of their army to Egypt. On 19 February Duckworth detached Smith&#x27;s division to deal with a Turkish squadron impeding the fleet&#x27;s progress, which Smith ably destroyed. Despite Smith&#x27;s great experience in Turkish waters, his knowledge of the Turkish court, and his personal popularity with the Turks, he was kept in a subordinate role during the campaign. Even when Duckworth eventually did ask for his advice, it was not heeded. Duckworth, instead of allowing Smith to negotiate with the Turks, which the French ambassador later said would have been the end of the French overtures, retreated back through the Dardanelles under heavy Turkish fire. Although this was a defeat, the withdrawal under fire was played up as a heroic feat. In the summer of 1807, Duckworth and Smith were recalled to England.

==Portugal and Brazil==

In October 1807, Spain and France signed a treaty to divide Portugal between them. In November 1807, Smith was appointed to command an expedition to Lisbon, either to assist the Portuguese in resisting the attack or to destroy the Portuguese fleet and blockade the harbour at Lisbon should that be unsuccessful. Smith arranged for the Portuguese fleet to sail for Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, at that time a Portuguese colony. He was involved in planning an attack on the Spanish colonies in South America, in combination with the Portuguese, contrary to his orders, but he was recalled to Britain in 1809 before any of the plans could be carried out. He received much popular acclaim for his actions and was treated as a hero, but the government continued to be suspicious of him, and he was not given any official honours. Smith was promoted to vice admiral on 31 July 1810. In the Royal Navy of the time, promotion from Post Captain to Admiral was automatic and based on seniority, not a specific reward for good service. Later that year in October 1810, he married Caroline Rumbold, the widow of a diplomat, Sir George Rumbold, with whom Smith had worked.

Upon safe arrival to Brazil escorting the Portuguese Royal Family, Admiral Smith was awarded by the Prince-Regent John, the Grand Cross of the newly restored Order of the Tower and Sword.

==Mediterranean again==
In July 1812, Smith again sailed for the Mediterranean aboard his new flagship, the 74-gun &quot;Tremendous&quot;. He was appointed as second in command to Vice Admiral Sir Edward Pellew. His task was to blockade Toulon and he transferred his flag to the larger , a 110-gun first-rate. The French did not come out of port to confront the British. Early in 1814, the Allies entered Paris and Napoleon abdicated. With the coming of peace and the defeat of Napoleon, Smith began the journey back to England.

==Peace and Waterloo==
In March 1815, Napoleon escaped from Elba and gathering his veteran troops marched on Paris where he was reinstated as Emperor of the French. Smith travelling back to England had only reached Brussels by June. Smith, his wife and stepdaughter attended the Duchess of Richmond&#x27;s ball on night 15/16 June, and three days later, hearing the gunfire of a great battle, he rode out of Brussels and went to meet the Duke of Wellington. Smith found him late in the day when he had just won the Battle of Waterloo. Smith started making arrangements for the collecting and treatment of the many wounded soldiers on both sides. He was then asked to take the surrender of the French garrisons at Arras and Amiens and to ensure that the Allied armies could enter Paris without a fight and that it would be safe for King Louis XVIII to return to his capital. For these and other services, he was finally awarded a British knighthood, the KCB, so he was not just &quot;the Swedish Knight&quot; any more.

Smith then took up the anti-slavery cause. The Barbary pirates had operated for centuries out of a number of North African ports. They had enslaved captured sailors and even made raids to kidnap people from European coasts, including England and Ireland. Smith attended the Congress of Vienna to campaign for funds and military action to end the practice of slave taking.

==France and death==

Smith had managed to run up significant debts through his diplomatic expenses, which the British government proved to be very slow in reimbursing. He also lived the high life and his efforts to mobilise opinion against the slave trade had cost a good deal of money. In Britain, at that time debtors were often imprisoned until their debts were paid, so Smith moved his family to France, settling in Paris. Eventually the government did reimburse his expenditures and increased his pension, allowing him to live in some style. Despite frequent attempts to obtain a seagoing position, he was never to hold a command again. He died on 26 May 1840 of a stroke. He is buried with his wife in Père Lachaise Cemetery.

==Namesakes==
On 7 April 1801, the town Sidney in Delaware County, New York, was named in Sir Sidney Smith&#x27;s honour. In June 1811 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1838 he was promoted to GCB in the Coronation Honours.
Sidney Smith Barracks, in Mandate Palestine, were named in his honour. Now it is the site of Bustan Ha-Galil in northern Israel, where on 14 July 1941 the French forces in Syria and Lebanon signed their surrender to the British.

<text>Heideroosjes (pronounced: hi-duh-rose-yes, HR in short), are a Dutch punk rock band from Horst aan de Maas. The band are known for their energetic shows and songs with lyrics mostly in Dutch and English, and a few songs in German and Limburgish (a dialect spoken in the Dutch province of Limburg). The band, formed in 1989, consisted of Marco Roelofs (vocals/guitar), Frank Kleuskens (guitar), Fred Houben (bass) and Igor Hobus (percussion). This lineup has not changed.

Heideroosjes played nearly 1500 shows in Europe, the United States, Japan and South Africa.

==History==

=== 1989–1999 ===

After releasing two albums on their self-founded label Fairytale Records Heideroosjes got its nationwide breakthrough in 1995 by opening the prestigious Pinkpop festival in The Netherlands. In 1998 the band signed a worldwide record deal with the world&#x27;s biggest punk label, Epitaph Records, based in Hollywood (CA).

In 1999, the band made its first TV appearance in the United States when talk-show host Jerry Springer played some live footage of their song &quot;Jerry Rules In The Land Of The Free&quot;. In this song, taken from their album &quot;Schizo&quot;, Heideroosjes voiced their opinion on (semi-reality) TV shows like &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;.

Heideroosjes toured (mainly) Europe with familiar bands like The Offspring, Pennywise, The Misfits, Bad Religion and Less Than Jake.

===2000–2010===
In 2004, the Heideroosjes tour bus was involved in a serious accident. Three roadies were wounded, and one roadie was seriously injured. The band cancelled their tour but continued a few weeks later. Later that year, Heideroosjes received the Dutch Edison award for their single &quot;Damclub Hooligan&quot; (from their album &quot;SINema&quot;). In March 2004 the band appeared for the first time live in the US when they played at the SXSW Festival in Austin, Texas. A rave review in &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; said &quot;Now that was a lesson in rock &#x27;n roll. They blew the other bands right of the front door&quot;.

In November and December 2005 Heideroosjes did an Ode to the Ramones tour in the Netherlands and Belgium. During this tour they only played covers from their heroes: The Ramones.

In 2006, Heideroosjes made international news by making a song with the mayor of Maastricht, Gerd Leers. In this song, called &quot;Dope man&quot;, they mock the Dutch soft drug policy, which in their eyes is hypocritical. A few weeks later the Dutch minister of Justice, Piet Hein Donner, recorded a rap song with rapper Meester G responding to &quot;Dope man&quot; by defending his soft drug policy. Later that year Heideroosjes record their eighth album with Los Angeles-based producer Cameron Webb, who worked with bands like Motörhead, Ignite, Social Distortion and Silverstein. Motörhead singer Lemmy features on the song &quot;My Funeral&quot;. Even as Ignite lead singer Zoli Teglas sings in the song &quot;Forgotten Continent&quot;.

After years of touring the world including Japan, South Africa, and former Yugoslavia, Heideroosjes started a new phase in their career. In 2008 the band did a 100-show counting comedy tour called &quot;Manie Manie&quot;. In this show the music seemed less important and there was more focus on stories, acting and comedy. According to the band &quot;they wanted to try something different. Just because the combination of punk and theater is such a contrast.&quot;

In 2009 Heideroosjes celebrated 20 years touring with no line-up changes; the anniversary was marked by a double album and an extensive tour through Europe.

After a &#x27;sabbatical year&#x27; in 2010 the band returned to touring and announced a new album for 2011. In September of that year Heideroosjes announced that the new studio album, &quot;Cease-Fire&quot;, would be their last one. &quot;After this album and the tour, we&#x27;re gonna quit&quot; the band said. The main reason for the split, according to the band members, was &quot;We still love to play and being on stage. But we are fed up with all the business that comes along with being in a professional band. We had a great time and traveled all over the world. We lived our dreams. And we believe it&#x27;s better to burn out than to fade away&quot;. The farewell tour contained shows at the Lowlands Festival and the Sziget Festival in Hungary (2012). At the end of September 2012 Heideroosjes waved goodbye with two sold-out shows in Holland (Melkweg-Amsterdam) and two sold-out shows in Belgium (AB-Brussels).

===2019===
In 2019, the Heideroosjes played 5 shows as support for the German band Wizo and scheduled several other concerts and shows on festivals in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.

<text>West is a brand of cigarettes, currently owned and manufactured by Imperial Brands.

==History==
West was introduced to the German market in 1981 and initially were only available in specialised tobacco shops. The launch of the new brand was accompanied by a dynamic advertising campaign under the slogan &quot;Let&#x27;s go West!&quot;. Thanks to a successful pricing policy and positioning quality at a reasonable price, a year later the brand became one of the leading in Germany. Since approximately 1987 West became available in supermarkets and cigarette vending machines. West is the second-strongest cigarette brand in Germany.
In 1986, a new &quot;Test the West!&quot; advertising campaign was launched; the simplicity and originality of the new marketing strategies have been cited as key factors behind the uptick in brand recognition that was soon to follow. The campaign employed a strategy of placing paid promoters inside pubs, bars, restaurants and discotheques from which brand interest could be driven directly; in particular, by encouraging young people to engage in blindfolded product comparisons between West cigarettes and their current cigarette brand of choice.

In 1989, West Lights were introduced. The expansion of the range and the high demand for West cigarettes made it possible in two years to begin sales in Central and Eastern Europe.

In July 1995, it was reported that West was one of the most popular brands in the former German Democratic Republic, with the cigarette maker Philip Morris International declaring the total market share of international brands to have risen by almost 10% (to 39%) during the preceding 5-year span; the survey, conducted by Philip Morris Marktforschung, also showed that the former GDR brands had collectively endured losses of around 8% during the same timeframe. Nevertheless, with a total market share of 28.6%, in 1995 f6 remained the most popular cigarette smoked in the former GDR.

In Poland, West became widely available in the mid-1990s, the brand was advertised by actor Bogusław Linda in 1996.

In Russia, sales of West began in 1997, initially the cigarettes were available in two versions (Full Flavor and Lights) with a classic filter. The appearance of the new brand was accompanied by the advertising campaigns &quot;The taste of now&quot; and &quot;The power of now&quot;, which started a year earlier in Europe.

In 1999, to promote the brand, the company used the provocative advertising campaign &quot;USE&quot;, which is the continuation of &quot;Test the West!&quot;. The images used to popularize the brand had also become bolder. On the advertising posters, West&#x27;s characters turn out to be in intriguing and unconventional situations: for example, a girl confesses and smokes together with a priest in a confession. The slogan of the campaign is &quot;Equality for All&quot;. According to its results, West brand reached 11% of the share of the cigarette market in Germany.

In July 1999, West cigarettes became available in the U.K.

To increase the competitiveness of the brand in Russia, the brand&#x27;s specialists developed an innovative Streamtec filter in the form of a propeller, and in 2000 the brand was relaunched.

In the early 2000s, the brand continued its active development. Thanks to the partnership with the McLaren F1 team, West&#x27;s profile was raised. In production, West ST Ultra cigarettes were launched. Debut sales of West in Africa.

In 2004, &quot;Hongta Group&quot; announced it would produce the cigarettes in China.

Since 2009 there has been a significant expansion of the West line in the Russian market. West Tri Logic cigarettes with low levels of tar and nicotine and West Fusion were produced - standard length cigarettes in Super Slims format. The following year, the production of West SSL cigarettes began in a super-thin format. A year later, the launch of the production of West Compact format Queen size and West Duo classic King Size with a menthol capsule in the filter.

In January 2010, Imperial Tobacco announced a change in the design of the West cigarettes. Through the fresh design, the company said it was making &quot;a conscious effort for innovation and to create something that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing for our adult smokers&quot;.

==Marketing==
===Advertising campaigns===
For a long time West cigarettes were advertised with more and more different campaigns. In 2003, the advertising campaign (&quot;Für...&quot;) was carried out on Germany&#x27;s posters and advertising pillars. The motifs showed the new seasonal pack edition of West. So there are a total of 5 different motifs painted in national colors faces from Germany, France, England, Italy and Brazil. The faces on the packs are representative of the enthusiasm and internationality in the country, which can be triggered for example by a FIFA World Cup. West also issued special editions of cigarette packaging: West Summer Edition, West Oster Edition, West Cola, West in Space Edition, Fest (Christmas cigarettes) and West Lemon Fresh were briefly introduced.

===Test the West===

West terminated its relationship with McLaren due to a European Union ban on tobacco advertising in and Vodafone and Emirates became their primary sponsor from onwards. In countries where tobacco advertising already was banned on a local level (like Germany and France), West used certain logos, covered the West logos with black gaps, put the first names of the drivers (&quot;Mika&quot; for Mika Häkkinen, &quot;David&quot; for David Coulthard, &quot;Juan Pablo&quot; for Juan Pablo Montoya, &quot;Kimi&quot; for Kimi Räikkönen, and so on) or put &quot;East&quot; on their cars, referring to East Germany at the time to circumvent those laws.

In countries where tobacco advertising was banned on a local level (like Germany and France), West put the first names of the riders (&quot;Alex&quot; for Alex Barros, &quot;Loris&quot; for Loris Capirossi and so on) on the front and sides of the bikes to circumvent those laws.

<doc id="1287627" wikidata="Q627949" url="?curid=1287627" title="Canoe freestyle">
<text>Canoe freestyle (also known as playboating) is a discipline of whitewater kayaking or canoeing where people perform various technical moves in one place (a playspot), as opposed to downriver whitewater canoeing or kayaking where the objective is to travel the length of a section of river (although whitewater paddlers will often stop and play en route). Specialised canoes or kayaks (boats) known as playboats are often used, but any boat can be used for playing. The moves and tricks are often similar to those performed by snowboarders, surfers or skaters, where the athlete completes spins, flips, turns, etc. With modern playboats it is possible to get the kayak and the paddler completely airborne while performing tricks. The competitive side of playboating is known as freestyle kayaking (formerly called rodeo).

==Playspots==
Playspots are typically stationary features on rivers, in particular standing waves (which may be breaking or partially breaking), hydraulic jumps, &#x27;holes&#x27; and &#x27;stoppers&#x27;, where water flows back on itself creating a retentive feature (these are often formed at the bottom of small drops or weirs) or eddy lines (the boundary between slow moving water at the rivers&#x27; edge, and faster water).

==Moves==
Basic moves consist of front- and back-surfing, spins through any of the three axes; air screws, cartwheels and air loops (invented by Clay Wright), stalls with the kayak vertical on either end, and getting airborne (bouncing the boat on a wave, or submerging part of the kayak so that it pops out when it re-emerges). The playboater usually aims to stay surfing the feature after performing each move (as opposed to being washed off). More complex moves are made up of combinations of these moves.

These moves were more popular before short playboats were invented, but remain the foundation of several current moves.


==Popularity==

Playboating has grown in popularity in recent years due to innovations in boat design. Modern playboats are made from plastic which is much more robust than glass fibre or wood. Playboats typically have much less volume in the bow and stern than dedicated river-running kayaks. This allows the paddler to easily dip either end underwater.

Playboating is mainly done for fun, but competitions are also popular. Paddlers have a set time to perform as many moves as possible, and score additional points for style.

There are ICF Canoe Freestyle World Championships
 held under the banner of the  International Canoe Federation as well as a variety of different national and regional championships. The most recent World Championships was held in Columbus, USA with over 100 athletes.

Visiting a playspot where you do not need to commit to a full river run to get there (which involves shuttling cars to the bottom of the river) is often referred to as &#x27;Park and Play&#x27;. Playboating can often be more convenient and can in some circumstances can be considered safer than river running – in particular if the play spot is in an accessible area as opposed to numerous whitewater runs which exist in remote and inaccessible (in case of injury or rescue) areas.

==Etiquette and culture==
===Right of way===
Playboaters still generally follow right of way conventions that are commercially established. The vessel upstream of a feature has right of way over a vessel in the feature. This means that if a kayaker is surfing a wave, and a kayaker or a raft is coming downstream, the surfing kayaker should give way to the upstream paddler[s].

This general convention however is disregarded in many scenarios present in playboating:
* If the feature has eddy access a kayaker approaching from upstream should eddy out and get in the line to surf the wave, instead of using their right of way to catch the wave on the fly as this is seen as &#x27;budging&#x27;.
* If the kayaker is approaching a play feature that does not have eddy access they do not have the right to push a kayaker surfing on the wave off. They should wait until the kayaker flushes and then proceed down to surf the wave.
* A kayaker may not enter a play feature that another kayaker is surfing unless they are invited on for a &#x27;party surf&#x27;.
* A kayaker loses their right to stay on the wave if they stay on too long. Generally rides extending longer than 2 minutes are frowned upon and sometimes a kayaker having a long ride will be &#x27;dropped in on&#x27;.
* On some rivers that are heavily commercially rafted, rafts are privileged with skipping the line because they are on a timed trip and need to hit the wave many times in a short period. On other rivers, however, rafts that claim this privilege—especially without asking the other paddlers—are heavily frowned upon.
* Rafts coming downstream are given right of way because they are typically less agile to change their course than a kayak. Also, they are larger and heavy which makes being run over not much fun.
* If the feature is at a specially designed site e.g. Holme Pier Point, Nottingham, England then the paddler in the hole or wave has right of way (excluding rafts).

===Culture===
Playboaters are a very diverse crowd, primarily because of the wide range of skill levels playboating can accommodate. Generally in regions where playboating is more popular than creeking or river running due to the surrounding rivers, beginners will enter the sport of kayaking in a playboat, or a cross over boat. This group of kayakers if often supported by either a paid instructor, club, or skilled paddling friend who often supplies instruction, gear, safety and clean up support. Beginners, club paddlers and lesson groups are generally friendly and welcoming to newcomers, and typically only paddle in warm weather months to avoid the need of buying expensive cold water gear.

The culture of playboaters also encompasses a group of kayakers who are called &#x27;pro boaters&#x27; short for professional kayakers. These kayakers generally aspire to, or do, make money off of competitions, sponsorships, or media created on their playboating skills. There is a stereotype of &#x27;pro boaters&#x27; to be elusive, self indulged, and wild; a stigma often enforced by the media the group produces. Professional kayakers generally range between the ages of 16 and 35, and generally do not make more than average income per year.

The last major facet of playboaters that do not belong in the beginner / group culture, or the &#x27;pro boater&#x27; culture is the local playboater. This type of playboater is usually good to advanced in skill level, and generally is a graduate of the beginner or group culture scene. They are identified by a tighter knit group of friends, and their knowledge of the play waves in their area. It is not uncommon to see local boaters and pro boaters surfing advanced waves, with a distinct differentiation between the two cultures identified by their equipment, their lack or presence of media equipment, and general attitude around the feature.

<text>Persian Letters () is a literary work, published in 1721, by Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu, recounting the experiences of two fictional Persian noblemen, Usbek and Rica, who spend several years in France under Louis XIV and the Regency.

==Plot summary==
In 1711, Usbek leaves his seraglio in Isfahan to make the long journey to France, accompanied by his young friend Rica. He leaves behind five wives (Zashi, Zéphis, Fatmé, Zélis, and Roxane) in the care of a number of black eunuchs, one of whom is the head or first eunuch. During the trip and their long stay in Paris (1712–1720), they comment, in letters exchanged with friends and mullahs, on numerous aspects of Western, Christian society, particularly French politics and manners, including a biting satire of the System of John Law. Over time, various disorders surface back in the seraglio, and, beginning in 1717 (Letter 139 [147]), that situation rapidly unravels. Usbek orders his head eunuch to crack down, but his message does not arrive in time, and the internal revolt brings about the death of his wives, including the vengeful suicide of his favorite, Roxane, and, it appears, most of the eunuchs.

=== Chronology ===
The chronology can be summarized as follows:
* Letters 1–21 (1–23): The journey from Isfahan to France, which lasts almost 14 months (from 19 March 1711 to 4 May 1712).
* Letters 22–89 (24–92): Paris in the reign of Louis XIV, 3 years in all (from May 1712 to September 1715).
* Letters 90–137 (93–143) plus [Supplementary Letter 8 (145]: the Regency of Philippe d’Orléans, covering five years (from September 1715 to November 1720).
* Letters 138–150 (146–161): the collapse of the seraglio in Isfahan, approximately 3 years (1717–1720).

=== Dénouement ===
While Usbek appreciates the freer relations among men and women in the West, he remains, as master of a seraglio, in some measure a prisoner of his past. His wives play the role of languorous, abandoned lovers, he that of master and lover, with limited communication and little revelation of their true selves; Usbek&#x27;s language with them is as constrained as theirs with him. Suspecting from the outset, moreover, that he is not assured of a return to Persia, Usbek is also already disabused with respect to the attitude of his wives (letters 6 and 19 [20]). The seraglio is a bed of tension from which he increasingly distances himself, trusting his wives no more than he really trusts his eunuchs (Letter 6).

Everything cascades in the final letters (139–150 [147–161]), thanks to a sudden analepse of more than three years with respect to the sequence of letters by date. From letter 69 (71) to letter 139 (147) – chronologically from 1714 to 1720 – not a single letter from Usbek relates to the seraglio, which from letter 94 to 143 (and even in the posthumous edition from supplementary letter 97 to letter supplementary letter 8 [145]) is unmentioned in any guise. The letters from 126 to 137 (132 to 148) are from Rica, which, when examined closely, means that for about fifteen months (from 4 August 1719 to 22 October 1720) Usbek is silent. Although he has in the meantime received letters, they are unknown to the reader until the final series, which is more developed after the addition of supplementary letters 9–11 (157, 158, 160) of 1758, although Usbek has learned as early as October 1714 that &quot;the seraglio is in disorder&quot; (letter 63 [65]). As the spirit of rebellion advances, he decides to take action, but too late; with delays in the transmission of letters and the loss of some of them, the situation is beyond remedy.

A dejected Usbek is apparently resigned to the necessity of returning, with little hope, to Persia; on 4 October 1719 he laments: &quot;I shall deliver my head to my enemies&quot; (147 [155]). He nevertheless does not do so: late in 1720 he is still in Paris, for letters 134–137 (140–145), which contain the history of Law&#x27;s &quot;System&quot;, are in fact posterior to Roxane&#x27;s last missive (dated 8 May 1720), which he must already have received – the usual time for delivery being about five months – when he writes the latest in date of his own (supplementary letter 8 and letter 138 [145 and 146]), in October and November 1720. There is no reason to think he ever actually returns.

== Analysis ==
=== Epistolary novel ===

Montesquieu never referred to &quot;Persian Letters&quot; as a novel until &quot;Quelques remarques sur les &quot;Lettres persanes&quot; (1757),&quot; which begins: &quot;Nothing found more favor in &quot;Lettres persanes&quot; than to discover in them, unexpectedly, a sort of novel. One sees the beginning, the development, and the end; the various characters are placed in a chain that connects them.&quot; Initially, for most of its first readers as well as for its author, the book was not thought of primarily a novel, and even less an &quot;epistolary novel&quot; (as it is often classified now), which was not at that time in any sense a constituted genre. Indeed, it has little in common with the sole model at the time, Guilleragues&#x27;s &quot;Lettres portugaises&quot; of 1669. A collection of &quot;letters&quot; in 1721 would more likely evoke the recent tradition of essentially polemical and political periodicals, such as &quot;Lettres historiques&quot; (1692–1728) or the Jesuits&#x27; famous &quot;&quot; (1703–1776), not to mention Mme Dunoyer&#x27;s &quot;Lettres historiques et galantes&quot; (1707–1717) which, in the form of a correspondence between two women, provide a chronicle of the end of the reign of Louis XIV and the beginning of the Regency. &quot;Lettres persanes&quot; thus helped confirm the vogue of a format that was already more or less established. It is in its numerous imitations – such as &quot;Lettres juives&quot; (1738) and &quot;Lettres chinoises&quot; (1739) of Boyer d’Argens, &quot;Lettres d’une Turque à Paris, écrites à sa sœur&quot; (1730) by Poullain de Saint-Foix (published several times in conjunction with &quot;Lettres persanes&quot;), and perhaps especially Françoise de Graffigny’s &quot;Lettres d’une Péruvienne&quot; (1747) – not to mention the letter-novels of Richardson – which, between 1721 and 1754, had in effect transformed &quot;Lettres persanes&quot; into an &quot;epistolary novel&quot;. Whence this remark in Montesquieu&#x27;s &quot;Mes Pensées&quot;: &quot;My &quot;Lettres persanes&quot; taught people to write letter-novels&quot; (no. 1621).

The epistolary structure is quite flexible, nineteen correspondents in all, with at least twenty-two recipients. Usbek and Rica by far dominate with sixty-six letters for the former and forty-seven for the latter (of the original 150). Ibben functions more as addressee than correspondent, writing only two letters but the recipient of forty-two. An unnamed person designated only as *** (if always the same) receives eighteen letters but writes none at all. There is even a particular anomaly, a letter from Hagi Ibbi to Ben Josué (Letter 37 [39]), neither of whom is mentioned anywhere else.

The letters are all dated in accordance with a lunar calendar which, as Robert Shackleton showed in 1954, in fact corresponds to our own by simple substitution of Muslim names as follows: Zilcadé (January), Zilhagé (February), Maharram (March), Saphar (April), Rebiab I (May), Rebiab II (June), Gemmadi I (July), Gemmadi II (August), Rhegeb (September), Chahban (October), Rhamazan (November), Chalval (December).

=== Social commentary ===
In Paris, the Persians express themselves and elicit the opinions of others on a wide variety of subjects, from governmental institutions to salon caricatures. The difference of temperament of the two friends is notable, Usbek being more experienced and asking many questions, Rica less constrained and more attracted by aspects of French life. Both retain Montesquieu&#x27;s rich satirical tone, as in Rica&#x27;s letter 70 (72):

The other day I happened to be in a company where I saw a man who was very content with himself. In fifteen minutes he decided three questions of morality, four historical problems, and five points of physics. I have never seen such a universal decider ; his mind was never suspended by the slightest doubt. They left the sciences, and took up news of the day ; he decided about the news of the day. I wanted to trip him up, and said to myself: I must make use of my strength ; I am going to take refuge in my country. I spoke to him of Persia ; but I had scarcely said four words before he twice refuted me, based on the authority of MM. Tavernier and Chardin. Oh good Lord, said I to myself, who is this man ? Next thing he will know the streets of Isfahan better than I do ! My decision was soon made: I said no more, and let him talk, and he is still deciding.

Although this takes place soon before the death of the aged king, much of what he has accomplished is still admired in a Paris where the Invalides is just being completed and cafés and theatre proliferate. We observe the function of parliaments, tribunals, religious bodies (Capuchins, Jesuits, etc.), public places and their publics (the Tuileries, the Palais Royal), state foundations (the hospital of the Quinze-Vingts (three hundred) for the blind, Invalides for wounded veterans). They describe a buzzing culture, where even the presence of two Persians quickly becomes a popular phenomenon thanks to the proliferation of prints (letter 28 [30]). The café – where debates take place (letter 34 [36]) – has become established as a public institution, as were already the theatre and opera. There are still people foolish enough to search at their own expense for the philosopher&#x27;s stone; the newsmonger and the periodical press are beginning to play a significant role in everyday life. Everything from institutions (the university, the Academy, Sciences, the Bull &quot;Unigenitus&quot;) to groups (fashion, dandies, coquettes) to individuals (the opera singer, the old warrior, the rake, and so forth) comes before the reader&#x27;s eye.

Usbek for his part is troubled by religious comparisons. Though it never occurs to him to cease being a Muslim, and while he still wonders at some aspects of Christianity (the Trinity, communion), he writes to austere authorities to inquire, for example, why some foods are considered to be unclean (letters 15–17 [16–18]). He also assimilates the two religions and even all religions with respect to their social utility.

Certain sequences of letters by a single author develop a particular subject more fully, such as letters 11–14 from Usbek to Mirza about the Troglodytes, letters 109–118 (113–122) from Usbek to Rhedi on demography, letters 128–132 (134–138) from Rica on his visit to the library at Saint-Victor. They sketch numerous analyses that will later be developed in &quot;L’Esprit des lois&quot; for subjects such as the types of power, the influence of climate, and the critique of colonization.

== Sources ==
Montesquieu&#x27;s sources are legion, which doubtless include purely oral transmissions. The impact of Jean Chardin’s &quot;Voyages en Perse&quot;, to which he owes most of his far from superficial information about Persia, must of course be recognized; he owned the two-volume edition of 1687 and purchased the extended edition in ten volumes in 1720. To a lesser degree, he drew on the &quot;Voyages&quot; of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier and Paul Rycaut, not to mention many other works which his vast library afforded him. Everything having to do with contemporary France or Paris, on the other hand, comes essentially from his own experience, or from conversations of anecdotes related to him.

Various aspects of the book are doubtless indebted to particular models, of which the most important is Giovanni Paolo Marana’s &quot;L’Espion dans les cours des princes chrétiens&quot; (&quot;Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy&quot;), widely known at the time, even though Montesquieu’s characters obviously are Persians and not Turks. While the great popularity of Antoine Galland’s &quot;Mille et Une Nuits&quot; (&quot;The Thousand and One Nights&quot;) contributes, as do the Bible and the Qu’ran, to the general ambiance of oriental subjects, in fact it has almost nothing in common with &quot;Lettres persanes&quot;.

== Publication ==
The first edition of the novel, which consisted of 150 letters, appeared in May 1721 under the rubric Cologne: Pierre Marteau, a front for the Amsterdam publisher Jacques Desbordes whose business was now being run by his widow, Susanne de Caux. Referred to as edition A, this is the text utilized in the recent critical edition of &quot;Lettres persanes&quot; (2004) for the ongoing complete works of Montesquieu published in Oxford and Lyon/Paris beginning in 1998. A second edition (B) by the same publisher later in the same year, for which there is so far no entirely satisfactory explanation, curiously included three new letters but omitted thirteen of the original ones. All subsequent editions in the author&#x27;s lifetime derive from one of these two. A posthumous edition in 1758, prepared by Montesquieu&#x27;s son, included eight new letters – bringing the total at that point to 161 – and a short piece by the author entitled &quot;Quelques réflexions sur les &quot;Lettres persanes&quot;&quot;. This edition has been the source of all subsequent editions prior to volume I of the &quot;Œuvres complètes&quot; in 2004, which reverts to the text of the original edition but includes the added letters marked as &quot;supplementary.&quot; Letter references in this article will refer to this edition with, in parentheses, the numbering scheme of 1758.

== Critical history ==
&quot;Lettres persanes&quot; was an immediate and durable sensation and was often imitated, but it has been diversely read over time. Until the middle of the twentieth century, it was the &quot;spirit&quot; of the Regency which was largely admired, as well as the caricature in the classical tradition of La Bruyère, Pascal and Fontenelle. No one thought to attach it to the novelistic genre. The Persian side of the story tended to be considered as a fanciful decor, the true interest of the work lying in its factitious &quot;oriental&quot; impressions of French society, along with political and religious satire and critique.

In the 1950s began a new era of studies based on better texts and renewed research. Particularly important were the extensively annotated edition by Paul Vernière for Classiques Garnier, long the standard edition, and the findings of Robert Shackleton regarding its use of Muslim chronology; also new perspectives by Roger Mercier, Roger Laufer, and Pauline Kra, which put new focus on the work&#x27;s unity and integrated the seraglio into its overall meaning. Others who have followed have looked into the ramifications of epistolary form (Rousset, Laufer, Versini), the structure and meaning of the seraglio (Brady, Singerman), and Usbek&#x27;s purported contradictions. In recent decades it has been religion (Kra) and especially politics (Ehrard, Goulemot, Benrekassa) which predominate, with a progressive return to the role of the seraglio with all its women and eunuchs (Grosrichard, Goldzink, McAlpin, Starobinski, Delon) or the cultural contrast of Orient and Occident.

<text>John Christian Lodge (August 12, 1862 – February 6, 1950) was an American politician who served as the mayor of Detroit, Michigan from 1922 to 1923, in 1924, and from 1927 to 1929. He spent over 30 years on the Detroit City Council.

==Early life==
John C. Lodge was born in Detroit on August 12, 1862, to Dr. Edwin A. Lodge and Christiana Lodge (née Hanson). He attended the Michigan Military Academy in 1881. He worked as a reporter and city editor for the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; from 1889 to 1896. In 1897 he entered the lumber industry, and was connected with the Dwight Lumber Company.

==Political career==
Lodge was the chief clerk for the Wayne County Auditors from 1897 to 1905, then served for two years as the secretary to mayor George P. Codd. He was a member of the Michigan House of Representatives as a Republican from Wayne County&#x27;s 1st district, from 1909 to 1910, and served as chair of the Wayne County Board of Supervisors. He was a member of the Detroit City Council beginning in 1910, and held the position for 17 years before being elected mayor, nine of them as council president. During that time, Lodge served twice as acting mayor: once from December 5, 1922, to April 9, 1923, after James J. Couzens&#x27;s resignation to assume the office of United States Senator, and once from August 2, 1924, to November 21, 1924, after Joseph A. Martin&#x27;s resignation. In 1927, Lodge was elected mayor in his own right, serving from 1927 to 1929. He was defeated in his quest for renomination in 1929. After his stint as mayor, Lodge returned to the city council, serving there from 1932 to 1947.

==Personal life==
Lodge was the great uncle of aviator Charles Lindbergh. Before Lindbergh&#x27;s famed transatlantic flight, he approached Lodge for funding. Lodge declined, convinced his grandnephew faced certain death. Lindbergh would go on to receive funding from supporters in St. Louis, rather than Detroit.

Lodge died on February 6, 1950, and is buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit. After his death, the John C. Lodge Freeway (M-10) in Detroit was named after him.

<text>Goat Rock Beach is a sand beach in northwestern Sonoma County, California, United States.
This landform is a sub-unit of Sonoma Coast State Beach, owned and managed by the State of California. At the northern terminus of Goat Rock Beach is the mouth of the Russian River, and the southern end of this crescent shaped expanse is the massive Goat Rock, an iconic outcrop of the Sonoma Coast, which is barely attached to the mainland by a narrow isthmus.

Goat Rock Beach is frequented by beachcombing visitors, but usually not in high numbers, except in mid-summer; there is some wading and surfing activity, although these uses are moderated by the rip current generated by a steep gradient into the water that leads to an underwater trench parallel to the waterline. The beach is also a regular resting ground for a variety of gulls (including Western Gull, California Gull, and Ring Billed Gull), river otters, elephant seals, harbor seals, and sea lions, with the latter three species often hauling out of the Pacific Ocean. The state of California recommends that a distance be preserved between human visitors and the seasonal marine mammals, especially in the pupping season.

==Vicinity features==

The Russian River, with its mouth at the north end of Goat Rock Beach, is Sonoma County&#x27;s largest watercourse, both in flow rate and lineal extent. Immediately beyond the Russian River discharge to the Pacific Ocean is the coastal town of Jenner. North of the mouth of the Russian River is Jenner Beach. Goat Rock protrudes into the Pacific at the south end of Goat Rock Beach. Visitors can access the base of Goat Rock via a low lying isthmus of land which has been appropriated by the State as a parking area. The almost sheer cliffs of Goat Rock are virtually impossible to scale or to circumnavigate; in fact, signage is posted prohibiting either activity. There is considerable sloughing of broken rock from these vertical surfaces of Goat Rock. Blind Beach is situated immediately south of Goat Rock Beach, the two beaches being separated by Goat Rock itself.
Along Goat Rock Beach and the adjoining beaches, massive rock outcroppings are found both on the shore and protruding from the Pacific Ocean as small skerries. Among these rugged structures are natural arches formed by powerful wave action selectively eroding weaker strata of the rock formations. Approximately to the south is another major geological feature of the Northern California coast known as Bodega Head. Goat Beach lies below and slightly west of State Route 1.

During the summer months, a sandbar is built up along the beach and separates the Russian River from the Pacific Ocean. This sandbar is breached whenever the water levels reach heights between at the Jenner visitor center. Breaching of the sandbar during late fall/early winter splits the beach in two sections. The northern section is protected by the Russian River flowing into the ocean and creates an ideal location for harbor seal pupping.

The Russian River State Marine Reserve and Russian River State Marine Conservation Area protect the Russian River Estuary. Like underwater parks, these marine protected areas help conserve ocean and freshwater wildlife and marine ecosystems.

==Geology==
Goat Rock Beach is subject to continuing marine erosion as well as windborne erosion, thus creating a situation where an average of per year of land mass is lost, except for the hardest of outcrop formations. In winters of heavy storms, this value can be yet higher. Over the last geologic epoch the land has been subject to uplift, a process combined with marine erosion, which has created a marine terrace above the entire extent of the beach. This marine terrace elevation varies approximately above mean sea level, which results in a steep bluff directly above the littoral zone, and a succession of terrace levels.
The sea stacks along the coast at Goat Rock Beach consist of rocks from the Franciscan Complex, formed within an era of plate collision along the western coast of North America. From about 200 to 30 million years ago, the North American Plate was in continual collision with the Farallon Plate. A variety of rock types resulted from this collision, including pillow basalt, chert, and marine sandstone. During the plate collisions, these rocks were considerably faulted and crushed into melange, which is a mixture of ground-up matrix and resistant pockets of rock floating within. When melange is eroded by wave action, the softer part of the matrix is washed away, leaving the more resistant blocks exposed in the ocean as sea stacks. Goat Rock is such a flat topped sea stack consisting of a block of resistant greywacke.
Vertical sea stack formations, a geological hallmark of this shoreline, appear standing out of the water or on the beach resembling sculptures. Occasionally these stacks appear on the marine terrace, indicating their ancient genesis on the sea floor prior to uplift. These rock formations are characteristically composed of sandstone with layers of quartz.

The active San Andreas Fault runs roughly parallel and near to the coastline of Goat Rock Beach. Soils within the site are classified as coastal beach sands (where rocky shoreline is not evident) and escarpment group soils on the marine terrace; typically soils above the marine terrace are in the Rohnerville loam group. Most of the beach sands consist of a medium coarse brown to gray sandy materials, reflecting the high rate of erosion of escarpment soils into the ocean; however, there are patches of dark gray smooth pebble beach such as the approximately stretch lying immediately north of Goat Rock. The beach is changed every year.

==Area history==

The oldest natural history of this area related to mammals manifests in a series of rock outcrops about one third of a mile south of Goat Rock Beach, positioned above the shoreline on a low lying marine terrace. There are uplifted sea stack formations with prominent rubbing marks about in elevation above the ground surface, a height too high to have been caused by modern bovids. Mammoths are believed to have roamed here as recently as 40,000 years ago, and they are thought to have created these severe rubbing marks. Mammoth fossil remains have been found at Bodega Head at the south end of Sonoma Coast State Beach.

The earliest known human settlement of this site was by the Native American Coast Miwok and Pomo tribes. As early as 1849 archaeological discoveries were recorded in the vicinity, and to date several prehistoric kitchen middens and other types of tribal habitation finds have been made. Goat Rock Beach is part of the Mexican land grant rancho Bodega. The Russians are thought to have begun logging the old-growth forests directly above the coastal prairie in the early 19th century.

The underwater delineation of the property is considered to extend to from the shoreline. While no shipwrecks have been discovered, the literature indicates that there are at least 17 vessels which may have been lost in these waters. There are remains of numerous historic barns and other agricultural buildings on the coastal prairie several miles south of Goat Rock Beach, indicating 19th century settlement by Europeans; to the south, at Duncans Landing there are iron pins embedded in the sandstone bluffs as evidence of an active shipping industry here in the late 19th and early 20th century.

In the era circa 1920, a sizeable quarrying was conducted at Goat Rock, which activity produced the apparent separation of Goat Rock from the mainland. Quarry products were transported to the mouth of the Russian River via a now abandoned rail line; some of these materials were used to attempt the construction of a jetty in the mouth area, but that project was eventually terminated.

==Flora and fauna==

There are three distinct habitats present at Goat Rock Beach, including marine, littoral zone and coastal prairie. The marine environment presents gray whales, harbor seals, and California sea lions, as well as a multitude of fish species and other marine organisms; in fact, several species of anadromous fish enter the Russian River estuary and migrate for tens of miles up the Laguna de Santa Rosa and other Russian River tributaries. Furthermore, a variety of pelagic birds and shorebirds are locally in evidence. Additionally, there are modest kelp beds and other marine vegetation. The littoral beach environment has fewer organisms than more southerly zones of California, because of the colder temperatures here.

The coastal prairie soils on the marine terrace above the beach are moderately well drained and granular with moderate soil permeability; these features manifest high erosion potential and moderately high bio-productivity. Acidity of these loamy soils is medium to high, and thus some vegetative stunting and hospitality to rare plants is offered; however, the tree stunting is not as pronounced as farther north along the Mendocino coast, which presents extensive and exaggerated pygmy forests. The upland environment on the coastal prairie offers a range of grass species and wildflowers including varieties of lupine, thistle and wild oats. The typical annual plant productivity is approximately per acre of air dried yield per annum in an abundant moisture year, and about half that amount in a very dry year. A variety of birds and mammals thrive on the coastal prairie including numerous California Mule Deer, &quot;Odocoileus hemionus californicus&quot;.

==Rules and facilities==

Due to the potential safety risks of strong rip currents and sneaker waves at Goat Rock Beach, swimming is strictly prohibited. There are restroom facilities, a parking lot, and picnic tables on site. Hang-gliding is permitted from a high launch point on a high marine terrace above the southern part of Goat Rock Beach, provided the participant is in possession of USHGA card, Sonoma Wings card, and signed waiver card.

==Popular culture==
*The naming of Goat Rock is disputed, but many accounts indicate some goatherds circa early 20th century used the flat grassy top of the formation for grazing goats, since few other species could scale the steep slopes.
*Goat Rock Beach polled as the second most popular beach venue in Sonoma County with readers of &quot;Metroactive&quot;.
*A group of boulders known as Sunset Boulders near the entrance road is popular with local climbers. Many top rope and bouldering problems exist, ranging from 5.2 to V10.
*Goat Rock Beach, looking towards Arched Rock, was used to portray Cauldron Point in the final scene of the 1985 cult movie &quot;The Goonies&quot;, with the Inferno, the ship of &quot;One-Eyed Willy&quot; seen in the distance, sailing away.

<text>Frisanco () is a town and (municipality) in the Regional decentralization entity of Pordenone in the region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, north-eastern Italy. Its (borough) of Poffabro is one of (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;).

==History==
As early as 1492 a church stood in the center of the village.

A fire swept through the mountain village in 1606, destroying much of the town including all of the town&#x27;s public and religious records. In the archives of the Curia of Udine there are the documents from 1648 to 1650 regarding a trial of the inquisition against witches who were said to meet for sabbats in the meadow of Malgustât, behind Mt. Raut. In one document it is written that the, &quot;village of Frisanco in particular is said to be the witches’ nest&quot;.

On 28 September 1810 by Napoleonic decree Frisanco became the administrative center of the Val Colvera which included annexing Poffabro.

==Main sights==
*Palazzo Pognici, built in 1600. It has its own square and fountain.
*Di Lorenzo Courtyard has a Christian fresco which dates back to June 6, 1782.
*The current church&#x27;s bell tower was completed in 1901 and it rises high above the small clusters of buildings which makes up the town made of two and three story buildings.
==Culture==

As of 2007, there is an annual circus arts festival, &quot;Brocante&quot;, based in Frisanco. There are shows in Frisanco and neighboring villages. The festival takes place in late July and lasts for four days, ending with a parade through the older parts of Frisanco.

==Villages==
Colvere (&quot;Colvuri&quot; in Friulian) lies in the Val Colvera, and takes its name from the stream. It has five &quot;borghi&quot; (boroughs), Gobbo and Cudili on the west bank of the Colvera, Fornasatte, Polàz and Mènis on the east bank. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the west bank was mostly settled by people from Casasola, and from Poffabro on the west bank.

<doc id="1287679" wikidata="Q1132805" url="?curid=1287679" title="Proca action">
<text>In physics, specifically field theory and particle physics, the Proca action describes a massive spin-1 field of mass &quot;m&quot; in Minkowski spacetime. The corresponding equation is a relativistic wave equation called the Proca equation. The Proca action and equation are named after Romanian physicist Alexandru Proca.

The Proca equation is involved in the Standard Model and describes there the three massive vector bosons, i.e. the Z and W bosons.

This article uses the (+−−−) metric signature and tensor index notation in the language of 4-vectors.

==Lagrangian density==

The field involved is a complex 4-potential formula_1, where formula_2 is a kind of generalized electric potential and formula_3 is a generalized magnetic potential. The field formula_4 transforms like a complex four-vector.

The Lagrangian density is given by:

:formula_5

where formula_6 is the speed of light in vacuum, formula_7 is the reduced Planck constant, and formula_8 is the 4-gradient.

==Equation==

The Euler–Lagrange equation of motion for this case, also called the Proca equation, is:

:formula_9

which is conjugate equivalent to

:formula_10

and with formula_11 (the massless case) reduces to

:formula_12

which may be called a generalized Lorenz gauge condition. For non-zero sources, with all fundamental constants included, the field equation is:

:formula_13

When formula_14 the source free equations reduce to Maxwell&#x27;s equations without charge or current, and the above reduces to Maxwell&#x27;s charge equation. This Proca field equation is closely related to the Klein–Gordon equation, because it is second order in space and time.

In the vector calculus notation, the source free equations are:

:formula_15
:formula_16

and formula_17 is the D&#x27;Alembert operator.

==Gauge fixing==

The Proca action is the gauge-fixed version of the Stueckelberg action via the Higgs mechanism. Quantizing the Proca action requires the use of second class constraints.

If formula_18 they are not invariant under the gauge transformations of electromagnetism

:formula_19

where formula_20 is an arbitrary function.

<text>The sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus), grey/gray nurse shark (in Australia), spotted ragged-tooth shark (in South Africa), or blue-nurse sand tiger, is a species of shark that inhabits subtropical and temperate waters worldwide. It inhabits the continental shelf, from sandy shorelines (hence the name sand tiger shark) and submerged reefs to a depth of around . They dwell in the waters of Japan, Australia, South Africa, and the east coasts of North and South America. The sand tiger shark also inhabited the Mediterranean, however it was last seen there in 2003 and is presumed extinct in the region. Despite its common names, it is not closely related to either the tiger shark (&quot;Galeocerdo cuvier&quot;) or the nurse shark (&quot;Ginglymostoma cirratum&quot;).

Despite its fearsome appearance and strong swimming ability, it is a relatively placid and slow-moving shark with no confirmed human fatalities. This species has a sharp, pointy head, and a bulky body. The sand tiger&#x27;s length can reach but is normally 2.2–2.5 m in length. They are grey with reddish-brown spots on their backs. Shivers (groups) have been observed to hunt large schools of fish. Their diet consists of bony fish, crustaceans, squid, skates and other sharks. Unlike other sharks, the sand tiger can gulp air from the surface, allowing it to be suspended in the water column with minimal effort. During pregnancy, the most developed embryo will feed on its siblings, a reproductive strategy known as intrauterine cannibalism i.e. &quot;embryophagy&quot; or, more colorfully, adelphophagy—literally &quot;eating one&#x27;s brother&quot;. The sand tiger is categorized as critically endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List. It is the most widely kept large shark in public aquariums owing to its tolerance for captivity.

==Taxonomy==
The sand tiger shark&#x27;s description as &quot;Carcharias taurus&quot; by Constantine Rafinesque came from a specimen caught off the coast of Sicily. &quot;Carcharias taurus&quot; means &quot;bull shark&quot;. This taxonomic classification has been long disputed. Twenty-seven years after Rafinesque&#x27;s original description the German biologists Müller and Henle changed the genus name from &quot;C. taurus&quot; to &quot;Triglochis taurus&quot;. The following year, Swiss-American naturalist Jean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz reclassified the shark as &quot;Odontaspis cuspidata&quot; based on examples of fossilized teeth. Agassiz&#x27;s name was used until 1961 when three palaeontologists and ichthyologists, W. Tucker, E. I. White, and N. B. Marshall, requested that the shark be returned to the genus &quot;Carcharias&quot;. This request was rejected and &quot;Odontaspis&quot; was approved by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). When experts concluded that &quot;taurus&quot; belongs after &quot;Odontaspis&quot;, the name was changed to &quot;Odontaspis taurus&quot;. In 1977, Compagno and Follet challenged the &quot;Odontaspis taurus&quot; name and substituted &quot;Eugomphodus&quot;, a somewhat unknown classification, for &quot;Odontaspis&quot;. Many taxonomists questioned his change, arguing that there was no significant difference between &quot;Odontaspis&quot; and &quot;Carcharias&quot;. After changing the name to &quot;Eugomphodus taurus&quot;, Compagno successfully advocated in establishing the shark&#x27;s current scientific name as &quot;Carcharias taurus&quot;. The ICZN approved this name, and today it is used among biologists.

==Common names==
Because the sand tiger shark is worldwide in distribution, it has many common names. The term &quot;sand tiger shark&quot; actually refers to four different sand tiger shark species in the family Odontaspididae. Furthermore, the name creates confusion with the unrelated tiger shark &quot;Galeocerdo cuvier&quot;. The &quot;grey nurse shark&quot;, the name used in Australia, is the second-most used name for the shark, and in India it is known as &quot;blue-nurse sand tiger&quot;. However, there are unrelated nurse sharks in the family Ginglymostomatidae. The most unambiguous and descriptive English name is probably the South African one, &quot;spotted ragged-tooth shark&quot;.

==Identification==

There are four species referred to as sand tiger sharks:
# The sand tiger shark &quot;Carcharias taurus&quot;
# The Indian sand tiger shark &quot;Carcharias tricuspidatus&quot;. Very little is known about this species which, described before 1900, is probably the same as (a synonym of) the sand tiger &quot;C. taurus&quot;
# The small-toothed sand tiger shark &quot;Odontaspis ferox&quot;. This species has a worldwide distribution, is seldom seen but normally inhabits deeper water than does &quot;C. taurus&quot;.
# The Big-eyed sand tiger shark &quot;Odontaspis noronhai&quot;, a deep water shark of the Americas, of which little is known.

The most likely problem when identifying the sand tiger shark is when in the presence of either of the two species of &quot;Odontaspis&quot;. Firstly, the sand tiger is usually spotted, especially on the hind half of the body. However, there are several other differences that are probably more reliable:
# The bottom part of the caudal fin (tail fin) of the sand tiger is smaller.
# The second (i.e., hind) dorsal fin of the sand tiger is almost as large as the first (i.e., front) dorsal fin.
# The first (i.e., front) dorsal fin of the sand tiger is relatively non-symmetric. 
# The first (i.e., front) dorsal fin of the sand tiger is closer to the pelvic fin than to the pectoral fin (i.e., the first dorsal fin is positioned further backwards in the case of the sand tiger).

==Description==
Adult sand tigers range from to in length with most specimens reaching a length of around 2.2–2.5 m and to in weight. The head is pointy, as opposed to round, while the snout is flattened with a conical shape. Its body is stout and bulky and its mouth extends beyond the eyes. The eyes of the sand tiger shark are small, lacking eyelids. A sand tiger usually swims with its mouth open displaying three rows of protruding, smooth-edged, sharp-pointed teeth. The males have grey claspers with white tips located on the underside of their body. The caudal fin is elongated with a long upper lobe (i.e. strongly heterocercal). They have two large, broad-based grey dorsal fins set back beyond the pectoral fins. The sand tiger shark has a grey-brown back and pale underside. Adults tend to have reddish-brown spots scattered, mostly on the hind part of the body. In August 2007, an albino specimen was photographed off South West Rocks, Australia. The teeth of these sharks have no transverse serrations (as have many other sharks) but they have a large, smooth main cusp with a tiny cusplet on each side of the main cusp. The upper front teeth are separated from the teeth on the side of the mouth by small intermediate teeth.

==Habitat and range==

===Geographical range===

Sand tiger sharks roam the epipelagic and mesopelagic regions of the ocean, sandy coastal waters, estuaries, shallow bays, and rocky or tropical reefs, at depths of up to .

The sand tiger shark can be found in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans, and in the Adriatic Seas. In the Western Atlantic Ocean, it is found in coastal waters around from the Gulf of Maine to Florida, in the northern Gulf of Mexico, around the Bahamas and Bermuda, and from southern Brazil to northern Argentina. It is also found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean from the Mediterranean Sea to the Canary Islands, at the Cape Verde islands, along the coasts of Senegal and Ghana, and from southern Nigeria to Cameroon. In the western Indian Ocean, the shark ranges from South Africa to southern Mozambique, but excluding Madagascar. The sand tiger shark has also been sighted in the Red Sea and may be found as far east as India. In the western Pacific, it has been sighted in the waters around the coasts of Japan and Australia, but not around New Zealand.

===Annual migration===
Sand tigers in South Africa and Australia undertake an annual migration that may cover more than . They pup during the summer in relatively cold water (temperature ca. ). After parturition, they swim northwards toward sites where there are suitable rocks or caves, often at a water depth ca. , where they mate during and just after the winter. Mating normally takes place at night. After mating, they swim further north to even warmer water where gestation takes place. In autumn they return southwards to give birth in cooler water. This round trip may encompass as much as . The young sharks do not take part in this migration, but they are absent from the normal birth grounds during winter: it is thought that they move deeper into the ocean. At Cape Cod (USA), juveniles move away from coastal areas when water temperatures decreases below 16 °C and day length decreases to less than 12 h. Juveniles, however, return to their usual summer haunts and as they become mature they start larger migratory movements.

==Behavior==

===Hunting===
The sand tiger shark is a nocturnal feeder. During the day, they take shelter near rocks, overhangs, caves and reefs often at relatively shallow depths (&lt;20 m). This is the typical environment where divers encounter sand tigers, hovering just above the bottom in large sandy gutters and caves. However, at night they leave the shelter and hunt over the ocean bottom, often ranging far from their shelter. Sand tigers hunt by stealth. It is the only shark known to gulp air and store it in the stomach, allowing the shark to maintain near-neutral buoyancy which helps it to hunt motionlessly and quietly. Aquarium observations indicate that when it comes close enough to a prey item, it grabs with a quick sideways snap of the prey. The sand tiger shark has been observed to gather in hunting groups when preying upon large schools of fish.

===Diet ===

The majority of prey items of sand tigers are demersal (i.e. from the sea bottom), suggesting that they hunt extensively on the sea bottom as far out as the continental shelf. Bony fish (teleosts) form about 60% of sand tigers&#x27; food, the remaining prey comprising sharks, skates, other rays, lobsters, crabs and squid. In Argentina, the prey includes mostly demersal fishes, e.g. the striped weakfish (&quot;Cynoscion guatucupa&quot;) and whitemouth croaker (&quot;Micropogonias furnieri&quot;). The most important elasmobranch prey is the bottom-living narrownose smooth-hound shark (&quot;Mustelus schmitti.&quot;). Benthic (i.e. free-swimming) rays and skates are also taken, including fanskates, eagle rays and the angular angel shark, with larger individuals feeding on a higher number of benthic elasmobranchs than smaller individuals. Stomach content analysis indicates that smaller sand tigers mainly focus on the sea bottom and as they grow larger they start to take more pelagic prey. This perspective of the diet of sand tigers is consistent with similar observations in the north west Atlantic and in South Africa where large sand tigers capture a wider range of shark and skate species as prey, from the surf zone to the continental shelf, indicating the opportunistic nature of sand tiger feeding. Off South Africa, sand tigers less than in length prey on fish about a quarter of their own length; however, large sand tigers capture prey up to about half of their own length. The prey items are usually swallowed as three or four chunks.

===Courtship and mating===
Mating occurs around the months of August and December
in the northern hemisphere and during August–October in the southern hemisphere. The courtship and mating of sand tigers has been best documented from observations in large aquaria. In Oceanworld, Sydney, the females tended to hover just above the sandy bottom (&quot;shielding&quot;) when they were receptive. This prevented males from approaching from underneath towards their cloaca. Often there is more than one male close by with the dominant one remaining close to the female, intimidating others with an aggressive display in which the dominant shark closely follows the tail of the subordinate, forcing the subordinate to accelerate and swim away. The dominant male snaps at smaller fish of other species. The male approaches the female and the two sharks protect the sandy bottom over which they interact. Strong interest of the male is indicated by superficial bites in the anal and pectoral fin areas of the female. The female responds with superficial biting of the male. This behaviour continues for several days during which the male patrols the area around the female. The male regularly approaches the female in &quot;nosing&quot; behaviour to &quot;smell&quot; the cloaca of the female. If she is ready, she swims off with the male, while both partners contort their bodies so that the right clasper of the male enters the cloaca of the female. The male bites the base of her right pectoral fin, leaving scars that are easily visible afterwards. After one or two minutes, mating is complete and the two separate. Females often mate with more than one male. Females mate only every second or third year. After mating, the females remain behind, while the males move off to seek other areas to feed, resulting in many observations of sand tiger populations comprising almost exclusively females.

==Reproduction and growth==
===Reproduction===

The reproductive pattern is similar to that of many of the Odontaspididae, the shark family to which sand tigers belong. Female sand tigers have two uterine horns that, during early embryonic development, may have as many as 50 embryos that obtain nutrients from their yolk sacs and possibly consume uterine fluids. When one of the embryos reaches some in length, it eats all the smaller embryos so that only one large embryo remains in each uterine horn, a process called intrauterine cannibalism i.e. &quot;embryophagy&quot; or, more colorfully, adelphophagy—literally &quot;eating one&#x27;s brother.&quot; While multiple male sand tigers commonly fertilize a single female, adelphophagy sometimes excludes all but one of them from gaining offspring. These surviving embryos continue to feed on a steady supply of unfertilised eggs. After a lengthy labour, the female gives birth to long, fully independent offspring. The gestation period is approximately eight to twelve months. These sharks give birth only every second or third year, resulting in an overall mean reproductive rate of less than one pup per year, one of the lowest reproductive rates for sharks.

===Growth===

In the north Atlantic, sand tiger sharks are born about 1 m in length. During the first year, they grow about 27 cm to reach 1.3 m. After that, the growth rate decreases by about 2.5 cm each year until it stabilises at about 7 cm/y. Males reach sexual maturity at an age of five to seven years and approximately in length. Females reach maturity when approximately long at about seven to ten years of age. They are normally not expected to reach lengths over 3 m and lengths around 2.2–2.5 is more common. In the informal media, such as YouTube, there have been several reports of sand tigers around 5 m long, but none of these have been verified scientifically.

==Interaction with humans==

===Attacks on humans===
As of 2023, the Florida Museum&#x27;s International Shark Attack File lists 36 unprovoked, non-fatal attacks by sand tiger sharks.

Over the weekend of 4 July 2023, there were four attacks attributed to sand tiger sharks in New York, USA. This followed a recent spike in shark attacks in New York state, with 13 incidents reported over a two-year period.

===Nets around swimming beaches===

In Australia and South Africa, one of the common practices in beach holiday areas is to erect shark nets around the beaches frequently used by swimmers. These nets are erected some from the shore and act as gill nets that trap incoming sharks: this was the norm until about 2005. In South Africa, the mortality of sand tiger sharks caused a significant decrease in the length of these animals and it was concluded that the shark nets pose a significant threat to this species with its very low reproductive rate Before 2000, these nets snagged about 200 sand tiger sharks per year in South Africa, of which only about 40% survived and were released alive. The efficiency of shark nets for the prevention of unprovoked shark attacks on bathers has been questioned, and since 2000 there has been a reduced use of these nets and alternative approaches are being developed.

===Competition for food with humans===

In Argentina, the prey items of sand tigers largely coincided with important commercial fisheries targets. Humans affect sand tiger food availability and the sharks, in turn, compete with humans for food that, in turn, has already been heavily exploited by the fisheries industry. The same applies to the bottom-living sea catfish (&quot;Galeichthys feliceps&quot;), a fisheries resource off the South African coast.

===Effects of scuba divers===

A study near Sydney in Australia found that the behaviour of the sharks is affected by the proximity of scuba divers. Diver activity affects the aggregation, swimming and respiratory behaviour of sharks, but only at short time scales. The group size of scuba divers was less important in affecting sand tiger behaviour than the distance within which they approached the sharks. Divers approaching to within 3 m of sharks affected their behaviour but after the divers had retreated, the sharks resumed normal behaviour. Other studies indicate sand tiger sharks can be indifferent to divers. Scuba divers are normally compliant with Australian shark-diving regulations.

===In captivity===

Its large and menacing appearance, combined with its relative placidity, has made the sand tiger shark among the most popular shark species to be displayed in public aquaria. However, as with all large sharks, keeping them in captivity is not without its difficulties. Sand tiger sharks have been found to be highly susceptible to developing spinal deformities, with as many as one in every three captive sharks being affected, giving them a hunched appearance. These deformities have been hypothesized to be correlated to both the size and shape of their tank. If the tank is too small, the sharks have to spend more time actively swimming than they would in the wild, where they have space to glide. Also, sharks in small, circular tanks often spend most of their time circling along the edges in only one direction, causing asymmetrical stress on their bodies.

==Threats and conservation status==

===Threats===
There are several factors contributing to the decline in the population of the sand tigers. Sand tigers reproduce at an unusually low rate, due to the fact that they do not have more than two pups at a time and because they breed only every second or third year. This shark is a highly prized food item in the western northern Pacific, off Ghana and off India and Pakistan where they are caught by fishing trawlers, although they are more commonly caught with a fishing line. Sand tigers&#x27; fins are a popular trade item in Japan. Off North America, it is fished for its hide and fins. Shark liver oil is a popular product in cosmetic products such as lipstick. It is sought by anglers in fishing competitions in South Africa and some other countries. In Australia it has been reduced in numbers by spear fishers using poison and where it is now protected. It is also prized as an aquarium exhibit in the United States, Europe, Australia and South Africa because of its docile and hardy nature. Thus, overfishing is a major contributor to the population decline. All indications show that the world population in sand tigers has been reduced significantly in size since 1980. Many sand tigers are caught in shark nets, and then either strangled or taken by fishermen. Estuaries along the United States of America&#x27;s eastern Atlantic coast houses many of the young sand tiger sharks. These estuaries are susceptible to non-point source pollution that is harmful to the pups. In Eastern Australia, the breeding population was estimated to be fewer than 400 reproductively mature animals, a number believed to be too small to sustain a healthy population.

===Conservation status===

This species is therefore listed as Critically Endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List, and as &quot;endangered&quot; under Queensland&#x27;s Nature Conservation Act 1992. It is a U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service &quot;[Species of Concern]&quot;, which are those species that the U.S. Government&#x27;s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), has some concerns regarding status and threats, but for which insufficient information is available to indicate a need to list the species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. According to the National Marine Fisheries Service, any shark caught must be released immediately with minimal harm, and is considered a prohibited species, making it illegal to harvest any part of the sand tiger shark on the United States&#x27; Atlantic coast.

A recent report from the Pew Charitable Trusts suggests that a new management approach used for large mammals that have suffered population declines could hold promise for sharks. Because of the life-history characteristics of sharks, conventional fisheries management approaches, such as reaching maximum sustainable yield, may not be sufficient to rebuild depleted shark populations. Some of the more stringent approaches used to reverse declines in large mammals may be appropriate for sharks, including prohibitions on the retention of the most vulnerable species and regulation of international trade.

<doc id="1287699" wikidata="Q208429" url="?curid=1287699" title="1984 (Van Halen album)">
<text>1984 (stylized in Roman numerals as MCMLXXXIV) is the sixth studio album by American rock band Van Halen, released on January 9, 1984. It was the last Van Halen studio album until &quot;A Different Kind of Truth&quot; (2012) to feature lead singer David Lee Roth, who left the band in 1985 following creative differences. This is the final full-length album to feature all four original members (the Van Halen brothers Eddie and Alex, Roth, and Michael Anthony), although they reunited briefly in 2000 to start work on what would much later become 2012&#x27;s &quot;A Different Kind of Truth&quot;. Roth returned in 2007, but Eddie&#x27;s son Wolfgang replaced Anthony in 2006. &quot;1984&quot; and Van Halen&#x27;s self-titled debut album are the band&#x27;s best-selling albums, each having sold more than 10 million copies in the United States.

&quot;1984&quot; was well received by music critics. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album number 81 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Albums of the 1980s&quot;. It reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and remained there for five weeks, kept off the top spot by Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot;, on which guitarist Eddie Van Halen made a guest performance. &quot;1984&quot; produced four singles, including &quot;Jump&quot;, Van Halen&#x27;s only number-one single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; the top-20 hits &quot;Panama&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Wait&quot;; and the MTV favorite &quot;Hot for Teacher&quot;. The album was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1999 for ten million shipped copies in the U.S.

==Background and recording==

Following the tour in support of their fourth studio album, &quot;Fair Warning&quot;, the band initially wanted to slow down and take a break. They released just one single, &quot;(Oh) Pretty Woman&quot;/&quot;Happy Trails&quot;, intended to be a stand-alone release. However, the band&#x27;s label asked for another album due to the A-side&#x27;s success and the band recorded their fifth studio album, &quot;Diver Down&quot;, very quickly. Following the recording of the album, guitarist Eddie Van Halen was dissatisfied by the concessions he had made to Van Halen frontman David Lee Roth and Warner Bros. producer Ted Templeman. Both discouraged Eddie from making keyboards a prominent instrument in the band&#x27;s music.

By 1983, Eddie was in the process of building his own studio, naming it 5150 after the California law code for the temporary, involuntary psychiatric commitment of individuals (who present a danger to themselves or others due to signs of mental illness), with Donn Landee, the band&#x27;s longtime engineer (and later, producer on the &quot;5150&quot; and &quot;OU812&quot; recordings). While boards and tape machines were being installed, Eddie began working on synthesizers to pass the time. &quot;There were no presets,&quot; said Templeman. &quot;He would just twist off until it sounded right.&quot; There, he composed Van Halen&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;Diver Down&quot; without as much perceived &quot;interference&quot; from Roth or Templeman. The result was a compromise between the two creative factions in the band: a mixture of keyboard-heavy songs, and the guitar-driven hard rock for which the band was known. &quot;1984&quot; was the longest-in-the-making album of the band&#x27;s career to date, taking about three months to record, compared to most of their previous LPs taking less than two weeks, and their first LP taking only five days, all at Sunset Studios.

In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s retrospective review of 1984 in its &#x27;100 Best Albums of the Eighties&#x27; list, Templeman said, &quot;It&#x27;s real obvious to me [why 1984 won Van Halen a broader and larger audience]. Eddie Van Halen discovered the synthesizer.&quot;

==Artwork==
The album cover art was directed by Richard Seireeni and Pete Angelus, and the cover art was painted by graphic artist Margo Nahas. Seireeni, then Creative Director at Warner Bros. Records, had collected a number of artist portfolios for the band to review. Among those was the work of Margo Nahas. Nahas had initially been asked to create a cover that featured four chrome women dancing, but declined due to the creative difficulties. The band reviewed her work once again, and from her previously created material they chose the painting of a putto smoking cigarettes that was used. The model was Carter Helm, who was the child of one of Nahas&#x27; best friends, whom she photographed holding a candy cigarette. The front cover was censored in the UK at the time of the album&#x27;s release. It featured a sticker that obscured the cigarette in the putto&#x27;s hand and the pack of cigarettes. The back cover features all four band members individually with &quot;1984&quot; in a green futuristic typeface.

==Composition==
Musically, &quot;1984&quot; has been described as glam/pop metal, hard rock, heavy metal, synth rock, and pop rock. Michael Hann of &quot;The Quietus&quot; comments that the album sees Van Halen become &quot;everything all at once – synthpop, hard rock, thundering metal, art rock&quot;, citing &quot;Top Jimmy&quot; as an example of the latter, with its guitar lines being comparable to Talking Heads. The album&#x27;s first two singles, &quot;Jump&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Wait&quot;, feature prominent synthesizers, as does the album&#x27;s intro track, &quot;1984&quot;, a one-minute instrumental. Eddie Van Halen played an Oberheim OB-Xa synthesizer on the album except for “I’ll Wait” which was recorded with the newer Oberheim OB-8. The reason for this is that Ed&#x27;s OB-Xa was having an issue staying in tune and while it was being repaired he was sent the newer model OB-8 (which was featured prominently on future Van Halen albums).

Van Halen became stuck while writing the song &quot;I&#x27;ll Wait&quot;, and producer Ted Templeman suggested that Michael McDonald (with whom Templeman had worked extensively during McDonald&#x27;s career with The Doobie Brothers) could help them. Templeman sent McDonald a copy of Van Halen&#x27;s instrumental demo of the song, and after getting some ideas, he met with David Lee Roth in Templeman&#x27;s office, where the two of them worked out the lyrics and melodies.

Eddie Van Halen stated he wrote the arrangement for &quot;Jump&quot; several years before &quot;1984&quot; was recorded. In a 1995 cover story in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, the guitarist said Roth had rejected the synth riff for &quot;Jump&quot; for at least two years before agreeing to write lyrics to it. In his memoir &quot;Crazy from the Heat&quot;, Roth confirms Eddie&#x27;s account, admitting a preference for Van Halen&#x27;s guitar work; however, he says he now enjoys the song. Additionally in his memoir, Roth writes that he wrote the lyrics to &quot;Jump&quot; after watching a man waffle as to whether to commit suicide by jumping off a skyscraper.

The album&#x27;s third single was &quot;Panama&quot;, which features a heavy guitar riff reminiscent of Van Halen&#x27;s earlier work. The engine noise was from Eddie revving up his Lamborghini, with microphones used near the tailpipes. Later, a video of &quot;Hot for Teacher&quot; was released and played regularly on MTV, giving the band a fourth hit which sustained sales of the album.

Other songs on &quot;1984&quot; included &quot;Girl Gone Bad&quot;, parts of which previously had been played during the 1982 tour amidst performances of &quot;Somebody Get Me a Doctor&quot; (including the US Festival show), the hard rock &quot;Drop Dead Legs&quot;, and &quot;Top Jimmy&quot;, a tribute to James Paul Koncek of the band Top Jimmy &amp; The Rhythm Pigs. The album concludes with &quot;House of Pain&quot;, a heavy metal song that dates back to the band&#x27;s early club days of the mid-1970s.

Eddie Van Halen told an interviewer that &quot;Girl Gone Bad&quot; was written in a hotel room that he and then-wife Valerie Bertinelli had rented. Bertinelli was asleep, and Van Halen woke up during the night with an idea he had to put on tape. Not wanting to wake Bertinelli, Van Halen grabbed a cassette recorder and recorded himself playing guitar in the closet.

==Release==
&quot;1984&quot; peaked at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (behind Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot;, which featured an Eddie Van Halen guitar solo on &quot;Beat It&quot;), and remained in that spot for 5 consecutive weeks. It contained the anthems &quot;Jump&quot;, &quot;Panama&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Wait&quot;, and &quot;Hot for Teacher&quot;. &quot;Jump&quot; reached number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;1984&quot; is the second of two Van Halen albums to have achieved RIAA Diamond status, selling over ten million copies in the United States. Their debut &quot;Van Halen&quot; was the first. &quot;Jump&quot; went on to be certified Gold in April 1984, only months after the album&#x27;s release.

The album&#x27;s follow-up singles – the synth-driven &quot;I&#x27;ll Wait&quot;, and &quot;Panama&quot;, each peaked at &quot;Billboard&quot; number 13 on the Pop charts, respectively, in March and June. &quot;Hot for Teacher&quot; was a moderate &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 success, reaching number 56; the MTV video for &quot;Hot for Teacher&quot; became even more popular. The &quot;Hot for Teacher&quot; video, which was directed by Roth, stars preteen lookalikes of the four Van Halen band members; a stereotypical nerd named &quot;Waldo&quot;; David Lee Roth as Waldo&#x27;s bus driver; and numerous teachers stripping.

To promote the album, the band ran a contest on MTV. The contest was called, &quot;Lost Weekend&quot; with Van Halen. Fans mailed over 1 million postcards to MTV in hopes of winning the contest. In the promo for MTV, David Lee Roth said, &quot;You won&#x27;t know where you are, you won&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going to happen, and when you come back, you&#x27;re not gonna have any memory of it.&quot; Kurt Jeffries won the contest and was flown to Detroit to join the band. Jeffries was allowed to bring along his best friend. He was given a Lost Weekend T-shirt and a hat. He was also brought on stage and had a large sheet cake smashed in his face which was followed by about a dozen people pouring champagne on him.

==Songwriting credits==
The UK single release for &quot;I&#x27;ll Wait&quot; credited Michael McDonald as a co-writer, but he was not credited on the US version. The ASCAP entry for &quot;I&#x27;ll Wait&quot; lists Michael McDonald as co-writer with Roth and the Van Halen members.

After the release of &quot;Best Of – Volume I&quot; (1996), Van Halen renegotiated their royalties with their label Warner Bros. In 2004, Roth discovered that the rest of the band had renegotiated a royalty rate five times greater than his for releases made during his time as lead singer.

Songs from &quot;1984&quot; that appear on compilations after the royalty renegotiation and Roth&#x27;s lawsuit were credited to Edward Van Halen, Alex Van Halen, and David Lee Roth, with Michael Anthony&#x27;s name removed from the credits, as evident in the end song credits of the 2007 film &quot;Superbad&quot;.

Michael Anthony&#x27;s longstanding bass technician Kevin Dugan has noted that the opening title track instrumental from the album originates from a Roland bass synthesizer passage created as an intro for Anthony&#x27;s in-concert bass solos, and has claimed that he and Anthony wrote and programmed it together.

==Critical reception==
Reviews for &quot;1984&quot; were generally favorable. Robert Christgau rated the album a B+. He explained that &quot;Side one is pure &#x27;up&#x27;, and not only that, it sticks to the ears&quot; and that &quot;Van Halen&#x27;s pop move avoids fluff because they&#x27;re heavy, and schlock because they&#x27;re built for speed, finally creating an all-purpose mise-en-scene for Brother Eddie&#x27;s hair-raising, stomach-churning chops.&quot; He also called side two &quot;consolation for their loyal fans—a little sexism, a lot of pyrotechnics, and a standard HM bass attack on something called &#x27;House of Pain&#x27;.&quot; J.D. Considine, a reviewer for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, rated &quot;1984&quot; four out of five stars. He called it &quot;the album that brings all of Van Halen&#x27;s talent into focus.&quot; He stated that &quot;&quot;Jump&quot; is not exactly the kind of song you&#x27;d expect from Van Halen&quot;, but that &quot;once Alex Van Halen&#x27;s drums kick in and singer David Lee Roth starts to unravel a typically convoluted story line, things start sounding a little more familiar&quot;. Although he mentioned &quot;Jump&quot; as having &quot;suspended chords and a pedalpoint bass in a manner more suited to Asia&quot;, he went on to state that &quot;Eddie Van Halen manages to expand his repertoire of hot licks, growls, screams and seemingly impossible runs to wilder frontiers than you could have imagined.&quot; He concluded that &quot;what really makes this record work is the fact that Van Halen uses all this flash as a means to an end—driving the melody home—rather than as an end in itself&quot; and that &quot;despite all the bluster, Van Halen is one of the smartest, toughest bands in rock &amp; roll. Believe me, that&#x27;s no newspeak.&quot;

In a 1984 review, &quot;Billboard&quot; states the album is &quot;funnier and more versatile than most of their metal brethren&quot;, calling the production &quot;typically strong&quot;. A retrospective review by AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine was extremely positive. He noted that the album caused &quot;a hoopla that was a bit of a red herring since the band had been layering in synths since their third album, &quot;Women and Children First&quot;&quot;. He further stated that &quot;Jump&quot;&#x27;s &quot;synths played a circular riff that wouldn&#x27;t have sounded as overpowering on guitar&quot;, but that &quot;the band didn&#x27;t dispense with their signature monolithic, pulsating rock.&quot; He also stated that &quot;where [previous] albums placed an emphasis on the band&#x27;s attack, this places an emphasis on the songs.&quot; In &quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot; (2004), Martin C. Strong opines that &quot;1984&quot; &quot;saw Van Halen successfully tackling obligatory 80&#x27;s experimentation&quot;. In his book &quot;Copendium&quot; (2012), Julian Cope described &quot;1984&quot; as a &quot;curious&quot; record which &quot;expected us to accept the wholsesale metaphor change from Guitar Eddie to Synth Eddie and suck on &#x27;Jump&#x27;″s Genesis-plays-the-Who-by-numbers.&quot;

&quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine writer Matt Blackett praises the &quot;deeper cuts&quot; of the album, &quot;Drop Dead Legs&quot;, &quot;House of Pain&quot;, and &quot;Girl Gone Bad&quot;, calling the guitar work &quot;fresh and vital&quot;, noting Eddie&#x27;s &quot;dark, complex sense of harmony and melody&quot;. Len Comaratta from &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; felt Van Halen reached the pinnacle of its commercial and critical success. At the end of the 1980s, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, which had previously been critical of Van Halen, ranked &quot;1984&quot; at number 81 on its list of the 100 Greatest Albums of the 1980s. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine placed the album on their list of &quot;New Sensations: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1984&quot;. In 1991, Chuck Eddy ranked the album 12th in his book of the 500 best heavy metal albums. He praised it as &quot;pop cock-rock&quot; that spanned showy crescendos (&quot;Girl Gone Bad&quot;), &quot;space age symphonics&quot; (&quot;1984&quot;), &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot;-style electronics (&quot;Jump&quot;), drum solos comparable to Kenny Aronoff joining Motörhead (&quot;Hot for Teacher&quot;), &quot;Betty Boop with her top down&quot; (&quot;Panama&quot;), and &quot;unrooted tributes to roots bands&quot; (&quot;Top Jimmy&quot;), overall saying: &quot;It was pure avant-garde vaudeville, it was pure Hollywood, it was a chorus line in bed with the chainsaw massacre.&quot;

Following the death of lead guitarist Eddie Van Halen in October 2020, &quot;1984&quot; saw a brief resurgence to the charts.

==Track listing==

<text>SS. Cyril and Methodius Seminary was a four-year private Polish seminary in Orchard Lake, Michigan, United States. The seminary, taking its name from Saints Cyril and Methodius, was founded in 1885 in Detroit, Michigan, to prepare candidates for the Roman Catholic priesthood primarily to serve Polish American immigrant communities. It closed in 2022.

==Early history==

Approval for founding such a seminary was granted on January 14, 1879, by Pope Leo XIII upon the petition of Father Leopold Moczygemba, a Conventual Franciscan, founder of the Polish settlement in Panna Maria, Texas, in 1854.

The establishment of the seminary was realized by Father Joseph Dabrowski, the first rector, who obtained approval from Bishop Caspar Borgess of Detroit for constructing a building on St. Aubin Avenue between Forest Avenue and Garfield Street and organizing the seminary program.

==The move to Orchard Lake==

Increasing enrollment and the need for additional space led the second rector, Father Witold Buchaczkowski, to transfer the seminary in 1909 from Detroit to the site of the former Michigan Military Academy in the rural village of Orchard Lake, northwest of Detroit.

==The early program==

The original academic program of the seminary consisted of ten years of studies: five in the preparatory classical department and five in the upper division, namely, two in philosophy and three in theology. In 1927, three four-year administratively independent schools were established: SS. Cyril and Methodius Seminary, St. Mary&#x27;s College, and St. Mary&#x27;s Preparatory, known collectively at present as the Orchard Lake Schools.

==Current academic programs==

In 1968, the Seminary began to provide a training program for permanent deacons, field education for seminarians, and continuing education for adults. In the ensuing years, the following degree programs were introduced: Master of Divinity (1973) for priesthood candidates, religious, and lay women and men; Master of Religious Education (1977), later designated as Master of Arts in Religious Education (1989); and Master of Arts in Pastoral Ministry (1989), an upgrading of the Certificate in Pastoral Ministry, which had been in existence since 1975.

==Accreditation==

In 1971, SS. Cyril and Methodius Seminary became an associate member of the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada (ATS). In 1992 the seminary was granted candidacy for accredited status in the association and undertook a two-year self-study as part of the process leading toward accreditation. SS. Cyril and Methodius Seminary was granted initial accreditation by ATS in January, 1995.

<text>The Church of Satan: A History of the World&#x27;s Most Notorious Religion is a book by Blanche Barton, published on November 1, 1990 by Hell&#x27;s Kitchen Productions.

==Contents==
Chapter one, &quot;Let the Games Begin&quot;, opens with quotes from proponents and opponents of Satanism with illustrative examples of contemporary Satanic practice. It then provides reasons for (and the context into which) Anton LaVey founded the Church of Satan and the religion of Satanism. The second chapter, &quot;Diabolical Consequences&quot;, covers the media response to CoS activities and the notable personalities it attracted. The cultural and personal impact of Satanism are discussed, as is the mid-1970s re-organization of the Church. Chapter three, &quot;The Modern Prometheus&quot;, gives a biographical sketch of LaVey. In chapter four, &quot;What Demons Conjured?&quot;, a catalog of the CoS&#x27;s influence on popular culture and occultism is presented; as are rebuttals to the claims of &quot;Satanbusters&quot; and &quot;survivors of Satanic ritual abuse&quot;. Chapter five, &quot;Satanism in Theory and Practice&quot;, covers the unique nature of Satanism as (not just a religious identity, but) a theory of aesthetics and an ethnology. Reflections on the popularity of Satanic imagery are given. It reprints the &quot;Nine Satanic Statements&quot; and the &quot;Nine Satanic Sins&quot;. LaVey responds to some of the frequent accusations against Satanism. In the sixth chapter, &quot;Satan&#x27;s Master Plan&quot;, LaVey affirms &quot;his commitment to destroy Christianity and herd mentality in all forms.&quot; It presents the &quot;Five-Point Program&quot; of Satanic goals to change the world. The &quot;Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth&quot; are reprinted, as is the &quot;Hymn of the Satanic Empire&quot;. The seventh chapter informs the reader on &quot;How to Perform Satanic Rituals&quot;. It presents five &quot;main elements...central to success&quot; at achieving magical results. Several specific misconceptions of Satanism are then addressed. Advice on magical effectiveness and evading common snares are given. The eighth and final chapter presents &quot;Guidelines for Grottos and Groups&quot;. It begins with a description of a typical CoS ritual. LaVey&#x27;s view of the desire to join groups and perform group rituals is given, with advice on what to watch out for (in a Satanic bunco tip sheet). Recommendations on how to meet other Satanists, start groups, name grottos, and execute rituals are given. LaVey encourages Satanists to &quot;make pioneering discoveries and achievements&quot; as a way of forcing &quot;objective authorities... to see and acknowledge the quality, productivity and superiority of Satanic thought.&quot; Four appendices are included: In &quot;Letters: &#x27;Many Are Called...&#x27;&quot; a collection of sample letters the CoS has received is presented; &quot;Satanic Music: That Old Black Magic&quot;; &quot;Satanic Cinema: Down These Mean Streets&quot;; and &quot;Further Reading: The Devil&#x27;s Bookshelf&quot;.

<doc id="1287722" wikidata="Q4863332" url="?curid=1287722" title="Barrel cortex">
<text>The barrel cortex is a region of the somatosensory cortex that is identifiable in some species of rodents and species of at least two other orders and contains the barrel field. The &#x27;barrels&#x27; of the barrel field are regions within cortical layer IV that are visibly darker when stained to reveal the presence of cytochrome c oxidase and are separated from each other by lighter areas called septa. These dark-staining regions are a major target for somatosensory inputs from the thalamus, and each barrel corresponds to a region of the body. Due to this distinctive cellular structure, organisation, and functional significance, the barrel cortex is a useful tool to understand cortical processing and has played an important role in neuroscience. The majority of what is known about corticothalamic processing comes from studying the barrel cortex, and researchers have intensively studied the barrel cortex as a model of neocortical column.

The most distinctive aspect of the barrel field are the whisker barrels. These structures were first discovered by Woolsey and Van der Loos in 1970. Staining in the whisker barrels is more distinct than that in other areas of the somatosensory cortex. Recognizing that the array was similar to that of the vibrissae (whiskers) on the mystacial pad (region where whiskers grow from) of certain mammals, they hypothesized that the barrels were the &quot;cortical correlates of the mystacial vibrissae&quot; and that &quot;one barrel represents one vibrissa&quot;. Whereas small non-whisker areas of barrel cortex correspond to large and sometimes overlapping areas of the body, each much larger whisker barrel corresponds to a single whisker. As a result, the whisker barrels are the focus of the majority of barrel cortex research, and &#x27;barrel cortex&#x27; is often used to refer primarily to the whisker barrels. Consequently, much of this article focuses on rodent whisker barrel cortex.

== Organisation of the barrel fields ==
The barrel field, like many regions of cortex, is organised into a topographic map. In the case of the barrel field, the map is somatotopic - based on the arrangement of body parts. Areas corresponding to the nose and mouth are more rostral and lateral in the map, the forelimb, hindlimb and trunk are more medial, with the forelimb rostral of the hindlimb, and the whisker barrel subfields - the posteromedial barrel subfield, which corresponds to the major facial whiskers (the mystacial vibrissae), and the anteriolateral barrel subfield, which corresponds to the smaller whiskers of the face - are caudal and lateral. Although the whiskers make up a relatively small portion of the animal, they dominate the somatotopic map.

=== Barrels of the major facial whiskers ===
The barrels that correspond to the major facial whiskers (mystacial vibrissae) are contained within the posteromedial barrel subfield (PMBSF). The barrels here are the largest and most elliptical in shape and have a striking topographical organization that is identical to that of the whiskers; they are organized into 5 rows of 4-7 large whiskers that run close to parallel with the bridge of the nose. The organisation of the mystacial vibrissae and corresponding barrels is so consistent that there is a naming convention to identify each whisker in rats and mice. Rows are designated A to E from top to bottom, and columns of whiskers within each row are numbered from back to front. The first four rows also have an additional whisker behind column 1, which is designated with a lower case letter or a Greek letter (α, β, γ, or δ). These four whiskers are also called straddlers.

== Anatomy and connectivity of the barrels ==
The barrels of the barrel cortex were named because the densities of cells resembled barrels. That is, they are collected into cylindrical shapes that are narrowed at the top and bottom. The centre of the barrel is designated the hollow, and the spaces between the barrels are the septa (singular: septum).

Sensory information flows from whisker follicles to barrel cortex via the trigeminal nerve nuclei and the thalamus. Barrel-like divisions can be seen in some, but not all parts of the trigeminal nuclei (where they are called barrelets) and the thalamus (where they are called barreloids). The trigeminal nerve carries afferent fibres from the follicles into the brainstem where they connect to neurons in four different trigeminal nerve nuclei: principal, interpolar, oral, and caudal.

Projections from the trigeminal nuclei to the thalamus are split into pathways designated lemniscal, extralemniscal, and paralemniscal. In the lemniscal pathway, axons from the principal trigeminal nucleus cross over the midline and project to “barreloids” in the thalamus, specifically in the dorsomedial section of the ventroposterior medial nucleus (VPMdm). Neurons in VPMdm project mainly to barrels in layer 4 of primary somatosensory cortex (S1). In the extralemniscal pathway, neurons of the interpolar nucleus project to the ventrolateral section of the ventroposterior medial nucleus (VPMvl). Neurons in VPMvl project to septa between the barrels and to secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). The paralemniscal pathway runs from the interpolar trigeminal nucleus via the posterior nucleus (POm) of the thalamus to S2 and to diffuse targets in barrel cortex, especially layer 5.

Each pathway also has secondary projections to other layers within barrel cortex and other regions of cortex, including motor cortex. These different pathways are thought to transmit different modalities of sensory information from the whisker.

== Whisker barrel neurophysiology ==
The whisker barrel cortex contains different types of neurons that receive input from a range of sources that themselves receive and process an array of different types of information. As a result, neurons of the whisker barrel cortex respond to whisker-related input, but in a way that is specific to the neurons type and location. This can manifest in different ways. The simplest way is whether the cortical neuron responds only to the deflection of one whisker, or to the deflection of many whiskers. Neurons in layer 4 barrels tend to strongly or exclusively respond to one whisker, while neurons in other layers are less strongly tuned and can respond to multiple whiskers. Neurons that respond to the deflection of multiple whiskers typically have a primary whisker, to which they respond the most. The difference in response magnitude between deflection of the primary whisker and secondary whiskers can also vary between neurons. Stimulation of multiple whiskers may produce a response that is equal to the sum of the responses if each whisker was stimulated independently, or it may be different. Some neurons show greater responses when multiple neurons are stimulated in sequence, and the sequence may be direction specific.

As well as combinations of which whiskers have been stimulated, neurons may also respond to specific types of whisker stimulation. The simplest response, seen in neurons within the layer IV barrel cortex, directly code for whisker displacement. That is to say, that the neuron within a given barrel will fire when the whisker that barrel represents is moved at a rate that is roughly proportional to the angular displacement of the neuron. These neurons also show directional sensitivity; certain neurons will only fire when the whisker is moved in a specific direction. Deflection-based firing neurons can sustain their response throughout the deflection of the whisker. Other neurons respond to the initial deflection, but then quickly return to their previous level of activity. Much of this activity is also modulated by the behaviour of the animal - rats and mice actively move their whiskers to explore their environment, and the response of a neuron to a particular stimulus can vary depending on what the animal is doing.

==Experience-dependent plasticity==

Because the barrel cortex has a well-organised structure that relates clearly to the whisker pad, it has been used extensively as a tool to study sensory processing and development, and the phenomenon of experience-dependent plasticity - changes in the activity, connectivity, and structure of neural circuits in response to experience. Neurons in the barrel cortex exhibit the property of synaptic plasticity that allows them to alter the vibrissae to which they respond depending on the rodent&#x27;s history of tactile experience. Experience-dependent plasticity is commonly studied in the barrel cortex by partially depriving it of sensory input, either by lesioning elements of the afferent pathway (e.g. the trigeminal nerve) or by ablating, plucking, or trimming some of the facial whiskers. The anatomical structure of the barrels is only affected by lesioning elements of the pathway, but innocuous forms of deprivation can induce rapid changes in the cortical map into adulthood, without any corresponding changes in the barrel structures. Because of their different effects, it seems these two paradigms work by different mechanisms.

Some forms of plasticity in the barrel cortex display a critical period. Plucking whiskers in neonatal rats causes a long-lasting expansion of the representation of the spared whisker in layer 4. However, layer 4 plasticity rapidly diminishes if sensory deprivation begins after day 4 of life (P4) whereas representations in layer 2/3 remain highly plastic into adulthood.

Two cortical processes run alongside each other when barrel cortex is deprived of sensory input from some whiskers to produce representational plasticity. In deprived cortex, neuronal responses to spared whiskers are enhanced and responses to deprived whiskers are weakened. These two processes have different time courses, with the weakening of deprived response preceding the strengthening of spared response, implying that they have different underlying mechanisms. These two effects combine to produce an expansion of the cortical representation of spared whiskers into the representation of adjacent deprived whiskers.

It is likely that several different mechanisms are involved in producing experience-dependent
plasticity in a whisker deprivation protocol (adapted from Feldman and Brecht, 2005 ):

#Almost immediately, loss of input to a deprived barrel column leads to a loss of inhibitory firing in that column. This unmasks horizontal excitatory connections from adjacent spared columns. This does not explain longer-lasting plastic changes as the unmasking would disappear immediately if the deprived input was reinstated (for example by allowing the whisker to regrow).
#LTP- and LTD-like processes also seem to be involved. This can be inferred by using transgenic mice where there are changes in the expression of enzymes related to LTP and LTD e.g. calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) or cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB). In these mice, plasticity is compromised Spike timing rather than frequency may be an important factor. Associative LTP has been demonstrated at layer 4 to layer 2/3 synapses when the layer 4 neuron fires 0-15 ms before the layer 2/3 neuron, and LTD is observed when this timing order is reversed. Such mechanisms could act rapidly to produce plastic changes within hours or days.
#Sensory deprivation has been demonstrated to cause changes in synaptic dynamics such as EPSP amplitude and frequency. The net effect of these changes is to increase the proportion of synaptic input which layer 2/3 neurons in deprived barrels receive from spared barrels. These observations suggest that other, more specific, mechanisms besides LTP/LTD are at play in experience-dependent plasticity.
#It seems intuitively likely that structural changes at the level of axons, dendrite branches, and dendrite spines underlie some of the long-term plastic changes in the cortex. Changes in axon structure have been reported in plasticity following lesions and more recently by studies using whisker trimming. Dendritic branching is important during prenatal and neonatal development, is involved in plasticity induced by lesions, but is not involved in experience-dependent plasticity. In vivo two-photon microscopy reveals that dendritic spines in mouse barrel cortex are highly dynamic and subject to continuous turnover, and may be associated with formation or deletion of synapses. It is likely that spine turnover is necessary but not sufficient to produce experience-dependent plasticity, and other mechanisms such as axonal remodelling are also needed to explain features such as savings from prior experience.

Plasticity and remodelling of barrel cortex has also been studied in the context of traumatic brain injury, where environmental enrichment of stimuli has been shown to induce plasticity/recovery and patterns of temporal coding have been altered via plasticity and recovery mechanisms.

<text>Flin Flon is a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created by redistribution in 1957, and has formally existed since the provincial election of 1958.

At about 80,000 square kilometers, Flin Flon occupies roughly 20% of Manitoba&#x27;s total area, and is the second largest riding in the province after Rupertsland. It was a smaller riding before 1989, when it gained a significant amount of territory from the former riding of Churchill. It is a mostly rural and sparsely populated riding, located in the province&#x27;s northwestern corner.

Flin Flon is bordered by Saskatchewan to the west, Nunavut to the north, the ridings of Rupertsland and Thompson to the east, and the riding of The Pas to the south. The actual city of Flin Flon is located in the southwestern corner of the riding, and is its only urban centre.

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 14,470. In 1999, the average family income was $55,113, and the unemployment rate was 9.70%. Manufacturing accounts for 17% of Flin Flon&#x27;s economy, followed by mining and oil production at 16%.

73.4% of Flin Flon&#x27;s residents are aboriginal.

Flin Flon has been held by the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP) since 1969. The current MLA is Tom Lindsey, who was elected in the provincial election of 2016. He replaced the incumbent, Clarence Pettersen who was de-selected by the NDP and decided to contest the election as an Independent.

<doc id="1287737" wikidata="Q378193" url="?curid=1287737" title="House of Lusignan">
<text>The House of Lusignan ( ; ) was a royal house of French origin, which at various times ruled several principalities in Europe and the Levant, including the kingdoms of Jerusalem, Cyprus, and Armenia, from the 12th through the 15th centuries during the Middle Ages. It also had great influence in England and France.

The family originated in Lusignan, in Poitou, western France, in the early 10th century. By the end of the 11th century, the family had risen to become the most prominent petty lords in the region from their castle at Lusignan. In the late 12th century, through marriages and inheritance, a cadet branch of the family came to control the kingdoms of Jerusalem and Cyprus. In the early 13th century, the main branch succeeded to the Counties of La Marche and Angoulême.

As Crusader kings in the Latin East, they soon had connections with the Hethumid rulers of the Kingdom of Cilicia, which they inherited through marriage in the mid-14th century. The Armenian branch fled to France, and eventually Russia, after the Mamluk conquest of their kingdom.

The claim was taken by the Cypriot branch, until their line failed. This kingdom was annexed by the Republic of Venice in the late 15th century.

==First House of Lusignan==
===Origins===

The Château de Lusignan, near Poitiers, was the principal seat of the Lusignans. It is shown at its height in the March illumination in the Trés Riches Heures of the Duc de Berry (circa 1412). Louis XIV fortified it and it was used as a prison, a school—and a handy quarry for building materials. It was leveled to the ground in the 18th century in order to create a park for local residents. Only its foundations remain today. According to folklore, the earliest castle was built by Melusine, a water-spirit.

The lords of the castle at Lusignan became counts of La Marche in the 12th century. They added the county of Angoulême to their holdings in 1220, when Hugh X of Lusignan married Isabella of Angoulême, daughter of Count Aymer of Angoulême and widow of John, King of England. These acquisitions produced complicated titles. For example, Hugh XI of Lusignan was Hugh VI of La Marche and Hugh II of Angoulême.

Hugh XIII died in 1303. His sisters, Jeanne and Isabelle, sold the county of Angoulême to Philip IV of France. Hugh was succeeded by his brother, Guy I, who died in 1308, making their sister Yolande Countess of La Marche. After Yolande&#x27;s death, in 1314, King Philip annexed La Marche.

===In France===

*Hugh I (early 10th century)
*Hugh II (died 967)
*Hugh III
*Hugh IV
*Hugh V (died 1060), who married Almodis of La Marche, the daughter of Count Bernard I of La Marche.

====Counts of La Marche / Counts of Eu====
*Hugh VI (died 1110), who inherited by collateral succession the County of La Marche (1091) as a descendant of Almodis of La Marche.
*Hugh VII (died 1151)
*Hugh VIII (died 1165), whose younger son was Aimery of Lusignan, the first King of Cyprus also King of Jerusalem

Guy&#x27;s sisters, Jeanne and Isabelle, sold Angoulême to Philip IV of France after Guy&#x27;s death. Yolande sold the fiefs of Lusignan, La Marche and Fougères to Philip IV of France in 1308. They became a part of the French royal demesne and a common &quot;appanage&quot; of the crown.

===Crusader kings===
====Aimery at the Jerusalem court====
In the 1170s, Aimery of Lusignan (c.1145-1205) (a younger son of Hugh VIII (died 1165)) arrived in Jerusalem, having been expelled from his realm by Richard the Lionheart, then acting Duke of Aquitaine, which included the family lands of Lusignan near Poitiers. Aimery, named Amalric by outdated scholarship, married Eschiva, the daughter of Baldwin of Ibelin, and entered court circles.

Aimery had also obtained the patronage of Agnes of Courtenay (the divorced mother of King Baldwin IV of Jerusalem and the wife of Reginald of Sidon), who held the county of Jaffa and Ascalon. Agnes appointed Aimery as Constable of Jaffa, and later as Constable of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Hostile rumours alleged that Aimery was Agnes&#x27;s lover, but this is questionable. It is more likely that his promotions were aimed at weaning him away from the political orbit of the Ibelin family, who were associated with Raymond III of Tripoli, the cousin of King Amalric of Jerusalem and a former &quot;bailli&quot; or regent.

====Guy of Lusignan====
Aimery’s younger brother, Guy of Lusignan (c.1150-1194), arrived in Jerusalem at some unknown date before Easter 1180, although Ernoul said that he arrived on the advice of Aimery. Some modern historians believe that Guy was already well established in Jerusalem by 1180, but there is no supporting contemporary evidence. Aimery&#x27;s success certainly facilitated the social and political advancement of Guy.

Older accounts, derived from William of Tyre and Ernoul, claim that Agnes of Courtenay was concerned that her political rivals, headed by Raymond of Tripoli, intended to exercise more control by forcing her daughter, the widowed Sibylla (sister and heir presumptive to King Baldwin IV) to marry a man of their choosing. Agnes was said to have foiled these plans by advising her son Baldwin to have Sibylla married to Guy; however Baldwin, now believed to have been less malleable than earlier historians have portrayed, was considering the international implications of his sister&#x27;s marriage. The best husband for her would be a knight who could rally external help to the kingdom, and not a local nobleman. As the new King of France, Philip II, was still a minor, Baldwin&#x27;s first cousin King Henry II of England seemed the best prospect for such help and he owed the Pope a penitential pilgrimage to the Holy Land on account of his responsibility for the murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket. Guy was a vassal of both King Henry and of his son Richard of Poitou (the future King Richard I) and had formerly been rebellious, so they wanted to keep him overseas.

Guy and Sibylla were hastily married at Easter 1180, apparently preventing a coup by Raymond&#x27;s faction to marry her to Baldwin of Ibelin, the father-in-law of Aimery. By this marriage, Guy became Count of Jaffa and Ascalon and &quot;Bailli&quot; of Jerusalem. Sibylla already had a son from her first marriage to William of Montferrat, and by Guy she had two daughters, Alice and Mary de Lusignan.

An ambitious man, Guy convinced King Baldwin IV to name him as regent in early 1182. But he and Raynald of Châtillon provoked Saladin, the Sultan of Egypt and Syria, during a two-year period of truce. More important to Baldwin IV&#x27;s disillusionment with him was Guy&#x27;s military hesitation during the Siege of Kerak. Throughout late 1183 and 1184 Baldwin IV tried to have his sister&#x27;s marriage to Guy annulled, showing that Baldwin still held his sister with some favour. Baldwin IV had wanted a loyal brother-in-law, and was frustrated in Guy&#x27;s hardheadedness and disobedience. Sibylla remained at Ascalon, though perhaps not against her will.

Unsuccessful in prying his sister and close heir away from Guy, the king and the &quot;Haute Cour&quot; altered the succession. They placed Baldwin V, Sibylla&#x27;s son from her first marriage, in precedence over Sibylla. They also established a process to choose the monarch afterwards between Sibylla and Isabella (whom Baldwin and the Haute Cour thus recognized as at least equally entitled to succession as Sibylla), though Sibylla was not herself excluded from the succession. After the death of Baldwin V in 1186, Guy and Sibylla went to Jerusalem for the funeral, accompanied by an armed guard. Sibylla was crowned as Queen of Jerusalem, on the condition that she annul her marriage with Guy. In return she could marry whom she chose. Her decision to remarry Guy angered the barons.

Guy&#x27;s term as king is generally seen as a disaster; he was defeated by Saladin at the Battle of Hattin in 1187, and was imprisoned in Damascus while Saladin reconquered almost the entire kingdom.

Upon his release, Guy and Sibylla sought refuge in Tyre, but were denied entry by rival Conrad of Montferrat, the husband of Isabella. During the Siege of Acre in 1191, Sibylla and their two daughters died. Isabella succeeded to the throne as the queen of Jerusalem. Guy left for Limassol and met with Richard, now king of England. He joined the latter&#x27;s conquest of Cyprus, which was retaliation for the lord of Cyprus having taken Richard&#x27;s fiancée as prisoner. Afterwards Richard and Guy returned to the siege of Acre. Richard gave up his claim to Jerusalem and supported Guy, while the king of France and the duke of Austria supported their kinsman Conrad. Guy still saved Conrad&#x27;s life when he was surrounded by the enemy. Richard put the matter of the kingdom of Jerusalem to a vote, which Conrad won, leaving Guy powerless.

Richard sold Cyprus to the Knight Templars, who in turn sold it to Guy. Guy died in 1194, leaving Cyprus to his older brother Aimery.

====Aimery becomes king====
Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor crowned Aimery as the first king of Cyprus. In 1197 Aimery married Isabella, which brought the crown of Jerusalem back to the Lusignans. One of Aimery&#x27;s first actions as king was to make a five-year truce with the Ayyubids.

===In England===
Meanwhile, in France, Hugh &quot;le Brun&quot; de Lusignan (&quot;Hugh the Swarthy&quot;), like most of the lords of Poitou, backed Arthur of Brittany as the better heir to Richard the Lionheart when the latter&#x27;s brother John Lackland acceded to the throne of England in 1199. John&#x27;s mother Eleanor of Aquitaine traded English claims for their support of her son. To secure his position in La Marche, the widowed Hugh arranged a betrothal with the heiress Isabella of Angoulême. However John obtained her hand first, and married her in August 1200, thus depriving Hugh of La Marche and his brother of Eu in Normandy.

The aggrieved Lusignans turned to their feudal overlord Philip Augustus, King of France, who demanded John&#x27;s presence — a tactical impossibility — and declared John a &quot;contumacious vassal.&quot; As the Lusignan allies managed to detain both Arthur and Eleanor, John surprised their unprepared forces at the castle of Mirebeau in July 1202, and took Hugh prisoner with 200 of his troops. King John&#x27;s savage treatment of the captives caused outrage among his supporters, and his French barons began to desert him. The Lusignans&#x27; diplomatic rebellion resulted in the loss to England of half its territory in France, soon incorporated into his kingdom by Philip Augustus. (The other &quot;half&quot;, Aquitaine, remained the possession of John&#x27;s surviving mother Eleanor of Aquitaine). John died in 1216, leaving his son Henry III as king. His widow Isabella of Angoulême finally married Hugh X of Lusignan in 1220, and bore him five children.
In 1247, Guilliame de Lusignan, a younger son of Hugh X and Isabella, moved from France to England along with two of his brothers at the request of their half-brother King Henry III. Guillaume (known in English as William de Valence) and his brothers were quickly placed in positions of power by the king; William was married to Joan de Munchensi (d. 1307), a granddaughter and heiress to the great William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke and was granted custody of the lands and the title of Earl of Pembroke, giving him great wealth and power in his new land. As a result he was unpopular and was heavily involved in the Second Barons&#x27; War, supporting the King and Prince Edward against the rebels led by Simon de Montfort. After the final defeat of the rebels at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, William continued to serve Henry III, and then Edward I, until his death in 1296.

William&#x27;s eldest surviving son, Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (c. 1265–1324), succeeded to his father&#x27;s estates, but he was not formally recognized as Earl of Pembroke until after the death of his mother Joan in 1307. He was appointed guardian of Scotland in 1306, but with the accession of King Edward II to the throne and the consequent rise of his favourite Piers Gaveston to power, his influence declined and he became prominent among the discontented nobles. In 1312, after the Earl of Warwick betrayed him by executing the captured Gaveston, Aymer de Valence left the allied lords and joined the King. Valence was present at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, and later helped King Edward defeat the Earl of Lancaster. However, by the time of his death in 1324, he had again been marginalized at court, and also suffered financial trouble. His wife Mary de Châtillon founded Pembroke College, Cambridge and also Denny Abbey, between Cambridge and Ely, where she spent her last days surrounded by nuns.

===Kings of Cyprus===


After another six-year truce with the Muslims, Aimery and most of the royal family died. His only surviving son, Hugh, became King of Cyprus in 1205. The kingdom of Jerusalem passed to Maria of Montferrat, eldest daughter of Isabella and Conrad. Hugh married his step-sister, Alice of Champagne, daughter of Isabella and Henry of Champagne. They had three children. Henry, the youngest child and only son, became king in 1218 at eight months of age; Alice officially served as his regent. Her uncle Phillip of Ibelin exercised the real power behind the throne, followed by his brother John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut.

Henry was crowned at the age of 8 at Santa Sophia, Nicosia, in 1225. His uncle arranged the early coronation in a political maneuver intended to outflank Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor expected attempt to seize power. Frederick succeeded in 1228 in forcing John of Ibelin to hand over the regency and the island of Cyprus. But, when Frederick left the island in April, John counter-attacked and regained control, which began the War of the Lombards. Henry assumed control of the kingdom when he came of age at 15, in 1232. He became regent of Jerusalem, in 1246, for the infant Conrad IV of Germany, serving as ruler until 1253. Henry was married three times and had only one child, a son Hugh. The boy succeeded him upon his death in 1253, although he was only two months of age. Hugh died in 1267 at age 14, bringing an end to the first House of Lusignan.
==Second House of Lusignan==


===Fall of the Templars===
At that point, Hugh of Antioch, whose maternal grandfather had been Hugh I of Cyprus, took the name Lusignan, thus founding the second House of Lusignan. He succeeded his deceased cousin as King of Cyprus. In 1268, following the execution of Conradin, he was crowned King of Jerusalem. Hugh was frustrated by dealing with the different factions of Jerusalem nobles, and in 1276 he left for Cyprus. Saint Thomas Aquinas wrote &quot;On Kingship&quot; for Hugh.

In 1284 his son John succeeded him as king of Cyprus and Jerusalem, but died one year later. John is believed to have been poisoned by his brother, Henry. In 1291 the last remnants of the Kingdom of Jerusalem were captured by Al-Ashraf Khalil, the Sultan of Egypt. Henry fled to Cyprus and under his rule, that kingdom prospered. He had the &quot;Haute Cour&quot; keep written records for the first time in their history, and developed them from a simple advisory council into a true court that tried criminals. His goal of reclaiming Jerusalem went unfulfilled, despite alliances with Persia and twice requesting Pope Clement V for assistance.

King Henry suffered from epilepsy, which incapacitated him at times. Some of the nobles grew unhappy with his rule, and he had his brother, Guy, the Constable of Cyprus, executed for conspiring against him. Their brother Amalric, the Lord of Tyre, overthrew him with help from the Knights Templar. The revolt was quick and non-violent. Amalric became regent of Cyprus and Jerusalem, and Henry was exiled to Armenia. There he was imprisoned by Amalric&#x27;s brother-in-law King Oshin. Amalric repaired relationships with Venice, Genoa, and the Knights Hospitallers, and became popular among the people.

In 1300, the Lusignans, led by Amalric, Lord of Tyre entered into combined military operations with the Mongols under Ghazan to retake the Holy Land, but without success. In 1307 Pope Clement, under pressure from king Philip IV of France ordered that all Templars be arrested and their properties seized, leaving Amalric no choice but to comply. This led to a small uprising and calls for Henry to retake the throne, but it quickly subsided. Among those arrested were several nobles, including two members of the Ibelin family. Amalric was murdered in 1310 by Simon of Montolif. After this King Oshin released Henry II. With the aid of the Hospitallers, Henry regained his throne. Those who had helped Amalric were arrested, including their brother Aimery, who was acting governor following Amalric&#x27;s murder.

===Kings of Armenia===

In 1342, Amalric&#x27;s son, Guy de Lusignan, was elected as King of Armenia and took the name Constantine II. He was initially reluctant as the regent, Oshin of Corycos, was rumored to have poisoned the previous king, and killed Guy&#x27;s mother and two brothers. Under his leadership, the Lusignans tried to impose Western Catholicism and the European way of life on the Armenian people, who had a state religion of the Armenian Apostolic Church. The Armenian leadership largely accepted Catholicism, but the peasantry opposed the changes. Eventually, this led civil strife. Constantine was killed in an uprising in 1344, and the throne passed out of the Lusignan family to his distant cousin Gosdantin; he reigned as Constantine III. Constantine III attempted to kill his cousins, in an attempt to eliminate all potential claimants, but they fled to Cyprus.

===Golden Age of Lusignan Cyprus===
Hugh IV de Lusignan became king at age 29, and unlike previous Lusignan monarchs he was content being just King of Cyprus, refusing his son Peter&#x27;s requests to lead a crusade for Jerusalem. He instead preferred to focus on issues in his realm and was strict on justice. When Peter and his third son John journeyed to Europe he had the man who helped them tortured and hanged, and sent ships to find and imprison his sons. He had a strong interest in art, literature and philosophy, hosting regular philosophical discussions at his summer villa in Lapithos and commissioned Genealogia deorum gentilium by the Italian writer Giovanni Boccaccio. In 1347 Prince Peter de Lusignan founded the Chivalric Order of the Sword, whose motto was &quot;Pour Lealte Maintenir&quot; the motto of his house.

In 1358 Hugh abdicated the throne, passing it on to his military minded son Peter instead of his grandson Hugh, the heir apparent. Peter believed that since Cyprus was the last Christian stronghold in the mideast it was his duty to fight the Muslims, and raided the coastal ports of the Asia Minor. The people of Korikos asked for protection from the Muslims. Peter sent his kinsman, Sir Roberto de Lusignan to lead the siege of Korikos. The Lusignans succeeded, and the various Muslim leaders united against Peter, launching an assault on Cyprus. Peter united Knights of Saint John from Rhodes, Papal armies, and Mediterranean pirates to defeat the Muslim fleets before they could land. After another defeat at Antalya the remaining emirs in the region offered him tribute, and he accepted, sending the flags, coats of arms, and other symbols of his house to be raised in different cities. Peter personally visited many of the cities he conquered, where he was given trophies, gifts, and was even worshiped by some.

When Peter returned to Cyprus he was in risk of losing his throne. Hugh, his nephew who had previously been the heir apparent, went to Pope Urban V in an attempt to be recognized as king. Peter journeyed to Avignon to present his case. Urban sided with Peter, but Hugh was given a high annual benefit as recompense. Peter also discussed another crusade with the pope, and then decided to visit the other kings and rulers of Europe to strengthen his army. He visited Germany, France, and England, where the famed &quot;Banquet of the Five Kings&quot; took place. In 1363 Peter attended the Congress of Kraków, hosted by King Casimir the Great of Poland. In attendance were Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, King Louis I of Hungary, the Valdemar IV of Denmark, and other lords and princes. Among the issues discussed were Peter&#x27;s crusade, peace treaties between the kings, and the succession for the Polish throne. While there Peter won a royal tournament, adding to his prestige.

While Peter was attempting to launch another crusade and gaining recognition, his brother Prince John ruled as vice-king in Cyprus and faced many challenges. There was an epidemic in 1363 which resulted in the death of many Cypriots, including their sister Eschiva. The Turks heard that the people of Cyprus were dying and took advantage by raiding and pillaging the villages. During this time there were also conflicts between the Genose navies docked at Famagusta and the native Cypriots. Peter was in Genoa at the time and negotiated peace. He failed to gain the support of the major rulers but set off on a crusade with what men he had. He sacked the city of Alexandria, but was prevented from moving on to Cairo, and succeeded only in angering the Sultan. Peter moved on to Beirut, Tripoli, and in 1368 attempted once again to unite Europe in a crusade. Pope Urban V instead had Peter make peace with the Sultan of Egypt, who was attacking Christian ships in retaliation for Peter&#x27;s crusade. The increased commerce under Peter&#x27;s reign led to Famagusta becoming one of the wealthiest cities of its time. It became renowned as a place where the rich could live in lavish surroundings.

While on one of his visits to Rome Peter received word that the barons of Armenia wanted him as king. He returned to Cyprus to find that his queen had been unfaithful while he was away, and he tyrannized all nobles she showed favor to, including his brothers. In 1369 Peter was assassinated while in bed by three of his own knights. During his reign he was known as the epitome of chivalry, and was the greatest king of the Lusignan dynasty. He was succeeded by his 12-year-old son, Peter II.

Peter&#x27;s brother John served as regent for 12-year-old Peter II. John&#x27;s appointment was opposed by many, especially Peter&#x27;s wife Eleanor of Aragon, who suspected John of arranging the assassination. Vowing revenge, Eleanor asked for military aid from Europe in order to punish Peter I&#x27;s murderers. The Genoese agreed, and invaded in 1373, which led to them capturing Famagusta, the most important port in the region. Peter II recalled forces from cities along the Asian Minor to defend Cyprus, resulting in their loss. He signed a treaty with the Genoese, one of the conditions being that his uncle, James, the youngest brother of his father Peter I, be exiled from Cyprus. This ended the war, but James was captured by the Genoese in Rhodes and held captive in Genoa. After the war Eleanor finally killed Prince John, still under the belief he had murdered her husband. Peter II signed a peace treaty with the Sultan of Egypt, and died in 1382 at Nicosia.

The Parliament of Cyprus decided that James I of Cyprus was to succeed as the new king. Unfortunately James was still a captive of the Genoese. While in captivity he had wed Helvis of Brunswick-Grubenhagen and had 12 children. After agreeing to give the Genoese more rights in Cyprus, he was released. While he was away Cyprus was governed by a council of 12 nobles. Some of the nobles opposed his return, led by the brothers Perotte and Vilmonde de Montolivve, who wished to be kings themselves. In 1385 James returned again, and succeeded, being crowned in Nicosia. In 1388 he was crowned king of Jerusalem, and in 1393, following the death of his cousin Leon of Armenia (Leon V of Lusignan, also called Leo V or Levon), he was crowned king of Armenia. James died in 1398, and was succeeded by his son Janus.

===Fall of Armenia===

After the death of his kinsman, Constantine IV sought an alliance with the Sultan of Egypt, whom Peter had made an enemy. This angered the barons of Armenia, who feared annexation by the sultan, and in 1373 Constantine IV was murdered. In 1374, Leon V de Lusignan was crowned King of Armenia. He was raised in Cyprus after having fled Constantine III, and while there he became a knight in the Order of the Sword, which was founded by King Peter I. In 1375, Armenia was invaded by the Mameluks and Leon was forced to surrender, putting an end to the last fully independent Armenian entity of the Middle Ages after three centuries of sovereignty. The title was claimed by his cousin, James I of Cyprus, uniting it with the titles of Cyprus and Jerusalem. Leon and his family were held captive in Cairo for several years, until King John I of Castile ransomed him and made him Lord of Madrid. He died in Paris in 1393 after trying and failing to gather support for another crusade.

===Kings of Jerusalem, Cyprus, and Armenia===

Janus, son of James I and Helvis, married Charlotte de Bourbon and their marriage was described as a &quot;cornerstone in the revitalisation of French culture in the Lusignan court that characterised Janus&#x27;s rule&quot;. Charlotte died on 15 January 1422 of the plague. She was buried in the Royal Monastery of Saint Dominic&#x27;s in Nicosia. Her many descendants included Queen Charlotte of Cyprus, Queen Jeanne III of Navarre; French Kings Charles VIII, Francis I, Henry II, Francis II, Charles IX, Henry III, Henry IV and the subsequent Bourbon kings; Anne of France, and Mary, Queen of Scots.

As king Janus tried to take back Famagusta, which was still held by the Genoese, but was thwarted by conspirators. In 1403, the governor of Genoa, de Mengre, had talks with Janus&#x27; representative Giorgio Billi which ended in an agreement by which the cities remained under Genoese hands. Later, he forced the Cypriot people to pay special taxes to assemble an army and siege machines, and he besieged Famagusta for three years but in vain, since there was access from the sea to the city. In 1406 the siege ended and the Genoese tried to occupy Limassol, but were defeated.

Two years later, the island was affected by epidemics. Simultaneously, there were many raids of locusts on the island, which caused destruction to agriculture. A new epidemic arrived in 1419–20, which probably caused the death of Janus&#x27; second wife, Charlotte on 15 January 1422. Because the king was very distraught about her death, the body of the dead queen was moved out of the palace where her funeral was, in order to not be seen by Janus.

Meanwhile, because Cyprus was still a permanent base of campaign for pirates and adventurers, after raids around the Cypriot coasts, Janus had repeated discussions with the Sultan of Egypt via the sultan&#x27;s representatives. Janus was unable to stop the raids, which gave the Muslims a reason to attack Cyprus. Cypriot nobles and officials of the kingdom participated in the raids.

Barsbay, the Sultan of Egypt, sent military forces to Cyprus several times. A small force, around 1424, attacked Limassol, and in 1425 the Egyptian army attacked Famagusta and then pillaged Larnaca together with the nearby area, including Kiti, Dromolaxia, Kellia, Aradippou and Agrinou. After Larnaca, they went to Limassol, which was also sacked, including the city&#x27;s castle.

In the summer of 1426, the Mamluks launched a large-scale attack against the island. Led by Tangriver Mohamed and Inal el Kakimi, their army contained over 3,000 men and included Mamliks, Turks and Arabs and arrived at the island with 180 ships near Avdimou. Limassol was again occupied. Janus mustered his army and moved from Nicosia to Limassol. He asked in vain for help from the forces in Europe: the Genoese were his enemies, and the Venetians and others did not want to destroy commercial relations with the sultan.

Following the Battle of Chirokitia (7 July 1426) against the Mamluks, King Janus was captured by the Egyptian forces. He was ransomed after ten months of captivity in Cairo. During his captivity his brother Hugh of Lusignan, Archbishop of Nicosia, took charge of Cyprus.

After their victory, the Mamluks pillaged Larnaca again and then Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus. The royal family retreated to fortified Kyrenia and were rescued. The invaders took a great deal of loot and captives before they left the island.

That disaster, together with the previous raids, the war operations of Janus against Genoese, the epidemics and the invasion of locusts, caused the Cypriot serfs to revolt, as they suffered from living in conditions of utter poverty. The leader of the Cypriot revolutionaries was Alexis, whom they declared as king in Lefkoniko. The revolution was widespread supported by much of the population, who elected their own leaders in many places of Cyprus.

Meanwhile, Janus was humiliated in Cairo: they took him, tied up with chains and riding a donkey, in front of the sultan. He was forced to kneel and worship nine times the soil on which the sultan stepped. Europeans mediated in the case, obtaining the release of Janus after collecting sufficient monies for the required ransoms. Cyprus also had to offer the sultan an annual tax based on income from 5,000 duchies. This tax continued to be paid even after the end of Frankish rule in Cyprus. Together with Janus, some of the captives bought their freedom after their families collected money for ransoms. Those who remained as captives were sold as slaves.

While Janus was captive in Cyprus, the nobles and the royal family members were trying to gain his release, while dealing with Alexis&#x27; rebellion. With help from Europe, the rebellion was repressed after 10 months. The rebels&#x27; leader was arrested and, after terrible tortures, was executed in Nicosia on 12 May 1427, the same day that King Janus arrived in Paphos from Cairo. He died in 1432 and was succeeded by his son John.
John married Amadea Palaiologina of Monferrato; she died in 1440. After this he married Helena Palaiologina, the granddaughter of Eastern Roman Emperor Manuel II Palaeologus. They had two daughters, the eldest of which, Charlotte, would succeed him as ruler of Cyprus. He also had an illegitimate son, James, by his mistress Marietta de Patras. James was made Archbishop of Nicosia at age 16, but was stripped of his title after murdering the Royal Chamberlain. John eventually forgave him, and appeared to be ready to name James as his successor, but died in 1458 before doing so. He was succeeded by his daughter Charlotte.

Charlotte&#x27;s reign was troubled and brief. She succeeded in building an alliance with the Genoese, via her marriage to Louis of Savoy, Count of Geneva, but it proved futile. Her half-brother James made an alliance with the sultanate of Egypt Sayf ad-Din Inal. Their combined forces recaptured Famagusta for the Lusignans, and their blockade forced Charlotte to stay in the castle of Kyrenia for three years. In 1463 she and Louis fled Cyprus for Rome, where they were welcomed by Pope Pius II.

James was crowned king and married Catherine Cornaro in 1468 to establish an alliance with Venice. In 1472 Catherine arrived in Cyprus, and James died several months later under suspicious circumstances. Their son James III of Cyprus died at one year of age, bringing an end to the Lusignan kingdoms. However, the last member of the dynasty was Queen Charlotte, who died on 16 July 1487, in Rome.

==Legacy==

Besides the Cypriot branch, through the acts of the Count of Poitiers, Alphonse de Poitiers, by the 18th century the domains of Lusignans were divided among a number of other branches :
* Lusignan-Lezay
* Lusignan-Vouvant
* Lusignan-Cognac
* Lusignan-Jarnac (the Counts d&#x27;Eu)
* Lusignan-Sidon
* The principal branch retains Lusignan and the County of La Marche
Two of the Lusignan domains in France were erected into feudal Marquisates in 1618 and 1722 by Kings Louis XIII and Louis XV respectively.

===&quot;Prince&quot; de Lusignan ===
In 1880, a former Maronite priest Kalfa Narbei declared that he was a descendant of Guy de Lusignan and styled himself as the Prince of Lusignan of Cyprus, of Jerusalem and of Armenia. He took the name Guy de Lusignan and title of Prince. He started offering self-styled chivalric orders. After the death of Guy/Kalfa Narbei in 1905, his wife Marie&#x27;s lover became the alleged Grand Master and called himself Comte d&#x27;Alby de Gratigny. He became involved in a fake art scandal in 1910.

===Dynastic orders===

The self-styled Prince of the 1880s sold dynastic orders; in some cases, these are based on actual historical orders associated with Lusignan.
;Order of Saint Catherine of Mount Sinai: Purportedly founded in 1063 by Robert de Lusignan, surnamed &quot;bras-de-fer&quot;, for knights on the Crusades making pilgrimage to Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery on Mount Sinai.
;Order of Mélusine: Purportedly founded in 1186 by Isabella of Ibelin, Queen of Cyprus and Jerusalem. Named after Melusine, legendary fairy wife of Raymond de Forez, founder of the house of Lusignan.
;Order of the Sword of Cyprus or Silence: Purportedly founded in 1195 by Guy de Lusignan for the Kingdom of Cyprus. 
;Order of Saint Blaise of Armenia: Not revived by the prince, but reputed to have been awarded by the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia in the twelfth century. Saint Blaise was the family&#x27;s patron saint.

===Melusine===
According to European folklore the House of Lusignan was founded by the faerie Melusine. In the legend Melusine was exiled from Avalon and doomed to turn into a serpent from the waist down every Saturday. One day a prince, Raymondin of Poitou, came across her in the woods. He had just killed his uncle in a hunting accident and was distraught. Melusine helped him with this, and he later returned seeking her out. He proposed marriage, and she agreed on the condition that she be left alone every Saturday.

Raymondin agreed, and together they had ten children, founding the dynasty. They built the Château de Lusignan in 15 days, naming it after Melusine. One day Raymondin&#x27;s brothers asked why she disappeared every Saturday, and Raymondin said that it was a condition of their marriage. One brother spied through the door, and saw Melusine bathing. She was a serpent, or according to some sources, a mermaid, from waist down. He told Raymondin of this, and when Melusine was confronted she wept at the betrayal, turned into a dragon, and flew away. She would fly over the castle whenever a new Lusignan became lord. It is for this reason that a mermaid is the Lusignan crest and dragons were their supporters. These symbols also adorned the family&#x27;s various castles.

The House of Plantagenet also claims shared ancestry from Melusine.

<doc id="1287741" wikidata="Q933061" url="?curid=1287741" title="Roger Miret and the Disasters">
<text>Roger Miret and the Disasters are a street punk group formed by Agnostic Front frontman Roger Miret. The band started when Miret was writing songs that were not a style suitable for Lady Luck (a band fronted by his wife Denise) or Agnostic Front, so he started recording them on his own on a Boss recorder. Johnny Rioux had previously mentioned he would like to work with him, so Rioux helped Miret on what originally started as a solo project. Then Miret met Rhys Kill, who liked the material and joined in on the project. The band then recorded a demo tape, with Miret and Kill on guitar, Rioux on bass and Matt Kelly from the Dropkick Murphys on drums. That six-song demo found reviewed by Lars Frederiksen, who passed it off to his Rancid bandmate Tim Armstrong. He asked Miret to put his project out on Hellcat Records. As Kelly could not continue with Miret due to his commitments with Dropkick Murphys, Miret asked Johnny Kray of The Krays and New York Rel-X to join on drums. After a couple rehearsals, they decided to make it a band.

Their first recorded appearances were in 2001, with &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot;, from the six-song demo with Matt Kelly, appearing on &quot;Scene Killer 3&quot; and covers of Cock Sparrer&#x27;s &quot;England Belongs to Me&quot; (dubbed &quot;New York Belongs to Me&quot;) and Blitz&#x27;s &quot;Voice of a Generation&quot; appearing on &quot;The Worldwide Tribute to the Real Oi! Volume 2&quot;. Their debut release was their self-titled album, which came out in September 2002. The band&#x27;s first lineup change came with Joey Nails replacing Rioux on bass by August 2003. It was then announced in January 2004 that Chris Watson replaced Nails and then Brian Darwas took over for drums as of April 2004, leaving only Miret and Kill as original members. Following one more lineup change, with Darwas moving over to bass and Mike Mulieri taking over drums as of September 2004, the band recorded their second album in Fall 2004. The album, &quot;1984&quot;, was released early the next year and became their last release on Hellcat. The next year, they released &quot;My Riot&quot; on Sailor&#x27;s Grave Records. In January 2011, the band released their fourth album, &quot;Gotta Get Up Now&quot;, on German label People Like You Records.

<text>Josef Meinrad Ackermann (born 7 February 1948) is a Swiss banker, former chairman of the Bank of Cyprus, and former chief executive officer of Deutsche Bank. He has also been a member of the Washington-based financial advisory body, the Group of Thirty.

==Early life==
He was born in Walenstadt, Canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland, raised in Mels in a Catholic home, and is a graduate of the University of St. Gallen (HSG). After studying economics and social sciences at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland, he continued his time there as a research assistant at the Department of Economics and went on to receive a doctorate in the subject.

==Career==

After leaving university Ackermann went to work in 1977 for the Swiss multinational investment bank Credit Suisse, which he left in 1996. In the same year he joined the board of directors of the Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt am Main. He served as chairman of the board from 2002 to 2012. In March 2019 the New York Times reported that Ackermann was aware of the business dealings between the New York branch of the bank and Donald Trump.

Ackermann agreed at the end of 2009 to continue as chief executive of Deutsche Bank for another three years until 2013. At the annual shareholder meeting in late May 2012, he &quot;handed over the CEO baton&quot; to co-CEOs Anshu Jain and Juergen Fitschen.

According to the &quot;Financial Times Deutschland&quot; Ackerman earned €9.4 million in 2009 and €8.8 million in 2010. His included bonus in 2009 was €8.2 million and €7.1 million in 2010. He is a member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group.

Other positions held:
* Second deputy chairman of Siemens AG (but he has announced his resignation in September 2013)
* Director of Renova Management part of Viktor Vekselberg&#x27;s Renova Group
* Non-executive director of Shell
* Visiting professor of finance at the London School of Economics
* Visiting professor at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University
* President of the board of trustees of the St. Gallen Foundation for International Studies
* President of the board of patrons of the Institute for Corporate Culture Affairs
* Chairman of the board of directors of the Institute of International Finance
* Bilderberg Meetings attendee 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014
* Chairman of the board of directors of the World Economic Forum
* Advisory board member of Macro Hive

Days after retirement and on the eve of a conference call by G7 finance ministers and central bank governors on the continuing European debt crisis, Ackerman said in a speech to the Atlantic Council that &quot;Germany will ultimately take whatever steps [are] necessary to keep the euro zone intact&quot;, according to one report. The country &quot;is moving cautiously because it simply fears that countries on the European periphery will stop reform measures if they see that Berlin is going to guarantee everything&quot;, he continued.

He was a non-executive director of Vodafone from 2000 to 2002.

==Return to banking==

In November 2014 he was elected as chairman of the board of directors of the Bank of Cyprus following the proposal of the new major shareholder of the bank Wilbur Ross, who later became the Commerce Secretary in the first Trump administration.

==Personal life==
He is married to Pirkko Mölsä.

<doc id="1287770" wikidata="Q419405" url="?curid=1287770" title="Trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine">
<text>3-Trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) is a recreational drug of the phenylpiperazine chemical class and is a substituted piperazine. Usually in combination with benzylpiperazine (BZP) and other analogues, it is sold as an alternative to the illicit drug MDMA (&quot;Ecstasy&quot;).

== Pharmacology ==
TFMPP has affinity for the 5-HT1A (Ki = 288 nM), 5-HT1B (Ki = 132 nM), 5-HT1D (Ki = 282 nM), 5-HT2A (Ki = 269 nM), and 5-HT2C (Ki = 62 nM) receptors, and functions as a full agonist at all sites except the 5-HT2A receptor, where it acts as a weak partial agonist or antagonist. Unlike the related piperazine compound &quot;meta&quot;-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), TFMPP has insignificant affinity for the 5-HT3 receptor (IC50 = 2,373 nM). TFMPP also binds to the SERT (EC50 = 121 nM) and evokes the release of serotonin. It has no effects on dopamine or norepinephrine reuptake or efflux.

TFMPP has been found to reduce aggression in rodents.

== Use and effects ==
TFMPP is rarely used by itself. In fact, TFMPP reduces locomotor activity and produces aversive effects in animals rather than self-administration, which may explain the decision of the DEA not to permanently make TFMPP a controlled substance. More commonly, TFMPP is co-administered with BZP, which acts as a norepinephrine and dopamine releasing agent. Due to the serotonin agonist effects and increase in serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine levels produced by the BZP/TFMPP combination, this mixture of drugs produces effects which crudely mimic those of MDMA.

== Side effects ==
The combination of BZP and TFMPP has been associated with a range of side effects, including insomnia, anxiety, nausea and vomiting, headaches and muscle aches which may resemble migraine, seizures, impotence, and rarely psychosis, as well as a prolonged and unpleasant hangover effect. These side effects tend to be significantly worsened when the BZP/TFMPP mix is consumed alongside alcohol, especially the headache, nausea, and hangover.

However, it is difficult to say how many of these side effects are produced by TFMPP itself, as it has rarely been marketed without BZP also being present, and all of the side effects mentioned are also produced by BZP (which has been sold as a single drug). Studies into other related piperazine drugs such as mCPP suggest that certain side effects such as anxiety, headache and nausea are common to all drugs of this class, and pills containing TFMPP are reported by users to produce comparatively more severe hangover effects than those containing only BZP. The drug can also cause the body to tremble for a long period of time.

== Legal status ==

===Canada===
Since 2012, TFMPP has been listed as a Schedule III controlled substance in Canada, making possession of TFMPP a federal offence. It has also been added to Part J of the Food and Drug Regulations thereby prohibiting the production, export or import of the substance.

===China===

As of October 2015 TFMPP is a controlled substance in China.

===Finland===
Scheduled in government decree on psychoactive substances banned from the consumer market.

===Denmark===
As of December 3, 2005, TFMPP is illegal in Denmark.

===Japan===
Since 2003, TFMPP and BZP became illegal in Japan.

===Netherlands===
TFMPP is unscheduled in the Netherlands. 

===New Zealand===
Based on the recommendation of the EACD, the New Zealand government has passed legislation which placed BZP, along with the other piperazine derivatives TFMPP, mCPP, pFPP, MeOPP and MBZP, into Class C of the New Zealand Misuse of Drugs Act 1975. A ban was intended to come into effect in New Zealand on December 18, 2007, but the law change did not go through until the following year, and the sale of BZP and the other listed piperazines became illegal in New Zealand as of 1 April 2008. An amnesty for possession and usage of these drugs remained until October 2008, at which point they became completely illegal.

===Sweden===
As of March 1, 2006, TFMPP is scheduled as a &quot;dangerous substance&quot; in Sweden.

===Switzerland===
As of December 1, 2010, TFMPP is a controlled substance in Switzerland.

===United Kingdom===
As of December 2009, TFMPP has been made a Class C drug in the United Kingdom along with BZP.

===United States===
TFMPP is not currently scheduled at the federal level in the United States, but it was briefly emergency scheduled in Schedule I. The scheduling expired in April 2004 and was not renewed. However, some states such as Florida have banned the drug in their criminal statutes making its possession a felony.

====Florida====
TFMPP is a Schedule I controlled substance in the state of Florida making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess in Florida.

====Texas====
TFMPP is controlled in Texas under Penalty Group 2, as a hallucinogenic substance. It is illegal to possess TFMPP in any quantity in Texas.

<text>York College of Pennsylvania is a private college in Spring Garden Township, Pennsylvania, near the city of York. It offers more than 70 baccalaureate majors in professional programs, the sciences, and humanities to 3,500 full-time undergraduate students. It also offers master&#x27;s programs in business, public policy, education, and nursing, along with a doctoral program in nursing practice to over 400 postgraduate students.

==History==
York College of Pennsylvania traces its institutional lineage to the York County Academy, a school opened in the 1770s in downtown York, Pennsylvania that was connected to St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, which was led by Rev. John Andrews, D.D. In 1787, the school received its charter from the General Assembly of Pennsylvania and was incorporated as the York County Academy. The academy held a close connection with St. John&#x27;s Church in York from that time until 1799. Thaddeus Stevens taught at the academy in 1815–1816, prior to establishing his law practice and serving as a U.S. congressman.

York College also traces its roots to a second institution, the York Collegiate Institute (YCI), which was founded around 1872. The building that housed the institute, located on the corner of College Avenue and Duke Street, was destroyed by fire in December 1885. A new four-story building designed by architects John A. Dempwolf and Reinhardt Dempwolf was completed at the same location in late 1886. The building was demolished in 1969 after being sold.

In 1929, the York County Academy and YCI entered into a teaching agreement, then in 1941 merged to become York Junior College. Under its new charter, the combined institution shifted its focus from elementary and secondary education to post-secondary education. At this point, the school began to outgrow its campus, forcing a move outside of downtown York. In 1965, the current campus, located in Spring Garden Township, was dedicated. The former occupier of these lands was the Outdoor Country Club and golf course, which moved north of the city after selling its property. The campus is located about west of Philadelphia and north of Baltimore. By 1968, York College established an accredited four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree program, and officially became York College of Pennsylvania.

In 1975, York College absorbed York Country Day School (YCDS), thereby expanding its mission to again encompass K-12 education. YCDS was founded in 1953 by former YCI faculty after YCI phased out the elementary and secondary programs. Today the college sits near the historic center of York City, with some of its residence halls located in the city, which is known as the first national capital of the United States of America and the birthplace of Articles of Confederation.

The paper mill that was purchased recently is slated to be turned into a knowledge park.

==Campus==

York College is currently located on three adjacent campuses with the majority of its academic buildings on the Main Campus, a few on its more recently built West Campus and several facilities on its North Campus. Despite the college&#x27;s extensive history, all the buildings on campus are less than 50 years of age, with the majority being built during the 1960s. The buildings utilize a standard red brickwork style, enhanced with white marble on some buildings. Some buildings on campus were financed with the college&#x27;s cash savings in order to avoid debt as part of an overall focus on maintaining low tuition rates.

===Main campus===

The focal point of York College&#x27;s 190-acre park-like campus is the mall, a grassy quad around which many of the college&#x27;s academic buildings are located. The Evelyn and Earle Wolf Hall is the center for artistic activity on campus. It includes three art studios, a photography facility, rehearsal and practice rooms, a multi-track recording studio and mixing control room, a music library, editing suites, studios, two video production facilities coordinated by a computer-assisted control room, and DeMeester Recital Hall, a venue that hosts various speakers as well as performances by many of the college&#x27;s musical ensembles. Also located in Wolf Hall are the York College Galleries. Comprising two adjacent galleries, the Cora Miller Gallery and the Brossman Gallery, this exhibition space serves the college, the City of York, and the communities of southcentral Pennsylvania and northern Maryland. The Galleries feature a varied program of nationally touring exhibitions and invitational shows, as well as faculty and juried student shows, artist and curator lectures, workshops, book signings, and other events.
Located adjacent to Wolf is Campbell Hall, home to the Student Success Division, which includes the Academic Advising Center, Academic Support Center, Career Development Center, Community Scholarship Program, Student Accessibility Services, Study Abroad Center, Undeclared Student Advising, and the Writing Center. Campbell also includes chemistry instrumentation to support majors in Chemistry, Forensic Chemistry and Pre-Med. Next to Campbell is the Appell Life Sciences Building, which features modern laboratory spaces, multiple specialty spaces (tissue culture suite, microscopy lab, walk-in cold room), research and preparation spaces, and student and faculty conference rooms for the departments of Biological Sciences, Behavioral Sciences and Education. Connected to Appell is the Willman Business Center, which opened in 2013 and is home to the Graham School of Business. Willman features the Weinstock Lecture Hall, a 150-seat tiered auditorium, the NASDAQ Trading Laboratory which provides students with direct access to real-time financial data from stock and commodities exchanges, and Yorkview Hall, a glass-enclosed corporate training center that offers fantastic views atop the center. 

The Naylor Ecological Sciences Center, located behind Appell, is a three-story structure topped by five greenhouses that provide teaching and research labs for ecological studies on plants and animals (Aquatic and Terrestrial Labs), a large aquarium space for students doing research with fish and invertebrates, a controlled growth chamber and research spaces.

Schmidt Library, located to the right of Willman on the mall, houses print and online collections, as well as the college&#x27;s Archives. Schmidt Library loans out wireless laptops for use in the building, digital cameras, camcorders, and media projection materials. The building also provides quiet study floors, technology-enhanced group study rooms, comfortable lounge areas, and wireless network connections including the outdoor courtyard. The Library underwent extensive interior renovations in 2004, adding 17 group study areas along with infrastructure and equipment to facilitate an increased focus on digital media.

The Waldner Performing Arts Center (WPAC) and Humanities Center occupy the space between the Schmidt Library and the Iosue Student Union. The Waldner Performing Arts Center, which opened in fall 2008, features the 705-seat York Collegiate Theatre and the 125-seat Perko Playpen Theatre, an experimental black box-type theatre. The York College Players, who perform on both stages, enjoy a scene shop, green room and costume shop. The York Collegiate Theatre hosts musical performances, nationally recognized speakers and other special events.
The Humanities Center, home to the Department of History and Political Science and the Department of English and Humanities, features an oral history lab and museum studies room, film study labs and a film screening room, computer labs, and the Pura Vida Café. The World Languages Media Center allows students to further study in languages, and the Center for Teaching and Learning offers academic support (like tutoring and writing assistance) to students.

Between the Humanities and the Iosue Student Union sits The Rock or Old Spart. After commencement, the graduating class writes their names and messages in white on a large rock painted Spartan Green.

At the center of student life is the Robert V. Iosue Student Union. Johnson Dining Hall, located on the first floor, serves breakfast, lunch and dinner, and Spart&#x27;s Den, in the lower level, offers a grab-and-go option, as well as a venue for entertainment such as comedy and music. The Student Activities and Orientation Office plans events for students, and also provide a number of leadership opportunities to more than 100 student clubs and organizations. The bookstore is a shop for student essentials. WVYC, the college radio station that broadcasts more than 100 hours each week, is located in the Student Union, as is the Admissions Welcome Center, where counselors offer information sessions and campus tours twice a day.

The Student Union also houses provides space for the nearly 100 student organizations at York College, and the Office of Residence Life occupies the second floor of the Student Union.

Adjacent to the Student Union is the Miller Administration Building. Bearing the name of the college&#x27;s first president, the building includes the President&#x27;s Office, the Office of Admissions, Academic Affairs, Business Affairs, Campus Operations, Financial Aid Office, and Registrar.
The Main campus is also home to many of York&#x27;s 900 freshman students, who may reside in either one of the residence halls in the Penn/Beard Complex or the Manor Complex. Each complex houses about 500 students in 11 (six in Penn/Beard, five in Manor) traditional-style residence halls. Upperclassman residence halls on the main campus include Susquehanna Hall and the Tyler Run Complex, which house students in apartment-style suites, each accommodating two to four students. Students may also live in one of three communal living houses on main campus: Springettsbury Hall, Pershing House, and Springdale House.

The two oldest buildings on campus are the Brougher Chapel and the President&#x27;s Home. In addition to the main worship area, Brougher contains space for religious activities, meditation, counseling and special events. As the center of faith at York, Brougher facilitates the services of a Catholic priest, Protestant minister, and Rabbi, all of whom are available to students for counseling, religious guidance, and support. There are four religious student organizations: Newman Club (Catholic Campus Ministry), Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship, Christian Fellowship Organization, and Hillel.

The President&#x27;s Home, a Williamsburg-style property adjacent to campus, is the setting for receptions for visiting artists, lecturers, and special guests.

The easternmost portion of campus features several athletic facilities: tennis courts, Spartan Softball Field, Jaquet Field (home to Spartan Baseball), the rugby field, and various intramural fields. Flowing through Main Campus is Tyler Run, a picturesque spring-fed brook lined with willows. It serves as the municipal boundary between York City and Spring Garden Township.

===West Campus===

At the center of West Campus sits the Grumbacher Sport and Fitness Center, a complex featuring the Charles Wolf Gymnasium, a 1,712-seat arena hosting varsity competition in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, volleyball and wrestling; a ten-lane competitive pool with instructional areas and 1- and 3-meter diving boards; a three-court field house; locker room facilities; a climbing wall; a cafe; and a fitness area. 

Diehl Hall houses York&#x27;s Stabler Department of Nursing, as well as the hospitality management and sports management programs. It was expanded in 2012 to better accommodate the growing needs of all three programs. Grantley Hall has general-use classrooms and is home to the Division of Advancement (Alumni Relations, Development, and Communications).

The West Campus residential quad consists of Richland Hall, Spring Garden Apartments, Brockie Commons, Country Club Apartments and Little Run Lodge, the last of which is a suite style residence hall complex which includes a student center with a dining facility, central mailboxes, multipurpose space, TV lounges, and game room. The West Campus residential quad primarily houses upperclassmen in apartment style residences that typically have room for anywhere from two to five students.

===North Campus===
The Kinsley Engineering Center, which is , features a large common project work space area to be used by the mechanical, electrical and computer engineering disciplines. The building also features gathering points for students to meet in small work groups or in social settings. The building was converted from a factory; it is LEED certified silver. It is named after the Kinsley Family Foundation.

Northside Commons is a 171-unit, five-story residence located on the northern end of campus. Completed in 2011, the building houses 275 students in single and double bedrooms. The building houses a mix of freshmen and returning students, the commons also includes lounge and common areas for residents.
Kings Mill Depot, located across the train tracks from Northside Commons, houses the college&#x27;s J.D. Brown Center for Entrepreneurship, a hub for innovation and entrepreneurial activity at York College. A key component of the J.D. Brown Center is the business incubator, which gives small businesses resources such as office space, and access to York College&#x27;s intellectual resources.

==Organization and administration==
The current president of York College is Thomas D. Burns, who was selected as the fifth president and began serving as such on July 1, 2023. He previously served as a provost at Belmont. He succeeded Pamela Gunter-Smith, who retired June 30, 2023, after 10 years as president. Other York College presidents include Ray A. Miller, Ph.D., (1968–1975) and Robert V. Iosue, Ph.D., (1976–1991). Iosue ( ) drew national attention for his controversial criticisms of what he regarded as the run-away expense of higher education. At York College, he was noted for paying faculty well but expecting them to spend more time teaching than they might be required to elsewhere. He himself worked weekends and took no vacations for eight years.

The Student Senate is the executive and administrative agency for York College students and embodies a unique system of government. All students who pay the student activity fee are automatically members of the Student Association and any student may attend meetings or address the Association on matters that are of concern to the student body.

==Academics==
York College offers its more than 50 baccalaureate majors through five schools: Graham School of Business; School of Nursing and Health Professions; Kinsley School of Engineering, Sciences, and Technology; School of Behavioral Sciences and Education; and School of the Arts, Communication, and Global Studies. Graduate offerings are master&#x27;s programs in business administration, education, and nursing, along with a doctorate in nursing practice. The college&#x27;s faculty includes 154 full-time professors. It is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.

York College&#x27;s focus is on preparing students for professional careers, while remaining an affordable private college. The college reports a 90% career placement rate.

As a cost-saving measure, York College requires its full-time professors to teach four courses per semester, compared to the norm of two or three at most U.S. colleges and universities.

===Rankings===
The college is ranked by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; as 78th (tie) in its Regional Universities of the North category as of 2018 and is named a Best Northeastern College by The Princeton Review. The college is also included in &quot;Barron&#x27;s Best Buys in College Education&quot; and is ranked by &quot;Parents and Colleges&quot; as eighth on its list of Top 10 Best Value Private Colleges and Universities. The college was listed among 100 &quot;Colleges Worth Considering&quot; nationwide by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

==Student life==

On-campus entertainment events are produced by the Campus Activities Board, a committee of the Student Senate.

York College is the host campus for WVYC, &quot;The Spartan&quot; (the student-led newspaper), and YCP Rhapsody, an a cappella singing group, along with as many as 90 other clubs and organizations. The college has two engineering-related student groups: The YCP Collegiate Engineering Society and YCP Women in Science and Engineering.

===Social organizations===
Fraternities and sororities involve around 15% of York College students. The following organizations are represented.

Fraternities:
*Zeta Beta Tau (ΖΒΤ)
*Kappa Delta Rho (ΚΔΡ) - Gamma Gamma chapter
*Kappa Delta Phi (ΚΔΦ)
*Tau Kappa Epsilon (ΤΚΕ)
*Phi Kappa Psi (ΦΚΨ) - Pennsylvania Rho chapter
*Phi Sigma Phi (ΦΣΦ)

Sororities:
*Alpha Sigma Tau (ΑΣΤ) (Suspended for varied issues, Fall 2017 but returned Spring 2023)
*Delta Phi Epsilon (ΔΦΕ)
*Delta Sigma Theta (ΔΣΘ)
*Theta Phi Alpha (ΘΦΑ) (Suspended for hazing March 20, 2015)
*Sigma Gamma Rho (ΣΓΡ)
*Sigma Delta Tau (ΣΔΤ)
*Phi Mu (ΦΜ)
*Phi Sigma Sigma (ΦΣΣ)
*Chi Upsilon Sigma(ΧΥΣ)

York College also has the Alpha Zeta chapter of the Phi Sigma Pi (ΦΣΠ) honor fraternity, Alpha Chi Sigma (ΑΧΣ) professional chemistry fraternity and the Eta Eta chapter of Sigma Theta Tau (ΣΘΤ) nursing honor society.

===Athletics===
The Athletics and Recreation department provides opportunities for students to participate in recreation, athletics and wellness activities. The department is housed in the Grumbacher Sport and Fitness Center, which features a three-court field house with elevated indoor jogging track, a gymnasium that seats 1,700 spectators, a natatorium with 12 swimming lanes, a fitness center, a climbing wall, a racquetball court, multiple-purpose rooms and a wrestling room. York College offers 22 varsity sports that compete in the Middle Atlantic Conferences. The Spartans have 10 men&#x27;s and 11 women&#x27;s programs and compete in NCAA Division III. Men&#x27;s programs include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, tennis, track and field, and wrestling. Women&#x27;s programs include basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track and field, and volleyball.

York College does not have a football team, though the sport&#x27;s absence is a popular topic for speculation. One such tale holds that the game was banned by a former board member of the college after his son suffered a fatal concussion during a football game. While the institution was operating as York Collegiate Institute, there was an active football team. The college bookstore does sell York College Football t-shirts, with the phrase &quot;Undefeated since 1787&quot; printed on the back. These are one of the more popular clothing items sold by the York College Bookstore. Though it is true that no school named York College of Pennsylvania has been defeated in football, since the &#x27;tongue-in-cheek&#x27; quip references &quot;since 1787&quot; the statement may not be one hundred percent truthful as the school did lose a football game in 1893 (when York Collegiate Institute football team lost a game as reported in &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;. However, the game played that day in 1893 did not allow forward passes nor did the center snap the ball back to a quarterback (as those rules were not adopted until 1905 when John Heisman introduced the rules). Hence, it may be reasonably argued that the game was a form of rugby football and not American football to which the phrase was clearly intended such that a York College T-shirt with the phrase &quot;Undefeated since 1787&quot; is true as York College has never lost an American football game.

<doc id="1287778" wikidata="Q3525748" url="?curid=1287778" title="Thompson (electoral district)">
<text>Thompson is a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created by redistribution in 1968 from parts of Churchill and Rupertsland (now Keewatinook), and has formally existed since the provincial election of 1969.

Thompson is in northern Manitoba. It is bordered by Keewatinook to the east and Flin Flon to the west. The city of Thompson, which was incorporated shortly before the riding&#x27;s creation, is its only major urban centre. Almost half of the riding&#x27;s residents live in that community.

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 19,349. In 1999, the average family income was $56,402, and the unemployment rate was 12.60%. The riding&#x27;s economic character is primarily working-class, with 17% of its economy coming from the mining sector.

Forty-two per cent of the riding&#x27;s residents are aboriginal, the third highest rate in the province.

Thompson is usually considered safe for the New Democratic Party, which represented the riding almost continually since its creation. The current MLA is New Democrat Eric Redhead, who was elected in the provincial by-election on June 7, 2022. His predecessor Danielle Adams was previously elected in the 2019 Manitoba general election on September 10, 2019, and served until her death on December 9, 2021.

<text>Australian speedboat Wasp III is a racing hydroplane speedboat designed and built by Harry West, which held speed records in Australia in the 1950s and 60s. It is built from plywood and powered by a heavily modified Peugeot car engine. It is designed to skim the surface so that only the propeller and the tips of the hydroplanes are immersed when it is moving. The boat currently resides in the Queensland Museum in Brisbane, Australia.

<text>High Technology High School (Abbreviated HTHS, also known as High Tech), founded in 1991, is a four-year magnet public high school for students in ninth through twelfth grades, located in the Lincroft section of Middletown Township, in Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, operated as a cooperative effort between the Monmouth County Vocational School District (MCVSD) and Brookdale Community College. It is a pre-engineering academy, offering courses such as Introduction to Engineering and Design, Exploring Engineering, and Principles of Engineering. It is a member of the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology. The school has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Elementary and Secondary Schools since 1995.

In its listing of &quot;America&#x27;s Best High Schools 2016&quot;, the school was ranked 20th out of 500 best high schools in the country; it was ranked seventh among all high schools in New Jersey. In its 2013 report on &quot;America&#x27;s Best High Schools&quot;, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; ranked the school 16th in the nation among participating public high schools and first among schools in New Jersey. According to 2011 &quot;Newsweek&quot; statistics, High Technology High School students registered an average SAT score of 2145, the highest of any U.S. high school; overall, Newsweek ranked HTHS 18th nationally and the top high school in New Jersey. In 2011, HTHS was ranked Number 1 for Best High Schools for Math &amp; Science in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, and in 2013, the school was ranked the twelfth best high school overall in the United States by &quot;U.S. News&quot;. In its 2015 rankings, Niche.com, Inc. ranked High Technology High School the best public high school in America.

As of the 2023–24 school year, the school had an enrollment of 284 students and 22.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 12.9:1. There were 6 students (2.1% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 4 (1.4% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.

==History==
The school opened its doors in 1991 with a sophomore class of 62 students in facilities on the campus of Brookdale Community College, with plans to add a new grade each year to accommodate grades 10–12.

The school building on the Brookdale campus was completed in 1992 and an expansion two years later allowed the school to double enrollment. A freshman class was added in fall 1995. The student population is kept relatively small, with typically 65-80 students per class year, allowing the school to maintain a low student–teacher ratio.

==Awards and recognition==
*In 2023, the school was one of nine schools in New Jersey that was recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School by the United States Department of Education.
*&quot;Business Insider&quot; ranked High Technology High School at the top of its 2014 list of the &quot;25 best public high school in the United States&quot;.
*For the 2003–04 school year, High Technology High School received the National Blue Ribbon Award for the second time, the highest honor that an American school can achieve.
*High Technology High School was twice named a &quot;Star School&quot; by the New Jersey Department of Education, the highest form of recognition for a New Jersey school, in both 1994-95 and 2001–02.
*High Technology High School was recognized by &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine in its May 28, 2007 issue covering America&#x27;s Best High Schools, as one of its 21 &quot;Public Elites&quot;, a group of consistent high performers excluded from its rankings because of the number of students with SAT (or ACT) scores well above the national average.
*HTHS was cited as a &quot;Public Elite&quot;, one of 22 such schools recognized nationwide in &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine&#x27;s listing of &quot;America&#x27;s Best High Schools&quot; in the May 8, 2006 issue. Newsweek described the school as &quot;A pre-engineering academy with topnotch humanities&quot;

<doc id="1287806" wikidata="Q1944516" url="?curid=1287806" title="Monica (radar)">
<text>Monica was a range-only tail warning radar for bombers, introduced by the RAF in June 1942. Officially known as ARI 5664, it operated at frequencies of around 300 MHz (on the boundary between VHF and UHF). The system was also used by the US Army Air Forces, under the name AN/APS-13, and the nickname Archie.

==History==
Monica was developed at the Bomber Support Development Unit (BSDU) in Worcestershire. After the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; became aware of Monica from a crashed bomber, German scientists developed a passive radar receiver, named Flensburg (FuG 227). From early 1944, FuG 227 was used by nightfighter crews to home in on Allied bombers using Monica. However, on the morning of 13 July 1944, a 7.&quot;Staffel&quot;/NJG 2-flown Junkers Ju 88 G-1 nightfighter equipped with Flensburg mistakenly landed at RAF Woodbridge. After examining the Flensburg equipment, the RAF ordered Monica withdrawn from all Bomber Command aircraft.
An AN/APS-13 was used as a radar altimeter during the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the 509th Composite Group, USAAF.

<doc id="1287816" wikidata="Q4292816" url="?curid=1287816" title="Miji people">
<text>The Miji, (or Sajolang) are a social group of Arunachal Pradesh, India. They are located in various districts of Arunachal Pradesh including the West Kameng, East Kameng and Kurung Kumey.Their population of 37,000 are found near the lower parts of the sub-Himalayan hills bordering Assam; they speak the Sajalong language.

==Etymology==
The two separate terms &quot;Mai&quot;, which means fire, and Ji, which signifies giver, are combined to form the word &quot;Miji&quot;. The word/name came into being after the Hrusso community regarded the &quot;Sajolang/Dammai&quot; people for their gracious help during the past (pre-historic period).

==Dress==

The traditional costume of Miji women consists of an ankle-length white garment with a beautifully decorated red jacket. Unlike the majority of other tribes of Arunachal Pradesh, India; the Miji people wear silver ornaments, and glass/brass based necklaces. Indigenous cosmetics are made from pine resin and coal ( specially during marriage ceremonies).
The traditional dress of Miji community constitute of (1)_Grii za (cotton cloth), (2)_ornamental beads, (3)_silver/Bamboo crown, (4)_Gichin thay ( long cotton cloth, red in colour, which serves as a belt), (5)_waichin ( sword ), (6)_Lai lo (cotton cloth to cover lower portion of legs), (7)_Lai Drangk (ornamental beads to keep Lai lo intact), and other ornaments including necklaces, bangles and ear tops.

==Religion==
Most Miji are adherents of Animism, although a few have adopted Christianity. The Mijis practise a distinct religion which rely entirely on nature and god ( nature- being the replica of god. The supreme deity worshipped is Zhanglhang-Miungzhin; Mijis believe that god prevail in every aspects of nature, such as trees, water tributaries and even stones.
Chindang, marked every 15 October, is considered the main festival of the Mijis, inhabiting the Lada circle of the East Kameng district, Sarli region of the Kurung Kumey district and Nafra and Bomdila Sub-Division of the West Kameng district with a few of them also found in the Assam-Arunachal border towns of Sessa and Bhalukpong who settled down there some time ago because of better access to facilities. Culturally and linguistically, the Miji and Hrusso Akas form a cognate group. Their ancestors are called Bor(Robo),or the brother of Tanis, like the Nyishis, Apatanis, Tagins, Galos and the Adis which share common features but are also distinct in themselves. Robo being the elder brother and Nyibo (tani) being younger are actual brothers, who belonged to same father.

There is some Buddhist influence as a result of long-standing cultural contacts with Buddhist tribes to the west, and the celebration of Losar as well as the usage of prayer flags are some indicators of this.

==Classification==
The Mijis or the Sajolangs are classified under three categories :

===Western Miji===
The Mijis inhabiting the Bomdila-Nafra division in West Kameng district are recognized as the Western Miji.

===Eastern Miji===
Occupying the Lada-Bana tract in the East Kameng district, one can find a sizeable amount of the group well adjusted with the Akas, their very brethren tribe and the comparatively larger tribe Nyishi.
The eastern Mijis shares little contrast in terms of language vocabulary with their western counterparts and together they institute the broader Sajolang group.

===Northern Miji===
The third is the most debilitated and ambiguous group known as Bangru, also known as Bengru in China. Not very much studies have been done on this group and the tribe lives in acute isolation. These groups are mainly found in Sarli circle and the numerous adjacent villages in Kurung Kumey district. Researchers have also claimed that this same people are also found in Longzi County, Shannan Prefecture in China where they are categorised under the wider Lhoba ethnicity.

<text>The FuG 227 &quot;Flensburg&quot; was a German passive radar receiver developed by Siemens &amp; Halske and introduced into service in early 1944. It used wing and tail-mounted dipole antennae and was sensitive to the mid-VHF band frequencies of 170–220 MHz, subharmonics of the Monica radar&#x27;s 300 MHz transmissions. It allowed Luftwaffe nightfighters to home in on the Monica tail warning radar fitted to RAF bombers.

An RAF bomber with Monica radar crashed in German-occupied territory in February 1943 allowing for the development of Flensburg. The British set was captured just seven days into its operational life in February 1943. On the morning of 13 July 1944, a Junkers Ju 88G-1 night fighter of 7.&quot;Staffel&quot;/NJG 2 equipped with Flensburg landed at RAF Woodbridge by mistake and was captured. When British military scientists examined the Flensburg equipment, they quickly realised its purpose and informed the RAF, who ordered Monica to be withdrawn from all RAF Bomber Command aircraft.

Subsequently, further variants of Flensburg (Flensburg II to Flensburg VI) were developed for detecting Allied radar jammers. Only Flensburg II and III were used operationally.

<text>Stephen Dunifer (born 1951/1952) is an American radio engineer, author and anarchist socialist who founded Free Radio Berkeley in 1993 Berkeley, California. 

Free Radio Berkeley, an unlicensed micropower pirate radio station, was an expression of Dunifer&#x27;s socialist anarchist principles, and was inspired by Black Liberation Radio in Springfield, Illinois and by Japanese micropower radio stations. Free Radio Berkeley was involved in a protracted legal case with the Federal Communications Commission in the mid-1990s. At the time, it was illegal to broadcast on less than 100 watts.

<text>Copper electroplating is the process of electroplating a layer of copper onto the surface of a metal object. Copper is used both as a standalone coating and as an undercoat onto which other metals are subsequently plated. The copper layer can be decorative, provide corrosion resistance, increase electrical and thermal conductivity, or improve the adhesion of additional deposits to the substrate.

==Overview==
Copper electroplating takes place in an electrolytic cell using electrolysis. As with all plating processes, the part to be plated must be cleaned before depositing metal to remove soils, grease, oxides, and defects. After precleaning, the part is immersed in the cell&#x27;s aqueous electrolyte solution and functions as the cathode. A copper anode is also immersed in the solution. During plating, a direct electric current is applied to the cell which causes the copper in the anode to dissolve into the electrolyte through oxidation, losing electrons and ionizing into copper cations. The copper cations form a coordination complex with salts present in the electrolyte, after which they are transported from the anode to the cathode. At the cathode, the copper ions are reduced to metallic copper by gaining electrons. This causes a thin, solid, metallic copper film to deposit onto the surface of the part.

The anodes can be either simple copper slabs or titanium or steel baskets filled with copper nuggets or balls. The anodes may be placed in anode bags, which are typically made of polypropylene or another fabric and are used to contain insoluble particles that flake off the anode and prevent them from contaminating the plating bath.

Copper electroplating baths can be used to plate either a &quot;strike&quot; or &quot;flash&quot; coating, which is a thin highly-adherent initial layer that is plated with additional layers of metal and that serves to improve adhesion of the subsequent layers to the underlying substrate, or a thicker coating of copper that may serve as the finish layer or as a standalone coating.

==Types of plating chemistries==

There are a variety of different electrolyte chemistries that can be used for copper electroplating, but most can be broadly characterized into five general categories based on the complexing agent:
# Alkaline cyanide
# Alkaline non-cyanide
# Acid sulfate
# Acid fluoroborate
# Pyrophosphate

=== Alkaline cyanide ===

Alkaline cyanide baths have historically been one of the most commonly-used plating chemistries for copper electrodeposition. Cyanide copper baths typically provide high covering and throwing power, allowing uniform and complete coverage of the substrate, but often plate at lower current efficiency. They produce a metal finish favored for its diffusion blocking character. Diffusion blocking is used to improve the long term adherence of different metals, e.g. chromium and steel. It is also used to prevent the second material from diffusing into the substrate.

Cyanide baths contain cuprous cyanide as the source of copper(I) ions, sodium or potassium cyanide as a source of free cyanide that complexes with cuprous cyanide to render it soluble, and sodium or potassium hydroxide for increased conductivity and pH control. Baths may also contain Rochelle salts and sodium or potassium carbonate, as well as a variety of proprietary additives. Cyanide copper baths can be used as low-efficiency strike-only baths, medium-efficiency strike-plate baths, and high efficiency plating baths.

==== Bath composition ====
==== Operating conditions ====
* Temperature: 24-66 °C (strike); 40-55 °C (strike-plate); 60-71 °C (high-efficiency)
* Cathode current density: 0.5-4.0 A/dm2 (strike); 1.0-1.5 A/dm2 (strike-plate); 8.6 A/dm2 (high-efficiency)
* Current efficiency: 30-60% (strike); 30-50% (strike-plate); 90-99% (high-efficiency);
* pH: &gt;11.0

==== Toxicity ====

Commercial platers typically use a copper cyanide solution, which retains a high concentration of copper. However, the presence of free cyanide in the baths makes them dangerous due to the highly toxic nature of cyanide. This creates both health hazards as well as issues with waste disposal.

=== Alkaline non-cyanide ===

Due to safety concerns surrounding the use of cyanide-based plating chemistry, alkaline copper plating baths that do not contain cyanide have been developed. However, they generally see only limited use compared with the more common cyanide-based alkaline chemistry.

=== Acid sulfate ===
Acid copper sulfate electrolytes are relatively simple solutions of copper sulfate and sulfuric acid that are cheaper and easier to maintain and control than cyanide copper electrolytes. Compared to cyanide baths, they provide higher current efficiency and allow for higher current density and thus faster plating rates, but they usually have less throwing power, although high-throw variations exist. Additionally, they cannot be used to plate directly onto less-noble metals such as steel or zinc without first applying a cyanide-based strike or other barrier layer, otherwise the acid in the bath will cause an immersion coating to form that will compromise adhesion. Due to this phenomenon as well as the lower throwing power, acid sulfate baths are not usually used as strike baths.

Along with alkaline cyanide, acid copper baths are among the most commonly-used copper plating electrolytes, with industrial applications that include decorative plating, electroforming, rotogravure, and printed circuit board and semiconductor fabrication.

Acid sulfate baths contain cupric sulfate as the source of copper(II) ions; sulfuric acid to increase bath conductivity, ensure copper salt solubility, decrease anode and cathode polarization, and increase throwing power; and a source of chloride ions such as hydrochloric acid or sodium chloride, which helps reduce anode polarization and prevents striated deposits from forming. Most baths also contain a variety of organic additives to help refine the grain structure, improve ductility, and brighten the deposit. Variations of the acid copper electrolyte include general-purpose baths, high-throw baths, and high-speed baths. The high-throw and high-speed baths are used when greater throwing power and faster plating rates are required, including for printed circuit board fabrication where high throw is required to plate the low-current-density areas in the through holes.

==== Bath composition ====
==== Operating conditions ====
* Temperature: Usually ambient, although some baths may operate as high as 43 °C
* Cathode current density: 2–20 A/dm2 (general purpose); 1.5–5 A/dm2 (high throw); 5–20 A/dm2 (high speed)
* Current efficiency: 100%

==== Additives ====
Various common and proprietary additives have been developed for acid copper electrolytes to help improve throwing and leveling power, brighten the finish, control hardness and ductility, and impart other desired properties to the deposit. Historical formulations dating to the mid-20th century often used thiourea and molasses, while other formulations used various gums, carbohydrates, and sulfonic acids.

For semiconductor and printed circuit board applications, acid copper baths use additives that facilitate plating in high-aspect-ratio vias and through holes. Such additives can be grouped into three categories: 
* Suppressors (also known as inhibitors or carriers) (typically polyethers such as polyethylene glycol or polypropylene glycol)
* Accelerators (also known as brighteners) (typically thiols or disulfides such as 3-Mercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid or bis-(3-sodium sulfopropyl) disulfide)
* Levelers (examples include dyes such as Janus Green B, Alcian Blue, and Diazine Black)

Without these additives, copper will preferentially deposit on the surface near the top of the vias instead of inside the vias due to the lower local current density inside the vias, leading to top-down via filling and undesirable voids. The suppressor inhibits plating near the top of the via and the surface, while the brightener accelerates plating near the bottom of the via. The leveler helps prevent buildup at the via opening and creates a smoother surface finish.

=== Acid fluoroborate === 
Copper fluoroborate baths are similar to acid sulfate baths, but they use fluoroborate as the anion rather than sulfate. Copper fluoroborate is much more soluble than copper sulfate, which allows one to dissolve larger quantities of copper salt into the bath, enabling much higher current densities than what is possible in copper sulfate baths. Their main use is for high-speed plating where high current densities are required. Drawbacks to the fluoroborate chemistry include lower throwing power than acid sulfate baths, higher cost to operate, and greater safety hazards and waste treatment concerns.

Acid fluoroborate baths contain cupric tetrafluoroborate and fluoroboric acid. Boric acid is typically added to the bath to prevent hydrolysis of the fluoroborate ions, which generates free fluoride in the bath. Unlike acid sulfate baths, fluoroborate baths usually do not contain organic additives.

==== Bath composition ====
==== Operating conditions ====
* Temperature: 18-66 °C
* Cathode current density: 13-38 A/dm2 (high concentration); 8-13 A/dm2 (low concentration)
* pH: 0.2-0.6 (high concentration); 1.0-1.7 (low concentration)

=== Pyrophosphate ===
Pyrophosphate copper plating baths possess gentler chemistry compared to the toxic alkaline cyanide baths and the corrosive acid copper baths, operating at mildly alkaline pH and utilizing relatively non-toxic pyrophosphate compounds. While pyrophosphate electrolytes are easier to waste treat than alkaline cyanide and acid plating baths, they are more difficult to maintain and control. Pyrophosphate baths offer high throwing power and produce bright, ductile deposits, making them particularly useful for printed circuit board fabrication where high throw is required for plating high-aspect-ratio through holes.

Pyrophosphate baths contain cupric pyrophosphate as a source of copper(II) ions, potassium pyrophosphate as a source of free pyrophosphate that increases bath conductivity and helps with anode dissolution, ammonia for increased anode dissolution and deposit grain refinement, and a source of nitrate ions such as potassium or ammonium nitrate to decrease cathode polarization and increase the maximum allowed current density. When the bath is made up, the copper pyrophosphate and potassium pyrophosphate react to form a complex, [K6Cu(P2O7)2], which dissociates to form the Cu(P2O7)26− anion from which copper deposits. Variations of the pyrophosphate electrolyte include general-purpose baths, strike baths, and printed circuit baths. Printed circuit baths typically contain organic additives to improve ductility and throwing power.

In pyrophosphate baths, orthophosphate ions are formed from the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate and tend to build up in the electrolyte over time, which presents maintenance challenges. Orthophosphate ions decrease bath throwing power and deposit ductility at concentrations above 40–60 g/L, and they lead to lower solution conductivity, banded deposits, and lower bright current density range at concentrations beyond 100 g/L. Orthophosphate is removed from the bath by either doing partial bails and dilutions or by completely dumping and remaking the bath.

==Current control==

It is important to control the current to produce the smoothest copper surface possible. With a higher current, hydrogen bubbles will form on the item to be plated, leaving surface imperfections. Often various other chemicals are added to improve plating uniformity and brightness. These additives can be anything from dish soap to proprietary compounds. Without some form of additive, it is almost impossible to obtain a smooth plated surface.

The surface formed always needs to be polished to achieve a shine. As formed it has a matte luster.

== Applications ==

Excluding the continuous strip plating industry, copper is the second most commonly-plated metal after nickel. Copper electroplating offers a number of advantages over other plating processes, including low metal cost, high-conductivity and high-ductility bright finish, and high plating efficiency. The process has a variety of both decorative and engineering applications.

=== Decorative applications ===
Decorative copper electroplating takes advantage of the high levelling power of copper bath formulations that produce bright deposits, the ability of copper to cover defects in the base metal, and the softness of copper that makes it easy to buff and polish for a glossy finish. While copper may be used as the final decorative surface layer, it is usually subsequently plated with other metals that are more resistant to wear or tarnish such as chromium, nickel, or gold; in this case, the brightness of the copper undercoat enhances the appearance of the subsequent finish layer. Products that utilize decorative copper plating include automotive trim, furniture, door and cabinet handles, light fixtures, kitchen utensils, other household goods, and apparel.

Copper plating is also used for minting currency.

=== Engineering applications ===
Copper electroplating sees widespread usage in the manufacture of electrical and electronic devices, owing to copper&#x27;s high electrical conductivity – it is the second-most electrically conductive metal after silver. Copper is electroplated onto printed circuit boards to add metal to the through holes and fabricate the board&#x27;s conductive circuit traces. This is done either through a subtractive process where copper is plated as a blanket unpatterned layer that is subsequently etched with a patterned mask to form the desired circuitry (panel plating), or through an additive or semi-additive process where a patterned mask that exposes the desired circuitry is applied to the board followed by copper plating onto the unmasked circuit areas (pattern plating). The semiconductor industry uses the damascene process to pattern-plate copper into vias and trenches of interconnects for metallization. Copper is also used to plate steel wire for electrical cabling applications.

As a soft metal, copper is also malleable and so has the inherent flexibility to maintain adhesion even if a substrate is subject to being bent and manipulated post plating. When electroplated, copper provides a smooth and even coverage which therefore provides an excellent base for additional coating or plating processes. Corrosion resistance is another advantage to copper. Although copper is not as effective at resisting corrosion as nickel and so is commonly used as a base layer for nickel if enhanced corrosion protection is needed; typically the case for materials that are required to work in marine and subsea environments. Lastly, copper has anti-bacterial properties and so is used in some medical applications.

<text>Damai ( ; IAST: &quot;Damāĩ&quot;) is an occupational caste found among Khas people comprising 45 subgroups. Their surnames take after the subgroup they belong to. People belonging to this caste are traditionally tailors and musicians capable of using the naumati baja - an ensemble of nine traditional musical instruments. The term Damai is coined from the musical instrument Damaha. The 1854 Nepalese Muluki Ain (Legal Code) categorized Damai as &quot;Lower caste” category.

The Government of Nepal abolished the caste-system and criminalized any caste-based discrimination, including &quot;untouchability&quot; in 1963. The country, previously ruled by a Hindu monarchy was a Hindu nation which has now become a secular state. It was declared a republic in 2008, thereby ending it as the Hindu kingdom with its caste-based discriminations and the untouchability roots.

According to the 2021 Nepal census, Damai make up 1.94% of Nepal&#x27;s population (or 565,932 people). Damai are categorized under &quot;Hill Dalit&quot; among the 9 broad social groups, along with Kami, Badi, Sarki and Gaine by the Government of Nepal.

<doc id="1287841" wikidata="Q5508034" url="?curid=1287841" title="Full Faith and Credit Clause">
<text>Article IV, Section 1 of the United States Constitution, the Full Faith and Credit Clause, addresses the duty that states within the United States have to respect the &quot;public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state&quot;. According to the Supreme Court, there is a difference between the credit owed to laws (i.e. legislative measures and common law) as compared to the credit owed to judgments. Judges and lawyers agree on the meaning of the clause with respect to the recognition of judgments rendered by one state in the courts of another. Barring exceptional circumstances, one state must enforce a judgment by a court in another, unless that court lacked jurisdiction, even if the enforcing court otherwise disagrees with the result. At present, it is widely agreed that this clause of the Constitution has a minimal impact on a court&#x27;s choice of law decision provided that no state&#x27;s sovereignty is infringed, although this clause of the Constitution was once interpreted to have greater impact.

== Text ==
Article IV, Section 1:

== Background ==
A similar clause existed in Article IV of the Articles of Confederation, the predecessor to the U.S. Constitution: &quot;Full faith and credit shall be given in each of these States to the records, acts, and judicial proceedings of the courts and magistrates of every other State.&quot; In 1781, a committee of the Continental Congress reported that execution of that clause in the Articles of Confederation required a declaration of two different things: &quot;[1] the method of exemplifying records and [2] the operation of the Acts and judicial proceedings of the Courts of one State contravening those of the States in which they are asserted.&quot;

A Pennsylvania court stated in 1786, that this provision in the Articles of Confederation did not direct that &quot;executions might issue in one state upon the judgments given in another&quot;, but rather was &quot;chiefly intended to oblige each state to receive the records of another as full evidence of such acts and judicial proceedings.&quot;

At the 1787 Constitutional Convention, James Madison said that he wanted to supplement that provision in the Articles of Confederation, to let Congress &quot;provide for the execution of Judgments in other States, under such regulations as might be expedient.&quot; By September 1, 1787, negotiations at the Constitutional Convention had led to the following draft which included supplementary language as Madison had requested, similar to what the committee of the Continental Congress had reported in 1781:

After several further modifications, the Full Faith and Credit Clause assumed the form in which it remains today. James Wilson said during the constitutional convention that, if Congress were to not use its power under the latter part of this clause, then the former part of this clause &quot;would amount to nothing more than what now takes place among all Independent Nations&quot;. Later, during the ratification process, James Madison remarked further on this subject, in &quot;Federalist&quot; No. 42. He wrote that the corresponding clause in the Articles of Confederation was &quot;extremely indeterminate, and can be of little importance under any interpretation which it will bear&quot;. Of the expanded clause in the Constitution, Madison wrote that it established a power that &quot;may be rendered a very convenient instrument of justice, and be particularly beneficial on the borders of contiguous States.&quot;

== Interpretation ==
In 1790, shortly after the Constitution had been ratified, Congress took action under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, enacting that &quot;the records and judicial proceedings, authenticated as aforesaid, shall have such faith and credit given to them in every Court within the United States, as they have by law or usage in the Courts of the state from whence the said records are or shall be taken.&quot; In 1813, the Supreme Court interpreted this federal statute, in the leading case of &quot;Mills v. Duryee&quot;, where the judgment of a New York court was used in a local District of Columbia court. Justice Joseph Story wrote for the Court that it was the federal statute (rather than the constitutional provision) that made records from one state effective in another state:

Although the Court was engaged in statutory interpretation in &quot;Mills&quot;, the Court eventually characterized &quot;Mills&quot; as a constitutional decision, in the 1887 case of &quot;Chicago &amp; Alton v. Wiggins&quot;. During the following decades and centuries, the Supreme Court has recognized a &quot;public policy exception&quot; to both the Full Faith and Credit Clause and the accompanying federal statute. In 1939, the Court in &quot;Pacific Employers Insurance v. Industrial Accident&quot; wrote:
[T]here are some limitations upon the extent to which a state may be required by the full faith and credit clause to enforce even the judgment of another state in contravention of its own statutes or policy. See &quot;Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance Co.&quot;, 127 U.S. 265; &quot;Huntington v. Attrill&quot;, 146 U.S. 657; &quot;Finney v. Guy&quot;, 189 U.S. 335; see also &quot;Clarke v. Clarke&quot;, 178 U.S. 186; &quot;Olmsted v. Olmsted&quot;, 216 U.S. 386; &quot;Hood v. McGehee&quot;, 237 U.S. 611; cf. &quot;Gasquet v. Fenner&quot;, 247 U.S. 16. And in the case of statutes...the full faith and credit clause does not require one state to substitute for its own statute, applicable to persons and events within it, the conflicting statute of another state, even though that statute is of controlling force in the courts of the state of its enactment with respect to the same persons and events.

The Supreme Court continues to apply its public policy exception differently for state judgments as compared to state laws. In the 2003 case of &quot;Franchise Tax Board v. Hyatt&quot;, the Court reiterated that, &quot;[o]ur precedent differentiates the credit owed to laws (legislative measures and common law) and to judgments.&quot;

If the legal pronouncements of one state conflict with the public policy of another state, federal courts in the past have been reluctant to force a state to enforce the pronouncements of another state in contravention of its own public policy. In cases of out-of-state judgments, the Court has stated that there may be exceptions to the enforcement and jurisdiction of out-of-state judgments, but maintains that there is no public policy exception to the Full Faith and Credit Clause for judgments.

Federal statutory law (28 USC § 1738) provides that:

== Application to family law ==
The Full Faith and Credit Clause has been applied to orders of protection, for which the clause was invoked by the Violence Against Women Act, and child support, for which the enforcement of the clause was spelled out in the Federal Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act ().

Until the Supreme Court struck down all laws banning interracial marriage in 1967, a number of states banned interracial marriage and did not recognize marriage certificates issued in other states for interracial couples. The full faith and credit clause was never used to force a state to recognize a marriage it did not wish to recognize. However, the existence of a common-law marriage in a sister state (still available in nine states and the District of Columbia) has been recognized in divorce or dissolution of marriage cases.

The clause&#x27;s application to state-sanctioned same-sex marriages, civil unions, and domestic partnerships is unresolved, although the case of marriage has been rendered moot. In 1996 the U.S. Congress enacted the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a statute defining marriage as being between one man and one woman for federal purposes and allowed states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. Whether the latter provision of DOMA violated the Full Faith and Credit Clause was debated among legal commentators. Some scholars viewed DOMA as a violation of the Full Faith and Credit Clause. Other legal scholars disagreed. Ultimately, the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot; struck down DOMA as a violation of the Constitution&#x27;s Equal Protection Clause and did not address the Full Faith and Credit Clause in its decision.

In March 2016, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;V.L. v. E.L.&quot; that under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, the State of Alabama must recognize the adoption decree granted to a same-sex couple by a Georgia state court in 2007, regardless of how that court came to its conclusion granting the decree.

The Respect for Marriage Act repealed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and required the U.S. federal government to recognize the validity of same-sex and interracial marriages in the United States, and to protect religious liberty. Its author, Senator Tammy Baldwin, has stated that its constitutional authority stems from the Full Faith and Credit Clause.

== Global influence ==
The wording of this clause was closely followed by the framers of the Constitution of Australia from 1901, namely, in Section 118 of the Constitution of Australia.

<text>Axarquía () is a of Andalusia in southern Spain. It is the wedge-shaped area east of Málaga. Its name is traced back to Arabic (, meaning &quot;the eastern [region]&quot;). It extends along the coast and inland. Its coastal towns make up the Costa del Sol Oriental - one of the sunniest places in mainland Spain with the average of 320 sunny days a year. The natives of the region are called .

The is composed of 31 municipalities, of which the capital is Vélez-Málaga. The Vélez, Algarrobo and Torrox rivers all run through the region. Its highest mountain is La Maroma, highest point of the Sierra de Tejeda, Penibaetic System.

The Axarquía is also known as Axarquía-Costa del Sol, for it includes the sector of the Costa del Sol, east of Málaga city made up of Rincón de la Victoria, Vélez-Málaga, Algarrobo, Torrox and Nerja municipal terms.

== Etymology ==
The Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy defines the word &quot;jarquía&quot; (&quot;xarquía&quot; in old Castilian) as &quot;district or territory located east of a great city and dependent on it&quot; and says that it proceeds from Arabic  &quot;Šarqiyya&quot;, meaning &quot;eastern part&quot; or &quot; eastern.&quot; It coincides with the region of Axarquia which lies in the east of Málaga. The Royal Academy, in its spelling of the Spanish Language, 1999 edition, explains that, in old Castilian, consonant fricative phoneme  represented the palatal [ʃ] as in English sh sound, found in words like Axarquía, Don Quixote, Mexico, Texas etc.

== Municipalities ==
The Axarquía &quot;comarca&quot; consists of the following municipalities:

<doc id="1287861" wikidata="Q1430311" url="?curid=1287861" title="Shahtoosh">
<text>Shahtoosh (from Persian شاهتوش &#x27;king of wools&#x27;), also known as Shatoush, is a wool obtained from the fur of the chiru (&quot;Pantholops hodgsonii&quot;, also called Tibetan antelope). Also, shawls made from the wool of the chiru are called shahtoosh. Shahtoosh is the finest animal wool, followed by vicuña wool.

As undomesticated wild animals, the chirus cannot be shorn, so they are killed for this purpose. Due to the severe decline of the chiru population by 90% in the second half of the 20th century, they were internationally classified as a critically endangered species until 2016. Since 2016, they have been classified as a near threatened species due to species conservation programs and partial recovery of population size. The wool is mostly used to make luxurious scarves and shawls, although the production, sale, and acquisition of shahtoosh has been illegal under CITES since 1979. On the black market, shahtoosh shawls fetch prices ranging from $5,000 to $20,000.

== Properties ==
The average fiber diameter of the down hair is 11.45 microns with a standard deviation of 1.78 microns and a coefficient of variation of 15.55 %, and a span from 6.25 to 16.25 microns. Because of the small fiber diameter, the down hair of the chirus is the finest of all animal hairs. The down hair is wavy and mosaic scaled with a scale spacing of 5.3 scales per 100 microns. The scale width tapers in the upward direction of the hair to the next scale ring. At the scale edge, the hair is thicker, making the fiber diameter uneven along the length of the hair. The hair of the chirus is beige to gray, and white on the belly. Only 12-14 % of the down hair is white and more expensive. The lighter the hair color, the lighter shades can be dyed.

The guard hairs are separated from the down hair by sorting. However, due to the fineness and low tensile strength of the fiber, sorting can only be done manually and incompletely, resulting in guard hairs in scarves. Due to tiny air bubbles in the hair, the guard hairs of shatoosh show a pattern like laid stone slabs under a light microscope. This allows shatoosh to be distinguished from cashmere wool products under a light microscope, where guard hairs of cashmere wool look like dark stripes with light-colored edges.

== Use ==
The animals, which live wild on the Tibetan Plateau, the Changtang region, Tibet, Xinjiang, and Qinghai and are under species protection, are killed for the illegal production of textiles in order to obtain the particularly fine warming wool hair of the undercoat. The wool of three to five animals is needed for a scarf, as each chiru produces only about 125-150 grams of the raw wool. Therefore, the population of about one million in the 1950s dropped drastically to an estimated 45,000 (1998 estimate) or 75,000 (2000 estimate) and recovered to about 150,000 animals by 2009 due to species protection. The wool is shipped from the Tibetan Changtang area to Kashmir in India, where it is processed into scarves in the Srinagar area. In 2003, it was estimated that 14,293 people were directly or indirectly involved in the production of shahtoosh shawls. Efforts are underway in India to domesticate some chirus so that shorn shatoosh can be legally used.

Shahtoosh wool is spun and woven, either in rectangular plain weave or diamond-shaped plain weave (called &quot;chashme bulbul&quot; &#x27;eye of the nightingale&#x27; or &#x27;diamond weave&#x27;). Shahtoosh shawls can be pulled through a ring due to the small diameter of the fibers (&#x27;ring test&#x27;), although this also applies to thinly woven shawls made from other wools. By admixing pashmina, shahtoosh can be embroidered more extensively. Blended fabrics of shahtoosh and pashmina are designated differently according to the proportions: &quot;Shurah Dani&quot; = 100% Shahtoosh, &quot;Bah Dani&quot; = 75% Shahtoosh and 25% Pashmina, &quot;Aeth Dani&quot; = 50% Shahtoosh (as warp) and 50% Pashmina (as weft). Shawls for women are often 2 m × 1 m in size and weigh circa 100 g, while shawls for men are often 3 m × 1.5 m (called &quot;doshala&quot;).

== Law enforcement ==
An investigation on a 1994 charity event in New York by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service led to the subpoenaing of celebrities who purchased shahtoosh scarves, as well as the first criminal cases for the sale of this material in the US. In April 2000, British authorities fined a London-based trading company for the illegal possession of 138 scarves. Between 2010 and 2018, a total of 295 scarves were confiscated in Switzerland, corresponding to an average of 33 scarves per year. Despite some successful arrests of illegal trafficking rings, a large number of &quot;petty criminals&quot; get away with it, as it is usually claimed to be pashmina or similar legal fabrics. A clear clarification that can be used in court is only obtained after a laboratory examination (DNA test, measurement under a light microscope or a scanning electron microscope).

== History ==
Under Emperor Akbar, the imperial wardrobe began to utilize Tus or Shahtoos on a large scale. It was the costliest, warmest and most delicate shawl. It was soft enough to pass through a finger ring. Its natural colours were black, white and red. It is said that Akbar once gave orders for the white to be dyed into red, but the shawl did not take the colour of the dye. People began to use it simply in its natural colours.

<doc id="1287864" wikidata="Q71404" url="?curid=1287864" title="Hans Singer">
<text>Sir Hans Wolfgang Singer (29 November 1910 – 26 February 2006) was a German-born British development economist best known for the Prebisch-Singer thesis, which states that the terms of trade move against producers of primary products. He is one of the primary figures of heterodox economics.

==Early life==
He was born in Elberfeld, Germany (then the German Empire) on 29 November 1910. A German Jew, Singer had intended to become a medical doctor before he was inspired to study economics after attending a series of lectures by prominent economists Joseph Schumpeter and Arthur Spiethoff in Bonn. Singer fled the rise of Adolf Hitler in 1933, arriving in the United Kingdom as a refugee.

==Career==
In 1933, Schumpeter convinced John Maynard Keynes of Cambridge University to accept Singer as one of his first PhD candidates, and Singer received his doctorate in 1936. His first academic post was in Manchester where he stayed from 1938 until 1944. Under Keynes, he produced two papers in 1937 and 1940 studying unemployment. Keynes had also helped secure Singer&#x27;s speedy release after his former student was interned by the British government at the start of the Second World War. In 1938, Singer applied for British citizenship, listing as references Keynes, William Beveridge, William Temple, and the vice-chancellor of Manchester University. His request was granted in 1946. 

There, he authored the 1949 UN publication on &quot;Relative prices of exports and imports of under-developed countries&quot;, where he noted that the terms of trade for primary products had been declining for more than half a century, reversing the improving trend before 1870. Theoretically, this could happen if productivity increased faster in primary production than in industry, but this was hardly plausible. Instead, this meant that &quot;the underdeveloped countries helped to maintain, in the prices which they paid for their imports, a rising standard of living in the industrialized countries, without receiving, in the price of their own products, a corresponding equivalent contribution towards their own standard of living&quot;. Raul Prebisch read this report in manuscript form and incorporated both the data and the conclusions into his own report for the UN Commission for Latin America. Singer&#x27;s controversial conclusions were rejected by the subcommission and was the reason why Prebisch in turn avoided the general fate of UN authors to remain anonymous, the idea being to present the views as belonging to the individual author rather than being the objective, officially sanctioned position of the UN. When Singer henceforth wanted to express these views, he too had to publish under his own name, which he did in a 1950 article on the costs of international trade.

This drew criticism from fellow economists Jacob Viner and Gottfried Haberler and led to his fame as co-originator with Raul Prebisch for the Prebisch-Singer thesis. Since, it was well-known at the time that Singer was the author of the 1949 UN publication on relative prices, it was also referred to as the Singer-Prebisch theorem, to indicate the primacy of authorship. The fundamental claim of the hypothesis is that poorer nations that specialise in primary products such as raw materials and agricultural products will become the losers from the terms of trade when exchanging their goods for manufactures from rich industrialised nations. The theorem posed, and the falling terms of trade showed, that productivity gains made by the primary producer generated lower prices for industrial consumers, while productivity gains by industrial nations were reflected in greater output but not in lower export prices for industrial goods. In this exchange, all of the benefits of international trade went to the wealthy industrial nations, both as consumers and as producers.

As a result, Singer was a passionate advocate for increased foreign aid in a variety of forms to the developing world to offset the disproportionate gain to developed nations of trade. He attempted to create a &quot;soft-loan&quot; fund to offer loans at interest rates below market rates to be administered by the United Nations, but it was systematically blocked by the United States and the United Kingdom, which wished to retain control of money flowing out of the UN. He was thus considered &quot;one of the wild men of the UN&quot; by Eugene R. Black Sr. of the World Bank and American Senator Eugene McCarthy. His ideas were influential in the establishment of the bank&#x27;s International Development Association, the United Nations Development Programme, and the World Food Programme.

Fellow economist Sir Alec Cairncross has said of Singer, &quot;There are few of the developing countries that he has not visited and still fewer that he has not advised. He must have addressed a wider variety of academics and a wider variety of places about a wider variety of subjects than any other economist, living or dead.&quot; Singer, like Prebisch, was influential on neo-Marxist development theorists such as Paul Baran and Andre Gunder Frank, although these focused on transfers of profits as a mechanism of exploitation rather than the terms of trade. However, he was not normally considered a neo-Marxist himself and did not consider himself one.

==Later life==
In 1969, he left the UN to join the influential Institute of Development Studies (IDS) at the University of Sussex in England. He produced about 30 books under his name and nearly 300 other publications. The International Institute of Social Studies (ISS) awarded its honorary fellowship to Hans Singer in 1977. Singer was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1994. In 2001 the UN World Food Programme awarded him the Food for Life award in recognition of his contribution to the battle against world hunger. In November 2004, Singer was awarded the first Lifetime Achievement Award from the Development Studies Association. 

Singer died in Brighton on 26 February 2006.

==Legacy==
In commemoration and in honour of Sir Hans Singer the German Development Institute and the Institute of Development Studies initiated the Hans Singer Memorial Lecture on Global Development, which alternates between Bonn and Brighton on an annual basis. The first memorial lecture was given by the renowned development economist Paul Collier of the University of Oxford in May 2009 in Bonn. The second lecture was held in October 2010 in Brighton with Jomo Kwame Sundaram, Assistant Secretary General of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). The third memorial lecture was given by Stephen Chan of the School of Oriental and African Studies at University of London in November 2011 at the German Development Institute in Bonn.

<text>Dines&#x27; compensation, or Dines compensation principle, is a rule of thumb devised by English meteorologist William Henry Dines which states that &quot;winds converging on a given column of air at one altitude tends to be balanced by winds diverging at another altitude&quot;, and vice versa. As an example, the air under a thunderstorm rushes in at ground level, rises up through the cumulonimbus cloud, and then disperses at the top of the cloud so there is a balancing of converging and diverging air flows and no net increase in air molecules above a given location.

Dines compensation is a demonstration of conservation of mass under the weak constraint that the height of the atmosphere is approximately the same anywhere on Earth.

Mathematically it may be stated that the sign of the horizontal divergence changes at least once in any given column of air.

A corollary is that rising air at any given point in the atmosphere tends to be balanced by sinking or subsiding air elsewhere. This is a salient feature of mesoscale atmospheric circulation (i.e. supercells) and in macroscale and mesoscale tropical circulations. For instance, it is not uncommon to see high altitude anticyclonic cirrus outflow from a hurricane in visible satellite imagery which is compensating for the inbound winds at sea level.

Dines compensation is useful in weather forecasting to connect the formation and movement of ground-level high and low pressure zones with wind phenomenon in the upper troposphere such as Rossby waves and jet streams. In general Dines compensation ties together vertical and horizontal air movements in the atmosphere.

<doc id="1287873" wikidata="Q3526896" url="?curid=1287873" title="Albert Trott">
<text>Albert Edwin Trott (6 February 1873 – 30 July 1914) was a Test cricketer for both Australia and England. He was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1899. He is believed to be the only batsman to have struck a ball over the top of the Lord&#x27;s Pavilion. He is also one of only two players to take two hat-tricks in the same first-class innings, the other being Joginder Rao. Despite his notability, having played in 375 first-class matches including 5 Tests, he was almost penniless when he killed himself at the age of 41.

==Birth==
Trott was born in Abbotsford, Melbourne, Australia. He was one of eight children of accountant Adolphus Trott and his wife Mary-Ann (née Stephens). His older brother, Harry Trott also played Test cricket for Australia. They played junior cricket with the local Capulet club and then played together for Victoria in Australia&#x27;s domestic first-class cricket competition, the Sheffield Shield.

==Cricket career in Australia==
Trott&#x27;s story represents one of the great enigmas of Australian cricket history. After just three first-class matches for Victoria, he burst onto the Test scene against AE Stoddart&#x27;s England team in the 3rd Test at Adelaide in 1894–95, with an amazing debut which included taking 8 for 43 with his slinging, round-arm bowling and scoring 38 and 72 with the bat, both not out, batting at number 10. Australia won the match by 382 runs. He followed this up in the 4th Test in Sydney, by scoring 85 not out in Australia&#x27;s only innings. Trott was not asked to bowl by captain George Giffen, with England being bowled out cheaply twice by Harry Trott, Charlie Turner and George Giffen. Australia won by an innings and 147 runs to tie the series 2–2. Trott played again in the 5th Test at Melbourne, which England won to win the Ashes, chasing down a target of 297 runs in the second innings with only four wickets down.

Albert&#x27;s brother, Harry Trott, was named captain of the Australian team which toured England in 1896. Despite Albert having averaged 102.5 with the bat in the Test series against England, he was not selected for the tour. Nonetheless, Trott sailed to England independently in 1896, on the same ship as the Australian touring side.

==Cricket career in England==
In England, Trott joined the ground staff at Lord&#x27;s with a view to qualifying by residence to play for Middlesex. He started to play for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1896, and with the help of the Australian cricketer and Test umpire Jim Phillips, he started to play for Middlesex in 1898. Despite missing a month due to an injured hand, he took 102 wickets in his first season, forming a formidable bowling partnership with J. T. Hearne.

Between December 1898 and April 1899, Trott took part in a tour of South Africa organised by Lord Hawke. He played in two matches against the South Africa national cricket team which were retrospectively awarded Test status and thus became one of only sixteen players to have played test cricket for two countries and the last cricketer to have played for both England and Australia.

He was at the peak of his powers as an all-rounder in 1899 and 1900. In 1899 he scored 1,175 first-class runs and took 239 wickets, and in 1900 he scored at 1,337 runs and took 211 wickets. Trott&#x27;s penchant for the spectacular did not fail him: having already landed the ball on the pavilion balcony at Lord&#x27;s in the match, he became the only batsman to hit a ball over the current Lord&#x27;s pavilion, bludgeoning Monty Noble out of the ground on 31 July 1899. The ball hit a chimney and fell into the garden outside the house of Philip Need, the Lord&#x27;s dressing room attendant. At the time, Trott had been playing for the MCC and Ground against the Australians; the MCC team also included WG Grace and KS Ranjitsinhji. Noble soon had his revenge when Trott was dismissed shortly afterwards, caught off a top edge at third man. Only two months earlier, playing for Middlesex against Sussex, Trott had hit a lofted drive from Fred Tate into the ironwork at the top of one of the pavilion towers. He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1899. He took all ten wickets in an innings (10 for 42) bowling for Middlesex against Somerset at Taunton in 1900. 

Trott was widely acknowledged as the finest all-round cricketer of his day. A true student of the game, Trott&#x27;s bowling relied less on pace than it did on guile and spin; his variations ensured that a batsman rarely faced the same ball twice in an over. Trott was a dynamo in the field, with the ball seldom escaping his commodious clutch. He regularly turned matches for Middlesex with his powerful hitting, using a bat, at least half a pound heavier than was then usual.

However, from 1901 or 1902, Trott declined abruptly. His weight increased rapidly and he lost mobility, so he could not bowl the very fast ball that was so deadly in his early years. His haul of wickets fell rapidly: from 176 in 1901 to 133 in 1902 and 105 in 1903. By 1905, he was extremely expensive and ineffective (taking only 62 wickets), and only in the very dry summer of 1906 did his batting reach the levels of his early years with Middlesex.

Trott&#x27;s ability to entertain never left him. His popularity rose as he enjoyed regular ales with spectators on the boundary while fielding. In his benefit match in 1907, he took four wickets in four balls, and then followed up with a second hat trick later in the innings. The feat of two hat-tricks in an innings has been repeated only once in first-class cricket, by Joginder Rao). However, the early end to the match meant that it did not raise as much money for him as it might have done, and he is said to have remarked that he had &quot;bowled himself into the poorhouse&quot;.

==Death==
After retiring from cricket, Trott suffered a lengthy illness. He had a heart condition complicated by nephralgia.

In 1914, he wrote his will on the back of a laundry ticket, leaving his wardrobe and £4 to his landlady. Shortly afterwards, one day before the 15th anniversary of his famous strike over the pavilion at Lord&#x27;s, he shot himself in Willesden Green, Middlesex.

He was buried at Willesden New Cemetery in plot 613P at the expense of Middlesex County Cricket Club. A headstone was erected in 1994.

Speculation that the South African-born English cricketer Jonathan Trott might be a distant relation of Albert and Harry Trott appears to be ill-founded. Jonathan&#x27;s family originates in Woodbridge, Suffolk, whereas Harry and Albert&#x27;s family originates in Yorkshire.

<doc id="1287878" wikidata="Q3225272" url="?curid=1287878" title="The Pas (electoral district)">
<text>The Pas was a provincial electoral division in north-central Manitoba, Canada. It was created in 1912 following the expansion of the province&#x27;s northern border, and existed until its dissolution in 2018. It was named for the rural town of The Pas.

Until the 1960s, elections in The Pas were deferred until a few weeks after the rest of the province for logistical reasons. It was not unheard of for politicians from the south of the province to run in The Pas after being chosen as cabinet ministers by newly elected provincial governments; Edward Brown and John Bracken were both elected in this manner.

Located in the north of the province, The Pas was bordered by the riding of Rupertsland to the east and south, Thompson and Flin Flon to the north, Swan River and Lake Winnipeg to the south, and the province of Saskatchewan to the west. In addition to the Town of The Pas, it also included Easterville and Norway House.

The Pas was represented by candidates of the New Democratic Party from 1969 onward (and for all but 11 years since 1943), and for much of that time was considered safe for the party. Its last three MLAs—Oscar Lathlin, Frank Whitehead, and Oscar&#x27;s daughter Amanda Lathlin—were all Indigenous. Whitehead had previously won a by-election on March 24, 2009, following Oscar Lathlin&#x27;s death. He held it until his resignation in 2014, and Amanda Lathlin won the ensuing by-election.

Following the 2018 redistribution, the riding was abolished, and its area was re-distributed into The Pas-Kameesak, Flin Flon and Keewatinook ridings. Amanda Lathlin transferred to The Pas-Kameesak.

== Demographics ==
The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 19,449. In 1999, the average family income was $42,878, and the unemployment rate was 17.80%. Health and social services account for 14% of the riding&#x27;s economy, with retail trade accounting for another 14%.

Sixty-seven per cent of the riding&#x27;s residents are aboriginal, the second-highest rate in the province.

<text>The Kangaroo Route is a term coined by Qantas, referring to the commercial passenger air routes flown between Australia and the United Kingdom via the Eastern Hemisphere.

The route has been operated since 1934, but found its name in 1944 from the unique mode of travel of the kangaroo, as the route&#x27;s &quot;hops&quot; were reminiscent of a kangaroo&#x27;s, and both are used to cover long distances. The term is trademarked and traditionally used by Qantas, although it is often used in the media and by airline competitors to describe all Australia to United Kingdom flights.

In addition to Qantas, by 2003, over 20 airlines operated routes connecting Australia and the UK, including British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Emirates, Etihad, Malaysia Airlines, Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways and Turkish Airlines with most involving a single transfer between flights at their respective hubs. Only British Airways and Qantas offer through direct flights (not requiring passengers to change plane en route), both making a fuel stop at Singapore Changi Airport as of 2024.

Qantas commenced operating non-stop flights from Perth to London with Boeing 787s on 25 March 2018. This ended the era of the continents of Europe and Oceania not being connected by non-stop flights, marking the first time that all of the world&#x27;s continents, excluding Antarctica, are connected by non-stop flights.

== Origins of the name ==

Qantas operated the Australian part of the Kangaroo Route for nine years before coining (and later trademarking) the name.

After starting airmail operations between Brisbane and Singapore in 1934, Qantas began operating passenger flights connecting Brisbane to Singapore in 1935 following successful awarding of the Australian government&#x27;s tender.

After disruption to the route due to the emerging hostilities of World War II, the connectivity was famously restored by Qantas with its &quot;Double Sunrise&quot; service connectivity between Perth and Ceylon on the Indian Ocean Route with Catalina flying boats in 1943. With the addition of the land based Liberator aircraft to the route in 1944, the &quot;Indian Ocean Route&quot; was officially renamed &quot;The Kangaroo Service&quot; by Qantas&#x27; Managing Director Hudson Fysh and pilot Bill Crowther; a play on words of the aviation term &quot;hop&quot; (referring to a leg of a route), and the hop of a kangaroo, an Australian icon.

Along with the newly created Qantas logo of the flying kangaroo, the terms &quot;Kangaroo Service&quot; and &quot;Kangaroo Route&quot; were trademarked by Qantas and became the airline&#x27;s branded term to describe Qantas&#x27; Australia-United Kingdom connectivity.

A significant milestone in 1947 when Qantas began operating the entire Kangaroo Route independently.  This April 1947 inauguration is referred to as the birth date of the Kangaroo Route by Qantas, even though it had been operating a part of that route for almost a decade.

== History ==

=== Early years (1935–1940) ===
In 1935 Qantas started flying passengers to Singapore in a De Havilland 86 to connect with London-bound Imperial Airways. London to Brisbane service commenced on 13 April 1935. Imperial Airways and Qantas Empire Airways opened the London to Brisbane route for passengers for a single fare £195 (). There were no through bookings on the first service because of heavy sector bookings, but there were two through passengers on the next flight that left London on 20 April. The route opened for passengers from Brisbane to London on 17 April; flights were weekly and the journey time was 12 days.

Eastbound passengers from London would first fly from Croydon to Paris, take an overnight train to Brindisi, and fly onward with stops at Athens, Alexandria (overnight), Gaza, Baghdad (overnight), Basra, Kuwait, Bahrain, Sharjah (overnight), Gwadar, Karachi, Jodhpur (overnight), Delhi, Cawnpore, Allahabad, Calcutta (overnight), Akyab, Rangoon, Bangkok (overnight), Alor Star, Singapore (overnight), Batavia, Sourabaya, Rambang (overnight), Koepang, Darwin (overnight), Longreach (overnight), and Charleville. London-Karachi was operated by Imperial Airways, Karachi-Singapore jointly by Imperial and Indian Trans-Continental Airways, and Singapore-Brisbane by Qantas.

=== Wartime modified operations (1940–1946) ===

==== Impediment and interruption due to WWII (June 1940 – Feb 1942) ====
On 11 June 1940 Italy entered WWII and the Kangaroo Route connection across the Mediterranean Sea from Egypt was severed with the resulting loss of all access to commercial air routes. While direct passenger air connectivity was lost, previous contingency plans were put into action, utilising the structure of the &quot;Horseshoe Route&quot; that connected Australia and England for passengers and airmail via Durban, South Africa where passengers would connect to steamboat service. This service was swiftly started just 8 days later with the first flight leaving Australia on 19 June 1940 and continuing its operation, modifying as necessary until its final reserve route (&quot;Reserve Route 3&quot;) via Broome was lost on 15 February 1942 with the fall of Singapore.

Plans for restoration of the connectivity were started in early 1943, resulting in the ideation, equipping, and successful testing of what would become the Double Sunrise service. Earlier in 1939 an alternative route via the Indian Ocean was proposed and designed by the Australian Government for potential use in case of emergency. The designed route was Port Hedland - Batavia - Christmas Island - Cocos Island - Diego Garcia - The Seychelles - Mombasa. This route was surveyed and tested in June 1939 but would ultimately not be used, in part as Batavia had already fallen in March 1942 in the Battle of Java (1942).

==== Innovation and resumption via &quot;The Double Sunrise&quot; (July 1943 – July 1945) ====
On 29 July 1943 Qantas resumed the kangaroo route&#x27;s modified operation, using a fleet of 5 Consolidated PBY Catalina aircraft to cross the Indian ocean nonstop. The planned route was for flights between Crawley, Western Australia, and RAF Base Koggala in southern Ceylon. Designed to exploit the Catalina&#x27;s extreme flight range, the flights became the longest non-stop commercial air route, covering over 3,500 nautical miles (6,500 kilometres; 4,000 miles) across the Indian Ocean. Navigated without the aid of radio, the crews relied solely on rudimentary navigation by compass and stars during the trip. Taking between 27 and 33 hours, with departure timed so that the flight crossed Japanese occupied territory during darkness, the crew and passengers would observe the sunrise twice, which led to the service being known as &quot;The Double Sunrise&quot;. The Double Sunrise flights remain the longest (in terms of airtime) commercial flights in history.

Initially, passengers and mail were then transferred via ground transport from Galle to Karachi connecting with BOAC service onwards to London. In November 1943, this was replaced by adding an additional hop to the kangaroo route operated by the Qantas Catalinas up the Indian coast to Karangi Creek in Karachi.

In June 1944, Qantas augmented the Kangaroo Route&#x27;s Catalina service with an additional route operated by converted Consolidated Liberator bombers. The Liberators flew from Perth to Learmonth before flying a shorter 3,077 mi (4,952 km) over-water route to an airfield northeast of Colombo, but they could make the journey in 17 hours with 5,500 pounds (2,500 kg) of payload, whereas the Catalinas usually required at least 27 hours and their payload was limited to only 1,000 pounds (450 kg). This route was named &quot;&#x27;The Kangaroo Service&quot;&#x27; and was the genesis for the Kangaroo Route&#x27;s naming. It also marked the first time that Qantas&#x27;s now-famous Kangaroo logo was used; passengers received a certificate proclaiming them as members of &quot;The Order of the Longest Hop&quot;.

In June 1945, Avro Lancastrians were introduced on the England–Australia service, and the Liberators and Catalinas were soon shifted to other Qantas routes. The Catalina operated Double Sunrise service ended on 18 July 1945.

===== Route normalization - Western legs (May 1945) =====
On 30 May 1945, following the end of the war in the European Theatre, Lancastrian operated flights by BOAC resumed from Hurn Airport in southern England, connecting in Karachi to Qantas&#x27; operated service which flew via Karachi - Minneriya (Ceylon) - Learmonth to Sydney. Covering the Kangaroo Route in a scheduled time of 70 hours.

===== Route normalization - Eastern legs (April 1946) =====
On 7 April 1946 - Qantas ended its Indian Ocean Service, and reverted the Kangaroo Route back via Darwin and Singapore. For the first time flying directly from Sydney to Darwin to Singapore, eliminating all previous domestic Australian stops. BOAC and Qantas service combined to operate the Kangaroo Route from Sydney to London time in a new record of 63 hours.

===Multiple stops (1947–1974)===

In 1947, Qantas took over complete operation of the route from Australia to The United Kingdom utilizing their new Lockheed Constellations. BOAC would continue to run its own service in parallel. Qantas first flew the Kangaroo Route on 1 December 1947. A Lockheed Constellation carried 29 passengers and 11 crew from Sydney to London with stops in Darwin, Singapore, Calcutta, Karachi, Cairo, and Tripoli (passengers stayed overnight in Singapore and Cairo). A return fare was £585 (), equivalent to 130 weeks average pay.

In the 1950s and 1960s some Qantas Kangaroo Routes featured other stops, including Frankfurt, Zürich, Rome, Athens, Beirut, Tehran, Bombay, and Colombo. In May 1958 the Kangaroo Route had 11 westward flights a week: four Qantas Super Constellations, four BOAC Britannias, and one Air India Super Constellation from Sydney to London, one KLM Super Constellation Sydney to Amsterdam, and one TAI Douglas DC-6B Auckland to Paris. In February 1959 Qantas&#x27; fastest Super Constellation took 63 hr 45 min Sydney to Heathrow and BOAC&#x27;s Britannia took 49 hr 25 min. Jet flights (Qantas with Boeing 707) started in 1959; in April 1960 the fastest trip from Sydney to London was 34 hr 30 min with eight stops.

In the late 1950s, Qantas had a round-the-world network, flying Australia to Europe westward on the Kangaroo Route and eastward on the Southern Cross Route (via the Pacific Ocean). In 1964 Qantas started a third route to London via Tahiti, Mexico, and the Caribbean, called the Fiesta Route. Qantas dropped its Southern Cross Route and Fiesta Route in 1975. By 1969, Qantas had 11 Kangaroo Route flights a week from Sydney to London, taking 29–32 hours with 5–6 stops each; BOAC&#x27;s 7-9 weekly flights previously had 7 stops.

In 1971 Qantas added Boeing 747s, reducing the travel time and number of stops (in the late 1970s flights typically stopped at Singapore and Bahrain). Fares fell, opening air travel to more people with more competition.

=== One-stop flights (1974–2018) ===

In April 1974 Qantas commenced operating a one stop service from Perth to London with only one stop in Bombay with Boeing 707s.

In 1989 Qantas set a world distance record for commercial jets when a Boeing 747-400, the &quot;City of Canberra&quot; (VH-OJA), flew non-stop from London to Sydney in just over 20 hours (with special fuel and without passengers or cargo). This was the only nonstop flight ever made between both cities for the next 3 decades.

Starting in January 2009, Qantas began utilising its new A380 aircraft on the Kangaroo Route, raising its capacity to 450 passengers per flight.

As part of a partnership approved in 2013 with Emirates, Qantas announced that its services to London would stop in Dubai rather than Singapore, beginning that same year. Qantas also announced that its services to Frankfurt via Singapore would be discontinued in April 2013, leaving London as its only European destination.

In 2017, Qantas announced a renewal of this partnership for another 5 years with the modification of the Qantas&#x27; Kangaroo Route reverting to operating with a stopover in Singapore instead of Dubai from 25 March 2018.

===Non-stop flights (2018– )===
Non-stop flights from Perth to London commenced in March 2018 with Boeing 787s, with the Kangaroo route becoming a non-stop route for the first time, while also connecting Australia and Europe via a non-stop route for the first time. These flights operate out of Perth&#x27;s Terminal 3 rather than the traditional T1 in order to facilitate seamless transfers from Qantas domestic flights. The route also opens up the possibility of further direct flights to Europe from Perth such as Rome (launched June 2022) and Paris (launched July 2024).

In late March 2020, prior to Qantas cutting all international services due to the COVID-19 pandemic, several repatriation flights were operated with a routing of Sydney-Darwin-London. The Singaporean government had banned transit passengers and airspace in the Middle East was closed, due to the pandemic. This was the first time an Airbus A380 flew nonstop between Australia and Europe.

In November 2021, Qantas resumed non-stop Kangaroo Route flights, this time from Darwin to London before resuming the non-stop route between Perth and London in May 2022 following the reopening of Western Australia for international travel.

== Qantas&#x27; evolution of the Kangaroo Route ==
Since its founding in 1935, Qantas has evolved the Kangaroo Route over time in terms of &quot;hops&quot; (routings), duration, and aircraft used. Illustrated in the below table are snapshots of that ongoing evolution over the years.

&quot;Note: &quot;

==Competing one-stop flights==
While &quot;The Kangaroo Route™ &quot; is a trademarked term belonging to Qantas, it is often genericized by the media, other operators, and even Qantas themselves to refer to all flights between Australia and the United Kingdom.

Today Qantas remains the sole operator of &quot;The Kangaroo Route&quot; as well as the only nonstop flight between Australia and the United Kingdom. British Airways continues to operate its legacy route it has served since 1935 when it was Imperial Airways, offering the only other direct flight from Australia to the United Kingdom.

Forming a competitive market, there are over 20 airlines operating competing one-stop flights from Australia to the United Kingdom via the Eastern Hemisphere as seen in the table below:

==Project Sunrise==
On 25 August 2017, Qantas announced Project Sunrise, aiming to fly non-stop from the East Coast of Australia (Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane) to London, Paris, Cape Town, Rio de Janeiro and New York City by 2022, and challenged Boeing and Airbus to create aircraft that can travel to such places without stopping. Both Boeing and Airbus submitted proposals in 2019. Boeing announced some delays in the 777-8X project in August 2019 after Etihad Airways dropped orders made in 2013, but the company made it clear that it remained in contention for Project Sunrise.

On 18–20 October 2019, Qantas made a 19-hour test flight QF7879 with a Boeing 787-9 from New York to Sydney. The next month, Qantas operated its first 19-20 hour test flight from London to Sydney using again a Boeing 787-9. Two months later, on 13 December 2019, Qantas announced that their preferred aircraft for the project was the Airbus A350-1000. The aircraft will have an additional fuel tank and slightly increased MTOW to deliver the performance required on the Project Sunrise routes. Qantas stated they were working with Airbus to order up to 12 aircraft, with the final decision expected within 2020.

On 2 May 2022, after the project was put on hold for two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Qantas placed a formal order for 12 Airbus A350-1000 aircraft for Project Sunrise flights to commence in &quot;late 2025&quot; between its first two routes: Sydney to London, and Sydney to New York. The 238 seats will be split into 6 first class suites (three-abreast), 52 business class suites (four-abreast), 40 premium economy seats at 40″ pitch (eight-abreast) and 140 economy class seats at 33″ pitch (nine-abreast).
Qantas expects these ultra-long-haul flights to drive an annual earnings increase of A$400 million ($261 million) in the first full year with all 12 aircraft in service.

In February 2024, Qantas announced that due to manufacturing delays (which were blamed on a regulator-required fuel tank redesign), delivery of the A350-1000 aircraft would be delayed by six months, thus delaying the launch of the first project Sunrise flights until mid-2026.
The third centre fuel tank was certified by June 2024; deliveries were then expected from the third quarter of 2026.

Throughout the summer of 2024, Qantas announced more details regarding its development of Project Sunrise. News publications revealed features such as &quot;Wellness Zone&quot; that would be available for passengers onboard as a &quot;stretch and movement space&quot; in order to mitigate jetlag. Additionally, &quot;fast and free&quot; Wi-Fi onboard was promised.

==In literature==

The book &quot;Beyond the Blue Horizon&quot; by travel correspondent Alexander Frater documents the author&#x27;s attempt to fly all the sectors on the original 1935 Imperial/Qantas London-Brisbane route in 1984.

<text>The Malagasy rodents are the sole members of the subfamily Nesomyinae. These animals are the only native rodents of Madagascar, come in many shapes and sizes, and occupy a wide variety of ecological niches. There are nesomyines that resemble gerbils, rats, mice, voles, and even rabbits. There are arboreal, terrestrial, and semi-fossorial varieties.

These rodents are clearly most closely related to some muroid rodents found on the African mainland. Some molecular phylogeneticists consider this clade of Malagasy and African rodents to represent a distinct family, the Nesomyidae. Other researchers place the Nesomyinae into a large family, Muridae, along with all members of the superfamily Muroidea.

It has been reported that the Nesomyinae is not monophyletic, but this has not been supported in other analyses. Additionally, there were problems with this particular study, notably the use of &quot;Calomyscus&quot; as an outgroup while more distantly related muroids (rhyzomyines) were included in the ingroup. It seems likely that all rodents in Madagascar are descendants from a single invasion of the island.

If monophyletic, the nesomyines represent one of only four colonization events of terrestrial mammals from mainland Africa. The other groups are tenrecs, lemurs and Malagasy carnivorans. Molecular clock analyses suggest that the ancestor of the nesomyines colonized Madagascar about 20-25 million years ago. This is at approximately the same time as the Malagasy carnivorans, but is considerably more recent than the estimated colonization times of tenrecs and lemurs.

Nesomyinae contains 9 genera and 27 species.

<doc id="1287892" wikidata="Q1627891" url="?curid=1287892" title="Paulding-class destroyer">
<text>The &quot;Paulding&quot;-class destroyers were a series of United States Navy destroyers derived from the with the torpedo tubes increased from three to six via twin mounts. They were the first destroyers in the US Navy with oil-fired boilers. The 21 &quot;Paulding&quot;s doubled the number of destroyers in the US Navy. The &quot;Paulding&quot; class derived its name from the class&#x27;s lead ship, , named for Rear Admiral Hiram Paulding (1797–1878). Like the &quot;Smith&quot;s, they were nicknamed &quot;flivvers&quot; after the small and shaky Model T Ford once the larger &quot;thousand tonner&quot; destroyers entered service.

==Authorisation==
The Act of 13 May 1908 made provision for &quot;...Ten torpedo-boat destroyers, to have the highest practicable speed, and to cost, exclusive of armament, not to exceed eight hundred thousand dollars each, to be built by contract, not more than three by any one contractor...&quot; The Act of 3 March 1909 made provision for &quot;...Five torpedo-boat destroyers, to have the highest practicable speed, and to cost, exclusive of armament, not to exceed eight hundred thousand dollars each...&quot; The Act of 24 June 1910 made provision for &quot;...Six torpedo-boat destroyers, to have the highest practicable speed, and to cost in all not to exceed seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars each, and toward the construction of said torpedo-boat destroyers the sum of two million two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars is hereby appropriated...&quot;

Generally 21 ships, hull numbers 22 through 42, are considered &quot;Paulding&quot;s. However, some references list hull numbers 32 through 42 as the Monaghan&quot; class. Others break out hulls 24–28, 30, 31, 33 and 36 as Roe&quot; class, with hulls 32, 35, and 38–42 as &quot;Monaghan&quot; class. Curiously, &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships of World War I&quot; refers to hulls 22–42 as the 21 [ships of the] &quot;Drayton&quot; class, going on to say &quot;Unofficially known as &#x27;Flivver Type&#x27;&quot;; the book includes &quot;Paulding&quot; in the class listing, but not as the class leader.

==Design==

===Armament===

The torpedo armament was six 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes in three twin mounts. This was an easy upgrade from the three single tubes with reloads of the &quot;Smith&quot; class, as the new design twin mounts actually weighed less than the older single mounts. The gun armament was the same as the &quot;Smith&quot; class, with five /50 caliber guns. During World War I, one or two depth charge tracks were equipped for the convoy escort mission.

===Engineering===

There was some variation in engineering among the ships of this class. The most visible was that hulls 24–27, 30–32, 34, 36, 37, 39, and 40 had three stacks instead of four, with the middle stack being larger as two boiler uptakes were trunked together in it. Most of the ships&#x27; direct drive turbines were arranged as in the &quot;Smith&quot; class on three shafts, with a high-pressure center turbine exhausting to two low-pressure turbines on the outboard shafts. Cruising turbines were also fitted on the outboard shafts in these ships to improve fuel economy at low speeds. However, hulls 26–27, 30–31, and 34 had two turbines on two shafts (Zoelly or Curtis), with cruising stages included in the turbine casings.

This was the first USN destroyer class with oil-fired boilers. Compared with the &quot;Smith&quot; class, the &quot;Paulding&quot;s had instead of , making them about a knot faster. From DD-32 on, most references state that Thornycroft boilers instead of Normand were equipped. However, the Navy&#x27;s official &quot;Ships&#x27; Data Book&quot; for 1911 shows that other types of boilers were used as well, including Yarrow and White-Forster.

&quot;Paulding&quot; made on trials at . Normal fuel oil capacity was 241 tons with a design range of at .

==Service==

The &quot;Paulding&quot;s were commissioned in 1910–1912 and were active throughout World War I, primarily as convoy escorts in the Atlantic. They were equipped with one or two depth charge tracks for this mission. All served in the United States Navy; twelve were transferred to the United States Coast Guard 1924–30 for the Rum Patrol; and all were scrapped 1934–35 to comply with the London Naval Treaty.

<doc id="1287893" wikidata="Q5142565" url="?curid=1287893" title="Coldstream railway station, Melbourne">
<text>Coldstream is a closed railway station, located in Station Street, Coldstream, Victoria, Australia, on the now-closed Healesville greater-metropolitan line.

== History ==

The station buildings were destroyed by fire in the late 1990s. The track from Coldstream to Yarra Glen was formerly leased by the Yarra Valley Tourist Railway, who discontinued their lease due to the poor condition of bridges along the line. An old platform in poor condition remains at the former station.

Until 1992, freight trains ran to Coldstream to service the fertilizer factory adjacent to the former station.

In 2019, The Daylesford Spa Country Railway removed the turnouts from Coldstream for use at Bullarto by the railway.

As of January 2020, Coldstream station has become part of the Yarra valley rail trail and the platform has been restored.

<doc id="1287894" wikidata="Q7744947" url="?curid=1287894" title="The Krankies">
<text>The Krankies are a British comedy duo who enjoyed success as a cabaret act in the 1970s and on television in the 1980s, featuring in their own television shows and making pop records. Since this period, they have also regularly appeared in pantomime. The duo comprises wife Janette Tough (née Anderson) and her husband Ian. As the Krankies they portray schoolboy Wee Jimmy Krankie (Janette), and paternal figure Ian Krankie (Ian), though in their comedy act they also portray other characters. Beginning in the 1990s, they regularly appeared as the Krankies in episodes of the BBC comedy series &quot;French and Saunders&quot;. Wee Jimmy Krankie often used the catchphrase exclamation &quot;&quot;

==Biographies==
Janette Anderson was born on 16 May 1947 in Queenzieburn, North Lanarkshire, Scotland, and Ian Tough on 26 March 1947 in Clydebank, Dunbartonshire. The two met in 1966, and were married in 1969.

==Career==
The Krankies began their career as a comedy duo performing as various characters and working the comedy circuit. In 1978, they got their big break when they were given a spot on the Royal Variety Performance.

===Television===
During the 1980s, the duo were given roles in several television shows, including the BBC&#x27;s stalwart children&#x27;s entertainment series &quot;Crackerjack&quot; (1980–1982). Other appearances included &quot;The Krankies Klub&quot; (1983–1984), &quot;The Joke Machine&quot; (1985), &quot;The Krankies Elektronik Komik&quot; (1985–1987) and &quot;K.T.V&quot; for Border Television (1989–1991).

===Music===
From 1975 to 1984, the Krankies released a series of pop singles and an album, &quot;Fan–Dabi–Dozi&quot;, based on their catchphrase, which peaked at number 46 in the UK Singles Chart in February 1981.

Janette also appeared as Jimmy Krankie in the video for the 2007 Comic Relief single &quot;500 Miles&quot; with The Proclaimers, Brian Potter, Andy Pipkin and other celebrity stars.

===Later career===
The pair made recurring appearances in various series of &quot;French &amp; Saunders&quot;. Janette played, for example, Anakin Skywalker in the &quot;Star Wars: The Phantom Menace&quot; parody &quot;The Phantom Millennium&quot;, and they both appeared in several other movie parodies throughout the series. Her most recent appearance was on the 2005 Christmas Special, in which she appeared in the mock theatre trailers for &quot;The Graduate&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot;. She also appeared in the fifth series of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; playing both a midwife and nightmare baby in the episode &quot;Book Clubbin.&quot;

In 1999, Janette Tough made a cameo appearance in a series 4 episode of &quot;Murder Most Horrid&quot; (&quot;Elvis, Jesus, and Zack&quot;). The episode concerns an artist who fakes his death to gain popularity. Janette is seen at the end of the episode, calling Dawn French&#x27;s character for help faking her own death. The same year, she appeared as Janice, a friend of the character Petula in an episode of &quot;dinnerladies&quot;.

In 2003, &quot;Wee Jimmy Krankie&quot; was voted &quot;The Most Scottish Person in the World&quot; by the readers of &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot;. The following year, Janette was badly injured in a fall during a performance in the pantomime &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;, but made a full recovery.

In 2008, the Krankies appeared in a widely seen advertising campaign for STV Bingo. In 2007, they appeared in the video for the Comic Relief remake of The Proclaimers&#x27; song &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be (500 Miles)&quot;, which featured Brian Potter and Andy Pipkin (fictional characters portrayed by Peter Kay and Matt Lucas respectively). On 12 June 2008 they appeared as guests on &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot;, where they appeared in character at the beginning, before coming on later in the show as themselves. They were promoting a forthcoming tour in which they performed with other &quot;semi-retired&quot; acts such as Frank Carson, Brotherhood of Man, and Jimmy Cricket (all best known in the 1970s and 1980s).

On 14 December 2009, they once again were on the Paul O&#x27;Grady show for the pantomime special of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, in which Janette played a hooker and Ian played a rampant camel. The duo appeared on ITV&#x27;s daytime show &quot;Loose Women&quot; on 25 February 2010.

During the 2010 panto season, the Krankies made a re-appearance in Scottish pantomime alongside John Barrowman at the SECC for Aladdin. They appeared as the Police, with Janette parodying Susan Boyle and Lady Gaga, and making an appearance as Wee Jimmy Krankie. The Krankies returned alongside Barrowman in 2011 and soon became SECC veterans. After four years, Barrowman announced he would not return, and David Hasselhoff joined the Krankies for the 2015 pantomime. In 2016, they joined Barrowman again in pantomime at Birmingham Hippodrome, and in 2017 at Manchester Opera House.

In December 2011, during an appearance on BBC Radio Scotland&#x27;s &quot;Stark Talk&quot; programme, Ian Tough revealed the couple had enjoyed a colourful sex life at the time when their profile was at its highest in the 1980s, admitting to episodes of swinging. He told the story of one amorous incident where the pair almost sailed off course to France in a small boat while partaking in a sex act.

In December 2015, &quot;Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie&quot; sparked controversy and accusations of racism when it was announced that Janette Tough would be playing a male Japanese character named Huki Muki. Korean American comedian Margaret Cho accused Janette Tough of &quot;yellowface&quot;, which she described as &quot;when white people portray Asian people. And unfortunately it&#x27;s happening in this film.&quot; Upon release of the film it became apparent that the character was not, in fact, Japanese but Scottish. When asked about the controversy Jennifer Saunders replied &quot;the whole film is about people being what they&#x27;re not, Huki Muki is a brand, she is the designer and she looks a bit Japanese, but the moment she opens her mouth she&#x27;s from Glasgow. There&#x27;s no yellow makeup...&quot;

On 24 December 2015, the Krankies appeared on the BBC One programme &quot;Pointless&quot;, losing out to Su Pollard and Jeffrey Holland who reached the final.

In August 2018, they appeared in the third series of BBC&#x27;s travel documentary &quot;The Real Marigold Hotel&quot;.

In 2019, they appeared on &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s Alien Fun Capsule&quot;.

On 8 April 2022 they appeared on GB News&#x27;s &quot;Mark Dolan Tonight&quot; on Dolan&#x27;s &quot;Mark Meets&quot; segment. They also appeared as panellists on Dolan&#x27;s show on 3 July 2022.

<doc id="1287904" wikidata="Q382782" url="?curid=1287904" title="Cornelius Newton Bliss">
<text>Cornelius Newton Bliss (January 26, 1833 – October 9, 1911) was an American merchant, politician and art collector, who served as Secretary of the Interior in the administration of President William McKinley and as Treasurer of the Republican National Convention in four successive campaigns.

==Early life==

Cornelius Bliss was born at Fall River, Massachusetts. He was the son of Asahel Newton and Irene Borden (née Luther) Bliss. His family was of English ancestry and their earliest American ancestor was Thomas Bliss, who emigrated from Belstone, Devonshire, to New England in 1635. His father died when he was an infant and his mother remarried to Edward S. Keep. They moved to New Orleans in 1840.

He was educated in his native city and in New Orleans, where he early entered his stepfather&#x27;s counting house.

==Career==
Returning to Massachusetts in 1849, he became a clerk and subsequently a junior partner in a prominent Boston commercial house. Later he moved to New York City to establish a branch of the firm. The firm, originally Wright &amp; Whitman, in 1874 became Wright, Bliss &amp; Fabyan upon the death of the senior partner, Mr. John S. Wright. On the death in 1881 of Mr. Eben Wright, the firm became Bliss, Fabyan &amp; Co., under which name it continued until well into the 20th century. Bliss, Fabyan &amp; Co. was one of the largest wholesale dry-goods houses in the country.

===Politics===
A consistent advocate of the protective tariff, he was one of the organizers and for many years president of the American Protective Tariff League. In politics an active Republican, he was chairman of the Republican state committee in 1887 and 1888, and contributed much to the success of the Harrison ticket in New York in the latter year. He was treasurer of the Republican National Committee from 1892 to 1904. He turned down the offer of becoming United States Secretary of the Treasury under President McKinley, but he served as United States Secretary of the Interior in President William McKinley&#x27;s cabinet from 1897 to 1899.

In 1900, he was invited to stand as President McKinley&#x27;s vice-president. He refused the offer. The following year McKinley was assassinated and Theodore Roosevelt (who did accept the offer) became president.

==Personal life==

On March 30, 1859, Bliss was married to Mary Elizabeth Plummer (1837–1923), the daughter of Hon. Avery Plummer of Boston. Together, they were the parents of four children, two who survived him:

* Nellie Bliss (b. 1861), who died young.
* Lizzie Plummer Bliss (1864–1931), one of the founders of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.
* George Bliss, who died young.
* Cornelius Newton Bliss Jr. (1875–1949), a prominent financier who married Zaidee Cobb (1881-1966).

He was also a member of the famous Jekyll Island Club (aka The Millionaires Club) on Jekyll Island, Georgia.

Bliss&#x27; health began to fail in 1910. He spent the summer of 1911 at his country home in Rumson, New Jersey, accompanied by his physician Arthur W. Bingham, but returned to New York City in September due to his frailty. He spent the last two weeks of his life at his residence at 29 East 37th Street before succumbing to heart disease at 7 pm on October 9, 1911. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx, New York.

===Legacy===
Cornelius Bliss was a collector of fine art. He owned works by Arthur Bowen Davies, along with Claude Monet&#x27;s &quot;The Manneporte near Étretat&quot;, now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

<text>Eugene the Jeep is a character in the &quot;Popeye&quot; comic strip. A mysterious animal with magical or supernatural abilities, the Jeep first appeared in the &quot;Thimble Theatre&quot; comic strip (March 16, 1936). He was also present in animated versions of Popeye&#x27;s adventures, including three of the Fleischer Studios shorts of the late 1930s/early 1940s, with more extensive appearances in later &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons produced for TV.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
In the August 9, 1936, strip, headlined &quot;Wha&#x27;s a Jeep?&quot; Popeye asks Professor Brainstine what exactly a Jeep is. He gets the following response:

When asked if he had any further questions, Popeye, totally unenlightened by this explanation, repeated, &quot;Wha&#x27;s a Jeep?&quot;

The animated cartoons took the straightforward approach of defining the character as some type of dog. In &quot;The Jeep&quot; (1938), Popeye presents the animal to Olive Oyl and Swee&#x27;Pea with the simple explanation, &quot;The Jeep&#x27;s a magical dog and can disappear and things&quot;. In &quot;Popeye Presents Eugene the Jeep&quot; (1940), it is Popeye who receives the creature from Olive, in a box via a special delivery man (voiced by Pinto Colvig), and with the premise that he had never seen the creature before: &quot;Well, blow me down! A baby puppy!&quot;

Eugene the Jeep appeared in several Popeye TV series, including &quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot; (1960-1963), &quot;The All-New Popeye Hour&quot; (1978-1983) and &quot;Popeye and Son&quot; (1987). In the latter two series he was voiced by Don Messick.

Eugene the Jeep did not appear in the live-action 1980 &quot;Popeye&quot; movie.
The Jeep was included in early drafts of the original screenplay but was soon deemed too difficult and too expensive to render believably, so the character was dropped and elements of the character were given to Swee&#x27;Pea. The baby&#x27;s mysterious ability to answer questions and make predictions through the use of whistles were scenes originally written for Eugene the Jeep.

Eugene was slated to appear in the animated Popeye film produced by Sony Pictures Animation but production of the film was cancelled in 2016.

===Attributes and abilities===
In the context of the comic strip, Eugene the Jeep was a gift to Popeye&#x27;s girlfriend Olive Oyl from her Uncle Ben who found Eugene in Africa. The Jeep is a yellow creature about the size of a dog who walks on his hind legs. He has a bear-like head and ears but a large nose, long tail, and protruding belly. The Jeep&#x27;s diet consists only of orchids.

As his language is limited to the word &quot;jeep&quot;, Eugene primarily communicates through body language. Eugene always tells the truth, even to criminals. He possesses high intelligence, so is able to help humans such as Popeye and Olive Oyl solve complex problems. He makes use of a limited form of teleportation: he can disappear from one place and reappear in another, and can walk through and on walls and ceilings. These teleportation powers are said to stem from the Jeep&#x27;s ability to cross into the fourth dimension.

==Other uses==
Eugene the Jeep is the school mascot for Northeast Dubois High School in Dubois, Indiana, and South Webster High School in South Webster, Ohio, although the Jeep for Northeast Dubois is blue and gray, while South Webster&#x27;s is red instead of yellow. An old elementary school in Wheatland, Indiana also used the Jeep as its mascot, but this school was consolidated, and the symbol is no longer in use.

Many suggest that soldiers of World War II were so impressed with the new Willys MB light utility vehicle that they informally named it after Eugene the Jeep, as it was &quot;small, able to move between dimensions and could solve seemingly impossible problems&quot;. Further suggestions say it comes from the initials of the Ford version called the &quot;Ford GPW&quot;.

<text>Thomas Cowan Bell (May 14, 1832 – February 3, 1919) was an American college president, educator, newspaper publisher, and Civil War veteran. He is best known for being one of the founders of Sigma Chi fraternity.

==Early life==

Thomas Cowan Bell was born May 14, 1832, in Bellbrook, Ohio. He grew up on a farm and his primary school education was in log schoolhouses.

He attended Miami University in the fall of 1854. Bell and six other students founded the Sigma Chi fraternity on June 25, 1855. At the age of 23, he was considered to be an &quot;elder statesman&quot; of the fraternity.

While a student at Miami, Bell lived in the Oxford, Ohio home of his Aunt Lizzie Davis. Because all of the other members of the fraternity at one time or another lived in Aunt Lizzie&#x27;s place or took meals there, her house became known as &quot;the first Chapter house of Sigma Chi.&quot; She eventually allowed all seven members to move into her house and hired two cooks from Cincinnati to accommodate the men.

At Miami University, Bell was also a member of the Eccritian literary society and was considered &quot;one of the principle orators of the university&quot;. He delivered the commencement speech when he graduated with an A.B. in 1857. He received an A.M. from Miami University in 1859.

With the start of the Civil War in 1861, Bell enlisted as a private in the 74th Ohio Infantry of the United States Army; he was a lieutenant colonel in less than a year. He received a high commendation for leading the regiment&#x27;s bayonet charge at the Battle of Stone River. He served in the military through 1863, retiring with the rank of major. 

== Career ==
After college, Bell became a teacher. Following the Civil War he returned to education, serving as the superintendent of school system in Nobles County, Minnesota, from 1872 to 1877. He was the County Record or Deeds and became the editor and publisher of the newspaper, &quot;Journal,&quot; in Worthington, Minnesota from 1878 to 1885.

From 1885 to 1886, he was the president of Philomath College in Oregon. Next, he was the principal of La Creole Academy in Dallas, Oregon from 1887 to 1892. He was president of Central Oregon State Normal School in Drain, Oregon from 1892 to 1896. He retired from teaching in 1896.

== Personal life ==
Bell was married to Sigourney White of Oxford in 1857. He married his second wife, Lucia Chase, in 1866. He had five boys and two girls between the two marriages. He was the Oregon adjunct for the Grand Army of the Republic. After he retired, Bell retired to Oakland, California.

Late in life, he renewed his connection to the Sigma Chi fraternity. Bell attended Sigma Chi&#x27;s semi-centennial celebration in Oxford, Ohio in 1905. He was also involved with the &quot;Alpha Beta chapter&quot; at the University of California at Berkeley. 

He died in his home in Oakland on February 3, 1919, the day after attending an initiation ceremony of the &quot;Alpha Beta chapter&quot;. He was 87 years old. He is buried at the San Francisco National Cemetery, located in the Presidio of San Francisco.

His son, Donald J. Bell, was initiated into Sigma Chi in June 1930.

== Honors ==

* In 1905, Sigma Chi presented Bell with a souvenir medal as an expression of its &quot;love and gratitude&quot; at the fraternity&#x27;s semi-centennial celebration.
* In 1933, Sigma Chi erected and dedicated a Founders&#x27; Memorial Monument in the San Francisco National Cemetery where Bell is buried.
* Bell is the namesake of the Thomas Cowan Bell Scholastic Foundation, located in San Jose, California, which awards college scholarships to both members of the Sigma Chi fraternity and students of San Jose State University
* Bell is the namesake of the Thomas Cowan Bell Sigma Chi Scholarship for both members and non-members of Sigma Chi at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.
* The Thomas Cowan Bell Teaching Award is presented annually by the &quot;Ohio State chapter&quot; of Sigma Chi.
* Sigma Chi chapters with the most active alumni donors are given the name of &quot;Bell Chapters&quot; in honor of Thomas Cowan Bell.

<text>Suphan Buri () is a town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) in central Thailand. It covers &quot;tambon&quot; Tha Philiang and parts of &quot;tambons&quot; Rua Yai and Tha Rahat, all within the Mueang Suphan Buri District. As of 2006 it had a population of 26,656. The town is 101 km north-northwest of Bangkok.

==Geography==
Suphan Buri lies on the Tha Chin River (known locally as the &quot;Suphan River&quot;), at an elevation of . The surrounding area is low-lying and flat, with rice farms covering much of the land.

==Climate==
Suphan Buri has a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;). Winters are quite dry and very warm. Temperatures rise until April, which is very hot with the average daily maximum at . The monsoon season runs from May through October, with heavy rain and somewhat cooler temperatures during the day, although nights remain warm.

==History==

19th-century Siamese historian and statesman Damrong Rajanubhab speculated that the city was founded under the name Suvarnapurī around 1350, around the time when nearby U Thong was plagued by an epidemic. U Thong was the capital of the Kingdom of Suphannaphum, one of the mueang of the Dvaravati period, in which Ramathibodi I had reigned before founding Ayutthaya, the capital of the homonymous kingdom in the same period. U Thong&#x27;s ancient name was Suphannaphum or Suvarnabhumi (literally: the origin or birthplace of gold), which was probably abandoned when the water shortage epidemic raged and Suvarnapurī was founded along the Tha Chin River. Ramathibodi appointed his brother-in-law Khunluang Pha Ngua as governor of Suvarnapurī, who gave the city its present name Suphanburi and who would become king of Ayutthaya in 1370 with the name Borommarachathirat I.

Later, Suphanburi remained a frontier town between Siam and the kingdoms that alternated in modern day Burma. Several battles were fought in its surroundings between the Siamese and Burmese armies until the first half of the 19th century. The most important was the one that took place on January 18, 1593 in Nong Sarai, a few kilometers northwest of the city. The battle was in progress, when the Siamese king Naresuan challenged the heir to the throne of the Toungoo dynasty to a duel on the back of elephants to decide the fate of the clash. Within minutes Naresuan killed his rival, the Burmese troops withdrew and Ayutthaya thus gained independence after 29 years of vassalage at Pegu&#x27;s court. The provincial coat of arms still remembers this duel.

The municipality took on its present form during the reign of Mongkut (1851-1868), when the central nucleus was unified with the neighboring settlements. Suphanburi underwent major changes in the years between the 20th and 21st centuries at the behest of Banharn Silpa-Archa, a wealthy entrepreneur native of the city who was prime minister of Thailand between 1995 and 1996. Banharn was accused of spending the 90% of the national budget for the Suphanburi Province. Among the various infrastructures he had built, many of which took the name Baharn-Jaemsai (Jaemsai is the name of his wife), there are seven schools, a 123-meter high tower in the city center, another tower where a clock and a series of pedestrian bridges that cross wide, almost deserted streets.

==Culture==
Suphan Buri is the place where &quot;Luk thung&quot; Superstar Pumpuang Duangjan was buried and is sometimes called the Thai Nashville, as it is an important center of the music industry.

==Transportation==
Suphan Buri is at the end of a branch line of the State Railway of Thailand&#x27;s southern line. The branch meets the main line at Nong Pla Duk Junction near Ban Pong.

Route 340 passes through Suphan Buri, leading north to Chai Nat and south to Bang Bua Phong. Route 321 leads west and then south to Nakhon Pathom. Route 329 leads east to Bang Pahan. Route 3195 leads northeast to Ang Thong.

<text>Eva Maria Charlotte Michelle Ibbotson (née Wiesner; 21 January 1925 – 20 October 2010) was an Austrian-born British novelist, known for her children&#x27;s literature. Some of her novels for adults have been reissued for the young adult market. The historical novel &quot;Journey to the River Sea&quot; (Macmillan, 2001) won her the Smarties Prize in category 9–11 years, garnered an unusual commendation as runner-up for the Guardian Prize, and made the Carnegie, Whitbread, and Blue Peter shortlists. She was a finalist for the 2010 Guardian Prize at the time of her death. Her last book, &quot;The Abominables&quot;, was among four finalists for the same award in 2012.

==Personal life==
Wiesner was born in Vienna in 1925 to non-practising Jewish parents. Her father, Bertold Paul Wiesner, was a physician who pioneered human infertility treatment. He is now believed to have used his own sperm to sire perhaps 600 of the children his clinic helped to be born. Her mother, Anna Wilhelmine Gmeyner, was a successful novelist and playwright, who had worked with Bertolt Brecht and written film scripts for Georg Pabst.

Wiesner&#x27;s parents separated in 1928 when she was two years old. What followed for Eva was, in her words, a &quot;very cosmopolitan, sophisticated and quite interesting, but also very unhappy childhood, always on some train and wishing to have a home,&quot; as she later recalled. Her father took up a university lectureship in Edinburgh, while her mother left Vienna for Paris in 1933 after her work was banned by Adolf Hitler, putting a sudden end to her successful writing career.

In 1934, her mother moved to England, settling in Belsize Park, north London, and sent for her daughter. Other family members also escaped from Vienna and joined Anna and Eva Maria in England, avoiding the worst of the Nazi regime, which had already affected the family. The experience of fleeing Vienna was a strong thread throughout Ibbotson&#x27;s life and work.

Wiesner attended Dartington Hall School, which she later fictionalised as Delderton Hall in her novel &quot;The Dragonfly Pool&quot; (2008). Originally, she intended to become a physiologist like her father, and earned an undergraduate degree from Bedford College, London, in 1945. During her postgraduate studies at Cambridge University, she met her future husband, Alan Ibbotson, an ecologist.

==Marriage and family==
Eva married Alan Ibbotson in 1947. They moved to Newcastle upon Tyne, where they raised a family of three sons and a daughter.

Appalled by the thought of having to make a career out of conducting experiments on animals, she decided to discontinue her pursuit of scientific research. She returned to college, graduating with a diploma in education in 1965 from the University of Durham. She briefly became a teacher in the 1960s before embarking on her writing career.

Ibbotson&#x27;s husband died in 1998. Being &quot;too sad to write in her usual humorous style&quot;, she then wrote her ecological classic &quot;Journey to the River Sea&quot;. She died at her home in Newcastle on 20 October 2010, having just edited the proofs of her last children&#x27;s book, &quot;One Dog and his Boy&quot;, and started work on another children&#x27;s ghost story to add to her long and successful series.

Through her father, Ibbotson was half-sister of the writer Paul Newham and the Canadian filmmaker Barry Stevens, but never met them.

==Career==
Eva Ibbotson began writing with the television drama &quot;Linda Came Today&quot;, which the British &quot;Television Playhouse&quot; series broadcast in December 1962. Her first English-language book was &quot;The Great Ghost Rescue&quot;, a juvenile fantasy novel published in 1975 by Macmillan in the UK and Walck in the US, with illustrations by Simon Stern and Giulio Maestro respectively.

===Children&#x27;s books===
Ibbotson wrote more than a dozen books for children, including &quot;Which Witch?&quot;, &quot;The Secret of Platform 13&quot;, &quot;Dial-a-Ghost&quot;, &quot;Monster Mission&quot;, &quot;Journey to the River Sea&quot;, &quot;The Star of Kazan&quot;, &quot;The Beasts of Clawstone Castle&quot;, and &quot;The Dragonfly Pool&quot;. She won the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize for &quot;Journey to the River Sea&quot;, and was a runner up for major awards in British children&#x27;s literature several times. WorldCat libraries report holding &quot;Which Witch?&quot; and &quot;Journey to the River Sea&quot; in more than five and ten languages respectively.

The books are imaginative and humorous, and most of them feature magical creatures and places. Ibbotson said that she disliked thinking about the supernatural, and created the characters because she wanted to decrease her readers&#x27; fear of such things. Some of the books, particularly &quot;Journey to the River Sea&quot;, also reflect Ibbotson&#x27;s love of nature. She wrote &quot;Journey&quot; in honour of her husband, a former naturalist who had just died; the book had been in her head for years. Ibbotson had said she disliked &quot;financial greed and a lust for power&quot;, and often created antagonists in her books who have these characteristics.

Her love of Austria is evident in works such as &quot;The Star of Kazan&quot;, &quot;A Song for Summer&quot; and &quot;Magic Flutes/The Reluctant Heiress&quot;. These books, set primarily in the Austrian countryside, display the author&#x27;s love of nature.

===Adult books===
Ibbotson was also noted for several works of fiction for adults. Several have been reissued successfully for the young adult market, some under different titles. Ibbotson was surprised by the repackaging, as she believed they were books for adults, but they have been very popular with teenage audiences. Three are &quot;The Secret Countess&quot; (originally published as &quot;A Countess Below Stairs&quot;), &quot;A Company of Swans&quot;, and &quot;Magic Flutes&quot; (in some editions published as &quot;The Reluctant Heiress&quot;)

Ibbotson&#x27;s writing for adults and teens took a new direction in 1992, when she began to move toward romantic novels that dealt with the harsh realities of war and prejudice. Two of her acclaimed books are set in Europe at the time of World War II and reflect her experience of the time. The first of this setting, &quot;The Morning Gift&quot; (1993), became a best-seller. Her last novel for adults was &quot;A Song for Summer&quot; (1997), also set during World War II.

==&quot;The Secret of Platform 13&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter&quot;==
Critics have found similarities between Ibbotson&#x27;s &quot;Platform 13&quot; in &quot;The Secret of Platform 13&quot; (1994) and J.K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Platform 9 3/4&quot; in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books (from 1997), both set in King&#x27;s Cross station in London. The journalist Amanda Craig has discussed the similarities: &quot;Ibbotson would seem to have at least as good a case for claiming plagiarism as the American author currently suing J. K. Rowling but unlike her, Ibbotson says she would &#x27;like to shake her (Rowling) by the hand. I think we all borrow from each other as writers.&#x27;&quot;

<text>Swan River is a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created in 1903, in what was then the northwestern corner of the province. Manitoba&#x27;s borders expanded significantly in 1912, and Swan River is now located in the centre of the province, close to its western border with Saskatchewan. The division has seen several redistributions.

The riding is bordered to the north by The Pas, to the south by Dauphin-Roblin, to the east by Lake Winnipeg and to the west by the province of Saskatchewan. Lake Winnipegosis runs through the riding.

The community of Swan River is located in the riding&#x27;s southwest corner. Other communities in the riding include Birch River, Ethelbert, Minitonas, Camperville and Winnipegosis.

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 19,639. In 1999, the average family income was $35,209, and the unemployment rate was 10.70%. Twenty-eight per cent of the riding&#x27;s residents are listed as low income, and over 25% of the population has less than a Grade Nine education (the third-highest rate in the province).

Thirty-six per cent of the riding&#x27;s residents are aboriginal, and 10% are Ukrainian. Agriculture accounts for 22% of Swan River&#x27;s economy, followed by the health and service sector at 12%.

Swan River&#x27;s political identity has undergone a significant change in recent years. It was represented by the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba continuously for all but one term from 1932 to 1988, and was generally regarded as safe for the party during this period. The current MLA is Rick Wowchuk, who was elected in 2016, returning the seat to the Tories for the first time since 1990.

<doc id="1287978" wikidata="Q314102" url="?curid=1287978" title="Stuart Taylor (footballer, born 1980)">
<text>Stuart James Taylor (born 28 November 1980) is an English former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. Taylor began his career with Arsenal, winning the 2001–02 Premier League and 2002–03 FA Cup and representing England at under-16, under-18, under-20 and under-21 level. He was spoken of as a future replacement for Arsenal and England goalkeeper David Seaman but after other goalkeepers were signed, he struggled to get playing time after 2003 and he joined Aston Villa in 2005.

Initially second-choice behind Thomas Sørensen, Taylor was again supplanted by other keepers and pushed down the pecking order. He left Aston Villa in 2009, having played only 12 league matches in four seasons. He then joined Manchester City, before spells at Reading, Leeds United and Southampton. Taylor spent most of his career as a third-choice goalkeeper, only making 95 career appearances. He currently runs his own goalkeeping academy.

==Club career==
===Arsenal===
Taylor was born in Romford, London. After a brief spell as a teenager with Wimbledon, Taylor joined Arsenal in 1997 as a youth player. He made his Arsenal debut in a League Cup game against Ipswich Town in November 2000. While at Arsenal he was loaned out to Bristol Rovers, Crystal Palace, Peterborough United and Leicester City. His league debut for Arsenal came in a 3–1 win against Manchester United in November 2001. He went on to make ten League appearances in Arsenal&#x27;s 2001–02 Premier League-winning season, thus qualifying him for a winners&#x27; medal. This feat was achieved in the final match against Everton, with the title already won. Richard Wright started the game with Taylor upon nine appearances. Manager Arsène Wenger substituted Wright in the 85th minute of play for Taylor who thus earned a medal with this cap.

During his time at Arsenal he was tipped to become David Seaman&#x27;s successor. However, although he saw off competition from Alex Manninger and Wright, the signings of Jens Lehmann and Manuel Almunia in 2003 and 2004 respectively saw him struggle for playing time. Taylor also missed the whole of the 2003–04 season due to a persistent shoulder problem. After the signing of Almunia, Taylor thus became the club&#x27;s third-choice goalkeeper and Wenger told Taylor that he would understand if he chose to leave. During his stay at Highbury Taylor won a league title, an FA Cup as well as two Charity Shields. Altogether he made 30 appearances in all competitions for Arsenal.

===Aston Villa===
In June 2005 Taylor moved to Aston Villa, signing on a four-year deal. He became Villa&#x27;s second-choice goalkeeper, behind Thomas Sørensen. Taylor recalls being told that he would play if Sørensen was injured or in poor form, but those chances &quot;never materialised. I kept being told I would play this game or that game, and I never did. You get your hopes up, and it&#x27;s hard to take. Football is a cruel game. People tell you what they think you want to hear.&quot; During the 2005–06 season he made just two appearances for the club. He saved Wayne Rooney&#x27;s penalty in a match against Manchester United on 20 October 2007 during a match in which first-choice goalkeeper Scott Carson was sent off. When Sørensen left, Villa signed Brad Friedel and Brad Guzan at the start of the 2008–09 season. Friedel became the first choice goalkeeper with Guzan second choice and Taylor slipping down to third. This despite generally putting in good performances, when called upon. Taylor&#x27;s final appearance for Villa was the game against Odense BK in the 2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup.

===Cardiff City (loan)===
In a bid to find first team football, Taylor began to search for a short-term loan deal at a Football League side, entering into talks with League One club Leeds United. However, on 13 March 2009, a last minute offer from Cardiff City prompted Taylor to instead opt for the Championship side on a one-month loan deal, becoming the third goalkeeper to sign on loan at the club during the season, after Tom Heaton and Dimitrios Konstantopoulos. He made his debut for the side two days later in a 1–1 draw with Bristol City.

Taylor continued as first choice for Cardiff throughout his first month at the club, despite the return of Tom Heaton from injury, and his loan deal was extended to the end of the season. However, following a 6–0 defeat to Preston North End, Taylor was dropped from the side for the final three games of the season. At the end of the campaign, he returned to Villa Park.

===Manchester City===
Taylor signed for Manchester City on a free transfer on 23 June 2009, following the expiration of his contract at Villa. He officially became a Manchester City player on 1 July 2009. Taylor admitted taking advice from Brad Friedel, who had previously worked with manager Mark Hughes and goalkeeping coach Kevin Hitchcock at Blackburn Rovers. On 18 July 2009, when Manchester City played the South African team Orlando Pirates, Taylor conceded his first two goals for the club. Signed as cover for Shay Given, Taylor was promised playing time in the FA Cup and League Cup, but this also failed to materialise. Taylor made his only first-team appearance for the club in an FA Cup 4th round tie against Scunthorpe United on 24 January 2010, which City won 4–2.

On 10 July, he signed a new two-year deal with the club, despite being officially released by City nine days earlier. Taylor also played against New York Red Bulls on 25 July 2010 in the second half in City&#x27;s U.S. Tour, and conceded one goal in a 2–1 defeat. After the return of Joe Hart from a loan spell, Taylor once again found himself third-choice goalkeeper. He fell further down the pecking order, with Costel Pantilimon starting in front of him in a League Cup tie against former club Arsenal on 29 November 2011, which City won 1–0. After winning the 2011–12 Premier League title as Manchester City&#x27;s third choice goalkeeper, he was released by City for a second time on 1 June 2012, alongside other goalkeeper Gunnar Nielsen.

===Reading===
Reading announced on 13 July 2012 that Taylor was training with them and would play a part in their first team friendly with AFC Wimbledon the next day. On 20 August 2012, Reading manager Brian McDermott announced that they had signed Taylor on a one-year contract. Injuries to both Adam Federici and Alex McCarthy saw Taylor make his Reading debut on 2 March in a 3–1 defeat to Everton in the Premier League. Taylor played against his former club Arsenal on 30 March 2013 in a 4–1 loss at the Emirates Stadium. Taylor signed a new one-year deal with Reading, keeping him at the club till June 2014, on 2 August 2013.

On 18 November 2013, Taylor joined fellow Championship side Yeovil Town on an initial one-month loan deal. Taylor&#x27;s loan with Yeovil was cut short without making a competitive appearance after just two days due to &quot;personal reasons&quot;.

Taylor&#x27;s spell at Reading found him as a backup goalkeeper to regular goalkeepers McCarthy and Federici. He left the club at the end of the 2013–14 season upon the expiry of his contract.

===Leeds United===
Taylor signed a one-year contract with Leeds United on 3 July 2014. Taylor revealed that he was hoping to challenge for the number 1 spot, after revealing that Leeds were also looking to sign another goalkeeper. On 8 July, Leeds signed a new number 1 goalkeeper in Marco Silvestri from Chievo Verona. On 1 August, Taylor was assigned the Leeds number 13 shirt for the 2014–15 season.

Taylor made his Leeds United debut on 12 August 2014, starting the League Cup match against Accrington Stanley. Taylor started for Leeds on 27 August in the 2–1 defeat against Bradford City in the League Cup.

Taylor made his league debut in the game against Charlton Athletic on 18 April 2015 in a 2–1 loss, with Taylor giving away a penalty.

On 13 May 2015, upon the expiry of his contract, Leeds announced that they would not be renewing Taylor&#x27;s contract at the club. Taylor, who had played only 9 games between 2012 and 2015, considered retirement: &quot;You go round thinking things will happen, that surely you will get games, and it becomes very demoralising. I was fed up.&quot; He turned down the chance to join clubs in League One and League Two as he felt that even if he played more matches, it would be an admission that he was not good enough to play in the Premier League: &quot;People will say I am wrong, but I wanted to play at the highest level I thought I could play at. I felt I was good enough to be in the Premier League.&quot;

===Southampton===
On 26 August 2016, after a year without a club, Taylor joined Southampton on a one-year contract. Taylor joined knowing he would be third-choice behind Fraser Forster and Alex McCarthy: &quot;nobody promised me anything. I know my role.&quot; On 13 July 2017, Southampton announced that Taylor&#x27;s contract had been extended for another year. On 30 June 2018, Taylor left Southampton after his contract expired, without having made a first-team appearance.

In an interview with the &quot;New York Times&quot; in December 2017, Taylor talked about his career and the frustrations he had at barely playing and becoming known for being a third-choice keeper: &quot;There is definitely a perception of me... [as a man who] loves going round clubs, earning money for doing nothing.&quot; He dismissed suggestions that he &quot;sits around doing nothing, turning up for training, having a jolly, messing about&quot; and had become wealthy after spending so long in the Premier League, saying that when his playing career ends &quot;I will have to work. People assume I have made serious money. I really haven&#x27;t.&quot; He said that &quot;every coach I have had, every goalkeeper I have worked with, has said I should have played 200 or 300 Premier League games. I look back at it and think the same.&quot;

==International career==
Taylor played for the England U20 team at the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship alongside Ashley Cole, Peter Crouch and Andrew Johnson. He was capped three times for the England U21 team.

<text>Chachoengsao (, ) is a town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) in central Thailand, capital of Chachoengsao Province. It is on the banks of the Bang Pakong River. It includes &quot;tambon&quot; Na Mueang and parts of Ban Mai, Bang Tin Pet, Wang Takhian, and Sothon of Mueang Chachoengsao District. In 2006, it had a population of 60,893.

The town was established in 1549 during the reign of King Maha Chakkrapat of Ayutthaya and originally was a centre for military recruitment. During the reign of King Maha Thammaracha, the kingdom was in a weak condition due to being defeated by the Burmese. Phraya Lawaek, the Khmer king, conscripted Thais from several towns including Chachoengsao to be in his work force.

Chachoengsao is sometimes referred to as &quot;Paet Riu&quot;, a name derived from large fish locally caught in the past. Paet Riu literally means &quot;eight cuts&quot; or slices which refers to the way the fish was cooked and served as a local dish in Chachoengsao.

The town is about 50 km east of Bangkok and can be accessed by train.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Chachoengsao&quot; (ฉะเชิงเทรา) is believed to be a corruption of Old Khmer &quot;cdiṅ&quot;, &quot;cdiṅṅ&quot;, &quot;chdiṅ&quot;, &quot;chdiṅṅ&quot; (“river&quot;; &quot;stream”), corresponding to Modern Khmer ស្ទឹង (&quot;stɨng&quot;) + Old Khmer &quot;jrau&quot;, &quot;jrov&quot; (“deep&quot;), corresponding to Modern Khmer ជ្រៅ (&quot;crɨw&quot;); literally &quot;deep river&quot;; after the Bang Pakong River.

==History==
Chachoengsao has a history dating back to the reign of King Borommatrailokkanat in the Ayutthaya Kingdom. Most people settled by the Bang Pakong River and along canals. &quot;Luangpho Phuttha Sothon&quot; is a centre of faith of the people of Paet Riu. In the past, Chachoengsao was a fourth class city under the ministry of defence. During the reign of King Rama I, it was attached to the ministry of the interior. Until the reign of King Rama V, who changed the administration system, Chachoengsao became a city. In 1916, its status was changed from a city to a province. &quot;Chachoengsao&quot; is a Khmer word which means &#x27;deep canal&#x27;.

==Geography==
The western part of the province is the low river plain of the Bang Pakong River, which is used extensively for farming rice. To the east is more hilly terrain, with an average elevation of more than 100 meter.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows the main hall of the Sothornvararamvoraviharn Temple. In this hall is the most important Buddha image of the province, called &quot;Luang Por Buddha Sothorn&quot;.

The provincial tree is &quot;Peltophorum dasyrachis&quot;. The tree was assigned to the province by Queen Sirikit on the 50th anniversary of the coronation of King Rama IX in 2000. The provincial flower is the yellow flamboyant (&quot;Peltophorum pterocarpum&quot;).

The provincial slogan is &quot;The bountiful Bang Pakong River, the sacred Buddha image of Luangpho Sothon, Phraya Si Sunthon the scholar of Thai language, and the Pristine Ang Rue Nai Forest&quot;.
