<text>A cheque (or check in American English; see spelling differences) is a document that orders a bank, building society (or credit union) to pay a specific amount of money from a person&#x27;s account to the person in whose name the cheque has been issued. The person writing the cheque, known as the &quot;drawer&quot;, has a transaction banking account (often called a current, cheque, chequing, checking, or share draft account) where the money is held. The drawer writes various details including the monetary amount, date, and a payee on the cheque, and signs it, ordering their bank, known as the &quot;drawee&quot;, to pay the amount of money stated to the payee.

Although forms of cheques have been in use since ancient times and at least since the 9th century, they became a highly popular non-cash method for making payments during the 20th century and usage of cheques peaked. By the second half of the 20th century, as cheque processing became automated, billions of cheques were issued annually; these volumes peaked in or around the early 1990s. Since then cheque usage has fallen, being replaced by electronic payment systems, such as debit cards and credit cards. In an increasing number of countries cheques have either become a marginal payment system or have been completely phased out.

==Nature of a cheque==
A cheque is a negotiable instrument instructing a financial institution to pay a specific amount of a specific currency from a specified transactional account held in the drawer&#x27;s name with that institution. Both the drawer and payee may be natural persons or legal entities. Cheques are &quot;order instruments&quot;, and are not in general payable simply to the bearer as bearer instruments are, but must be paid to the payee. In some countries, such as the US, the payee may endorse the cheque, allowing them to specify a third party to whom it should be paid.

Cheques are a type of bill of exchange that were developed as a way to make payments without the need to carry large amounts of money. Paper money evolved from promissory notes, another form of negotiable instrument similar to cheques in that they were originally a written order to pay the given amount to whoever had it in their possession (the &quot;bearer&quot;).

== Spelling and etymology ==
&quot;Check&quot; is the original spelling in the English language. The newer spelling, &quot;cheque&quot; (from the French), is believed to have come into use around 1828, when the switch was made by James William Gilbart in his &quot;Practical Treatise on Banking&quot;. The spellings &quot;check&quot;, &quot;checque&quot;, and &quot;cheque&quot; were used interchangeably from the 17th century until the 20th century. However, since the 19th century, in the Commonwealth and Ireland, the spelling &quot;cheque&quot; (from the French word &quot;chèque&quot;) has become standard for the financial instrument, while &quot;check&quot; is used only for other meanings, thus distinguishing the two definitions in writing.

In American English, the usual spelling for both is &quot;check&quot;.

Etymological dictionaries attribute the financial meaning of &quot;check&quot; to come from &quot;a check against forgery&quot;, with the use of &quot;check&quot; to mean &quot;control&quot; stemming from the &quot;check&quot; used in chess, a term which came into English through French, Latin, Arabic, and ultimately from the Persian word &quot;shah&quot;, or &quot;king&quot;.

== History ==

The cheque had its origins in the ancient banking system, in which bankers would issue orders at the request of their customers, to pay money to identified payees. Such an order was referred to as a &quot;bill of exchange&quot;. The use of bills of exchange facilitated trade by eliminating the need for merchants to carry large quantities of currency (for example, gold) to purchase goods and services.

=== Early years ===

There is early evidence of using bill of exchange. In India, during the Maurya Empire (from 321 to 185 BC), a commercial instrument called the adesha was in use, which was an order on a banker desiring him to pay the money of the note to a third person.

The ancient Romans are believed to have used an early form of cheque known as &quot;praescriptiones&quot; in the 1st century BC.

Beginning in the third century AD, banks in Persian territory began to issue letters of credit. These letters were termed &quot;čak&quot;, meaning &quot;document&quot; or &quot;contract&quot;. The &quot;čak&quot; became the &quot;sakk&quot; later used by traders in the Abbasid Caliphate and other Arab-ruled lands. Transporting a paper &quot;sakk&quot; was more secure than transporting money. In the ninth century, a merchant in one country could cash a &quot;sakk&quot; drawn on his bank in another country. The Persian poet, Ferdowsi, used the term &quot;cheque&quot; several times in his famous book, Shahnameh, when referring to the Sasanid dynasty.

Ibn Hawqal, living in the 10th century, records the use of a cheque written in Aoudaghost which was worth 42,000 dinars. 

In the 13th century the &quot;bill of exchange&quot; was developed in Venice as a legal device to allow international trade without the need to carry large amounts of gold and silver. Their use subsequently spread to other European countries.

In the early 1500s, to protect large accumulations of cash, people in the Dutch Republic began depositing their money with &quot;cashiers&quot;. These cashiers held the money for a fee. Competition drove cashiers to offer additional services including paying money to any person bearing a written order from a depositor to do so. They kept the note as proof of payment. This concept went on to spread to England and elsewhere.

=== Modern era ===

By the 17th century, bills of exchange were being used for domestic payments in England. Cheques, a type of bill of exchange, then began to evolve. Initially, they were called &quot;drawn notes&quot;, because they enabled a customer to draw on the funds that he or she had in the account with a bank and required immediate payment. These were handwritten, and one of the earliest known still to be in existence was drawn on Messrs Morris and Clayton, scriveners and bankers based in the City of London, and dated 16 February 1659.

In 1717, the Bank of England pioneered the first use of a pre-printed form. These forms were printed on &quot;cheque paper&quot; to prevent fraud, and customers had to attend in person and obtain a numbered form from the cashier. Once written, the cheque was brought back to the bank for settlement. The suppression of banknotes in eighteenth-century England further promoted the use of cheques.

Until about 1770, an informal exchange of cheques took place between London banks. Clerks of each bank visited all the other banks to exchange cheques while keeping a tally of balances between them until they settled with each other. Daily cheque clearing began around 1770 when the bank clerks met at the Five Bells, a tavern in Lombard Street in the City of London, to exchange all their cheques in one place and settle the balances in cash. This was the first bankers&#x27; clearing house.

Provincial clearinghouses were established in major cities throughout the UK to facilitate the clearing of cheques on banks in the same town. Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Hull, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Sheffield, and Southampton all had their own clearinghouses.

In America, the Bank of New York began issuing cheques after its establishment by Alexander Hamilton in 1784. The oldest surviving example of a complete American chequebook from the 1790s was discovered by a family in New Jersey. The documents are in some ways similar to modern-day cheques, with some data pre-printed on sheets of paper alongside blank spaces for where other information could be hand-written as needed.

It is thought that the Commercial Bank of Scotland was the first bank to personalize its customers&#x27; cheques, in 1811, by printing the name of the account holder vertically along the left-hand edge. In 1830 the Bank of England introduced books of 50, 100, and 200 forms and counterparts, bound or stitched. These &quot;cheque books&quot; became a common format for the distribution of cheques to bank customers.

In the late 19th century, several countries formalized laws regarding cheques. The UK passed the Bills of Exchange Act 1882, and India passed the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881; which both covered cheques.

In 1931, an attempt was made to simplify the international use of cheques by the Geneva Convention on the Unification of the Law Relating to Cheques. Many European and South American states, as well as Japan, joined the convention. However, countries including the US and members of the British Commonwealth did not participate and so it remained very difficult for cheques to be used across country borders.

In 1959 a standard for machine-readable characters (MICR) was agreed upon and patented in the US for use with cheques. This opened the way for the first automated reader/sorting machines for clearing cheques. As automation increased, the following years saw a dramatic change in the way in which cheques were handled and processed. Cheque volumes continued to grow; in the late 20th century, cheques were the most popular non-cash method for making payments, with billions of them processed each year. Most countries saw cheque volumes peak in the late 1980s or early 1990s, after which electronic payment methods became more popular and the use of cheques declined.

In 1969 cheque guarantee cards were introduced in several countries, allowing a retailer to confirm that a cheque would be honored when used at a point of sale. The drawer would sign the cheque in front of the retailer, who would compare the signature to the signature on the card and then write the cheque-guarantee-card number on the back of the cheque. Such cards were generally phased out and replaced by debit cards, starting in the mid-1990s.

From the mid-1990s, many countries enacted laws to allow for cheque truncation, in which a physical cheque is converted into electronic form for transmission to the paying bank or clearing-house. This eliminates the cumbersome physical presentation and saves time and processing costs.

In 2002, the Eurocheque system was phased out and replaced with domestic clearing systems. Old Eurocheques could still be used, but they were now processed by national clearing systems. At that time, several countries took the opportunity to phase out the use of cheques altogether. As of 2010, many countries have either phased out the use of cheques altogether or signaled that they would do so in the future.

== Parts of a cheque ==
The four main items on a cheque are:
* &quot;Drawer&quot;: the person or entity whose transaction account is to be drawn. Usually, the drawer&#x27;s name and account is preprinted on the cheque, and the drawer is usually the signatory.
* &quot;Payee&quot;: the person or entity who is to be paid the amount.
* &quot;Drawee&quot;: the bank or other financial institution where the cheque can be presented for payment. This is usually preprinted on the cheque.
* &quot;Amount&quot;: the currency amount. The amount and currency (e.g., dollars, pounds, etc.) usually must be written in words and in figures. The currency is usually the local currency, but may be a foreign currency.

As cheque usage increased during the 19th and 20th centuries, additional items were added to increase security or to make processing easier for the financial institution. A signature of the drawer was required to authorize the cheque, and this is the main way to authenticate the cheque. Second, it became customary to write the amount in words as well as in numbers to avoid mistakes and make it harder to fraudulently alter the amount after the cheque had been written. It is not a legal requirement to write the amount in words, although some banks will refuse to accept cheques that do not have the amount in both numbers and words.

An issue date was added, and cheques may become invalid a certain amount of time after issue. In the US and Canada, a cheque is typically valid for six months after the date of issue, after which it is a &quot;stale-dated cheque,&quot; but this depends on where the cheque is drawn. In Australia, a cheque is typically valid for fifteen months of the cheque date. A cheque that has an issue date in the future, a &quot;post-dated&quot; cheque, may not be able to be presented until that date has passed. In some countries writing a post dated cheque may simply be ignored or is illegal. Conversely, an &quot;antedated&quot; cheque has an issue date in the past.

A cheque number was added and cheque books were issued so that cheque numbers were sequential. This allowed for some basic fraud detection by banks and made sure one cheque was not presented twice.

In some countries, such as the US, cheques may contain a memo line where the purpose of the cheque can be indicated as a convenience without affecting the official parts of the cheque. In the United Kingdom a memo line is not available and such notes may be written on the reverse side of the cheque.

In the US, at the top (when cheque oriented vertically) of the reverse side of the cheque, there are usually one or more blank lines labelled something like &quot;Endorse here&quot;.

Starting in the 1960s, machine-readable routing and account information was added to the bottom of cheques in MICR format, which allowed automated sorting and routing of cheques between banks and led to automated central clearing facilities. The information provided at the bottom of the cheque is country-specific and standards are set by each country&#x27;s cheque clearing system. This means that the payee no longer has to go to the bank that issued the cheque, they can instead deposit it at their own bank or any other bank and the cheque would be routed back to the originating bank, and funds transferred to their own bank account.

In the US, the bottom -inch (16 mm) of the cheque is reserved for MICR characters only. Intrusion into the MICR area can cause problems when the cheque runs through the clearinghouse, requiring someone to print an MICR cheque correction strip and glue it to the cheque. Many new ATMs do not use deposit envelopes and actually scan the cheque at the time it is deposited and will reject cheques due to handwriting incursion which interferes with reading the MICR. This can cause considerable inconvenience as the depositor may have to wait days for the bank to be open and may have difficulty getting to the bank even when they are open; this can delay the availability of the portion of a deposit which their bank makes available immediately as well as the balance of the deposit. Terms of service for many mobile (cell phone camera) deposits also require the MICR section to be readable. Not all of the MICR characters have been printed at the time the cheque is written, as additional characters will be printed later to encode the amount; thus a sloppy signature could obscure characters that will later be printed there. Since MICR characters are no longer necessarily printed in magnetic ink and will be scanned by optical rather than magnetic means, the readers will be unable to distinguish pen ink from pre-printed magnetic ink; these changes allow cheques to be printed on ordinary home and office printers without requiring pre-printed cheque forms, allow ATM deposit capture, allow mobile deposits, and facilitate electronic copies of cheques.

For additional protection, a cheque can be crossed, which restricts the use of the cheque so that the funds must be paid into a bank account. The format and wording varies from country to country, but generally two parallel lines may be placed either vertically across the cheque or in the top left hand corner. In addition the words &#x27;or bearer&#x27; must not be used, or if pre-printed on the cheque must be crossed out on the payee line. If the cheque is crossed with the words &#x27;Account Payee&#x27; or similar then the cheque can only be paid into the bank account of the person initially named as the payee, thus it cannot be endorsed to a different payee.

=== Attached documents ===
Cheques sometimes include additional documents. A page in a chequebook may consist of both the cheque itself and a stub or &quot;&quot; – when the cheque is written, only the cheque itself is detached, and the stub is retained in the chequebook as a record of the cheque. Alternatively, cheques may be recorded with carbon paper behind each cheque, in ledger sheets between cheques or at the back of a chequebook, or in a completely separate transaction register that comes with a chequebook.

When a cheque is mailed, a separate letter or &quot;remittance advice&quot; may be attached to inform the recipient of the purpose of the cheque – formally, which account receivable to credit the funds to. This is frequently done formally using a provided slip when paying a bill, or informally via a letter when sending an ad hoc cheque.

== Usage ==
Parties to regular cheques generally include a &quot;drawer&quot;, the depositor writing a cheque; a &quot;drawee,&quot; the financial institution where the cheque can be presented for payment; and a &quot;payee,&quot; the entity to whom the drawer issues the cheque. The drawer &quot;drafts&quot; or &quot;draws&quot; a cheque, which is also called &quot;cutting a cheque&quot;, especially in the US. There may also be a &quot;beneficiary&quot;—for example, in depositing a cheque with a custodian of a brokerage account, the payee will be the custodian, but the cheque may be marked &quot;F/B/O&quot; (&quot;for the benefit of&quot;) the beneficiary.

Ultimately, there is also at least one &quot;endorsee&quot; which would typically be the financial institution servicing the payee&#x27;s account, or in some circumstances may be a third party to whom the payee owes or wishes to give money.

A payee that accepts a cheque will typically deposit it in an account at the payee&#x27;s bank, and have the bank process the cheque. In some cases, the payee will take the cheque to a branch of the drawee bank, and cash the cheque there. If a cheque is refused at the drawee bank (or the drawee bank returns the cheque to the bank that it was deposited at) because there are insufficient funds for the cheque to clear, it is said that the cheque has been &quot;dishonoured&quot;. Once a cheque is approved and all appropriate accounts involved have been credited, the cheque is stamped with some kind of cancellation mark, such as a &quot;paid&quot; stamp. The cheque is now a &quot;cancelled cheque&quot;. Cancelled cheques are placed in the account holder&#x27;s file. The account holder can request a copy of a cancelled cheque as proof of a payment. This is known as the cheque clearing cycle.

Cheques can be lost or go astray within the cycle, or be delayed if further verification is needed in the case of suspected fraud. A cheque may thus bounce some time after it has been deposited.
Following concerns about the amount of time it took the Cheque and Credit Clearing Company to clear cheques, the United Kingdom Office of Fair Trading set up a working group in 2006 to look at the cheque clearing cycle. Their report said that clearing times could be improved, but that the costs associated with speeding up the cheque clearing cycle could not be justified considering the use of cheques was declining. However, they concluded the biggest problem was the unlimited time a bank could take to dishonour a cheque. To address this, changes were implemented so that the maximum time after a cheque was deposited that it could be dishonoured was six days, what was known as the &quot;certainty of fate&quot; principle.

An advantage to the drawer of using cheques instead of debit card transactions is that they know the drawer&#x27;s bank will not release the money until several days later. Paying with a cheque without adequate funds backing it and later making a deposit to the account on which the cheque is drawn in order to cover the cheque amount is called &quot;kiting&quot; or &quot;floating&quot; and is generally illegal in the US, but applicable laws are rarely enforced unless the drawer uses multiple chequing accounts with multiple institutions to increase the delay or to steal funds.

=== Declining use ===
Cheque usage has been declining since the 1990s, both for point of sale transactions (for which credit cards, debit cards or mobile payment apps are increasingly preferred) and for third party payments (for example, bill payments), where the emergence of telephone banking has accelerated the decline, online banking, and mobile banking. Being paper-based, cheques are costly for banks to process in comparison to electronic payments, so banks in many countries now discourage the use of cheques, either by charging for cheques or by making the alternatives more attractive to customers. In particular, the handling of money transfers requires more effort and is time-consuming. The cheque has to be handed over in person or sent through mail. The rise of automated teller machines (ATMs) means that small amounts of cash are often easily accessible, so that it is sometimes unnecessary to write a cheque for such amounts instead. A number of countries have announced or have already completed the end of cheques as a means of payment.

In October 2023, the average American wrote just over one check that month, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The average value of these checks was $504, suggesting that most checks were used for larger purchases. This marks a significant decline from the year 2000 when Americans wrote an average of 60 checks annually.

==== Decline in Asia ====
In many Asian countries, cheques were never widely used and generally only used by the wealthy, with cash being used for the majority of payments except for India, where cheque usage was prevalent. Where cheques were used they have been declining rapidly, by 2009 there was negligible consumer cheque usage in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. This declining trend was accelerated by these developed markets advanced financial services infrastructure. Many of the developing countries in Asia have seen an increasing use of electronic payment systems, &#x27;leap-frogging&#x27; the less efficient chequing system altogether.

==== Decline in Europe ====
In most European countries, cheques are now rarely used or have been completely phased out, even for third party payments except for the United Kingdom, France and Ireland. In most western European countries, it was standard practice for businesses to publish their bank details on invoices, to facilitate the receipt of payments by giro. Even before the introduction of online banking, it has been possible in some countries to make payments to third parties using ATMs, which may accurately and rapidly capture invoice amounts, due dates, and payee bank details via a bar code reader to reduce keying. In using a cheque, the onus is on the payee to initiate the payment, whereas with a giro transfer, the onus is on the payer to effect the payment. 

In the United Kingdom, France and Ireland cheques continued to be used as cheque payments were free for the consumer. However these countries have also seen significant declines since 2000. Since 2001, businesses in the United Kingdom made more electronic payments than cheque payments. The UK Payments Council announced in 2011 that cheques would continue as long as customers needed them reversing a previous target to phase out cheques by 2018.

France, remains well ahead of its European counterparts in the use of cheque payments, as seen in 2020 where it is estimated that more than 1 billion cheque payments were made, compared to Italy, the country with the next highest number of payments, with under 100 million.

==== Decline in North America ====
The United States relied heavily on cheques, due to the convenience it affords payers, and due to the absence of a high volume system for low value electronic payments. In the US, an estimated 18.3 billion cheques were paid in 2012, with a value of $25.9 trillion. However even in the United States cheque usage has seen significant decline.

Canada&#x27;s usage of cheques is less than that of the US and is declining rapidly at the urging of the Canadian Banking Association. The Government of Canada claims it is 6.5 times more expensive to mail a cheque than to make a direct deposit. The Canadian Payments Association reported that in 2012, cheque use in Canada accounted for only 40% of total financial transactions.

==== Decline in Oceania ====
Both Australia and New Zealand were heavy users of cheques during the later part of the 20th century. However, following global trends both countries have seen significant decline in the use of cheques. 

In Australia, following global trends, the use of cheques continues to decline. In 1994 the value of daily cheque transactions was A$25 billion; by 2004 this had dropped to only A$5 billion, almost all of this for B2B transactions. Personal cheque use is practically non-existent thanks to the longstanding use of the EFTPOS system, BPAY, electronic transfers, and debit cards. The Australian payment systems strategic plan has said it will remove cheques by 2030.

In New Zealand, payments by cheque have declined from the mid-1990s in favour of electronic payment methods. In 1993, cheques accounted for over half of transactions through the national banking system, with an annual average of 130 cheques per capita. By 2006, cheques lagged well behind EFTPOS (debit card) transaction and electronic credits, making up only nine per cent of transactions, an annual average of 41 cheque transactionz per capita. Cheques were phased out completely in 2020 and no bank nor retailer accepts them in any form.

=== Alternatives to cheques ===

Payment systems other than cheques include:

# Cash
# Debit card payments
# Credit card payments
# Direct debit (initiated by payee)
# Direct credit (initiated by payer), ACH in US, giro in Europe, Direct Entry in Australia
# Wire transfer (local and international) via banks and credit unions or else via major private vendors such as Western Union and MoneyGram
# Electronic bill payments using Internet banking
# Online payment services, e.g. WeChat Pay, Alipay, PayPal, Venmo, Unified Payments Interface, PhonePe, and Paytm 
# Money orders or postal orders

== Variations on regular cheques ==
In addition to regular cheques, a number of variations were developed to address specific needs or address issues when using a regular cheque.

=== Cashier&#x27;s cheques and bank drafts ===
Cashier&#x27;s cheques and banker&#x27;s drafts, also known as bank cheques, banker&#x27;s cheques or treasurer&#x27;s cheques, are cheques issued against the funds of a financial institution rather than an individual account holder. Typically, the term &quot;cashier&#x27;s check&quot; is used in the US and &quot;banker&#x27;s draft&quot; is used in the UK and most of the Commonwealth. The mechanism differs slightly from country to country but in general the bank issuing the cheque or draft will allocate the funds at the point the cheque is drawn. This provides a guarantee, save for a failure of the bank, that it will be honoured. Cashier&#x27;s cheques are perceived to be as good as cash but they are still a cheque, a misconception sometimes exploited by scam artists. A lost or stolen cheque can still be stopped like any other cheque, so payment is not completely guaranteed.

=== Certified cheque ===
When a certified cheque is drawn, the bank operating the account verifies there are currently sufficient funds in the drawer&#x27;s account to honour the cheque. Those funds are then set aside in the bank&#x27;s internal account until the cheque is cashed or returned by the payee. Thus, a certified cheque cannot &quot;bounce&quot;, and its liquidity is similar to cash, absent failure of the bank. The bank indicates this fact by making a notation on the face of the cheque (technically called an &quot;acceptance&quot;).

=== Payroll cheque ===
A cheque used to pay wages may be referred to as a payroll cheque. Even when the use of cheques for paying wages and salaries became rare, the vocabulary &quot;pay cheque&quot; still remained commonly used to describe the payment of wages and salaries. Payroll cheques issued by the military to soldiers, or by some other government entities to their employees, beneficiants, and creditors, are referred to as &quot;warrants&quot;.

=== Warrants ===
Warrants look like cheques and clear through the banking system like cheques, but are not drawn against cleared funds in a deposit account. A cheque differs from a warrant in that the warrant is not necessarily payable on demand and may not be negotiable. They are often issued by government entities such as the military to pay wages or suppliers. In this case they are an instruction to the entity&#x27;s treasurer department to pay the warrant holder on demand or after a specified maturity date.

=== Traveller&#x27;s cheque ===
A traveller&#x27;s cheque is designed to allow the person signing it to make an unconditional payment to someone else as a result of paying the issuer for that privilege. Traveller&#x27;s cheques can usually be replaced if lost or stolen, and people frequently used them on holiday instead of cash as many businesses used to accept traveller&#x27;s cheques as currency. The use of credit or debit cards has begun to replace the traveller&#x27;s cheque as the standard for vacation money due to their convenience and additional security for the retailer. As a result, many businesses no longer accept traveller&#x27;s cheques.

=== Money or postal order ===
A cheque sold by a post office, bank, or merchant such as a grocery store for payment in favour of a third party is referred to as a money order or postal order. These are paid for in advance when the order is drawn and are guaranteed by the institution that issues them and can only be paid to the named third party. This was a common way to send low value payments to third parties, avoiding the risks associated with sending cash by post, prior to the advent of electronic payment methods.

=== Oversized cheques ===
Oversized cheques, also commonly referred to as novelty cheques, are often used in public events such as donating money to charity, announcing government grants, or giving out prizes such as those from lotteries or Publishers Clearing House sweepstakes. The cheques are commonly in size; however, according to the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, the largest ever is . Until recently, regardless of the size, such cheques could still be redeemed for their cash value as long as they would have the same parts as a normal cheque, although usually the oversized cheque is kept as a souvenir and a normal cheque is provided. Any bank could levy additional charges for clearing an oversized cheque. Most banks need to have the machine-readable information on the bottom of cheques read electronically, so only very limited dimensions can be allowed due to standardised equipment.

=== Payment vouchers ===
In the US some public assistance programmes such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, or Aid to Families with Dependent Children make &quot;vouchers&quot; available to their beneficiaries, which are good up to a certain monetary amount for purchase of grocery items deemed eligible under the particular programme. The voucher can be deposited like any other cheque by a participating supermarket or other approved business.

== Cheques around the world ==

=== Australia ===
The Australian Cheques Act 1986 is the body of law governing the issuance of cheques and payment orders in Australia. Procedural and practical issues governing the clearance of cheques and payment orders are handled by Australian Payments Clearing Association (APCA).

In 1999, banks adopted a system to allow faster clearance of cheques by electronically transmitting information about cheques; this brought clearance times down from five to three days. Previously, cheques were required to be physically transported to the paying bank before processing began, and dishonoured cheques were physically returned.

In June 2023 the Australian government announced it was moving to phase out the use of cheques by 2030.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, cheques standards and processing are overseen by Payments Canada. Canadian cheques can legally be written in English, French or Inuktitut. For a period Canada also had a tele-cheque, which was a paper payment item that resembles a cheque except that it is neither created nor signed by the payer—instead it is created (and may be signed) by a third party on behalf of the payer. Under CPA Rules these were prohibited in the clearing system effective 1 January 2004.

Canada&#x27;s usage of cheques is less than that of the US and has been declining rapidly at the urging of the Canadian Banking Association since 2000. The Government of Canada claims it is 6.5 times more expensive to mail a cheque than to make a direct deposit. The Canadian Payments Association reported that in 2012, cheque use in Canada accounted for only 40% of total financial transactions. The Interac system, which allows instant fund transfers via chip or magnetic strip and PIN, is widely used by merchants to the point that few brick and mortar merchants accept cheques.

The Canadian government began phasing out all government cheques from April 2016.

=== India ===

Cheques were first used in India by the Bank of Hindustan, the first joint stock bank established in 1770. In 1881, the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act) was enacted in India, formalising the usage and characteristics of instruments like the cheque, the bill of exchange, and promissory note. The NI Act provided a legal framework for non-cash paper payment instruments in India. In 1938, the Calcutta Clearing Banks&#x27; Association, which was the largest bankers&#x27; association at that time, adopted clearing house.

Beginning in 2010, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) along with the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) piloted the cheque truncation system (CTS). Under CTS, cheques are no longer physically transported to different clearing houses. They are processed at the bank where they are presented, where an image of the cheque using Magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) is captured and digitally transmitted.

In 2009 cheques were still widely used as a means of payment in trade, and also by individuals to pay other individuals or utility bills. One of the reasons was that banks usually provided cheques for free to their individual account holders. However, cheques are now rarely accepted at point of sale in retail stores where cash and cards are payment methods of choice. Electronic payment transfer continued to gain popularity in India and like other countries this caused a subsequent reduction in volumes of cheques issued each year. In 2009 the Reserve Bank of India reported there was a five percent decline in cheque usage compared to the previous year. In 2019, the Reserve Bank of India reported that while cheque usage continued to decline, the decrease was slow. The bank attributed the slow pace of the decline due to the fact that cheque volume had briefly increased after demonetisation in 2016 before continuing to fall, as well as the efficiency of India&#x27;s cheque clearing system.

=== Israel ===
Cheques were widely used in the retail market, between persons, and for other payments. The law rules that payments in cash cannot exceed 6,000 NIS, so cheque payment is a legal term when that maximum is reached. It was possible to pay at the cash desk at the supermarket or shop by cheque or issue a check for annual school payments for a child. Utility bills and property tax can be paid by cheque at the post office. Moreover, usually tenant issues twelve post-dated cheques to the landlord after signing the rental agreement: one cheque per month of the rental term; additional cheques signed by a tenant with an open date and amount for utility providers to ensure that the tenant will leave no debts.

Ten bounced cheques during a year would result in the restriction of cheques for the account, and the bank will bounce new cheques for a year. If the account owner continues to draw cheques during the restriction period, that person&#x27;s accounts in Israeli banks will be denied from issuing cheques.

=== Japan ===
In Japan, cheques are called , and are governed by .

Bounced cheques are called . If an account owner bounces two cheques in six months, the bank will suspend the account for two years. If the account belongs to a public company, their stock will also be suspended from trading on the stock exchange, which can lead to bankruptcy.

=== New Zealand ===
Instrument-specific legislation includes the Cheques Act 1960, part of the Bills of Exchange Act 1908, which codifies aspects related to the cheque payment instrument, notably the procedures for the endorsement, presentment and payment of cheques. A 1995 amendment provided for the electronic presentment of cheques and removed the previous requirement to deliver cheques physically to the paying bank, opening the way for cheque truncation and imaging.

In New Zealand, cheques once banked were processed electronically together with other retail payment instruments. &quot;Homeguard v Kiwi Packaging&quot; is often cited case law regarding the banking of cheques tendered as full settlement of disputed accounts.

In New Zealand, payments by cheque have declined since the mid-1990s in favour of electronic payment methods. In 1993, cheques accounted for over half of transactions through the national banking system, with an annual average of 130 cheques per capita. By 2006 cheques lagged well behind EFTPOS (debit card) transaction and electronic credits, making up only nine per cent of transactions, an annual average of 41 cheque transaction per capita. 

In 2020 New Zealand Banks began phasing out of cheques, and they are no longer accepted as payment. All have moved to other types of payment systems.Kiwibank stopped accepting cheques as payment on 28 February 2020, followed by ANZ on 31 May 2021. Westpac and BNZ stopped accepting cheques on 25 June and 30 June 2021 respectively; ASB was the last major bank to phase out cheques on 27 August 2021.

=== Poland ===
Poland withdrew cheques from use in 2006, mainly because of lack of popularity due to the widespread adoption of credit and debit cards. Electronic payments across the European Union became fast and inexpensive—usually free for consumers.

=== Turkey ===
In Turkey, cheques were usually used for commercial transactions only, and using post-dated cheques is legally permissible.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, all cheques must conform to an industry standard detailing layout and font (&quot;Cheque and Credit Clearing Company (C&amp;CCC) Standard 3&quot;), be printed on a specific weight of paper (CBS1), and contain explicitly defined security features.

Since 1995, all cheque printers must be members of the Cheque Printer Accreditation Scheme (CPAS). The scheme is managed by the Cheque and Credit Clearing Company and requires that all cheques for use in the British clearing process are produced by accredited printers who have adopted stringent security standards.

The rules concerning crossed cheques are set out in Section 1 of the Cheques Act 1992 and prevent cheques being cashed by or paid into the accounts of third parties. On a crossed cheque the words &quot;account payee only&quot; (or similar) are printed between two parallel vertical lines in the centre of the cheque. This makes the cheque non-transferable and is to avoid cheques being endorsed and paid into an account other than that of the named payee. Crossing cheques basically ensures that the money is paid into an account of the intended beneficiary of the cheque.

Following concerns about the amount of time it took banks to clear cheques, the United Kingdom Office of Fair Trading set up a working group in 2006 to look at the cheque clearing cycle. They produced a report recommending maximum times for the cheque clearing which were introduced in UK from November 2007. In the report the date the credit appeared on the recipient&#x27;s account (usually the day of deposit) was designated &quot;T&quot;. At &quot;T + 2&quot; (two business days afterwards) the value would count for calculation of credit interest or overdraft interest on the recipient&#x27;s account. At &quot;T + 4&quot; clients would be able to withdraw funds on current accounts or at &quot;T + 6&quot; on savings accounts (though this will often happen earlier, at the bank&#x27;s discretion). &quot;T + 6&quot; is the last day that a cheque can bounce without the recipient&#x27;s permission—this is known as &quot;certainty of fate&quot;. Before the introduction of this standard (also known as 2-4-6 for current accounts and 2-6-6 for savings accounts), the only way to know the &quot;fate&quot; of a cheque has been &quot;Special Presentation&quot;, which would normally involve a fee, where the drawee bank contacts the payee bank to see if the payee has that money at that time. &quot;Special Presentation&quot; had been stated at the time of deposit.

Cheque volumes peaked in 1990 when four billion cheque payments were made. Of these, 2.5 billion were cleared through the inter-bank clearing managed by the C&amp;CCC, the remaining 1.5 billion being in-house cheques which were either paid into the branch on which they were drawn or processed intra-bank without going through the clearings. As volumes started to fall, the challenges faced by the clearing banks were then of a different nature: how to benefit from technology improvements in a declining business environment.

Although the UK did not adopt the euro as its national currency when other European countries did in 1999, many banks began offering euro denominated accounts with chequebooks, principally to business customers. The cheques can be used to pay for certain goods and services in the UK. The same year, the C&amp;CCC set up the euro cheque clearing system to process euro denominated cheques separately from sterling cheques in Great Britain.

The UK Payments Council from 30 June 2011 withdrew the existing &quot;Cheque Guarantee Card Scheme&quot; in the UK. This service allowed cheques to be guaranteed at point of sales up to a certain value, normally £50 or £100, when signed in front of the retailer with the additional cheque guarantee card. This was after a long period of decline in their use in favour of debit cards.

In December 2009 the Payments Council announced its intention to phase out the use of cheques completely in the UK by October 2018, so long as adequate alternatives were developed. They intended to perform annual checks on the progress of other payments systems and a final review of the decision would have been held in 2016. However, the decision was reversed in 2011 after vocal public, political, and industrial opposition, and cheques have remained in use.

Since 2001, businesses in the United Kingdom have made more electronic payments than cheque payments. Automated payments rose from 753 million in 1995 to 1.1 billion in 2001 and cheques declined in that same period of time from 1.14 to 1.1 billion payments. Most British utility companies charge lower prices to customers who pay by direct debit than for other payment methods.

The vast majority of British retailers no longer accept cheques as a means of payment. Shell announced in September 2005 that it would no longer accept cheques at their UK petrol stations, a change replicated by other major fuel retailers. Within a year, Asda, Boots, Currys and WH Smith had all phased out the acceptance of cheques.

In 2016, 432 million inter-bank cheques and credit-items worth £472 billion were processed in the United Kingdom. In 2017, 405 million cheques worth £356 billion were used for payments and acquiring cash, an average of 1.2 million cheques per day, with more than 10 million being cleared in Northern Ireland alone. The Cheque and Credit Clearing Company noted that cheques continue to be highly valued for paying tradesmen and utility bills, and play a vital role in business, clubs and societies sectors, with nine in 10 business saying that they received or made payment by cheque on a monthly basis. In 2022, 150 million cheques were used to make payments in the UK, compared to 1.6 billion payments in 2006. UK Finance estimates that only 0.2% of payments (70 million transactions) will be made by cheque in 2031.

In June 2014, following a successful trial in the UK by Barclays, the UK government gave the go-ahead for a cheque truncation system, allowing people to pay in a cheque by taking a photo of it, rather than physically depositing the paper cheque at a bank. Between 2017 and 2019, the Barclays scheme was rolled out nationwide as the Image Clearing System which has sped up the processing of cheques, reducing clearing times, and allowing customers to deposit them at ATMs and through mobile and online banking applications. Mobile banking has modernised the use of cheques; in the first 6 months of 2021, 3.8 million cheques were deposited by Lloyds Bank customers. Nevertheless, in 2020-21, the use of cheques declined by 19% year on year.

Cheques are still held to be a secure and reliable means of payment: cheque fraud in the UK in 2020 totalled just £12.3 million across 185 million transactions. In the same period, online authorised payment scams totalled £479 million across 4.1 billion online payments. As such, cheques have seen a resurgence in popularity in commercial transactions from businesses to avoid the possibility of phishing fraud.

=== United States ===

In the United States, cheques are referred to as &quot;checks&quot; and are governed by Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code, under the rubric of negotiable instruments.
* An &quot;order check&quot;—the most common form in the US—is payable only to the named payee or &quot;endorsee&quot;, as it usually contains the language &quot;Pay to the order of (name)&quot;.
* A &quot;bearer check&quot; is payable to anyone who is in possession of the document: this would be the case if the cheque does not name a payee, or is payable to &quot;bearer&quot; or to &quot;cash&quot; or &quot;to the order of cash&quot;, or if the cheque is payable to someone who is not a person or legal entity, for example if the payee line is marked &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;.
* A &quot;counter check&quot; is one that a bank issues to an account holder in person. This is typically done for customers who have opened a new account or have run out of personalized cheques. It may lack the usual security features.

In the US, the terminology for a cheque historically varied with the type of financial institution on which it is drawn. In the case of a savings and loan association it was a &quot;negotiable order of withdrawal&quot; (compare Negotiable Order of Withdrawal account); if a credit union it was a &quot;share draft.&quot; &quot;Checks&quot; were associated with chartered commercial banks. However, common usage has increasingly conformed to more recent versions of Article 3, where &quot;check&quot; means any or all of these negotiable instruments. Certain types of cheques drawn on government agencies, especially payroll cheques, may be called &quot;warrants&quot;.

At the bottom of each cheque there is the routing/account number in MICR format. The ABA routing transit number is a nine-digit number in which the first four digits identifies the US Federal Reserve Bank&#x27;s cheque-processing centre. This is followed by digits 5 through 8, identifying the specific bank served by that cheque-processing centre. Digit 9 is a verification check digit, computed using a complex algorithm of the previous eight digits.
* Typically the routing number is followed by a group of eight or nine MICR digits that indicates the particular account number at that bank. The account number is assigned independently by the various banks.
* Typically the account number is followed by a group of three or four MICR digits that indicates a particular cheque number from that account.
* Directional routing number—also known as the transit number, consists of a denominator mirroring the first four digits of the routing number, and a hyphenated numerator, also known as the ABA number, in which the first part is a city code (1–49), if the account is in one of 49 specific cities, or a state code (50–99) if it is not in one of those specific cities; the second part of the hyphenated numerator mirrors the 5th through 8th digits of the routing number with leading zeros removed.

A &quot;draft&quot; in the US Uniform Commercial Code is any bill of exchange, whether payable on demand or at a later date. If payable on demand it is a &quot;demand draft&quot;, or if drawn on a financial institution, a cheque.

The electronic cheque or substitute cheque was formally adopted in the US in 2004 with the passing of the &quot;Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act&quot; (or Check 21 Act). This allowed the creation of electronic cheques and translation (truncation) of paper cheques into electronic replacements, reducing cost and processing time.

The specification for US cheques is given by ANSI committee X9 Technical Report 2.

In 2002 the US still relied heavily on cheques due to the convenience afforded to payers, and due to the absence of a high volume system for low-value electronic payments. In practice, transfers of less than about five dollars are extremely expensive, and transactions of less than 50c impossible (transaction fees swallow the payment or exceed it). The only methods generally available for individuals and small businesses to make payments electronically are electronic funds transfers (EFT) or accepting credit cards. EFT payments require a commercial chequing account (which often has higher fees and minimum balances than individual accounts) and a subscription to EFT service costing anywhere from $10 to $25 a month, plus 10¢ per transaction (making transactions of 10¢ or less impossible, and transactions under $1 very expensive.) Credit card payments cost the recipient (or the payer) 33¢ plus 3% of the transaction, making transactions of 33¢ or less impossible, and transactions of $1 or less have at least a 30% service charge. Generally, payments by cheque (as long as the payer has funds in their account) and the recipient deposits it to their bank account, regardless of amount, have a service charge to both parties of zero.

Since 2002, the decline in cheque usage seen around the world has also started in the US. The cheque, although not as common as it used to be, is still a long way from disappearing completely in the US.

In the US, an estimated 18.3 billion cheques were paid in 2012, with a value of $25.9 trillion.

About 70 billion cheques were written annually in the US by 2001, though around 17 million adult Americans have no bank accounts. Certain companies whom a person pays with a cheque will turn it into an Automated Clearing House (ACH) or electronic transaction. Banks try to save time processing cheques by sending them electronically between banks. Cheque clearing is usually done through an electronic cheque broker, such as The Clearing House, Viewpointe LLC or the Federal Reserve Banks. Copies of the cheques are stored at a bank or the broker, for periods up to 99 years, and this is why some cheque archives have grown to 20 petabytes. The access to these archives is now worldwide, as most bank programming is now done offshore. Many utilities and most credit cards will also allow customers to pay by providing bank information and having the payee draw payment from the customer&#x27;s account (direct debit). Many people in the US pay their bills or transfer money via paper money orders, as these have security advantages over mailing cash and require no bank-account access.

== Cheque fraud ==
Cheques have been a tempting target for criminals to steal money or goods from the drawer, payee or the banks. A number of measures have been introduced to combat fraud over the years. These range from things like writing a cheque so it is difficult to alter after it is drawn, to mechanisms like crossing a cheque so that it can only be paid into another bank&#x27;s account providing some traceability. However, the inherent security weaknesses of cheques as a payment method, such as having only the signature as the main authentication method and not knowing if funds will be received until the clearing cycle is complete, have made them vulnerable to a number of different types of fraud.

=== Embezzlement ===
Taking advantage of the float period (cheque kiting) to delay the notice of non-existent funds. This often involves trying to convince a merchant or other recipient, hoping the recipient will not suspect that the cheque will not clear, giving time for the fraudster to disappear.

=== Forgery ===
Sometimes, forgery is the method of choice in defrauding a bank. One form of forgery involves the use of a victim&#x27;s legitimate cheques, that have either been stolen and then cashed, or altering a cheque that has been legitimately written to the perpetrator, by adding words or digits to inflate the amount.

=== Identity theft ===
Since cheques include significant personal information (name, account number, signature and in some countries driver&#x27;s license number, the address or phone number of the account holder), they can be used for identity theft. The practice was discontinued as identity theft became widespread.

== Dishonoured cheques ==

A dishonoured cheque is literally one where the payment has not been honoured. i.e. The payment has been refused by the payer&#x27;s bank, for many of various reasons. Colloquially, it is referred to as &quot;bounced&quot;. Such a cheque cannot be redeemed for its value and is worthless; they are also known as an &quot;RDI&quot; (returned deposit item), or &quot;NSF&quot; (non-sufficient funds) cheque. Cheques are usually dishonoured because the drawer&#x27;s account has been frozen or limited, or because there are insufficient funds in the drawer&#x27;s account when the cheque was redeemed. A cheque drawn on an account with insufficient funds is said to have &quot;bounced&quot; and may be called a &quot;rubber cheque&quot;. Banks will typically charge customers for issuing a dishonoured cheque, and in some jurisdictions such an act is a criminal action. A drawer may also issue a &quot;stop&quot; on a cheque, instructing the financial institution not to honour a particular cheque.

In England and Wales, they are typically returned marked &quot;Refer to Drawer&quot;—an instruction to contact the person issuing the cheque for an explanation as to why the cheque was not honoured. This wording was brought in after a bank was successfully sued for libel after returning a cheque with the phrase &quot;Insufficient Funds&quot; after making an error—the court ruled that as there were sufficient funds the statement was demonstrably false and damaging to the reputation of the person issuing the cheque. Despite the use of this revised phrase, successful libel lawsuits brought against banks by individuals remained for similar errors.

In Scotland, a cheque acts as an assignment of the amount of money to the payee. As such, if a cheque is dishonoured in Scotland, what funds are present in the bank account are &quot;attached&quot; and frozen, until either sufficient funds are credited to the account to pay the cheque, the drawer recovers the cheque and hands it into the bank, or the drawer obtains a letter from the payee stating that they have no further interest in the cheque.

A cheque may also be dishonoured because it is stale or not cashed within a &quot;void after date&quot;. Many cheques have an explicit notice printed on the cheque that it is void after some period of days. In the US, banks are not required by the Uniform Commercial Code to honour a , which is a cheque presented six months after it is dated.

=== Consumer reporting ===
In the United States some consumer reporting agencies such as ChexSystems, Early Warning Services, and TeleCheck have been providing cheque verification services that track how people manage their chequing accounts. Banks use the agencies to screen chequing account applicants, and those with low debit scores are denied because banks cannot afford overdrawn accounts.

In the United Kingdom, in common with other items such as Direct Debits or standing orders, dishonoured cheques can be reported on a customer&#x27;s credit file, although not individually and this does not happen universally amongst banks. Dishonoured payments from current accounts can be marked in the same manner as missed payments on the customer&#x27;s credit report.

== Lock box ==

Typically when customers pay bills with cheques (like gas or water bills), the mail will go to a &quot;lock box&quot; at the post office. There a bank will pick up all the mail, sort it, open it, take the cheques and remittance advice out, process it all through electronic machinery, and post the funds to the proper accounts. In modern systems, taking advantage of the Check 21 Act, as in the United States many cheques are transformed into electronic objects and the paper is destroyed.

<text>In chess and similar games, check is a condition that occurs when a player&#x27;s king is under threat of on the opponent&#x27;s next turn. A king so threatened is said to be &quot;in check&quot;. A player must get out of check if possible by moving the king to an unattacked square, interposing a piece between the threatening piece and the king, or capturing the threatening piece. If the player cannot remove the check by any of these options, the game ends in checkmate and the player loses. Players cannot make any move that puts their own king in check.
==Overview==



A check is the result of a move that places the opposing king under an immediate threat of capture by one (or occasionally two) of the player&#x27;s pieces. Making a move that checks is sometimes called &quot;giving check&quot;. Even if a piece is pinned against the player&#x27;s own king, it may still give check. For example, in the diagrammed position, White has just played Be4+, simultaneously giving check and blocking the check from Black&#x27;s rook. Black must now address the check; the fact that the bishop cannot legally move is irrelevant. If the king is in check and the checked player has no legal move to get out of check, the king is checkmated and the player loses.

Under the standard rules of chess, a player may not make any move that places or leaves their king in check. A player may move the king, capture the threatening piece, or block the check with another piece. A king cannot itself directly check the opposing king, since this would place the first king in check as well. A move of the king could expose the opposing king to a discovered check (and, rarely, checkmate) by another piece, however.

In fast chess, depending on the rules in effect, placing or leaving one&#x27;s king in check may result in immediate loss of the game.

==Getting out of check==
There may be up to three ways to get a king out of a single check (check delivered by just one enemy piece):
#. This is done with either the king or another piece, but the king cannot be placed in check from a different piece in the process.
#. The king is moved to an adjacent square where it is not in check. The king is not allowed to castle when it is in check.
#. Also called &quot;interposing&quot;, this is possible only if the checking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is at least one empty square in the line between the checking piece and the checked king. Blocking a check is done by moving a piece to one such empty square. (The blocking piece is then pinned to the king by the attacking piece.)
In the position in the diagram, White can get out of check by any of three methods:
# Capturing the attacking piece with the move Nxa2.
# Moving the king to any unattacked square (marked with &quot;x&quot;); namely, Kd6, Ke5, or Ke7.
# Blocking the check with the move Rc4 or Nd5.

If a king is placed in double check, the king must get out of both checks on the following move. Since it is impossible to capture both checking pieces or block both lines of attack in a single move, a double check can be escaped only by moving the king.

==Types of checks==
Sometimes a given check is part of a chess tactic such as a fork, a skewer, or a discovered attack on another piece. In some cases, a check can be used to defend against such tactics.

There are also a few more special types of check:
*&quot;Discovered check&quot;. A discovered check is similar to any other type of discovered attack except that it is a discovered attack on the opposing king. In a discovered check, a piece moves out of the line of attack by another piece so that this other piece (which can be a queen, rook, or bishop) is then checking the opponent&#x27;s king. A discovered check could be a tactic in itself because the piece that moved could attack or otherwise threaten another piece. The opponent has to get out of the discovered check on the following move and may not be able to also thwart the attack by the other piece that moved.
*&quot;Double check&quot;. A double check is a check from two pieces to the opponent&#x27;s king in a single move. This happens when a moved piece attacks the king, resulting in a second piece giving check by discovered check. It can also happen, though very rarely, when an &quot;en passant&quot; capture opens two lines of attack simultaneously. A double check cannot be blocked, nor can it be met by capturing one of the checking pieces (unless the king itself makes the capture), because both checking pieces cannot be captured or blocked in one move. Therefore, a double check forces the king to make a move. In algebraic chess notation, a double check move is sometimes noted with a &quot;++&quot; after the written move in place of the usual &quot;+&quot;, although &quot;++&quot; has been used to indicate checkmate (along with &quot;#&quot;).
*&quot;Cross-check&quot;. When a check is answered by a check, particularly when this second check is delivered by a piece blocking the first, it is called a &quot;cross-check&quot;. In fact, a &quot;cross-checkmate&quot; is also possible in that way (that is, to answer a check with a checkmate); but since no such term is in common use, it would be called cross-check as well.

==Announcing check and notation==

===History===
The idea of warning that the king was under attack (announcing &quot;check&quot; in modern terminology) is present in the earliest descriptions of chess rules, in Persian/Arabian manuscripts. This was done to avoid the early and accidental end of a game. Later the Persians added the additional rule that a king could not be moved into check or left in check. As a result, the king could not be captured .

In this usage, the words &quot;check&quot; and &quot;chess&quot; come via Arabic from Persian &quot;shāh&quot;, meaning &quot;king&quot; or &quot;monarch&quot; .

Less commonly (and obsolete), the warning &quot;garde&quot; can be said when a player directly attacks the opponent&#x27;s queen in a similar way. This was mostly abandoned in the 19th century . A move can be both check and &quot;garde&quot; simultaneously. Before the queen acquired its current move (about 1495) the rook was the most powerful piece. At that time the term &quot;check-rook&quot; was used for a move that checked the king and attacked a rook at the same time .

Until the early 20th century a player was expected to announce &quot;check&quot; when making a checking move, and some sources of rules even allowed a player to ignore an unannounced check .

===Modern practice===
In informal games, most players still announce &quot;check&quot;; however, this is no longer required under the rules of chess and is not encouraged in formal games . In the FIDE rules for rapid chess, if a player leaves or places their king in check or commits any other illegal move, their opponent can claim a win.

In algebraic chess notation, a &quot;+&quot; is normally written after a checking move. A minority of publications, most notably &quot;ECO&quot;, omit any mention of check.

==Checking in tactics and strategy==
Sometimes checking an opponent provides no benefit to the checking player. This is called a &quot;useless check&quot; and it may even provide the checked opponent with a tempo (move opportunity) to move the king into a safer position . For example, 1.e4 e6 2.d4 Bb4+ does nothing for Black and in fact causes him to lose a tempo after 3.c3 A check given with the sole intention of delaying an inevitable defeat by one move is referred to as a &quot;spite check&quot;, and may be considered somewhat unsporting .

There are many instances, however, when checking the opponent&#x27;s king may be a useful tactic or part of a tactic, either in attacking or in defense. Checking is often used in combinations with many other tactics or simply to an opponent into a position where their king can be checkmated, otherwise taken advantage of, or is otherwise worse for the opponent. Some attacks involve numerous checks to force an opponent into a losing position, especially when the king is exposed. 

Some uses of checking:
* Repetitive checking to prevent losing the game (draw by perpetual check)
* Royal fork (fork of the king and queen) or other forks involving the king
* Forcing an exchange
* Preventing castling by forcing the king to move
* Opening a line of attack by another piece (discovered attack)
* Limiting the opponent&#x27;s response to a move by moving with a discovered check
* Forcing the king to clear the way to capturing another piece (absolute skewer)
* Pushing a defending piece into an absolute pin
* Deflecting the king from protecting a piece or pawn
* Escaping a trap (e.g. a fork)
* Gaining a tempo

<text>Steven Fishman (born 1949) is an American former Scientologist whose inclusion of Scientology&#x27;s secret Operating Thetan levels in a court filing led to the first public confirmation by the Church of Scientology of its doctrines regarding Xenu and the Wall of Fire.

Fishman was serving a 21-year sentence on charges of wire fraud and money laundering, and was scheduled to be released on October 28, 2028. He was released on January 8, 2021.

==Fraud scheme==
The origins of Fishman&#x27;s dispute with the Church of Scientology lay in a fraud scheme he conducted from 1983 to 1988. Fishman joined dozens of class action lawsuits by presenting stock purchase confirmations he had stolen from his employer and forged. In this manner, he made approximately one million dollars, as much as 30 percent of which he spent on Scientology materials and services. Fishman was arrested in July 1988 and charged with several counts of fraud. The FBI also investigated the possibility of church involvement in the scheme.

Fishman&#x27;s attorney, Marc Nurik, had planned to use an insanity defense, offering false memory syndrome theorist Richard Ofshe and psychologist Margaret Singer as expert witnesses. Fishman sat for a seven-part videotaped interview with Ofshe and Nurik. In the interview, he discussed in detail various aspects of Scientology doctrine, his own Scientology involvement, and the church&#x27;s response to his arrest. Fishman claimed that church staff had ordered him to murder his psychologist, Uwe Geertz, who had knowledge of his Scientology involvement, and then to commit suicide.

At the same time, according to Fishman, he participated in a conspiracy with church staff to deflect accusations of church involvement, by submitting fake documents and making false statements to his defense team. For these acts he was further charged with obstruction of justice. The court ultimately blocked Nurik&#x27;s defense strategy by rejecting both expert witnesses, based on the testimony of opposing expert Dick Anthony. Fishman pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud and one count of obstruction, and the court sentenced him on July 20, 1990, to five years imprisonment in the Butner Federal Correctional Institution. Fishman later claimed that the church hired Scientologist inmate Luis Martinez to kill him in prison. He was paroled in mid-1993.

According to Anthony, who had opposed Ofshe and Singer, Fishman&#x27;s criminal case was one of several in which they had attempted to introduce their ideas of coercive persuasion by religious groups. The court&#x27;s admissibility ruling came as a setback to American critics of cults. Ofshe and Singer sued Anthony unsuccessfully, claiming that he mischaracterized the basis of their theories in this and other cases.

==Libel case==

In 1991, while Fishman was still incarcerated, &quot;Time&quot; magazine published a highly critical cover story on Scientology by Richard Behar. The story mentioned Fishman&#x27;s fraud conviction and the alleged plot to eliminate him and Geertz. The church responded by filing libel lawsuits against Time Warner, Behar, and Fishman and Geertz jointly.

In support of his contention that he had been brainwashed and ordered to murder Geertz, Fishman attached a series of documents to a motion to reconsider venue. This filing has since become known as the Fishman Affidavit. It included purported Scientology documents describing obstructionist tactics to use in the event of an arrest, as well as versions of Operating Thetan levels I through VII and purported excerpts of OT VIII. Fishman&#x27;s filing placed the advanced materials on record at the district court, available for viewing by the general public. Despite an unsuccessful church motion to seal the court record and efforts to keep the court files continuously checked out, former Scientologist Arnaldo Lerma obtained the affidavit and posted it on the internet, after which it spread uncontrollably. In the process of suing Lerma for copyright infringement, the church confirmed that the copies of levels I through VII were accurate.

A federal district court summarily dismissed the church&#x27;s claims against Time Warner and Behar, finding that they had not acted with actual malice insofar as the church was concerned. The church dropped its claims against Fishman and Geertz after Geertz&#x27;s legal team served subpoenas upon such Scientologist celebrities as Kelly Preston, Juliette Lewis and Isaac Hayes. The court record in the Fishman case remained open to the public.

==Wollersheim litigation==
Fishman submitted a declaration on behalf of Lawrence Wollersheim in 1993, claiming firsthand knowledge of tactics the Church had used to interfere with Wollersheim&#x27;s lawsuit against the church. In the declaration (affidavit), Fishman alleged the Church had drowned the trial judge&#x27;s dog and made harassing phone calls to Wollersheim at night.

==Authenticity of Fishman&#x27;s Church History==

A substantial amount of controversy regarding Fishman&#x27;s involvement with the Church of Scientology has emerged in the decades since the affair. The allegations calling Fishman&#x27;s involvement into question initially came solely from the Church (CoS) itself and their legal representation, who pursued the libel suit after discovering that he was not in their member data or records. In August 2015, prolific Scientology critic and investigator Tony Ortega published an exposé on the Fishman Case; in which he characterizes Steven Fishman as a &quot;squirrel&quot; (or Independent Scientologist). He describes Fishman as follows:

In addition to there being no historical Scientology completions for Steven Fishman listed, produced, or published, many since-apostatized Scientologists named in Fishman&#x27;s self-published memoir, &quot;Lonesome Squirrel&quot;, have categorically refuted the events of the book mentioning them, and denied having known him altogether. Fishman himself has long asserted that he received OT levels I to VII and VIII respectively from two Sea Org members on separate instances. Ortega, though professing skepticism regarding this, states that he believes the OT-VIII document to be authentic nonetheless.

<doc id="1267520" wikidata="Q2615716" url="?curid=1267520" title="The Greek Myths">
<text>The Greek Myths (1955) is a mythography, a compendium of Greek mythology, with comments and analyses, by the poet and writer Robert Graves. Many editions of the book separate it into two volumes. Abridged editions of the work contain only the myths and leave out Graves&#x27;s commentary.

Each myth is presented in the voice of a narrator writing under the Antonines, such as Plutarch or Pausanias, with citations of the classical sources. The literary quality of his retellings is generally praised. Following each retelling, Graves presents his interpretation of its origin and significance, influenced by his belief in a prehistoric Matriarchal religion, as discussed in his book &quot;The White Goddess&quot; and elsewhere. Graves&#x27;s theories and etymologies are rejected by most classical scholars. Graves argued in response that classical scholars lack &quot;the poetic capacity to forensically examine mythology&quot;.

==Contents==
Graves interpreted Bronze Age Greece as changing from a matriarchal society under the Pelasgians to a patriarchal one under continual pressure from victorious Greek-speaking tribes. In the second stage local kings came to each settlement as foreign princes, reigned by marrying the hereditary queen, who represented the Triple Goddess, and were ritually slain by the next king after a limited period, originally six months. Kings managed to evade the sacrifice for longer and longer periods, often by sacrificing substitutes, and eventually converted the queen, priestess of the Goddess, into a subservient and chaste wife, and in the final stage had legitimate sons to reign after them.

&quot;The Greek Myths&quot; presents the myths as stories from the ritual of all three stages, and often as historical records of the otherwise unattested struggles between Greek kings and the Moon-priestesses. In some cases Graves conjectures a process of &quot;iconotropy&quot;, or image-turning, by which a hypothetical cult image of the matriarchal or matrilineal period has been misread by later Greeks in their own terms. Thus, for example, he conjectures an image of divine twins struggling in the womb of the Horse-Goddess, which later gave rise to the myth of the Trojan Horse.

===Pelasgian creation myth===

Graves&#x27;s imaginatively reconstructed &quot;Pelasgian creation myth&quot; features a supreme creatrix, Eurynome, &quot;The Goddess of All Things&quot;, who rises naked from Chaos to part sea from sky so that she can dance upon the waves. Catching the north wind at her back and rubbing it between her hands, she warms the &quot;pneuma&quot; and spontaneously generates the serpent Ophion, who mates with her. In the form of a dove upon the waves she lays the Cosmic Egg and bids Ophion to incubate it by coiling seven times around until it splits in two and hatches &quot;all things that exist ... sun, moon, planets, stars, the earth with its mountains and rivers, its trees, herbs, and living creatures&quot;.

In the soil of Arcadia the Pelasgians spring up from Ophion&#x27;s teeth, scattered under the heel of Eurynome, who kicked the serpent from their home on Mount Olympus for his boast of having created all things. Eurynome, whose name means &quot;wide wandering&quot;, sets male and female Titans for each wandering planet: Theia and Hyperion for the Sun; Phoebe and Atlas for the Moon; Metis and Coeus for Mercury; Tethys and Oceanus for Venus; Dione and Crius for Mars; Themis and Eurymedon for Jupiter; and Rhea and Cronus for Saturn.

Also included are the Homeric, Orphic and Olympian creation myths, as well as two &quot;philosophical&quot; creation myths.

=== Olympian creation myth ===
Graves offers his interpretation of “The Olympian Creation Myth” in a brief summary. In this interpretation, Mother Earth is the creator of the Earth as it is known, with water, greenery, and animal life. This creation of Earth was possible through the “fertile rain” cast over her by her son Uranus, whom the goddess birthed while asleep after emerging from Chaos. Mother Earth goes on in this retelling to give birth to six “children of semi-human form.” Three of these children are the Hundred-Handed Ones and the other three the Cyclopes. The role played by the children of Mother Earths three original Cyclopes&#x27; offspring is specified by the author as he explains the interaction they would eventually have with the mythological figure of Odysseus.

==Reception==
Graves&#x27;s retellings have been widely praised as imaginative and poetic, but the scholarship behind his hypotheses and conclusions is generally criticised as idiosyncratic and untenable.

Ted Hughes and other poets have found the system of &quot;The White Goddess&quot; congenial; &quot;The Greek Myths&quot; contains about a quarter of that system, and does not include the method of composing poems.

&quot;The Greek Myths&quot; has been heavily criticised both during and after the lifetime of the author. Critics have deprecated Graves&#x27;s personal interpretations, which are, in the words of one of them, &quot;either the greatest single contribution that has ever been made to the interpretation of Greek myth or else a farrago of cranky nonsense; I fear that it would be impossible to find any classical scholar who would agree with the former diagnosis&quot;. Graves&#x27;s etymologies have been questioned, and his largely intuitive division between &quot;true myth&quot; and other sorts of story has been viewed as arbitrary, taking myths out of the context in which we now find them. The basic assumption that explaining mythology requires &quot;any&quot; &quot;general hypothesis&quot;, whether Graves&#x27;s or some other, has also been disputed. The work has been called a compendium of misinterpretations. Sibylle Ihm refers to Graves&#x27;s &quot;creative mishandling of the Greek myths.&quot; Robin Hard called it &quot;comprehensive and attractively written,&quot; but added that &quot;the interpretive notes are of value only as a guide to the author&#x27;s personal mythology&quot;. The Disraeli scholar Michel Pharand replies that &quot;Graves&#x27;s theories and conclusions, outlandish as they seemed to his contemporaries (or may appear to us), were the result of careful observation.&quot;

H. J. Rose, agreeing with several of the above critics, questions the scholarship of the retellings. Graves presents &quot;The Greek Myths&quot; as an updating of William Smith&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology&quot; (originally published 1844), which Graves calls &quot;the standard work in English&quot;, never brought up to date; Rose is dismayed to find no sign that Graves had heard of the &quot;Oxford Classical Dictionary&quot; or any of the &quot;various compendia of mythology, written in, or translated into, our tongue since 1844&quot;. Rose finds many omissions and some clear errors, most seriously Graves&#x27;s ascribing to Sophocles the argument of his &quot;Ajax&quot; (Graves §168.4); this evaluation has been repeated by other critics since.

Graves himself was well aware of scholarly mistrust of &quot;The Greek Myths&quot;. In a letter to Ava Gardner, he wrote:

<text>Thermate is a variation of thermite and is an incendiary pyrotechnic composition that can generate short bursts of very high temperatures focused on a small area for a short period of time. It is used primarily in incendiary grenades. 

The main chemical reaction in thermate is the same as in thermite: an aluminothermic reaction between powdered aluminium and a metal oxide. Thermate can also utilize magnesium or other similar elements in place of aluminium. In addition to thermite, thermate sometimes contains sulfur and sometimes barium nitrate, both of which increase its thermal effect, create flame in burning, and significantly reduce the ignition temperature. Various mixtures of these compounds can be called thermate, but to avoid confusion with thermate-TH3, one can refer to them as thermite variants or analogs. The composition by weight of Thermate-TH3 (in military use) is 68.7% thermite, 29.0% barium nitrate, 2.0% sulfur and 0.3% binder (such as polybutadiene acrylonitrile (PBAN)). As both thermite and thermate are notoriously difficult to ignite, initiating the reaction normally requires supervision and sometimes persistent effort.

Because thermate burns at higher temperatures than ordinary thermite, it has military applications in cutting through tank armor or other hardened military vehicles or bunkers. As with thermite, thermate&#x27;s ability to burn without an external supply of oxygen renders it useful for underwater incendiary devices.

<text>Cueca () is a family of musical styles and associated dances from Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia. In Chile, the cueca holds the status of national dance, where it was officially declared as such by the Pinochet dictatorship on September 18, 1979.

== Origins ==
While cueca&#x27;s origins are not clearly defined, it is considered to have mostly European Spanish and arguably indigenous influences. The most widespread version of its origins relates it with the zamacueca which arose in Peru as a variation of Spanish Fandango dancing with &quot;criollo&quot;. The dance is then thought to have passed to Chile and Bolivia, where its name was shortened and where it continued to evolve. Due to the dance&#x27;s popularity in the region, the Peruvian evolution of the zamacueca was nicknamed &quot;la chilena&quot;, &quot;the Chilean&quot;, due to similarities between the dances. Later, after the Pacific War, the term marinera, in honor of Peru&#x27;s naval combatants and because of hostile attitude towards Chile, was used in place of &quot;la chilena&quot;. In March 1879 the writer and musician Abelardo Gamarra renamed the &quot;chilena&quot; as the &quot;marinera&quot;. The Marinera, Zamba and the Cueca styles are distinct from each other and from their root dance, the zamacueca.

Another theory is that Cueca originated in the early nineteenth century bordellos of South America, as a &quot;pas de deux&quot; facilitating partner finding.

The usual interpretation of this courting dance is zoomorphic: it tries to reenact the courting ritual of a rooster and a hen. The male displays a quite enthusiastic and at times even aggressive attitude while attempting to court the female, who is elusive, defensive and demure. The dance often finishes with the man kneeling on one knee, with the woman placing her foot triumphantly on his raised knee.

In Bolivia, there are many variations throughout the different regions. Cueca styles of La Paz, Potosí and Sucre are the elegant and static versions, whereas in Cochabamba and Tarija the style is much livelier and free. The same could be said with the music where in different regions rhythm and speed slightly differ amongst the regions. While dancing, handkerchiefs are used by both male and female dancers by twirling over the head. It is said the twirling of the handkerchief is a way to lure the woman.

== History in Chile ==
In Chile, the cueca developed and spread in bars and taverns, which were popular centers of entertainment and parties in the nineteenth century. During Fred Warpole&#x27;s stay in Chile between 1844 and 1848, he described some characteristics of the dance: guitar or harp accompaniment, hand drumming or tambourine for rhythm, high-pitched singing, and a unique strumming pattern where the guitarist strums all the strings, punctuated by a slap on the guitar body.

The Chilean cueca is not just Zamacueca; it is a blend of different dances of the time, with Zamacueca being just one influential aspect. The Chilean cueca is highly structured in terms of dance, lyrics, and music, akin to early European dances from colonial times. While the genre does incorporate some Afro-oriented aspects like Zamacueca, cueca represents a fusion of various genres. To understand its evolution, one should observe the different Spanish, European, and popular dances of the era. The Arab-Andalusian influence is considered the most significant contribution to cueca in all aspects—dancing, singing, and tempo—and is regarded as its primary root.

During the second half of the nineteenth century, cueca spread to various Latin American countries, where the dance became known simply as the &quot;chilena&quot; (Chilean). In Argentina, cueca first appeared in Cuyo, in the central west of the country near the Chilean border, documented as early as around 1840. Unlike the northeast and central west, in Buenos Aires the dance was known as &quot;cueca&quot; rather than &quot;chilena&quot;, with documented presence from the 1850s onward. Similarly, in Bolivia, like much of Argentina, the dance was referred to as &quot;chilena&quot;. Chilean sailors and adventurers carried cueca to the Mexican coast, specifically in Guerrero and Oaxaca, where the dance was also called &quot;chilena&quot;. In Peru, the dance became immensely popular during the 1860s and 1870s and was also known as the &quot;chilena&quot;.

===Twentieth century===
During the twentieth century, cueca became associated with the common man in Chile, and through them, the dance spread to pre-industrialized urban areas such as La Vega, Estación, and Matadero, which were on the outskirts of Santiago at the time. In the 1970s, cueca and Mexican music enjoyed similar levels of popularity in the Chilean countryside. Due to being distinctly Chilean, cueca was chosen by Pinochet&#x27;s military dictatorship to be promoted.

Cueca was officially declared the national dance of Chile due to its significant presence throughout the country&#x27;s history, announced via a public decree in the Official Journal (Diario Oficial) on November 6, 1979. Emilio Ignacio Santana, a cueca specialist, argues that the dictatorship&#x27;s appropriation and promotion of cueca had negative effects on the genre. According to Santana, the dictatorship&#x27;s endorsement resulted in the wealthy landlord (huaso) becoming the icon associated with cueca, rather than the rural laborer.

===Cueca sola===
 is a solo variant of the cueca created in 1978 by Violeta Zúñiga and other members of the Association of Families of the Detained-Disappeared (AFDD) as a non-violent protest against the Pinochet dictatorship. In this form of cueca, a woman (arpillerista) dances alone while holding a photograph of her disappeared loved one. 

During the television campaign advertising the &quot;No&quot; option in the 1988 Chilean national plebiscite, a group of women (played by real-life relatives of the disappeared) performed the cueca sola. This powerful display of resistance was later re-enacted by surviving members of the group for the 2012 Academy Award-nominated film &quot;No&quot;, directed by Pablo Larraín. 

The symbolic gesture of cueca sola inspired the 1987 song &quot;They Dance Alone (Cueca Solo)&quot; by Sting.

==Clothing and dance==

The clothing worn during the cueca dance is traditional Chilean attire. Men typically wear a huaso&#x27;s hat, shirts, a flannel poncho, riding pants, short jacket, riding boots, and spurs. Women wear flowered dresses.

The cueca dance itself symbolizes a rooster-chicken relationship. The man initiates the dance by approaching the woman and offering his arm. The woman then accompanies him, and together they walk around the room. They eventually face each other, each holding a handkerchief in the air, and begin dancing. Although they do not touch physically, they maintain contact through facial expressions and movements that convey flirtation and courtship.

Throughout the dance, it is customary for the pair to wave a white handkerchief, which is an essential element of the cueca.

== Basic structure==

The basic structure of the cueca is that it is a compound meter in or and is divided into three sections.

Some differences can be noticed depending on geographical location. There are three distinct variants in addition to the traditional cueca:

* The northern cueca: The main difference with this version is that there is no singing in the accompanying music which is played with only sicus, zamponas, and brass. trumpets, tubas. Also, both the music and the dance are slower. This dance is done during religious ceremonies and carnival.
* The cueca from the central region: This genre is mostly seen in Chile. The guitar, accordion, guitarron, and percussion are the prevailing instruments.
*The Chiloé cueca: This form has the absence of the cuarteta. The seguidilla are repeated and there is a greater emphasis on the way the lyrics are presented by the vocalist.

==Contemporary cueca==

Currently, the cueca remains a vibrant tradition primarily celebrated in Chilean countryside regions, especially during the national holidays on September 18th. Cueca tournaments are popular events held around this time of year, showcasing regional variations and styles.

In Bolivia, cueca styles vary significantly by region: cueca paceña, cueca cochabambina, cueca chuquisaqueña, cueca tarijeña, cueca potosina, and cueca chaqueña. While they share a common rhythm, each style differs in speed, costumes, and mannerisms. Cueca styles in La Paz, Potosí, and Sucre are known for their elegance, whereas in Cochabamba and Tarija, the dance is characterized by liveliness. In Bolivia, it is often referred to as &quot;cuequita boliviana&quot;.

In Argentina, cueca is danced in various ways across different provinces, predominantly in the northern and western regions such as Mendoza, Chaco, Salta, Jujuy, Catamarca, and La Rioja. Each Argentine province has its distinct style and approach to dancing cueca.

==Cueca in Tarija, Bolivia==

Tarija, Bolivia, boasts a few traditional songs accompanied by dances, one of which is the cueca tarijeña. Despite sharing its name with dances from other departments, such as the cueca paceña representing La Paz, each department&#x27;s dance varies significantly. The cueca tarijeña is known for its upbeat, fun, and playful nature compared to others that are more tranquil. Additionally, Tarija was the first place to incorporate a violin into the song, adding flair and excitement. Since its origin, the cueca has been a source of happiness for dancers due to its lively music and the requirement for partners to engage enthusiastically with each other.

The cueca is danced with a handkerchief, symbolizing affection for others. Participants start with the handkerchief in their right hand, twirling it near their shoulder and then waving it by the left side of their waist on certain beats. Throughout the dance, the man seeks to impress his partner with his dancing skills. The dance reflects Bolivia&#x27;s male-dominated gender roles; while men perform intricate movements and spin, women mostly sway their hips. It is designed for women to showcase their beauty and for men to display their talent. The women follow the male lead, who decides whether to flirt by placing the handkerchief near her neck and shoulders, hold it behind her neck with both hands, or simply wave it near his shoulder and waist if he chooses not to flirt. This determines whether they will continue dancing together in the next part of the song or find other partners.

<text>Bernard Courtois (), also spelled Barnard Courtois, (8 February 1777 – 27 September 1838) was a French chemist credited with first isolating iodine, making early photography possible.

By 1811 the Napoleonic Wars had made the government-controlled saltpeter business taper off since there was by then a shortage of wood ashes with which potassium nitrate was made. As an alternative, the needed potassium nitrate was derived from seaweed that was abundant on the Normandy and Brittany shores. The seaweed also had another, yet undiscovered, important chemical. One day towards the end of 1811 while Courtois was isolating sodium and potassium compounds from seaweed ash, he discovered iodine after he added sulfuric acid to the seaweed ash. He was investigating corrosion of his copper vessels when he noticed a vapor given off. It was in the form of an unusual purple vapor. Humphry Davy later records 

== Later life ==
Courtois was acknowledged by Humphry Davy and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac as the true discoverer of iodine. In 1822, he began manufacturing high-quality iodine and its salts. In 1831, he was awarded 6,000 francs as part of the Montyon Prize by &quot;L&#x27;Academie royale des sciences&quot;, for the medicinal value of the element. He struggled financially for the rest of his life and died 27 September 1838. He was 61 years old and had no assets to leave to his widow or son. In the year of his death, under the heading Obituary, the &quot;Journal de chimie médicale&quot; drily noted his passing with:&quot;Bernard Courtois, the discoverer of iodine, died at Paris the 27th of September, 1838, leaving his widow without fortune. If, on making this discovery, Courtois had taken out a certificate of invention, he would have realized a large estate.&quot;

<doc id="1267538" wikidata="Q6504757" url="?curid=1267538" title="Lawrence Wollersheim">
<text>Lawrence Dominick Wollersheim is an American former Scientologist who won a court judgement against Church of Scientology for compensation for the organization&#x27;s fraud, intentional infliction of emotional injury, and negligent infliction of emotional injury. 

Wollersheim sued the Church of Scientology in 1980. The story of Xenu was made public when Church materials detailing the Operating Thetan Level 3 were used as exhibits. In Wollersheim&#x27;s court case, Scientology&#x27;s &quot;top secret&quot; materials about Xenu and their beliefs in past alien invasions of Earth was filed with the Los Angeles court on his behalf and then copied from court records and published by media all over the world. Wollersheim won the case and was ultimately awarded $2.5million in 1989 (equivalent to $million in ). Officials from the Scientology organization said they would not pay the judgement. The organization removed assets from the Church of Scientology legal entity against which the judgement was made, in order to fraudulently claim it was bankrupt, but in 2002 it was forced to pay the award with interest, totalling $8.7million (equivalent to $million in ).

Wollersheim co-founded Factnet.org in 1993, an organization whose stated goal was to help other victims of cult abuse. He has since been active with several other non-profit organizations.

== &quot;Wollersheim v. Church of Scientology&quot; ==

=== Background ===

Wollersheim first got into Scientology in 1969. In 1973, he joined Scientology&#x27;s Sea Org and worked at the Celebrity Centre, and later was sent to Scientology&#x27;s ship, the Bolivar. There, he was put on a strenuous work regime of 19-hour days and forced to sleep nine deep in the ship&#x27;s hold. He tried to escape the ship because he felt he was losing his mind, but he was captured and returned. He was convinced to disconnect from his wife, parents, and other family members, and was threatened with a freeloader bill if he left. At times he was locked in the ship&#x27;s hold for 18 hours a day, deprived of sleep, and fed only once a day.

Wollersheim said &quot;I went psychotic on OT III. I lost a sense of who I was.&quot; In 1979, he contemplated suicide, and Scientology forced him into more auditing. He had two further psychotic breaks during auditing procedures.

Wollersheim left the Sea Org and had been operating a business selling photography; almost all of his clients and 132 employees were Scientologists. When Scientology started their fair game tactics, they instructed all Scientologists to resign from working for him, to stop placing new orders, and stop paying any bills owed driving Wollersheim into bankruptcy. His mental condition deteriorated, and he ended up under psychiatric care.

=== The lawsuit ===

In 1980, Wollersheim filed a lawsuit against the Church of Scientology alleging fraud, intentional infliction of emotional injury, and negligent infliction of emotional injury.

To derail the lawsuit, Scientology filed a RICO lawsuit against Wollersheim, and then a second, third, and fourth lawsuit each were thrown out by the courts. They sued his attorneys and expert witnesses and started a campaign to discredit or blackmail one of his attorneys. The church also harassed the judge in the case, who claims he was followed, had his tires slashed, and his pet dog drowned in his pool.

During the five months of testimony, expert witnesses testified that the auditing and disconnection practices caused Wollersheim&#x27;s mental illness. They also introduced evidence detailing Scientology&#x27;s retribution policy, called Fair Game.

In July 1986, the jury awarded $5 million in compensatory damages and $25 million in punitive damages.

=== The OT III secret documents ===

During the trial, the OT III documents had been presented as evidence in the case and the judge announced that they would be made public. Not wanting their secret documents disclosed, 1,500 Scientologists crammed three floors of the courthouse in an attempt to block public access to their confidential &quot;scriptures&quot; by each requesting to photocopy the documents and overwhelming the clerk&#x27;s office so no one else could access them. Despite their efforts, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was able to get a copy and published a summary of them, which was enthusiastically taken up by newspapers throughout the US.

=== &quot;Not one thin dime for Wollersheim&quot; ===

Scientology officials vowed never to pay the fines, stating: 
The Church of Scientology appealed the judgment and the award was reduced to $2.5 million in 1989. The church challenged the $2.5 million award, but the case was dismissed and Wollersheim was awarded an additional $130,506.71 in attorney&#x27;s fees.

Scientology had gutted the assets of the Church of Scientology of California, the defendant in the case, and claimed it was bankrupt and couldn&#x27;t pay the judgment. Over the next few years, the Wollersheim side put together detailed evidence proving that Scientology had siphoned and moved assets from the California corporation to other organizations within the Scientology network.

Just one hour before a hearing that would have presented that evidence, on May 9, 2002 the Church of Scientology wrote a check for almost $8.7 million to pay off the judgment with interest. According to attorneys familiar with Scientology litigation, Wollersheim&#x27;s judgment is considered the first Scientology has ever paid outright.

=== $8.7 million ===

The courts doled out the money $5.4 million to pay off Wollersheim&#x27;s attorneys and some to pay off Wollersheim&#x27;s tax obligations on the award. &quot;On September 30, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Hess granted Wollersheim&#x27;s motion for the release to him of the remaining impounded funds, amounting to about $1.8 million.&quot;

Attorney Leta Schlosser, who had already received $100,000, sued for a further $5.3 million. In 2006, Judge Hess said Schlosser lacked an enforceable lien under the Rules of Professional Conduct, and a jury awarded her $313,000, which was promptly paid.

== FACTNet ==
In 1993, Wollersheim co-founded FACTNet (F.A.C.T.Net) with Bob Penny.

In 1995, Wollersheim&#x27;s Boulder apartment was raided by federal marshals with Church of Scientology officials and his computers were seized as evidence.

<text>The check or check mark (American English), checkmark (Philippine English), tickmark (Indian English) or tick (Australian, New Zealand and British English) is a mark (✓, ✔, etc.) used in many countries, including the English-speaking world, to indicate the concept &quot;yes&quot; (e.g. &quot;yes; this has been verified&quot;, &quot;yes; that is the correct answer&quot;, &quot;yes; this has been completed&quot;, or &quot;yes; this [item or option] applies&quot;). 

The x mark is also sometimes used for this purpose (most notably on election ballot papers, e.g. in the United Kingdom), but otherwise usually indicates &quot;no&quot;, incorrectness, or failure. One of the earliest usages of a check mark as an indication of completion is on ancient Babylonian tablets &quot;where small indentations were sometimes made with a stylus, usually placed at the left of a worker&#x27;s name, presumably to indicate whether the listed ration has been issued.&quot;

As a verb, to check (off) means to add such a mark. Printed forms, printed documents, and computer software (see checkbox) commonly include squares in which to place check marks.

==International differences==
The check mark is a predominant affirmative symbol of convenience in the English-speaking world because of its instant and simple composition. In other language communities, there may be different conventions.

It is common in Swedish schools for a to indicate that an answer is incorrect, while &quot;R&quot;, from the Swedish , i.e., &quot;correct&quot;, is used to indicate that an answer is correct.

In Finnish, ✓ stands for , i.e., &quot;wrong&quot;, due to its similarity to a slanted v. The opposite, &quot;correct&quot;, is marked with formula_1, a slanted vertical line emphasized with two dots (see also commercial minus sign).

In Japan, the O mark is used instead of the check mark, and the X or ✓ mark are commonly used for wrong.

In the Netherlands (and former Dutch colonies) the flourish of approval (or &quot;krul&quot;) is used for approving a section or sum.

In German-speaking countries, ✓ is used for “correct” or “done”, but not usually for ticking boxes, which are crossed instead. The opposite of ✓ is ƒ (short for &quot;falsch&quot; “wrong”).

<doc id="1267543" wikidata="Q7613634" url="?curid=1267543" title="Steve Poizner">
<text>Stephen Leo Poizner (born January 4, 1957) is an American businessman and politician who served as the Insurance Commissioner of the state of California from 2007 to 2011. Formerly a Republican, Poizner ran unsuccessfully as an independent candidate in the 2018 California Insurance Commissioner election.

Poizner has also been a Silicon Valley technology entrepreneur, founding and selling SnapTrack, Inc., Strategic Mapping, Inc, and EmpoweredU, and he is currently the founder and CEO of next generation GPS startup OneNav Inc. In 2001, following privately held SnapTrack&#x27;s sale for $1 billion to Qualcomm, Poizner served a year as a White House Fellow in the National Security Council. Starting one week before the September 11 attacks, Poizner held the position of Director of Critical Infrastructure Protection, and was involved in developing Homeland Security programs relating to cybersecurity and emergency response communication protocols.

==Background and early life==
Poizner was born on January 4, 1957, in Corpus Christi, Texas. Poizner attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering in 1978. He was a member of the prestigious Friar Society and Tejas Club, as well as president of the Alpha Phi Omega fraternity.

After graduating from UT, Poizner moved to California to attend the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where he received his M.B.A. in 1980 and was named an Arjay Miller Scholar.

Two years after Poizner graduated from Stanford, the national Jaycees organization sued the Palo Alto Jaycees chapter to expel the chapter for admitting female members. Working in coordination with other Jaycees chapters around the country, Poizner led the Palo Alto Jaycees in their legal defense of their efforts to admit women against the national organization&#x27;s wishes, and the case eventually reached the Supreme Court of the United States. Poizner and the Palo Alto chapter, along with its fellow groups in other communities, won the suit. Poizner&#x27;s wife was one of the first women admitted to the Palo Alto chapter.

In addition to his academic degrees, Poizner has also earned a black belt in Shotokan, a traditional Japanese form of martial arts.

Poizner and his wife, Carol, live in Los Gatos, California. They have one daughter, Rebecca.

==Entrepreneur and venture capitalist==
Poizner has started and run technology companies in Silicon Valley for over 35 years.

Poizner served for several years as a management consultant with the Boston Consulting Group.

In 1983, Poizner founded and served as chief executive officer of Strategic Mapping Inc., a software company that developed a program to display geographic data on digital maps, assisting police departments, utilities, transportation companies, banks and retailers with selecting new locations and plotting distribution logistics. Strategic Mapping was sold to Claritas in 1996, with the GIS mapping software being sold to ESRI.

In 1995, Poizner founded SnapTrack, Inc., which pioneered technology that put GPS receivers into cell phones. Poizner served as its chief executive officer until he sold the privately held company to Qualcomm in 2000 for a reported $1.0 billion in Qualcomm stock. Poizner&#x27;s personal net worth is believed to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

In June 2011, Poizner co-founded Empowered Careers, a mobile learning platform technology company in partnership with UCLA and Creative Artists Agency.

In February 2014, Steve Poizner was inducted into the Silicon Valley Engineering Council Hall of Fame.

In July 2014, Qualcomm Inc acquired EmpoweredU. Terms not disclosed.

In June 2017, Steve Poizner formed a non-profit organization in collaboration with select California Universities and research institutes, venture capitalists, and business leaders to grow the southern California venture capital and start-up communities. &quot;The purpose of the alliance is to make it easier for tech talent, especially students and professors at area universities, to start companies that commercialize the technology they&#x27;ve worked on. The group will work with universities to make processes like licensing of technology easier, and connect budding entrepreneurs with resources like potential investors.&quot;

==Education reform and community service==
In 2001, Poizner co-founded EdVoice, an educational non-profit organization dedicated to improving public schools and serving the interests of K-12 children in California.

From September 2002 to June 2003, he served as a volunteer teacher in San Jose&#x27;s Mount Pleasant High School teaching 12th grade American Government. Poizner authored a New York Times best selling book about his experience – &quot;Mount Pleasant&quot; – which has been both praised and criticized for its depiction of a low income public high school.

In 2003, Poizner co-founded the California Charter Schools Association.

In June 2011, Poizner joined two education Boards at the University of Southern California.

In September 2016, the San Diego Union Tribune reported that Steve Poizner has joined UC San Diego&#x27;s Rady School of Management as its inaugural entrepreneur in residence.

==California Insurance Commissioner==
The California Insurance Commissioner was created in 1988 via the voter approval of Proposition 103. Poizner took office on January 8, 2007, and served until January 3, 2011. As Insurance Commissioner, Poizner received praise for his handling of the San Diego wildfires in 2007, for taking on health insurance companies&#x27; illegal rescission practices and rate increases, and for decreasing spending in his state government department&#x27;s discretionary operating budget by 13%. At the end of his term, Poizner was praised for his efforts to streamline and modernize the CDI through spending cuts and conducting a top-down review of the department. Poizner oversaw nearly 2,800 fraud-related arrests, the most in CDI history, in a 3-year span and conducted the first ever terror finance probe by a US Insurance Commissioner, which resulted in millions of dollars diverted from Iran.

On February 13, 2018, Poizner announced he would seek a second term as Insurance Commissioner, running as an independent. He lost the election to Democrat Ricardo Lara by a margin of 47-53.

==Public service and civic affairs==

From 2001 to 2002, Poizner served as a White House Fellow where he worked in the National Security Council Office of Cyberspace Security, serving as Director of Critical Infrastructure Protection. In this capacity he developed strategies for protecting critical infrastructure against cyber-terrorism and developed an emergency communications plan for national security and emergency response personnel. Starting one week before the September 11, 2001 attacks, Poizner was responsible for issues such as emergency communications planning for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City and protecting Internet, banking system and power grids from cyber attacks.

In 2004, Poizner ran unsuccessfully for the California State Assembly against Democrat Ira Ruskin, a Redwood City Councilman, in the 21st district, losing by 5,884 votes out of 190,120 votes cast in 2004.

In 2006, Poizner ran for the office of California Insurance Commissioner. He ran unopposed in the Republican primary on June 6, and won the general election on November 7 by defeating Democrat Cruz Bustamante, then Lieutenant Governor of California, by a 12.4% margin.

In 2006, Poizner became a life member of the Council on Foreign Relations after being nominated by former Secretary of State George Shultz.

In late 2007, Poizner led the effort to defeat Proposition 93, a term limit removal initiative. As Chairman of the No on 93 campaign, Poizner contributed $2.5 million of his own money, secured No on 93 endorsements from over forty newspaper editorial boards, and appeared on talk radio across the state. Proposition 93 was defeated by 54% to 46% on February 5, 2008.

In May 2008, President George W. Bush appointed Poizner to serve on the Honorary Delegation to accompany him to Jerusalem for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel.

On September 15, 2008, Poizner announced his candidacy for Governor of California.

In May 2009, Poizner successfully campaigned against Proposition 1A (a $10 billion tax increase) during the California state special elections, 2009. Proposition 1A was defeated by a margin of 65.6% to 34.4% on May 26, 2009.

On March 1, 2010, Poizner officially became a candidate for Governor of California.

On June 8, 2010, Poizner was defeated in the Republican primary by former CEO of eBay Meg Whitman, who was later defeated by Democratic candidate Jerry Brown in the general election.

In early 2014, Steve Poizner was inducted into the Silicon Valley Engineering Council Hall of Fame.

In September 2016, the San Diego Union Tribune reported that Steve Poizner has joined UC San Diego&#x27;s Rady School of Management as its inaugural entrepreneur in residence.

Poizner declared his candidacy for a nonconsecutive second term as California State Insurance Commissioner in 2018.

==EmpoweredU==
Following his term as Insurance Commissioner, Poizner partnered with the Sherry Lansing Foundation and Creative Artists Agency to create Empowered Careers (later renamed to EmpoweredU), a mobile learning platform and content services company geared specifically for baby boomers in need of work or looking to switch careers.

EmpoweredU formed its first partnership with UCLA Extension to offer professional certificates and career counseling for adults seeking to remain viable in today&#x27;s job market.

Empowered Careers secured $15 million in Series A venture capital funding from two Silicon Valley–based firms, InterWest Partners and Granite Ventures, to develop the new online education company.

As the CEO of EmpoweredU, Poizner was an outspoken advocate for using technology and education to help many jobless baby boomers reinvent themselves and find work in second careers.

On July 4, 2012, Empowered completed development of a custom iPad application, The Empowered app, &quot;which took a little less than a year to write&quot;, and &quot;incorporates many of the device&#x27;s built-in functions.&quot; 
On January 16, 2014, EmpoweredU announced that it will launch pilot programs at the Viterbi School of Engineering, the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and the Rossier School of Education, as well as eight other universities across the nation, including Clemson University, Davis College of Business at Jacksonville University, Texas Southern University, University of San Francisco, University of California at Irvine, University of California at San Diego, Southern Arkansas University and Cambria-Rowe Business College.

In July 2014, Qualcomm Inc acquired EmpoweredU. Terms not disclosed.

On January 22, 2016 @StevePoizner tweeted that he is leaving Qualcomm to &quot;pursue new challenges&quot;.

== 2016 John Kasich presidential campaign ==
In February 2016, it was announced that Poizner had joined Governor John Kasich of Ohio as national co-chair and California State Chair for Kasich for President.

==Alliance for Southern California Innovation==
In June 2017, Steve Poizner formed a non-profit organization in collaboration with select California Universities and research institutes, venture capitalists, and business leaders to grow the southern California venture capital and start-up communities. &quot;The purpose of the alliance is to make it easier for tech talent, especially students and professors at area universities, to start companies that commercialize the technology they&#x27;ve worked on. The group will work with universities to make processes like licensing of technology easier, and connect budding entrepreneurs with resources like potential investors.&quot;

<doc id="1267548" wikidata="Q1366558" url="?curid=1267548" title="Sarmatism">
<text>Sarmatism (or Sarmatianism; ; ) was an ethno-cultural identity within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was the dominant Baroque culture and ideology of the nobility () that existed in the time from the Renaissance to the early 18th century. Together with the concept of &quot;Golden Liberty&quot;, it formed a central aspect of the Commonwealth social elites’ culture and society. At its core was the unifying belief that the people of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth descended from the ancient Iranian Sarmatians, the legendary invaders of contemporary Polish lands in antiquity.

The term and culture were reflected primarily in 17th-century Polish literature, as in Jan Chryzostom Pasek&#x27;s memoirs and the poems of Wacław Potocki. The Polish gentry wore a long coat, called &quot;kontusz&quot;, knee-high boots, and carried a (sabre), usually a . Moustaches were also popular, as well as decorative feathers in men&#x27;s headgear. Poland&#x27;s &quot;Sarmatians&quot; strove to achieve martial skill on horseback, believed in equality among themselves, and in invincibility in the face of the enemy. Sarmatism lauded past victories of the Polish military, and required Polish noblemen to cultivate the tradition.

&quot;Sarmatia&quot; () was a semi-legendary, poetic name for Poland that was fashionable into the 18th century, and which designated qualities associated with the literate citizenry of the vast Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Sarmatism greatly affected the culture, lifestyle and ideology of the Polish nobility. It was unique for its cultural mix of Oriental, Western and native traditions. Criticized during the Polish Enlightenment, Sarmatism was rehabilitated by the generations that embraced Polish Romanticism. Having survived the literary realism of Poland&#x27;s &quot;Positivist&quot; period, Sarmatism made a comeback with &quot;The Trilogy&quot; of Henryk Sienkiewicz, Poland&#x27;s first Nobel laureate in literature.

==Concept origin and its general idea==

The term &quot;Sarmatism&quot; was first used by Jan Długosz in his 15th century work on the history of Poland. Długosz was also responsible for linking the Sarmatians to the prehistory of Poland and this idea was continued by other chroniclers and historians such as Stanisław Orzechowski, Marcin Bielski, Marcin Kromer, and Maciej Miechowita. Miechowita&#x27;s &quot;Tractatus de Duabus Sarmatiis&quot; became influential abroad, where for some time it was one of the most widely used reference works on the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The idea appeared due to the humanists&#x27; romantic admiration of Antiquity and an attempt to return an outdated onomastics.

According to the &quot;Geography&quot; by Ptolemy, Sarmatia was considered to be territory of Poland, Lithuania, and Tartary and consisted of Asian and European parts divided by the Don River. As a geographical term, Sarmatia was always indistinct, but very stable. The presumed ancestors of the szlachta, the Sarmatians, were a confederacy of predominantly Iranian tribes living north of the Black Sea. In the 5th century BC Herodotus wrote that these tribes were descendants of the Scythians and Amazons. The Sarmatians were infiltrated by the Goths and others in the 2nd century AD, and may have had some strong and direct links to Poland. The legend of Polish descent from Sarmatians stuck and grew until most of those within the Commonwealth, and many abroad, believed that many Polish nobles were descendants of the Sarmatians (Sauromates). Another tradition came to surmise that the Sarmatians themselves were descended from Japheth, son of Noah.
Some holding to &quot;Sarmatism&quot; tended to believe that their ancestors had conquered and enserfed the local Slavs and, like the Bulgars in Bulgaria or Franks who conquered Gaul (France), eventually adopted the local language. Such nobility might believe that they belonged (at least figuratively) to a different people than the Slavs whom they ruled. &quot;Roman maps, fashioned during the Renaissance, had the name of &quot;Sarmatia&quot; written over most of the territory of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and thus &#x27;justified&#x27; interest in &#x27;Sarmatian roots&#x27;.&quot;

Centuries later, modern scholarship discovered evidence showing that the Alans, a late Sarmatian people speaking an Iranian idiom, did invade Slavic tribes in Eastern Europe before the sixth century, and that these &quot;Sarmatians evidently formed the area&#x27;s ruling class, which was gradually Slavicized.&quot; Their direct political connection to Poland, however, would remain somewhat uncertain. In his 1970 publication &quot;The Sarmatians&quot; (in the series &quot;Ancient Peoples and Places&quot;) Tadeusz Sulimirski (1898–1983), an Anglo-Polish historian, archaeologist, and researcher on the ancient Sarmatians, discusses the abundant evidence of the ancient Sarmatian presence in Eastern Europe, e.g., the finds of various grave goods such as pottery, weapons, and jewelry. Possible ethnological and social influences on the Polish szlachta would include tamga-inspired heraldry, social organization, military practices, and burial customs.

Sarmatism was used to integrate the ethnically different Lithuanian and Ruthenian nobles into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and also elevated Ukrainian Cossacks as part of this identity despite their non-noble status. Historian Karin Friedrich points out, from the writings of Commonwealth scholars Christoph Hartknoch and Thomas Clagius, that the German-speaking Protestant burghers of Royal Prussia also identified themselves with the ideology of Sarmatism, in particular, with its values of liberty, which they contrasted with Swedish or Imperial (German) identities which they associated with tyranny. Hartknoch claimed that &quot;one European Sarmatia, as one common mother, nurtured the Poles and Lithuanians and Prussians,&quot; while Clagius wrote of many nations &quot;diverse in customs, but all by origin from [Sarmatia].&quot;

Poles tracing their descent to the Sarmatians was part of wider tendency evident all over Europe, of various peoples tracing their descent to an ancient people who had lived in their country in Roman times: the Dutch taking up the Batavians as their forebears, the Frenchthe Gauls, the Portuguesethe Lusitanians, the Scotsthe Caledonians, the Swissthe Helvetii, the Romaniansthe Dacians, the Bulgariansthe Thracians, the Albaniansthe Illyrians, the Slovenesthe Veneti, the Hungariansthe Huns, etc.

==Culture==

Sarmatian belief and customs became an important part of szlachta culture, penetrating all aspects of life. Sarmatism enshrined equality among all szlachta, and celebrated their life style and traditions, including horseback riding, provincial village life, peace and relative pacifism. 

Sarmatists strongly valued social and family ties. Women were treated with honour and gallantry. Conversation was one of the favourite preoccupations. Guests were always welcomed – relatives, friends, even strangers, especially from abroad. Latin was widely spoken. Sumptuous feasts with large amounts of alcohol were organised. Male quarrels and fighting during such events was quite common. At their parties the polonaise, mazurka, and oberek were the most popular dances. Honour was of prime relevance. Marriage was described as &#x27;deep friendship&#x27;. Men often travelled a lot (to the Sejms, Sejmiki, indulgences, law courts, or common movements). Women stayed at home and took care of the property, livestock and children. Girls and boys were brought up separately, either in the company of women or men. Suing, even for relatively irrelevant matters, was common, but in most cases a compromise was reached.

Funeral ceremonies in Sarmatist Poland were very elaborate, with some distinctive features compared to other parts of Europe. They were carefully planned events, full of ceremony and splendour. Elaborate preparations were made in the period between a nobleman&#x27;s death and his funeral, which employed a large number of craftsmen, architects, decorators, servants and cooks. Sometimes many months passed before all the preparations were completed. Before the burial, the coffin with the corpse was placed in a church amid the elaborate architecture of the &quot;castrum doloris&quot; (&quot;castle of mourning&quot;). Heraldic shields, which were placed on the sides of the coffin, and a tin sheet with an epitaph served a supplementary role and provided information about the deceased person. Religious celebrations were usually preceded by a procession which ended in the church. It was led by a horseman who played the role of the deceased nobleman and wore his armour. This horseman would enter the church and fall off his horse with a tremendous bang and clank, showing in this way the triumph of death over earthly might and knightly valour. Some funeral ceremonies lasted for as long as four days, ending with a wake which had little to do with the seriousness of the situation, and could easily turn into sheer revelry. Occasionally an army of clergy took part in the burial (in the 18th century, 10 bishops, 60 canons and 1705 priests took part in the funeral of one Polish nobleman).

==Fashion==

Some Polish nobles felt that their supposed Sarmatian ancestors were a Turkic people and accordingly viewed their Turkish and Tatar enemies as peers, albeit ones who were unredeemed because they were not Christians. During the Baroque era in Poland, the art and furnishings of the Persians and the Chinese, as well as the Ottomans, were admired and displayed in separate chambers or rooms.

Sarmatism popularised Ottoman-styled clothing and attire for men, such as the żupan, kontusz, sukmana, pas kontuszowy, delia, and szabla. Thereby, it served to integrate the multiethnic nobility by creating an almost nationalist sense of unity and pride in the szlachta&#x27;s political Golden Freedoms. It also differentiated the Polish szlachta from nobility in Western Europe.

In accordance with their views on their supposed Turkic origins, Sarmatists&#x27; costume stood out from that worn by the noblemen of other European countries, and had its roots in the Orient. It was long, dignified, rich and colourful. One of its most characteristic elements was the kontusz, which was worn with the decorative kontusz belt. Underneath, the żupan was worn, and over the żupan the delia. Clothes for the mightiest families were crimson and scarlet. The szarawary were typical lower-body clothing, and the calpac, decorated with heron&#x27;s feathers, was worn on the head. French fashions, however, also contributed to the Sarmatian look in Polish attire.

The żupan was derived from the Turkish long garment dżubbah, the outer garment Kontusz from the Turkish kontosz, the Kołpak, a hat with a brooch, came from the Turkish kalpak and the high leather boots Baczmagi was derived from the Turkish Baczmak. The oriental-patterned Kontusz sash, which originally had to be imported from the Ottomans and Persia, became the most distinctive element of 17th century Polish clothing. Noblemen always wore a curved sabre, which was based on Ottoman-style sabres, while military commanders carried a baton or mace with a turquoise-encrusted gold or silver head (bulawa or buzdygan, based on the Turkish bozdogan), which was considered lucky in the Islamic world.

==Political thought and institutions==


Adherents of Sarmatism acknowledged the vital importance of Poland since it was considered an oasis of the Golden Liberty for Polish nobility, otherwise surrounded by antagonistic realms with absolutist governments. They also viewed Poland as the bulwark of true Christendom, almost surrounded by the Muslim Ottoman Empire, and by the errant Christianity of the Orthodox Russians and the Protestant Germans and Swedes.

What contemporary Polish historians consider to be one of the most essential features of this tradition is not Sarmatist ideology, but the manner in which the &quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot; was governed. The democratic concepts of law and order, self-government and elective offices constituted an inseparable part of Sarmatism. Yet it was democracy only for the few. The king, though elected, still held the central position in the state, but his power was limited by various legal acts and requirements. Moreover, only the nobles were given political rights, namely the vote in the Sejmik and the Sejm. Every &quot;poseł&quot; (or member of the Sejm), had the right to exercise a so-called &quot;liberum veto&quot;, which could block the passage of a proposed new resolution or law. Finally, in the event that the king failed to abide by the laws of the state, or tried to limit or question nobles&#x27; privileges, they had the right to refuse the king&#x27;s commands, and to oppose him by force of arms. Although thus avoiding absolutist rule, unfortunately the central state power became precarious, and vulnerable to anarchy.

The political system of the &quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot; was regarded by the nobility as the best in the world, and the Polish Sejm as (factually) the oldest. The system was frequently compared to Republican Rome and to the Greek polis – though each of these eventually surrendered to imperial rule or to tyrants. The Henrician Articles were considered to be the foundation of the system. Every attempt to infringe on these laws was treated as a great crime.

Yet despite fruits of &quot;golden age&quot; Poland and the Sarmatist culture, the country would enter a period of national decline; it brought in a narrow cultural conformity. Nonetheless, a crippling political anarchy came to reign, due to cynical use of the free veto by individual szlachta in the Sejm, and/or to the acts of unpatriotic kings. During the late eighteenth century, the woeful state of the polity resulted in the three Polish Partitions by neighboring military powers.

&quot;Was the Sarmatian way of life worth preserving? Some aspects of it, no doubt. But because the gentry insisted on jealously guarding its privileges, preventing their extension to other social groups, it doomed the structure of the Commonwealth to atrophy and to the revenge of the lower orders. ... Sarmatism was an ideological shield against the historical realities which contradicted it at every turn.&quot;

Since its original popularity among the former szlachta, Sarmatism itself went into political decline. It has since seen revision and revival, followed by eclipse.

==Religion==
&quot;Certainly, the wording and substance of the declaration of the Confederation of Warsaw of 28 January 1573 were extraordinary with regard to prevailing conditions elsewhere in Europe, and they governed the principles of religious life in the Republic for over two hundred years&quot; – Norman Davies.

Poland has a long tradition of religious freedom. The right to worship freely was a basic right given to all inhabitants of the Commonwealth throughout the 15th and early 16th centuries, and complete freedom of religion was officially recognized in Poland in 1573 during the Warsaw Confederation. Poland maintained its religious freedom laws during an era when religious persecution was an everyday occurrence in the rest of Europe. The Commonwealth of Poland was a place where the most radical religious sects, trying to escape persecution in other countries of the Christian world, sought refuge.

&quot;This country became a place of shelter for heretics&quot; – Cardinal Stanislaus Hosius, papal legate to Poland.

In the sphere of religion, Catholicism was the dominant faith and heavily emphasized because it was seen as differentiating the Polish Sarmatists from their Turkish and Tatar peers. Providence and the grace of God were often emphasized. All earthly matters were perceived as a means to a final goal – Heaven. Penance was stressed as a means of saving oneself from eternal punishment. It was believed that God watches over everything and everything has its meaning. People willingly took part in religious life: masses, indulgences and pilgrimages. Special devotion was paid to Saint Mary, the saints and the Passion.

Muslim Tatar nobles within the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth were also integrated into the same Sarmatian ideology but with a different pedigree; they were seen as parts of the Sarmatian &#x27;nation&#x27; but rather than being descended from Sarmatians, they were regarded as descendants of the related Scythians, another ancient steppe warrior culture.

==Sarmatist art and writings==

Art was treated by Sarmatists as propagandistic in function: its role was to immortalise a good name for the family, extolling the virtues of ancestors and their great deeds. Consequently, personal or family portraits were in great demand. Their characteristic features were realism, variety of colour and rich symbolism (epitaphs, coats of arms, military accessories). People were usually depicted against a subdued, dark background, in a three-quarter view.

Sarmatist culture was portrayed especially by:
* Wacław Potocki
* Jan Chryzostom Pasek
* Wespazjan Kochowski
* Andrzej Zbylitowski
* Hieronim Morsztyn
* Jan Andrzej Morsztyn
* Daniel Naborowski
* Justus Ludwik Decjusz

Latin was very popular and often mixed with the Polish language in macaronic writings and in speech. Knowing at least some Latin was an obligation for any &quot;szlachcic&quot;.

In the 19th century the Sarmatist culture of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was portrayed and popularised by Henryk Sienkiewicz in his trilogy (&quot;Ogniem i Mieczem, Potop, Pan Wolodyjowski&quot;). In the 20th century, Sienkiewicz&#x27;s trilogy was filmed, and Sarmatist culture became the subject of many modern books (by Jacek Komuda and others), songs (like that of Jacek Kaczmarski) and even role-playing games like Dzikie Pola.
One of the most distinctive art forms of the Sarmatists were the coffin portraits, a form of portraiture characteristic of Polish Baroque painting, not to be found anywhere else in Europe. The octagonal or hexagonal portraits were fixed to the headpiece of the coffin so that the deceased person, being a Christian with an immortal soul, was always represented as alive and capable of holding a dialogue with mourners during lavish funeral celebrations. Such portraits were props which evoked the illusion of the dead person&#x27;s presence, and also a ritual medium that provided a link between the living and those departing for eternity. The few surviving portraits, often painted during a person&#x27;s lifetime, are a dependable source of information about 17th-century Polish nobility. The dead were depicted either in their official clothes or in travelling garb, since death was believed to be a journey into the unknown. The oldest known coffin portrait in Poland is that depicting Stefan Batory, dating from the end of the 16th century.

Many of the szlachta residences were provincial mansions, with a mansard roof. Numerous palaces and churches were built in Sarmatist Poland. There was a trend towards native architectural solutions which were characterised by Gothic forms and unique stucco ornamentation of vaults. Gravestones and epitaphs were erected in churches for those who had rendered considerable services for the motherland. Tens of thousands of manor houses were built across the Commonwealth. At the entrance there was a porch or a loggia. The central place where visitors were received was a large entrance hall. In the manor house there was an intimate part for women, and a more public one for men. Manor houses often had corner annexes. Walls were adorned with portraits of ancestors, mementos and spoils. Few of the manor houses from the Old Polish period have survived, but their tradition was continued in the 19th and 20th century.

==Hairstyle and moustache==

The writer and poet Mikołaj Rej (Nicholas Rey) recounts that &quot;some people shave their beards and wear a moustache, some trim their beards in Czech style, others trim in Spanish style. There is also a difference around the moustache, some men are stroking it down, other men are brushing up. The nobility of the Sarmatian era did not have a beard and instead preferred a moustache, which became an indispensable attribute of a knightly face. Those who wore beards were said to be German&quot;. Jan Karol Chodkiewicz and Jan Zamoyski shaved their heads around, leaving a high tuft of hair above their forehead. This tuft was reportedly introduced in Poland by Samuel Łaszcz, who was the first to wear such a hairstyle. Only elderly senators had to wear a sumptuous beard, which was an expression of their high dignity or wisdom, as was the case in most European countries. The hairstyles and facial hair of the Polish nobility were also explicitly described by Giovanni Francesco Commendone who wrote that &quot;some Poles have their heads shaved, others have clean-cut hair, many have hair, some have long beards, others are shaved apart from moustaches. The Polish Sarmatian custom of shaving their heads except for a small wisp of hair on the scalp was derived from Turkic-Tatar custom.

==Modern usage==

In contemporary Polish, the word &quot;Sarmatian&quot; (Polish: &quot;Sarmata&quot;- when used as noun, &quot;sarmacki&quot;- when used as adjective) is a form of ironic self-identification, and is sometimes used as a synonym for the Polish character.

A scholarly journal on Poland, central and eastern Europe, was launched by Polish-Americans, published at Rice University and called the &quot;Sarmatian Review&quot;.

==Impact==

Lithuanians and Ruthenians living within the Commonwealth also adopted certain aspects of Sarmatism.
Some Lithuanian historians of that time claimed that their people were descended from Scythians who had settled in ancient Rome, which had become the home of their pagan high priest.

==Evaluation==

Sarmatism, which evolved during the Polish Renaissance and entrenched itself during the Polish baroque, found itself opposed to the ideology of the Polish Enlightenment. By the late 18th century the word &#x27;Sarmatism&#x27; had gained negative associations and the concept was frequently criticized and ridiculed in political publications such as &quot;Monitor&quot;, where it became a synonym for uneducated and unenlightened ideas and a derogatory term for those who opposed the reforms of the &#x27;progressives&#x27; such as the king, Stanisław August Poniatowski. The ideology of Sarmatism became a target for ridicule, as seen in Franciszek Zabłocki&#x27;s play &quot;Sarmatism&quot; (&quot;Sarmatyzm&quot;, 1785).

To a certain degree the process was reversed during the period of Polish Romanticism, when after the partitions of Poland memory of the old Polish Golden Age rehabilitated old traditions to a certain extent. Particularly in the aftermath of the November Uprising, when the genre of &quot;gawęda szlachecka&quot; (&quot;a nobleman&#x27;s tale&quot;), shaped by Henryk Rzewuski, gained popularity, Sarmatism was often portrayed positively in literature. Such treatment of the concept can also be seen in Polish messianism and in works of great Polish poets like Adam Mickiewicz (&quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot;), Juliusz Słowacki and Zygmunt Krasiński, as well as writers (Henryk Sienkiewicz and his &quot;Trylogia&quot;), as well as others. This close connection between Polish Romanticism and Polish history became one of the defining qualities of this literary period, differentiating it from other contemporary literature, which did not suffer from a lack of national statehood as was the case with Poland.

Various false etymologies purport to explain the name as a corruption of English words, most commonly &quot;Jimmy[&#x27;s] curry&quot;, &quot;Jimmy McCurry&quot;, or &quot;gimme curry&quot;, but no contemporary documentation of any of these stories has been found.

==Preparation==

<doc id="1267557" wikidata="Q7563208" url="?curid=1267557" title="Vital Signs (band)">
<text>Vital Signs () were a Pakistani pop and rock band formed in Rawalpindi in 1986 by two Peshawar University students. After their formation, they soon became Pakistan&#x27;s first and most commercially successful as well as critically acclaimed act. The band&#x27;s popular lineup consisted of keyboardist Rohail Hyatt, bassist Shahzad Hasan, guitarist Nusrat Hussain and vocalist Junaid Jamshed. Rooted in Rawalpindi with some influence from Western music during the conservative regime of President Zia-ul-Haq, the Vital Signs utilizes several genres, ranging from pop music to rock, and often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1990s, they came to be perceived by many Pakistani fans and country&#x27;s cultural observers as a &quot;promising new era of cultural revival&quot;. Their enormous popularity significantly opened a new wave of music and a modern chapter in the history of Pakistan.

The band built its reputation playing in university campuses and underground rock music concerts held in different parts of the country, before being noticed by PTV performing art section director Shoaib Mansoor. The band initially gained national prominence and popularity from their music video of their single &quot;Dil Dil Pakistan&quot; first aired on PTV. Written by Shaoib Mansoor, the song became a big commercial hit and critically acclaimed in the public; it was voted, in an unscientific poll as the third most popular song of all time by BBC World. By the early 1990s, the band members had become public celebrities and international stars in the midst of the 1990s. From the 1980s to the 1990s, they produced many of their highly successful and critically praised albums, what many cultural critics consider their finest material including the innovative and widely influential albums, &quot;Vital Signs 1&quot; (1989), &quot;Vital Signs 2&quot; (1991), &quot;Aitebar&quot; (1993) and &quot;Hum Tum&quot; (1995). The success of their second album marked the international prominence of the band, first traveling to the United States to perform, becoming the first Pakistani music act to go abroad on a tour.

After the disintegrating and fading of the band in 1998, they each enjoyed successful musical careers. Leading singer Junaid Jamshed went on to pursue a career as a solo singer and as an Islamic televangelist, Shahzad Hasan concentrated on his work as a music producer and Rohail Hyatt formed a production company. The Vital Signs is considered one of the most successful bands in Pakistan, having influenced many of the pop groups &amp; rock bands originating from the country.

==History==

===Early years and formation (1983–1986)===

The band was formed in early 1983 by two Peshawar University classmates, keyboardist Rohail Hyatt and bassist Shahzad Hassan, in Rawalpindi, Punjab Province of Pakistan, though no names of the band reached consensus. In 1983, the band started playing rock gigs at the local university campus, working with various unknown singers. The band came in contact with Jamshed after spotting him performing rock music gig in Peshawar University and Islamabad University campuses while as a student at UET in Lahore.

In 1986, Hyatt and Hassan officially formed the band after recruiting Nusrat Hussain as lead guitarist. The band began practicing by playing covers of Deep Purple, Eagles, Nazia and Zoheb, and Led Zeppelin in the early 1980s, and they made a name for themselves by playing in local five star hotels. As early as 1986–87, the band began looking for a lead vocalist, often going to local concerts to look for the singers. The band once again met with Junaid Jamshed after the band played with Jamshed at the Marriott hotel in Islamabad in 1987. Since 1983, Hyatt had wanted to recruit Jamshed as the band&#x27;s lead singer, but was unable to do so when Jamshed left for Peshawar shortly. In 1987, Jamshed joined his engineering university&#x27;s rock band, &quot;Nuts and Bolt&quot;, as a lead vocalist and performed at Flashman&#x27;s Hotel in Rawalpindi. While Jamshed was performing, Nusrat Hussain, and Rohail Hyatt also went to the concert in search of new talent at the hotel. When Jamshed came to perform at the stage, Nusrat had tipped Hyatt off with a &quot;that kid&#x27;s coming back; the guy you liked&quot; and that &quot;perhaps we should go and see him.&quot; Hussain urged Hyatt to see him and after Jamshed&#x27;s performance; they did and Junaid joined their band. A former band member Junaid Siddiqui was also added to the group to play drums for the hit music video &quot;Dil Dil Pakistan.&quot;

At the concert, Hyatt patiently waited for the concert to be over as it stretched on until midnight. The show lasted till 3:00 am because people wouldn&#x27;t leave, which was unheard of in Islamabad, where people packed up at 10:00pm. Junaid was immediately hired as the band&#x27;s lead singer and got an offer for a show to open for a band called &quot;String Fellow&quot;. The promoter asked for a name of the band and during this time, the band had not reached an official name, just a group of four guys. Shahi attributes the name of band to when his older sister, who had just gone to medical university, told them: &quot;This term of how you check the vital signs of life in a person&quot;. Hyatt immediately took the suggestion and named them &quot;Vital Signs&quot; for the first time since its formation. Using &#x27;Vital Signs&#x27; for the band&#x27;s name was further reinforced because it was also the name of hit album Vital Signs by Survivor which was one of the influences of the band.

===Rise to fame and recognition (1987–1989)===
In mid-1985, the Western-influenced rock music began to be noticed by the public and underground concerts were held all over the country. The rock music jolted the country in a time when the ultra-conservative regime of President General Zia-ul-Haq was reigning supreme as dictator masquerading as &quot;democratically elected&quot;. The President with a puppet parliament sanctioning his every move reeked of a Machiavellian brand of so-called &quot;Islamisation.&quot; President Zia-ul-Haq had famously and strongly denounced &quot;western ideas&quot; such as jeans and rock music. Various groups had garnered and gotten the attention of the public, and the rock music naturally got appreciated as it was out of the ordinary.

It was these political and economic tensions and pretensions, heavy metal power plays and the economic prosperity that also propelled the gradual expansion of the country&#x27;s urban middle and lower-middle-classes. According to the leftist cultural critic, Nadeem F. Paracha: &quot;The youth culture at that emerged from these classes that launched the first shots of the kind of pop culture, scene and music we now call modern Pakistani pop and rock.&quot;

In mid-1986, Benazir Bhutto returned to the country and organised a mammoth rally that weakened the conservative President Zia-ul-Haq. The country&#x27;s major urban music media centres saw a quiet but certain outpouring of brand new rock bands who wanted to sound somewhat different from the time&#x27;s top pop-rock scions. Around 1985–87, the band gained national recognition and was offered a music video, by Rana Kanwal who was a producer at the PTV Studio. For PTV Studios, the bands had gone head-to-head into a competition for whoever made the best video, and the winner would play on all the networks across Pakistan. She called Rohail Hyatt and asked the band to compose the classical poem of Parveen Shakir into a rock music video. But unlike their other young contemporaries, Vital Signs performances included ambitious and bold cover songs of famous western bands like Pink Floyd, Rush and a-ha, apart from the usual popular Pakistani film-pop music at that time. In 1987, the band released its first single &quot;Do Pal Ka Jeevan&quot;, which became an ultimate success and the band built its reputation in Pakistan&#x27;s underground music industry.

===Breakthrough era (1989–1991)===
The success of their first single made Vital Signs much more popular, and they were soon discovered by famous PTV music producer and film director Shoaib Mansoor at the local concert, who was impressed with Vital Signs&#x27; &quot;Do Pal Ka Jeevan&quot; single. The next day, Mansoor called the band and asked them to do a national song which would go on-air all over the country. Written by Shoaib Mansoor and composed by Hyatt, the song which was named &quot;Dil Dil Pakistan&quot; became a huge success, much shocking Hyatt. It was released in the summer of 1987 as a video directed by Shoaib Mansoor, in which the Vital Signs are shown singing the song over what looked like the lush hills of Islamabad. It was an instant hit and later was voted as the third most popular song of all time by BBC World. However, the allure of instant success and the amount of interest Shoaib was ready to invest in the band kept Rohail and Shahzad going and convinced Junaid to hang around for at least the recording of their first album. The band lead guitarist, Nusrat Hussain, left the band and suggested Rohail Hyatt to bring Salman Ahmad as his replacement.

Inspired by a song in Rush&#x27;s album &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, Nusrat Hussain initially composed music for the guitar in the song, but was rejected by Shoaib Mansoor at the first draft as he wanted it to be catchier. Nusrat gave it another go and came up with an intro that was appreciated by the other members. Encouraged by it, especially by Junaid Jamshed, they provided their own inputs and ideas until they completed the tune, Shoaib approved it, and Hyatt composed the music and recorded it.

Shoaib&#x27;s clout got EMI Pakistan studio interested in helping the band record their debut album. This saw Rohail, Junaid and Shahzad traveling to Karachi. The album was recorded at EMI&#x27;s studio, but almost all of it was written and composed at Salman Ahmad&#x27;s residence where the band had been lodged. Shoaib did all the lyrics while Junaid and Rohail composed the songs.

===Continued success (1989–1992)===
With the release of their first major single, Vital Signs began to achieve recognition in Pakistan. Their debut album, &quot;Vital Signs 1&quot;, was a success leading a wave of fresh new acts in the country. Most of the new acts were part of the many &quot;youth festivals&quot; that began to do the rounds in Karachi and Lahore, especially after one such show was specially conducted and televised by PTV in late 1989.

Shoaib Mansoor also directed a mini-drama, &quot;Dhundle Raste&quot;, about the true story of the band, in which the band members acted as themselves. The band soon went on a tour throughout the country, playing sell-out concerts in Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad and Peshawar. Some of these, especially the two concerts held in Karachi in late 1989, were among the best concerts by the band.

Salman Ahmad wanted a change in the band&#x27;s music and by the time the band was approached by Pepsi in December 1990, Rohail decided to isolate Salman from the band and thus he left to form his own band, Junoon. Pressured by Pepsi to come out with a brand new album, the band then replaced Salman with Rizwan-ul-Haq as their new lead guitarist.

In 1991, the band released their second album &quot;Vital Signs 2&quot;. The album was a departure from the first album&#x27;s more upbeat ways. The resulting sound emerging from such emotional turmoil and uncertainty was heavily melancholic and introverted (&quot;Rahi&quot;, &quot;Yaad Kerna&quot;), suddenly jumping towards thumping anger with the powerful, &quot;Aisa Na Ho&quot;. This was perhaps the most political album by the band. The album had more maturity, versatility and was a commercial success. This led the band to perform in the United States on a tour, thus making them the first pop act to do so. The tour also changed the way the band looked, and the band saw the emergence of grunge and a revival of interest in &#x27;70s music, and became instigators of fashion. The change also saw Rohail, Shahzad and Junaid moving to Karachi (Rizwan decided to stay back in Islamabad), as Rohail started constructing a brand new studio in his Karachi apartment.

After performing a number of concerts managed by Rohail&#x27;s elder brother Zahid, the group headed out with director Shoaib Mansoor to film &quot;Guitar &#x27;93&quot;, a Pepsi-financed venture featuring videos shot all across Pakistan.

=== &quot;Aetibar and Greatest Hits&quot; (1993–1995) ===

After the departure of Salman Ahmad, Hyatt&#x27;s childhood friend Rizwan-ul-Haq was asked to join the band as lead guitarist. Rizwan, an electrical engineer, left Islamabad for Karachi to join the band and the Signs began work on their third album in Rohail Hyatt&#x27;s studios, Pyramid Studios, in 1993. The third album &quot;Aitebar&quot;, which soon outsold its predecessor, &quot;Vital Signs 2&quot;, was an ultimate success. The Signs then started their nationwide tour and collaborated with Shoaib Mansoor who directed &quot;&quot;Guitar &#x27;93&quot;, a compilation of videos of Vital Signs&#x27; biggest hits thus far. It shot across the four provinces and was financed by Pepsi Pakistan Inc. Made for PTV, &quot;Guitar &#x27;93&quot; was an entertaining document of the band&#x27;s progress as one of the best pop/rock acts in Pakistan.

With the release of &quot;Guitar&#x27;93&quot;, it was Rizwan who gained a lot of publicity and notability, and Signs also played their highest number of concerts in 1993. The biggest took place at the KMC Stadium in Karachi, a mega-concert headlined by the Signs and also consisting of performances from The Milestones, Awaz and the newly formed rock band, &quot;Arsh&quot;. Former member Salman Ahmad was present in the audience. It was after this concert Rohail first started to show signs of agitation regarding his growing dissatisfaction with Rizwan-ul-Haq&#x27;s playing and his expenses. The success of &quot;Aetibar&quot; and &quot;Guitar&#x27;93&quot; marked a great opportunity for Signs. The Signs marked its first international tour to US in 1993, becoming the first Pakistan musical act to do so.

===&quot;Hum Tum&quot; (1995) and world tours===

In 1994, the band did not extend the contract for its guitarist, Rizwan-ul-Haq, despite his urgings. Rizwan was relieved and &quot;shown the door&quot; after which Hyatt chose technical guitar whiz Aamir Zaki to become the band&#x27;s new lead guitarist.

The Signs made its second tour to the United States with Zaki on board as the band&#x27;s lead guitarist. Soon returning, the band started to work on their fourth and final installment, &quot;Hum Tum&quot;. Zaki was given the impression he was joining the band as a full member, not a session player, but was asked to leave after recording just three songs of the album. In a book, &quot;Personal Biography&quot; on Signs published online, Zaki had serious disagreement with the band leader, Hyatt, on the direction the band was taking. Hyatt later stated that the predominant reason was because Aamir Zaki had criticized David Gilmour&#x27;s guitar-playing while the band was touring the UK and attending a Pink Floyd concert. Hyatt famously quoted: &quot;That&#x27;s ridiculous! That&#x27;s one person&#x27;s (Aamir&#x27;s) opinion. You don&#x27;t fight or drop out of bands because of that.&quot; Following the departure of Zaki, the Signs quickly hired Awaz band member, Asad Ahmed, as the band&#x27;s lead guitarist who would play at the UK concerts. In a turmoil situation, Hyatt soon left the Signs clashing with lead singer Junaid and bassist Shahi over a contractual obligation the band had for a series of concerts in the US, after Zaki joined the Signs for a US tour. Rohail Hyatt then also went on to start a music magazine called &quot;Vibes&quot;.

===Upheaval and break-up in 1998===

While on the US and UK tour, the Signs felt the need of Hyatt; therefore upon returning to Pakistan, the band quickly reconciled with Hyatt, and fired Zaki. Ahmad joined the band and played guitar for the rest of the pending album, with Hyatt on keyboards. For the fourth album, the Signs collaborated with Shoaib Mansoor; all of the songs were written by Mansoor and sung by Jamshed.

Finally in 1995, the Signs released &quot;Hum Tum&quot; which gained positive response from the country&#x27;s electronic media. According to the music critics, the music mood on &quot;Hum Tum&quot; was somber, but more stoic and fatalistic, with Junaid&#x27;s brilliantly vocals and Shoaib Mansoor&#x27;s words of fatalistic resignation in the album. In spite of its success, the Signs faced competition when the media constantly compared the Vital Signs to &quot;Junoon&quot;, led by rival and former guitarist Salman Ahmad.

The aesthetic and commercial success of the album wasn&#x27;t enough as Rohail and Shahzad were ideologically and aesthetically drifting away from Juniad Jamshed and Shoaib Mansoor. The Signs struggled to keep itself united when the Signs toured to South Africa without its band leader Hyatt. The media then quickly speculated about the break-up of the band as early as 1996. Though Hyatt joined the Signs in 1997, the Signs made its final tour in the UK.

Though the band&#x27;s demise was never officially announced, by 1998 when the Signs were offered a deal by Pepsi Pakistan Inc. for another album, Rohail declined, signaling the end of Vital Signs. Junaid Jamshed went on to pursue a career as a solo singer, and Shahzad Hasan concentrated on his work as a music producer with Rohail Hyatt who formed a production company, known as &quot;Pyramid Productions&quot;.

==After years==

===&quot;VS-Remixes&quot; release in 1999===

In 1999, Rohail Hyatt released the collection of the Signs album songs, mixed with music remixes. The &quot;VS-Remixes&quot; received negative reception from its music journalists, though interested in the idea. The &quot;VS-Remixes&quot; album&#x27;s only one single, &quot;Maula&quot;, which was the only original piece, escaped mediocrity and garnered positive marks. &quot;Maula&quot;, a patriotic song, became an ultimate success and the song received a lot of appraisal from the music journalists.

===Reunion in 2002 Nazia Hassan concert===

The Signs confirmed their participation in a &quot;Nazia Hassan Tribute Concert&quot; to be held in Karachi on 9 March 2002. Popularly known as &quot;Queen of Pakistan Pop music&quot;, Nazia Hassan tragically died of lung cancer in London, shocking the entire country. The Signs sang their popular songs for the first time in almost 7 years. The concert was attended by an enthusiastic audience and it was their original line-up which went up on stage, a line-up that hadn&#x27;t played together ever since mid-1990, and who still stole the show.

The Vital Signs reunited for a nostalgic 30-minute stint at the high-profile concert. The band realized that a whole new generation of pop fans had grown up and their brand of pop music is still well remembered. After the Nazia Tribute Concert, the pop industry was rife with speculations that the Vital Signs were set to record their long-awaited fifth album, but these speculations were denied by the band.

===2013 collaboration===

After eleven long years, the members of Vital Signs and Junoon collaborated to release a patriotic song, &quot;Naya Pakistan&quot;. Written by Salman Ahmad and Aania Shah featuring Shahzad Hassan on bass guitar, Nusrat Hussain on keyboards, and vocalist Junaid Jamshed. The song was recorded at Indus Music World Studios and released on 22 February 2013.

Salman Ahmed while talking about his latest project at BBC Pakistan said, &quot;For almost a decade, Junaid has always asked me not to bring guitar or to ask him to sing. When you are friends with somebody you always have to transcend differences and I respect Junaid&#x27;s views. Junaid once told me that his biggest regret was not to be a part of Jazba Junoon&#x27;s recording. So when we came up with &quot;Naya Pakistan&quot;, I asked him that this is the chance that&#x27;s not going to come again so finally Junaid accepted the offer with the condition that he will sing only the opening lines with no music at all.&quot; and further added &quot;it signifies the metaphor for unity as we have to compromise for unity in hope of &quot;Naya Pakistan&quot;.&quot;

==Musical style==
Vital Signs were most heavily influenced by Pink Floyd. Musically and lyrically, they have also cited bands such as a-ha, Rush, Scorpions, Duran Duran, Survivor, Radiohead, The Police and Led Zeppelin as their major influences. They were also widely known as Pakistan&#x27;s first and most successful pop band and were given the title of &quot;pioneers of pop music&quot;.

Several bands and artists have cited Vital Signs as an influence or inspiration, including Abbas Ali Khan, Atif Aslam, Jal, Kaavish, Aaroh, SYMT and Fuzön.

==Cultural legacy and influence==

The Vital Signs emerged when Pakistan was undergoing Islamization. Such Western ideas were denounced in the country, and the film industry was quickly declining in competition with the counterrevolution of the Indian film industry. According to the editorial written in &quot;The Express Tribune&quot; in 2011, the &quot;Vital Signs and Pakistan&#x27;s ingenious rock music was the only &quot;arsenal&quot; the country had against India&#x27;s encroaching entertainment industry.&quot;

In a short span of time, the members of Vital Signs gained enormous popularity and were generally welcomed by the public; sometimes named the Beatles of Pakistan. Whilst Noor Jehan, Abida Parveen, Mehdi Hassan, Salma Agha, and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan remained mostly attached to Pakistan&#x27;s film industry, the Vital Signs reached out to the regional and young population of the country. With the rise of Vital Signs and later, Junoon and others, the rock music exploded in the 1990s to become a vehicle for expressing patriotic nationalist spirit in Pakistan. According to the biographers of Vital Signs, despite the Western looks and influence of the Vital Signs, all of the members of Vital Signs were treated like country&#x27;s most &quot;beloved celebrities&quot;.

According to the cultural critics and observers, all of the members of Vital Signs had become what members of The Beatles had become in the United States and the United Kingdom during the 1960s. Vital Signs were followed by Junoon, Awaz, Strings, and Jupiters, which all of whom had exploded the pop and rock music genre in the country, bringing the significant shift of the country&#x27;s transformation into modernism during the 1990s. Undoubtedly, Vital Signs&#x27; music has been one major influential force which has truly kept the national spirits high amidst the prevailing social woes which have worsened since the 1980s; such music included songs like &quot;Dil Dil Pakistan&quot; and many more.

<text>Karl Samuel Leberecht Hermann (20 January 1765 – 1 September 1846) was a German chemist who helped discover cadmium  in 1817.

Cadmium was discovered in 1817 by a physician, Friedrich Stromeyer (1776–1835). The element was first found in the condensation of vapors (mixed with soot and zinc oxide) that rose out of a furnace in which zinc oxide was being roasted. Cadmium’s discovery is also loosely attributed to K.S.L. Hermann and J.C.H. Roloff who may have found cadmium in zinc oxide during the same year. A historical debate still remains as to who actually discovered the pure form of the element first. 
The phase of scientific history in which Stromeyer was active was one in which chemical discovery was being accomplished primarily by pharmacists, apothecaries and physicians. The practice of alchemy was dying out, and chemistry was just beginning to emerge as a separate science. Stromeyer, a professor at the University of Göttingen, was testing zinc oxide, a medicine in those days, for purity.

The name of the element was derived from the Latin “cadmia” and the Greek “kadmeia,” both ancient names for calamine (zinc carbonate).

<doc id="1267563" wikidata="Q7720380" url="?curid=1267563" title="The Brothers Grunt">
<text>The Brothers Grunt is an adult animated comedy television series, and the earliest series made by &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; creator Danny Antonucci. It originally aired from August 15, 1994, to April 9, 1995, on MTV. It centers on five humanoids, named Frank, Tony, Bing, Dean and Sammy, who are in search of their lost brother Perry.

The series had a short run and was met with a generally negative reception, with many considering it one of the worst animated TV shows ever made.

==Overview==

===Premise===
The series centered on an ensemble cast of pale, rubbery, twitchy, yellow-eyed, blue-haired, green-tongued and shirtless humanoids called &quot;The Brothers Grunt&quot; or simply &quot;The Grunts&quot; with prominent bulging varicose veins, generally clumsy and dim-witted, able to bend, twist and contort their bodies into various forms, all of them ostensibly male, wandering around in their signature attire of boxers and wingtip shoes. Their main food staple is cheese and martinis; nevertheless, they are able to eat other foods (at least potatoes, according to the episode &quot;Not My Potato&quot;). 

The Grunt&#x27;s single parent is a large, floating, mute and fat male humanoid called Gruntus Primus Maximus or simply &quot;The Maximus&quot;, often leaking various noxious bodily fluids, to whom they are born as embryos inside skin warts, much in the way of the common Surinam toad. They live in a monastery in an unspecified location in the American wilderness, which the sewers lead to.

A group is formed, composed of five of a group of sextuplets born from the Maximus in a rare occurrence, in a quest to bring back their sixth brother, Perry, who has abandoned his involuntary position of &quot;Chosen One&quot; (leader of their order) and is now living the &quot;high life&quot; among human beings (who seem to deal with the bizarre nature of the Grunts by ignoring them and pretending everything is normal).

Due to the Grunts being practically silent characters, whose speech mostly consists of grunts with occasional subtitles (hence the name), most of the humor relies on physical comedy, particularly the Grunts enduring heaps of physical abuse.&lt;br&gt;In music video segments that are intervened with some episodes, supervised by Kathy Karp, there are additional animated portions of the main characters grunting.

===Lore===
As shown in the episode &quot;Grunt Moments in History&quot;, Grunts&#x27; earliest known ancestor was a pale, veiny hippo-like creature called the Gruntus Not Quite Us, which can be presumed to be a relative of the Gruntus Primus Maximus as it is shown birthing Grunts from its back. A prehistoric Grunt called the Neandergrunt had invented the cocktail glass using a cone-shaped bone. An influential Grunt named The 5th of Kevin was born centuries later. While the others fell off the Gruntus Primus Maximus at birth, Kevin remained and lived on the body of the Maximus his whole life. He built the monastery as a safehaven to protect his fellow Grunts, including the Maximus, from human persecution. The Brothers Grunt are therefore not only religious brothers, but biological brothers as well. Not much is known about the Grunt religion (itself seemingly a spoof on Catholicism due to the brown monk&#x27;s habit worn by the brothers on occasion) other than that it involves the almost monomaniacal reverence, production and eating of cheese, as well as a variety of bizarre rituals overseen by the Gruntus Poobah. As shown in the episode &quot;The Filling of the Shorts&quot;, the Grunts&#x27; trademark boxer shorts, invented by Brother Wayne, contain massive amounts of cheese stored in some sort of hammerspace pocket.

A sporting event is held on occasion called the Grunt Games, as shown in the episode of the same name, including such sports as necktie-folding, sumo, doing a clean and jerk using a giant cheese called the Great Dane before swallowing it whole, diving off the Maximus into a pool of melted cheese, throwing a giant olive into a sandwich, and a relay race involving assembling a martini.

===Characters===
The main characters were named after famous crooners of the 1950s: Frank (Sinatra), Tony (Bennett), Bing (Crosby), Dean (Martin), Sammy (Davis Jr.), and Perry (Como), all voiced by Doug Parker. They are sextuplets, all born from the same wart on the Maximus&#x27; skin, a rare occurrence among Grunts.

====Main====
* Perry – a hunchbacked Grunt who became the chosen one in the pilot episode, but escapes due to the pressure of such a title.
* Frank – constantly bites his lips and cares the most about finding Perry.
* Tony – always faces upward due to his broken neck. In the episode &quot;Cream Style Tony&quot; he becomes popular for speaking his first English word, &quot;corn&quot;.
* Bing – the largest of the brothers. Appears the least often and might have been killed off in the episode &quot;To Hell With Bing&quot;.
* Dean – smiles constantly and is the most easily distracted of the brothers.
* Sammy – a Grunt who puckers his lips due to his lack of teeth and is in love with a lamp.

====Major====
* The Detective – (Doug Parker) The series&#x27; main antagonist. A balding police detective who chases down the Grunts in a multi-episode story arc after Frank was arrested for swallowing a microphone. He believes the Grunts are insane (unaware that they are not human and have a distinct society) and is often accused of being insane himself. After visiting places the Grunts had been to before in previous episodes, he finds the monastery and is invited inside. It is unknown what happened after this, but it is known he came out alive and is still investigating the Grunts. He is rarely seen without his coffee mug and occasionally wears a chicken suit.
* Gruntus Poobah – (Doug Parker) The leader of the brotherhood of grunt, he serves as the show&#x27;s host and explains the plot before each episode. He also appears often in flashbacks and hallucinations when the grunts are in a situation, giving them advice. He is the only Grunt shown speaking perfect English. He was once a famous poet in the human world who read poems to a beatnik audience, as shown in the episode &quot;Poobah Blues&quot;.
* Ringo – the Poobah&#x27;s mute Middle Eastern assistant who has to carry him around on his back due to his grotesque obesity. He is the only human present in the Grunt Monastery other than formerly Vince. He also gives the Poobah massages and, as shown in the unaired episode &quot;Black Balled Grunt&quot;, acts as his muscle.
* The Dıflash Queen&#x27;s İgnam lamp – (Jennifer Wilson) A Turkish lamp who becomes Sammy&#x27;s girlfriend and an honorary member of the Grunts&#x27; traveling party in search of Perry.
* The Gruntus Primus Maximus – (Doug Parker) Otherwise known simply as &quot;The Maximus&quot;, he is a floating fat and mute giant and the male parent of the Grunts. All Grunts are born or hatched from warts on his back. The Poobah attends to him, helping him birth more Grunts and feeding him cheese. Being the single parent of the Grunts, he is also the subject of a &quot;Yo mama&quot; joke in the episode &quot;Black Balled Grunt&quot;, specifically &quot;your Maximus wears tennis shoes&quot;.
* The Dıflash Queen – (Jennifer Wilson) A Turkish Queen that appeared in the episode &quot;Scrub Me Sammy&quot;.
* The Fifth of Kevin – (Doug Parker) The founder of the Grunt civilization who appeared in the episode &quot;Grunt Moments in History&quot;.
* The Smein – (Doug Parker) A Nazi German skunk that appears in the lost episode &quot;Hunt for Grunts&quot;.
* Krischmäßante – (Doug Parker) The Smein&#x27;s best friend skunk.
* Santa Claus (St. Nicholas or especially Kris Kringle) – (Doug Parker) A present-bringer that appears in the lost episode &quot;The Grunts Who Came for Turkey&quot;.
* Vince – (Doug Parker) A human who was raised in the Grunt Monastery that appeared in the unaired episode &quot;Hunt for Grunts&quot;. He showed repeated hostility towards the Grunts, even giving them tofu instead of cheese as a prank, and even attempted to lead the Grunts in a coup against the Poobah, until he was finally banished from the monastery.

The characters that would become The Brothers Grunt were first seen in one of MTV&#x27;s numerous 30-second promos. This particular promo consisted of close-up shots of the then-unnamed character&#x27;s faces who seemed to be straining to do something (veins in their heads would bulge, the characters would squint and grunt) until the scene cut to the MTV logo landing in a pool of sludge followed by a satisfied &quot;Ahhhhh&quot; (suggesting that the characters were suffering from constipation and the MTV logo was the &#x27;turd&#x27; as it were). It is unclear when this promo aired if the storyline and characters for &quot;The Brothers Grunt&quot; had been developed already or if it had been developed into its own show after the success of the promo, in the wake of &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;.

==Episodes==
Note: &quot;All episodes directed by Danny Antonucci&quot;

===Unreleased episodes===
These episodes are unreleased, but have been uploaded to YouTube in June 2019 by YouTube user Oecobius33. Three of these episodes might have been produced, but are currently unconfirmed.
==Production==
The show&#x27;s origins can be traced back to 1993 when the MTV ad &quot;Grunt MTV&quot; aired. At the time Danny Antonucci had animated several MTV ads to find work outside of International Rocketship Ltd., who he had worked for since 1984. Although Danny enjoyed the success of &quot;Lupo The Butcher&quot;, he wanted to leave International Rocketship Ltd. and start his own animation company. The result was a.k.a. Cartoon, which began on April 1, 1994. The studio began as a way to locate his work for &quot;The Brothers Grunt&quot; after MTV executive Abby Terkhule liked his MTV ad so much, he asked him to turn it into a television series. In production order, each episode of the show would consist of three to four segments.

== Release ==
==Reception==
&quot;The Brothers Grunt&quot; had a short run and was met with generally negative reception from critics. Kenneth R. Clark of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said that, with the series, MTV &quot;created the most repulsive creatures ever to show up on a television screen&quot; and &quot;accomplished the seemingly impossible.&quot; Charles Solomon of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the show &quot;an effortful, sophomoric half-hour that leaves the viewer longing for the refined good taste of Alice Cooper.&quot; In their book &quot;North of Everything: English-Canadian Cinema Since 1980&quot;, William Beard and Jerry White called the series a &quot;failure&quot;.

===Comparison to &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot;===
The show was often compared to &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot;, an animated series that aired on MTV&#x27;s sister channel, Nickelodeon. Gábor Csupó, co-creator of &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot;, rejected these comparisons, claiming that his show was more character-driven, while &quot;The Brothers Grunt&quot; was an idea-driven series, also pointing out that both shows have different visual styles. When looking back on the series, creator Danny Antonucci stated that the series &quot;didn&#x27;t really do too well&quot;, also saying that the show has since become MTV&#x27;s &quot;dirty little secret&quot;.

== Other media ==

=== Merchandise ===
Fleer released in 1995 trading cards based on the series, as part of the MTV Animation Fleer&#x27;s Ultra set. The show&#x27;s theme song, written by Brendan Dolan and Geoff Whelan, was featured in &quot; Television&#x27;s Greatest Hits: Volume 7&quot;, which was released in 1996 by TVT Records&#x27; soundtrack imprint, TVT SOUNDTRAX.

There were also few tshirts, boxer shorts, socks and calendars sold to promote the show between 1994 and 1995.

<text>St Just (), also known as St Just in Penwith, is a town and civil parish in the Penwith district of Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It lies along the B3306 road which connects St Ives to the A30 road. The parish encompasses the town of St Just and the nearby settlements of Trewellard, Pendeen and Kelynack: it is bounded by the parishes of Morvah to the north-east, Sancreed and Madron to the east, St Buryan and Sennen to the south and by the sea in the west. The parish consists of of land, of water and of foreshore. The town of St Just is the most westerly town in mainland Britain and is situated approximately west of Penzance along the A3071. St Just parish, which includes Pendeen and the surrounding area, has a population of 4,637 (2011 census). An electoral ward of the same name also exists: the population of this ward at the same census was 4,812.

St Just lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). St Just is one of only two towns included within the Cornwall AONB.

==History==
The identity of Saint Just is not known. Cornwall&#x27;s long resistance to the edicts of Canterbury and Rome makes it most unlikely that the saint was Archbishop Justus of Canterbury, as some sources claim. Another possibility is the 6th- or 7th-century Saint Iestyn, who is said to have been the son of Geraint ab Erbin, a ruler of Dumnonia. In 1478 William of Worcester found that the church was believed to contain the bones of Justus of Trieste.

Among the prehistoric antiquities nearby is Ballowall Barrow, a chambered tomb. St Just is one of the most ancient mining districts in Cornwall, and remains of ancient pre-industrial and more modern mining activity have had a considerable impact on the nearby landscape.

Bosworlas, in St Just parish, was said by Henry Jenner to have been named as after Gorlois, the legendary duke of Cornwall, who he believed was a real fifth or sixth century figure, either a petty chief and vassal of the Royal House of Dumnonia, or of the line of the original chiefs of the Dumnonii if the kings of Dumnonia were the leaders of the Britons displaced by the Saxons. He notes its closeness to Bosigran , Gorlois&#x27;s wife in Arthurian legend.

===Churches and schools===
The parish church of St Just is a fine 15th-century building. In 1336 the church was rebuilt and dedicated by John Grandisson, Bishop of Exeter; however only the chancel of this church survives and the nave and aisles are 15th-century in date. There are two Methodist chapels.

St Just is the home of Cape Cornwall School which also serves Sennen, Sancreed, Pendeen, St Buryan and other places in the district.

There are eight Cornish crosses in the parish; there are two in the vicarage garden and one built into the church wall. Other crosses are at Leswidden, Nanquidno, Kenidjack (two) and Cot Valley. Boslow Cross is 550 yds (500 m) NW of Boslow Farm (ref. no. 1003110).

===Mining===
The ancient settlement has a strong mining history and was during the 19th century one of the most important mining districts in Cornwall both for copper and for tin. Mines within the area included Boscaswell Downs, Balleswidden, Parknoweth, Boscean, Wheal Owles, Wheal Boys, Levant, Botallack and Geevor (which closed in 1990). Geevor mine is now a tourist attraction which allows visitors to explore Cornish Mining heritage. The boom in 19th-century mining saw a dramatic increase in the population of St Just, the 1861 census records the population figure as being 9,290; however, like other areas in Cornwall the population declined with the collapse in the tin trade in the 19th century. The town also suffered from the decision of the Great Western Railway to abandon its plans to make St Just the terminus of the London mainline to Cornwall. It was announced in July 2006 that the St Just mining district and the rest of the historic mining areas of Cornwall had become the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Site.

==Geography==
The nearby Cot Valley has a stream which runs to the sea. The area has been heavily mined, as was the area around St Just. The round boulders in the Cot Valley Cove here are of specific scientific interest. Also nearby is Cape Cornwall.

==Local government==

For the purposes of local government classification St Just is a town and elects a Mayor every 12 months from among the St Just Town Councillors. The St Just Town Council was created following the re-structuring of English Local Government in 1974, St Just having been an urban district council until then. Principal local government functions are now undertaken by Cornwall Council.

St Just was originally part of the Penzance Poor Law Union until 1894 when it was incorporated into the West Penwith Rural District. In 1897 St Just in Penwith parish formed the sole basis of St Just Urban District. In 1974 the urban district was included in Penwith District, until that was abolished in 2009. The Old Town Hall in St Just is a former drill hall.

==Culture and local traditions==
St Just is home to the popular Lafrowda festival a seven-day community and arts celebration usually held in mid July.
A more ancient celebration associated with the town is St Just Feast which is held every year to celebrate the dedication of the parish church on 13 July 1336. Feast celebrations were moved to the Sunday nearest to All Saints&#x27; Day in 1536 following an Act of Henry VIII which means it usually take place at the end of October / beginning of November. Feast itself is a two-day event with a church service and civic procession being held on Feast Sunday and a larger scale popular celebration being held on Feast Monday (which includes a meeting of the Western Hunt). A description of St Just Feast, from 1882, follows:
&quot;Rich and poor still at this season keep open house, and all the young people from St. Just who are in service for many miles around, if they can possibly be spared, go home on the Saturday and stay until the Tuesday morning. A small fair is held in the streets on Monday evening, when the young men are expected to treat their sweethearts liberally, and a great deal of &quot;foolish money&quot; that can be ill afforded is often spent&quot;

St Just also has a &#x27;Plen an Gwarry&#x27; (Cornish for &quot;playing place&quot;), locally pronounced &#x27;Plain an Gwarry&#x27;. These sites were used historically for Cornish wrestling, open-air performance, entertainment and instruction. St Just&#x27;s Plen an Gwarry occasionally hosts productions of the Cornish Ordinalia mystery plays. 

St Just has a healthy artistic scene, including the painter Kurt Jackson who has made several television appearances. Contemporary singer and comedian Jethro from nearby St Buryan played for St Just Rugby Club and has recorded a song entitled &quot;St Just&quot;.

The folk singer Martha Tilston released an album in 2010 called &quot;Lucy and the Wolves&quot;. This features a range of songs inspired by Cornwall. The first song on the album is called &quot;The Cape&quot; and is based upon Cape Cornwall in St Just. She has performed in Penzance a number of times and now lives in Penwith.

The children&#x27;s animated television series &quot;Jungle Junction&quot; is produced by Spider Eye Productions of St. Just.

The local community radio station is Coast FM (formerly Penwith Radio), which broadcasts on 96.5 and 97.2 FM.

The Star Inn is sometimes called the last proper pub in Cornwall. Its clientele includes bird watchers who are attracted by the local wildlife.

===Cornish wrestling===
The St Just Plen an Gwari was specifically used for Cornish wrestling tournaments both traditionally and more recently.

James Warren (1786-?) from St Just was a very famous Cornish wrestler, who became champion of Cornwall. He fought in tournaments throughout Britain, including London. He was known as &#x27;Little Jem Warren&#x27; or &#x27;Little Hercules&#x27; due to being 5 feet 7.5 inches high or &#x27;Great Jem&#x27; from having prodigious strength. He distinguished himself in the rescue of survivors when the East Indiaman ship, &quot;Kent&quot; caught fire.

Thomas White from St Just was the original trainer of Jack Carkeek, in the US, who became world Cornish wrestling champion.

==Sport and Leisure==

==Twinning==
St Just is twinned with Huelgoat, Bro-Gernev, Brittany. The town is also twinned, in partnership with Penzance, with Bendigo in the State of Victoria, Australia and with Nevada City in California, USA as a result of the historical links through the many people from the area who emigrated to the two destinations, mostly in the late 19th century, to find a better life in the mines there. There is still an area of Bendigo known as St. Just Point.

<text>Sir Michael Myers (7 September 1873 – 8 April 1950), also known as Mickey Myers, was the sixth Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New Zealand from 1929 to 1946 and served occasionally as Administrator of New Zealand from 1930 to 1941. He was the first Jew to hold this position. He sat on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 1936.

Born in Motueka, Myers was educated at Thorndon School and Wellington College, and gained his LLB from Canterbury College in 1897. Afterwards he was admitted to the Inner Temple.

Myers lived in Wellington. He went to the 1945 San Francisco conference that produced the United Nations, and participated in the drafting of the constitution of the International Court of Justice. He resigned on 6 September 1945, but was reappointed for one year, and then resigned on 7 August 1946. Myers died in Wellington in 1950, aged 76. He had been made King&#x27;s Counsel in 1922, Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1930 New Year Honours, and promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1937 Coronation Honours.

==Family==
On 2 August 1899 he married Estelle Miriam Salom (24 February 1876 – 11 May 1960), daughter of Maurice Salom, MLC of Adelaide, South Australia. There were two sons: Maurice Salom Myers (1900–1986) and Geoffrey Alexander Myers (1908–2002). Myer&#x27;s sister Phoebe Myers was a notable educationalist, who represented New Zealand at the League of Nations in 1929.

He has served as the UN Goodwill Ambassador for HIV/AIDS Programme towards spreading awareness about HIV in South Asia. While working with the Pakistan&#x27;s media to help initiate peace between India and Pakistan, Ahmad continues to produce documentaries and solo guitar albums. At present, he is serving tenured professor at the Queens College of the City University of New York. With Junoon band being disintegrated, Salman Ahmad continues to perform as a solo artist under the &quot;Junoon&quot; label and has moved to New York and released one album as a solo artist, &quot;Infiniti&quot; in 2005.

==Early life==
Salman Ahmad spent his childhood in Pakistan and was educated at Aitchison College, before moving to New York when his father got a job in the airline industry. Ahmad then attended middle and high school in the United States, where he was first exposed to rock music at a Led Zeppelin concert at Madison Square Garden and later to Van Halen band. Motivated to become a musician, he began learning the guitar against his parents wishes. After graduation, he returned to Pakistan in order to attend medical school. However, due to vast changes in the political climate and the advent of extremism, Ahmad&#x27;s guitar playing was repressed. He took action by playing at covert talent shows, unfazed by criticism and even death threats from extremists. These underground performances and the consequent censorship set the stage for him to become a peace advocate and eventually ending up founding the rock bands Junoon and Vital Signs.

==Music career==
He has been teaching a class on music titled &quot;Islamic Music and Culture of South Asia&quot;, as a guest faculty at Queens College. This year, he started his second semester as a guest faculty.
On 1 March 2008, Ahmad performed with Yale Strom (a world leading Klezmer artist) at Temple Beth Sholom in Roslyn Heights as part of another &quot;Common Chords II&quot; concert celebrating Muslim and Jewish Music. Together with Strom, Ahmad leads the multi-faith ensemble Common Chords, whose members include Chatterjee, dhol player Sunny Jain, bassist Mark Dresser, vocalist Elizabeth Schwartz and others. In 2016, his new song &quot;Kaise Bolun&quot; from an upcoming Bollywood movie &quot;Rhythm&quot; starring Adeel Chaudhry has received enormous negative feedback from his fans on social media through showing their discomfort over song&#x27;s music and video. According to people, they never expected such kind of music from legendary Salman Ahmad.

=== Nobel Peace Prize concert in Norway ===
Televised in around 100 countries, Ahmad and his band Junoon performed with artists from all over the world at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway, on 11 December 2007. He also played at the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony on 9 December 2007, where he was joined by tabla virtuoso Pandit Samir Chatterjee.

===Censorship on Junoon===
Ahmad and his band Junoon suffered political censorship in Pakistan during the administration of Benazir Bhutto in the 1990s, partly due to a song denouncing political corruption. In 1998 during the administration of Nawaz Sharif, Junoon was again banned in Pakistan, because they protested against the nuclear power tests in India as well as their own country by saying, &quot;Why escalate the arms race when people still need water? Why see our neighbors as enemies when we are so close to each other?&quot;.

Ahmad played at the Roskilde Festival in 2000 under the banner of &#x27;Freemuse&#x27;, just a couple of years after the ban. As a musician who faced censorship in his home country, Ahmad says that &quot;there is no conflict between my faith and my music, you can be a Muslim and play electric guitar&quot;.

In 2006, during a Freemuse conference in Beirut, he was part of one of the rare occasions where music and religion were taken seriously and discussions on music and Islam focused on theology and not just social and cultural patterns. About this he said, &quot;I&#x27;ve taken part in Freemuse dialogue meetings and press meetings. They have always been great meeting places for musicians, researchers and journalists and I&#x27;ve always felt that understanding the motivations behind and the mechanisms of censorship have been in focus – not just condemning censorship. Having said that, we, the artists, should always be ready to defend our colleagues when the rights to freedom of expression are attacked, and thus we need an organisation such as Freemuse to help us do this&quot;.

== Other work ==

=== Acting ===
Ahmad has acted in television dramas.
* &quot;Dhundle Raste&quot; (Featured Vital Signs band)
* &quot;Aahat&quot;
* &quot;Talaash&quot; (Featured Junoon band)
* &quot; Gulls and Guys ( Documentary cum travel reality show)

The HBO documentary &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; features the original song &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;, composed by Salman Ahmad with vocals from Peter Gabriel.

=== Writing ===
Salman Ahmad published an autobiographical work titled &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Jihad: A Muslim Rock Star&#x27;s Revolution&quot; in January 2010, was published by Simon &amp; Schuster.

=== Social work ===
In 2009, Ahmad and his wife Samina were involved in raising money for Swat&#x27;s Internally displaced persons.

As a UNAIDS Goodwill ambassador, he worked to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS. Ahmad while opening the first dialogue with young people at IX International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific&#x27;s (ICAAP) Community Dialogue Space in 2009 said, &quot;Young people need to be on board to turn the tide, as it is their decision-making over their bodies and their sexuality that will determine their future status&quot;.

=== Politics ===
Salman Ahmad has been often seen at Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf&#x27;s (tr. Pakistan Justice Party; simply known as PTI) rallies which is founded by cricketer-turned politician Imran Khan. Salman Ahmad sings patriotic and revolutionary songs in these rallies which revitalizes the whole environment, he is often alleged as being a member of the party as well. 

In October 2016, Salman Ahmad was taken into custody by Islamabad police along with various other PTI&#x27;s workers after the activists clashed with the law enforcement officers in Rawalpindi.

In December 2024, his basic membership from PTI was cancelled following a notification arguing that Salman Ahmad had written &quot;unwarranted and scurrilous posts&quot; about the relatives of Imran Khan, and that he was &quot;sowing division and discontent&quot; among PTI members and sympathizers, the party eventually asking him to dissociate from the party in media appearances.

<text>Mathnet is a segment on the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Square One Television&quot; that follows the adventures of pairs of police mathematicians. It is a pastiche of &quot;Dragnet&quot;.

==Premise==
&quot;Mathnet&quot; is a pastiche of &quot;Dragnet&quot;, in which the main characters are mathematicians who use their mathematical skills to solve various crimes and mysteries in the city, usually thefts, burglaries, frauds, and kidnappings. Each segment of the series aired on one episode of &quot;Square One&quot;, a production of the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (CTW) aimed at teaching math skills to young viewers. Five segments made up an episode (one for each weekday), with suspense building at the end of each segment. Instead of guns, the detectives carry calculators.

==Characters==
* Kate Monday (Beverly Leech) – A pastiche of Jack Webb&#x27;s &quot;Dragnet&quot; character Joe Friday, Kate usually remains stoic when on the job and tackles almost every situation with a calm and rational mind. She appears in the first three seasons.
* George Frankly (Joe Howard) – The partner of Kate Monday (and later Pat Tuesday), George takes his job seriously but is frequently prone to fits of comical mishaps and immature reactions. He appears in all five seasons. He has a wife named Martha whom he often mentions but who is never seen or heard.
* Pat Tuesday (Toni DiBuono) – George&#x27;s second partner, appearing in Seasons 4 and 5 to replace Kate. Like Kate, Pat shares the deadpan mannerisms and no-nonsense attitude of Joe Friday.

===Los Angeles cast===
* Thad Green (James Earl Jones) – The chief of the Los Angeles Police Department. He briefly appears in Season 4.
* Debbie Williams (Mary Watson) – Technical analyst at the LAPD division where Kate and George works, she is frequently called upon to process data obtained during Mathnet investigations.

===New York City cast===
* Joe Greco (Emilio Del Pozo) – Captain of the New York City precinct, he is the man who George, Kate, and later Pat report to when they move to New York City starting in Season 3.
* Benny Pill (Bari K. Willerford) – An undercover NYPD officer, he is Mathnet&#x27;s semi-regular backup support.

==Guest stars==
A number of well-known actors and actresses made guest appearances on this show. Among them were:

*Bob Arbogast
*Julie Bennett
*Betty Buckley
*Maddie Corman
*Paul Dooley
*Jonathan Freeman
*Andre Gower
*Tammy Grimes
*Estelle Harris
*Billie Hayes
*John Michael Higgins
*Russell Johnson
*Henry Jones
*James Karen
*Wayne Knight
*Al Lewis
*Geoffrey Lewis
*Kenneth Mars
*Kevin McCarthy
*Eve McVeagh
*Jayne Meadows
*Lara Jill Miller
*Melba Moore
*John Moschitta Jr.
*Ron O&#x27;Neal
*Rex Reed
*Jack Riley

*Guy Stockwell
*Nedra Volz
*Marcia Wallace
*Dick Wilson
*William Windom
*Edward Winter
*&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic

In addition, real-life LAPD officers Sam Salazar and Steve Fellman appeared as themselves; head writers David D. Connell and Jim Thurman also appeared as various characters.

==Math and science==
Real principles of math and science and mathematical tools used by the detectives to solve crimes include:
* Alphanumerics (&quot;The Case of the Unnatural&quot;)
* Fibonacci sequence and modular arithmetic (see also Pisano period) (&quot;The Case of the Willing Parrot&quot;)
* Kinematics (&quot;The Problem of the Missing Baseball&quot;)
* Chromatic scale (&quot;The Problem of the Passing Parade&quot;)
* Displacement of fluids (&quot;The Problem of the Trojan Hamburger&quot;)
* Hamiltonian path (&quot;The Case of the Smart Dummy&quot;)
* Process of elimination (&quot;The Case of the Great Car Robbery&quot;, &quot;The View from the Rear Terrace&quot;)
* Number patterns (&quot;The Case of the Missing Air&quot;)
* Bar charts and line charts (&quot;The Case of the Purloined Policies&quot;, &quot;The Case of the Great Car Robbery&quot;)
* Triangulation (&quot;The Case of the Map With a Gap&quot;)

==Development and production==
After a successful first season, production began on six new episodes for the second season. By the time production ended on the third season and its six episodes in 1989, Beverly Leech (Kate Monday) left, and was replaced by a new character named Pat Tuesday, played by Toni DiBuono. Production on the first six episodes with the new character commenced in 1990, and ended in 1991, in time for &quot;Square One TV&#x27;s&quot; fourth season. Production on the final season and its five episodes began taping in 1991, and the last episode aired in 1992.

During production, the background music also changed. Originally, it had a synth score. Gradually, as the series progressed, it was replaced with an orchestral score.

The exterior shots of the Los Angeles police station were filmed at the former LAPD Highland Park Police Station, which had closed in 1983. It now houses the Los Angeles Police Museum and is located at 6045 York Boulevard.

The exterior shots of the New York City police station for seasons 3 and 4 were filmed at the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House in Lower Manhattan. It now houses the George Gustav Heye Center of the National Museum of the American Indian and is located at 1 Bowling Green. Exterior shots for the fifth and final season were filmed at the Brooklyn Borough Hall.

==Logo and motto==


The Mathnet logo is a pastiche of the Los Angeles city seal. The symbols representing the city were replaced with mathematics iconography. The founding date is the year the pilot episode was filmed.

The Mathnet motto &quot;to cogitate and to solve&quot; is a pastiche of the LAPD motto &quot;to protect and to serve.&quot;

At the conclusion of each episode, a title screen displays the Mathnet logo and motto against a blue background. The logo and motto were also featured on the doors of the police cars used in the Los Angeles episodes, mimicking the appearance of actual LAPD police cars.

Despite having their origins in Los Angeles, the show continued to use the logo and motto even after the setting of the show moved to New York City.

==Home media and syndication==

In 1991, GPN released five episodes from the first two seasons on VHS (&quot;The Problem of the Missing Baseball&quot;, &quot;The Trial of George Frankly&quot;, &quot;The Problem of the Dirty Money&quot;, &quot;The Case of the Missing Air&quot;, and &quot;The View from the Rear Terrace&quot;).

Around the same time, select PBS stations combined parts of an episode to air in primetime. This was done primarily for seasons 3-5 (New York City era), although at least one omnibus from the Leech era was also broadcast. These versions were re-edited so that they would come in at just under an hour long, featured other segments from &quot;Square One TV&quot; as &quot;commercials&quot;, and newly created end credits, among other differences. Two of the primetime airings were also commercially released as VHS tapes from Republic Pictures in 1994 (&quot;Despair in Monterey Bay&quot; (retitled to &quot;Treasure in Monterey Bay&quot;) and &quot;The Case of the Unnatural&quot;).

Both &quot;Mathnet&quot; and &quot;Square One&quot; went off the air in 1994 (it was rerun until then after the final 1992 season was completed), reappearing from 1999 to 2003 on the cable television network Noggin, a joint venture of Nickelodeon and CTW. However, only 65 episodes were leased by the Noggin network. &quot;Mathnet&quot; segments also aired on &quot;Phred on Your Head Show&quot; (one of Noggin&#x27;s original programs).

==Other media==
A &quot;Mathnet&quot; comic briefly appeared in &quot;3-2-1 Contact&quot; magazine.

Six &quot;Mathnet&quot; books, based on episodes of the show, were published:

# Casebook 1: The Case of the Unnatural (based on Season 4, Episode 1)
# Casebook 2: Despair in Monterey Bay (based on Season 4, Episode 2)
# Casebook 3: The Case of the Willing Parrot (based on Season 2, Episode 1)

<text>Reading Bridge is a road bridge over the River Thames at Reading in the English county of Berkshire. The bridge links the centre of Reading on the south bank with the Lower Caversham area of the cross-river suburb, and former village, of Caversham on the north bank. It crosses the river a short way above Caversham Lock.

The current bridge is the first on the site, and was opened on 3 October 1923. It has a single reinforced concrete main span of , which was, at the time of construction, the longest such span in the United Kingdom. There are also two side arches for footpaths. The span rises to a height of at the centre, giving a navigation clearance of . The bridge deck is wide and carries a wide carriageway and two flanking footways.

== History ==
Before the opening of Reading Bridge, the only road crossing between Reading and Caversham was at the Caversham Bridge site some upstream, which has accommodated a series of bridges since around the end of the 12th century. In later years, a narrow footbridge across the top of the weir at Caversham Lock, known locally as The Clappers, provided a supplementary pedestrian route, especially between the terraced housing of Lower Caversham and the factory of Huntley &amp; Palmers, but was becoming increasingly congested.

In 1871, the Corporation of Reading had obtained permission to build a swing bridge across the river just above Caversham Lock, but this was never done. However in 1911, Caversham was absorbed into the borough of Reading, and as part of the 1911 Extension Order (the parliamentary permission for this absorption), the Corporation was required to construct a footbridge between Caversham and De Bohun Road in Reading. The following year the Corporation successfully obtained permission to replace this proposed footbridge with a wider road bridge.

The original plan for the new bridge was for it to be a steel suspension structure, but in 1913 this was revised to an arched bridge built of the, then new, material of reinforced concrete to a design by L. G. Mouchel &amp; Partners. Whilst more expensive than the steel structure, it had the advantage of reduced maintenance costs and resilience to corrosion. It would also confer on Reading a modern landmark in the form of an elegant structure in a new material.

The actual building of the bridge was delayed by the outbreak of the First World War, but the construction contracts were finally let in 1922. The building work, by Holloway Brothers, started in March of that year, and the bridge opened on 3 October 1923. It remained the longest reinforced concrete span in the United Kingdom until 1928.

By 2013 the bridge was carrying 24,000 vehicles each day and was still only one of two road crossing over the Thames in Reading. Reading Borough Council commissioned VolkerLaser to develop a strategy for strengthening the bridge. Voids in the bridge deck and the southern approach ramp were filled with foam concrete, and carbon fibre plates were used to strengthen the structure.

In 2015 the bridge was complemented by the opening of the Christchurch Bridge, a pedestrian and cycle bridge situated some upstream.

<doc id="1267580" wikidata="Q5482355" url="?curid=1267580" title="Francis Russell (author)">
<text>Francis Russell (January 12, 1910 – March 20, 1989) was an American author specializing in American history and historical figures, who was born in Boston, Massachusetts and died in Falmouth, Massachusetts. Russell is best known for his book on Warren G. Harding, &quot;The Shadow of Blooming Grove&quot;. He graduated from Bowdoin College, and from Harvard University, with a master&#x27;s degree in 1937.
He served in the Canadian Army from 1941 to 1946.

He married Rosalind Lawson. He had a daughter from a previous marriage.

His papers are kept at Bowdoin College.

Russell became embroiled in a lawsuit with some of the heirs of Warren Harding around the publication of his 1968 biography of the former president. Alleging that they had been embarrassed by the previous publication of some of the love letters of Harding, the heirs sued and won a judgement preventing the publication of the letters by Russell.

His work on the Sacco-Vanzetti case, the award-winning &quot;Tragedy in Dedham: The Story of the Sacco-Vanzetti Case&quot; (1962), continued with the 1986 publication of &quot;Sacco &amp; Vanzetti: The Case Resolved&quot;. In it, he claimed to solve the case, proposing that only Nicola Sacco was guilty and Bartholomew Vanzetti was innocent.

<doc id="1267583" wikidata="Q4154047" url="?curid=1267583" title="Dive boat">
<text>A dive boat is a boat that recreational divers or professional scuba divers use to reach a dive site which they could not conveniently reach by swimming from the shore. Dive boats may be propelled by wind or muscle power, but are usually powered by internal combustion engines. Some features, like convenient access from the water, are common to all dive boats, while others depend on the specific application or region where they are used. The vessel may be extensively modified to make it fit for purpose, or may be used without much adaptation if it is already usable. 

Dive boats may simply transport divers and their equipment to and from the dive site for a single dive, or may provide longer term support and shelter for day trips or periods of several consecutive days. Deployment of divers may be while moored, at anchor, or under way, (also known as or live-boat diving). There are a range of specialised procedures for boat diving, which include water entry and exit, avoiding injury by the dive boat, and keeping the dive boat crew aware of the location of the divers in the water. 

There are also procedures used by the boat crew, to avoid injuring the divers in the water, keeping track of where they are during a dive, recalling the divers in an emergency, and ensuring that none are left behind.

==Purpose==
The dive boat provides a means of transport to and from dive sites which may be too far or inconvenient for shore access. This is the case with the majority of recreational dive sites. It can also provide a base of operations where the divers can shelter, rest, store and change gear, socialise with other divers, eat and sleep between dives. They can provide enhanced safety, comfort and convenience, and provide guided access to sites of particular interest, but introduce their own set of hazards. They can also provide access to diving procedures which may be difficult, dangerous or impossible from the shore.

==Types of dive boat==
The usual classification of recreational dive boats based on operational parameters includes:
* basic dive boats 
* day boats
* liveaboards 
Some overlap of function is possible.
Dive boats may be privately owned and operated, or run as a commercial business (generally known as charter boats).

The structure, layout and size of a dive boat for any given application may vary considerably according to regional requirements and traditions, and convenience.

===Basic dive boats===

These are usually open boats used for short distance, or short duration, trips to dive sites, usually for a single dive or sometimes for a &quot;two tank&quot; trip, either with both dives at the same site, or with the second dive on the way back, or a short distance from the first. They generally have no amenities other than seating and stowage for dive gear, and the divers are usually exposed to wind, spray and sun during the trip. It is common for divers to kit up in their dive suits before boarding, for protection from the weather. It is unusual for the operator to provide refreshments other than bottled drinking water and an after-dive candy.

==== Rigid-hulled inflatable boat ====
Divers only spend a few hours at a time on these fast but exposed boats. The boats are usually relatively small so they can easily be transported on roads and launched at a convenient site depending on the weather. Boats of this size can be launched from slipways or through the surf on suitable beaches. The smaller models are suitable for private use, as they can only transport a few divers. The larger boats can carry enough divers to be viable for professional use. These boats will generally carry basic safety equipment such as marine VHF radio, small boat safety gear, lifejackets and first aid oxygen administration equipment.

Space in the boat is limited, and divers generally travel and kit up while sitting on the tubes opposite a central cylinder rack where the fully rigged scuba sets are stowed. Water entry is commonly by simultaneous rolling backwards over the side, and return to the boat by climbing back in over the tubes one at a time after removing the heavy parts of the diving equipment and handing it up to the crew. Some boats have ladders which hook over the tubes to make boarding easier for the less athletic diver, others rely on assistance from the crew. An advantage of this type of boat compared with similar-sized rigid boats is that the inflated tubes make the boat very stable during the entry and exit of the divers and if the boat is filled with water during surf transit maneuvers. These boats are usually fairly fast, maneuverable, seaworthy in surf and rough conditions, and relatively wet and uncomfortable. They seldom provide any shelter from the elements, and their advantages are that they get the diver to the site and back fairly quickly, are generally good for operation through surf, are usually trailerable and can be launched at slipways and beaches.

====Open rigid hulled boats====
These serve a similar function to the Rigid-hulled inflatable boats, but do not have inflatable tubes. They are more durable, but usually heavier for the same load capacity. In Australia and New Zealand the light aluminium &quot;tinnie&quot; is often used as a dive boat. These boats are usually less stable than the equivalent inflatable and are not as easy to climb back on board, but are light, durable and economical. Kayaks and canoes are occasionally used as dive boats for one or two divers, and are portable and paddled by the occupants.

==== Decked rigid hulled boats ====
Flush decked boats with transom boarding arrangements are commonly used in areas with generally pleasant weather and sea conditions. The flush deck with seating and storage along the sides leaves the centre of the deck open for movement to and from the stern. Gates in the handrails amidships may be provided to get divers into the water more quickly, and an awning may be provided for protection from the sun.

====Inflatable boats====
These are usually relatively small and used only for short distances with a small number of divers. They are relatively uncomfortable, and not usually very fast, but are stable for their size and can be deflated, folded, and transported in a car or utility vehicle.

=== Day boat ===


These boats are usually made of rigid materials - such as glass reinforced resin, plywood or aluminium. Day boats are generally relatively large: typically, between in length, as they must provide some comfort for the passengers for several hours. Many day boats are used for scuba-divers and also for other marine tourism activities such as fishing and whale-watching. In general, divers or passengers will spend only the daylight hours on a day boat, and do not sleep in them overnight. Dive boats which provide sleeping accommodation are generally referred to as &quot;liveaboard&quot; boats. Generally a professional crew operate the boat. The boat provides shelter from the weather and is likely to have various facilities such as a toilet (called the &quot;head&quot;) and a small kitchen (called a &quot;galley&quot;), to cater for the guests and crew. Day-boats may have a saloon where divers can relax on upholstered benches, and one or more dining tables. Many day boats also have an uncovered sun-deck, and a shaded area, for divers wishing to be out in the open air. The boat will usually have a diving air compressor, oxygen first aid, a VHF radio, a GPS and possibly gas blending facilities. A day boat would generally be used to transport divers to multiple dive-sites (typically between one and three sites) during the same day, or multiple dives at the same site, with surface rest and refreshment periods between them.

The divers usually enter the water by stepping off a dive platform or the side of the boat, and return on board using a ladder or a lift. In some cases a smaller &quot;tender&quot; is used to carry divers to and from less accessible sites, and to rescue divers who are in difficulty or who drift away from the boat.

=== Liveaboard ===


On these commercially operated boats, the divers live and sleep on board and dive from the boat for periods of a few days to several weeks. A professional crew navigate and operate the boat. In addition to the usual domestic facilities expected by hotel guests, the boat will have a diving air compressor and emergency oxygen. Some have gas blending facilities and a few even carry a recompression chamber.

The divers enter the water by stepping off a dive platform or the side of the main deck, and return to the boat using a ladder or a mechanical lift platform. Divers may also transfer to and from the dive site in a tender which is carried on, and launched from, the liveaboard boat.

Liveaboards used on the West Coast of Thailand and in the Red Sea tend to be up to long and have:
* The engine and stores compartments.
* The lower deck, which is mostly cabins for the passengers, usually two passengers per cabin.
* At the stern, a diving platform with diving ladders.
* The main deck, with dining/social room, crew cabins, the bridge, and open space for preparation and storage of dive gear.
* One or two superstructure decks.

The size of a liveaboard can vary considerably, based mainly on the number of passengers carried, the quality of accommodations provided, special equipment carried, and legal constraints for registration.

===Diving support vessels===
A diving support vessel is a ship that is used as a floating base for professional diving projects. They are not generally classified as dive boats but share the basic purpose of transporting divers and giving them access to the water at the dive site. Basic requirements are the ability to keep station accurately and reliably throughout a diving operation, often in close proximity to drilling or production platforms, for positioning to degrade slowly enough in deteriorating conditions to recover divers without excessive risk, and to carry the necessary support equipment for the mode of diving to be used.

Recent offshore diving support vessels tend to be dynamically positioned (DP) and often have additional functions. DP makes a wider range of operations possible, but the platform presents some inherent hazards, particularly the thrusters, making launch and recovery by diving bell widespread. DSVs for inshore operations tend to be much smaller, and may operate while moored for shallow work. Live-boat operations are considered unacceptably hazardous for surface supplied diving unless a stage or bell is used to keep the divers&#x27; umbilicals clear of the vessel&#x27;s thrusters.

===Others===
Boats intended for other purposes can usually be used as dive platforms provided that there is reasonably convenient access to the water and enough space to carry the necessary equipment. Auxiliary sailing yachts and motor yachts are often used by their owners as dive boats, and catamarans can be particularly amenable to this function as they often have spacious decks and stern boarding facilities with swim ladders.

==Dive boat features==
Features that make a boat suitable for use by divers are:

* Sufficient space and stability to carry the divers and their equipment.
* Safe stowage for equipment during transit. 
* Facilities for the divers to enter the water from the boat and board the boat from in the water.

Basic marine safety equipment for the class of vessel will be required by regional or national legislation, and diving specific safety equipment may also be carried as required by legislation or the diver certification agency to which the boat operator is affiliated. This will usually include:

Basic marine safety equipment:
* marine VHF radio
* small craft emergency equipment - life jackets, flares, fire extinguishers and other equipment according to the size and operating range of the boat. 

Diving safety equipment:
* oxygen first aid equipment. 
* diving first aid equipment.
* diving shot, line, and buoy.
* a signal flag to indicate that divers are in the water.
* where necessary, equipment to bring an incapacitated diver on board. 

On larger boats additional diving support facilities may also be present:
* high pressure diving air compressor
* gas blending panel
* recompression chamber
* chase boat, or tender, to recover divers who surface away from the anchored vessel

===Access facilities===
 
If the freeboard of the boat is too high for the divers to climb back on board unaided, a ladder or other aid must be provided. Boarding aids range in cost, complexity, safety, and ease of use, from a boarding stirrup or a rope ladder, through rigid ladders and stairs with handrails, christmas tree ladders which allow the diver to climb while wearing fins, to temporary and fixed stern dive platforms, lifting platforms, diver lifts, and .

==== Diver lifts ====
 
A diver lift is a platform which is lowered into the water on which the diver stands while being lifted up to deck level. The lift mechanism constrains sideways motions of the platform, and has sufficient hand-holds for the diver to stand securely during lifting. A lift may also be used to lower a diver into the water. In most cases the lift will be suitable for transporting a fully kitted diver in a standing position, but in special cases seating may be provided. It differs from a diving stage or basket, which is lowered to diving depth, as a lift generally can only be lowered deep enough to stand up after swimming over the platform, which for most divers will be between . The lifting platform should have enough space to stand wearing fins, and there should be suitable handholds to allow the diver to be stable during lifting and lowering with a low risk of getting equipment or body parts in pinch points. The space allowed for walking between platform and boat should take into account the equipment likely to be carried by the diver, such as side mounted cylinders.

==Dive boat operations==

Procedures for diving from a boat vary depending on the boat, the diving equipment, the dive site and the dive plan.

===Stowage of dive gear===
Trim and stability of small boats can be significantly influenced by where and how the dive gear is stowed.
When transiting a surf line, or in other rough sea conditions, the movement of the boat can cause poorly secured equipment to move, which can directly injure the occupants, and adversely affect trim and stability, and thereby the safety of the vessel and its occupants. Dedicated dive boats usually provide cylinder racks to stow the scuba sets, and may also provide bins or racks to stow other heavy equipment. Larger vessels, particularly liveaboards, may also provide a camera table and fresh water rinsing facilities for washing gear after the dive.

===Deployment of divers===
Divers will usually enter the water with positive buoyancy, as this allows them to make final surface checks, signal to the boat that they are OK and co-ordinate descent with a buddy, but there are occasions when negative buoyancy entries are chosen to avoid excessive drift in a strong current, in which case all pre-dive checks must be done on the boat, the buoyancy compensator, and where applicable, the dry-suit emptied of gas, and the breathing apparatus function thoroughly checked before entering the water. The risk of injury if there is an equipment problem is greater for negative entry, particularly with breathing gas failures.

====Water entry====
Several techniques are used for water entry from boats, depending on the layout of the vessel, particularly the freeboard at the entry points. Large dive boats often have a permanent or folding platform at the stern just above the water, intended to make water entry and exit safer and more convenient for divers. Such platforms will usually be provided with steps or ladders from the deck, and folding ladders into the water.
*: The diver sits on the gunwale or RHIB tube facing into the boat, and falls in backwards. Suitable for open boats with low sides.
* is suitable for boats with low deck freeboard and no gunwale or railing.
* is suitable for boats with low or moderately low deck freeboard and no gunwale or railing at the entry point.
* is suitable for boats with moderate to high deck freeboard and no gunwale or railing at the entry point.
*, suitable for boat with very low deck freeboard and no gunwale or railing.
*Ladder entry may be used where there is a ladder into the water. Ladders may be fixed, folding or portable, and may be designed for use with swimfins.
*Lifting platform entry: The diver/s stand on a platform fixed to the boat by the lifting mechanism, and are lowered a short distance into the water. 
*Stage launch: The diver/s stand on a platform called a or basket, which can be lowered by a cable to a considerable distance below the surface.

===Monitoring and escorting the divers===
If there is no current, and the divers are visiting a small site and can surface on the shot-line or anchor line, keeping track is nominally simple if all goes to plan, as they will surface at a predictable position which is marked. This is not always the case, and for some dives they will surface away from the marker even when the plan is followed precisely. In other cases divers will not make it back to the shot-line and have to surface independently. If the dive boat is anchored and the plan is for the divers to ascend on the anchor line, it may be necessary to have a tender or chase boat available to follow and pick up divers surfacing off the mark.

One system common with recreational divers is for one of the divers in each group to deploy a delayed surface marker buoy (DSMB), also known as a decompression buoy, at the end of the dive. This serves to notify the boat that divers are surfacing, and where they are. It also warns other vessels to keep clear of divers in the water.

A group of divers drift diving together will often follow a dive leader who tows a surface marker buoy (SMB) throughout the dive. This allows the boat to follow the group effectively in most conditions. If any of the divers need to surface early they can ascend on the SMB line, and surface at the buoy, which is where they will be most easily seen by the boat crew. If anyone is separated from the group they can deploy a DSMB to notify the boat that they will be surfacing away from the float.

===Recovery of divers===

Divers may be picked up by a small tender or the dive boat may have a low enough freeboard for divers to climb over the side unaided, or with a bit of assistance from the crew. In this case it is usual to pass up heavy equipment such as weightbelts, and leave on the fins to help boost the diver out of the water. This is easiest with inflatable boats, particularly if provided with conveniently sited handles or ropes along the sides. For higher freeboards and easier boarding, mechanical aids may be provided:
*Ladders may be provided for boarding from the water.It is easier to climb a standard ladder or stairs if fins are removed first. They can be handed up to an attendant on the boat, clipped to the diver&#x27;s harness, or carried by sliding the fin straps over the forearm. Christmas tree ladders can be climbed with the fins on the feet, and should stand off the side of the boat far enough for the fins to have clearance.
*Stern and side platforms may be used in conjunction with ladders or low freeboard decks.
*Passerelles or gangways are ramps which are lowered at one end to provide a path to walk from the deck to a dock or tender, and can also be used to walk to the water level.
*Diver lifts are platforms attached to the boat on which the diver stands while being lifted to deck level or lowered a short distance into the water.
*Stages and baskets are platforms which are lowered into and under the water and are hoisted back on board with the diver or divers standing on them. They are not attached to the boat except by the lifting cable.
*Boarding stirrups can be used on low freeboard boats, particularly rigid hull inflatables. They are straps with a loop, rung or hook at the lower end attached to the side of the boat. The standard versions require a fin to be removed to get the foot into the stirrup, and have a fixed length, which can be awkward to use as the stirrup may be uncomfortably high for a tall person if at the right height for a short person. Adjustable versions allow the diver to clip the loop around the foot with the fin in place, then the loop can be raised to the preferred height after fitting. Open sided rigid &quot;hook&quot; stirrups allow the foot to be positioned on a rigid stirrup without removing the fin. Stirrup steps have the same ergonomic disadvantages as rope ladders: they swing freely under load.
===Boat diving hazards===

*Run down by boat (the dive boat or any other passing by)
*Cut by propeller (the dive boat or any other passing by)
*Left behind in the sea after the dive
*Seasickness
*Another diver landing on top during entry. This can happen when divers do a group backward roll over the side of a boat, and do not all go in together. Anyone rolling late may land on top of someone already in the water. It can also happen when entries are from the same point and a diver does not ensure that the water is clear to enter. 
*Falling overboard in transit, particularly when crossing a surf line after a beach launch in a boat where the seating is along the sides.
*Surfacing far away from boat and cannot be found.
*Surfacing away from an anchored boat and unable to swim back to it against wind or current.
*Hypothermia and wind chill on open boats in cold or windy weather
*Sunburn and overheating on open boats in hot weather

===Special procedures===
Some boat diving activities require special procedures to reduce risk or enhance the diving experience.

====Logging in and out====
The risk of being left behind by the boat can be controlled by logging divers into and out of the water. If this is done by each diver only for themselves, there is little chance of confusion and error. In other protocols the skipper or divemaster is responsible for ensuring there is a name-list of all divers on board before leaving the shore, and that everyone on the list is back on the boat before leaving the dive site.

====Use of personal marker====
Surfacing at the shot-line, group surface marker, or personal marker buoy increases the visibility of a diver, and reduces the risk of not being noticed by a passing vessel. This will reduce the risks both of being run down and of being lost at the surface. It also provides an additional flotation device in case of fatigue.

====Signalling the boat====
If the boat cannot see a diver at the surface, the diver can use several methods to be more visible, and once seen, can indicate to the boat whether they are in difficulty or not.

====Diving from an anchored boat====
When using the anchor line to control ascents and descents, a &quot;tag line&quot; (or &quot;lead line&quot;) may be used between the anchor line and the stern of the vessel, to allow secure transfer between these points in a current. A floating &quot;drift line&quot; (also &quot;tag line&quot;, &quot;current line&quot; or &quot;trail line&quot;) may be streamed from the stern or boarding platform to assist divers who drift astern of the vessel, and for something to hold onto while waiting to use the ladder. They can either hold onto the line and be pulled in by the crew, or pull themselves along the line. The far end of the line is usually marked with a brightly coloured buoy to show divers where it is and to help other boats avoid crossing the line. If there is any significant risk of a diver drifting away from the site, the dive boat should either be ready to slip the moorings at short notice, or have a tender in the water. Some skippers will tether the tender behind the dive boat where it can also be used as a drift line. A lazy shot or decompression trapeze may be suspended from the boat near the boarding area, and the drift line may be set up between this and the anchor line to guide decompressing divers ascending on the anchor line to the more convenient facility at the stern for the shallow stops.

====Live-boating====

 is diving from a boat which is not moored. There are increased risks due to the proximity of the divers to propellers when the engines are running, but there are also safety and convenience advantages to having the boat available to move at immediate notice, particularly in currents, as the boat can follow a group of drift divers, and pick up the divers from where they surface in most cases. Live boating is also used where anchoring is prohibited or impracticable.

====Decompression stations====

When a significant amount of decompression is planned by several divers at a site where they can reasonably expect to surface on the shotline, they may consider deploying a decompression trapeze. This keeps the divers together where it is easier to monitor them and provide support for the last part of the dive. A decompression trapeze can also be dropped by the boat for a group of divers by pre-arranged signal, such as a second decompression buoy at the group.

====Drift diving====
Drift diving occurs when the divers allow themselves to be conveyed past the bottom by the prevailing current, minimising the effort required to cover a relatively large distance, but moving the divers away from the start position and making their surfacing position uncertain. The usual way of monitoring the position of a group is by the lead diver towing a surface marker buoy, and the divers of the group all following the dive leader. The dive boat follows the buoy at a distance where the lookouts can see if any diver surfaces near the buoy. Divers from the group either surface along the buoy line, or if there is vertical current shear or they are separated from the group, deploy their own DSMB and surface on that. Groups of inexperienced divers may be escorted by a second divemaster who tries to keep them together, directs stragglers back to the dive leader, and keeps track of remaining gas. Divers may be formally grouped in buddy pairs, surfacing together when the first is low on gas, or more informally, and rely on the divemasters if they have a problem.

====Wreck diving====

A major consideration of wreck diving is finding the wreck and getting the divers to the wreck with the minimum risk of getting lost.
There are several methods for getting the divers to the wreck. The preferred method will depend on local conditions. In low visibility hooking onto the wreck is a reliable way of ensuring the divers will find it, but this procedure requires a wreck that is structurally suitable for snagging with a grapnel or anchor. A shotline which can be dropped off the wreckage is less likely to damage the wreck or become snagged and difficult to retrieve, but this requires appropriate visibility for the divers to be sure of finding the wreckage. When it is important to get back to the shotline for ascent, it may be tied to the wreckage by the first divers on site using a guide-line, which is retrieved by the last divers to leave. When there is a strong current, it may be necessary to drop in from up-current, a technique sometimes known as &quot;parachuting in&quot; or &quot;free drop&quot;. The wreck may be first marked with a shotline, if this is considered useful or necessary. Divers may surface on the shotline, anchorline or personal DSMB depending on the conditions. When there are alternative methods for descent, including free drop and descent on the shotline.

An (or Jersey upline) may be used to limit drift during ascent. This is a fairly substantial natural fibre rope which is deployed from the bottom using a small lift bag to provide the equivalent of a shotline. The lower end is tied off to the bottom, usually on a wreck, and the diver ascends on the line to avoid being swept away from the site by currents. After reaching the surface, the last diver cuts the line and it sinks back down, Natural fibre is used so the line rots away over a few years.

====Towing a diver====

Occasionally a diver may be towed using a &quot;sled&quot;, an unpowered device towed behind a surface vessel which conserves the diver&#x27;s energy and allows more distance to be covered for a given air consumption and bottom time. The depth is usually controlled by the diver by using diving planes or by tilting the whole sled. Some sleds are faired to reduce drag on the diver.

===Emergency procedures===
====Diver recall====

There are several ways to recall divers to the surface during a dive. Some are not universally known or immediately obvious, and the chances of them being understood correctly and responded to appropriately are increased if they are specified in the dive briefing.
*Pyrotechnic diver recall devices (Thunderflash) are small explosive devices calibrated to make sufficient noise to alert any divers in the vicinity without significant risk of injury to diver or environment. They have the advantages of being small, compact, and not easily confused with anything else likely to occur during the dive. They have disadvantages of a limited shelf life, and must be transported, stored, used and disposed of according to manufacturer&#x27;s instructions and legal constraints.
* A surface marker buoy line may be used to signal to the diver below, either by pre-arranged pull signals, or by sending down a weight clipped to the line and carrying a message.
* Underwater loudspeaker and public address (PA) systems produce either a pre-programmed or microphone input sound signal.
* Revving the boat&#x27;s engines is a popular but notoriously unreliable method, as few divers can distinguish between the sounds of the engines of their support boat and those of any other roughly similar vessel.

====Lost diver procedures====
There are three aspects to lost diver procedure:
*Lost buddy procedure, which is similar or identical to the procedure when diving from any other platform, until the diver notifies the boat that a diver is missing.
*Lost diver underwater, and
*Lost diver on the surface.
Generally, since the diver is lost, it is not known whether they are lost underwater or on the surface. Early notification that a diver is missing allows early starting of the search process. If the divers are notified of their expected behaviour during the dive briefing, the chances of timely notification of a problem are improved.

If a diver has not surfaced or returned to the boat when expected or a diver is reported missing by a buddy or dive leader, the diver is considered to be lost unless they have a surface marker buoy deployed. However, the presence of a buoy at the surface is no guarantee that it is connected to the diver.

====Decompression illness====
A dive boat will not be carrying a decompression chamber to treat a diver with decompression illness - that would normally classify it as a diving support vessel, so treatment would be limited to oxygen therapy with 100% oxygen, first aid emergency life support and transportation to the nearest suitable medical facility, or for operations where the equipment is available, and the risk is assessed as acceptable, technical or scientific divers may choose to do in-water recompression.

==Operating a dive boat==

The person in command of a dive boat is generally referred to as the skipper. In most cases the boat is fairly small and will not require many crew members. It is not unusual for the skipper to be the only crew member.
There may be national legislation requiring a certificate of competency or license from the person in command of a dive boat. This will generally depend on whether the boat is operated for profit, how many passengers it is licensed to carry and how far offshore it is licensed to operate.

<text>The Riverbend Festival, also called &quot;Riverbend&quot;, is a well-known annual music festival in Chattanooga, Tennessee, which was started in June 1982 as a five-night festival. Over the years, the festival devolved into the three nights of its current run and presently ranks in the top 10 percent of all American festivals. Additionally, Riverbend has won several national awards from the International Festivals and Events Association, including 8 in 2007. The attendance for Riverbend has grown over the years and there are now regularly over 650,000 people that come over the course of the festival from all over Tennessee, the Southeast, the United States, and other countries. Individual nights can see some 80,000 people in attendance. The festival was named for the bend in the Tennessee River on which Chattanooga was established.

More than a hundred acts, both well-known and new, converge each year to perform various kinds of music, including classic rock, country, urban, and bluegrass, as well as jam bands, on three stages set alongside the Tennessee River. Headline performers are featured nightly on the Coca-Cola Stage, a barge which has been converted into a full-size concert stage. The barge floats just off the shore against a large collection of amphitheater seats built into a hillside at the water&#x27;s edge. Major local and national companies, such as Covista Communications, Unum, and Budweiser, sponsor other stages throughout the riverfront area.

Admission is given to people with special scannable wristbands, which can be purchased in southeast Tennessee and north Georgia in the weeks leading up to the festival for a discounted price or purchased at the gate for a regular price. Admission was previously given to people who had collectible &quot;Riverbend Pins&quot;. A wristband provides admission for either one night or every night of the festival except for the Bessie Smith Strut. Concessions are purchased using a token system and many street vendors set up food and souvenir stands.

<text>Becicherecu Mic (; or &quot;Kleinbetschkerek&quot;; ) is a commune in Timiș County, Romania. It is composed of a single village, Becicherecu Mic. It also included Dudeștii Noi until 2004, when it was split off to form a separate commune. Its name means &quot;Small Becicherec&quot;, as opposed to the &quot;Great Becicherec&quot; (&quot;Becicherecu Mare&quot; in Romanian), located in Serbia and renamed Zrenjanin in 1946.

== Location ==
Becicherecu Mic is located northwest of Timișoara, on the national road DN6 Timișoara–Sânnicolau Mare–Cenad. It is also connected to the Timișoara–Cenad railway, which passes to the south, with the Pescărețul Mic station.

It borders Dudeștii Noi to the east, Hodoni to the north, Săcălaz to the southeast, Beregsău Mare to the south, Iecea Mică and Iecea Mare to the west and Biled to the northwest.

== History ==
Becicherecu Mic is mentioned as early as 1232 by the name &quot;terra Potkerequ&quot;. A hundred years later, in 1334, the parish of &quot;Pechkereky&quot; pays the Vatican the &quot;papal tithe&quot;, a grant from believers to support armed action against pagans. During the Hungarian occupation, in 1462, the village is given to the Hagymásy family from Beregsău. During the Turkish occupation (1552–1716), the name of the settlement would have been &quot;Crucea&quot; (&quot;cross&quot;), the hearth of the village being probably located on the Cross Hill. After the reconquest of Banat by the Habsburg Empire, in 1717, the imperial administration records the settlement with the name &quot;Peschered&quot;, in Romanian &quot;Pescăreț&quot; (&quot;pond with fish&quot;). In 1723, in County Mercy&#x27;s &quot;Karte des Temeswarer Banates&quot; (see online), the settlement appears for the first time under the name &quot;Becicherecu Mic&quot;. Its origin comes by rhotacism from the proper noun &quot;Pechereky&quot;, the name of a landowner. First German settlers arrive here in 1727. In 1748, 24 Romanian families brought from Transylvania were also colonized here. Between 1920 and 1925, the village was named &quot;Țichindeal&quot;, after scholar , born here in 1775.

== Demographics ==


Becicherecu Mic had a population of 2,853 inhabitants at the 2011 census, up 18% from the 2002 census. Most inhabitants are Romanians (83.49%), larger minorities being represented by Roma (2.8%), Serbs (1.79%), Hungarians (1.51%), Ukrainians (1.4%) and Germans (1.16%). For 7.43% of the population, ethnicity is unknown. The village was previously divided into four parts, although in recent decades the inhabitants have mixed: the &quot;German bend&quot; – towards the railway station, the &quot;Serbian bend&quot; – practically in the center of the village, the &quot;Romanian bend&quot; – around the Romanian church and the &quot;Gypsy outskirts&quot; or Chertiz, a group of specific houses, along with Serbs and Romanians. At the end of World War II many of the German inhabitants left the village because of Soviet occupation. The inhabitants traveled through Yugoslavia and Hungary for about seven weeks to get to Austria on 1 November 1944. The inhabitants were then assigned families to stay with. By religion, most inhabitants are Orthodox (76.41%), but there are also minorities of Roman Catholics (5.71%), Pentecostals (5.64%), Baptists (1.37%) and Serbian Orthodox (1.23%). For 7.85% of the population, religious affiliation is unknown.
== Economy ==
The economic activity is a consistent one, supported at local level by 223 firms active in fields such as agriculture, trade, production, software, construction and iron processing, among others.

The agricultural area of the commune consists of of arable land on which grains are grown: wheat, maize, barley, two-rowed barley, sunflower and rapeseed; of orchards with fruit trees and pasture that covers an area of .

<doc id="1267598" wikidata="Q7315014" url="?curid=1267598" title="Rescue craft">
<text>A rescue craft is a boat, ship or aircraft used in rescuing.

The most common are lifeboats for inshore and closer-to-shore rescues, with helicopters and ships used further out.

Most government agencies rely on larger ships for rescues further from shore such as Royal Navy ships in the UK and Coast Guard Cutters used in the US. Similarly, the UK rescues use both Royal Air Force SAR and UK Coastguard personnel for helicopter rescues, and in the US the United States Coast Guard is tapped.

==History==

===Sea===

There were attempts as early as the 14th century to aid shipwreck victims with the Chinese training in resuscitation for the drowning, as well as in Portugal and Sweden in the 1690s ordering that ships should be sent to sea to rescue shipwreck survivors. The first mention of lifeboats was in China where boats were used to rescue people from the rivers in 1737.

===Air===
The development of the seaplane meant that aircraft could be used to rescue people, but was limited as they could not land or take off in heavy seas.

Helicopters overcame this problem as they were able to hover over the victim and give aid by dropping a line to them with either a basket or diver to assist their extraction.

==Modern rescue craft==

===Sea===

Many types of boats and ships are used, ranging from two-man inflatables, such as inflatable rescue boats, rigid inflatable boats, and larger, purpose-built vessels.

For offshore and far from coast rescue operations, most countries rely on naval or coast guard ships.

For submarines which have encountered difficulty, there are highly-specialised rescue submarines and support ships such as the NATO NSRS and the US&#x27;s deep-submergence rescue vehicle.

==Inland or shallow water==
There are still smaller boats which may be used on inland waters such as lakes or estuaries where the waters are generally calmer and shallow. These boats are often hand powered.

<text>Hendrik Jan Schimmel (June 30, 1823 – November 14, 1906), Dutch poet, novelist and financier, was born at &#x27;s-Graveland, in the province of North Holland, where his father was a notary and the burgomaster.

==Biography==
From 1836 to 1842, Schimmel served in his father&#x27;s office, and upon his death, he worked in the office of the agent of the Dutch Treasury in Amsterdam, and in 1849, he took a post with the Dutch Trading Company there. In 1863, he became a director of the Amsterdam Credit Association. His first volume of poems appeared in 1852; but his literary position was made as a writer of historical dramas in blank verse and one of the regenerators of the Dutch stage. His finest production was &quot;Struensee&quot; (1868), which was preceded by &quot;Napoleon Bonaparte&quot; (1851) and &quot;Juffrouw Serklaas&quot; (&quot;Mrs Serklaas,&quot; 1857).

Among his other dramatic works were &quot;Joan Woutersz&quot; (a drama, 1847), &quot;Twee Tudors&quot; (&quot;Two Tudors,&quot; 1847), &quot;Gondelbald&quot; (1848), &quot;Schuld en boete&quot; (&quot;Guilt and Retribution,&quot; a drama, 1852), &quot;Het Kind van Staat&quot; (&quot;The State Child,&quot; a dramatic fragment, 1859); &quot;Zege na strijd&quot; (&quot;Struggle and Triumph,&quot; a drama, 1878). Schimmel&#x27;s renderings of Casimir de la Vigne&#x27;s &quot;Louis XI.&quot;, Geibel&#x27;s &quot;Sophonisbe&quot;, and Ponsard&#x27;s &quot;Lucréce&quot; are also still acted in the Netherlands.

His novels are distinguished by their vigorous style and able characterization. The earlier, better-known ones betray the writer&#x27;s English proclivities. The plots of &quot;Mary Hollis&quot; (1860, 3 vols, English translation, London 1872, under the title of &quot;Mary Hollis, a Romance of the Days of Charles II and William, Prince of Orange&quot;, 3 vols) and of &quot;Mylady Carlisle&quot; (1864, 4 vols) are laid in England, whereas those of his &quot;Sinjeur Semeyns&quot; (1875, 3 vols), a powerful picture of the terrible year 1672, and of &quot;De kapitein van de lijfgarde&quot; (1888, 3 vols, English adaptation, 1896, under the title of &quot;The Lifeguardsman&quot;, 1 vol.), a continuation of &quot;Master Semeyns&quot;, are almost entirely centred in Holland.

He had many points of style and manner in common with Madame Bosboom-Toussaint, though both remained highly original in their treatment. Both finally reverted to essentially national subjects. To the earlier romances of Schimmel belong: &quot;Bonaparte en zijn tijd&quot; (&quot;Bonaparte and his Time,&quot; 1853), &quot;De eerste dag eens nieuwen levens&quot; (&quot;The First Day of a New Life,&quot; 2 vols, 1855), &quot;Sproken en vertellingen&quot; (&quot;Legends and Tales,&quot; 1855), &quot;Een Haagsche joffer&quot; (&quot;A Hague Damsel,&quot; 1857), &quot;De Vooravond der revolutie&quot; (&quot;The Eve of the Revolution,&quot; 1866).

Schimmel was an early collaborator of Potgieter on the &quot;De Gids&quot; staff. His dramatic works appeared in a collected edition in 1885–1886 at Amsterdam (3 vols), followed by a complete and popular issue of his novels (Schiedam, 1892). He spent his last years in work on spiritualistic research and died at Bussum in 1906.

<text>Karl Ernst Claus, also known as Karl Klaus or Carl Claus (; 22 January 1796 – 24 March 1864), was a Russian chemist and naturalist of Baltic German origin. Claus was a professor at Kazan State University and a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He was primarily known as a chemist and discoverer of the chemical element ruthenium, which he named after his homeland of Russia, but also as one of the first scientists who applied quantitative methods in botany.

==Early life and education==
Karl Claus was born in 1796 in Dorpat, Livonia Governorate, Russian Empire, as the son of a painter. At the age of four, he lost his father and two years later became an orphan. In 1810, he moved to Saint Petersburg and started working as an assistant in a pharmacy. Although he had not received formal education, at age 21, Claus managed to pass the State exam in the pharmacy at the Military Medical Academy of St. Petersburg, becoming the youngest pharmacist in Russia at that time. Later in 1826, he established his own pharmacy in Kazan.

In 1821, Claus married Ernestine Bate whom he knew since his youth. They had three daughters born in Kazan and later a son, when they moved back to Tartu.

==Botany==
In 1827, Claus became involved, as an assistant of Eduard Friedrich Eversmann, in the botanical research of the steppes of the rivers Ural and Volga. He later used the collected data in his work &quot;Flora der Wolgagegenden&quot; (Flora of the Volga Region).

In 1834, while still studying at the University of Tartu, Claus went into another botanic trip to the trans-Volga steppes – this time with chemistry professor Gebel. The results of this expeditions were published in 1837–1838.

==Chemistry==
In 1828, when he already turned 32, Claus decided to continue his education at the University of Tartu. During the course of his studies, in 1831, he started working as an assistant at the chemical laboratory of the university. He graduated in 1835, and in 1837, defended his PhD thesis on analytical phytochemistry (&quot;Grundzüge der Analytischen Phytochemie&quot;) at the University of Tartu. In the same year, he applied at the St. Petersburg Medical-Surgical Academy for an academic position and obtained a post of the head of chemical laboratory at Kazan State University. In 1839, he defended habilitation thesis on separation of minerals in mineral waters and was appointed an assistant professor. He became full professor in chemistry in 1844.

==Ruthenium==
In 1840, Claus, received a substantial amount of platinum ore samples for his studies from the Ural Mountains and the St Petersburg Mint and started working on chemistry and isolation of noble metals, in particular rhodium, iridium, osmium, and to a lesser extent, palladium and platinum. In 1844, he discovered a new chemical element, which he named ruthenium, after Ruthenia, the latinised name for Russia and the Latin name of Rus&#x27;, by which Сlaus meant the Russian Empire and Russia in particular. Choosing the name for the new element, he stated: &quot;I named the new body, in honour of my Motherland, ruthenium. I had every right to call it by this name because Mr. Osann relinquished his ruthenium and the word does not yet exist in chemistry.&quot;

Claus managed not only to isolate ruthenium, but also determine its atomic weight and chemical properties. He noted the similarity of the chemical properties of ruthenium, rhodium, palladium and platinum and meticulously documented his results. For this discovery, he was awarded the Demidov Prize of 5,000 rubles (which was of much financial help to his large family). He sent samples of new element for analysis to Jöns Jakob Berzelius, who was one of the most renowned scientists in the field of new elements, and thereby became known to European scientists.

==Health and late years==
Claus was known for his negligent attitude towards his health. In particular, he often tasted his chemicals and new compounds and tested the strength of the acids by dipping a finger in them and touching his tongue with it. Once he severely burned his mouth while tasting one of the new ruthenium compounds that he had synthesized. When he isolated osmium tetroxide – a rather toxic chemical – he described its taste as astringent and pepper-like. In April 1845, he was poisoned by osmium tetroxide vapors and had to stop working for two weeks. In 1852, Klaus moved from Kazan back to the University of Tartu and assumed position of professor in pharmacy. He died in Tartu in 1864.

<doc id="1267628" wikidata="Q370815" url="?curid=1267628" title="Sergey Gorshkov">
<text>Sergey Georgyevich Gorshkov (; 26 February 1910 – 13 May 1988) was an admiral of the fleet of the Soviet Union. Twice awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union, he oversaw the expansion of the Soviet Navy into a global force during the Cold War as its Commander-in-Chief from 1956 to 1985.

== Early life and prewar service ==
Born in Kamianets-Podilskyi to a Russian family, Gorshkov grew up in Kolomna. After joining the Soviet Navy in 1927, he entered the M.V. Frunze Naval School in Leningrad during October of that year. Gorshkov began his service with the Black Sea Fleet (then known as the Black Sea Naval Forces) upon graduation in November 1931 as a watch officer aboard the destroyer . He quickly became its navigator a month later and in March 1932 transferred to the Pacific Fleet to serve in the same position aboard the minelayer . Promoted to become flagship navigator of the minelaying and minesweeping brigade of the fleet in January 1934, Gorshkov was given command of the &quot;Uragan&quot;-class guard ship &quot;Buran&quot; in November of that year. He studied at courses for destroyer commanders between December 1936 and March 1937, becoming commander of the destroyer following completion. After becoming chief of staff of the Pacific Fleet Destroyer Brigade in October, Gorshkov was appointed its commander in May 1938. During this period he participated in the Battle of Lake Khasan before being transferred west to command the Black Sea Fleet Cruiser Brigade in June 1940.

== World War II ==

From the first days after the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Gorshkov&#x27;s destroyer brigade participated in the Black Sea Fleet&#x27;s operations. Gorshkov was promoted to rear admiral on 16 September. During the Siege of Odessa, Gorshkov led a landing in the area of Grigorievka before taking command of the Azov Flotilla in October. In late December and early January 1942 he commanded the landings on the north coast of the Kerch Peninsula. In August, Gorshkov commanded 150 warships of the flotilla in a breakout from the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea after the withdraw of Soviet troops to Novorossiysk. After the resulting disbandment of the flotilla, he became deputy commander of naval forces and a member of the military council of the Novorossiysk Defense District. Gorshkov temporarily commanded the troops of the 47th Army defending the region in November during the Battle of the Caucasus.

After taking command of the reformed Azov Flotilla in February 1943, he led the unit during landings at Taganrog, Mariupol, and Osipenko, before supporting the troops of the North Caucasian Front in the capture of the Taman Peninsula. During the November 1943 Kerch–Eltigen Operation, Gorshkov personally supervised the preparations and the landing of troops for the main attack. For his leadership of amphibious operations, he was awarded the Order of Kutuzov, 1st class, while receiving the Order of Ushakov, 2nd class, for his command of the flotilla during the recapture of Crimea.

After being made commander of the Danube Flotilla in April 1944, Gorshkov led the unit during the August Jassy–Kishinev Offensive, supporting the troops of the 3rd Ukrainian Front in the crossing of the Dniester and the entry into the Danube Delta. Between September and November, the flotilla went on to support the troops of the 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts during the Belgrade and Budapest Offensives. Gorshkov was promoted to vice admiral in September 1944 and was transferred in December to command the Black Sea Fleet squadron, ending the war in that position. He was mentioned seven times in the orders of Joseph Stalin in the latter&#x27;s capacity of Supreme Commander of the Soviet Armed Forces.

== Cold War ==
Following the end of the war, Gorshkov continued to command the squadron until becoming Chief of Staff of the Black Sea Fleet in November 1948. He became the commander of the fleet in August 1951 and was promoted to admiral on 3 August 1953. Following his July 1955 appointment as First Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Navy, Nikita Khrushchev made him Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Navy in January 1956, succeeding Nikolai Kuznetsov. As Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Navy, Gorshkov simultaneously served as a Deputy Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, receiving the rank of admiral of the fleet on 24 April 1962. Under Leonid Brezhnev Gorshkov oversaw a massive naval build-up of surface and submarine forces, creating a force capable of challenging Western naval power by the late 1970s. This included the adoption of nuclear weapons, which were carried by ballistic missile submarines and aircraft, as well as the development of nuclear submarines and shipboard helicopters. In order to project Soviet military power, Gorshkov sent ships on lengthy cruises and formed operational squadrons in the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, building a blue-water navy. He received the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 7 May 1965 and was promoted to admiral of the fleet of the Soviet Union – the highest Soviet naval rank – on 22 October 1967.

Gorshkov was again awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 21 December 1982. Transferred to the Group of Inspectors General of the Ministry of Defense in December 1985, a retirement post for elderly senior officers, he was succeeded by Vladimir Chernavin. Gorshkov died in Moscow on 13 May 1988. He was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery.

Gorshkov is often associated with the phrase &quot;&#x27;Better&#x27; is the enemy of &#x27;Good Enough&#x27;&quot; (&quot;Лучшее - враг хорошего&quot;) which is reputed to have hung on the wall of his office as a motto. Similar sentiments have been attributed to Clausewitz and Voltaire. The motto appears in the Tom Clancy novel, &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;. The phrase is also attributed to Admiral Gorshkov in Norman Polmar&#x27;s &quot;Guide to the Soviet Navy&quot; (1983, 3rd edition).

In March 2013, Forbes reported Persson&#x27;s net worth as $28 billion making him the richest of Sweden&#x27;s 12 billionaires and the 17th richest person in the world; he has since dropped to number 50. Persson was the chairman of fashion company H&amp;M until May 2020, when he was succeeded by his son. He remains the company&#x27;s largest shareholder, owning a 36% stake. The company was founded by his father Erling Persson in 1947.

Persson took over H&amp;M from his father in 1982 and served as its manager until 1998. He also owns a substantial stake in the Swedish technology company Hexagon AB. Through his privately held real estate company Ramsbury Invest, Persson owns a large number of properties in London, Paris and Stockholm.

He is the sole director of Ramsbury Estates Limited, which farms in the English counties of Wiltshire, Berkshire and Hampshire, centred on the village of Ramsbury in Wiltshire. Since Persson acquired the business in 1997, it has bought the land of several neighbouring estates including Littlecote and Hungerford Park.

According to &quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot;, Persson had a net worth of US$21.2 billion in January 2022, making him the 89th richest person in the world at the time.

<text>Prince Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski (20 January 1616 – 31 December 1667) was a Polish noble (szlachcic), magnate, politician and military commander, and Prince of the Holy Roman Empire. He was the initiator of the Lubomirski Rebellion of 1665–1666 against royal authority.

Lubomirski was the son of voivode and starost Stanisław Lubomirski and Princess Zofia Ostrogska. He was married to Konstancja Ligęza since 1641 and Barbara Tarło since 1654. He was starost of Kraków since 1647, Crown Court Marshal in the same year, Crown Grand Marshal since 1650, Crown Field Hetman since 1658, starosta of Nowy Sącz and Spisz.

He became Sejm Marshal of the ordinary Sejm between 1 February and 29 March 1643 in Warsaw.

==Biography==
Lubomirski became famous as a commander during wars with the Zaporozhian Cossacks, Sweden, Transylvania and Muscovy in the 1648–1660 period. Inter alia he crushed the invading troops of George II Rákóczi and raided Transylvania. He also forced, together with Stanisław &quot;Rewera&quot; Potocki, Russian troops to surrender at the battle of Cudnów in 1660.

He was a staunch defender of the &quot;Golden freedoms&quot; and the leader of the fierce opposition to King John II Casimir, who was attempting to increase his power.

The King accused him of treason to the state and with an adjudication of guilt adopted by the Sejm, he lost all his offices and was sent into banishment in 1664.

However, in 1665 he started the &quot;Lubomirski Rokosz&quot; (Rebellion) and countermanded system reforms of the Commonwealth. Using his influence Lubomirski had two sessions of the Sejm dissolved, in 1665 by deputies Piotr Telefus and Władysław Łoś, and in 1666 by deputies Kasper Miaskowski and Teodor Łukomski. At the head of regular army units and some noble levy (pospolite ruszenie) forces, he defeated the Royal army at Częstochowa in 1665 and royal troops led by the future King John III Sobieski at Mątwy in 1666.

The Agreement of Łęgonice gave him back his dignity and annulled the earlier adjudication of the Sejm, the king was forced to give up his reform plans and the introduction of &quot;vivente rege elections&quot; and resulted in indirect abdication of the monarch in 1668. However, Lubomirski was forced into exile.

<doc id="1267637" wikidata="Q77333" url="?curid=1267637" title="Emanuel Geibel">
<text>Emanuel von Geibel (17 October 18156 April 1884) was a German poet and playwright.

==Life==
Geibel was born at Lübeck, the son of a pastor. He was originally intended for his father&#x27;s profession and studied at Bonn and Berlin, but his real interests lay not in theology but in classical and romance philology. In 1838 he accepted a tutorship at Athens, where he remained until 1840. In the same year he published, in conjunction with his friend Ernst Curtius, a volume of translations from Greek. His first poems were published in a volume entitled &quot;Zeitstimmen&quot; in 1841. In 1842 he entered the service of Frederick William IV, the king of Prussia, with an annual stipend of 300 thalers; under whom he produced &quot;König Roderich&quot; (1843), a tragedy, &quot;König Sigurds Brautfahrt&quot; (1846), an epic, and &quot;Juniuslieder&quot; (1848), lyrics in a more spirited and manlier style than his early poems.

In 1851, Geibel was invited to Munich by Maximilian II of Bavaria as an honorary professor at the university, and he relinquished his Prussian stipend. While in Munich he was at the center of the literary circle called &quot;Die Krokodile&quot; (&quot;Crocodile Society&quot;), which was concerned with traditional forms. In 1852 he married Amanda Trummer and the next year they had a daughter, Ada Marie Caroline. A volume of &quot;Neue Gedichte&quot;, published at Munich in 1857, and principally consisting of poems on classical subjects, denoted a further considerable advance in his objectivity. The series was worthily closed by the &quot;Spätherbstblätter&quot;, published in 1877. He had left Munich in 1869 and returned to Lübeck, where he remained until his death.

His works further include two tragedies, &quot;Brunhild&quot; (1858, 5th ed. 1890), and &quot;Sophonisbe&quot; (1869), and translations of French and Spanish popular poetry (&quot;Spanisches Liederbuch&quot; (1852), with Paul Heyse). Beginning as a member of the group of political poets who heralded the revolution of 1848, Geibel was also the chief poet to welcome the establishment of the Empire in 1871. His strength lay not, however, in his political songs but in his purely lyric poetry, such as the fine cycle &quot;Ada&quot; and his popular love-songs. He may be regarded as the leading representative of German lyric poetry between 1848 and 1870.

His poem &quot;Schön Ellen&quot; was set to music by Max Bruch. Johannes Brahms set one of Geibel&#x27;s paraphrases after Spanish poetry in the second of his Two Songs for Voice, Viola and Piano.

<doc id="1267643" wikidata="Q815598" url="?curid=1267643" title="Metering mode">
<text>In photography, the metering mode refers to the way in which a camera determines exposure. Cameras generally allow the user to select between &quot;spot&quot;, &quot;center-weighted average&quot;, or &quot;multi-zone&quot; metering modes. The different metering modes allow the user to select the most appropriate one for use in a variety of lighting conditions. In complex light situations professional photographers tend to switch to manual mode, rather than depending on a setting determined by the camera.

==Examples of metering modes==

===Spot metering===
With spot metering, the camera will measure only a very small area of the scene (1–5% of the viewfinder area). By default this is the centre of the scene. The user can select a different off-centre spot or recompose by moving the camera after metering. 
Certain models support a mode which allows averaging of multiple spot meter readings, and some support metering of highlight and shadow areas.

Spot metering is not influenced by other areas in the frame. It is commonly used to shoot very high contrast scenes. For example, in a backlit situation a rising sun may be behind a person whose face will be much darker than the bright halo around the body and hairline. Spot metering allows the camera to measure the light reflected from the person&#x27;s face and expose properly for that, instead of adjusting exposure for the much brighter light around the hairline. With the face properly exposed, the area around the back and hairline will become over-exposed. In many cases spot metering will over or underexpose a portion of the scene, so that the point of interest will be correctly exposed. 

Another example of the use of spot metering is photographing the moon. Other metering methods will increase overall exposure in an attempt to lighten the dark sky area, resulting in overexposure of the moon. Spot metering gives correct exposure of the moon and underexposes the rest of the scene which was dark already, so the low exposure is not noticeable. Spot metering may also be used for theatre photography, where brightly lit actors appear in a darkened auditorium. Spot metering is a method upon which the Zone System depends.

===Center-weighted average metering===
In this system, the meter concentrates on the central 60–80% of the scene. The balance is then &quot;feathered&quot; out towards the edges. This mode of exposure is less influenced by peripheral areas of the scene and is therefore well suited for photographs with subjects or objects of interest in the central part of the image. Some cameras allow the user to adjust the weight/balance of the central portion to the peripheral one. If the camera allows a user to move the focus point off the image center, metering will occur around the new focus location. Although promoted as a feature, center-weighted metering was originally a consequence of the meter reading from the focusing screen of SLR cameras. Light scatter from the focusing screen and proximity of the meter cell caused less sensitivity at the edges.

===Average metering===
In this metering mode, the camera uses light information from the entire scene and creates an average for the final exposure setting, giving no weighting to any particular portion of the metered area. In some situations, such as a snowy landscape, this mode will result in underexposure by 2 f-stops or more, because the metering system attempts to darken an excessively bright scene.

===Partial (selective) metering===
This mode meters a larger area than spot metering (around 10–15% of the entire frame), and is generally used when very bright or very dark areas on the edges of the frame would otherwise unduly influence the metering. As in spot metering, some cameras can use variable points for readings or use a fixed point in the centre of the viewfinder. 

===Multi-zone metering===
This mode is also called &quot;matrix&quot;, &quot;evaluative&quot;, &quot;honeycomb&quot;, &quot;segment metering&quot;, or &quot;esp&quot; (electro selective pattern) metering on some cameras. This metering mode was first introduced by the Nikon FA and was termed Automatic Multi-Pattern metering. On a number of cameras this is the default or standard setting. The camera measures the light intensity in several points in the scene and then combines the results to find the setting for the best exposure. The method of calculation can be different from camera to camera. The actual number of &quot;zones&quot; used varies widely, from several to over a thousand. The design concept behind multi-zone is to reduce the need to use exposure compensation.

Many manufacturers keep their exact calculation methods confidential as proprietary information. A number of factors are taken into consideration, including:
autofocus point, distance to subject, areas in or out of focus, colours/hues of the scene, and backlighting. Multi-zone tends to bias its exposure towards the autofocus point, thus ensuring that the point of interest has been exposed for properly. A database of thousands of exposures may be pre-stored in the camera, and the processor can use that information to determine what is being photographed.

Some cameras allow the option of locking exposure when autofocus is achieved. In other cameras the AF point is not used for exposure calculation, and in such cases it is common for metering to default to a central point in the viewfinder, using a pattern based on that area. There is considerable variation among different manufacturers how multi-zone metering is implemented–even in the model range of the same brand–and how much priority is given to the AF point itself. Some &quot;Scene&quot; modes, such as sunset, sports and night exposures also often affect the calculations of this metering pattern.

===Highlight-weighted metering===
Clipping is reduced by using a high resolution metering sensor and analyzing each area for washed-out (&quot;blown&quot;) highlights or underexposed shadows. Although there are some similarities with multi-zone, matrix, or evaluative metering, this mode uses a high-resolution sensor for detailed detection and gives more &quot;weight&quot; to reduce clipping.

<text>Ferdinand Reich (19 February 1799 – 27 April 1882) was a German chemist who co-discovered indium in 1863 with Hieronymous Theodor Richter.

Reich was born in Bernburg, Anhalt-Bernburg, Holy Roman Empire and died in Freiberg. He was color blind, or could only see in whites and blacks, and that is why Theodor Richter became his science partner. Richter would examine the colors produced in reactions that they studied.

Reich and Richter ended up isolating the indium, creating a small supply, although it was later found in more regions. They isolated the indium at the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology in Germany.

In 1803, Laplace and Gauss both derived that, if a heavy object is dropped from a height formula_1 at latitude formula_2, and the earth rotates from west to east with angular velocity formula_3, then the object would be deflected to the east by a distance of formula_4. In 1831, Reich set out to test this prediction by actually dropping objects in a mine pit (Drei-Brüder-Schacht, with latitude 50° 53′ 12.5″  N) 158.5 m deep, in Freiberg, Saxony, for 106 times. The average deflection is 2.84 cm to the east and 0.44 cm to the south. The eastward deflection is almost exactly equal to the theoretical value of 2.75 cm, but the southward deflection remains unexplained to this day. The experiment is published in

<text>The Football Federation of Armenia (FFA) (, &quot;Hayastani Futboli Federats’ia&quot;) is the governing body of association football in Armenia. Its headquarters are located in Yerevan.

The Federation organizes the Armenian Premier League, the Armenian First League, the Armenian Super Cup, the Armenian Independence Cup, and the Armenian Futsal Premier League. It is responsible for appointing the management of the Armenia national football team, and the Armenia women&#x27;s national football team. The Armenia national futsal team is also managed by the Federation.

The FFA was awarded a synthetic football turf pitch by FIFA through its GOAL programme.

==History==
Armenia&#x27;s official football history began in the early 1990s, but its traditions with the sport dates back further. The collapse of the Soviet Union and Armenia&#x27;s declaration of independence in 1991 were significant moments in the country&#x27;s sporting development, as well as in its political history. From a footballing perspective, those events prompted the founding, on 18 January 1992, of the Football Federation of Armenia.

The FFA duly became a member of the game&#x27;s world and European governing bodies, FIFA and UEFA, in 1992. The national team made their competitive debut in qualification for the 1996 UEFA European Championship. Armenia kicked off with a 2–0 defeat against Belgium on 7 September 1994 yet also made history in that EURO &#x27;96 campaign. The team recorded their first competitive victory when they won 2–1 against FYR Macedonia on 6 September 1995. Since then, Armenia has been a permanent fixture in EURO and World Cup qualifying tournaments, earning the notable achievement of finishing third in their UEFA Euro 2012 group, during which, talismanic attacking midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who then played in FC Shakhtar Donetsk, emerged as a player of top international caliber.

On an infrastructure level, work began in 2007 on a national-team training center and academy with residential facilities. The center opened in September 2010. The Yerevan Republican Stadium has also been partly redeveloped, with one particular benefit of this initiative being its impressive new playing surface. In recent years, around 90 small stadiums have been built throughout Armenia with the support of FIFA and the Government of Armenia. 

On 15 June 2022, President of FIFA Gianni Infantino paid an official visit to Armenia to participate in events dedicated to the 30th anniversary of the Football Federation of Armenia. Infantino pledged his support to develop football in Armenia. Infantino met with Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and advised that FIFA will continue to support Armenia in the development of football infrastructure, including with the construction of a new national stadium.

<text>Hieronymus Theodor Richter (21 November 1824 – 25 September 1898) was a German chemist. In 1863, while working at the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology, he co-discovered indium with Ferdinand Reich.

== Life ==
From 1843 to 1847, he studied at the Bergakademie Freiberg (with Carl Friedrich Plattner, among others) and became a member of the Corps Saxo-Borussia Freiberg. He then worked for the Freiberg Hüttenwerken, since 1853 as a metallurgist chemist.

From 1875 to 1896, Theodor Richter worked as director of the Mining Academy and was the last of the Freiberg directors elected for lifetime. In 1890 he was elected a member of the Leopoldina.

He died September 25, 1898, in Freiberg, Saxony, at the age of 73.

<doc id="1267656" wikidata="Q6814337" url="?curid=1267656" title="Members of the 38th Canadian Parliament and same-sex marriage">
<text>This article lists the members of the 38th Parliament of Canada and how they voted on the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; (Bill C-38), which amended the &quot;Marriage Act&quot; of Canada to recognize same-sex marriage. The legislation was later challenged in the 39th Canadian Parliament.

==Votes==
House of Commons
*This tally does not include the Speaker, who only votes in the House if there is a tie.

Up to 154 votes were needed to ensure the legislation passes, although the only formal requirement for passing legislation is the assent of a majority of members &quot;in attendance&quot; for the vote.

Senate
*For the purposes of this table, the Speaker of the Senate, who did not vote, is counted as an absentee since the official Senate tabulation does not list him as an abstainer.

==Background==
&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;&#x27;s analysis on December 13, 2004 placed the upper limit of opposed votes at 142.

Most of the Liberal cabinet, the Bloc Québécois (BQ) and the New Democratic Party (NDP) voted in favour of the Bill, while most of the Conservative Party members were against it. In the Liberal backbench, about 2/3 of members voted in favour.

On April 12, 2005, a vote was held on an amendment to Bill C-38 proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, Stephen Harper. The amendment would have stopped C-38 from advancing and maintained the &quot;traditional&quot; definition of marriage. The proposed amendment was defeated by a vote of 164 to 132. Ten MPs were absent, including 5 BQ MPs who reportedly oppose the bill. Certain MPs who had previously not declared their positions on the issue revealed their stands on the bill in this vote. All of these voted against the amendment, and therefore can be assumed to be in favour of same-sex marriage. Liberal MP Joe Comuzzi, who months prior to the vote mused about resigning his post as Minister of State, voted against the amendment because &quot;it was a Conservative motion&quot;.

A vote-in-principle was expected around April 19, but Conservatives stalled the bill by bringing up more MPs to speak on the issue. The 2nd reading vote came up on a recorded division, and passed 164–137. The rise in votes for the opposition came from several Bloc MPs who were absent for Harper&#x27;s amendment, but present for the 2nd reading vote.

Bill C-38 entered Report Stage on June 16, 2005. After exiting committee, the Government agreed to amendments to the bill that will further protect religious officials who do not wish to perform same-sex marriages, and to protect charitable organizations from losing their tax status.

The third reading vote on that bill in the House was expected the final week of June, after the House adopted a motion (supported by the Liberals, Bloc Québécois, and NDP) to extend the sitting of the house. Bill C-48 passed just before midnight on June 23, 2005 when the Liberals agreed with the Bloc and NDP to force a snap vote on the bill. The snap vote on C-48 was significant because if all Conservative MPs were present for the vote, and if all Bloc opposed, and the Independents voted as they usually did, the Government would have been defeated.

==House of Commons==

===Liberal Cabinet===
As per the principle of cabinet solidarity, all cabinet ministers were expected to vote in favour of government-introduced legislation. While backbench MPs in 2003, six future cabinet ministers voted in favour of a Canadian Alliance motion defining marriage in exclusively traditional terms. Joe Comuzzi decided to leave cabinet in order to vote against SSM. John Efford, a cabinet minister who recently opposed SSM decided to vote in favour of C-38. Former Liberal MP Pat O&#x27;Brien said he was personally told by six ministers that they may leave the cabinet rather than support SSM legislation, but this did not happen. Stephen Harper has pressured Paul Martin to allow his cabinet members a free vote, citing the precedent of Brian Mulroney in a capital punishment vote in 1988.

===Liberal backbench===

<text>The United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, also known as the House Foreign Affairs Committee, is a standing committee of the U.S. House of Representatives with jurisdiction over bills and investigations concerning the foreign affairs of the United States. Since 2025, the chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee has been Brian Mast of Florida.

The committee has a broad mandate to oversee legislation regarding the impact of national security developments on foreign policy; war powers, treaties, executive agreements, and military deployments abroad; foreign assistance; arms control; international economic policy; and other matters. Many of its responsibilities are delegated to one of six standing subcommittees, which have jurisdiction over issues related to their respective region in the world. The committee also oversees the U.S. Department of State, American embassies and diplomats, and the U.S. Agency for International Development.

During two separate periods, 1975 to 1978 and 1995 to 2007, the Foreign Affairs Committee was renamed the Committee on International Relations; its duties and jurisdiction remained unchanged.

Its counterpart in the Senate is the Committee on Foreign Relations.

==Members, 119th Congress==

Resolutions electing members: (Chair), (Ranking Member), (R), (D), (D)

==Subcommittees==
Whereas until the 118th Congress, subcommittees tended to combine jurisdiction over particular regions of the globe with jurisdiction over broader policy areas (e.g. terrorism or energy policy), in the 118th Congress, the subcommittees were reconfigured to strictly focus on geographical areas, with the exception of global issues and international organizations which received their own subcommittee.

<doc id="1267658" wikidata="Q543695" url="?curid=1267658" title="Mongoose lemur">
<text>The mongoose lemur (Eulemur mongoz) is a small primate in the family Lemuridae, native to Madagascar and introduced to the Comoros Islands. These arboreal animals have pointed faces, long, bushy tails, dark-brown upper parts, pale bellies, and beards, which are reddish in males and white in females. They live in family groups and feed primarily on fruit, but also eat leaves, flowers, and nectar, with nectar from &quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot; trees making up a large part of their diet during the dry season. They have declined sharply in numbers because of habitat destruction and hunting, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated their conservation status as &quot;critically endangered&quot;.

==Description==
The mongoose lemur ranges in size from long plus a tail of . Both sexes are born with white beards, but become obviously dimorphic around six weeks of age when the males develop red beards and red cheeks. The males also have lighter faces than the females. Males may further distinguish themselves when scent-marking territory, as they occasionally develop a bald patch on top of their heads from rubbing.
==Distribution==
The mongoose lemur lives in dry deciduous forests on the island of Madagascar and in the humid forests on the islands of the Comoros. This makes the mongoose lemur one of only two lemurs found outside of Madagascar, though it is an introduced species in the Comoros.

==Ecology==
The mongoose lemur mostly eats fruit, though flowers, leaves, and nectar also make up part of its diet; (they may use the nectar of the non-native kapok tree, &quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot; for nearly eighty percent of their diet during the dry season in some parts of their range). As such, mongoose lemurs act as both pollinators and seed dispersers. Feeding on grubs and beetles has also been observed. They are unusual among primates in that they are diurnal or nocturnal, depending on the season, being more active during the day in the wet season and changing activity to the night during the hotter dry season.

Mongoose lemurs are arboreal, with the ability to jump several meters from one tree to another. They live in small family groups, usually consisting of a bonded pair and one to three offspring. These groups rarely encounter one another, but when they do, they are aggressive. Young are born just prior to the rainy season, from August to October. Gestation lasts about four months and weaning takes place around five months after the young are born. The offspring then usually stay with their parents until three years of age, when they have reached full maturity.

Mongoose lemurs have seasonal habits. Their breeding, eating, and activity habits are largely shaped around the season. Seasonal fluctuations in food resource availability describe the behavior of mongoose lemurs such as female dominance and small group size. Mongoose lemurs usually conceive their offspring some time during October. They present as Nocturnal during the dry season and diurnal during the wet season.

==Status==
Captive mongoose lemurs can live up to 26 years, while wild specimens live 18–20 years. Mongoose lemurs in the wild are threatened by the destruction and fragmentation of the forests in which they live, and also by hunting. Their numbers have dwindled by about 80% over a period of 25 years, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated their conservation status as &quot;critically endangered&quot;. Mongoose lemurs are more endangered in Madagascar, but there could be a way to conserve them in Comoros because of the increase of these species&#x27; population in the area.

<text>Gavin William James Esler (born 27 February 1953) is a Scottish journalist, television presenter and author. He was a main presenter on BBC Two&#x27;s flagship political analysis programme, &quot;Newsnight&quot;, from January 2003 until January 2014, and presenter of &quot;BBC News at Five&quot; on the BBC News Channel. Since 2014 he has served as the Chancellor of the University of Kent. On 11 March 2017, Esler confirmed via his Twitter profile that he would be leaving the BBC at the end of the month to concentrate on his writing activities. He returned to the BBC later that year as host of &quot;Talking Books&quot;.

He stood unsuccessfully as a candidate for Change UK in London at the 2019 European Parliament election.

==Early life==
Esler was born in Glasgow on 27 February 1953, the first son born to a manager of a building company. During his first weeks, he suffered from a condition that made him unable to digest milk and his parents feared for his life. He had an operation at just three weeks old. His family lived in Clydebank before they moved to Edinburgh, where he began his education at Duddingston Primary School before gaining a scholarship to George Heriot&#x27;s School at the age of seven.

His Scottish childhood had a profound and long-lasting effect on him. His parents moved to Northern Ireland but he remained in Edinburgh. Esler was the first in his family to go to university, graduating at the University of Kent with a BA in English and American literature in 1974. Alongside his studies he also wrote for &quot;Incant&quot;, the university newspaper. He then gained an MA in Anglo-Irish literature with distinction from the University of Leeds.

==Journalism career==

Esler began working as a journalist in 1976, aged 23, as a junior reporter with the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot;.

He joined the BBC in 1977 as Northern Ireland reporter, working under Bernard Cornwell, and extended his role after joining &quot;Newsnight&quot; in 1982. Esler was appointed Washington correspondent in 1989 and then, a year later, became the BBC&#x27;s chief North America correspondent. Based in Washington, Esler&#x27;s responsibilities now extended to shaping the corporation&#x27;s coverage across the whole of North America, which included reporting on both the earlier George H. W. Bush and Clinton administrations. Esler has also reported for news and documentary programmes across Europe, Russia, China and North and South America.

Esler combined reporting with presenting from the mid-1980s on BBC One&#x27;s regional news programme for London and the South East of England – &quot;Newsroom South East&quot;. He worked as an anchor on the BBC News channel (at the time known as &quot;BBC News 24&quot;) from its outset in 1997 and co-presented its prime-time slot with Sian Williams for several years.

In January 2003, he joined &quot;Newsnight&quot;, replacing Jeremy Vine, who had left to take over from Sir Jimmy Young on Radio 2. During his career Esler has interviewed heads of state and government including Bill Clinton, Jacques Chirac and King Abdullah II of Jordan. He has also interviewed a wide range of cultural figures, including Dolly Parton, Doris Lessing, Penélope Cruz, Angelina Jolie, V. S. Naipaul, Roger Waters, Vikram Seth and Seamus Heaney. Esler left &quot;Newsnight&quot; in January 2014, and was replaced by Laura Kuenssberg.

In 2005, Esler interviewed George Galloway on &quot;Newsnight&quot; about the London bombings. The BBC was reported to have received hundreds of complaints about his interview alleging his questioning was &quot;rude and aggressive&quot;. Peter Barron, editor of &quot;Newsnight&quot;, defended the questioning of Galloway&#x27;s tactics:

In 2007 a BBC Trust publication investigating impartiality in the organisation criticised an unnamed BBC news presenter for writing an article in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; newspaper entitled &quot;Why the World Needs Hillary&quot;, stating they had been &quot;unwise&quot; for doing so. The article appeared to endorse Hillary Clinton to be the next US President and it soon emerged that the news presenter in question was Esler. The BBC report noted that &quot;the apparent endorsement of one presidential candidate in elections in a country which, in his words, &#x27;now seems seriously off 
course&#x27; could make it hard for that presenter to conduct American political interviews&quot;.

Until 2017, Esler was the main presenter of &quot;Dateline London&quot; on BBC News and BBC World News most Sunday mornings at 11 am. Between 2008 and 2017, he also presented the &quot;BBC News at Five&quot; on the BBC News channel on Fridays and when Huw Edwards was away. Esler has also hosted BBC Radio 4 factual series &quot;Four Corners&quot; along with fellow Scottish broadcaster Anne MacKenzie. He had a regular slot on Saturdays and Sundays, working across BBC World, BBC News and BBC One, and co-presented the regular &quot;Film Review&quot; with Mark Kermode.

On 11 March 2017, Esler confirmed via his Twitter profile that he would be leaving the BBC to concentrate on his writing activities. &quot;The Film Review&quot; was presented by other presenters although he continued to present &quot;Dateline London&quot;. He returned on 31 March 2017 to present his final &quot;BBC News at Five&quot; and &quot;Film Review&quot;. He returned to the BBC later that year as host of &quot;Talking Books&quot;.

Since 2021 Esler has been a regular presenter and contributor to the political podcast &quot;The Bunker&quot;.. Since 2023 he has presented the podcast &quot;This Is Not A Drill&quot;.

==Literary career==
Esler is the author of five novels and four non-fiction books. The novel &quot;A Scandalous Man&quot; was described by fellow author Bernard Cornwell as &quot;a compelling book, its political sophistication made luminous with wisdom, sympathy and story telling&quot;. His fifth novel, &quot;Powerplay&quot;, was published by HarperCollins in August 2009. Esler&#x27;s first non-fiction book, &quot;The United States of Anger&quot; published in October 1997 by Penguin, explores America&#x27;s discontent with itself and was described by the &quot;New Statesman&quot; as &quot;a vivid portrait of America in the 1990s&quot;. Esler&#x27;s 2019 book &quot;Brexit Without the Bullshit&quot; discusses some of the potential consequences of the UK&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Union. For several years he also wrote regular columns for &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot; and other publications..

Esler&#x27;s most recent book, &quot;How Britain Ends - English Nationalism and the Re-birth of Four Nations&quot;, was published in February 2021 and in which Esler claims a resurgent English nationalism is pulling the United Kingdom apart.

==Political career==
In August 2018, Esler spoke at a People&#x27;s Vote rally in Edinburgh. People&#x27;s Vote is a campaign group calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal between the UK and the European Union. On 23 April 2019, he was announced as a candidate for Change UK in London in the May 2019 European Parliament election. The party announced its intention to stop Brexit and pursue a second referendum on membership of the EU. It gained 3.4% of the vote nationally and failed to win any seats. In London the party achieved 5.3% of the vote, but this was only just over half of the number required for Esler as lead candidate to win the 8th and last seat under the d&#x27;Hondt system of proportional representation used in the election.

In an interview with the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;, published on 6 May 2019, Esler stated that, &quot;I want to stop Brexit. Fix Britain. And then I want to reform the things that are wrong with the EU&quot;. He added, that he thought Nigel Farage was &quot;affable&quot; and a &quot;good communicator&quot;, but whilst he was &quot;more honest on that than many other politicians who support Brexit&quot;, his approach was reminiscent of Nazism; &quot;The word &#x27;betrayal&#x27; was used in Germany from 1919 onwards and throughout the 1920s with terrible results&quot;.

Esler has criticised the way the BBC and other TV and radio news has handled balance. He states that the present mode of balance involves &quot;if you have a Tory on you get a Labour Party person&quot;, but says that &quot;that&#x27;s not what politics is like anymore&quot;. He criticises giving equal balance to &quot;someone who really knows what they are talking about&quot; and &quot;someone who is essentially the village idiot&quot;.

In August 2021 it was announced that Esler would be a competitor on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot;. He left the competition during a quarter-final &quot;after serving up an ‘incomplete’ dessert compared to ‘soup’.&quot;

==Personal life==
Esler has been married to rock violinist Anna Phoebe, his second wife, since 2012. They have two children. He was first married in July 1979, to teacher Patricia Warner, and they had two children together. The couple&#x27;s separation was reported in 2008 and a divorce granted in 2010.

Esler&#x27;s hobbies include camping, hiking and skiing. He is a fan of progressive rock, citing King Crimson, Jethro Tull, Colosseum and Pink Floyd as favourite bands, and presented &quot;Prog&quot; magazine&#x27;s Progressive Music Awards for three consecutive years between September 2012 and 2014.

==Awards and honours==
Esler&#x27;s report on the military build-up in the Aleutian Islands as part of the Reagan administration&#x27;s New Maritime Strategy earned him a Royal Television Society award.

In 2007 he won a Sony Gold Award for his radio documentary report &quot;Letters from Guantanamo&quot; on Sami al-Hajj, one of the detainees in Guantanamo Bay. Following the broadcast, al-Hajj was released from American custody.

Esler has received two honorary degrees from the University of Kent: an honorary MA was awarded in 1995, followed by an honorary Doctorate in Civil Law in 2005. He was installed as the sixth Chancellor of the university in July 2014.

<text>Everhardus Johannes Potgieter (June 27, 1808February 3, 1875) was a Dutch prose writer and poet, who was born at Zwolle in Overijssel.

== Biography ==
He started life in a merchant&#x27;s office at Antwerp. In 1831 he made a journey to Sweden, described in two volumes &quot;Het Noorden in omtrekken en tafereelen&quot; (&quot;The North in Outlines and Scenes&quot;) , which appeared at Amsterdam in 1836–1840. Soon afterwards he settled in Amsterdam, engaged in commercial pursuits on his own account, but with more and more inclination towards literature. With Jan Pieter Heije (1809 – 1876), the popular poet of Holland in those days, and Reinier Cornelis Bakhuizen van den Brink (1810 – 1865), the rising historian (see also Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer (1801 - 1876)), Potgieter founded &quot;De Muzen&quot; (The Muses, 1834–1836), a literary review, which was, however, soon superseded by &quot;De Gids&quot; (The Guide), a monthly, which became the leading magazine of Holland. In it he wrote, mostly under the initials of W. Dg, a great number of articles and poems.

The first collected edition of his poems (1832–1868) appeared in two volumes (Haarlem, 1868–1875), preceded by some of his contributions to &quot;De Gids&quot;, in two volumes also (Haarlem, 1864), and followed by three volumes of his &quot;Studien en Schetsen&quot; (&quot;Studies and Sketches&quot;, Haarlem, 1879). Soon after his death a more comprehensive edition of Potgieter&#x27;s &quot;Verspreide en Nagelaten Werken&quot; (&quot;Miscellaneous and Posthumous Works&quot;) was published in eight volumes by his friend and literary executor, Johan C. Zimmerman (Haarlem, 1875–1877), who likewise supervised a more complete edition of Potgieter&#x27;s writings which appeared at Haarlem in 1885-1890 in 19 volumes.

Of Potgieter&#x27;s &quot;Het Noorden in Omtrekken en Tafreelen&quot; the third edition was issued in 1882, and an edition de luxe of his poems followed at Haarlem in 1893. Under the title of &quot;Personen en Onderwerpen&quot; (&quot;Persons and Subjects&quot;) many of Potgieter&#x27;s critical essays had collectively appeared in three volumes at Haarlem in 1885, with an introduction by Conrad Busken-Huet.

Potgieter&#x27;s favourite master among the Dutch classics was Pieter Cornelissen Hooft, whose peculiarities in style and language he admired and imitated. The same vein of altruistic, if often exaggerated and biased, abhorrence of the conventionalities of literary life runs through all his writings, even through his private correspondence with Huet, parts of which have been published.

Potgieter remained to his death the irreconcilable enemy of the Dutch &quot;Jan Salie&quot;, as the Dutchman is nicknamed who does not believe in the regeneration of the Dutch people. Potgieter held up the Netherlanders of the Dutch Golden Age of the 16th and 17th centuries as models to be emulated. In these views he essentially differed from Huet. Yet the two friends worked harmoniously together; and when Potgieter reluctantly gave up &quot;De Gids&quot; in 1865, it was Huet whom he chose as his successor.

Both then proceeded to Italy, and were present at the Dante festivities at Florence, which in Potgieter&#x27;s case resulted in a poem in twenty stanzas, &quot;Florence&quot; (Haarlem, 1868). According to a critique in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, Potgieter&#x27;s influence in Holland was very marked and beneficial; but his own style, that of ultra-purist, was at times somewhat forced, stilted and not always easily understood.

<text>All India Forward Bloc (Ruikar) was a political party in India, emerging out of split from the All India Forward Bloc.

==History==
In the spring of 1948 the recently reorganized All India Forward Bloc split into two factions. In February the Central Committee of AIFB met in Varanasi to discuss the situation after Independence and Partition. At the meeting it was decided that AIFB should break all relations to the Indian National Congress and that a separate party should be created out of the branches in Pakistan. The then general secretary of the party, Sheel Bhadra Yagee effectively dissolved the Bengal state committee of the party, and appointed &quot;ad hoc&quot; committees in West Bengal and East Bengal.

This spurred discontent inside the party. Leading the rebellion against Yagee was the party president, S.S. Cavesheer. Yagee decided to resign as general secretary. In May the Central Committee met again and appointed Ramchandra Sakharam Ruikar as the new general secretary. Yagee grouped his followers around himself, and by this time the two factions virtually functioned as two separate parties. The group led by Ruikar had its emphasis on nationalism rather than Marxism, and called themselves &#x27;Subhasists&#x27;.

On 29–31 December the Ruikar faction held a congress in Ashutosh College Hall, Calcutta. Ruikar was elected general secretary and Cavesheer as president. At the same time the Marxist faction held a congress in Hooghly. Thus the split was complete. The Ruikar-led party adopted the Indian tricolour with a leaping tiger as their flag, identical to the one used by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose&#x27;s Indian National Army.

In 1951 the issue of reunification was raised inside Ruikar&#x27;s party. In June the Central Committee of the party held a meeting which decided to move ahead with the reunification of Forward Bloc. Ruikar and Leela Roy disagreed with the decision, and were expelled. The two Forward Blocs held a joint central committee meeting in Howrah on 23 June, in which the two parties merged. Ruiker and Leela Roy did however mobilize their followers and reconstituted themselves as a separate party.

In the 1952 general elections, the Electoral Commission let the Ruikar-led party contest as &#x27;Forward Bloc (Ruikar)&#x27; and the other AIFB group as &#x27;Forward Bloc (Marxist)&#x27;. FB(R) contested six Lok Sabha seats, 3 in Madhya Pradesh, 1 in Madras and 2 in West Bengal. The elections resulted in a humiliating defeat for Ruikar&#x27;s party. In total the six candidates got 133 936 votes.

In the West Bengal legislative assembly election the party was a member of the People&#x27;s United Socialist Front, together with the Socialist Party and the Revolutionary Communist Party of India (Tagore). The party contested 32 assembly seats, and won two (the only two PUSF to win any seats). The elected MLAs of the party were Atindra Nath Bose from Asansol and Biren Roy from Behala.

The following year the party was disbanded and merged into Praja Socialist Party.

<doc id="1267673" wikidata="Q696813" url="?curid=1267673" title="Use Your Illusion">
<text>Use Your Illusion is the name of two releases by American rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses: a 1998 compilation album, drawing from the &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; and &quot;II&quot; studio albums featuring songs without explicit lyrics, and a 2022 box set anniversary edition of both albums.

The first compilation was only released in the United States, and was primarily sold at Walmart and Kmart, two retail outlets that refused to stock the unedited &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; and &quot;II&quot; due to explicit lyrics. The second compilation featured remastered versions of both albums alongside several live shows in honor of the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary.

==Overview==
&quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot; appears in an edited version without Josh Richman&#x27;s speech, removed for unknown reasons. Therefore, the track length is reduced to 5:20, instead of 5:36 from the version included on &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot;. Richman&#x27;s speech was instead included in the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation album.

The cover art of the album simply combines the color schemes from the covers of &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; and &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot;, which were originally designed by Mark Kostabi. Like the original two, the image is a detail of the Raphael painting &quot;The School of Athens&quot;.

<text>The Pigeon Egg Strategy is a black-and-white film directed by Max Makowski. One of the most notable aspects of the film is its multi-cultural nature. Makowski is a Brazilian who speaks Spanish and he shot the film with an American cast in Hong Kong with a crew of Chinese pornographers. The script was written in Germany. It was made for US$125,000 and recouped its investment through self-distribution to small independent cinemas. Completed in 1997, the 84 minute absurdist comedy about a strange chain of events that take place amongst a group of identically attired assassins, posing as German ham delivery men in Hong Kong was shot in less than 15 days. It appeared in the frontier section of the Sundance Film Festival and South by Southwest, and has not received any sort of major distribution, leaving its cult following to a limited number of viewers. There are many jokes about the nature of language and it is filled with puns and non sequitur. The tagline on the poster reads:

&quot;It&#x27;s all fun and games until someone loses an eye (or a &#x27;u&#x27;).&quot;

<doc id="1267678" wikidata="Q1677736" url="?curid=1267678" title="Jacobo Zabludovsky">
<text>Jacobo Zabludovsky Kraveski (May 24, 1928 – July 2, 2015) was a Mexican journalist. He was the first anchorman in Mexican television and his TV news program, &quot;24 Horas&quot; (&quot;24 Hours&quot;) was for decades regarded as the most important in the country.

==Early life==
Zabludovsky was born in 1928 in Mexico City to Polish Jewish immigrants. He was the brother of Abraham Zabludovsky (1924-2003), a famous architect.

==Career==
Zabludovsky was a well known anchor man hosting &quot;24 Horas,&quot; the main news program on the popular Televisa network between 1970 and 1998. Owing to the nonconfrontational approach of the network, the programme was perceived as partisan and supportive of the government.

In 1998, citing a desire to cut down his workload and ill-health, he retired from presenting &quot;24 Horas&quot;, which also came to an end with his departure, marking the end of an era in Mexican journalism.
After leaving &quot;24 Horas&quot;, Zabludovsky worked on special newscasts and documentaries. However, in 2000, he resigned from the Televisa network following the resignation of his son, Abraham, who also worked for Televisa. Zabludovsky claimed that his son had been overlooked for the position of night time news anchor and that he was resigning out of solidarity with him.

During his career at Televisa, Zabludovsky covered several important issues. He was one of the few Mexicans reporting in Cuba the day Fidel Castro entered Havana in 1959 during the overthrow of the Batista dictatorship and reported from his car phone (at that time these car phones were the only mobile phones in Mexico and were a luxury item), and reported on the 1985 earthquake that destroyed several parts of Mexico City. However, there was criticism of his coverage of presidential elections in 1988 and 1994, when he favored the candidate of the government party to the exclusion of opposition contenders. 
He interviewed many notable people, including President Ernesto Zedillo, Salvador Dalí and María Félix.

Eighteen months after leaving television, he began a radio newscast on a new station, &quot;La 69&quot; at Grupo Radio Centro, with the pledge of being more critical &quot;...in agreement with the new Mexico in which we are living.&quot;. Beginning on March 3, 2004, the newscast was also broadcast on Radio Red AM and Radio Red FM. Zabludovsky hosted the newscast until June 22, 2015, being hospitalized shortly after.

From 2007 until 2015, he also wrote &quot;Bucareli&quot;, a weekly column for Mexican nationwide newspaper El Universal.

In 2009, his voice appeared in &quot;Up!&quot;, a Disney-Pixar film.

Zabludovsky returned to television in 2012 as part of ESPN Deportes and ESPN Mexico&#x27;s coverage of the 2012 Summer Olympics, he was also part of the network&#x27;s coverage of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup the following year. On June 2, 2015, exactly one month before his death, Zabludovsky covered the historic match between the Cuba national football team and the New York Cosmos in Havana, Cuba. The match marked the first time an American sports team visited Cuba after the United States began normalizing relations with the island nation.

He is the subject of Molotov&#x27;s song Que No Te Haga Bobo Jacobo (Don&#x27;t let Jacobo make a fool out of you), where he is accused of receiving bribes from Carlos Salinas and negotiating the news with the government. In a 2013 interview, Zabludovsky said about the song: &quot;I have never heard it, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s offensive, but if it was, they have the right to express what they think.&quot;.

==Death==
Zabludovsky died of a stroke caused by dehydration at the age of 87 in Mexico City on the morning of July 2, 2015. He was buried at Mexico City&#x27;s Israelite (Jewish) Cemetery that afternoon. He is survived by his wife Sara and three children.

<doc id="1267684" wikidata="Q222108" url="?curid=1267684" title="Austrian Football Association">
<text>The Austrian Football Association (; ÖFB) is the governing body of football in Austria. It organises the football league, Austrian Bundesliga, the Austrian Cup and the Austria national football team, as well as its female equivalent. It is based in the capital, Vienna.

Since 1905, it has been a FIFA member, and since 1954, a UEFA member. Since 7 April 2002, Friedrich Stickler, the director of executive committee of the Austrian lottery, has been the president of the Austrian Football Association. Supporting him is its president, Kurt Ehrenberger, Frank Stronach, Gerhard Kapl, and Leo Windtner. In 2004, it was announced there are 285,000 players (both sexes) in Austria playing for 2,309 teams in the federation, although many more players play informally or for non-recognised teams. Thus the federation is the largest sporting organisation the country. Football is, perhaps with the exception of skiing, the most popular sport in Austria. Football possesses a large value, and has a rich history and tradition in Austria.

==History==
In 1894, the First Vienna Football Club, the first football team in Austria, were founded in Vienna. From this nucleus, the Austrian Football Association was established in 1904. One year after the establishment, Austria became a member of the international football federation FIFA and hosted the fifth FIFA congress in 1908. In 1913, they supervised the Galicja national team, which was directly subordinate to the Polish Football Association.

The milestones of the federation and past football history were the years 1930 to 1933, 1950 to 1954 and then 1958 as well as 1978, 1982, 1990 and 1998 with the participation of Austria at the World Cup.

Hugo Meisl was one of the best-known personalities in the early years of the Austrian Football Association, becoming general-secretary and national team coach in 1927. At the 1936 Summer Olympics, his team won silver after losing 2–1 to Italy, Austria&#x27;s only international final. Meisl&#x27;s team, nicknamed the &quot;Wunderteam&quot;, remained unbeaten from 12 April 1931 to 23 October 1932 in 14 successive matches. The highlights of this series were the 6–0 (Berlin) and 5–0 (Vienna) victories against Germany.

The 1950s saw more achievements with their well-known football greats such as Ernst Ocwirk (twice captain of the FIFA World Selection Team), Ernst Happel, Gerhard Hanappi and Walter Zeman. The FIFA World Cup 1954 ranks among being most successful in Austrian Football Association history. Twenty years after being in 4th place in the FIFA World Cup 1934 held in Italy, Austria returned to the circle of the best teams again.

<text>Conrad Busken Huet (28 December 1826, The Hague – 1 May 1886, Paris) was a Dutch pastor, journalist and literary critic.

==Biography==
Busken Huet, son of a Hague civil servant, attended Gymnasium Haganum and studied theology at Leiden University, in Geneva and Lausanne. He was appointed pastor of the Walloon church in Haarlem in 1851. 
A student of Prof. Johannes Henricus Scholten and friend of Prof. Abraham Kuenen, Busken Huet familiarized his parishioners with the insights of &#x27;Modern Theology&#x27;, e.g. with respect to the Bible. In 1857-1858 he created a scandal by publishing &quot;Brieven over den Bijbel&quot; (&#x27;Letters on the Bible&#x27;), in which he popularized the &#x27;Modern&#x27; view on the origins and authority of the Bible:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Just as all Christianity is purely devotional love after Christ’s example, the entire Bible is purely a human creation. Yes, a creation inspired by the personal faith of the prophets and apostles; brought forth by the national genius of the Hebrews, which genius both the apostles and the prophets represented; one that did not fall from the clouds like a meteor, but rose from the bosom of the Jewish people, as the goddess of beauty rose from the billows whose foam created her; one which was not, in part or whole, put on paper and collected in one or two volumes through the external intervention of Providence, but which emerged leaf by leaf, like a budding flower, from the stem of Israel; one that did not bypass the Jews or go over the heads as it came to us from God, but came from the Jews themselves, under God’s guidance; a human creation, in other words, inspired by human faith, consummated by human art, preserved by human care, understood by every true human heart and acknowledged as the voice of the heart, as the voice of human devotion, human suffering, human happiness: such is the human creation the Bible is to me.&quot;

In 1862, after realizing that these &#x27;Letters&#x27; had ruined his clerical career, Busken Huet resigned his charge. Attempting journalism instead, he went out to Java in 1868 as the editor of a newspaper. Before this time, however, he had begun his career as a polemical man of letters, although it was not until 1872 that he was made famous by the first series of his &quot;Literary Fantasies and Chronicles&quot;, a title under which he gradually gathered in successive volumes all that was most durable in his work as a critic. His one novel, &quot;Lidewyde&quot;, was written under strong French influences.

Returning from the Dutch East Indies, Busken Huet settled for the remainder of his life in Paris. For the last quarter of a century he had been the acknowledged dictator in all questions of Dutch literary taste. Perfectly honest, desirous to be sympathetic, widely read, and devoid of all sectarian obstinacy, Busken Huet introduced into Holland the light and air of Europe. He made it his business to break down the narrow prejudices and the still narrower self-satisfaction of his countrymen, without endangering his influence by a mere effusion of paradox. He was a brilliant writer, who would have been admired in any language, but whose appearance in a literature so stiff and dead as that of Holland in the fifties was dazzling enough to produce a sort of awe and stupefaction. The posthumous correspondence of Busken Huet has been published. Also, Busken Huet used papers by Peter Thaborita for his description of Pier Gerlofs Donia.

<doc id="1267688" wikidata="Q3646532" url="?curid=1267688" title="Bufalino crime family">
<text>The Bufalino crime family, also known as the Pittston crime family, the Pittston–Scranton crime family, the Scranton–Wilkes-Barre crime family, the Northeastern Pennsylvania crime family, the Northeastern Pennsylvania Mafia, or the Scranton Mafia, was an Italian-American Mafia crime family active in Northeastern Pennsylvania, primarily in the cities of Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, and Pittston.

Based in Pennsylvania&#x27;s Coal Region, the family&#x27;s power originated in labor racketeering within the coal industry, as well as the garment industry in Pittston and New York City, where the Bufalino family colluded with the Five Families of New York. The family&#x27;s namesake and longest-serving boss, Russell Bufalino, led the organization until his death in 1994.

==History==
La Cosa Nostra (LCN) in Pittston originated in the 1880s, with one of the earliest known Sicilian Mafia members residing in the city being Stefano &quot;Steven&quot; La Torre, who settled in Pittston after immigrating from Montedoro in Sicily. La Torre formed a group of &quot;Montedoresi&quot; criminals, which included Santo Volpe. Volpe took over as boss of the Northeastern Pennsylvania crime family after La Torre abdicated the position. Under Volpe&#x27;s leadership, the family took control of local bootlegging, counterfeiting, Italian lottery, and &quot;black hand&quot; extortion rackets.

Situated in the anthracite Coal Region of Pennsylvania, the family infiltrated the area&#x27;s coaling-mining companies as well as the United Mine Workers Union, the labor union that represented mine workers in contract negotiations with company management. During the 1930s, Volpe became a member of the State Coal Commission, and members of his crime family gradually took control of coal companies and union locals. Volpe was later succeeded as boss by Giovanni &quot;John&quot; Sciandra, a partner in the Knox Coal Company of Luzerne County. The family controlled a large territory in Northeastern Pennsylvania—which included Pittston, Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, Wyoming, Luzerne, Allentown, Hazleton, Bethlehem, Lancaster, and Easton—as well as Binghamton, Endicott, Endwell, Johnson City, and Auburn, in the Southern Tier of New York state.

===Bufalino and Barbara hosting the Apalachin meeting===
After the death of boss John Sciandra in 1949, the family elected Rosario Alberto &quot;Russell&quot; Bufalino to become the new boss of the crime family.

In November 1957, boss Russell Bufalino and Buffalo crime family &quot;caporegime&quot; Joseph Barbara held a national Cosa Nostra meeting at his Apalachin, New York estate. The meeting was preceded by the assassination of Albert Anastasia by a few weeks, as well as a smaller meeting at the New Jersey estate of Ruggiero Boiardo. The Apalachin meeting was attended by about 100 Mafia heads from the U.S., Italy and Cuba. A raid by New York State Police caught many heads of families or their deputies. Many other family heads and their deputies were suspected of being present by law enforcement but evaded detection and capture. All those apprehended were fined, up to $10,000 each, and given prison sentences ranging from three to five years, however, all the convictions were overturned on appeal in 1960.

===Bufalino era===
Russell Bufalino became a powerful Mafia boss. He owned at least seven dress factories in the Pittston area and exercised complete control over the region&#x27;s garment industry. Bufalino also spearheaded the family&#x27;s infiltration of the Garment District of New York City. Additionally, the family became increasingly active in Central New York state and South Florida. During the 1960s, the family had a membership of 30 or 40 &quot;made men&quot;.

The Bufalino family formed working relationships with other Mafia families as well as non-traditional organized crime groups such as outlaw motorcycle gangs. The family was permitted to maintain business interests in New York City by the Five Families. The Bufalino family relied on a New York family for representation on the national Mafia Commission, and the Colombo crime family represented the organization for many years. Additionally, the family maintained a close alliance with the Genovese crime family due to common interests in New York City and northern New Jersey.

After Bufalino was imprisoned in the late 1970s on extortion charges related to the collection of a debt, William &quot;Big Billy&quot; D&#x27;Elia became the family acting boss with the support from underboss Edward Sciandra. D&#x27;Elia was aided in running the family by captains Anthony Guarnieri, James David Osticco, and Phillip Medico, &quot;consigliere&quot; Remo Allio, as well as soldiers Angelo Bufalino, John Rizzo, Angelo Son, and Joseph Sperrazza. Bufalino was released from prison in 1980 briefly after serving his sentence for extortion. Towards the end of 1981, Bufalino was again imprisoned after being found guilty of conspiring to kill Jack Napoli, a witness in his 1978 extortion trial. Bufalino learned the whereabouts of Napoli, then in the Witness Protection Program, and conspired with Los Angeles mobster Jimmy Fratianno and another man he met in prison to murder Napoli. Fratianno turned government informant and testified against Bufalino at trial. He was sentenced to ten years imprisonment and released in 1989.

With the decline of Pennsylvania&#x27;s coal industry, many of the Bufalino family&#x27;s rackets became less lucrative. The membership of the family was also decimated during the 1980s by eight prosecutions, involving 24 members and associates, and eleven deaths. The family ceased inducting new members in the late 1970s due to Bufalino&#x27;s apparent reluctance to recruit, and the Commission later prohibited the Bufalino family from permitting new members or appointing a new boss. The Genovese and Gambino families were given permission to assume control of the Bufalino family&#x27;s activities in New York.

===D&#x27;Elia the last boss===
Russell Bufalino died on February 25, 1994, of natural causes near Pittston, Pennsylvania. William &quot;Big Billy&quot; D&#x27;Elia became the new boss of the Bufalino family after the death of Bufalino. D&#x27;Elia started his criminal career in the Bufalino family in the late 1960s as Bufalino&#x27;s driver, after his late sister married the only son of capo James David Osticco. According to the Pennsylvania Crime Commission, D&#x27;Elia was placed in the crew of &quot;caporegime&quot; Phillip Medico. D&#x27;Elia advanced through the ranks of the organization rather quickly, due to the natural attrition of members and indictments in the 1980s and 1990s. He took over the crime family&#x27;s solid waste rackets and oversaw the traditional Mafia rackets run by the members and associates of the family. D&#x27;Elia also attempted to replenish the aging ranks of the family, with limited success. As boss, D&#x27;Elia worked with the other crime families in New York City, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Southern Florida, and Los Angeles. In the 1990s, D&#x27;Elia was linked to a money laundering scheme involving numerous Northeastern Pennsylvania bookmakers, escort services, corrupt politicians, and associates of Russian organized crime. D&#x27;Elia was closely aligned with the Philadelphia crime family. When Philadelphia crime family boss John Stanfa was imprisoned, D&#x27;Elia was one of Stanfa&#x27;s choices as interim caretaker of the family.

On May 31, 2001, agents from the Criminal Investigation Division of the IRS, US Postal Inspectors, and Pennsylvania State Police executed search warrants at the homes of D&#x27;Elia, his mistress Jeanie Stanton, Thomas Joseph, and Marranca, who has been identified as an informant working for the FBI and the Pennsylvania State Police. Marranca also testified on behalf of authorities against Louis DeNaples in front of the Fourth Statewide Investigating Grand Jury, in regards to DeNaples&#x27; mob ties and his ownership of the Mount Airy Casino. On February 26, 2003, D&#x27;Elia was banned from entering any Atlantic City, New Jersey, casinos by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, based on information shared by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the &quot;Pennsylvania Crime Commission&quot;.

On May 31, 2006, D&#x27;Elia was indicted on federal charges of laundering $600,000 in illegal drug proceeds obtained from a Florida-based associate of the Bufalino crime family among others, including Lucchese family associate Phillip &quot;Fipper&quot; Forgione. While D&#x27;Elia was free on bail, he solicited a U.S. Customs Agency informant to murder a witness in the case and was remanded to prison until his eventual guilty plea and sentencing. In March 2008, D&#x27;Elia pleaded guilty to witness tampering and money laundering. He was sentenced to nine years in prison. D&#x27;Elia cooperated with the government and testified against Louis DeNaples, the owner of Mount Airy Casino Resort in the Pocono Mountains. In 2010, D&#x27;Elia got two years dropped from his sentence for his assisting the government&#x27;s investigation against DeNaples.

<text>Svetogorsk (, ) is an industrial town in Vyborgsky District of Leningrad Oblast, Russia, located on the Karelian Isthmus, on the Vuoksi River. It is located from the border with Finland, from the Finnish town of Imatra, and from St. Petersburg. Population: 

==History==
Originally called Enso, the town was founded in 1887 to serve a paper mill. At the time, Enso was part of Viipuri Province and the Jääski Municipality in the Grand Duchy of Finland, which was an autonomous part of the Russian Empire. When Finland became independent in 1917, Enso remained part of Finland.
The territory was ceded by Finland to the Soviet Union by the Moscow Peace Treaty as a result of the Winter War. After the Winter War, the Finns and the Soviets disagreed on the interpretation of the peace treaty regarding Enso. The former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Finland Väinö Tanner wrote in his memoirs: &quot;Already now a dispute about the district of Enso developed. According to the map attached to the peace treaty Enso was clearly intended to belong to Finland but the Russians claimed that it should belong to them. Later the map was redrawn according to the interests of the Russians so that the border bends at Enso.&quot;

In March 1940, Enso became a part of Yaskinsky District with the administrative center in the work settlement of Yaski. It was a part of the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, after March 31, 1940 of the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic.

Enso was recaptured by Finns between 1941 and 1944 during the Continuation War but was again ceded to Soviets by the Moscow Armistice. This secession was formalized after signing the Paris Peace Treaty in 1947. The Finnish population was resettled to Finland, while migrants from Central Russia resettled the Karelian Isthmus.

On November 24, 1944, Yaskinsky District was transferred from Karelo-Finnish SSR to Leningrad Oblast. On October 1, 1948, the district was renamed Lesogorsky and on January 13, 1949, all Finnish names of the localities were replaced with Russian names. In particular, Enso was renamed Svetogorsk. On December 9, 1960, Lesogorsky District was abolished and merged into Vyborgsky District.

In 1972, the Soviet Union awarded Finland a construction project for a large new cellulose and paper mill in Svetogorsk. The project was paid with Soviet crude oil. The project also gave a start to cross-border relations. Notably, the construction workers in Svetogorsk were called &quot;builders&quot;, and the project also had intent to &quot;build friendship between peoples&quot;.

On April 18, 2008, about five hundred inhabitants of Svetogorsk participated in a protest which included a road barricade on the Finnish–Russian border as a protest against poor road conditions and lack of investment in road improvement at both federal and municipal level. According to the Finnish public service broadcaster Yle, the militia participated in effectively cutting off through traffic. The main issue of discontent was the lack of a bypass, which, according to reports, should have already been built.

==Administrative and municipal status==

Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with the urban-type settlement of Lesogorsky and two rural localities, incorporated within Vyborgsky District as Svetogorskoye Settlement Municipal Formation. As a municipal division, Svetogorskoye Settlement Municipal Formation is incorporated within Vyborgsky Municipal District as Svetogorskoye Urban Settlement.

==Economy==
===Industry===
Before the Winter War, the town was a major factory site for Enso-Gutzeit Oy, the Finnish pulp and paper company (now Stora Enso). In the 1940 Moscow Peace Treaty, the new Finnish-Soviet border was deliberately drawn to leave the factory complex on the Soviet side. The town&#x27;s major industry is still pulp and paper.

OAO &quot;Svetogorsk&quot;, one of the biggest paper mills in Russia, is the major employer. Covering , OAO &quot;Svetogorsk&quot; produces pulp, printing paper, and packaging board. Its brands include &quot;Svetocopy&quot; and &quot;Ballet&quot; office paper. Since December 1998, OAO &quot;Svetogorsk&quot; has been majority owned by International Paper. At end of 2001, the plant employed 3,000 people; by 2008 this had fallen to 2,200.

Immediately adjacent to OAO &quot;Svetogorsk&quot; is a tissue mill. This formed part of the original mill complex but was split-away and resold by International Paper to SCA during the acquisition of OAO &quot;Svetogorsk&quot; from Tetra Laval, which controlled the plant since 1995. &quot;Svetogorsk Tissue&quot;, as the separate entity was to be called, became fully integrated into SCA Hygiene Products Division in 2003 (called Essity since 2017). It employs around four hundred people. Its products include &quot;Zewa&quot; and &quot;Tork&quot; brands of paper towels and toilet paper.

===Border crossing===
The Imatra–Svetogorsk border crossing plays a key role in the transportation of timber between Russia and Finland. Also, around 150 employees commute daily from Imatra to the paper mills. The border crossing, which had temporary status, was a bottleneck causing frequent delays due to lengthy customs checks and inadequate facilities. A Russia-Finland agreement in 1997 allowed the development and eventual permanence of the border crossing. This €7 million European Union TACIS-funded project ran from 1999 and the new international frontier, capable of handling 1,300 cars per day, opened on July 3, 2002.

===Transportation===
Svetogorsk is connected by railway with Kamennogorsk, where it has connection to the old Vyborg–Joensuu railroad. There is suburban traffic to Vyborg. The continuation of the railroad beyond Svetogorsk to the Finnish–Russian border is disused.

Svetogorsk is connected by roads with Kamennogorsk and Vyborg, as well as with Imatra across the border.

==In fiction==

Svetogorsk is a key location in Desmond Bagley&#x27;s 1973 novel &quot;The Tightrope Men&quot;.

==Sister city==
Svetogorsk has one sister city:
* Imatra, Finland

<text>Bernardo Carbo (born August 5, 1947) is an American former professional baseball outfielder and designated hitter who played 12 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). He began his career with the Cincinnati Reds, and went on to play with five other teams, including two stints with the St. Louis Cardinals and Boston Red Sox.

==Early life==
He was raised in the Detroit suburb of Livonia and graduated in 1965 from Franklin High School, playing for the school&#x27;s baseball team while there. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed.

==Career==
An outfielder, Carbo was the Cincinnati Reds&#x27; first selection (16th overall) in the inaugural 1965 draft, ahead of Johnny Bench, and his first major league hit was a home run. In his 1970 rookie season, Carbo posted career highs in batting average (.310), home runs (21), runs batted in (63), hits (113), on-base percentage (.454), slugging average (.551), OPS (1.005) and games played (125). Carbo was selected Rookie of the Year by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, but he slumped in the next two seasons and was sent to the St. Louis Cardinals.

===Boston Red Sox===

After the 1973 season in late October, St. Louis traded Carbo and Rick Wise to the Boston Red Sox for Reggie Smith and Ken Tatum. He said of coming to Boston: &quot;When I first met [Red Sox owner] Mr. Yawkey, he was shining shoes in the clubhouse,&quot; said Carbo, &quot;and I went up to him and gave him $20 and told him to get me a cheeseburger and fries.&quot; While playing for the Red Sox, he was a part of the &quot;Buffalo Heads&quot;, with Bill &quot;Spaceman&quot; Lee and Ferguson Jenkins. Carbo would also carry around a giant stuffed gorilla that was named Mighty Joe Young. The gorilla sat next to him in the middle seat on planes. Carl Yastrzemski wanted the gorilla placed on the bat rack in the dugout.

The 1975 World Series matched the Red Sox with the heavily favored Cincinnati Reds, who were looking for their first title since 1940. Boston had also suffered a drought by not winning a Series since 1918. The clubs battled back and forth, with the Reds winning three of the first five games. Carbo was excited to see some of his old teammates. Carbo would be on the bench, and his former teammates were sympathetic. Clay Carroll inscribed a picture for him and it read &quot;Good luck in the World Series.&quot; After Game 3, when Carbo hit a home run off him, Carbo said, &quot;They told me Carroll was in here and just went crazy, ripping up the picture into little pieces.&quot;

Game 6 was postponed three days because of rain. Carbo did not join his teammates for batting practice at Tufts University because he said he couldn&#x27;t find it. He spent the early part of Game 6 working on his Louisville Slugger. &quot;I’m sitting there and I’m whittling this bat, I took a lathe and took all the polish off. It&#x27;s nice and smooth. Rick Wise is sitting next to me and says, ‘You know, you can’t use that bat. It doesn’t have an emblem on it.’ So as the game was going I took a magic marker and wrote ‘Louisville Slugger’ on it. That&#x27;s how I kept myself amused.&quot;

In Game 6 (October 21), with two outs and two batters on base in the eighth inning, Roger Moret was scheduled to bat. Darrell Johnson told Carbo to get ready. And I said, &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m not going to hit. Juan Beníquez, grab a bat, you&#x27;re going to hit. Sparky&#x27;s going to go to the lefthander because Sparky goes by the book.&quot; Darrell said, &quot;Well, go up and stand on the on-deck circle.&quot; And they introduced me. So I&#x27;m still thinking Sparky will come out and take Rawly Eastwick out and go with Will McEnaney. But the umpire says, &quot;C&#x27;mon, you’ve been announced, you’re hitting.&quot;

So I go into the batter&#x27;s box. I ain’t ready to hit. Next thing, strike one, strike two, ball one, ball two. Then he threw me a cut fastball, a little slider and I took it right out of Bench&#x27;s glove — the ball just dribbled out. I step out and I’m thinking, &quot;Aw man, I almost struck out. I was lucky.&quot;

I hit the next pitch to center field. I rounded first base and I saw César Gerónimo going back. Rounding second, I knew it was gone and I&#x27;m yelling to Pete Rose, &quot;Don&#x27;t you wish you were this strong?&quot; And Pete is yelling back, &quot;Ain&#x27;t this fun, Bernie? This is what the World Series is about. This is fun.&quot;

Johnny Bench said after the game it looked like a Little Leaguer learning how to hit. Pete Rose said it was the worst swing he ever saw. Don Zimmer said he thought it was over. Rico Petrocelli said it looked like a pitcher who hurt his arm, trying to make a comeback as a hitter.

Carbo&#x27;s pinch three-run home run tied the score 6-6, paving the way for Carlton Fisk&#x27;s game-winning homer in the bottom of the twelfth for a 7-6 Red Sox victory. Carbo&#x27;s pinch homer was his second of the Series, tying Chuck Essegian&#x27;s 16-year-old record for most in a World Series. Game 7, watched by an estimated 71 million TV viewers, saw the Reds triumph in the ninth inning on a bloop single by Joe Morgan for a 4-3 win. Carbo&#x27;s Game 6 home run was later inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2004 as a memorable moment.

Tom Yawkey would pass away in 1976, and Carbo wept. Carbo saw Yawkey as a father figure, because his father did not really care about him. Even after his game tying home run in Game 6, he waited all night for a call and did not receive one. New owners Haywood Sullivan and Buddy LeRoux hired a private detective to follow Carbo.

===Later career===
He was eventually sold to the Cleveland Indians in June 1978. This made Bill Lee mad and he called the owners &quot;gutless&quot; and staged a walkout.

His major league career ended in 1980 with the Pittsburgh Pirates. In a 12-year career, Carbo was a .264 hitter with 96 home runs and 358 RBI in 1010 games.

In 1989–90, while playing in a senior league in St. Petersburg, Florida, Carbo hit rock bottom. His mother had committed suicide, his father died two months later, and his family was disintegrating. He was spending $32,000 a month on drugs (mostly cocaine). Dalton Jones, a member of the Red Sox 1967 Impossible Dream team, took one look at Carbo and said, &quot;You need Jesus.&quot;

Carbo was the field manager for the Pensacola Pelicans from 2003 to 2005. Carbo compiled a record of 150–103 in his three seasons as the field manager, a winning percentage of .593. He led the Pelicans to the championship series in the independent Southeastern League in 2003, losing to the Baton Rouge RiverBats. Carbo resigned in February 2006, in order to return full-time to Diamond Club Ministry.

==After baseball==
After retiring, Carbo went on to cosmetology school and opened a hairdressing salon. In 1985, in a federal drug distribution trial, former Cardinal Keith Hernandez said Carbo was the man who introduced him to cocaine in 1980. Carbo subsequently lost his house and his salon because of the bad publicity.

He has since become a born again Christian. In 1993, he founded the evangelical organization &quot;Diamond Club Ministry.&quot; and now spends his time ministering to families and their children through his love for the game. He says he has not used drugs or alcohol in over fifteen years.

===Admissions to drug use===
On April 1, 2010, in an interview with the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, Carbo admitted to doing drugs during the 1975 World Series. He states, &quot;I probably smoked two joints, drank about three or four beers, got to the ballpark, took some [amphetamines], took a pain pill, drank a cup of coffee, chewed some tobacco, had a cigarette, and got up to the plate and hit.&quot; It was not just a one-time binge, however. In the same article, Carbo states, &quot;I played every game high. I was addicted to anything you could possibly be addicted to. I played the outfield sometimes where it looked like the stars were falling from the sky.&quot;

&quot;I threw away my career&quot;, said Carbo. &quot;If I knew Jesus Christ was my savior at 17, I would have been one heck of a ballplayer, a near Hall of Famer. Instead, I wanted to die.&quot;

<text>Melanie Ruth Blatt (born 25 March 1975) is an English singer. She rose to fame in 1997 as a member of the girl group All Saints. The group have gained five UK number-one singles, two multi-platinum albums and two BRIT Awards, and have sold over 10 million records worldwide.

As a solo artist, Blatt released only two singles, &quot;Do Me Wrong&quot; (2003) and &quot;See Me&quot; (2005), and recorded an unreleased album on London Records. In 2013 and 2015, she was a judge on the television series &quot;The X Factor NZ&quot;.

== Early life ==
Blatt was born at University College Hospital in the London Borough of Camden and is named after American folk singer Melanie Safka. She was born to a French mother, Hélène and a British Jewish father, David Blatt (known also as author of the book &quot;Manchester United Ruined My Wife&quot;), whose ancestors were from Poland and Russia, and a younger sister named Jasmine. She was brought up in both the UK and France. In 1986, Blatt was diagnosed as having scoliosis. Since her parents were not satisfied with the treatment for the condition in the United Kingdom they decided to move to France, where a specialist inserted three metal rods in her back. 

Blatt went to Fitzjohn&#x27;s Primary School, where her musical talent was immediately noticed by the music teacher David Joyner, who encouraged her parents to send her to a stage school. In 1986, she attended the Sylvia Young Theatre School, where she met Nicole Appleton. The two girls became best friends. During this period, Blatt also played young Éponine in for six months, and was the understudy for Cosette together with fellow Sylvia Young student Denise van Outen.

== Career ==

=== 1993–2001: Career with All Saints ===

In 1993, Blatt sang under the name Melanie Guillaume in the band Drive with Julienne Davis. They released one single, &quot;Curfew&quot;, together. She also did backing vocals for Dreadzone with Denise van Outen. Later that year, Blatt met Shaznay Lewis at the Metamorphosis recording studio in All Saints Road, London. Together, with Simone Rainford, they formed the group All Saints 1.9.7.5, which was later renamed to All Saints when Rainford left and Nicole and Natalie Appleton joined Blatt and Lewis.

In 1997 All Saints released their debut single, &quot;I Know Where It&#x27;s At&quot;, which peaked at number four in the UK. The same year the group released a second single, &quot;Never Ever&quot;, which introduced the group to international success after topping the charts in the UK and Australia, and reaching the top ten across Europe, Canada and the United States. The single sold over 1.2 million copies in the United Kingdom and was certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. The same year the group released their debut album, &quot;All Saints&quot;; it reached number two in the United Kingdom and was certified platinum five times for sales of 1.5 million. The group gained a further two number one singles the following year: &quot;Under the Bridge / Lady Marmalade&quot; and &quot;Bootie Call&quot;. In 2000 the group released new single &quot;Pure Shores&quot;, which was used in the film &quot;The Beach&quot; and reached number one in the UK. The single was certified platinum for sales over 600,000 copies. The single was followed by their fifth number one single, &quot;Black Coffee&quot;; their second album, &quot;Saints &amp; Sinners&quot;, was released shortly after and topped the chart in the United Kingdom. The album was eventually certified double platinum by the BPI for sales over 600,000. In early 2001, following the release of their single &quot;All Hooked Up&quot;, the group split and reasons for this were later explained by Shaznay Lewis, who revealed details of tensions between the group.

In 2000, Blatt appeared in the film &quot;Honest&quot; directed by Dave Stewart, opposite Nicole and Natalie Appleton, and in 2001, she played a small role in the independent British film &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;.

=== 2002–2006: Solo musical releases ===
Blatt&#x27;s solo releases were of variable success; her most prominent being &quot;TwentyFourSeven&quot;, a collaboration with the Artful Dodger, which peaked at No. 6 in September 2001. Melanie began recording on her debut solo album in 2002, working with numerous producers including Sony Music production team Xenomania. In late 2003 she released her debut single, &quot;Do Me Wrong&quot;; it reached number 18 in the UK and led to Blatt being dropped by her label due to its low charting. The album she was working on was scrapped, therefore the release of her upcoming single, &quot;Blue&quot;, was cancelled, but later included on British singer Amelia Lily&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Be a Fighter&quot;, on which she worked with Xenomania. In 2005 Blatt made a return to music with new single &quot;See Me&quot;, which was used in the &quot;Robots&quot; movie. She began working on a new album with independent label Sowlen Ankle Ltd written with, and recorded by, Matt Hales from Aqualung. During 2005, Blatt played small venues in the UK, with her setlists featuring songs from the album she was working on at the time and also unreleased songs such as &quot;In Your Arms&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Mind&quot;, &quot;Now You&#x27;re Gone&quot;, &quot;No Lullaby&quot; and &quot;Love Sweet Love&quot;. Blatt&#x27;s solo record was shelved in favour of the All Saints reunion.

=== 2006–present: All Saints reunion and television===
On 24 January 2006, it was announced that the band had reformed and signed a record deal with Parlophone. They subsequently began work on their third studio album, &quot;Studio 1&quot;. The first single, &quot;Rock Steady&quot; (released in November 2006), reached number three on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Studio 1&quot; entered the albums chart at number forty and sold 60,000 copies according to the BPI, being certified silver. A second single, &quot;Chick Fit&quot;, failed to reach the top 200. Blatt discussed the reunion&#x27;s failure in an interview with &quot;i-D&quot; magazine in 2012: &quot;I don&#x27;t think it was done for the right reasons... I know that I did it for the money. We got signed before we had even made music again, it wasn&#x27;t like we felt we had something to give back to the world... we were given an opportunity and took it, without really thinking about it too hard&quot;. She also said she never felt comfortable with the success the band had and that &quot;it was not necessarily the plan at the beginning; there was a lot of compromise involved&quot;.

From 2007–2010 Blatt worked as a presenter on the TV show &quot;The Hot Desk&quot; on ITV2 with co-hosts Nicole Appleton, Dave Berry, Emma Willis and Jayne Sharp. Between 2009 and 2010 she was as a reporter on Angela Griffin&#x27;s show &quot;Angela and Friends&quot;. In January 2013 it was announced Melanie Blatt would join Daniel Bedingfield, Stan Walker and Ruby Frost as a judge/mentor on the New Zealand version of &quot;The X Factor&quot;: &quot;I can&#x27;t wait to see what kind of artists and voices we are going to find in New Zealand.&quot; Blatt mentored the Groups category. It was reported that she and her daughter Lilyella would live in the country for the duration of the series. In February 2013, Blatt revealed she is &quot;making music&quot; and when asked about a solo comeback she said she was going to do something she never thought in a million years she would do. On 11 September 2014 MediaWorks announced both Blatt and Stan Walker would return to judge the second season of the X Factor NZ alongside returning host Dominic Bowden. Blatt and Walker would be joined by new husband-wife duo Willy Moon and Natalia Kills until their sacking, and replaced by Natalie Bassingthwaite and Shelton Woolwright. Blatt mentored the Over 25s and placed 5th with her contestant Steve Broad.

In 2014, All Saints reformed to support the Backstreet Boys for five dates across the UK and Ireland in 2014. On 27 January 2016, it was confirmed that All Saints will release their fourth studio album, &quot;Red Flag&quot;, on 8 April 2016. The lead single from the album, &quot;One Strike&quot;, preceded the album on 26 February 2016.

== Personal life ==
In 1998, Blatt married the former Jamiroquai bassist Stuart Zender. They had one child together, Lilyella, born on 20 November 1998. The couple divorced in 2006.

Groen&#x27;s father, Petrus Jacobus Groen van Prinsterer, was a physician, and at adult age operated in aristocratic circles.

He was a member of the Dutch Reformed Church, the state church of the Netherlands and of its Royal Family, although he deemed it to be in a poor condition. He was influenced by a then leading evangelical renewal movement known in the Netherlands as the &quot;Réveil,&quot; the European Continental counterpart to the Second Great Awakening.

He studied at Leiden University, and graduated in 1823 both as doctor of literature and LLD. From 1829 to 1833 he was a secretary to William II of the Netherlands. During this time he attended Brussels Protestant Church under pastor Merle d&#x27;Aubigné. After that, he took a prominent part in Dutch home politics, and becoming the leader of the Anti-Revolutionary Party, both in the Second Chamber of parliament, of which he was a member for many years, and as a political writer.

The doctrines of Guizot and Stahl influenced Groen. They permeate his controversial and political writings and historical studies, of which his &quot;Handbook of Dutch History&quot; (in Dutch) and &quot;Maurice et Barnevelt&quot; (in French, 1875, a criticism of Motley&#x27;s &quot;Life of Van Olden-Barnevelt&quot;) are the most important. Groen was ardently opposed to Thorbecke, whose principles he denounced as ungodly and revolutionary. Although Groen lived to see these principles triumph in the constitutional reforms implemented by Thorbecke, he never ceased to oppose them until his death in 1876.

==Publications==
By the time the revolutionary movement in Europe had begun to break out in various cities, the monarchist and restorationist secretary to the Dutch king began lecturing on the spiritual-political crisis of the Continent. Groen also was ready to publish. He had begun to do so with his &quot;Overview&quot; of 1831, his &quot;Essay on Truth&quot; of 1834, a manuscript harder to date precisely but entitled &quot;Studies on the revolution&quot;, his &quot;Prolegomena&quot; of 1847 (the following year Karl Marx issued the &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot;). Groen&#x27;s most influential work &quot;Lectures on Unbelief and Revolution&quot; appeared in an initial edition in 1847, and then a revised edition of 1868; there were subsequent editions as well. In time he founded an intellectual Christian political circle among the upper classes, through which Groen tried to teach the political responsibility of such people. In an effort to reach the Dutch intellectuals, he founded the daily newspaper De Nederlander from 1850 until 1855. Later on 1896, he published the weekly Nederlandsche Gedachten (Dutch Thoughts/Reflections).

He is best known as the editor of the &quot;Archives et correspondence de la maison d&#x27;Orange&quot; (12 vols, 1835-1845), which procured for him the title of the Dutch Gachard. John L. Motley acknowledges his indebtedness to Groen&#x27;s &quot;Archives&quot; in the preface to his &quot;Rise of the Dutch Republic&quot;, at a time when the American historian had not yet made the acquaintance of King William&#x27;s archivist. It also bore testimony to Groen&#x27;s influence as a writer of history in the correspondence published after his death.

At the first reception, in 1858, of Motley at the royal palace at the Hague, the king presented him with a copy of Groen&#x27;s &quot;Archives&quot; as a token of appreciation and admiration of the work done by of William I, prince of Orange. This copy, bearing the king&#x27;s autograph inscription, afterwards came into the possession of Sir William Vernon Harcourt, Motley&#x27;s son-in-law.

==Thoughts==
The translator of the Dutch political thought and influence of Groen, Harry Van Dyke, has summarized Groen&#x27;s mature view in this way:

&quot;We are living in a condition of permanent revolution... revolutions are here to stay and will grow much worse in scope and intensity unless men can be persuaded to return to Christianity, to practise its precepts and to obey the Gospel in its full implications for human life and civilized society. Barring such a revival, the future would belong to socialism and communism, which on this view were but the most consistent sects of the new secular religion. To Groen, therefore, the political spectrum that presented itself to his generation offered no meaningful choice.

&quot;In terms of his analysis, the &#x27;radical left&#x27; was composed of fanatical believers in the godless ideology; the &#x27;liberal centre,&#x27; by comparison, by warm believers who warned against excesses and preached moderation; while the &#x27;conservative right&#x27; embraced all those who lacked either the insight, the prudence, or the will to break with the modern tenets yet who recoiled from the consequences whenever the ideology was practised and implemented in any consistent way. None of the shades or &#x27;nuances of secular liberalism represented a valid option for Christian citizens.&quot; Groen called for a rejection of the entire available spectrum of political positions, calling for a &quot;radical alternative in politics, along anti-revolutionary, Christian-historical lines&quot;.

The South African scholar Jan Adriaan Schlebusch describes the basic theme of Groen&#x27;s anti-revolutionary theory as follows:

&quot;The dichotomy of revolution or rebellion against God on the one hand and faith in God on the other, was one that Groen believed to be ever-present throughout history. Groen therefore also understood this epistemic Revolution to be opposed to history, i.e. the divinely-ordained cosmic-historic telos of evangelistic progress and the glorification of the Lordship of Christ ... ‘Revolution’ for Groen was ultimately a denial of the sovereignty of God in favor of the sovereignty of mankind, with the ‘revolutionary’ ideas of the Enlightenment being the fruits of a rationalist religion wrongly elevating man-made abstractions as truths supreme over the revelation of God. This epistemic perspective shaped his political theory and engagement. Groen argued that the Revolution, not only as a historical-political phenomenon, but as a historical-philosophical development, amounted to an anti-Christian infringement upon the natural rights, established socio-political relationships, and justice system rooted in a divinely-ordained social order. Therefore the anti-revolutionary or Christian-historical position entailed opposing this epistemic Revolution as a path doomed to social disaster and political tyranny.&quot;

<text>Prince Stanisław Lubomirski (1583 – 17 June 1649) was a Polish nobleman (szlachcic).

Lubomirski was Krajczy of the Crown and Secretary of the King since 1620, voivode (military commander) of the Ruthenian Voivodeship since 1628 (or 1625?), voivode of the Kraków Voivodeship and General starost of Kraków since 1638, starost of Krzepirz, Niepołomice, Spisz, Sandomierz, Sącz and Zator. Since 1640 (or 1647) prince of the Holy Roman Empire.

In 1609 he took part in the Siege of Smoleńsk by sponsoring several military units, which he used to keep order (and enforce his will) in the Kraków Voivodeship (his units defeated Lisowczycy after this mercenary band started pillaging Kraków areas in the 1620s). After the death of Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, in the rank of regimentarz he commanded the Polish forces during the battle of Chocim in 1621 (see Moldavian Magnate Wars). In 1634 Lubomirski was second in command in Ukraine, after Stanisław Koniecpolski, and in 1635 he befriended a French negotiator at the Treaty of Sztumska Wieś, Claude de Mesmes, Count Avaux.

Lubomirski was a pious Catholic, a sponsor and beneficiary of many churches, although he disliked the Society of Jesus. He opposed plans to marry Władysław IV Waza to a Calvinist princess. He also opposed Władyslaw&#x27;s idea of &quot;Kawaleria Orderowa&quot; and his plans to wage war on Ottomans. Lubomirski was a friend of Jerzy Zbarski, a popular politician in Sandomierz and Kraków voivodeships, considered friendly but known to lose his temper and was several times elected as a deputy to the Sejm.

Lubomirski inherited a large estate from his father and multiplied it by a marriage with Zofia Ostrogska in 1613. They had five children together: Aleksander Michał, Jerzy Sebastian, Konstanty Jacek, Konstancja and Anna Krystyna. By 1642 he owned 10 castles, 12 towns, 300 villages and many forests, lakes, mills and even private salt mines, making him one of the wealthiest magnates in Poland of his time.

<text>Lars Fredrik Nilson (27 May 1840 – 14 May 1899) was a Swedish chemist, professor at Uppsala University, and later Director of the Agricultural Chemical Experiment Station at the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry in Stockholm. 

He discovered the element scandium in 1879, by separating out scandium(III) oxide, also known as scandia. In addition to his work concerning the analytic chemistry of elements and rare earths, he made substantial contributions to Swedish agriculture, including methods of fertilization and the introduction of sugar beets as a crop.

==Education==
Nilson was born in Skönberga parish in Östergötland, Sweden. Later his family relocated to the island of Gotland, where his father, Nikolaus, owned the farm Rosendal in Follingbo. During later life, Lars Fredrik Nilson retained a small holding on Gotland, which he visited yearly.

After graduating from Wisby high school on Gotland, Lars Fredrik Nilson enrolled at Uppsala University in 1859. There he studied the natural sciences including zoology and biology. His work in mineralogy was noted by the chemistry professor at Uppsala, Lars Fredrik Svanberg, a former student of Jöns Jakob Berzelius.

To obtain a Doctorate of Philosophy in Sweden, the candidate was expected to pass a series of examinations in all areas of study, including languages, history, and philosophy as well as their main area of study, within a fixed period of time. In 1865, just before Nilson could complete his final examination, his father became severely ill. Nilson returned home to Gotland, where he assumed management of the farm, working in the fields as needed. When his father recovered some months later, the harvest and autumn planting had been completed successfully, and Nilson had installed the first engine threshing machine to be used in Gotland. Nilson&#x27;s own health had greatly benefited from his work on the farm: the young man who had arrived home in poor health had become much stronger. He was able to return to Uppsala and pass the next season&#x27;s examinations, becoming a doctor of chemistry in 1866.

==Career==
In 1866, Nilson became an associate professor of chemistry at Uppsala, with the responsibilities of chief assistant and demonstrator of chemistry for Svanberg&#x27;s laboratory. He was a calm and patient teacher, relying more on demonstrations than on lectures. He insisted that after the work of the day was completed, it was to be left behind, and not discussed during leisure. His earliest papers mainly concerned sulfides, arsenical sulfosalt minerals, and selenous acid, extending the work of Berzelius. 

===Elements===
In 1874 Nilson became professor of general and agricultural chemistry at Uppsala.
From then on he could devote more time to research. He began working on rare earths such as euxenite and gadolinite, using methods of successive fractionation introduced by Nils Johan Berlin. One of his goals was to better understand the relationship of the newly discovered elements to the proposed periodic system. 


In 1879 Nilson separated out the oxide scandia. By doing so he discovered a new element, scandium, which he named for Scandinavia. The discovery was of particular importance because the existence of an element with such properties, &quot;ekaboron&quot;, had been predicted by Mendeleev, based on his organization of the periodic system. 
Nilson&#x27;s spectral analysis indicated a previously unreported pattern of lines. Per Theodor Cleve demonstrated the equivalence of Nilson&#x27;s scandium and Mendeleev&#x27;s hypothetical ekaboron.

Nilson and Sven Otto Pettersson were the first to isolate titanium metal in a relatively pure form, extracting a 95% pure sample in 1887. Jöns Jacob Berzelius had extracted titanium metal in 1825, but only in a very impure form. 
In 1910 Matthew Hunter was finally able to produce 99.9% pure titanium metal, through his new Hunter process.

Nilson also studied the gas density of metals which made it possible to determine the valence of various metals.

===Agriculture===
Nilson was professor of analytical chemistry at Uppsala from 1878 until 1883, when he became professor of chemistry of the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry in Stockholm. As an agricultural chemist and Director of the Agricultural Chemical Experiment Station, he published nearly sixty papers concerning topics such as soils and manures. As a result of his inquiries many of the swamps of Gotland were drained and cultivated. The sugar beet was introduced and became a major crop, as chalky moors were treated with potash fertilizers.
He also conducted studies of cow&#x27;s milk and various plants for cattle fodder.

Nilson was elected a foreign member of the Chemical Society of Great Britain on February 2, 1888.
Nilson was a member of several other academies as well. He received several awards, including the Order of the Polar Star.

<text>The Others () is a 2001 gothic supernatural psychological horror film written, directed and scored by Alejandro Amenábar, starring Nicole Kidman, Fionnula Flanagan, Christopher Eccleston, Elaine Cassidy, Eric Sykes, Alakina Mann and James Bentley. Set in 1945 in Jersey, it focuses on a woman and her two young photosensitive children who experience supernatural phenomena in their large manor after the arrival of new servants.

The film was theatrically released in the United States on August 10, 2001, by Dimension Films, and in Spain on September 7, 2001, by Warner Sogefilms. It was a major box-office success, grossing $210 million worldwide on a $17 million budget, and received positive reviews from critics, who praised Amenábar&#x27;s screenplay and direction, as well as the atmosphere and performances of the cast (particularly Kidman). At the 16th Goya Awards, the film earned a leading fifteen nominations and won in eight categories, including Best Film, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay. It was the first English-language film without a single word of Spanish dialogue to be awarded Best Film at Spain&#x27;s Goya Awards.

&quot;The Others&quot; also received six nominations at the 28th Saturn Awards, winning three: Best Horror Film, Best Actress (for Kidman), and Best Supporting Actress (for Flanagan). It garnered nominations for Best Actress in a Leading Role (for Kidman) and Best Original Screenplay at the 55th British Academy Film Awards, and for Best Film at the 14th European Film Awards. Kidman was additionally nominated for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama at the 59th Golden Globe Awards.

==Plot==
In 1945, Grace Stewart resides in a remote country house in Jersey, a Channel Island formerly occupied by the Germans, with her two young children, Anne and Nicholas, both of whom suffer from a severe sensitivity to light. Because of this, Grace keeps the home darkened with heavy curtains. One day, Mrs. Bertha Mills, Edmund Tuttle, and the mute Lydia arrive, all seeking employment. Grace hires them as the housekeeper, gardener, and maid, and is pleased to learn the three worked in the same house years prior.

Anne claims to be regularly visited by a young boy named Victor, his parents, and an elderly blind woman. Grace believes this to be a fantasy, but after she begins hearing footsteps and disembodied voices herself, she orders the house to be searched, believing there are intruders inside. In a storage room, she finds a nineteenth-century photo album containing photographs of corpses. Mrs. Mills recounts that many left in 1891 due to an outbreak of tuberculosis. Grace begins to fear that there are supernatural entities in the house, but struggles to reconcile such things with her rigid Catholic faith.

At night, Grace witnesses a piano playing itself and becomes convinced that the house is haunted. She runs outside in search of the local priest to bless the house and instructs Tuttle to check the nearby cemetery to see if a family has been buried there. Tuttle covers gravestones on the grounds with leaves at the order of Mrs. Mills. In the woods, Grace runs into her husband Charles, whom she believed to have been killed in the war. Charles acts very distant during his short stay at the house, presumably suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his service in the war.

One day, Grace checks on Anne playing. To her horror, she instead finds an old woman wearing her daughter&#x27;s communion dress who speaks in Anne&#x27;s voice. Grace attacks the old woman, only to find that she has inadvertently attacked her own daughter. Charles informs Grace he must return to the front, rejecting her insistence that the war is over.

The next morning, Charles departs, and Grace is horrified to find all of the curtains in the house have been removed, exposing Anne and Nicholas to the sunlight. She accuses the servants of doing this and expels them from the house. That night, the children discover that the headstones in the cemetery belong to the trio of servants, and flee when they see the servants approaching them. Grace finds a postmortem photograph of Mrs. Mills, Tuttle and Lydia, who all perished during a tuberculosis outbreak more than fifty years prior. Mrs. Mills tells Grace to talk to the &quot;intruders&quot;.

Grace discovers that the elderly blind woman is in fact a medium holding a séance with Victor&#x27;s parents, who have discovered via automatic writing that Grace, despondent after Charles died in the war, smothered her children with a pillow before committing suicide. Aghast, Grace realizes that &quot;the others&quot; in the house are the living family living in &quot;their&quot; house, and that like the servants, she, Anne, and Nicholas are spirits haunting the house and causing the supernatural activity.

Embracing her children, Grace admits to her act of murder–suicide: she had awoken afterward and believed that God had brought everyone back to life after the murder took place. Following the supernatural activity in the house caused by Grace and her children, Victor and his family move out. Anne and Nicholas realize they are no longer afflicted by the sunlight as they had been in life. The house goes up for sale again and Mrs. Mills informs the Stewarts that they will have to learn to cohabit with the living residents, only for Grace to ominously state that the house is only theirs.

==Cast==

==Production==
Filming locations included Palacio de los Hornillos in Las Fraguas, Cantabria, northern Spain, and Madrid.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;The Others&quot; was first released in the United States and Canada by Dimension Films, opening on August 10, 2001 in 1,678 theaters. It grossed $14 million its opening weekend, ranking fourth at the U.S. box office behind &quot;American Pie 2&quot;, &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; and &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;. It stayed in fourth place for three more weeks, expanding to more theaters. During the weekend of September 21 to 23, it was second at the box office, grossing $5 million in 2,801 theaters. The film, which cost $17 million to produce, eventually grossed $96.5 million in the United States and Canada. It grossed $24 million in Spain, becoming the highest-grossing Spanish film of all time, beating the record set earlier that year by &quot;Torrente 2: Misión en Marbella&quot;. It grossed $113.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $210 million.

===Critical response===

A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated, &quot;&quot;The Others&quot; is a flawed if interesting vehicle. The anxious indeterminacy of the first section proves hard to sustain, and as Mr. Amenábar moves away from elegant minimalism, the story begins to become cluttered and confusing, rather than spare and enigmatic.&quot; Scott highlighted Kidman&#x27;s performance, writing that she &quot;embodies this unstable amalgam with a conviction that is in itself terrifying. The icy reserve that sometimes stands in the way of her expressive gifts here becomes the foundation of her most emotionally layered performance to date.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars out of four, praising that &quot;...Alejandro Amenábar has the patience to create a languorous, dreamy atmosphere, and Nicole Kidman succeeds in convincing us that she is a normal person in a disturbing situation and not just a standard-issue horror movie hysteric&quot;. However, he noted that &quot;in drawing out his effects, Amenábar is a little too confident that style can substitute for substance&quot;.

Neil Smith of the BBC awarded the film four out of five stars, writing: &quot;Shot in oppressive sepia amid near-darkness (Grace&#x27;s children having a rare ailment that precludes exposure to sunlight), Amenábar racks up the tension to unbearable levels.&quot; &quot;Time Out&quot; praised the film as &quot;confident and controlled... Absence makes the heart beat faster: the absence of light, the corporeal absence of loved ones. Shrewdly cast, Kidman is pitch perfect. It&#x27;s a clammy, ingenious film, one of the best studio movies of the year.&quot;

Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; cited Kidman&#x27;s performance as the film&#x27;s greatest strength, writing that she &quot;has thrown herself into her role as if it were Lady Macbeth on the London stage, with formidable results. Though Kidman doesn&#x27;t hesitate to make Grace high-strung and as tightly wound as they come, she also projects vulnerability and courage when they&#x27;re called for. It&#x27;s an intense, involving performance, and it dominates and energizes a film that would be lost without it.&quot;

Although the film deals primarily with the spiritual interaction of ghosts with each other rather than with living humans, William Skidelsky of &quot;The Observer&quot; has suggested that it was inspired by the 1898 novella &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;, written by Henry James.

===Accolades===
===Home media===
On 14 May 2002, Buena Vista Home Entertainment released a two-disc collector&#x27;s edition DVD. On 20 September 2011, Lionsgate released the film on Blu-ray. In July 2023, The Criterion Collection announced a forthcoming 4K UHD Blu-ray edition of the film scheduled for release on 24 October 2023. StudioCanal concurrently announced distribution for a 4K UHD Blu-ray in Europe.

==Planned remake==
In April 2020, Sentient Entertainment acquired the remake rights to &quot;The Others&quot;, with the company planning to revamp the film by setting it in the present day. Later that year, it was announced that Universal Pictures will co-produce and distribute the film with Sentient.

<doc id="1267716" wikidata="Q2293194" url="?curid=1267716" title="Toto (Oz)">
<text>Toto is a fictional dog in L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;Oz&quot; series of children&#x27;s books, and works derived from them. He was originally a small terrier drawn by W. W. Denslow for the first edition of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900). He reappears in later Oz books and in numerous adaptations, such as &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939) and &quot;The Wiz&quot; (1978). 

==Books==
===The classic books===

Toto belongs to Dorothy Gale, the heroine of the first and many subsequent books. In the first book, he never spoke, although other animals, native to Oz, did. In subsequent books, other animals gained the ability to speak upon reaching Oz or similar lands, but he remained speechless. In &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot;, continuity is restored: he reveals that he is able to talk, just like other animals in the Land of Oz, and simply chooses not to. In &quot;The Lost Princess of Oz&quot;, he often talks continuously. Other major appearances include &quot;The Road to Oz&quot;, &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot;, &quot;Grampa in Oz&quot; and &quot;The Magical Mimics in Oz&quot;, in which he is the first to recognize the Mimics. 

In &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, Baum did not specifically state Toto&#x27;s breed, but wrote &quot;he was a little black dog with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his funny, wee nose.&quot; However, from the illustrations in the first book many have concluded that he is a Cairn Terrier while others believe he is a Yorkshire Terrier as this breed was very popular at the time and it fits the illustration quite well.In subsequent books he becomes a Boston Terrier for reasons that are never explained, but then resumes the earlier look in later books.

Toto plays a central role in several critical points: he runs away at the beginning and end of the book and Dorothy changes plans to catch him; he pulls away the curtain to reveal the Wizard is a fake. Scholar Keri Weil analyzes the role: Toto is the driving force behind Frank Baum’s narrative because it is Dorothy’s love for the dog that leads her to run away and escape the dreary moral landscape of Kansas and its arbiter, Miss Gulch. “It was Toto who made Dorothy laugh and saved her from growing as grey as her surroundings,” wrote Baum in the original version of the story. 

===Later works===
In Gregory Maguire&#x27;s novel &quot;&quot;, Toto is a minor character who is only described as being vile and annoying. In the musical adaption &quot;Wicked&quot;, he is only mentioned briefly when Glinda mistakenly calls him &quot;Dodo&quot;.

Michael Morpurgo published &quot;Toto: The Wizard of Oz as told by the dog&quot; in 2020.

==Films==
===Terry and the MGM film===

In the 1939 movie &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, Toto was played by a female brindle Cairn Terrier named Terry. She was paid a $125 salary each week, which was more than some of the human actors (the Singer Midgets who played the Munchkins reportedly received $50 to $100 a week).
During production, Terry&#x27;s foot was broken when one of the Winkie guards accidentally stepped on it. A second dog had to be used while she healed. Due to the popularity of the movie, and because that role was the one she was most remembered for, her owner and trainer changed her official name to Toto. She actually appeared in 13 films. She died at age 11. Willard Carroll wrote her &quot;autobiography,&quot; &quot;I, Toto&quot; (2001).

When Terry died in 1945, Carl Spitz buried her on his ranch in Studio City, California. However, the construction of the Ventura Freeway in 1958 destroyed her grave. On June 18, 2011, a permanent memorial for her was dedicated at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles.

===Later film versions===

* In Disney&#x27;s 1985 movie &quot;Return to Oz&quot;, Toto was played by a female Border Terrier named Tansy.
* The 1978 movie version of &quot;The Wiz&quot; featured a dark gray Schnauzer as Toto.
* Toto appears in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; cartoon with his vocal effects provided by Frank Welker.
* In ABC&#x27;s telefilm &quot;The Muppets&#x27; Wizard of Oz&quot;, he is played by Pepe the King Prawn.
* In 1996 an animated series &quot;The Oz Kids&quot;, Dot and Neddie have a puppy named Toto 2 who is named after him. One of the episodes says it is a female.
* In the &quot;VeggieTales&quot; episode &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Has&quot;, he is replaced by a pig named &quot;Tutu&quot;.
* In the Sci-Fi Channel miniseries &quot;Tin Man&quot;, he is portrayed as a shape-shifting human. He was originally the tutor of DG and her sister, and his name of &quot;Toto&quot; came from DG&#x27;s childhood inability to say &quot;Tutor&quot;. He was played by Blu Mankuma.
* Toto also appears in the film &quot;Inkheart&quot;. In it, Silvertongues have the ability to bring a character from book to life by saying the words loud and clear.

He helps defeat the evil shadow monster as well.
* In the Disney Channel original movie &quot;The Cheetah Girls&quot; the main character has a dog named Toto. This name is given to him most likely because one of the characters is named Dorothea (Dorothy). However, this dog is a Bichon Frise instead of a black Cairn Terrier.
* Toto appeared in &quot;Dorothy and the Witches of Oz&quot;. He lived with Dorothy even when she was invited to New York City to get her books published.
* Toto appeared in &quot;Legends of Oz: Dorothy&#x27;s Return&quot;.
* Toto is a German Shepherd in NBC&#x27;s television series &quot;Emerald City&quot;. Initially a police dog that was in the police car Dorothy retreated to during the initial tornado that sent her to Oz, he is subsequently &quot;adopted&quot; by her in her journey through Oz. His name in Kansas is unknown, but he is named by Dorothy after the Munja&#x27;kin word for &quot;dog&quot;.
* Toto appears in the TV series &quot;Lost in Oz&quot;, voiced by Chris Cox.
* Toto appears in the TV series &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz&quot;.
* Toto appears in &quot;The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part&quot;. Alongside Dorothy and her friends, Toto found himself somehow transported from the Land of Oz to Harmony Town in the Systar System. 
* On July 12, 2018, it was announced that Warner Animation Group will produce an animated film about Toto. It will be based on the children&#x27;s book &quot;&quot;. The film was originally scheduled to be theatrically released on February 2, 2024 in the United States. On April 5, 2023, it was taken off the release schedule with &quot;The Alto Knights&quot; taking over its original release date, which also moved off that date by October 2023.
* Although not a direct adaptation to the literature itself, the 2013 Super Sentai series, &quot;Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger&quot; features the Deboth Army&#x27;s members being themed after the characters in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. Ferocious Knight D is designed with the motif of Toto.
* In the Alphablocks special The Wizard of Az, O has the role of Toto as “O-O”.

==Influence==

The inspiration for the name Toto is the small town of Toto, Indiana, near the Baum family cottage at Bass Lake.

Toto has been widely recognized as one of the most famous of all dogs in movies and television. For example &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2015 includes Toto in &quot;The Most Famous Dogs in Movies and Television&quot;. Also in England, Neil Oliver. writes in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; that 2020 has been. ”A tornado of anxieties...Like Toto, the little dog in The Wizard of Oz, we find ourselves far from home. I&#x27;ve a feeling we&#x27;re not in Kansas any more. Also like Toto, no one understands our small voices. In this incomprehensible new place, we are to be silent while others speak.&quot; The last point emphasizes how important it is to be a quiet observer.

Members of the American rock band Toto have said the band was named after the dog. Though it was perhaps the original source for the name appearing on their demo tapes, they chose their name based upon the meaning of the Latin word &quot;toto&quot; (&quot;all-encompassing&quot;).

TOTO is a backronym for &#x27;TOtable Tornado Observatory&#x27;, adapted from the name of Dorothy&#x27;s dog from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. It is an &quot;in situ&quot; instrument for recording data from tornadoes.

<text>The Pernicious Enigma is the second studio album by the British doom metal band Esoteric. It was released in 1997 through Aesthetic Death Records. &quot;The Pernicious Enigma&quot; comprises two discs with a total running time of an hour and 55 minutes.

The album has received much praise since its release, and is seen as one of the band&#x27;s best works. It has been cited to have helped influence the funeral doom and death-doom genres. The album would later be remastered and released as a three-disc vinyl set in 2016, limited to only 600 copies. A CD edition based on this remaster was issued in 2018.

==Production==
The album was recorded at Rich Bitch Studios during the month of July 1996 and was mixed in October the same year, starting on the 9th and ending on the 15th. Mixing duties were held by the band itself, while the production and engineering featured the band being assisted by Steve Wilson. Anthony Brewer was hired as a session drummer to record on a few tracks on the album. The album was mastered at Strype Audio Studios, Oslo, Norway by Tom Kvalsvoll. The track &quot;NOXBC9701040&quot; was improvised in studio on 21 July 1996.

For the remaster, the album was mixed and mastered by Greg Chandler in 2015. Kevin Metcalfe also helped cut the lacquer used for the record manufacturing for the album at Soundmasters, London, United Kingdom.

<doc id="1267726" wikidata="Q1534616" url="?curid=1267726" title="Gold Key Comics">
<text>Gold Key Comics was an imprint of American company Western Publishing, created for comic books distributed to newsstands. Also known as Whitman Comics, Gold Key operated from 1962 to 1984.

==History==
Gold Key Comics was created in 1962, when its parent, Western Publishing Company, switched to in-house publishing rather than packaging content for branding and distribution by its business partner, Dell Comics. Hoping to make their comics more like traditional children&#x27;s books, they initially eliminated panel line-borders, using just the panel, with its ink and artwork evenly edged, but not bordered by a &quot;container&quot; line. Within a year, they had reverted to using inked panel borders and oval balloons. They experimented with new formats, including &quot;Whitman Comic Book&quot;, a black-and-white, 136-page, hardcover series consisting of reprints, and &quot;Golden Picture Story Book&quot;, a tabloid-sized, 52-page, hardcover containing new material. In 1967, Gold Key reprinted a number of selected issues of their comics under the title &quot;Top Comics&quot;. They were packaged in plastic bags containing five comics each and were sold at gas stations and various eateries. Like Dell, Gold Key was one of the few major American comic book publishers never to display the Comics Code Authority seal on its covers, trading instead on the reputation of its child-friendly stories.

===Properties===
Gold Key featured a number of licensed properties and several original titles, including a number of publications that were spun off from Dell&#x27;s &quot;Four Color&quot; series, or were published as stand-alone titles. Gold Key maintained decent sales numbers throughout the 1960s, due to its offering of many titles based upon popular TV series of the day, as well as numerous titles based on both Walt Disney Studios and Warner Bros. animated properties. It was also the first company to publish comic books based upon the then current NBC TV series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. While some titles, such as &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, were published for many years, many other licensed titles were characterized by short runs, sometimes publishing no more than one or two issues. Gold Key considered suing over the similarly themed television series &quot;Lost in Space&quot; for its resemblance to the preexisting &quot;Space Family Robinson&quot;, but decided their business relationship with CBS and Irwin Allen was more important than any monetary reward resulting from such a suit; as a result, the Gold Key series adopted the branding &quot;Space Family Robinson Lost in Space&quot; with issue #15 (Jan. 1966), though its narrative had no connection to the TV series.

Editor Chase Craig stated that Gold Key would launch titles with Hanna-Barbera characters with direct adaptations of episodes of the program because &quot;[t]he studio had approval rights and the people there could get pointlessly picky about the material ... but they rarely bothered looking at any issue after the first few. Therefore, it simplified the procedure to do the first and maybe the second issue as an adaptation. They couldn&#x27;t very well complain that a plot taken from the show was inappropriate&quot;.

Over the years, Gold Key lost several properties, including the King Features Syndicate characters (Popeye, Flash Gordon, The Phantom, etc.), to Charlton Comics in 1966, numerous, but not all, Hanna-Barbera characters also to Charlton Comics in 1970, and &quot;Star Trek&quot; to Marvel Comics in 1979.

===Creators===
The stable of writers and artists built up by Western Publishing during the Dell Comics era mostly continued into the Gold Key era. In the mid-1960s, a number of artists were recruited by the newly formed Disney Studio Program and thereafter divided their output between the Disney Program and Western. Writer/artist Russ Manning and editor Chase Craig launched the &quot;Magnus, Robot Fighter&quot; science-fiction series in 1963. Jack Sparling co-created the superhero Tiger Girl with Jerry Siegel in 1968, drew the toyline tie-in &quot;Microbots&quot; one-shot, and illustrated comic book adaptations of the television series &quot;Family Affair&quot; and &quot;Adam-12&quot;. Dan Spiegle worked on &quot;Space Family Robinson&quot;, &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;, &quot;The Invaders&quot;, &quot;Korak, Son of Tarzan&quot;, &quot;Brothers of the Spear&quot;, and many of Gold Key&#x27;s mystery/occult titles. Among the other creators at Gold Key were writers Donald F. Glut, Len Wein, Bob Ogle, John David Warner, Steve Skeates, and Mark Evanier; and artists Cliff Voorhees, Joe Messerli, Carol Lay, Jesse Santos, and Mike Royer. Glut created and wrote several series including &quot;The Occult Files of Dr. Spektor&quot;, &quot;Dagar the Invincible&quot;, and &quot;Tragg and the Sky Gods&quot;. Also in the 1970s, writer Bob Gregory started drawing stories, mostly for &quot;Daisy and Donald&quot;. Artist/writer Frank Miller had his first published comic book artwork in &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; for Gold Key in 1978.

Diana Gabaldon began her career writing for Gold Key, initially sending a query that stated, &quot;I’ve been reading your comics for the last 25 years, and they’ve been getting worse and worse. I’m not sure if I could do better myself, but I’d like to try.&quot; Editor Del Connell provided a script sample and bought her second submission.

According to former Western Publishing writer Mark Evanier, during the mid-1960s, comedy writer Jerry Belson, whose writing partner at the time was Garry Marshall, also did scripts for Gold Key while writing for leading TV sitcoms like &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;. Among the comics for which he wrote were &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot;, &quot;Daffy Duck&quot;, &quot;Bugs Bunny&quot;, &quot;The Three Stooges&quot;, and &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot;.

Leo Dorfman, creator of &quot;Ghosts&quot; for DC Comics, also produced supernatural stories for Gold Key&#x27;s similarly themed &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe it or Not&quot;, &quot;Boris Karloff Tales of Mystery&quot;, and &quot;Grimm&#x27;s Ghost Stories&quot;. One of Gold Key&#x27;s editors at the time told Mark Evanier, &quot;Leo writes stories and then he decides whether he&#x27;s going to sell them to DC [for &quot;Ghosts&quot;] or to us. He tells us that if they come out good, they go to us and if they don&#x27;t, they go to DC. I assume he tells DC the opposite.&quot;

Editor Frank Tedeschi, who left in 1973 for a job in book publishing, helped bring in such new comics professionals as Walt Simonson, Gerry Boudreau, and John David Warner.

===Later years===
During the 1970s, the entire comics industry experienced a downswing and Gold Key was among the hardest hit. Its editorial policies had not kept pace with the changing times, and suffered an erosion of its base of sales among children, who instead of buying comic books, could now watch cartoons and other entertainment on television for free. It is also alleged by Carmine Infantino that in the mid to late 1960s, DC Comics attempted to pressure Gold Key from the comics business through sheer volume of output. Among the original titles launched by Gold Key in the 1970s were &quot;Baby Snoots&quot; and &quot;Wacky Witch&quot;. By 1977, many of the company&#x27;s series had been cancelled and the surviving titles featured more reprinted material, although Gold Key was able to obtain the rights to publish a comic book series based upon &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot; between 1979 and 1981. It also lost the rights to publish &quot;Star Trek&quot;-based comic books to Marvel Comics just prior to the revival of the franchise via &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, with the final Gold Key-published &quot;Star Trek&quot; title being issued in March, 1979.

In this period, Gold Key experimented with digests with some success. In a similar manner, to explore new markets in the mid-1970s, it produced a four-volume series, with somewhat better production values and printing aimed at the emerging collector market, containing classic stories of the Disney characters by Carl Barks and Floyd Gottfredson (&quot;Best of Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics&quot;). In the late 1970s, somewhat higher-grade reprints of various licensed characters were also aimed at new venues (&quot;Dynabrites&quot;), plus &quot;Starstream&quot;, a four-issue series adapting classic science fiction stories by authors such as Isaac Asimov and John W. Campbell. Golden Press released trade paperback reprint collections such as &quot;Walt Disney Christmas Parade&quot;, &quot;Bugs Bunny Comics-Go-Round&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek: The Enterprise Logs&quot;.

In the late 1970s, the distribution of comic books on spinners and racks at newsstands, drug stores, and supermarkets continued, but Western Publishing also sold packages of three comics in a plastic bag to toy and department stores, gas stations, airports, and bus/train stations, &quot;as well as other outlets that weren&#x27;t conducive to conventional comic racks&quot;. The newsstand comics were returnable; the dealer could return unsold copies to the distributor for a refund, but the bagged comics were not. To discourage unscrupulous dealers from opening the plastic bags and returning the nonreturnable issues, Western published the newsstand versions under the Gold Key Comics label, and put the Whitman Comics logo on the bagged versions, although otherwise the issues were identical.

Western, at one point, also distributed bagged comics from its rival DC Comics under the Whitman logo, as well as that of Marvel Comics, with its diamond (before the direct market even arrived). Former DC Comics executive Paul Levitz stated, &quot;[The] Western program was enormous — even well into the 1970s, they were taking very large numbers of DC titles for distribution (I recall 50,000+ copies offhand).&quot;

In 1979, Western ceased to be an independent company when Mattel Inc. purchased the company. The new management stopped selling returnable comics at newsstands, preferring the nonreturnable bagged comics sold at toy stores.

In a 1993 interview, Del Connell, the managing editor at Western&#x27;s West Coast office in the late 1970s, recalled,

Eventually, arrangements were made to distribute these releases to the nascent national network of comic-book stores. Western also prepared a prospectus in the early 1980s for a deluxe Carl Barks reprint project aimed at the collector market that was never published.

In December 1983, a struggling Mattel sold Western Publishing to real-estate investor Richard A. Bernstein. Bernstein closed Western&#x27;s comic-book publishing division in 1984.

===Relaunches, reprints, and legacy===
Three of Gold Key&#x27;s original characters, Magnus, Robot Fighter, Doctor Solar, and Turok, Son of Stone, were used in the 1990s to launch Valiant Comics&#x27; fictional universe.

Dark Horse Comics (and later, Dynamite Entertainment) have published reprints, including several in hardcover collections, of such original Gold Key titles as &quot;Magnus, Robot Fighter&quot;; &quot;Doctor Solar&quot;; &quot;Mighty Samson&quot;; &quot;M.A.R.S. Patrol&quot;; &quot;Turok: Son of Stone&quot;; &quot;The Occult Files of Doctor Spektor&quot;; &quot;Dagar the Invincible&quot;; &quot;Boris Karloff&#x27;s Tales of Mystery&quot;; &quot;Space Family Robinson&quot;; &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;; the Jesse Marsh drawn &quot;Tarzan&quot;;
 and some of the Russ Manning-produced &quot;Tarzan&quot; series. They started several revivals of characters under Jim Shooter, including &quot;Doctor Solar&quot;, &quot;Magnus&quot;, &quot;Turok&quot;, and 
&quot;Mighty Samson&quot;. The Checker Book Publishing Group, in conjunction with Paramount Pictures, began reprinting the Gold Key &quot;Star Trek&quot; series in 2004. Hermes Press reprinted the three series based on Irwin Allen&#x27;s science-fiction TV series, as well as Gold Key&#x27;s &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot;, and the Phantom.

Bongo Comics published a parody of Gold Key in &quot;Radioactive Man&quot; #106 (volume 2 #6, Nov. 2002) with script/layout by Batton Lash and finished art by Mike DeCarlo that Tony Isabella dubbed &quot;a nigh-flawless facsimile of the Gold Key comics published by Western in the early 1960s...from the painting with tasteful come-on copy on the front cover to the same painting, sans logo or other type, presented as a &quot;pin-up&quot; on the back cover&quot;.

In June 2001, DIC Entertainment announced they would purchase Golden Books Family Entertainment for million (equivalent to $ million in ) and take it out of bankruptcy. However, DIC would pass off the purchase due to high costs and instead Golden Books Family Entertainment was eventually acquired jointly by Classic Media, owner of the catalog of United Productions of America, and book publisher Random House in a bankruptcy auction for the lower $84.4million (equivalent to $ million in ) on August 16, 2001. In turn, Random House, and Classic Media gained ownership of Golden Books&#x27; entertainment catalog (including the family entertainment catalog of Broadway Video which includes the pre-1974 library of Rankin/Bass Productions and the library of Total Television), as well as production, licensing, and merchandising rights for Golden Books&#x27; characters and the Gold Key Comics catalogs, while Random House gained Golden Books&#x27; book publishing properties. Random House had previously acquired Dell Publishing through a series of mergers since 1976, effectively reuniting the remnants Gold Key Comics and Dell Comics.

On July 23, 2012, Classic Media was acquired by DreamWorks Animation for $155million (equivalent to $ million in ) and renamed DreamWorks Classics. On July 1, 2013, Random House merged with the Penguin Group, forming a new company called Penguin Random House. In April 2016, the acquisition of DreamWorks Animation (owner of DreamWorks Classics) by NBCUniversal was announced.

In 2021, comics creator and hacker Robert Willis obtained a trademark registration for a logo identical to the original Gold Key logo. Later that year the trademark registration was purchased by the newly-formed Gold Key Entertainment LLC. Gold Key Entertainment LLC consists of comic book enthusiasts Lance Linderman, Adam Brooks, Mike Dynes, and Arnold Guerrero. Linderman describes trading a copy of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #1 to Willis for the rights to Gold Key, in a YouTube interview with Carlos Collects Comics. Gold Key Entertainment is currently working with creators to produce new titles.

<text>Tricia Marie &quot;Shaznay&quot; Lewis (born 14 October 1975) is an English singer and songwriter. Lewis rose to fame as a member of the girl group All Saints which she formed with Melanie Blatt in 1993. As a member of All Saints, Lewis won two Brit Awards and an Ivor Novello Award, and co-wrote three of the group&#x27;s five UK number-one singles: &quot;Never Ever&quot;, &quot;Bootie Call&quot; and &quot;Pure Shores&quot;. In 2002, Lewis starred in the film &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot;.

Lewis launched her solo career with the release of her debut album &quot;Open&quot; in 2004. It entered the UK Albums Chart at number 22 and spawned the UK top 10 single &quot;Never Felt Like This Before&quot;. Lewis&#x27; second album, &quot;Pages&quot;, was released on 17 May 2024.

== Career ==

=== 1993–2001: All Saints ===
At a party, Lewis was introduced by friends to Ben Volpeliere-Pierrot of Curiosity Killed the Cat, who took her to the Metamorphosis recording studios on All Saints Road, London, where she started doing backing vocals. It was at the Metamorphosis recording studios where she met Melanie Blatt in 1993 and they proceeded to record together. Together with Simone Rainford they formed the group All Saints 1.9.7.5., which was later renamed All Saints. Soon after, Rainford left the group and Nicole and Natalie Appleton joined.

In 1997, All Saints experienced international success with BRIT Award-winning single &quot;Never Ever&quot;, which is co-written by Lewis and topped the charts in the United Kingdom and Australia. The single sold over 1.2 million copies in the United Kingdom, being certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. The same year, the group released their debut album &quot;All Saints&quot;. Most of the songs were co-written by Lewis and the album reached number two in the United Kingdom. It was eventually certified platinum five times for sales of 1.5 million copies. In 2000 the group released their fourth number one single &quot;Pure Shores&quot;, written by Lewis and William Orbit; the single was certified platinum by the BPI for sales of 600,000 copies. The group released their fifth number one single &quot;Black Coffee&quot;, which was certified silver for sales of 200,000 copies.

In early 2001, All Saints broke up and Lewis began work on her solo career. The same year she won the Ivor Novello Award for best songwriting.

=== 2002–2004: &quot;Open&quot; ===
In 2004, it was reported that Lewis would release her debut solo single &quot;Never Felt Like This Before&quot; on 5 July, which would precede her untitled debut solo album on which she&#x27;d worked with numerous writers and producers including: Basement Jaxx, Biz Markie, K-Gee, Bacon and Quarmby and Trevor Jackson. The single reached no. 8 in the United Kingdom. On 19 July she released her debut album &quot;Open&quot;, and it reached no. 22 in the United Kingdom. Later that year she released new single &quot;You&quot;, which peaked at no. 56 in the United Kingdom.

Lewis has also appeared in several films including a role as Mel in the BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot; (2002). She also played a role in &quot;Hideous Man&quot; (2002). On 14 November 2004 Lewis was involved in the Band Aid 20 re-recording of &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;.

=== 2006–2019: All Saints reunion and songwriting===

On 24 January 2006, it was announced that All Saints had reformed with a new recording contract and would release a new album, &quot;Studio 1&quot; on 13 November 2006. She performed with All Saints on live television for the first time since reforming on the British light entertainment program &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot; on 21 October 2006. All Saints&#x27; comeback began well, with their single, &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, reaching no. 3 in the UK Singles Chart. They followed this with the release of their comeback album &quot;Studio 1&quot;. It peaked at no. 40 in the UK Albums Chart. Parlophone Records then released their second single &quot;Chick Fit&quot;, but this failed to reach the chart. All Saints then parted company with their record label.

In January 2008, Lewis featured on the Wideboys track, &quot;Daddy-O&quot;. The single was released on 5 May 2008 and peaked at No. 32 in the UK. As a songwriter, Lewis is credited in Westlife&#x27;s track &quot;Reach Out&quot;, which was featured on their 2009 album &quot;Where We Are&quot;, the CocknBullKid track &quot;Distractions&quot; from her 2011 album &quot;Adulthood&quot; and the Stooshe single &quot;Black Heart&quot;, released as a single in 2012. In August 2012, it was reported Lewis was in the studio with original Sugababes line-up Mutya Keisha Siobhan, writing new material for their debut album.

In 2014, All Saints reformed to support the Backstreet Boys for five dates across the UK and Ireland in 2014. On 27 January 2016, it was confirmed that All Saints will release their fourth studio album &quot;Red Flag&quot; on 8 April 2016. The lead single from the album, &quot;One Strike&quot;, preceded the album on 26 February 2016. All Saints more recently released the 2018 album &quot;Testament&quot; saw the band reunite with producer William Orbit and was preceded by the singles Love Lasts Forever and After All. Both albums were written by Lewis and a string of collaborators including Fred Ball, Invisible Men, Futurecut &amp; many more. To support both album releases, All Saints embarked on two UK tours, headlined festivals across the world and appeared as special guests on Take That&#x27;s Wonderland Live arena and stadium tour.

In 2019, Lewis co-wrote the theme music for the Netflix original series &#x27;Turn Up Charlie&#x27; with Idris Elba.

=== 2023–present: &quot;Pages&quot; ===
On 14 November 2023 it was confirmed that Lewis would be performing at Mighty Hoopla in June 2024. On 12 January 2024, she released the single &quot;Miracle&quot;, her first solo single in twenty years. In an interview with &quot;Entertainment Focus&quot;, Lewis said that the song came from &quot;a relentless writing process between Emily Phillips and me. We pushed each other, we changed it a lot until, and when I finally listened to it I realised it was a love song to myself, about the person I’ve been for the past 25 years and where I am now. It’s a message of encouragement to return to my love of writing with self-esteem, and confidence in the way that made me happy.&quot;

It was announced on 29 January 2024 that Lewis would release her second studio album, &quot;Pages&quot;, on 17 May 2024 through 1.9.7.5. Recordings. Further singles, &quot;Kiss of Life&quot;, &quot;Good Mourning&quot; (which featured Shola Ama and General Levy) and &quot;Got to Let Go&quot;, preceded the album. Official music videos for &quot;Kiss of Life&quot; and &quot;Good Mourning&quot; were released.

== Personal life ==
Lewis was born in Islington to a Barbadian father and a Jamaican mother.

Despite growing up in a Spurs supporting household, Lewis made three appearances for Arsenal L.F.C. when she was a teenager.
On 21 August 2004, Lewis married dancer Christian &quot;Storm&quot; Horsfall. They had their first child, a son named Tyler-Xaine, in February 2006. In November 2009, Lewis and her husband had their second child, a daughter named Tigerlily.

<text>Louis Prosper Gachard (12 March 1800 – 24 December 1885), Belgian man of letters, was born in Paris.

He entered the administration of the national archives in 1826, and was appointed director-general in 1831, a post which he held for fifty-five years. During this long period he reorganized the service, added to the records by copies taken in other European collections, travelled for purposes of study, and carried on a wide correspondence with other keepers of records, and with historical scholars.

He also edited and published many valuable collections of state papers; a full list of his various publications was printed in the &quot;Annuaire de l&#x27;Académie royale de Belgique&quot; by Ch. Piot in 1888, pp. 220–236. It includes 246 entries.

He was the author of several historical writings, of which the best known are &quot;Don Carlos et Philippe II&quot; (1863), &quot;Études et notices historiques concernant l&#x27;histoire des Pays-Bas&quot; (1863), &quot;Histoire de la Belgique au commencement du XVIIIème siècle&quot; (1880), &quot;Histoire politique et diplomatique de P. P. Rubens&quot; (1877), all published at Brussels.

His chief editorial works are the &quot;Actes des États généraux des Pays-Bas 1576–1585&quot; (Brussels, 1861–1866), &quot;Collection de documens inédits concernant l&#x27;histoire de la Belgique&quot; (Brussels, 1833 1835), and the &quot;Relations des ambassadeurs vénitiens sur Charles V et Philippe II&quot; (Brussels, 1855). Gachard died in Brussels on 24 December 1885.

<doc id="1267731" wikidata="Q124122" url="?curid=1267731" title="Marc Delafontaine">
<text>Marc Delafontaine (March 31, 1837/1838, Céligny, Switzerland–1911) was a Swiss chemist and spectroscopist who was involved in discovering and investigating some of the rare earth elements.

==Career==
Delafontaine studied with Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac at the University of Geneva. He also worked at the University of Geneva. 

Delafontaine moved to the United States of America, arriving in New York in 1870, and later becoming a naturalized citizen. 
He taught in Chicago, Illinois at city high schools, and at a women&#x27;s college.
He also worked as an analytical chemist with the
Chicago Police Department.

==Research==
===Holmium===
In 1878, along with Jacques-Louis Soret, Delafontaine first observed holmium spectroscopically. In 1879, Per Teodor Cleve chemically separated it from thulium and erbium. All three men are given credit for the element&#x27;s discovery.

===Yttrium, terbium and erbium===
In 1843, Carl Gustaf Mosander discovered terbium and erbium as components of yttria.

However, this discovery was hotly contested. Spectroscopist Nils Johan Berlin denied that the two elements existed, failing to confirm the existence of &quot;erbia&quot; and suggesting that its name be applied to &quot;terbia&quot;. 

In 1864, Marc Delafontaine used optical spectroscopy to conclusively prove that yttrium, terbium, and erbium were separate elements. Ironically, however, the confusion that had been introduced between the names continued. Mosander&#x27;s proposed names were switched, giving the amethyst compound the name &quot;erbium&quot; oxide and the yellow substance the name &quot;terbium&quot; oxide, instead of the other way around as originally proposed.

<text>Aparajito ( &quot;Ôporajito&quot;; &quot;The Unvanquished&quot;) is a 1956 Indian Bengali-language drama film written and directed by Satyajit Ray, and is the second part of &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot;. It is an adaptation of the last part of Bibhutibhushan Bannerjee&#x27;s novel &quot;Pather Panchali&quot; and the first part of his followup novel &quot;Aparajito&quot;. The film starts off where the previous film &quot;Pather Panchali&quot; (1955) ended, with Apu&#x27;s family moving to Varanasi, and chronicles Apu&#x27;s life from childhood to adolescence in college.

When Ray started making &quot;Pather Panchali&quot;, he had no plans of following it up with a sequel, but the critical and commercial success of that film prompted him to start making &quot;Aparajito&quot;. Unlike his previous venture, where he stayed faithful to the novel, Ray took some bold artistic decisions here, such as portraying the relationship between Apu and his mother in a very different manner from the book. As a result, in contrast to its predecessor, the film was not received well locally; Ray recalled that &quot;as for the suburban audience, it was shocked by the portrayal of the mother and son relationship, so sharply at variance with the conventional notion of mutual sweetness and devotion&quot;.

Critical reception outside of India, however, was overwhelmingly positive. The film won 11 international awards, including the Golden Lion and Critics Award at the Venice Film Festival, becoming the first film to ever win both awards. Veteran film-maker Mrinal Sen said he considered &quot;Aparajito&quot; to be one of the best Indian movies he had ever seen. Bosley Crowther wrote that &quot;it is done with such rare feeling and skill at pictorial imagery, and with such sympathetic understanding of Indian character on the part of Mr. Ray, that it develops a sort of hypnotism for the serene and tolerant viewer&quot;. The critical acclaim this movie received encouraged Ray to make another sequel, &quot;Apur Sansar&quot; (1959), which was equally well received, and thus concluded one of the most critically acclaimed movie trilogies of all time, as Roger Ebert later pointed out: &quot;The three films ... swept the top prizes at Cannes, Venice and London, and created a new cinema for India – whose prolific film industry had traditionally stayed within the narrow confines of swashbuckling musical romances. Never before had one man had such a decisive impact on the films of his culture&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1920, Apu and his parents, who have left their home in rural Bengal, have settled into an apartment in Varanasi where his father Harihar works as a priest. Harihar is making headway in his new pursuits: praying, singing, and officiating among the ghats on the sacred river Ganges. Harihar catches a fever and soon dies, however, and his wife Sarbajaya is forced to begin work as a maid. With the assistance of a great uncle, Apu and his mother return to Bengal and settle in the village Mansapota. There Apu apprentices as a priest, but pines to attend the local school which his mother is persuaded to allow. He excels at his studies, impressing a visiting dignitary, and the headmaster takes special interest in him.

Within a few years, the teenaged Apu has done well enough to receive a scholarship to go to Kolkata for further studies. Sarbajaya feels abandoned and frightened by this, but gives in and lovingly packs his suitcase. Apu travels by train to the city and starts working at a printing press, after school hours, to subsist. He becomes more accustomed to the city life and feels out of place in the village. Sarbajaya expects visits from him, but he visits only a few times. Her loneliness and yearning for her son grow. She becomes seriously ill, but does not disclose her illness to Apu, lest his studies be disturbed. When Apu finally realises her poor health, he returns to the village to find that she has died. Bhabataran, Apu&#x27;s great uncle, requests that he stay there and perform last rites of his mother. Apu replies that he will perform the last rites in Kolkata and begins his journey back to the city.

==Production==
=== Origin and development ===
&quot;Aparajito&quot; was based on the last fifth of the novel &quot;Pather Panchali&quot; and the first third of the novel &quot;Aparajito&quot; by Banerjee. The novel &quot;Pather Panchali&quot; is a classic bildungsroman (a type of coming-of-age story) in the canon of Bengali literature. It first appeared as a serial in a Calcutta periodical in 1928 and was published as a book the next year. According to Ray&#x27;s biographer, Robinson, among the three films of the Apu trilogy, &quot;Aparajito&quot; bears the closest resemblance with its literary source. Banerjee&#x27;s depiction of the mother-son relation fascinated Ray. Robinson writes: &quot;Their relationship had some echoes on a purely psychological plane for him&quot;. Ray was in particular moved by Banerjee&#x27;s &quot;daring and profound revelation&quot;, that &quot;for some time after Sarbajaya&#x27;s death Apu becomes familiar with a strange sensation ... his immediate reaction had been one of pleasure, like a surge of release ... a delight in the breaking of bonds ... there was no doubt he loved his mother, but the news of her death had at first brought him pleasure—he couldn&#x27;t avoid the truth&quot;. Ray&#x27;s wife Bijoya also voiced her concerns when she discovered the plot, asking him &quot;Do you think people in our country will accept a son&#x27;s relief at having won his freedom at his mother&#x27;s death?&quot; Ray was aware of the risk, saying: &quot;let&#x27;s see what happens. After all, later Apu was full of regret at his initial reaction upon his mother&#x27;s death. And as he realized, her death actually came as a very big blow to him&quot;.

===Script and crew===
The novel had a female character named Leela who influenced Apu&#x27;s alienation from his mother when he was living in Calcutta. After rejecting two aspirants, Ray found one actress to portray the character, but the actress was not allowed to act in the film by her fiancé. Eventually, Ray reluctantly removed the character from the script. He later commented that he thought Leela, with whom Apu had an understated affair, was a strong reason behind Apu&#x27;s attraction to Calcutta, and that, without her presence in the film, this attraction might seem to some extent artificial: &quot;I&#x27;m never sure, whether Apu&#x27;s attachment to the city without the element of the girlfriend is strong enough, the pull that the city exerts is a bit abstract&quot;. However, when he watched the movie later, he did not feel the absence of Leela.

Subrata Mitra, the cinematographer of &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot;, made his first technical innovation with this film: the application of bounce lighting on large scale diffusers to match studio sets with location shooting. According to the Internet Encyclopedia of Cinematographers:
The fear of monsoon rain had forced the art director, Bansi Chandragupta, to abandon the original plan to build the inner courtyard of a typical Benares house in the open and the set was built inside a studio in Calcutta. Mitra recalls arguing in vain with both Chandragupta and Ray about the impossibilities of simulating shadowless diffused skylight. But this led him to innovate what became subsequently his most important tool—bounce lighting. Mitra placed a framed painter white cloth over the set resembling a patch of sky and arranged studio lights below to bounce off the fake sky.

==Critical reception==
The film has been enthusiastically received by critics. James Berardinelli wrote:

&quot;Aparajito&quot; was filmed forty years ago, half way around the world, yet the themes and emotions embedded in the narrative are strikingly relevant to modern Western society (thus explaining why it is called a &quot;timeless classic&quot;). ... &quot;Aparajito&quot; is an amazing motion picture. Its rich, poetic composition is perfectly wed to the sublime emotional resonance of the narrative. For those who have seen &quot;Pather Panchali&quot;, &quot;Aparajito&quot; provides a nearly-flawless continuation of the journey begun there. Yet, for those who missed Ray&#x27;s earlier effort, this film loses none of its impact. On its own or as part of the Apu Trilogy, &quot;Aparajito&quot; should not be missed.

Roger Ebert said that &quot;the relationship between Apu and his mother observes truths that must exist in all cultures: how the parent makes sacrifices for years, only to see the child turn aside and move thoughtlessly away into adulthood. ... It is about a time, place and culture far removed from our own, and yet it connects directly and deeply with our human feelings. It is like a prayer, affirming that this is what the cinema can be, no matter how far in our cynicism we may stray&quot;.

During the Venice Film Festival, Penelope Houston, who was among the jury, broke protocol and told Ray personally: &quot;I think it was magnificent&quot;. The chairman of the award ceremony, René Clair, was initially reluctant to give the film the festival&#x27;s coveted top prize; he eventually acquiesced, but not before saying to Houston: &quot;I hope Ray will go away and learn how to make films!&quot; The Japanese director Akira Kurosawa had an important film entered in that year&#x27;s festival competition, &quot;Throne of Blood&quot; (&quot;Kumonosu-jō&quot;), which lost to Ray&#x27;s film. However, many years later, Kurosawa&#x27;s daughter generated a list of 100 films admired by him; this list quoted him as having affirmed the jury&#x27;s choice as &quot;Absolutely right&quot; (though he misidentified the winning film as &quot;Pather Panchali&quot;).

Emanuel Levy said: &quot;Made in 1956 (and released in many countries a year later), &quot;Aparajito&quot; indicates India&#x27;s processes of modernization and industrialization and their inevitable impact on both individual and culture. Nonetheless, in his upbeat outlook, Ray suggests that individuals can rise to the occasion and might not be compromised by the corruption that characterizes the society at large&quot;. Bosley Crowther, who had earlier given a lukewarm response to &quot;Pather Panchali&quot;, saying that it was so amateurish that &quot;it would barely pass for a rough cut in Hollywood&quot;, praised &quot;Aparajito&quot;, saying that &quot;Mr. Ray&#x27;s remarkable camera catches beauty in so many things, from the softness of a mother&#x27;s sad expression to the silhouette of a distant train, that innuendos take up the slack of drama. Hindu music and expressive natural sounds complete the stimulation of the senses in this strange, sad, evocative film&quot;. On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Aparajito&quot; has a 94% fresh rating based on an aggregate of 18 reviews, with an average rating of 8.7/10.

==Awards and nominations==
&quot;Aparajito&quot; won the Golden Lion at the 1957 Venice Film Festival and, to date, remains the only film sequel to ever win the grand prize at the prestigious Venice, Berlin, or Cannes Film Festivals. Along with the Golden Lion, it received the Cinema Nuovo Award and the FIPRESCI Critics Award, becoming the first movie to win all three.

Ray won the Golden Gate awards for Best Picture and Best Director at the San Francisco International Film Festival in 1958, along with the Critics Award for this film.

The film won the Selznick Golden Laurel for Best Film at the Berlin International Film Festival, as well as the FIPRESCI Award and Wington Award at the British Film Institute Awards at London Film Festival. In Denmark, it won the Bodil Award for Best Non-European Film of the Year in 1967.

At the 1959 British Academy Film Awards, the film was nominated for Best Film and Karuna Banerjee was nominated for Best Foreign Actress for her role as Sarbajaya, Apu&#x27;s mother.

==Accolades==
In 1992, &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; (the British Film Institute&#x27;s film magazine) ranked &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; at No. 88 in its Critics&#x27; Poll of all-time greatest films, while &quot;Aparajito&quot; itself was ranked separately at No. 127 on the same list. In 2002, a combined list of &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; and directors&#x27; poll results included &quot;Aparajito&quot; in its top 160. In 1998, the Asian film magazine &quot;Cinemaya&quot;″s critics&#x27; poll of all-time greatest films ranked &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; at No. 7. In 1999, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; ranked &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; at No. 54 in its Top 250 &quot;Best Films of the Century&quot; list, based on a poll of critics. In 2001, film critic Roger Ebert included &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; in his list of &quot;100 Great Movies&quot; of all time. In 2005, &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; was included in &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s All-Time 100 Movies list.

==Legacy==
Smaran Ghosal, who, at the age of 14, played the role of adolescent Apu, only appeared in one more film, the documentary &quot;Rabindranath Tagore&quot; (1961), also made by Ray, in which he played a young Rabindranath Tagore. Smaran died in 2008 in Kolkata, at the age of 64.

&quot;Pather Panchali&quot; (1955), &quot;Aparajito&quot;, and &quot;Apur Sansar&quot; (&quot;The World of Apu&quot;) (1959) together constitute &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot;. &quot;Pather Panchali&quot; portrays the childhood of Apu in his family&#x27;s ancestral house. &quot;Apur Sansar&quot; depicts Apu&#x27;s adult life, his reaction to his wife&#x27;s premature death, and his final bonding with his son whom he abandoned as an infant. Ray did not initially plan to make a trilogy: he decided to make the third film only after being asked about the possibility of a trilogy at the 1957 Venice Film Festival, where &quot;Aparajito&quot; won the Golden Lion. &quot;Aparajito&quot; has been called the richest film of the trilogy in terms of its characterization.

According to Michael Sragow of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; in 1994: &quot;The youthful coming-of-age dramas that have flooded art houses since the mid-fifties owe a tremendous debt to the Apu trilogy, which Terrence Rafferty has rightly called &#x27;cinema&#x27;s purest Bildungsroman&#x27;&quot;. Across the world, filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese, James Ivory, Abbas Kiarostami, Elia Kazan, and Wes Anderson have been influenced by &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot;, with many others (such as Kurosawa) praising the work. After &quot;Aparajito&quot;, Ray went on to make 35 more films, including feature films, documentaries, and shorts. He worked on scripting, casting, scoring, cinematography, art direction, editing, and designing his own credit titles and publicity material, developing a distinctive style of film-making based on visual lyricism and strong humanism, as in his Apu trilogy, and established himself as an auteur of cinema.

==Preservation==
The Academy Film Archive preserved the entire Apu Trilogy in 1996, including &quot;Aparajito&quot;. In 2013, the video distribution company The Criterion Collection, in collaboration with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&#x27; Film Archive, began the restoration of the original negatives of the Apu trilogy, including &quot;Aparajito&quot;. These negatives had been severely damaged by a fire in London in 1993, and all film cans and fragments belonging to the Ray films were sent to the Motion Picture Academy for storage, where they lay unseen for two decades. It was discovered upon reexamination that, although many parts of the films were indeed destroyed by fire or the effects of age, other parts were salvageable. The materials were shipped to a restoration laboratory in Bologna, Italy: L&#x27;Immagine Ritrovata. For those parts of the negative that were missing or unusable, duplicate negatives and fine-grain masters from various commercial or archival sources were used. The Criterion Collection&#x27;s own lab then spent six months creating the digital version of all three films, at times choosing to preserve the distinctive look of the films even at the cost of retaining some imperfections.

<doc id="1267740" wikidata="Q124083" url="?curid=1267740" title="Jacques-Louis Soret">
<text>Jacques-Louis Soret (; 30 June 1827 – 13 May 1890) was a Swiss chemist and spectroscopist. He studied both spectroscopy and electrolysis.
==Career==
Soret held the chairs of chemistry (1873-1887) and medical physics (1887-1890) at the University of Geneva.

Soret determined the chemical composition and density of ozone and the conditions for its production. He described it correctly as being composed of three oxygen atoms bound together.

Soret also developed optical instruments. He climbed Mont Blanc, where he was the first scientist to make actinometric measurements of solar radiation. These observations were published in the &quot;Philosophical Magazine&quot; in 1867.

In 1878, he and Marc Delafontaine were the first to spectroscopically observe the element later named holmium, which they identified simply as an &quot;earth X&quot; derived from &quot;erbia&quot;. Independently, Per Teodor Cleve separated it chemically from thulium and erbium in 1879. All three researchers are given credit for the element&#x27;s discovery.

The Soret peak or Soret band, a strong absorption band at approximately 420 nm in the absorption spectra of hemoglobin, is also named after him.
==Death==
Jacques-Louis Soret died in Geneva on 13 May 1890. 
His son was Charles Soret, a recognized physicist and chemist in his own right.

<text>666 (subtitled The Apocalypse of John, 13/18) is the third and final studio album and only double album by Greek progressive rock band Aphrodite&#x27;s Child, released in June 1972 by Vertigo Records. An ambitious double-LP concept album, ostensibly an adaptation of Biblical passages from the Book of Revelation, &quot;666&quot; was composed by keyboardist Vangelis and lyricist Costas Ferris.

Conflict within the band and with their record company over the album&#x27;s uncommercial style led to its release being delayed for more than a year. Though it was eventually released to a lukewarm critical and commercial reception, it later attracted a cult following among fans and musicians and became the group&#x27;s most acclaimed project. It has appeared on various lists of the greatest progressive rock albums of all time.

==Conception and production==
The concept for &quot;666&quot; was created by Vangelis and film director Costas Ferris, who served as the project&#x27;s lyricist. Ferris cited as influences the nonlinear narrative style of the films &quot;Intolerance&quot;, &quot;Rashomon&quot;, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and &quot;The Killing&quot;, as well as the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; and the Who&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot;.

The central concept is a countercultural interpretation of the Book of Revelation, in which a circus show based on the apocalypse performs for an audience at the same time that the real apocalypse takes place outside the circus tent, and at the end the two merge into one. Ferris described the result as a &quot;concept book&quot;, and stated that he intended for the narration to be looser than &quot;Tommy&quot;, but more rigid than &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;.

The band commenced work on the album at the Europa Sonor studio in Paris in late 1970. They took just over three months to record it and finished in early 1971. The overall cost of album&#x27;s recording was estimated as US$80,000 () or US$90,000 (). The recording was marked by tension, as the ambitious nature of Vangelis and Ferris&#x27; concept clashed with Demis Roussos, Loukas Sideras and Silver Koulouris&#x27; wish to continue with the psychedelic pop direction that had brought them success. Vangelis, Roussos and Sideras were also accompanied by their partners, further adding to the strain. Engineer Roger Roche reported that they enjoyed playing together but would not speak to each other after they finished a take. Vangelis blamed commercial pressures for the tensions, stating, &quot;It was too sophisticated for the group. I realised that I couldn&#x27;t follow the commercial way anymore, it was very boring.&quot;

Giorgio Gomelsky, in France at the time due to his work with Magma and Gong, made several contributions to the album and by his own description served as &quot;a sort of &#x27;acting producer. He believed that his contributions were not enough to warrant a producer&#x27;s credit. Accordingly, on the album sleeve, he is credited as &quot;passing by&quot;. Gerard Fallec, credited on the sleeve with &quot;production coordination&quot;, did not play a part in the production process, but became involved during the year-long battle to have the record released. Ferris credited him with suggesting the album&#x27;s final title and working on its sleeve. Additional contributors to the album included Harris Halkitis, who had filled in for Vangelis when the band toured in support of &quot;It&#x27;s Five O&#x27;Clock&quot;, horn player Michel Ripoche, Greek painter Yannis Tsarouchis, actress Irene Papas, John Forst and Daniel Koplowitz.

Upon the album&#x27;s completion, Mercury Records refused to release it, objecting to its uncommercial material and in particular the song &quot;∞&quot;. In 1971, the band organised a &quot;one-year anniversary party&quot; at Europa Sonor, to protest the album not being released. According to Ferris, Salvador Dalí was in attendance at the party, and listened to the album. Dalí was highly impressed with the work, stating that it reminded him of the Sagrada Família, and planned an ambitious happening in Barcelona to mark the album&#x27;s release. The plan was canceled when Dalí angrily broke off further contact after a friend of Ferris&#x27; referred to Gala Dalí as &quot;Madame Éluard&quot; during a visit in Rome.

Despite Vangelis editing &quot;∞&quot; from its original 39 minutes to merely five, the band continued to struggle with Mercury&#x27;s obstruction. During this period, the band drifted apart. Vangelis released his first solo album &quot;Fais que ton rêve soit plus long que la nuit&quot;. Sideras began work on his own solo album, &quot;One Day&quot;, which featured arrangements by Koulouris. Roussos released his debut solo album &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; (also known as &quot;On the Greek Side of My Mind&quot;), obtaining a hit single in Europe with the song &quot;We Shall Dance&quot;.

==Songs==
The music of &quot;666&quot; is more ambitious and experimental than previous Aphrodite&#x27;s Child releases, containing greater use of electronic keyboards, studio experimentation, expanded instrumentation, and influences from genres such as jazz, musique concrète and world music. Reflecting this character, only six of the album&#x27;s 24 songs have vocals and lyrics, four by lead singer Demis Roussos and two by Loukas Sideras. The rest are either instrumental, instrumentals with narration, or use vocals as an instrument. Although the album&#x27;s material is often acknowledged as challenging and uncommercial, it has also been described as tuneful, &quot;fun&quot;, and retaining elements of pop music. Authors Paul Hegarty and Martin Halliwell interpreted the album as reflecting &quot;the turmoil in Greece at the time&quot;, while Vangelis argued that its theme was highly relevant in general, stating in &quot;Sounds&quot; in 1974, &quot;The answer to the question 666 is today.&quot; &quot;The Mojo Collection&quot; argues that &quot;the album&#x27;s lush arrangements were as startling as any of the progressive era and have aged better than most&quot;, in part due to Vangelis not relying excessively on contemporary synthesizers and the prominent role of guitarist Silver Koulouris.

===Side one===
The first song on the album, &quot;The System&quot;, fades in with a choir chanting &quot;We got the system, to fuck the system!&quot; and a drum roll by Loukas Sideras. The lyric is inspired by Abbie Hoffman&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;Fuck the System&quot;.

&quot;Babylon&quot; is an acoustic rock song with an energetic guitar riff that &quot;Head Heritage&quot; compared to Pete Townshend&#x27;s work on &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;, melodic bass playing by Roussos, and crowd noise similar to that of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. The lyrics introduce the apocalyptic theme by referring to the fall of Babylon the Great from Revelation 18.

&quot;Loud, Loud, Loud&quot; combines a two-chord piano vamp by Vangelis with narration by Daniel Koplowitz, described by a fansite as &quot;the son of [a] diplomat&quot;. The title is sung by a choir, who are not credited on the album sleeve. The narration reflects a spirit of countercultural optimism, speaking of &quot;The day young boys will stop becoming soldiers/And soldiers will stop playing war games&quot;.

&quot;The Four Horsemen&quot; deals with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, its lyrics mostly paraphrasing the text of Revelation 6. The song&#x27;s structure is marked by a dynamic contrast, with Roussos singing over an echoed keyboard drone and wind chimes in the verses, and the chorus containing traditional rock instrumentation highlighted by Sideras&#x27; drumming. The song culminates in a two-minute wah guitar solo by Koulouris over heavy drumming by Sideras and a repeated &quot;fa fa fa&quot; background chant by Roussos. One of the best known songs of &quot;666&quot;, &quot;The Four Horsemen&quot; influenced Beck&#x27;s &quot;Chemtrails&quot;, which has a similar structure, and The Verve&#x27;s &quot;The Rolling People&quot;, which quoted the &quot;fa fa fa&quot; chant. The chorus was also sampled, in a slowed-down fashion, on Daniel Lopatin&#x27;s &quot;A7&quot;, from &quot;Chuck Person&#x27;s Eccojams Vol. 1&quot;.

&quot;The Lamb&quot; is a world music-influenced instrumental, featuring vocal chants following the main melody, and sounds reminiscent of traditional Greek instruments.

&quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; is an instrumental with a repeated keyboard and string instrument melody, and British-accented narration by John Forst describing the lamb opening the last of the Seven seals, again based on Revelation 6. The narration does not mention the earthquake that the Book of Revelation attributes to the breaking of the sixth seal, but is otherwise faithful to the biblical description. Forst&#x27;s line, &quot;And when the lamb opened the seventh seal, silence covered the sky&quot; was sampled in the Enigma song, &quot;The Rivers of Belief&quot;.

===Side two===
Side two begins with &quot;Aegian Sea&quot;, an instrumental featuring another lengthy guitar solo by Koulouris, elaborate keyboard work by Vangelis, and wordless vocalising. Narration by John Forst is included under Koulouris&#x27; guitar solo, restating the breaking of the two seals in &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; in singular first person, and featuring three repetitions of the phrase &quot;They&#x27;ll no more suffer from hunger, they&#x27;ll no more suffer from thirst&quot;. Forst&#x27;s narration is slowed down in pitch and panned to the right stereo channel, with echo being heard on the left channel.

&quot;Aegian Sea&quot; is followed by &quot;Seven Bowls&quot;, a sound effect-laden piece in which a chorus narrates the effects of the seven bowls (changing the Euphrates drying up and earthquake of the last two bowls to the stars going out and the air turning to poison), which in turn crossfades into the eerie instrumental &quot;The Wakening Beast&quot;, which uses reverbed wind chimes. The narration of &quot;Seven Bowls&quot; was sampled on the Enigma song &quot;The Voice and the Snake&quot;.

&quot;Lament&quot; begins with a repeated vibraphone note played by Vangelis, followed by Roussos singing a lament for &quot;the human race&quot; over a minimal backing. Vangelis provides additional backing vocals, which reflect his interest in Byzantine music.

&quot;The Marching Beast&quot; is an instrumental piece with a repeated melody played on guitar, bass and saxophone, with a gradually developing arrangement that includes a piano solo and a Jethro Tull-influenced flute trill.

&quot;The Battle of the Locusts&quot; and &quot;Do It&quot; are aggressive rock instrumentals, variously perceived by reviewers as being influenced by jazz and heavy metal. Both begin with Forst reciting their titles, and are played in a power trio format, with intricate drumming and rapid guitar solos. The title of &quot;Do It&quot; comes from Jerry Rubin&#x27;s book &quot;DO IT!: Scenarios of the Revolution&quot;. Both songs were compared by &quot;Head Heritage&quot; to &quot;Ash Ra Tempel meets Santana&quot;.

&quot;Tribulation&quot; is a jazz-influenced instrumental with overdubbed saxophone by Harris Halkitis.

&quot;The Beast&quot; has been described as a &quot;bizarre funky singalong&quot;. It is the first song with lead vocals by Loukas Sideras, who sings &quot;Who can fight the beast?&quot; in his normal voice and &quot;She&#x27;s big/She&#x27;s bad/She&#x27;s wicked/She&#x27;s sad&quot; in a deeper, lower voice. The song features a funk-influenced rhythm and studio experimentation, with the first snare hit of the verses having plate reverb applied to it. During recording, Vangelis had a microphone in order to direct the band, and the final mix of the song includes some of his rhythmic scat singing and studio commentary. He says &quot;Pame!&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s go!&quot;) near the song&#x27;s climax, and &quot;Teliounome edho pera, etsi?&quot; (&quot;We&#x27;re closing here, remember?&quot;) on the song&#x27;s final measure. Reviewer Jon Bryan considered the song &quot;a little kooky&quot; but &quot;fun and memorable&quot;.

The last song on the second side, &quot;Ofis&quot;, is a brief interlude in which Yiannis Tsarouchis recites a line from the shadow puppet play &quot;Alexander the Great and the Accursed Serpent&quot; with slapback echo applied to his voice. The line, , translates to &quot;Come out, cursed serpent, because if you don&#x27;t come out yourself, I will make you come out!&quot;.

===Side three===
&quot;Seven Trumpets&quot; is a dramatic narration that serves to introduce &quot;Altamont&quot;. &quot;Head Heritage&quot; interpreted it to represent the moment where the &quot;curtain of reality&quot; is torn down, and thus the real apocalypse and the circus show apocalypse begin to intertwine as per Ferris&#x27; concept.

&quot;Altamont&quot;, chosen as one of the highlights of the album by AllMusic, contains a repetitive funk-influenced groove, Roussos scatting along with the bassline, vibraphone by Vangelis, and overdubbed horns by Halkitis. The second half of the song introduces additional narration, referring to the imagery of previous songs and describing the sight of the apocalypse as &quot;the pictures of what was, of what is, of what is to come&quot;. One of the lines of the narration, &quot;We are the people/The rolling people&quot;, later inspired the title of The Verve&#x27;s &quot;The Rolling People&quot;.

&quot;Altamont&quot; ends by crossfading into &quot;The Wedding of the Lamb&quot;, a world music-influenced instrumental that contains an electronic keyboard melody backed by wordless vocalising and syncopated, rhythmic drumming. The instrumental in turn crossfades into &quot;The Capture of the Beast&quot;, a drum solo by Sideras that makes heavy use of toms and percussion instruments, performed over Vangelis&#x27; keyboard drones and effects. The songs are linked together by brief spoken lines recited in a halting manner which announce their titles, &quot;That was &#x27;The Wedding of the Lamb&#x27;&quot; at the end of the former, and &quot;Now comes &#x27;The Capture of the Beast&#x27;&quot; at the beginning of the latter.

&quot;∞&quot; (&quot;Infinity&quot;), the most controversial song on the album, consists of the Greek actress Irene Papas chanting &quot;I was, I am, I am to come&quot; over a sparse percussion track, gradually building into an orgasmic frenzy. Vangelis described the track as conveying &quot;the pain of birth and the joy of intercourse.&quot; Ferris originally sought a narrator with a heavy British accent to recite the lyric, in order to create a contrast with the climactic frenzy, but Papas&#x27; improvisation was chosen instead because it made a stronger impression. Hegarty and Halliwell describe the song as part of the &quot;increased cacophony&quot; that marks the progression towards the apocalypse. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; remarked in 1972 that in light of the publicity received by Serge Gainsbourg&#x27;s &quot;Je t&#x27;aime... moi non plus&quot;, it was &quot;odd&quot; that the media overlooked &quot;666&quot;, but that it would have been a &quot;pity&quot; if it achieved notoriety solely due to Papas&#x27; contribution. A sample of Papas taking sharp breaths was used in Enigma&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Lust&quot;.

&quot;Hic et Nunc&quot; (Latin for &quot;here and now&quot;) is an upbeat pop song with phased piano, tenor saxophone by Michel Ripoche, a crowd chanting &quot;Here and now!&quot; in the chorus, a reuse of the audience sound effect from &quot;Babylon&quot; and the &quot;We got the system to fuck the system&quot; chant from &quot;The System&quot; during Vangelis&#x27; piano solo, foreshadowing the concluding &quot;montage&quot;.

===Side four===
The longest song on the album, &quot;All the Seats Were Occupied&quot; begins as a slow raga-influenced instrumental before incorporating other genres such as funk and culminating in a musique concrète &quot;montage&quot; that incorporates samples from &quot;Seven Trumpets&quot;, &quot;The System&quot;, &quot;Babylon&quot;, &quot;The Four Horsemen&quot;, &quot;Loud, Loud, Loud&quot;, &quot;The Capture of the Beast&quot;, &quot;Ofis&quot;, &quot;∞&quot;, &quot;Seven Bowls&quot;, &quot;The Lamb&quot;, &quot;The Wakening Beast&quot;, &quot;The Marching Beast&quot;, &quot;Altamont&quot; and &quot;The Wedding Of The Lamb&quot;. The sentence &quot;all the seats were occupied&quot; was taken from a BBC Teaching English record. The song concludes with a chaotic ending and a sample of Papas&#x27; pained groaning from &quot;∞&quot;. This track was later included on the compilation album &quot;A Monstrous Psychedelic Bubble Exploding in Your Mind: Volume 3&quot;.

&quot;Break&quot;, the closing song, is a ballad sung by Sideras, backed by piano and organ. Vangelis scat sings backing vocals, meant to make fun of the song&#x27;s dramatic mood. Ferris&#x27; lyrics originally had an additional verse that began the song, starting &quot;Now/Got no place to go&quot;, which was left out of the final version. Hegarty and Halliwell describe the last lines, &quot;Fly/High/And then/You make it&quot;, as lacking in narrative link to the rest of the album, but ending on a &quot;melancholic high&quot;. The song ends with a piano and organ chord, which is followed after 6 seconds of silence by a sample of Forst saying &quot;Do it!&quot;, the final sound of the album.

==Packaging==
The album&#x27;s sleeve was created by production coordinator Gerard Fallec. Ferris stated that Fallec&#x27;s initial idea was to have a black cover with &quot;666&quot; printed in white in the middle, inspired by the white background of &quot;The Beatles&quot;, and created the original design with three plastic car numbers. Ferris and Vangelis liked the idea but preferred a red background with the number printed white on black in the middle, similar to a vehicle registration plate. This became the final design, although several vinyl issues of the album use the original white number on black background sleeve.

Fallec also brought to the band a surreal, Dalí-influenced painting of a car crash that became the inner sleeve. Ferris stated that the band forgot to ask for the name of the artist (although the signature &quot;M. Dubre&quot; appears on the image), and that while Fallec was unsure about the relation of the painting to the work apart from the &quot;car&quot; theme of the cover, he and Vangelis considered it &quot;the absolute representation of the stupidity of man.&quot;

The liner notes state &quot;This album was recorded under the influence of Sahlep.&quot; Intended as a joke by the band, the statement provoked some controversy at the time of the album&#x27;s release, as some groups interpreted it to mean that the album was drug-inspired, demonic, or blasphemous.

==Release and reception==
Mercury released &quot;666&quot; on its progressive rock subsidiary Vertigo Records in June 1972. The album was promoted with one single, &quot;Babylon&quot;/&quot;Break&quot;, released in November. Mercury also produced a four-song EP to encourage radio play, and ran a contest where they would give $666 to the first three promoters who could get their market&#x27;s share of 40,000 sales. Although &quot;Melody Maker&quot; stated that &quot;Break&quot; &quot;could easily have made the chart if it had been released as a single&quot;, neither the album nor single were commercially successful on release, the album failing to chart and the single only entering the Dutch charts at #24. Two years later, Vangelis said that the album sold well in the United States.

Vertigo also released a single vinyl edition of the album in Brazil, titled &quot;Break&quot; and leaving out most of the album&#x27;s instrumental songs. An extended vinyl edition of &quot;666&quot; was released in Greece in 1974, containing alternative mixes of songs with music cut from other versions of the album, in a gatefold sleeve displaying the painting originally on the inner sleeve; some of these versions had appeared on the Brazilian release.
&quot;The Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot; dismissed &quot;666&quot; as &quot;pompous and pointless&quot;. Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; states that &quot;the album was applauded for its ambition and execution&quot;, but it did not attract many contemporary reviews. AllMusic gives it 4½ stars, but notes that &quot;the entire set eventually becomes too overwhelming to sit through&quot;.

&quot;IGN&quot; ranked the album number 3 on their list of Top 25 Prog Rock Albums. In the &quot;Q&quot; &amp; &quot;Mojo&quot; Classic Special Edition ‘’Pink Floyd &amp; the Story of Prog Rock’’, the album came number 40 in its list of &quot;40 Cosmic Rock Albums&quot;.

A re-issued version of the album – including a previously unavailable French (English-subtitled) interview with Vangelis on the creative process, alongside widely-unheard Greek mixes, a Dolby ATMOS up-mix, illustrated booklet and further original interviews – was released on 8 November 2024.

==Track listing==
Although Ferris has been identified as the lyricist, the album explicitly states that all tracks — even the instrumentals — are composed by Vangelis Papathanassiou and Costas Ferris.

<text>George William Gekas (April 14, 1930 – December 16, 2021) was an American politician from Pennsylvania who served as a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives for Pennsylvania&#x27;s 17th congressional district from 1983 to 2003.

==Early life and education==
George Gekas was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the son of Mary (Touloumes) and William Gekas. He graduated from William Penn High School in 1948. He received a B.A. degree from Dickinson College in 1952 and a J.D. degree from Dickinson School of Law in 1958. He was a member of the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon. He served in the United States Army from 1953 to 1955.

== Career ==
He worked in a private law practice for two years and then served as assistant district attorney for Dauphin County from 1960 to 1966.

===Pennsylvania Legislature===
In 1966, Gekas was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for the 103rd district. He served there until 1974, when he was upset by future Harrisburg mayor Steven Reed in the anti-Watergate Democratic landslide. Gekas served as a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate for the 15th district from 1977 to 1982.

===United States House of Representatives===
After the 1980 census, Pennsylvania lost two congressional districts. The Republican-controlled legislature drew a new Harrisburg-based district that Gekas won in 1982, becoming the second Greek-American (after Gus Yatron of the neighboring 6th district) elected to Congress from Pennsylvania. Gekas was reelected nine more times.

He was the only member of the House to vote against the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990.

Gekas was one of the House managers in the impeachment trials of Alcee Hastings and President Bill Clinton.

====2002 House Campaign====
In a 2002 PoliticsPA feature story designating politicians with yearbook superlatives, he was named &quot;Missing in Action.&quot; Pennsylvania lost two districts after the 2000 census and resulting redistricting. One of the districts that was eliminated was the Reading-based 6th District, represented by five-term moderate-to-conservative Democrat Tim Holden. The legislature split the 6th among three other districts, with the largest slice, including Holden&#x27;s home in St. Clair, going to Gekas&#x27; 17th District.

Holden ran in the 17th, even though it was 65% new to him (a small portion of the even more Republican 9th District had been shifted to the 17th). On election night, Holden defeated Gekas by almost 6,000 votes. Gekas was the only Republican incumbent placed in a district with a Democratic incumbent to be defeated for re-election in 2002.

===Later life and death===
After his electoral defeat in 2002, Gekas returned to Harrisburg, where he established a law practice. He continued to reside in Harrisburg until his death on December 16, 2021, at the age of 91.

<doc id="1267762" wikidata="Q247276" url="?curid=1267762" title="Variable speed of light">
<text>A variable speed of light (VSL) is a feature of a family of hypotheses stating that the speed of light may in some way not be constant, for example, that it varies in space or time, or depending on frequency. Accepted classical theories of physics, and in particular general relativity, predict a constant speed of light in any local frame of reference and in some situations these predict apparent variations of the speed of light depending on frame of reference, but this article does not refer to this as a variable speed of light. Various alternative theories of gravitation and cosmology, many of them non-mainstream, incorporate variations in the local speed of light.

Attempts to incorporate a variable speed of light into physics were made by Robert Dicke in 1957, and by several researchers starting from the late 1980s.

VSL should not be confused with faster than light theories, its dependence on a medium&#x27;s refractive index or its measurement in a remote observer&#x27;s frame of reference in a gravitational potential. In this context, the &quot;speed of light&quot; refers to the limiting speed &quot;c&quot; of the theory rather than to the velocity of propagation of photons.

== Historical proposals ==

=== Background ===
Einstein&#x27;s equivalence principle, on which general relativity is founded, requires that in any local, freely falling reference frame, the speed of light is always the same. This leaves open the possibility, however, that an inertial observer inferring the apparent speed of light in a distant region might calculate a different value. Spatial variation of the speed of light in a gravitational potential as measured against a distant observer&#x27;s time reference is implicitly present in general relativity. The apparent speed of light will change in a gravity field and, in particular, go to zero at an event horizon as viewed by a distant observer. In deriving the gravitational redshift due to a spherically symmetric massive body, a radial speed of light &quot;dr&quot;/&quot;dt&quot; can be defined in Schwarzschild coordinates, with &quot;t&quot; being the time recorded on a stationary clock at infinity. The result is
: formula_1
where &quot;m&quot; is &quot;MG&quot;/&quot;c&quot;2 and where natural units are used such that &quot;c&quot;0 is equal to one.

=== Dicke&#x27;s proposal (1957) ===
Robert Dicke, in 1957, developed a VSL theory of gravity, a theory in which (unlike general relativity) the speed of light measured locally by a free-falling observer could vary. Dicke assumed that both frequencies and wavelengths could vary, which since formula_2 resulted in a relative change of &quot;c&quot;. Dicke assumed a refractive index formula_3 (eqn. 5) and proved it to be consistent with the observed value for light deflection. In a comment related to Mach&#x27;s principle, Dicke suggested that, while the right part of the term in eq. 5 is small, the left part, 1, could have &quot;its origin in the remainder of the matter in the universe&quot;.

Given that in a universe with an increasing horizon more and more masses contribute to the above refractive index, Dicke considered a cosmology where &quot;c&quot; decreased in time, providing an alternative explanation to the cosmological redshift.

=== Subsequent proposals ===

Variable speed of light models, including Dicke&#x27;s, have been developed which agree with all known tests of general relativity.

Other models make a link to Dirac large numbers hypothesis.

Several hypotheses for varying speed of light, seemingly in contradiction to general relativity theory, have been published, including those of Giere and Tan (1986) and Sanejouand (2009). In 2003, Magueijo gave a review of such hypotheses.

Cosmological models with varying speeds of light have been proposed independently by Jean-Pierre Petit in 1988, John Moffat in 1992, and the team of Andreas Albrecht and João Magueijo in 1998 to explain the horizon problem of cosmology and propose an alternative to cosmic inflation.

== Relation to other constants and their variation ==
=== Gravitational constant &quot;G&quot; ===

In 1937, Paul Dirac and others began investigating the consequences of natural constants changing with time. For example, Dirac proposed a change of only 5 parts in 1011 per year of the Newtonian constant of gravitation &quot;G&quot; to explain the relative weakness of the gravitational force compared to other fundamental forces. This has become known as the Dirac large numbers hypothesis.

However, Richard Feynman showed that the gravitational constant most likely could not have changed this much in the past 4 billion years based on geological and solar system observations, although this may depend on assumptions about &quot;G&quot; varying in isolation. (See also strong equivalence principle.)

=== Fine-structure constant &quot;α&quot; ===

One group, studying distant quasars, has claimed to detect a variation of the fine-structure constant at the level in one part in 105. Other authors dispute these results. Other groups studying quasars claim no detectable variation at much higher sensitivities.

The natural nuclear reactor of Oklo has been used to check whether the atomic fine-structure constant &quot;α&quot; might have changed over the past 2 billion years. That is because &quot;α&quot; influences the rate of various nuclear reactions. For example, captures a neutron to become , and since the rate of neutron capture depends on the value of &quot;α&quot;, the ratio of the two samarium isotopes in samples from Oklo can be used to calculate the value of &quot;α&quot; from 2 billion years ago. Several studies have analysed the relative concentrations of radioactive isotopes left behind at Oklo, and most have concluded that nuclear reactions then were much the same as they are today, which implies &quot;α&quot; was the same too.

Paul Davies and collaborators have suggested that it is in principle possible to disentangle which of the dimensionful constants (the elementary charge, the Planck constant, and the speed of light) of which the fine-structure constant is composed is responsible for the variation. However, this has been disputed by others and is not generally accepted.

== Criticisms of various VSL concepts ==
=== Dimensionless and dimensionful quantities ===
To clarify what a variation in a dimensionful quantity actually means, since any such quantity can be changed merely by changing one&#x27;s choice of units, John Barrow wrote:
:&quot;[An] important lesson we learn from the way that pure numbers like &quot;α&quot; define the world is what it really means for worlds to be different. The pure number we call the fine-structure constant and denote by &quot;α&quot; is a combination of the electron charge, &quot;e&quot;, the speed of light, &quot;c&quot;, and the Planck constant, &quot;h&quot;. At first we might be tempted to think that a world in which the speed of light was slower would be a different world. But this would be a mistake. If &quot;c&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, and &quot;e&quot; were all changed so that the values they have in metric (or any other) units were different when we looked them up in our tables of physical constants, but the value of &quot;α&quot; remained the same, this new world would be &quot;observationally indistinguishable&quot; from our world. The only thing that counts in the definition of worlds are the values of the dimensionless constants of Nature. If all masses were doubled in value [including the Planck mass &quot;m&quot;P] you cannot tell because all the pure numbers defined by the ratios of any pair of masses are unchanged.&quot;
Any equation of physical law can be expressed in a form in which all dimensional quantities are normalized against like-dimensioned quantities (called &quot;nondimensionalization&quot;), resulting in only dimensionless quantities remaining. Physicists can &quot;choose&quot; their units so that the physical constants &quot;c&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;ħ&quot; = &quot;h&quot;/(2π), 4π&quot;ε&quot;0, and &quot;k&quot;B take the value one, resulting in every physical quantity being normalized against its corresponding Planck unit. For that, it has been claimed that specifying the evolution of a dimensional quantity is meaningless and does not make sense. When Planck units are used and such equations of physical law are expressed in this nondimensionalized form, &quot;no&quot; dimensional physical constants such as &quot;c&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;ħ&quot;, &quot;ε&quot;0, nor &quot;k&quot;B remain, only dimensionless quantities, as predicted by the Buckingham π theorem. Short of their anthropometric unit dependence, there is no speed of light, gravitational constant, nor the Planck constant, remaining in mathematical expressions of physical reality to be subject to such hypothetical variation. For example, in the case of a hypothetically varying gravitational constant, &quot;G&quot;, the relevant dimensionless quantities that potentially vary ultimately become the ratios of the Planck mass to the masses of the fundamental particles. Some key dimensionless quantities (thought to be constant) that are related to the speed of light (among other dimensional quantities such as &quot;ħ&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;ε&quot;0), notably the fine-structure constant or the proton-to-electron mass ratio, could in principle have meaningful variance and their possible variation continues to be studied.

=== General critique of varying &quot;c&quot; cosmologies ===
From a very general point of view, G. F. R. Ellis and Jean-Philippe Uzan expressed concerns that a varying &quot;c&quot; would require a rewrite of much of modern physics to replace the current system which depends on a constant &quot;c&quot;. Ellis claimed that any varying &quot;c&quot; theory (1) must redefine distance measurements; (2) must provide an alternative expression for the metric tensor in general relativity; (3) might contradict Lorentz invariance; (4) must modify Maxwell&#x27;s equations; and (5) must be done consistently with respect to all other physical theories. VSL cosmologies remain out of mainstream physics.

<text>Adolescent cliques are cliques that develop amongst adolescents. In the social sciences, the word &quot;clique&quot; is used to describe a large group of 6 to 12 &quot;who interact with each other more regularly and intensely than others in the same setting&quot;. Cliques are distinguished from &quot;crowds&quot; in that their members socially interact with one another more than the typical crowd (e.g. hang out together, go shopping, play sports etc.). Crowds, on the other hand, are defined by reputation. Although the word &#x27;clique&#x27; or &#x27;cliquey&#x27; is often used in day-to-day conversation to describe relational aggression or snarky, gossipy behaviors of groups of socially dominant teenage girls, that is not always accurate. Interacting with cliques is part of normative social development regardless of gender, ethnicity, or popularity. Although cliques are most commonly studied during adolescence and in educational settings, they can exist in all age groups and settings.

==Definition==
As children enter adolescence, cultural, biological and cognitive changes cause variation in their daily lives. Adolescents spend far less time with their parents and begin participating in both structured and unstructured peer activities. Without the direct presence of their parents or other adults, their peer network begins to become the primary context for most socialization and activity. There was an explanation given by B. Bradford Brown on the psychological development stages in adolescents, and one of the stages He named &quot;to fit in&quot; stage, which means to find secure affiliations and obtain approval from peers. He said that adolescents spend a lot more time with their peers than younger children, and are more influence by the peer group than younger children. These social &quot;cliques&quot; fundamentally influence adolescent life and development. Perhaps because they are perceived as an external threat to parental authority, undesired changes in adolescent behavior are often attributed to cliques. In these situations, cliques are described as &quot;social grouping[s] of persons that exhibit a great deal of peer pressure on its members and is exclusive, based on superficial differences&quot;. Researchers, however, question these assumptions: based on empiric data from both experiments and ethnographies they suggest that clique structure characterizes many friendship networks within any given school, not all of which negatively affect adolescents. A more neutral and scientific definition of clique is &quot;a grouping of persons who interact with each other more regularly and intensely than others in the same setting&quot;.

Although cliques can range from two to twelve people, cliques typically consist of five or six people who are homogeneous in age, gender, race, social status, and socioeconomic background. More subtle determinant of group membership, such as shared interests and values, take precedence as adolescents develop more sophisticated, abstract cognitive functions (more here), which allow them to categorize individuals in more subtle ways and better interpret social interactions. Consistent group identities thus allow individuals to cope with the anonymity and intimidation that often accompany the transition into large secondary schools.

Similar cliques may re-emerge in adulthood in specific contexts, characterized by large, undifferentiated, anonymous crowds. Overall, cliques are a transitory social phase. In general, cliques first form in early adolescence with strict gender segregation, but by middle adolescence, some mixed-gender activities within the peer crowds foster close, cross-sex friendships which begin to restructure the clique. During late adolescence, the organized clique structure typically dissolves into associated sets of couples, which then remain the primary social unit into and throughout adulthood.

Cliques are different from other types of peer groups often seen in the average school, which are often reputation-based groups such as jocks or nerds. The major difference is that these reputation-based groups do not necessarily interact with each other, whereas members of a clique do interact with one another and have frequent social interactions. For example, football players are considered jocks, but not all members of a football team always interact with each other.

==Clique membership==
===Common misconceptions===
Although the popular media portrays female cliques almost exclusively (see examples in movies, television, and young adult fiction), clique membership is almost equally prevalent in adolescent boys. Girls do, however, tend to form cliques earlier (11 years old as compared with 13 or 14 among boys), which may contribute to the greater popular salience of female cliques. Additionally, the activities central to most female cliques include gossip and emotional sharing; this behavior visibly increases, revealing female cliques to the outside observer. Male cliques, on the other hand, tend to center around activities that have occurred before the formation of the clique (common examples include sports and other shared activities or interests, such as music or reading), and thus may draw less attention to the appearance of male cliques. Male cliques may have also gone largely unnoticed because they often appear less exclusive toward the non-clique peer group members. This last difference may arise because males more frequently reported ambitions related to acceptance and status throughout their crowd, whereas females more often aspired to status and close bonds with only a few peers (i.e. a clique). Males were also more likely to consider actively exclusive behavior unethical, as were younger adolescents. The stereotype of cruel, unwelcoming clique members is well supported in some cases, but other cliques are more open to drifters. Both attitudes appear in some cliques of both sexes and all social groups become more permeable with age. Similarly, although adolescents tend to associate with others of the same ethnicity and socioeconomic status, clique membership is equally common across ethnicity and economic background. The characteristics of the distinct cliques within each demographic group also vary equally, although members of cliques in one crowd or demographic group may not perceive all of the distinctions in others (see also crowds).

===Forms of association===
A number of recent studies confirm that regardless of gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status, adolescents tend to fall into one of three categories: group members, liaisons, and isolates.
# Group member: The majority of group members&#x27; social interactions occur within the same small group. They comprise less than half of any given school population at a time, with a higher concentration among girls and younger grades.
# Liaisons: Liaisons associate with a few members of multiple cliques and are generally regarded positively by their peers.
# Isolates: Characterized by few, if any, close peer relationships, these individuals do not regularly interact with any clique members. Isolated can be further classified by social agency:
## Volunteer status – these isolates deliberately avoid forming relationships.
## Forced status – peers actively exclude, mock, or victimize these isolates (see relational aggression and bullying).

===Stability over time===
Membership type is far more stable over time than membership in an individual clique: isolates generally remain socially disengaged, liaisons remain equally consistent, and &quot;group members&quot; frequently switch from one clique to another, but typically remain group members over time. The objective cliques themselves remain surprisingly stable as well. On average, cliques lose around one third of their members over a given school year, but new members with similar characteristics tend to replace the deserters, maintaining the general identity of the clique. Clique membership becomes more stable across time, as well as more permeable, less exclusive, and less hierarchical. Contrary to popular belief, individual friendships are far less stable across the school year. This is particularly true of high-status cliques and individuals, in which clique members must critically analyse their friendships and socialize only with their most popular peers or risk losing membership and status.

==Within clique structure==
===Popularity===
Advanced and adaptable social skills are the best predictors of popularity, but further predictors of popularity are difficult to identify, primarily because the schema of &quot;popularity&quot; represents the interaction between two distinct concepts. Popularity breaks down into sociometric status (sometimes called &quot;likability&quot;), which measures peers&#x27; private feelings toward the individual, and perceived popularity, which reflects the individual&#x27;s status, prestige, and power.

Socio-metric status is determined by fairly universally valuable characteristics including social skills, friendliness, and sense of humor. The foundations of perceived popularity, on the other hand, vary widely. Some popular adolescents are high in both characteristics, but they more often develop in distinct individuals and cliques, all considered &quot;popular&quot; during adolescence.

Regardless of popularity type, highly popular individuals influence local norms and behaviors in similar ways: &quot;adolescents are easily swayed by the opinions of high-status peers to endorse activities they might otherwise reject and to run the other way from activities endorsed by low-status peers, even if they secretly enjoy them&quot;. The popular individuals themselves, however, fare differently depending on the root of their status. Several recent studies proved the discriminant validity of the two groups and found that perceived popularity in high school is predictive of alcohol use, sexual activity, and smoking. It may also be associated with a lasting drop in sociometric status. Several recent studies suggest that long-term outcomes are generally more positive for individuals who were neither Isolates nor among the most popular during adolescence.

==Between clique structure==
===Personal factors===
A status hierarchy much like that within individual cliques organizes the various cliques within each peer crowd. The crowds within a given school are also perceived hierarchically. Crowd ranking can sometimes change but is generally quite stable across time and schools. Part of a clique&#x27;s popularity status is based on the crowd with which its members associate, thus similarly popular cliques within the same crowd are more likely to move within the hierarchy than are similar crowds within the larger peer context.

Both because students meet and seek friends with others who share their interests (&quot;selection&quot;) and because much of clique members time, both free and structured, takes place in the company of the other members (&quot;socialization&quot;), cliques are usually defined by common attitudes and activities. Among the most powerful determinants of clique membership are orientation toward school, orientation toward teen culture, and involvement in antisocial behavior.

====Orientation toward school====
Because studying time and partying time conflict, most individuals are rarely exposed to individuals from the opposite end of this spectrum during unstructured time. Membership in the same clique with peers whose values are highly distinct is thus uncommon. Individuals with only somewhat different views of school, however, are likely to belong to the same clique, and socialization is likely to decrease their differences over time. For example, girls&#x27; decisions about enrollment in advanced math are significantly related to those of their close friends. A study of 78 high schools found that even controlling for past achievement, the GPAs of an individual&#x27;s close friends reliably help predict grades; in fact &quot;of all the characteristics of friends that influence adolescents&#x27; behavior, their friends&#x27; school performance has the greatest impact, not only on their own academic achievement, but also on their involvement in problem behavior and drug use.&quot;

====Orientation toward teen culture====
Similar taste in music and clothing signal others with potentially shared interests and values and often suggest the leisure activities and substance use patterns of which they approve. Thus adolescents emulating similar cultural standards are likely to become friends and these friends are likely to encourage these aspects of their attitudes, behaviors, and dress. Participation in subcultures can also reinforce belonging. In many cases, clique members can be easily identified based on dress alone.

====Antisocial activity====

Research does not support the common belief that troubled adolescents have few or no friends. Instead, such individuals gravitate toward one another and form their own cliques, although these friendships do often differ from the friendships of more socially acceptable children. This general self-sorting trend applies in different ways to specific kinds of antisocial behavior. A few of the most studied are substance use, aggression, and depressive symptoms.
* Substance use
Similarity in substance use is one of the most powerful factors in clique development and lasting membership, even serving as the earliest predictor of cross-gender friendships and the most common basis for multi-ethnic cliques. Alcohol and drug use are predicted by the interaction between number of substance using friends, the extent of their substance use, and perceived closeness to those friends; a substance-free adolescent is thus unlikely to seek out or be accepted by a clique characterized by frequent substance use and even more unlikely to remain substance-free long after entering such clique
Cliques typically fall into one of four categories and clique membership reliably predicts individual behavior.
** &quot;High Functioning&quot; cliques consisted of &quot;a network of high-achieving friends who were involved in school-based extracurricular activities and who reported low use of alcohol and few symptoms of depression.&quot;
** &quot;Maladjusted&quot; cliques &quot;showed the opposite pattern&quot;: uninvolved in school performance and organized activities, used alcohol frequently and to excess, and reported multiple symptoms of depression.
** &quot;Disengaged&quot; cliques did not encourage engagement &quot;in much of anything, including drinking.&quot;
** &quot;Engaged&quot; cliques consisted of friends who &quot;engaged in school, achieved decent grades, and neither abstained from nor abused alcohol.&quot;
Members of &quot;High Functioning&quot; and &quot;Engaged&quot; cliques demonstrated the best long-term outcomes, whereas &quot;Maladjusted&quot; clique membership predicted low achievement, chronic substance abuse, and confrontation with authorities and &quot;Disengaged&quot; clique members and others who abstained completely typically exhibited abnormally high anxiety and inhibition.
* Aggression
Gravitation toward similar peer groups can be especially dangerous for adolescents with aggressive tendencies. A recent observational study on antisocial, aggressive boys established that clique members tended to live in the same neighborhood, where they met and bonded through unstructured, unsupervised activities. Since antisocial groups encourage antisocial behavior, aggressive behaviors tend to escalate rapidly within groups of aggressive adolescents. In the case of bullies this effect is so detrimental that those without any friends are actually more likely to improve over time than those with friends and generally experience better long-term outcomes. In the most extreme cases, these groups may become gangs or practice less organized, but equally dangerous, violent delinquency
* Depression

Although these maladjusted, detrimental cliques can develop among adolescents of either gender, those based on aggression and delinquency are more often observed in males. In females, adjustment problems are more often manifested as internalizing problems, rather than the externalizing problems common among their male peers. Research shows, however, that both internalizing and externalizing behaviors are negatively related to the subjective sense of strong, reliable group belonging, even controlling for adolescent age, gender, ethnicity, family structure, and parents&#x27; educational level.

Because adolescent females, on average, both report stronger feelings of group belonging and place greater importance on this feeling than do their male peers, girls who do not feel accepted may be more susceptible than equally excluded boys to forming and conforming to cliques based on shared maladaptive behavior. If so, differences in internalizing or externalizing behaviors of adolescent boys and girls may be magnified during adolescence, contributing to the significant gender differences observed in adult outcomes such as incarceration and mood disorders. For example, the same cycle of selection and socialization known to exacerbate aggression applies to the internalizing behaviors associated with depression. One study on the emergence of depression in adolescence found that even controlling for the effects of age and pubertal development, gender predicted several small but significant differences: (a) depressive symptoms and negative peer relations predicted increasing levels of reassurance-seeking in female subjects; (b) initial levels of reassurance-seeking predicted deteriorating friendship quality among girls and initial levels of depressive symptoms, which were higher among girls, predicted low friendship stability among all subjects, and (c) &quot;reassurance-seeking combined with poor peer experiences predicted increases in girls&#x27; depressive symptoms.&quot;

Perhaps related to the role of reassurance-seeking, those who both value and experience social acceptance are far less likely to exhibit problem behavior than those who value group membership equally, but are uncertain of their relationship. This relationships is better predicted by self-esteem than the actual quality of the relationships, although also directly related to discordance in personal and peer ratings of status. This effect likely arises cyclically: troubled children are rejected by their peers for their undesirable behavior, while rejected children receive less normative socialization and behave more problematically.

===Demographic factors===
Although there are exceptions, demographic factors typically influence adolescent crowd membership even before real cliques begin to form and often influence clique membership more powerfully than personal or behavioral characteristics. Many of the effects on clique composition described below may be largely attributed to crowd segregation.

====Age====
Because the contemporary school system divides children by age and structures the majority of most adolescents&#x27; time and social exposure, age is the most universal common factor among clique members; notable exceptions include friendships formed in neighborhoods or on the internet and those initiated with early-maturing pubertal girls, all of which are often detrimental to the younger friend.

====Gender====
Gender is perhaps the strongest determinant of clique composition in very early puberty. During childhood and early adolescence social segregation between is almost absolute. However, unlike other factors, gender division is temporary.

====Socioeconomic status====
Another, less advantageous, powerful determinant of clique formation is socioeconomic class. This trend was first published in the famous &quot;Elmtown&#x27;s Youth Study&quot;, which found that &quot;almost never did adolescents from one social class associate with students from a class that was two ranks higher or lower&quot;. A diverse array of follow-up studies have confirmed that class-consciousness steadily increases throughout adolescence, so that by mid-adolescence clique membership across significantly different social backgrounds is highly anomalous.

====Ethnicity====
In the United States race remains an even stronger determinant of friendship than socioeconomic status. Like socioeconomic status, ethnicity is not a strong determinant of childhood friendships, but becomes increasingly potent with age. By high school, ethnically mixed cliques are rarely observed. This pattern of social segregation is strongest between black students and all other students and most prevalent in schools where students are divided into academic tracks. This is because various factors disadvantage black children, affecting performance in some cases and adult decisions in others so that in many cases black children are disproportionately likely to be placed in lower tracks, regardless of intelligence or performance resulting in uneven distribution between tracks in the majority of American high schools. Researchers suggest that because close friends in adolescence &quot;usually have similar attitudes toward school, similar educational aspirations, and similar school achievement levels&quot;, early tracking may both decrease exposure to peers of other racial and socioeconomic backgrounds and decrease perceived similarity with the majority of those peers Racial divisions are most acute in tracked schools but are fundamental to crowd and clique composition in almost all American schools, and thus cannot be attributed to, nor changed by, any one educational program. More encouragingly, however, longitudinal observations suggest that interventions in early childhood may have the potential to influence social segregation: the more schools foster close cross-racial friendships in childhood the less peer group segregation manifests.

====Religion====
A well-established factor in clique composition is religious background, affiliation, and participation. This is somewhat confounded by overlap with socioeconomic status, but also relates to behavioral correlates of religion and selection by both individual and their peers.

===Reputation determinants and effects===
Cliques reputation is often determined by their most noticeable behavioral characteristic that is shared among their members. The characteristic might be so salient that it could dominate the way that members of that clique are perceived and treated by other peers regardless of the individual differences that each member has. For example, a clique group could be perceived as athletic, but say an individual in that group is very smart and gets good grades in school. That individual would be treated based on their athletic characteristics rather than their intellectual abilities. When people are treated based on a single characteristic it changes their self-image, resulting in a change in who they are. This phenomenon is known as the looking glass self; individuals become more like the way they think they are perceived by others. So for the example where the individual was treated based on their athletic abilities rather than their intelligence, that person will likely focus their attention more on sports rather than doing well in school, causing them to become even more like the clique they are a part of. This phenomenon where individuals in a group tend to be more like each other than non-group members is known as group homophily. Children almost always choose to be friends of people who share similarities with themselves, hence why similar characteristics among clique members establish the clique&#x27;s reputation and allow different cliques to be told apart.

==Clique membership and social adjustment in children&#x27;s same-gender cliques==
Most people agree that children are affected by who they associate with, but what is not well understood is the specific characteristics that children of similar types of groups share. The focus of these authors&#x27; research was to discover the different emotional and social effects that members of the same cliques share. For their study they divided the 473 fourth and fifth graders into five groups, which were: competent, tough, average, withdrawn, and incompetent/aggressive. The researchers did this by having students rate their classmates on several characteristics; bright, fun, bully, withdrawn, athletic, prosocial, reactive aggression. They then measured differences among groups by asking children questions regarding peers social status and behavioral characteristics. For example, they asked participants to nominate up to three participating classmates who &quot;tries to get what he or she wants by hitting, shoving, pushing or threatening others&quot;. In addition, they asked children questions about themselves that regarded to levels of loneliness and children&#x27;s social dissatisfaction.

The researcher&#x27;s discovered differences in emotional well-being and social satisfaction between different types of clique groups. They found that competent and average groups showed positive characteristics such as good interpersonal skills, whereas withdrawn, incompetent/aggressive and tough cliques lacked emotional well-being and social satisfaction. Another discovery was that social status levels did not distinguish average, competent and tough cliques from one another. Therefore, if an individual is in one of these three groups they are no more likely to have a high social status than a low social status. Their conclusion to these findings was that even when taking into account individuals social status level, the type of clique people are in has a significant effect on their social and emotional characteristics.

==Change and stability in childhood==
A recent study done by Witvliet, Van Lier, Cuijpers and Koot shows the differences in behavioral characteristics between clique members and non-clique members in early elementary school, the stability of clique membership and whether the differences in these characteristics are gender oriented. Three hundred first-grade students (151 boys, 149 girls) from eleven different elementary schools in the Netherlands participated. The children were examined by being asked to determine their best friends. This friendship was considered valid if the elected friendship was reciprocated by the other child. The child was considered to be in a clique when the following criteria were met 1) a clique consisted of at least three children 2) each child had to have more connections with members than non-members and 3) a link had to occur between all members of clique. Children were then rated by their peers to determine who was liked the most versus who was liked the least. The children were also asked to determine behavioural characteristics of participants and who best fit the description of characteristics such as aggressive, anxious, etc. The peer study was followed through every spring and children were given a small reward for their involvement. These results were then used to compare between clique members and non-clique members. These results were also used to discuss the children&#x27;s characteristics while also separating based on gender. In first grade, 29 cliques were found with an average of 5.3 members. In second grade 25 cliques were found with an average of 6.2 members. This study suggests that clique members tend to be more adjusted and that gender may have some form of influence on the results. This study showed that isolated girls would have more behavioural problems than isolated boys.

==Effect of cliques on the development of psychopathology in children==
Researches have often conducted studies to determine whether membership to a clique produces positive or negative development. In one 4-year study of 451 children from age nine to twelve, Miranda Witvliet along with Pol A. C. van Lier, Mara Brendgen, Hans M. Koot, and Frank Vitaro examined longitudinal associations between clique membership status and internalizing and externalizing problems during late childhood. In this quasi-experiment the researchers aimed to discover if clique membership status was linked to increases in children&#x27;s psychopathology. Children from five different elementary schools in northwestern Quebec, Canada were the participants of this particular study. In the study, clique membership status was identified through social network analysis, and peer nominations were used to assess internalizing and externalizing problems. The study used the program Kliquefinder to identify clique membership status through social network analysis. Through use of behavioural descriptions on the Pupil Evaluation Inventory (PEI), peer nominations of externalizing and internalizing behaviors were obtained.

Through this study, Witvliet, van Lier, Brendgen, Koot, and Vitaro noted that externalizing problems increased among clique members. They found that clique members compared with isolated children showed, on average, an increase in externalizing problems across that same period. While no sex differences were found in the link between clique membership status and internalizing problems, the association found between clique membership and an increase in externalizing problems was specific to boys only. The researchers claimed that these results support the hypothesis that clique membership protects children against developing internalizing problems.

==Decline of cliques==
During middle adolescence, the social norms that once enforced sex cleavage shift to encourage mixed-sex socialization. Single-sex cliques begin to seek out the company of opposite-sex cliques, although at first almost all direct interaction remains within the individual cliques despite the presence of the other clique(s). Gradually, intersex relationships and mixed sex cliques develop, closely followed by the first romantic relationships, which typically appear among early-pubertal, high-status, more physically developed adolescents. Over the course of late adolescence romantic relationships replace clique hierarchies as the most potent determinants of social status and networks of dating couples eventually replace more rigidly structured cliques.

The chronological relationship between changing gender dynamics and the dissolution of organized, hierarchical cliques is well-established, but not fully understood. One theory asserts that sex cleavage both arises and wanes because cliques are largely sorted by common interests: girls and boys are generally interested in different activities until dating emerges, after which they share a highly valued activity.(164) This idea is consistent with the direct relationship between pubertal development and the appearance of other-sex friends.
One possible explanation for this progression argues that children are socialized from childhood to conform to gender roles and during early adolescence cognitive developments promote active self-presentation and anxiety over peer-perceptions; as a result, early adolescents become more consciously aware of both the benefits of conventional gender identity and the threat of ridicule or rejection in response to unorthodox behavior. According to this framework, gender segregation subsides because the same inculcated gender roles that prompt children to distance themselves from anything associated with the opposite sex also encourage adolescents and adults to demonstrate heterosexual desire and sexual/seductive competence. This argument explains the drastic shift in the targets of ridicule from those who were too androgynous in middle school to those who can not or do not attract sexual attention in high school.

The effects of such social enforcement of gender-roles, may take the form of relational aggression, bullying, and gay bullying.

==Implications==
Perhaps the most consequential finding from the empirical study of adolescent cliques is that they are not an inherently negative force, but rather part of normative development in our society. Although it is certainly true that certain cliques can negatively influence development, others can actually benefit adolescents. In cases in which clique influence is negative, it is encouraging to note that while most forms of interventions are fairly ineffective and peer group interventions frequently produce iatrogenic effects, interventions with parents have yielded encouraging results.

<doc id="1267768" wikidata="Q2375570" url="?curid=1267768" title="Oriental Adventures">
<text>Oriental Adventures (abbreviated OA) is the title shared by two hardback rulebooks published for different versions of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;) fantasy roleplaying game. Each version of &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; provides rules for adapting its respective version of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; for use in campaign settings based on the Far East, rather than the medieval European setting assumed by most &quot;D&amp;D&quot; books. Both versions of &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; include example campaign settings.

==&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;==
The original &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; () was written by Gary Gygax, David &quot;Zeb&quot; Cook, and François Marcela-Froideval, and published in 1985 by TSR, Inc. as a 144-page hardcover for use with the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;AD&amp;D&quot;) 1st edition rules. The book was edited by Steve Winter, Mike Breault, Anne Gray, and Thad Russell. The book&#x27;s cover art was by Jeff Easley, with interior illustrations by Roger Raupp, James Holloway, Easley, and Dave Sutherland.

In 1999, a paperback reprint of the first edition was released.

===Campaign features===
&quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; contains rules for ten character classes and three races to be used in place of standard &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; classes and races. The book presents new versions of the barbarian (here a warrior of the steppes, or a dweller of the forest or jungle) and monk, as well as new classes such as the ninja, kensai, wu-jen, and shukenja.

Kensai are weapons masters who &quot;seek to perfect their weapons technique to the exclusion of all else. They are deadly in combat, but cannot use magical weaponry because it detracts from the appreciation of their skill&quot;. Wu-jen are spellcasters who must strictly follow their personal taboos to avoid losing all of their spell powers. Shukenja are clerics who become punished if they kill enemies too often. A ninja character must take one of the other classes as well as the ninja class. In keeping with their secret nature, ninja use their normal class as a cover identity; a ninja must be careful to keep his identity secret, as loss of honor (and sudden death) may occur if the PC is unmasked. The other classes introduced in the book are the sohei, the bushi (peasant warriors), the samurai, and the yakuza. The three new character races are the korobokuru (roughly equivalent to dwarves, without their tempers and greediness), the hengeyokai (intelligent animal beings that are able to shape-change into human form), and the spirit folk (humanoids whose life force is linked to the well-being of a specific location). The book draws on the history of China, Korea, and Japan, and includes information on families, clans, caste, and honor.

The original &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; introduced two major innovations to the AD&amp;D system. Although previous TSR publications, such as &quot;Deities &amp; Demigods&quot;, had touched on using non-European settings for the game, &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; was the first official supplement devoted entirely to roleplaying in a non-Western setting. &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; also introduced a new game mechanic to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;; it was the first official supplement to include rules for non-weapon proficiencies. Every character is expected to possess proficiencies in the noncombat arts with skills such as calligraphy, etiquette, animal handling, iaijutsu (fast draw), and bowyer. Both non-weapon proficiencies and non-European settings were explored in more detail in the 2nd edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; rules.

The book includes an honor system, in which honor points are lost when a character behaves poorly or damages the family name; the player must eventually stop playing that character, if such behavior continues. The personal honor of a character affects the honor of the character&#x27;s family. The character&#x27;s family background is also determined by a system which generates a character&#x27;s immediate family and ancestors, determines family honor and status, and also provides characters with their birthrights.

Also included are detailed rules for karate and other martial arts styles, which enable a Dungeon Master to create new styles of martial arts and techniques using a range of available options. All characters may study martial arts, provided they can find masters to teach them; monks and shukenja start their adventuring lives with some martial arts training. Each character class also has its own unique ki powers, which become more effective as characters advance through each level.

The original &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; includes a lengthy section of background information for the fantasy setting known as Kara-Tur. Kara-Tur was later made a continent of Abeir-Toril. TSR went on to produce eight adventure modules using the &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; rules and the Kara-Tur setting.

Gary Gygax intended to incorporate the material from &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; into revised versions of the &quot;Players Handbook&quot; and &quot;Dungeon Masters Guide&quot;, but left TSR shortly after announcing the project. &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; was TSR&#x27;s biggest seller in 1985. Little, if any, material from &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; was incorporated into the AD&amp;D 2nd Edition core books, and &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; itself was never revised for a 2nd Edition.

===Reception===
In Issue 74 of &quot;White Dwarf&quot;, Ashley Shepherd felt that this game was &quot;a completely new version of &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;&quot;, adding &quot;The old stand-bys of the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; system are still in the rules, but the elements have been intelligently modified to produce something that is far greater than the sum of its parts.&quot; Shepherd liked the new character classes, noting that the monk was in its proper Eastern context, and that the ninja was the best version Shepherd had seen. Shepherd also liked the new skill system of proficiency slots, and felt these should be extended to all of &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;, not just this setting. Shepherd felt that the honor system was a good touch, and that the real strength of the new martial arts system was that the gamemaster was now able to construct any number of new styles of combat. Shepherd compared &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; to rival role-playing game &quot;Bushido&quot;, and felt that &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; was a better choice as a game system. Shepherd concluded by giving the game an excellent rating of 9 out of 10, saying, &quot;By remaining compatible with the rest of &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;, [designer] Dave Cook has written an excellent set of rules which should be very popular. &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; has even persuaded me to start playing &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; again.&quot;

In the November 1986 edition of &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot;, Matthew J. Costello noted that although based on &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;, this product &quot;aspires to more than supplemental status. It contains a tremendous amount of information about &quot;bushi&quot;, &quot;samurai&quot; and &quot;ninja&quot;, not to mention the cultural and social background of the Orient.&quot; Costello concluded &quot;&quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; can really stand on its own, with specialized game rules.&quot; 
In Issue 30 of the French games magazine &quot; Casus Belli &quot;, André Foussat warned &quot;Playing &quot;AD&amp;D in&quot; this new environment will require a major effort from the JDM (Japanese Dungeon Master) to integrate the entire rulebook (140 rather dense pages). There are a significant number of references from one section of the book to another and everything is very linked.&quot; However, Foussat admitted that the book excited him and he had his Japanese weapons ready for play.

In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, game critic Rick Swan admitted that the game was heavily derivative of &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; but noted that this publication has &quot;a unique design approach that skillfully integrates game mechanics with background material. It&#x27;s a vivid setting and a fascinating set of rules.&quot; Swan enjoyed the character generation process, commenting, &quot;The resulting characters are richly textured, clearly motivated, and a lot of fun to play.&quot; Hower, Swan warned that &quot;&quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; is not for beginners ... a familiarity with &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; is presumed, and a general understanding of Oriental culture and traditions is helpful.&quot; Swan also noted that this product, published in 1985, was based on the first edition of &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; whereas TSR had published the second edition of AD&amp;D in 1989, &quot;so the referee will have to make a few adjustments when switching between systems.&quot; Swan concluded by giving the game an excellent rating of 3.5 out of 4, saying, &quot;For experienced players, &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; is a delight. A sophisticated, challenging game, it&#x27;s the best Eastern-flavored RPG ever published.&quot;

Scott Taylor of &quot;Black Gate&quot; listed the &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; as #6 on the list of &quot;Top 10 &#x27;Orange Spine&#x27; &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; Hardcovers By Jeff Easley, saying &quot;I&#x27;m guessing that if there is one book on this list a lot of folks don&#x27;t own, it is this one, but that doesn’t mean this kind of epic &#x27;in the clouds&#x27; duel between a samurai and a ninja isn&#x27;t worth every penny!&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted the book seemed to be influenced &quot;as much by lurid pulp stereotypes, Yellow Peril propaganda, and the lingering specter of European imperialism ... It&#x27;s a kind of monolithic mush of fantasy &#x27;Asianness&#x27; that verges on parody.&quot;

===Other releases===
TSR released several products with the &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; logo. This includes a series of modules numbered OA1 to OA7, the first five of which (&quot;Swords of the Daimyo&quot;, &quot;Night of the Seven Swords&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Blood of the Yakuza&quot;, and &quot;Mad Monkey vs. the Dragon Claw&quot;) were released for first edition &quot;AD&amp;D.&quot; The sixth module (&quot;Ronin Challenge&quot;) was released for the second edition, as was the seventh module (&quot;Test of the Samurai&quot;) which did not have the &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; logo. The last three of these modules also had the Forgotten Realms logo. The &quot;Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms&quot; boxed set, also for Forgotten Realms, was billed as an expansion for &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot;. Also released for second edition was a volume for the &quot;Monstrous Compendium&quot; series.

==&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3rd edition==
In order to make &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; compatible with the 3rd edition of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; published in 2000, a second version of &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; () was written by James Wyatt and published by Wizards of the Coast in October 2001. The cover art is by Raven Mimura, with interior art by: Matt Cavotta, Larry Dixon, Cris Dornaus, David Martin, Raven Mimura, Wayne Reynolds, Darrell Riche, Richard Sardinha, Brian Snoddy, and Arnie Swekel.

When WotC published a revision of the 3rd edition &quot;D&amp;D&quot; rules known as v3.5 in 2004, an official (but not 100% comprehensive) update of &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; was published in &quot;Dragon&quot; #318 (April 2004), pp. 32–48.

===Campaign features===
The book includes: seven playable new races, including nezumi, vanara, and three different types of spirit folk; five new base classes, including the samurai, sohei, and shugenja; 17 new prestige classes; over one hundred new spells; and seventy-five new monsters, over a dozen of which (including five types of Naga) were given level adjustments for adapting them into playable races. The featured campaign setting of this edition is Rokugan, a campaign setting originally created for the game &quot;Legend of the Five Rings&quot;.

===Reception===
The reviewer from &quot;Pyramid&quot; noted that while the first edition book was a 144-page black and white text, the third edition book was 256 pages and full color.

===Awards===
The second version of &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; won the 2002 Ennie Award for &quot;Best Campaign Setting&quot;.

==&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th edition==
Wizards of the Coast did not release a new edition of &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; for the 4th edition of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, but several &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot; items appeared in 4th edition rules:
*A number of the monsters such as the oni, were included in the 4th edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot;. 
* The shaman was featured in the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook 2&quot; as a leader based on the primal power source. 
* The monk appeared in &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook 3&quot;.
* Samurai and sohei were added as character themes in &quot;Dragon&quot; Issue 404 (October 2011).

<text>A helmet camera, otherwise known as a micro video camera, is an action camera, usually a closed-circuit television camera, attached to a helmet allowing someone to make a visual record from their point of view (POV), while keeping their hands and vision free.

== History ==
Archives containing photos of helmet cameras have surfaced over the last decade. One shows Denver Broncos backup quarterback Jacky Lee wearing a helmet camera at football practice in 1965. A mocked-up helmet camera appears in the opening scenes of &quot;The Private Afternoons of Pamela Mann,&quot; released in 1974, used by a character for voyeurism. Another early and more noble helmet video camera was a 1977 head-mounted camera designed to convert images into tactile sensations for the blind.

Almost a decade later, a Canon CI-10 camera was mounted to the side of Dick Garcia&#x27;s helmet by Aerial Video Systems (AVS) of Burbank, CA at the Nissan USGP 500 World Championship at Carlsbad Raceway in Carlsbad, CA on June 28, 1986. At this time the helmet camera was used commercially. For the first time, images were transmitted live from this camera by AVS via portable microwave to the ABC broadcast truck, then integrated into their live broadcast. This innovative system showed viewers the rider&#x27;s Point of View of the race as it unfolded.

 Another early innovator of video helmet camera technology was Mark Schulze, who created a system for use while producing &quot;The Great Mountain Biking Video&quot; in 1987. &quot;Schulze stripped-down a red motorcycle helmet and jury-rigged a mounting for the first consumer color video chip camera. A cable ran from the camera to a padded backpack that contained a Panasonic VHS portable video recorder and a DC-lead-acid battery for power, which made the rig heavy, unwieldy, and hot.

This pioneering technology brought an engaging perspective to live sports television and action sports videos and eventually gave way to button and lipstick cameras. The helmet cam then became a standard piece of equipment, worn by umpires, catchers, goalies and referees for live television as well as BMX riders, surfers, skiers, skydivers, hockey and soccer players and other sports aficionados, to record and share their experiences.

In 1991, the World League of American Football introduced the innovation of a miniature camera mounted on the right side of the VSR-3 Riddell helmet worn by quarterbacks. This rig was developed by USA Network and Aerial Video Systems (AVS). An antenna was placed in the crown of the helmet between an inflatable pad and the shell. Each of these Helmet-Cams cost $20,000 and transmitted live game action. These helmet cams were briefly used to provide live player&#x27;s-eye-view footage in professional American football. However, their use was discontinued after players complained of the extra weight, and TV networks became concerned about the aggressive behavior the cameras captured.

In 2002, after graduating with a degree in Visual Arts from UCSD, Nick Woodman, a long-time surfer, created the GoPro camera. This was a small, wearable camera with a waterproof housing for people to share their personal experiences in sports and other endeavors with the world.

Today&#x27;s generation of helmet cameras offer features like on-screen menus, high-definition format, wireless transmitting to an offsite recording device, waterproof enclosures, multiple mounts and 3D capabilities.

== Camera types ==
Helmet cameras generally fall into two main categories; CMOS and CCD type. Although helmet cameras take on a variety of forms, the majority are small cylindrical cameras resembling a tube of lipstick or a bullet. Helmet cameras may be connected to a video recording device with video input capability, such as a handheld camcorder, or purpose built digital video recorder.

CCD helmet cameras are based upon the charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensor. They typically operate on 12 VDC power and output an analog type signal. These cameras draw more power than CMOS cameras but offer superior picture quality and better color replication.

CMOS helmet cameras are based upon the complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor. They typically operate on 5 VDC and draw very little power. CMOS cameras are also generally smaller than the CCD type.

== Applications ==

Many sports enthusiasts use helmet cameras to capture the essence of the sports they love. For example, many paraglider pilots carry a bullet camera to record their flights. This can be mounted on the helmet, foot or elsewhere to capture unique camera angles. There are many samples of helmet camera videos available on the net. Wearing helmet cameras is also proving popular with cyclists as a safety aid as it allows cyclists to record their journeys and to record any incidents from their point of view. This recording can be used in a court as evidence.

In 2006, a British cyclist was convicted of abusing traffic wardens, using evidence from a helmet camera. Also in 2006, in the documentary &quot;Race To Dakar&quot;, Charley Boorman, Matt Hall and Simon Pavey used helmet cams to document their participation the 2006 Dakar rally. Out of the trio, Pavey was the only member of the &quot;Race To Dakar&quot; team wearing the camera to make it to the Senegalese Capital and (the rally&#x27;s finish). 

In 2011, Ben Maher won the Martin Collins Eraser Stakes at London Olympia horse show while wearing a helmet camera. Firefighters have begun to utilize helmet cams as a tool to assess their responses to fires and allow non-firefighters to see the reality of what occurs inside a burning building. One technological improvement that fire departments would employ would be thermal imaging detection of differences in heat.

Helmet cameras are also being used in various militaries, where video footage can be streamed back to a command center or military outpost. A notable instance of this was the U.S. military&#x27;s killing of Osama bin Laden, where live video footage of the raid is believed to have been streamed to the White House. In 2013, Royal Marine Alexander Blackman was convicted of murder for killing a captive Taliban insurgent; footage from incident, recorded on a helmet camera, was used in Blackman&#x27;s court-martial. The conviction was overturned in 2017 and reduced to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility with Blackman being released from jail. The helmet camera, has been the focus of the Discovery Channels latest war series &quot;Taking Fire&quot; about the 101st Airborne in the Korengal documenting their personal war footage.

In 2012, on the occasion of the 50th birthday of RP FLIP (&quot;Floating Instrument Platform&quot;), several GoPro action cameras were placed on various positions aboard the research vessel to capture it as it flipped and descended into the ocean. In 2016 &quot;a camera recovered from the helmet of a dead fighter offers a contrasting picture of chaos and panic in a battle with Kurdish peshmerga.&quot;
