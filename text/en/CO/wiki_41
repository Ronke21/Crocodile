<text>The Academy of Fine Arts Vienna () is a public art school in Vienna, Austria. Founded in 1688 as a private academy, it is now a public university. The Academy is also known for twice rejecting admission to a young Adolf Hitler in 1907 and 1908.

== History ==
The Academy of Fine Arts Vienna was founded in 1688 as a private academy modelled on the Accademia di San Luca and the Parisien Académie de peinture et de sculpture by the court-painter Peter Strudel, who became the &quot;Praefectus Academiae Nostrae&quot;. In 1701, he was ennobled by Emperor Joseph I as &quot;Freiherr&quot; (Baron) of the Empire. With his death in 1714, the academy temporarily closed.
On 20 January 1725, Emperor Charles VI appointed the Frenchman Jacob van Schuppen as Prefect and Director of the Academy, which was refounded as the &quot;k.k. Hofakademie der Maler, Bildhauer und Baukunst&quot; (Imperial and Royal Court Academy of painters, sculptors and architecture). Upon Charles&#x27;s death in 1740, the academy at first declined, however during the rule of his daughter Empress Maria Theresa, a new statute reformed the academy in 1751. The prestige of the academy grew during the deanships of Michelangelo Unterberger and Paul Troger, and in 1767 the archduchesses Maria Anna and Maria Carolina were made the first Honorary Members. In 1772, there were further reforms to the organisational structure. In 1776, the engraver Jakob Matthias Schmutzer founded a school of engraving. This Imperial-Royal Academy of Engraving in the Annagasse soon competed with the Court Academy.

Chancellor Wenzel Anton Kaunitz integrated all existing art academies into the &quot;k.k. vereinigten Akademie der bildenden Künste&quot; (Imperial and Royal Unified Academy of Fine Arts). The word &quot;vereinigten&quot; (unified) was later dropped. In 1822 the art cabinet grew significantly with the bequest of honorary member Anton Franz de Paula Graf Lamberg-Sprinzenstein. His collection still forms the backbone of the art on display.

In 1872, Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria approved a statute making the academy the supreme government authority for the arts. A new building was constructed according to plans designed by Theophil Hansen in the course of the layout of the Ringstraße boulevard. On 3 April 1877, the present-day building on Schillerplatz in the Innere Stadt district was inaugurated, the interior works, including ceiling frescos by Anselm Feuerbach, continued until 1892. In 1907 and 1908, young Adolf Hitler, who had come from Linz, was twice denied admission to the drawing class. He stayed in Vienna, subsisting on his orphan allowance, and tried unsuccessfully to continue his profession as an artist. Soon he had withdrawn into poverty and started selling amateur paintings, mostly watercolours, for meagre sustenance until he left Vienna for Munich in May 1913 (see also, Paintings by Adolf Hitler).
During the Austrian &quot;Anschluss&quot; to Nazi Germany from 1938 to 1945, the academy, like other Austrian universities, was forced to purge its staff and student body of Jews and others who fell under the purview of the racially discriminatory Nuremberg Laws. After World War II, the academy was reconstituted in 1955 and its autonomy reconfirmed. Eduard von Josch, the secretary of the Academy, was dismissed for being a member of the NSDAP. The academy has had university status since 1998, but retained its original name. It is currently the only Austrian university without the word &quot;university&quot; in its name.

== Structure ==
The academy is divided into the following institutes:
* &quot;Institute for Fine Arts&quot;, which houses thirteen departments: Abstract Painting; Art and Digital Media; Art and Photography; Arts and Research; Conceptual Art; Contextual Painting; Expanded Pictorial Space; Figurative Painting; Graphic Arts and Printmaking Techniques; Object Sculpture; Performative Art – Sculpture; Video and Video-installation; Textual Sculpture
* &quot;Institute for Art Theory and Cultural Studies&quot; (art theory, philosophy, history);
* &quot;Institute for Conservation and Restoration&quot;;
* &quot;Institute for Natural Sciences and Technologies in Art&quot;;
* &quot;Institute for Secondary School Teaching Degrees&quot; (craft, design, textile arts);
* &quot;Institute for Art and Architecture&quot;.

The Academy currently has about 900 students, almost a quarter of which are foreign students. Its faculty includes &quot;stars&quot; such as Peter Sloterdijk. Its library houses about 110,000 volumes and its &quot;etching cabinet&quot; (&quot;Kupferstichkabinett&quot;) has about 150,000 drawings and prints. The collection is one of the biggest in Austria, and is used for academic purposes, although portions are also open to the general public.

==In fiction==

The Academy of Fine Arts in 1908 is the scene of the early chapters of the 2001 alternative history novel &quot;The Alternative Hypothesis&quot; (&quot;La part de l&#x27;autre&quot;) by Éric-Emmanuel Schmitt. It is based on the assumption that had the young Adolf Hitler been accepted he might have become a recognized painter and never entered politics, and never become the dictator of Nazi Germany. The dramatic tension in the book&#x27;s plot develops from the Academy staff, deliberating whether or not to admit Hitler, thinking of it as an unimportant matter concerning a single unknown student – while the readers are aware that in fact, they are deciding the future of the entire world.

<text>The Evangelical People&#x27;s Party (, EVP) was a minor progressive Protestant political party in the Netherlands. It is one of the predecessor parties of the modern-day GroenLinks.

==History==
The EVP was founded in March 1981 by members of the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), which were united in the group &quot;Not by Bread Alone&quot; () and members of the Evangelical Progressive Party, which had previously left the Protestant Anti-Revolutionary Party. Both groups were opposed to the formation of the CDA and its conservative course.

After winning one seat in the 1982 general election (it was unable to do so in 1981), the party joined the opposition. The party became divided between a left wing and a centrist wing. The left wing wanted to co-operate with the Political Party of Radicals (which had split from the Catholic People&#x27;s Party in 1968) and its left-wing allies, the Pacifist Socialist Party and the destalinised Communist Party of the Netherlands. The EVP was more reserved towards the CPN. The centrist wing wanted to co-operate with the Labour Party and the CDA. Although some members were willing to co-operate, the party congress rejected the co-operation with the CPN, the PSP and the PPR in the 1984 European Parliament elections.

After the party lost its sole seat in the 1986 elections, co-operation with other parties become more important. For the 1989 elections the Political Party of Radicals (PPR), Pacifist Socialist Party (PSP) and the Communist Party of the Netherlands initiated a common list GreenLeft. The EVP hesitated to join, and only after the talks were concluded did it opt to enter. It got one candidate on an ineligible eleventh place. In 1991, the party officially dissolved itself into GreenLeft in the Moses and Aaron Church in Amsterdam. Prominent EVP-members became involved in the Left (wing) Cheek, a platform for the New Testament and Politics. This platform still exists, but it is only of limited importance within the party.

==Ideology and issues==
The party combined left-wing ideas with a green program, inspired by the New Testament. The Sermon on the Mount was an important inspiration for the party. The Sermon was seen as an evangelical imperative to create a society where justice, peace and would rule. Important issues for the party were:
*A pacifist foreign policy, especially opposition to the placement of nuclear weapons.
*It sought to formulate an alternative to both capitalism and communism. It proposed the economy of enough, in which incomes would be redistributed, people would get more rest (for instance by a government-financed sabbatical for all) and damage to the environment would be limited.
* The party was progressive on social and ethical issues, such as gay rights and abortion.

== Election results==
=== House of Representatives ===
==Electorate==
The EVP&#x27;s small electorate consisted out of left-wing Protestants, mostly former adherents of the Anti-Revolutionary Party, for whom opposition to the placement of nuclear weapons was an important issue. The party was open to non-religious persons.

==Organisation==

===Linked organisations===
The EVP published a periodical called &quot;EVP info&quot;, which was continued after 1990 as &quot;The Leftwing Cheek&quot; within GreenLeft. Its scientific institute was Foundation for Formation and Education, which published &quot;Schering en Inslag&quot;

===Relationships to other parties===
The party had good relations with the Political Party of Radicals (PPR), which also had its roots in Christian democracy and emphasised green ideals. It also had good relations with the social-democratic Labour Party and the Pacifist Socialist Party (PSP). In 1989 it chose for the PPR and the PSP and merged into the GreenLeft, together with the Communist Party of the Netherlands, a party towards which the EVP was more reserved, because of its atheism, alignment with communist dictatorships and centralised organisation.

<doc id="1282218" wikidata="Q3629485" url="?curid=1282218" title="Ahmed Raza Khan Barelvi">
<text>Ahmed Raza Khan Barelvi (14 June 1856–28 October 1921), known reverentially as A&#x27;la Hazrat, was an Indian Islamic scholar and poet who is considered as the founder of the Barelvi movement. 

Born in Bareilly, British India, Khan wrote on law, religion, philosophy and the sciences, and because he mastered many subjects in both rational and religious sciences he has been called a polymath by Francis Robinson, a leading Western historian and academic who specializes in the history of South Asia and Islam. 

He was an Islamic scholar who wrote extensively in defense of the status of Muhammad in Islam and popular Sufi practices. He influenced millions of people, and today the Barelvi movement has around 200 million followers in the region. Khan is viewed as a Mujaddid, or reviver of Islam by his followers.

==Biography==
===Family background===
Khan was born on 10 Shawwal 1272 Hijri corresponds to 14 June 1856 to an Indian Muslim family in the Mohallah of Jasoli in Bareilly district, North-Western Provinces, British India. 

The family belonged to the Barech tribe of Pashtuns, his ancestor Muhammad Saeedullah Khan, a warrior who accompanied Nader Shah, having migrated from Kandahar (current-day Afghanistan) to Lahore (current-day Pakistan) while the family later settled down in Bareilly. 

His father, Naqi Ali Khan, was an Islamic scholar.

The name corresponding to the year of his birth was al-Mukhtar. His birth name was Muhammad. Khan used the appellation &quot;Abd-ul-Mustafa&quot; (&quot;servant of the chosen one&quot;) prior to signing his name in correspondence.

===Teachers===
According to &quot;Hayat-e-Aala Hazrat&quot; written by Malik Zafaruddin Bihari, some of his famous teachers included:
*Syed Shah Aale Rasul Marehrawi (d.1879)
*Naqi Ali Khan (d. 1880)
*Ahmad Zayni Dahlan Makki (d. 1881)

===Barelvi movement===
Imam Ahmed Raza wrote extensively in defense of his views, countered Wahhabism and the Deobandi movement, and by his writing and activity became the founder of the Barelvi movement. The movement has spread across the globe with followers in Pakistan, India, South Africa and Bangladesh. The movement now has over 200 million followers globally. The movement was largely a rural phenomenon when began but is currently popular among urban, educated Pakistanis and Indians as well as the South Asian diaspora throughout the world.

The efforts of Khan and his associate scholars to establish a movement to counter the Deobandi and Ahl-i Hadith movements resulted to in the institutionalization of diverse Sufi movements and their allies in various parts of the world.

===Jamat Raza E Mustafa===
Khan founded an organization Jamat Raza E Mustafa, on 17 December 1920 with the aim of progress, unity and religious education of the Ahl-E-Sunnat wal Jamat.

===Death===
Ahmed Raza Khan died on 28 October 1921 (25 Safar 1340 AH) at the age of 65. He is buried in Bareilly Sharif Dargah. Urs-e-Razavi is a 3 day long annual event commemorating his death anniversary.

== Books ==
Imam Ahmed Raza Khan wrote several hundred books in Arabic, Persian, and Urdu, including the thirty-volume fatwa compilation &quot;Fatawa Razawiyya&quot;, and &quot;Kanz ul-Iman&quot; (Translation &amp; Explanation of the Qur&#x27;an). Several of his books have been translated into European and South Asian languages.

He also wrote many books on science and physics. In one of his famous books, Fauze Mubeen Dar Radde Harkate Zameen, using the Holy Qur&#x27;an as its guideline, he provided more than 100 arguments that the earth is not rotating but is stationary. In his arguments he has also discussed at length why he believed some of the Newton&#x27;s arguments were false. 

===Kanz ul-Iman (translation of the Qur&#x27;an)===
&quot;Kanz ul-Iman&quot; (Urdu and Arabic: کنزالایمان) is a 1910 Urdu paraphrase translation of the Qur&#x27;an by Khan. It is associated with the Hanafi jurisprudence within Sunni Islam, and is a widely read version of the translation in the Indian Subcontinent. It has been translated into English, Hindi, Bengali, Dutch, Turkish, Sindhi, Gujarati, and Pashto, and also recently translated into Gojri language by Mufti Nazir Ahmed Qadri.

===Husam ul-Haramain===
&quot;Husam ul-Haramain&quot; or Husam al-Harmain Ala Munhir Kufr wal-Mayn (The Sword of the Haramayn at the throat of disbelief and falsehood) 1906, is a treatise which declared infidels the founders of the Deobandi, Ahl-i Hadith and Ahmadiyya movements on the basis that they did not have the proper veneration of Muhammad and finality of prophethood in their writings. In defense of his verdict he obtained confirmatory signatures from 268 scholars in South Asia, and some from scholars in Mecca and Medina. The treatise is published in Arabic, Urdu, English, Turkish and Hindi.

===Fatawa Razawiyya===

&quot;Fatawa Razawiyya&quot; or the full name &quot;al-Ataya fi-Nabaviah&quot; &quot;Fatawa-i Razawiyya&quot; (translates to Verdicts of Imam Ahmed Raza by the blessings of the Prophet) is the main fatwa (Islamic verdicts on various issues) book of his movement. It has been published in 30 volumes and in approx. 22,000 pages. It contains solutions to daily problems from religion to business and from war to marriage.

He reached judgments with regard to certain practices and faith in his book &quot;Fatawa-i Razawiyya&quot;, including:
*Islamic Law is the ultimate law and following it is obligatory for all Muslims;
*To refrain from misguidance is essential;
*It is impermissible to imitate the Kuffar, to associate with the deviants, and to participate in their festivals.

===Hadaiq-e-Bakhshish===

He wrote &quot;na&#x27;at&quot; (devotional poetry in praise of Muhammad) and always discussed him in the present tense. His main book of poetry is &quot;Hadaiq-e-Bakhshish&quot;.

His poems, which deal for the most part with the qualities of Muhammad, often have a simplicity and directness. 

His Urdu couplets, entitled &quot;Mustafa Jaane Rahmat pe Lakhon Salaam&quot; (Hundreds of Thousands of Salutations upon Mustafa, the Paragon of Mercy), are recited in mosques globally. They contain praise of Muhammad, his physical appearance (verses 33 to 80), his life and times, praise of his family and companions, praise of the Awliya and Salihin (the saints and the pious).

===Al Daulatul Makkiya Bil Madatul Ghaibiya===
In 1323 Hijri (1905), Ahmad Raza went for his second Haj. Allamah Shaikh Saleh Kamal a Alim of Makkatul Mukarrama, he presented five questions to Ahmad Raza on behalf of the Ulema of Makkatul Mukarrama, this question was asked by Makkatul Mukarrama Wahhabi Ulema regarding Knowledge of the knowledge of Unseen (Ilm-e-Ghaib). At that time Ahmed Raza was suffering from a high fever, despite the illness he tried to answer all the questions, he answered in such detail that the answer took the form of a book, and this book was named Al Daulatul Makkiya Bil Madatul Ghaibiya.

== Religious views ==
Khan saw an intellectual and moral decline of Muslims in British India. His movement was a mass movement, defending popular Sufism, which grew in response to the influence of the Deobandi movement in South Asia and the Wahhabi movement elsewhere.

Imam Ahmed Raza Khan supported Tawassul, Mawlid, Prophet Muhammad&#x27;s awareness of complete knowledge of the unseen, and other practices which were opposed by Wahhabis/Salafis and Deobandis.

=== Prophet Muhammad ===
In this contrast to the beliefs of the Wahhabis and Deobandis, Ahmed Raza Khan supported the following beliefs:
* Muhammad is a human being made of &quot;nur&quot; (light) and is all-seeing and all-hearing. This contrasts with the Deobandi view that Muhammad was Al-Insān al-Kāmil (perfect person), but still a normal human.
* Muhammad is &quot;Haazir aur Naazir&quot; (all-seeing and all-hearing) which means that Muhammad views and witnesses the actions of his people.
This concept was interpreted by Shah Abdul Aziz in Tafsir-e-Azizi in these words: The prophet is observing everybody, knows their good and bad deeds, and knows the strength of faith (Iman) of every individual Muslim and what has hindered his spiritual progress.

=== Infidels ===
Raza Khan was emphatic in opposing the Hindu influences on Muslim identity. To differentiate between a Muslim and a Infidel he emphatically said:

=== Permissibility of currency notes ===
In 1905, Khan, on the request of contemporaries from Hijaz, wrote a verdict on the permissibility of using paper as a form of currency, entitled &quot;Kifl-ul-Faqeehil fehim Fe Ahkam-e-Kirtas Drahim&quot;.

==Sectarian views==
=== Ahmadis ===
Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian claimed to be the Messiah, Prophet, and Mahdi awaited by some Muslims as well as a Nabi Ummati, a subordinate prophet to Muhammad who came to restore Islam to the pristine form as practiced by Muhammad and early Sahaba. Khan declared Mirza Ghulam Ahmad a heretic and apostate and called him and his followers disbelievers (&quot;kuffar&quot;).

=== Deobandis ===
The theological difference with the Deobandi school began when Ahmed Raza Khan Barelvi objected in writing to some of the following beliefs of Deobandi scholars.
*He opposed the belief of a founder of the Deobandi movement, Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, who stated that God has the ability to lie. This doctrine is called &quot;Imkan-i Kizb&quot;. Gangohi also supported the doctrine that God has the ability to make additional prophets after Muhammad (&quot;Imkan-i Nazir&quot;) and other prophets equal to Muhammad, a doctrine which was opposed by Ahmed Raza Khan Barelvi.
*He opposed the doctrine that Muhammad has not got extensive knowledge of the unseen (&quot;Ilm e Ghaib&quot;).
When Ahmed Raza Khan visited Mecca and Medina for pilgrimage in 1905, he prepared a draft document entitled &quot;Al Motamad Al Mustanad&quot; (&quot;The Reliable Proofs&quot;). In this work, Ahmad Raza branded Deobandi leaders such as Ashraf Ali Thanwi, Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, and Qasim Nanotwi and those who followed them as &quot;kuffar&quot;. Khan collected scholarly opinions in the Hejaz and compiled them in an Arabic language compendium with the title, &quot;Hussam al Harmain&quot; (&quot;The Sword of Two Sanctuaries&quot;), a work containing 34 verdicts from 33 ulama (20 Meccan and 13 Medinese). However, Deobandis claim the evidence provided to the scholars in Arabia were fabricated and that Ahmed Raza Khans takfir of them was unjust, and this initiated a reciprocal series of fatwas between Barelvis and Deobandis which has lasted to the present.

=== Shia ===
Ahmed Raza Khan wrote various books against the beliefs and faith of Shia Muslims and declared various practices of Shia as kufr. He considered most Shiites of his day apostates because, he believed, they repudiated necessities of religion.

=== Wahhabi Movement ===
Ahmed Raza Khan declared Wahhabis as disbelievers (&quot;kuffar&quot;) and collected many fatwas of various scholars against the Wahhabi movement founded by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, who was predominant in the Arabian peninsula, just as he had done with the Ahmadis and Deobandis. Until this day, Khan&#x27;s followers remain opposed to the Wahhabi movement and their beliefs.

==Political views==
Unlike other Muslim leaders in the region at the time, Khan and his movement opposed the Indian independence movement due to its leadership under Mahatma Gandhi, who was not a Muslim.

Imam Ahmed Raza Khan declared that India was Dar al-Islam and that Muslims enjoyed religious freedom there. According to him, those arguing the contrary merely wanted to take advantage of the provisions allowing Muslims living under the non-Muslim rule to collect interest from commercial transactions and had no desire to fight Jihad or perform Hijra. Therefore, he opposed labeling British India to be Dar al-Harb (&quot;abode of war&quot;), which meant that waging holy war against and migrating from India were inadmissible as they would cause disaster to the community. This view of Khan&#x27;s was similar to other reformers Syed Ahmed Khan and Ubaidullah Al Ubaidi Suhrawardy.

The Muslim League mobilized the Muslim masses to campaign for Pakistan, and many of Khan&#x27;s followers played a significant and active role in the Pakistan Movement at educational and political fronts.

==Legacy==
Many religious schools, organizations, and research institutions teach Khan&#x27;s ideas, which emphasize the primacy of Islamic law along with the adherence to Sufi practices and personal devotion to Muhammad.
===Recognition===
* On 21 June 2010, Muhammad al-Yaqoubi, a cleric and Sufi from Syria, declared on Takbeer TV&#x27;s program &quot;Sunni Talk&quot; that the Mujaddid of the Indian subcontinent was Ahmed Raza Khan Barelvi, and said that a follower of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah can be identified by his love of Khan and that those outside of that those outside the Ahlus Sunnah are identified by their attacks on him.
* Allama Muhammad Iqbal (1877–1938), a poet, Sufi, and philosopher, said: &quot;I have carefully studied the decrees of Ahmed Raza and thereby formed this opinion; and his Fatawa bear testimony to his acumen, intellectual caliber, the quality of his creative thinking, his excellent jurisdiction and his ocean-like Islamic knowledge. Once Imam Ahmed Raza forms an opinion he stays firm on it; he expresses his opinion after a sober reflection. Therefore, the need never arises to withdraw any of his religious decrees and judgments. In another place he says, &quot;Such a genius and intelligent jurist did not emerge.&quot;
* Prof. Sir Ziauddin Ahmad, who was the head of the department of Mathematics at Aligarh Muslim University, was once unable to find solutions to some mathematic algorithms, even after he took help from the mathematicians abroad. He decided to visit Germany for the solution but at the request of his friend Sayyed Suleman Ashraf who was a professor of Islamic Studies at Aligarh Muslim University and also the mureed (disciple) of Ahmed Raza, Ziauddin visited Ahmed Raza on a special visit to get answers to his difficult questions, and under the guidance of Ahmed Raza he finally succeeded in getting solutions.
* Justice Naeemud&#x27;deen, Supreme Court of Pakistan: &quot;Maulana Ahmad Raza&#x27;s grand personality, a representation of our most esteemed ancestors, is history-making, and a history uni-central in his self. ... You may estimate his high status from the fact that he spent all his life in expressing the praise of the great and auspicious Holy Prophet (صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم), in defending his veneration, in delivering speeches regarding his unique conduct, and in promoting and spreading the Law of Shariah which was revealed upon him for the entire humanity of all times. His renowned name is &#x27;Muhammad&#x27; (صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم), the Prophet of Almighty Allah. ... The valuable books written by an encyclopedic scholar like Ahmed Raza, in my view, are the lamps of light that will keep enlightened and radiant the hearts and minds of the men of knowledge and insight for a long time.&quot;

<doc id="1282232" wikidata="Q4788332" url="?curid=1282232" title="Ardwold">
<text>Ardwold was the residence of Sir John Craig Eaton and Lady Eaton of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Sir John was the youngest son of Timothy Eaton, the founder of the T. Eaton Company Department Store, or Eaton&#x27;s, and he inherited the business and became its president upon his father&#x27;s death in 1907. Sir John was one of the wealthiest men in Canada, and in 1909 he commissioned a home to be built on &quot;The Hill&quot;, a name used to describe the neighbourhood on the Davenport Hill in Toronto where many wealthy families built their homes. Casa Loma, built by Henry Pellatt and the largest private house ever constructed in Canada, was near Ardwold, as were Spadina House, the mansion of James Austin, and Glenedyth, the estate of Samuel Nordheimer.

Ardwold is a Gaelic term meaning &quot;high, green hill&quot;. The enormous mansion was designed by Toronto architect Frank Wickson of Wickson and Gregg Architectural firm. It was in the Georgian style, and influenced by English and Irish country homes, namely Belton House in Lincolnshire. Ardwold had 50 rooms, 14 bathrooms, and its own hospital. Situated on eleven acres (45,0

00 m2) of landscaped grounds, which included a half-acre (2,000 m2) glassed area housing a conservatory and swimming pool, Ardwold was one of the largest and most luxurious residences in Toronto and the country.Sir John Craig Eaton died in 1922, and his widow Lady Eaton kept the home until 1936, when she sold the land. Eaton moved to the enormous chateau named Eaton Hall at King City, Ontario. After an auction of much of its contents, Ardwold was blown up (the walls were too thick to use ordinary demolition methods). The property was divided into an exclusive housing development named Ardwold Gate. Only the gate lodge on Spadina Road near Austin Terrace remains.

<text>The University of Applied Arts Vienna (, or informally just &quot;Die Angewandte&quot;) is an arts university and institution of higher education in Vienna, the capital of Austria. It has had university status since 1970.

==History==
The predecessor of the &quot;Angewandte&quot; was founded in 1863 as the &quot;k. k. Kunstgewerbeschule&quot; (Vienna School of Arts and Crafts), following the example of the South Kensington Museum in London, now the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, to set up a place of advanced education for designers and craftsmen with the Arts and Crafts School in Vienna. It was closely associated with the &quot;Österreichischen Museums für Kunst und Industrie&quot; (Imperial Royal Austrian Museum of Art and Industry, today known as the MAK).

It was the first school of its kind on the continent. In 1941 it became an institution of higher education. 1941–45 it was called &quot;Reichshochschule fuer angewandte Kunst&quot;, and in 1948 was taken over by the Austrian state as an academy. In 1970 it was awarded the title of a university and in 1998 it was renamed the &quot;Universität für angewandte Künste&quot; (&quot;University of applied arts&quot;).

Famous artists such as Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka, Koloman Moser, Vivienne Westwood, Karl Lagerfeld, Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, Paul Kirnig, Jil Sander, Pipilotti Rist, Matteo Thun, François Valentiny, Hugo Markl and Stefan Sagmeister were part of the university&#x27;s staff or student body. Today its faculty includes many distinguished artists and teachers, such as Judith Eisler, Erwin Wurm, Hartmut Esslinger, Hani Rashid (of Asymptote Architecture), Greg Lynn, Wolf D Prix (of Coop Himmelb(l)au), Peter Weibel and the philosopher Burghart Schmidt. This School also rejected the German chancellor Adolf Hitler in 1908, many historians debate what would happen, if he would be accepted.

==Present==
The university has currently ca. 1,800 students and c. 380 faculty. The students come from 70 different countries to study in the 29 disciplines of the school, structured in 60% Austrians, 25% Europeans and 15% from other countries. The outcome of their processes is made public in ca. 200 exhibitions a year and a multitude of different events and other public presentations.

<doc id="1282235" wikidata="Q262936" url="?curid=1282235" title="Inés Suárez">
<text>Inés Suárez, (; c. 1507 – 1580) was a Spanish conquistadora who participated in the Conquest of Chile with Pedro de Valdivia, successfully defending the newly conquered Santiago against an attack in 1541 by the indigenous Mapuche.

==Early life==
Suárez was born in Plasencia, Extremadura, Spain in 1507. She came to the Americas approximately in 1537, around the age of thirty. It is generally assumed that she was in search of her husband Juan de Málaga, who had left Spain to serve in the New World with the Pizarro brothers. After a long time of continuous searching in numerous South American locations, she arrived in Lima in 1538.

Suárez&#x27;s husband had died before she had reached Peru (she told a compatriot that he died at sea) and the next information that is known of her is in 1539, when she applied for and was granted, as the widow of a Spanish soldier, a small plot of land in Cuzco and encomienda rights to a number of Indians.

Shortly afterward, Suárez became the mistress of Pedro de Valdivia, the conqueror of Chile. The earliest mention of her friendship with Valdivia was after he returned from the Battle of Las Salinas (1538). Although they were from the same area of Spain and at least one novelist relates a tale of long-standing love between them, there is no real evidence that they had met prior to her arrival in Cuzco.

==Conquest of Chile==
In late 1539, over the objections of Francisco Martínez and encouraged by some of his captains, Valdivia, using the intermediary services of a Mercedarian priest, requested official permission for Suárez to become a part of the group of 12 Spaniards he was leading to the South. Francisco Pizarro, in his letter to Valdivia (January 1540) granting permission for Suárez to accompany Valdivia as his domestic servant, addressed the following words to Suárez, &quot;...as Valdivia tells me, the men are afraid to go on such a long trip and you very courageously put yourself in the face of that danger...&quot;

During the long and harrowing trip to the south, Suárez, who was the only white woman on the expedition, in addition to caring for Valdivia and treating the sick and wounded, found water for them in the desert, and saved Valdivia when one of his rivals tried to undermine his enterprise and take his life. The natives, having already experienced the incursions of the Spaniards, (Diego de Almagro, 1535–1536) burned their crops and drove off their livestock, leaving nothing for Valdivia&#x27;s band and the animals which accompanied them. Suarez was a cook and a nurse for the majority of the expedition. She was personally in charge of growing crops and the maintaining of the group&#x27;s livestock. Whenever necessary, she would pick up the sword and fight alongside the rest of the men.

In December 1540, eleven months after they left Cuzco, Valdivia and his band reached the valley of the Mapocho river, where Valdivia was to establish the capital of the territory. The valley was extensive and well populated with natives. Its soil was fertile and there was abundant fresh water. Two high hills provided defensive positions. Soon after their arrival, Valdivia tried to convince the natives of his good intentions, sending delegations bearing gifts for the caciques.

The natives kept the gifts but, united under the leadership of Michimalonco, attacked the Spaniards and were at the point of overwhelming them. Suddenly, the natives threw down their weapons and fled. Captured Indians declared that they had seen a man, mounted on a white horse and carrying a naked sword, descend from the clouds and attack them. The Spaniards decided it was a miraculous appearance of &quot;Santo Iago&quot; (Saint James the Greater who had already been seen during the Reconquista at the battle of Clavijo) and, in thanks, named the new city Santiago del Nuevo Extremo. The city was officially dedicated on February 12, 1541.

===First destruction of Santiago===

In August 1541, when Valdivia was occupied on the coast, Suárez uncovered another plot to unseat him. After the plotters were taken care of, Valdivia turned his attention to the Indians and he invited seven caciques to meet with him to arrange for the delivery of food. When the Indians arrived, Valdivia had them held as hostages for the safe delivery of the provisions and the safety of outlying settlements. On the September 9, Valdivia took forty men and left the city to put down an uprising of Indians near Aconcagua.

Early on the morning of September 10, 1541, a young &quot;yanakuna&quot; brought word to Captain Alonso de Monroy, who had been left in charge of the city, that the woods around the city were full of natives. Suárez was asked if she thought that the Indian hostages should be released as a peace gesture. She replied that she saw it as a bad idea; if the Indians overpowered the Spaniards, the hostages would provide their only bargaining power. Monroy accepted her counsel and issued a call for a council of war.

Just before dawn on September 11, mounted Spaniards rode out to engage the Indians, whose numbers were estimated first at 8,000 and later at 20,000, and who were led by Michimalonco. In spite of the advantage of their horses and their skill with their swords, by noon the Spaniards were pushed into a retreat toward the east, across the Mapocho River; and, by mid-afternoon, they were backed up to the plaza itself.

All day the battle raged. Fire arrows and torches set fire to most of the city; four Spaniards were killed along with a score of horses and other animals. The situation became desperate. The priest, Rodrigo González Marmolejo, said later that the fight was like the Day of Judgment for the Spaniards and that only a miracle saved them.

All day Suárez had been carrying food and water to the fighting men, nursing the wounded, giving them encouragement and comfort. The historian Mariño de Lobera wrote of her activities during the battle: 

Suárez recognized the discouragement of the men and the extreme danger of the situation; she offered a suggestion. All day the seven caciques who were prisoners of the Spaniards, had been shouting encouragement to their people. Suárez proposed that Spaniards decapitate the seven and toss their heads out among the Indians in order to frighten them. There was some objection to the plan, since several men felt that the fall of the city was imminent and that the captive caciques would be their only bargaining advantage with the Indians. Suárez insisted that hers was the only viable solution to their problem. She then went to the house where the chieftains were guarded by Francisco Rubio and Hernando de la Torre and gave the order for the execution. Mariño de Lobera tells that the guard, La Torre, asked, &quot;In what manner shall we kill them, my lady?&quot; &quot;In this manner,&quot; she replied, and, seizing la Torre&#x27;s sword, she herself cut off the heads. 
After the seven were decapitated and their heads thrown out among the Indians, Suárez donned a coat of mail and a helmet and, throwing a hide cloak over her shoulders, she rode out on her white horse. According to an eyewitness, &quot;...she went out to the plaza and put herself in front of all the soldiers, encouraging them with words of such exaggerated praise that they treated her as if she were a brave captain...instead of a woman masquerading as a soldier in iron mail.&quot;

In a second version of these events, Gerónimo de Bibar points out that, on the same occasion, Inés grabbed a sword and, heading towards the location where the Spaniards had some indigenous caciques, killed them. She then goes on to be extremely disappointed in the lack of bravery on the part of the soldiers and commands them to at least move the bodies in the view of the attacking armies. She considered herself to be above these men in masculinity and looked down on the mental weakness of her fellow soldiers. One of the knights, Gil Gonzalez de Avila, suffered a terrible blow that made him bleed a lot. Seeing that he was. unable to mount his horse, Ines went up to the knight and stopped all the blood coming from his veins, allowing him to continue the fight. Seeing her medical expertise in action, the other fighting soldiers saw and were emboldened by her courage. In another version of the recounted events, Ines goes up to the Spaniard and tells him kill the hostages in the way the El Cid would have killed Muslims in the Reconquista.

The Spaniards took advantage of the confusion and disorder engendered among the Indians by the gory heads, and spurred on Suárez, succeeded in driving the now disordered Indians from the town. One historian wrote, &quot;The Indians said afterward that the Christians would have been defeated were it not for a woman on a white horse.&quot;

The notion that Ines ordered the killing of the seven Indian leaders in Santiago while the city was under attack is questioned by some scholars. Some say that it is because Valvidia never told King Charles V about this in his letters.

In 1545, in recognition of her courage and valor, Valdivia rewarded Suárez with an encomienda. His testament of dedication said in part: 

==Later life==

Suárez continued to live openly with Pedro de Valdivia, until the time of his trial in Lima. One of the charges levelled against him was that he, being married, openly lived with her &quot;...in the manner of man and wife&quot;. Suarez quickly took action and hired some of the best advisors in the Empire to help Valvidia fight off these charges. She convinced the Viceroy of Peru, Pedro de la Gasca, to use his powers as viceroy give to absolve Valvidia of any crimes in the Viceroyalty. In exchange for being freed, and his confirmation as Royal Governor, he was forced to relinquish her and to bring to Chile his wife, Marina Ortiz de Gaete, who only arrived after Valdivia&#x27;s death in 1554. He was also ordered to marry Suárez off.

Suárez was married in 1549 to Valdivia&#x27;s captain, Rodrigo de Quiroga, when she was 42 and the groom was 38. After her marriage, she led a very quiet life, dedicated to her home and to charity. Together with her husband, she contributed to the construction of the temple of La Merced and the hermitage of Monserrat, in Santiago. She was held in great esteem in Chile, as being a valiant woman and a great captain. While she knew that plazas and towns would be named after her, she personally lamented that people would never remember the hundreds of women involved in the founding of Chilean towns. Eventually, after the death of Valdivia, her husband twice became Royal Governor himself, in 1565 and 1575. They both died in Santiago de Chile, within months of each other, in 1580.

==Suárez&#x27;s legacy==
Suárez is seen as a symbol of a Chilean woman standing up to authority like Paula Jaraquemada and Javiera Carrera. She is still mentioned as a role model to contemporary protestors against mistreatment.

Suárez is the main character in several historical novels, such as &quot;Inés y las raíces de la tierra&quot;, (&quot;Inés and the roots of the land&quot;), by María Correa Morande (ZigZag, 1964), &quot;Ay Mamá Inés - Crónica Testimonial&quot; (&quot;Woe, Momma Inés - Testimonial Chronicle&quot;) (Andres Bello, 1993) by Jorge Guzmán, and &quot;Inés of My Soul&quot; () by Isabel Allende (HarperCollins, 2006). In her author&#x27;s note Allende wrote: &quot;This novel is a work of intuition, but any similarity to events and persons relating to the conquest of Chile is not coincidental&quot;.
Allende&#x27;s novel has been adapted as a Spanish-Chilean television series in 2020.
Elena Rivera (27-year-old during shooting) plays Suárez.

<text>HMS &quot;Odin&quot; (N84) was an O-class submarine of the Royal Navy. She was laid down by HM Dockyard at Chatham in Kent on 23 June 1927, launched on 5 May 1928 and commissioned on 21 December 1929. The name &quot;Odin&quot; refers to the 74-gun, Danish man-of-war surrendered to the British in 1807.

She served with the 5th Flotilla at Portsmouth in 1929–1930, with the 4th Flotilla at Hong Kong from 1930–1939, with the 8th Flotilla at Colombo in Ceylon in 1939–1940, and with the 1st Flotilla at Alexandria in Egypt in 1940. &quot;Odin&quot; was sent to Malta shortly before Italy declared war on 10 June.

&quot;Odin&quot; was depth charged and sunk in the Gulf of Taranto, most probably by the Italian destroyers and on 14 June 1940.

<text>HMS &quot;Odin&quot; was a British submarine operated by the Royal Navy.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Oberon&quot; class was a direct follow on of the &quot;Porpoise&quot;-class, with the same dimensions and external design, but updates to equipment and internal fittings, and a higher grade of steel used for fabrication of the pressure hull.

As designed for British service, the &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarines were in length between perpendiculars and in length overall, with a beam of , and a draught of . Displacement was 1,610 tons standard, 2,030 tons full load when surfaced, and 2,410 tons full load when submerged. Propulsion machinery consisted of 2 Admiralty Standard Range 16 VMS diesel generators, and two electric motors, each driving a , 3-bladed propeller at up to 400 rpm. Top speed was when submerged, and on the surface. Eight diameter torpedo tubes were fitted (six facing forward, two aft), with a total payload of 24 torpedoes. The boats were fitted with Type 186 and Type 187 sonars, and an I-band surface search radar. The standard complement was 68: 6 officers, 62 sailors.

&quot;Odin&quot; was laid down by Cammell Laird on 27 April 1959, and launched on 4 November 1960. The boat was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 3 May 1962.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Odin&quot; was decommissioned on 18 October 1990. She was sold for scrap in Greece in October 1991.

<text>Techirghiol (, historical name: &quot;Tekirgöl&quot;) is a town in Constanța County, Northern Dobruja, Romania.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from the Turkish &quot;Tekirgöl&quot; which means &quot;the lake of Tekir&quot;. 
According to a legend, a blind and crippled old man named Tekir and his old donkey reached the shore of the lake by mistake. Trying to pull his stubborn animal out of the mud, Tekir was miraculously healed so he could see and walk normally again.
Since then the lake has become famous for its healing properties.
Tekir and his donkey are featured in a statue located in the center of the town.

The name also means (in Turkish) &quot;Striped Lake&quot; (tekir - striped, and göl - lake). This is because of the salinity of the lake; when the wind blows, white salt stripes appear on the surface of the lake.

==Location==
Town is in the south east extremity of Romania (Constanța County), situated on the north west shore of Lake Techirghiol (11.6 km2), elevation 15–20 m, 18 km south of the municipality of Constanța and very close to the Black Sea (3 km).

==Techirghiol Balneotherapy Center==
The sapropelic mud from the Techirghiol Lake is the jewel of the resort. In 1924, at the Universal Exposition from Paris, the Techirghiol mud received the golden medal. Alphons Saligny was the first to study the therapeutic use of the mud; after this the Romanian Institute of Balneology approved it and during the 1930s the studies realized by Alphons Saligny and the Institute were the base for solid scientific proof regarding the therapeutic actions of the sapropelic mud of Techirghiol and the methodology of those treatments.

The sapropelic mud of Techirghiol is used warm for different kind of procedures:
*Wraps
*Cataplasm
*Water mixed, for baths in bathtubs

<text>Endenich is a neighborhood in the western part of Bonn, Germany. Before 1904 it was an independent municipality. The village of Endenich was founded in the 8th century, and was first mentioned in 804 as &quot;Antiniche&quot;. Today, about 12,000 people live in Endenich.

== Sights ==
The composer and pianist Robert Schumann lived the last two years of his life in the mental clinic &quot;Richarz&#x27;sche Heilanstalt&quot; on Magdalenenstraße (on today&#x27;s Sebastianstraße), where he died on July 29, 1856. The former clinic now houses the Schumannhaus Bonn, a music library and museum.

In the northern part is the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy which was opened in 1972.

The improvisational theatre Springmaus, founded by Bill Mockridge, is located in Endenich. Well-known comedians such as Bernhard Hoëcker, Dirk Bach and Bastian Pastewka have performed at this theatre.
Endenich is one of the most cultural districts of Bonn. There are many good restaurants, a very charming retro cinema, pubs and an event location with concerts and shows nearly every night.

<text>Samuel Booker Roberts Jr. (12 May 1921 – 27 September 1942) was a U.S. Navy coxswain who was killed in the Battle of Guadalcanal, and became the namesake of three U.S. Navy warships.

Roberts was born in San Francisco, California, on 12 May 1921. He enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve in 1939 and was called to active duty in 1940. Roberts served aboard the USS &quot;California&quot; (BB-44) and the transport USS &quot;Heywood&quot; (AP-12), before being transferred to the cargo transport USS &quot;Bellatrix&quot; (AK-20, later AKA-20).

In 1942, &quot;Bellatrix&quot; was assigned to Task Group Four and became part of the Guadalcanal Assault Force. As a coxswain for the &quot;Bellatrix&quot;&#x27;s assault boats, Roberts helped ferry supplies from the transport ships to a tenuous beachhead.

After the ships withdrew in the face of Japanese attacks that began 7 August 1942, Roberts volunteered for duty on the island of Guadalcanal, where he was attached to a beachmaster unit at Lunga Point. The unit, which included Navy and United States Coast Guard sailors, transported Marines and their supplies to beaches along the island&#x27;s northern coast, and also evacuated wounded Marines.

Early on the morning of 27 September 1942, Roberts volunteered for a rescue mission to save a company-size unit of Marines that had been surrounded by a larger Japanese force. The rescue group of several Higgins boats was taken under heavy fire and was perilously close to failure. Roberts volunteered to distract Japanese forces by guiding his boat directly in front of their lines, drawing their fire. This decoy act was performed effectively until all Marines had been evacuated. However, as he was about to withdraw from the range of the Japanese guns, Roberts’ boat was hit and he was mortally wounded. His boatmates brought him back to base and he was flown out on a medical evacuation flight, but died the next day.

Roberts was awarded the Navy Cross for his valor in the face of enemy fire.

==Warships named for Roberts==
*, a , commissioned in April 1944 and sunk on 25 October in the Battle off Samar. Roberts&#x27; younger brother, Jack, served aboard DE-413 and was the &quot;voice&quot; of the &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; on the ship&#x27;s intercom. He survived the ship&#x27;s sinking at Samar.
*, a , commissioned in 1946 and struck in 1970.
*, an guided missile frigate, commissioned in 1986 and decommissioned in 2015. She survived an explosion from an Iranian mine in the Persian Gulf in 1988. The blast also broke the keel of the ship; such structural damage is almost always fatal to most vessels. The crew fought fire and flooding for five hours and saved the ship.

==Other honors==
In 2009, the U.S. Navy named a damage control trainer at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii after FFG-58. It trains sailors to fight shipboard flooding of the sort the frigate faced after striking a mine in 1988.

<doc id="1282316" wikidata="Q1988184" url="?curid=1282316" title="Reformatory Political Federation">
<text>The Reformatory Political Federation (; RPF) was a minor Protestant Christian political party in the Netherlands.

==History==

The RPF was founded on 15 March 1975 by three groups of orthodox Christians. The first group were members of the Protestant Anti-Revolutionary Party, secondly the National Evangelical Union, a small party which had earlier left the ARP, and several independent electoral committees. The founders opposed the formation of the Christian Democratic Appeal, because the Protestant ARP and Christian Historical Union would join the Catholic People&#x27;s Party. During the period of pillarisation, the Catholics and Protestants had lived in a form of cold war.

The RPF sought to unite all other orthodox Protestant Christian parties, namely the Reformed Political League (GPV) and the Reformed Political Party (SGP).

In the subsequent 1977 general election, the RPF was unable to win any seats. In 1981, it won two seats in House of Representatives (Meindert Leerling and Aad Wagenaar). In the period between 1981 and 2002, it had one to three members. It also won seats in the Senate. The party remained in opposition throughout its existence.

In 1985, one of its two members of parliament seceded from the party to form the Anti-Revolutionaries 1985, the party never got any seat.

In 1996, RPF party leader Leen van Dijke came under public criticism when the magazine &quot;Nieuwe Revu&quot; had suggested that in an interview he had declared: &quot;Why would stealing, for example committing social welfare fraud, be less of a sin than going against the seventh commandment? Yes, why should someone in a homosexual relationship be better than a thief?&quot; When turmoil broke out, Van Dijke explained that he had meant to convey a universally accepted vision within Christianity that trespassing one of God&#x27;s commandments makes a man guilty before God, and that all breaches herein are equal. But the general public, and especially the Dutch gay movement, criticised the statement as printed in &quot;Nieuwe Revu&quot; heavily, considering it discrimination. As such, the magazine &quot;Gay Krant&quot; reported it to the Attorney General. In 1999 the Dutch high court ruled that Van Dijke&#x27;s views were not discriminatory according to Dutch law. In 2001 he was cleared by the Supreme Court of the Netherlands.

From 1998, the RPF and GPV began to work closely together in parliament. In 2000, the Christian Union, in which both would unite was officially founded. In 2002, it first contested in elections and won five seats.

==Linked organisations==
The party magazine was called &quot;RPF signal&quot; and the scientific foundation &quot;Marnix van St. Aldegonde Stichting&quot;. The Evangelische Omroep broadcasting association had strong personal and ideological links with the RPF, but it was never officially linked to the party.

==Ideology==
The RPF believed that society should be based on Biblical norms and values. The political differences between the GPV and SGP, the two other orthodox Protestant parties, were marginal and based on theological differences.

The RPF was a staunch defender of the Dutch monarchy and a strong government. It opposed abortion, euthanasia and same-sex marriage. In economic and environmental issues, the RPF was in favour of strong government influence.

Internationally, the party was comparable to the American Christian right and the small Protestant parties of Scandinavia, such as the Norwegian Christian Democratic Party, the Swedish and Danish Christian Democrats. As a testimonial party, the RPF never took part in a government coalition, instead it chose to voice its concerns over government policies, while acknowledging that the party itself was not big enough to force its opinion upon others.

== Election results ==
=== House of Representatives ===
=== Senate ===
==Electorate==

The RPF was supported by orthodox Reformed of many denominations, such as the Reformed Churches and the Dutch Reformed Church. Furtherm members of newer churches (such as the Evangelical Church and the Pentecostal community) supported this party. The electorate was concentrated in Zeeland, the Veluwe, parts of Overijssel, forming what is known as the Bible Belt.

<doc id="1282323" wikidata="Q3433742" url="?curid=1282323" title="Medina River">
<text>The Medina River is located in south central Texas, United States, in the Medina Valley. It was also known as the Rio Mariano, Rio San Jose, or Rio de Bagres (Catfish river). Its source is in springs in the Edwards Plateau in northwest Bandera County, Texas, and it merges with the San Antonio River in southern Bexar County, Texas, for a course of 120 miles. It contains the Medina Dam in NE Medina County, Texas which restrains Lake Medina. Much of its course is owned and operated by the Bexar-Medina-Atascosa Water District to provide irrigation services to farmers and ranchers.

==History==
The Medina River was named after Pedro de Medina, a Spanish cartographer, by Alonso de León, Spanish governor of Coahuila, New Spain in 1689. It once served as the official boundary between Texas and Coahuila with the San Antonio River being considered its tributary. At that time, the river was called the Medina all the way to the Gulf of Mexico, but now the part below the confluence is called the San Antonio River.

From 1849, Castroville on the river was a water stop on the San Antonio-El Paso Road and a stagecoach station on the San Antonio-El Paso Mail and San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line.

==Natural features==
Much of the source water to the Medina River is produced by springs emerging due to the presence of the Balcones Fault. This locale of the Balcones Fault is associated with an important ecological dividing line for species occurrence. For example, species such as the California Fan Palm, &quot;Washingtonia filifera&quot;, occur only west of the Medina River or Balcones Fault.

The Medina River once received significant waste discharge from upstream catfish farming operations, which utilized more water than was sustainable to the basin&#x27;s safe usage.

<doc id="1282331" wikidata="Q2737457" url="?curid=1282331" title="International adoption">
<text>International adoption (also referred to as intercountry adoption or transnational adoption) is a type of adoption in which an individual or couple residing in one country becomes the legal and permanent parent(s) of a child who is a national of another country. In general, prospective adoptive parents must meet the legal adoption requirements of their country of residence and those of the country whose nationality the child holds.

International adoption is not the same thing as transcultural or interracial adoption. However, a family will often become a transcultural or interracial family upon the adoption of a child internationally.

The laws of countries vary in their willingness to allow international adoptions. Some countries have established rules and procedures for international adoptions, while other countries expressly forbid it. Various countries, notably many African nations, have extended residency requirements for adoptive parents that, in effect, rule out most international adoptions.

==Process overview==
The requirements necessary to begin the process of international adoption can vary depending on the country of the adoptive parent(s). For example, while most countries require prospective adoptive parents to first get approval to adopt, in some the approval can only be given afterwards. Often, an &quot;orphan&quot; is a child whose living birth family has consented to an adoption. Some describe orphanages as &quot;nurseries&quot; or &quot;children&#x27;s homes&quot; because in numerous instances children&#x27;s parents have not consented to the adoption of their children. It is not uncommon for a parent to put a child in a &quot;nursery&quot; temporarily while they deal with poverty or work, or want to take advantage of the educational opportunities in the orphanage/nursery. Because orphanages/nurseries often provide education, they function more like subsidized boarding school.

Prospective parents of international adoptees wait to get a referral for a child, which often means waiting until one of these parents of the children in nurseries/orphanages consents to the adoption. Although bureaucracy is often blamed for the slow process of adopting a child, often what is to blame is that the demand for children in the less-developed world exceeds the supply. A senior advisor on child protection with UNICEF, Alexandria Yuster, argues that international adoption is now more about finding children for first world (developed world) parents than finding homes for children. Susan Bissell, also of UNICEF, said that she does not oppose international adoption, but believes that it is preferable for abandoned children to be taken back by their previous families and advises governments to provide small monetary incentives to families who are willing to do so.

In the United States, typically the first stage of the process is selecting a licensed adoption agency or attorney to work with. Each agency or attorney tends to work with a different set of countries, although some only focus on a single country. Pursuant to the rules of the Hague Adoption Convention (an international treaty related to adoption issues) the adoption agency or attorney must be accredited by the U.S. government if the child&#x27;s country is also a participant in the Hague Convention. If the child&#x27;s country is not a participant then the rules of the Hague do not apply, and the specific laws of the child&#x27;s and adoptive parent(s)&#x27; countries must be followed. Even when the Hague does not apply, a home study and USCIS (United States Citizen and Immigration Services; formerly INS, Immigration and Naturalization Service) approval are requirements. The Hague is discussed below.

A dossier is prepared that contains a large amount of information about the prospective adoptive parents required by the child&#x27;s country. Typically this includes financial information, a background check, fingerprints, a home study review by a social worker, report from the adoptive parents&#x27; doctor regarding their health, and other supporting information. Again, requirements will vary widely from country to country, and even region to region in large countries such as Russia. Once complete, the dossier is submitted to the appropriate authorities in the child&#x27;s country for review.

After the dossier is reviewed and the prospective parents are approved to adopt, they are matched to an eligible child (except in some countries such as India, which does not allow &quot;matching&quot; of a child to (a) prospective parent(s)). The parent is usually sent information about the child, such as age, gender, health history, etc. This is generally called a referral. A travel date is typically provided at a later time in most adoptions. However, some countries might also provide a travel date at the time of referral, informing the parents when they may travel to meet the child and sign any additional paperwork required to accept the referral. Some countries, such as Kazakhstan, do not allow referrals until the prospective parent travels to the country on their first trip. This is called a &quot;blind&quot; referral.

Depending on the country, the parents may have to make more than one trip overseas to complete the legal process. Some countries allow a child to be escorted to the adoptive parents&#x27; home country and the adoptive parents are not required to travel to the country of their adopted child.

There are usually several requirements after this point, such as paperwork to make the child a legal citizen of the adopting parents&#x27; country or re-adopt them. In addition, one or more follow up (or &quot;post placement&quot;) visits from a social worker may be required—either by the placing agency used by the adoptive parents or by the laws of the country from which the child was adopted. In the United States, citizenship is automatically granted to all foreign-born children when at least one adoptive parent is a U.S. citizen, in accordance with the Child Citizenship Act of 2000. Depending on the circumstances of the adoption, the grant of citizenship takes place upon the child&#x27;s admission to the U.S. as an immigrant or the child&#x27;s adoption in the parent&#x27;s home jurisdiction.

===Policies and requirements===
Adoption policies for each country vary widely. Information such as the age of the adoptive parents, financial status, educational level, marital status and history, number of dependent children in the house, sexual orientation, weight, psychological health, and ancestry are used by countries to determine what parents are eligible to adopt from that country.

Information such as the age of the child, fees and expenses, and the amount of travel time required in the child&#x27;s birth country can also vary widely from one country to another.

Each country sets its own rules, timelines and requirements surrounding adoption, and there are also rules that vary within the United States for each state. Each country, and often each part of the country, sets its own rules about what will be shared and how it will be shared (e.g., a picture of the child, child&#x27;s health). Reliability and verifiability of the information is variable.

Most countries require that a parent travel to bring the child home; however, some countries allow the child to be escorted to his or her new homeland.

The U.S. Department of State has designated two accrediting entities for organizations providing inter-country adoption services in the United States and work with sending countries that have ratified the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. They are the Council on Accreditation and the Colorado Department of Health and Human Services. The U.S. Department of State maintains a list of all accredited international adoption providers.

==Major origin and receiving countries of children ==

Basic demographic data on origin and receiving countries since the 2000s have only recently been analyzed and summarized in a specialized publication.

===Major origin countries of children ===

According to one recent study, 6 countries (China, Ethiopia, India, South Korea, Ukraine and Vietnam) were major origin countries for almost a decade in the period 2003–2011. Yet there has been slight change in other countries sending most children.

In 2019, the top sending countries for children adopted by US citizens were China, Ukraine, Colombia, India, South Korea, Bulgaria, Haiti, Nigeria.

===Major receiving countries===
Based on Selman&#x27;s research, during the year of 1998 and 2007, the top 10 receiving countries of all 23 reported countries, (ranked from the large to small), are the United States, Spain, France, Italy, Canada, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Australia. Among these 10 countries, the top 5 accounts for more than 80% of overall adoption, and the US is responsible for around 50% of all cases. Although historically the United States has been among the leaders in adopting children via international adoption, this has changed dramatically over the last decade. In 2004, 22,884 children were adopted internationally, while only 2,971 were adopted in 2019. This is attributed to a combination of factors: increased bureaucracy due to implementation of the Hague Convention guidelines, legal changes in the countries from which the adoptions occur eliminating countries from which to adopt, increased cost, corruption in some foreign courts/orphanages, and the policy of many countries to only free children with significant special needs.

====The US (as the largest receiving country)====

In 2019, the top sending countries for children adopted by US citizens were China (819), Ukraine (298), Colombia (244), India (241), South Korea (166), Bulgaria (134), Haiti (130), and Nigeria (116).

These statistics can vary from year to year as each country alters its rules; adoption from Ethiopia used to be common, but international adoption was banned in 2018 by Ethiopia. There were only 11 adoptions from Ethiopia in 2019, compared with 177 in 2018 and a high of 313 in 2017, when Ethiopia was No. 2 on the list. Romania, Belarus, Russia and Cambodia were also important until government crackdowns on adoptions to weed out abuse in the system cut off the flow. Abuses with regard to adoption in some Eastern European countries in the 1990s led to bans on international adoptions in those countries in the 21st century. China has long been a major sending country in international adoption, but recently the numbers have fallen (although it still remains a leader), due to an improved Chinese economy and more restrictive laws. Concerns about abuses with regard to international adoption have been raised for years with regard to China.

=====Sex ratio of children adopted (US and Europe) =====

Generally, the US adopts more girls than boys. From 1999 to 2012, around 62% of adoptees by US families were girls, and only 38% were boys. Yet this discrepancy between female and male adoptees has gradually declined. In other words, now the sex ratio of girls and boys adopted is more balanced.

It used to be true that China had more girls available for adoption, due to the Chinese culture&#x27;s preference for sons in combination with the official planned birth policy implemented in 1979. Until the early 2000s, around 90–95% of Chinese children adopted by American families were girls. For numerous reasons, including a recent amendment of the one child policy, the dwindling number of available females for marriage, and an increased prevalence of sex selective abortions, most orphanages in China now house only children with special needs, the majority of which are male. Because of the heavy preference for females in adopting families most waiting children in China are boys, as girls with the same needs are quickly matched with a long line of families seeking Chinese daughters. Although India also has a noticeable excess of girls available for adoption (around 70%), In contrast, South Korea, another East Asian country, has a relatively large excess of boys being adopted; about 60% are boys.

=====Countries suspending or reducing adoption by US families=====
There have been several countries (including certain major sending countries) that are completely not or only partially accepting inter-country adoption requests from US families for certain reasons. 
:* Russia: In December 2012, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law a measure, effective January 1, 2013, banning the adoption of Russian children by US families. The ban was seen as diplomatic retaliation for the passage of the Magnitsky Act in the US, while popular support in Russia focused on incidents of abuse to adoptees by US parents. In January 2013 about 20,000 people marched against the law in Moscow.
:* Ethiopia: In February 2018, the Ethiopian Parliament amended the country&#x27;s adoption laws and removed reference to adoption of its citizens by foreigners. The new law became effective on February 18, 2018.
:* China: On 5 September 2024, the Chinese government terminated the international adoption program with immediate effect.

The US also suspended adoption relationship with selected countries, due to Hague Convention or other rationales. 
:* Vietnam, temporarily suspended due to allegations of corruption and baby-selling
:* Guatemala, the adoption was shut down in 2007 for adoption after allegations of corruption, families being coerced and children kidnapped to feed U.S. demand. (See also: Adoption in Guatemala)
:* Nepal: Although Nepal has not closed its doors for adoption, the United States government has suspended adoptions from Nepal. Documents that were presented documenting the abandonment of these children in Nepal have been found to be unreliable and circumstances of alleged abandonment cannot be verified because of obstacles in the investigation of individual cases.

==International legal framework==

At the international level, the main legal instrument on intercountry adoption is the Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (hereafter the Hague Adoption Convention, 1993). However other relevant international legal instruments exist to ensure that the best interest of the child and the concern for their welfare inform the practices of intercountry adoption. For example, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) contains some specific references to intercountry adoption. The Declaration on Social and Legal Principles relating to the Protection and Welfare of Children, with Special Reference to Foster Placement and Adoption Nationally and Internationally (1986) calls Member States to establish policy, legislation and effective supervision for the protection of children involved in intercountry adoption.

All those instruments have some common principles:

::* The principle of subsidiarity according to which intercountry adoption should only take place when suitable adoptive parents cannot be identified in the country of origin of the child
::* The best interest of the child should be the paramount consideration
::* The placement of the child should be made through competent authorities or agencies with the same safeguards and standards as domestic adoptions
::* In no case should an adoption result in improper financial gains for those involved.
According to the Convention of the Rights of the Child (art. 21), as well as to the UN Declaration on the Protection and Welfare of Children (art. 17) and the Hague Adoption Convention (Preamble and art. 4), international adoption should be considered as an option if other arrangements (with priority to kin and adoptive families) cannot satisfactorily be arranged for the child in their country of origin (principle of subsidiarity between national and international adoption). However the international community still disagrees on the point whether the option of being placed in a permanent family setting through international adoption should prevail on the alternative of the placement of children in domestic care institutions. 
The United Nations Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography (2000) is an additional international instrument that calls on States parties to ensure that coercive adoption is criminalized under national law, regardless of whether the offence is committed domestically or transnationally, on an individual or organized basis.

===UN Declaration Relating to the Welfare of Children (1986)===
The UN Declaration on Social and Legal Principles relating to the Protection and Welfare of Children, with Special Reference to Foster Placement and Adoption Nationally and Internationally was adopted by General Assembly resolution 41/85 of 3 December 1986.
The UN Declaration Relating to the Welfare of Children reaffirms principle 6 of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, according to which, &quot;The child shall, wherever possible, grow up in the care and under the responsibility of his parents and, in any case, in an atmosphere of affection and of moral and material security.&quot;
Article 17 affirms the principle of subsidiarity in these terms: &quot;If a child cannot be placed in a foster or an adoptive family or cannot in any suitable manner be cared for in the country of origin, intercountry adoption may be considered as an alternative means of providing the child with a family.&quot; Article 24 requires Member States to consider the child&#x27;s cultural and religious background and interest. The Declaration encourages States not to hurry the adoptive process. Article 15 states, &quot;Sufficient time and adequate counselling should be given to the child&#x27;s own parents, the prospective adoptive parents and, as appropriate, the child in order to reach a decision on the child&#x27;s future.&quot;

===UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989)===
The United Nations Convention on the Right of the Child marks a turning point in the international law of children&#x27;s rights recognizing the child as an active subject of international law whose views must be taken into consideration when dealing with matters affecting them (art.12). The principle of the best interests of the child should be a primary consideration in all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies (art, 3). This same principle shall be the paramount consideration also when States Parties recognize and/or permit the system of adoption. Particularly, article 21 requires that States Parties &quot;ensure that the adoption of a child is authorized only by competent authorities who determine that the adoption is permissible in view of the child&#x27;s status concerning parents, relatives and legal guardians and that, if required, the persons concerned have given their informed consent to the adoption. The placement of the child also should not result in improper financial gain for those involved in it (art. 21.d).

===The Hague Adoption Convention (1993)===
Recognizing some of the difficulties and challenges associated with international adoption, and to protect those involved from the corruption, abuses, and exploitation that sometimes accompanies it, in 1993 the Hague Conference on Private International Law developed the Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. The Convention came into force in May 1995.

As of December 2018, there were 99 states parties to the convention. Korea, Nepal and the Russian Federation are signatories but have not ratified.

With respect to the previous multilateral instruments, which include some provisions regarding intercountry adoption, the Hague Adoption Convention is the major multilateral instrument regulating international adoption. It calls for coordination and direct cooperation between countries to ensure that appropriate safeguards promote the best interest of the child (Article 1) and prevent the abduction, sale, or trafficking of children.

The convention also requires that all processes should be authorized by central adoption authorities designated by the contracting states. (Chapter III of the Convention outlines the roles and responsibilities of this authority.) If fully implemented at the national level, the convention offers also a protective framework against the risks potentially implied in private adoption (when the adoptive parents set the terms of the adoption directly with the birth parents or with children&#x27;s institutions placed in the country of origin, without recurring to accredited adoption service providers).

The Convention lets states decide which public agency is the central adoption authority (whose supervision and authorization is necessary to proceed with adoption (article 17 ) and which other bodies should be accredited as the provider of adoption services (Article 9). If fully implemented at the national level, the convention offers also a protective framework against the risks potentially implied in private adoption (when the adoptive parents set the terms of the adoption directly with the birth parents, without recurring to accredited bodies).

&quot;The Implementation and Operation of the 1993 Inter country Adoption Convention****: Guide to Good Practice&quot; provides a guidance for the Convention operation, use and interpretation. The convention is crucial because it provides formal international and intergovernmental recognition of intercountry adoption, working to ensure that adoptions under the convention are recognized in other party countries.

To comply with international standards, many changes have been introduced in national legislation enacting laws to criminalize the act of obtaining improper gains from intercountry adoptions. However instances of trafficking in and sale of children for the purpose of adoption continue to take place in many parts of the world. Especially during emergency situations, natural disasters or conflicts, has been found that children are adopted without following appropriate legal procedures and risk to be victims of trafficking and sale. 
It has been raised also the issue that an excessive bureaucratization of the adoption process – following the implementation of the Hague Adoption Convention – possibly establishes additional barriers to the placement of children.

==Regional and domestic legal orders==

===Africa===

Much interest is shown for cases of international adoption in Africa especially after highly publicized stories of adoption of African children by celebrities like Madonna and Angelina Jolie. Legal frameworks on adoption in general and on international adoption in particular are available across Africa and may vary from one country to another. The following overview of legal provisions put into place by African countries reflects a diverse but not a comprehensive view on how the question of international adoption is dealt with on the African continent. The focus is on countries for which bibliographical resources were immediately accessible.

====The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) ====

On September 25, 2013, the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo enacted a suspension of exit permits for Congolese adoptive children that prevents adoptive children from being allowed to depart the country with their adoptive parents. Although Congolese courts continue to issue new adoption decrees, these are not currently recognized by the Congolese immigration service, the &quot;Direction Generale de Migration&quot; (DGM), which controls the points of entry. Congolese officials have said the suspension will remain in place until the parliament enacts new legislation reforming the adoption process. Because of the suspension, the U.S. Department of State announced on October 6, 2014, that it strongly recommends against adopting from the DRC at this time.

According to the DRC Family Code, an adopted child holds the same rights as a biological child in the adopting family. Links with original family are preserved. This regime is applied to simple adoption.
As far as international adoption is concerned, the DRC Law does not provide a definition specifically; but the judicial practice authorizes the adoption of Congolese children by foreign parents.
Fundamental principles for any child adoption are defined by Law No. 09/001 from 10 January 2009 relating child protection, as follow:
* All children are entitled to adoption
* The adoption of a child by a foreigner can only happen when competent authorities from the origin state:
# Have verified, after having examined the social conditions in the origin state that the adoption is to be done in the best interest of the child.
# Have made sure that:
## The consent for adoption is not given in exchange with payment or any kind of compensation and that this consent was not later retrieved.
## The Child&#x27;s wishes and opinions have been taken into account in accordance with their age and level of maturity
## The consent expressed by the child for their adoption, when it is required, is freely expressed in ways required by the law, and that this consent is given or recorded in a written form
As for conditions to be met in the host state for a valid international adoption, article 19 of the Child Protection Code explains that the host state should certify that:
* The future parents are qualified and are capable of adopting children
* The adopted child is authorized to enter and reside permanently in the host country
However, even though international adoption is allowed under fulfillment of the above-mentioned conditions, article 20 of the DRC Child Protection Code denies the right to adoption to homosexuals, pedophiles and mentally-ill people.

====Ethiopia====
In 2018, Ethiopia banned the adoption of children by foreigners.

This followed the conviction of U.S. parents, Carri and Larry Williams, who were found guilty of manslaughter after their thirteen-year old Ethiopian adopted daughter, Hana Williams, died of hypothermia in 2011. The Ethiopian Government&#x27;s official news outlet, ENA, claims that the state banned international adoptions due to concerns over child abuse and neglect overseas. There were instances of children who were relinquished by their parents and listed as orphans on adoption registries, which led to the avoidance of undesirable court procedures. Some critics of international adoption cite the reason for unethical adoption processes as being the high demand that countries faced from adoptive parents.

From an Ethiopian standpoint, some citizens felt that international adoption was becoming &quot;the new export industry&quot; of their country at the time of its peak around 2008.

In 2016, Denmark officially ended international adoption with Ethiopia over concerns surrounding the ethics of the adoption process, as well as the health and safety of the children involved.

According to the U.S. State Department, Ethiopia is not a signatory to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (Hague Abduction Convention). The Hague Abduction Convention attempts to negate the harmful side effects that can result in countries participating in international adoption. The convention &quot;focuses on the child,&quot; rather than the adoptive parents or biological parents. Additionally, the U.S. and Ethiopia have never had any kind of agreement that would outlaw child abduction, in special relation to international adoption. Prior to Ethiopia ceasing its international adoption process, the U.S. attempted to work with Ethiopia to improve the adoption process.

In 2007, Ethiopia ranked 5th among countries for international adoption by Americans. This was a large increase from their 16th-place ranking in 2000. International adoptions rose after Angelina Jolie&#x27;s adoption of her daughter Zahara Marley Jolie that took place in 2005. The U.S. embassy to Ethiopia reported that adoption numbers in the country had risen so much that extra staff had to be hired to handle to workload. Average waiting time for adoptive parents averaged about five weeks, accompanied by low cost and simple, easy procedures. The high interest found among Americans and Europeans, as well as the cheap and easy adoption process, made the U.S. embassy concerned about adoption fraud. As American laws regarding the practices involved with international adoptions strengthened, adoptions from Ethiopia decreased. Eventually, Ethiopian adoption agencies in the capital of the country, Addis Ababa, began shutting down and going out of business.

===Asia===
According to research from 2013, certain Asian countries have been top origins of intercountry adoption, namely China, India, The Republic of Korea (South Korea), Vietnam, etc. Yet Asian countries have different legal framework towards intercountry adoption.

==== China ====

China has been party to the Hague Adoption Convention since 1 January 2006. All adoptions in China from another country must meet these requirements as well as Chinese domestic law.

On the international level, China also has bilateral agreements with certain countries, including Australia (The Family Law (Bilateral Agreements – Intercountry Adoption) Regulations 1998) etc.

Domestically, China has two major legislations directly responsible for international adoption affairs.

*Adoption Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (Revised), which deals with general adoption issue. Its Article 21 is specifically linked to international adoption. 
*Measures for Registration of Adoption of Children by Foreigners in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, solely addressing international adoption issues.

Other pertinent documents include
*Article 26 in Marriage Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, also defines adoption in China in a general manner. 
*Measures of China Center of Adoption Affairs for Authorizing Foreign Adoption Organizations to Seek Adoptive Families for Children of Special Needs

Legally, the China Centre for Children&#x27;s Welfare and Adoptions (CCCWA) (which is different from the China Center of Adoption Affairs (CCAA) is the only agency authorized by the Chinese government to regulate and process all inter-country adoptions from China. And China requires all inter-country adoption be handled through government approval instead of any individual application.

====Taiwan====
Having been one of the major sources of adoptive children, yet Taiwan is not party to the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (Hague Adoption Convention).

Domestically, Taiwan has enforced The Protection of Children and Youths Welfare and Rights Act since May 30, 2012. And according to the Act, all the adoption cases in Taiwan shall consider the national adopter as priority. Besides, all the international adoption cases shall be matched via the legal adoption matching services agency. Except almost the same peer within six degrees of kinship of relatives and five degrees of kinship of relatives by marriage, or one of the couple adopts the other party&#x27;s children. Taiwan organizations that provide international adoption service work with foreign agency or governmental authority instead of individuals.

====The Republic of Korea (South Korea)====

The Republic of Korea (South Korea) is not party to Hague Adoption Convention. South Korea&#x27;s law requires the use of an adoption agency for the overseas adoption of all Korean orphans, and requires that such agencies are authorized by The Ministry for Health, Welfare and Family Affairs.

On May 24, 2013, it signed the Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (the convention). This is the first step for South Korea in becoming a Convention partner. Adoptions between the United States and South Korea, however, are not yet subject to the requirements of the convention and relevant implementing laws and regulations. According to the Ministry of Health and Welfare, which will be designated as South Korea&#x27;s Central Authority, there is no set date when South Korea will deliver its instrument of ratification or when the convention will enter into force with respect to South Korea.

Domestically, the Republic of Korea (ROK) Special Adoption Act, which governs intercountry adoptions from South Korea, went into effect on August 5, 2012. This law prioritizes domestic adoptions and endeavors to reduce the number of South Korean children adopted abroad. Under the Special Adoption Act, each intercountry adoption requires the approval of the ROK Family Court.

====India====
India is party to the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (Hague Adoption Convention).

In January 2011, India implemented new procedures to provide more centralized processing of intercountry adoptions. In addition to the new guidelines, prospective adoptive parents should be aware of all Indian laws that apply to intercountry adoption. A child can be legally placed with the prospective adoptive parents under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act of 1956 (HAMA), the Guardians and Wards Act of 1890 (GAWA), or the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act of 2000 (JJA).

====Vietnam====
Vietnam is a party to the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (Hague Adoption Convention).

Domestically, Vietnam Government has promulgated the Law on Adoption and it took effect from January 1, 2011. It contains 53 Articles, and addresses both domestic and intercountry adoption. Article 14 of the Vietnamese law outlines the requirements for adopters, which is also applicable to foreign adoptive parents.

===Europe===

Since the 1970s, European countries such as Spain, France, Italy, and several Scandinavian countries have experienced a considerable increase in the demand for adopted children from non-European countries as a result of a scarce numbers of national children available for adoptions. Gender studies have also suggested that this is the result of the modern trend in the Global North of delaying conception of the first child, which increases the risk of reduced fertility and the demand for adoption. 
However, recent data show a stabilization or even a decrease in the inter-country adoptions. From one side it has been argued that this is the result of a decrease in the causes of abandonment, implementation of social policies in favour of families, less stigmatization of unmarried mothers, economic development and an increase in the national adoptions in the main source countries. From the other side it has been considered also the result of new regulations and policies adopted by some countries of origin (e.g. Romania) aiming at regulating the outflow of children and preventing child trafficking. The trend however differs from country to country. Between 2000 and 2005, for example Spain, France and Italy have experienced an increase in international adoptions of 70%, while in Switzerland and in Germany they have decreased and in Norway have remained stable.

====Council of Europe====

The enactment and enforcement of international standards and laws regulating adoption depends on how the competent authorities in each contracting state interpret international instruments and implement their provisions. European regulation and practices on the matter vary from country to country. An attempt to harmonize adoption laws among Member States of the Council of Europe was made with the European Convention on the Adoption of Children (1967), which entered into force in April 1968. In 2008 a revised version of the European Convention on the Adoption of Children was prepared by a Working Party of the Committee of Experts on Family Law under the authority of the European Committee on Legal Cooperation within the framework of the Council of Europe. The convention was opened for signature on 27 November 2008.
As of November 2013, the 1967 Convention has been ratified by 18 of the 46 Member States of the Council of Europe, while 3 Member States are signatories but have not yet ratified. As for the revised Convention, 16 countries have ratified, while another 3 have only signed.
The European Convention establishes common principles that should govern adoption. The Convention establishes procedures affecting adoption and its legal consequences to reduce the difficulties in promoting the welfare of the adopted children caused by the differences in legislation and practices among the European States.
Among its essential provisions, the Convention stipulates that the adoption must be granted by a competent judicial or administrative authority (art. 4), that birth parents must freely consent to the adoption (art.5) and that the adoption must be in the best interest of the child (art.8). Any improper financial advantages arising from the adoption of a child are prohibited (art.15).

====European Union====

Within the European Union regulation, reference to intercountry adoption is made in article 4 of the Council Directive 2003/86/EC of 22 September 2003 on the right to family reunification. The article regulates the immigration of adoptive third-country-national children provided that the parents are established third country nationals within the European Union. EU Member States authorized the entry and residence of children adopted in accordance with a decision taken by the competent authority of the Member State concerned. Entry can also be authorized by a decision that is automatically enforceable due to international obligations of the Member State or must be recognized in accordance with international obligations (art. 4 (b)).
With the ratification and adoption of the Hague Adoption Convention, European countries have developed training for social workers in charge of providing international adoption-related services. They have appointed competent specialists and created a centralized system of control (e.g. Italy and Germany). In Switzerland, on the other hand, the bureaucratization of the procedures has been considered to have slowed down the process resulting in a decrease of the number of children adopted. 
Traditionally in Spain, France and Switzerland, the adopting parents can choose between two paths to carry out international adoption: referring to the intermediation of an accredited body – most of the time a private organization – and with the supervision of the central adoption authority designated by the state, or opting for a private adoption without the referral to the intermediary. In Italy and Norway the second option, considered as &quot;private adoption&quot;, is forbidden. In Italy for example all international adoptions must be arranged by competent bodies accredited by national law. The only exception is granted to prospective adoptive couples where one spouse is a native of the country the child comes from, or for Italian families who have lived for a long time in the country and have a significant relation with its culture. In these two cases their demand for international adoption can be sent to the International Social Service, an international not-for-profit organization active in more than 100 countries through a network of branches, affiliated bureaus, and correspondents, without recurring to the accredited national bodies. 
France and Germany recently adopted a third path, creating public bodies that simultaneously exercise a formal intermediary role and in practice perform the functions of a central adoption authority. Data show that in all European countries, both those that legally prohibit and allow for it, the practice of private adoption is widespread and has raised concerns most of all in relation to the risk of child trafficking.
Many European countries have signed bilateral agreement with countries of origin of the adopted children (e.g. Spain with Philippines and Bolivia, France with Vietnam). Legally speaking, bilateral agreements cannot disregard the guarantees provided by the Convention of the Rights of the Child and by the Hague Adoption Convention.

===North America===

====United States====
The United States (US) is bound both by domestic and international laws regarding adoptions of children. The laws cover US families adopting children from abroad, and families abroad adopting US-born children. Many US children are adopted abroad. However, foreign adoptions by American families have dropped in recent years: families in the US adopted 2,971 children from abroad in 2019, compared with a high of 22,884 in 2004.

There are several international treaties and conventions regulating the intercountry adoption of children. When possible, the US prefers to enter into multilateral agreements over bilateral ones, because of the difficulty in getting the Senate to ratify international agreements.
* Inter-American Convention on Conflict of Laws Concerning the Adoption of Minors, 1984 (US not signed or ratified)
*US bilateral agreement with Viet Nam on 1 Sept 2005
*United Nations General Assembly Declaration on Social and Legal Principles Relating to Adoption and Foster Placement of Children Nationally and Internationally (adopted without vote)
*Hague Adoption Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-Country Adoption (Hague Adoption Convention). The US has acceded to (signed) but the Senate has not ratified the Hague Convention. The US also made a declaration that this convention does not supersede Title 18, United States Code, Section 3190 relating to documents submitted to the United States Government in support of extradition requests.
*United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The US signed (16 Feb 1995) but the Senate has not ratified because of states&#x27; rights to execute children (minors tried as adults). This was deemed unconstitutional by Supreme Court in 2005, but the Senate has not reversed its position.

The US Department of State lists the pertinent legal documents regarding adoptions. In particular, the Intercountry Adoption Act of 2000 incorporates the Hague Convention into domestic law.
The act stipulates requirements for US children being adopted internationally. Paragraph 97.3 (§97.3) stipulates the requirements for a US child being adopted internationally in a country that has also ratified the Hague Convention.

A family&#x27; eligibility to adopt from another country is fairly similar to the requirements of domestic adoptions, with additions regarding citizenship, visas, and immigration. These are detailed in the booklet &quot;Intercountry Adoption from A to Z&quot;.

The State Department provides interactive maps detailing US adoption rates since 1999 by several categories.

=== Critiques of International Adoption Between Africa and the United States ===
United States citizens in recent years, have had an increase in interest of the adoption of African children. Before the 1980&#x27;s international adoption was not very favorable to United States citizens, especially with African children. After an increase in positive international relations between the two regions, there is a noticeable difference, &quot;According to NCFA data, there were 10,019 foreign adoptions in calendar year 1986, accounting for 16.4% of all unrelated adoptions occurring in that year.&quot; (Stolley 1993). While both international adoption and African adoption rates have been on the rise, we see the biggest increase in African adoption due to the leniency of the restrictions and protocols. &quot;The resulting scale places the top African countries of origin of children adopted into U.S. families, Ethiopia and Liberia among the least restrictive countries. Two other countries scored similarly on the restrictiveness scale: Guinea-Bissau and Swaziland.&quot; (Breuning 2009). Scholars expect to see an upward trend of American citizens adopting African children as requirements decrease, and general adoption rates increase. 

But as the adoption rates of African children by white American families increase, we see the issues of transracial adoption occur more frequently. The United States Department of Health and Human Services Administration for Children and Families and the National Council For Adoption recorded that in 2020 there were 92,237 black children in foster care and 9,588 adopted black children by white families, a large percentage of those being of direct African descent. The National Association of Black Social Workers has critiqued the efficiency of transracial adoption. The NABSW (National Association of Black Social Workers) has concluded that, because of the historical relations between the two races, that white parents cannot adequately prepare their adopted children for how society treats people of color. The American Adoption Association has also critiqued issues concurring of those of the NABSW. They state that transracial adoption has a lack of diversity, that transracial adoptees face racism notably from their adoptive families, adoptees lack connection to their birth cultures, and adoptees struggle with their racial and cultural self-identities. Through both critiques we can notice that transracial adoption, especially when international can be controversial. While each critique is made with the certainty that each child should be adopted, and that transnational adoption does not and is not always a negative commodity, they are providing reoccurent issues that happen frequently with transracial adoption.

=== Reform efforts ===
Due to the appeal and otherwise obvious difficult issues presented by international adoption, the reform movement seeks to influence governments to adopt regulations that serve the best interest of the child and meet the interests of both the adoptive and biological family members. Significant advances have been made in increasing the regulation of international adoptions.

Adopting families in general have a variety of motivations, such as infertility, being a same-sex couple or single parent, and not wanting to contribute to human overpopulation. International adoptions can have additional motivations, including reducing the chance that a biological family member will later challenge the adoption or interfere in the child&#x27;s life, rescuing a child from a life of poverty (seen by some as patronizing or even neo-colonialist), and &quot;saving&quot; a child in the religious sense of converting them to the family&#x27;s religion (not necessarily considered beneficial by those of different religions or no religion). In particular, evangelical Christians have been urged to adopt internationally in addition to having large biological families. International adoption generates additional controversy where the children will be raised in a different culture or religion than they were born into, or by parents of a different ethnicity, especially where this will be visually apparent to others in the society (which may subject the child to stigmatization or discrimination). Some adoptions compensate for problematic attitudes or practices in the source country, such as abandonment of girls and children with disabilities or serious medical problems, or for economic or aesthetic reasons.

Considering adoption in the crude terms of a market, the global demand to adopt infants is higher than the naturally available supply; most children available for adoption are of school age. This mismatch encourages international adoption as domestic supply is exhausted, but also creates financial incentives to identify more young children for adoption, especially in developing countries and those with high levels of societal corruption or poor law enforcement. Certain aspects of international adoption make it easier for agencies and child recruiters to commit fraud, including distance, language barriers, difficulty enforcing laws across international boundaries, and adoption agency contracts disclaiming responsibility for incorrect biographical details. Abuses which impact adoption decisions that laws, treaties, and reform efforts are trying to stop include representing a child as an orphan when parents are still alive, representing an orphan child as without family when there are extended family members willing to adopt, representing a child as more impoverished than they actually are, falsely representing a child as having no siblings they would be leaving behind, representing to biological parents that a permanent adoption is actually a program to temporarily send their children to a developed country for educational opportunity, and not disclosing that biological parents were (probably illegally) paid to relinquish custody of their children.

==After a disaster==
Of special note to international adoption are campaigns for adoptions that occur after disasters such as hurricanes, tsunamis, and wars. There is often an outpouring of adoption proposals in such cases from foreigners who want to give homes to children left in need. While adoption may be a way to provide stable, loving families for children in need, it is also suggested that adoption in the immediate aftermath of trauma or upheaval may not be the best option. Moving children too quickly into new adoptive homes among strangers may be a mistake because it may turn out that the parents survived and were unable to find the children or there may be a relative or neighbor who can offer shelter and homes. Providing safety and emotional support may be better in those situations than immediate relocation to a new adoptive family. There is an increased risk, immediately following a disaster, that displaced and/or orphaned children may be more vulnerable to exploitation and child trafficking.

== Effects of adoption on adoptive parents==
Adoption is a dynamic shift on both the adoptive parent(s) and the child. The adoption process is long and arduous to ensure that the living environment will be suitable for the child. However, it can be very overwhelming; many grow up with a total loss of connection to their biological families, culture and roots. According to Child Welfare Information Gateway, &quot;The home study process can feel intrusive and may highlight issues that you have not fully addressed.&quot; The uncertainty of the whole process, including being able to even adopt a child can be overwhelming. However, the adoption of the child has countless beneficial effects on the child. Adopting a child can provide a stable foundation and family situation that is essential for growth and development and can provide new opportunities and resources for an adoptive child.  It can also give the adoptive parents a sense of purpose and completion. However, the Post-Adoption Period can be mentally and emotionally taxing for both parties. Child Welfare Information Gateway also states, &quot;Parents may be unprepared for the issues that may come up throughout the lifelong adoption journey.&quot; Unidentified trauma from the adopted child can be hard to pinpoint and treat. Adopted children can also have a fear of rejection and abandonment, which make it hard the parent(s) to connect instantly with the child. This in turn can trigger senses of being let-down, sadness and depression in the parent(s).

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Blue Bayou&quot;, a film written and directed by Justin Chon, depicts a Korean-American man who was adopted by a white family and is at risk for deportation because his parents did not file for his citizenship. The movie is based on true stories about interracial adoption, which is related to the Child Citizenship Act of 2000.

<doc id="1282334" wikidata="Q756590" url="?curid=1282334" title="Comănești">
<text>Comănești (; ) is a town in Bacău County, Western Moldavia, Romania, with a population of 19,996 as of 2021. It is situated on the river Trotuș, which flows between the Ciuc and the Tarcău mountains; of the course of the river pass through Comănești.

The town administers two villages, Podei and Vermești.

==History==
The area of the town of Comănești has been inhabited since the Neolithic period - Neolithic remains were found in the Vermești area of the town. The name is derived from the Cumans who once ruled the region. Its first written record dates from 1657, and its first presence on a map from the 1696 &quot;Sanson Map&quot;.

From the late 18th century onwards, the town was in the domain of the Ghica family of boyars, who remained an important presence in the area until the middle of the 20th century. The Ghica Palace (now housing the local museum), the park in front of the museum, and the railway stations are testimonies to their presence in the town.

During the summers of 2004, 2005, and 2006, Comănești suffered severe flooding of the Trotuș. Some specialists have associated those floods with the deforestation in the area. In 2006 and 2008, Comănești was the site of large explosion-like sounds that were not identified.

==Demographics==
At the 2021 census, the town had 19,996 inhabitants; of those, 84.7% were Romanians and 5% Roma.

==Natives==
* Alexandru Corban (born 1998), footballer 
* Andrei Florean (born 1992), footballer 
* Anca Grigoraș (born 1957), artistic gymnast
* Ionuț Iftimoaie (born 1978), kickboxer 
* Ionela Loaieș (born 1979), artistic gymnast
* Iulian Petrache (born 1991), footballer 
* Ilie Verdeț (1925 – 2001), communist politician, Prime Minister from 1979 to 1982

==Industry==
As of 2003, Comănești had an unemployment rate of 18.1%, much higher than the country&#x27;s average, and the town was declared an underdeveloped region.

The town is in the center of a large coal field and there are also smaller amounts of oil in the area. The Comănești Coal Mine, which in 1989 employed 5,000 people, was finally closed down in 2005, leaving the last group of miners (260 in all) unemployed. The other major industry of the town is forestry, but the large lumberyard and factory were also closed; this area of enterprise is now dominated by small local businesses, but in the last few years some international investors started to appear in the city, especially in retail and commerce.

There have been new initiatives in recent years to attract investment into the area in both the industrial and tourism sectors.

==Train station==

The Comănești train station was built in 1899, modeled on the Lausanne and Curtea de Argeș railway stations. The design was done by the Italian architect , while the construction was done by the engineer Elie Radu.

<text>Primary immigration is a term which describes the movement of the earner of a family, or a young unattached single man, from one country to another, usually to improve their economic condition. Once the primary immigrant is established in the new country, they will often send for their family to come and join them (perhaps many years later), according to family reunification immigration laws. This is known as &quot;secondary immigration&quot;. Most countries tend to restrict the categories of people allowed to be primary immigrants, but allow the reunification of families of people already legally resident.</text><links>

<text>Figures of Earth: A Comedy of Appearances (1921) is a fantasy novel or ironic romance by James Branch Cabell, set in the imaginary French province of Poictesme during the first half of the 13th century. The book follows the earthly career of Dom Manuel the Redeemer from his origins as a swineherd, through his elevation to the rank of Count of Poictesme, to his death. It forms the second volume of Cabell&#x27;s gigantic &quot;Biography of the Life of Manuel&quot;.

Cabell&#x27;s working title for &quot;Figures of Earth&quot; was initially &quot;The Fairy Time&quot;, then &quot;The Figure&quot; or &quot;The Figures&quot;, before the final version emerged. The book was published in February 1921, during the legal battle to clear his previous novel, &quot;Jurgen&quot;, from charges of obscenity. He accordingly dedicated &quot;Figures of Earth&quot; to &quot;six most gallant champions&quot; who had rallied to &quot;Jurgen&quot;&#x27;s defense: Sinclair Lewis, Wilson Follett, Louis Untermeyer, H. L. Mencken, Hugh Walpole, and Joseph Hergesheimer. The scandal that surrounded Cabell&#x27;s name at this time may have adversely affected reviews of &quot;Figures of Earth&quot;, which, according to the author, registered &quot;some disappointment over its lack of indecency&quot;; he himself preferred &quot;Figures of Earth&quot; to &quot;Jurgen&quot;. In the &quot;Author&#x27;s Note&quot; preceding the novel&#x27;s 1927 reprint, Cabell observed that &quot;Not many other volumes, I believe, have been burlesqued and cried down in the public prints by their own dedicatees&quot; alluding to the fact that both Untermeyer and Mencken had publicly expressed dislike with the novel in comparison with &quot;Jurgen&quot;. A 1925 reissue included illustrations by Frank C. Papé. In Cabell&#x27;s later years &quot;Figures of Earth&quot; fell, like most of his other works, into comparative neglect, but two paperback reissues in 1969 and 1971, with introductions by Lin Carter and James Blish respectively, brought it back into circulation.

==Reception==
&quot;The New York Times&quot;, reviewing &quot;Figures of Earth&quot;, declared that &quot;This new novel is, very much of it, beautifully written. Its characters share with the majority of his creations the curiously unhuman quality which is never more apparent than when he is trying to make them quite commonplace. . . . It is a curious, often very beautiful, and at the bottom very sad book.&quot;

On Cabell&#x27;s death in 1958, Edmund Wilson wrote &quot;the more I have thought about &quot;Figures of Earth&quot; -- and its sequel &quot;The Silver Stallion&quot; -- the more remarkable they have come to seem. . . . [T]he chronicle of Manuel the Redeemer was not a book for the Young nor was it a book in the mood of the twenties. The story of the ambitious man of action who is cowardly, malignant and treacherous and who does not even enjoy very much what his crimes and double-dealing have won him, but who is rapidly, after his death, transformed into a great leader, a public benefactor and a saint, has the fatal disadvantage for a novel that the reader finds no inducement to identify himself with its central figure. Yet I am now not sure that this merciless chronicle in which all the values are negative except the naked human will, is not one of the best things of its kind in literature -- on a plane, perhaps, with Flaubert and Swift.&quot;

E. F. Bleiler noted that while the novel&#x27;s storyline was &quot;meandering&quot;, it included &quot;entertaining diversions on symbolically disguised book reviewers, philistines and their sexual obtusities, and pseudo-mythology.&quot; He concluded that &quot;As a totality, [it is] repetitive, nagging, and boring, but with excellent moments.&quot;

Anticipating its 1969 Ballantine reissue, James Blish wrote that &quot;the effect of this heroic fantasy is rather anti-romantic despite its materials, an effect reinforced by Cabell&#x27;s style.&quot; David Langford, in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Fantasy&quot;, comments that &quot;We are not admitted to any of [the protagonist&#x27;s] thoughts, giving the book a chilly aspect despite fine poetic passages.&quot;

<doc id="1282344" wikidata="Q2662880" url="?curid=1282344" title="Neo-Luddism">
<text>Neo-Luddism or new Luddism is a philosophy opposing many forms of modern technology. The term Luddite is generally used as a pejorative applied to people showing technophobic leanings. The name is based on the historical legacy of the English Luddites, who were active between 1811 and 1817. While the original Luddites were mostly concerned with the economic implications of improving technology in regard to industrialization, neo-Luddites tend to have a broader and more holistic distrust of technological improvement.

Neo-Luddism is a leaderless movement of non-affiliated groups who resist modern technologies and dictate a return of some or all technologies to a more primitive level. Neo-Luddites are characterized by one or more of the following practices: passively abandoning the use of technology, harming those who produce technology harmful to the environment, advocating simple living, or sabotaging technology. The modern neo-Luddite movement has connections with the anti-globalization movement, anarcho-primitivism, radical environmentalism, and deep ecology.

Neo-Luddism is based on the concern of the technological impact on individuals, their communities, and/or the environment. Neo-Luddism stipulates the use of the precautionary principle for all new technologies, insisting that technologies be proven safe before adoption, due to the unknown effects that new technologies might inspire.

== Philosophy ==
Neo-Luddism calls for slowing or stopping the development of new technologies. Neo-Luddism prescribes a lifestyle that abandons specific technologies, because of its belief that this is the best prospect for the future. As Robin and Webster put it, &quot;a return to nature and what are imagined as more natural communities&quot;. In the place of industrial capitalism, neo-Luddism prescribes small-scale agricultural communities such as those of the Amish and the Chipko movement in Nepal and India as models for the future.

Neo-Luddism denies the ability of any new technology to solve current problems, such as environmental degradation, nuclear warfare and biological weapons, without creating more, potentially dangerous, problems.

In 1990, attempting to found a unified movement and reclaim the term &quot;Luddite&quot;, Chellis Glendinning published her &quot;Notes towards a Neo-Luddite manifesto&quot;. In this paper, Glendinning describes neo-Luddites as &quot;20th century citizens—activists, workers, neighbors, social critics, and scholars—who question the predominant modern worldview, which preaches that unbridled technology represents progress&quot;. Glendinning voices an opposition to technologies that she deems destructive to communities or are materialistic and rationalistic. She proposes that technology encourages biases, and therefore should question if technologies have been created for specific interests, to perpetuate their specific values including short-term efficiency, ease of production and marketing, as well as profit. Glendinning also says that secondary aspects of technology, including social, economic and ecological implications, and not personal benefit need to be considered before adoption of technology into the technological system.

=== Vision of the future without intervention ===
Neo-Luddism often establishes stark predictions about the effect of new technologies.
Although there is not a cohesive vision of the ramifications of technology, neo-Luddism predicts that a future without technological reform has dire consequences. Neo-Luddites believe that current technologies are a threat to humanity and to the natural world in general, and that a future societal collapse is possible or even probable.

These predictions include changes in humanity&#x27;s place in the future due to replacement of humans by computers, genetic decay of humans due to lack of natural selection, biological engineering of humans, misuse of technological power including disasters caused by genetically modified organisms, nuclear warfare, and biological weapons; control of humanity using surveillance, propaganda, pharmacological control, and psychological control; humanity failing to adapt to the future manifesting as an increase in psychological disorders, widening economic and political inequality, widespread social alienation, a loss of community, and massive unemployment; technology causing environmental degradation due to shortsightedness, overpopulation, and overcrowding.

=== Types of intervention ===
In 1990, attempting to reclaim the term &quot;Luddite&quot; and found a unified movement, Glendinning published her &quot;Notes towards a Neo-Luddite manifesto&quot;. In this paper, Glendinning proposes destroying the following technologies: electromagnetic technologies (this includes communications, computers, appliances, and refrigeration), chemical technologies (this includes synthetic materials and medicine), nuclear technologies (this includes weapons and power as well as cancer treatment, sterilization, and smoke detection), genetic engineering (this includes crops as well as insulin production). She argues in favor of the &quot;search for new technological forms&quot; which are local in scale and promote social and political freedom.

== Movement ==
Contemporary neo-Luddites are a widely diverse group of loosely affiliated or non-affiliated groups which includes &quot;writers, academics, students, families, Amish, Mennonites, Quakers, environmentalists, &quot;fallen-away yuppies&quot;, &quot;ageing flower children&quot; and &quot;young idealists seeking a technology-free environment&quot;. Some Luddites see themselves as victims of technology trying to prevent further victimization (such as Citizens Against Pesticide Misuse and Parents Against Underage Smartphones). Others see themselves as advocates for the natural order and resist environmental degradation by technology (such as Earth First!).

One neo-Luddite assembly was the &quot;Second Neo-Luddite Congress&quot;, held 13–15 April 1996, at a Quaker meeting hall in Barnesville, Ohio. On 24 February 2001, the &quot;Teach-In on Technology and Globalization&quot; was held at Hunter College in New York city with the purpose of bringing together critics of technology and globalization. The two figures who are seen as the movement&#x27;s founders are Glendinning and Kirkpatrick Sale. Prominent neo-Luddites include educator S. D. George, ecologist Stephanie Mills, Theodore Roszak, Scott Savage, Clifford Stoll, Bill McKibben, Neil Postman, Wendell Berry, Alan Marshall and Gene Logsdon. Postman, however, did not consider himself a Luddite.

=== Relationship to violence and vandalism ===
Some neo-Luddites use vandalism or violence to achieve social change and promote their cause.

In May 2012, credit for the shooting of Roberto Adinolfi, an Ansaldo Nucleare executive, was claimed by an anarchist group who targeted him for stating that none of the deaths following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami were caused by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster itself: Adinolfi knows well that it is only a matter of time before a European Fukushima kills on our continent [...] Science in centuries past promised us a golden age, but it is pushing us towards self destruction and slavery [...] With our action we give back to you a small part of the suffering that you scientists are bringing to the world.

Kaczynski, also known as the &quot;Unabomber&quot;, initially sabotaged developments near his cabin but dedicated himself to getting back at the system after discovering a road had been built over a plateau he had considered beautiful. Between 1978 and 1995, Kaczynski engaged in a nationwide bombing campaign against modern technology, planting or mailing numerous home-made bombs, killing three people and injuring 23 others. In his 1995 Unabomber manifesto, Kaczynski states: The kind of revolution we have in mind will not necessarily involve an armed uprising against any government. It may or may not involve physical violence, but it will not be a POLITICAL revolution. Its focus will be on technology and economics, not politics.

In August 2011 in Mexico a group or person calling itself Individualists Tending to the Wild perpetrated an attack with a bomb at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, State of Mexico Campus, intended for the coordinator of its Business Development Center and Technology Transfer. The attack was accompanied by the publication of a manifesto criticizing nanotechnology and computer science.

Sale says that neo-Luddites are not motivated to commit violence or vandalism. The manifesto of the &quot;Second Luddite Congress&quot;, which Sale took a major part in defining, attempts to redefine neo-Luddites as people who reject violent action.

== History ==

=== Origins of contemporary critiques of technology in literature ===
According to Julian Young, Martin Heidegger was a Luddite in his early philosophical phase and believed in the destruction of modern technology and a return to an earlier agrarian world. However, the later Heidegger did not see technology as wholly negative and did not call for its abandonment or destruction. In &quot;The Question Concerning Technology&quot; (1953), Heidegger posited that the modern technological &quot;mode of Being&quot; was one which viewed the natural world, plants, animals, and even human beings as a &quot;standing-reserve&quot;—resources to be exploited as means to an end. To illustrate this &quot;monstrousness&quot;, Heidegger uses the example of a hydroelectric plant on the Rhine river which turns the river from an unspoiled natural wonder to just a supplier of hydropower. In this sense, technology is not just the collection of tools, but a way of being in the world and of understanding the world which is instrumental and grotesque. According to Heidegger, this way of being defines the modern way of living in the West. For Heidegger, this technological process ends up reducing beings to not-beings, which Heidegger calls &#x27;the abandonment of being&#x27; and involves the loss of any sense of awe and wonder, as well as an indifference to that loss.

One of the first major contemporary anti-technological thinkers was French philosopher Jacques Ellul. In his &quot;The Technological Society&quot; (1964), Ellul argued that logical and mechanical organization &quot;eliminates or subordinates the natural world&quot;. Ellul defined &quot;technique&quot; as the entire totality of organizational methods and technology with a goal toward maximum rational efficiency. According to Ellul, technique has an impetus which tends to drown out human concerns: &quot;The only thing that matters technically is yield, production. This is the law of &quot;technique&quot;; this yield can only be obtained by the total mobilization of human beings, body and soul, and this implies the exploitation of all human psychic forces.&quot; In Industrial Revolution England, machines became cheaper to use than men. The five counties of Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Nottinghamshire had a small uprising where they threatened those hired to guard the machines. Another critic of political and technological expansion was Lewis Mumford, who wrote &quot;The Myth of the Machine&quot;. The views of Ellul influenced the ideas of the infamous American neo-Luddite Kaczynski. The opening of Kaczynski&#x27;s manifesto reads: &quot;The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race.&quot; Other philosophers of technology who have questioned the validity of technological progress include Albert Borgmann, Don Ihde and Hubert Dreyfus.

<text>Arnstadt () is a town in Ilm-Kreis, Thuringia, Germany, on the river Gera about south of Erfurt, the capital of Thuringia. Arnstadt is one of the oldest towns in Thuringia, and has a well-preserved historic centre with a partially preserved town wall. The town is nicknamed (&quot;The Gateway to the Thuringian Forest&quot;) because of its location on the northern edge of that forest. Arnstadt has a population of approximately 27,000.

==Geography==
The town centre is on the west side of Gera. The municipality has absorbed several neighbouring municipalities: Angelhausen–Oberndorf (1922), Siegelbach (1994), Rudisleben (1999) and Wipfratal (2019). The neighbouring municipalities are Amt Wachsenburg, Alkersleben, Dornheim, Bösleben-Wüllersleben, Stadtilm, Ilmenau, Plaue and Geratal.

===Climate===
The annual precipitation averages 487 mm.

==History==
A deed of gift issued 1 May 704 in Würzburg by the Thuringian Duke Hedan II to the Anglo-Saxon bishop Willibrord of Utrecht is the first written reference to Arnstadt (&quot;Arnestati&quot;), along with two other towns—the oldest documented reference of settlements in Thuringia and central and eastern Germany. In 726, Arnstadt passed to the Abbey of Echternach, and later to the Abbey of Hersfeld. According to historian August Beck, in 925 the territories of Henry I were extended as a bulwark against the invading Magyars. On 17 December 954, Holy Roman Emperor Otto I made peace in Arnstadt with his rebellious son Liudolf of Swabia and another son, William, whom he appointed Archbishop of Mainz, and decided that the Liebfrauenkirche (Church of Our Lady) would be built.

In the 12th century a part of Arnstadt fell under the rule of the Counts of Kevernburg. On 8 March 1198 the princes of the Holy Roman Empire gathered in Arnstadt and elected Philip of Swabia as King of Germany. In 1220 Arnstadt was first described as a &quot;civitas&quot;, that is a city. On 21 April 1266, the abbot of the Abbey of Hersfeld granted a charter; thereafter, Arnstadt became a hub for trade in timber, grain, wine and wood.

After the extinction of the Kevernburg family from 1302 to 1306, the counts of Schwarzburg took possession of Arnstadt. Attempts by Erfurt 1342 and 1345 to seize what was now a wealthy town failed due to the strong attachment. Arnstadt&#x27;s prosperity was based on the milling industry, the cloth-making trade, tanneries, and trade in wine, woad, wood, grain, wool, and vegetables.

On 30 January 1349, Count Günther XXI of Schwarzburg, an adversary of King Charles IV, was elected and crowned sovereign of Arnstadt in Frankfurt. He renounced this title on 26 May for 20,000 silver marks. A 1404 reference was found in 2000 to Bratwurst originating in Arnstadt, therefore the town claims its invention. In 1496, the Schwarzburg domains were divided into the lordships of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, to which Arnstadt belonged. During the German Peasants&#x27; War 95 participants in the uprising were beheaded as ringleaders in the Arnstadt marketplace, on 17 June and 2 August 1525. The city was forced to pay 3000 guilders for supporting the insurgents. In 1531 the Reformation was introduced into Arnstadt. As a result, the Franciscan maidens&#x27; convent, and subsequently the Franciscan mendicant convent (Barfüßerkloster) were secularized. From 1581, the church of the former Franciscan monastery (now the Oberkirche, &quot;Upper Church&quot;) was the main church of the city. In 1553, work began on the count&#x27;s residence, Neideck Castle. The water palace was completed in 1560.

With the onset of industrialisation, a residential area emerged to the west and south of the old town, and industrial areas to the north. During the Second World War, it was the site of a prisoner-of-war camp, mainly for Poles and Russians. 1,700 prisoners were housed in tents that contained only 100 bunks. The camp was liberated by American Forces in April 1945. A number of mass graves were discovered. 1,200 civilians from the neighbouring city of Weimar were brought on a forced tour of the camp. This included a &quot;parchment display&quot; which displayed a &quot;lampshade made of human skin.&quot; The display also included pieces of skin used for painting pictures. After the Second World War, the town expanded further to the north along the Geratals, new residential areas emerged in the 1970s and 80s, in the east and southeast of Arnstadt, including the residential Raven Hold. Arnstadt is a manufacturing centre with glassworks and foundries, a solar panel production plant, and glove-manufacturing and wood-finishing businesses.

==Main sights==

Arnstadt has a beautifully kept old town, restricted to pedestrian traffic. Its noteworthy buildings include:
* the 13th-century Romanesque-Gothic Liebfrauenkirche (Church of Our Lady)
* an 18th-century palace
* the Bach Church (formerly the New Church)
* the former Franciscan church Oberkirche (&quot;Upper Church&quot;)

In 1703, at the age of eighteen, the composer Johann Sebastian Bach was appointed as organist at the New Church. The family lived for generations in the vicinity of Arnstadt and this was his first post. Newly constructed by the master organ builder Johann Friedrich Wender, the organ was inaugurated by Bach in a Sunday recital for the feast of St John the Baptist. Bach was fortunate to be able to play on such a modern and fully operational instrument: it had well-tempered tuning, permitted diverse harmonic effects, and did not require constant repair. His period in Arnstadt ended in 1707, but already by then Bach had acquired an almost complete mastery of organ and keyboard technique, that would remain with him throughout his life. His organ works ranged from large-scale chorales to more diverse pieces, such as fugues, preludes, fantasias, toccatas, passacaglias, sonatas and concertos. He also drew inspiration from his contemporaries, as well as the Italian, German and French masterworks of the sixteenth and seventeenth century, such as the &quot;Fiori Musicali&quot; of Girolamo Frescobaldi. As point out, for the critical period between 1703 and 1707, Bach has ideal conditions &quot;to strengthen and expand his virtuosity and, as a composer, build and develop his harmonic fantasy and tonal ideas&quot;.

==Sport==
The town hosts an annual high jump meet – &quot;Hochsprung mit Musik&quot; – which attracts some of the world&#x27;s foremost high jumpers. Kajsa Bergqvist set a world record in Arnstadt&#x27;s &quot;Sporthalle am Jahn-sportpark&quot; in 2006.

<text>Nancy MacBeth ( Elliott; born December 29, 1948) is a Canadian politician who was the leader of the Alberta Liberal Party and Leader of the Opposition from 1998 to 2001. She was the first female opposition leader in the province&#x27;s history.

==Early life==
Born in Edmonton, Alberta, MacBeth received a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Alberta, in French and Russian; studying Université Laval, studying French Canadian literature. She subsequently worked as an executive assistant for several Alberta cabinet ministers.

==Early political career==
MacBeth, then known as Nancy Betkowski, first entered electoral politics as an Alberta Progressive Conservative Party Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for the riding of Edmonton-Glenora from 1986 to 1993 in the government of Don Getty. She was Minister of Education from 1986 to 1988, and was then appointed Minister of Health, serving in that position until 1992.

She then ran as a candidate in the party&#x27;s 1992 leadership convention against Ralph Klein. Regarded by the membership as a Red Tory, Betkowski became the preferred candidate of the party establishment. However, Klein&#x27;s populist appeal won him the leadership, and Betkowski did not stand as a candidate in the 1993 election.

==Liberal leader==
She subsequently married portfolio manager and financial writer Hilliard MacBeth.

She then returned to politics in 1998, running for the leadership of the Alberta Liberals after the resignation of Grant Mitchell. Elected to be the MLA for Edmonton-McClung, MacBeth tried to capitalize on discontent with Klein&#x27;s government in some Alberta communities by reaching out to disaffected Red Tories, but proved unable to connect with voters.

In the 2001 provincial election, the Liberals won only seven seats, less than half as many as they had held before the election. Among the losses was MacBeth&#x27;s own seat of Edmonton-McClung. The election left the party a million dollar debt that took about 10 years to pay off.

She left politics again, and was succeeded by Ken Nicol as party leader.

<text>In the 1892 general election, the Conservative Party, led by the Marquess of Salisbury, won the most seats but not an overall majority. As a result, William Gladstone&#x27;s Liberal Party formed a minority government that relied upon Irish Nationalist support. On 3 March 1894, Gladstone resigned over the rejection of his Home Rule Bill and the Earl of Rosebery succeeded him.

<doc id="1282368" wikidata="Q7883752" url="?curid=1282368" title="Underpinning">
<text>In construction or renovation, underpinning is the process of strengthening the foundation of an existing building or other structure. Underpinning may be necessary for a variety of reasons:
* The original foundation isn&#x27;t strong or stable enough.
* The usage of the structure has changed.
* The properties of the soil supporting the foundation may have changed (possibly through subsidence) or were mischaracterized during design.
* The construction of nearby structures necessitates the excavation of soil supporting existing foundations.
* To increase the depth or load capacity of existing foundations to support the addition of another storey to the building (above or below grade).
* It is more economical, due to land price or otherwise, to work on the present structure&#x27;s foundation than to build a new one.
* Earthquake, flood, drought or other natural causes have caused the structure to move, requiring stabilisation of foundation soils and/or footings.

Underpinning may be accomplished by extending the foundation in depth or breadth so it either rests on a more supportive soil stratum or distributes its load across a greater area. Use of micropiles and jet grouting are common methods in underpinning.

Underpinning may be necessary where P class (problem) soils in certain areas of the site are encountered.

Through semantic change the word underpinning has evolved to encompass all abstract concepts that serve as a foundation.

==Mass concrete underpinning==

Mass concrete underpinning is one of the simplest forms of remedial underpinning at shallow depths. This type of underpinning is done by excavating &quot;bays&quot; along and under the existing foundation and filling them with mass concrete. It is sometimes called a &quot;traditional&quot; method to distinguish it from other types of underpinning like piling and needling. The latter often require underpinning specialists and may use proprietary underpinning systems. Mass concrete underpinning work is performed in compliance with the Party Wall Act (in the UK) using plans that are designed with engineering calculations to plan a sequence of excavating bays along and underneath the existing foundation without damaging existing walls. In some cases walls have collapsed because lateral support was inadequate leading to disputes among contractors, subcontractors and architects about where the responsibility lay for the mistake.

Mass concrete underpinning is commonly used when permanent support is needed to comply with the Party Wall Act of 1996 in the construction of a new basement during a restoration, rehabilitation or redevelopment.

In the United Kingdom most subsidence claims are for buildings at least 40 years old with shallow strip foundations. This is one of the most common types of foundations suffering from subsidence-related damage and according to the Building Research Establishment subsidence database, mass concrete underpinning was the most common underpinning and was often applied only to part of a building. If the soils have a low bearing capacity partial underpinning may increase the risk of differential settlement and localized settlement due to additional load on the soil.

==Beam and base underpinning==
The beam and base method of underpinning is a more technically advanced adaptation of traditional mass concrete underpinning. A reinforced concrete beam is constructed below, above or in replacement of the existing footing. The beam then transfers the load of the building to mass concrete bases, which are constructed at designed strategic locations. Base sizes and depths are dependent upon the prevailing ground conditions. Beam design is dependent upon the configuration of the building and the applied loads. Anti-heave precautions are often incorporated in schemes where potential expansion of clay soils may occur.

==Mini-piled underpinning==
Mini-piles have the greatest use where ground conditions are variable, where access is restrictive, where environmental pollution aspects are significant, and where structural movements in service must be minimal. Mini-piled underpinning is generally used when the loads from the foundations need to be transferred to stable soils at considerable depths – usually in excess of . Mini-piles may either be augured or driven steel cased, and are normally between and in diameter. Structural engineers will use rigs which are specifically designed to operate in environments with restricted headroom and limited space, and can gain access through a regular domestic doorway. They are capable of constructing piles to depths of up to . The technique of minipiling was first applied in Italy in 1952, and has gone through many different names, reflecting worldwide acceptance and expiration of the original patents.
The relatively small diameter of mini-piles is distinctive of this type of underpinning and generally uses anchoring or tie backs into an existing structure or rock. Conventional drilling and grouting methods are used for this method of underpinning. These mini-piles have a high slenderness ratio, feature substantial steel reinforcing elements and can sustain axial loading in both senses. The working loads of mini-piles can sustain up to loads.
In comparison to Mass Concrete Underpinning, the engineering aspect of mini-piles is somewhat more involved, including rudimentary engineering mechanics such as statics and strength of materials. These mini-piles must be designed to work in tension and compression, depending on the orientation and application of the design. In detail, attention with design must be paid analytically to settlement, bursting, buckling, cracking, and interface consideration, whereas, from a practical viewpoint, corrosion resistance, and compatibility with the existing ground and structure must be regarded.

==Mini-piled underpinning schemes==
Mini-piled underpinning schemes include pile and beam, cantilever pile-caps and piled raft systems. Cantilevered pile-caps are usually used to avoid disturbing the inside of a building, and require the construction of tension and compression piles to each cap. These are normally linked by a beam. The pile and beam system usually involves constructing pairs of piles on either side of the wall and linking them with a pile cap to support the wall. The pile caps are usually linked by reinforced concrete beams to support the entire length of the wall. Piled raft underpinning systems are commonly used when an entire building needs to be underpinned. The internal floors are completely removed, a grid of piles is installed, and a reinforced concrete raft is then constructed over the complete floor level, picking up and fully supporting all external and internal walls.

==Chemical grout==

One of the uses of the soil improvement technique of pressure grouting is foundation underpinning especially during excavations like subway constructions. This technique has been used in municipal development projects of significant scope in the United States. One of the largest chemical grouting projects was the extension of the Pittsburgh Light Rail Transit subway when the foundations of six large buildings needed to be protected from ground movement and related building settlement.

Pressure grouting can be low pressure or high pressure. &quot;Jet grouting&quot; is a general term used for high pressure grouting where the high pressure air, water and cementing grout are injected into the ground at high velocity. This can be doing with single tube systems to mix the grout with in situ soil to form a grouted &quot;column&quot; in the ground. Double tube systems and triple tube systems using air and water remove some of the soil to create larger grouted bulbs or columns.

Low pressure chemical injection grouting is used to underpin structures in sandy soils.

<text>Bongo Comics Group was a comic book publishing company founded in 1993 by Matt Groening along with Steve &amp; Cindy Vance and Bill Morrison. It published comics related to the animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;Futurama&quot;, as well as the &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; comics, along with original material. The company was named after Bongo, a rabbit character in Groening&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Life in Hell&quot;.

Bongo, at some time in its history, printed &quot;Simpsons Comics&quot;, &quot;Simpsons Comics and Stories&quot;, &quot;Futurama Comics&quot;, &quot;Krusty Comics&quot;, &quot;Lisa Comics&quot;, &quot;Bart Simpson&quot;, &quot;Bartman&quot;, &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy Comics&quot; and &quot;Radioactive Man&quot;.

Zongo Comics, also created by Groening, was Bongo Comics&#x27; counterpart geared towards mature audiences.

==History==

Groening launched Bongo Comics Group in 1993, perceiving a lack of funny books in the comic book industry at the time: &quot;I go into comic book stores and look at all the stuff, and, for the most part, it looks like fairly grim science-fiction and superhero stuff ... I guess I just thought there was room out there for funny comic books.&quot; The company launched four titles, the bi-monthly &quot;Simpsons Comics&quot; and &quot;Radioactive Man Vol. 1&quot;, and the thrice-annually &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy Comics&quot; and &quot;Bartman&quot;. Groening hoped that the new company would revitalise the industry, and held discussions to publish cross-overs with characters from other publishing companies. The comics use original story-lines rather than simply adapting episodes of the television series; however, in 2011 editor Bill Morrison explained that the stories &quot;fit in with the continuity of the shows.&quot;

The company launched &quot;Futurama Comics&quot;, based on the cartoon series of the same name, in 2000.

2012 saw the company change their logo, and a new creative director was unveiled, with Nathan Kane promoted internally to replace the departing Bill Morrison.

It was announced at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2018 that Bongo would be shutting down in October. &quot;Simpsons Comics&quot; #245 was the final issue released by Bongo.

<doc id="1282384" wikidata="Q2161560" url="?curid=1282384" title="Roger A. Pielke Jr.">
<text>Roger A. Pielke Jr. (born November 2, 1968) is an American political scientist and a nonresident senior fellow at the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute. Before he was a professor of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES), and was the director of the Sports Governance Center within the Department of Athletics at the Center for Science and Technology Policy Research at the University of Colorado Boulder.

He previously served in the Environmental Studies Program and was a Fellow of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) where he served as director of the Center for Science and Technology Policy Research at the University of Colorado Boulder from 2001 to 2007. Pielke was a visiting scholar at Oxford University&#x27;s Saïd Business School in the 2007–2008 academic year.

A prolific writer, his interests include understanding the politicization of science; decision making under uncertainty; policy education for scientists in areas such as climate change, disaster mitigation, and world trade; and research on the governance of sports organizations, including FIFA and the NCAA.

== Education and background ==
Pielke earned a B.A. in mathematics (1990), an M.A. in public policy (1992), and a Ph.D. in political science, all from the University of Colorado Boulder. Prior to his positions at CU-Boulder, from 1993 to 2001 he was a staff scientist in the Environmental and Societal Impacts Group of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. From 2002 to 2004 Pielke was director of graduate studies for the CU-Boulder Graduate Program in Environmental Studies and in 2001 students selected him for the Outstanding Graduate Advisor Award. Pielke serves on numerous editorial boards and advisory committees, retains many professional affiliations, and sat on the board of directors of WeatherData, Inc. from 2001 to 2006. In 2012 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Linköping University and the Public Service Award of the Geological Society of America. In 2024 Pielke became a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.

== Professional writing ==
Pielke&#x27;s early work was on the Space Shuttle program. In 1993 he argued that the shuttle was expensive and risky — that it was &quot;probable&quot; that another orbiter would be lost within 20–35 flights. Shortly before the loss of Columbia he warned that loss of another shuttle was only a matter of time. He has also been critical of the space station program.

Pielke has also written extensively on climate change policy. He has written that he accepts the IPCC view of the underlying science, stating, &quot;The IPCC has concluded that greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activity are an important driver of changes in climate. And on this basis alone I am personally convinced that it makes sense to take action to limit greenhouse gas emissions.&quot; He also states that, &quot;Any conceivable emissions reductions policies, even if successful, cannot have a perceptible impact on the climate for many decades&quot;, and from this he concludes that, &quot;In coming decades the only policies that can effectively be used to manage the immediate effects of climate variability and change will be adaptive.&quot;

On the issues of hurricanes and climate change he has argued that the trend in increasing damage from hurricanes is primarily due to societal and economic factors (chiefly an increase in wealth density), rather than change in the frequency and intensity.

A &quot;Guide to Climate Skeptics&quot; published by &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; notes that Pielke&#x27;s published views have led to him being considered by some a &quot;denier&quot; of climate change and by others an &quot;alarmist&quot;. In October 2016, in a hacked email disclosed by WikiLeaks, Judd Legum states that a ThinkProgress blog was instrumental in his firing from the FiveThirtyEight website.

In April 2015, Pielke joined with a group issuing &quot;An Ecomodernist Manifesto&quot;. The other authors were: John Asafu-Adjaye, Linus Blomqvist, Stewart Brand, Barry Brook. Ruth DeFries, Erle Ellis, Christopher Foreman, David Keith, Martin Lewis, Mark Lynas, Ted Nordhaus, Rachel Pritzker, Joyashree Roy, Mark Sagoff, Michael Shellenberger, Robert Stone, and Peter Teague.

Pielke was named in a letter sent by Representative Raúl Grijalva (D-AZ) to institutions that employed scientists who had testified to Congress about climate change. The letter stated, &quot;My colleagues and I cannot perform our duties if research or testimony provided to us is influenced by undisclosed financial relationships,&quot; and requested information including the sources and amounts of outside funding for those scientists who had testified. 

Pielke rebuked Grijalva&#x27;s investigation into alleged financial influence on him by fossil fuel companies. &quot;I have no funding, declared or undeclared, with any fossil fuel company or interest. I never have. Representative Grijalva knows this too, because when I have testified before the US Congress, I have disclosed my funding and possible conflicts of interest... the Congressman and his staff, along with compliant journalists, are busy characterizing me in public as a &#x27;climate skeptic&#x27; opposed to action on climate change. This of course is a lie. I have written a book calling for a carbon tax, I have publicly supported President Obama’s proposed EPA carbon regulations, and I have just published another book strongly defending the scientific assessment of the IPCC with respect to disasters and climate change.&quot; Pielke stated in a blog post published after Grijalva began demanding Pielke&#x27;s employer to disclose all of Pielke&#x27;s personal correspondence (including draft letters) as it related to climate science.

Pielke contends that Democratic members of Congress were motivated by political and partisan interests. He believes that he was targeted due to his echoing of IPCC opinion that it is &#x27;incorrect to associate the increasing costs of disasters with the emission of greenhouse gases&#x27;.

<doc id="1282398" wikidata="Q2637233" url="?curid=1282398" title="Kyle Orton">
<text>Kyle Raymond Orton (born November 14, 1982) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback. He played college football for Purdue, where he started four straight bowl games. He was selected by the Chicago Bears in the fourth round of the 2005 NFL draft. After an injury to Bears starter Rex Grossman, Orton was pressed into service as the starting quarterback during his rookie year, starting the first 14 games of the 2005 season, but was replaced by Grossman for the playoffs that year. Orton did not play at all in 2006, and sparingly in 2007. He regained his starting job from Grossman in 2008, but the team finished a disappointing 9–7 and out of the playoffs. In the offseason of that year, he was traded to the Denver Broncos.

Orton spent the next three seasons with Broncos, where he amassed a 12–21 record as a starting quarterback over three seasons. He lost his starting role to Tim Tebow during the 2011 season and was released by the team. Orton was claimed off waivers by the Kansas City Chiefs. He spent the next three seasons as a back-up quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills. Orton became the Bills&#x27; starting quarterback in 2014, where he went 7–5. He retired after the season.

==Early life==
Orton attended Southeast Polk High School in Pleasant Hill, Iowa, where he was a four-sport star in football, basketball, tennis, and track &amp; field.

At the end of his high school career, Orton was the No. 2 ranked quarterback in the nation by SuperPrep and No. 7 by Rivals.com. His career passing statistics were 208 for 450 (46.2%), 3,176 yards with 24 touchdowns, and 18 interceptions. He earned honorable mention all-state and first-team all-conference his senior year, after completing 95 of 192 attempts (49.5%), 1,366 yards with 12 touchdowns, and 5 interceptions.

Orton wore uniform No. 18 in honor of former Nebraska Cornhuskers&#x27; quarterback Brook Berringer who died in a plane crash in 1996.

==College career==
Orton committed to Purdue, but considered attending Colorado before ultimately deciding on the former. Orton started in the 2001, 2002 and 2004 Sun Bowl, and the 2003 Capital One Bowl. He is the only Purdue quarterback to start four consecutive bowl games (Drew Brees and Mark Herrmann started three straight). During his undergraduate years at Purdue, Orton was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity.

In 2004, Orton was the preseason third-team All-American quarterback, behind USC&#x27;s Matt Leinart and Oklahoma&#x27;s Jason White as well as a Heisman Trophy hopeful early in the season. After starting the season 5–0 the Boilermakers lost 4 straight close games. During that stretch Orton suffered injuries against Michigan and Northwestern. Brandon Kirsch took over for Orton in the 3rd quarter against Northwestern and Orton subsequently missed the game the following week against Iowa. Orton was able to return to the field in the 4th quarter against Ohio State to help the Boilermakers get the go ahead TD to overcome the Buckeyes and snap their losing streak. The following week the Boilermaker&#x27;s defeated their rival, Indiana Hoosiers, 63–24. During that game Orton tied former Purdue quarterback Drew Brees&#x27; record for number of passing yards in a game (522). That record stood until 2018 when David Blough threw for 572 yards in a game against University of Missouri.

Orton makes a cameo in NCAA Football 2006, where he says, &quot;EA Sports, it&#x27;s in the game&quot;, along with Derek Anderson in the game&#x27;s introduction.

===Chicago Bears===

====2005====
Orton was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the fourth round of the 2005 NFL Draft. In the 2005 NFL season, he was rushed into the Bears starting lineup as a rookie after a preseason injury to starter Rex Grossman, and the poor play of back-up Chad Hutchinson. Orton started 15 games of the season, but was replaced by Grossman after halftime during the Bears&#x27; Week 15 victory against the Atlanta Falcons. After sitting for Week 16, Orton started the regular season finale, Week 17, against the Minnesota Vikings. The outcome of this game, for the Chicago Bears, did not have any effect on their post-season hopes. The Bears had already clinched the NFC North championship and a first-round bye in the 2005–06 playoffs with their Week 16 victory over the Green Bay Packers. Grossman then started for the Bears in their only post-season game. They lost to the Carolina Panthers.

Overall, the Bears had a record of 10–5 in games that Orton started, including an eight-game winning streak after a 1–3 start. Despite the team&#x27;s success, Orton finished with the lowest quarterback rating in the NFL (59.7) among all &quot;qualified&quot; quarterbacks (those with 224+ pass attempts). Despite the low rating, the Bears coaches repeatedly insisted that they were pleased with Orton&#x27;s performance. The coaching staff asked Orton to minimize mistakes and to let the rushing attack and the defense win ballgames rather than employing an aggressive passing attack.

Measuring Orton&#x27;s victories, his rookie season was successful. His 15 starts and 10 victories are both rookie records for Bears quarterbacks. 10 rookie wins is also sixth most in the NFL since 1970. , Orton held at least 5 other Bears rookie franchise records, including completions (190), attempts (368), passing yards (1,869), passing TDs (9), and interceptions in a single game (5 on September 25 against Cincinnati).

====2006====
Following the 2005 season, the Bears signed veteran Brian Griese as the team&#x27;s second-string quarterback. Orton, now demoted, became the Bears’ third-string quarterback, and did not see any action throughout the entire 2006 season.

====2007====
The following off-season, the Bears acquired Chris Leak, who had previously led the Florida Gators to a BCS Championship, shortly after the 2007 NFL draft. Leak struggled in training camp, while Orton, who had trained in the off-season, excelled but was placed at third string. According to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Orton was en route to overtake Griese&#x27;s (then) second string position. Orton continued to show signs of improvement in the preseason. He completed sixteen of twenty-five passes for 151 yards and one touchdown en route to leading the Bears to a comeback victory over the Houston Texans.

After the Bears lost their chances of making a postseason berth, Lovie Smith chose to start Orton over Griese. Orton made his first start in nearly two seasons on December 17, 2007, against the Minnesota Vikings. The Bears lost the game 20–13. Orton finished with 22 completions on 38 attempts, 184 yards, and 1 interception. He improved in the final two games of the season, leading the Bears to two consecutive victories, passing for 294 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception.

====2008====
On February 25, 2008, the Bears and Orton agreed to a one-year contract extension running through the 2009 season. Competition for the starting quarterback job was expected to be fierce with Rex Grossman, during training camp.

On August 18, after deadlock against Grossman in games with the Kansas City Chiefs and Seattle Seahawks, Bears head coach Lovie Smith named Orton the team&#x27;s starting QB for the 2008 season in Week 3 of the preseason, despite not throwing a pass over 17 yards or for a touchdown in the first two preseason games.

On September 7, 2008, Orton led the Bears to a 29–13 victory over the Indianapolis Colts in the first regular season game of the season. He threw for a career-high 334 yards and two touchdowns, while completing 24 of 34 passes in a 34–7 victory over the Detroit Lions. He finished the game with a career-high, at that time, passer rating of 121.4.

From the start of November 2008, Kyle Orton passed for ten touchdowns, and four interceptions, leading the Bears to a 4–3 record. Orton sustained an ankle injury against the Detroit Lions in Week 9 of the NFL season, and did not start the next week. He rushed himself back into the starting lineup a week after Grossman had a solid outing coming off the bench against the Titans. After his return, Orton threw eight touchdowns, and eight interceptions while averaging a quarterback rating of 66.9, including ratings of 39.1 against Minnesota, 49.2 against New Orleans, and 48.7 against Green Bay.

The Bears finished the season with a 9–7 record, while missing the playoffs by one game. Coach Lovie Smith was pleased with Orton&#x27;s performance and believed he would be the team&#x27;s starting quarterback for the following season. However, Jerry Angelo, the team&#x27;s general manager, stated he wished to further solidify the quarterback position in the long run.
===Denver Broncos===

====2009====
On April 2, 2009, the Bears traded Orton (along with their first and third-round draft picks in 2009 and their first-round pick in &#x27;10) to the Denver Broncos for Pro Bowl quarterback Jay Cutler and the Broncos&#x27; fifth round pick in &#x27;09.

On June 13, Broncos head coach Josh McDaniels declared Orton the starting quarterback for the season. Orton led the Broncos to a 12–7 victory in the 2009 season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals. The game was won on a deflected pass that landed in the arms of Brandon Stokley who took it 87 yards for a touchdown. This play has been called &quot;The Immaculate Deflection&quot; in many media sources.

Over the next five weeks, Orton led the Broncos to a surprising 6–0 record to begin the season. His most impressive effort in that streak came against the New England Patriots, when he completed 35–48 passes for 330 yards and orchestrated a 98-yard drive to tie the game and send it into overtime. He threw his first interception of the season to Randy Moss, who came in to help on the attempted Hail Mary pass, at the end of the first half. It was his first in 173 pass attempts which dated back to 2008 when he was with the Chicago Bears. He led another drive for the game-winning field goal in overtime. On October 13, 2009, Kyle Orton was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week, for that effort.

On Nov 15, Orton suffered an ankle injury on the road against the Washington Redskins. He came out of the game at halftime with a career-high passer rating of 134.7. The injury kept him from starting the next game against the Chargers. He did return partway through that game, replacing Chris Simms.

For the 2009 season (playing in 16 games with 15 starts), Orton threw 21 touchdown passes and 12 interceptions with an 86.8 QB rating.

====2010====
Orton was named the Broncos starting quarterback for 2010. He signed a one-year contract extension (through the 2011 season), on August 19, 2010. On September 26, 2010, Orton threw for 476 yards against the Indianapolis Colts, a career-high. Less than two months later, November 14, Orton threw a career-high four touchdown passes against the Kansas City Chiefs. Later in the season, with the Broncos eliminated from playoff contention, Orton played poorly against the Arizona Cardinals on December 12, 2010. Tim Tebow was named the starter the following week by interim coach Eric Studesville and played the last three games of the season. Orton finished the season with 3,653 yards, 20 touchdowns, and nine interceptions

====2011====
Orton entered the 2011 season as the Broncos starting quarterback. The team had a 1–4 start with Orton throwing 8 touchdowns and 7 interceptions as the starter, accumulating 979 yards and completing 58.7% of his passes. He was replaced as the starter by Tim Tebow during the week 5 contest against the San Diego Chargers, and Orton never took another snap for the Broncos. Orton was waived on November 22, 2011, officially ending his tenure with the Denver Broncos. He had a record of 12–21 as a starter during his time with the Broncos, throwing for 8,434 yards, 49 touchdowns, and 28 interceptions.

===Kansas City Chiefs===

He was claimed off waivers by the Kansas City Chiefs on November 23, 2011, after a season-ending injury to starting quarterback Matt Cassel. Kansas City paid $2.5 million remaining on Orton&#x27;s nearly $8.9 million salary for the year. Chicago (looking to replace injured Jay Cutler) and the Dallas Cowboys (because of concerns of injuries to backup quarterback Jon Kitna) also made claims on him. However, since Kansas City had a worse record than the other two teams it was given priority in claiming him per the NFL&#x27;s inverse order of the standings rule on the waiver priority list.

On December 4, 2011, in a game against his former team, the Chicago Bears, Orton came into the second quarter to relieve Tyler Palko, but was injured on his first pass attempt. Palko led the Chiefs to a 10–3 win over the Bears, but struggled the following week in a 37–10 loss to the Jets.

Palko&#x27;s injury paved the way for a quarterback change, and on December 18, Orton was named the starting Chiefs&#x27; quarterback by new interim coach Romeo Crennel. In his first game as their starter, he led the Chiefs to a 19–14 upset of the previously undefeated Green Bay Packers, ending the defending 2011 Super Bowl champions winning streak at 19 games, dating back to the previous season. He completed 23 of 31 passes for 299 yards with no interceptions and no passing touchdowns.

In the final two games of the season, Orton lost 16–13 in overtime against the Raiders before returning to Denver to defeat the Broncos in the season finale.

===Dallas Cowboys===
On March 14, 2012, Orton signed a three-year contract with the Dallas Cowboys to replace former backup quarterback Jon Kitna, who retired after the Cowboys&#x27; 2011 season. In week 4 against the Bears, his former team, Orton replaced Tony Romo late in the game and threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Jason Witten, though the Bears still won the contest 34–18. The Cowboys went on to finish the season 8–8, losing to the Washington Redskins in a do-or-die week 17 contest.

In the 2013 season, Orton had seen minimal time on the field with a total of 40 passing yards which all came during week 14 against the Chicago Bears. On December 27, 2013, head coach Jason Garrett announced that Orton would be the starting quarterback for the week 17 game against the Philadelphia Eagles after Tony Romo underwent back surgery. He threw for 30 completions and 358 yards on 46 attempts (65.2%) and two touchdowns. He threw an early interception by Mychal Kendricks which was dropped by his tight end Jason Witten, and another interception by Brandon Boykin on the Cowboys&#x27; last drive which secured a 24–22 victory for the Eagles.
===Buffalo Bills===

Prior to the 2014 NFL season, Orton threatened the Cowboys with a possible retirement and did not report to any of the team&#x27;s organized team activities or workouts. Besides accumulating $70,000 in fines, quarterback coach Wade Wilson reported that Orton did not maintain any communications with the Cowboys during this period. Orton, who risked losing part of his signing bonus by holding out, eventually showed up to training camp. The team released him on July 15 and promoted Brandon Weeden to the backup quarterback position. The Cowboys were relieved of Orton&#x27;s $3.25 million salary in 2014, but still had to pay him a signing bonus. He would follow Jeremiah Ratliff as the second player in two straight years to force the Cowboys to waive him.

On August 29, 2014, Orton agreed on a two-year deal with the Buffalo Bills, with the team paying him $5 million in the first year alone, making him the highest paid backup quarterback in the league. On September 29, 2014, at the beginning of week 5, Bills head coach Doug Marrone announced that Orton would become the new starting quarterback for the Bills in relief of EJ Manuel. Taking over with the team at 2–2, Orton led the Bills to a 9–7 finish. Though they missed the playoffs, the 2014 season marked the first time since 2004 that the Bills had finished with a winning record. Orton finished the season with 3,018 passing yards, 18 touchdowns, 10 interceptions and an 87.8 quarterback rating.

On December 29, 2014, Orton announced his retirement from the NFL.

<text>Roger A. Pielke Sr. (born October 22, 1946) is an American meteorologist with interests in climate variability and climate change, environmental vulnerability, numerical modeling, atmospheric dynamics, land/ocean – atmosphere interactions, and large eddy/turbulent boundary layer modeling. He particularly focuses on mesoscale weather and climate processes but also investigates on the global, regional, and microscale.

== Background ==
Pielke was awarded a B.A. in mathematics at Towson State College in 1968, and then an M.S. and Ph.D. in meteorology at Pennsylvania State University (PSU) in 1969 and 1973, respectively. 

From 1971 to 1974 he worked as a research scientist at the NOAA Experimental Meteorology Lab (EML), from 1974 to 1981 he was an associate professor at the University of Virginia (UVa), served the primary academic position of his career as a professor at Colorado State University (CSU) from 1981 to 2006, was deputy of Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA) at Colorado State University from 1985 to 1988, from 1999 to 2006 was Colorado State Climatologist, at Duke University was a research professor from 2003 to 2006, and was a visiting professor at the University of Arizona from October–December 2004. Since 2005, Pielke has served as senior research scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at CU-Boulder and an emeritus professor of the Department of Atmospheric Science at CSU. After retiring from CSU and he remains a CIRES emeritus researcher.

Pielke spearheaded development of the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) with William R. Cotton.

Pielke has served as Chairman and Member of the American Meteorological Society Committee on Weather Forecasting and Analysis, as Chief Editor of &quot;Monthly Weather Review&quot;, was elected a Fellow of the American Meteorological Society (AMS) in 1982 and a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) in 2004, has served as Editor-in-Chief of the U.S. National Science Report to the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics, as Co-Chief Editor of the &quot;Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences&quot;, and as Editor of &quot;Scientific Online Letters on the Atmosphere&quot;.

== On climate change ==
Although he had stated that carbon dioxide is not the predominant forcing of global warming, Pielke said in 2007 that he was not a &quot;sceptical scientist&quot; about climate change: 

: &quot;As I have summarized on the Climate Science weblog, humans activities do significantly alter the heat content of the climate system, although, based on the latest understanding, the radiative effect of CO2 has contributed, at most, only about 28% to the human-caused warming up to the present. The other 72% is still a result of human activities!&quot;
Pielke has criticized the IPCC for its conclusions regarding CO2 and global warming and accused it of selectively choosing data to support a selective view of the science. 

In 2010 Pielke revisited a question provided by Andrew Revkin &quot;Is most of the observed warming over the last 50 years likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations&quot;, Pielke stated that &quot;the 2010 answer ... remains NO&quot;, and that &quot;The added greenhouse gases from human activity clearly have a role in increasing the heat content of the climate system from what it otherwise would be&quot;, but &quot;there are other equally or even more important significant human climate forcings&quot; and furthermore &quot;We now know, however, that the natural variations of atmospheric and ocean circulation features within the climate system produces global average heat changes that are substantially larger than what was known in 2005. The IPCC models have failed to adequately simulate this effect.&quot;

==Family==
Pielke is married. He has two children. His son Roger A. Pielke Jr. is a political scientist and works in the field of climate policy. His daughter Tara Pielke is a web developer.

<doc id="1282402" wikidata="Q4696621" url="?curid=1282402" title="Aid to Families with Dependent Children">
<text>Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) was a federal assistance program in the United States in effect from 1935 to 1997, created by the Social Security Act (SSA) and administered by the United States Department of Health and Human Services that provided financial assistance to children whose families had low or no income.

The program grew from a minor part of the social security system to a significant system of welfare administered by the states with federal funding. However, it was criticized for offering incentives for women to have children, and for providing disincentives for women to join the workforce. In July 1997, AFDC was replaced by the more restrictive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.

==History==
The program was created under the name Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) by the Social Security Act of 1935 as part of the New Deal. It was created as a means tested entitlement which subsidized the income of families where fathers were &quot;deceased, absent, or unable to work&quot;. It provided a direct payment of $18 per month for one child, and $12 for a second child. In 1994, the average payment was $420/month.

The federal government required contributions from individual states, and authorized state discretion to determine who received aid and in what amount. In 1961 a change in the law permitted states to extend benefits to families where the father was unemployed, a measure which 25 states eventually adopted. The words &quot;families with&quot; were added to the name in 1962, partly due to concern that the program&#x27;s rules discouraged marriage.

The civil rights movement and the efforts of the National Welfare Rights Organization in the 1960s expanded the scope of welfare entitlements to include black women. The welfare rolls’ racial demographics changed drastically. The majority of welfare recipients still remained white and most black female recipients continued to work. Starting in 1962, the Department of Health and Human Services allowed state-specific exemptions as long as the change was &quot;in the spirit of AFDC&quot; in order to allow some experimentation. By 1996 spending was $24 billion per year. When adjusted for inflation, the highest spending was in 1976, which exceeded 1996 spending by about 8%. In 1967 the federal government began requiring states to establish the paternity of children eligible for the program, and extended benefits to &quot;unemployed male parents with a work history&quot;.

===Man-in-the-house rule===
A number of states enacted so called &quot;man-in-the-house&quot; rules, which disqualified families if there was any adult male present in the household whatsoever. This was part of a broader attempt to discourage welfare dependency by the undeserving, in particular black families where the man didn&#x27;t have work or where the woman had a relationship with men who didn&#x27;t take care of the family.

The &quot;man-in-the-house&quot; rule was struck down in 1968 by the Supreme Court in &quot;King v. Smith&quot;. Thereafter, families with males in the household were eligible for benefits if they were not deemed to be actual or substitute parents, although any financial contribution on the part of the male to the family was still considered a part of the family&#x27;s total income. By 1981, the Supreme Court went further and required that states take into consideration the income earned by step-fathers.

===Thirty-and-a-third rule===

The year 1967 saw the establishment of the thirty-and-a-third rule, which allowed families to keep their first $30 earned along with one third of their income following the first $30 without the change affecting their eligibility for benefits. This and other factors led to a large increase in enrollment. For example, caseloads rose 24% from 1960 to 1965, but rose 126% in the period from 1965 to 1970.

===&quot;Califano v. Westcott&quot;===
The Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Califano v. Westcott&quot; (1979) that two-parent families with an unemployed mother are entitled to Aid to Families with Dependent Children benefits.

==Criticism==
Early in the program, there were concerns about whether it encouraged unwed motherhood. Some advocates complained that the rule had the effect of breaking up marriages and promoting matriarchy:

[T]he AFDC program tended to treat households with a cohabiting male who was not the natural father of the children much more leniently than those with a resident spouse or father of the children. This feature created a clear disincentive for marriage and also a clear incentive for divorce, because women who married face the reduction or loss of their AFDC benefits.

One economist was unable to find convincing evidence that welfare programs have a strong effect on the dissolution of marriages. But right or wrong, this argument was among the stepping stones leading to the modification of AFDC toward TANF.

==Termination==
In 1996, President Bill Clinton negotiated with the Republican-controlled Congress to pass the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which drastically restructured the program. Among other changes, a lifetime limit of five years was imposed on the receipt of benefits; the newly limited nature of the replacement program was reinforced by calling AFDC&#x27;s successor Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Many Americans continue to refer to TANF as &quot;welfare&quot; or AFDC.

TANF has remained controversial. In 2003, LaShawn Y. Warren, an ACLU Legislative Counsel, said that TANF gives states an incentive &quot;to deny benefits to those who need it most. The solution to getting people out of the cycle of poverty is not to prematurely kick them off welfare. Too many have been denied aid unfairly, creating a false impression that the number of people who need help has decreased.&quot; In 2006, a &quot;New Republic&quot; editorial wrote, &quot;A broad consensus now holds that welfare reform was certainly not a disaster—and that it may, in fact, have worked much as its designers had hoped.&quot;

<text>Secure Electronic Delivery (SED) is a service created in 2003 and provided by the British Library Document Supply Service (BLDSS). Its purpose is to enable faster delivery of digital materials as encrypted, copyright-compliant PDF Documents, to a personal e-mail address. These documents are supplied from the British Library via its On Demand service. When the British Library supplies articles electronically, it sends them securely in order to ensure its usage is permitted (research purposes) and copyright law is observed.

==Methods==
As the publishing industry, authors and creators become highly protective of their assets and intellectual property, they impose strict rules on delivery methods to prevent copyright infringement. Nowadays, DRM-enabled secure delivery appears to be the most widely used solution to address issues faced by libraries in supplying ebooks and digital materials to their users. SED, one of these solutions, is using Adobe LiveCycle Digital Rights Management (LCDRM) as an encryption method to deliver documents.

==Advantages==
SED offers convenience, quality and speed as documents are delivered upon request at any location and on any device. Requested articles are scanned for high quality reproduction, opened anywhere on any machine, including mobile devices.

== Restrictions==
The following are restrictions hold in a SED service implementation:
* The digital material is accessible only for 14 days via a link sent to a personal message.
* Due to copyright reasons, the material can be opened only once, saved for 14 days and does not allow a copy-paste action.
* Upon display, the material must be printed from the same device and reprinted only once.
* The On Demand encryption technology works best on the default Safari browser although other browsers may accommodate it.

<text>The Chimes: A Goblin Story of Some Bells that Rang an Old Year Out and a New Year In, commonly referred to as The Chimes, is a novella by Charles Dickens, first published in 1844, one year after &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. It is the second in his series of &quot;Christmas books&quot;, five novellas with strong social and moral messages that he published during the 1840s. In addition to &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; and &quot;The Chimes&quot;, the Christmas books include &quot;The Cricket on the Hearth&quot; (1845), &quot;The Battle of Life&quot; (1846), and &quot;The Haunted Man and the Ghost&#x27;s Bargain&quot; (1848).

==Plot==
Toby (&quot;Trotty&quot;) Veck, an elderly &quot;ticket-porter&quot;, plies his trade from the steps of a church, whose Chimes have for many years cheered and encouraged him as he trots around delivering letters. Today, on New Year&#x27;s Eve, Trotty is filled with gloom at reports in the newspapers of working class crime and immorality, and concludes that the poor must be incorrigibly bad by nature.

Trotty&#x27;s daughter Meg and her long-time fiancé Richard arrive to announce their decision to marry the very next day. Although desperately poor and with few prospects, they see no point in waiting any longer, reasoning that they will otherwise regret in later years the missed opportunity to have cheered and helped each other as husband and wife. The couple&#x27;s happiness is dispelled by an encounter with Alderman Cute who sanctimoniously lectures them on how they have brought their own misfortunes on themselves, and who promises to ‘Put down’ such people. The couple feel they barely have a right to exist, let alone to marry.

Trotty carries a note from Cute to Sir Joseph Bowley MP, who dispenses charity to the poor in the manner of a paternal dictator. Bowley is ostentatiously settling his debts, and berates Trotty because he is unable to pay a small debt to Mrs Chickenstalker, a local shopkeeper. Returning home, convinced that he and his fellows are naturally ungrateful and have no place in society, Trotty encounters Will Fern, a poor countryman, and his nine-year-old orphaned niece, Lilian. Fern has been accused of vagrancy and Trotty warns that Cute plans to have him arrested. Trotty takes Fern and Lilian home, and he and Meg share their meagre food and poor lodgings. Meg is distressed, and it seems the encounter with Cute has dissuaded her from marrying Richard.

Trotty sits up late with a newspaper and is reinforced in his belief that the working classes are naturally wicked by reading of a poor woman who in desperation has killed both herself and her baby. Suddenly, the Chimes burst violently in on his thoughts, and seem to call him to the church. Climbing to the bellchamber, he discovers a swarming, leaping cloud of dwarf phantoms that vanish as the Chimes cease. Then he sees the dark foreboding goblin figures of the bells. The goblin of the Great Bell berates him for the wrong he has done the Chimes in losing faith in man&#x27;s destiny to improve.

Trotty sees himself lying dead at the base of the bell tower, and is told that he had fallen and died there nine years ago. Meg&#x27;s life is to be an object lesson for him: he must &quot;learn from the creature nearest to [his] heart&quot; what pressures there are on the poor. There follows a series of visions in which, helpless to interfere, he is shown the troubled lives of Meg, Richard, Will and Lilian over the subsequent years. Richard descends into alcoholism; Meg eventually marries him in an effort to save him, but he dies ruined, leaving her with a baby; Will is driven in and out of prison; Lilian turns to prostitution and dies of grief. At last, destitute and homeless, Meg is driven to contemplate drowning herself and her child. Trotty breaks down when he sees Meg poised to jump into the river, and cries that he has learned his lesson, that &quot;there is no loving mother on the earth who might not come to this, if such a life had gone before&quot;. He finds himself able to catch her dress and prevent her from jumping.

Trotty awakens at home as the Chimes joyfully ring in the New Year on the day of Meg and Richard&#x27;s wedding. Their friends arrive to provide a surprise feast and celebration. Will and Lilian are warmly greeted by Mrs Chickenstalker, who turns out to be an old friend. The author explicitly invites the reader to decide if this awakening is a dream-within-a-dream. The reader is asked to bear in mind &quot;the stern realities from which these shadows come&quot;, and to endeavour to correct, improve, and soften them.

==Development history==
The book was written in late 1844, during Dickens&#x27;s year-long visit to Italy. John Forster, his first biographer, records that Dickens, hunting for a title and structure for his next contracted Christmas story, was struck one day by the clamour of the Genoese bells audible from the villa where they were staying.
Two days later Forster received a letter from Dickens which read simply: &quot;We have heard THE CHIMES at midnight, Master Shallow!&quot;, and the writing of the book began. Forster describes Dickens&#x27;s intentions in writing &quot;The Chimes&quot; as striking &quot;a blow for the poor&quot;. 
Dickens returned to London for a week in December 1844 and gave readings of the finished book to friends prior to publication, to judge its impact. The artist Daniel Maclise, who had contributed two illustrations to &quot;The Chimes&quot; and attended two of these events, portrayed the reading of 3 December 1844 in a well-known sketch.

==Title==
The chimes are old bells in the church on whose steps Trotty Veck plies his trade. The book is divided into four parts named &quot;quarters&quot;, after the quarter chimes of a striking clock. (This parallels Dickens naming the parts of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; &quot;staves&quot; – that is &quot;stanzas&quot; – and dividing &quot;The Cricket on the Hearth&quot; into &quot;chirps&quot;.)

==Literary significance and reception==
&quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; had been extremely well received the previous year, and &quot;The Chimes&quot; aroused public interest and anticipation. Five different stage productions of the book were running within weeks of publication and nearly 20,000 copies were sold in the first three months. It had a high media profile, and was widely reviewed and discussed. Critical opinion was divided; those sympathetic to its social and political message liked the book, but others thought it dangerously radical. The &quot;Northern Star&quot; reviewer called Dickens &quot;the champion of the poor&quot;; &quot;John Bull&quot; rejected his unflattering caricatures of philanthropy. It was certainly a financial success for Dickens, and remained popular for many years, although in the long term its fame was eclipsed by that of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.

==Allusions and references==
The novel&#x27;s setting is contemporary and the 1840s (the &quot;Hungry Forties&quot;) were a time of social and political unrest.

Trotty&#x27;s conviction that poor people are naturally wicked is influenced by an article in his newspaper about a young woman who has tried to drown herself and her child, and this motif returns at the climax of the book, when Meg is driven to contemplate the same course of action. This is a reference to Mary Furley, a destitute young woman sentenced to death in 1844 for infanticide after her desperation not to return to the workhouse led to a suicide attempt in which her child drowned. This case caused great public debate in the late spring of 1844. Dickens took part in the general outcry against the sentence, which was eventually commuted to transportation. Among other works inspired by the Furley case is Thomas Hood&#x27;s poem &quot;The Bridge of Sighs&quot;.

Alderman Cute is a parody of Sir Peter Laurie, a Middlesex magistrate, alderman and former Lord Mayor of London, known for his determination to &quot;put down&quot; the lower classes and their antisocial behaviour.

==Adaptations==
In 1914, the book was made into a silent film, &quot;The Chimes&quot;, directed by Thomas Bentley.

A musical adaptation of &quot;The Chimes&quot; was created in 1992 by Lisa Kofod and Gay Donat Reed, with music by Paul Johnson. A staged reading of this work was produced at The Workhouse Theatre in New York City.

&quot;The Chimes&quot; was adapted into a 24-minute clay-animated film in 2000 by Xyzoo Animation. It won a Cine Special Jury award in 2002.

The Colonial Radio Theatre in Boston produced a full cast radio production of &quot;The Chimes&quot; in 2000. This was released on CD by Blackstone Audio in 2007, and re-released by Brilliance Audio in 2011.

In 2004, a stage adaptation by Les Smith premiered at the Southwark Playhouse.

In 2015, Audible issued &quot;The Chimes&quot; as a free audible book with Christmas well wishes from the company to its subscribers.

In 2022, Average Romp released &quot;The Chimes&quot; as a full-cast audio dramatisation starring Toby Jones as Toby Veck.

<doc id="1282411" wikidata="Q205198" url="?curid=1282411" title="Orthogonal instruction set">
<text>In computer engineering, an orthogonal instruction set is an instruction set architecture where all instruction types can use all addressing modes. It is &quot;orthogonal&quot; in the sense that the instruction type and the addressing mode may vary independently. An orthogonal instruction set does not impose a limitation that requires a certain instruction to use a specific register so there is little overlapping of instruction functionality.

Orthogonality was considered a major goal for processor designers in the 1970s, and the VAX-11 is often used as the benchmark for this concept. However, the introduction of RISC design philosophies in the 1980s significantly reversed the trend against more orthogonality. 

Modern CPUs often simulate orthogonality in a preprocessing step before performing the actual tasks in a RISC-like core. This &quot;simulated orthogonality&quot; in general is a broader concept, encompassing the notions of decoupling and completeness in function libraries, like in the mathematical concept: an &quot;orthogonal function set&quot; is easy to use as a basis into expanded functions, ensuring that parts don’t affect another if we change one part.

==Basic concepts==
At their core, all general purpose computers work in the same underlying fashion; data stored in a main memory is read by the central processing unit (CPU) into a fast temporary memory (e.g. CPU registers), acted on, and then written back to main memory. Memory consists of a collection of data values, encoded as numbers and referred to by their &quot;addresses&quot;, also a numerical value. This means the same operations applied to the data can be applied to the addresses themselves. While being worked on, data can be temporarily held in processor registers, scratchpad values that can be accessed very quickly. Registers are used, for example, when adding up strings of numbers into a total.

===Single instruction, single operand===
In early computers, the instruction set architecture (ISA) often used a single register, in which case it was known as the &quot;accumulator&quot;. Instructions included an address for the operand. For instance, an codice_1 instruction would cause the CPU to retrieve the number in memory found at that address and then add it to the value already in the accumulator. This very simple example ISA has a &quot;one-address format&quot; because each instruction includes the address of the data.

One-address machines have the disadvantage that even simple actions like an addition require multiple instructions, each of which takes up scarce memory, and requires time to be read. Consider the simple task of adding two numbers, 5 + 4. In this case, the program would have to load the value 5 into the accumulator with the codice_2 instruction, use the codice_1 instruction pointing to the address for the 4, and finally codice_4 to store the result, 9, back to another memory location.

===Single instruction, multiple operands===
Further improvements can be found by providing the address of both of the operands in a single instruction, for instance, codice_5. Such &quot;two-address format&quot; ISAs are very common. One can further extend the concept to a &quot;three-address format&quot; where the codice_6 is also folded into an expanded codice_7.

It is often the case that the basic computer word is much larger than needed to hold just the instruction and an address, and in most systems, there are leftover bits that can be used to hold a constant instead of an address. Instructions can be further improved if they allow any one of the operands to be replaced by a constant. For instance, codice_8 eliminates one memory cycle, and codice_9 another.

===Multiple data===
Further complexity arises when one considers common patterns in which memory is accessed. One very common pattern is that a single operation may be applied across a large amount of similar data. For instance, one might want to add up 1,000 numbers. In a simple two-address format of instructions, there is no way to change the address, so 1,000 additions have to be written in the machine language. ISAs fix this problem with the concept of &quot;indirect addressing&quot;, in which the address of the next point of data is not a constant, but itself held in memory or a machine register. This means the programmer can change the address by performing addition on that memory location or register. ISAs also often include the ability to offset an address from an initial location, by adding a value held in one of its registers, in some cases a special &quot;index register&quot;. Others carry out this addition automatically as part of the instructions that use it.

The variety of addressing modes leads to a profusion of slightly different instructions. Considering a one-address ISA, for even a single instruction, codice_10, we now have many possible &quot;addressing modes&quot;:

* Immediate (constant): codice_11 — adds the constant value to the result in the accumulator
* Direct address: codice_12 — add the value stored at address 1
* Memory indirect: codice_13 — read the value in address 1, use that value as another address and add that value

Many ISAs also have registers that can be used for addressing as well as math tasks. This can be used in a one-address format if a single address register is used. In this case, a number of new modes become available:

* Register direct: codice_14 — add the value stored in the address held in register one
* Displacement: codice_15 — add the constant to the address register, then add the value found in memory at that resulting location
* Index: codice_16 — add the value in register 1 to the address register to make a new address and then adds the value at that location to the accumulator
* Autoindex: codice_17 — as in the Index case, but automatically increments the address

==Orthogonality==
Orthogonality is the principle that every instruction should be able to use any supported addressing mode. In this example, if the direct addressing version of codice_10 is available, all the others should be as well. The reason for this design is not aesthetic, the goal is to reduce the total size of a program&#x27;s object code. By providing a variety of addressing modes, the ISA allows the programmer to choose the one that precisely matches the need of their program at that point, and thereby reduce the need to use multiple instructions to achieve the same end. This means the total number of instructions is reduced, both saving memory and improving performance. Orthogonality was often described as being highly &quot;bit efficient&quot;.

Keeping the addressing mode specifier bits separate from the opcode operation bits produces an orthogonal instruction set.

As the ultimate end of orthogonal design is simply to allow any instruction to use any type of address, implementing orthogonality is often simply a case of adding more wiring between the parts of the processor. However, it also adds to the complexity of the instruction decoder, the circuitry that reads an instruction from memory at the location pointed to by the program counter and then decides how to process it.

In the example ISA outlined above, the codice_19 instruction using direct encoding already has the data it needs to run the instruction and no further processing is needed, the decoder simply sends the value into the arithmetic logic unit (ALU). However, if the codice_20 instruction is used, the address has to be read, the value at that memory location read, and then the ALU can continue. This series of events will take much longer to complete and requires more internal steps.

As a result, the time needed to complete different variations of an instruction can vary widely, which adds complexity to the overall CPU design. Therefore, orthogonality represents a tradeoff in design; the computer designer can choose to offer more addressing modes to the programmer to improve code density at the cost of making the CPU itself more complex.

When memory was small and expensive, especially during the era of drum memory or core memory, orthogonality was highly desirable. However, the complexity was often beyond what could be achieved using current technology. For this reason, most machines from the 1960s offered only partial orthogonality, as much as the designers could afford. It was in the 1970s that the introduction of large scale integration significantly reduced the complexity of computer designs and fully orthogonal designs began to emerge. By the 1980s, such designs could be implemented on a single-chip CPU.

In the late 1970s, with the first high-powered fully orthogonal designs emerging, the goal widened to become the high-level language computer architecture, or HLLCA for short. Just as orthogonality was desired to improve the bit density of machine language, HLLCA&#x27;s goal was to improve the bit density of high-level languages like ALGOL 68. These languages generally used an activation record, a type of complex stack that stored temporary values, which the ISAs generally did not directly support and had to be implemented using many individual instructions from the underlying ISA. Adding support for these structures would allow the program to be translated more directly into the ISA.

==Orthogonality in practice==

===The PDP-11===
The PDP-11 was substantially orthogonal (primarily excepting its floating point instructions). Most integer instructions could operate on either 1-byte or 2-byte values and could access data stored in registers, stored as part of the instruction, stored in memory, or stored in memory and pointed to by addresses in registers or memory. Even the PC and the stack pointer could be affected by the ordinary instructions using all of the ordinary data modes. &quot;Immediate&quot; mode (hardcoded numbers within an instruction, such as ADD #4, R1 (R1 = R1 + 4) was implemented as the mode &quot;register indirect, autoincrement&quot; and specifying the program counter (R7) as the register to use reference for indirection and to autoincrement. (Encoded as ADD (R7)+,R1 .word 4.)

The PDP-11 used 3-bit fields for addressing modes (0-7) so there were (electronically) 8 addressing modes. An additional 3-bit field specified the registers (R0–R5, SP, PC). Immediate and absolute address operands applying the two autoincrement modes to the Program Counter (R7), provided a total of 10 conceptual addressing modes. Most two operand instructions supported all addressing modes for both parameters.

===The VAX-11===
The VAX-11 extended the PDP-11&#x27;s orthogonality to all data types, including floating point numbers. Instructions such as &#x27;ADD&#x27; were divided into data-size dependent variants such as ADDB, ADDW, ADDL, ADDP, ADDF for add byte, word, longword, packed BCD and single-precision floating point, respectively. Like the PDP-11, the Stack Pointer and Program Counter were in the general register file (R14 and R15).

The general form of a VAX-11 instruction would be:

 opcode [ operand ] [ operand ] ...

Each component being one byte, the opcode a value in the range 0–255, and each operand consisting of two nibbles, the upper 4 bits specifying an addressing mode, and the lower 4 bits (usually) specifying a register number (R0–R15).

In contrast to the PDP-11&#x27;s 3-bit fields, the VAX-11&#x27;s 4-bit sub-bytes resulted in 16 addressing modes (0–15). However, addressing modes 0–3 were &quot;short immediate&quot; for immediate data of 6 bits or less (the 2 low-order bits of the addressing mode being the 2 high-order bits of the immediate data, when prepended to the remaining 4 bits in that data-addressing byte). Since addressing modes 0-3 were identical, this made 13 (electronic) addressing modes, but as in the PDP-11, the use of the Stack Pointer (R14) and Program Counter (R15) created a total of over 15 conceptual addressing modes (with the assembler program translating the source code into the actual stack-pointer or program-counter based addressing mode needed).

===The MC68000 and similar===
Motorola&#x27;s designers attempted to make the assembly language orthogonal while the underlying machine language was somewhat less so. Unlike PDP-11, the MC68000 (68k) used separate registers to store data and the addresses of data in memory. The ISA was orthogonal to the extent that addresses could only be used in those registers, but there was no restriction on &quot;which&quot; of the registers could be used by different instructions. Likewise, the data registers were also orthogonal across instructions. Unlike the PDP-11, the 68000 only supported one general addressing mode for two-parameter instructions. The other parameter was always a register, with the exception of MOV. The MOV instructions supported all addressing modes for both parameters.

In contrast, the NS320xx series were originally designed as single-chip implementations of the VAX-11 ISA. Although this had to change due to legal issues, the resulting system retained much of the VAX-11&#x27;s overall design philosophy and remained completely orthogonal. This included the elimination of the separate data and address registers found in the 68k.

===The 8080 and follow on designs===
The 8-bit Intel 8080 (as well as the 8085 and 8051) microprocessor was basically a slightly extended accumulator-based design and therefore not orthogonal. An assembly-language programmer or compiler writer had to be mindful of which operations were possible on each register: Most 8-bit operations could be performed only on the 8-bit accumulator (the A-register), while 16-bit operations could be performed only on the 16-bit pointer/accumulator (the HL-register pair), whereas simple operations, such as increment, were possible on all seven 8-bit registers. This was largely due to a desire to keep all opcodes one byte long.

The binary-compatible Z80 later added prefix-codes to escape from this 1-byte limit and allow for a more powerful instruction set. The same basic idea was employed for the Intel 8086, although, to allow for more radical extensions, &quot;binary&quot;-compatibility with the 8080 was not attempted here. It maintained some degree of non-orthogonality for the sake of high code density at the time. The 32-bit extension of this architecture that was introduced with the 80386, was somewhat more orthogonal despite keeping all the 8086 instructions and their extended counterparts. However, the &quot;encoding-strategy&quot; used still shows many traces from the 8008 and 8080 (and Z80). For instance, single-byte encodings remain for certain frequent operations such as push and pop of registers and constants; and the primary accumulator, the EAX register, employs shorter encodings than the other registers on certain types of operations. Observations like this are sometimes exploited for code optimization in both compilers and hand written code.

==RISC==
A number of studies through the 1970s demonstrated that the flexibility offered by orthogonal modes was rarely or never used in actual problems. In particular, an effort at IBM studied traces of code running on the System/370 and demonstrated that only a fraction of the available modes were being used in actual programs. Similar studies, often about the VAX, demonstrated the same pattern. In some cases, it was shown that the complexity of the instructions meant they took longer to perform than the sequence of smaller instructions, with the canonical example of this being the VAX&#x27;s codice_21 instruction.

During this same period, semiconductor memories were rapidly increasing in size and decreasing in cost. However, they were not improving in speed at the same rate. This meant the time needed to access data from memory was growing in &quot;relative&quot; terms in comparison to the speed of the CPUs. This argued for the inclusion of more registers, giving the CPU more temporary values to work with. A larger number of registers meant more bits in the computer word would be needed to encode the register number, which suggested that the instructions themselves be reduced in number to free up room.

Finally, a paper by Andrew Tanenbaum demonstrated that 97% of all the constants in a program are between 0 and 10, with 0 representing between 20 and 30% of the total. Additionally, between 30 and 40% of all the values in a program are constants, with simple variables (as opposed to arrays or such) another 35 to 40%. If the processor uses a larger instruction word, like 32-bits, two register numbers and a constant can be encoded in a single instruction as long as the instruction itself does not use too many bits.

These observations led to the abandonment of the orthogonal design as a primary goal of processor design, and the rise of the RISC philosophy in the 1980s. RISC processors generally have only two addressing modes, direct (constant) and register. All of the other modes found in older processors are handled explicitly using load and store instructions moving data to and from the registers. Only a few addressing modes may be available, and these modes may vary depending on whether the instruction refers to data or involves a transfer of control.

<text>Syriac Christianity (, &quot;Mšiḥoyuṯo Suryoyto&quot; or &quot;Mšiḥāyūṯā Suryāytā&quot;) is a branch of Eastern Christianity of which formative theological writings and traditional liturgies are expressed in the Classical Syriac language, a variation of the old Aramaic language. In a wider sense, the term can also refer to Aramaic Christianity in general, thus encompassing all Christian traditions that are based on liturgical uses of the Aramaic language and its variations, both historical and modern.

Along with Greek and Latin, Classical Syriac was one of the three most important languages of Early Christianity. It became a vessel for the development of a distinctive Syriac form of Christianity which flourished throughout the Near East and other parts of Asia during Late Antiquity and the Early Medieval period, giving rise to various liturgical and denominational traditions, represented in modern times by several churches which continue to uphold the religious and cultural heritage of Syriac Christianity.

Syriac Christianity comprises two liturgical traditions: the East Syriac Rite and the West Syriac Rite.
The East Syriac Rite (also known variably as the Assyrian, Sassanid, Babylonian or Persian Rite), whose main anaphora is the Holy Qurbana of Saints Addai and Mari, is the rite of the Assyrian Church of the East (including its offshoot, the Chaldean Catholic Church and the component Chaldean Syrian Church), the Ancient Church of the East, and the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church. The West Syriac Rite (also called Antiochian Syriac Rite), which has the Divine Liturgy of Saint James as its anaphora, is the rite of the Syriac Orthodox Church (including the component Jacobite Syrian Christian Church), the Maronite Church, the Syriac Catholic Church, and the Indian Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, Syro-Malankara Catholic Church, and Malabar Independent Syrian Church. Protestant forms of this rite are used by the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church and the St. Thomas Evangelical Church of India.

In India, indigenous Eastern Christians (Saint Thomas Christians) of both liturgical traditions (East and West Syriac) are called Syrian Christians. The traditional East Syriac community is represented by the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church and the Chaldean Syrian Church of India. The West Syriac liturgical tradition was introduced after 1665, and the community associated with it is represented by the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church (a part of the Syriac Orthodox Church), the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church (both of them belonging to the Oriental Orthodoxy), the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church (an Eastern Catholic church in the Catholic Church), the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church (part of the Anglican Communion), and the Malabar Independent Syrian Church (an independent Oriental Orthodox Church not part of the Oriental Orthodox Communion).

The Syriac language is a variety of Aramaic language, that emerged in Edessa, Upper Mesopotamia (Assyria) during the first centuries AD. It is related to the Aramaic of Jesus, a Galilean dialect. This relationship added to its prestige for Christians. The form of the language in use in Edessa predominated in Christian writings and was accepted as the standard form, &quot;a convenient vehicle for the spread of Christianity wherever there was a substrate of spoken Aramaic&quot;. The area where Syriac or Aramaic was spoken, an area of contact and conflict between the Roman Empire and the Sasanian Empire, extended from around Antioch in the west to Seleucia-Ctesiphon, the Sasanian capital, in the east and comprised the whole or parts of present-day Syria, Lebanon, Israel/Palestine, Iraq, and parts of Turkey and Iran, with its speakers being largely Semitic Assyrians, Arameans, Phoenicians and Judeans.

==Name==
In modern English, the term &quot;Syriac Christianity&quot; is preferred over the alternative form &quot;Syrian Christianity&quot;, that was also commonly used in older literature, as a synonym, particularly during the 19th and the 20th centuries. Since the latter term proved to be very polysemic, a tendency occurred (firstly among scholars) to reduce the term &quot;Syrian Christianity&quot; to its primary (regional) meaning, that designates the Christianity in Syria, while more specific term (Syriac Christianity) came to be used as preferred designation for the entire Syriac branch of Eastern Christianity. That distinction is not yet universally accepted, even among scholars. It is gradually introduced in most of the English speaking world, with some notable exceptions. Churches of Syriac tradition in India still self-identify, in Indian English, as &quot;Syrian&quot; Churches, both for sociolinguistic and legal reasons.

Modern distinctions between &quot;Syrian&quot; and &quot;Syriac&quot; (Christianity) are observed in English language as a partially accepted convention, but such distinctions do not exist in most of the other languages, nor on the endonymic (native) level among adherents of Syriac Christianity. Native terms (ethnonyms, demonyms, linguonyms) that were derived from the name of Syria did not possess a distinctive formal duality that would be equivalent to the conventional English distinction between terms &quot;Syrian&quot; and &quot;Syriac&quot;. Since the proposed distinction is not yet universally accepted among scholars, its individual and often inconsistent application has created a complex narrative, that is additionally burdened by older problems, inherited from terminological controversies that originated much earlier, within Syriac studies in particular, and also within Aramaic studies in general.

The use of Syrian/Syriac labels was also challenged by common scholarly reduction of Syriac Christianity to the Eastern Aramaic Christian heritage found among the Assyrian people in what is today Iraq, Southeast Turkey and Northwest Iran, and its offspring. Such reduction was detaching Syriac Christianity from Western Aramaic Christian traditions, that were enrooted in the very homeland of Christianity, encompassing ancient Aramaic-speaking communities in Judea and Palestine, with Galilee and Samaria, and also those in the regions of Nabatea and Palmyrene to the east, and Phoenicia and Syria proper to the north. Since Western Aramaic Christians did not fit into narrow scholarly definition of Syriac Christianity, focused on Eastern Aramaic traditions, various researchers have opted for an additional use of some wider terms, like &quot;Aramaic Christianity&quot;, or &quot;Aramaic Christendom&quot;, thus designating a religious, cultural and linguistic continuum, encompassing the entire branch of Christianity that stemmed from the first Aramaic-speaking Christian communities, formed in apostolic times, and then continued to develop throughout history, mainly in the Near East and also in several other regions of Asia, including India and China.

In English language, the term &quot;Aramaic Christianity&quot; should not be confused with term &quot;Aramean Christianity&quot;, since the first designation is linguistically defined and thus refers to Aramaic-speaking Christians in general, while the second designation is more specific and refers only to Christian Arameans.

== History ==


Christianity began in the Near East, in Jerusalem among Aramaic-speaking Christians (Assyrians). It soon spread to other Aramaic-speaking Semitic peoples like Aramaic pagan peoples along the Eastern Mediterranean coast and also to the inland parts of the Roman Empire and beyond that into the Parthian Empire and the later Sasanian Empire, including Mesopotamia, which was dominated at different times and to varying extents by these empires.

The ruins of the Dura-Europos church, dating from the first half of the 3rd century are concrete evidence of the presence of organized Christian communities in the Aramaic-speaking area, far from Jerusalem and the Mediterranean coast, and there are traditions of the preaching of Christianity in the region as early as the time of the Apostles.

However, &quot;virtually every aspect of Syriac Christianity prior to the fourth century remains obscure, and it is only then that one can feel oneself on firmer ground&quot;. The fourth century is marked by the many writings in Syriac of Saint Ephrem the Syrian, the &quot;Demonstrations&quot; of the slightly older Aphrahat and the anonymous ascetical &quot;Book of Steps&quot;. Ephrem lived in the Roman Empire, close to the border with the Sasanian Empire, to which the other two writers belonged. However, another source claims there is a significant amount of evidence from the fourth century and before about liturgical practices.

Other items of early literature of Syriac Christianity are the Diatessaron of Tatian, the Curetonian Gospels and the Syriac Sinaiticus, the Peshitta Bible and the Doctrine of Addai.

The bishops who took part in the First Council of Nicea (325), the first of the ecumenical councils, included twenty from Syria and one from Persia, outside the Roman Empire. Two councils held in the following century divided Syriac Christianity into two opposing parties.

=== East-West theological contrast ===
Syriac Christianity is divided on several theological issues, both Christological and Pneumatological.

In 431, the Council of Ephesus, which is reckoned as the third ecumenical council, condemned Nestorius and Nestorianism. That condemnation was consequently ignored by the East Syriac Church of the East, which had been previously established in the Sasanian Empire as a distinct Church at the Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon in 410, and which at the Synod of Dadisho in 424 had declared the independence of its head, the Catholicos, in relation to &quot;western&quot; (Roman Empire) Church authorities. Even in its modern form of Assyrian Church of the East and Ancient Church of the East, it honours Nestorius as a teacher and saint.

In 451, the Council of Chalcedon, the fourth ecumenical council, condemned Monophysitism, and also rejected Dyoprosopism. This council was rejected by the Oriental Orthodox Churches (among which is the Syriac Orthodox Church) that use the West Syriac Rite. The Patriarchate of Antioch was consequently divided between two communities, pro-Chalcedonian and non-Chalcedonian. The Chalcedonians were often labelled as &#x27;Melkites&#x27; (Imperials), while their opponents were labelled Monophysites (those who believe in the one rather than two natures of Christ) and Jacobites (after Jacob Baradaeus).

In 553, the Council of Constantinople, the fifth ecumenical council, anathematized Theodore of Mopsuestia, and also condemned several writings of Theodoret of Cyrus and Ibas of Edessa (see: Three-Chapter Controversy). Since those three theologians were highly regarded among Eastern Syriac Christians, further rifts were created, culminating in 612, when a major council of the Church of the East was held in Seleucia-Ctesiphon. Presided by Babai the Great (d. 628), the council officially adopted specific Christological formulations, using Syriac term &quot;qnoma&quot; (ܩܢܘܡܐ) as designation for dual (divine and human) properties within one prosopon (person) of Christ.

Theological estrangement between East Syriac and West Syriac branches was manifested as a prolonged rivalry, that was particularly intensive between the Church of the East and the Maphrianate of the East (Syriac Orthodox Church), with each branch claiming that its doctrines were not heretical while also accusing the other of teaching heresy. Their theological estrangement has persisted through the medieval and early modern periods and into the present era. In 1999, the Coptic Orthodox Church, a sister-church of the Syriac Orthodox Church, blocked admittance of the Assyrian Church of the East to the Middle East Council of Churches, which has among its members the Chaldean Catholic Church, and demanded that it remove from its liturgy the mention of Diodorus of Tarsus, Theodore of Mopsuestia and Nestorius, whom it venerates as &quot;the Greek doctors&quot;.

=== East-West liturgical contrast ===
The liturgies of the East and West Syriacs are quite distinct. The East Syriac Rite is noted especially for its eucharistic Qurbana of Addai and Mari, in which the Words of Institution are absent. West Syriacs use the Syro-Antiochian or West Syriac Rite, which belongs to the family of liturgies known as the Antiochene Rite.

The Syriac Orthodox Church adds to the Trisagion (&quot;Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us&quot;) the phrase &quot;who were crucified for us&quot;. The Church of the East interpreted this as heretical. Patriarch Timothy I of the Church of the East declared: &quot;And also in all the countries of Babylon, of Persia, and of Assyria, and in all the countries of the sunrise, that is to say, among the Indians, the Chinese, the Tibetans, the Turks, and in all the provinces under the jurisdiction of this Patriarchal See, there is no addition of Crucifixus es pro nobis&quot;.

Among the Saint Thomas Christians of India, the East Syriac Rite was the one originally used, but those who in the 17th century accepted union with the Syriac Orthodox Church adopted the rite of that church.

=== Further divisions ===
A schism in 1552 in the Church of the East gave rise to a separate patriarchate, which at first entered into union with the Catholic Church but later formed the nucleus of the present-day Assyrian Church of the East and Ancient Church of the East, while at the end of the 18th century most followers of the earlier patriarchate chose union with Rome and, with some others, now form the Chaldean Catholic Church.

In India, all of the Saint Thomas Christians are still collectively called &quot;Syrian Christians&quot;. The majority of the Saint Thomas Christians, who initially depended on the Church of the East, maintained union with Rome in spite of discomforts felt at Latinization by their Portuguese rulers and clergy, against which they protested. They now form the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church. A small group, which split from these in the early 19th century, united at the beginning of the 20th century, under the name of Chaldean Syrian Church, with the Assyrian Church of the East.

Those who in 1653 broke with the Catholic Church as dominated by the Portuguese in India and soon chose union with the Syriac Orthodox Church later split into various groups. The first separation was that of the Malabar Independent Syrian Church in 1772. At the end of the 19th century, the Malankara Marthoma Syrian Church separated following which they adopted a Reformed variant of the St.James Liturgy and later in the course of the 20th century, a division arose among those who remained united with the Syriac Orthodox Church who insisted on full autocephaly and are now called the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church and those, the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church, who remain faithful to the patriarch.

A reunion movement led in 1930 to the establishment of full communion between some of the Malankara Syrian Orthodox and the Catholic Church. They now form the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church.

In the Middle East, the newly enthroned patriarch of the Syriac Orthodox Church, Ignatius Michael III Jarweh, declared himself a Catholic and, having received confirmation from Rome in 1783, became the head of the Syriac Catholic Church.

In the 19th and 20th centuries many Syriac Christians, both East and West, left the Middle East for other lands, creating a substantial diaspora.

In modern times, several Churches of Syriac tradition are actively participating in ecumenical dialogue.

==Terms for Syriac Christians==

Indigenous Aramaic-speaking communities of the Near East (, ) adopted Christianity very early, perhaps already from the first century, and began to abandon their three-millennia-old traditional ancient Mesopotamian religion, although this religion did not fully die out until as late as the tenth century. The kingdom of Osroene, with the capital city of Edessa, was absorbed into the Roman Empire in 114 as a semi-autonomous vassal state and then, after a period under the supremacy of the Parthian Empire, was incorporated as a Roman province, first in 214, and finally in 242.

In 431 the Council of Ephesus declared Nestorianism a heresy. Nestorians, persecuted in the Byzantine Empire, sought refuge in the parts of Mesopotamia that were part of the Sasanian Empire. This encouraged acceptance of Nestorian doctrine by the Persian Church of the East, which spread Christianity outside Persia, to India, China, Tibet and Mongolia, expanding the range of this eastern branch of Syriac Christianity. The western branch, the Jacobite Church, appeared after the Council of Chalcedon&#x27;s condemnation of Miaphysitism in 451.

East Syriac Christians were involved in the mission to India, and many of the present Churches in India are in communion with either East or West Syriac Churches. These Indian Christians are known as Saint Thomas Christians.

In modern times, even apart from the Eastern Protestant denominations like Mar Thoma Syrian Church of Malabar and St. Thomas Evangelical Church of India, which originated from Churches of the West Syriac Rite, various Evangelical denominations continue to send representatives among Syriac Christians. As a result, several Evangelical groups have been established, particularly the Assyrian Pentecostal Church (mostly in America, Iran, and Iraq) from East Syriac Christians, and the Aramean Free Church (mostly in Germany, Sweden, America and Syria) from West Syriac Christians. Because of their new (Protestant) theology these are sometimes not classified as traditional Churches of Syriac Christianity.

<text>The Cricket on the Hearth: A Fairy Tale of Home is a novella by Charles Dickens, published by Bradbury and Evans, and released 20 December 1845 with illustrations by Daniel Maclise, John Leech, Richard Doyle, Clarkson Stanfield and Edwin Henry Landseer. Dickens began writing the book around 17 October 1845 and finished it by 1 December. Like all of Dickens&#x27;s Christmas books, it was published in book form, not as a serial.

Dickens described the novel as &quot;quiet and domestic [...] innocent and pretty.&quot; It is subdivided into chapters called &quot;Chirps&quot;, similar to the &quot;Quarters&quot; of &quot;The Chimes&quot; or the &quot;Staves&quot; of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. It is the third of Dickens&#x27;s five Christmas books, preceded by &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1843) and &quot;The Chimes&quot; (1844), and followed by &quot;The Battle of Life&quot; (1846) and &quot;The Haunted Man and the Ghost&#x27;s Bargain&quot; (1848).

==Plot==
John Peerybingle, a slow but honest carrier, lives contentedly with his beloved wife Dot and their infant son. A teenage nursemaid, Tilly Slowboy, provides intermittent help with the child. Dot is still an attractive young woman, much younger than her husband, but she loves him dearly and is perfectly content with her life and her home. A cricket chirps cheerfully on the hearth, reflecting the family&#x27;s happiness.

One night, John gives a lift in his cart to a mysterious elderly stranger who invites himself to lodge with the family for a few days. John is surprised at the alacrity with which Dot agrees.

The Peerybingles are friends with Caleb Plummer, a poor toymaker who lives with his blind daughter Bertha. Caleb is employed by the stern and ill-natured toy merchant Tackleton who announces that he intends to marry one of Dot&#x27;s old schoolfriends, May Fielding. Some years earlier, May had been the sweetheart of Caleb&#x27;s son, Edward, before his presumed death in South America, but now with few prospects May has little option but to concede to her mother&#x27;s insistence that she should marry the wealthy Tackleton.

Tackleton draws John&#x27;s attention to an assignation between Dot and the lodger, and they watch unobserved through a window as the lodger, now seen to be a young man in disguise, clasps Dot around the waist. John is devastated at his wife&#x27;s betrayal, and that night as he sits before the fire he contemplates murdering the young man. Suddenly, the cricket on the hearth begins to chip, and in fairy shape shows John visions of his wife&#x27;s history from her school days onwards, always emphasising her goodness and loyalty. After a sleepless night, John&#x27;s desire for revenge fades, and he convinces himself that Dot could never have been truly happy with him, and that he must for her own sake release her from her marriage vows.

But before John can say anything, the mysterious lodger is revealed to be Caleb&#x27;s son, Edward, who has unexpectedly returned. Having heard that May was to marry Tackleton, he disguised himself as an old man in order to discover whether his former sweetheart had forgotten him. Dot recognised him straight away, and fell in with the deception for fear that her honest but clumsy husband might accidentally tip-off Tackleton, allowing him to wed May quickly before anybody had a chance to prevent him. Now, all is revealed and Edward marries May himself. Dot has never been unfaithful to John, and she reminds him that she loves him with all her heart.

Initially peeved at having missed the opportunity to marry May, Tackleton relents and sends gifts to the happy couple. That evening he joins the wedding dance, and the cricket on the hearth joins in with its own chirps.

==Background==
In July 1845, Dickens contemplated forming a periodical focusing on the concerns of the home. It was to be called &quot;The Cricket&quot;, but the plan fell through, and he transformed his idea into a Christmas book in which he abandoned social criticism, current events, and topical themes in favour of simple fantasy and a domestic setting for his hero&#x27;s redemption, though some have criticised this notion. The book was released on 20 December 1845 (the title page read &quot;1846&quot;) and sold briskly into the New Year. Seventeen stage productions opened during the Christmas season 1845 with one production receiving Dickens&#x27;s approval and opening on the same day as the book&#x27;s release. Dickens read the tale four times in public performance. It has been dramatised in numerous languages and for years was more popular on stage than &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. &quot;Cricket&quot; is less explicitly Christian than some of Dickens&#x27;s other Christmas books, and it has been criticised for its sentimentality, but contemporary readers were attracted to its depiction of the Victorian ideal of the happy home.

== Literary significance and criticism ==
The book was a huge commercial success, quickly going through two editions. Reviews were favourable, but not all so. In an unsigned piece in &quot;The Times&quot; the reviewer opined, &quot;We owe it to literature to protest against this last production of Mr. Dickens [...] Shades of Fielding and Scott! Is it for such jargon as this that we have given your throne to one who cannot estimate his eminence?&quot; However, William Makepeace Thackeray enjoyed the book immensely: &quot;To us, it appears it is a good Christmas book, illuminated with extra gas, crammed with extra bonbons, French plums and sweetness [...] This story is no more a real story than Peerybingle is a real name!&quot;

Dickens&#x27;s portrayal of the blind girl Bertha is significant. Victorians believed disabilities were inherited, and thus it was not socially acceptable for the blind to marry (although they often did in reality). In fictional courtship plots, the blind were often used to build tension since it was assumed they must be kept from marrying. The fictional portrayal of Bertha is similar to Dickens&#x27;s description in &quot;American Notes&quot; (1842) of the deaf and blind girl Laura Bridgman, whom he saw on a visit to the Perkins Institution for the Blind in Boston, Massachusetts.

Modern scholars have given the story little attention, but Andrew Sangers has argued it contains similarities to Shakespeare&#x27;s comedies and should be seen &quot;both as a significant indication of the tastes of the 1840s and of Dickens himself.&quot;

Vladimir Lenin left during a performance of the &quot;Cricket&quot; play in Russia, as he found it dull and the saccharine sentimentality got on his nerves. This incident might be little remembered if George Orwell had not mentioned it in his essay on Dickens.

==Adaptations==

Stage adaptations include the successful &quot;The Cricket on the Hearth&quot; by Albert Richard Smith produced at the Surrey Theatre in 1845, and Dion Boucicault&#x27;s &quot;Dot, A Drama in Three Acts&quot; (or simply &quot;Dot&quot;), first performed at New York&#x27;s Winter Garden in 1859. It was staged repeatedly in Britain and America for the remainder of the 19th century, starring, at times, John Toole, Henry Irving, and Jean Davenport. The play helped launch the career of American actor Joseph Jefferson (1829–1905).

The novella was the basis for at least two operas: Karl Goldmark&#x27;s &quot;Das Heimchem am Herd&quot; with a libretto by A. M. Willner (premiere: June 1896, Berlin; New York 1910), and Riccardo Zandonai&#x27;s &quot;Il grillo del focolare&quot; with a libretto by Cesare Hanau (premiere: November 1908, Turin). Goldmark&#x27;s opera was performed in Philadelphia in November 1912 with the Cricket sung by American soprano Mabel Riegelman (1889, Cincinnati – 1967, Burlingame, California).

Film, radio, and television adaptations include three American silent film versions: one, directed by D.W. Griffith (1909) starring Owen Moore, another directed by L. Marston (1914) starring Alan Hale, and one directed by Lorimer Johnston (1923). A silent Russian version, &quot;Sverchok na Pechi&quot; (1915) was directed by Boris Sushkevich and Aleksandr Uralsky and starred Maria Ouspenskaya. A silent French version, &quot;Le Grillon du Foyer&quot; (1922), was directed and adapted by Jean Manoussi and starred Charles Boyer as Edouard. A 25-minute NBC radio play adaptation aired on 24 December 1945.

In 1967, Rankin/Bass Productions produced a 50-minute animated television adaptation of the story for NBC. Told in the Cricket&#x27;s own words, it featured the voices of Roddy MacDowall as the Cricket, and father and daughter Danny Thomas and Marlo Thomas as Caleb and Bertha, with various other characters voiced by Paul Frees and Hans Conried. This adaptation cuts several characters, including the central pair of John and Dot, focusing solely on Caleb and Bertha. Television Corporation of Japan (now Eiken) provided the animation for the special, while its seven original songs were written and composed by Maury Laws and Jules Bass. Rankin/Bass later produced their adaptations of Dickens&#x27;s other holiday stories for television: &quot;A Christmas Tree&quot; (1850) as the ninth episode of their 1972–73 syndicated television series, &quot;Festival of Family Classics&quot;, and &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1843) as the 1978 animated remake of the 1956 live action musical special, &quot;The Stingiest Man in Town&quot;.

<text>Dragon Fli Empire (abbreviated DFE) is a Canadian hip hop duo formed in 2002 from Calgary, comprising Tarik Robinson, also known as Teekay (MC/producer), and Adam Hicks, also known as DJ Cosm (DJ/producer).

DFE&#x27;s first album, &quot;Conquest&quot;, was released in August 2004. It was followed by &quot;Invasion&quot; in 2005, &quot;Intermission EP&quot; in 2008 and &quot;Redefine&quot; in 2009. Their music is inspired by classic hip hop beats like those of Pete Rock, Large Professor and Prince Paul.

==History==
Dragon Fli Empire formed in May 2002. They released the original version of their debut album &quot;Conquest&quot; locally in the summer of 2002 as a limited edition CD-R.

The song &quot;Mount Pleasant&quot;, a track about observations while riding Calgary Transit received airplay on CJSW-FM, CKUA and CBC Radio 3. An official version of &quot;Conquest&quot; was pressed and independently released in August 2004. The album was re-mastered and three tracks from the CD-R version were replaced with newer ones, including the DFE theme song &quot;D-E-F&quot;.

Their second album, &quot;Invasion&quot;, was independently released in May 2005. Reaching number five on the &quot;!earshot&quot; Canadian campus radio charts, it showcased a progression in the group&#x27;s sound, and featured the tracks &quot;Headphones&quot;, &quot;Our Way&quot;, &quot;Invasion&quot; and &quot;Tight Spot&quot;. The group collaborated with several other Canadian indie hip hop artists on the album, including Ndidi Cascade, More or Les, Epic, Mindbender and Touch and Nato plus live musicians like Kirby Small and Tariq.

In 2007, an album featuring tracks from &quot;Invasion&quot; and &quot;Conquest&quot; (&quot;Inquest&quot;) was released in Japan through P-Vine Records. The same year, a 12&quot; vinyl release of the &quot;Invasion&quot; song &quot;Roc the Crowd&quot; featuring Ohmega Watts was released worldwide on Calgary-based label Bigfoot Records.

DFE released an EP entitled &quot;Intermission&quot; in May 2008 prior to their third full-length album &quot;Redefine&quot;. The EP reached number three on the &quot;!earshot&quot; and &quot;Chart Attack&quot; hip hop charts. &quot;Intermission&quot; also reached number three on &quot;The R3-30&quot; on CBC Radio 3. Two tracks from &quot;Intermission&quot; were nominated for Radio 3&#x27;s 2008 Bucky Awards.

The group&#x27;s third full-length album, &quot;Redefine&quot; released in Japan on P-Vine Records in October 2008 and in North America on Makebelieve Records in January 2009. &quot;Redefine&quot; featured collaborations with a number of high-profile artists including Cadence Weapon, Masta Ace, Ohmega Watts, Josh Martinez, Moka Only and Raashan Ahmad. It reached number one for two weeks on the &quot;!earshot&quot; and &quot;Chart Attack&quot; hip hop charts, and was number three for several weeks on the &quot;CMJ&quot; hip hop charts.

<text>Salt Lake 2002 is the official video game of the XIX Olympic Winter Games, hosted by Salt Lake City, Utah, United States in 2002. Developed by Attention to Detail and published by Eidos Interactive (DC Studios/Ubi Soft for the Game Boy Advance version), it was released for Windows, PlayStation 2 and Game Boy Advance. An Xbox version was also planned but cancelled.

==Competition==
There are four game modes: Olympic, Tournament, Classic and Time Trial. The Olympic Mode returns to the simplistic direct-to-competition mode, unlike Sydney 2000 that forced the player to qualify for the Olympics. Each players&#x27; victories are logged, and trophies/medals can be seen in a trophy room. Gameplay-wise, the events are unevenly done. While the downhill/slalom events are reasonably simulated and playable (one can play downhill in first person view, and at easier levels missing a gate in the slalom does not disqualify the player), in ski jump and bobsleigh results are generally hard to predict or control.

==Playable nations==

There is a total of 16 playable countries in the game. They are:
==Events==
*Men&#x27;s Alpine Skiing Downhill
*Women&#x27;s Alpine Skiing Slalom
*Women&#x27;s Freestyle Skiing Aerials
*Men&#x27;s Ski Jump K120 Individual
*Men&#x27;s Two-man Bobsleigh
*Men&#x27;s Snowboard Parallel Giant Slalom
*Curling

==Reception==
The Game Boy Advance version of &quot;Salt Lake 2002&quot; received &quot;mixed&quot; reviews, while the PC and PlayStation 2 versions received &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, where the PS2 version was ported for release on 28 February 2002, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 25 out of 40.

<doc id="1282443" wikidata="Q3856213" url="?curid=1282443" title="Michael Lupo">
<text>Michele del Marco Lupo (19 January 1953 – 12 February 1995) was a serial killer originally from Italy, who was active in the UK. His most notable role was as branch manager at Yves Saint Laurent boutique in Brompton Road, London during the 1980s.

== History ==

=== James George Burns ===
On 16th March 1986, the body of 37-year-old James Burns was found strangled and partially clothed in the derelict basement of 32 Warwick Road, Kensington, London. Burns was a British rail train guard and worked at London&#x27;s Liverpool Street station. The investigation made little progress because there was no obvious link between a perpetrator and the dead man. Although two witnesses came forward confirming James spent the day drinking and ended up meeting Lupo at The Coleherne Pub in Earls Court. Burns and Lupo were seen leaving together and getting into a taxi outside the pub.

=== Kevin McDonagh (Survived) ===
After appeals made by the police and celebrities like Kenny Everett regarding the murder of James Burns, 31-year-old Kevin McDonagh came forward to say he had been attacked the week prior in the same basement of Warwick Road. He too had met a man, later identified as Lupo, in the Coleherne Pub, Earls Court. They left together and made their way to the basement flat. Kevin recalled Lupo showed no emotion on the brief walk. Once inside Kevin was beaten until he passed out. He woke an hour later to find all his clothing intact. He stumbled out of the basement and bumped into two police constables. Looking back the constables said they assumed he was &#x27;just another Irish drunk&#x27; but little did they know Kevin was the first known victim of Lupo, although he survived.

Kevin died in September 2000 at the Mildamay Mission Hospital from an AIDS-related illness.

=== Anthony Conolly ===
On 6 April that year, the body of Anthony Conolly, 24, was found in a railway hut on the London Catford Loop by Ferndale Road, Brixton. He had been strangled with his own scarf. Conolly was sharing a flat with a man named Simon Walder who was HIV positive. Walder sharing his status with the pathologist upon formally identifying Conolly&#x27;s body then saw a long delay between the discovery of the body and the post mortem. This was due to mortuary and pathology staff refusing to handle Conolly&#x27;s body without first being tested for HIV/AIDS. The Metropolitan police felt there was no need but finally relented and the test came back negative.

Conolly had left his flat on the night of 5th April 1986 and took the short walk to the Prince of Wales pub on Coldharbour Lane, Brixton. He wore a sweater, with his trademark leather jacket embellished with silver studs, and severely distressed jeans with &quot;shocking pink tights underneath&quot;. While also wearing his trademark scarf it was the tights that gained most attention throughout the evening, including the doorman who recalled Conolly left around 1 am. Nobody witnessed Lupo and Conolly meeting but they must have encountered each other shortly after Conolly left the Prince of Wales, Brixton.

Lupo confessed to strangling Conolly with the scarf he was wearing before leaving the body and taking a taxi to a nightclub where he danced until 3 am.

=== Unknown Male ===
A vagrant male, around 60 years old was found dead on Hungerford Bridge in the early hours of 18th April 1986. A post mortem showed the man had been strangled but despite various appeals and canvassing the man was never identified. It was understood he most likely lived in and around the Arches of Charing Cross known as cardboard city. 

Upon Lupo&#x27;s arrest, he informed police that he had killed the unknown man. Lupo told police he had left Heaven nightclub and crossing Hungerford Bridge the man asked Lupo for a cigarette. Lupo gave the man the one he was already smoking. In his statement to police Lupo said he could not explain why, but he had this urge to kill the man and thus strangled him with the tartan scarf the unknown man was wearing. Police documented the body had been dragged around 15 feet along the bridge.

=== Mark Leyland (Survived) ===
Less than 24 hours later Lupo not only struck again but was in the very same area of Villiers Street, Charing Cross by Heaven nightclub. This time Lupo bumped into 22-year-old Mark Leyland who was exploring his sexuality and understood men cruised for sex around the area. Mark told Lupo his name was Marco before he followed Lupo down a side street near Hungerford Lane. Mark in his police statement shared he started to perform oral sex on Lupo when he just got the feeling something wasn&#x27;t right and stopped. Lupo then started to punch Mark in the head repeatedly before fleeing through a window of the abandoned room.

Minutes later Lupo had returned with a large piece of wood and was prodding Mark with it through the window before he started to hit Mark on the head until he passed out. When Mark woke, he staggered onto Hungerford Lane, collapsed and was found by a constable on his beat. Mark reported the incident as a vicious mugging.

Mark came forward again when he saw and heard of Lupo&#x27;s arrest. Mark gave evidence and Lupo was charged and convicted of attempted murder on Mark.

=== Damien Michael McCloskey ===
Damien McCloskey was originally from Londonderry, Northern Ireland and was 22 years old when in the early hours of 25th April 1986 he left Copacabana, Earls Court around 2 am. Making his way back to the Philbeach Hotel where he worked as a receptionist and occasionally bunked down for the night, he bumped into Lupo on Earls Court Road. Lupo later told police the pair walked back up Earls Court Road and entered the derelict basement of 150 Cromwell Road. As McCloskey fellated Lupo, he pulled a sheet off a nearby trolley and placing it around McCloskey&#x27;s neck strangled him. McCloskey was not found until after Lupo&#x27;s arrest and only on Lupo directing police to the body.

=== David Nigel Cole (Survived) ===
In the early hours of 8th May 1985, 30-year-old David Cole left his flat for cigarettes and a bite to eat. He walked over to the Market Tavern, Vauxhall and saw two men exit the pub and slip down the side of the building. One man left and Cole approached the man and he said they were mutually attracted. Cole then walked off with Lupo down Wyril Road to a lorry park. Cole told police in his statement that Lupo was unable to maintain an erection so Cole crouched down to fellate Lupo. He recalled he felt something around his neck and as it tightened he managed, after a struggle to get his hand under the fabric wrapped around his neck and eventually broke free. Cold shouted for help and Lupo fled. Cole stated the fabric around his neck was a silk sock which had been too short to successfully strangle Cole.

Cole first approached the Gay Switchboard and he claimed they told Cole not to report the incident to the police given the mistrust between the police and the gay community.

Cole did eventually inform the police and on the 15th May 1986 at 22:15, Cole was accompanied by two undercover detectives and a backup unit outside as they went from pub to pub. They started at the Prince of Wales, Brixton and moved on before returning. Upon the second visit to the Prince of Wales, Brixton, Cole informed detectives he had spotted the man who had tried to strangle him, Lupo.

Cole approached Lupo and after briefly speaking Lupo was then arrested and first taken to Croydon police station where Lupo denied the offer of a lawyer and confessed to the murders. Cole later shared he had a breakdown.

==Trial and imprisonment==
On 15th May 1986, Michele del Marco Lupo was arrested and charged with the murders of Connolly and Burns along with the attempted murder of Cole. Lupo had been the branch manager at London&#x27;s Yves Saint Laurent between 1980-1984. Detectives never did establish why Lupo left such a privileged role to take a lesser-paid role at Tan Guidicelli with a salary of £14,000 pa. Then 18-months later Lupo took a Sales Assistant role at Stravaganza on Oxford Street with a salary of £12,000 pa. At the time of his arrest, detectives established Lupo had been fired from Stravaganza only weeks earlier. 

Lupo was originally from the village of Monte Donato, Bologna, Italy and had completed his national service in the Italian Bersaglieri, 22nd unit before coming to London in 1974. 

The British tabloid press once or twice tried to dub Lupo &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; (&quot;lupo&quot; means &quot;wolf&quot; in Italian) but it never stuck or took off. He was occasionally referred to as the &#x27;Silk Strangler&#x27; or &#x27;Gay Executioner&#x27; but these never stuck nor took off. And while many gay men of the time recall the murders, Lupo and his crimes never really gained notoriety.

On 21st May, Lupo was charged with two other recent killings, those of hotel receptionist Damien McCloskey, who had been strangled in West London, and an unidentified man, who was murdered near Hungerford Bridge over the Thames. In addition to these four murders, Lupo was also charged with the attempted murder of Mark Leyland.

On 10th July 1987, at the Old Bailey, Lupo was sentenced to four life sentences, plus 14 years. Lupo had pleaded guilty to all charges. 

Lupo had been remanded in Brixton Prison and then Frankland Prison after sentencing. 

There were investigations in cities Lupo had visited in the early 1980s, such as New York City, Berlin and Los Angeles, to see if he was responsible for unsolved homicides in those locations, although no evidence of any further crimes committed by Lupo came to light.

=== AIDS and Death ===
On 12th February 1995, Lupo died in Frankland Prison, County Durham from AIDS. An AIDS death is always due to an AIDS-related complication but his death certificate merely states &quot;AIDS&quot; with no post-mortem to establish the actual cause of death. 

Detectives investigating believe Lupo&#x27;s HIV diagnosis had led to a &quot;callous rationale&quot; and an &quot;urge to kill&quot; in an act of revenge. However, Lupo denied this given he stated he too only learned of his HIV diagnosis upon entering custody after his arrest whereby in 1986 compulsory AIDS testing was underway given the spread of AIDS in UK Prisons. Detectives also conceded that this theory was too neat and further, there was no record of Lupo having undertaken an HIV test prior to his arrest. Lupo maintained his motive for killing was his feeling of being abused by friends and society and not AIDS.

He spent the last years of his life in a prison hospital.

<doc id="1282448" wikidata="Q175822" url="?curid=1282448" title="Igor Olshansky">
<text>Igor Olshansky (; born 3 May 1982) is a former professional football player who was a defensive end in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Oregon and was selected by the San Diego Chargers in the second round of the 2004 NFL draft. He also played for the Dallas Cowboys and Miami Dolphins.

He is the first Ukrainian to play in the NFL, and the first born in the Soviet Union to do so.

==Early life==
Olshansky was born in the industrial city of Dnipropetrovsk, Ukrainian SSR (now Ukraine). His father Yury had played basketball for the Red Army. Shortly before the break-up of the Soviet Union, he and his family moved to San Francisco in 1989, when he was seven years old. His maternal grandfather, Abraham Rubshevsky, served in the Red Army during World War II and was wounded 11 times.

Olshansky is Jewish and he acknowledged that, &quot;It&#x27;s who I am; my culture; my roots&quot;. During his youth he attended the Lisa Kampner Hebrew Academy in San Francisco, headed by Rabbi Pinchos Lipner, an Orthodox Jewish day school. He then attended St. Ignatius College Preparatory on a basketball scholarship, and – already 6&#x27; 5&quot; in the 10th grade – played basketball for the school until his junior year, while concurrently playing basketball in the Maccabiah Games in St. Louis and Milwaukee. After two years, he also began playing football in his junior year in high school.

==College career==
At the University of Oregon, where he majored in psychology, Olshansky was honorable mention academic All-Pac-10 in his freshman year, and picked for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;″s All-Bowl Game team at the end of the season. He was honorable mention All-Pac-10 as a sophomore, second-team All-Pac-10 as a junior, and recipient of the Joe Schaffeld Trophy as the Ducks&#x27; top defensive lineman after both his sophomore and junior seasons. He was used at all defensive line positions.

In his career at Oregon he had 146 tackles (89 solos), 11.5 sacks, 3 blocked kicks, and one 37-yard interception return in 38 games. Olshansky left school following his junior season, with one year of eligibility remaining.

He set a team record with a 505-pound bench press, and also holds team records in the clean and jerk and squat.

==Professional career==

===2004 NFL Combine===
In early try-outs for the draft, he bench-pressed 102.1 kilograms (225 lbs) 41 times on one try, two presses short of the rookie record. He ran the 40-yard dash in 4.9 seconds and jumped 33.5 inches from a stationary position. A National Football Conference scouting director observed: &quot;He can play both end and tackle, he can control the point and rush the passer, he&#x27;s a very good athlete.&quot;

===San Diego Chargers===
In the second round (35th overall) of the 2004 NFL draft, the San Diego Chargers selected Olshansky out of the University of Oregon. In August 2004, Olshansky and the Chargers agreed on a 6-year contract, with the final year being voidable. The contract called for a $2.25 million signing bonus and had a value of $5.2 million over five years, through the 2008 NFL season. He became the NFL&#x27;s first Soviet-born player.

In his rookie season in 2004, he started all 16 of the team&#x27;s games.

Olshansky was ejected from a game against the Denver Broncos on 19 November 2006. He punched Broncos center Tom Nalen after what appeared to be Nalen trying to cut block Olshansky on a clock-stopping spike play. Olshansky had recently had knee surgery when Nalen went after Olshansky&#x27;s knees. Two days later, the NFL fined Nalen $25,000 for the cut block, more than double the $10,000 fine Olshansky received for the punch.

With the Chargers, he had 151 tackles and 11 sacks in 75 games, starting all but 5 of them.

===Dallas Cowboys===
Olshansky signed a four-year contract with the Dallas Cowboys on 6 March 2009. The deal was worth $18 million, with $8 million of it guaranteed. He finished the season with 76 tackles (seventh on the team), 2 tackles for loss, 1.5 sacks, 12 quarterback pressures and 3 passes defensed.

In 2010, he started 14 games, registering 38 tackles (tenth on the team), one tackle for loss, 4 quarterback pressures and 2 passes defensed. He was released on 3 September 2011.

===Miami Dolphins===
Olshansky was signed by the Miami Dolphins on 20 September 2011. He was waived on 30 November.

===NFL statistics===
==Personal life==

He has many tattoos, including two Stars of David on his neck. He is regularly featured in Jewish news publications.

Olshansky is married to Liya Rubinshteyn, whom he met at the Lisa Kampner Hebrew Academy in San Francisco. They live in San Rafael, CA and have two sons.

He was detained on Thursday, 1 December 2011, for marijuana possession as part of an undercover bust that resulted in 280 arrests. The Broward County Sheriff&#x27;s Office went to Olshansky&#x27;s condo in Fort Lauderdale to investigate Olshansky&#x27;s friend, but ended up detaining both men. He was never charged with possession of 19 grams of marijuana.

<text>I. C. Massim (or Ioan C. Massimu; 1825–1877) was a Romanian linguist and a founding member of the Romanian Academy. I. C. Massim was born Ion Floricel in the village of Gropeni, near the Danube port of Brăila as the son of a country priest. He changed his name to Maxim, derived from the name of his birthplace, and signed his books as I. C. Massimu. The crowning achievement of Massim&#x27;s linguistic career was the 1875 publication, together with August Treboniu Laurian, of the first complete dictionary of the Romanian language, a monumental work that included two volumes of words of Latin origin and a comprehensive glossary of words &quot;of foreign, dubious or unknown origin&quot;.

<doc id="1282465" wikidata="Q1679922" url="?curid=1282465" title="Handline fishing">
<text>Handline fishing, or handlining, is a fishing technique where a single fishing line is held in the hands, rather than with a fishing rod like the usual angling, of which handlining is a subtype. Handlining is not to be confused with handfishing, which is catching fish by hand. When handlining, one or more fishing lures or baited hooks are attached to the line, and a fishing lure and often a weight and/or a fishing float can also be attached to the line. Handlining is among the oldest forms of fishing and is still practiced throughout the world today.
The fishing bait can be still fished, trolled or jigged up and down in a series of short movements. Often handling is done close to the bottom of the body of water but can also be done near or on the surface.

==Salt water handlining==
Ocean handlining is often used to catch groundfish and squid but other species are sometimes caught, including pelagic fish. Sea handlining is a good way to catch larger oceanic fish.

==Freshwater handlining==
Handlining is also used for catching fresh water fish. Panfish, walleyes, and other freshwater game fish can be caught using handlining fishing techniques. Handlining can be practiced from the shore or from a fishing boat. Walleye anglers practice handlining over moderately deep water in a drifting boat. Handlining is also practiced by ice fishing anglers.

==Techniques==
A jigging motion can be used to attract fish which are normally caught while trying to strike the lure but they can also be snagged by the hooks as they investigate the jigged lure. The lure can also be fished motionless and the angler feels for the bait to be picked up by a fish and then sets the hook after waiting for the fish to fully take the bait. After a strike occurs the hook is set and then the fish is hauled in and the caught fish is removed.

<doc id="1282466" wikidata="Q6027219" url="?curid=1282466" title="Induced innovation">
<text>Induced innovation is a microeconomic hypothesis first proposed in 1932 by John Hicks in his work &quot;The Theory of Wages&quot;. He proposed that &quot;a change in the relative prices of the factors of production is itself a spur to invention, and to invention of a particular kind—directed to economizing the use of a factor which has become relatively expensive.&quot;

Considerable literature has been produced on this hypothesis, which is often presented in terms of the effects of wage increases as an encouragement to labor-saving innovation. The hypothesis has also been applied to viewing increases in energy costs as a motivation for a more rapid improvement in energy efficiency of goods than would normally occur.

== Induced innovation in climate change ==

A significant application of Hicks&#x27;s theory can be found in the field of climate change. The exponential population growth occurred in the last century has drastically increased pressure on natural resources. In order to have a sustainable future it is imperative to modify global strategies on climate change and the induced innovation theory can aid to model these policies.

To calculate the human impact on the environment economists often use the I=P*A*T equation where “I”, the impact variable, (for example energy consumption) is the product of “P”, the population, “A” the affluence (often embodied by GDP per capita) and “T” the technology.

The technical coefficient represents the efficiency of the system in use for particular resource and expresses the average state of technology. The decrease of &quot;T&quot; would indicate a gain in efficiency however “I” could still be growing or remaining stable if the improved technology is not sufficient to compensate the effect of an increase in &quot;P&quot; and &quot;A&quot;. Therefore, a reduction in “I” would always mean that pressure on resources has lightened but this might not always be the consequence of using resources more efficiently (reducing T).

A fundamental issue of climate change is the excess of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere particularly as the result of an intensified economic activity. Global GDP and emissions were growing at a corresponding rate in the until the 1970s. It was then that oil prices have increased greatly causing people to reduce its consumption.

According to Hicks&#x27;s theory a change in factor prices will stimulate development of technical innovation to reduce the use of the factor for which the price increased compared to other factors. Following the oil shock significant investments were made in alternative sources of energy, more efficient cars and heating systems to mitigate oil consumption. As a result, emissions started growing at a slower rate than GDP per capita. Although petrol prices then dropped in the 1980s, emissions have continued to grow more slowly than GDP. This is an indication of a complete structural change in technology induced by the need to innovate.

== Induced innovation in agriculture ==

The development of agriculture is a fundamental part of the world economic growth. Being able to meet the demand of an exponentially growing population can be a challenging task, especially if we consider that one of the most important factors, land, remains fairly fixed.

According to the World Bank data, less than 38% of the global surface area can be deemed usable for cultivation of crops or permanent pastures.

Expanding such a number can only be achieved by remediation of soil in a certain area in order to make the land fertile. Such an intervention requires a huge investment that can be amortized only in a long period of time. Therefore, to meet the increasing demand, countries are forced to drastically increase the productivity of the land they dispose. This is where induced innovation steps in.

In order to best explain how Hicks’s theory works, consider a situation in which the demand for agricultural derived products increases as a result of either population growth or increased household income. Theory states that in such a situation, prices of inputs for which supply is inelastic will rise relative to prices of more elastic inputs. Similarly, if the supply of a particular input increases at a
faster rate than the supply of other inputs, the price of such input will decline relative to the price of the other factors of production used. Ideally then, farmers would be looking to replace or use less of the more inelastic and less responsive factors of production since they are the more expensive to use. Therefore, technical innovations that replace such inputs would guarantee less costs and hence more profits. In other words, when demand for their products increases, farmers are lured by changes in relative prices to seek for technological alternatives that substitute the increasingly scarce factors of production.

Here is where government intervention would be beneficial. Agricultural workers cannot develop these innovations themselves and therefore demand that public research institutions develop new technologies that will then be transformed into modernized machinery that agricultural supply firms can sell to local farmers. Scientists will now study the best solution to this problem and respond by making the appropriate technical development such that producers can efficiently substitute the abundant inputs for the
increasingly scarce factors. Ultimately this will lead to a reduction of farmer’s unit costs in the best way.

<text>Fred Stark Pearson (July 3, 1861 – May 7, 1915) was an American electrical engineer and entrepreneur.

==Biography==
Pearson was the son of Ambrose and Hannah (Edgerly) Pearson. He graduated from Tufts University in 1883 with an A.M.B. and received an A.M.M. degree one year later. Previously, for one year (1879–80), he was instructor in chemistry in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; later (1883–86), he was instructor in mathematics and applied mechanics at Tufts College. From college, he went on to develop the electric transportation system in Boston and, with electric powered streetcars of major importance, in 1894 he was appointed the head engineer for Metropolitan Street Railways in New York City. Pearson built a reputation as an innovative electrical engineer in the United States and he was soon contracted by governments and businesses as a consulting engineer for power generating stations throughout North America. A man with great business skills and a foresight, with ready financial backers he undertook major projects in North and South America. He was the Founder of Barcelona Traction and São Paulo Tramway, Light and Power Company which is now Brookfield Asset Management.

While in Canada, he developed a relationship with a bright and aggressive young lawyer/stockbroker in Montreal, Quebec by the name of James Dunn. Pearson encouraged Dunn to take up residency in London, at the time the most important financial market in the world.

With Dunn&#x27;s brokerage house underwriting his ventures share offerings, sufficient capital was raised to allow Pearson to create a massive business empire that included the São Paulo Tramway, Light and Power Company in Brazil, the Mexican North Western Railway, the Mexican Tramway Company, and the Mexican Light and Power Company in Mexico, and the British American Nickel Company in Canada.

Unstable governments in Mexico along with rampant bribery and corruption of public officials caused Pearson considerable grief. The government of president Venustiano Carranza nationalized his Mexican Tramway Company and in the end, he lost virtually everything he had invested in Mexico. During this time, he was behind the 1911 construction of the Medina Dam on the Medina River in what is now Mico, Texas and built an irrigation district encompassing more than 34,000 acres (138 km2). The town of Pearson, Texas was named in his honor.

In 1912, he organized a syndicate in Hale County, Texas near Plainview for drilling irrigation wells to irrigate about 60,000 acres (243 km2). During the course of his work in Texas, Pearson founded the town of Natalia, naming it after his daughter, Natalie Pearson Nicholson.

In 1913, he negotiated a deal with the Spanish government for a hydro project on the Ebro River and formed the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company to carry out the construction that was completed in 1915. However, World War I limited his activity.

He and his wife, Mabel Ward Pearson, lost their lives on May 7, 1915, while travelling to England on business and to visit his daughter Natalie who was then living there. They were on the ocean liner when it was torpedoed off the southern coast of Ireland by German U-boat . They are interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

Pearson Hall, home of the Chemistry Department at Tufts University, is named for him.

<doc id="1282496" wikidata="Q3665589" url="?curid=1282496" title="Baumkuchen">
<text>Baumkuchen () is a kind of spit cake from German cuisine. It is also a popular dessert in Japan. The characteristic rings that appear in its slices resemble tree rings, and give the cake its German name, &quot;Baumkuchen&quot;, which literally translates to &quot;tree cake&quot; or &quot;log cake&quot;.

==History==
It is disputed who made the first Baumkuchen and where it was first baked. One theory is that it was invented in the German town of Salzwedel, which is further popularized by the town itself. Another theory suggests it began as a Hungarian wedding cake. In &quot;Ein neues Kochbuch&quot; (lit. &quot;A New Cookbook&quot;), the first cookbook written for professional chefs by Marx Rumpolt, there is a recipe for Baumkuchen. This publication puts the origin of Baumkuchen as far back at 1581, the year the cookbook was first published. Marx Rumpolt had previously worked as a chef in Hungary and Bohemia.

==Characteristics==

Traditionally, Baumkuchen is made on a spit by brushing on even layers of batter and then rotating the spit around a heat source. Each layer is allowed to brown before a new layer of batter is poured. When the cake is removed and sliced, each layer is divided from the next by a golden line, resembling the growth rings in a tree cross-section. A typical Baumkuchen is made up of 15 to 20 layers of batter. However, the layering process for making Baumkuchen can continue until the cakes are quite large. Skilled pastry chefs have been known to create cakes with 25 layers and weighing over . When cooked on a spit, it is not uncommon for a finished Baumkuchen to be tall.

Baumkuchen ingredients are typically butter, eggs, sugar, vanilla, salt, and flour. Baking powder is not considered a traditional ingredient. The ratio of flour, butter and eggs is typically 1:1:2 respectively (i.e., 100 grams of flour, 100 grams of butter and 200 grams of eggs). The recipe can be varied by adding other ingredients, such as ground nuts, honey, marzipan, nougat and rum or brandy, to the batter or filling. Additionally, Baumkuchen may be covered with sugar or chocolate glaze. With some recipes, the fully baked and cooled Baumkuchen is first coated with marmalade or jam, and then covered with chocolate.

==Variations==

&quot;Baumkuchenspitzen&quot;, German for &quot;Tree Cake Peaks&quot;, are miniature versions of Baumkuchen; for these, the slices of the whole cake are cut into small pieces that are then typically coated in chocolate and packaged.

A simpler horizontally layered version of the cake called a &quot;Schichttorte&quot; also exists. It is baked without a spit and thus does not have circular rings but horizontal layers. The horizontally layered version results in a Baumkuchen that is more similar in shape to conventional cakes. It can also be baked in a conventional household oven that has a broiler inside, whereas the traditional spit version requires special equipment normally not available in an average household. However, unlike with the spit variant, the Schichttorte cross section is less reminiscent of tree rings.

==Baumkuchen in Japan==
Baumkuchen is one of the most popular cakes in Japan, where it is called . It is a popular return present in Japan for wedding guests because of its ring shape, similar to the symbol of the Zen Ensō which symbolises good luck.

It was first introduced to Japan by the German Karl Joseph Wilhelm Juchheim. Juchheim was in the Chinese city of Qingdao during World War I, and British and Japanese forces began the Siege of Qingdao. Karl served as a private in the Landsturm. After the fall of Qingdao, Karl was sent to prisoner-of-war camps in Japan. After the war, Juchheim started making and selling the traditional confection at a German exhibition in Hiroshima in 1919. He might have baked Japan&#x27;s first Baumkuchen before the exhibition on Ninoshima. Continued success allowed him to move to Yokohama and open a bakery-store, but it was destroyed in the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, thus forcing him to move his operations to Kobe, where he stayed until the end of World War II. Some years later, his wife returned to help a Japanese company open a chain of bakeries under the Juchheim name that further helped spread Baumkuchen&#x27;s popularity in Japan and is still in operation.

<text>As/Is is a live album by John Mayer, released October 19, 2004, available for download from iTunes and also available as a double-CD release. The albums were released from live concert performances across the United States from the tour following the release of Mayer&#x27;s second album, &quot;Heavier Things&quot;. The recordings include five albums-worth of material as sold on iTunes. As of July 2009, the four concert-specific albums were still available on iTunes in the United States, though Volume One is no longer available; Each album has its own artwork. A two-disc compilation was released physically and digitally which features the &quot;best&quot; of the iTunes series, plus an additional song, &quot;Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)&quot;, a Marvin Gaye cover. In &quot;Inner City Blues&quot;, Mayer called upon DJ Logic, the support act of the &quot;Heavier Things&quot; tour, to join him to perform a turntable solo.

==Performing band==
The songs all feature Mayer&#x27;s touring band of the time:

* John Mayer – guitar and vocals
* David LaBruyere – bass guitar
* David Ryan Harris – guitar and backing vocals
* JJ Johnson – drums and percussion
* Michael Chaves – guitar &amp; vocals
* Eric Jacobson – trumpet and dented flugelhorn 
* Chris Karlic – saxophone and flute
* Kevin Lovejoy – keyboards

==Cover art for the series==
 Volume one features a cut-out silhouette version of Mayer (from the cover of &quot;Heavier Things&quot;) with two tones of blue. As it is separate from the other volumes, its artwork is rather distinct from the rest.

Artwork for the covers of volumes two, three, four, and five is by the artist Kozyndan. They feature bunnies in out-of-character situations on their covers, including hanging from helium balloons (two) and in washing machines (three). The bunnies on the cover of four begin as amoeba and diagonally evolve into bunnies. The cover of volume five has several bunnies with their midsections replaced with springs.

The CD release continued the use of bunnies, using the artwork &#x27;Uprisings&#x27; by Kozyndan, which has hundreds of bunnies in formation to appear like revered Japanese artwork &quot;The Great Wave off Kanagawa&quot;. The artwork was originally created as a cover for issue 28 of the magazine &quot;Giant Robot&quot;. Notably, the CD is considered volume six (the last) of the series, and &quot;The Great Wave&quot; woodblock printing is the first of a 36-part series of art.

<text>The Kessock Bridge () carries the A9 trunk road across the Beauly Firth at Inverness, Scotland.

==Description==
The Kessock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge across the Beauly Firth, an inlet of the Moray Firth, between the village of North Kessock and the city of Inverness in the Scottish Highlands.

The bridge has a total length of with a main span of . Designed by German engineer and built by Cleveland Bridge, it is similar to a bridge across the Rhine between Rees and Kalkar. The Beauly Firth is a navigable waterway and hence the bridge is raised high over sea level. The four bridge towers dominate the Inverness skyline, especially at night when they are lit.

The bridge carries the A9 trunk road north from Inverness to the Black Isle. It is the southernmost of the &quot;Three Firths&quot; crossings (Beauly, Cromarty and Dornoch) which has transformed road transport in the Highlands. It has proved a key factor in the growth of the city of Inverness.

To protect against any potential seismic activity of the Great Glen Fault, the bridge includes seismic buffers in its construction. These buffers are at the north abutment, nearly over the line of the fault, and they supplement longitudinal restraint at Pier 7, the south main pier. Each buffer is just over long and weighs about .

On the south side of the bridge is the Caledonian Stadium, home of Inverness Caledonian Thistle.

==Incidents==
The bridge has been the focus of mental health concerns in recent years involving people at serious risk of harm and potential suicides. In 2022 police were called to 203 such incidents, the highest in five years. Fewer callouts to any previous incidents had happened in years before that; 120 occurred in 2021, 69 in 2020, 85 in 2019 and 78 in 2018. The incidents have caused the bridge to be closed many times with traffic becoming heavy whilst they divert through local routes such as through Beauly. There have been calls for safety improvements to the bridge to prevent incidents.

==History==
Prior to August 1982, travellers north of Inverness had the choice of the Kessock Ferry or a 20 mile journey via Beauly. Cleveland Bridge were awarded the £17.5million contract in 1975 (). Construction on the bridge began in 1978, with completion and opening in 1982. It won the combined design and construction Saltire Society 1982 Civil Engineering Award in 1983.

Transport Scotland estimated in 2012 that 30,000 vehicles per day were using the bridge.

Since 2007, the 25th anniversary of its opening, the Kessock Bridge has featured on the obverse of the £100 note issued by the Bank of Scotland. The series of notes commemorates Scottish engineering achievements with illustrations of bridges in Scotland such as the Glenfinnan Viaduct and the Forth Bridge.

The bridge&#x27;s northbound carriageway was resurfaced between February and June 2013, followed by the southbound carriageway between February and June 2014. Both programmes of work were performed by Stirling Lloyd Construction Limited using their &quot;Eliminator&quot; bridge deck waterproofing system in combination with Aeschlimann AG&#x27;s impermeable surfacing material. The new surface is guaranteed by the contractors for a period of 10 years, with a prediction that it will extend the life of the bridge by 10 to 20 years beyond that.

In 2019, the bridge was awarded a Category B listed status by Historic Environment Scotland.

<doc id="1282525" wikidata="Q3246268" url="?curid=1282525" title="Francisella">
<text>Francisella is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria. They are small coccobacillary or rod-shaped, nonmotile organisms, which are also facultative intracellular parasites of macrophages. Strict aerobes, &quot;Francisella&quot; colonies bear a morphological resemblance to those of the genus &quot;Brucella&quot;. Some &quot;Francisella&quot; species are pathogenic bacteria but some others are endosymbionts of ticks. Ticks do not use any other food source than vertebrate blood and therefore ingest high levels of protein, iron and salt, but few vitamins. To overcome these nutritional deficiencies, ticks have evolved obligate interactions with nutritional endosymbionts, including &quot;Francisella&quot; endosymbionts. Their experimental elimination typically results in decreased tick survival, molting, fecundity and egg viability, as well as in physical abnormalities, which all are fully restored with an oral supplement of B vitamins. The genome sequencing of &quot;Francisella&quot; endosymbionts confirmed that they consistently produce three B vitamin types, biotin (vitamin B7), riboflavin (B2) and folate (B9). &quot;Francisella&quot; endosymbionts are often misidentified as &quot;Francisella tularensis&quot;; however, &quot;Francisella&quot; endosymbionts lack virulence genes and cannot infect humans.

The genus was named in honor of American bacteriologist Edward Francis, who, in 1922, first recognized &quot;F. tularensis&quot; (then named &quot;Bacterium tularensis&quot;) as the causative agent of tularemia.

== Pathogenesis ==
The type species, &quot;F. tularensis&quot;, causes the disease tularemia or rabbit fever. &quot;F. novicida&quot; and &quot;F. philomiragia&quot; (previously &quot;Yersinia philomiragia&quot;) are associated with sepsis and invasive systemic infections.

Francisella has been detected in ticks 

== Taxonomy ==
The taxonomy of the genus is somewhat uncertain, especially in the case of &quot;F. novicida&quot; (may be a subspecies of &quot;F. tularensis&quot;). In general, identification of species is accomplished by biochemical profiling or 16S rRNA sequencing. An updated phylogeny based on whole genome sequencing has recently been published showing the genus &quot;Francisella&quot; could be divided into two main genetic clades: one including &quot;F. tularensis&quot;, &quot;F. novicida&quot; and &quot;F. hispaniensis&quot;, and another including &quot;F. philomiragia&quot; and &quot;F. noatunensis&quot;.

== Laboratory characteristics ==
&quot;Francisella&quot; species can survive for several weeks in the environment; paradoxically, they can be difficult to culture and maintain in the laboratory. Growth is slow (though increased by CO2 supplementation) and the organisms are fastidious, with most &quot;Francisella&quot; strains requiring cystine and cysteine media supplementation for growth. Growth has been successful on several media types, including chocolate agar and Thayer–Martin medium with appropriate additives as noted above. Attempted isolation on MacConkey agar is not reliable or generally successful.

After 24 hours of incubation on appropriate solid media, &quot;Francisella&quot; colonies are generally small (1 to 2 mm), opaque, and white-gray to bluish-gray in color. Colonies are smooth, with clean edges and, after a 48 hours of growth, tend to have a shiny surface.

<doc id="1282533" wikidata="Q3098515" url="?curid=1282533" title="Gary Armstrong (rugby union)">
<text>Gary Armstrong (born 30 September 1966, in Edinburgh) is a former Scotland international rugby union player. He played scrum-half for Jed-Forest RFC, Newcastle Falcons and the Border Reivers.

==Rugby Union career==

===Amateur career===

He played for Jed-Forest. His nickname is the &quot;Border Terrier&quot;.

Gary Armstrong had succeeded a fellow British and Irish Lion and Scotland player, Roy Laidlaw, as scrum half at Jed-Forest. Armstrong was helped in his development as a youngster by Jedforest moving Laidlaw to stand off with Armstrong playing scrum half.

Jed-Forest rugby club honored Gary Armstrong and their other two famous scrum-halves, Roy Laidlaw and Greig Laidlaw, with a gala dinner on 2 August 2019. All three played for the British and Irish Lions and captained Scotland.

At the age of 51, his old Scotland team-mate Finlay Calder coaxed Armstrong into playing for Stewart&#x27;s Melville 3rd team in a match against Penicuik 2nd team. Word got out that Armstrong was playing in the match; and Armstrong then played the 1st half with Stewarts Melville and the 2nd half with Penicuik.

===Provincial and professional career===

He played for South of Scotland District.

He played for the Reds Trial side in 1988, coming on as a substitute for Andrew Ker in the second half.

He joined Newcastle Falcons in 1995/96, and his appetite for the fray was seen to best advantage when the club won England&#x27;s Allied Dunbar Premiership title in 1998, featuring in all 22 matches of the season. He also started the victorious 2001 Anglo-Welsh Cup final. Many supporters believe Armstrong to be the best player in the club&#x27;s history. In Jonny Wilkinson&#x27;s book &quot;How to Play Rugby My Way&quot; Armstrong is given the nickname–&quot;the scrap-yard dog&quot;– because Wilkinson said that he had never met anyone as &quot;tough as him&quot;.

He was an ever-present in Newcastle Falcons 1998 Premiership win.

Armstrong finished his career by returning home to play for the newly created professional team, The Borders. He retired in 2004 at about the same time as Doddie Weir.

===International career===

He was capped by Scotland at age grades Under 16, Under 18 and Under 21.

He was capped twice by Scotland &#x27;B&#x27; in 1987-8. He scored 3 tries against Italy &#x27;B&#x27; in a 37–0 win for Scotland.

Armstrong made his full senior international debut in 1988, in a game against Australia building to their 1991 world cup victory. Armstrong displaced Laidlaw as the incumbent scrum half. Scotland lost 31–13 against one of Australia&#x27;s best ever sides.

Richard Bath writes of him:
:&quot;...despite his apparently painful shyness, Armstrong has proved throughout his career to be obsessively focussed once out on the pitch. A relatively small man, Armstrong tackles way over his weight and combines this with quick service to his backs and an uncanny ability to break around the fringes just as easily from the first-phase as from ruck or maul. Although Armstrong failed to shine on the victorious 1989 Lions tour of Australia, his gritty nature stood him in good stead when the chips were down in 1990, that famous year for Scotland... he perhaps more than any other player was the on-field catalyst for Scotland&#x27;s 13–7 win in the Grand Slam decider against the Auld Enemy England at Murrayfield.&quot;

It was Armstrong&#x27;s dart to the blind side that provided the spark opening the opportunity leading to Tony Stanger&#x27;s try.

He was scrum half in Scotland&#x27;s 1990 Grand Slam win and his country&#x27;s run to the 1991 rugby world cup semi final.

Armstrong&#x27;s fearless commitment led to serious knee injuries in 1992 and 1994 that impacted the representative caps he collected. It spoke volumes for his tenacity and courage that he returned to the top flight.

In 1998 he captained the Scotland team again.

Armstrong equalled Roy Laidlaw’s then record as Scotland’s most capped scrum-half when he won his 47th cap against Romania in August 1999. He then joined the 50-cap club when he led Scotland to victory in the World Cup play-off match against Samoa that October.

Armstrong captained Scotland to victory in the 1999 Five Nations and to a quarter final place in the same year&#x27;s rugby world cup.

Gary Armstrong captained Scotland to the 1999 Five Nations Championship, playing his eighth Test as captain as Scotland grasped pole position with their stunning 36–22 victory against France.

He was skipper throughout the previous two Five Nations Championships and was also captain on Scotland’s 1999 visit to South Africa, when he played in all four matches and scored the opening try of the tour in the victory over Border.

He retired from international rugby after Scotland’s 18–30 defeat by New Zealand in the 1999 Rugby World Cup quarter-final.

He played 51 times for Scotland.

In a 2015 series of articles in The Herald titled &quot;The 50 Greatest Scottish Rugby Players&quot;, Armstrong was ranked as Scotland&#x27;s greatest. Armstrong was known for intuitive awareness and was as much an auxiliary flanker and had uncanny talent to break around the fringes. As well as providing quick service as the connection between forwards and backs he was known for his toughness and tackling well above his weight. His fearlessness on the pitch led to two serious knee injuries keeping him out the game for lengthy spells.

<doc id="1282548" wikidata="Q864883" url="?curid=1282548" title="Jarzynski equality">
<text>The Jarzynski equality (JE) is an equation in statistical mechanics that relates free energy differences between two states and the irreversible work along an ensemble of trajectories joining the same states. It is named after the physicist Christopher Jarzynski (then at the University of Washington and Los Alamos National Laboratory, currently at the University of Maryland) who derived it in 1996. Fundamentally, the Jarzynski equality points to the fact that the fluctuations in the work satisfy certain constraints separately from the average value of the work that occurs in some process.

==Overview==
In thermodynamics, the free energy difference formula_1 between two states &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; is connected to the work &quot;W&quot; done on the system through the &quot;inequality&quot;:

: formula_2,

with equality holding only in the case of a quasistatic process, i.e. when one takes the system from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; infinitely slowly (such that all intermediate states are in thermodynamic equilibrium). In contrast to the thermodynamic statement above, the JE remains valid no matter how fast the process happens. The JE states:

: formula_3

Here &quot;k&quot; is the Boltzmann constant and &quot;T&quot; is the temperature of the system in the equilibrium state &quot;A&quot; or, equivalently, the temperature of the heat reservoir with which the system was thermalized before the process took place.

The over-line indicates an average over all possible realizations of an external process that takes the system from the equilibrium state &quot;A&quot; to a new, generally nonequilibrium state under the same external conditions as that of the equilibrium state &quot;B&quot;. This average over possible realizations is an average over different possible fluctuations that could occur during the process (due to Brownian motion, for example), each of which will cause a slightly different value for the work done on the system. In the limit of an infinitely slow process, the work &quot;W&quot; performed on the system in each realization is numerically the same, so the average becomes irrelevant and the Jarzynski equality reduces to the thermodynamic equality formula_4 (see above). Away from the infinitely slow limit, the average value of the work obeys formula_5 while the distribution of the fluctuations in the work are further constrained such that formula_3 In this general case, &quot;W&quot; depends upon the specific initial microstate of the system, though its average can still be related to formula_7 through an application of Jensen&#x27;s inequality in the JE, viz.

: formula_5

in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics.

The Jarzynski equality holds when the initial state is a Boltzmann distribution (e.g. the system is in equilibrium) and the system and environment can be described by a large number of degrees of freedom evolving under arbitrary Hamiltonian dynamics. The final state does not need to be in equilibrium. (For example, in the textbook case of a gas compressed by a piston, the gas is equilibrated at piston position &quot;A&quot; and compressed to piston position &quot;B&quot;; in the Jarzynski equality, the final state of the gas does not need to be equilibrated at this new piston position).

Since its original derivation, the Jarzynski equality has been verified in a variety of contexts, ranging from experiments with biomolecules to numerical simulations. The Crooks fluctuation theorem, proved two years later, leads immediately to the Jarzynski equality. Many other theoretical derivations have also appeared, lending further confidence to its generality.

== Examples ==

=== Fluctuation-dissipation theorem ===
Taking the log of formula_9, and use the cumulant expansion up to the second cumulant, we obtain formula_10. The left side is the work dissipated into the heat bath, and the right side could be interpreted as the fluctuation in the work due to thermal noise.

Consider dragging an overdamped particle in a viscous fluid with temperature formula_11 at constant force formula_12 for a time formula_13. Because there is no potential energy for the particle, the change in free energy is zero, so we obtain formula_14.

The work expended is formula_15, where formula_16 is the total displacement during the time. The particle&#x27;s displacement has a mean part due to the external dragging, and a varying part due to its own diffusion, so formula_17, where formula_18 is the diffusion coefficient. Together, we obtainformula_19or formula_20, where formula_21 is the viscosity. This is the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.

In fact, for most trajectories, the work is positive, but for some rare trajectories, the work is negative, and those contribute enormously to the expectation, giving us an expectation that is exactly one.

==History==

A question has been raised about who gave the earliest statement of the Jarzynski equality. For example, in 1977 the Russian physicists G.N. Bochkov and Yu. E. Kuzovlev (see Bibliography) proposed a generalized version of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem which holds in the presence of arbitrary external time-dependent forces. Despite its close similarity to the JE, the Bochkov-Kuzovlev result does not relate free energy differences to work measurements, as discussed by Jarzynski himself in 2007.

Another similar statement to the Jarzynski equality is the nonequilibrium partition identity, which can be traced back to Yamada and Kawasaki. (The Nonequilibrium Partition Identity is the Jarzynski equality applied to two systems whose free energy difference is zero - like straining a fluid.) However, these early statements are very limited in their application. Both Bochkov and Kuzovlev as well as Yamada and Kawasaki consider a deterministic time reversible Hamiltonian system. As Kawasaki himself noted this precludes any treatment of nonequilibrium steady states. The fact that these nonequilibrium systems heat up forever because of the lack of any thermostatting mechanism leads to divergent integrals etc. No purely Hamiltonian description is capable of treating the experiments carried out to verify the Crooks fluctuation theorem, Jarzynski equality and the fluctuation theorem. These experiments involve thermostatted systems in contact with heat baths.

<text>Amanda Lee Williford (born January 22, 1981), known by her stage name Willa Ford, is an American interior designer and former singer, songwriter, television personality, film actress, dancer, and model. She released her debut album, &quot;Willa Was Here&quot;, in 2001. Ford also has appeared in movies such as &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; (2009), hosted several reality television shows, posed for &quot;Playboy&quot; and competed on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;.

==Early life==
Ford was raised in Ruskin, Florida. She began singing with the Tampa Bay Children&#x27;s Choir at age eight. At age 11, she started singing with the Tampa-based children&#x27;s performing arts troupe, Entertainment Revue. She attended East Bay High School in Gibsonton, Florida.

==Career==
===Music career===
In 1999, the 18-year-old Ford started performing under the stage name Mandah and was signed to MCA. Ford was later dropped from MCA and signed by Atlantic Records. Atlantic placed one of Ford&#x27;s songs, &quot;Lullaby,&quot; on the soundtrack for &quot;Pokémon: The First Movie&quot;. Ford changed her stage name from Mandah to Willa Ford to avoid confusion with Mandy Moore.

In 2000, she was one of the opening acts on the Backstreet Boys&#x27; &quot;Into the Millennium&quot; tour.

In 2001, Ford signed on to a new label, Lava Atlantic Records, while on a mall tour for Nautica Kids. Ford wrote most of her own lyrics and served as executive producer for most of her first album. On July 17, 2001, she released &quot;Willa Was Here&quot;. The album included the single &quot;I Wanna Be Bad&quot; which featured rapper Royce da 5&#x27;9&quot;. &quot;Willa Was Here&quot; reached 56 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold approximately 200,000 copies. Ford went on to release a second single from the album, &quot;Did Ya&#x27; Understand That,&quot; which was released on September 11, 2001, failed to garner much attention. She would later explain that &quot;Everything that happened that day froze; the world stood still, as it should have. My second single didn’t do well because anything that launched that day kind of got canned.&quot; &quot;Ooh Ooh&quot; was released as a promotional single, but also failed to find success.

Ford was a spokesperson for Pantene Pro-V&#x27;s ProVoice campaign while promoting the album. She also appeared in Uncle Kracker&#x27;s video for &quot;In A Little While.&quot; Ford also went on to guest-host MTV&#x27;s &quot;TRL&quot; and &quot;Say What Karaoke&quot;, which led to a hosting contract with Viacom. Ford hosted the MTV reality shows &quot;The Morning After&quot; and &quot;I Bet You Will&quot;. In 2001, Ford also co-wrote and recorded a duet with South Korean pop star Park Ji-yoon. The song, titled &quot;Nastified,&quot; appeared on Park&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Man.&quot; She was also part of an ad campaign for Six Flags.

In 2003, Ford released a song titled &quot;A Toast to Men.&quot; The song, which featured guest rapper Lady May, was featured in daytime promotional ads for soap operas. The single came from her unreleased second album &quot;Sexysexobsessive&quot;, which was previously titled &quot;Porn Poetry&quot;. The title track, &quot;Sexysexobsessive,&quot; was to be the second single, but it was only released through Ford&#x27;s official website.

From 2005 to 2006, she appeared as a guest doll in Pussycat Dolls&#x27; show at the club in Las Vegas. In 2010, she released the first song since 2003 &quot;All This Time&quot; online, collaborated with Riley Smith. In 2011, Ford resumed her music career with a performance at The Viper Room in LA. In the performance, she revealed her first solo song since 2003, &quot;Back Back Back.&quot; In 2014, she was featured in the song &quot;Rock Tonight&quot; by Willa Ford, Eve Nelson and Ray Cervenka.

She would state that after her music didn&#x27;t garner as much success as hoped for, she &quot;really took a step back because I felt like I wasn&#x27;t doing what I was supposed to be at the time.&quot; &quot;I know that sounds crazy, but it was the perfect storm, and I walked away,&quot; as she would go on to try out many different careers.

===Television, film, and magazine appearances===
In 2002, Ford appeared in an episode of the short-lived television sitcom &quot;Raising Dad,&quot; playing a bully named Edie. In 2005, Ford hosted the first season of the reality show &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot; on Spike TV. After the show&#x27;s finale, Ford was contracted as a summer&#x27;s guest doll performer for the Las Vegas shows of The Pussycat Dolls. Ford was later featured as the June celebrity on &quot;FHM&quot;&#x27;s 2005 pin-up calendar.

In early 2006, Ford played as one of the four celebrity quarterbacks for the Lingerie Bowl, which was shown during the half-time of Super Bowl XL. Later that year, she was featured in a nude pictorial in the March 2006 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;. &quot;Stuff&quot; magazine ranked her No. 48 in the 101 Sexiest Online Women supplement later that year. In fall 2006, Ford competed on the third season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. Ford and her partner, Maksim Chmerkovskiy, were eliminated in the fifth week of competition. She talked about her experience with &quot;Maxim&quot; in its January 2007 issue.

Ford appeared on an episode of &quot;My Celebrity Home&quot; on the Style Network, which aired on January 31, 2007 She also hosted the third season of &quot;Pants-Off Dance-Off&quot; on Fuse TV. On August 23, 2007, Ford and her then-husband, NHL hockey player Mike Modano, were featured in an episode of &quot;MTV Cribs&quot;.

Ford appeared in the 2009 slasher film &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;.

Ford played Becca in the direct-to-video &quot;Universal Squadrons&quot;, which was first shown at the Comic-Con International Independent Film Festival in 2010.

Ford appeared in a 2011 episode of &quot;The Glades&quot;. In 2012, she appeared in 4 episodes of the &quot;Magic City&quot; and an episode of &quot;Leverage&quot; season five. In June 2014, it was announced that she was working on four films: &quot;Submerged&quot;, &quot;Any Day&quot;, &quot;The Nurse&quot;, and &quot;Checkmate&quot;.

Ford was also cast in the film &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Fury&quot;, but was later dropped. In an interview with BZFilm.com, producer Fabio Soldani said that Ford was replaced after five days of shooting and that she was &quot;a nightmare to be around&quot; and &quot;shooting was a really sad place to be for those 5 days&quot;.

She currently runs a home interior design business, WFord Interiors.

In 2019, Ford appeared on an E!&#x27;s reality show &quot;Flip It Like Disick&quot;.

==Personal life==

Ford and hockey player Mike Modano married in a small, private ceremony on August 25, 2007, in Athens, Texas. In August 2012, Ford and Modano announced that they were divorcing.

In April 2015, Ford married former NFL linebacker Ryan Nece. In March 2016, it was announced that the couple were expecting their first child. On September 7, 2016, Ford gave birth to a son.

<text>Woodward Academy (also known as Woodward or WA) is a private, co-educational college-preparatory school for pre-kindergarten to 12th grade on two campuses located in College Park and Johns Creek, Georgia, United States, within the Atlanta metropolitan area.

==History==

Woodward Academy was founded in 1900 as Georgia Military Academy. Originally an all-male school, in 1964 it became coeducational and was renamed Woodward Academy in 1966. The boarding program was discontinued in 1993. Woodward draws its students from 23 metro Atlanta counties taken to school by MARTA, Woodward buses, parents, or carpool. The school has two campuses – the Main Campus in College Park (preK-12) and Woodward North in Johns Creek (preK-6).

== Academics ==
Woodward Academy is divided into five schools. Located on the Main Campus in historic College Park are the Upper, Middle, Lower, and Primary schools. The second campus, Woodward North, serves preK through sixth grade. The Primary School has students in preK through 3rd grade, the Lower School has 4th through 6th grade students, the Middle School has 7th and 8th grade students, and the Upper School has students in 9th grade through 12th grade.

==Athletics==

Woodward Academy&#x27;s athletics program sponsors 18 varsity sports across fall, winter and spring seasons. Woodward (formerly Georgia Military Academy) has won 84 State Championships administered by the Georgia High School Association.

== History and traditions of (GMA) ==
&quot;The Woodward Story, A History of Georgia Military/Woodward Academy 1900-1990&quot;, by Robert Ballentine, published 1990 by Jostens Printing and Publishing; content used with permission of the copyright holder, Woodward Academy Inc., College Park, Georgia, USA.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Woodward Story, A History of Georgia Military/Woodward Academy 1900-1990&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgia Military Academy (GMA) was a private, college-preparatory military school located in College Park, Georgia that taught both boarding and non-boarding students from its founding in September 1900 to 1965. It was called GMA by its students, faculty and staff. In 1965 its Board of Directors changed the corporate name to Woodward Academy and discontinued Army ROTC as well as all the school’s previous military traditions and customs.

Georgia Military Academy was opened in September 1900 by Colonel John Charles Woodward and his wife, Lucile Woodward, in the single three-story building which became known as Founders Hall. The building had been the site of a previous, short-lived military academy known as Southern Military Academy. The campus consisted of sixteen acres of unimproved scrub land. The first class of thirty cadets lived and worked in Founders Hall in its eight resident rooms. Founders’ Hall included ten classrooms, laboratories, a library and an armory. By the 1901 term, enrollment had grown to fifty cadets, the grounds had been cleared, a garden, hog pens and a small dairy had been added. By 1907, GMA had grown to one hundred and twenty cadets and ten teachers. The first major construction at GMA was Rugby Hall which was completed in 1902 and which contained fourteen resident rooms for teachers and cadets. A gymnasium was added in 1907 which later became known as the “Old Gym.” In 1908, at the order of President Teddy Roosevelt, a Regular U.S. Army officer was posted to serve as a full-time military instructor. In that same year, a football field was constructed and dedicated.

=== The years 1911 to 1925 ===

During the years leading up to and immediately after World War I, GMA continued to expand and took on greater importance in Georgia and National history. In 1914, its founder Col. Woodward was instrumental in launching the Association of Military Colleges and Schools (now known as AMCSUS) of which GMA became a founding member school. In 1916, GMA was established as a Junior Reserve Officer’s Training Corp (“JROTC” or “Junior ROTC”) under the National Defense Act of 1916. Six hundred GMA alumni served in World War I and most served as commissioned officers. Thirteen GMA alumni were killed in WWI and are memorialized in Monument Row along the central avenue of Woodward Academy also honoring alumni killed in World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War and in military conflicts since 1973. The campus grew to over twenty-five acres and other iconic buildings were added, all in the same red brick with white column architectural style including Memorial Hall, the Founders Hall Annex and the New Gym which was believed to be the largest gym of any prep school in the country. The New Gym was renovated to administrative offices in 1943 and continued in use until 1975.

GMA was designated as an Honor Military Academy in 1925. In June 1925 GMA was notified that it had achieved the designation of Honor Military Academy in a letter from then Major General Douglas MacArthur who would later become famous as General of the Army in World War II. Every year from then forward the Corps of Cadets prepared for its annual Army inspection to decide whether the “Honor” designation could be maintained. GMA Cadets painted, cleaned, mopped, oiled, policed, polished, mended and drilled for weeks in preparation. In the military tradition of preparing for inspection, no outside help was ever received. This annual ritual exemplified the Academy’s emphasis on personal self-reliance and attention to detail. The Honor Military Academy designation gave GMA the right to appoint one cadet to each of the four Service Academies.

=== Challenging years – the Great Depression ===

The years beginning around 1926 were financially challenging for GMA. The day student population had declined to seven cadets by 1926. Colonel Woodward cultivated a relationship with Cuban friends and persuaded Major N.J. Castellanos and his wife Maria to join the faculty. Recruitment of Cuban students and other full-tuition-paying students from other countries helped keep GMA going. During these years, teacher salaries were low and some teachers were working for room and board. The iconic Memorial Gate was dedicated by the Class of 1929-1930 and the band got their first uniforms. Lucile Woodward, co-founder of GMA, died in 1931.

=== The Great Gesture – 1932 ===

In 1932, in what became known as the “Great Gesture,” Col. Woodward transferred all his ownership to and became a co-founder of the non-profit corporation known as Georgia Military Academy. The Academy, now a corporation with a governing board, remained in College Park, Georgia and was founded “not for pecuniary gain to stockholders, but for the purpose of conducting a charitable and educational institution.” Other founders included William Roe Brewster, who was to replace Col. Woodward in the 1930s, Robert W. Woodruff, R.S. Rosser, D.C. Woodward, George W. West, C.D. Woodward, Glenville Giddings, Mrs. Mildred C. Woodward, Mrs. Ruth Gladys McQuarrie, Mrs. Elsie Gore Woodward, Grace Charles Woodward, Majorie
Lucille Woodward and others.

=== William R. Brewster becomes President of GMA ===

In 1939, Col. Woodward died and Col. William R. Brewster Sr., son-in-law of Col. Woodward, was elected by the Board of Directors to become the second president of GMA. Col. Brewster, a 1920 graduate of the U.S. Military Academy, had been a professor of mathematics and commandant of GMA. He guided GMA’s growth from 400 cadets to 1,000. He founded a Junior School (primary school grades) that grew from 50 cadets to 300. He founded the GMA Junior College in 1940 and initiated its termination in 1953 when draft deferment was ended for junior college students. He planned for and supervised the construction of the Junior School building, the Administration Building (West Hall), the Rugby Hall Annex and the Gymnasium.

=== William R. Brewster Jr. becomes President of GMA ===

In 1960, Commander William R. Brewster Jr., U.S.N.R, became the third president of GMA from 1959 to 1979. “Commander Brewster,” as he was known by cadets, graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy with the class of 1942 days after Pearl Harbor on December 19, 1941. In Operation Torch in North Africa his ship, the BERNADOU, was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation and Brewster as its Gunnery Officer the Silver Star Medal. In October 1944 off Okinawa, his ship USS Prichett (DD 561) was attacked and he was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with a Combat “V.” He was a Naval Aviator, remaining in the Naval Air Reserve. Commander Brewster taught mathematics and science and served as commandant at GMA. During the next thirty-three years he worked up the administrative ladder. His wife of 57 years, Kathryn (“Kitty”) Cummings Brewster, was a beloved figure to GMA Cadets for her warmth and charm. She was active in the school’s administration, including interior design for new buildings, approval of weekly menus, landscape design and supervision, purchasing and distributing textbooks and supervision of school opening and social functions. During his tenure as President, he initiated the school’s first fundraising effort in its 65-year history which raised enough capital to renovate many old facilities and build necessary new ones. Between 1965 and 1966, he carried out the transition of GMA from a military academy to a non-military college preparatory school, Woodward Academy, and brought many other changes including phasing out the Army ROTC program.

=== War service of GMA alumni ===

During the Second World War and the Korean War, GMA offered continuous school which allowed graduation in two and one-half years. An estimated 1,500 alumni served in the armed forces during those wars with over fifty percent serving as commissioned officers. About 600 GMA alumni served in World War I and many GMA alumni also served in the Vietnam War. The entry to the Woodward Academy campus along East Rugby Street is lined with memorials to GMA alumni who died in each war of the 20th and 21st Centuries.

=== Traditions of GMA ===

The military traditions of GMA in some cases mirrored those of the U.S. Military Academy. Some of those traditions are summarized here:

* Bull Ring - Cadet infractions could bring on an “award” of demerits by military members of the faculty for violation of Cadet Regulations, failure to properly maintain uniforms, rooms or equipment and for other infractions too numerous to repeat here. A cadet who received ten or more demerits in one week would be required to “walk off” those demerits on Saturday or after church on Sunday by marching around the East Rugby Avenue oval which circled the War Memorials (the “Memorial Oval”) for one hour to remove each demerit. This was known as “walking off demerits” or “walking bull-ring” and was supervised by the Commandant’s office. There was no appeal from the Commandant’s determination that an infraction had occurred.
* Morning Formation - The entire Cadet Corps of the Senior School (Grades 9-12) would assemble each morning at 07:30 hours on the south side of the Memorial Oval for inspection and announcements. The Corps assembled in platoons three ranks deep and each platoon leader inspected for shave, haircut, shoeshine, tie, collar spiffy in place, clean starched shirt and trousers, shirt seam aligned with trouser flap (i.e., “gig line” correct). The Commandant would then make announcements over the public address speaker system. Any cadets whose names had been called would assemble at the required locations (the “South Sally Port” was a favorite assembly point) for any required administrative purpose. The formation would then be dismissed so cadets could attend class.
* Bugle Calls - The lives of cadets were regulated each day by standard U.S. Army bugle calls which came from the Commandant’s Office in Rugby Hall. A scratchy record announced, in turn, First Call, Reveille, Attention, Mess Call, Assembly, School Call, Recall, Retreat, Taps.
* Springtime Sunday parades - GMA held full Cadet Corps parades each Sunday in the Spring to which the public was invited. The Robert W. Woodruff Cadet Band led the Cadet Corps onto the field with John Phillip Souza marches including High School Cadets, King Cotton, The Thunderer, The Washington Post and El Capitan. After Adjutant’s Call, the whole Corps passed in review.
* Presidential Inaugural Parades - The GMA Cadet Corp participated in Presidential Inaugural parades including those for Theodore Roosevelt, Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson, Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson
* Springtime Sunday Parades - Young cadets in uniform had the admiration of the local girls and earned the animosity of the local boys. Being an all-male institution, cadets dated girls from the local community who were invited to the school’s military balls and were asked to be sponsors of cadet officers at the graduation parade.

<doc id="1282571" wikidata="Q2592915" url="?curid=1282571" title="Unionist government, 1895–1905">
<text>A coalition of the Conservative and Liberal Unionist parties took power in the United Kingdom shortly before the 1895 general election. Conservative leader Lord Salisbury was appointed Prime Minister and his nephew, Arthur Balfour, became Leader of the House of Commons, but various major posts went to the Liberal Unionists, most notably the Leader of the House of Lords, the Liberal Unionist Duke of Devonshire, who was made Lord President, and his colleague in the Commons, Joseph Chamberlain, who became Colonial Secretary. It was this government which would conduct the Second Boer War from 1899–1902, which helped them to win a landslide victory at the 1900 general election.

The government consisted of three ministries, the first two led by Salisbury (from 1895–1902) and the third by Balfour (from 1902 onwards).

== The office of Prime Minister ==

Lord Salisbury was the second and last person to be head of government while not simultaneously holding the title of First Lord of the Treasury. It was said that there were some attempts to distinguish between the two offices, but in the century or more since, they have remained one and the same.

==Trade reform==
Balfour succeeded Salisbury as Prime Minister in 1902. Eventually, the Unionist government would falter after Chamberlain proposed his scheme for tariff reform, whose partial embrace by Balfour led to the resignation of the more orthodox free traders in the Cabinet.

==Chinese miners in South Africa==
After the conclusion of the Boer War, the British Government sought to rebuild the South African economy which had been devastated by the war. An important part of the rebuilding effort was to get the gold mines of the Witwatersrand, the richest in history and a major cause of the war, back in production as soon as possible. Because the government decreed that White labour was too expensive and Black labourers were reluctant to return to the mines, the government decided to import over 60,000 contracted workers from China.

This was deeply unpopular at the time, as popular opinion in much of the Western world, including Britain; was hostile to Chinese immigration. It also happened at a time when poverty and unemployment amongst working-class British people was at very high levels. On 26 March 1904, a demonstration against Chinese immigration to South Africa was held in Hyde Park and was attended by 80,000 people. The Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress then passed a resolution declaring that:

==Fall from power==
With his majority greatly reduced and defeat in the next election seeming inevitable, Balfour resigned as Prime Minister in December 1905, leading to the appointment of a minority Liberal government under Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. In the general election which followed in 1906, all but three members of Balfour&#x27;s Cabinet lost their seats, including Balfour himself.

==Cabinets==
===Salisbury ministry===
====June 1895 to November 1900====








====November 1900 to July 1902====
In November 1900, the Cabinet was reformed for the first time.

<doc id="1282574" wikidata="Q434701" url="?curid=1282574" title="Mayra Verónica">
<text>Mayra Verónica Aruca Rodríguez (born August 20, 1980) is a Cuban singer, actress, model, and television public figure who became popular for her appearances on Spanish-language television. Verónica&#x27;s role in Univision&#x27;s Don Francisco Presenta brought her to the attention of FHM magazine&#x27;s US edition. After appearing in FHM, she went on to do additional magazine work. She has taken part in many Spanish-language television shows, as well as appearing in music videos and television commercials.

In 2012, Verónica signed an exclusive worldwide co-publishing deal with BMG Chrysalis in the US. In 2013, she signed with Simon Cowell&#x27;s label Syco Music (Sony Music). Her debut EP, &quot;Mama Mia&quot;, was released on August 29, 2013, on Syco Music by Sony Music Entertainment UK. In 2015, Mayra Veronica signed a major record worldwide deal with Warner Bros. Records.
The Cuban-American&#x27;s career has seen her grace the covers of Billboard Magazine, FHM, Shape &amp; Maxim, along with high-profile national ad campaigns with L&#x27;Oréal, Coca-Cola &amp; Nike.

She is a spokeswoman for the USO and is the founder of MVA Entertainment Group, a company dedicated to the promotion, publicity and management of independent music artists. 

==Early life==
Mayra Verónica was born in Havana, Cuba, where her father was a member of one of Cuba&#x27;s rock bands, Los Dada. At the age of six, she moved to Miami with her mother, Mayra Rodriguez, leaving behind the rest of her family, including her father, Arturo Aruca, and sister, Giselle Guzman. Her father came a year later and reunited with Veronica and her mother, while her sister was unable to meet them until thirteen years later. Mayra grew up with little money and food was sometimes scarce.

== Pageants and modeling ==
Verónica continued school, and after joining a local beauty pageant and becoming Ms. Miami, the photographer who covered the event was captivated by Mayra&#x27;s photos, and invited her to his studio for free sessions. Thus, Mayra obtained her first modeling book and signed with a local agent in Miami. The agent sent her to an audition for a local TV entertainment news show &quot;Miami Hoy&quot; (at the time Mayra was at Florida International University majoring in psychology and theater). She did not know much about being a reporter but determined she could act like one.

She began as a correspondent but was promoted to celebrity hostess for Miami Hoy where she was seen writing, producing and editing her own segments as she interviewed a roster of celebrities, ranging from Donald Trump, Oscar de la Renta, Hugh Hefner,Marc Anthony and Dennis Rodman. Throughout, Verónica traveled to New York to continue acting training at the Lee Strasberg Institute to fine-tune her craft, until the station (owned by Media One) was bought by AT&amp;T Corporation and subsequently closed.

After graduating from Florida International University with a major in psychology and a minor in business and theater, she turned to acting full time and moved to New York City to graduate from the famed Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute. Mayra went on to star in feature roles in PBS productions and films such as Tumbe, The Suitor and Pledge This.

Verónica landed a made-for-TV movie called &quot;The Suitor&quot; and did commercial campaigns for Nike, L&#x27;Oréal, and Coca-Cola. Univision announced a new show hosted by Don Francisco. They wanted Verónica to be their model and co-host but with one catch. Due to her ample curves, her last appearance on screen for the day would entail her backside presented before turning around to face the camera, to which she gladly agreed. Once the show aired, the model with the great backside became the talk of Latinos everywhere, so much so, the American press became interested.

== Cover girl ==
&quot;FHM&quot;, the top men&#x27;s magazine of the time, contacted Veronica&#x27;s publicist to ask for a feature spread on their magazine. Veronica agreed and after mail requesting her return, she went on to appear on the cover of the &quot;FHM&quot; exclusive collection book, which included top sex symbols of the decade such as Pamela Anderson, Eva Longoria, and Carmen Electra. From 2004 to 2010, Mayra Verónica made &quot;FHM&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Sexiest Women in the World&quot; list six years in a row. She was featured on other covers for &quot;FHM&quot;, Billboard Magazine, &quot;Maxim&quot;, &quot;Edge&quot;, &quot;GQ&quot;, &quot;Cosmo&quot;, &quot;Shape,&quot; and over 100 other national and international covers. Her popularity on such covers made her website one of the top traffic websites, with more than 4 million hits biweekly. With her popularity came emails from soldiers stationed in Iraq asking for her posters and, by now, famous calendars. Veronica&#x27;s management sent a care package of approximately 5000 posters. Shortly thereafter, the military named her the favorite pin-up girl for the US Marines and the USO asked her to tour with the troops.

== USO tours ==
The USO tour became a special Thanksgiving tour with Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General James Cartwright, actor Wilmer Valderrama, and comedian Russell Peters, traveling to six countries in six days: Iraq, Afghanistan, Germany, Turkey, Africa, and Greenland. The troops&#x27; response was overwhelming and although Verónica had previously decided not to do any more calendars, she changed her mind and appeared on one in 2008, dedicating proceeds to the Wounded Warrior Project.

Upon her return from the tour, she was described as a &quot;modern-day Betty Grable&quot;. Verónica continued touring with the USO and became an official spokesperson, appearing with then-President George W. Bush and Gary Sinise on a panel for C-SPAN about the organization.

On July 2, 2009, the New York Stock Exchange asked her to ring the NASDAQ bell for the Fourth of July week. Verónica decided to bring awareness to two of the organizations for which she&#x27;s an advocate and spokesperson, The USO and UNICEF, and brought them to the bell-ringing ceremony.

Verónica continued her work with the troops by visiting the wounded at Camp Lejeune.

== Music ==

Mayra Verónica collaborated on her first album with Univision Network in 2007, which was titled &quot;Vengo Con To&quot; (Comin&#x27; At Ya With Everything). Performed in the musical style of reggaetón, Verónica&#x27;s album included &quot;Vengo Con To&quot; of which King magazine said: &quot;Verónica&#x27;s moaning makes Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Erotica&quot; sound like bubblegum pop… chew on that Daddy Yankee.&quot; The song charted in the Top 40 on &quot;Billboard,&quot; while the music video was reportedly banned from Latin television. The album&#x27;s popularity landed Verónica a deal with Universal Motown, which put out a second single from the album titled &quot;Mamma Mia&quot;. A third single, &quot;Es Tan Dificil Olvidarte&quot;, dedicated to fallen troops, put Verónica in the top 10 on the pop contemporary charts. In 2014, Veronica&#x27;s song &quot;Mama Mia&quot; was nominated for &quot;Best Latin Dance Song of The Year&quot; by the 29th Annual International Dance Music Awards (IDMA).

Verónica began 2010 on the cover of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine with a new single, &quot;If You Wanna Fly&quot;, that reached number 9 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot Dance Club Play chart, number 11 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot Dance Airplay chart, number 5 on Billboard Dance/Electronic sales, number 17 on Billboard Heatseekers Songs and number 74 Hot 100 Chart. She released an album titled &quot;Saint Nor Sinner&quot; in 2012. Mayra Veronica landed the cover of Billboard Magazine again in July 2011, for the release of her new single &quot;Freak Like Me&quot; which reached top 10 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Charts. In March 2012, Mayra Veronica&#x27;s video &quot;Freak Like Me&quot;, featuring Antonio Sabato Jr. who plays Verónica&#x27;s love interest, was added to MTV Hits &amp; VHI Latin America on full rotation. Mayra Veronica also worked on a parody with actor Keenan Cahill for Freak Like me which garnered millions of online views.

Veronica&#x27;s &quot;Ay Mama Mia&quot; The Remixes went number 1 on Billboard Magazine Hot Dance Club Play chart in March 2013. &quot;Ay Mama Mia&quot; was produced by Grammy-nominated producers, Dave Audé &amp; Roy Tavaré. The video was directed by the Actor/Director Larenz Tate. The original Spanish music video reached over 12 million views on YouTube. &quot;Ay Mama Mia&quot; was signed to publishing at BMG Records and it was also &quot;the official theme song for the new IFC Film The Sons of The Buena Vista Social Media Club Musica Cubana impacting theaters worldwide in 2013&quot; &quot;The song became the most popular song on Just Dance The #1 music video game platform of all time!&quot; A lot of Mayra Veronica&#x27;s &quot;Ay Mama Mia&#x27;s&quot; success was attributed to not just its great sound but the influence of record executive Simon Cowell who signed Mayra Veronica and the winning song to his music label Syco Music in London.

Veronica&#x27;s &quot;MAMA YO!&quot; came in later as a collaboration with the Italian Electro Swing band &quot;The Sweet Life Society&quot; The production is a remake of Carmen Miranda&#x27;s &quot;Mama Yo Quero&quot;. The electro-house track debuted on the US Billboard Dance/Mix Show chart and saw success in Europe and North America. The music video has over 10 Million combined views on YouTube. It was remixed with Sean Paul as a featured artist and renamed &quot;Outta Control&quot; before being released by BMG Records in 2016 together with Yolanda Be Cool
Mayra Veronica continued to put out Club/Dance hits like latin producer Sak Noel&#x27;s &quot;No Boyfriend No Problem&quot; and Nils Van Zandt &quot;Party Crasher&quot; in 2018 

Mayra Veronica returned after the Pandemic with a strong Latin beat. &quot;The multi-talented Cuban American singer/songwriter released her latest infectious, intensely percussive Tropical/Latin Spanish language single on April 8, 2022 via BMG Records&quot; titled &quot;VEN&quot; cowritten by her and Cuban songwriter Carlos Celles &quot;Mayra will then follow the release of &#x27;Ven&#x27; with a ballad titled &#x27;Que Mas&#x27;, also co-written by her and Celles and produced by Gustavo Farias, a multi-Grammy winner who has worked with Juan Gabriel, Marc Anthony, Paul Anka, Vicente Fernandez, Andrea Bocelli, Luis Fonsi&quot; The ballad expects to have its release in late 2024.

<doc id="1282575" wikidata="Q2909677" url="?curid=1282575" title="Anti-runway penetration bomb">
<text>Anti-runway penetration bombs are explosive weapons involving bombs or bomblets designed to damage or destroy runways, or otherwise render them unusable for aircraft.

Perhaps the most strategically decisive, best known, and first wartime use of specialized cratering anti-runway weapons was by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War. The dibber bombs played a major part in the near complete destruction of the large Egyptian Air Force, mostly on the ground, in a preemptive strike on the first morning of the war by the commitment of the whole of the far smaller Israeli Air Force to the strike. The surprising elimination of the Egyptian, Syrian, Jordanian and Iraqi&#x27;s air force and resulting Israeli air supremacy contributed significantly to the outcome of the war on all fronts. Before the war, France offered the IAF a $200,000-per-unit Runway Buster solution. It was too expensive for the country still in a recession. So, the head of the IAF Munition Development unit, Lieutenant Colonel Asher Peleg, met with the Head of Research and Development for the IMI, Avraham Makov. The two discussed how to find a solution locally. Within five days, they had their answer: an Israeli-designed Runway Buster that would only cost 2,000 Lira (the country&#x27;s currency in 1967) to produce. It used rocket braking over the target and a second rocket burst to plunge through the runway surface and explode.

One system available from 1977 diverging from the French/Israeli runway piercing bomb concept used in 1967 is the Matra Durandal, a single 450 lb bomb with parachute braking, rocket booster, and two warheads. Dropped by aircraft flying at low level, it is braked by parachute, and when at the correct angle fires a rocket to impact the runway. It first ignites a large explosive charge to create a crater, and then uses a smaller charge that has penetrated the crater to displace adjacent concrete slabs. The slabs, once displaced, are far harder to deal with than a simple hole that can be patched with asphalt. The Durandal has been widely exported. The Durandal was used in 1991 by the United States Air Force in the initial stages of the Gulf War, delivered by General Dynamics F-111 Aardvarks against Iraqi airfields.

Another, now withdrawn from service, was the JP233, a dispenser and submunitions system. An aircraft would fly over the target runway and release a mixture of penetrating and anti-personnel submunitions to both crater the runway and impede repair work. The anti-personnel mines could be armed with time-delay fuses, threatening runway repair crews with the risk of death or bodily injury. After the UK signed an international accord banning cluster mines, the JP233 was retired.

<text>The Cable Car Museum is a free museum in the Nob Hill neighborhood of San Francisco, California. Located at 1201 Mason Street, it contains historical and explanatory exhibits on the San Francisco cable car system, which can itself be regarded as a working museum.

==Exhibits==
The museum contains several preserved cable cars, together with smaller exhibits and a gift shop. The cable cars displayed include:

* Sutter Street Railway - grip car 46 and trailer 54 dating from the 1870s
* Clay Street Hill Railroad - grip car 8, the only surviving car from the first cable car company

The museum is part of the complex that also houses the cable car power house, which drives the cables, and the car depot (&quot;barn&quot;). The car depot is not open to the public, but two galleries allow visitors to view the power house from above, and to descend below the junction of Washington and Mason streets to view the large cavern where the haulage cables are routed via large sheaves out to the street.

The museum was established in 1974, and is run by the Friends of the Cable Car Museum.

<doc id="1282585" wikidata="Q483195" url="?curid=1282585" title="Tokat Province">
<text>Tokat Province () is a province in northern Turkey. Its area is 10,042 km2, and its population is 596,454 (2022). Its adjacent provinces are Amasya to the northwest, Yozgat to the southwest, Sivas to the southeast, and Ordu to the northeast. Its capital is Tokat, which lies inland of the middle Black Sea region, 422 kilometers from Ankara. The governor is Numan Hatipoğlu, appointed in 2022.

==Etymology==
Evliya Çelebi explained the name of the city as Tok-at in return for the satiety of horses because of its rich barley in Turkish etymology. The Ottoman historian İsmail Hakkı explained Uzunçarşılı as Toh-kat, which means &quot;walled city&quot;, and Özhan Öztürk, in his work called Pontus, used the word &quot;Dahyu&quot;, which means &quot;country, chastity&quot; in Avesta and was first used for Cappadocia in the 6th century BC during the Achaemenid Empire. He claimed that the word &quot;Dokeia&quot;, which was corrupted in the Greek dialect, turned into Tokat in time.

==History==
Tokat, after remaining under the rule of the Hittites, Assyrians, Hurrians and Cimmerians, passed under the rule of Persians, Macedonians of Alexander the Great period, Capodocia Kingdom and Pontus Kingdom, which gave the name &quot;Comana Pontica&quot;. In 65 BC, it came under the rule of the Romans and the Byzantine Empire. Tokat Castle, which has a critical importance in Byzantine-Sassanid and Byzantine-Arab wars, is located on Hisartepe, 750 meters high, in the southwest of the city, which was taken under the rule of the Danismendids (1071) after the Malazgirt Victory and later by the Anatolian Seljuks (1150). The oldest traces of Tokat Castle belong to the 5th or 6th century and it is known that the castle existed in these years.

==Geography==
The city, which originates from the northern slopes of the central part of Deveci Mountains and joins Yeşilırmak on the left, is located on the slopes of a river valley, and is located at the junction of important roads connecting the Central Black Sea coast and Central and Eastern Anatolia in a very rugged region.
Total area of the province is 10,042 km2. In terms of the footprint area it covers 1.3% of Turkey&#x27;s land. It is 623 meters above sea level. Geographical Coordinates are being between 39 ° 51 &#x27;- 40 ° 55&#x27; north latitudes and 35 ° 27&#x27;- 37 ° 39 &#x27;East longitudes.

==Districts==

Tokat province is divided into 12 districts (capital district in bold):

==Landmarks==
Two notable monuments in this province are the Hatuniye Külliyesi of the 15th century, built by Sultan Bayezid II, and a Seljuk bridge spanning the Yeşilırmak River, belonging to the 12th century. The Latifoğlu Mansion is a third, which is an example of the traditional architecture of a Turkish house of the 19th century, restored recently to its original state.
Tokat Castle and Zile, Niksar and Turhal castles located in Tokat district are frequented by local and foreign tourists. In the city center of Tokat, the historical Tokat Clock Tower and the historical Gök Madrasa are placed. Additionally, The Yağıbasan Madrasah, known as the first madrasah built in Anatolia, the historical Pazar Caravanserai and the Ballıca Cave are located.

==Economy==
The people of Tokat earn their living from agriculture, animal husbandry and trade. The city is an ideal city for a peaceful life with its regular city structure, numerous natural beauties and economic shopping conditions. Trade and industry of Tokat, whose economy is based on agriculture and animal husbandry, is concentrated in the city center. Tokat Organized Industrial Zone is the area where the city&#x27;s only industrial activity continues. Again, with its geographical location, it is a city that is suitable for agriculture. In agricultural production, tomatoes, peppers, cherries, potatoes, grapes and sugar beet are the products that have the largest share in the regional production.

<text>Janet Michelle &quot;Jan&quot; Kerouac (February 16, 1952 – June 5, 1996) was an American writer and the only child of beat generation author Jack Kerouac and Joan Haverty Kerouac.

==Early life and career==

Janet Michelle Kerouac was born a few months after her parents separated. Jack Kerouac met his daughter for the first time when she was ten years old, when he took a blood test to prove or disprove his paternity. Jan only met him once more, when she visited him at his home in Lowell, Massachusetts.

In 1964, Jan Kerouac was briefly in a girl group called The Whippets. The group, which consisted of Kerouac, Charlotte Rosenthal, and Bibbe Hansen, released one single, &quot;I Want to Talk to You,&quot; a song response to the song &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand.&quot; The B-side, &quot;Go Go Go with Ringo,&quot; also reflected the Beatlemania of the time. The single did not chart or get much airplay, and the Whippets broke up.

Jan Kerouac lived much of her early life in poverty, sometimes turning to prostitution to survive. She traveled widely, living in South America, Europe, and many different cities in the United States.

==Lawsuit==

Encouraged by Kerouac biographer Gerald Nicosia, she entered into a lawsuit in the 1990s that proposed the will of Jack&#x27;s mother, Gabrielle Kerouac, was a forgery, in the hope winning could expand her legal rights to her father&#x27;s works and physical property. Eventually a court ruled that the will was a forgery, although in practical terms this ruling changed nothing concerning control of the Kerouac estate.

==Novels==

Kerouac published three semi-autobiographical novels, &quot;Baby Driver: A Story About Myself&quot; in 1981, &quot;Trainsong&quot; in 1988 and posthumously published &quot;Parrot Fever&quot; in 2005.

==Death==
On June 5, 1996, Kerouac died in Albuquerque, New Mexico, a day after her spleen was removed. She had suffered kidney failure five years earlier and was on dialysis.

<doc id="1282591" wikidata="Q4822177" url="?curid=1282591" title="Meyhane">
<text>A meyhane or pothouse (from Persian: میخانه translit. &quot;meykhaneh&quot;) is a traditional restaurant or bar in Turkey, Balkans, Azerbaijan and Iran. It serves alcoholic beverages like wine, rakı, vodka, or beer, with meze and traditional foods.

==Etymology==
&quot;Meyhane&quot; means &quot;wine house&quot; and is composed of two Persian words: &quot;mey&quot; (wine) and &quot;khāneh&quot; (house).

The word entered the Serbian and Bulgarian languages as &quot;mehana&quot; (механа) and in Macedonian as &quot;meana&quot; (меана). In Bosnian language the word &quot;mejhana&quot; is used. In Serbia, the word &quot;mehana&quot; is considered archaic, while in Bulgaria it refers to a restaurant with traditional food, decoration and music.

==Ottoman Empire==

Meyhane ( Lisān-ı Osmānī : ) appeared during the time of the Ottoman Empire and rapidly increased in popularity, becoming an institution that housed all kinds of people from different segments of society. In the beginning of the 1800s meyhane in Istanbul numbered around 500.

During the reign of Selim the Grim alcohol consumption in the Ottoman Empire increased particularly and meyhane started to appear more regularly as separate buildings built from masonry, with arched windows and doors and earth floors.

===Historical descriptions===
Ottoman journalist Basiretçi Ali Efendi (1838–1912) has described the Golden Horn coast and especially the meyhane around Balat in the beginning of the 1800s.

Author Sadri Sema (1880–1964) describes the pub culture in Istanbul in the beginning of the 1900&#x27;s as follows:

<text>The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love is a 1995 American comedy-drama film written and directed by Maria Maggenti and starring Laurel Holloman, Nicole Ari Parker, and Maggie Moore. It tells the story of two very different high school girls who fall in love.

==Plot==
Randy Dean is a 17-year-old student in her final year with poor grades, only one friend—Frank, a gay Latino—secret cigarette and marijuana habits, and a cashier&#x27;s job at a gas station with fellow worker Regina. Shunned by other students for her tomboyish personality and appearance, she spends most of her free time either by herself or in illicit meetings with her romantic partner Wendy, a married woman who drops by the gas station when it pleases her, even though Randy knows they are in a dead-end relationship. Her mother having abandoned her to devote her life to the anti-abortion movement, Randy lives with her lesbian aunt Rebecca and her girlfriend Vicky, as well as Rebecca&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Lena, who has no place to stay and is living with them until she finds somewhere else she can go to.

One day Evie Roy stops in a pristine Range Rover, unsure if her tires need air. Randy recognizes her from school and talks to her for the first time. Evie is an only child living with her well-off, cultured mother, Evelyn, who has a difficult relationship with her remarried husband. Randy and Evie start passing notes in school and hanging out with each other, although Evie does not reveal this to her cliquish friends. During this time, Randy is approached by Wendy&#x27;s jealous husband Ali at the gas station, who grabs Randy and warns her to stay away from his wife. Randy spends much of her time with Evie hanging out in meadows, trading music (opera and Mozart from Evie, punk rock from Randy) and talking. When Wendy next visits her, Randy rejects her, telling her she has a new girlfriend, Evie.

Evie breaks up with her boyfriend Hayjay after he complains of her distant attitude towards him. Later, apparently on a spur of the moment, she lends Randy a copy of Walt Whitman’s &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, which Randy starts to devour. Inviting Evie to her family’s small house for dinner one evening, Randy reveals to her that she has lived with Rebecca and Vicky since Randy&#x27;s devoutly religious mother abandoned her to devote all her time to an Operation Rescue-like group. On the front steps of Rebecca&#x27;s house, they kiss for the first time. Evie records it in her diary later, apparently wondering what it all means.

Randy and Evie experiment with how &quot;out&quot; they can be as lesbians, nervously holding hands at a local diner. Remembering Randy’s warning of how intolerant the town can be, Evie nevertheless breaks the news to her three closest friends. One girl is supportive (if confused), but the other two are hostile to the idea, with one of them saying, “God, Evie, if you were gonna turn gay you think you could at least choose someone who’s pretty.” before they all leave, including the supportive friend. Meanwhile, Randy&#x27;s grades continue to plummet and the school warns her she will not graduate; Randy hides this information from Rebecca. When Evie&#x27;s mother leaves on a business trip, the girls take the opportunity to cook a huge meal, indulging in wine and marijuana. That night, they make love, then fall asleep in Evie&#x27;s mother&#x27;s bed.

The next morning, it is Evie&#x27;s 18th birthday; Evelyn returns prematurely with presents for her, but is shocked by the mess in the kitchen and the rest of the house. Furiously searching the upstairs, she discovers Evie and Randy, but only realizes Randy is a girl when she runs past her on her way out. Rebecca, who has learned that Randy will not be graduating high school, goes over to go to Frank&#x27;s house with Vicky and Lena, where Randy had told them she would be staying the night. Rebecca threatens Frank until, panicked, he turns over Evie&#x27;s phone number. She calls, but Evie and Randy have already absconded and she is left talking to a furious Evelyn.

Evie and Randy, crying, scared and accusatory, take refuge in a motel. Randy finally calls Wendy, who comes out, pays for the room and tries to comfort the girls. Ali sees her car in the parking lot, however, and comes bursting in, eventually attracting Evelyn, Rebecca, Vicky, Lena, Frank, and Evie&#x27;s three friends, who were driving past reading aloud from Rita Mae Brown’s &quot;Rubyfruit Jungle&quot; (apparently still processing Evie’s news). The movie ends with Randy and Evie kissing and hugging in the open motel room doorway while everyone else argues in the background at top volume.

==Cast==
==Production==
In 1992, Maria Maggenti started a script with an image in her head of a tomboy with love notes in her back pocket, gradually adding more characters such as the tomboy&#x27;s family and her love interest. Later, she realized this character was based on her first girlfriend. Maggenti&#x27;s script, which originated as &quot;a very dark story of teenage sexuality and [teenagers&#x27;] relationship to adults&quot;, grew until Maggenti briefly abandoned it in 1994.

However, the film&#x27;s future associate producer, Melissa Painter, convinced Maggenti to shop the story around as an independent film. Two producers wanted a pivotal element of the two love interests being from very different paths, so Maggenti added a scene that established the beginning of the girls&#x27; relationship. The producers were delighted with this, so Maggenti wrote a new script which she finished in eight days. She found she had surprised herself in that her script was now a comedic farce; the story wasn&#x27;t about gay love or coming out, but about first love between teenagers.
Shooting was completed in 21 days during the summer of 1994. Scenes taking place at Randy and Evie&#x27;s high school were filmed in divisions of Horace Mann School, in the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx.

Of the film&#x27;s ending being likened by audiences to a Hollywood romantic comedy, Maggenti said, &quot;A lot of people have mentioned to me that the shot looks like a marriage portrait… That final shot is actually a very ambivalent shot, leaving them at the threshold of adulthood, a relationship, their families, everything.&quot;

==Release ==
&quot;The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love&quot; debuted at the 1995 Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 1995 to good reviews. It was then given a limited theatrical release in the United States on June 16, 1995. It was also theatrically released in Australia on March 28, 1996, and in the UK on September 10, 1996.

== Critical reception ==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 80% from 20 reviews.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four and said it is &quot;warm-hearted, funny, and involving&quot; and &quot;the two leads are well-cast.&quot; Ebert lambasted the MPAA for giving the film an R rating for a love scene between two young women, arguing &quot;a [similar love scene] between a boy and a girl wouldn&#x27;t have qualified for the word &#x27;strong&#x27;; the MPAA is shocked by the homosexuality. The R rating is ironic when you reflect how much healthier and more thoughtful this film is than so much mindless, action-oriented &#x27;family entertainment,&#x27; and how likely it is to inspire conversation about its values.&quot;

Writing for &quot;Spin&quot;, Manohla Dargis said &quot;&quot;Two Girls in Love&quot;, charming and lighter than air, is a film that could easily be mistaken for an after-school special, save for one crucial point: the high-school sweethearts in this valentine are all woman.&quot;

The film won a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film – Limited Release in 1996. Its success launched the film careers of lead actresses Laurel Holloman, Nicole Ari Parker and Dale Dickey.

== Home media ==
After many years of the DVD for &quot;The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love&quot; being out-of-print, the film was digitally restored in 2022 with the assistance of the Sundance Institute and Strand Releasing. It was released on Blu-ray format on March 15, 2022. Its re-release was also screened at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival&#x27;s digital platform. It has been added to The Criterion Channel&#x27;s streaming lineup. On June 18, 2024, it was released on Netflix in the US for Pride Month.

<text>MLton is a whole-program optimizing compiler for the programming language Standard ML. MLton development began in 1997, and continues with a worldwide community of developers and users, who have helped to port MLton to several computing platforms. It is free and open-source software released under a Historical Permission Notice and Disclaimer. MLton was a participating organization in the 2013 Google Summer of Code.

MLton aims to produce fast executables, and to encourage rapid prototyping and modular programming by eliminating inefficiencies often associated with high-level features. It also aims to facilitate large-scale programming through the MLBasis system, simplifying modularity and management of namespaces. As a whole-program compiler, it is notable for lacking an read–eval–print loop interactive top-level, common among Standard ML environments.

MLton includes several libraries in addition to the Basis standard library including ML Language Processing Tools with an implementation of ANTLR, and MLRISC with code generators for reduced instruction set computers. It also implements features that aid in porting code from SML/NJ, one of the more popular SML implementations, including support for SML/NJ&#x27;s compiling manager.

<text>Heather Mitts Feeley (born Heather Blaine Mitts; June 9, 1978) is an American former professional soccer defender. Mitts played college soccer for the University of Florida, and thereafter, she played professionally in the Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer (WPS) league; for the Philadelphia Charge, Boston Breakers, Philadelphia Independence and Atlanta Beat. She is a three-time Olympic gold medalist, and was a member of the U.S. women&#x27;s national team. She played in four matches in the 2011 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, where the U.S. national team finished second. Mitts announced her retirement from soccer via Twitter on March 13, 2013.

==Early life==
Mitts was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on June 9, 1978, and began playing soccer at the age of six. From 1993 to 1996, she attended St. Ursula Academy in Cincinnati, where she played high school soccer and helped the team tally a 70-5-1 record during her time with the team. During her freshman season, the team won the state title. During her junior and senior years, Mitts earned all-state honors.

===University of Florida Gators===
Mitts received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, and played for coach Becky Burleigh&#x27;s Florida Gators women&#x27;s soccer team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) competition from 1996 to 1999. Mitts was part of the defensive line that helped the Gators win their first-ever NCAA Women&#x27;s Soccer Championship in 1998. She was named a third-team All-American in 1998 and a first-team All-American in 1999, and became the Gators&#x27; all-time record holder in appearances (95), starts (94), and minutes played (7,547). She graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in advertising in 2000. She was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a &quot;Gator Great&quot; in 2013.

==Club career==
===Tampa Bay Extreme, 2000===

Straight out of college, Mitts played for Tampa Bay Extreme of W-League in 2000 while waiting for the launch of the new Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association league.

===Philadelphia Charge, 2001-03===
Upon the WUSA&#x27;s launch and inaugural season in 2001, Mitts was drafted to the Philadelphia Charge. With the club, she appeared in twenty games (1,751 minutes) in the inaugural season and added two assists. Throughout her Charge career, Mitts appeared in fifty-one games (4,414 minutes) and recorded eight assists over three seasons. She was named as a WUSA All-Star in 2003. Unfortunately, after the 2003 season, the WUSA ceased operations.

===Central Florida Krush, 2005===
Mitts returned to the W-League in 2005, playing sparingly for Central Florida Krush while splitting her time between the United States Women&#x27;s National Team. She appeared in four games (360 minutes). 

===WPS Years, 2009–11===

Upon the introduction of Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer, Mitts and fellow USWNT players Angela Hucles and Kristine Lilly were allocated to the Boston Breakers on September 16, 2008. In the inaugural 2009 Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer season, Mitts appeared in nineteen games (all starts, 1,631 minutes) and added an assist. After the season, the Boston Breakers declared Mitts a free agent.

On October 14, 2009, Mitts signed with 2010 WPS expansion team Philadelphia Independence, marking her return to play professional soccer in Philadelphia following the demise of the WUSA&#x27;s Philadelphia Charge.

In January 2011, Mitts signed with the Atlanta Beat and played right defensive back during the 2011 season.

===NWSL, 2013===

In 2013, Mitts was allocated to the Boston Breakers in the new National Women&#x27;s Soccer League; however, she retired before the start of the season.

==International career==
Mitts has represented the United States women&#x27;s national soccer team in over 100 international matches. She is a three-time Olympic gold medalist (2004, 2008, and 2012).

On May 12, 2007, Mitts tore her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in an international friendly match with Canada. The injury put Mitts out of contention for the 2007 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup.

On May 9, 2011, Mitts was named to the U.S. roster for the 2011 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup tournament in Germany. She was also named to the U.S. roster for the 2012 London Olympics, and played all 90 minutes of the match against Colombia in group stage.

On March 13, 2013, Mitts officially announced her retirement from the national team as well as the Breakers. She serves as a sideline reporter for Philadelphia Union games and has become a team ambassador.

==Career statistics==

===International goals===
Mitts scored 2 goals in international matches, which are both game winners.

==Personal life==
Mitts has held a number of television commentary jobs. She has served as a studio soccer analyst for ABC, ESPN and ESPN2 during the 2003 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup and was a sideline reporter for several MLS broadcasts in 2005. In addition to broadcasting soccer, she also was a sideline reporter for American college football during fall 2005 for ESPN.

Mitts married NFL quarterback A. J. Feeley in February 2010. They have a son born in 2014, a daughter born in 2016, and a son born in 2018.

Mitts runs a soccer camp every year throughout the United States in which she teaches the basics of soccer including: dribbling, juggling, foot-skills, passing, receiving. These are one-day soccer camps that teach children to grasp the fundamentals of soccer and allow them to continue their growth and understanding of the sport.

<doc id="1282607" wikidata="Q7206362" url="?curid=1282607" title="Pocket-Greenhaven, Sacramento, California">
<text>Pocket-Greenhaven (also known as The Pocket) is a suburban community within the city of Sacramento, California, 5 miles south of downtown Sacramento. It is bordered by Interstate 5 on the east and a semi-circular &quot;pocket&quot; bend in the Sacramento River on the south, west, and north. The three exits into the Pocket-Greenhaven community off Interstate 5 are 43rd Avenue (southbound only), Florin Road, and Pocket/Meadowview Road. Entering the area from the South on Interstate 5, travelers pass a landmark water tower with the words &quot;Welcome to SACRAMENTO AMERICA&#x27;S FARM-TO-FORK CAPITAL&quot; painted on it, marking the southern boundary of the city of Sacramento. The water tower was originally blank and looked very much like a spaceship alongside wheat and barley fields. Pocket-Greenhaven is located in the 95831 ZIP code.

==Neighborhood residents==
The Pocket-Greenhaven neighborhood is in the Southwest area of Sacramento which is now primarily populated by upper, upper-middle, and middle-class families. Original homeowners are generally older and live in Pocket-Greenhaven&#x27;s periphery, while newer residents are typically younger and reside more centrally. Home construction in the neighborhood began in the early 1960s, and over the years, several noteworthy have resided within the community, including Hollywood Actor Eddie Murphy (whose then-wife Nicole Mitchell Murphy, is a Sacramento native), and members of the Sacramento Kings professional basketball team. Current Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (politician), a resident of Los Angeles County, maintains a home in the Greenhaven section of the district. Former State Senate President and current Sacramento mayor Darrell Steinberg resides in Greenhaven. Delaine Eastin, former Superintendent of Schools for California and Assembly member from Union City, CA lived in the Pocket section while serving as Superintendent but now resides in Davis, CA. The California Air Pollution Control Officers Association&#x27;s Executive Director Tung Le lives in the Pocket.

The Pocket-Greenhaven neighborhood is a low-crime neighborhood, overall. There are two private lakes and 18 public parks in the Pocket-Greenhaven neighborhood.

==Schools==
The main high school is John F. Kennedy High School, established in 1967. The School of Engineering and Sciences, a smaller middle and high (i.e. secondary) school, opened in 2010. Primary schools include Brookfield School, the Caroline Wenzel Elementary School (K-6), Genevieve Didion Elementary School (K-8), Pony Express Elementary School (K-6), Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School (K-8), Matsuyama Elementary School (K-6), John Cabrillo Elementary School (K-6), and Sam Brannan Middle School (7–8). Bear Flag Elementary school (K-6), the original elementary school serving the area since 1964, closed in 2007.

==Development and History==
Before settlement, the Pocket-Greenhaven area was a riparian forest with woods of deciduous broad-leaves growing beside the river and streams in the bend. The center of the bend is a few feet lower than sea level, and drainage was all toward the swampy, tule filled middle. The bend is 6.8 square miles, has highly fertile alluvium soil, and contains a clay pit that is now known as Lake Greenhaven or Greenhaven Lake. An early development name was Lake Greenhaven Shores.

Before Europeans came, the Maidu Native American Indian tribe most likely inhabited the bend in the summer months when they could fish and hunt. Longtime residents say the bend contains a number of mounds, suggesting that the Maidu also buried their dead here. John Sutter and his crew likely passed by the Pocket-Greenhaven area on their way to establishing New Helvetia and Sutter&#x27;s Fort. After the Gold Rush, immigrants and former miners began to inhabit the bend. Several Portuguese families were the first settlers to the area. They raised cattle, hogs, and chickens and grew wheat and barley in the fertile soil, and engaged in dairying.

For the most part, early white settlers did not buy land in the bend because it was considered to be swampland. The majority of the inhabitants found in the area before its development were Portuguese immigrants from a group of islands called the Azores as well as Chinese. This was a sparsely populated farming area until the mid-20th century when developers had a vision for this river community. Most were farmers who drained their farmland and produced lettuce, cabbage, grain, onions, potatoes, tomatoes, sugar beets, milo, spinach, and asparagus, and raised chickens, pigs and cows. They also had pear, walnut, and orange orchards and grew hay to be pressed for sale. These farmers were basically subsistence farmers, the crops were grown for their family&#x27;s survival. Later crops were sold to stores in downtown Sacramento and to miners during the Comstock Lode.

Other economic activities by the Portuguese included a gasoline service station owned by Frank Enos; Grangers Dairy, owned by the Seamas Family; Da Rosa Grocery store, owned by the Da Rosa family; Pimentel&#x27;s Ingleside Cafe owned by Tony Pimentel (this cafe is now known as &quot;The Trap&quot;); a slaughterhouse owned by Faustino Silva, and Frank &amp; George Rogers Trucking Co., which delivered hay and produce to customers. The Portuguese created their own schools, known as Upper and Lower Lisbon Schools so that their children could receive an education and at the same time stay close to their cultural roots.

Levees along the Sacramento River were built and maintained by the Portuguese. One major flood, the Edwards levee break in 1904, occurred while the Portuguese farmed the area. Ferries were then available to transport people to the town of Freeport and across the river to West Sacramento. Some rides were free, while others cost a quarter.

Within the bend, the Portuguese led their way of life as though they lived in the old country. They celebrated the Holy Ghost festas annually, attended their community church, St. Mary&#x27;s, every Sunday, and displayed a communal affection for a landscape that reminded them of their homeland. According to Mary Tash and her daughter Lucille Carter, in the old days people would leave their farming equipment on the corners of their parcels of land so that others could use the equipment. It was a community of trust and helping others through difficult times that is less apparent in today&#x27;s society.

The Pocket-Greenhaven area had a brickyard within its boundaries. The Sacramento Brickyard Co. was established in 1854 and was considered to be the first brickyard in Northern California. In its earlier days, Chinese migrant laborers dug clay out of the clay pit and hauled it by mule to the brickyard. The brickyard was strategically placed next to the river so bricks could be transported easily to downtown Sacramento and San Francisco. Bricks from this yard were used for the foundation of the State Capitol. the Memorial Auditorium, and other well-known buildings in the region. After World War I, a sizeable Japanese population came to the bend and established a peaceful co-existence with the Portuguese community. The area continued on as a sparsely inhabited farming community until mid-century plans were beginning to be formulated for the area.

In 1958 the first developers, The Lincoln and Parker Development Co. bought the King and Zacharias ranches acquiring more than 700 acres in the area for a &quot;planned community&quot; known as &quot;Greenhaven &#x27;70.&quot; Before any subdivision could be approved by the city, however, Lincoln &amp; Parker was required to present their proposed plan for the Pocket&#x27;s entire 4,674 acres. This plan was known as the Pocket Area General Development Plan and included schools, a shopping center, two churches, a hospital with medical offices, a social-cultural center with a library and a theater, gas stations, a teen center, an open space pavilion, a heliport, a nursery, a motel, a hotel, various shops, a firehouse and a restaurant.

1959 Following the annexation of the area in 1959, the Greenhaven area was incorporated into the City of Sacramento. The city&#x27;s Planning Commission passed the general development plan for the area on July 11, 1961. On Sept. 7 of that year, the city council adopted the plan. After this, the land was assessed and zoned urban even though it was still agricultural, causing higher property taxes for the farmers. Many of the farmers could not keep up with these higher taxes due to less profitability in farming and had to sell their land.

1961–62 the new &quot;Greenhaven 70&quot;&quot;&quot; project was acclaimed in 1962 the &quot;Best Planned Community of the Year&quot; by the National Association of Home Builders. An advertisement from the same year recognizes Greenhaven 70 as &quot;the start of tomorrow&quot; and notes that this then-future community will present &quot;a new and better way of living for the entire family.&quot;
The name &quot;Greenhaven 70&quot; was coined as the development would center around the long greenbelt (known as Frank Seymore Park,) between Greenhaven and Havenside Drives on the East &amp; West and Riverside Blvd. and Gloria Drive on the North and South. The completion of this planned community was scheduled to be in 1970.

At that time the only way into the River community were Riverside Road, (now Blvd.) on the northern edge wrapping around to its southern edge. The southernmost edge would later be named Pocket Road.

A sales office was established at Greenhaven Drive and Riverside Blvd. to showcase the plans for the &quot;Greenhaven 70&quot; development and to sell the lots for semi-custom built homes &amp; duplexes. Parker, Lincoln, Dronberger, Harris, and Machado were some of the first builders to this newly planned community. Greenhaven Drive was the major through-fare which then ended at Moonlit Circle.

Ground breaking by home builders in the new &quot;Greenhaven 70&quot; community began in 1961–62 with the first home in 1961 being built at 9 Moonlit Circle. A spec home was constructed at 805 Royal Garden Ave. because of the home&#x27;s challenging floor plan, which later included a second story addition, was not immediately sold. Another at 819 Royal Garden Ave. was built for Bill Hallisey, a former conservationist for the state Department of Agriculture. 1962 saw 5–6 homes completed on the 6200–6300 block of Greenhaven Drive, and over 21 being completed on the north side of Moonlit Circle. McKay Construction Co. purchased continuous lots on Moonlit Circle and built homes on almost the entire street, some of the residents were concerned that these houses would be tract houses and would detract from the standards of the original plans for the area. The rest of the area was still rambling fields.

Some of the first original homeowners of &quot;Greenhaven 70&quot; were:
(1)Antone &quot;Tony&quot; Terra, (2)Bob Bos, (3)Norman Greenslate, (4)Bob Dias, (5)Richard Corum, (6)Even Zacharias, (7)Ellsworth &quot;Jack&quot; Zacharias (8)Norman Magee, (9)The Files Family, (10)The Parsons Family and (11)The Schumacher Family, and on the lake for Greenhaven&#x27;70 the Gould Family, the Robert Stein Family, The Dr. Donald Carson Family, The George Heringer Family, The Chan Family, The Yuen Family.

With the signing of sales contracts for Greenhaven 70 lots, the purchasers were required to sign an agreement that listed restrictions pertaining to the building and maintenance of their homes. The establishment of the Greenhaven Homeowners Association was formed to enforce the subdivision&#x27;s restrictions, underground utility and telephone lines would be installed making it so no overhead wiring to homes or television antennas would be visible. This agreement required property owners to place their television antennas either horizontally across the lower part of their rooflines or set them inside their attic, closest to the location of their main television set. To avoid unsightly appearances, garage doors were not to be left open and automobile were not to be parked on streets for extended periods of time nor were cars to be mechanically worked on anywhere on those streets.
Residents with motor homes were required to park these vehicles behind the frontage, fenced area on their property. Items such as basketball standards were not permitted anywhere on the fronts of the homes or along the streets, and garbage cans were required to be kept behind fenced areas and to not be visible from the streets. Distances from the sidewalks to the fronts of homes were standardized, along with no two driveways being allowed to be located side by side. Whenever there was an infraction of any rule, the objecting homeowner would inform the association of the violation, so that the association could ensure a correction.
The Greenhaven Cabana Club at 6207 Riverside Blvd. a private swim club for residents was opened. Through the signing of the sales contracts and the restrictions papers, homeowners were entitled to a membership. Dues for upkeep and other expenses of the club were paid by home owners. A second Cabana Club – Greenhaven Cabana Club South – was later opened at 6615 Gloria Drive.

1963–65 saw a large number of homes being completed on Parklin Ave, Royal Green Ave, Starlit Circle, Royal Garden Ave. Streets were added on the west side of Seymore Park and building began on Lakeshore, Shoreline and Spingbrook Circles. Bear Flag Elementary School was opened in 1964–65 at the end of the park at 6620 Gloria Drive. The plan for the area also included pedestrian bridges for the safety of school children and residents on thoroughfare streets such as Riverside Boulevard and the future Gloria Drive extension. In 1967 John F. Kennedy High School on Gloria Drive opened its doors to the neighborhood. The proposed addition of the first apartment complexes in the late 1960s on the corners of Greenhaven Drive and extending East and West on Riverside Blvd. was met with some opposition of homeowners even though they were included in original area plans, fearing they would detract from the safety and security that all had moved there to enjoy. Home building continued to extend southward on Greenhaven Drive past Gloria Drive as the street continued in the mid-1960s into the 1970s. As homes continued to be built towards the south on Greenhaven Drive and Havenhurst Ave. a sub-area was coined called &quot;Green Acres.&quot; The north section of Greenhaven 70 was completed prior to its southern portion. During the final stages of the building of the last homes on the subdivision&#x27;s north side, By that time, the proposed shopping center for the subdivision had been revised, because the city council had decided to nullify this small shopping center in favor of the much larger Florin Mall on Florin Road.

Late 1960s-1970s

The building of homes was a slower process in the Greenhaven Lake area. This portion of the area grew as streets were added and paved and model homes were opened for inspection. The Greenhaven Marina, which was proposed in the subdivision&#x27;s original plan, was later rejected by the Army Corps of Engineers, because of the need to cut into the levee, which would create a greater possibility of flooding in the area. Another portion of the subdivision&#x27;s original plan that was later rejected was the greenbelt around Lake Greenhaven. Kermit Lincoln filed for bankruptcy in the late 1960s, which resulted in Harold Parker and Lincoln splitting up their remaining assets, which included lots that were designated for apartments in the Riverside Boulevard section of the subdivision. The proposed greenbelt around what was to become Lake Greenhaven was affected by these turn of events and the greenbelt area was offered back to the city for a parkway. However, the city declined this offer, which resulted in this area being zoned for large lakefront lots. The old brickyard closed on January 3, 1971 due to encroaching suburban development and the selling of surrounding parcels which became Greenhaven Lake. These custom built lakefront homes would develop their own &quot;Lake Greenhaven Homeowners Association.&quot; Because the greenbelt was not going to be enjoyed by all the residents who had planned on it for relaxation and entertainment purposes, the surveyor pegs for designated lots suddenly disappeared late one evening. Jack Parker, manager of Greenhaven 70, informed residents near the greenbelt area that this action was unacceptable and costly to L &amp; P. Unfortunately for L &amp; P, after a second set of surveyor pegs were placed on these lots, the dastardly event reoccurred much to the consternation of Jack, who became furious by the event and demanded retribution. Fortunately for the property&#x27;s developer, after the third set of pegs was placed on this property, the pegs remained without an incident. But an ongoing disappointment remained in the minds of those original residents who purchased lots in the subdivision and were promised this special place to relax and enjoy.

The Lake Association published a newsletter affectionately titled The Seagull which Dr. Bernard Kitt largely wrote and edited with an air of fun and conviviality and great humor. The Seagull connected neighbors to Association sponsored events such as annual regattas, paddleboat races and fishing derbies, and pot lucks which brought residents together with a sort of tongue-in-cheek take on much larger tonier events in exclusive locations. By the &#x27;80s no one seemed to take the helm and community events mostly ended.

1970s

In 1969, a large billboard was erected on Riverside Blvd. advertising &quot;Greenhaven II.&quot; with more semi and custom built homes being built to the West towards what is now the intersection at Florin Rd. Bill Parker, who was the son of Harold Parker, was responsible for the remaining portion of Greenhaven 70 in the mid-1970&#x27;s. All of the proposed 1,600 homes, which were mentioned in the original Greenhaven 70 plan, were eventually completed. And because of the loss of the marina, the plan for 1,200 apartment buildings was exceeded. The final portion of Greenhaven 70 was sold and completed by Morrison Homes, which constructed houses and streets in the loop street pattern in accordance to the original plan for the area. The 1970s saw the addition more small shops, and a supermarket on Riverside Dr and Florin Rd. several apartment complexes, and the areas first condominium development called &quot;Roundtree&quot; on Florin Rd. and Gloria Drive. In the mid 1970s, the section of I-5 which gave Greenhaven direct freeway access was completed with entrances and exits at Seamas &amp; 43rd Aves. After the completion of Greenhaven 70, which is today known by its shortened name of Greenhaven, Bill Parker continued to work as a land developer in other notable areas. Regardless of the changes and disappointments of some features of Greenhaven 70 that did not materialize, many residents to the original area are still proud to call Greenhaven 70 their home.

1980s-1990s &quot;The Pocket&quot;

The major building boom came to the neighborhood in the 1980&#x27;s and early 90&#x27;s with homes and subdivisions popping up yet further South and West, filling the entire &quot;Pocket&quot; with gated communities of custom built homes, duplexes, condominiums, apartment complexes, the addition of several parks, schools, small business and yet another private lake. It is during this time that the area became referred to as &quot;the Pocket Area.&quot; Florin Rd. was extended into the area, during this time Greenhaven Drive was extended through the entire area coming to an end just past Pocket Rd. The Interstate 5 freeway added 2 more on-ramps and off-ramps for the area, Florin Rd. and Pocket Rd. bring the total freeway access points to a total of four. By 1986 the last Portuguese farming family sold their land to Lincoln/Parker &amp; Powell/Teichert Development Co. The Dutra House located on Pocket Road and Greenhaven Drive was historically preserved, largely by the Parker Development Co. (formerly Lincoln &amp; Parker), and now serves as a Title Company. The Pocket-Greenhaven area is a dense suburban community which now completely fills the semi-circular bend of the Sacramento River.

<text>Taryn Manning (born November 6, 1978) is an American actress and singer. She is best known for portraying Tiffany &quot;Pennsatucky&quot; Doggett in the Netflix original series &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot; (2013–2019), Cherry in &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; (2008–2010), Nola in &quot;Hustle &amp; Flow&quot; (2005) and Janeane in &quot;8 Mile&quot; (2002).

==Early life==
Taryn Manning was born in Falls Church, Virginia, the daughter of Bill Manning, a musician, and his wife, Sharyn Louise (née White). Manning&#x27;s parents divorced when she was two months old. She and her brother Kellin were raised by their mother in Tucson, Arizona. Manning grew up living in a trailer park with her brother and single mother, who supported the family on a strict income: &quot;My mom didn&#x27;t buy herself a new pair of shoes and a new outfit until I moved out ... Literally when I asked my mom for a dollar I got one single dollar.&quot; In spite of the family&#x27;s financial troubles, her mother was able to enroll Manning in karate, dance, and acting classes. When Manning was 12, her family relocated to Encinitas, California. Two years later, her father died by suicide.

In 2001, Manning auditioned for the musical reality television show Popstars USA on the WB. In 2003, Manning and her brother Kellin formed the band Boomkat. The band first signed a major label deal with American Idol producer Randy Jackson, but the deal fell through. Robbie Robertson then signed them to DreamWorks Records, which was Boomkat&#x27;s label from 2002 to 2004.

==Personal life==
As of 2020, Manning resides in Palm Springs, California. In 2017, Manning stated she prefers men and does not identify as lesbian, though she has dated women.

Manning was aboard JetBlue Flight 292 when it made an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport on September 21, 2005, after the nose gear jammed in an abnormal position. No one was injured. She stated that &quot;it was the most surreal, out-of-body experience I ever had.&quot;

===Legal and personal issues===
On October 12, 2012, Manning was arrested for assaulting her personal assistant and makeup artist, Holli Hartman. Hartman, who resided in Manning&#x27;s apartment at the time, declined to prosecute. Manning&#x27;s lawyer cited Hartman as saying that she and Manning loved each other and wanted the ordeal to be over. In November 2012, Manning accepted a plea bargain of one day of community service and good behavior for the next six months, after which the case would be closed.

In November 2014, Manning was arrested for violating a restraining order and making criminal threats against girlfriend Jeanine Heller. In 2015, Manning accused Heller of harassment. Heller was sentenced to four months in jail for violating the conditions of her plea bargain. Prior to their relationship souring, Heller and Manning lived together at Heller&#x27;s New York residence. In 2016, Manning was found to have fabricated contact violations, and as a result Heller had been falsely arrested and imprisoned via forced plea deal. In 2020 Heller was awarded damages for an undisclosed amount from the Manhattan District Attorney and New York State Supreme Court.

In 2016, Manning was again accused of attacking girlfriend Hollianne Hartman. Hartman sought a domestic restraining order against Manning but was denied due to jurisdictional issues. The attack was one of several that Hartman claimed to have suffered, with the most recent alleged abuse occurring in late 2015 at Manning&#x27;s Manhattan apartment. Manning&#x27;s lawyer stated that the application for a restraining order was preceded by stalking and theft charges filed against Hartman and was intended as a distraction from those charges.

In 2016, Manning filed a lawsuit against the state of New York claiming she was falsely arrested in 2014. A Manhattan judge dismissed the case stating Manning&#x27;s claims “lacked merit” and no such violation occurred.

In 2019, Manning claimed she was &quot;epically hack[ed]&quot; and the victim of &quot;cyber-criminals&quot; and &quot;cyberbullying&quot; after several disturbing Instagram posts included disparaging remarks about the cast of &quot;Orange is the New Black&quot;.

=== Substance abuse issues ===
Manning has a history of alcoholism. In 2016, &quot;Orange is the New Black&quot; producers threatened to remove Manning from the show and required her to enter a drug rehabilitation facility for treatment after her alcohol use began to interfere with production of the series. Manning, defying production orders, refused treatment and left rehab after one day.

In 2023, Manning caused concern when she posted a series of erratic content to her social media including a video of her inebriated behind the wheel of a car detailing her affair with a married man.

<doc id="1282626" wikidata="Q7487120" url="?curid=1282626" title="Shalabi Effect">
<text>Shalabi Effect is a mostly instrumental band from Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The band was originally formed in 1996 as a duo composed of Anthony Seck and Sam Shalabi. Shalabi is an Egyptian-Canadian musician who is also the founder of Swamp Circuit, Detention, Nutsak, The Dwarfs of East Agouza, Moose Terrific and the orchestra Land of Kush. Seck is a filmmaker and member of the supergroup Valley of the Giants.

==History==
Shalabi and Seck independently released their first recording, a self-titled limited-edition cassette, in 1998. They then added Montreal artist and musician Alexandre Saint-Onge on double bass, and Will Eizlini on tablas and recorded the song &quot;Aural Florida&quot; at Red Rocket Studios in Montreal. The 36-minute song was meant to be half of a split CD with Godspeed You! Black Emperor, produced by Alien8. Instead, Alien8 became their label and they recorded &quot;Aural Florida&quot; for a second time at Sound of Sound of One Hand Studios in Ottawa, along with several other songs. The result was the two-CD album &quot;Shalabi Effect&quot;, which was released in 2000. The album continues in the tradition of live improvisation based on Middle Eastern modes but with a more experimental approach. It also includes strange semi-broken electronics and a variety of odd instruments, most of which were lying around in the studio where it was recorded.

Returning from touring the United States in the autumn of 2000, the group stepped into the studio for the third time. This time with a mind to create an EP release that captured the mood of the tour. In fact the EP, entitled, &quot;The Trial of St. Orange&quot;, has a great deal more varied material, including a drum &#x27;n bass mix. &quot;Pink Abyss&quot;, dubbed by the band as their &quot;pop&quot; record, was released in January 2004. In 2005, they released their fourth album, &quot;Unfortunately&quot;.

On July 18, 2007, Anthony Seck was a guest, and music from the Shalabi Effect was featured on an unscheduled &quot;technical test&quot; episode of Tom Green Live. Anthony Seck was again featured on Tom Green Live in March 2008 in a segment called &#x27;Shalabi with Cheese&#x27;.

<text>Sutton or Sutton-in-the-Isle is a village and civil parish in the county of Cambridgeshire in England, near the city of Ely. The &quot;in-the-Isle&quot; suffix refers to the fact that the village is part of the Isle of Ely, once an island in the Fens and also an administrative county until 1965.

The village location on the high ground of the Isle of Ely provides commanding views across the surrounding low-lying fens.

==History==

The village was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, identified as &quot;Sudtone&quot;. There were then 9 sokemen, 8 villeins (each with 7.5 acres), 15 cotters and 7 serfs.

In 1109, the charter 51 of Bishop Hervey included &quot;Suttune&quot; in the lands recorded as being conferred upon the Cathedral Priory of Ely. According to the Ely Diocesan Register, the Manor of Sutton was established in 1292 and belonged to the Priory. In 1312, Sutton was granted the right to hold a street market each Thursday; this was held on the broader part of the High Street, outside what is now the One Stop Shop. During the 14th century, the Sutton resident Reginald de Beringhale also became a major landowner, further developing his father&#x27;s programme of land acquisition.

The vicarage of St Andrew&#x27;s was instituted in 1254, and the re-building of the church started between 1350 and 1360. It was completed by 1388. With two octagons atop each other crowning its square tower, it is reminiscent of Ely Cathedral, from whom it enjoyed patronage. It has a distinctively shaped tower that is often described as being in the shape of a pepper pot. Several non-conformist chapels once also existed in the village. These included a Methodist chapel constructed in 1790, following a visit by John Wesley in 1774, and a Baptist chapel built in the same century. Both of these closed in recent decades, leaving the Anglican church as the sole place of worship.

By 1599, the village was so prosperous that it became known as &quot;Golden Sutton.&quot; In 1800, it had a population of about 950, quickly rising to 1,862 by 1851.

Although a school had been established in the village in 1579, under William Heye, it was not until 1860 that the first purpose-built school building opened. John Taylor was the first headmaster for the boys, and his wife was the headmistress for the girls. The school continues to this day and has expanded to serve the village&#x27;s growing population.

A railway station was opened in 1866, with the Great Eastern Railway inaugurating passenger-train services to Ely on 16 April. The railway line was later extended round the edge of the fen to Earith Bridge and onto St Ives, with this branch opening on 11 May 1878. The combined line was then reorganised to become the Ely and St Ives Railway. The branch to St Ives was closed on 6 October 1958, followed by the line to Ely on 13 July 1964, as part of the Beeching Axe.

In 1942, with the increase in bomber operations in World War II, work began on RAF Mepal between the villages of Sutton and Mepal. 
The airfield opened in 1943 and remained operational for the rest of the war.

During the 1960s, the Sutton Gault hamlet was the site of one of the world&#x27;s first tracked hovercraft, designed by Eric Laithwaite. A linear induction motor propelled this hovertrain and ran alongside the Old Bedford River, on a one-mile section of air-cushion trackway.

In 1984, Sutton Village was given a bypass. In 2002, it won the East Cambs, Cambridgeshire and Calor England and Wales Village of the Year awards.

The village has known a variety of businesses throughout its history. It was once well known for fruit-growing, but has also been a place for cheese production. Later, it manufactured road sweepers, and now it hosts a monthly auction of construction and agricultural equipment, which is the largest of its kind in Europe. In addition, a straw-burning power station was opened in 1996.

== Governance ==

Sutton is a civil parish with an elected Parish council. Services include community meeting rooms, sports and recreation facilities, a bus shelter, a cemetery, local planning consultation, a community time bank, play area, street lighting, grants to local organisations and a war memorial. Parish council meetings are usually held in either The Glebe or The Pavilion on a Tuesday evening.

The village was part of Ely Rural District council from 1894 until 1974. East Cambridgeshire District Council (ECDC) was formed in 1974 with administration buildings in Ely. The district council collects taxes, provides services such as building regulations and local planning, leisure and tourism, handles issues strategic to the district, and many other services. The village is part of Sutton ward, which includes some smaller neighbouring villages and is represented by two district councillors. East Cambridgeshire is in turn part of Cambridgeshire County Council which has administration buildings in Cambridge. The county council provides county-wide services such as major road infrastructure, fire and rescue, libraries and heritage, and strategic planning. The village is part of the Sutton electoral division, represented by a county councillor who also represents a number of smaller neighbouring villages.

The Parish Council developed a Neighbourhood Plan for the parish, which was adopted following a referendum on 2 May 2019, with 90.5% of the votes supporting the plan.

==Village amenities==

Currently the village has a One Stop shop, a Co-Op shop, a pharmacy, a hairdressers, a barbers, an Indian restaurant and take-away, a Chinese take-away and chip shop, a fish and chip shop, a pub &quot;Chequers&quot;, a family run garage and a motor repair centre. There is also a GP surgery. The old butcher&#x27;s shop in the High Street became a deli, with seating for food and beverages. but closed in 2019.

Bus services link the village to Ely and Cambridge to the south and Chatteris to the north with a two hourly service during the daytime and no service in the evenings or on a Sunday.

The Glebe community centre provides a range of meeting rooms used by local community groups as well as being used for private hires such as wedding receptions. It is also the location of the Parish Office which is open between 10 am and 12 noon Monday to Thursday. The Community Room is located adjacent to the school and provides an additional meeting room used by a number of local groups including a monthly community café.

==Sports and recreation==

The village has a cricket club with its own grounds and cricket pavilion. Adjacent to the Brooklands Centre off the Brook, the Parish Council provides playing fields, a multi-use games area and a sports pavilion used by local football teams and other local sports groups. The village bowls club green is also next to the sports pavilion. The pavilion also hosts a weekly pensioners&#x27; lunch club. In nearby Stirling Way the Parish Council provides a children&#x27;s play area. Elsewhere on the south side of the village is the Recreation Ground, previously used for organised sporting events but now used as an informal recreation and dog walking area.

==New developments==

Linden Homes submitted a major planning application early in 2017. Concerns were raised about the impact of this development on village services such as the school and the GP surgery. East Cambridgeshire District Council refused an initial application for 77 homes but Linden Homes subsequently took this to appeal and were successful. Those homes are currently under construction with an outline application for a further 173 homes currently being considered by the District Council. This would lead to an overall development of 250 homes in accordance with the Neighbourhood Plan.

==Wider parish==
Sutton Gault (Bury Lane) is a part of the parish of Sutton-in-the-Isle. The name derives from the gault clay that has been extracted from there. It comprises a few houses and farms, a guest home, &quot;Grove Barn&quot; and an inn, &quot;The Anchor&quot;. The Old Bedford River and New Bedford River pass through Sutton Gault. The land between them, known as the Ouse Washes, a giant flood water reservoir which also forms part of an internationally important wetland habitat. When the flood water is very high the road through the Washes is impassible and closed to traffic.

The Americas, also known as The America or just America, is another part of the parish. Although it is treated as a separate settlement from the village of Sutton-in-the-Isle on some maps, most residents consider it part of the village and the equivalent of a street name. So far the origins of the name remain a mystery. It is known to have had its name since at least 1881 as it is mentioned in the census of that year, although the name could be much older.

<doc id="1282637" wikidata="Q4953694" url="?curid=1282637" title="Bracket racing">
<text>Bracket racing is a form of drag racing that allows for a handicap between predicted elapsed time of the two cars over a standard distance, typically within the three standard distances (1/8 mile, 1,000 foot, or 1/4 mile) of drag racing.

==Goal==

The effect of the bracket racing rules is to place a premium on consistency of performance of the driver and car rather than on raw speed, which in turn makes victory much less dependent on large infusions of money and more dependent on mechanical and driving skill. This includes reaction times, shifting abilities, and ability to control the car. Therefore, bracket racing (using the aforementioned handicapping system) is popular with casual weekend racers, some who even drive their vehicles to the track, race them, and then simply drive them home.

This format allows for wide varieties of cars to race against each other. While traditional drag racing separates cars into a wide variety of classes based on power and weight, bracket racing classes can be simpler and can accommodate any vehicle with basic technical/safety inspection. Race events organized in this way are sometimes called &quot;run-what-ya-brung&quot;.

==Format==

===Dial-in===
Each car chooses a dial-in time before the race, predicting the elapsed time the driver estimates it will take their car to cross the finish line. This is usually displayed on one or more windows so the starter can adjust the &quot;Christmas tree&quot; starting lights accordingly. The slower car in the race is given the green light before the faster car by a margin of the difference between their two dial-in times.

In principle, if both drivers have equal reaction times and their cars run exactly their posted dial-ins, both cars should cross the finish line at precisely the same time. In reality, this is an extremely rare occurrence. Measuring devices both at the start and at the end of the track post times down to 1/100000 of a second (0.00001s precision), which makes tied races almost impossible.

Some forms of bracket racing (NHRA Competition Eliminator, NHRA Stock groups) have cars classified by type, and the dial-in time is based on the type of car that is entered.

===Reaction time===
When a car leaves the starting line, a timer is started for that car. The difference between when the green light comes on and when the car actually leaves the starting line is called the &quot;reaction time&quot;. If a driver leaves before the light turns green, he/she is automatically red-lighted and disqualified for that round unless the opponent commits a more serious violation (crossing a track boundary line, timing block, or touching the barrier). Depending on the Christmas Tree being used, either the first car to redlight, or more recently with many events (including NHRA national events) with TruStart, the driver who has a worse red-light foul, is provisionally disqualified.

Sometimes, people incorrectly refer &quot;reaction time&quot; to the unrelated 60 foot takeoff time. The reaction time is merely an indication of how fast a &quot;driver&quot; reacted compared to when the green light came on. The 60 foot takeoff time is an indicator of how fast the &quot;vehicle&quot; started moving at the beginning of the race, regardless of the driver’s reaction time. If the driver launched the car with too much power for the available traction, he will have wheelspin and correspondingly will have a longer time to cross the 60 foot barrier if he were to drive with more finesse.

===Breaking out===
Breaking out is when a racer manages to cross the finish line in less time than the one he dialed-in beforehand.

* If only one car &quot;breaks out&quot;, it is disqualified and the other one wins by default.
* If both cars break out, the one closer to the dial-in time wins.
* A foul start, crossing the boundary line or wall, or failure to be at post-race inspection override any breaking out violations.
* Not all bracket racing classes have breaking out (NHRA Competition Eliminator).
* Based on a driver&#x27;s competition licence or a chassis certification, an absolute limit may be imposed. A car going faster than the absolute limit may be automatically disqualified.

===Absolute Breakout===
An absolute breakout that is imposed based on the licensing of the vehicle and/or the driver. Depending on class, a driver may be given one warning, but in most cases they are immediately disqualified. Violations involving absolute breakout include:

* A &quot;car&quot; goes faster than the &quot;legal certification limit of the chassis&quot;. Examples include:
** A dragster that is not certified for Top Alcohol Dragster is faster than 5.99 seconds required for Top Alcohol Dragster certification.
** A full bodied car that is certified for 7.50 seconds goes faster than 7.49 seconds.
** A stock sedan with just a standard three-point harness goes faster than 11.49 seconds (five point harness required at that speed).
** A vehicle goes 150 mph (240 km/h) or faster in the quarter-mile and does not have a parachute, required for cars that speed or faster.
* A driver goes faster than the legal limit of his competition licence. Examples include:
** A driver&#x27;s competition licence only is for cars 7.50 to 8.99 seconds, and his car goes faster than 7.49 seconds.
** In &quot;Junior Dragster&quot;, a driver goes faster than the absolute limit imposed by his competition licence or is warned two times during a meeting:
*** Drivers age 5 cannot be faster than 20.00 seconds in the eighth mile during their solo passes.
*** Drivers 6-7 are restricted to 13.90 in the eighth mile, with a warning at 13.70 (or 7.00 in the sixteenth mile), with an absolute limit of 13.50 (or 6.80).
*** Drivers 8-9 are restricted to 11.90 in the eighth mile, with a warning at 11.70 (or 6.10), with an absolute limit of 11.50 (or 5.90).
*** Drivers 10-12 are restricted to 8.90 in the eighth mile, with a warning at 8.70 (or 4.70), with an absolute limit of 8.50 (or 4.50).

Examples:

This eliminates any advantage from bending the rules by putting a slow dial-in time on the windshield to get a head start. However, some racers will purposely dial a slower time and then let off of the throttle or use their brakes near the end of the track in an attempt to use strategy to win the race rather than relying on the car to run the dial in.

===Bracket Racing Strategy===

Bracket racing boils down mainly into one thing; putting up the best &quot;package&quot;. The best package is technically the winner in every drag race. A &quot;package&quot; is : package = drivers reaction time + deviation from the dial-in.
For example:

Driver A has a reaction time of 0.025 and his car runs 9.653 on a 9.64 dial in. His package = 0.025 + (9.653-9.64) = 0.038

Driver B has a reaction time of 0.005 and his car runs 10.684 on a 10.66 dial in. His package = 0.005 + (10.684-10.66) = 0.029

In this scenario driver B wins despite his car running further off the number. But we can deduce even more than just that he won; we can see that he won by a (0.038 - 0.029) = 0.009 finish margin which is about 22 inches at about 140 mph.

The formula used to calculate the margin of victory is :

17.6 * finish margin * behind vehicle mph = finish margin in inches

Professional (and some amateur) bracket racing has evolved over the years into a drivers&#x27; sport. It used to consist of trying to get a good reaction time then hoping the car ran near the number. Drivers would avoid breaking out like the plague, dialing their cars 0.01 faster than it had ever gone before.

Now it has turned into a chess match between two drivers, guessing each other&#x27;s next move. The race starts in the staging lane where drivers get ready to race, and decide what dial in to put on their cars. This is arguably the most important part of a bracket race: making sure of being able to &quot;run the number&quot;. In other words, drivers make sure they can go as fast as their dial in says they can. Everyone has a different strategy, but any strategy has its flaws and can be beaten; that why the best strategy is one that includes many different strategies and cannot be predicted.

===Red Light and other fouls===

If a car leaves the starting line before the green light comes on, a foul is recorded (a red-light start), and that car is provisionally disqualified. Traditionally, only the first car to foul start is shown the red light; an automatic green light is shown in the other lane at the appropriate time. Since 2016, many tracks (and the NHRA) now use TruStart, which is new code written to the Christmas Tree. When the first car launches, a green light will be initially shown, even if the driver committed a foul start. Once the second driver leaves, if one driver has a negative reaction time (foul start), that driver&#x27;s lane will be shown a red light. If both lanes show a negative reaction time, only the lane with the worse negative reaction time will be shown a red light (left lane -.021 and right lane -.020, red light on the left lane only). Another form of foul is to cross the dividing line between the two lanes, or the line at the edge of the racing surface, both of which negates a red light foul. A foul is worse than a break out; one car can break out but if the other car fouls, the car that breaks out advances to the next round unless it is an absolute breakout (in certain classes only). If both cars foul, the lesser of the violations is the winner; a break-out is the least serious violation, then a red light, crossing the boundary line at the edge of the surface, crossing the dividing line between the lanes, leaving before the tree is started, failure of technical inspection after the run, and then absolute breakout.

Both cars are disqualified in double fouls if both competitors cross either boundary line (edge of surface or dividing lane between lanes), but if one car has crossed the boundary line and the other car must cross the line to avoid the car that first crossed, the car that crossed the line to avoid a collision is automatically declared the winner and advances. Only one car is disqualified if both competitors commit different fouls of the other type. Both drivers are disqualified if they leave before the tree is started, but if video evidence can show which of the two drivers left first, only the first driver is disqualified. If one car leaves before the tree is started, the other driver is automatically the winner, regardless of a further red light or crossing either boundary line (which by rule becomes a single run with a &quot;no time, took green light&quot; win status). In a final, in case of a double disqualification on boundary lines or leaving before the tree is started, only the first driver to foul (cross the boundary line, leave before tree started) will be tagged.

In any single run, once a car is staged (bye run or opponent unable to stage), it automatically wins and does not need to cross the finish line. The driver will not be shown a red light for a foul start, as the red light is automatically placedin the other lane. However, if the car crosses a boundary line, the run will be disqualified. 
In such cases, the car will be scored as if it did not finish (&quot;no time, took green light&quot;).

<text>The Shanghai Ballet Company is the state ballet company for Shanghai. This regional dance troupe organized in 1966 (though they did not settle on the name &quot;Shanghai Ballet&quot; until 1979). They perform a blend of traditional and Western dance styles. The troupe is particularly well known for their performances of &quot;The White Haired Girl&quot;.

== History ==

The troupe tours internationally. During the 1977 and the 1984 tours, members of the troupe defected, one in the US and one in Canada.

The Shanghai Ballet was formally renamed in 1979 at the base of &quot;The White-haired Girl&quot; performing team, which won the Gold Medal of the Best Classical Dance Works of the 20th Century in China.

In August 2013, the Company interpreted &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; for its first show ever in the UK, at the London Coliseum. In December 2015, the Shanghai Ballet Company played &quot;The Greatest Swan Lake in the World&quot;, directed by Derek Deane, at the Stardust Theatre in Amsterdam. In August 2016, the Company played &quot;Echoes of Eternity&quot;, directed by Patrick de Bana, at the London Coliseum. In January 2020, the Shanghai Ballet made its debut in New York at Lincoln Center, dancing Swan Lake.

According to Andrea Beck, writer of &quot;The Diplomat&quot;, showcasing the Shanghai Ballet Company in London is a soft power diplomatic instrument for China to smoothen its image in the UK.

== Repertoire ==

With a history of thirty year, the Shanghai Ballet created and staged ballet Jane Eyre (Patrick de Bana),The Butterfly Lovers (Xin Lili), A Sigh of Love (Bertrand d’At), The Last Mission of Marco Polo (Jose Martinez), Shanghai Grand Theatre’s version The Nutcracker (Derek Deane).

Besides, the repertoire of the company includes Swan Lake (Derek Deane), Romeo and Juliet (Derek Deane), Coppelia (Pierre Lacotte), La Sylphide (Jean-Paul Gravier), The Nutcracker (Tetsutaro Shimizu), Giselle, Don Quixote, Balanchine and Beyond, The Ode of Joy—Gala Performance.

== Dancers ==

Zhenrong Chen (陳真榮) is a principal dancer for the Shanghai Ballet Company since he was 12. He was awarded with the Bronze Medal in the 1st National Ballet Competition of China in 1985 and the prize for Encourage in Shanghai Dance Competition in 1991. He danced leading roles in Swan Lake, Giselle, Romeo and Juliet, the Nutcracker, the White-haired Girl, The Butterfly Lovers, Coppelia, La Sylphide, Sleeping Beauty, The Latest Time, etc. He has also appeared in a Shanghai TV dancing show.

Since its founding, many young dancers of the company have won total of 37 medals in various international dance competitions. The Shanghai Ballet is active in cooperation and cultural exchange with the artists and companies both abroad and at home. The company not only tours nationwide but also has visited many countries and regions, including the US, UK, Canada, France, Spain, Norway, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Finland, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.

<doc id="1282659" wikidata="Q787377" url="?curid=1282659" title="Matra Durandal">
<text>The Durandal is an anti-runway penetration bomb developed by the French company Matra (now MBDA), designed to destroy airport runways and exported to several countries. A simple crater in a runway could be filled in without issue, so the Durandal uses two explosions to displace the concrete slabs of a runway, thus making the damage to the runway far more difficult to repair. The bomb is named after a mythical medieval French sword.

==Overview==

Designed to be dropped from low altitudes, the bomb&#x27;s fall is slowed by a parachute. The maximum release speed is and the minimum release altitude is . When the bomb has reached a 40° angle due to the parachute&#x27;s drag, it fires a rocket booster that accelerates it into the runway surface. The primary charge explodes after the weapon has penetrated the concrete and drives the secondary charge even deeper. The secondary charge then explodes after a one-second delay. Later production weapons have a programmable fuse that can delay the secondary detonation up to several hours.

The weapon can penetrate up to of concrete, and creates a crater deep and approximately in diameter. In addition, concrete slabs around the crater are disturbed in an area approximately in diameter. The disturbed slabs are displaced up to above the original surface, making repair more difficult than the simple crater from a conventional bomb.

==Service history==
There is a persistent story that the first use of the current Matra Durandal was by Israeli Mirages during the Six-Day War. This is inaccurate, as this war took place ten years before the Durandal was first available on the arms market. Rather, the prototype French/Israeli anti-runway weapon program which cratered Egyptian runways in 1967 is related, but distinct from the Durandal. The Israeli weapon used rockets rather than parachutes to brake over the target. The Matra development branch was in development from 1971 on and would form the basis for the Durandal which uses parachute braking.

The Durandal was adopted by the US in a slightly modified form (with a steeper impact angle and a higher 630 knot deployment speed) as the BLU-107/B in the 1980s, and carried by F-111 and F-15E strike aircraft.

In addition, the Durandal is in service with Argentina, Turkey, and at least 14 other nations. The Durandal is not currently in the weapon inventory of the French Armée de l&#x27;Air

It was used by the US Air Force in Desert Storm, delivered by F-111E&#x27;s of the 20th Fighter Wing based in Turkey. 20th Wing flight commander Captain George Kelman said &quot;there is nothing better at destroying a runway than a Durandal.&quot;

It has been reported that China has developed its own anti-runway bombs, the Type 200A, using Durandals as models. In the 1980s, China purchased a number of Durandals from France.

<doc id="1282665" wikidata="Q640832" url="?curid=1282665" title="Durendal">
<text>Durendal, also spelled Durandal, is the sword of Roland, a legendary paladin and partially historical officer of Charlemagne in French epic literature. The sword is famous for its hardness and sharpness. Sources including &quot;La Chanson de Roland&quot; (&quot;The Song of Roland&quot;) state that it first belonged to the young Charlemagne. 

According to one legend, at the end of the Battle of Roncevaux Roland hurled the sword from him to prevent its being seized by the Saracens, and it came to rest in Rocamadour. A replica sword that was embedded in a rock face there was reported stolen in June 2024.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Durendal&quot; arguably begins with the French &quot;dur-&quot; stem, meaning &quot;hard&quot;, though &quot;enduring&quot; may be the intended meaning. Rita Lejeune argues that the name may break down into + , which may be rendered in English as &quot;strong scythe&quot; or explained in more detail to mean &quot;a scimitar or scythe that holds up, resists, endures&quot;. Gerhard Rohlfs suggests + , &quot;strong flame&quot; or &quot;[a flame] burns strongly from it&quot;.

The &quot;Pseudo-Turpin&quot; explains that the name &quot;&#x27;Durendal&#x27; is interpreted to mean [that] it gives a hard strike&quot; (). It has been argued that the &quot;Pseudo-Turpin&quot; offering a gloss of the meaning constitutes evidence that it was a name that was not readily understood in French.

One non-French etymology is Edwin B. Place&#x27;s attempt to construe it in Breton as , meaning &quot;blade [that] dulls cutting edge&quot; or &quot;blade [that] blinds&quot;. Another is James A. Bellamy&#x27;s Arabic etymology, explaining a possible origin of the sword&#x27;s name in (), meaning &quot;master of stone&quot;.

==Properties==
According to legend, the sword was capable of cutting through giant boulders with a single strike, and was indestructible.

==In the &quot;Chanson de Roland&quot;==
In &quot;La Chanson de Roland&quot; (&quot;The Song of Roland&quot;), the sword is said to contain within its golden hilt a tooth of Saint Peter, blood of Basil of Caesarea, hair of Saint Denis, and a piece of the raiment of Mary, mother of Jesus.

According to legend as recounted in the poem, at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass Roland took the rearguard to hold off Saracen troops long enough for Charlemagne&#x27;s army to retreat into France. He slew a vast number of enemies: wielding Durendal, he sliced the right arm of the Saracen king Marsile, decapitated the king&#x27;s son Jursaleu or Jurfaleu and put the one-hundred-thousand-strong army to flight. His mission accomplished, Roland then attempted to destroy Durendal by hitting it against blocks of marble, to prevent it from being captured by the Saracens, but the sword proved to be indestructible. Finally, mortally wounded, he hid it beneath his body as he lay dying along with the oliphant, the horn he had used to alert Charlemagne.

==Origins and previous ownership==
The sword has been given various provenances. Several of the works of the Matter of France agree that it was forged by Wayland the Smith, who is commonly cited as a maker of weapons in chivalric romances.

According to &quot;La Chanson de Roland&quot;, an angel brought Durendal to Charlemagne in the vale of Moriane, and Charlemagne then gave it to Roland. 

According to the 12th-century fragmentary &quot;chanson de geste&quot; known as &quot;Mainet&quot; (referring to the pseudonym that Charlemagne adopted in his youth), Durendal was once captured, but not kept, by the young Charlemagne when he fled to Spain. Young Charles (Mainés in the text) slays Braimant, obtaining his sword (Durendaus). This tale is better preserved in some non-&quot;chanson de geste&quot; texts, and in adaptations such as the Franco-Italian &quot;Karleto&quot;. According to the Low-German version &quot;Karl Mainet&quot;, the place of combat was near the vale of Moriane (Vael Moriale), near Toledo.

According to another 12th-century &quot;chanson de geste&quot;, the &quot;Song of Aspremont&quot;, the owner of Durendal just before Roland obtained it was a Saracen named Aumon, son of king Agolant. Young Roland mounted Naimes&#x27;s horse Morel without permission, and armed only with a rod, defeated Aumon, taking as spoils both the sword and the horse Veillantif.

These materials were combined in the Italian prose &quot;Aspramonte&quot; by Andrea da Barberino in the late 14th to early 15th century. That work stated that after young Carlo (Charlemagne) came into possession of Durindarda (Durendal) by killing Bramante in Spain, Galafro gave it to Galiziella, who then gave it to Almonte the son of Agolante (i.e., ). Galiziella is glossed as the bastard daughter of Agolante, making her Almonte&#x27;s half-sister. Durindana is eventually won by Orlandino (young Orlando).

Andrea da Barberino was a major source for later Italian writers. Boiardo&#x27;s &quot;Orlando innamorato&quot; traces the sword&#x27;s origin to Hector of Troy; it belonged for a while to the Amazonian queen Pantasilea, and was passed down to Almonte before Orlando gained possession of it. Ludovico Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; follows Boiardo, saying it once belonged to Hector of Troy, but that it was given to Roland by Malagigi (Maugris).

==Local lore==
Tradition has it that Roland&#x27;s Breach in the Pyrenees was created when Roland, attempting to break Durendal, instead cut a huge gash in the mountainside with one blow.

In Rocamadour, in the Lot department, a local legend holds that instead of dying with Durendal hidden under his body, Roland called on the Archangel Michael for assistance and was able to throw the sword several hundred kilometres across the border into France, where it came to rest in Rocamadour. There it was deposited in the chapel of Mary, but was stolen by Henry the Young King in 1183. Successive replicas have been stolen; most recently a sword fashioned from sheet metal was embedded in a cleft in a cliff wall, secured with a chain. That sword was reported stolen in June 2024.

==In popular culture==
A sword named Durendal appears in a number of fantasy video games. In &quot;Final Fantasy Legend III&quot; (1991) it&#x27;s one of four mystic swords (its name shortened to &#x27;Durend&#x27; due to character limitations). In the &quot;Super Sentai&quot; series &quot;Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger&quot; (1992). the monster Dora Knight wields a magic sword called Durandal. In the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; videogame series, Durandal is the name of the legendary claymore sword wielded by one of the characters. Durandal is the name of a character in &quot;Honkai Impact 3rd&quot;; her namesake is the super-AI Holy Blade Durandal, which takes the form of a sword. In &quot;Library of Ruina&quot; (2020), Durandal is the signature weapon of Roland, one of the main protagonists. A sword named Durandal is in &quot;Chained Echoes&quot; (2022), as well as a lesser known game, Days Bygone.

In &quot;Terraria&quot;, Durendal is a weapon that the player is able to craft, but it&#x27;s a whip rather than a sword. Durendal is the name of a spaceship in &quot;Xenosaga&quot; and of an organization in &quot;Front Mission 4&quot;. The name also appears in &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot; (2015).

A sword named Durendal also appears in literature. In the xianxia-inspired series of novels &quot;The Godking&#x27;s Legacy&quot; by author Virlyce, Durandal is the name of one of the main characters, a sentient sword that previously belonged to the legendary warrior-mage Roland. In &quot;The Dresden Files&quot; book series, Durendal is one of three powerful swords and is linked to the emotion of hope. In the light novel and anime series &quot;High School DxD&quot;, the historical Durandal that was first used by Roland is wielded by a current character.

Durandel is used as a name, although not of a sword, in the anime series Mobile Suit Gundam SEED, &quot;Macross Frontier&quot;, and &quot;Space Battleship Tiramisu&quot;, and in the live-action tokusatsu series &quot;Kamen Rider Saber&quot; (2020) and the spinoff &quot;Kamen Rider Sabela &amp; Durendal&quot; (2022). It is also the name of the AI guide and central character in the Marathon Trilogy of video games.

<text>Nuns&#x27; Island (officially Île-des-Sœurs; ) is an island located in the Saint Lawrence River that forms a part of the city of Montreal, Quebec. It is part of the borough of Verdun.

==History==

Originally called Île Saint-Paul in honour of the founder of Montreal, Paul de Chomedey, Sieur de Maisonneuve, the island was initially acquired in 1634 by Jean de Lauzon, future governor of New France. The island was included in the expansive seigneurie of La Citière on the south shore of the St. Lawrence. In 1664 he ceded the island in three equal parts to three prominent citizens of Ville-Marie: Jacques Le Ber, sieur de Saint-Paul et Senneville; Claude Robutel de Saint-André, sieur de La Noue; and Jean de la Vigne, who transferred his portion to Jacques Le Ber&#x27;s sister Marie in 1668. She, in turn, sold her share to her brother, leaving the island divided between the seigneuries of Saint-Paul and La Noue.

The nuns of the Congrégation de Notre-Dame acquired the seigneurie de La Noue in 1706. Following the British conquest, the other seigneurie was auctioned; the nuns purchased it too in 1769, becoming the sole owners of the island for the next 187 years. Their ownership would give the island its unofficial name, attested since the early 19th century.

The nuns farmed the island, building houses and agricultural buildings, and later hired women to help with raising livestock. Owing to a dispute between the congregation and the municipality of Verdun over taxes in the late 19th century, the island, which had no fixed link to the Island of Montreal, was made a municipality (L&#x27;Île-Saint-Paul) in 1899.

The nuns continued farming until 1956, when they sold the island to the Quebec Home and Mortgage Co. Ltd. In the same year, the provincial government merged it with Verdun. By that time the name Saint-Paul had fallen out of use, and the name &quot;île des Sœurs&quot; was officialized. The nuns entirely left the island in 1957.

The development of the island began in earnest with the opening of the Champlain Bridge in 1962. The urbanization was carried out by the Metropolitan Structures company of Chicago, under a master plan by the American company of Johnson, Johnson, and Roy. Several master plans were previously drawn up by the architect Harold Ship, but they were never realized. Phase 1 of the master plan was completed in 1968 when the first 3000 inhabitants moved into the first leased 800 units. A second phase, still in accordance with the master plan, was completed the following year, notably including four buildings by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe: three high rise apartment buildings, the first of which, 201 rue Corot, was occupied in 1969, and an Esso filling station of the same vintage. By the mid-1970s, significant areas to the south of the island were reclaimed from the St. Lawrence and eclectic constructions sprung in various parts of the island. Unsystematic construction has continued rapidly since then. The island was also the filming location for a horror film called &quot;They Came from Within&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Shivers&quot;, directed by Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg in 1975. The island&#x27;s hotel tower doubled for the film&#x27;s &quot;Starliner Tower&quot; apartment building.

==Geography==
The island is part of the Hochelaga Archipelago in the St. Lawrence River. It is located immediately southeast of the Island of Montreal, from which it is separated by a narrow channel, and north of the La Prairie Bassin.

Soils are mostly of clay loam to clay texture, and usually somewhat poorly drained (MacDonald series). Very poorly drained clay was mapped as Laplaine series, and areas of well-drained glacial till were mapped as Chateaugay clay loam or St. Bernard loam. A small gravel deposit at the northern end was mapped as Ste-Philomène sandy loam.

The island is noted for its parks and scenery including West Vancouver Park which overlooks the Saint Lawrence River. The 64 acre (26-hectare) Domaine Saint-Paul natural woodland in the southern part of the island, a crucial nesting area for more than a hundred species of birds, is one of the last remaining natural woodlands in southern Montreal. It has been progressively eroded by development. The woodland surrounds an artificial lake called Lac des Battures. This lake was actually created by accident as parts of the river known as &quot;water lots&quot; became landlocked during landfill operations in the 1960s and 1970s. Most of this landfill came from the excavation of Montreal&#x27;s underground Metro system in the mid-1960s. That part of the Island was subject to annual floods caused by spring runoff. The resulting dykes and fill allowed an additional few million square feet to be used for development as well as a golf course.

==Government==

Nuns&#x27; Island is part of the borough of Verdun, making up the neighbourhood of L&#x27;Île-des-Sœurs and forming part of the city council district of Champlain–L&#x27;Île-des-Sœurs with the eastern third of &quot;mainland&quot; Verdun. As part of Verdun, it is part of the federal riding of Ville-Marie—Le Sud-Ouest—Île-des-Sœurs and the provincial riding of Verdun.

==Economy==
Commercial services are clustered in malls around the Place du Commerce shopping centre near the Champlain Bridge, with civic services including a community centre and church around Place Elgar.

A recent development is the construction of the campus headquarters of Bell Canada on the northern tip of the island. In 2009 Bell Canada, the largest communications company in Canada, consolidated their workers from several locations throughout Montreal at a new complex on Nuns&#x27; Island, which also serves as the national headquarters of the company. The campus consists of a cluster of five low-rise buildings, located at the Autoroute 10 and 15 highway interchange at the northerly end of the island.

A substantial part of Nuns&#x27; Island is leased by Structures Metropolitaines from the current landowners of the Island. the Place du Commerce shopping centre.

==Infrastructure==
The Décarie South Expressway (Autoroute 15) runs through Nuns&#x27; Island, connecting it to the south bank of the St. Lawrence River via the Champlain Bridge and to the Island of Montreal via the Pont de l&#x27;Île-des-Sœurs, part of the Champlain Bridge complex. The Clément Bridge connects the island with the Bonaventure Expressway (Aut. 10).

There are only two schools on the island, École primaire Île-des-Sœurs and École des Marguerite. The primary schools are both part of Montreal&#x27;s French-language Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Board.

In July 2023, Île-des-Sœurs station opened. The rapid transit station is on the driverless Réseau express métropolitain line between downtown Montreal and Brossard.

<doc id="1282685" wikidata="Q668264" url="?curid=1282685" title="Islamic Centre Hamburg">
<text>The Islamic Centre Hamburg (, IZH; ), also known as the Blue Mosque (), was the oldest mosque in Hamburg, Germany. It was established in the late 1950s by a group of Iranian emigrants and business people and built in the early 1960s.
Amid investigations regarding its ties with Iran and Hezbollah, the IZH was judged unconstitutional and closed by the German government in July 2024.

==History==
During a meeting at the Atlantic Hotel in 1953, a group of Iranian residents of Germany discussed the need to establish their own religious center. A letter was sent to the late Grand Ayatollah Seyyed Husayn Borujerdi asking him for help; Borujerdi agreed with the plan and donated RI100,000 to the center. 

Construction started once the organization&#x27;s first director, Ayatollah Mohagheghi, arrived at Hamburg, with the building&#x27;s cornerstone being laid on 13 February 1961. In 1963, Mohagheghi&#x27;s return to Iran led to construction being halted. Ayatollah Mohammad Beheshti would replace him and remain the organization&#x27;s head until 1970.

During the 1970s, the centre played a significant role in bringing about the political rising of Iranian students in the West against the Shah and ultimately contributed to the Iranian Revolution.

=== Controversy and calls for closure ===
From 1993 until its closing, the monitored the IZH due to its ideological, organisational, and personal ties to the Iranian government. The IZH repeatedly protested against its monitoring, stating that it was a &quot;purely religious institution that, independent of Tehran, only deals with the religious affairs of Shiite Muslims living in Europe.&quot;

On 17 June 2022, IZH deputy director Seyed Soliman Mousavifar received an expulsion order from the Federal Ministry of the Interior after an investigation revealed that he maintained ties with Hezbollah representatives in Lebanon. Mousavifar appealed the decision twice, but was rejected by the and left the country in November the same year.

During the Mahsa Amini protests, a motion was passed by the Bundestag, which among other things, called on the German government to &quot;examine whether and how the [IZH] can be closed as a hub for the Iranian regime&#x27;s operations in Germany.&quot; More calls for the IZH&#x27;s closure were made after the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, with Greens member stating &quot;We do not want to accept that individual actors in our city create a breeding ground for hatred against Israel&quot;.

=== Closure ===
The centre was raided on 24 July 2024 and closed by order of Germany&#x27;s interior minister Nancy Faeser, who claimed that it was being used by the Iranian government to &quot;propagate an Islamist, totalitarian ideology&quot;. Documents provided to &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; stated that the mosque&#x27;s director had reportedly received orders from Mehdi Mostafavi, former advisor to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Several other affiliated Islamic centres were closed down as well, including the and the Islamic Centre Berlin.

Soon after the raid, Germany&#x27;s ambassador to Iran was summoned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The ban was strongly condemned by Iran, with several government agencies accusing the German government of Islamophobia. Religious authorities shared similar sentiments, with Qom Seminary administrators claiming that &quot;the move was reminiscent of the racist policies of the Nazi regime&quot; and would &quot;expose the hypocrisy of those claiming to uphold freedom of religion and expression.&quot;

<text>The Christian Democratic Party of Uruguay () is a political party of the Christian left.

==History==
The party was established in 1911 as the Civic Union, having developed out of the Catholic Party that contested the 1910 elections. In February 1962 it was renamed the Christian Democratic Party. A faction broke away in 1966, initially running under the name Christian Civic Movement, before becoming the Christian Radical Union, and later reclaiming the Civic Union name.

According to a 1956 study, the Civic Union &quot;rejected the concept of statism involved in what it claimed was &quot;Colorado Socialism,&quot; although it was willing to accept subsidiary intervention by the State to achieve ends of social justice.&quot; Another study noted how the Civic Union &quot;always has been concerned with the welfare of rural Uruguay, and has made concrete legislative contributions to the comparatively few sound policies which have been adopted in that field.&quot;

==Affiliation==
It is part of the governing coalition Broad Front (&quot;Frente Amplio&quot;). It is a part of the Progressive Alliance, which in turn forms part of the Liber Seregni Front uniting the more moderate centre-left and centrist sectors of the Broad Front.

===Programme===
Its platform calls for &quot;a communitarian society&quot; and a &quot;social state&quot;, as well as &quot;absolute respect for human life&quot; (including opposition to abortion). It further calls for &quot;alternative forms of production, distribution, consumption and accumulation&quot; that are &quot;superior to capitalist and state-owned enterprises&quot;, including:

* a social market economy
* cooperatives
* self-management or self-governing enterprises (&quot;autogestión&quot;)
* ecological economics
* respect for the commons
* support for the nonprofit sector

<doc id="1282693" wikidata="Q523582" url="?curid=1282693" title="SOLAS Convention">
<text>The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) is an international maritime treaty which sets out minimum safety standards in the construction, equipment and operation of merchant ships. The International Maritime Organization convention requires signatory flag states to ensure that ships flagged by them comply with at least these standards.

Initially prompted by the sinking of the Titanic, the current version of SOLAS is the 1974 version, known as SOLAS 1974, which came into force on 25 May 1980, and has been amended several times. , SOLAS 1974 has 167 contracting states, which flag about 99% of merchant ships around the world in terms of gross tonnage.

SOLAS in its successive forms is generally regarded as the most important of all international treaties concerning the safety of merchant ships.

==Signatories==
The non-parties to SOLAS 1974 include numerous landlocked countries, as well as El Salvador, Micronesia and East Timor. Some others including Bolivia, Lebanon and Sri Lanka, all considered flag of convenience states, are deemed to have &quot;potentially negative performance&quot; regarding ratification.

== Provisions ==
SOLAS 1974 requires flag states to ensure that ships flagged by them comply with the minimum safety standards in the construction, equipment and operation of merchant ships. The treaty includes articles setting out general obligations, etc., followed by an annexe divided into twelve chapters, two new chapters were added in 2016 and 2017. Of these, chapter five (often called &#x27;SOLAS V&#x27;) is the only one that applies to all vessels on the sea, including private yachts and small craft on local trips as well as to commercial vessels on international passages. Many countries have turned these international requirements into national laws so that anybody on the sea who is in breach of SOLAS V requirements may find themselves subject to legal proceedings.

;Chapter I – General Provisions: Surveying the various types of ships and certifying that they meet the requirements of the convention.

;Chapter II-1 – Construction – Subdivision and stability, machinery and electrical installations: The subdivision of passenger ships into watertight compartments so that after damage to its hull, a vessel will remain afloat and stable. This includes compliance with the International Code on Intact Stability

;Chapter II-2 – Fire protection, fire detection and fire extinction: Fire safety provisions for all ships with detailed measures for passenger ships, cargo ships and tankers under the FSS Code and requirements for the carriage of gas as a fuel under the IGF Code

;Chapter III – Life-saving appliances and arrangements: Life-saving appliances and arrangements, including requirements for life boats, rescue boats and life jackets according to type of ship. The specific technical requirements are given in the International Life-Saving Appliance (LSA) Code.

;Chapter IV – Radiocommunications: The Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS) requires passenger and cargo ships on international voyages to carry radio equipment, including satellite Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRBs) and Search and Rescue Transponders (SARTs).

;Chapter V – Safety of navigation: This chapter requires governments to ensure that all vessels are sufficiently and efficiently manned from a safety point of view. It places requirements on all vessels regarding voyage and passage planning, expecting a careful assessment of any proposed voyages by all who put to sea. Every mariner must take account of all potential dangers to navigation, weather forecasts, tidal predictions, the competence of the crew, and all other relevant factors. It also adds an obligation for all vessels&#x27; masters to offer assistance to those in distress and controls the use of lifesaving signals with specific requirements regarding danger and distress messages. It is different from the other chapters, which apply to certain classes of commercial shipping, in that these requirements apply to all vessels and their crews, including yachts and private craft, on all voyages and trips including local ones.

;Chapter VI – Carriage of Cargoes: Requirements for the stowage and securing of all types of cargo and cargo containers except liquids and gases in bulk. Including compliance with the Code of Safe Practice for Ships Carrying Timber Deck Cargoes

;Chapter VII – Carriage of dangerous goods:Requires the carriage of all kinds of dangerous goods to be in compliance with the International Bulk Chemical Code (IBC Code), The International Code of the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk (IGC Code) and the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (IMDG Code).

;Chapter VIII – Nuclear ships: Nuclear powered ships are required, particularly concerning radiation hazards, to conform to the Code of Safety for Nuclear Merchant Ships.

;Chapter IX – Management for the Safe Operation of Ships: Requires every shipowner and any person or company that has assumed responsibility for a ship to comply with the International Safety Management Code (ISM).

;Chapter X – Safety measures for high-speed craft: Makes mandatory the International Code of Safety for High-speed craft (HSC Code).

;Chapter XI-1 – Special measures to enhance maritime Safety: Requirements relating to organizations responsible for carrying out surveys and inspections, enhanced surveys, the ship identification number scheme, and operational requirements.

;Chapter XI-2 – Special measures to enhance maritime security: Includes the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code). Confirms that the role of the Master in maintaining the security of the ship is not, and cannot be, constrained by the company, the charterer or any other person. Port facilities must carry out security assessments and develop, implement and review port facility security plans. Controls the delay, detention, restriction, or expulsion of a ship from a port. Requires that ships must have a ship security alert system, as well as detailing other measures and requirements.

;Chapter XII – Additional safety measures for bulk carriers: Specific structural requirements for bulk carriers over 150 metres in length.

;Chapter XIII - Verification of compliance: Makes mandatory from 1 January 2016 the IMO Member State Audit Scheme.

;Chapter XIV - Safety measures for ships operating in polar waters: The chapter makes mandatory, from 1 January 2017, the Introduction and part I-A of the International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters (the Polar Code).

== History ==

=== Origin and early versions ===
The first version of SOLAS Treaty was passed in 1914 in response to the sinking of RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, which prescribed numbers of lifeboats and other emergency equipment along with safety procedures, including continuous radio watches. The 1914 treaty never entered into force due to the outbreak of the First World War.

Further versions were adopted in 1929 and 1948.

=== 1960 version ===
The 1960 Convention was adopted on 17 June 1960 and entered into force on 26 May 1965. It was the fourth SOLAS Convention and was the first major achievement for the International Maritime Organization (IMO). It represented a considerable step forward in modernizing regulations and keeping up with technical developments in the shipping industry.

=== 1974 version ===
In 1974, a completely new Convention was adopted to allow SOLAS to be amended and implemented within a reasonable timescale, instead of the previous procedure to incorporate amendments, which proved to be very slow. Under SOLAS 1960, it could take several years for amendments to come into force since countries had to give notice of acceptance to IMO and there was a minimum threshold of countries and tonnage. Under SOLAS 1974, amendments enter into force via a tacit acceptance procedure – this allows an amendment to enter into force on a specified date, unless objections to an amendment are received from an agreed number of parties.

The 1974 SOLAS came into force on 25 May 1980, 12 months after its ratification by at least 25 countries with at least 50% of gross tonnage. It has been updated and amended on numerous occasions since then and the Convention in force today is sometimes referred to as SOLAS, 1974, as amended.

In 1975 the assembly of the IMO decided that the 1974 convention should in future use SI (metric) units only.

=== 1988 version ===
In particular, amendments in 1988 based on amendments of International Radio Regulations in 1987 replaced Morse code with the Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS) and came into force beginning 1 February 1992. The issues covered by the treaty are set out in the list of sections (above). Further amendments were made in May 2011.

===Container weight regulation, 2015===
In 2015, the SOLAS Container Weight Verification Regulation VI/2 amended SOLAS. This regulation, implemented by the IMO Maritime Safety Committee (MSC), requires that the full (gross) weight of all loaded containers must be obtained prior to being loaded on board an ocean vessel. Weight can be calculated either by weighing the loaded container or weighing the cargo elements and packaging and adding this weight to the unladen container weight. Communicating a weight value has incurred a need to introduce a new Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) communication protocol called VGM (Verified Gross Mass) or VERMAS (Verification of Mass), and involves cooperation between ocean carriers, freight forwarders/NVOCCs, EDI providers as well as exporters. The regulation states that exporters (shippers) are ultimately responsible for obtaining a verified container weight. Originally scheduled for implementation on 1 July 2016, the regulation allowed for flexibility and practical refinement until 1 October 2016.

An up-to-date list of amendments to SOLAS is maintained by the IMO.

<doc id="1282696" wikidata="Q2610154" url="?curid=1282696" title="Red eye (medicine)">
<text>A red eye is an eye that appears red due to illness or injury. It is usually injection and prominence of the superficial blood vessels of the conjunctiva, which may be caused by disorders of these or adjacent structures. Conjunctivitis and subconjunctival hemorrhage are two of the less serious but more common causes.

Management includes assessing whether emergency action (including referral) is needed, or whether treatment can be accomplished without additional resources.

Slit lamp examination is invaluable in diagnosis but initial assessment can be performed using a careful history, testing vision (visual acuity), and carrying out a penlight examination.

==Diagnosis==

Particular signs and symptoms may indicate that the cause is serious and requires immediate attention.

Seven such signs are: 
* Reduced visual acuity
* Ciliary flush (circumcorneal injection)
* Corneal abnormalities including edema or opacities (&quot;corneal haze&quot;)
* Corneal staining
* Pupil abormalities including abormal pupil size
* Abnormal intraocular pressure
* Severe pain

The most useful is a smaller pupil in the red eye than the non-red eye (opposite eye) and sensitivity to bright light.

===Reduced visual acuity===
A reduction in visual acuity in a &#x27;red eye&#x27; is indicative of serious ocular disease, such as keratitis, iridocyclitis, and glaucoma, and never occurs in simple conjunctivitis without accompanying corneal involvement.

===Ciliary flush===
Ciliary flush is usually present in eyes with corneal inflammation, iridocyclitis or acute glaucoma, though not simple conjunctivitis.
A ciliary flush is a ring of red or violet spreading out from around the cornea of the eye.

===Corneal abnormalities===
The cornea is required to be transparent to transmit light to the retina. Because of injury, infection or inflammation, an area of opacity may develop which can be seen with a penlight or slit lamp. In rare instances, this opacity is congenital. In some, there is a family history of corneal growth disorders which may be progressive with age. Much more commonly, misuse of contact lenses may be a precipitating factor. Whichever, it is always potentially serious and sometimes necessitates urgent treatment and corneal opacities are the fourth leading cause of blindness. 
Opacities may be keratic, that is, due to the deposition of inflammatory cells, hazy, usually from corneal edema, or they may be localized in the case of corneal ulcer or keratitis.
Corneal epithelial disruptions may be detected with fluorescein staining of the eye, and careful observation with cobalt-blue light.
Corneal epithelial disruptions would stain green, which represents some injury of the corneal epithelium.
These types of disruptions may be due to corneal inflammations or physical trauma to the cornea, such as a foreign body.

===Pupillary abnormalities===
In an eye with iridocyclitis, (inflammation of both the iris and ciliary body), the involved pupil will be smaller than the uninvolved, due to reflex muscle spasm of the iris sphincter muscle.
Generally, conjunctivitis does not affect the pupils.
With acute angle-closure glaucoma, the pupil is generally fixed in mid-position, oval, and responds sluggishly to light, if at all.

Shallow anterior chamber depth may indicate a predisposition to one form of glaucoma (narrow angle) but requires slit-lamp examination or other special techniques to determine it.
In the presence of a &quot;red eye&quot;, a shallow anterior chamber may indicate acute glaucoma, which requires immediate attention.

===Abnormal intraocular pressure===
Intraocular pressure should be measured as part of a routine eye examination.
It is usually only elevated by iridocyclitis or acute-closure glaucoma, but not by relatively benign conditions.
In iritis and traumatic perforating ocular injuries, the intraocular pressure is usually low.

===Severe pain===
Those with conjunctivitis may report mild irritation or scratchiness, but never extreme pain, which is an indicator of more serious disease such as keratitis, corneal ulceration, iridocyclitis, or acute glaucoma.

===Differential diagnosis===
Of the many causes, conjunctivitis is the most common. Others include:

====Usually nonurgent====
* airborne eye irritants
* blepharitis – a usually chronic inflammation of the eyelids with scaling, sometimes resolving spontaneously
* drugs: medications or recreational drug use
** Cannabis
* dry eye syndrome – caused by either decreased tear production or increased tear film evaporation which may lead to irritation and redness 
* subconjunctival hemorrhage – a sometimes dramatic, but usually harmless, bleeding underneath the conjunctiva most often from spontaneous rupture of the small, fragile blood vessels, commonly from a cough or sneeze
* inflamed pterygium – a benign, triangular, horizontal growth of the conjunctiva, arising from the inner side, at the level of contact of the upper and lower eyelids, associated with exposure to sunlight, low humidity and dust. It may be more common in occupations such as farming and welding.
* inflamed pinguecula – a yellow-white deposit close to the junction between the cornea and sclera, on the conjunctiva. It is most prevalent in tropical climates with much UV exposure. Although harmless, it can occasionally become inflamed.
* tiredness
* episcleritis – most often a mild, inflammatory disorder of the &#x27;white&#x27; of the eye unassociated with eye complications in contrast to scleritis, and responding to topical medications such as anti-inflammatory drops.

====Usually urgent====
* acute closed-angle glaucoma – implies injury to the optic nerve with the potential for irreversible vision loss which may be permanent unless treated quickly, as a result of increased pressure within the eyeball. Not all forms of glaucoma are acute, and not all are associated with increased intraocular pressure.
* eye injury
* keratitis – a potentially serious inflammation or injury to the cornea (window), often associated with significant pain, light intolerance, and deterioration in vision. Numerous causes include virus infection. Injury from contact lenses can lead to keratitis.

* iritis – together with the ciliary body and choroid, the iris makes up the uvea, part of the middle, pigmented, structures of the eye. Inflammation of this layer (uveitis) requires urgent control and is estimated to be responsible for 10% of blindness in the United States.
* scleritis – a serious inflammatory condition, often painful, that can result in permanent vision loss, and without an identifiable cause in half of those presenting with it. About 30–40% have an underlying systemic autoimmune condition. 
* tick-borne illnesses like Rocky Mountain spotted fever – the eye is not primarily involved, but the presence of conjunctivitis, along with fever and rash, may help with the diagnosis in appropriate circumstances.

<doc id="1282699" wikidata="Q11697802" url="?curid=1282699" title="Parker Fennelly">
<text>Parker W. Fennelly (October 22, 1891 – January 22, 1988) was an American character actor who appeared in ten films, numerous television episodes and hundreds of radio programs.

==Early life==
The son of gardener Nathan Fennelly and Estelle Dolliver Fennelly, he was born and raised in Northeast Harbor, Maine, and studied classical acting in Boston, where he was a member of the Toy Theater company and participated in Chautauqua readings. He studied under the performing arts educator Leland T. Powers.

==Stage==
In 1915 and 1916, Fennelly toured on the Midland Chautauqua Circuit with the Maud Scheerer Shakespeare Players. In 1919, he traveled and acted with the Jack X. Lewis Stock Company. Fennelly and his wife, Catherine Reynolds Fennelly, formed the Parker Fennelly Duo, presenting short plays, readings and impersonations (1921–1923).

Fennelly&#x27;s performances on Broadway included roles in &quot;Mr. Pitt&quot; (1924), &quot;The Small Timers&quot; (1925), &quot;Florida Girl&quot; (1925), &quot;Babbling Brookes&quot; (1927), &quot;Black Velvet&quot; (1927), &quot;The County Chairman&quot; (1936), &quot;Yours, A. Lincoln&quot; (1942), &quot;Our Town&quot; (1944), &quot;Happily Ever After&quot; (1945), &quot;Live Life Again&quot; (1945), &quot;Loco&quot; (1946) and &quot;The Southwest Corner&quot; (1955). His other Broadway credits include directing &quot;Technique&quot; (1931), providing source material for &quot;Fulton of Oak Falls&quot; (1937) and writing &quot;Cuckoos on the Hearth&quot; (1941).

==Radio==
Fennelly and Arthur Allen played &quot;Yankee codgers&quot; on &quot;The Stebbins Boys of Bucksport Point&quot; and &quot;Snow Village Sketches&quot; in the early years of radio.

===Allen&#x27;s Alley===
Fennelly personified the crusty New England Yankee in roles on radio, films and television. He was heard weekly as Titus Moody on the &quot;Allen&#x27;s Alley&quot; segment of Fred Allen&#x27;s radio show where he delivered his famous opening line, &quot;Howdy, Bub&quot;.

===Other radio===
Fennelly&#x27;s other roles on radio included the following:
In 1960, Fennelly recorded &quot;Moody Speaking&quot;, a series of &quot;sparkling one-minute and five-minute vignettes&quot; produced by Banner Radio Company for local stations.

==Television and films==

Fennelly made numerous appearances on live television shows in the early 1950s, including &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Philco Television Playhouse&quot; and &quot;Studio One&quot;. In 1956, he guest-starred on an episode of &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; as a housepainter. He also appeared in &quot;The Trouble with Richard,&quot; an unsold television pilot starring Dick Van Dyke aired on the anthology series &quot;New Comedy Showcase&quot; in 1960. In 1970–1971, he played Mr. Purdy on &quot;Headmaster&quot; on CBS.

In film, Fennelly portrayed the millionaire in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot; (1955) and he replaced Percy Kilbride as Pa Kettle in the final film of the &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle&quot; series, &quot;The Kettles on Old MacDonald&#x27;s Farm&quot;. After &quot;Angel in My Pocket&quot; (1969), his last movie role was Universal&#x27;s &quot;How to Frame a Figg&quot; (1971) starring Don Knotts.

In later years, Fennelly became a familiar face as the Pepperidge Farm&#x27;s television spokesman between 1956 and 1977, delivering the slogan &quot;Pepperidge Farm remembers&quot; in his New England accent, then turned over the role to Charles C. Welch.

==Personal life==

<text>The Nahe () is a river in Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland, Germany, a left tributary to the Rhine. It has also given name to the wine region Nahe situated around it.

The name Nahe is derived from the Latin word &quot;Nava&quot;, which is supposed to be based upon the Celtic origin for &quot;the wild river&quot;. The Nahe separates the northern part of the Palatinate from the Hunsrück.

It rises in the area of Nohfelden (Saarland) at the district of Selbach, flowing through Rhineland-Palatinate and joining the Rhine in Bingen. Its length is . Towns along the Nahe include Idar-Oberstein, Kirn, Bad Kreuznach and Bingen.

== Hydrology ==

The drainage basin of the river covers an area of . Due to this relatively large area compared to the river&#x27;s length high floods can occur along its middle and lower course within only a few hours, however flowing off also quickly. In 1993 and 1995 in Bad Kreuznach a flow of more than was measured and more than at its mouth into the Rhine.

The dimensions of the drainage basin are shown in the map. Its boundaries clock-wise, beginning in the East: 
* the highlands of the &quot;Rheinhessische Schweiz&quot; as drainage divide to the Rhine
* the Donnersberg massif as drainage divide to the rivers Selz and Rhine
* the North Palatine Uplands as drainage divide to the rivers Pfrimm and Rhine eastwards as well as to the rivers Wallhalb and Schwarzbach (Blies) southwards
* the Hunsrück as drainage divide to the rivers Prims, Blies and Saar in the South respectively to the Moselle in the North
* the mountains of the &quot;Binger Wald&quot; (Bingen forest) as drainage divide to the Rhine towards North

== Geology and Wildlife ==

The rocks in the Nahe region are predominantly of Cisuralian (early Permian) age and part of the Rotliegendes. At that time, an impetuous volcanism appeared in the region. Huge deposits of the reddish volcanic rock Rhyolite and of the more alkaline volcanic rock Andesite were left. The valleys of the Nahe and its tributaries have been being formed since 2.6 million years ago during the Quaternary, the geologically latest period, as a result of ground heaving of the surrounding mountains of Hunsrück and North Palatine Uplands. This led to a steep decline of all waters and hence to strong erosion activities. Particularly strong erosion occurred in warmer melting periods during the ice ages, when tundra climate reigned, and the soil was not protected by a dense cover of vegetation. Depending on the underground, narrow gorges with cliffy precipices arose in areas with hard volcanic rocks or wide gentle valleys with flood plains in areas with soft sedimentary deposits. The frequent change between both forms is charming along the Nahe.

In the Nahe valley, a huge number of thermophile species appear which usually can only be found in the mediterranean region or Eurasian steppe habitats. Characteristical species of plants are e. g. &quot;Alyssum montanum&quot;, &quot;Aster linosyris&quot; (&quot;Goldilocks Aster&quot;), &quot;Dictamnus albus&quot; (&quot;White Dittany&quot;), &quot;Dianthus grationopolitanus&quot; (&quot;Cheddar Pink&quot;), &quot;Gagea bohemica&quot; subsp. &quot;saxatilis&quot; (&quot;Early-Star-of-Bethlehem&quot;), &quot;Galium glaucum&quot; (&quot;Glaucous Bedstraw&quot;), &quot;Oxytropis pilosa&quot; or &quot;Stipa tirsa&quot;. These plants immigrated in a postglacial warm period to Europe but became extinct in most regions when the climate changed again to significantly cooler and more humid conditions. They only survived in small but still warm and dry places due to special geographic situations. In the Nahe valley and its tributaries these are mostly rocky precipices towards South or South-East, furthermore sunny slopes with shrubs, bushes and dry broad-leaved forests. On hot summer days the soil temperatures in these places can reach 60 °C/140 °F and above with truly steppe-like circumstances. A characteristical thermophile animal species is the insulated population of the dice snake (&quot;Natrix tessellata&quot;) that exists along the Nahe. The snake is very addicted to water and captures small fishes.

Places of botanical and/or zoological significance are classified as nature protection areas and accompany the course of the Nahe. For instance can be mentioned the &quot;Hellberg&quot; near Kirn, the &quot;Flachsberg&quot; near Martinstein, the &quot;Heimberg&quot; near Waldböckelheim, the &quot;Gangelsberg&quot; near Duchroth and the &quot;Rotenfels&quot; as well as the &quot;Rheingrafenstein&quot; near Bad Münster am Stein.

== Tourism ==

The Nahe region offers various tourist attractions:

Nahe cycling route – The route leads along the river from its spring to its entry.

Nahe wine region – The wine-producing area surrounding the middle and lower river is famous for its white wines, dominated by the Riesling grape variety.

Castles and monasteries – On the heights on both shores numerous medieval castles and abbeys can be visited, most of them fallen into ruin. Most noted are the Kyrburg Castle in Kirn, the castles Ebernburg and Rheingrafenstein in Bad Münster am Stein-Ebernburg and the Klopp Castle in Bingen. The monastery ruin of Disibodenberg, located on top of a hill between the junction of the Nahe and the Glan, was founded at the beginning of the 8th century by Saint Disibod, an Irish missionary. Saint Hildegard of Bingen, a famous Christian mystic, also lived here for a while.

Gemstone town Idar-Oberstein - The town is famous for its historic gemstone mines and related trades. Some of them are open to visitors. The German Gemstone Museum boasts many gemstone exhibits.

Bad Kreuznach - The baths which give the town its name contain the noble gas radon, with supposedly curative properties. The town&#x27;s most famous site is the Alte Nahebrücke (Old Nahe Bridge), one of the few remaining bridges in the world with buildings on it.

Saline valley - Between Bad Münster am Stein and Bad Kreuznach the scenic valley of the Nahe has some bathing sites with hydrothermal and saline springs. Graduation towers, formerly used for salt production, are regarded as having beneficial health effects. The so-called &quot;Rotenfels&quot; (red rock), a steep cliff nearby with a height of and a length of was formed by the Nahe.

Bad Sobernheim - The open-air museum of Rhineland-Palatinate in Bad Sobernheim has an exhibition four traditional villages with refurbished historic houses from different regions of Rhineland-Palatinate.

The region is accessible via federal highway B41 which is connected to the motorways A60/A61 in the East and A62 in the West. Moreover, there is a railway line along the Nahe with regular connections between Mainz and Saarbrücken and stations in all bigger towns. Some to the north the Frankfurt-Hahn Airport is in the Hunsrück, offering daily flights to London Stansted and further weekly and seasonal connections.

<doc id="1282721" wikidata="Q7312704" url="?curid=1282721" title="Renatus Harris">
<text>Renatus Harris ( - 1724) was an English master organ maker in England in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.

During the period of the Commonwealth, in the mid-seventeenth century, Puritans controlled the country and organ music was banned in churches. Many organ makers left England for the continent, including Harris&#x27; father, Thomas. It was while the family was living in France that Harris was born. After the Restoration the family returned to England.

Harris grew up in his father&#x27;s business and eventually became one of the two most prominent organ builders of his generation, along with his hated rival &quot;Father&quot; Bernard Smith. Harris had a flair for publicity and was not above using under-hand tactics against Smith. Harris&#x27;s great-grandfather, Thomas Dallam, and his father, Robert Dallam, were also organ makers, as were Renatus Harris&#x27;s sons, John and Renatus. John Harris was the father of Joseph Harris, a renowned harpsichord maker, who in turn was the father of English entomologist and engraver Moses Harris.

He is credited with being the first to introduce the pedals to the organ, at St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol. However, the pedalboard was an addition of one octave of pull-down pedals and not the independent pedalboard we know today. He was also famous for introducing stops to organs which imitated particular instruments - a kind of hallmark - such as trumpet, cremona, cornet, etc.

Renatus Harris died at Salisbury in August or September, 1724 shortly after completing his last organ with his son John at St Dionis Backchurch in the City of London.

==Organs of the Temple Church and Christ Church, Dublin==
The rivalry between the two men led to the famous &quot;Battle of the Organs&quot; in 1684, when both were bidding for the contract to build the new organ for the Temple Church, London. Each erected an organ in the Temple Church and they hired prominent organists Giovanni Battista Draghi, John Blow and Henry Purcell to demonstrate the superiority of their instruments. Harris lost out to Smith, but in 1697, after Smith reneged on a contract for a new organ at Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, Harris appositely installed the instrument which had lost there instead. Harris&#x27;s organ, which was installed and maintained by John Baptist Cuvillie, and later Philip Hollister, was replaced by an organ by John Byfield in 1752. However, the Harris-Cuvillie organ which survived the &#x27;Battle of the Organs&#x27; today survives in St John&#x27;s Church, Wolverhampton.

==Extant Harris organs==
The most complete surviving organ by Harris is that of St Botolph&#x27;s Aldgate, built in 1702 - 1704, which is also regarded as the oldest church organ in the United Kingdom. It was restored in 2005 - 2006 by Martin Goetze and Dominic Gwynn, and features in the documentary &quot;The Elusive English Organ&quot;. Among Harris&#x27; surviving or partially surviving organs are those of Bristol Cathedral (1685), All Hallows Twickenham (1700), and the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors&#x27; Hall, City of London (1722) (Restored by Mander Organs in 1966). A Harris organ at Christ Church Greyfriars, also known as Christ Church Newgate, in London was much rebuilt by William Hill &amp; Sons in 1838 to designs by Henry Gauntlett and was destroyed along with the church during the Blitz in December 1940. The organ of St Michael, Cornhill contains nine ranks from the Harris instrument of 1684.

<text>Alexandru G. Golescu (1819 – 15 August 1881) was a Romanian politician who served as a prime minister of Romania in 1870.

==Early life==
Born in the Golescu family of boyars in Bucharest, Wallachia, he was the cousin of the brothers Ștefan and Nicolae Golescu; Alexandru G. was often referred to as Alexandru Golescu Negru (&quot;Golescu the Black&quot;), to distinguish him from his relative and fellow activist Alexandru C. Golescu (who was known as &quot;Albu&quot; – &quot;the White&quot;).

Alexandru G. Golescu studied at the Saint Sava Academy and then in Paris, at the &quot;École d&#x27;Arts et Métiers&quot;, after which he returned to be an engineer in Wallachia.

Together with Nicolae Bălcescu, Ion Ghica and Christian Tell, Golescu was a founding member of the &quot;Frăția&quot; (&quot;Brotherhood&quot;), a radical secret society in 1843, meant as opposition to Wallachian Prince Gheorghe Bibescu. He returned to Paris in 1845 to be a member of a revolutionary society of the Romanian students.

==Revolution and later years==
He took part in the Wallachian revolution of 1848, and were members of the Revolutionary Committee formed around &quot;Frăția&quot;. He was a secretary of the Provisional Government, and served as its representative in France after 14 July 1848 (in this capacity, he called for the French Second Republic&#x27;s support in combating the threat of Ottoman and Imperial Russian intervention in Wallachia). Golescu was also active in negotiating an agreement between the Hungarian government of Lajos Kossuth and the Transylvanian Romanian forces of Avram Iancu, but his efforts were largely unsuccessful.

After the revolution in Bucharest was crushed, Ghica remained in exile until 1856, when, after Russian presence had been swept by the effects of the Crimean War he returned to campaign for the unification of Wallachia and Moldavia, which was successful in 1859 when Alexandru Ioan Cuza was elected &quot;Domnitor&quot; of the two Danubian Principalities. He later served several times as minister and once, for only half a year, as prime minister under Prince Carol. He died at his estate in Rusănești, Olt County.

<doc id="1282738" wikidata="Q617285" url="?curid=1282738" title="Rumaila oil field">
<text>The Rumaila oil field is a super-giant oil field located in southern Iraq, approximately 50km to the south west of Basra City. Discovered in 1953 by the Basrah Petroleum Company (BPC), an associate company of the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), the field is estimated to contain 17 billion barrels, which accounts for 12% of Iraq&#x27;s oil reserves, estimated at 143 billion barrels. Rumaila is said to be the largest oilfield ever discovered in Iraq and one of the three largest oilfields in the world.

Under Abdul-Karim Qasim, the oilfield was nationalised by the Iraqi government by Public Law No. 80 on 11 December 1961. Since then, this massive oil field has remained under Iraqi control. The assets and rights of IPC were nationalized by Saddam Hussein in 1972, and those of BPC in 1975. The dispute between Iraq and Kuwait over alleged slant-drilling in the field was one of the reasons for Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

After decades of under investment, due to sanctions by the west, by the early 2000s, the field was suffering not only from the natural base decline of its reservoirs, but also from ageing infrastructure and equipment, compromising production capacity, environmental protection and safety. 

The town of North Rumaila is called &quot;the cemetery&quot; by the locals. A local environmental scientist told the BBC in 2022 that cancer in the area was so rife it was &quot;like the flu&quot;.

Following the BBC story, the Rumaila Operating Organisation (ROO) has been reducing gas flaring from its operated facilities at Rumaila. This reduced by a further 20% during 2022 – contributing to a reduction of more than 65% over the past seven years.

==Ownership==
The field is owned by Iraq (Basra Oil Company). Following bidding rounds in the first decade of the 2000s, a Technical Service Contract was signed between BOC and BP, PetroChina and the State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO) in 2009. This detailed the establishment of ROO as the operator of the oilfield and led to the introduction of new technologies and infrastructure, training and equipment for staff, and an extensive drilling and expansion programme. 

In June 2022, Basra Energy Company Ltd (BECL), a company wholly owned by PetroChina and bp which manages the companies’ interests at the Rumaila oilfield, assumed the lead contractor role from bp, under the existing Technical Services Contract. BECL was established to enable continued and optimized investment in the field, including enhanced access to external financing. ROO remained as the operator. The Technical Services Contract was extended in 2014 and now runs until 2034.

==Production==
Transformation of the field began in 2010 and since then production has risen by 35%. During 2022, the field&#x27;s reported production averaged making up around 30% of Iraq&#x27;s oil production of . As of 2019, about 550 production wells were operating at Rumaila. 

Production Facilities

The field is operated by Rumaila Operating Organisation. Facilities include a headquarters, waste management centre, supply base and training academy. There are also seven operational cluster pump stations and with 14 degassing stations - seven in the North field and seven in the South field. These degassing stations provide 3-phase separation (oil, water, and natural gas). Crude oil is sent by pipeline to local refineries or ports in Basra for export. Natural gas is provided to the Basrah Gas Company, as well as being used in the recently built Rumaila Power Plant which provides electricity to various oilfield facilities. Water is disposed into disposal wells. Degassing station names:
* North Rumaila: DS1, DS2, DS3, DS4, DS5, NIDS, SIDS
* South Rumaila: Markazia (Rumaila), Janubia, Shamiya, Qurainat, Mishrif Shamiya, Mishrif Qurainat, Ratqa

==Reserves==
Rumaila reportedly holds an estimated 17 billion barrels of oil; which accounts for 12% of Iraq&#x27;s oil reserves, estimated at 143.1 billion barrels. The oil sits approximately below the surface which is considered an easy target for production. At current production rate of , the reserves-to-production ratio is just under 35 years.

== Importance ==

Rumaila oil field was critical in the 1990 Gulf War. Iraq, after accusing Kuwait of allegedly side-drilling under Iraqi soil, launched an attack on Kuwait on 2 August 1990. In addition, Kuwait had been producing quantities of oil, which were above treaty limits established by OPEC. In fact, before the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait in 1990, Kuwait had drilled only 8 vertical wells in its part of the Rumaila field and the production was limited due to different technical problems. After the liberation of Kuwait in 1991, the United Nation border demarcation committee went back to the historical data and shifted the Kuwaiti border toward the north which meant that Iraq was producing from Kuwaiti territory.

During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the Iraqi Ground Forces laid an 18 km long defensive minefield across it, which contained an estimated 100,000 mines. Iraqi forces also set fire to parts of the oil field as a defensive maneuver, though these fires were later extinguished by Coalition forces.

==Cancer risk==
Gas, when burned openly, can produce pollutants that are linked to cancer. Iraqi law prohibits gas-burning less than 10 km from people&#x27;s homes, but the BBC found in 2022 that gas was being burned as close as 350 meters from people&#x27;s homes. A leaked report from the Iraqi Ministry of Health blamed air pollution for a 20% rise in cancer in Basra between 2015 and 2018; however, the Ministry of Health also prohibited its employees from speaking about the health damage. Iraqi Environment Minister Jassem al-Falahi later admitted that &quot;pollution from oil production is the main reason for increases in local cancer rates.&quot; None of the affected locals received compensation.

The Rumaila Operating Organisation has reduced gas flaring at its operated facilities by more than 65% since 2016.

<text>The Computus Runicus was a runic calendar produced in 1328 and found on the Swedish island of Gotland. A transcription/description of the text - called &quot;Computus Runicus&quot; - was published in 1626 by the Danish physician and antiquarian Ole Worm (Olaus Wormius) (1588–1654).

==Description==
The text consists of the 12 calendar pages and a series of additional pages with detailed explanations for finding information used in the medieval computus, including golden numbers and epacts.

The calendar is written in medieval runes with a gloss in Latin and some places also in Swedish added by Worm. It follows a standard layout for a medieval calendar similar to those found in a book of hours, with Christian feasts and saint&#x27;s days. Worm attempted to identify some of the unusual symbols found in the calendar, including one marking fast days and another marking the beginning of the Zodiac months which curiously start on the 18th day of each month instead of the more common 20th or 21st.

As with any medieval calendar, there is a column for the golden numbers used in the Metonic cycle (to find the date of Easter) and another column for the dominical letters (to find the date of Sunday each week). January 31 and the month of February have an additional column to be used for finding the beginning of Lent, while March and April have an additional column to assist with finding the date of Easter. The author used a similar system of rune replacements for the Latin letters and Roman numerals as those commonly found in other runic calendars, including the use of the extra runes Arlaug, Tvimadur, and Belgthor to represent the Golden Numbers 17, 18, and 19.

<text>&quot;Internets&quot;, also known as &quot;The Internets&quot;, is a Bushism-turned catchphrase used humorously to portray the speaker as ignorant about the Internet or about technology in general, or alternatively as having a provincial or folksy attitude toward technology. Former United States President George W. Bush first used the word publicly during the 2000 election campaign. The term gained cachet as an Internet humor meme following Bush&#x27;s use of the term in the second 2004 presidential election debate on October 8, 2004.

==Presidential usages==
Bush used the word &quot;Internets&quot; in his third presidential debate against Al Gore on October 17, 2000:

JOYCE CLEAMER, AUDIENCE MEMBER: …I&#x27;m very concerned about the morality of our country now. TV, movies, the music that our children are, you know, barraged with every day. And I want to know if there&#x27;s anything that can be worked out with the—Hollywood, or whoever, to help get rid of some of this bad language and whatever, you know...&lt;br&gt;BUSH: ... You bet there&#x27;s things that government can do. We can work with the entertainment industry to provide family hour. We can have filters on Internets where public money is spent. There ought to be filters in public libraries and filters in public schools so if kids get on the Internet, there is not going to be pornography or violence coming in.

In the 2004 election&#x27;s second debate in St. Louis, Missouri, this time opposing John Kerry, Bush used the word &quot;Internets&quot; in response to an audience question about a potential military draft:

DANIEL FARLEY, AUDIENCE MEMBER: Mr. President, since we continue to police the world, how do you intend to maintain our military presence without reinstituting a draft?&lt;br&gt;BUSH: Yes, that&#x27;s a great question. Thanks. I hear there&#x27;s rumors on the, uh, Internets [pause] that we&#x27;re going to have a draft. We&#x27;re not going to have a draft, period. The all-volunteer army works. It works particularly when we pay our troops well. It works when we make sure they&#x27;ve got housing, like we have done in the last military budgets.
 The word &quot;Internets&quot; as used by Bush is capitalized in the official debate transcript.
 The official transcript follows the word &quot;Internets&quot; with &quot;(sic)&quot;. The transcript also omits the filler word &quot;uh&quot; preceding &quot;Internets&quot;. Video footage of the quotation shows the full version.

Bush used &quot;Internets&quot; for a third time on May 2, 2007:

Information is moving—you know, nightly news is one way, of course, but it&#x27;s also moving through the blogosphere and through the Internets.

During a discussion on education at a Twitter-themed town hall meeting on July 6, 2011, at the White House, President Barack Obama used the term &quot;Internets&quot; and quickly corrected his statement.

==Reaction==
On the evening of October 9, 2004, the day following the Bush/Kerry debate, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; parodied Bush with Will Forte&#x27;s impression of George W. Bush:

I hear there&#x27;s rumors on the Internets that we&#x27;re going to have a draft. I don&#x27;t know how many of these Internets are carrying these rumors, but they&#x27;re just wrong. I think the problem here may be more of a question of getting rid of the bad Internets and keeping the good Internets. You know, &#x27;cause I think we can all agree … there&#x27;re just too many Internets.

The &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; parody was replayed the following morning on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Inside Politics Sunday&quot;. Numerous homages and parodies, most including an audio or video clip from the second 2004 debate, appeared on other humor and entertainment web sites, including YTMND, and spread virally on the Internet.

On his show &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, comedian Stephen Colbert consistently referred to &quot;the Internet&quot; as &quot;the Internets&quot;. During one episode Colbert&#x27;s character, also named Stephen Colbert, states,

Last night, as I was surfing the Internets … literally: My backyard wave pool has Wi-Fi …
Keith Olbermann similarly made use of the term during his &quot;Oddball&quot; segment whenever viral videos are covered. The term continues to appear as a popular topic tag on both technical and political blogs.

==Other use of &quot;internets&quot;==
In general, an &quot;internet&quot; (uncapitalized) results from the connection (internetworking) of at least two computer networks by establishing a gateway (router) between them. It is proper to pluralize this term. For example, RFC 1918 refers to &quot;Address Allocation for Private Internets&quot;. However, since the establishment of the Internet, this usage has been less common.

A much lesser-known recorded use of &quot;internets&quot; actually preceded Bush&#x27;s use in the October 17, 2000 debate with Al Gore by about eight months. It appeared in a sketch of the comedy show Upright Citizen&#x27;s Brigade in the episode entitled &quot;Music&quot;, which was aired February 7, 2000. In the sketch, the host of a country-western music TV show tells a guest from New York City that &quot;[t]here&#x27;s a whole lot of things you can&#x27;t learn in your fancy books and internets.&quot;

In 2010, in a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; interview, author Ray Bradbury (author of &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;), who was distrustful of modern technology, said &quot;We have too many cellphones. We&#x27;ve got too many Internets.&quot;

<doc id="1282746" wikidata="Q5988266" url="?curid=1282746" title="Identity (object-oriented programming)">
<text>In object-oriented programming, analysis and design, object identity is the fundamental property of every object that it is distinct from other objects. Objects have identity are distinct even when they are otherwise indistinguishable, i.e. equal. In this way, object identity is closely related to the philosophical meaning.

== Identity and references ==
A reference can be used to refer to an object with a specific identity. A reference contains the information that is necessary for the identity property to be realized in the programming language, and allows access to the object with the identity. A type of a target of a reference is a role. Typically, references are isomorphic to memory addresses. However, multiple such references can refer to the same object, if some form of address mapping is present (virtual addresses / page tables / memory segments).

Object identity is less useful as a semantic concept in environments or situations in which the structure of objects is not encapsulated, and two objects are considered to be the same object based on having identical properties, even if they are not actually the same physical instance (structural equivalence). However, object identity can nevertheless provide optimization. A function which tests whether two arguments are the same object can quickly short circuit to an affirmative answer if the two arguments have the same identity (are references to the same instance). Only if the argument are distinct objects do the individual properties need to be considered to determine equality, which is a more expensive operation. For instance, bignum integers may be heap-allocated objects such that two bignums are considered to be the same if they represent the same number. It might be a waste of machine cycles in the equality function not to take advantage of the discovery that the two arguments being compared are references to the same bignum.

== Consequences of identity ==
Identity of objects allows objects to be treated as black boxes. The object need not expose its internal structure. It can still be referred to, and its other properties can be accessed via its external behaviour associated with the identity. The identity provides a mechanism for referring to such parts of the object that are not exposed in the interface. Thus, identity is the basis for polymorphism in object-oriented programming.

Identity allows comparison of references. Two references can be compared whether they are equal or not. Due to the identity property, this comparison has special properties. If the comparison of references indicates that the references are equal, then it&#x27;s clear that the two objects pointed by the references are the same object. If the references do not compare equal, then it&#x27;s not necessarily guaranteed that the identity of the objects behind those references is different. The object identity of two objects of the same type is the same, if every change to either object is also a change to the other object.

== Identity and object-oriented conceptual model ==
Identity allows the construction of a platonic ideal world, the ontology or conceptual model, that is often used as basis of object-oriented thinking. The conceptual model describes the client side view to a domain, terminology or an API. This world contains point-like objects as instances, properties of the objects and links between those objects. The objects in the world can be grouped to form classes. The properties of the objects can be grouped to form roles. The links can be grouped to form associations. All locations in the world together with the links between the locations form the structure of the world. These groups are types of the corresponding instances of the world.

<text>Sattahip (, ) is a district (&quot;amphoe&quot;) in Chonburi province, Thailand. It is at the southern tip of the province southeast of Bangkok. In 2014, the district had a population of 157,000 in an area of 348.122 km2.

==Geography==
Neighboring districts are Bang Lamung to the north, Ban Chang of Rayong province to the east, and the Gulf of Thailand to the south and west.

===Islands===
Several islands are in Sattahip District, the largest of which is Ko Khram Yai. Many of the islands are in Sattahip Bay (อ่าวสัตหีบ).
==History==
The history of Sattahip begins with a woman named Jang, who owned much land in Sattahip District. Admiral Prince Abhakara Kiartivongse, a son of King Rama V, was sent to create a naval base at Sattahip. He thought it was perfect owing to the many small islands that protected it from wind and waves. He asked Jang for land on the seacoast, and she donated the area that the prince needed.

In Thai, &quot;satta&quot; () means &#x27;seven&#x27;, while hip () means &#x27;box&#x27; or &#x27;barrier&#x27;. Thus, Sattahip means the &#x27;seven barriers&#x27;, which are the islands that protect the coast of the district. These islands are Ko Phra, Ko Yo, Ko Mu, Ko Tao Mo, Ko Nen, Ko San Chalam and Ko Bo.

The minor district (king amphoe) Sattahip was created on 1 April 1937 by separating the sub-districts Sattahip and Na Chom Thien from Bang Lamung district. It was upgraded to a full district in 1953.

==Climate==

<text>Arthur Ocean Waskow (born Arthur Irwin Waskow, October 12, 1933) is an American author, political activist, and rabbi associated with the Jewish Renewal movement.

==Education and early career==
Waskow was born in Baltimore, Maryland. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1954 and a Ph.D. in American history from University of Wisconsin–Madison. He worked from 1959 to 1961 as legislative assistant to Congressman Robert Kastenmeier of Wisconsin. He was a senior fellow at the Peace Research Institute from 1961 through 1963. He joined Richard Barnet and Marcus Raskin and helped to found the Institute for Policy Studies in 1963, and he served as resident fellow until 1977.

In 1968 Waskow was elected an alternate delegate from the District of Columbia to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. His delegation was pledged to support Robert F. Kennedy, and after Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, Waskow proposed and the delegation agreed to nominate Reverend Channing Phillips, chair of the delegation, for President, the first Black American to be nominated at a major party convention.

Waskow was a contributing editor to &quot;Ramparts&quot; magazine, which published his &quot;Freedom Seder&quot; in 1969. The &quot;Freedom Seder&quot; was the first widely published Passover Haggadah that intertwined the archetypal liberation of the Israelites from slavery in Ancient Egypt with more modern liberation struggles such as the Civil Rights Movement and the women&#x27;s movement.

Through the 1960s, Waskow was active in writing, speaking, electoral politics, and nonviolent action against the Vietnam War. After 1963, he participated in sit-ins and teach-ins and was arrested many times for protests against racial segregation, the Vietnam War, the Soviet Union&#x27;s oppression of Jews, South African apartheid, and the Iraq war. In 1967, he was the co-author, with Marcus Raskin, of &quot;A Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority,&quot; a widely influential manifesto in support of those who resisted the military draft during the Vietnam War. In 1968, he signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.

==Religious initiatives==
Since 1969, Waskow has taken a leadership role in the Jewish Renewal movement. In 1971, he helped found the Fabrangen Havurah in Washington, DC. He notes that his experience at Fabrangen inspired his 1978 book &quot;Godwrestling&quot;. From 1982 to 1989, Waskow was a member of the faculty of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, where he taught courses on contemporary theology and practical rabbinics. He also taught in the religion departments of Swarthmore College, Temple University, Drew University, and Vassar College.

He founded The Shalom Center in 1983 and serves as its director. At first the center primarily addressed the threat of nuclear war; as the times demanded, it turned its focus toward ecology and human rights, then opposition to attacks on American Muslims and to the US War in Iraq, and more recently the dangers of global warming and the climate crisis. In 1993, Waskow co-founded . Between 1993 and 2005, he performed research, wrote, and spoke on behalf of ALEPH.

Waskow was ordained a rabbi in 1995 by a transdenominational beth din (rabbinical court) made up of Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, with Lubavitch Hasidic lineage; Rabbi Max Ticktin, ordained by the Jewish Theological Seminary (Conservative); Rabbi Laura Geller, ordained by the Hebrew Union College (Reform); and feminist theologian Dr. Judith Plaskow.

Waskow&#x27;s best-known books include &quot;Godwrestling&quot;, &quot;Seasons of Our Joy&quot;, &quot;Down-to-Earth Judaism: Food, Money, Sex, and the Rest of Life&quot;, and &quot;Godwrestling — Round 2: Ancient Wisdom, Future Paths&quot;. With Sr. Joan Chittister, OSB, and Murshid Saadi Shakur Chisti, he co-authored &quot;The Tent of Abraham&quot;. With Rabbi Phyllis Berman he co-authored &quot;Tales of Tikkun: New Jewish Stories to Heal the Wounded World&quot;, &quot;A Time for Every Purpose Under Heaven: The Jewish Life-Spiral as a Spiritual Journey&quot;, and &quot;Freedom Journeys: Tales of Exodus and Wilderness Across Millennia&quot;. He was the managing co-editor of &quot;Trees, Earth, and Torah: A Tu B&#x27;Shvat Anthology&quot;, and he edited &quot;Torah of the Earth: 4,000 Years of Jewish Thought on Ecology&quot; (2 vols).

== Views and public honors ==
Waskow took pioneering roles in supporting the full presence and equality of women and of LGBTQ people in all aspects of Jewish life and religion, including same-sex marriage; in mobilizing opposition in the Jewish and general communities to the Vietnam and then the Iraq wars; beginning in 1969, after his first summer-long sojourn in Israel and visits to the Occupied Territories, urging a two-state peace settlement between Israel and Palestine; in treating the planetary climate and extinction crises as a profound concern of Torah, necessitating action by the Jewish community; and in urging the Jewish community to treat the increasing concentration of top-down power by small minorities of the ultra-rich and by giant corporations as the reappearance of &quot;pharaoh&quot; in modern American life. In 2011, he (with Daniel Sieradski) co-inspired the creation of &quot;Kol Nidre in the Streets&quot; as a part of Occupy Wall Street. Since spring 2012 he has been a member of the Coordinating Committee of the US National Council of Elders, a network of veteran activists of the crucial justice and peace movements of the mid-20th century who are continuing their nonviolent social action and are partnering with the new movements of the 21st century.

Waskow pioneered in the development of Eco-Judaism in theology, liturgy, daily practice, and activism—through his books mentioned above as well as &quot;Torah of the Earth: 4,000 Years of Ecology in Jewish Thought&quot; and his essay on “Jewish Environmental Ethics: Adam and Adamah,” in &quot;Oxford Handbook of Jewish Ethics and Morality&quot;. Other activities included the Green Menorah organizing project of The Shalom Center, the Interfaith Freedom Seder for the Earth and climate-focused public actions drawing on traditional liturgies for Tu B’Shvat, Passover, Tisha B’Av, Sukkot, and Hanukkah, and running as a candidate for the World Zionist Congress on the Green Zionist Alliance slate. In 2010, Waskow joined in founding the Green Hevra, a network of Eco-Jewish organizations, and served on its stewardship committee till 2013. In 2012 he became a member of the steering committee of Interfaith Moral Action on Climate. He is also a practitioner of nonviolent civil disobedience who has been arrested in climate protests in the US Capitol, at the White House, and at Philadelphia conclaves of fracking corporate leaders.

In 2007, &quot;Newsweek&quot; named him one of the fifty most influential American rabbis. In that year also, the Neighborhood Interfaith Movement of Philadelphia presented him its Rev. Richard Fernandez Religious Leadership Award, and the Muslim American Society Freedom Foundation presented him its Peace and Justice Award. &quot;The Forward&quot; named him one of America&#x27;s &quot;Forward Fifty,&quot; creative leaders of American Jewish life. In 2014 he was honored by T&#x27;ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights with its first Lifetime Achievement Award as a Human Rights Hero. In 2015, &quot;The Jewish Daily Forward&quot; named him one of &quot;America&#x27;s most inspiring rabbis&quot;.

In 2017, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College awarded Waskow its once-a-year honorary doctorate of humane letters.

Waskow taught as a Visiting Professor in the religion departments of Swarthmore College (1982–83, on the thought of Martin Buber and on the Book of Genesis and its rabbinic and modern interpretations); Temple University (1975–76 on contemporary Jewish theology and 1985–86, on liberation theologies in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam); Drew University (1997–1998, on the ecological outlooks of ancient, rabbinic, and contemporary Judaism and on the synthesis of mysticism, feminism, and social action in the theology and practice of Jewish renewal); Vassar College (1999 on Jewish Renewal and Feminist Judaism); from 1982 to 1989 on the faculty of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College (contemporary theology and practical rabbinics); and in 2005 on the faculty of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute for Religion (the first course on Eco-Judaism in any rabbinical seminary).

Beginning with his first arrest in 1963, in a walk-in to end racial segregation by a Baltimore amusement park, and continuing through his arrest at the US Capitol in 2016 in a protest calling for more democratic election processes in the US — getting what he called &quot;Hyper-Wealth&quot; out of election campaigns and ending voter suppression aimed at disfranchising especially racial and ethnic minorities, the poor, the young, and the old— and most recently with arrests in Philadelphia at the ICE offices in protest of US governmental hostility to refugees and immigrants—he was arrested about 26 additional times, each time for a non-violent protest against racism, militarism, polluting the Earth, or interference with democratic process. He claimed each as a public honor and religious act, in the spirit of the remark by Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel after the Selma March for voting rights: &quot;I felt as if my legs were praying.&quot;

He continues to be a prolific writer and speaker in the public sphere on the topic of social justice through a Jewish Renewal lens. The Arthur Ocean Waskow Papers (1948-2009)] are archived at the American Jewish Historical Society. More recent papers are archived at the University of Colorado in Boulder.

<doc id="1282756" wikidata="Q2898630" url="?curid=1282756" title="Bernard Smith (organ builder)">
<text>&quot;Father&quot; Bernard Smith (c. 1630 – 1708) was a German-born master organ maker in England in the late seventeenth century.

Smith born as Bernhardt Schmidt in Halle, Germany, served his apprenticeship in Germany before emigrating to England in 1667. In 1681 he became the king&#x27;s organ maker and, in 1699, built an organ for the Banqueting House, Whitehall, which was at that time serving as a Chapel Royal to the court of William and Mary. The organ case is now at the Chapel Royal of St Peter ad Vincula at the Tower of London. Along with his hated rival Renatus Harris he was one of the two most prominent organ builders in late seventeenth-century Britain.

The rivalry between Smith and Harris led to the famous &quot;Battle of the Organs&quot; in 1684, when both were bidding for the contract to build the new organ for the Temple Church, London. Each man erected an organ in the Temple Church and then hired prominent organists to demonstrate the superiority of their instrument. Smith hired John Blow and Henry Purcell as his organists and won the contest.

Remnants of Smith organs survive at various places in the United Kingdom, though most survivals comprise only the casework. One of the best preserved cases is in the chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge. The organ that is now contained in this case (by Metzler, 1975) contains a number of restored Smith ranks.
Other notable Smith cases (this list is not exhaustive) can be found at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, Emmanuel College, Cambridge, St Mary the Great, Cambridge, St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London, and the above-mentioned chapel of St Peter ad Vincula. The west front of the organ at Durham Cathedral is preserved in the south aisle of the nave, and the choir organ is now the organ (with some original Smith ranks in use) of the chapel of University College, Durham.

Another surviving example of his work is in St Paul&#x27;s pro-cathedral, Malta. This organ originated in Chester Cathedral before being installed in Malta in 1844.

Bernard Smith was buried in St Margaret&#x27;s Church, Westminster, London, on the south side of the chancel, on 20 March 1708. There is no marker or monument. In the burial register he is described as &quot;organ maker in ordinary&quot;.

<text>Gotti is a 1996 American crime drama television film directed by Robert Harmon and written by Steve Shagan, based in part on the 1996 non-fiction book &quot;Gotti: Rise and Fall&quot; by Jerry Capeci and Gene Mustain. The film stars Armand Assante in the title role as infamous Gambino crime family boss John Gotti, along with William Forsythe, and Anthony Quinn. It aired on HBO on August 17, 1996.

Assante won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Special for his performance. Assante received nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie the same year.

==Plot==
The film starts In 1973 in New York, and ends in 1992, with Gotti&#x27;s imprisonment. Gotti&#x27;s association with three mobsters is also highlighted in the film: a father-son like relationship with Gambino underboss Aniello &quot;Neil&quot; Dellacroce, his deep but rocky friendship with Gotti crew member and longtime friend Angelo Ruggiero, and the respect and ultimate frustration that he felt for the man who became his underboss, Salvatore &quot;Sammy the Bull&quot; Gravano.

The film details Gotti&#x27;s rise within the Gambino crime family, as an unofficial soldier (&quot;soldato&quot;) sent to prison following the murder of James McBratney, then being promoted to captain (or &quot;capo&quot;) after Neil&#x27;s retirement, and finally becoming boss of the family by arranging a hit on &quot;Big&quot; Paul Castellano in 1985. Following the murder of Castellano, the film concentrates on the legal trials of John Gotti: one for assault and two for racketeering under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statutes.

Gotti&#x27;s famous personality, trial acquittals, and media attention are all dramatized. The film ends with Gotti&#x27;s conviction and sentencing to life imprisonment at Marion Federal Penitentiary in Marion, Illinois when Gravano turns state&#x27;s evidence and agrees to testify against Gotti in exchange for witness protection. The film is primarily based on the columns of reporter Jerry Capeci, who also wrote the novel that documented Gotti&#x27;s rise and fall inside the Gambino crime family and served as executive producer of the film which was based on his novel.

==Cast==
==Production==
Shooting took place in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Assante put on 35 pounds to play Gotti.

==Reception==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 60% rating based on five reviews, with an average rating of 5.20/10. Jeremy Girard of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a fairly standard-issue gangster flick&quot; that is problematic for its matter-of-fact presentation. Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized its &quot;docudrama syndrome&quot;, in which biographical dramas adhere closely to the historical record to prevent lawsuits despite the need for more characterization.

Howard Rosenberg of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;one of the better mob movies of the decade, and surely the best gangster portrait ever made primarily for television&quot;. &quot;TV Guide&quot; rated it 2/5 stars and described it as too detailed for casual viewers and too inaccurate for enthusiasts.
