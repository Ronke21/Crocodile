<doc id="1275281" wikidata="Q6081924" url="?curid=1275281" title="Islam in Guyana">
<text>[[Islam]] is the third largest religion in [[Guyana]], after Christianity and Hinduism, respectively. According to the 2012 census, 7% of the country’s population is Muslim. However, a Pew Research survey from 2010 estimates that 6.4% of the country is Muslim. Islam was first introduced to Guyana via enslaved people from West Africa, but was suppressed on plantations until Muslims from British India were brought to the country as indentured labour. The current President of Guyana, Mohamed Irfaan Ali is the first Muslim president.

The Islamic holidays of Eid al-Adha and Mawlid are national holidays in Guyana and Hosay (Ashura), Eid al-Fitr, Shab-e-Barat, Chaand Raat, Islamic New Year, and the month of Ramadan are also widely celebrated.

== History ==
As with most South American countries, Islam spread to Guyana through the transatlantic slave trade. Mandingo and Fulani Muslims were enslaved and brought from West Africa to work on Guyana&#x27;s sugar plantations. However, the oppressive conditions of slavery in the colony led the practice of Islam to essentially disappear until 1838 when 240,000 South Asians were brought from modern-day India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Records from the time show that while overwhelming majority of these servants were Hindu, a significant minority were Muslim.

Muslim Indo-Guyanese maintained their religious identity in spite of separation from their homeland by establishing mosques, Islamic organizations, and after World War 2, seeking international support aimed at creating &quot;a political space for colonial Muslims&quot;. By 1890, there were 29 mosques in Guyana, and 50 by 1920. Some of the earliest organizations include Queenstown Jama Masjid (founded 1895), the Young Men&#x27;s Muslim Literary Society (1926) and the United Sad’r Islamic Anjuman (1949). 

After Guyana&#x27;s independence from the British in 1966, Guyana established diplomatic relations with Arab countries such as Egypt, Iraq and Libya who opened embassies in the capital of Georgetown. Some Muslim youths went to Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Libya to study Islamic theology and the Arabic language. In 1996, President Cheddi Jagan of Guyana toured Syria, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Lebanon and appointed a Middle Eastern envoy. In the same year, Guyana officially became a permanent observer in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). 

In 1998, Guyana became the 56th full member state of the OIC. In August 2020, Dr. Mohamed Irfaan Ali became president of Guyana and first practising Muslim head of state in South America.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2012 census, approximately 6.8 percent of the population is Muslim (a total of 50,572 people). Almost all of the Muslims are of Indian descent, however there are a few Afro-Guyanese converts. The Muslim population is declining due to emigration. 
===Geographical distribution===
Essequibo Islands-West Demerara has the highest share of Muslims with nearly 12%, followed by East Berbice-Corentyne with 10% and Mahaica-Berbice with 9%. 
=== Ahmadiyy Community ===
The first Ahmadiyya missionary to Guyana arrived in 1908. A community was established in the country in the 1960s and has several mosques across the country including Georgetown, Rosignol, New Amsterdam and Sisters Village. This reform movement, founded in British India in the late nineteenth century, also has converts of the Afro-Guyanese community.

==Interfaith cooperation==
According to Guyanese-American professor Raymond Chickrie, Hindus and Muslims in Guyana have always had &quot;a cordial relationship among themselves. It would seem that these two groups had come to a mutual understanding of respecting each other&#x27;s space while culturally and even linguistically identifying with each other.&quot;

Among the Indo-Guyanese community, there is a tacit agreement to refrain from proselytizing between Muslims and Hindus. Guyanese Hindustani, Hindi, and Urdu is popular among Indo-Guyanese Muslims who watch films and listen to music from Bollywood. Political antagonism between Indo-Guyanese Muslims and Hindus is virtually non-existent, in contrast to India or other Indian diasporic communities such as Fiji. Intermarriage is perceived as a &quot;tolerated deviance&quot; rather than facing outright condemnation, as both are seen as being from the same Indian culture. However, marriage between people of the same religion and ethnicity is still preferred among Indo-Guyanese. In smaller villages, Hindus and Muslims come together to participate in each other&#x27;s ceremonies.

== Organizations ==

===Central Islamic Organization of Guyana===
The Central Islamic Organization of Guyana (CIOG) is the largest Islamic group in Guyana. They are involved in relief work and orphan sponsorships.

===Guyana Islamic Trust===
The Guyana Islamic Trust (GIT) is a multi-faceted, nonprofit organization which has been established since 1978. The GIT has dedicated itself to the process of bringing about intellectual, moral and spiritual improvement to individuals, families and communities in Guyana. Their goal is education, since they believe &quot;ignorance is the root cause of the intolerance, racism, immorality and criminality that pervades our society and our world.&quot; The Guyana Islamic Trust manages its grass root work through fourteen Administrative Districts. Some of GIT&#x27;s works include organizing classes, social activities, and youth programs, as well as partnering with Jamaats, and da’wah to Non-Muslims.

The National Islamic Sisters Association (NISA) is the women&#x27;s arm of the GIT and focuses on women&#x27;s faith-based and social needs.

=== Guyana United Sad’r Islamic Anjuman ===
The Guyana United Sad’r Islamic Anjuman (GUSIA) was founded in June 1973. It manages the Shaheed Girls’ Orphanage in Oleander Gardens and boys’ Orphanage in Kitty.

===Guyana Islamic Institute===
The Guyana Islamic Institute is an Islamic centre of learning established in 1986 for teaching Arabic Language, Qur&#x27;anic Sciences and Islamic Studies. 

=== National United Halaal Authority of Guyana (NUHA)===
The National United Halaal Authority of Guyana was established in 2011. This organisation is dedicated to the inspection and certification of Halal products and food establishments in Guyana.

<doc id="1275285" wikidata="Q7762314" url="?curid=1275285" title="The Saturday Press (Minneapolis)">
<text>The Saturday Press was the name of a newspaper, established in 1927 by Jay M. Near and Howard A. Guilford, and published in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The newspaper was run by Jay Near, who was an allegedly anti-Semitic, anti-labor and anti-Communist small-time editor. Daniel B. Moskowitz describes it as having &quot;traded in sensationalism, filling columns with a mishmash of pioneering exposes of public corruption and totally unsubstantiated calumny.&quot;

Floyd B. Olson, the future governor of Minnesota, brought a suit against Near and Guilford because their newspaper had an overly anti-Semitic tone, which Olsen claimed was a violation of the Public Nuisance Law, also known as the Minnesota Gag Law, of 1925. The scandal sheet published countless exposes until it was shut down in 1927 by the Gag Law. In 1931, the historic U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Near v. Minnesota&quot; struck the statute as unconstitutional. Prior restraint laws have never fared well in courts since, including the case of the Pentagon Papers. The paper re-appeared from 1932 to 1936, when Jay Near died in relative obscurity.

<doc id="1275289" wikidata="Q6129986" url="?curid=1275289" title="James Bond uncollected short stories">
<text>In the 1950s and 1960s, Ian Fleming, creator of the fictional secret agent, James Bond, wrote a number of short stories featuring his creation that appeared in the collections &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; and &quot;Octopussy and The Living Daylights&quot;. Since 1997, several more short stories featuring Bond or set within the official James Bond universe have been published by authors who continued chronicling the world of Fleming&#x27;s creation. The majority of these stories have, as of 2008, never been collected in book form, unlike the Fleming works. There are five exceptions: &quot;Blast from the Past&quot;, &quot;Midsummer Night&#x27;s Doom&quot; and &quot;Live at Five&quot; by Raymond Benson, &quot;Your Deal, Mr. Bond&quot; by Phillip and Robert King, and &quot;Bond Strikes Camp&quot; by Cyril Connolly which are discussed below.

==Raymond Benson short stories==
In the late 1990s, Raymond Benson, who at the time was the official novelist of the James Bond literary franchise, became the first author since Bond&#x27;s creator, Ian Fleming, to write officially sanctioned short stories featuring the superspy.

Just before his sudden departure from writing Bond novels at the start of 2003, Benson had indicated his intention to write more short pieces and publish a short story collection along the lines of Fleming&#x27;s &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; and &quot;Octopussy and The Living Daylights&quot;. This, however, has yet to occur.

To date these three stories remain the only pieces of James Bond literature that have never officially been published in Great Britain. Additionally, between 2001 and 2002, Benson wrote a fourth short story he planned to title &quot;The Heart of Erzulie&quot;, but it was never published.

===&quot;Blast from the Past&quot;===
First publication: &quot;Playboy&quot;, January 1997 issue. In publication order, this follows &quot;COLD&quot; and precedes &quot;Zero Minus Ten&quot;. Benson has stated that &quot;Playboy&quot; cut a third of the story for space reasons.

The first Bond story published by Benson, &quot;Blast from the Past&quot; is a direct sequel to Fleming&#x27;s &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; and appears to exist outside the timeline of either Benson&#x27;s or John Gardner&#x27;s other Bond stories.

Bond receives a message, apparently from his son James Suzuki (Suzuki&#x27;s mother is Kissy Suzuki from &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, now dead from ovarian cancer) asking him to come to New York City on an urgent matter. When Bond arrives, he finds his son murdered, having been poisoned with fugu. With the aid of an SIS agent, Bond learns that Irma Bunt, Ernst Stavro Blofeld&#x27;s henchwoman, killed James Suzuki as revenge for Blofeld&#x27;s death (again in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;). Bond ultimately kills Bunt, but his victory is hollow; he must live with having lost his son, and with the knowledge that he was never a real father to him.

The name of Bond&#x27;s son, James Suzuki, is taken from the John Pearson faux biography, &quot;James Bond: The Authorised Biography of 007&quot;.

&quot;Blast from the Past&quot; is included in the 2008 omnibus release, &quot;The Union Trilogy&quot;, which includes three additional Benson Bond novels. This makes &quot;Blast from the Past&quot; the first non-Fleming short story to be published in book form.

===&quot;Midsummer Night&#x27;s Doom&quot;===
First publication: &quot;Playboy&quot;, January 1999 issue. In publication order, this follows &quot;The Facts of Death&quot; and precedes &quot;High Time to Kill&quot;.

&quot;Midsummer Night&#x27;s Doom&quot; is a special story commissioned to help celebrate &quot;Playboy&quot;&#x27;s 45th anniversary. By Benson&#x27;s own admission, the short story is a joke piece.

In the story, Bond is assigned to attend a party at &quot;Playboy&quot; founder Hugh Hefner&#x27;s Playboy Mansion in Beverly Hills, California where Ministry of Defence secrets are expected to be sold to a representative of the Russian Mafia.

While there, Bond meets Hefner, who is aware of his mission and who actually provides Bond with several gadgets a la Q. Bond also has time to enjoy a quick romance with real-life Playmate Lisa Dergan, flirt with other Playmates including Victoria Zdrok, and rub elbows with the likes of actor Robert Culp and singer Mel Tormé.

Dergan has the distinction of being the first real person ever to be awarded the status of Bond Girl. (Several other Playmates are referenced by name in this story, but Dergan is clearly Bond&#x27;s girl of choice on this adventure.) However, Benson stated in a letter to &quot;Playboy&quot; that Zdrok was also a Bond Girl in the story.

Some sources give this story the erroneous title &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Doom&quot;, since the title is a play on William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. &quot;Midsummer&#x27;s Night&#x27;s Doom&quot; is included in the 2010 omnibus release, &quot;Choice of Weapons&quot;, which includes three additional Benson Bond novels.

===&quot;Live at Five&quot;===
First publication: &quot;TV Guide&quot; (American edition), 13–19 November 1999. In publication order, this follows the novelization of &quot;The World is Not Enough&quot; and precedes &quot;Doubleshot&quot;.

Published the week &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; arrived in cinemas in America, &quot;Live at Five&quot; is the shortest of all James Bond stories, even shorter than Fleming&#x27;s previous record-holder &quot;007 in New York&quot;. Running only a few thousand words, if that, it is a brief episode that sees Bond, en route to a date with a female TV news reporter, recalling how he once helped a Russian figure skating champion defect in full view of TV cameras. The reporter, Janet Davies, becomes the second real person to be a Bond girl, seen daily on Chicago&#x27;s local ABC station Channel 7 WLS.

&quot;Live at Five&quot; was finally reprinted in the 2010 omnibus release, &quot;Choice of Weapons&quot;, which includes three additional Benson Bond novels.

===&quot;The Heart of Erzulie&quot; (unpublished)===
A fourth short story, titled &quot;The Heart of Erzulie&quot;, was written by Raymond Benson in-between &quot;Never Dream of Dying&quot; and &quot;The Man with the Red Tattoo&quot;, but it was never published because Ian Fleming Publications felt it was &quot;too much of a Fleming pastiche.&quot; Benson, himself, acknowledges that it was little more than a time-killer in the interim between the two book projects. The story has since been published in Benson&#x27;s 2015 e-book anthology &quot;12+1--Twelve Short Thrillers and a Play&quot; with all references to James Bond removed.

==Samantha Weinberg/Kate Westbrook short stories==
In 2006, two additional short stories were written and published by Samantha Weinberg under the pseudonym &quot;Kate Westbrook&quot;. These stories are part of The Moneypenny Diaries series, an officially licensed spin-off from the Bond novels series focusing on the character of Miss Moneypenny. In September 2020, both stories were republished as a free ebook titled &quot;The Moneypenny Diaries: Secret Chapters&quot;.

===&quot;For Your Eyes Only, James&quot;===
First publication: &quot;Tatler&quot; (November 2006).

Set in September 1956, the story tells of a weekend Bond and Moneypenny share at Royale-les-Eaux.

===&quot;Moneypenny&#x27;s First Date with Bond&quot;===
First publication: &quot;The Spectator&quot;, 11 November 2006.

This story, set just after Bond&#x27;s assignment to the 00 Section and before the events of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, tells of Bond and Moneypenny&#x27;s first meeting.

==Charlie Higson short story==
===&quot;A Hard Man to Kill&quot;===
The original Young Bond short story &quot;A Hard Man to Kill&quot; written by Charlie Higson, is included in the companion book, &quot;Danger Society: The Young Bond Dossier&quot;, which was released by Puffin Books on 29 October 2009. An extract from the story appears in the paperback edition of &quot;By Royal Command&quot;. It is the longest James Bond short story yet written.

==William Boyd short story==
===&quot;William Boyd Interviews James Bond&quot;===
First publication: &quot;The Guardian&quot;, 28 September 2013 issue.

Written to promote the recent publication of Boyd&#x27;s Bond novel &quot;Solo&quot;, the story sees Boyd time-travel back to 1969 to interview James Bond.

Boyd walks through 1960s London to Bond&#x27;s flat, meets his new housekeeper, Donalda, a character introduced in &quot;Solo&quot;, and then Bond himself. The two share a drink and then go out for a meal, where Boyd accidentally alludes to his time of origin. The two men part after a friendly warning from Bond to not ask too many questions about him.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; also published a Q&amp;A by Boyd from this same fictional interview.

==Unauthorised works==

Several stories and one short story collection published without sanction from Glidrose/IFP warrant mention.

===&quot;Some Are Born Great&quot;===

&quot;Some Are Born Great&quot; was first published in the 3 September 1959 issue of &quot;Nursery World&quot;, later reprinted in the spring 1960 issue of Jonathan Cape&#x27;s in-house magazine &quot;Now &amp; Then&quot;, and then reprinted again in 2012 by Cinema Retro&#x27;s &quot;Movie Classics&quot;. The credited author—J.M. Harwood—is the screenwriter Johanna Harwood, who subsequently co-wrote the first two James Bond films, &quot;Dr. No&quot; and &quot;From Russia With Love&quot;. The story (which is less than a page in length) details an intense card game with Bond facing off against an unseen opponent, only to reveal in the end that it&#x27;s a game of &quot;Snap&quot; and this is a prepubescent Bond playing against a nanny.

===&quot;Bond Strikes Camp&quot;===

Cyril Connolly&#x27;s short story &quot;Bond Strikes Camp&quot; first appeared in the April 1963 issue of &quot;The London Magazine&quot;. Although a parody, the story clearly mentions Bond by name and code number. An expensive, privately printed edition of 50 copies was made by the Shenval Press in 1963. Soon after, the story appeared in Connolly&#x27;s miscellany collection &quot;Previous Convictions&quot;. Author, critic and Bond author Kingsley Amis compared the story unfavourably to &quot;The Harvard Lampoon&quot; spoof Bond novel &quot;Alligator&quot; by claiming that &quot;Parodies have their laughter-value, but the laughter is partly affectionate, and the successful parodist is moved partly by wanting to write like his original by wishing he&#x27;d thought of doing so first. Mr Cyril Connolly no doubt doesn&#x27;t wish this in regard to Mr Fleming; his &#x27;Bond Strikes Camp&#x27;, in which M orders Bond to dress up as a woman, ostensibly for purposes of espionage, and then tries to get him into bed, is much too far from the original, never catches the note, gets elementary details wrong. E.g. M is made to call Bond &#x27;Bond&#x27;. This happened last in 1954 (&quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, ch. 2). Every Fleming fan knows it&#x27;s either &#x27;James&#x27; or &#x27;007&#x27;.&quot;

===&quot;Holmes Meets 007&quot;===
Donald Stanley wrote this short story - under 2000 words - first published in &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; on 29 November 1964. The Beaune Press (San Francisco) subsequently published 247 copies of this seven page story in December 1967. There is no copy 222: this is instead numbered 221B. Copies 223 through to 247 are numbered I to XXV and were printed especially for the author&#x27;s friends.

Dr. John Watson, Sherlock Holmes&#x27; assistant, narrates the story. M and Bond visit Holmes and Watson at Holmes&#x27; Baker Street address. Holmes&#x27; deductive abilities impress M, who wishes Bond had the same talent. Bond questions if such intuitive talents could hold up against a SMERSH assassin. Bond confronts Holmes about the latter&#x27;s drug addiction and accuses Watson of being the source of Holmes&#x27; narcotics supplier. Once Holmes admits it, Bond aims his Walther PPF [sic] at Watson and announces that Watson is an impostor, and none other than Bond&#x27;s arch-enemy Ernst Stavro Blofeld - the man who killed Bond&#x27;s wife Tracy. Holmes throughout the meeting has been fiddling his Stradivarius - much to everyone&#x27;s annoyance - and brings it crashing down, knocking Bond&#x27;s gun away. Holmes plunges a needle containing morphine into M&#x27;s arm, quickly rendering him unconscious. Holmes reveals that M is none other than Professor Moriarty; Bond is nothing more than a &quot;fairly ignorant tool&quot; who had been unaware of his boss&#x27;s treachery all this time.

===&quot;Toadstool&quot;===

&quot;The Harvard Lampoon&quot;, responsible for the Bond spoof &quot;Alligator&quot;, published another &quot;J*mes B*nd&quot; story. &quot;Toadstool&quot; appeared in &quot;PL*YB*Y&quot;, the 1966 &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot; parody of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine.

===&quot;License to Hug&quot;===

Will Self&#x27;s story &quot;License to Hug&quot; appeared in the November 1995 issue of &quot;Esquire&quot;. Bond goes to Holland to kill an IRA hitman involved in drug smuggling. This story, part thriller, part satire on modern life, also mentions Bond by name and code number. Sorrell Kerbel notes that &quot;Self proves just as adept at skewering by mimicry the stiff upper lip style and macho substance of Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond books as he is at pillorying the brave new world of political correctness (with its very own thought police) in which the &#x27;Therapeutic Hug and Stroke&#x27; is the weapon of choice.&quot;

===&quot;Your Deal, Mr. Bond&quot;===

The title piece of Phillip and Robert King&#x27;s 2002 collection of bridge-related short stories, &quot;Your Deal, Mr. Bond&quot;, features a James Bond who is assigned by M to defeat a villain named Saladin. Bond impersonates real-life bridge expert Zia Mahmood in order to combat Saladin at the bridge table. The short story includes bridge game charts in a similar fashion to that used by Ian Fleming in &quot;Moonraker&quot;, in which Bond similarly plays a high-stakes game of bridge against that novel&#x27;s villain. The book, despite being issued by a major publisher and containing undisguised references to the Bond characters, contains no reference to Ian Fleming Publications, suggesting the use of Bond, M and Miss Moneypenny is unofficial, and rendering this story likely apocryphal. Its placement in the Bond canon, therefore, is unknown. The story contains a cultural reference to &quot;Star Trek&quot;, however, which sets it outside of Fleming&#x27;s timeline. It should not be confused with the 1987 John Gardner Bond novel, &quot;No Deals, Mr. Bond&quot;.

The authors also wrote the 1996 pastiche compilation &quot;Farewell, My Dummy&quot;, which featured bridge novellas, each one parodies a different author in turn: Jeffrey Archer, Jane Austen, Raymond Chandler, Arthur Conan Doyle and Victor Mollo.

===&quot;Licence Expired: The Unauthorized James Bond&quot; (short story collection)===
On 1 January 2015, the original Ian Fleming novels and short stories entered the public domain in Canada and other countries in which the length of copyright remains at the Berne Convention minimum of the life of the author plus 50 years. As a result, it is now legal in those countries for the original writings of Ian Fleming to be republished, or adapted into other media, without permission of the Fleming estate or its agent, Ian Fleming Publications (formerly known as Gildrose Publications). It is also now legal in those countries for original material based on Bond and other characters and concepts introduced in Fleming&#x27;s written works (though not those elements that are unique to Eon Production&#x27;s Bond movies) to be published.

In late 2015, independent Canadian publishing house ChiZine Publications released &quot;Licence Expired: The Unauthorized James Bond&quot;, an anthology of 19 Bond short stories written by various Canadian and non-Canadian authors including Jeffrey Ford, Charles Stross, A.M. Dellamonica, James Alan Gardner, Corey Redekop, Jacqueline Baker, Richard Lee Byers, Laird Barron, Kathryn Kuitenbrouwer, Karl Schroeder, Claude Lalumiere, Robert Wiersema, and Ian Rogers. The stories examine different stages of the character&#x27;s life from childhood to old age. The book&#x27;s introduction states explicitly that due to copyright issues, it is not authorized for sale outside Canada. Thus, while the stories within have been collected, they remain unpublished officially outside Canada as of 2023.

<doc id="1275306" wikidata="Q6942206" url="?curid=1275306" title="Music of New Brunswick">
<text>New Brunswick offers musical entertainment at different venues, including the Harvest Jazz &amp; Blues Festival in Fredericton and Symphony New Brunswick, with its main series occurring in Saint John, Moncton and Fredericton.

==Festivals==
New Brunswick&#x27;s capital city is Fredericton, which is home to the Harvest Jazz &amp; Blues Festival, an annual event. The Nashwaak Music Festival is an annual event, featuring Country, Roots and Folk music. Held every New Brunswick Day weekend 20 km north of Fredericton.

The Moncton music scene local Acadian and songwriters as well as concert festivals held at Magnetic Hill Concert Site.

Saint John&#x27;s main music festival is Area 506, where each summer East Coast musicians gather dock side along the city&#x27;s harbour. 

The city of Miramichi is best known for its country and bluegrass music, featuring a blend of Acadian, Irish and Scot&#x27;s traditional style of music. The Miramichi Folksong Festival preserves the history and rich musical traditions of northeastern New Brunswick.

Sappyfest is an annual independent festival held in Sackville, New Brunswick founded by Sappy Records.

==Country music==
The introduction of radio to the province in the 1920s gave local country artists exposure to a wide audience, and several musicians parlayed this exposure into successful musical careers. Radio/television pioneer Don Messer debuted on Saint John station CFBO in 1929, later gaining fame as the host of the popular CBC program &quot;Don Messer&#x27;s Jubilee&quot;. Fiddler Ned Landry made his first CFBO appearance in 1934, and would eventually record eight albums with RCA Victor in the 1950s.

New Brunswick has also produced several popular contemporary country artists, including Julian Austin and Chris Cummings.

<doc id="1275331" wikidata="Q3929897" url="?curid=1275331" title="Red-giant branch">
<text>The red-giant branch (RGB), sometimes called the first giant branch, is the portion of the giant branch before helium ignition occurs in the course of stellar evolution. It is a stage that follows the main sequence for low- to intermediate-mass stars. Red-giant-branch stars have an inert helium core surrounded by a shell of hydrogen fusing via the CNO cycle. They are K- and M-class much larger and more luminous than main-sequence stars of the same temperature.

==Discovery==

Red giants were identified early in the 20th century when the use of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram made it clear that there were two distinct types of cool stars with very different sizes: dwarfs, now formally known as the main sequence; and giants.

The term &quot;red-giant branch&quot; came into use during the 1940s and 1950s, although initially just as a general term to refer to the red-giant region of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. Although the basis of a thermonuclear main-sequence lifetime, followed by a thermodynamic contraction phase to a white dwarf was understood by 1940, the internal details of the various types of giant stars were not known.

In 1968, the name asymptotic giant branch (AGB) was used for a branch of stars somewhat more luminous than the bulk of red giants and more unstable, often large-amplitude variable stars such as Mira. Observations of a bifurcated giant branch had been made years earlier but it was unclear how the different sequences were related. By 1970, the red-giant region was well understood as being made up from subgiants, the RGB itself, the horizontal branch, and the AGB, and the evolutionary state of the stars in these regions was broadly understood. The red-giant branch was described as the first giant branch in 1967, to distinguish it from the second or asymptotic giant branch, and this terminology is still frequently used today.

Modern stellar physics has modelled the internal processes that produce the different phases of the post-main-sequence life of moderate-mass stars, with ever-increasing complexity and precision. The results of RGB research are themselves being used as the basis for research in other areas.

==Evolution==

When a star with a mass from about (solar mass) to ( for low-metallicity stars) exhausts its core hydrogen, it enters a phase of hydrogen shell burning during which it becomes a red giant, larger and cooler than on the main sequence. During hydrogen shell burning, the interior of the star goes through several distinct stages which are reflected in the outward appearance. The evolutionary stages vary depending primarily on the mass of the star, but also on its metallicity.

===Subgiant phase===
After a main-sequence star has exhausted its core hydrogen, it begins to fuse hydrogen in a thick shell around a core consisting largely of helium. The mass of the helium core is below the Schönberg–Chandrasekhar limit and is in thermal equilibrium, and the star is a subgiant. Any additional energy production from the shell fusion is consumed in inflating the envelope and the star cools but does not increase in luminosity.

Shell hydrogen fusion continues in stars of roughly solar mass until the helium core increases in mass sufficiently that it becomes degenerate. The core then shrinks, heats up and develops a strong temperature gradient. The hydrogen shell, fusing via the temperature-sensitive CNO cycle, greatly increases its rate of energy production and the stars is considered to be at the foot of the red-giant branch. For a star the same mass as the sun, this takes approximately 2 billion years from the time that hydrogen was exhausted in the core.

Subgiants more than about reach the Schönberg–Chandrasekhar limit relatively quickly before the core becomes degenerate. The core still supports its own weight thermodynamically with the help of energy from the hydrogen shell, but is no longer in thermal equilibrium. It shrinks and heats causing the hydrogen shell to become thinner and the stellar envelope to inflate. This combination decreases luminosity as the star cools towards the foot of the RGB. Before the core becomes degenerate, the outer hydrogen envelope becomes opaque which causes the star to stop cooling, increases the rate of fusion in the shell, and the star has entered the RGB. In these stars, the subgiant phase occurs within a few million years, causing an apparent gap in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram between B-type main-sequence stars and the RGB seen in young open clusters such as Praesepe. This is the Hertzsprung gap and is actually sparsely populated with subgiant stars rapidly evolving towards red giants, in contrast to the short densely populated low-mass subgiant branch seen in older clusters such as ω Centauri.

===Ascending the red-giant branch===
Stars at the foot of the red-giant branch all have a similar temperature around , corresponding to an early to mid-K spectral type. Their luminosities range from a few times the luminosity of the sun for the least massive red giants to several thousand times as luminous for stars around .

As their hydrogen shells continue to produce more helium, the cores of RGB stars increase in mass and temperature. This causes the hydrogen shell to fuse more rapidly. Stars become more luminous, larger and somewhat cooler. They are described as ascending the RGB.

On the ascent of the RGB, there are a number of internal events that produce observable external features. The outer convective envelope becomes deeper and deeper as the star grows and shell energy production increases. Eventually it reaches deep enough to bring fusion products to the surface from the formerly convective core, known as the first dredge-up. This changes the surface abundance of helium, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. A noticeable clustering of stars at one point on the RGB can be detected and is known as the RGB bump. It is caused by a discontinuity in hydrogen abundance left behind by the deep convection. Shell energy production temporarily decreases at this discontinuity, effective stalling the ascent of the RGB and causing an excess of stars at that point.

===Tip of the red-giant branch===

For stars with a degenerate helium core, there is a limit to this growth in size and luminosity, known as the tip of the red-giant branch, where the core reaches sufficient temperature to begin fusion. All stars that reach this point have an identical helium core mass of almost , and very similar stellar luminosity and temperature. These luminous stars have been used as standard candle distance indicators. Visually, the tip of the red-giant branch occurs at about absolute magnitude −3 and temperatures around 3,000 K at solar metallicity, closer to 4,000 K at very low metallicity. Models predict a luminosity at the tip of , depending on metallicity. In modern research, infrared magnitudes are more commonly used.

===Leaving the red-giant branch===
A degenerate core begins fusion explosively in an event known as the helium flash, but externally there is little immediate sign of it. The energy is consumed in lifting the degeneracy in the core. The star overall becomes less luminous and hotter and migrates to the horizontal branch. All degenerate helium cores have approximately the same mass, regardless of the total stellar mass, so the helium fusion luminosity on the horizontal branch is the same. Hydrogen shell fusion can cause the total stellar luminosity to vary, but for most stars at near solar metallicity, the temperature and luminosity are very similar at the cool end of the horizontal branch. These stars form the red clump at about 5,000 K and . Less massive hydrogen envelopes cause the stars to take up a hotter and less luminous position on the horizontal branch, and this effect occurs more readily at low metallicity so that old metal-poor clusters show the most pronounced horizontal branches.

Stars initially more massive than have non-degenerate helium cores on the red-giant branch. These stars become hot enough to start triple-alpha fusion before they reach the tip of the red-giant branch and before the core becomes degenerate. They then leave the red-giant branch and perform a blue loop before returning to join the asymptotic giant branch. Stars only a little more massive than perform a barely noticeable blue loop at a few hundred before continuing on the AGB hardly distinguishable from their red-giant branch position. More massive stars perform extended blue loops which can reach 10,000 K or more at luminosities of . These stars will cross the instability strip more than once and pulsate as Type I (Classical) Cepheid variables.

===Properties===
The table below shows the typical lifetimes on the main sequence (MS), subgiant branch (SB) and red-giant branch (RGB), for stars with different initial masses, all at solar metallicity (Z = 0.02). Also shown are the helium core mass, surface effective temperature, radius and luminosity at the start and end of the RGB for each star. The end of the red-giant branch is defined to be when core helium ignition takes place.
Intermediate-mass stars only lose a small fraction of their mass as main-sequence and subgiant stars, but lose a significant amount of mass as red giants.

The mass lost by a star similar to the Sun affects the temperature and luminosity of the star when it reaches the horizontal branch, so the properties of red-clump stars can be used to determine the mass difference before and after the helium flash. Mass lost from red giants also determines the mass and properties of the white dwarfs that form subsequently. Estimates of total mass loss for stars that reach the tip of the red-giant branch are around . Most of this is lost within the final million years before the helium flash.

Mass lost by more massive stars that leave the red-giant branch before the helium flash is more difficult to measure directly. The current mass of Cepheid variables such as δ Cephei can be measured accurately because there are either binaries or pulsating stars. When compared with evolutionary models, such stars appear to have lost around 20% of their mass, much of it during the blue loop and especially during pulsations on the instability strip.

==Variability==
Some red giants are large amplitude variables. Many of the earliest-known variable stars are Mira variables with regular periods and amplitudes of several magnitudes, semiregular variables with less obvious periods or multiple periods and slightly lower amplitudes, and slow irregular variables with no obvious period. These have long been considered to be asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars or supergiants and the red-giant branch (RGB) stars themselves were not generally considered to be variable. A few apparent exceptions were considered to be low-luminosity AGB stars.

Studies in the late 20th century began to show that all giants of class M were variable with amplitudes of 10 milli-magnitudes of more, and that late-K-class giants were also likely to be variable with smaller amplitudes. Such variable stars were amongst the more luminous red giants, close to the tip of the RGB, but it was difficult to argue that they were all actually AGB stars. The stars showed a period amplitude relationship with larger-amplitude variables pulsating more slowly.

Microlensing surveys in the 21st century have provided extremely accurate photometry of thousands of stars over many years. This has allowed for the discovery of many new variable stars, often of very small amplitudes. Multiple period-luminosity relationships have been discovered, grouped into regions with &quot;ridges&quot; of closely spaced parallel relationships. Some of these correspond to the known Miras and semi-regulars, but an additional class of variable star has been defined: OGLE Small Amplitude Red Giants, or OSARGs. OSARGs have amplitudes of a few thousandths of a magnitude and semi-regular periods of 10 to 100 days. The OGLE survey published up to three periods for each OSARG, indicating a complex combination of pulsations. Many thousands of OSARGs were quickly detected in the Magellanic Clouds, both AGB and RGB stars. A catalog has since been published of 192,643 OSARGs in the direction of the Milky Way central bulge. Although around a quarter of Magellanic Cloud OSARgs show long secondary periods, very few of the galactic OSARGs do.

The RGB OSARGs follow three closely spaced period-luminosity relations, corresponding to the first, second and third overtones of radial pulsation models for stars of certain masses and luminosities, but that dipole and quadrupole non-radial pulsations are also present leading to the semi-regular nature of the variations. The fundamental mode does not appear, and the underlying cause of the excitation is not known. Stochastic convection has been suggested as a cause, similar to solar-like oscillations.

Two additional types of variation have been discovered in RGB stars: long secondary periods, which are associated with other variations but can show larger amplitudes with periods of hundreds or thousands of days; and &quot;ellipsoidal&quot; variations. The cause of the long secondary periods is unknown, but it has been proposed that they are due to interactions with low-mass companions in close orbits. The ellipsoidal variations are also thought to be created in binary systems, in this case contact binaries where distorted stars cause strictly periodic variations as they orbit.

<text>Ephraim Ruebush (September 26, 1833 – November 18, 1924) was a music teacher, publisher, and co-founder of the Ruebush-Kieffer Company, one of the largest and most influential publishers of gospel song books in the United States. 

Ephraim Ruebush was born in Churchville, Virginia, the son of John Ruebush and Mary Huffman. In September 1853, he traveled to Singers Glen, Virginia, to study music and printing under Joseph Funk. He married Lucille Virginia Kieffer on March 28, 1861. With his brother-in-law, Aldine Silliman Kieffer, he founded the Kieffer-Ruebush music company in Dayton, Virginia. This became one of the largest and most influential gospel music companies of its day, printing songbooks into the 1940s. Ruebush died on November 18, 1924, and is buried in Dayton.

Jacob Henry Hall, an author of books on gospel music and a book on gospel songwriters, was associated with the company.

<text>The Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum is the presidential library and burial place of Herbert Clark Hoover, the 31st president of the United States (1929–1933), located on the grounds of the Herbert Hoover National Historic Site in West Branch, Iowa. The library is one of thirteen presidential libraries run by the National Archives and Records Administration.

In 1954, a group of Hoover&#x27;s friends incorporated the Herbert Hoover Birthplace Foundation to raise money for the preservation of his birthplace and the area around it, and to plan for improvements to the site. One of their ideas was to build a small museum, and with Hoover&#x27;s approval work began in the late 1950s. The architectural firm of Eggers and Higgins of New York drew the plans for the original building, a modest limestone structure of just over 4,000 square feet. While the museum at West Branch was still under construction, Hoover decided to expand it and to make it his Presidential Library.

The Library and Museum was officially dedicated and opened to the public on August 10, 1962, Hoover&#x27;s 88th birthday. Hoover and former President Harry S. Truman were present at the dedication. Hoover began his speech by saying, 
When the members of the Congress created these presidential libraries they did a great public service. They made available for research the records of vital periods in American historyand they planted these records in the countryside instead of allowing their concentration on the seaboard.

Already the three libraries of President Roosevelt, President Truman, and President Eisenhower, by their unique documentation, serve this purpose, and today we dedicate a fourthmy own.

Within them are thrilling records of supreme action by the American people, their devotion and sacrifice to their ideals.
Santayana rightly said: &quot;Those who do not remember the past are condemned to relive it.&quot; These institutions are the repositories of such experiencehot off the griddle.

In these records there are, no doubt, unfavorable remarks made by our political opponents, as well as expressions of appreciation and affection by our friends.

We may hope that future students will rely upon our friends. In any event, when they become sleepy they may be awakened by the lightning flashes of American political humor.


The original Library and Museum building was expanded several times, with major additions being completed in 1964, 1971, 1974 and 1992. The architects for the 1964, 1971, and 1974 expansion projects were Wetherell, Harrison &amp; Wagner Associates.

On August 8, 1992, former President Ronald Reagan rededicated the Library and Museum. The rededication was the result of a renovation project that expanded the library to . The $6.5-million expansion was a publicprivate partnership, with Washington supplying $5 million for bricks and mortar, supplementing $1.5 million raised by the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library Association for new exhibits. The architects for the 1992 expansion were HNTB Corp.
Holding almost 300 collections, the Library is an important center for the study of conservative thought, agricultural economics, famine relief, commercial aviation, political journalism, government efficiency and reorganization, isolationism, and U.S. foreign policy. In addition to the papers of Herbert Hoover, the manuscript holdings include those of Lewis Strauss, Gerald P. Nye, Felix Morley, Clark Mollenhoff, Robert E. Wood, Westbrook Pegler, and Laura Ingalls Wilder, among others.

The Library and Museum is located within the Herbert Hoover National Historic Site, which contains Hoover&#x27;s birthplace, a reconstruction of Hoover&#x27;s father&#x27;s blacksmith shop, a one-room schoolhouse, a Quaker meeting house, andon a hill overlooking the Library and Museum and Historic Sitethe graves of Herbert and Lou Henry Hoover.

<doc id="1275371" wikidata="Q523170" url="?curid=1275371" title="Cristobal Huet">
<text>Cristobal Huet (; born September 3, 1975) is a French former professional ice hockey goaltender who is currently a goalie coach for Lausanne HC of the National League (NL). He previously played for HC Lugano and HC Fribourg-Gottéron and within the Chicago Blackhawks, Los Angeles Kings, Montreal Canadiens, and Washington Capitals organizations in the National Hockey League (NHL). He is the first French netminder and second French-trained player overall (after Philippe Bozon) to play in the NHL. He currently co-hosts hockey TV show, &quot;Le Repas d&#x27;équipe&quot;, with fellow French-born Swiss former player Laurent Meunier on MySports.

Huet won the Stanley Cup with the Chicago Blackhawks in 2010, and became the first Frenchman to win the Stanley Cup as a player. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2023.

==Playing career==
===Amateur===
As a youth, Huet played in the 1988 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a team from Grenoble.

===HC Lugano===
Huet played for HC Lugano from the 1998–99 season to 2001–02. His career took a significant turn in these years. He won the National League A Championship in his first year, and reached the European Hockey League final four the next year.

===Los Angeles Kings (2002–2005)===
Huet was drafted by the Los Angeles Kings as their seventh-round pick, 214th overall, in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft. He played for the Kings in the 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 seasons. He was traded to the Montreal Canadiens in a three-team deal that sent Mathieu Garon to Los Angeles and Radek Bonk from Ottawa to Montreal. During the 2004–05 lockout Huet played for the Adler Mannheim in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga. He led the team to the finals, where the Eagles lost in three straight games to Eisbären Berlin.

===Montreal Canadiens (2005–2008)===
During the 2005–06 season, Huet eventually won the starting job in goal for the Canadiens at the expense of José Théodore, who was subsequently traded to Colorado in exchange for goaltender David Aebischer. He also won the Molson Cup in February 2006. He won the Best Defensive Player award from the NHL during the first week of March, ousting goaltenders such as the Ottawa Senators&#x27; Ray Emery and the New Jersey Devils&#x27; Martin Brodeur, with a 3–0–0 record and a 1.67 GAA. For the second time of the year, he was named NHL Best Defensive Player on April 3 with a 3–0–0 record, a 0.65 GAA and 0.979 SV%, ousting goaltenders Martin Brodeur, Flames goalie Miikka Kiprusoff and Detroit&#x27;s Manny Legace.

On April 23, in his first NHL playoff start, Huet starred in a 6–1 win against the 2nd seeded and eventual Stanley Cup champion Carolina Hurricanes. Huet stopped 42 of 43 shots in the contest to put the Canadiens up 1–0 in the seven-game series. Two days later, Huet recorded his first overtime playoff win, when the Canadiens beat the Hurricanes 6–5 in double overtime to take the lead 2–0 in the series. However, Huet and the Canadiens lost the next four games and the series in goaltender duels with rookie Cam Ward, who had taken Martin Gerber&#x27;s starting spot in the series, and who would later go on to win the Conn Smythe Trophy.

The Canadiens re-signed Huet in the 2006 off-season to a two-year deal at $5.75 million total, earning $3 million the first season and $2.75 million in the second year.

On January 13, 2007, Huet was announced as one of the three goalies of the Eastern Conference All-Star Team in the 55th NHL All-Star Game in Dallas. A month later, however, he suffered a left hamstring injury that caused him to miss most of the final two months of the season. In his absence, the Canadiens struggled, and the team missed the postseason.

===Washington Capitals (2008)===
On February 26, 2008, Montreal Canadiens general manager Bob Gainey traded the French netminder to the Washington Capitals for a 2009 second-round draft pick. The Canadiens decided to trade Huet because of highly touted prospect, Carey Price. In Washington, he took over the starting position from Olaf Kölzig, pushing incumbent backup Brent Johnson to the pressbox, and his exceptional play helped lead Washington to secure a playoff berth, where they lost the opening round series against the Philadelphia Flyers in seven games.

===Chicago Blackhawks (2008–2010)===
On July 1, 2008, the first day of unrestricted free-agency, Huet agreed to terms on a new 4-year contract with the Chicago Blackhawks worth a total of $22.4 million or $5.625 million per season.

Following the signing, Blackhawks general manager Dale Tallon announced the team would enter the season with a tandem of Huet and Nikolai Khabibulin. Unable to win the starting job over Khabibulin to start the season, Huet found himself on the bench more often than not. Gradually, he earned back his playing time and both alternated every game for almost 3 months until Khabibulin went down with a groin injury in early February. The tandem, however, earned praise around the NHL. A second Khabibulin injury in early February thrust Huet in the spotlight once again, and he was named the NHL&#x27;s 3rd star of the week for Feb 15–21, posting a 3–0–0 record and allowing just five goals on 72 shots. In the end however, Khabibulin was named the playoff starter for the Blackhawks, and they defeated the Calgary Flames in the first round as well as the Vancouver Canucks in the second round.

Huet made his next appearance for the Blackhawks during game three of the 2009 Western Conference Finals, where he was called to replace an injured Khabibulin. He made six saves, and allowed the Blackhawks to collect an overtime win. With Khabibulin still recovering from a lower body injury, Joel Quenneville named Huet the team&#x27;s starting goalie for the fourth game against Detroit. Huet allowed five goals on 21 shots, and was temporarily replaced by Corey Crawford. During the final game of the series, Huet stopped 44 shots en route to a 2–1 overtime loss.

For the first time in his career, Huet started a season as the undisputed number one goaltender, but as the 2009–10 campaign wore on, Antti Niemi eventually replaced Huet as Chicago&#x27;s starter going into the playoffs. Huet played only twenty minutes in the 2010 Stanley Cup Playoffs, which the Blackhawks won with Niemi in net and with an overall playoff record of 16–6. With the Hawks victory, Huet became the first native of France to get his name engraved on the Stanley Cup.

===Fribourg-Gotteron (2010–2012)===
On September 27, 2010, Chicago loaned Huet to HC Fribourg-Gotteron of the Swiss National League A in order to stay within the salary cap. In his first year with Fribourg-Gotteron, Huet played in 41 games but struggled in the second half of the season, accumulating a 2.84 goals against average as the team finished 8th. Fribourg qualified for the playoffs only to be swept by HC Davos. The following season he improved to a goals against average of 1.99 in 39 games, third best in the league that year. The team defeated HC Lugano in the quarterfinals in 6 games but lost to SC Bern in the semifinals in 5 games. Huet&#x27;s loan and his contract with the Blackhawks expired when the playoffs ended, thus making him a free agent.

===Lausanne HC (2012–2018)===

Huet signed a 4-year deal with Lausanne HC of the National League B. His first season in Lausanne was a success, as the team won the National League B title and went on to win promotion to the National League by defeating SC Langnau in the qualification round.

===Retirement from the French national team===
In May 2017, Huet played at the 2017 IIHF World Championship, in Paris, representing France. He played his last game at the final round robin game of France, against Slovenia, with a win, and ended with a standing ovation, retiring with France&#x27;s Team Captain Laurent Meunier. Team France (Les Bleus) did not advance to the medal round, but was not relegated.

<doc id="1275372" wikidata="Q16823034" url="?curid=1275372" title="Music of Prince Edward Island">
<text>Prince Edward Island is a province of Canada consisting of the island of the same name, and several much smaller islands. Prince Edward Island is one of the three Maritime Provinces and is the smallest province in both land area and population.

The musical culture is changing rapidly in Prince Edward Island at this time as traditional Celtic musicians, while in some ways more prominent than ever, are not as common in small rural communities as they once were. Celtic music is still very much around and can be heard at festivals, ceilidhs and pubs throughout the island, especially in the summer. That being said traditional Scottish ceilidhs are rarely frequented by young people and the younger generation has been diverging along an urban rural divide, in that young people in rural parts of the island now tend to follow Country and Western music, almost assuming it is an extension of local tradition, due to the similarities, when it is in fact an American import. Before the introduction of radio to the island, Country and Western music was unheard of and in most places traditional Celtic or Acadian music dominated. Due to the rural farming traditions of the Island and the similarities between Country Music and Celtic Music, Country Music quickly became popular in the 1930s. It was an easy adoption, considering that the Bluegrass/Mountain Music which spawned Country and Western Music, is closely related to the Celtic and Maritime musical tradition. Even the Ceilidh itself is suffering. With fewer young people attending them, they are becoming more of a tourist attraction than an actual living form of culture. While Celtic music on the island may appear to some to be stronger than ever due to the promotion of many world class island musicians, its place in the rural, local culture has been somewhat diminished.

That being said, there is a strong effort to revive Celtic culture on the island, from the PEI Fiddle Camp held every July, to the availability of Gaelic classes at Colonel Gray High School in Charlottetown. Other festivities, events and locations promoting local traditional music culture include: Rollo Bay Fiddle Festival which was created to preserve Prince Edward Island&#x27;s tradition of music, Close to the Ground concert series hosted by Fiddler&#x27;s Sons, The International PEI Shellfish Festival hosted by Liam Dolan, The Festival of Small Halls, the College of Piping and Celtic Performing Arts concert series (Highland Storm), The Benevolent Irish Society Ceilis, The Orwell Corner ceilidhs, the Summerside Highland Gathering, the Belfast (PEI) Highland Games, the Indian River Festival and more. The summer time is the best time of the year to experience PEI traditional music and despite the concerns noted above, if you were to tour the island in the Summer, you would leave with the impression that the traditional Celtic and Acadian cultures brought the island over 300 years ago were remarkably intact.

==Prince Edward Island Symphony Orchestra==
The Prince Edward Island Symphony Orchestra (PEISO) is a community orchestra based in Charlottetown and founded in 1967. It consists of professional, amateur, and student musicians, and is currently led by conductor Mark Shapiro. The PEISO&#x27;s annual concert season consists of four programs, which are performed at the Confederation Centre of the Arts or at Zion Presbyterian Church.

==Charlottetown==

Charlottetown is the capital and largest city on the island. Its documented music history begins in the 19th century, with religious music, some written by local pump and block maker, and organ-importer, Watson Duchemin. Several big bands including the Sons of Temperance Band and the Charlottetown Brass Band, were active.

By the end of the century, Charlottetown had its own opera house, performing comic operas by Gilbert and Sullivan.

The Prince Edward Island Music Festival was first held in 1946, inaugurated by the Women&#x27;s Institute of Prince Edward Island. Fiddler Don Messer moved to Charlottetown in 1939 where he joined CFCY as music director. He formed the &quot;Islanders&quot; and by 1944 the group was airing a show nationally on CBC Radio, becoming established as the most popular on Canadian radio from the 1940s to the 1960s and later on television.

The Prince Edward Island Symphony Orchestra is also well-known. Other well-known famous performers from Charlottetown have included Haywire, Teresa Doyle, Tara MacLean, Nancy White, Walter MacNutt, UIGG, William Keith Rogers and ECMA winners The Saddle River Stringband. The Charlottetown Festival is a seasonal musical theatre festival which runs from late May to mid-October every year since 1965. It includes a summer musical theatre training program called the &quot;Young Company&quot;, whose shows are freely available to the public and feature Canadian-themed content.

==Fiddle culture==
The province is known for its old and vibrant fiddling tradition. Fiddle music came to Prince Edward Island in the late 18th century with its early Scottish settlers. Further immigration from the fiddle hotbeds of Ireland and the Scottish Highlands strengthened the tradition, which gradually spread in all communities, including the Evangeline region with a sizeable Acadian population. Although the role of community fiddlers has declined due to advancements in technology, the tradition is still part of cultural life of the province.

<doc id="1275383" wikidata="Q4793971" url="?curid=1275383" title="Armstrong Siddeley Double Mamba">
<text>The Armstrong Siddeley Double Mamba is a turboprop engine design developed in the late 1940s of around . It was used mostly on the Fairey Gannet anti-submarine aircraft developed for the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy.

==Design and development==
The Double Mamba (rarely known as the Twin Mamba) was a development of the Armstrong Siddeley Mamba with two Mambas driving contra-rotating propellers through a combining gearbox.

Engine starting was by cartridge, however, forced air restart was achieved in flight. One engine could be shut down in flight to conserve fuel. Shutting down one engine also stopped one of the propellers.

==Variants==

;ASMD.1: (2 x ASMa.3) used on Fairey Gannet A.S. Mk.1 and Blackburn B-88
;ASMD.3: (2 x ASMa.5) used on Fairey Gannet A.S. Mk.4
;ASMD.4: (2 x ASMa.6) used on Fairey Gannet AEW Mk.3
;ASMD.8: (2 x ASMa.6) used on Fairey Gannet AEW Mk.3

==Applications==
* Blackburn B-88
* Fairey Gannet
* Fairey Gannet AEW
The Double Mamba engine was also proposed for the Westland Westminster, a 30-seat helicopter that was later built as a prototype powered by a pair of Napier Eland E220 turboshaft engines.

==Engines on display==

Preserved Double Mamba engines are on public display at the:

<doc id="1275389" wikidata="Q2601001" url="?curid=1275389" title="Icebreaker (novel)">
<text>Icebreaker, first published in 1983, was the third novel by John Gardner featuring Ian Fleming&#x27;s secret agent, James Bond. Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape (cover design by Bill Botten) and is the first Bond novel to be published in the United States by Putnam, beginning a long-standing association. Part of the book takes place in Northern Europe, including Finland; to make his book as authentic as possible, Gardner even visited Finland.

==Plot summary==
Bond reluctantly finds himself recruited into a dangerous mission involving an equally dangerous and treacherous alliance of agents from the United States (CIA), the Soviet Union (KGB) and Israel (Mossad). The team, dubbed &quot;Icebreaker&quot;, waste no time double-crossing each other. Ostensibly their job is to root out the leader of the murderous National Socialist Action Army (NSAA), Count Konrad von Glöda. The Count, who leads this secret neo-Nazi organisation in northern Finland at its secret headquarters known as the &quot;Ice Palace&quot;, used to be known as Arne Tudeer, a one-time Nazi SS officer who now perceives himself as the new Adolf Hitler. The National Socialist Action Army is essentially a new wave of fascism as a means to wipe out communist leaders and supporters around the world.

The novel is full of double-crosses and even triple-crosses, where the agents and agencies go without sharing their true loyalties with one another. The American agent, for instance, first appears to be a good guy then later is in cahoots with Glöda, and then still even later is a good guy once again. Things become even more complicated when the Israeli agent, Rivke, is revealed to be the daughter of Glöda/Tudeer and her allegiance, although appearing to be legitimate, is doubtful. The Russian agent also double-crosses Bond in the hope of capturing him for KGB interrogation.

Bond gets several weeks of driving training from Erik Carlsson as preparation for this Arctic assignment.

==Characters==
* James Bond
* M
* Paula Vacker: is a frequent love interest of James Bond that he visits while he is in Helsinki. During the course of the novel, her loyalty to him is questioned, initially appearing totally innocent, then in league with von Glöda, and finally discovered to be a deep under cover agent for Supo.
* Brad Tirpitz: is a member of the Icebreaker team and an agent from the CIA. He is later discovered by Bond to be in league with the National Socialist Action Army and to have killed the real agent Tirpitz and taken his place; he claims his name is actually Hans Buchtman and is described as von Glöda&#x27;s Heinrich Himmler. Buchtman, however, turns out to be an alias of Brad Tirpitz, who created this back-story as a way to gain entry into von Glöda&#x27;s organisation; indeed, he actually works for and is loyal to the CIA.
* Kolya Mosolov: is a KGB agent who is a member of the Icebreaker team. He is discovered to have planned the entire Icebreaker team in coordination with von Glöda. The two have a deal in which Mosolov would betray his country and sell arms to von Glöda in exchange for the capture of secret agent 007. Mosolov is not only an agent of the KGB, but also an agent working within &quot;Department V&quot;, a department formerly known as SMERSH; Bond&#x27;s main nemesis throughout the Ian Fleming novels. Mosolov believes that von Glöda will not succeed and is merely going along with the deal for the time being in order to capture Bond for the Soviets.
* Rivke Ingber: is a member of the Icebreaker team and an agent working for the Mossad. She is discovered to actually be Anni Tudeer, the daughter of Count von Glöda (aka Aarne Tudeer). Rivke plays both sides, initially acting like she is disgusted with her father&#x27;s past, but later actually being discovered to be in league with him, thinking of herself as a future Führer.
* Count Konrad von Glöda: is the mastermind behind the National Socialist Action Army and self-declared Führer. His real name is Aarne Tudeer, a low-level SS officer wanted by the Allies for crimes during the Second World War. He attempts to bring back fascism by targeting communist leaders and supporters around the world.

==Publication history==
Gardner reveals that his publisher originally rejected the title &quot;Icebreaker&quot;, only to come back to it after rejecting &quot;turkey after turkey&quot; in terms of alternate titles.

Icebreaker was released in Finland under a title &quot;Tehtävä Suomessa, James Bond&quot; (&quot;Mission in Finland, James Bond&quot;), as part of the book takes place in Finland.
* UK first hardback edition: 7 July 1983 Jonathan Cape
* U.S. first hardback edition: April 1983 Putnam
* UK first paperback edition: 1984 Coronet Books
* U.S. first paperback edition: May 1984 Berkley Books

==Reviews==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Anatole Broyard believed that John Gardner was underqualified to write Bond. &quot;His book strikes me as deficient in many of the basic requirements. Mr. Gardner is all awkwardness. Every time I try to enter into his latest conspiracy we bump heads. It&#x27;s one thing to accept an improbable plot and quite another to accept an improbable style. I&#x27;m willing to suspend my disbelief, but not my affection for the English language. I don&#x27;t see why, when Mr. Gardner can learn all about the various weapons, machines and intelligence procedures he describes, he can&#x27;t do a bit of basic research in ordinary narrative technique. A man who has no talent for describing women, for example, should let them alone.&quot; Broyard cited numerous examples of clichéd writing and dismissed the plot as &quot;a muddle&quot;.

T. J. Binyon, writing in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, believed the book was &quot;full of good action; his torture scenes are splendidly painful; his villain is adequately megalomaniac, though perhaps not sufficiently outre; his girls are pretty, sexy, and available, and the courting routines as embarrassingly obvious as anything in the original. But in the end Gardner&#x27;s Bond doesn&#x27;t really measure up to Fleming&#x27;s. There isn&#x27;t that maniacal snobbery about trivial and useless detail which the original so endearingly manifests. And, further, Gardner simply hasn&#x27;t grasped Bond&#x27;s most important trait: &quot;he&quot; only takes assignments where his creator would like to take a holiday. And who on earth would want to holiday in the &#x27;desolate Arctic wastes of Lapland&#x27;? Certainly not the luxurious Bond.&quot;

&quot;People Magazine&quot;&#x27;s anonymous reviewer said that &quot;the action in &quot;Icebreaker&quot; is fitful at best&quot; and that the book was &quot;not at all up to Gardner&#x27;s (first) 007 outing, License Renewed. The Russian villain, however, is an original and sometimes interesting menace.&quot;

&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; crime critic Derrick Murdoch believed &quot;Icebreaker&quot; was Gardner&#x27;s best Bond novel thus far. &quot;In most technical respects (writing, plotting and minor-character sketching), he is more skilful and more painstaking than Fleming even attempted to be. On the other hand, nobody since the Grimm brothers could equal Fleming&#x27;s gift for improvising such audaciously grotesque adversaries as Dr. No, Blofeld, Auric Goldfinger and his henchman, Oddjob. To make up for the lack of gnomes or behemoths, Gardner offers a plot of labyrinthine complexity, subtler than any of Fleming&#x27;s. In short, he has taken more risks in Icebreaker to display his own talents, and it has paid off.&quot;.

Mel Watkins, writing in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, praised Gardner for adding &quot;a touch of the plot subtlety of less insistently action-oriented thrillers.&quot; He also applauded Gardner&#x27;s updating of Bond. &quot;Although Mr. Gardner&#x27;s Bond is less raffishly macho and arrogant than previously depicted,&quot; observed Watkins, &quot;the spirit of the 007 series remains intact, and few Fleming admirers are likely to object. There is, in fact, something appealing about a James Bond who can react to women with some sympathy and confusion at a crucial moment.&quot;

Long-time Gardner admirer and Listener crime critic Marghanita Laski believed &quot;Icebreaker&quot; &quot;is one of his best yet in his 007 mode.&quot; She especially admired the book&#x27;s Finnish setting which she said &quot;has been good thriller value since Gavin Lyall introduced it.&quot;

<doc id="1275395" wikidata="Q1144416" url="?curid=1275395" title="Propagation delay">
<text>Propagation delay is the time duration taken for a signal to reach its destination, for example in the electromagnetic field, a wire, gas, fluid or solid body.

== Physics ==

* An electromagnetic wave travelling through a medium has a propagation delay determined by the speed of light in that particular medium, or ca. 1 nanosecond per in a vacuum.
* An electric signal travelling through a wire has an propagation delay of ca. 1 nanosecond per .

See also radio propagation, velocity factor, signal velocity and mechanical wave.

== Electronics ==

Logic gates can have a gate delay ranging from picoseconds to more than 10 nanoseconds, depending on the technology being used. It is the time between the gate input becoming stable and the gate output becoming stable. Manufacturers often refer to the time from the input changing to 50% of its final input level, to the output reaching 50% of its final output level; this may depend on the direction of the level change, in which case separate fall and rise delays tPHL and tPLH or tf and tr are given.

Reducing gate delays allows digital circuits to process data at a faster rate and improve overall performance. Determining the propagation delay of a combined circuit requires identifying the longest path of propagation delays from input to output, and adding each propagation delay along this path.

The principle of logical effort utilizes propagation delays to compare designs implementing the same logical statement. The difference in propagation delays of logic elements is the major contributor to glitches in asynchronous circuits as a result of race conditions.

* Propagation delay may increase or decrease with operating temperature depending on the device type. As the temperature increases the gate delay decreases for FinFET transistors due to Inverse Temperature Dependence; for metal wires and other conductive materials the propagation delay increases due to rising electrical resistance.
* Marginal increases in supply voltage can increase propagation delay, since the upper switching threshold voltage VIH (often expressed as a percentage of the high-voltage supply rail) naturally increases proportionately.
* Increases in output load capacitance, often from placing increased fan-out loads on a wire, will also increase propagation delay.

All of these factors influence each other through an RC time constant: any increase in load capacitance increases C, heat-induced resistance the R factor, and supply threshold voltage increases will affect whether more than one time constants are required to reach the threshold. If the output of a logic gate is connected to a long trace or used to drive many other gates (high fanout) the propagation delay increases substantially.

== Networking ==

In computer networks, propagation delay is the amount of time it takes for the head of the signal to travel from the sender to the receiver. It can be computed as the ratio between the link length and the propagation speed over the specific medium.

Propagation delay is equal to &quot;d / s&quot; where &quot;d&quot; is the distance and &quot;s&quot; is the wave propagation speed. In wireless communication, &quot;s&quot;=&quot;c&quot;, i.e. the speed of light. In copper wire, the speed &quot;s&quot; generally ranges from .59c to .77c. This delay is the major obstacle in the development of high-speed computers and is called the interconnect bottleneck in IC systems.

<text>AT&amp;T Computer Systems is the generic name for American Telephone &amp; Telegraph&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to compete in the computer business. In return for divesting the local Bell Operating Companies (Baby Bells), AT&amp;T was allowed to have an unregulated division to sell computer hardware and software. The company made the 3B series computers.

== Background ==
In the early 1980s, the Bell Labs Processor Division had developed several computer ranges, primarily for internal Bell System use: the 3B20D (&quot;D&quot; for Duplex); the commercial simplex version 3B20S, which competed with the DEC VAX; and the 3B5 and 3B15 computers for billing and telecom switching control applications, which used the world&#x27;s first 32-bit microprocessor, the Bellmac 32A.

==Formation post-divestiture==
After divestiture of the Bell System on January 1, 1984, AT&amp;T was required to put its computer business into a fully separated subsidiary called AT&amp;T Information Systems (ATTIS, without the ampersand or hyphen). Software was developed in New Jersey (at Murray Hill, Summit, Holmdel, and Piscataway), and software, hardware, and system solutions were developed in Naperville and Lisle, Illinois. After a couple of years of court hearings, AT&amp;T was allowed to pull the business back into the mainstream corporate organization, and it was renamed AT&amp;T Data Systems Group, which had three divisions: Computer, Terminals (the Teletype Corporation of Skokie, Illinois), and Printers. AT&amp;T Data Systems Group was announced to the public in 1991. In 1992 the Terminals division was sold to Memorex-Telex, and the Printer division, which had only bought OEM equipment from Genicom, was phased out. By the mid-1990s, this left only AT&amp;T Computer Systems.

AT&amp;T Computer Systems (abbreviated AT&amp;T-CS) was the home of the UNIX System V operating system, originally developed in the Bell Labs Research Division. The important System V Interface Definition (SVID) was written, attempting to standardize the various flavors of Unix, and define the official interfaces which made up a Unix operating system. In 1988, AT&amp;T announced its intent to buy up to a 20% stake in Sun Microsystems, a company then best known for making high-end Unix workstations. Upset at their academic-minded supplier (Bell Labs) now turned competitor (AT&amp;T-CS), the &quot;Gang of Seven&quot; Unix system vendors founded the Open Software Foundation (OSF), each contributing source code from their UNIX SVR3 versions. AT&amp;T founded the UNIX International organization as a response to the OSF. But by the late 1980s, AT&amp;T had almost given up, sold most of its stake in Sun, spun the Unix business off as Unix System Laboratories (which was later bought by Novell), canceled its WE 32000 (aka BELLMAC) and CRISP (C Reduced Instruction Set Processor) microprocessor product lines, and just concentrated on networked server computer systems. See also Unix wars.

==3B series computers==
Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, AT&amp;T-CS produced many &quot;firsts&quot; in the computer world, besides the UNIX operating system itself. The 3B5 and 3B15 were the first computers to be designed with the 32-bit WE 32000 microprocessor, and the 3B15 was the first computer to run a demand-paging version of Unix. There was a project, codenamed &quot;Alice&quot;, to develop the 3B5 into an asymmetric multiprocessor with 3 CPUs, but this was canceled in favor of the demand paging 3B15 project, and a few of the &quot;Alice&quot; participants left the company and went to Sequent Computer Systems.

The 3B5, 3B15, 3B20S and 3B20D line, begun in 1982, was aimed at the former AT&amp;T subsidiaries the RBOCs. Around 70,000 units were made before production ceased at the Oklahoma City Works (a former Western Electric factory) in 1993.

Starting with ATTIS in 1984, development of a commercial version of the 3B hardware commenced. The Motorola 68010-based UNIX PC (aka the 3B1) was released in 1985, developed externally by Convergent Technologies. This product was not a success, in part due to the high margin on the machines; AT&amp;T sold the machine for $8,000 although their cost was approximately $4,000.

The next product was the 3B2 product line, which ranged from a 3B2/200 desktop unit, to a 3B2/1000 data center system. These machines were sold with System V Release 2, and later System V Release 3. The 3B2 was the reference platform for SVR3.

==Desktops==
The 3B2 was the first desktop supermicrocomputer (1983) with a 32-bit microprocessor and UNIX. The model 300 and 400 series were uniprocessors. The 3B2 became the official &quot;porting base&quot; for UNIX System V Release 3. Later versions were the first to introduce UNIX asymmetric multiprocessing (3B2/600 Falcon) and nearly symmetrical multiprocessing (3B2/1000 Galactica). The Falcon won the highly touted US Air Force Office Automation contract, initially estimated at $1.7 billion, and the largest single computer contract the Federal government had awarded at that time. It was also the first supermicrocomputer to use a first-level cache memory based on virtual addresses instead of physical addresses, which made it 80% faster than the original requirements called for.

Because the 3B5/3B15 was a large minicomputer with only 1 CPU, it was sometimes referred to as &quot;the body without a brain&quot;. The small 3B2 had a desktop design with (supposedly) less expansion capability, but had capacity available for up to 4 CPUs, it was thus also at times referred to as &quot;the brain without a body&quot;.

The &quot;Companion&quot; was developed, the first &quot;laptop&quot; computer to have a 32-bit CPU and UNIX. The &quot;Alexander&quot; system measured about 14 inches on each side square, and about 5 inches high, featured a unique stacking I/O bus for up to 8 cards, featured compressed Unix filesystems on pluggable ROM cartridges like modern gaming consoles, and used the WE 32100 microprocessor running UNIX SVR3. Both were so outrageous and ahead of their time, they were never marketed.

==Servers==
On the large side, the 3B4000 (1986) was the first &quot;snugly coupled&quot; multiprocessor (the &quot;network in a box&quot;), containing the A-BUS which supported 16 large single-board computer (SBC) circuit panels, and featured the first SVR4 distributed UNIX kernel (codenamed &quot;Apache&quot;, nothing to do with the open source project started in the 1990s). Although the SBCs did not share address space, the UNIX kernel was distributed across all SBCs in a single virtual image. 

The StarServer E (&quot;Enterprise&quot; or SSE) was an Intel-based symmetric multiprocessor (SMP), introduced just after the Sequent system, making the SSE the world&#x27;s second SMP UNIX system, and the first to run System V.4. It featured 4 Intel i486 CPUs. A later design (codenamed &quot;Bigfoot&quot;) was to feature 10 Pentium CPUs, but this was never released because of the NCR deal.

AT&amp;T-CS also introduced the world&#x27;s first &quot;PC&amp;C&quot; (personal computer and communication), the famous AT&amp;T Safari laptop, the first to have a built-in modem and networking. This system used an Intel x86 microprocessor, and ran Microsoft software instead of Unix. AT&amp;T-CS also marketed a line of desktop PCs, first using Olivetti as an OEM, later designing its own product line (codename Cascade) using OEM mainboards from Intel.

Other innovative designs which were never released included the &quot;Starburst&quot;, a distributed Unix kernel message-passing multiprocessor with a fiber-optic switching core, and &quot;Intercept&quot;, a unique High-Availability multiprocessor.

==Partners==
AT&amp;T-CS also bought OEM systems from Tandem Computers and Pyramid Technology. The Tandem Integrity S2 was renamed the StarServer FT and sold only internally to other AT&amp;T divisions. The Pyramid &quot;System 7000&quot; was a large symmetric multiprocessor, containing 12 CPUs, and saw its first large-scale application at the AT&amp;T Universal Cards credit-card billing center, the first enterprise-scale replacement of mainframes by a UNIX server within AT&amp;T. Both these systems used the MIPS R-series RISC microprocessors. After the WE 32000 microprocessors were canceled, the 3B2 follow-on (codenamed &quot;Phoenix&quot;) was also to use a MIPS CPU. The entire MIPS-based product line was to be renamed the System 9000, and to feature &quot;scalavailability&quot; - from normal commercial availability (NCA) choices, to fault-tolerant (FT), to high performance SMP.

The System 9000 strategy was canceled when AT&amp;T&#x27;s board of directors decided to close down AT&amp;T-CS, and buy the NCR Corporation, announced in 1991, and implemented January 1, 1992. NCR management tried to cancel all further development of AT&amp;T-CS systems, though some refused to allow this for a few years, and backlash from AT&amp;T Network Systems (later to be spun off as Lucent Technologies) precipitated a purge of NCR upper management by the AT&amp;T Board. NCR had just developed and suddenly canceled its Motorola 88000-based systems, and then started the NCR 3000 series, developed using Intel x86 microprocessors. The AT&amp;T StarServer E could still beat the comparably equipped NCR 3450 by 11% in the TPC Benchmark B test, and some of the SSE&#x27;s 7 patented innovations were then adapted and retrofitted into the NCR 3000 design.

NCR was renamed AT&amp;T Global Information Solutions (AT&amp;T-GIS) in 1994, and some of the top NCR management was purged. The Naperville, IL operation provided LifeKeeper Fault Resilient System software (a failover high-availability software cluster product), the Distributed lock manager for Oracle Parallel Server, and the Vistium computer-telephony integrated (CTI) on-line hardware-assisted networked meeting product. Only about 400 employees remained in the Naperville location by the beginning of 1995. In the mid-1980s, there had been something like 30,000 employees associated with AT&amp;T-CS, including marketing, customer support, factories, and development.

In 1994 a high powered team from AT&amp;T Naperville transferred to NCR San Diego in the midst of developing a Micro Channel architecture based four channel SCSI adapter based on a custom ASIC. This host bus adapter went on to great success in NCR and served as a connection point for over a billion dollars worth of peripherals attached to NCR minicomputers and database servers. 

On September 20, 1995, Bob Allen, AT&amp;T Chairman of the Board and CEO, announced the &quot;trivestiture&quot; - the 3-way split of AT&amp;T into the new service-oriented AT&amp;T, a newly independent NCR, and the new telecom equipment business which would later be named Lucent Technologies. On December 15, the former AT&amp;T-CS operations were shut down, signaling the end of AT&amp;T&#x27;s involvement in designing computer systems. Three AT&amp;T-CS employees went into the new NCR, 25 stayed with AT&amp;T, and the rest (about 200) went to Lucent. Many former AT&amp;T-CS employees have been employed by Schaumburg, IL-based Motorola.

<doc id="1275419" wikidata="Q7597505" url="?curid=1275419" title="Stamps-Baxter Music Company">
<text>The Stamps-Baxter Music Company was an influential publishing company in the shape note Southern gospel music field. The company issued several paperback publications each year with cheap binding and printed on cheap paper. Thus, the older books are now in delicate condition. These songbooks were used in church singing events, called &quot;conventions,&quot; as well as at other church events, although they did not take the place of regular hymnals. Among the country music and bluegrass &quot;standards&quot; that were first published by Stamps-Baxter are &quot;Rank Strangers to Me&quot;, &quot;Just a Little Talk with Jesus&quot;, &quot;Precious Memories&quot;, &quot;Farther Along&quot;, &quot;If We Never Meet Again&quot;, &quot;Victory in Jesus&quot;, and &quot;I Won&#x27;t Have to Cross Jordan Alone&quot;.

Stamps and Baxter operated a music school which was the primary source of the thousands of gospel songs they published. Another major part of the corporation was its sponsorship of gospel quartets who sang the company&#x27;s music in churches throughout the southern United States. At the end of World War II they were sponsoring 35 such quartets. The company also had a quartet who sang on radio station KRLD in Dallas, beginning in 1936. This station would boost its transmitting power at midnight, so that it could be heard across the nation. An additional part of the Stamps-Baxter music empire was a magazine, &quot;Gospel Music News&quot;. Each part of the corporation supported every other part, giving strength to the entire organization.

== History ==
Virgil Oliver Stamps founded the company in 1924 and J. R. Baxter Jr. joined him to form the Stamps-Baxter Music Company, which was based in Dallas, Texas, with offices in Chattanooga, Tennessee and Pangburn, Arkansas. Stamps got his start working for the James D. Vaughan Publishing Company from which he got many of his business ideas.

In 1945, Frank Stamps, younger brother of V. O. Stamps, left the organization to form the rival Stamps Quartet Music Company. At the same time a number of quartets left Stamps-Baxter resulting in the end of the company&#x27;s quartet sponsorship coinciding with the end of the war. Frank&#x27;s defection did not hurt the Stamps-Baxter company in the long run, although it did lead to some confusion among the public. The Stamps-Baxter School of Music declined after World War II, but its successor continues to this day as an annual two-week singing school under the leadership of Ben Speer.

Stamps died in 1940, leaving the company to J. R. Baxter. After Baxter died in 1960, his widow, Clarice Howard &quot;Ma&quot; Baxter, ran the company until her death in 1972. In 1974, the company was sold to Zondervan, which became part of the Benson Company in 1986, and is now part of Universal Music Group. The choral publishing arm was subsequently sold to the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship-associated Celebrating Grace, Inc. in 2023.

==Songbooks==
The &quot;convention&quot; song books typically included 140 songs. The first song would be on the inside front cover, numbered 00 with the first song inside the book being numbered 1-A, and the rest of the songs were numbered 1 through 138. Each book included four or five older public domain songs such as John Newton&#x27;s &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, Mackay&#x27;s &quot;Revive Us Again&quot;, Stennett&#x27;s &quot;I Am Bound for the Promised Land&quot;, and Smith&#x27;s &quot;America&quot;. In addition, one or two songs from earlier Stamps-Baxter publications might be included. The other 134 songs would consist of new material that had never been published before. The authors and composers of these songs were paid as much as $7.00 for each song, which would be the only monetary compensation that they would get.

=== Copyrights ===
The Stamps-Baxter company was careful to renew its copyrights under United States copyright law. The collections, not the individual songs, were copyrighted, so that anyone looking up records for the songs must know in which collection it was first published. Under current U. S. copyright law, works published between 1922 and 1963 will not enter public domain until 95 years after their initial year of copyright if the copyright was renewed. Thus, a Stamps-Baxter song last copyrighted in 1929 will enter public domain in 2024.
There is also a claim to copyright on these songs. On October 16, 1998, three corporations, Brentwood-Benson Music Publishing, Inc., Stamps-Baxter Music, and Bridge Building Music, Inc., filed for copyright on &quot;Glory Special&quot; &amp; 19,618 other titles. This large collection includes all of the Stamps-Baxter convention songs. Universal Music Publishing International MGB Limited now owns Stamps-Baxter Music and Bridge Building Music. Therefore, the copyright is maintained by Universal Music Publishing International MGB Limited.

<text>Role of Honour, first published in 1984, was the fourth novel by John Gardner featuring Ian Fleming&#x27;s secret agent, James Bond. Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape and in the United States by Putnam.

==Plot summary==
After receiving a large inheritance, James Bond 007 is accused of improprieties and drummed out of the British Secret Service. Disgusted with his former employers, Bond places his services on the open market, where he later attracts the attention of representatives of SPECTRE who are quite willing to put their one-time enemy on their payroll. But the whole thing was a hoax, just a plan to get Bond inside the enemy&#x27;s organization.

Prior to joining up, Bond spends a month in Monte Carlo with Miss &#x27;Percy&#x27; Proud, a CIA agent who teaches him everything she knows about programming languages and computers in general. This background allows Bond to attract Jay Autem Holy, an agent of SPECTRE who left the Pentagon, faked his death, and later started a computer game company that creates simulations based on real-life battles and wars.

Bond&#x27;s allegiance to SPECTRE is periodically questioned throughout the novel, even at one point going so far as to send Bond to a terrorist training camp (known as &quot;Erewhon&quot;) to see if he has &#x27;the right stuff&#x27;. Proving his worth, Bond becomes involved in a plot to destabilise the Soviet Union and the United States, by forcing them to rid the world of their nuclear weapons.

What SPECTRE leaders Tamil Rahani and Dr. Jay Autem Holy suspect, but never fully realise is that Bond&#x27;s resignation is false. Along with Bond, the Secret Service plays a vital role in foiling SPECTRE; however, Rahani, the current leader of SPECTRE is able to escape Bond&#x27;s clutches by parachuting out of an airship over Switzerland.

==Characters==
* James Bond
* M
* Bill Tanner
* Q
* Persephone &#x27;Percy&#x27; Proud: Formerly Mrs. Jay Autem Holy. Percy is a CIA agent who went deep undercover by marrying Holy. After Holy&#x27;s faked death, she teams with Bond to teach him everything she knows about Holy and everything she knows about programming languages and computers in general.
* Jay Autem Holy: supposedly died in a plane crash, prior to the events in &quot;Role of Honour&quot;. He now goes under the name Jason St. John Finnes and is secretly an agent of SPECTRE. Holy is an elite computer programmer once working for The Pentagon; he now owns and manages a software company that develops computer game simulations based on real-life wars and battles. He is the former husband of Percy Proud and current husband to Dazzle. Holy is killed by Rahani after finding out he was betrayed.
* General Rolling Joe Zwingli: is an accomplice Jay Autem Holy and long-time friend. He also was supposedly killed in the plane crash. Zwingli is killed by one of Rahani&#x27;s personnel after finding out he was double-crossed.
* Tamil Rahani:Part American, part Lebanese, he is the chairman and principal shareholder of Rahani Electronics and secretly the head of SPECTRE. He manages the Erewhon terrorist training camp along with his right-hand man, Simon. Unlike most of the villains in a James Bond novel or film, Rahani actually lives and flees from capture. Bond is later informed that Rahani was secretly having a love affair with Dazzle, Holy&#x27;s second wife.
* Freddie Fortune: is an informant for Bond that he uses to get closer to Holy.
* Cindy Chalmer: is a programmer who works for Holy at Endor. She is in league with Percy and an informant for her and the CIA.
* Peter Amadeus: is a programmer who works for Holy at Endor. He later escapes with the help of Bond and is used by the British Secret Service to one-up SPECTRE. He later takes a job within the Secret Service as a computer programmer.

==Cars==
Bond purchases a brand new British racing green Bentley Mulsanne Turbo with magnolia interior. Likewise with the Silver Beast, Bond had CCS outfit the car with a long-range telephone and a hidden weapon compartment. Bentley had apparently requested that Gardner not outfit the car with any gadgets other than the telephone.

==Reviews==
&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; dismissed the book as &quot;a ragged quickie that&#x27;s cartoon caper/sleuth action most of the way through (like an old episode of TV&#x27;s &quot;The Avengers&quot;). Virtually no humor, virtually no suspense, and virtually no charm or sexiness in old 007 - making this by far the weakest of Gardner&#x27;s somewhat pre-sold fabrications, with some extra appeal only for computer fans.&quot;

&quot;The West Coast Review of Books&quot; said that &quot;John Gardner does a good job of work in picking up the torch from the late Ian Fleming, but the freshness of the early Bond books is missing; also, 007&#x27;s predictable heroics have begun to bore. One can accept a charmed - and charming - character just so long.&quot;

&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; crime critic Derrick Murdoch wrote that although Gardner &quot;could outperform Fleming easily in most technical respects he lacked Fleming&#x27;s gift for simple-minded razzle-dazzle extravaganzas and Penthouse-style dream girls.&quot; He called &quot;Role of Honour&quot; &quot;something of a disappointment, although some of Bond&#x27;s old admirers may welcome it.&quot; He complained that the novel was both familiar and confusing.

Long-time Gardner admirer and Listener crime critic Marghanita Laski said &quot;John Gardner has gradually worked himself into his own role as owner-creator of James Bond, but his Bond is more intelligent, more sensitive than the original.&quot;

Novelist Jessica Mann, writing for &quot;British Book News&quot;, said &quot;Role of Honour&quot; &quot;hits the spot and will give great pleasure to fans both on the page, and, presumably, on the screen.&quot;

<text>Patterns (sometimes referred to as Patterns of Power) is a 1956 American &quot;boardroom drama&quot; film directed by Fielder Cook, and starring Van Heflin, Everett Sloane, Ed Begley, Beatrice Straight, and Elizabeth Wilson. The screenplay was adapted by Rod Serling from his 1955 teleplay of the same name, which was originally broadcast January 12, 1955, on the &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot; with several of the same actors (including Sloane, Begley, and Wilson), though Richard Kiley was replaced by Heflin for the film.

==Plot==
Ruthless Walter Ramsey runs Ramsey &amp; Company, a Manhattan-based industrial empire that he inherited from his father. He brings Fred Staples, a youthful industrial engineer whose performance at an Ohio factory that Ramsey recently acquired has impressed him, in for a top executive job at the headquarters. Though Staples is initially unaware, Ramsey is grooming him to replace the aging Bill Briggs as the second-in-command at the company.

Briggs has been with the firm for forty years, having worked for and admired the company&#x27;s founder, Ramsey&#x27;s father. He cares greatly about his work, regularly prioritizing it above spending time with his teenage son, but his concern for people clashes repeatedly with Ramsey&#x27;s heartless &quot;modern&quot; approach to business. Not wanting to fire Briggs outright, Ramsey, instead, does everything in his power to sabotage and humiliate Briggs into resigning. The old man stubbornly refuses to give in, but the stress gets to him, and he starts to drink, which does not help his already-deteriorating health. Staples is torn by the messy situation, his sympathy for Briggs in conflict with his ambition, which is supported by his wife.

At a board meeting, while discussing a report Briggs and Staples wrote together, Ramsey praises Staples for making Briggs&#x27; old, well-intentioned, but unworkable, ideas practical, and there is a heated exchange. Shortly after leaving the room, Briggs collapses, and he soon dies in the hospital.

Fed up, Staples goes to tell Ramsey off and announce he is quitting. Ramsey rebukes him, asserting that a corporation like Ramsey &amp; Company needs men with their talent in order to succeed. He offers Briggs&#x27; job to Staples at double his present salary, double his stock options, and an unlimited expense account, but Staples resists. Undeterred, Ramsey increases the fever of his pitch, adding that Staples will never be able to reach his full potential anywhere else. When Staples counters that he hates Ramsey and would not be Ramsey&#x27;s whipping boy, but would constantly argue and fight and try to take the presidency for himself, Ramsey, seemingly energized by someone who can work at his level and challenge him, says he is willing to continue under these conditions. Staples leaves and tells his wife that he is staying on, as that way there is at least a chance he can influence things for the better.

===Critical response===
In a 2002 review on &quot;Ozus&#x27; World Movie Reviews&quot;, film critic Dennis Schwartz gave the film an &quot;A&quot; grade and highly praised it, writing:
:&quot;&quot;Patterns&quot; is based on the teleplay of Rod Serling which was aired live on TV in January of 1955 on Kraft Television Theatre, and was so-well received that it was repeated four weeks later. That was something not done during that period. This brilliant script by the creator of the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;, Rod Serling, is considered by many as the finest piece of writing he has ever done and brought him instant acclaim. It is ably directed by Fielder Cook [...] The ensemble cast is superb, with special kudos to Van Heflin, Ed Begley, Beatrice Straight and Everett Sloane. This is Van Heflin&#x27;s finest role since &quot;Shane&quot; (1953).&quot;

Added Schwartz: 
:&quot;It&#x27;s a forceful melodrama, that takes the viewer into the pits of a big corporation&#x27;s board room politics, backstabbing, and the tough way of doing business. Things have changed since the 1950s which make some things outdated, but the film still has its finger on the savage nature of the business world. Even when a company is not as corrupt as an Enron, people are still perceived as secondary to making a profit no matter what.&quot;

In the April 27, 2008, edition of &quot;TVWeek&quot;, the television critic Tom Shales compared the movie unfavorably to the live TV production:
:Some people thought live TV was the beginning of a truly new storytelling medium—one uniquely suited to intimate, unadorned, psychological dramas—but it turned out to be a beginning with a tiny middle and a rushed end. [...] &quot;Patterns&quot; was so well-received that Kraft mounted a live repeat of the show a month later, and the intimate TV show was turned into a less intimate (and somehow less satisfying) movie in 1956. Except for the use of terms like “mimeographed” and “teletype,” little about the drama seems dated, unless one is of the opinion that corporate politics and boardroom bloodletting no longer exist. [...] With minimally judicious scene-setting (shots of clocks, a building directory, a switchboard) and a rapid introduction of characters, Serling pulls a viewer almost immediately into his story, a tale of corporate morality—or the lack of it—and such everyday battles as the ones waged between conscience and ambition.

<doc id="1275440" wikidata="Q4793982" url="?curid=1275440" title="Armstrong Siddeley Mamba">
<text>The Armstrong Siddeley Mamba was a British turboprop engine produced by Armstrong Siddeley in the late 1940s and 1950s, producing around 1,500 effective horsepower (1,100 kW).

Armstrong Siddeley gas turbine engines were named after snakes.

==Design and development==
The Mamba was a compact engine with a 10-stage axial compressor, six combustion chambers and a two-stage power turbine. The epicyclic reduction gearbox was incorporated in the propeller spinner. Engine starting was by cartridge. The Ministry of Supply designation was ASMa (Armstrong Siddeley Mamba). The ASMa.3 gave 1,475 ehp and the ASMa.6 was rated at 1,770 ehp. A 500-hour test was undertaken in 1948 and the Mamba was the first turboprop engine to power the Douglas DC-3, when in 1949, a Dakota testbed was converted to take two Mambas.

The Mamba was also developed into the form of the Double Mamba, which was used to power the Fairey Gannet anti-submarine aircraft for the Royal Navy. This was essentially two Mambas lying side-by-side and driving contra-rotating propellers separately through a common gearbox.

A turbojet version of the Mamba was developed as the Armstrong Siddeley Adder, by removing the reduction gearbox.

==Variants and applications==
;ASMa.3 Mamba:
:Armstrong Whitworth Apollo
:Avro Athena
:Boulton Paul Balliol
:Breguet Vultur
:Miles M.69 Marathon II
:Douglas C-47 Dakota
:Short SB.3
;ASMa.5 Mamba:Development engine for Armstrong Siddeley ASMD.3 Double Mamba
;ASMa.6 Mamba:

;ASMa.7 Mamba:A version for civil applications
;Swiss-Mamba SM-1 (aft turbofan variant)
:EFW N-20
;Mamba 112: (ASMa.6)

==Engines on display==
Surviving Mambas are on display in the UK at the Midland Air Museum, Coventry Airport, Warwickshire and the East Midlands Aeropark. 
Another example is to be found at the Hertha Ayrton STEM Centre at Sheffield Hallam University, UK and a Mamba Mk 110 (serial number 654606 - ZP3043, believed originally flown in a Short Seamew) is on loan from the Rolls-Royce Heritage Trust to BAE Systems at Farnborough Airport, Hampshire. 

Overseas, a Swiss-Mamba SM-1 is displayed at the Flieger-Flab-Museum Dübendorf in Switzerland and another Mamba can be seen at the Aviation Heritage Museum (Western Australia).

<text>The Farmer&#x27;s Joint Stock Bank was a bank that operated in Upper Canada, and later in the Province of Canada, from 1834 to 1854.

==History==
Following the 1821 legalization of small notes and bills of exchange in Upper Canada, the Bank was formed in 1834 as a private bank by George Truscott and John Cleveland Green in Toronto, Upper Canada. Francis Hincks, a journalist and colonial administrator, was invited to become its first cashier. In 1835, it was taken over by a group of Reformers and constituted as a joint-stock company called the Farmers&#x27; Joint Stock Banking Company by deed of settlement. The first board of directors appointed John Elmsley, a member of the Family Compact, to be its first president, which forced Hincks and other Reform investors to leave and found the Bank of the People in December 1835. When Upper Canada moved in 1837 to restrict the ability of institutions other than incorporated banks to issue their own banknotes, the Bank was exempted.

A financial crisis that affected Upper Canada in 1837 resulted in a suspension of the Bank&#x27;s activities for two months at the end of that year. In 1838, it was barred from issuing banknotes that were not payable on demand.

Economic conditions, together with poor management and political intrigue, led to a move by the board to wind up the Bank in January 1844, which was not completed until December 1848 with its sale to new owners. William Brown Phipps, who had been Manager since 1841, returned to become Manager of the revived Bank in March 1849. In June 1849, it flooded Toronto and Buffalo with new issues of its banknotes, which were subsequently boycotted by merchants. It was finally closed in 1854.

<text>Lanternfish (or myctophids, from the Greek μυκτήρ &quot;myktḗr&quot;, &quot;nose&quot; and &quot;ophis&quot;, &quot;serpent&quot;) are small mesopelagic fish of the large family Myctophidae. One of two families in the order Myctophiformes, the Myctophidae are represented by 246 species in 33 genera, and are found in oceans worldwide. Lanternfishes are aptly named after their conspicuous use of bioluminescence. Their sister family, the Neoscopelidae, are much fewer in number but superficially very similar; at least one neoscopelid shares the common name &quot;lanternfish&quot;: the large-scaled lantern fish, &quot;Neoscopelus macrolepidotus&quot;.

Lanternfish are among the most widely distributed, diverse and populous vertebrates, with some estimates suggesting that they may have a total global biomass of 1.8 to 16 gigatonnes, accounting for up to 65% of all deep-sea fish biomass. Commercial fisheries for them exist off South Africa, in the sub-Antarctic, and in the Gulf of Oman.

== Description ==
Lanternfish typically have a slender, compressed body covered in small, silvery deciduous cycloid scales (ctenoid in four species), a large bluntly rounded head, large elliptical to round lateral eyes (dorsolateral in &quot;Protomyctophum&quot; species), and a large terminal mouth with jaws closely set with rows of small teeth. The fins are generally small, with a single high dorsal fin, a forked caudal fin, and an adipose fin. The anal fin is supported by a cartilaginous plate at its base, and originates under, or slightly behind, the rear part of the dorsal fin. The pectoral fins, usually with eight rays, may be large and well-developed to small and degenerate, or completely absent in a few species. In some species, such as those of the genus &quot;Lampanyctus&quot;, the pectorals are greatly elongated. Most lanternfish have a gas bladder, but it degenerates or fills with lipids during the maturation of a few species. The lateral line is uninterrupted.

In all but one species, &quot;Taaningichthys paurolychnus&quot;, a number of photophores (light-producing organs) are present; these are paired and concentrated in ventrolateral rows on the body and head. Some may also possess specialised photophores on the caudal peduncle, in proximity to the eyes (e.g., the &quot;headlights&quot; of &quot;Diaphus&quot; species), and luminous patches at the base of the fins. The photophores emit a weak blue, green, or yellow light, and are known to be arranged in species-specific patterns. In some species, the pattern varies between males and females. This is true for the luminous caudal patches, with the males&#x27; being typically above the tail and the females&#x27; being below the tail.

Lanternfish are generally small fish, ranging from about in length, with most being under . Shallow-living species are an iridescent blue to green or silver, while deeper-living species are dark brown to black.

==Ecology==

Lanternfish are well known for their diel vertical migrations: during daylight hours, most species remain within the gloomy bathypelagic zone, between deep, but towards sundown, the fish begin to rise into the epipelagic zone, between deep. The lanternfish are thought to do this to avoid predation, and because they are following the diel vertical migrations of zooplankton, upon which they feed. After a night spent feeding in the surface layers of the water column, the lanternfish begin to descend back into the lightless depths and are gone by daybreak. By releasing fecal pellets at depth, Laternfish make the carbon capture process called biological pump more efficient. 

Most species remain near the coast, schooling over the continental slope. Different species are known to segregate themselves by depth, forming dense, discrete conspecific layers, probably to avoid competition between different species. Due to their gas bladders, these layers are visible on sonar scans and give the impression of a &quot;false ocean bottom&quot;; this is the so-called deep scattering layer that so perplexed early oceanographers (see below).

Great variability in migration patterns occurs within the family. Some deeper-living species may not migrate at all, while others may do so only sporadically. Migration patterns may also depend on life stage, sex, latitude, and season.

The arrangements of lanternfish photophores are different for each species, so their bioluminescence is thought to play a role in communication, specifically in shoaling and courtship behaviour. The concentration of the photophores on the flanks of the fish also indicate the light&#x27;s use as camouflage; in a strategy termed counterillumination, the lanternfish regulate the brightness of the bluish light emitted by their photophores to match the ambient light level above, effectively masking the lanternfishes&#x27; silhouette when viewed from below.

A major source of food for many marine animals, lanternfish are an important link in the food chain of many local ecosystems, being heavily preyed upon by whales and dolphins, large pelagic fish such as salmon, tuna and sharks, grenadiers and other deep-sea fish (including other lanternfish), pinnipeds, sea birds, notably penguins, and large squid such as the jumbo squid, &quot;Dosidicus gigas&quot;. 

Lanternfish themselves have been found to feed on bits of plastic debris accumulating in the oceans. At least one lanternfish was found with over 80 pieces of plastic chips in its gut, according to scientists monitoring ocean plastic in the Pacific Ocean&#x27;s eastern garbage patch.

==Deep scattering layer==
Sonar operators, using the newly developed sonar technology during World War II, were puzzled by what appeared to be a false sea floor 300–500 metres deep at day, and less deep at night. This turned out to be due to millions of marine organisms, most particularly small mesopelagic fish, with swimbladders that reflected the sonar. These organisms migrate up into shallower water at dusk to feed on plankton. The layer is deeper when the moon is out, and can become shallower when clouds pass over the moon.

Sampling via deep trawling indicates that lanternfish account for as much as 65% of all deep sea fish biomass. Indeed, lanternfish are among the most widely distributed, populous, and diverse of all vertebrates, playing an important ecological role as prey for larger organisms. The estimated global biomass of lanternfish is 550–660 million tonnes, several times the entire world fisheries catch. Lanternfish also account for much of the biomass responsible for the deep scattering layer of the world&#x27;s oceans. Sonar reflects off the millions of lanternfish swim bladders, giving the appearance of a false bottom.

==Rise to dominance==
Lanternfish currently represent one of the dominant groups of mesopelagic fishes in terms of abundance, biomass, and diversity. Their otolith record dominates pelagic sediments below 200 m in dredges, especially during the entire Neogene. The diversity and rise to dominance of lanternfish can be examined by analysing these otolith records. The earliest unambiguous fossil lanternfish are known based on otoliths from the late Paleocene and early Eocene. During their early evolutionary history, lanternfish were likely not adapted to a high oceanic lifestyle but occurred over shelf and upper-slope regions, where they were locally abundant during the middle Eocene.

A distinct upscaling in otolith size is observed in the early Oligocene, which also marks their earliest occurrence in bathyal sediments. This transition is interpreted to be related to the change from a halothermal deep-ocean circulation to a thermohaline regime and the associated cooling of the deep ocean and rearrangement of nutrient and silica supply. The size of early Oligocene lanternfish is remarkably congruent with diatom abundance, the main food resource for the zooplankton and thus for lanternfish and whales. The warmer late Oligocene to early middle Miocene period was characterised by an increase in the disparity of lanternfish but with a reduction in their otolith sizes. A second and persisting secular pulse in lanternfish diversity (particularly within the genus &quot;Diaphus&quot;) and increase in size begins with the &quot;biogenic bloom&quot; during the late Miocene, paralleled with diatom abundance and gigantism in baleen whales.

<text>Ivan Alexander Galamian (; April 14, 1981) was an Armenian-American violin teacher of the twentieth century who was the violin teacher of many seminal violin players including Itzhak Perlman and Kyung Wha Chung.

== Biography ==
Galamian was born in Tabriz, Iran to an Armenian family. Soon after his birth, the family immigrated to Moscow, Russia. He studied with Konstantin Mostras (a student of Leopold Auer) at the School of the Philharmonic Society from 1916 to 1922. He was jailed at age fifteen by the Bolshevik government. The opera manager at the Bolshoi Theatre rescued Galamian; the manager argued that Galamian was a necessary part of the opera orchestra, and subsequently the government released him. Soon thereafter he moved to Paris and studied under Lucien Capet in 1922 and 1923. In 1924 he debuted in Paris. Due to a combination of nerves, health, and a fondness for teaching, Galamian eventually gave up the stage in order to teach full-time. He became a faculty member at the Conservatoire Rachmaninoff where he taught from 1925 to 1929. His earliest pupils in Paris include Vida Reynolds, the first woman in Philadelphia Orchestra&#x27;s first-violin section, and Paul Makanowitzky.

In 1937 Galamian moved permanently to the United States. In 1941 he married Judith Johnson in New York City. He taught violin at the Curtis Institute of Music beginning in 1944, and became the head of the violin department at the Juilliard School in 1946. He wrote two violin method books, &quot;Principles of Violin Playing and Teaching&quot; (1962) and &quot;Contemporary Violin Technique&quot; (1962). Galamian incorporated aspects of both the Russian and French schools of violin technique in his approach. In 1944 he founded the Meadowmount School of Music, a summer program in Westport, New York. The school has remained operational and has trained thousands of world-class musicians. Galamian taught concurrently at Curtis, Juilliard, and Meadowmount schools. He did not retire and maintained an active full-time work schedule. He died at the age of 78 in 1981 in New York City. His wife subsequently took on an active role in managing the Meadowmount School.

Galamian&#x27;s most notable teaching assistants — later distinguished teachers in their own right — were Margaret Pardee, Dorothy DeLay, Sally Thomas, Pauline Scott, Robert Lipsett, Lewis Kaplan, David Cerone, and Elaine Richey.

Galamian held honorary degrees from the Curtis Institute of Music, Oberlin College, and the Cleveland Institute of Music. He was an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Music, London.

<text>The Bank of the People was created by radical Reform politicians James Lesslie, James Hervey Price, and Dr John Rolph in Toronto in 1835. It was founded after they failed to establish a &quot;Provincial Loan Office&quot; in which farmers could borrow small sums guaranteed by their land holdings. The Bank of the People was the only bank in Upper Canada not to suspend payments during the financial panic of 1837-8. Many of the shareholders, however, took part in the Rebellion of 1837 and the Family Compact plotted to have it taken over by the Bank of Montreal in 1840.

== Bank Wars 1835-1838 ==

=== Chartered vs Joint Stock Banks ===

Until 1835, every bank in Upper Canada required a legislated charter which established it as a legal person able to sue, and be sued at law. Only two Banks had been chartered: the Bank of Upper Canada and the Commercial Bank of the Midland District. Both banks were controlled by the &quot;Family Compact&quot; who used their control of the currency supply and credit to control trade and ultimately, the farmers. They had a &quot;licensed monopoly&quot; to print paper money, which reduced competition.

In 1835, Dr Charles Duncombe, a Reform politician in the Legislative Assembly, was part of a &quot;Select Committee on Currency&quot; that offered a template for the creation of joint stock banks based on several successful Scottish banks. The Scottish bank system had always differed from the English system. The difference between the English chartered banks and the Scottish joint stock banks lay almost entirely on the issue of stockholder liability and its implications for the issuance of bank notes. The joint stock banks lacked limited liability, hence every partner in the bank was responsible for the bank&#x27;s debts to the full extent of their personal property. The chartered banks, in contrast, protected their shareholders with limited liability and hence from major loss; they thus encouraged speculation. The chartered banks would loan out many more banknotes (little more than bank issued I.O.U.s) than they had specie (legal tender) to exchange for those notes once redeemed. The more banknotes they loaned out the more interest they made, but at the increased risk of bankruptcy. Protected by limited liability, their shareholders put profit above risk.

The Scottish joint-stock banks, in contrast, followed a &quot;hard money policy&quot;, whereby they would issue a banknote only if they had enough specie to cover it. They avoided speculative risk because if they failed, their shareholders were responsible for the full loss. Since the banks did not require a legislated charter, many more banks could be founded, and they were more competitive, thereby endangering the solvency of the speculative chartered banks.

=== The Bank of the People ===
Dr. Duncombe&#x27;s report opened the legal door for new banks to be founded. The Reformers&#x27; abandoned their attempt to establish a &quot;Provincial Loan Fund&quot; for farmers in the Legislative Assembly, and instead turned their efforts to creating a new joint-stock bank. The first bank to be proposed was the Farmer&#x27;s Bank. However, in a bitter shareholder proxy battle, control of the bank was won by the Hon. John Elmsley Jr., a member of the Family Compact. He was one of the largest shareholders in the Bank of Upper Canada.

William Lyon Mackenzie argued that the Bank of Upper Canada &quot;served the double purpose of keeping the merchants in chains of debt and bonds to the bank manager, and the Farmer&#x27;s acres under the harrow of the storekeeper. You will be shewn how to break this degraded yoke of mortgages, ejectments, judgments and bonds. Money bound you - money shall loose you&quot; (&quot;Correspondent &amp; Advocate&quot; 30-7-1835).

Inspired, the Reformers, led by James Lesslie, a prominent Toronto businessman and Reform city alderman, then founded the Bank of the People on Nov. 4, 1835, seeking to limit shareholders to known Reformers. Dr John Rolph was elected president, and James Lesslie the cashier (manager). Among its stockholders were David Willson and the Children of Peace who operated the first credit union in Canada in their village of Hope. Sir Francis Hincks, head cashier at the Farmer&#x27;s Bank, later became cashier at the Bank of the People and Lesslie became president.

One loan from the bank stood out: they gave William Lyon Mackenzie £200 to found the Constitution newspaper on July 4, 1836 to organize the democratic reformers of Upper Canada.

The new bank was soon to prove its distinctiveness. Despite offering 5% interest on deposits, it was able to deliver a 6% dividend in 1837, in spite of paying off £1,200 in start-up costs. It managed to do this despite the general economic downturn, and without resorting to widespread litigation. The Bank was located in a house on New (Jarvis) Street owned by James Beaty, a reform city councillor.

During the financial panic of 1837-8, the Tory dominated Legislative Assembly banned all further joint-stock banks, even though it was the speculative chartered Bank of Upper Canada that was insolvent and required a government bailout. The Bank of the People survived the panic unscathed and without recourse to government protection.

The bank was purchased by the Bank of Montreal in 1840. Like the other Canadian chartered banks, it issued its own paper money. The Bank of Canada was established through the Bank of Canada Act of 1934 and the banks relinquished their right to issue their own currency.

=== Related Banks ===
The name selected by the reformers, the Bank of the People, reflects their emerging strong ties and shared strategies with reformers in Lower Canada, who were founding a similarly named bank in Montreal at the same time, in an effort to break the Bank of Montreal&#x27;s monopoly there. La Banque du Peuple was formed under the title of Viger, Dewitt &amp; Company, organized as a société en commandite, the French form of joint stock company. The Montreal bank&#x27;s founders were Louis-Michel Viger, a Montreal lawyer and popular Patriote politician, and Jacob DeWitt, a wealthy American-born hardware merchant, ship owner and reform politician. They drew their clientele from among the French farmers and artisans.

<text>Susan Werner (born 1965) is an American singer-songwriter. Much of Werner&#x27;s work has been in the contemporary folk genre.

==Career==
Werner was raised on her family&#x27;s farm near Manchester, Iowa, about an hour west of Dubuque. She became interested in music at a young age and went on to receive a bachelor&#x27;s degree in voice at the University of Iowa. In 1987, she moved to Philadelphia, and earned a master&#x27;s degree in voice at Temple University. Werner initially wanted a career in opera, but after seeing a Nanci Griffith performance became inspired and began composing songs of her own on acoustic guitar.

Performing around Philadelphia, Boston, and New York City, Susan began making a name for herself in the folk scene of the early 1990s. She recorded five albums from 1993 to 2001, and in 2001 she moved to Chicago. Her first five albums were all in the folk genre, but Werner&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Be New&quot; (2004), was a substantial departure, with original material in the vein of Tin Pan Alley, cabaret, and early jazz torch songs.

Werner&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;The Gospel Truth&quot;, was released in March 2007 and addresses themes of religion, faith, social responsibility, as well as religion from an agnostic&#x27;s point of view. In 2010, Tom Jones recorded &quot;Did Trouble Me&quot;, from Werner&#x27;s &quot;The Gospel Truth&quot;, for his album &quot;Praise &amp; Blame&quot;.

Her eighth album, &quot;Live at Club Passim&quot; is collection of original songs (gospel, jazz &amp; folk) recorded with her band: Colleen Sexton, Trina Hamlin &amp; bassist Greg Holt. For her ninth album, &quot;Classics&quot;, she performs pop music from the 1960s and 1970s accompanied by chamber instruments.

Her tenth album, entitled &quot;Kicking the Beehive&quot;, was released in March 2011. Produced by Rodney Crowell, it features guest appearances from Vince Gill, Keb&#x27; Mo and Paul Franklin. Her album &quot;Hayseed&quot;, a concept album about &quot;farms, farmers, and the people who love them&quot;, was released in the summer of 2013.

Werner branched out to write the music and lyrics for a musical based on the film &quot;Bull Durham&quot;, which premiered at Atlanta&#x27;s Alliance Theatre on September 3, 2014.

In 2017 Werner released &quot;An American In Havana&quot;, an EP featuring six songs written during two trips to Cuba in 2015 and 2016.

==Personal life==
Werner was born into a musical family. Her mother was a singer, although her father&#x27;s musical ability was limited to &quot;whistling on pitch&quot;. All five of her siblings are musically talented. One brother is a professional stand-up comedian and another brother is a performing drag queen.

<doc id="1275458" wikidata="Q2332966" url="?curid=1275458" title="Nobody Lives for Ever">
<text>Nobody Lives for Ever (published in American editions as Nobody Lives Forever), first published in 1986, was the fifth novel by John Gardner featuring Ian Fleming&#x27;s secret agent, James Bond. Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape and in the United States by Putnam.

==Plot summary==
En route to retrieve his faithful housekeeper, May, from a European health clinic where she is recovering from an illness, Bond is warned by the British Secret Service that Tamil Rahani, the current leader of SPECTRE, now dying from wounds suffered due to his last encounter with Bond (as described in &quot;Role of Honour&quot;), has put a price on Bond&#x27;s head. &quot;Trust no one,&quot; Bond is warned. Soon after, May and Miss Moneypenny, who had been visiting his housekeeper are reported missing, and Bond finds himself dodging would-be assassins while searching for his friends, assisted by a young débutante and her capable, yet mysterious, female bodyguard.

The price on Bond&#x27;s head is a competition orchestrated by Rahani and SPECTRE known as &#x27;The Head Hunt&#x27;, and is an open contest to anyone willing to capture, kill, or present Bond to Rahani, where he would be subsequently decapitated by guillotine. Along Bond&#x27;s journey of attempting to rescue Moneypenny and May, Bond is betrayed and chased by a number of people and organisations, including his own British Secret Service ally, Steve Quinn who has defected to the KGB, corrupted police officers, and agents of SPECTRE in disguise.

==Characters==
* James Bond
* M
* Miss Moneypenny
* May
* Principessa Sukie Tempesta is an Italian Princess whom Bond saves while driving to check up on his Scottish housekeeper, May. He later sees her again and offers to drive her home to Rome; however, these plans are cut short after Bond learns of the price on his head. She stays with Bond acting as a hostage and later refusing to leave his side in his moment of need. She is accompanied after her second meeting with Bond by her friend and bodyguard, Nannie.
* Nannette &#x27;Nannie&#x27; Norrich is the head of an all-female bodyguard organisation, NUB (aka Ularon), tasked to protect Sukie. The two are good friends; however, Sukie is unaware that Nannie has entered the competition as a freelancer and has promised Rahani to deliver Bond to him.
* Herr Doktor Kirchtum is the doctor who was overseeing May while she was at the clinic. After Moneypenny and May were kidnapped, Kirchtum was taken captive by Steve Quinn and forced to send instructions to Bond. Bond later frees Kirchtum only to learn later that Kirchtum was actually in league with Quinn. Kirchtum is subsequently killed by either Nannie or Sukie (the identity is never given) upon attempting to rescue 007 from Kirchtum and Quinn&#x27;s clutches.
* Steve Quinn is the British Secret Service&#x27;s man in Rome. He is sent by M to assist Bond in fleeing mainland Europe so that Bond can return to London. Unbeknownst to everyone, Quinn has defected to the KGB and currently works for SMERSH (now known as Department Eight). Quinn is assisted in capturing Bond by Doktor Kirchtum, and, like the latter, is killed by either Nannie or Sukie (the identity is never given).
* Tamil Rahani is the leader of SPECTRE, previously in &quot;Role of Honour&quot;. After parachuting from an airship at the end of &quot;Role of Honour&quot; to escape capture by Bond, he landed badly and injured his spine, which led to terminal cancer. Throughout the book, Rahani is said to have only a short time left to live. Knowing the end is near, Rahani initiates the &#x27;Head Hunt&#x27; to capture Bond. Rahani is killed by Bond after having his bed rigged to detonate upon pushing the adjustment control button.

==Reception==

Critics were generally more enthusiastic about this Gardner Bond novel than his previous entries.

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; praised the book noting that on the basis of this entry Bond is likely to live forever. &quot;In true comic-book fashion, the gory chapters detail the horrors that kill almost everyone except Bond who obviously won&#x27;t die until he wants to.&quot;

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called this the &quot;most deft&quot; of Gardner&#x27;s Bond novels thus far, though felt that it did not measure up to Gardner&#x27;s own 1985 straight spy novel &quot;The Secret Generations&quot;. The anonymous reviewer praised the &quot;fairly inspired&quot; plot gimmick involving hunt for Bond&#x27;s own head. &quot;Gardner weaves swift, outrageous coincidences into a preposterous plot that is quite fun to follow as it hops from the Tyrolean Alps to Salzburg to Key West. All in all, Gardner avoids some of the giganticism of the Bond flicks but certain climactic cliches – granted Bond&#x27;s megalomaniacal villains – by now seem unavoidable, Even so, one dismisses the cliches for the amusement.&quot;

Frank Stilley, in a review for the Associated Press syndicated throughout the United States, said Gardner &quot;lacks nothing&quot; of Ian Fleming&#x27;s gift for &quot;conveying agaonizing suspense&quot; and that &quot;the yarn is a cinch&quot; to please &quot;James Bond&#x27;s countless fans&quot;.

Don O&#x27;Briant, books editor for &quot;The Atlanta Journal&quot; and &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot;, said the book was an &quot;exciting adventure&quot; and noted it in his roundup of the year&#x27;s best books.

Future Bond author Raymond Benson said &quot;This is far and away John Gardner&#x27;s best James Bond novel, and it is precisely because it is such a personal plot for the leading character. It&#x27;s a plot reminiscent of &quot;From Russia, With Love&quot;, and it moves along excitingly! The chase idea was splendid indeed, and the reader is chased along with Bond throughout the book.&quot; Benson praised the story&#x27;s &quot;many surprising turns&quot; and believed that if it were a film it would &quot;have much of the same tension that something like Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;North by Northwest&quot; had.&quot; Benson&#x27;s only complaint was the lack of a central villain, though he praised the &quot;well-written female characters (Sukie Tempesta and Nannie Norrich)&quot; who accompany Bond.

<doc id="1275469" wikidata="Q1502420" url="?curid=1275469" title="Gennaker">
<text>A gennaker is a sail that was developed around 1990. Used when sailing downwind, it is a cross between a genoa and a spinnaker. It is not symmetric like a true spinnaker but is asymmetric like a genoa, but the gennaker is not attached to the forestay like a jib or genoa. The gennaker is rigged like a spinnaker but the tack is fastened to the hull or to a bowsprit. It has greater camber than a genoa (but significantly less camber than a spinnaker). This is optimal for generating lift at larger angles of attack. An early form of gennaker was the &quot;gollywhomper&quot;, used briefly in the 1870s.

The gennaker is a specialty sail primarily used on racing boats to bridge the performance gap between a genoa and a spinnaker. It is sometimes the only downwind sail on board because it is easier to use and less expensive than a spinnaker. Due to its geometry, the sail is less prone to collapsing than a spinnaker. A gennaker is optimal for a beam reach, while an asymmetrical spinnaker is optimal for a broad reach or run.

<doc id="1275470" wikidata="Q1535153" url="?curid=1275470" title="Superhero film">
<text>Superhero films are a movie genre that focuses on one or more superheroes, characters who often possess superhuman abilities and fight against villains or threats to humanity. Ensemble superhero films often showcase a diverse range of character archetypes, each with unique abilities and personalities.

Traditionally, the first film in a series about a superhero focuses on their origin story and introduces the hero&#x27;s nemesis. The films typically contain elements of the action, adventure, fantasy, or science fiction genres. They often address themes of power, justice, morality, and immortality.

Many superhero films are adaptations of existing works, though some, such as &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, are developed as original projects. Comic books, especially those published by Marvel and DC, have frequently provided source material for these types of films. Many have been based on pre-existing live-action, animation, or radio stories.

==History==
===1939–1978: Early years===
Superhero stories initially gained popularity through comic books and were later adapted into film serials. Early examples include &quot;Mandrake the Magician&quot; (1939), &quot;The Shadow&quot; (1940), &quot;Adventures of Captain Marvel&quot; (1941), &quot;Batman&quot; (1943), &quot;The Phantom&quot; (1943), &quot;Captain America&quot; (1944), and &quot;Superman&quot; (1948).

Between 1941 and 1942, Fleischer Studios produced a series of eight animated cartoons and one additional short based on the &quot;Superman&quot; comic book. Famous Studios, the successor of Fleischer Studios, created eight more cartoons between 1942 and 1943.

In the following decades, the decline of Saturday matinee showings of serials, along with turmoil in the comic book industry, slowed superhero motion picture production greatly (although films were still being produced, namely &quot;Superman and the Mole Men&quot; (1951), starring George Reeves, and &quot;Batman&quot; (1966), a big-screen extension of the &quot;Batman&quot; television series starring Adam West). &quot;Superman and the Mole Men&quot; served as a pilot for the TV series &quot;Adventures of Superman.&quot; Compilations of the series were later released theatrically.
====Tokusatsu====

In 1957, Shintoho produced the first film serial featuring the &quot;tokusatsu&quot; superhero character Super Giant, marking a shift in Japanese popular culture toward masked superheroes in &quot;tokusatsu&quot;. Along with &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, the &quot;Super Giant&quot; film series heavily influenced later Japanese &quot;tokusatsu&quot; superhero films. Moonlight Mask also became popular around that time, with six films retelling the story of the TV series. Another early Japanese superhero film was &quot;Ōgon Bat&quot; (1966), starring Sonny Chiba, based on the 1931 &quot;kamishibai&quot; superhero Ōgon Bat.
==== Kaiju films ====

Although kaiju movies or movies containing kaiju monsters do not typically fall under the superhero category, the &quot;kaiju&quot; monster Godzilla, originally a villain, transitioned into a superhero role in subsequent films. He has been described as &quot;the original radioactive superhero&quot; due to his nuclear origin story predating Spider-Man&#x27;s&#x27;s 1962 debut, although Godzilla did not become a hero until &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot; (1964). By the 1970s, Godzilla was viewed as a superhero, with the magazine &quot;King of the Monsters&quot; describing Godzilla in 1977 as the &quot;Superhero of the &#x27;70s&quot;. Donald F. Glut wrote Godzilla was &quot;the most universally popular superhero of 1977.&quot;

1966 saw the debut of the &quot;Ultra Series&quot; with the &quot;kaiju&quot; TV show &quot;Ultra Q&quot;. With the release of the original &quot;Ultraman&quot;, the franchise started focusing on superheroes and the series averaged an audience rating of 36.8% through its first 39 episodes. In 1967, &quot;Ultraman&quot; started expanding to films. Early films, such as &quot;&quot;, were compilations or theatrical releases of TV show episodes. The first original &quot;Ultraman&quot; film was &quot;The 6 Ultra Brothers vs. the Monster Army,&quot; a co-production with Thailand. 

The rise in popularity of television superheroes in Japan led to the &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; and &quot;Super Sentai&quot; franchises by manga artist Shotaro Ishinomori in 1971 and 1975, respectively. Similar to &quot;Ultraman&quot;, many early &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; and &quot;Super Sentai&quot; episodes were released as films. Original &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; films released before 1978 include &quot;Kamen Rider vs. Shocker&quot;, &quot;Kamen Rider vs. Ambassador Hell&quot;, &quot;Kamen Rider V3 vs. Destron Mutants,&quot; and &quot;Five Riders vs. King Dark&quot;.

Original superhero characters emerged in other, more comedy-oriented films, such as the French political satire film &quot;Mr. Freedom&quot; (1969), the Polish parody &quot;Hydrozagadka&quot; (1970), and the American B movies &quot;Rat Pfink a Boo Boo&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Wild World of Batwoman&quot; (1966).

===1978–1998: Rising popularity with &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Kamen Rider&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, and &quot;Ultraman Zearth&quot;===
Following the success of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Richard Donner&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot; (1978), the first big-budget DC feature film, was a critical and commercial success. The same year Toei Company&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; reimagining and the first &quot;Super Sentai&quot; crossover film, &quot;JAKQ Dengekitai vs. Gorenger&quot;, were released. Other entries emerged throughout the 1980s including &quot;Eight Riders vs. Galaxy King&quot; (1980), &quot;Kamen Rider Super-1: The Movie&quot; (1981), Richard Lester&#x27;s &quot;Superman II&quot; (1981), &quot;Spider-Man: The Dragon&#x27;s Challenge&quot; (1981), and Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s &quot;RoboCop&quot; (1987). These were followed by &quot;Kamen Rider Black: Hurry to Onigashima&quot; and &quot;Kamen Rider Black: Terrifying! The Phantom House of Devil Pass&quot;, both released in 1988. The success of Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; (1989) and its direct follow-up, &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992), spawned the DC Animated Universe.

Moving into the 90&#x27;s, one of the first films was Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Captain America&quot; (1991) which did not have a theatrical release. Roger Corman&#x27;s &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; (1994) was produced solely for the legal maintenance of the film rights to the property. and was not released theatrically or on home video.

Alex Proyas&#x27; &quot;The Crow&quot; (1994) became the first independent comic superhero franchise film. The film introduced a new level of violence to a younger audience, bridging the gap between the superhero film and the modern action film. The success of &quot;The Crow&quot; may have influenced the release of a film version of &quot;Spawn&quot; (1997), Image Comics&#x27;s leading character. After Marvel bought Malibu Comics (the company which owned &quot;The Men in Black&quot; comic series), Marvel and Columbia Pictures released &quot;Men in Black&quot; in 1997. This film was the first Marvel property to win an Academy Award and, at the time, was the highest-grossing comic book adaptation. While commercially successful, Joel Schumacher&#x27;s &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; (1997) was critically panned for its campiness and deviation from the darker style of the series&#x27; first two films directed by Tim Burton. Some have cited it as a factor in the temporary decline of the superhero film sub-genre.

In Japan in the 1990s, original &quot;Ultraman&quot; films became more common. In 1996, Tsuburaya released &quot;Ultraman Zearth&quot;, which parodied the original TV series and later instalments. The following year, the sequel titled &quot;Ultraman Zearth 2: Superhuman Big Battle - Light and Shadow&quot; premiered.

===1998–2007: Further rise with &quot;Blade and Blade II,&quot; &quot;X-Men&quot;, Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Daredevil&quot;, and &quot;Batman Begins&quot;===
In 1998, Marvel released &quot;Blade&quot;, a darker superhero film blended with traditional action elements. The title character featured the powers of a vampire and an arsenal of weaponry. The success of &quot;Blade&quot; is considered the beginning of Marvel&#x27;s film success and a catalyst for further comic book film adaptations. The popularity of the &quot;Ultraman Tiga&quot; TV series led to several films based on it and later installments, including &quot;Ultraman Tiga &amp; Ultraman Dyna: Warriors of the Star of Light&quot; (1998), &quot;Ultraman Gaia: The Battle in Hyperspace&quot; (1999) and &quot;Ultraman Tiga: The Final Odyssey&quot; (2000). Adam Sternbergh of &quot;Vulture&quot; has stated &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999) was influenced by comic books, cyberpunk fiction, Japanese anime, and Hong Kong action films, and reinvented the superhero film. It set the template for modern superhero blockbusters and inspired the superhero renaissance in the early 21st century.

John Kenneth Muir, in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Superheroes on Film and Television&quot;, describes &quot;The Matrix&quot; as a re-imagination of movie visuals, paving the way for the visuals of later superhero films. He credits it with helping to &quot;make comic-book superheroes hip&quot;. He notes the bullet-time effect successfully demonstrates the concept of &quot;faster than a speeding bullet&quot; onscreen. &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; and &quot;Mystery Men&quot; would then follow to close out the decade for the sub-genre.

On the Japanese front, following the success of the &quot;Kamen Rider Kuuga&quot; television series, a new era of the &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; franchise began, leading to the production of annual &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; movies, starting with &quot;Kamen Rider Agito: Project G4&quot; in 2001.

===2008–present: Ubiquity with the MCU and DCEU, expansion to streaming services===
==== 2008–2014 ====
The release of &quot;Iron Man&quot; in 2008 began the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). A few months later, &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; was released to widespread critical acclaim and became the first superhero movie to make over $1 billion at the worldwide box office. 2009 saw the release of &quot;Watchmen&quot; and &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot;. The 2010s saw continued success for superhero films both culturally and economically, taking the sub-genre&#x27;s success and ubiquity to new heights. Matthew Vaughn&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Kick-Ass&quot; was released in 2010, followed by &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; a month later. 2011 releases included &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;, &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, and &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot;. After referencing the &quot;Avengers Initiative&quot; in the &quot;Iron Man&quot; films and &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, Marvel released &quot;Thor&quot; in May 2011, followed by &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot; in July 2011.

While &quot;Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance&quot; (2012) had little audience interest, superhero films dominated the 2012 summer film market, with three films occupying the top three positions of the box office chart. These were Marvel&#x27;s &quot;The Avengers&quot; (May 2012), which became the highest-grossing superhero film at the time, &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; (July 2012), and &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; (July 2012). 

A &quot;Superman Returns&quot; sequel was planned for 2009 but was delayed and later scrapped in favor of &quot;Man of Steel&quot; (2013), a reboot of the Superman franchise.

At the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, Marvel confirmed an &quot;Ant-Man&quot; film was in development, as well as a film based on the 2008 comic book series &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;, which was released in August 2014. &quot;Iron Man 3&quot; was released in May 2013, &quot;&quot; in November 2013, and &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot; in April 2014. &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot;, the sequel to the 2012 reboot, was released in May 2014. In 2013, a sequel to the 2009 film &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot;, titled &quot;The Wolverine&quot; was released. In 2014, &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; was released and became the highest-grossing film in the &quot;X-Men&quot; series at the time.

In 2014, Italian filmmaker Gabriele Salvatores directed a superhero-fantasy film titled &quot;Il Ragazzo Invisible&quot; (&quot;The Invisible Boy&quot;) which won the Young Audience Award at the 2015 European Film Awards.

==== 2015—2018 ====
An &quot;Avengers&quot; sequel, titled &quot;&quot;, was released in May 2015. Following the success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, rival DC also planned to make and produce their own shared film universe called the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), which began with the release of &quot;Man of Steel&quot; in 2013&quot;.&quot; A sequel titled &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; was scheduled for release in May 2016 but was later postponed to March 2016. Nickelodeon&#x27;s 2015 film, &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water,&quot; features the main characters transforming into superheroes. 20th Century Fox rebooted the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; series and released &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; in August 2015.

On March 9, 2015, publishing house Valiant Comics made a nine-figure deal with Chinese company DMG Entertainment to produce their series of superhero movies set in their cinematic universe. The series was co-produced by Sony Pictures and started with a movie adaptation of &quot;Bloodshot&quot; for a 2020 release, which will be followed by &quot;Harbinger&quot;, both movies receiving a sequel and ending in a crossover movie based on the &quot;Harbinger Wars&quot; arc from the comic books.

In 2015, Italian filmmaker Gabrielle Mainetti directed the superhero film &quot;They Call Me Jeeg&quot; starring Claudio Santamaria. Its original title is &quot;Lo Chiamavano Jeeg Robot&quot;, from the Italian name of the anime and manga series &quot;Steel Jeeg&quot;. It was released in Italy on February 25, 2016.

The eighth installment in the &quot;X-Men&quot; series, &quot;Deadpool,&quot; was released in February 2016. It later went on to become the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time (when adjusted for inflation) and the highest-grossing film of the series. The ninth installment, &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot;, was released in May. Warner Bros. released &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;, the first film to feature both Batman and Superman, in March 2016. &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;, released in August, featured a team of antihero/supervillains. &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; and &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; are in the DCEU.

In May 2016, Marvel Studios released &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot;, in which the Avengers split into two opposing factions. In October, &quot;Max Steel,&quot; based on the eponymous toy line by Mattel, was released. In November of the same year, Marvel Studios released &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;, which recounts the superhero origin of Stephen Strange.

The first Finnish superhero film, &quot;Rendel: Dark Vengeance&quot;, was released in September 2017 and it won the Best Action Movie award at the Erratum Film Festival in Mexico. &quot;Power Rangers&quot;, a movie reboot of the TV series, was released in March, with Lionsgate planning a seven-film franchise. The film &quot;Logan&quot;, which was Hugh Jackman&#x27;s and Patrick Stewart&#x27;s last appearances as their characters in the &quot;X-Men&quot; film series before Disney acquired 20th Century Fox, was the first ever canon X-Men movie to be rated R and the first superhero movie to receive an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. In the summer movie season, &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&quot;, &quot;Wonder Woman,&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; confirmed the superhero film dominance of the mainstream movie market. That dominance continued into the fall with the success of &quot;.&quot; Due to this, Warner Bros. attempted to have a shared universe media franchise, the DCEU, with &quot;Justice League&quot;, though this poorly received and a box office disappointment.

In February 2018, Marvel Studios released &quot;Black Panther&quot;, featuring the solo film adaptation of the first mainstream Black superhero, the Black Panther, which was a commercial and critical success in the MCU franchise. It became the first superhero film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

This MCU project was soon followed up by &quot;&quot;, released in April 2018, which earned both critical acclaim and worldwide financial success, earning more than $2 billion. Soon after, 20th Century Fox released &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; in May 2018. In addition, &quot;Incredibles 2&quot; had its wide release in June 2018, and was met with considerable critical acclaim and earned $182.68 million during its premiere weekend. The next superhero film in the MCU, &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp&quot; was released on July 6th, with competing studios declining to release major films on American Independence Day in the face of the reliably known film franchise.

The antihero film &quot;Venom,&quot; based on the comic book character of the same name, was released in October 2018 to poor reviews but box-office success. In December 2018, Warner Bros. released &quot;Aquaman&quot;, a film about the DC Comics superhero of the same name, which became the DCEU&#x27;s most successful film at the box office, grossing $1.148 billion worldwide.

==== 2019—present ====
Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; was released in March 2019 and faced online hostility, stemming in part from star Brie Larson&#x27;s comments about the lack of diversity in the film and film criticism industries. Despite the controversy, it earned over highest-grossing film of all time and received largely positive reviews. Later in April, the DCEU&#x27;s &quot;Shazam!&quot;, featuring the lead character who was previously known as Captain Marvel, had decent box office success for a relatively low budget, which has been seen as further evidence of the revitalization of the Warner Bros. media franchise. That same month, &quot;&quot; ended the Infinity Saga to widespread acclaim, broke numerous box office records, and became the fastest film to exceed $1 billion worldwide, doing so in just five days. &quot;Avengers: Endgame&quot; became the highest-grossing film of all time, surpassing James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Avatar&quot; for over two years before the latter retook its place.

By contrast, the X-Men film &quot;Dark Phoenix&quot; performed poorly critically and financially upon release in June. This would be the last film in 20th Century Fox&#x27;s X-Men series. Afterward, X-Men and the Fantastic Four both entered the MCU with Disney&#x27;s acquisition of 20th Century Fox (however, neither franchise would receive a standalone film in the MCU until 2024&#x27;s &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;; the first Fantastic Four standalone film, &quot;The Fantastic Four: First Steps&quot;, is planned for release in 2025). In July 2019, Phase 3 of the MCU was concluded with the Marvel and Sony co-produced film &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home,&quot; which was released to critical and commercial success.

In August 2019, Joko Anwar&#x27;s &quot;Gundala&quot; was released in Indonesia. It was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival in September and was the first entry in the Bumilangit Cinematic Universe (BCU) film series based on characters of comic books published by Bumilangit. The second and third films in the series, &quot;Sri Asih&quot; and &quot;Patriot Taruna: Virgo and the Sparklings&quot;, were announced for a 2020 release but were pushed back to 2021 as production was significantly delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The production company&#x27;s strategy of announcing films in volumes with a team-up film as the climax has led to the media dubbing it the &quot;Indonesian equivalent to the MCU and DCEU&quot;.

&quot;The Suicide Squad&quot; was released in August but was a box office disappointment despite receiving positive reviews. The poor performance was attributed to the disruption of cinema during the COVID-19 pandemic (particularly the Delta variant) and confusion from the general audience on whether the film was a sequel, reboot, or remake. Meanwhile, Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&quot; broke Labor Day records, while similar successes were seen in the Sony&#x27;s Spider-Man Universe (SSU) film &quot;&quot;. Despite mediocre reviews and the first rotten rating for a MCU film on Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Eternals&quot; opened to moderate success at the box office.

&quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; was released in December 2021, and became the highest-grossing film of 2021, the highest-grossing film of all time, the third-highest-grossing film in the United States and Canada, the highest-grossing &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film, and the highest-grossing film produced by Sony. It also became the first film to gross over $1 billion since &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot; largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the highest-grossing film not to be released in China (one of the world&#x27;s biggest box office markets).

In 2022, Warner Bros. released &quot;The Batman&quot;, a reboot of the Batman film series, and unconnected to the DC Extended Universe. It was a critical and commercial hit, with praise for the film being a grounded detective story, due to Matt Reeves&#x27; direction and Robert Pattinson&#x27;s performance as the titular hero. It went on to become the second biggest pandemic debut, after &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot;. &quot;Morbius&quot;, starring Jared Leto and based on the Spider-Man villain of the same name debuted that April as another chapter in Sony&#x27;s Spider-Man Universe. The film was critically panned and a box-office bomb. Variety reported whilst the initial opening was hopeful for &quot;Morbius&quot;, &quot;the character is not nearly as recognizable to general audiences as Spider-Man, Batman or Venom, nor is the film connected to a larger story like &quot;Eternals&quot; or &quot;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&quot;. Thus, &quot;Morbius&quot; wasn&#x27;t expected to match the receipts for recent comic book tent-poles based on those characters.&quot; Scott Mendelson further stated Sony seemed to rely on the film&#x27;s connection to the Spider-Man universe, the success of &quot;Venom&quot; and a misguided assumption that audiences were interested in villain movies.

In May 2022, Sam Raimi returned to the superhero genre with &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot;. The film was met with mixed-to-positive reviews and earned $187million on its opening weekend, becoming the eleventh-best domestic debut of all time, the best summer debut for a Disney release during the pandemic, and Raimi&#x27;s best opening. In its second weekend, the film earned $61 million, becoming one of the MCU&#x27;s most significant second-weekend box office drops. The 67% decline was attributed by &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; to the &quot;bad word of mouth&quot; on the film and its CinemaScore grade. At the same time, Intelligence saw more than 17% downsize of available seats for the film, resulting in fewer showtimes, which also led to the decline. In its third weekend, the film earned $31.6million, contributing to the 800-million-dollar mark at the box office to become Hollywood&#x27;s second-highest-grossing film released during the pandemic behind &quot;No Way Home&quot;. The film earned $16.4million in its fourth weekend, contributing to the total box office that helped it to become the highest-grossing film of 2022 previously held by &quot;The Batman&quot;. As of June 2022, the film stands as the 11th highest-grossing of the MCU worldwide.

In 2023, a majority of the superhero films released, such as &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&quot;, &quot;Shazam! Fury of the Gods&quot;, &quot;The Flash&quot;, &quot;Blue Beetle&quot;, &quot;The Marvels&quot;, and &quot;Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&quot;, were moderate commercial failures. Only two superhero films released that year, &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot;, performed well at the box office, grossing $845 million and $690 million, respectively, turning a profit alongside positive reviews from audiences and critics.

In February 2024, Sony released its fourth film in the Spider-Man Universe, &quot;Madame Web&quot;. The film was panned by critics and underperformed at the box office. In July, the MCU&#x27;s first film of the year, &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;, also happened to be its first R-rated film. It was Hugh Jackman&#x27;s first X-Men film since 2017&#x27;s &quot;Logan&quot; and Ryan Reynolds&#x27; Deadpool&#x27;s MCU debut. So far, the film has been highly acclaimed and has grossed over $1.28 billion worldwide, making it the 20th highest-grossing film of all time, the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, and the second-highest-grossing film of 2024 to date. Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;&quot; (not connected to the DCEU), sequel to the 2019 film, &quot;Joker&quot;, was released in October 2024. Joaquin Phoenix reprised his role as The Joker and Lady Gaga made her superhero film debut as Harley Quinn. &quot;Joker: Folie a Deux&quot; was followed by Sony Spider-Man Universe films &quot;&quot; in November 2024, and &quot;Kraven the Hunter&quot; in December 2024. In 2025 Sam Willison received his first appearance as Captain America in Captain America: Brave New World in February. 

==== Economic importance ====
Throughout the 2010s, superhero films played a major role in the film industry. According to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, &quot;With rare exception, even A+ stars aren&#x27;t making what they used to&quot; making it &quot;one of the last ways for an actor to earn a major payday&quot;. The article says, &quot;If you want to get paid, you have to put on a cape.&quot; It also states characters like Spider-Man and Batman are more important than the actors themselves.

Since 2022, superhero films (mainly from the MCU) have seen more inconsistent performances. 2023&#x27;s &quot;The Marvels&quot; had the worst box-office showing for an MCU film since 2008&#x27;s &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; amid a broader trend of box office disappointments for superhero films. Joe Russo disputed disappointing box office results suggested cultural fatigue with superhero films; instead, he suggested there may be a &quot;generational divide&quot; in media consumption driving declining box office performance. 

== Animated ==
Outside of live-action, animated superhero films have also achieved critical and financial success. While animated superhero films are typically direct-to-video, there have been a number released theatrically. &quot;&quot;, which was released theatrically, was a critical success, though a box-office failure. In 1968, &quot;VIP my Brother Superman, a parody of the superhero genre&quot; directed by Italian animator Bruno Bozzetto was a financial success. In 2004, Pixar released &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, about a retired superhero couple and their children, which did extremely well both critically and financially and went on to win the Academy Award. In 2010 DreamWorks Animation released &quot;Megamind&quot; to middling success. In 2014 Walt Disney Animation Studios released an adaptation of the Marvel superhero team &quot;Big Hero 6&quot;. The same year, Warner Bros. released &quot;The Lego Movie&quot;, which had Batman and other DC superheroes in major and supporting roles. A significant box-office success, it was followed in 2017 by &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot;, as well as DreamWorks Animation&#x27;s &quot;Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie&quot;.

In 2018, three theatrical animated superhero films were released to critical and commercial success: Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Incredibles 2&quot;, Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;Teen Titans Go! To the Movies&quot;, and Sony Pictures Animation&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot;. &quot;Into the Spider-Verse&quot; swept that year&#x27;s major film awards for animated features, including the Academy Award. A sequel to &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot; came out in 2023, titled &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot; to further acclaim. Another Spider-Verse sequel, &quot;Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse&quot;, is currently in production with no set release date.

== Criticism ==
As the number of superhero films being produced increased during the latter end of the 2010s, the genre&#x27;s contribution to cinema was questioned. In a 2019 interview with &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, American filmmaker Martin Scorsese commented, &quot;The closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn&#x27;t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.&quot; He stated the Marvel Cinematic Universe was not &quot;cinema&quot;. He later added he was worried about studios&#x27; dependence on the format because in &quot;many places around this country and the world, franchise films are now your primary choice if you want to see something on the big screen. It&#x27;s a perilous time in film exhibition, and there are fewer independent theaters than ever.&quot; 

Criticism of Marvel Studios&#x27; films continued with Jennifer Aniston stating Marvel movies are &quot;diminishing&quot;. Denis Villeneuve dismissed &quot;too many Marvel films&quot; as being &quot;a cut and paste of others,&quot; and Roland Emmerich stated large blockbuster films such as the MCU and &quot;Star Wars&quot; films were &quot;ruining our industry a little&quot; since &quot;nobody does anything original anymore&quot;. 

Some media commentators have attributed the increasingly popular superhero franchises in the new millennium to the social and political climate in Western society since the September 11 attacks, although others have argued advances in special effects technology have played a more significant role. 

There is also additional questioning as to how broad or vague the superhero genre is – and whether it could be legitimately classified as a film genre at all – when the basic definition is that of a benevolent hero or antihero with superhuman abilities. In this case, many other films not traditionally associated with superhero plots would fall under the same description.

Writer Alan Moore, a veteran of the comics industry known for his work on &quot;Watchmen&quot;, &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;, , and &quot;From Hell&quot;, has expressed criticism of modern superhero movies in general, which he once called a &quot;blight&quot; to cinema and &quot;also to culture to a degree.&quot; He said in an October 2022 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; the popularization of the genre on the part of adults is an &quot;infantilization&quot; that can act as &quot;a precursor to fascism.&quot; Lamenting at how deeply such films became part of the culture, Moore commented:&quot;I will always love and adore the comics medium, but the comics industry and all of the stuff attached to it just became unbearable...Hundreds of thousands of adults [are] lining up to see characters and situations that had been created to entertain the 12-year-old boys – and it &quot;was&quot; always boys – of 50 years ago. I didn&#x27;t think that superheroes were adult fare. I think that this was a misunderstanding born of what happened in the 1980s – to which I must put my hand up to a considerable share of the blame, though it was not intentional – when things like Watchmen were first appearing. There were an awful lot of headlines saying, &#x27;Comics Have Grown Up&#x27;. I tend to think that, no, comics hadn&#x27;t grown up. There were a few titles that were more adult than people were used to. But the majority of comics titles were pretty much the same as they&#x27;d ever been. It wasn&#x27;t comics growing up. I think it was more comics meeting the emotional age of the audience coming the other way.&quot;In a September 2023 interview with &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, Moore reiterated this view, saying what had appealed to him most about output from comics publishers was &quot;no more,&quot; saying, &quot;Now they&#x27;re called &#x27;graphic novels&#x27;, which sounds sophisticated, and you can charge a lot more for them. These innocent and inventive and imaginative superhero characters from the &#x27;40s, &#x27;50s, and &#x27;60s are being recycled to a modern audience as if they were adult fare.&quot; During that same interview, journalist Jake Kerridge asked Moore if it was true he divided the money he had received from onscreen adaptations of his work among the writers and other staff persons of those productions. Moore replied, &quot;I no longer wish it to even be shared with them. I don&#x27;t feel, with the recent films, that they have stood by what I assumed were their original principles. So, I asked for DC Comics to send all of the money from any future TV series or films to Black Lives Matter.&quot;

By the 2020s, &quot;superhero fatigue&quot; emerged to describe audience weariness with formulaic superhero films, reflected in declining box-office returns and mixed reviews. In particular, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been criticized for over-saturating the market with its expansion to streaming beginning with Phase Four, prompting Marvel Studios to rethink its annual output.

== Parody ==

* Andrzej Kondratiuk&#x27;s 1970 film &quot;Hydrozagadka&quot; is a parody of the American ideals glorified in superhero films.
* Kinka Usher&#x27;s 1999 film &quot;Mystery Men&quot; features a group of inept amateur superheroes.
* Another comedic play on superheroes is &quot;The Specials&quot;, a 2000 film in which the title team is more concerned with their public image than actually being superheroes.
* Kevin Smith&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; parodies film companies&#x27; seemingly compulsive purchase of comic book film rights with &quot;Bluntman and Chronic.&quot; In the film, the character Brodie Bruce (played by Jason Lee) describes the process: &quot;Well, after &quot;X-Men&quot; hit at the box office, all the studios started buying out every comic property they could get their dirty little hands on.&quot;
* Mark Hamill&#x27;s 2004 parody film &quot;Comic Book: The Movie&quot;, was about a comic book fan and a film adaptation of his favorite character and was released direct-to-video and achieved mild success, garnering a cult following among comic book readers.
* Craig Mazin directed the more direct parody &quot;Superhero Movie&quot;, released in 2008.
* 2008&#x27;s &quot;Hancock&quot; was a subversion of the genre by having the title character become a reluctant superhero. The movie grossed more than $629 million at the box office.
* Matthew Vaughn directed the 2010 film &quot;Kick-Ass&quot;, which saw a normal teenager turn to fighting crime. A sequel, &quot;Kick-Ass 2&quot; was released in 2013.
* James Gunn directed and wrote the 2010 film Super starring Rainn Wilson.
* Alejandro González Iñárritu&#x27;s Oscar-winning 2014 film &quot;Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)&quot; satirizes Hollywood&#x27;s reliance on superhero and blockbuster films. In the film, Michael Keaton portrays Riggan Thomson, a washed-up Hollywood actor known for playing the superhero Birdman in blockbuster movies decades earlier. He is tormented by Birdman&#x27;s voice, which mocks and criticizes him, and he sees himself performing feats of levitation and telekinesis.
* The 2016 movie &quot;Deadpool&quot; and its 2018 sequel &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; were box-office juggernauts, making $782.6 million and $785.8 million, respectively. &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine,&quot; which was released in 2024, has grossed approximately $1.3 billion and currently sits on the list of highest-grossing superhero films.
* Philippe Lacheau&#x27;s 2021 French movie &quot;Super-héros malgré lui&quot; or Super Who? in English follows an actor who landed the role of a superhero named &quot;Badman.&quot; The actor suffers an accident that causes him amnesia and he starts believing that he is an actual superhero. The movie references DC and Marvel while making fun of the superhero film genre.
* Quentin Dupieux’s 2022 French film &quot;Fumer Fait Tousser&quot; (&quot;Smoking Causes Coughing&quot;) follows a team of five superheroes called the Tobacco Force who, following a battle against a diabolical giant turtle that goes wrong, go on a compulsory retreat to strengthen cohesion within their group. Soon, however, an enemy named Lézardin interrupts the retreat to destroy the planet Earth.

== Box office reception ==

According to Box Office Mojo, the ten highest-grossing (as of January 2025) superhero films are:

The Marvel Cinematic Universe alone has earned over $31 billion and is the largest film franchise in history, beating out Star Wars by more than $7 billion. Its highest grossing film, &quot;&quot; (2019), briefly held the record for the highest-grossing film of all time before being surpassed by a record-breaking re-release of &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009) in 2021.

<doc id="1275473" wikidata="Q5164918" url="?curid=1275473" title="Contamination delay">
<text>In digital circuits, the contamination delay (denoted as tcd) is the minimum amount of time from when an input changes until any output starts to change its value. This change in value does not imply that the value has reached a stable condition. The contamination delay only specifies that the output rises (or falls) to 50% of the voltage level for a logic high. The circuit is guaranteed not to show any output change in response to an input change before tcd time units (calculated for the whole circuit) have passed. The determination of the contamination delay of a combined circuit requires identifying the shortest path of contamination delays from input to output and by adding each tcd time along this path.

For a sequential circuit such as two D-flip flops connected in series, the contamination delay of the first flip-flop must be factored in to avoid violating the hold-time constraint of the second flip-flop receiving the output from the first flip flop. Here, the contamination delay is the amount of time needed for a change in the flip-flop clock input to result in the initial change at the flip-flop output (Q).
If there is insufficient delay from the output of the first flip-flop to the input of the second, the input may change before the hold time has passed. Because the second flip-flop is still unstable, its data would then be &quot;contaminated.&quot; Every path from an input to an output can be characterized with a particular contamination delay.

Well-balanced circuits will have similar speeds for all paths through a combinational stage, so the minimum propagation time is close to the maximum. This corresponding maximum time is the propagation delay. The condition of data being contaminated is called a race.

<text>The Knowledge Machine is a concept of Seymour Papert, which is intended to enable children to explore any situation and engage them completely. Although Papert never clearly defined the Knowledge Machine, one interpretation is a virtual reality device that allows the user to slip into any situation and have a simulated experience of that situation.

The Knowledge Machine (KM) is also a developed system at the University of Texas for knowledge representation and reasoning within the artificial intelligence field. km was developed and continues to be actively maintained by Peter Clark and Bruce Porter.

<text>Jump &#x27;n Bump is a 1998 freeware (or emailware) and open-source MS-DOS platform multiplayer video game by Brainchild Design.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Jump &#x27;n Bump&quot; has no plot, other than that it involves up to four rabbits in multiplayer deathmatch: &quot;Dott&quot;, &quot;Jiffy&quot;, &quot;Fizz&quot;, and &quot;Mijji&quot;, trying to hop onto each other&#x27;s heads to squish each other and score a point, while sending gibs flying everywhere. The rabbits are controlled by players on the same computer, using the keyboard, mouse, and/or joystick.

== Development ==
&quot;Jump &#x27;n Bump&quot; was written in C and Assembly language by Brainchild Design in 1998. The graphics were made with Deluxe Paint 2 and PaintShop Pro 5. The Mod music was made with FastTracker 2. Although the players&#x27; scores are tracked, the game continues indefinitely until it is ended by the players.

In 1999 the game with its source code was released as Emailware. The game has since been ported to a number of other operating systems and platforms, with the release of a SDL version.

Brainchild Design has since become inactive. Their website refers to Bitbliss Studios for more games.

== Reception ==
&quot;Jump &#x27;n Bump&quot; was mentioned as one of the earliest &quot;instant kill games&quot; when &quot;Samurai Gunn&quot; was compared to it in 2013. The &quot;N++&quot; developers cited in 2014 Jump &#x27;n Bump as inspiration for the Deathmatch mode in their game.

Due to the popularity and source code availability the game was ported to newer systems and platforms like Windows, Android, PlayStation 2, Wii and several others.

The game helped inspire the later indie game &quot;Bunnies&quot; by BlackHoleSun Software.

<text>Lumban, officially the Municipality of Lumban (), is a municipality in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 Census, it has a population of 32,330 people.

Lumban, one of Laguna&#x27;s oldest towns, is located approximately from Santa Cruz, southeast of Manila, and north of Lucena. It derives its name from Aleurites moluccanus, a tree locally known as &#x27;lumbang&#x27;. The province&#x27;s capital town, Santa Cruz, as well as Cavinti and Pagsanjan, were once part of Lumban. The river where the Laguna Copperplate Inscription was found runs through the town.

Lumban is home to Lake Caliraya, an artificial lake popular with nature lovers and sports enthusiasts. It is known as the &quot;Embroidery Capital of the Philippines,&quot; where fine Jusi and Piña cloth are hand-embroidered, with the finished product used for the barong tagalog worn by men and the saya (skirt) worn by women in a baro&#x27;t saya outfit. Lumban is also known for its diverse range of shoes, sandals, slippers, and step-in designs made from local materials.

== History ==

=== Spanish colonial period ===
The town of Lumban was founded on September 22, 1578, by Fray Juan de Plasencia and Fray Diego de Oropesa, who planted a holy cross in the area. The first church, dedicated to San Francisco and made of bamboo and nipa, was burned in 1586. With the collaboration of Governor Don Santiago de Vera and a local Tagalog chief named Burlon, construction began on a new stone church and was completed in 1600. Lumban was formally organized as a town on September 22, 1590.

The Church of Lumban is claimed to be the first Franciscan building in the Philippines outside Manila.

During the early Spanish period, Lumban was a large town that included the modern-day towns of Santa Cruz, Cavinti and Pagsanjan. Santa Cruz was separated from Lumban in 1602, followed by Cavinti in 1619 and Pagsanjan in 1668.

==Geography==
===Barangays===
Lumban is politically subdivided into 16 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks, and some have sitios.

A dispute exists regarding the Caliraya Watershed on the eastern half of Barangay Caliraya between the municipalities of Kalayaan and Cavinti.

===Lake Caliraya===

Lumban is home to Lake Caliraya, a man-made lake created in 1939 that has become a popular spot for water sports and outdoor recreation, including fishing. The surrounding area features numerous tourist-friendly resorts, and vacation homes are common due to the local scenery and climate.

===Caliraya Dam===

Caliraya Dam is an embankment dam located in Lumban, Laguna, in the Sierra Madre Mountain Range of the Philippines. The reservoir created by the dam, Lake Caliraya, initially supplied one of the oldest hydroelectric plants in the Philippines and later became a recreational area for water sports and fishing. Work on the dam began in 1939, and a small hydroelectric plant was operational by 1942.

Lake Caliraya was later connected to Lumot Lake, another man-made lake, via a 2.3 km (1.4 mi) underground penstock to increase water supply. Subsequently, the dam and lake were used as the upper reservoir for the Kalayaan Pumped-Storage Hydroelectric plant located west of Lake Caliraya, with Laguna de Bay as the lower reservoir.

==Demographics==
According to the 2020 census, the population of Lumban was 32,330, with a density of .

== Economy ==
==Culture==

The town fiesta is held every January 20 in honor of San Sebastian, the town&#x27;s patron saint. The Lupi festival is held every last Sunday of January.

===Feast of San Sebastian===

The San Sebastian Festival features a procession on the Lumban River, where the icon of the patron saint San Sebastian, along with hundreds of devotees, is placed on &#x27;Kaskitos&#x27;, a fleet of large boats.

The San Sebastian Festival originated after the people adopted Saint Sebastian the Martyr as their patron saint in the 18th century during the Franciscan mission in the town. This annual celebration, observed every fourth Sunday of January, includes a series of religious and cultural activities alongside the town fiesta.

The Moro-Moro, or “Komedya,” is performed the evening before the Festival, showcasing local talents with colourful costumes.

The “Paligong Poon” takes place at the Lumban River, where the icon of San Sebastian and hundreds of devotees float on “Kaskitos” (a fleet of large boats), holding lit candles and performing rituals across the river, known as “Lupi”.

Civic and religious organizations, as well as local bands, participate in the event. The icon is paraded around the town while locals take turns dousing the saint and devotees with water, witnessed by spectators from the municipality and neighboring towns.

During the feast, each barangay of Lumban features its own icon of the patron saint on a float, accompanied by the nine-day novena of the Hermanas of the town.

Townspeople participate in a water-throwing ritual symbolizing purification and blessings, in accordance with the ritual ceremony of the patron saint of Lumban.

===Burdang Lumban Festival===

Lumban hosts the Burdang Lumban Festival, an annual celebration of the local tradition of hand embroidery, during the third week of September. The festival aims to promote tourism to the municipality.

Lumban is known for its barong Tagalog, wedding gowns, and embroidery, and seeks to strengthen its reputation for hand embroidery, establishing itself as the Embroidery Capital of the Philippines.

The festival includes a street dancing competition featuring schoolchildren in bright, colorful costumes inspired by the barong Tagalog and embellished with embroidery designs. The dancers start at the multi-purpose covered hall in front of the municipal building, proceed in front of the church, through the narrow streets, and end at the entrance of Barangay Wawa with a showdown. Imposing tambors and bastidors serve as props. Their choreography has earned them a prize at the Anilag Festival, Laguna&#x27;s “festival of festivals.&quot;

<text>The City Bank of Montreal (known in French as &quot;La Banque de la Cité&quot;) was an early bank founded in Montreal in 1833, when it was part of Lower Canada. It was founded as a counterpart to the Bank of Montreal, whose politically conservative directors made it difficult for leading liberals to do business in the province. During its existence, it issued a number of tokens for use in trade, and is known for producing many varieties of the Bouquet sou, and for co-issuing the Habitant token along with the other leading banks of Montreal in the late 1830s. It also issued paper money.

It also had branches in Toronto, and in Quebec City.

City Bank merged with Royal Canadian Bank to form Consolidated Bank of Canada in 1876.

<doc id="1275514" wikidata="Q326826" url="?curid=1275514" title="Canadian Red Ensign">
<text>The Canadian Red Ensign () served as a nautical flag and civil ensign for Canada from 1892 to 1965, and later as the &quot;de facto&quot; flag of Canada before 1965. The flag is a British Red Ensign, with the Royal Union Flag in the canton, emblazoned with the shield of the coat of arms of Canada.

The Canadian Red Ensign emerged as an informal flag to represent Canada as early as the 1870s and was used at sea and on land &quot;on all public buildings throughout the provinces,&quot; prior to becoming the country&#x27;s civil ensign in 1892. The flag was adorned with the arms of the Canadian provinces until 1922, when the arms of Canada replaced the amalgamation of provincial arms on the ensign. During the Second World War, the ensign saw use as symbol that represented Canada&#x27;s armed forces. In 1945, an order in council named the Canadian Red Ensign a &quot;distinctive Canadian flag&quot; to fly on government buildings. However, the ensign was never formally adopted as a national flag of Canada, with the Union Flag used in that role until the Maple Leaf flag was adopted in 1965. The Maple Leaf flag replaced the Canadian Red Ensign as the civil ensign of the country when it became Canada&#x27;s first official national flag.

==Description==
The ensign is the Red Ensign of the United Kingdom, embellished with the Arms of Canada as a shield in the bottom right quarter. The shield is divided into four quarters, consisting of the coats of arms of England, Scotland, Ireland and the Kingdom of France, the four founding nations of Canada. The first three quarters are the same as the Arms of the United Kingdom. At the base is a sprig of three maple leaves representing Canada. The leaves are described as &quot;proper&quot;, that is, the natural colour; it uses red and gold, the colour of the leaves in autumn. An earlier version of the Arms of Canada and the Canadian Red Ensign, used from 1922 to 1957, was coloured green.

==History==

The Red Ensign bearing some sort of a Canadian emblem was used by Canadians both on land and at sea beginning as early as 1868 (soon after Confederation) on an informal or extra-legal basis. As Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald &quot;constantly made use of it&quot;, promoting it throughout Canada &quot;by precept and example.&quot; An 1891 memo from the Governor General, Lord Stanley, stated: &quot;the Dominion Government has encouraged by precept and example the use on all public buildings throughout the provinces of the Red Ensign with the Canadian badge on the &#x27;Fly.&#x27;&quot; In 1892, it was authorized by Admiralty Warrant for use on ships registered in Canada and this was enshrined in the &quot;Canada Shipping Act&quot; of 1934, yet the flag had no legal status on land (the Royal Union Flag remained the formal national flag of Canada until 1965). Despite its lack of any official status on land, the Red Ensign with Canadian arms was widely used on land, and flew over the Parliament Buildings until 1904 when it was replaced by the Union Flag. Various versions of the Red Ensign continued to be flown on land and the flag featured prominently in patriotic displays and recruiting efforts during the First World War. It can be seen in numerous photographs of Canadian troops, on the prime minister&#x27;s car, and in victory parades.

The original Canadian Red Ensign had the arms of the four founding provinces on its shield. However, in the late 19th and early 20th century, flag manufacturers would often supplement this design with wreaths of laurel and oak leaves and crowns. The design was frequently placed on a white background square, circle or roughly following the outline of the arms in the flag&#x27;s fly (right hand side assuming the flagpole to be on the left). There was no standard design for the Red Ensign until the early 1920s. In 1921, the Government of Canada asked King George V to order a new coat of arms for Canada. The College of Arms thus designed a suitable coat of arms of Canada. The new shield was formally adopted on the Canadian Red Ensign through order-in-council on 26 April 1922. In 1924, the Red Ensign was approved for use on Canadian government buildings outside Canada. The Canadian Red Ensign, through history, tradition and custom was finally formalized on 5 September 1945, when the Governor General of Canada signed an Order-in-Council (P.C. 5888) which stated that &quot;The Red Ensign with the Shield of the Coat of arms in the fly (to be referred to as &quot;The Canadian Red Ensign&quot;) may be flown from buildings owned or occupied by the Canadian federal Government within or without Canada shall be appropriate to fly as a distinctive Canadian flag.&quot; The flag was thus approved for use by government buildings inside Canada as well, and once again flew over Parliament.

The Red Ensign served as the country&#x27;s civil ensign from 1892 to 1965 when it was replaced by today&#x27;s Maple Leaf flag. The flag bore various forms of the shield from the Canadian coat of arms in its fly during the period of its use. From 1922 until 1957, the Canadian Red Ensign was virtually the same, except that the leaves in the coat of arms were green, and there was a slight alteration to the Irish harp (the earlier version having a woman&#x27;s bust as part of the harp). A blue ensign, also bearing the shield of the Canadian coat of arms, was the jack flown by the Royal Canadian Navy and the ensign of other ships owned by the Canadian government until 1965. From 1865 until Canadian Confederation in 1867, the United Province of Canada could also have used a blue ensign, but there is little evidence such a flag was ever used. In Otto Reinhold Jacobi&#x27;s painting of the new Parliament Buildings in 1866, a Red Ensign flies from the tower of the East Block.

In 2007, the Canadian Red Ensign was formally recognized as a &quot;national symbol of Canada,&quot; by the Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada.

===Vimy Ridge Red Ensign===
The Red Ensign carried by the 5th Canadian Infantry Battalion (Western Cavalry) at the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917 survives to this day, and is possibly the oldest Canadian flag in existence. The battle was the first time all four divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force fought together during the First World War, and is viewed as a pivotal event in the history of Canadian national identity.

The Red Ensign flown at Vimy Ridge in 1917 had the arms of Canada&#x27;s first four provinces. In the Royal Warrant of 1868 assigning arms to the first four provinces of Canada, Queen Victoria authorized them to be quartered for use on the Great Seal of Canada and thus &quot; de facto&quot; they became the arms for Canada until 1921. After the battle, the flag was donated to the Imperial War Museum in the United Kingdom by Lieutenant-Colonel Lorn Paulet Owen Tudor of the 5th Battalion, an Englishman who had emigrated to Canada before the war.

The Imperial War Museum refused requests over the years to repatriate the Vimy Ridge Red Ensign to Canada, including a request in 2000 to acquire the flag for the ceremonies surrounding the dedication of Canada&#x27;s Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. David Penn, Keeper of Exhibits and Firearms at the Imperial War Museum, called the flag &quot;our most important First World War Commonwealth artifact&quot;. Eventually, after months of negotiations involving the Royal Canadian Legion, the Imperial War Museum agreed to lend the flag to Canada to commemorate the opening of the new Canadian War Museum in Ottawa in 2005. The flag was returned to the United Kingdom in 2008.

There is another Red Ensign in existence that was reportedly carried by Canadian troops at the Battle of Vimy Ridge, currently held by the Penticton Museum and Archives in Penticton, British Columbia. It is a simple red ensign, without a coat of arms.

==Usage today==

Though much less common than either the Maple Leaf or modern provincial flags, the several versions of the Canadian Red Ensign continue to be flown today both in official and unofficial capacities. In view of its association with the Canadian Army during the world wars, it is flown alongside the Maple Leaf flag at numerous war memorials, including the Canadian National Vimy Memorial in France. It is also used by veterans&#x27; groups, and is part of the official colour party (together with the Maple Leaf) of the Royal Canadian Legion. The flag is sometimes flown on vintage ships, and at heritage sites where it is historically accurate.

In the 2010s, some far right, white nationalist or white supremacist groups co-opted the red ensign, displaying it either alongside or instead of the Maple Leaf as a symbol of a monoculturally white Canada. These include the Aryan Guard, the founder of the Canadian Nazi Party, white nationalist leader Paul Fromm, and the five members of the Proud Boys who disrupted an indigenous protest on Canada Day in July 2017.

The flag&#x27;s appropriation by white supremacists has produced an outcry from several groups, including the Royal Canadian Legion, the Canadian Centre for the Great War, and the editor of the history journal &quot;The Dorchester Review&quot;, who have expressed the view that &quot;trivializing, or treating as a kind of talisman of defiance, a flag that has a much more venerable and mainstream role&quot; is not right and &quot;flies in the face of what the Red Ensign means&quot;.

==Variations==
Before the adoption of the new arms of Canada in 1921, flag makers made the badge larger each time a new province joined Confederation. This led to the creation of several unofficial but widely used variants of the Canadian Red Ensign.

At the opening ceremony of the 1936 Olympic Games, a variant of the 1922–1957 red ensign with the arms inside a white disc was carried by Canadian Olympian and flag bearer James Worrall. However, the normal version of the red ensign without the disc was hoisted alongside the other national flags that surrounded the perimeter of the stadium.

Some of the variations are shown below.

===Provincial===

Today, two Canadian provincial flags are Red Ensigns, the flag of Ontario and the flag of Manitoba. In 1965, after the Great Flag Debate in Parliament and throughout the country as a whole, the Maple Leaf flag was adopted. The Red Ensign, however, retained broad sympathy including amongst many who desired a distinct national flag for Canada. Ontario and Manitoba subsequently adopted their provincial flags in 1965 and 1966 respectively.

==Canadian Blue Ensign==
The Canadian Blue Ensign is similar to the Red Ensign. The flag was used as the jack of the Royal Canadian Navy from its inception until the adoption of the Maple Leaf flag in 1965. The Blue Ensign was approved by the British Admiralty in 1868 for use by ships owned by the Canadian government. Carr&#x27;s &quot;Flags of the World&quot; says &quot;The Blue Ensign is charged with the shield in the fly&quot;, and that the Blue Ensign &quot;is worn &#x27;as a Jack&#x27; for distinguishing purposes when at anchor, or under way and dressed with masthead flags&quot;.

In 1937, the Canadian Government established that the Canadian Blue Ensign (&quot;the Blue Ensign of the Dominion of Canada&quot;) would be used as a special ensign by the several Canadian yacht clubs which had prior to then used the British Blue Ensign (either plain or defaced) as their special ensign. This usage lasted until the 1965 introduction of the Maple Leaf flag. Today, some Canadian yacht clubs use the Canadian Blue Ensign to commemorate this usage.

==In art and culture==
Otto Reinhold Jacobi included a red ensign flying from the East Block in his 1866 painting of the Parliament Buildings.

During the early 1990s an urban myth developed claiming that the US flag was printed on the 1986 series of Canadian banknotes. The myth stated that the US flag could be seen flown on the Parliament buildings depicted behind Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier on the $5 banknote, Sir John A. Macdonald on the $10 note and William Lyon Mackenzie King on the $50 note. This flag was in fact the Canadian Red Ensign, which was contemporaneous with the three prime ministers, but in such a small size that it could be confused with the US flag.

<doc id="1275515" wikidata="Q7191509" url="?curid=1275515" title="Piedmont Geriatric Hospital">
<text>Piedmont Geriatric Hospital is a geriatric hospital located in the state of Virginia. It is Virginia&#x27;s only state facility solely dedicated to the evaluation and treatment of persons over the age of 65 . The 123-bed geriatric hospital is located in Burkeville on the site of the former Piedmont Sanatorium. Founded in 1967, the facility employs 320 staff members and is a training site for major universities, colleges, and vocational schools in geropsychiatry and other clinical specialties.

==History==
The 300 acre site of PGH was originally Piedmont Sanatorium, a rest home for African Americans with tuberculosis. The Sanatorium was closed in 1965 and converted into a geriatric hospital in 1967. In 1985, PGH was accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.

In 1999, word leaked out that PGH was slated to be closed under the 1999-2000 budget of Governor George Allen. The Legislature voted to keep PGH open with funding allocated through 2000.

On November 25, 2000, the Richmond Times-Dispatch cited an administration leak that PGH would be closed by 2006. State Senator Frank Ruff speculated that the information was leaked on purpose in order to gauge the public&#x27;s reaction . Local officials and the Piedmont Geriatric Association organized to oppose the closure, and the Legislature funded PGH for 2000.

In 2002, Governor Mark R. Warner proposed budget amendments to shut down PGH and Delegate Robert McDonnell introduced House Bill 995 to close Piedmont by 2007 . Nottoway Supervisor Jack Green called it the facility&#x27;s most serious closure threat to date. He noted the state&#x27;s desire to save money and the attractiveness of the hospital&#x27;s 300 acre estate for other building projects. The bill passed after it was amended to eliminate the provision to &quot;close Piedmont Geriatric Hospital, opened in 1967 and located in Burkeville, no earlier than July 1, 2007&quot;.

In 2004, the state Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse proposed building a facility to house 150 of Virginia&#x27;s most dangerous sex offenders on PGH grounds. The facility would be self-contained and not occupy the same buildings as PGH. Reasons for selecting the Burkeville site included its proximity to Nottoway Correctional Center, which could provide backup security help, and the nearby temporary sex offenders unit in Dinwiddie, whose workers could easily transition to the new facility.

The offenders in question fall under the control of the DMHMRS, rather than the prison system, because they have completed their prison sentences but still meet the criteria for civil commitment as sexually violent predators .

==Residents==
PGH treats elderly persons (65+ years of age) who:
*Are in need of inpatient treatment for mental illness,
*Meet the requirements for voluntary or involuntary admission as determined by their mental health center, and
*Do not have a medical condition that requires priority treatment in an acute care hospital.

According to PGH&#x27;s facility profile, &quot;80-90% of PGH&#x27;s admissions come from a complex combination of psychiatric and physical impairments whose needs are not met in traditional medical or psychiatric settings&quot;. Many hospital residents are transferred there because of complex behavior that nursing homes are not equipped to manage . Under Virginia law, patients must be transferred out of nursing homes if they :
* Present an imminent physical threat or danger to self or others,
* Require continuous licensed nursing care (seven-days-a-week, 24-hours-a-day), or
* Have other medical and functional care needs of residents that cannot properly be met in an assisted living facility.

==Services==
===Music therapy===
Music therapy part of the Psychosocial-Rehabilitation Department.

Music therapy is the prescribed use of music and musical interventions in order to restore, maintain, and improve emotional, physical, physiological, and spiritual health and well-being. Music therapy works towards specific therapeutic goals and objectives. Goal areas include communicative, academic, motor, emotional, and social skills. It is important to be aware that while clients may develop their musical skills during treatment, these skills are not the primary concern of the therapist. Rather it is the effect such musical development might have on the client&#x27;s physical, psychological and socio-economical functioning.

The credential Music Therapist - Board Certified (MT-BC) is granted by the Certification Board for Music Therapists (CBMT) to identify music therapists who have demonstrated the knowledge, skills and abilities necessary to practice music therapy at the current level of the profession. The purpose of board certification in music therapy is to provide an objective national standard that can be used as a measure of professionalism by interested agencies, groups, and individuals.

===Psychology===
The PGH Psychology Department provides evaluations and nonpharmacological interventions for all PGH patients. Evaluations provided include neurocognitive, emotional, personality, decision-making capacity, and forensic evaluations. Interventions include, among others, individual psychotherapy, group therapy, psychoeducational sessions, and behavior planning. PGH Psychologists are also active in hospital administration, program evaluation, performance improvement, and risk management activities. Hospital research efforts are also overseen by the Psychology Department.

The Psychology Department utilizes the most current techniques available in current research literature. Department staff serve as leaders within and outside of the hospital regarding current knowledge in mental health and behavioral research, and have developed many innovative protocols and methods to optimally serve their clientele. Psychology is also involved in clinical teaching, serving as a practicum site for local doctoral and masters level programs and offering frequent seminars for community eldercare providers through Piedmont Geriatric Institute.

PGH Psychology consists of four licensed clinical psychologists, one resident in clinical psychology, and an administrative assistant.

==Organization==
===Units===
PGH&#x27;s 123 residents are divided into four units of approximately 30 residents each. The staff for each unit consists of Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses, and Direct Service Associates.

===Shifts===
The staff are organized into day, evening, and night shifts. During the day shift, members of the physical, recreational, occupational, Psychology, and Music Therapy staff, as well as social workers and the Chaplain visit each unit. During the evening and night shifts, unit nursing coordinators and the house-nursing supervisor make rounds.

===Inspectors===
The facility is inspected routinely by the Office of the Inspector General. Unannounced reviews conducted between 1999 and 2004 consistently reported clean, comfortable, and well-maintained surroundings.

<text>Anagarika Govinda (born Ernst Lothar Hoffmann, 17 May 1898 – 14 January 1985) was the founder of the order of the Arya Maitreya Mandala and an expositor of Tibetan Buddhism, Abhidharma, and Buddhist meditation as well as other aspects of Buddhism. He was also a painter and poet.

== Life in Europe ==
Ernst Lothar Hoffmann was born in Waldheim, Germany, the son of a German father and a Bolivian mother. His father was quite well to do and owned a cigar factory. His mother died when he was three years old. While enrolled in the German army during World War I, he caught tuberculosis in Italy and was discharged. He recovered at a sanatorium and then studied philosophy, psychology and archaeology at Freiburg University. He did not finish his studies, but went to live in a German art colony on Capri in Italy, as a painter and poet. He studied at the Universities of Naples and Cagliari and made archeological research journeys in North Africa. He lived on Capri from 1920 until 1928. During his time in Italy Hoffman became familiar with the work of German life-philosopher Ludwig Klages whose biocentric metaphysics greatly fascinated him and influenced his approach to and understanding of Buddhism. 
Already at the age of 16 he started to study philosophy and by way of Schopenhauer he encountered Buddhism. After having made a comparative study of the major religions, he became a convinced Buddhist at the age of 18. He joined the &quot;Bund für buddhistisches Leben&quot; (Association for Buddhist Living). On Capri he practiced meditation with an American Buddhist friend.

In December 1928, Hoffman moved from Capri to Sri Lanka and stayed as a celibate Buddhist layman (&quot;brahmacāri&quot;), and later as a celibate, homeless layman (&quot;anagarika&quot;), for nine weeks at the Island Hermitage with Nyanatiloka Thera, a teacher and scholar in the Theravada tradition. He was instrumental in founding the International Buddhist Union (IBU) in 1929, of which he made Nyanatiloka the president. The aim of the IBU was to unite all Buddhists worldwide and to promote Buddhism through the virtuous and exemplary conduct of practising Buddhists. As secretary of the IBU, he travelled to Burma and Europe to raise support. Although he came to Sri Lanka with the aim of becoming a Buddhist monk, he was discouraged to do so by Anagarika Dharmapala on the grounds that it would be difficult to travel as a Buddhist monk. In 1930 he founded the Variyagoda Hermitage in a tea-estate in the mountains near Gampola, but he only lived there for one year with his German stepmother Anne Habermann who had come with him from Europe. At Variyagoda Govinda studied Abhidhamma and Pali.

==Life and travels in India and Tibet before WWII==
In April 1931 Govinda went to All-India Buddhist Conference in Darjeeling as the representative of the IBU, to propagate the &quot;pure Buddhist teaching as preserved in Ceylon, in a country where it had degenerated into a system of demon worship and fantastic forms of belief.&quot; However, in nearby Sikkim he met the Tibetan Gelugpa meditation teacher Tomo Geshe Rimpoche alias Lama Ngawang Kalzang (1866–1936), who greatly impressed him and completely changed his views about Tibetan Buddhism. From then on he embraced Tibetan Buddhism, although he never abandoned his Theravada roots and stayed in contact with Nyanatiloka and later with Nyanaponika. Lama Ngawang Kalzang taught meditation to Govinda, who remained in contact with him until his death. During their 1947–1948 expeditions to Tibet, Govinda and Li Gotami met Ajo Repa Rinpoche, who, according to Govinda, initiated them into the Kagyüpa school of Tibetan Buddhism.

The scholar Donald Lopez questions whether the &#x27;initiations&#x27; that Govinda received are to be understood in the traditional Tibetan way of the term, i.e., as an empowerment by a Lama to carry out Tantric rituals or meditations. When he first met Lama Ngawang Kalzang, Govinda spoke no Tibetan and his description of the initiation is vague. According to Lopez, no initiation into the Kagyu order or any other Tibetan order exists, and it is unclear what was the nature of the initiation ceremony and the teachings that Govinda and his wife received from Ajo Repa Rinpoche. Govinda himself wrote in &quot;Foundations of Tibetan Mysticism&quot; that he understood &#x27;initiates&#x27; to mean &#x27;individuals who, in virtue of their own sensitiveness, respond to the subtle vibrations of symbols which are presented to them either by tradition or intuition.&#x27; And in &quot;The Way of White Clouds&quot;, he wrote: &quot;A real Guru&#x27;s initiation is beyond the divisions of sects and creeds: it is the awakening to our own inner reality which, once glimpsed, determines our further course of development and our actions in life without the enforcement of outer rules.&quot;
Govinda stayed on in India, teaching German and French at Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s Visva-Bharati University in Santinekan. He lost interest in the IBU, which caused it to collapse. In 1932 Govinda briefly visited Tibet from Sikkim (visiting Mount Kailash), and in 1933 from Ladakh. The summer months of 1932 and 1934 he and his stepmother, who had followed him to India, stayed at his hermitage at Variyagoda, where a German Buddhist nun, Uppalavaṇṇā (Else Buchholz), and a German monk, Vappo, were then also living. Uppalavaṇṇā acquired the property from Govinda in 1945 and stayed there until the 1970s. In a letter dated 1.9.1934 Govinda wrote that he had come to Sri Lanka accompanied by Rabindranath Tagore and had given a series of lectures on Tibetan Buddhism in various places in Sri Lanka, trying to raise support for the planned Buddhist university at Sarnath. The reception in Sri Lanka was poor and Govinda, who had run out of funds, was quite disappointed.

On orders of Tomo Geshe Rimpoche Govinda founded his order, The Buddhist Order Arya Maitreya Mandala, on 14.10.1933. Fourteen people were then ordained. Govinda received the name Anangavajra Khamsung Wangchuk. In 1934, in Calcutta, he had the first exhibition of his paintings. From 1935 to 1945 he was the general secretary of the International Buddhist University Association (IBUA), for which he held lectures on Buddhist philosophy, history, archeology, etc., at the Buddhist academy at Sarnath. In 1936 he got a teaching position at the University of Patna, from where he gave guest lectures at the universities of Allahabad, Lucknow and Benares. His lectures on Buddhist psychology at the University of Patna were published in 1939 as &quot;The Psychological Attitude of Early Buddhist Philosophy&quot;, and his lectures at Shantinekan as &quot;Psycho-Cosmic Symbolism of the Buddhist Stupa&quot; in 1940. In 1938, after two failed attempts and on recommendation of the prime minister of Uttar Pradesh, he managed to become a full British citizen. In 1947 he became a citizen of India. From 1937 to 1940 he lived with his stepmother in a house in Darjeeling.

==World War II==
Although Govinda was now a British citizen, he was nevertheless interned by the British during WWII due to his associations with &quot;persons of anti-British sympathies,&quot; i.e. the Nehru family. First he was interned at Ahmednagar. Because he made no secret of being against Fascism, the Nazis in the prison camp bullied him, just as they did with other anti-fascists. This bullying compelled the British to open a special camp for anti-fascists at Dehra Dun, where he was transferred to in 1942. Nyanatiloka and other German Buddhist monks from Sri Lanka were also interned at Dehra Dun. In the camp Govinda stayed with the German monk Nyanaponika Thera, with whom he studied languages, and formed a close friendship that lasted till the end of his life.

==Life in Kasar Devi after WWII and travels to Tibet==

In 1947 he married the Parsi artist Li Gotami (original name Ratti Petit, 22 April 1906 - 18 August 1988) from Bombay, who, as a painter, had been his student at Santinekan in 1934. Govinda and Li Gotami wore Tibetan styles robes and were initiates in the Drugpa Kagyu lineage. The couple lived in a house rented from the writer Walter Evans-Wentz at Kasar Devi, near Almora in northern India. Kasar Devi, in hippie circles known as &#x27;Crank&#x27;s Ridge&#x27;, was a bohemian colony home to artists, writers and spiritual seekers such as Earl Brewster, Alfred Sorensen and John Blofeld. Many spiritual seekers, including the Beat Poets Allen Ginsberg and Gary Snyder, the LSD Gurus Timothy Leary and Ralph Metzner, the psychiatrist R. D. Laing, and Tibetologist Robert Thurman came to visit Govinda at his ashram. The number of visitors became so great that the couple eventually put signs to keep unwanted visitors away.

From Kasar Devi, Govinda and Li Gotami undertook journeys to Tibet in the late 1940s, making a large number of paintings, drawings and photographs. These travels are described in Govinda&#x27;s book &quot;The Way of the White Clouds&quot;. While on the expedition to Tsaparang and Tholing in Western Tibet in 1948–49, sponsored by the &quot;Illustrated Weekly of India&quot;, Govinda received initiations in the Nyingma and Sakyapa lineages. Pictures of the Tsaparang frescoes taken by Li Gotami, then, before the Cultural Revolution, still intact appear in Govinda&#x27;s &quot;The Way of the White Clouds&quot; &quot;Foundations of Tibetan Mysticism&quot; and &quot;Tibet in Pictures&quot; (co-authored with Li Gotami).
In &quot;The Way of the White Clouds&quot; Govinda writes that he was a reincarnation of the poet Novalis.

==1960s and 1970s world tours==

The German Hans-Ulrich Rieker, who was ordained in the Arya Maitreya Mandala Order in 1952, was ordered by Govinda to set up a Western wing of the Order. The founding took place simultaneously in Berlin by Rieker, and in Sanchi by Govinda, on 30.11.1952. In 1960 Govinda went to Europe as a representative of Tibetan Buddhism at an international religious conference in Venice. Subsequently, he went to England, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and the Netherlands. In 1965 he went on a lecturing tour through Germany, France, and Switzerland. In 1968-69 through the US and Japan. In 1972–73, and 1974-76 he went on world tours. In 1977 he last visited Germany.

On his journeys to the West Govinda made friends with the Swiss philosopher Jean Gebser, the Zen and Taoist teacher Alan Watts, the pioneer of transcendental psychotherapy Roberto Assagioli and the author Luise Rinser.
==Later years==
For health reasons Govinda finally settled in the San Francisco Bay area, where he and his wife were taken care of by Alan Watts and Suzuki Roshi&#x27;s San Francisco Zen Centre. In San Francisco he established a branch of his order, called &quot;Home of Dhyan&quot;. In 1980 he visited India for a last time and gave up his house in Almora. He remained mentally agile despite suffering from several strokes from 1975 onwards. During an evening discussion on 14.1.1985, he suddenly felt a sharp pain in his neck that traveled downwards. He lay down on his right side and died laughing.

His ashes were placed in the Nirvana-Stupa, which was erected in 1997 on the premises of Samten Choeling Monastery popularly known as Ghum Monastery in Darjeeling.

==Writings==
Govinda wrote several books on a wide variety of Buddhist topics. His most well known books are &quot;The Way of the White Clouds&quot; and &quot;Foundations of Tibetan Mysticism&quot;, which were translated in many languages. Some of his works such as &quot;Foundations of Tibetan Mysticism&quot; were written in German and were subsequently translated to English. His articles were published in many Buddhist journals such as the &quot;Maha Bodhi&quot;, and the German journal &quot;Der Kreis&quot; published by his Buddhist Order Arya Maitreya Mandala. 
Govinda considered &quot;The Inner Structure of the I Ching, the Book of Transformation&quot; as his most important book.

<text>With the Klondike Gold Rush, a number of folk songs from Yukon became popular, including &quot;Rush to the Klondike&quot; (1897, written by W. T. Diefenbaker), &quot;The Klondike Gold Rush&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got the Klondike Fever&quot; (1898) and &quot;La Chanson du Klondyke&quot;.

Yukon has a very active and live music scene, with a relatively large number of artists as well as a number of music festivals. Guitarist, vocalist and songwriter Jerry Alfred won the Juno Award for Best Aboriginal Recording in 1995, while Matthew Lien has topped the charts in Taiwan.

The major festivals include the Dawson City Music Festival, Frostbite Music Festival in Whitehorse, and the Atlin Arts &amp; Music Festival held in Atlin, though located just outside Yukon, is mostly attended by Yukoners, since 2003. The Alsek Music Festival in Haines Junction was held for 16 years but has skipped 2009 and 2010.

<doc id="1275522" wikidata="Q2356361" url="?curid=1275522" title="No Deals, Mr. Bond">
<text>No Deals, Mr. Bond, first published in 1987, was the sixth novel by John Gardner featuring Ian Fleming&#x27;s secret agent, James Bond. Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape and in the United States by Putnam. It was the last Bond novel to be published in Britain by Jonathan Cape, ending an association dating back to the first Bond novel, &quot;Casino Royale&quot; in 1953.

&quot;No Deals, Mr. Bond&quot; has the minor distinction of being the first and, thus far, only non-novelisation James Bond novel to incorporate the agent&#x27;s name into the title.

==Plot summary==
&quot;No Deals, Mr. Bond&quot; begins with a mission in the Baltic Sea dubbed &quot;Seahawk&quot;, which involves James Bond stealthily extracting two women that have completed an assignment in East Germany.

After accomplishing his mission, the book continues five years later with Bond being called in by M to learn more background into what those women were doing there before being extracted. Their mission, dubbed &quot;Cream Cake&quot;, was a honey trap that involved getting close to top Soviet personnel as a means to not only spy for the British Secret Service, but to secure the defection of two high ranking Soviet officers, an act that the Soviets occasionally performed against countries of the West. 

Involving four women and a man, the operation was considered a complete debacle that ended with the members being found out. After being extracted and given new identities, however, two of the women were discovered to have been gruesomely murdered - with their tongues cut out. Bond is subsequently sent by M, &quot;off the record&quot;, to find the remaining members of &quot;Cream Cake&quot; before they suffer the same fate.

Bond goes to the first, Heather Dare, who owns a beauty salon in London. They are ambushed, but Bond manages to overpower the perpetrator. He and Dare escape, but soon receive the news that a third of the moles, Ebbie Heritage, Dare&#x27;s friend, has also been murdered in Dublin.

When Bond and Dare make it to Dublin, Bond makes contact with a police officer, Murray, to get information about the murder. It turns out that Heritage lent his raincoat to another woman and that it is the other woman who was murdered.

In addition, Murray has learned that Maxim Smolin, the GRU man Dare was supposed to seduce, is now in Ireland and has managed to shake off the guard - and there are also rumors that someone even higher up in the Russian hierarchy is there. The presence of Smolin, who also worked for SMERSH, Bond&#x27;s old enemy, makes Bond suspect that the entire Cream Cake operation has been exposed, right from the start.

On the way, Bond and Dare see Smolin and try to get away again, but are captured by Smolin. Bond tries to trick Smolin, who doesn&#x27;t buy into it, and takes the pair to the GRU&#x27;s castle, where Heritage is also located. Smolin begins a torture session, but when he is left alone with Bond, he reveals that he is actually a double agent. Also, he is helping Susanne Dietrich, a captain of HVA, who was in turn lured by Jungle Baisley, the only male agent of the operation.

He proves it to Bond, but is in turn ambushed by the other guards. Together, Bond and Smolin manage to defeat the guards, take Dare and Heritage with them and escape the castle, just as Smolin&#x27;s superior, Kolya Chernov, arrives.

They take in their respective hotels: Bond and Heritage, respectively Smolin and Dare. In the middle of the night, Bond tries to contact Smolin, who, however, has checked out of the hotel. He tries to save Heritage, but she is gone. Soon after, Bond is captured by Chernov and must be returned to the castle. At the last second, however, he is rescued from Chernov&#x27;s car by Murray.

Murray has been ordered to drive Bond out of the country and take him to a plane that will take him to Paris. Waiting in the plane is Heritage, who managed to hide when Chernov&#x27;s men appeared.

Having managed to wiretap the castle, Bond has learned that the last mole, &quot;Jungle&quot; Baisley, is in Hong Kong with Susanne Dietrich. Additionally, in Paris, Bond is given extra equipment by MI6&#x27;s Q department before Bond takes the Heritage to Hong Kong. Once there, Bond meets his contact Big Thumb Chang, who supplies him with weapons, and Swift, who planned the entire Cream Cake operation. Swift tells him that M has ordered Bond to capture Chernov.

Bond takes Heritage to the island of Cheung Chau, where Chernov and his men manage to capture them. Bond still wonders which of the moles or the others who know Cream Cake are the traitors, but Chernov won&#x27;t let him find out. The Colonel uses Bond as prey on a hunting trip in the night. Bond manages to kill the pursuers and return to base where he discovers that Murray and Heather have worked to ensure that everyone,
who has had anything to do with the Cream Cake, is handed over to SMERSH and eliminated. Bond kills Heather and Murray and forces Chernov to free Ebbie, Jungle, Susanne and Smolin.

==Characters==
* James Bond
* M
* Ebbie Heritage: Her real name is Emilie Nikolas and she was a member of operation &quot;Cream Cake&quot; and was one of the two women that were extracted by Bond during &quot;Seahawk&quot;. Ebbie was tasked with meeting and seducing a Major in the East German Army.
* Colonel Maxim Smolin: Born in 1946, Smolin, codenamed &quot;Basilisk&quot;, was the prime target during the operation known as &quot;Cream Cake&quot;.

<text>Ontario Bank was an early bank operating in Ontario, Canada. It began operations in 1857 and was last listed as a member of the Canadian Bankers Association in 1901.

The bank was founded in Bowmanville, Ontario by John Simpson, a local resident and a former bank manager for the town&#x27;s Bank of Montreal branch. Simpson later became one of Canada&#x27;s first senators.

Simpson opened the bank&#x27;s first branch in Bowmanville in 1857. In 1861 the impressive Toronto branch was built and by 1868 a limestone and brick head office building had been built in Bowmanville. In 1875, the head office was moved to Toronto.

The bank and its 30 branches across the province were absorbed into the Bank of Montreal in the fall of 1906, after its general manager Charles McGill was found to have been speculating in the U.S. stock markets with bank funds and sustained an estimated $1.25 million in losses from ill-timed short sales. McGill was convicted of filing false tax returns and sentenced to a five-year prison term early in 1907.

<doc id="1275540" wikidata="Q231748" url="?curid=1275540" title="Laghouat Province">
<text>Laghouat () is one of the fifty-eight provinces (&quot;wilaya&quot;) of Algeria. It is located in the north central part of Algeria. The province borders Tiaret Province to the north, El Bayadh Province to the west, Ghardaia Province to the south and Djelfa Province to the east. The capital of the province is Laghouat City. The province is famous for palm trees and livestock.

The province is a large producer of natural gas, containing important drilling sites in the region of Hassi R&#x27;Mel. Large reserves of natural gas have allowed Algeria to occupy an important position in the global energy market.

With exports exceeding the barrier of 20 billion dollars annually and a contribution to the gross gross product of the State of Algeria by nearly 50 billion dollars., The province of Laghouat is among the most important states of Algeria contributing to the country&#x27;s economy. Most of this income comes from hydrocarbons - gas in particular - in addition to power stations And the livestock sector with more than 3 million heads of sheep. The state of Laghouat is one of the states of the Central Steppe region, which is located in the heart of the state of Algeria in northern Sahara Africa.

== Geography ==
=== Location and Nature ===
Located at an average altitude of 750 m above sea level, Laghouat Province is part of the Saharan Atlas Mountain range with some peaks rising above 2,000 m. For example, the Djebel Amour range reaches a top height of about 2,200 m.

Laghouat is nearly 400 km away from Algiers, the capital of Algeria.

The area&#x27;s orchards, buildings and mosques span across a landscape of vast steppes, mountains, and pastures. The largest tributary in the area is the Chelif River and M&#x27;zi River, which originate from the Wadi Al-Tawil mountains.

The area is characterized by its pastoral, agricultural and mountainous character. It also contains an industrial region located at Hassi R&#x27;mel. 


=== Terrain ===
The province of Laghouat is located between Hautes Plaines and the desert foothills of the Saharan Atlas mountain range. It is surrounded on the two sides by the Amour Range west of the province and the mountains of Ouled Nile to the east. The province is divided into three main geographical regions: the Saharan Atlas mountains, the Steppe Plains, and the Desert.

==== Saharan Atlas ====
The Saharan Atlas Mountain Range is located in the northwest of the province, to the north of the Djebel Amour mountains. The Saharan Atlas mountains reach heights between 1000 and 1700 meters above sea level. We can distinguish them into two sub-regions which include the High Highlands area in the north and a mountainous area in the south. The districts of Gueltet Sidi Saâd, Aflou District, Brida District, El Ghicha District and Oued Morra District are located in this region. The most important characteristic of this area is that it is the source of the most significant rivers in Algeria, including the Chelif River, the Wadi el-Taweel and the Wadi Djedi through its tributary the M&#x27;zi River. It is distinguished by the presence of the green dam forests that blend into the grassy Steppe region.

==== Steppe ====
These grassland plains are located in the center of the province and are between 700 and 1000 meters above sea level. It is known as a grazing area as it contains many steppe plants and herbs. This region includes most of the province&#x27;s vegetation, not counting the green dam forests located in the mountainous region. The Steppe region includes the districts of Sidi Makhlouf, Laghouat District, and northern Ain Madhi.

==== Desert ====
The southern part of Laghouat province is a desert plateau. This area includes the Hassi R&#x27;Mel District, the southern part of the Ksar El Hirane District and Ain Madhi District. It is distinguished by low vegetation cover characterized by Peganum plants. There are some hills here that are distinguished by various trees including the Ziziphus spina-christi and Pistacia atlantica. Various herbs and flowers are abundant here in the springtime.

==History==
The province was created from the Oasis and Tiaret departments in 1974.

In 1984 Ghardaïa Province was carved out of the territory of Laghouat.

==Administrative division==
The province is divided into 10 districts (&quot;daïras&quot;), which are further divided into 24 &quot;communes&quot; or municipalities.

=== Transportation ===
Laghouat Province contains three main roadways:

* The Trans-Saharan Road (N1): This international road links Algiers to Lagos, Nigeria in the south. It also connects the city of Laghouat with Djelfa in the north and Ghardaia in the south.
* National Road No. (23): This road connects Laghouat to Tiaret and the western port city of Mostaganem.
* National Road No. (47): Connects Aflou with El Bayadh and Aïn Séfra in the southwest.

The state has two airports, one of which is a local airport used mainly to transport pilgrims. The Laghouat Airport is officially called Moulay Ahmed Medeghri Airport and is named after the martyr Moulay Ahmed Madgari. The second airport, Hassi R&#x27;mel, is mainly used by the Sonatrach National Fuel Company to transport equipment, tires, experts, and contractors.

=== Energy ===
Laghouat Province is considered to be the second most important energy mandate in Algeria after Ouargla Province, because it contains one of the most important gas fields in Africa. This gas field is in the region of Hassi R&#x27;mel and contains many electricity production stations. These are located in the Telegmat region near Hassi R&#x27;mel and Kheneg. These areas also contain the largest solar PV plant in Algeria with a capacity of 60 MW.

==== CPV EKP solar power station ====
The CPV EKP solar power station is located 5 km from the municipality of Kheneg and 10 km from Laghouat in Algeria. 
The station sits on an area of 120 hectares and, on average, produces more than 300 MWh of electricity per day. It contains more than 240 thousand solar panels distributed over 5460 matrices, 2040 triple level junction boxes, 120 inverters, and 60 transformers. It is connected to a 60 kV high-voltage electricity transmission network by the lifting station, which contains 3 transformers with a capacity of 20 MVA each.

=== Livestock raising ===

Livestock in Laghouat province number around 4,000,000 cattle, sheep and goats. Sheep rank first in population with over 3 million heads, followed by goats, cows, camels, and horses (including mules and donkeys).

===Tourism===

The province&#x27;s most popular tourist area is the district of Kef El Melh (the mountain of salt). It is located in the municipality of Tadjrouna near the border with El Bayadh Province. The largest tourist hotspot in the district is the Kordan Palace, or Crown Angle. Other tourist areas and natural sights include the Al-Ghaisheh, Taouila, Lalmaya, Ein Sefsifah, and Al-Huwaita. Laghouat is home to the Talemzane crater, or Madna Crater, a depression resulting from the impact of an ancient meteorite. It is the second largest crater in the world (based on depression circumference) and is found in the municipality of Hassi Delaa in the south.

<doc id="1275550" wikidata="Q709057" url="?curid=1275550" title="Hook turn">
<text>A hook turn (Australian English) or two-stage turn (British English), also known as a Copenhagen Left (in reference to cyclists specifically and in countries they are ridden on the right), is a road cycling manoeuvre or a motor vehicle traffic-control mechanism in which vehicles that would normally turn from the innermost lane of an intersection instead turn from the outermost lane, across all other lanes of traffic.

Hook turns are commonly used by cyclists as a safer alternative to merging with motor vehicles, or having to cross multiple lanes of traffic to reach a turning lane.

The legal use of hook turns by motor vehicles is relatively rare, but has been implemented in some jurisdictions (notably Melbourne, Australia) to keep the centre of a road free from congestion for use by light rail transit such as trams or other dedicated road services.

==History==
Hook turns were originally the standard right turn in Australia. Various jurisdictions phased them out at different times. Sydney and Newcastle changed to centre turns in 1939. South Australia discontinued the hook turn on 30 November 1950. Victoria changed to centre turns in 1954 for all right turns except at some intersections in the Melbourne CBD, where hook turns were retained to maintain a clearway in the centre of the road for the city&#x27;s trams. Requiring vehicles to turn from the far lane, rather than the middle of the road, avoided conflicts between vehicles and trams without the need for extra traffic lanes or altered signals.

==Method==
To perform a two-stage turn, cyclists should enter the junction when given a green signal (simultaneous with motor traffic, though nearside turning traffic may be held at a red light). The farside-turning cyclist should pull into the nearside in front of the pedestrian crossing (in a marked waiting area, if available). When the side road is given a green signal, cyclists should proceed first by going straight ahead, completing their turn.

==Usage by country==
Hook turns have been implemented in a number of jurisdictions, including Australia, China, Denmark, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand,Taiwan, and the United States.

=== Australia ===
The Australian Road Rules set out the procedure for performing a hook turn in Australia, as well as other jurisdictions with left-hand traffic. In jurisdictions with right-hand traffic the lane of the turning vehicle is reversed.

# When the traffic light is green, the turning vehicle approaches and enters the intersection from as near as possible to the left. If there is insufficient room then it must wait for the next cycle of the lights.
# The vehicle moves forward, keeping clear of any marked foot crossing, until it is as near as possible to the left-most lane of the road the vehicle is entering.
# The vehicle remains at this position until the traffic lights on the road it is &quot;entering&quot; change to green.
# The vehicle then turns right into the road and continues straight ahead.

In many jurisdictions, lightweight vehicles, such as bicycles and mopeds, may make hook turns at any intersection regardless of signage. For instance, under the Australian Road Rules cyclists may legally perform a hook turn at any intersection unless otherwise signed.

=== Canada ===
Toronto and Montreal have bicycle facilities that allow cyclists to perform perimeter-style turns, as such turns are known in Canada.

=== Denmark ===
In Denmark, a hook turn is mandatory for cyclists. Denmark drives on the right and cyclists wishing to make a left turn must first proceed through the intersection to the opposite side of the perpendicular street, then make the turn from the new destination. To avoid conflicts with cars turning right, a cyclist wishing to make a left turn is - if a car lane is expressly marked as &quot;right turn only&quot; allowed to place himself on the left side of that lane.

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, hook turns are occasionally marked on roads and used by cyclists. Notably in Wellington, Such as at the Lambton Quay, Bowen st, Whitmore st intersection, near The Beehive.

=== United Kingdom ===
Two-stage turn arrangements enable cyclists to turn right (across oncoming traffic) without needing to move to the centre of the carriageway. A two-stage turn is considered acceptable in LTN 1/20, England and Northern Ireland&#x27;s cycle infrastructure design guide, and in Scotland&#x27;s Cycling by Design guidance. 

A blue (informatory) sign can be placed to advise cyclists a two-stage turn is possible, and appropriate markings in front of the nearside approach lane. Furthermore, with authorisation by national governments, signs can be added to traffic lights to ban right turns for cyclists, unless completed in two stages.

== Benefits ==
There have been limited proposals for hook turns to be implemented as a more widespread replacement for conventional intersection turns. Computer modelling has indicated that hook turns have the potential to significantly reduce delays and congestion in most situations, especially where overall traffic flow is high.

On average, a tram will save 11 to 16 seconds when going through an intersection that uses hook turns.

== Limitations ==
Two-stage turns are often considered less preferable for cyclist safety than protected junctions, as there is more cyclist-pedestrian conflict.

<text>Cheech and Chong&#x27;s Next Movie is a 1980 American comedy film directed by Tommy Chong and the second feature-length project by Cheech &amp; Chong, following &quot;Up in Smoke&quot;, released by Universal Pictures.

==Plot==
Cheech &amp; Chong are on a mission to siphon gasoline for their next door neighbor&#x27;s car, which they apparently &quot;borrowed,&quot; and continue with their day; Cheech goes to work at a movie studio and Chong searches for something to smoke (a roach), followed by him revving up an indoor motorcycle and playing extremely loud rock music with an electric guitar that disturbs the entire neighborhood. Cheech gets fired from his job for taking one of the studio vans home without permission and they go to see Donna, a welfare officer and Cheech&#x27;s off and on girlfriend. Cheech successfully seduces Donna, under her objections, and gets her in trouble (and possibly fired) with her boss. The doped-up duo are expelled from the building and, in an attempt to find alternative means of income, start writing songs like, &quot;Mexican Americans&quot; and &quot;Beaners.&quot;

Cheech answers the phone call from Donna, sets up a date, and goes to tell Chong to get lost so he can clean the house and get ready for Donna. The phone rings again with Cheech thinking it&#x27;s Donna and turns out to be Red, Cheech&#x27;s &quot;kinda&quot; cousin, with money problems and a plea for help. Cheech asks Chong to pick up his cousin and hang out with him as Cheech informs him they have similar interests like &quot;go to clubs,&quot; &quot;get plenty of chicks,&quot; and &quot;likes to get high.&quot; Chong heads off to the hotel where Red is staying and arrives to find him in a dispute with the receptionist over how much the room is costing (&quot;$37.50 a week, not a goddamned day!&quot;). The receptionist is holding his luggage, consisting of a boom-box, a suitcase, and a 20-pound canvas bag full of high-grade marijuana hostage, and Red can&#x27;t afford the bill. They break into the room around the back and Red retrieves his luggage and the receptionist is falsely arrested after calling the cops to arrest Chong and Red but accidentally assaults them and is taken away to jail.

Later, on the corner, a roller-skater invites them to a &quot;party,&quot; which is in fact a brothel. They are kicked out of the place for causing too much commotion, sharing weed with the girls, and urinating in the Jacuzzi. They then play a recording from Red&#x27;s boombox that Red recorded earlier when the police arrived at the hotel he was staying at over the dispute with his luggage, which scares everyone off. One of the girls from the brothel accompanies them and they all go onto Sunset Boulevard in search of adventure and more highness. After visiting the house of a girl&#x27;s parents, whom they found at a music store on Ventura Boulevard, they all get into the parents&#x27; Rolls-Royce, light up a spliff, and drive to a stand-up comedy club where they tell jokes and encounter the angry hotel receptionist who was falsely arrested earlier that day and begin a commotion with him and a large female bouncer leading to a rally fight. Later that night, they are chased by the cops as they check out Red&#x27;s weed fields out in the countryside. They set off fireworks and are suddenly abducted by a UFO along with several of the cannabis plants. Cheech meanwhile gets so pumped and excited about the date that he wears himself out and ends up sleeping through it, while dreaming about what might have happened. He wakes up in the morning to find Chong (who was abducted by aliens alongside Red) bursting in, dressed as what appears to be a cross between Genghis Khan and a Viking, holding a jar of &quot;space coke&quot;, which Chong says, &quot;It&#x27;ll blow your head off.&quot; The &quot;space coke&quot; causes Cheech to go berserk and starts trashing their next door neighbor&#x27;s house with a surprised Chong following after. The film ends with the duo bursting through their neighbor&#x27;s roof into outer space, achieving the ultimate high and Chong dropping the &quot;space coke&quot; back to Earth for others to try which leads to an animated sequence with Cheech and Chong ascending into a blunt which then takes off displaying the caption &quot;That&#x27;s It Man!&quot;

===Television edit===

The television edit of the film, in addition to being edited for content such as the removal of all sequences in which characters are seen smoking cannabis, contained many extended and additional scenes, and alternate dialogue, as well as a different music score.

The opening credits animated sequence was different from the theatrical cut, showing Cheech and Chong stealing their neighbor&#x27;s car, which runs out of gas. It also features a theme song which didn&#x27;t appear in the theatrical cut which removes Nick McLean’s co-credit as director of photography and replaces the theatrical’s “written by” credit for Cheech &amp; Chong with a “screenplay by” credit (for Cheech &amp; Chong) and adds a “story by” credit for Cheech &amp; Chong and Francesca Turner. After the opening credits, there is a scene which did not appear in the theatrical cut establishing that extraterrestrials have come to Earth looking for diamonds, &quot;the principal source of energy&quot; on the planet Asp (the shot of the flying saucer, whick looks different from all other exterior shots of it, flying toward the camera and the following shot of it nearing Earth’s atmosphere is footage lifted from &quot;The Thing&quot;, also a Universal movie). The usual “edited for television” caption is shown, adding that it has also been reconstructed as well. After Cheech and Chong siphon gas for their neighbor&#x27;s car, insert shots underneath the hood are seen, showing the gas leaking and then igniting into flames, rather than the explosion being caused by Chong lighting a match inside the car. Cheech and Chong are said to be running a teen center and playground, which is referenced throughout the television edit, and a sign for it is shown repeatedly as part of the filler material shot for this version. Cheech and Chong&#x27;s neighbor is shown to have a job as a piano teacher, and a lesson he is giving to a neighborhood teenager is interrupted by Chong&#x27;s guitar playing. After the prop slot machine Cheech stole from a movie set falls on the neighbor, and they lift it off him, he threatens to sue them, claiming that the prop injured his hands, which would prevent him from playing the piano as part of his job, but offers to call off the lawsuit if Cheech and Chong let him have the rare costumes Cheech stole from the movie studio. Instead of teaching Chong the phrase &quot;hey, pendejo&quot;, the line is redubbed as &quot;hey, paisano&quot;. After Cheech sends Chong to pick up Red at the hotel so Cheech can spend the evening with Donna, there is an additional scene of Cheech cleaning the house, and Chong attempts to steal the neighbor&#x27;s car again while he is working on it, but decides to hitchhike instead when he realizes that the neighbor was underneath the car. While cleaning, Cheech is interrupted by Jehovah&#x27;s witnesses, and slams the door in their face.

When he&#x27;s calling the police, the hotel receptionist&#x27;s line &quot;Look, I think they&#x27;re Iranians!&quot; was redubbed as &quot;Look, I think they&#x27;re communists!&quot; The extraterrestrials are then shown to be following Red in the hopes that he will lead them to &quot;the diamond field&quot;; after Red&#x27;s duffel bag is retrieved, a different cutaway shot is shown depicting the inside of the bag as containing diamonds, not cannabis buds. Before the music store scene, there is an additional shot of a spaceship and an additional scene featuring a street musician. The music store scene is also extended, showing more of Red playing guitar and throwing guitars to the other customers. The scene where they get into Gloria’s car still shows the store owner follow them out, complaining about the damage they caused, omitting the part where Red and Chong give the store owner armfuls of marijuana to compensate for the damage. The omission is covered by another close up of Gloria, yet the owner is still shown standing at the curb holding the marijuana as they drive off, and omits the police’s arrival and subsequent arrest of the owner. After it is revealed that &quot;Chicken Charlie&quot; is the father of Gloria, the woman Red, Chong and the prostitute hitched a ride with, when the prostitute recognizes him, there is an additional scene where the group has a dinner and uncomfortable conversation before they move into the living room, where Gloria sings the Jimmy Reed song &quot;Baby What You Want Me to Do&quot;. In the living room, instead of performing the dirty magic trick, Red instead suggests that they drive to The Comedy House. This edit removed Charlie&#x27;s wife smoking cannabis in the car. When Red performs the Mexico joke at The Comedy House, the line &quot;donkey&#x27;s balls&quot; is redubbed as &quot;donkey&#x27;s tail&quot;. When Chong gets on the stage, the sequence in which he repeats Red&#x27;s magic trick of turning a glass &quot;into a dick&quot; is removed, and there is an alternate scene in which Chong hits the large female 
wrestler on the head to no effect; she does not break the glass.

When Red and Chong are abducted by the extraterrestrials, additional dialogue is dubbed in, and there is an additional scene with Red and Chong on the space ship, where the extraterrestrials tell Red and Chong that they will teach them to &quot;fly like Peter Pan&quot; in order to retrieve diamonds for them. When Chong is back on Earth talking to Cheech at the end, the dialogue is completely redubbed, removing the references to &quot;space coke&quot;, and instead having Chong telling Cheech that the extraterrestrials taught him how to fly; we are still inexplicably shown the footage of Cheech rampaging through the wall of their house and the neighbor’s, Chong still following him carrying the beaker of space coke and the shot of Cheech blasting them through the roof (despite not being taught to fly yet). In the theatrical cut, this was a result of Cheech trying the space coke and the effect it had on him, but with the removal of the space coke references, this makes no sense. The edit ends with an extended animated sequence in which Cheech and Chong fly into space to join Red on the spaceship and an extraterrestrial superhero plays guitar before turning into a dragon, and the Cheech and Chong Teen Center and Playground sign is shown one final time before the credits roll, as we hear Red laughing and asking, &quot;ya get it?&quot;

===Home media===
A novelization was released in 1980.

The film was released on Blu-ray in 2017, containing the theatrical cut, trailer, radio spots and an interview with Cheech Marin. It did not include the television cut of the film or any deleted scenes.

===Critical reception===
Roger Ebert&#x27;s review was negative, writing: &quot;This movie is embarrassing. There&#x27;s no invention in it, no imagination, no new comic vision, no ideas about what might be really funny -- instead of just dope-funny, something to laugh at if you&#x27;re in the bag anyway.&quot; Gene Siskel gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote that it was &quot;much better&quot; than &quot;Up in Smoke&quot;, &quot;which isn&#x27;t saying that much. It&#x27;s just that its jokes come a little quicker and a few of them are funny even to the chemically unaltered viewer.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;casual, slapdash and rude, and it&#x27;s frequently hilarious in the way of some intense but harmless confrontation between eccentrics on a street corner.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a laborious disappointment in which the freshness has vanished and the laughs come few and far between.&quot;

<text>The Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences or Polish Academy of Learning (, PAU), headquartered in Kraków and founded in 1872, is one of two institutions in contemporary Poland having the nature of an academy of sciences (the other being the Polish Academy of Sciences, headquartered in Warsaw).

The Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences is co-owner of the Polish Library in Paris.

==History==
The Academy traces its origins to Academy of Learning founded in 1871, itself a result of the transformation of the , in existence since 1815. Though formally limited to the Austrian Partition, the Academy served from the beginning as a learned and cultural society for the entire Polish nation. Its activities extended beyond the boundaries of the Austrian Partition, gathering scholars from all of Poland, and many other countries as well. Some indication of how the Academy&#x27;s influence extended beyond the boundaries of the Partitions came in 1893, when the collection of the Polish Library in Paris, the largest collection of Polish materials amassed by the Great Emigration, was transferred to the ownership of the Academy, and a branch was founded in Paris, though this latter step had been preceded by the establishment of the Rome Expedition (annual trips to Roman archives).

After World War I, the Academy was renamed &quot;Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences&quot; (PAU), and became the official representative of Polish learning, which entailed its participation in works of international learned organizations. Among other things, the PAU was a founder member of the Union Académique Internationale (UAI). The period between the world wars was the time of greatest activity at the PAU, especially in the sphere of publications: over 100 publication series were then in print, among them the monumental &quot;Polish Biographical Dictionary&quot; (&quot;Polski Słownik Biograficzny&quot;). It was also in this period that the Scientific Station in Rome replaced the Rome Expedition.

The PAU was initially organized into four sections:
* Philological
* Historical-Philosophical
* Mathematical-Natural Sciences
* Medical (from 1930)

In 1942 a successor body of the Polish Academy of Learning, the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences, was established in New York City by Bronisław Malinowski, Oskar Halecki and other scholars associated with the Academy, which had been forcibly closed down by the occupying Germans. Following the collapse of communism in Poland, the Polish Academy of Learning was revived and became affiliated with the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America (as the latter had meanwhile been renamed).

After the German Occupation, the PAU continued its activities in the same fields until 1952, when the authorities decided to take over its agencies and assets on behalf of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw, which was then being established. The PAU was never formally dissolved, however, and after two unsuccessful attempts at its reactivation in the years 1956–57 and 1980–81, it was finally able to resume activities in the immediate aftermath of the transformations of 1989.

==Structure of the PAU==
At present, the Academy is organized into six distinct sections (Classes), consisting of multiple dedicated and interdisciplinary commissions and committees.

===Philology===
This section brings together scholars who represent philologies (Polish, Classical, English, Germanic, Romance, Slavic), including linguistics and literary studies (literary history and theory), as well as art historians.

The primary fruits of the section&#x27;s labors are its publications, presently consisting of three series: &quot;Papers in Philology, Library of Translations from Ancient Literature&quot; (including eight volumes published before World War II), and &quot;Old Polish Source Materials&quot;. The first series, &quot;Papers in Philology&quot;, includes several publications, such as a study by Stanisław Urbańczyk dealing with the history of linguistics in Poland, collection of essays by the Italian Slavicist Riccardo Picchio (translated into Polish) as well as the following works: by on national varieties of German language, by on the life and artistic works of Lisias, by Magdalena Sitarz on Jewish and Polish proverbs and by on the two-way Polish-Jewish influence in the field of language. There are now five more volumes in the classical translation series: two translated and edited by (Statius&#x27;s &quot;Thebaid&quot; and Lucan&#x27;s &quot;Bellum Civile&quot;), one translated and edited by Romuald Turasiewicz (Lysias&#x27;s &quot;Speeches&quot;), one translated and edited by Michał Bednarski (Apollonius Dyscolus&#x27;s &quot;Essay on Syntax&quot;) and one translated and edited by Ireneusz Ptaszek (Andocides&#x27;s &quot;Speeches&quot;). In the series of source materials from the earliest history of Poland, Kazimierz Rymut and his co-authors have published a collection entitled &quot;Polish Letters from the 16th Century&quot;, in a critical edition by Marian Plezia. Some publications written by members of Class I have appeared in the publication series of Class II, such as the Latin text of Vincent Kadłubek&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles&quot;, in a critical edition by Marian Plezia.

====Commission on Classical Philology====
The nature of the Commission&#x27;s work is to bring together representatives of various humanistic disciplines who share an interest in the study of Greco-Roman antiquity, broadly conceived, and its reception in the culture of Medieval and modern Europe. It gathers Hellenists and Latinists, specialists in history and literature, as well as linguistics (classical linguistics): Byzantinists, neo-Latinists, ancient historians, historians of ancient culture and philosophy, Patristicists, archaeologists, numismatists, specialists in ancient law (especially Roman), and scholars interested in the reception of antiquity in the culture and literature of Europe, especially Poland.

The thematic scope of the Commission&#x27;s activities covers virtually all areas of knowledge about antiquity.

The focus of scholarly attention has been on the study of:
* the grammar, syntax, semantics, and stylistics of the classical languages;
* the types and genres of Greek literature of the classical period, especially drama, historiography, and rhetoric;
* Roman literature of the Augustan Age.

The Commission publishes its Works, in which five volumes of assembled works on various topics have already appeared, as well as four monographs. The Commission is also actively engaged in the PAU series entitled &quot;Library of Translations from Ancient Literature&quot;, in which there have appeared so far editions of Statius&#x27;s &quot;Thebais&quot;, Lucan&#x27;s &quot;Bellum Civile&quot;, Lysias&#x27;s &quot;Speeches&quot; and Apollonius Dyskolos&#x27;s &quot;Essay on Syntax&quot; and Andocides&#x27;s &quot;Speeches&quot;.

The research issues presented at this Commission&#x27;s meetings involve Polish and European art, from antiquity to the most recent times. Papers read before the Commission must display both a solid methodological base and a profound exploration of the subject matter, based on a thorough review of the secondary literature. Papers are often read by scholars who do not belong to the Commission, from various universities in Poland. (Papers by invited lecturers from abroad are anticipated.) The papers presented at the Commission&#x27;s meetings have earned considerable respect among young art historians. Discussions have also been organized on the organizational framework of the Polish Committee on Art History.

====Commission on Art History====
The majority of the papers presented are published in the Commission&#x27;s scholarly yearbook, &quot;Folia Historiae Artium, series nova&quot;. Seven volumes have been published since 1995, when the new series was commenced. Volume IV was devoted to the 100th anniversary of the birth of Karolina Lanckorońska, a person of inestimable importance for Polish learning, and especially for the PAU, of which she was a member. The publication series &quot;Cracovia Artificum&quot; continues to be produced by the Commission, with source materials in the history of craftsmanship, including artistic crafts; to date three volumes have appeared, edited by Bolesław Przybyszewski.

====Commission on Modern Philology====
This Commission was formed in the autumn of 1998, but due to the illness of its founder and first chairman, Przemysław Mroczkowski, it could not begin activities until early 2000, under the leadership of Olga Dobijanka-Witczakowa.

The Commission&#x27;s meetings bring together scholars in modern philology, with the goal of achieving integration in terms of research methodology and facilitating the exchange of experiences.
The third volume of the Works of the &quot;Commission on Modern Philology&quot; has now appeared, featuring the best papers from the scholarly meetings held to date.

====Commission on Slavonic Culture PAU====
Attached to the PAU Class I (Philology), the Commission was formed in 2000. It is to some extent an interdisciplinary endeavor, including certain aspects of the field of interest of PAU Class II (History and Philosophy). Accordingly, the members of the Commission represent not only scholars in Slavonic philology, but also archaeologists, historians, and ethnographers. The Commission has published three volumes of its &quot;Works&quot;.

===History and Philosophy===
This section comprises historians, archaeologists, philosophers, lawyers, theologians, sociologists, and psychologists. The section holds monthly meetings, some of which are organized jointly with Class I.

The section is involved in studies and publications on the following topics:
* Sources for the history of the Polish Government-in-Exile: minutes of the meetings of the Council of Ministers. Eight volumes are planned; Volumes I-IV have already been published.
* History of Poland in the two decades between the world wars. A book by Janusz Pajewski on this subject has already appeared, and two more volumes are anticipated.
* The history and organization of Polish learning. This subject is treated in a broad program of publications and expositions.
* Continuation of the re-edition of Jan Długosz&#x27;s History of Poland (personal grant to Marian Plezia, now held by Jerzy Wyrozumski) – completed in 2007.
* The publication of the acts of the Apostolic Nunciature in Poland, a project which is recommended by the Academy of Arts and Sciences (four large volumes were produced between 1915 and 1952), was being continued by the Polish Historical Institute in Rome, under the direction of Karolina Lanckorońska (20 volumes appeared). The PAU joined the project and now it is its only manager and executor, but the enterprise is still financed by the Lanckoroński Foundation (three volumes have appeared).
* In keeping with tradition, the Class also publishes several series of source materials for Polish history: two volumes of &quot;Monumenta Poloniae Vaticana&quot;. A new series has been added: &quot;Monumenta Sacra Polonorum&quot; (two volumes have already appeared).

The Class has organized three scholarly symposia: one devoted to the Senate of the Republic of Poland, its historical role and its present status; the second, to the anniversary of the Soviet attack on Poland on 17 September 1939; and the third, to research on the settlement of the first agricultural peoples on both sides of the Western Carpathians in the fifth millennium BC.

The Class&#x27;s most significant publications include a book by Gerard Labuda, &quot;Mieszko I król Polski 1025–1034&quot; [Mieszko I, King of Poland, 1025–1034]; a book by Piotr Hübner, &quot;Siła przeciw rozumowi. Losy Polskiej Akademii Umiejętności 1939–1989&quot; [Force against Reason: the Fate of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1939–1989]; &quot;Protokoły posiedzeń Władz RP na Uchodźstwie 1939–1945&quot; [Minutes of the Meetings of the Authorities of the Republic of Poland in Exile, 1939–1945], Volumes I-IV; and &quot;Chrześcijaństwo Rusi Kijowskiej, Białorusi, Ukrainy i Rosji (X-XVII wiek)&quot; [Christianization of Kievan Ruthenia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia (10th–17th century)], edited by Jerzy Kłoczowski; Józef Gierowski &quot;The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 18th century&quot;. The Class cooperates with the Jagiellonian University in publishing the periodical &quot;Kwartalnik Filozoficzny&quot; [Philosophical Quarterly].

The section is also actively engaged in realizing the agreement with the Slovak Academy of Sciences, through such joint projects as coordinating archaeological research performed by the Kraków centre on both sides of the western Carpathians; studies on Polish-Slovak relations during World War II; and the preparation of a dictionary of the Oravian local dialect. Contracts are in preparation with the Slovenian Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Ukrainian Studies at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in Lviv, and the Czech Academy of Sciences.

====Commission on Central Europe====
This Commission was founded in 1991 on the initiative of , to assemble scholars interested in the archaeology, history, philology, and culture of the nations inhabiting Central and Eastern Europe. In 1993, the Commission on Eastern Europe was split off. Since that time, the Commission on Central Europe has covered the area between the Baltic and the Adriatic, and between the Elbe, Neman, and Bug rivers, as well as the lands on either side of the central Danube.

At present, the primary focus on the Commission&#x27;s research work is on national renascence; the history of state formations (including, among other things, the former Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, as well as Hungary); and the political history of regions inhabited by populations of mixed ethnic, cultural, and religious backgrounds, along with their mutual relations.

The Commission&#x27;s publication record is imposing. The effects of its work are reflected in the series &quot;Prace Komisji Środkowoeuropejskiej&quot; [Works of the Commission on Central Europe].&quot; To date twelve volumes have been published.

====Commission on Eastern Europe====
This Commission was created in 1993, when the PAU Commission on Central Europe, founded two years earlier, was divided.

The area of interest of this Commission extends to all the countries of Eastern Europe, though at the present moment, due to the research specializations of its associate members, this means primarily Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. The Commission attempts to include in its research activity the broadest possible spectrum of issues involving the culture of this region, both its past and the present day: from archaeology, through history, literature, religion, art, and languages, to political and sociological problems.

Learned symposia and conferences have been organized, including a conference on &quot;The Lemkos and Lemko Studies in Poland&quot; (June 1995), and five panel discussions. The Commission&#x27;s publications include the &quot;Works of the Commission on Eastern Europe&quot;, of which four volumes have already appeared. Individual monographs have also been published, e.g.:
* &quot;Metropolita Andrzej Szeptycki. Studia i materiały&quot; [Metropolitan Andrzej Szeptycki: Studies and Materials], edited by Andrzej A. Zięba Kraków, 1994);
* Ryszard Łużny, &quot;Słowo o Bogu i człowieku. Myśl religijna Słowian Wschodnich doby staroruskiej&quot; [A Word about God and Man: The Religious Thought of the Eastern Slavs in the Old Ruthenian Period] (Kraków, 1995);
* &quot;Łemkowie i łemkoznawstwo w Polsce&quot; [The Lemkos and Lemko Studies in Poland], edited by Andrzej A. Zięba (Kraków, 1997).

====Commission on the Prehistory of the Carpathians====
This Commission was founded in 1996. It brings together scientists interested in the history of the oldest settlements in the Carpathians: primarily archaeologists, and the paleobotanists and palaeogeographers who cooperate with them.

The current primary research projects are:
* the first farmers and herders in the Carpathians: problems of the Neolithization of the Carpathians;
* adaptation of settlement from the late Neolithic and early Bronze Age to the environmental conditions of the Carpathians: the development of pastoral societies;
* settlement processes in late prehistory and protohistory, with particular emphasis on the early Middle Ages.

The Commission&#x27;s works appear in the &quot;Works of the Commission on the Prehistory of the Carpathians&quot;, the first volume of which contains the results of joint Polish-Slovak research on the earliest Linear Pottery Culture in eastern Slovakia. The second volume deals with the archaeology and natural environment of the Low Beskids mountains in the Carpathians.

====Commission on the History and Culture of the Jews====
This Commission&#x27;s activities are focused on Jewish history and culture in Poland and Europe. It brings together scholars from various specialties who share an interest in Jewish studies. In addition to regular meetings featuring lectures and discussion, the Commission also organizes scholarly symposia. The symposium entitled &quot;Jews and Judaism in Contemporary Polish Research&quot; was an occasion of particular significance, crowned by an impressive publication of symposium materials. The series entitled &quot;Works of the Commission on the History and Culture of the Jews&quot; publishes both collection of studies and monographs, as well as the materials from symposia. At present the Commission is concentrating its interests on Jewish associations, Jewish necropolises, and Jewish art. Plans call for the Commission&#x27;s &quot;Bulletin&quot; to appear once every two years.

====Commission on Law PAU====
This Commission, reactivated in 1995, is the successor to a Commission that was an active part of the Academy prior to the year 1952. It is involved with current-day legal problems concerning the justice system (broadly understood), political reforms, the adaptation of Polish law to European norms, and the history of legal sciences in Poland. International cooperation is also being developed.

The Commission is responsible for publishing the &quot;Kwartalnik Prawa Prywatnego&quot; [Quarterly of Private Law], edited by Stefan Grzybowski, with assistance from Andrzej Mączyński. The quarterly has appeared regularly for six years, and has won recognition among specialists involved in private law. The Commission has also created a periodical publication entitled &quot;Journal of Criminal Law and Penal Sciences&quot;, which has appeared since 1997.

The Commission has regular scholarly meetings that include ample time for discussion.

====Commission on the History of Wars and Military Science====
Commission was formed in 2005 as the Commission for the Second World War History. In the beginning of 2006 changed its name to a current one: PAU Commission for War and Military History. Besides its monthly scientific sessions, the Commission support publication initiatives. So far the post-conference materials concerning the Polish Intelligence service activity during the Second World War has been published. &quot;Memoirs of general Antoni Szylling&quot; are to be issued soon; the colonel Mazaraki&#x27;s relations about the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905 and a volume of the Commission&#x27;s Works are being prepared.

====Commission on Economic Sciences====
The Commission was formed on 12 May 2004. The Commission&#x27;s first aim is to create a forum for scientific discussion for the whole academic economic community, which is nowadays dispersed and divided into separate narrow specializations. One of the means for achieving this aim is the analysis of main research trends in economic sciences (both in theory and in practice), as well as the presentation of the scholarly achievements of their representatives.

Another goal of the Commission, connected with the previous project, is a discussion on the current issues of the economy of the world, of the EU and of our country, showed against the background of scientific achievements.

====Ethnographic Commission====
===Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry===
The section awards the Marian Mięsowicz Prize for outstanding achievements in the field of physics. This prize is funded by the Kraków scientific institutes involved with physics; the first prize winner was Władysław Wolter in 1997.

====Commission on Astrophysics====
his Commission is involved with observational astronomy in the areas of optical electromagnetic radiation of radio waves, infrared, X-rays and gamma rays, detection of loaded particles, and the astronomy of neutrinos. The Commission&#x27;s interests also extend into the sphere of such fields of physics as the theory of relativity, atomic and molecular optics, nuclear physics, the physics of elementary particles, and the theory of phase transitions. One of the goals of the Commission&#x27;s activities is to organize conferences. The first, in June 1996, was devoted to solar astrophysics, neutron stars, and gamma flashes. The conference materials, published in English with funding from the PAU, bear the title Solar Astrophysics, Structure of Neutron Stars, Gamma Flashes.

The Commission undertakes publication initiatives, aimed at providing the Polish market with up-to-date textbooks and monographs. Work has begun on translating into Polish a modern textbook devoted to the structure of the Sun and the stars.

The Commission actively supports educational initiatives associated with astrophysics. Among such initiatives was a master&#x27;s level area studies program in astrophysics at the Jagiellonian University, established in 1997.

====Commission of Technical Sciences====
This Commission was founded in 2003 and comprises seven sections: of Civil Engineering; of Construction, Technology and Operation of Machines; of Engineering and Technology of Ceramic Materials; of Informatics, Automatics and Robotics; of Metallurgy and Materials Engineering; of Mining and Power Engineering; of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering.

===Natural Sciences===
The PAU&#x27;s Natural Sciences section brings together representatives of the biological, agricultural, and geological sciences. The lectures at the section&#x27;s meetings, typically held jointly with the PAU Mathematics Section, Physics, and Chemistry, and the Medical Section, have dealt with current interdisciplinary problems in biology and earth sciences. In addition to Polish members, the lecturers have included foreign members of the Academy, such as Andrzej Bartke (Carbondale, Illinois, USA), and Otton H. Walliser (Göttingen). The section has also taken part in organizing symposia, e.g. the National Conference on Cell Biology (1996) and the International School on the Biophysics of Membrane Transport (1997).

Particularly noteworthy is the study by Andrzej Falniowski, &quot;Ways and Byways in the Evolution of Mollusks&quot; (2001), which appeared in the section&#x27;s series of &quot;Papers&quot;.

====Commission on Agricultural, Forests, and Veterinary Sciences====
The Commission&#x27;s activities are focused on the organization of scientific symposia, whose materials are published either in the form of separate single-topic volumes or in the series of &quot;Works&quot;. Currently, the Commission has been working on the issues connected with Polish agriculture, forestry and animal breeding in Europe united in EU.

====Commission on Quaternary Palaeogeography====
This Commission was founded in 1979 within the Kraków branch of the Polish Academy of Sciences, but since 1993 it has been a part of the PAU. Its roots can be traced back to the Committee for Palaeological Research, founded by the PAU in 1928, and to its official publication, &quot;Palaeology&quot;, in print since 1933. The Commission integrates various disciplines involved in the study of the Quaternary Period: geologists, geomorphologists, paleontologists, archaeologists, and others. The Commission&#x27;s works are published in the &quot;Folia Quaternaria&quot;. To date, volumes 64—74 have appeared under the aegis of PAU publications; these have comprised collections of papers dealing with neotectonics, Paleolithic settlement on the loess uplands of the Kraków region, paleomalacology, and dendrochronology. The Commission&#x27;s meetings have heard papers on the stratigraphy of Pleistocene and Holocene sediments in the light of malacological and palynological analyses, the age of shifts, the conditions for the deposition of lake chalks, and the formation of cave dripstones.

Within the scope of the Commission&#x27;s activities, Kazimierz Kowalski was pursuing a research project on &quot;Rodents of Pleistocene Europe&quot; (an individual grant from the Scientific Research Committee). The results of this research project are incorporated in volume 72 of &quot;Folia Quaternaria&quot; and was awarded the City of Kraków Prize.

====Commission on Embryology and Morphology====
This Commission, founded in 1996, serves to integrate research on the embryonal growth and morphology of plants and animals. The task it has established for itself is to organize annual national scientific conferences and regular meetings. The Commission is currently composed of scientists representing all the nation&#x27;s leading scientific centers. To date it has organized or co-organized several national scientific conferences and meetings with single papers. The results are published in three periodicals: &quot;Acta Biologica Cracoviensia, Folia Histochemica et Cytobiologica&quot;, and &quot;Folia Morphologica&quot;.

====Commission on Geoinformation====
This Commission was founded in 1998. Its focus of interests, in keeping with the definition of geoinformation, is methodology of collecting, storing, analyzing, and presenting data pertaining to terrestrial time and space, using the appropriate information technology. This involves information regarding the Earth itself and the objects, phenomena, and processes encountered on and beneath the surface of the Earth. Research topics may include the physical environment and its properties, or natural and man-made resources, as well as the changes taking place in these resources. Due to the composite nature of the discipline, the Commission includes geologists, geophysicists, geodesists, photogrammetrists and experts in remote sensing, representatives of mining-related sciences, information specialists, and geographers.

The main task of the Commission is to facilitate the exchange of experiences among specialists from different disciplines involved with geoinformation, to stimulate the development of this branch of science, and to promulgate its results. The Commission&#x27;s basic forms of activity include holding monthly scientific meetings, as well as organizing or co-organizing national and international scientific conferences. The results are published in the periodical &quot;Geoinformatica Polonica&quot;.

====Commission on Geography====
===Medicine===
The members of this section include physicians, pharmacists, and biologists whose scientific work is directly connected with medicine. The meetings of the section are regularly held jointly with the Mathematics and Natural Sciences sections, and have included papers on the general problems of medicine, presented both by members of the section and by foreign scientists visiting Kraków.

Two scientific symposia in the medical sciences took place in 1995 under the auspices of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences. One of them, organized in cooperation with the Medical Research Center of the Jagiellonian University and the Polish Physiological Association, dealt with the centennial of the discovery of adrenaline, which was made simultaneously by Polish and English researchers. The second symposium dealt with the problem of the role of infection by &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; in inflammations of the mucous membranes of the stomach. In this area a crucial role has been played by the research of Stanisław Konturek and Jerzy Stachura, members of our Academy who are also affiliated with the Polish Academy of Sciences.

Within the Medical section there is the PAU Commission on Medical Ethics. The members of the section also take part in the work of the PAU Commission on Threats to Civilization.

On the initiative and on behalf of the section, the Tadeusz Browicz Prize has been awarded since 1999 to recognize outstanding achievements in the field of medicine and pharmacology. Until recently the Prize was funded by the Pliva pharmaceutical company. The English Language School of Medicine at the Jagiellonian University&#x27;s Collegium Medicum, previously the second sponsor, was the sole sponsor in 2001. The Tadeusz Browicz Prize is formally awarded to the winners at the June meeting of the PAU&#x27;s General Assembly.

===Artistic Creativity===
This section was founded in 1994, after the PAU&#x27;s charter was amended to allow for its creation. The goal of the new Section was to include persons from the world of art among the members of the Academy, outstanding creators whose careers have made a significant contribution to the development of culture. The areas of artistic creativity represented in the section include literature, music, architecture, painting, sculpture, theater, and film.
The section&#x27;s activities were inaugurated by two lectures, one delivered by Jerzy Nowosielski, &quot;The Growth of Consciousness in Time: Truth or Illusion?&quot; and the other by Jan Józef Szczepański, &quot;The Concept of Morality in Literature&quot;.

The speakers at the section&#x27;s meetings in recent years have also included Andrzej Wajda, Witold Cęckiewicz, Jerzy Jarocki, Stanisław Lem, , and Bronisław Chromy.

===Independent Interdisciplinary Commissions===
====Anthropological Commission of the PAU====
====Commission on Threats to Civilization====
This Commission is interdisciplinary in character, and is composed of members of different PAU classes, from the History and Philosophy sections to the Creative Arts section. Threats to the harmonious development of humanity should be a subject of interest and research, not only for representatives of the exact sciences and engineering, biology, and medicine, but also for historians, philosophers, lawyers, and even literary scholars and creative artists from other areas of culture. Threats are associated in the public mind with the improper use of the results of scientific research and the development of technology and industrial operations that are hostile to the natural environment. Yet there are also dangers for the future of the human race lurking in climatic changes, population growth, and the appearance of new diseases. Other threats emerge from ideologies that generate fundamentalism, mendacity, and hatred, the primary causes of terrorism and war. We should bear in mind in this context that during the century now drawing to its close humanity achieved the capability of annihilating itself.

Ethical evaluations are not applied to the results of scientific research. The criterion of scientific value as such is truth. Evil lurks in our very selves, and this is what causes the results of research to be exploited to the detriment of humanity. The multiplication of pseudo-sciences and the contradiction of rationalism are leading us into blind alleys, and for many people are replacing their lost faith in the value of scientific progress. The general public needs to be convinced that it is only through the further development of science and learning that the consequences of all these threats can be averted. Scientific truth and the love of one&#x27;s neighbor are the basic principles that create the opportunity for humanity to survive and develop in harmony.

The Commission discusses the threats that have arisen, and provides society at large with accurate information about their causes and the ways to avert their consequences. The scientific meetings are used to present and discuss selected issues involved with the threats that have already emerged, are just becoming apparent, or are expected, and to indicate the directions for scientific research and actions to avert these threats. Extensive summaries of the papers are published in a PAU periodical, &quot;Zagrożenia cywilizacyjne&quot; [Threats to Civilization], which in the future will occur periodically in the form of a quarterly. In addition, the Commission intends to organize public lectures for a broad spectrum of society, and will also attempt to reach public opinion through the mass media: the press, radio, and television.

====Commission on the History of Sciences====
This Commission was founded in 1998 on the initiative of the Natural Sciences section. Its task is to stimulate research on the history of particular scientific disciplines, conducted by representatives of those disciplines, rather than by historians, who lack the specialized education needed to fully comprehend the substance of highly specialized disciplines. This idea fell on fertile soil, since there had already been great interest within the PAU in the history of the organization of science and in the biographies of eminent scholars and scientists from the past.

The Commission has been very active. It organizes monthly meetings with papers and discussions as well as scientific symposia. The results of the Commission&#x27;s work are printed in the series &quot;Works of the Commission on the History of Science&quot; (reports presented at the Commission meetings) and in &quot;Monographs&quot;. The Commission initiated also a series devoted to the PAU and entitled &quot;Studies and Materials for the History of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences&quot;.

====Commission on the Evaluation of Textbooks====
Out of a concern for the proper intellectual level of the textbooks used in public schools, the PAU Executive Board decided in late 2000 to found a Commission composed of specialists in the various subjects taught in the secondary school curriculum, to provide completely independent evaluations of the textbooks adopted for use in public schools. The work of such a Commission ought to be of considerable social benefit. The very existence of such an independent body should help make authors and publishers more sensitive to the intellectual level of the textbooks being introduced into the public school curriculum. Satisfactorily, the forecast have proved correct. The current activities of the Commission as well as the five published volumes of its Works have aroused intense interest. Following the Commission&#x27;s motion, honorary diplomas were conferred on the authors and published of the best textbooks during June General Assembly of the PAU (five times so far).

====Commission on European Matters====
This Commission, formed in 2003, is engaged—as its name indicates—into the issues related to European matters and especially the Poland&#x27;s, and Kraków&#x27;s, place and role in Europe. Several ongoing works (and mainly open sessions) have been already organised and all of them focused on various aspects of Poland&#x27;s participation in European Union. The exemplary subjects listed below (lectures or introductions to discussions during the Commission&#x27;s meetings) are brief but accurate summary of the most important issues: &quot;Constitution Treaty of the European Union&quot; by Edmund Wittbrodt, &quot;Europe Seeking for its Symbols. History and Meaning of the European flag&quot; by Krzysztof Kowalski, &quot;Being a European – what does it mean?&quot; by Zdzisław Mach and Piotr Sztompka, &quot;Is it worth dying for Nice?&quot; by Wojciech Słomczyński and Karol Życzkowski.

The Commission have worked on—and still is planning to do so—education and science matters (i.e. Polish studies on European Matters faculties, role of universities in today&#x27;s Europe, scientific and educational policies in Poland and Europe, financing of scientific research works, various organisational aspects of scientific activities in a European scale, European scientific associations&#x27; undertakings etc.) Altogether with the Commission on the History of Science, the Commission for European Matters organised (on behalf of Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences) a conference of European Society for the History of Science that took place in Kraków in September 2006.

====Commission for the Development of the City of Kraków====
The Commission is composed of 20 founder members (members of the PAU and the PAN), prominent representatives of the humanities, mathematics and natural sciences, artistic disciplines, as well as 21 incorporated members who support the interdisciplinary aims of the Commission and represent such fields as town and country planning, archaeology, history of art, sociology, law, landscape architecture, botany, geography, civil engineering, water management, transport and communication.

The Commission, depending on the undertaken tasks, intends to collaborate with appropriate specialists in related disciplines of science and to make them its members, if the need arises.

====Commission on the Philosophy of Natural Sciences====
PAU Commission for Natural Sciences Philosophy is a discussion panel for natural science scholars as &#x27;philosophers&#x27; taking place with participation and under &quot;sui generis&quot; control of &#x27;real&#x27; philosophers. The Commission is a group of representatives of Philosophy, Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Geology and Medicine. Its character is an interdisciplinary though, and focused on issues of an ontology aspect as well as issues concerning mutual influence Philosophy and other, more specialized, sciences.

====&quot;Fides et Ratio&quot; Commission====
====Commission for the Studies on Polish Diaspora====
====Commission for Ethics in Science====
====Commission of Natural Sciences and Medicine====
Based in Wrocław.

==Contemporary activity==
Currently, the PAU consists of six sections, each of which has its executive board, with a director, deputy director, and a secretary; in some cases, there is also a deputy secretary. Within each class there are commissions and committees, the latter standing or temporary, which, though, must be headed by a regular member of the PAU (with few exceptions), may include persons who are not PAU members.

The sections hold monthly scientific meetings, where papers are read and discussed. The PAU&#x27;s activities are described and documented in the &quot;PAU Annual&quot;. Each of the classes issues its own &quot;Papers&quot; or other publication series, where they publish works that fall within the scientific purview of the section or other texts of scientific or scholarly value, especially historical sources. The commissions have their own series of &quot;Works&quot; or periodicals, according to their respective specialties.

As of June 2009, the PAU had 476 members, including 146 regular members, 148 corresponding members and 182 foreign members, each of whom maintains active contacts with Polish science and learning.

===Seminars of the PAU===
Since 2002, monthly Seminars of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences have been organized and attracted attendance up to ca. 200 participants. Currently, the leading topic is &quot;Patriotism yesterday and today&quot;. To the group of speakers invited to deliver their lectures belong eminent representatives of science, culture, and public life, such as Władysław Bartoszewski, Bronisław Geremek, , Jan Nowak Jeziorański, Archbishop Archbishop Józef Życiński, Archbishop Henryk Muszyński and others.

===Science Café===
Since 2004, the PAU has organized, together with the daily &quot;Dziennik Polski&quot;, a series of events called the Science Café. These are scientific meetings open for public. Each of the meetings is dedicated to a lecture on a scientific subject for general public and is followed by a discussion and conversations over a cup of coffee.

===&quot;PAUza Akademicka&quot; Weekly===
An online weekly PAUza Akademicka (Academic PAUse) subsidized by the Municipality of Kraków, has been available since September 2008. On special occasions a paper version is printed. The weekly is devoted to the issues related to scientific life in Poland, with special attention paid to the scientific environment in Kraków. Andrzej Kobos PhD and Marian Nowy are the editors.

===Supporting Young Scholars and Junior Research Workers===
Since January 2009, the &quot;PAUeczka Akademicka&quot; [Academy of the Young], has been working in the PAU. Directed by vice-president of the PAU Andrzej Szczeklik, it organizes monthly meeting of PhD students, assistant lectures and students representing various scientific disciplines from the academic environment in Kraków. The meetings are devoted to discussions aiming at humanization and integration of academic circles. The PAU co-finances the Winter School of Theoretical Physics of Wrocław University (for students in senior years, PhD students, and junior research workers), international workshops, and the Kraków School of Theoretical Physics (for junior research workers from Poland and abroad).

===The Academic Library of the PAU and PAN===
The Academic Library of the PAU and the PAN has been in the structure of the PAU since 1 January 2000. Its origins go back to the 19th century and to the Kraków Learned Society. Until 1952 it functioned as the Library of the Academy of Arts and Sciences (since 1872) and of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences (since 1920), and starting from 1953 as an independent unit of the Polish Academy of Sciences. As a result of the agreement between the PAN and the PAU concluded on 20 October 1999, the Library became an institution managed by the PAU. The Library numbers ca. 660,000 volumes and inventory units, including nearly 144,250 volumes and inventory units of special collections, which comprise nearly 13,700 old prints, about 13,000 manuscripts and over 96,000 graphics and drawings. The Library exchanges publications with more than 1,000 institutions in 77 countries, publishes its &quot;Annual&quot; (of a volume of c.a. 50 publisher&#x27;s sheets), prepares and successively issues catalogues of its collections, and is engaged in gathering and providing information, for instance on didactics in tertiary education institutions in Kraków. The Library has its own Council appointed (on a fifty-fifty basis) by the PAU and the PAN.

===The Archives of the Science of the PAN and PAU===
The activities of the PAU are closely connected with the Archives of the Science of the PAN and of the PAU. Besides the PAN&#x27;s collection (starting from 1953) the Archives gather also files of the Kraków Learned Society and other Kraków societies, and, first of all, of the Academy of Arts and Sciences (since 1872) and the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences (1920–1952 and from 1989). The collection contains also numerous legacies of many scholars, not only those who were the PAU members. As a consequence of the agreement between the PAN and the PAU, since 1 April 2002, the former Warsaw Branch of the Archives of the Polish Academy of Sciences has been functioning under the name of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences in Kraków. The Archives belong to the structure of the PAN Branch in Kraków but have their own Council appointed and financed by both the academies. Besides storing, working out the collected items and making them available for researches, the Archives systematically organize various exhibitions and scientific conferences. They also publish the PAU series entitled &quot;In the Service of Science&quot;. The Archives work in close cooperation with the PAU&#x27;s Commission on the History of Science.

===Polish Library in Paris===
The Polish Library in Paris has become an important PAU&#x27;s department. The PAU exercised its former owner&#x27;s rights (since 1893) and settled the issue by arbitration reaching an agreement with the Historical and Literary Society in Paris, the body currently managing the Library. Having agreed on the Society&#x27;s co-ownership, the PAU has been co-financing (from the funds of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education) the Library and co-organizing its activities since 2004.

===Polish Biographical Dictionary===
The PAU collaborates with the Institute of History of the Polish Academy of Sciences in the preparation and publishing of &quot;Polski Słownik Biograficzny [Polish Biographical Dictionary]&quot;. From 1935 until 1949, the Dictionary was published by the PAU. Then, because of ideological reasons, the publishing was discontinued. It was two years after the political breakthrough in October 1956 when the editing unit was reactivated in the structures of the PAN. Since then the Dictionary has been continuously published. Starting from 1999 the PAU has been also involved in making of the &quot;Polish Biographical Dictionary&quot; by rendering its rooms of a total area of 193 m2 available for the editorial staff.

===Scientific Scholarships===
The PAU controls the foreign research fellowships funded by the Lanckoroński Foundations. This involves a large number of scholarships for resident fellowships in Rome, Vienna, and London, and occasionally in other cities as well. The PAU Scholarship Commission, which also includes representatives from five Polish universities—Jagiellonian University, Warsaw University, Wrocław University, Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań and Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń—awards these scholarships each year. In 2005, the Maria Zdziarska-Zaleska Scholarship Fund was set up at the Historical and Literary Society in Paris to provide money for research in the Polish library in Paris. A commission attached to the PAU awards the scholarships.

===International Cooperation===
Since its foundation, the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences has been actively involved in cooperation with foreign institutions and activities on the international forum. Already in the 19th century the Academy initiated archival expeditions to study sources from the history of Poland (among other the so-called Roman Expedition to Vatican Archives connected with its opening in 1881), and sent its representatives to international congresses. In 1898, the Academy of Arts and Sciences became the owner of the Polish Library in Paris and opened a scientific station there. The Academy&#x27;s library in Kraków carried on a broad exchange of publications from the very beginning. In 1921, the PAU became a founding member of the Union Académique Internationale (UAI). After its activities were resumed, the PAU&#x27;s membership in the UAI was renewed in 1993, and the PAU began to take part in the research and publication projects of this organization. The publication of the Polish series of the &quot;Corpus vasorum antiquorum&quot; (CVA) was completed with volume 10, devoted to Cypriot pottery from the collection of the National Museum in Warsaw. The Kraków sheet in the &quot;&quot; (TIR) was worked out and published, and the material for sheet 12 of the &quot;Atlas du Monde Grec et Romain&quot; was prepared. Three volumes of the Polish series in the &quot;Corpus antiquitatum Americanensium&quot; (CAA) have been published; the first two volumes are devoted to the ceramics and Peruvian textiles in the collection of Kraków Archaeological Museum (the Kluger Collection, formerly the property of the PAU), and the third one deals with the materials of the Polish archaeological mission in Peru. The edition of the Polish series &quot;Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum&quot; (SNG) has been commenced; its first four volumes are devoted to the collection of Greek coins from the Archaeological Museum in Łódź. PAU members are also participating in the realization of such UAI projects as &quot;Corpus philosophorum medii aevi, Civitas litteraria Europaea, Moravia Magna&quot;. The PAU has declared its intention of joining new UAI projects, such as the realization of the series &quot;Monumenta palaeographica medii aevi&quot; (volume 1 already worked out), &quot;Mundus Scytho-Sarmaticus et Graeco-Romanus&quot; (together with Ukraine).

Thanks to the effective cooperation of the PAU and the UAI, the annual plenary meeting of the UAI (involving representative of 44 academies around the world assembled in the UAI) took place in Kraków in 1999, during which the PAU&#x27;s representative, , was elected officer of the UAI; since 2007 he has been the vice-president of the organization. A cooperation agreement has been signed with the Slovak Academy of Sciences. This bore fruit especially in the field of archaeology, for instance in the realization of joint investigation of archaeological sites in eastern and south-western Slovakia as well as in the research into the archaeology and natural environment of the Low Beskids mountains (volume II). Cooperation was also initiated and contracts were signed with the Royal Flemish Academy for Science and the Arts in Belgium, with the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, with the Slovenian Academy of Sciences, with the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, with the Romanian Academy of Sciences, and with the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences. Somewhat looser forms of cooperation exist between the PAU and the Saxon Academy and Sciences, as well as the Austrian Academy of Sciences and with the Brandenburg Academy of Sciences in Berlin. Class II of the PAU has signed a cooperation agreement with the Institute of History in Vilnius. The PAU has also been engaged in scientific cooperation based on treaties negotiated by the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs with several countries, including France, Italy, the Czech Republic, Macedonia, and Egypt. Together with the universities in Rome (La Sapienza and LUMSA), in Lecce, in Angers, in Szeged, in Lublin (KUL), and in Tallinn, the PAU constitutes in accordance with the European Union requirements a scientific society named &quot;Centro Interuniversitario Internazionale per il Mediterraneo, l&#x27;Europa Centro-Orientale e l&#x27;Eurasia&quot;.

In 1994 the PAU Scientific Station in New York was founded, based on the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences in America, which continued the PAU&#x27;s traditions during the WWII and of the period of the compulsory suspension of the PAU activities, from 1952 until 1989. Its short-term activities could not be continued due to the lack of financial support. Currently, efforts have been made in order to revive this institution. Contacts have been established with the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences in Canada, founded in 1943 as a branch of the Polish Institute in New York, and since 1976 operating as an independent Canadian organization. It also acquired a status of the PAU Scientific Station. Three books have been jointly published, and the PAU supports the station with their lecturers. The PAU joined the project of the Polish Historical Institute in Rome, financed by the Lanckoronski Foundation. Recently, after the death of Karolina Lanckoronska, the institute was dissolved and its property, namely numerous publications and scientific projects, such as the publications of the acts of the Apostolic Nunciate in Poland, were taken over by the PAU. Harking back to an older tradition, the PAU is also co-organizing archaeological investigations in Ukraine, continuing the excavation of a large Scythian barrow in Ryzhanovka, among other projects. These investigations have brought one of the most outstanding archaeological discoveries of recent years: the discovery of richly accoutred burial of a Scythian ruler.

Now, the works are carried out under the direction of Jan Machnik and the efforts are focused on the research into settlements located on the Dniestr River. It is possible thanks to the grants by the Committee for Scientific Research (KBN).

Returning to its pre-war intentions, the PAU has also contributed to archaeological research being conducted in Greece. These investigations deal with the sequence of layers, unique in this part of Europe, in Cave No. 1 at Klisura (eastern Peloponnese), in which traces of habitation and palaeontological finds from the period of the last Ice Age occur. This research contributes to our understanding not only of the evolution of culture in Greece, but also of climatic and paleoecological changes over the last 100,000 years. The works are being conducted under the direction of Janusz Kozłowski, under research grants. They have borne fruit in the form of the publication of the results, jointly with the Greek Academy of Sciences and the PAU.

Pursuant to the cultural cooperation treaty between Poland and Egypt, the PAU, in cooperation with the Institute of Archaeology of the Jagiellonian University, is participating in archaeological investigations in the Nile Delta.

===Prizes===
The PAU awards prizes for outstanding research achievements. These include the following:
* The Nicholas Copernicus Prize, funded by the City of Kraków by a resolution of the City Council passed on 9 July 1993, in conjunction with the foundation act of the Municipal Commune of 18 February 1973. By tradition, the PAU awards this Prize every year in the fields of astronomy, earth sciences, economy, natural philosophy, medicine, military defense sciences, and law. In 1995, for the first time since the revival of the PAU, six Prizes were awarded.
* The Marian Mięsowicz Prize awarded every two years for outstanding achievements in the field of physics. The Prize, funded by institutes of physics working in Kraków, was awarded for the first time in 1997.
* The Tadeusz Browicz Prize, awarded annually since 1998 for outstanding achievements in the field of medicine. To date, the prizes have been funded by the Pliva pharmaceutical company in Kraków, Novartis Poland, and the School of Medicine in English at the Jagiellonian University&#x27;s Collegium Medicum.
* In June 2003, the Marian Kukieł Prize for outstanding achievements in the field of military history was awarded for the first time. Prof. Leszek Suski, Gen. Marian Kukie&#x27;s copyright heir, and the PAU co-fund the prize.
* In 2008, with an effort and will of the PAU, the Erazm and Anna Jerzmanowski Prize was revived under the auspices of the Lesser Poland Voivodeship. Called &quot;the Polish Nobel Prize&quot;, it was funded by Erazm Jerzmanowski in 1912 and secured by his inheritance. The prize was awarded within the years 1915–1938 for scientific and charitable activity. Its revival was possible thanks to the funds for Lesser Poland Voivodeship distributed by the local authorities under the leadership of Marshal Marek Nawara. The prize is supposed to be awarded annually. The first prizewinner was Ms Janina Ochojska-Okońska. She received the prize on 9 February 2009, on the centenary of Erazm Jerzmanowski&#x27;s death.
* Every year, upon a motion of the Commission on the Evaluation of Textbooks, the PAU confers honorary diplomas on the authors and publishers of highest rated textbooks for intermediate schools and secondary schools.

Additionally, the PAU actively participates in awarding the following prizes:
* The City of Kraków Prize; the President of the PAU is the Chairperson of the Jury and several PAU members are the members of the Jury.

<text>Barclays Bank has operated as a retail and commercial bank in Canada from 1929 to 1956, from 1979 to 1996, and most recently from 2010.

==Previous operations==

===Barclays Bank (Canada)===
Barclays Bank (Canada) Limited was incorporated in Montreal, Quebec in 1929, as a joint venture between Barclays Bank Limited and Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas). An office was later established in Toronto.

Like the other Canadian chartered banks, it issued its own banknotes. The Bank of Canada was established through the Bank of Canada Act of 1934 and the banks relinquished their right to issue their own currency. In 1956, Barclays Bank (Canada) was acquired by Imperial Bank of Canada, a predecessor of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, for 10% of the capital of Imperial. H.A. Stevenson was president of the bank from at least 1935 until 1950; his signature appears on one of the last currency issues by Barclays Bank (Canada) and he is quoted speaking at an annual general meeting of the bank in 1950.

===Barclays Bank of Canada===
The holding company, Barclays Canada Limited, which had been set-up in 1927 to meet the requirements of Canadian law in relation to foreign ownership, remained. In 1974, it was reopened to deal in the wholesale banking market. In 1979, foreign banks were allowed to receive charters and London-based Barclays Bank established a new Canadian subsidiary, Barclays Bank of Canada (). It was reorganised into commercial banking and corporate banking divisions in 1989, and bought by Hongkong Bank of Canada (HBC) in 1996. In 1999, HBC changed its name to HSBC Bank Canada, consistent with its parent&#x27;s strategy of creating a global brand.

==Present operations==
A non-banking subsidiary, Barclays Global Investors Canada Ltd., administers iShares and exchange-traded index funds. In 2010, Barclays Bank again applied for the right to open branches in Canada. The current operation, providing services to investment banking clients, is licensed by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions to carry on business as a foreign bank branch in Toronto and Calgary under the name Barclays Bank Plc, Canada Branch. In time, it is expected to offer full-service loans, sales, trading and research platform through Barclays Capital Canada Inc..

In addition to Barclays Bank of Canada, HSBC acquired the Canadian interests of other British banks, including:
* Lloyds Bank Canada
* National Westminster Bank of Canada
* Midland Bank Canada

<text>Being an indigenous tribe in Borneo, the Kayan people are similar to their neighbours, the Kenyah tribe, with which they are grouped together with the Bahau people under the Apo Kayan people group. The Kayan people are categorised as a part of the Dayak people. They are distinct from, and not to be confused with, the Kayan people of Myanmar.

The population of the Kayan ethnic group may be around 200,000. They are part of a larger grouping of people referred collectively as the Orang Ulu, or upriver people. Like some other Dayak people, they are known for being fierce warriors, former headhunters, adept in Upland rice cultivation, and having extensive tattoos and stretched earlobes amongst both sexes.

==History==

They may have originated from along the Kayan river in the North Kalimantan province of Borneo. They live along the upper Kayan and the middle Kapuas and Mahakam rivers. They seem to have expanded to the south in Sarawak in historic times, generating some conflicts with the Iban that were expanding north at the same time. They have settled in Sarawak on the middle Baram River, the Bintulu River and along the Rajang River, having been pressed back a little during the late 19th century. In 1863 West Kalimantan, Iban people migrated to the upstreams of Saribas River and Rejang River and started to attack the Kayan people in those areas and continued doing so northwards and later eastwards. Wars and headhunting attacks have caused many other tribes to be displaced, including the Kayan people, who make up of 1.4% of the West Kutai Regency population. Significant expansion to the east Borneo also occurred during the historical times, the conversion of the Kayan people to Islam forming the ethnogenesis of the Bulungan people.

==Language==
The Kayan language belongs to the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family.

==Main activities==
Their basic culture is similar to the other Dayak people in Borneo. Their agriculture was based upon shifting cultivation techniques and the cultivation of Upland rice. Other farming such as sago, corn, yams, pumpkin and tobacco are also cultivated. During the years of famine, sago is mined. Fishing (killing fish with poisons) plays an important role, and a smaller role is played by hunting with a &quot;sumpitan&quot;. The Kayan people are engaged in breeding pigs and chickens, while dogs are kept for ritual purposes. The Kayan people are known as excellent blacksmiths (the Kayan Mandau swords are the main item of exchange), boat builders and carpenters. Loom, weaving, production of tans, arts, wood carving, making of masks and pottery are also developed.

==Social structure==

Traditionally, they live in long houses on river banks. Their settlement consists of one or several long houses as long as 300 meters, which can accommodate up to 100 families (400–600 people) and consist of a common veranda and rooms. Residents of a long house constitute a tribal community. The Kayan people are divided into three endogamous caste-estate groups; &quot;house owning group&quot; or aristocrat (&quot;ipun uma&quot; or &quot;keta&#x27;u&quot;), community members or commoners (&quot;panyin&quot;) and slaves (&quot;lupau&quot;). Among the nobility, marriages are usually outside of the community, often with other tribes; while community members and slaves usually marry within the community. The leader is usually elected from the nobility class (in the 19th century, he also served as a military leader). The settlement is bi-localized, and the filiation is bilateral, while the system of kinship is of the English model.

==Religion==
The Kayan people developed a religion and a complex cult (bounty hunting and human sacrifices that disappeared at the beginning of the 20th century, as well as shamanism). The core event was the feast of collected heads (&quot;mamat&quot;), during which warrior initiations and funeral ceremonies were held. In the 20th century, some Kayan people were converted to Christianity.

==Culture==
===Traditional Kayan song===
* Alam Lening (Dayak Kayaan Mendalam, Kalbar)
* Lung Kayaan Mendalam

==Notable people==
* Francisca Luhong James - Miss Universe Malaysia 2020 and a part-time model. She is of mixed Kayan, Kenyah and Iban lineage.

<text>William Irwin Thompson (July 16, 1938 – November 8, 2020) was an American social philosopher, cultural critic, and poet. He received the Oslo International Poetry Festival Award in 1986. He described his writing and speaking style as &quot;mind-jazz on ancient texts&quot;. He was the founder of the Lindisfarne Association, which proposed the study and realization of a new planetary culture.

==Biography==
Thompson was born on July 16, 1938 in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up in Los Angeles, California. Thompson received his B.A. at Pomona College and his Ph.D. at Cornell University. He was a professor of humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then at York University in Toronto, Ontario. He has held visiting appointments at Syracuse University (in 1973 - where he taught &quot;Resacralization and the Emergence of a Planetary Culture&quot;), the University of Hawaii, the University of Toronto and the California Institute of Integral Studies (1992).

In 1973, he left academia to found the Lindisfarne Association. The Association, which he led from 1972 to 2012, was a group of scientists, poets, and religious scholars who met in order to discuss and to participate in the emerging planetary culture. Thompson lived in Switzerland for 17 years. He describes a recent work, &quot;Canticum Turicum&quot; in his 2009 book, &quot;Still Travels: Three Long Poems&quot;, as &quot;a long poem on Western Civilization that begins with folktales and traces of Charlemagne in Zürich and ends with the completion of Western Civilization as expressed in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; and the traces of James Joyce in Zürich.&quot;

Thompson was a Founding Mentor to the private K-12 Ross School in East Hampton, New York. In 1995, with mathematician Ralph Abraham, he designed a new type of cultural history curriculum based on their theories about the evolution of consciousness. Thompson lived his retired years in Portland, Maine.

==Work==
Thompson did his Master&#x27;s Essay at Cornell on applying the process philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead to poetry; he did his doctoral dissertation on the Easter Rising in Dublin 1916. While serving on the faculty at MIT in the 1960s, Thompson met famed media ecologist Marshall McLuhan, who would influence Thompson&#x27;s writings on cultural history. Thompson engaged a diverse set of traditions, including the Swiss cultural historian Jean Gebser, the Vedic philosopher Sri Aurobindo Ghose, the autopoetic epistemology of Francisco Varela, the endosymbiotic theory of evolution of Lynn Margulis, the Gaia Theory of James Lovelock, the complex systems thought of Ralph Abraham, the novels of Thomas Pynchon, and the daimonic transmissions of mystic David Spangler.

===Style===
&quot;Performance&quot; is central to Thompson&#x27;s approach. Performances either open new horizons for the future or close them down, and should be judged on that basis. Thompson thought that with the emergence of the integral era and its electronic media expressions that a new mode of discourse was required. He sought &quot;to turn non-fiction into a work of art on its own terms. Rather than trying to be a scholar or a journalist writing on the political and cultural news of the day, I worked to become a poetic reporter on the evolutionary news of the epoch&quot;. He espoused the notion that one must express an integral approach not just in content but in the very means of expressing it. Thompson did this in the way he approached teaching: &quot;The traditional academic lecture also became for me an occasion to transform the genre, to present not an academic reading of a paper, but a form of Bardic performance–not stories of battles but of the new ideas that were emerging around the world...The course was meant to be a performance of the very reality it sought to describe&quot;.

&quot;Wissenskunst&quot; (literally, &quot;knowledge-art&quot;) is a German term that Thompson coined to describe his own work. Contrasting it with &quot;Wissenschaft&quot;, the German term for science, Thompson defined &quot;Wissenskunst&quot; as &quot;the play of knowledge in a world of serious data-processors.&quot;As fiction and music are coming closer to reorganizing knowledge, scholarship is becoming closer to art. Our culture is changing, and so the genres of literature and history are changing as well. In an agricultural-warrior society, the genre is the epic, an &quot;Iliad&quot;. In an industrial-bourgeois society, the genre is the novel, a &quot;Moll Flanders&quot;. In our electronic, cybernetic society, the genre is &quot;Wissenkunst&quot;: the play of knowledge in a world of serious data-processors. The scholarly fictions of Jorge Luis Borges, or the reviews of non-existent books by Stanisław Lem, are examples of new art forms of a society in which humanity live, not innocently in nature nor confidently in cities, but apocalyptically in a civilization cracking up to the universe. At such a moment as this the novelist becomes a prophet, the composer a magician, and the historian a bard, a voice recalling ancient identities.

===Works===
====&quot;The Time Falling Bodies Take to Light&quot;====
In his acclaimed 1981 work &quot;The Time Falling Bodies Take to Light: Mythology, Sexuality and the Origins of Culture&quot;, Thompson criticized what he considers the hubristic pretensions of E. O. Wilson&#x27;s sociobiology, which attempted to subsume the humanities to evolutionary biology. Thompson then reviewed and critiqued the scholarship on the emergence of civilization from the Paleolithic to the historical period. He analyzed the assumptions and prejudices of the various anthropologists and historians who have written on the subject, and attempted to paint a more balanced picture. He described the task of the historian as closer to that of the artist and poet than to that of the scientist.Because we have separated humanity from nature, subject from object, values from analysis, knowledge from myth, and universities from the universe, it is enormously difficult for anyone but a poet or a mystic to understand what is going on in the holistic and mythopoeic thought of Ice Age humanity. The very language we use to discuss the past speaks of tools, hunters, and &quot;men&quot;, when every statue and painting we discover cries out to us that this Ice Age humanity was a culture of art, the love of animals, and women.

Thompson saw the Stone Age religion expressed in the Venus figurines, Lascaux cave paintings, Çatal Hüyük, and other artifacts to be an early form of shamanism. He believed that as humanity spread across the globe and was divided into separate cultures, this universal shamanistic Mother Goddess religion became the various esoteric traditions and religions of the world. Using this model, he analyzed Egyptian mythology, Sumerian hymns, the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, the cult of Quetzalcoatl, and many other stories, myths, and traditions. Thompson often referred to kriya yoga and yoga nidra throughout these analyses.

====&quot;Coming Into Being&quot;====
In his 1996 work &quot;Coming into Being: Artifacts and Texts in the Evolution of Consciousness&quot;, Thompson applied an approach that was similar to his 1981 book to many other artifacts, cultures and historical periods. A notable difference, however, is that the 1996 work was influenced by the work of cultural phenomenologist Jean Gebser. Works and authors analyzed include the &quot;Enuma Elish&quot;, Homer, Hesiod, Sappho, the &quot;Book of Judges&quot;, the &quot;Rig Veda&quot;, &quot;Ramayana&quot;, &quot;Upanishads&quot;, &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, and the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;. Thompson analyzed these works using the vocabulary of contemporary cognitive theory and chaos theory, as well as theories of history. An expanded paperback version was released in 1998.

The phrase &quot;Coming into being&quot; is a translation of the Greek term &quot;gignesthai&quot;, from which the word &quot;genesis&quot; is derived.

====&quot;Self and Society&quot;====
In his 2004 book &quot;Self and Society: Studies in the Evolution of Consciousness&quot;, and in collaboration with the mathematician Ralph Abraham, Thompson related Gebser&#x27;s structures to periods in the development of mathematics (arithmetic, geometric, algebraic, dynamical, chaotic) and in the history of music.

===Interests===

Thompson considered James Joyce&#x27;s stylistically experimental novel &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; to be &quot;the ultimate novel, indeed, the ultimate book,&quot; and also to be the climactic artistic work of the modern period and of the rational mentality. He was fascinated by Los Angeles, where he grew up, and Disneyland, which he considered to be LA&#x27;s essence. He also wrote a book-length treatment of the Easter Rising of 1916.

Thompson critiqued postmodern literary criticism, artificial intelligence, the technological futurism of Raymond Kurzweil, the contemporary philosophy of mind theories of Daniel Dennett and Paul Churchland, and the astrobiological cosmogony of Zecharia Sitchin.

===Reception===
Thompson&#x27;s second book, &quot;At the Edge of History&quot; was reviewed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; by Christopher Lehmann-Haupt in March 1971.

Thompson&#x27;s 1974 &quot;Passages About Earth&quot; was reviewed in &quot;Time&quot;. The reviewer wrote:

From ample but largely gloomy evidence of rapid social change — future shock, ecological disruption, population explosion, proliferation of information — Thompson draws a startling conclusion: &quot;We are the climactic generation of human cultural evolution.&quot; Man, he asserts, will now either slide back into a new Dark Age or evolve into a higher, more spiritual being.
Which way will we go? The author opts for evolution. While such optimism is as welcome as it is rare these days, it is largely based on mysticism and intimations of a &quot;new planetary culture,&quot; which Thompson shares with Philosopher Teilhard de Chardin and Science-Fiction Writer Arthur C. Clarke. This is thin epistemological ice even for a skater as fast as Thompson. Indeed, incredulous readers may drop the book after the first reference to &quot;our lost cosmological orientation.&quot; That would be a mistake. Agree with it or not, Passages is always fascinating, a magical mystery tour of man&#x27;s potential.

Thompson&#x27;s 1981 book &quot;The Time Falling Bodies Take To Light: Mythology, Sexuality, and the Origins of Culture&quot; was reviewed in the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; by Christopher Lehmann-Haupt. Lehmann-Haupt concluded:In &quot;The Time Falling Bodies Take to Light,&quot; William Irwin Thompson has gone part of the way toward rescuing mysticism from its Western friends. But only part of the way.

<text>The Naas River, a perennial stream of the Murrumbidgee catchment within the Murray–Darling basin, is located in the Australian Capital Territory, Australia.

==Course==
The river rises in the southern ranges of Namadgi National Park, south of Canberra, with flow generated by runoff and melting snow during spring from the Snowy Mountains. The river flows generally north, joined by four minor tributaries, before reaching its confluence with the Gudgenby River, south of Tharwa; descending over its course.

The watershed boundary of the Naas River defines the southern and south-eastern border of the Australian Capital Territory with New South Wales.

<doc id="1275574" wikidata="Q752483" url="?curid=1275574" title="UC AlbinoLeffe">
<text>Unione Calcio AlbinoLeffe is an Italian association football club representing Albino and Leffe, two small towns located in Val Seriana, Lombardy. The club played in Serie B for nine consecutive years and narrowly missed promotion in Serie A at the end of the 2007–08 season. It currently plays in Serie C and has been in the Italian third tier since its relegation in 2011–12.

== History ==
The club was created in 1998 as a result of the merger between former Serie C2 (fourth division) teams Albinese Calcio and Società Calcio Leffe, respectively from Albino and Leffe, two neighboring towns. In their first season, the club finished 2nd in the Serie C2 and won a promotion having defeated A.C. Prato in the Girone A Play-offs final. After rising to Serie C1 (the Italian third division), they performed at the middle of the pack, finishing 9th in 2000 and 13th in 2001.

However, in 2002, the &quot;Seriani&quot; went to the finals of the Coppa Italia Serie C, where they defeated Livorno 2–1 at home before losing 2–3 on the road. They won the tournament on the tiebreaker (most away goals scored). In league play they again finished 13th. In 2003, AlbinoLeffe, under coach Elio Gustinetti, finished second in league play before heading to the promotion play-off. There, they defeated Padua in the semifinals, then had a surprising triumph over Pisa Calcio, which pushed them up to Serie B.

The team moved from the small &quot;Martinelli Stadium&quot; in Leffe, where they used to play home matches before promotion to Serie B, to the bigger &quot;Stadio Atleti Azzurri d&#x27;Italia&quot; located in Bergamo, the chief-town of the province where both Albino and Leffe are located. Even though AlbinoLeffe was considered to be an outsider in Serie B, which historically includes several former Scudetto winners, the team remarkably managed to avoid relegation in the last two seasons. In 2005–2006, after a great comeback in the second half of the season following the appointment of Emiliano Mondonico as new head coach, Albinoleffe ended the season in eighteenth place and managed to save itself from relegation by prevailing in the playouts against Avellino (score: 2–0, 2–3). The 2006–2007 Serie B campaign, the fourth consecutive for the small Lombard team, ended with a good tenth place, well ahead of the relegation zone.

Historically, AlbinoLeffe&#x27;s home games have been characterized by very low attendance, as shown by the average 2,400 spectators per game in the 2006–07 season, the most successful in the club history.

With local hero Gustinetti back in charge of the team and despite a lineup composed of relative unknowns, the club&#x27;s 2007–08 campaign started surprisingly well, with the team leading the Serie B table for a few weeks and arousing the interest of the national media, which began providing regular coverage of the team&#x27;s games. This has thus far failed to improve the club&#x27;s low home attendance, however. During the season, AlbinoLeffe confirmed as a potential candidate for direct promotion to Serie A, however a string of poor results, ended with four consecutive home defeats, the final one being a 0–4 loss to Rimini, denied them the chance to achieve a place in the top two, and persuaded club chairman Gianfranco Andreoletti to sack Gustinetti, who then confirmed not to be in good relationships with the chairman, and appoint youth team coach Armando Madonna as caretaker boss for the final regular season match and the following promotion playoffs. Even after a 1–0 loss to Brescia, AlbinoLeffe managed to win at home in the second leg (2–1) and qualified for the final against Lecce. In the first leg they suffered a 1–0 loss. On 15 June, the second match was played in Lecce and its result was 1–1, so AlbinoLeffe did not reach Serie A.

At the end of the 2011–12 season, it was relegated to Lega Pro Prima Divisione after 9 consecutive years in Serie B.

AlbinoLeffe following the systematic match fixing as a club controlled by Singapore-based organized crime was penalized 10 points in the 2012–13 Lega Pro Prima Divisione.

== Stadium and colors ==
From the 2003–04 Serie B season and until 2019, AlbinoLeffe played its home games at the Atleti Azzurri d&#x27;Italia stadium in the city of Bergamo. Previously they played in Stadio Carlo Martelli of Leffe.

Following Atalanta&#x27;s renovation works on the stadium, the club reached a venue sharing agreement with Giana Erminio from the nearby city of Gorgonzola allowing the club to play their home matches for the 2019–20 Serie C season at the Stadio Città di Gorgonzola.

In 2021, the club opened a brand-new stadium in the town of Zanica with a capacity of 1,791 (with possibility of expansion to up to 5,500 in case of a promotion in Serie B) built next to the club&#x27;s headquarters and training centre; the stadium was formally approved by the Italian National Olympic Committee in March 2019. The stadium makes AlbinoLeffe the first Serie C team to own their home stadium. the inauguration match was played on 21 December 2021, a Serie C league game against Pro Patria.

The club&#x27;s official colors are dark blue and azure blue, also used for home matches, while the outfit worn by the players for away matches is red and yellow.

<doc id="1275576" wikidata="Q1088815" url="?curid=1275576" title="Southeast Region, Brazil">
<text>The Southeast Region of Brazil ( ) is composed of the states of Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. It is the richest region of the country, responsible for approximately 60% of the Brazilian GDP, as São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais are the three richest states of Brazil, the top three Brazilian states in terms of GDP. The Southeast of Brazil also has the highest GDP per capita among all Brazilian regions.

The Southeast region accounts for about 44% of Brazil&#x27;s total population, leading the country in population, urban population, population density, vehicles, industries, universities, airports, ports, highways, hospitals, schools, houses and many other areas.

==Geography==

=== São Paulo ===
Heart of the largest continued remnant of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, the Ribeira Valley is a Natural Heritage of Humanity, granted heritage as a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO. One of the biggest attractions is the biologic and ecosystems diversity, where approximately 400 species of birds, amphibians, reptiles and mammals live. The Alto Ribeira Tourist State Park (PETAR) is paradise for ecotourists, for its enormous diversity in geologic formations, among grottos and caves, rivers and waterfalls. There are currently 454 caves registered by the Brazilian Society of Speleology (SBE) in the State of São Paulo, all at the Ribeira Valley. The 280 caves located at PETAR represent the biggest concentration of caves in Brazil.

=== Minas Gerais ===


The landscape of the State is marked by mountains, valleys and caverns. In the Serra do Cipó, Sete Lagoas, Cordisburgo and Lagoa Santa, the caves and waterfalls. Minas Gerais is the source of some of the biggest rivers in Brazil, most notably the São Francisco, the Paraná and to a lesser extent, the Rio Doce. The state also holds many hydroelectric power plants, including Furnas dam. Some of the highest peaks in Brazil are in the mountain ranges in the southern part of the state, such as Serra da Mantiqueira and Serra do Cervo, which mark the border between Minas and its neighbors São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The most notable one is the Pico da Bandeira, the third highest mountain in Brazil at 2890 m, standing on the border with Espírito Santo state. The state also has huge reserves of iron and sizeable reserves of gold and gemstones, including emerald, topaz and aquamarine mines.

=== Rio de Janeiro ===
The state is part of the Mata Atlântica biome, and its topography comprises both mountains and plains, located between the Mantiqueira Mountains and the Atlantic Ocean. Its coast is carved by the bays of Guanabara, Sepetiba and Ilha Grande.
There are prominent slopes near the ocean, also featuring diverse environments, such as restinga vegetation, bays, lagoons and tropical forests.
Rio de Janeiro is the smallest state in the Southeast macroregion and one of the smallest in Brazil. It has, however, the third longest coastline in the country (second only to Bahia&#x27;s and Maranhão&#x27;s), extending 635 kilometers.

=== Espírito Santo ===
With a 46.180 square kilometers, it is about the size of Estonia, or half the size of Portugal, and has a variety of habitats including coastal plains, lakes, mountain forest, mangroves and many others.
The main river in the state is the Doce. Other important river basins include the Santa Maria River Basin which is the northern branch of rivers which join the sea at Vitoria, and Jucu River Basin which flows into the sea at roughly the same place, but corresponds to the southern branch (which seems to come out of Vitoria). Espírito Santo&#x27;s climate is tropical along the coast, with dry winters and rainy summers. North of Doce River it&#x27;s generally drier and also hot. In the mountainous regions in the south and south west of the state, the tropical climate is strongly influenced by altitude, and the average temperatures are colder.
The state can be divided into two areas: the low lying coastline and the highland area known as &quot;Serra&quot; (where one can find the 2.890 m Pico da Bandeira mountain), which is part of the larger Serra do Caparaó, the Caparaó Mountain Range. In the map to the right it is in the gray area in the extreme southwest of the state, and is shared with Minas Gerais.

==Demographics==

=== Livestock ===

The livestock also has great prominence in the region.

The Southeast is the second national producer of milk, with 34.2%, slightly losing compared to the South Region, which produces 35.7%. The southeast has the largest herd of cows milked: 30.4% of the total of 17.1 million existing in Brazil. The highest productivity, however, is that of the Southern Region, with an average of 3,284 liters per cow per year, which is why it has led the milk production ranking since 2015. Minas Gerais is the main milk-producing state in Brazil with the largest it is also effective for milked cows, responsible for 26.6% of production and 20.0% of all animals in milk. The municipality of Patos de Minas was the second largest producer in 2017, with 191.3 million liters of milk.

Poultry farming and egg production are the most important in the country. Flocks of poultry, according to IBGE, include chickens, roosters, hens and chicks. In 2018, the South region, with an emphasis on the creation of chickens for slaughter, was responsible for almost half of the Brazilian total (46.9%). Paraná only represented 26.2%. However, the situation is reversed when it comes to chickens. The first region in the ranking was the Southeast, with 38.9% of the country&#x27;s total capital. A total of 246.9 million hens was estimated for 2018. The state of São Paulo was responsible for 21.9%. The national production of chicken eggs was 4.4 billion dozen in 2018. The Southeast region was responsible for 43.8% of the total produced. The state of São Paulo was the largest national producer (25.6%), with a total of 16.8 million birds. The Southeast is responsible for 64%, highlighting São Paulo (24.6%) and Espírito Santo (21.0%).

=== Mining ===
In mineral production, in 2017, Minas Gerais was the country&#x27;s largest producer of iron (277 million tons worth R $37.2 billion), gold (29.3 tons for a value of R $3.6 billion), zinc (400 thousand tons for a value of R $351 million) and niobium (in the form of hydrochloride) (131 thousand tons for a value of R $254 million). In addition, Minas was the second largest producer of aluminum (bauxite) (1.47 million tons at a value of R $105 million), third of manganese (296 thousand tons to a value of R $32 million) and 5th of tin (206 tons worth R $4.7 million). Minas Gerais had 47.19% of the value of the production of minerals marketed in Brazil (first place), with R $41.7 billion. The state has the largest production of various gemstones in the country. In aquamarine, Minas Gerais produces the most valuable stones in the world. In diamond, Brazil was the world&#x27;s largest producer of diamonds from 1730 to 1870, mining occurred for the first time in the Serra da Canastra, region of Diamantina, even lowering the price of stone in everyone due to excess production. Minas Gerais continues to extract diamonds, in addition to having larger or smaller scale productions of agate, emerald, garnet, jasper, amethyst, and sapphire. Topaz and tourmaline stand out. Imperial Topaz, a valued variety of topaz, is only found in Ouro Preto. Brazil is the world&#x27;s leading producer of topaz. It is also one of the world&#x27;s largest tourmaline producers.

=== Industry ===




In the Southeast region, the industrialization of the country began, making the transformation industry the main source of income and work in its states. The state of São Paulo became the largest industrial park in South America.

The Southeast Region has 53% of the industrial GDP of Brazil.
The main industrial activities in the region are:

* Iron and steel industry and metallurgy: It&#x27;s in this region that the first industry of this type is located, the Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional, in the city of Volta Redonda, due to its proximity to a large area of iron mining, the so-called &quot;iron quadrilateral&quot;, in the state of Minas Gerais. The Usiminas, in Ipatinga, which today is the largest crude steel producer in the country, and the Companhia Siderúrgica de Tubarão, in Vitória, Espírito Santo, are also installed in the region. The Southeast Region produces around 90% of the country&#x27;s steel.

In Brazil, the automobile sector represents around 22% of industrial GDP. The Greater ABC Region, in São Paulo, is the first center and the largest automobile center in Brazil. When the country&#x27;s manufacturing was practically restricted to ABC, the State represented 74.8% of Brazilian production in 1990. In 2017, this index decreased to 46.6%, and in 2019, to 40.1%, due to a phenomenon of internalization of the production of vehicles in Brazil, driven by factors such as unions, which made excessive labor and payroll charges, discouraged investment and favored the search for new cities. The development of the ABC cities helped curb appeal, due to rising real estate costs and higher density of residential areas. Sul Fluminense (Rio de Janeiro) was already the second largest pole in 2017, but in 2019 it fell to fourth place, behind Paraná (15%) and Minas Gerais (10.7%). In the Southeast there are factories of GM, Volkswagen, Fiat, Ford, Honda, Toyota, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, Land Rover, Citroen / Peugeot, Scania and Iveco.

In the production of tractors, in 2017, the main manufacturers in Brazil were John Deere, New Holland, Massey Ferguson, Valtra, Case IH and the Brazilian Agrale. They all have factories in the southeast, basically in São Paulo.

* Petroleum: Almost all of Brazil&#x27;s oil and natural gas is extracted in the Southeast, mainly in Rio de Janeiro, but also in Espírito Santo and São Paulo. Most of the oil refining is also carried out in the region. Rio de Janeiro presents great importance in oil prospecting, which São Paulo has a great importance in the refining activity, being located in that state the main refineries of the country, among them, the REPLAN, the main of the country. In addition to oil, there is the extraction of natural gas from the Santos maritime basin and, until a few years ago, there was the extraction of bitumen in the Paraíba river valley.
* High technology: The so-called &quot;Brazilian silicon valley&quot; is located in that region, made up of the cities of São Paulo, São José dos Campos, São Carlos and Campinas. These four cities concentrate industries of computing, telecommunications, electronics and other activities involving high technology; in addition to having important research centers and important universities, such as the &quot;Technological Institute of Aeronautics&quot; - ITA, in São José dos Campos. Brazil has two large production centers for electronic products, located in the Metropolitan Region of Campinas, in the State of São Paulo, and in the Manaus Free Trade Zone, in the State of Amazonas. There are large internationally renowned technology companies, as well as part of the industries that participate in their supply chain. The country also has other smaller centers, such as the municipalities of São José dos Campos and São Carlos, in the state of São Paulo. In Campinas there are industrial units of groups such as General Electric, Samsung, HP and Foxconn, a manufacturer of Apple and Dell. São José dos Campos, focuses on the aviation industry. This is where the headquarters of Embraer, a Brazilian company that is the third largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, after Boeing and Airbus, is located. In the production of cell phones and other electronic products, Samsung produces in Campinas; LG produces in Taubaté; Flextronics, which produces Motorola cell phones, produces in Jaguariúna; and Semp-TCL produces in Cajamar. In Santa Rita do Sapucaí, Minas Gerais, 8 thousand jobs are linked to the sector, with more than 120 companies. Most produce equipment for the telecommunications industry, such as decoders, including those used in the transmission of the digital television system.

In 2011, Brazil had the sixth largest chemical industry in the world, with net sales of $157 billion, or 3.1% of world sales. At that time, there were 973 factories of chemical products for industrial use. They are concentrated in the Southeast Region, mainly in São Paulo. In 2018, the Brazilian chemical sector was the eighth largest in the world, representing 10% of the national industrial GDP and 2.5% of the total GDP. In 2020, imports will occupy 43% of domestic demand for chemical products. Since 2008, the average use of capacity in the Brazilian chemical industry has been at a level considered low, ranging between 70 and 83%.

In pharmaceutical Industry, most of the companies in Brazil have been established in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro for a long time. In 2019, the situation was that, due to the tax advantages offered in states such as Pernambuco, Goiás and Minas Gerais, companies were leaving RJ and SP and going to these states. In 2017, Brazil was considered the sixth largest pharmaceutical market in the world. Drug sales in pharmacies reached around R $57 billion (US$17.79 billion) in the country. The pharmaceutical market in Brazil had 241 regulated and authorized laboratories for the sale of medicines. Of these, the majority (60%) have national capital. Multinational companies had approximately 52.44% of the market, with 34.75% in commercialized packaging. Brazilian laboratories represent 47.56% of the market in sales and 65.25% in cases sold. In the distribution of drug sales by state, São Paulo ranked first: São Paulo&#x27;s pharmaceutical industry had a turnover of R $53.3 billion, 76.8% of total sales throughout the country. The companies that benefited the most from the sale of drugs in the country in 2015 were EMS, Hypermarcas (NeoQuímica), Sanofi (Medley), Novartis, Aché, Eurofarma, Takeda, Bayer, Pfizer and GSK.

In food industry, in 2019, Brazil was the second largest exporter of processed foods in the world, with a value of US$34.1 billion in exports. The revenue of the Brazilian food and beverage industry in 2019 was R $699.9 billion, 9.7% of the country&#x27;s gross domestic product. In 2015, the food and beverage industrial sector in Brazil comprised 34,800 companies (not counting bakeries), the vast majority of which were small. These companies employed more than 1,600,000 workers, making the food and beverage industry the largest employer in manufacturing. There are around 570 large companies in Brazil, which account for a good part of the industry&#x27;s total income. São Paulo created companies such as: , Vigor, Minerva Foods, Bauducco, Santa Helena, Marilan, Ceratti, Fugini, Chocolates Pan, Embaré, among others. Minas Gerais created food companies of national importance such as Itambé and Pif Paf Alimentos. Espírito Santo created Chocolates Garoto and Rio de Janeiro created Piraquê and Granfino.

In the Footwear industry, in 2019 Brazil produced 972 million pairs. Exports were around 10%, reaching almost 125 million pairs. Brazil ranks fourth among world producers, behind China, India and Vietnam, and 11th among the largest exporters. Of the pairs produced, 49% were made of plastic or rubber, 28.8% were made of synthetic laminate, and only 17.7% were made of leather. The largest pole in Brazil is in Rio Grande do Sul, but São Paulo has important shoe centers, such as the one in the city of Franca, specialized in men&#x27;s footwear, in the city of Jaú, specialized in women&#x27;s footwear and in the city of Birigui, specialized in footwear. children. Jaú, Franca and Birigui represent 92% of footwear production in the state of São Paulo. Birigui has 350 companies, which generate around 13 thousand jobs, producing 45.9 million pairs per year. 52% of children&#x27;s shoes in the country are produced in this city. From Birigui came most of the most famous children&#x27;s shoe factories in the country. Jaú has 150 factories that produce around 130 thousand pairs of cheap women&#x27;s shoes per day. The footwear sector in Franca has around 550 companies and employs about 20,000 employees. Most of the most famous men&#x27;s shoe factories in the country come from São Paulo. Minas Gerais has a pole specialized in cheap shoes and shoes in Nova Serrana. The city has around 830 industries, which in 2017 produced around 110 million pairs. However, overall, the Brazilian industry has been struggling to compete with Chinese footwear, which is priced unbeatable due to the difference in tax collection from one country to another, in addition to the absence of heavy Brazilian labor taxes in China, and the Brazilian businessman has had to invest in value-added products, combining quality and design, in order to survive.

In textile industry, Brazil, despite being among the 5 largest producers in the world in 2013, and being representative in the consumption of textiles and clothing, has very little insertion in world trade. In 2015, Brazilian imports ranked 25th (US$5.5 billion). And in exports, it was only 40th in the world ranking. Brazil&#x27;s participation in the world trade of textiles and clothing is only 0.3%, due to the difficulty of competing in price with producers in India and mainly in China. The gross value of production, which includes the consumption of intermediate goods and services, of the Brazilian textile industry corresponded to almost R $40 billion in 2015, 1.6% of the gross value of industrial production in Brazil. São Paulo (37.4%) is the largest producer. The main productive areas of São Paulo are the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo and Campinas. Minas Gerais has 8.51% (third largest production in the country).

In home appliance industry, sales were 12.9 million units in 2017. The sector had its sales peak in 2012, with 18.9 million units. The brands that sold the most were Brastemp, Electrolux, Consul and Philips. Brastemp is originally from São Bernardo do Campo. São Paulo was also the place where Metalfrio was founded.

==Infrastructure==

===International Airports===
*São Paulo

São Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport connects Brazil to 28 countries with nearly 100,000 daily visitors. With capacity to serve 15 million passengers a year, in two terminals, the airport currently handles 12 million users. Construction of a third passenger terminal is pending, to raise yearly capacity to 29 million passengers. The project, in the tendering phase, is part of the airport&#x27;s master plan and will get under way shortly. São Paulo International Airport is also one of the main air cargo hubs in Brazil. The roughly 100 flights a day carry everything from fruits grown in the São Francisco Valley to the most sophisticated medications created by science. The airport&#x27;s cargo terminal is South America&#x27;s largest and stands behind only Mexico City&#x27;s in all of Latin America. In 2003, over 75,000 metric tons of freight passed through the terminal.

*Rio de Janeiro
Since August 2004, with the transfer of many flights from Santos-Dumont Airport, Rio de Janeiro International Airport has returned to being the main doorway to Brazil. According to data from the official Brazilian travel bureau, Embratur, nearly 40% of foreign tourists who visit Brazil choose Rio as their gateway, meaning Galeão Airport. Besides linking Rio to the rest of Brazil with domestic flights, Galeão has connections to more than 18 countries. It can handle up to 15 million users a year in two passenger terminals. Located only 20 kilometers from downtown Rio, the international airport is served by several quick access routes, such as the Linha Vermelha and Linha Amarela freeways and Avenida Brasil, thus conveniently serving residents of the city&#x27;s southern, northern and western zones. There are special shuttle buses linking Galeão to Santos-Dumont, and bus and taxi service to the rest of the city. The airport complex also has Brazil&#x27;s longest runway at 4.240 meters, and one of South America&#x27;s largest and best equipped cargo logistics terminals.

*Belo Horizonte
Tancredo Neves/Confins International Airport is located in the municipalities of Lagoa Santa and Confins, 38 km from Belo Horizonte, and was opened in January 1984. It was planned from the start for future expansion in steps to meet growing demand. The first step was undertaken with careful concern for the environment, including monitoring by specialized consultants, since the region has a rich archeological heritage. The airport&#x27;s location is attested to by the fact it has one of the lowest rates of shutdown for bad weather in the country. Confins is certified by the ISO 9001 standard, covering ten processes in the administrative, operational, safety/security and maintenance areas. Starting in March 2005, Confins Airport will receive flights that currently use Pampulha Airport.

===National Airport===
*Vitória
Vitoria Airport is located on a land plot of just over 5.2 million square meters. Since construction of its first step, finished in 1946, Vitória Airport has undergone several expansions and modernizations, but current demand has surpassed its capacity of 560 thousand passengers a year. The recent construction of new aircraft parking boxes on the aprons has improved the airport&#x27;s operational efficiency. 
In 2003 more than 1.2 million passengers used the airport, and in 2004 this rose to some 1.25 million. Vitória is one of the 32 airports in the Infraero network that has a cargo terminal. In May 1999 the first direct international freight connection to the United States (Miami) began operating to Vitória, facilitating imports to the state of Espírito Santo. Today there are five of such flights a week.

===Highways===

The Southeast Brazilian region is highly covered by Paved roads – due to the policy in the Brazil&#x27;s economy in the 1960s (automobilization of the country) – which led to the car&#x27;s manufacturing to be a major industry not only in the region but in Brazil as well.

The Southeast&#x27;s highways are generally in good or very good conditions – some exceptions are made to the southern parts of the BR-101.

Railways are present as well (and also, the region is more covered than any other region), but mainly for freight transport – soy beans and iron ore, mainly, from the farms and mines to the seaports.

Also, a very complicated hydrocanal system is present in the region, with ten major dams.

Health care and education are of major concern in the larger cities, but in smaller ones, the population are generally well-looked after.

<doc id="1275587" wikidata="Q3209711" url="?curid=1275587" title="'Scuse Me While I Miss the Sky">
<text>&quot;Scuse Me While I Miss the Sky&quot; is the sixteenth episode of the fourteenth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 30, 2003. The episode was written by Dan Greaney and Allen Grazier and was directed by Steven Dean Moore.

In this episode, Lisa tries to reduce the town&#x27;s light pollution, so she can see the stars at night. Meanwhile Bart tries to steal the hood ornament from Fat Tony&#x27;s car to regain his reputation after he is humiliated. Eric Idle guest starred as Declan Desmond. The episode received mixed reviews.

==Plot==
Declan Desmond, an opinionated British documentary film producer, films a documentary at Springfield Elementary School on the students&#x27; lives. He interviews Bart as he gets hit by a ball of dirt thrown by Nelson and breaks down in tears. Later, Declan belittles Lisa as she talks about the multiplicity of her interests, insinuating that she could neither be happy nor successful juggling too many hobbies or passions. Hurt by his criticism, Lisa resolves to find a single passion to which she can devote herself; astronomy. She convinces Homer to buy her a telescope, but discovers that light pollution from the city is blocking her view of the sky. After a discussion with Professor Frink, Lisa starts a petition to reduce the city&#x27;s light pollution. After gaining enough signatures, Mayor Quimby agrees to turn off the streetlights, leading to a clear view of the stars, at which many people from Springfield marvel.

Meanwhile, Bart is looking for a way to regain his popularity after being humiliated. After seeing Nelson parading around with stolen car hood ornaments, he decides to steal one off Fat Tony&#x27;s car. Milhouse and Bart are foiled on their first attempt because Quimby is pressured to switch the lights back on due to rising crime. Yet the light level is set too high which means that no one can sleep so Lisa, still wanting to see the light pollution reduced, and Bart, still wanting to steal Fat Tony&#x27;s hood ornament, take a now sleep-deprived Homer to the power plant and overload the generators causing a power outage, which ends the light pollution, but before the angry citizens can attack, Lisa points out a meteor shower and the town looks on in wonderment while Bart sneaks off and steals Fat Tony&#x27;s hood ornament, with Don McLean&#x27;s song &quot;Vincent&quot; playing in the background.

The show ends with a montage of clips from Declan&#x27;s documentary.

==Production==
By this time in the show&#x27;s history, there had been an &quot;ever-present fear that as the show ages it risks &#x27;jumping the shark. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; writers satirized the term&#x27;s namesake (an episode of &quot;Happy Days&quot; in which Fonzie jumps over a shark on water skis) in the episode, which has a couch gag where the Simpson family jump over a tank full of sharks in a similar fashion (the gag had previously been used in the episode &quot;How I Spent My Strummer Vacation&quot;). Executive producer Al Jean said, &quot;We figured that if we said it first, then they couldn&#x27;t say it&quot;.

The writers included a line where Carl Carlson mentions his Icelandic heritage, as well as the fact that Homer, Moe and Lenny show absolutely no interest in what he&#x27;s saying. This would later become both the basis and an explicit reference point in the episode &quot;The Saga of Carl&quot;, where Carl steals the winnings from a lottery ticket he jointly purchased with the gang before returning to Iceland; them when they track him down, he says that he is not sorry for what he did because they are not friends, as &quot;friends care that their friends are from Iceland!&quot;

==Cultural references==
The episode&#x27;s title references the lyric &quot;scuse me while I kiss the sky&quot; from Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s song &quot;Purple Haze&quot;.

==Reception==
===Viewing figures===
The episode was watched by 12.56 million viewers, which was the 16th most-watched show that week.

===Critical response===
Colin Jacobson of &quot;DVD Movie Guide&quot; wrote, &quot;[l]ike most Lisa-based stories, this one tends to be lackluster.&quot; He enjoyed the subplot involving Bart and Fat Tony.

On &quot;Four Finger Discount&quot;, Brendan Dando liked both Lisa and Bart&#x27;s stories while Guy Davis felt the episode was pieced together from many different writers&#x27; ideas.

English musician Jake Bugg credits hearing Don McLean&#x27;s &quot;Vincent&quot; in this episode as his formative musical moment.

===Awards and nominations===
Director Steven Dean Moore won the Annie Award for Outstanding Achievement for Directing in an Animated Television/Broadcast Production for this episode. The episode was also nominated for an Environmental Media Award for Best Television Episodic Comedy.

<doc id="1275591" wikidata="Q3243071" url="?curid=1275591" title="Islam in Iran">
<text>The Arab conquest of Iran, which culminated in the fall of the Sasanian Empire to the nascent Rashidun Caliphate, brought about a monumental change in Iranian society by purging Zoroastrianism, which had been the Iranian nation&#x27;s official and majority religion since the time of the Achaemenid Empire. Since the Rashidun invasion, Islam (in any form) has consistently held the status of Iran&#x27;s official religion except for during a short period in the 13th century, when the Mongol invasions and conquests destroyed the Abbasid Caliphate and smaller Islamic realms before resulting in the establishment of the Ilkhanate. The process by which Iranian society became integrated into the Muslim world took place over many centuries, with nobility and city-dwellers being among the first to convert, in spite of notable periods of resistance, while the peasantry and the &quot;dehqans&quot; (land-owning magnates) took longer to do so. Around the 10th century, most Persians had become Muslims.

Between the 7th century and the 15th century, Sunni Islam was the dominant sect in Iran, and Iranian academics of this period contributed greatly to the Islamic Golden Age. In the 16th century, the newly enthroned Safavid dynasty initiated a massive campaign to install Shia Islam as Iran&#x27;s official sect, aggressively proselytizing the faith and forcibly converting the Iranian populace. The Safavids&#x27; actions triggered tensions with the neighbouring Sunni-majority Ottoman Empire, in part due to the flight of non-Shia refugees from Iran. It is estimated that by the mid-17th century, Iran had become a Shia-majority nation. Over the following centuries, with the state-fostered rise of an Iran-based Shia clergy, a synthesis was formed between Iranian culture and Shia Islam that marked each indelibly with the tincture of the other. Later, under the Pahlavi dynasty, Islamic influence on Iranian society was rolled back in order to assert a new Iranian national identity—one that focused on pre-Islamic Iran by shedding more light on Zoroastrian tradition and other aspects of ancient Iranian society, particularly during the Achaemenid era. However, in 1979, the Islamic Revolution brought about yet another monumental change by ending the historic Iranian monarchy and replacing it with an Islamic republic.


==Modern estimates of religious adherence== 
According to an October 2024 update to &quot;Britannica.com&quot; by scholars at the Universities of Cambridge and Utah, as of the date of their source data, Muslims accounted for 99.6% of the total population of Iran—&quot;c.f.&quot; comparable older numbers and somewhat discrepant more recent numbers, at &quot;CIA.gov&quot;—with the &quot;vast majority... [stated as being] of the Ithnā ʿAsharī, or Twelver, Shiʿi branch&quot;.

The Iranian government&#x27;s 2016 census purportedly presents 99% of the Iranian population as Muslim (&quot;c.f.&quot; pie chart and its sources), and 80% of this figure is composed of Twelver Shias. Approximately 7% of Iranians are Sunnis. According to scholars at the Universities of Cambridge and Utah, the country&#x27;s &quot;Kurds and Turkmen are predominantly Sunni Muslims&quot;, with Iran’s Arab population being split between &quot;Sunni and Shiʿi&quot; (Shia). Other sources note that this smaller percentage comprises the country&#x27;s ethnic minorities, the Kurds, Turkmens, and Arabs, as well as Achomi Persians, Khorasani Persians, and Baloch.

According to the 2020 Wave 7 World Values Survey, 96% of Iranians identify as Muslims. However, a report by the Group for Analyzing and Measuring Attitudes in Iran (GAMAAN) in the same year showed a sharp decline in religiosity in the country, as only 40% of Iranian respondents identified as Muslims. Subsequent GAMAAN surveys in 2022 and 2023 showed that, depending on how the question was asked, 38% to 56% identified as Shia Muslims, 5% identified as Sunni Muslims, and roughly a quarter of were susceptible to a form of deism—that is, belief in God without identifying as religious. In all GAMAAN surveys, 7% to 10% of Iranian respondents identified as atheists. Moreover, the online surveys offered respondents a unique opportunity to express themselves, leading to fluctuating numbers of Iranians identifying as Zoroastrians.

== History == 

===Arab conquest of Iran===


Muslims conquered Iran in the time of Umar (637) and conquered it after several great battles. Yazdegerd III fled from one district to another Merv in 651. By 674, Muslims had conquered Greater Khorasan (which included modern Iranian Khorasan province and modern Afghanistan, Transoxania).

As Bernard Lewis has quoted &quot;These events have been variously seen in Iran: by some as a blessing, the advent of the true faith, the end of the age of ignorance and heathenism; by others as a humiliating national defeat, the conquest and subjugation of the country by foreign invaders. Both perceptions are of course valid, depending on one&#x27;s angle of vision.&quot;

Under Umar and his immediate successors, the Arab conquerors attempted to maintain their political and cultural cohesion despite the attractions of the civilizations they had conquered. The Arabs were to settle in the garrison towns rather than on scattered estates. The new non-Muslim subjects, or &quot;dhimmi&quot;, were to pay a special tax, the &quot;jizya&quot; or poll tax, which was calculated per individual at varying rates for able bodied men of military age.

Iranians were among the very earliest converts to Islam, and their conversion in significant numbers began as soon as the Arab armies reached and overran the Persian plateau. Despite some resistance from elements of the Zoroastrian clergy and other ancient religions, the anti-Islamic policies of later conquerors like the Il-khanids, the impact of the Christian and secular West in modern times, and the attraction of new religious movements like Babism and the Baháʼí Faith (qq.v.), the vast majority of Iranians became and have remained Muslims. Today perhaps 98 percent of ethnic Iranians, including the population of Persia, are at least nominal Muslims. For such a fundamental, pervasive, and enduring cultural transformation, the phenomenon of Iranian conversions to Islam has received remarkably little scholarly attention.

Recent research has established a general chronological framework for the process of conversion of Iranians to Islam. From a study of the probable dates of individual conversions based on genealogies in biographical dictionaries, Richard Bulliet has suggested that there was gradual and limited conversion of Persians down to the end of the Umayyad period (132/750), followed by a rapid increase in the number of conversions after the ʿAbbasid revolution, so that by the time when regional dynasties had been established in the east (ca. 338/950) 80 percent or more of Iranians had become Muslims. The data on which Bulliet&#x27;s study was based limited the validity of this paradigm to generalizations about full, formal conversions in an urban environment. The situation in rural areas and individual regions may have been quite different, but the overall pattern is consistent with what can be deduced from traditional historical sources. Although in some areas, for example, Shiraz at the time of Moqaddasi&#x27;s visit in about 375/985 (p. 429), there may still have been strong non-Muslim elements, it is reasonable to suppose that the Persian milieu as a whole became predominantly Islamic within the period of time suggested by Bulliet&#x27;s research.

==== Islamization of Iran ====
Following the Abbasid revolution of 749–51, in which Iranian converts played a major role, the Caliphate&#x27;s center of gravity moved to Mesopotamia and underwent significant Iranian influences. Accordingly, the Muslim population of Iran rose from approx. 40% in the mid 9th century to close to 100% by the end of 11th century. Islam was readily accepted by Zoroastrians who were employed in industrial and artisan positions because, according to Zoroastrian dogma, such occupations that involved defiling fire made them impure. Moreover, Muslim missionaries did not encounter difficulty in explaining Islamic tenets to Zoroastrians, as there were many similarities between the faiths. According to Thomas Walker Arnold, for the Persian, he would meet Ahura Mazda and Ahriman under the names of Allah and Iblis. Muslim leaders in their effort to win converts encouraged attendance at Muslim prayer, and allowed the Quran to be recited in Persian instead of Arabic so that it would be intelligible to all. The first complete translation of the Qur&#x27;an into Persian occurred during the reign of Samanids in the 9th century. Seyyed Hossein Nasr suggests that the rapid increase in conversion was aided by the Persian nationality of the rulers.

According to Bernard Lewis:
&quot;Iran was indeed Islamized, but it was not Arabized. Persians remained Persians. And after an interval of silence, Iran reemerged as a separate, different and distinctive element within Islam, eventually adding a new element even to Islam itself. Culturally, politically, and most remarkable of all even religiously, the Iranian contribution to this new Islamic civilization is of immense importance. The work of Iranians can be seen in every field of cultural endeavor, including Arabic poetry, to which poets of Iranian origin composing their poems in Arabic made a very significant contribution. In a sense, Iranian Islam is a second advent of Islam itself, a new Islam sometimes referred to as &quot;Islam-i Ajam&quot;. It was this Persian Islam, rather than the original Arab Islam, that was brought to new areas and new peoples: to the Turks, first in Central Asia and then in the Middle East in the country which came to be called Turkey, and India. The Ottoman Turks brought a form of Iranian civilization to the walls of Vienna...&quot;

===Iranian influence on Muslim civilization===
The Islamization of Iran was to yield deep transformations within the cultural, scientific, and political structure of Iran&#x27;s society: The blossoming of Persian literature, philosophy, medicine and art became major elements of the newly forming Muslim civilization. Inheriting a heritage of thousands of years of civilization, and being at the &quot;crossroads of the major cultural highways&quot;, contributed to Persia emerging as what culminated into the &quot;Islamic Golden Age&quot;. During this period, hundreds of scholars and scientists vastly contributed to technology, science and medicine, later influencing the rise of European science during the Renaissance.

The most important scholars of almost all of the Islamic sects and schools of thought were Persian or live in Iran including most notable and reliable Hadith collectors of Shia and Sunni like Shaikh Saduq, Shaikh Kulainy, Imam Bukhari, Imam Muslim and Hakim al-Nishaburi, the greatest theologians of Shia and Sunni like Shaykh Tusi, Imam Ghazali, Imam Fakhr al-Razi and Al-Zamakhshari, the greatest physicians, astronomers, logicians, mathematicians, metaphysicians, philosophers and scientists like Al-Farabi, Avicenna, and Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī, the greatest Shaykh of Sufism like Rumi, Abdul-Qadir Gilani.

Ibn Khaldun narrates in his Muqaddimah:

&quot;It is a remarkable fact that, with few exceptions, most Muslim scholars… in the intellectual sciences have been non-Arabs, thus the founders of grammar were Sibawaih and after him, al-Farsi and Az-Zajjaj. All of them were of Persian descent... they invented rules of (Arabic) grammar. Great jurists were Persians. Only the Persians engaged in the task of preserving knowledge and writing systematic scholarly works. Thus the truth of the statement of the prophet (Muhammad) becomes apparent, &quot;&quot;… The intellectual sciences were also the preserve of the Persians, left alone by the Arabs, who did not cultivate them… as was the case with all crafts… This situation continued in the cities as long as the Persians and Persian countries, Iraq, Khorasan and Transoxiana (modern Central Asia), retained their sedentary culture.&quot;

==== Persian vs. Arabic ====

In the 9th and 10th centuries, non-Arab subjects of the Ummah, especially Persians created a movement called Shu&#x27;ubiyya in response to the privileged status of Arabs. This movement led to resurgence of Persian national identity. Although Persians adopted Islam, over the centuries they worked to protect and revive their distinctive language and culture, a process known as Persianization. Arabs and Turks also participated in this attempt.

As the power of the Abbasid caliphs diminished, a series of dynasties rose in various parts of Iran, some with considerable influence and power. Among the most important of these overlapping dynasties were the Tahirids in Khorasan (820–72); the Saffarids in Sistan (867–903); and the Samanids (875–1005), originally at Bokhara. The Samanids eventually ruled an area from central Iran to Pakistan. By the early 10th century, the Abbasids almost lost control to the growing Persian faction known as the Buwayhid dynasty (934–1055). Since much of the Abbasid administration had been Persian anyway, the Buwayhid, who were Zaidi Shia, were quietly able to assume real power in Baghdad.

The Samanid dynasty was the first fully native dynasty to rule Iran since the Muslim conquest, and led the revival of Persian culture. The first important Persian poet after the arrival of Islam, Rudaki, was born during this era and was praised by Samanid kings. The Samanids also revived many ancient Persian festivals. Their successor, the Ghaznawids, who were of non-Iranian Turkic origin, also became instrumental in the revival of Persian.

===Sunni dynasties in Iran===
In 962 a Turkish governor of the Samanids, Alptigin, conquered Ghazna (in present-day Afghanistan) and established a dynasty, the Ghaznavids, that lasted to 1186. Later, the Seljuks, who like the Ghaznavids were Turks, slowly conquered Iran over the course of the 11th century. Their leader, Tughril Beg, turned his warriors against the Ghaznavids in Khorasan. He moved south and then west, conquering but not wasting the cities in his path. In 1055 the caliph in Baghdad gave Tughril Beg robes, gifts, and the title King of the East. Under Tughril Beg&#x27;s successor, Malik Shah (1072–1092), Iran enjoyed a cultural and scientific renaissance, largely attributed to his brilliant Iranian vizier, Nizam al Mulk. These leaders established the Isfahan Observatory where Omar Khayyám did much of his experimentation for a new calendar, and they built religious schools in all the major towns. They brought Abu Hamid Ghazali, one of the greatest Islamic theologians, and other eminent scholars to the Seljuk capital at Baghdad and encouraged and supported their work.

A serious internal threat to the Seljuks during their reign came from the Hashshashin- Ismailis of the Nizari sect, with headquarters at Alamut between Rasht and Tehran. They controlled the immediate area for more than 150 years and sporadically sent out adherents to strengthen their rule by murdering important officials. Several of the various theories on the etymology of the word &quot;assassin&quot; derive from this group.

Another notable Sunni dynasty were the Timurids. Timur was a Turco-Mongol leader from the Eurasian Steppe, who conquered and ruled in the tradition of Genghis Khan. Under the Timurid Empire, the Turco-Persian tradition which began during the Abbasid period would continue. Ulugh Beg, grandson of Timur, built an observatory of his own, and a grand madrassah at Samarkand.

===Shia dynasties in Iran===

Although Shi&#x27;as have lived in Iran since the earliest days of Islam, the writers of the Four Books of Shi&#x27;a ahadith were Iranians of the pre-Safavid era and there was one Shi&#x27;a dynasty in part of Iran during the tenth and eleventh centuries, according to Mortaza Motahhari the majority of Iranian scholars and masses remained Sunni till the time of the Safavids.

The domination of the Sunni creed during the first nine Islamic centuries characterizes the religious history of Iran during this period. There were however some exceptions to this general domination which emerged in the form of the Zaydīs of Tabaristan, the Buwayhid, the rule of Sultan Muhammad Khudabandah (r. Shawwal 703-Shawwal 716/1304-1316) and the Sarbedaran. Nevertheless, apart from this domination there existed, firstly, throughout these nine centuries, Shia inclinations among many Sunnis of this land and, secondly, original Imami Shiism as well as Zaydī Shiism had prevalence in some parts of Iran. During this period, Shia in Iran were nourished from Kufah, Baghdad and later from Najaf and Hillah.

However, during the first nine centuries there are four high points in the history of this linkage:
* First, the migration of a number of persons belonging to the tribe of the Ash&#x27;ari from Iraq to the city of Qum towards the end of the first/seventh century, which is the period of establishment of Imamī Shī‘ism in Iran.
* Second, the influence of the Shī‘ī tradition of Baghdad and Najaf on Iran during the fifth/eleventh and sixth/twelfth centuries.
* Third, the influence of the school of Hillah on Iran during the eighth/fourteenth century.
* Fourth, the influence of the Shī‘ism of Jabal Amel and Bahrain on Iran during the period of establishment of the Safavid rule.

===Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam===

Due to their history being almost fully intertwined, Iran as well as Azerbaijan are both discussed here. Iran and Azerbaijan were predominantly Sunni until the 16th century. Changes in the religious make-up of nowadays both nations changed drastically from that time and on. In 1500 the Safavid Shah Ismail I undertook the conquering of Iran and Azerbaijan and commenced a policy of forced conversion of Sunni Muslims to Shia Islam. Many Sunnis were murdered. When Shah Ismail I conquered Iraq, Dagestan, Eastern Anatolia, and Armenia he similarly forcefully converted or murdered Sunni Muslims. The oppression and forced conversion of Sunnis would continue, mostly unabated, for the greater part of next two centuries until Iran as well as what is now Azerbaijan became predominantly Shi’ite countries.

As in the case of the early caliphate, Safavid rule had been based originally on both political and religious legitimacy, with the shah being both king and divine representative. With the later erosion of Safavid central political authority in the mid-17th century, the power of the Shia scholars in civil affairs such as judges, administrators, and court functionaries, began to grow, in a way unprecedented in Shi&#x27;ite history. Likewise, the ulama began to take a more active role in agitating against Sufism and other forms of popular religion, which remained strong in Iran, and in enforcing a more scholarly type of Shi&#x27;a Islam among the masses. The development of the ta&#x27;ziah—a passion play commemorating the martyrdom of Imam Husayn and his family — and Ziarat of the shrines and tombs of local Shi&#x27;ite leaders began during this period, largely at the prompting of the Shi&#x27;ite clergy. According to Mortaza Motahhari, the majority of Iranians turned to Shi&#x27;a Islam from the Safavid period onwards. Of course, it cannot be denied that Iran&#x27;s environment was more favorable to the flourishing of the Shi&#x27;a Islam as compared to all other parts of the Muslim world. Shi&#x27;a Islam did not penetrate any land to the extent that it gradually could in Iran. With the passage of time, Iranians&#x27; readiness to practise Shi&#x27;a Islam grew day by day.
It was the Safavids who made Iran the spiritual bastion of Shi’ism against the onslaughts of shi&#x27;as&#x27; by orthodox Sunni Islam, and the repository of Persian cultural traditions and self-awareness of Iranianhood, acting as a bridge to modern Iran. According to Professor Roger Savory:
===Contemporary era: challenges of modernity and rise of Islamism===

During the 20th century Iran underwent significant changes such as the 1906 Constitutional Revolution and the secularism of the Pahlavi dynasty.

According to scholar Roy Mottahedeh, one significant change to Islam in Iran during the first half of the 20th century was that the class of ulema lost its informality that allowed it to include everyone from the highly trained jurist to the &quot;shopkeeper who spent one afternoon a week memorizing and transmitting a few traditions.&quot; Laws by Reza Shah that requiring military service and dress in European-style clothes for Iranians, gave talebeh and mullahs exemptions, but only if they passed specific examinations proving their learnedness, thus excluding less educated clerics.

In addition Islamic Madrasah schools became more like &#x27;professional&#x27; schools, leaving broader education to secular government schools and sticking to Islamic learning. &quot;Ptolemaic astronomy, Avicennian medicines, and the algebra of Omar Khayyam&quot; was dispensed with.

==== Deobandi movement ====

Darul Uloom Deoband was established in 1866 in the Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh, India, as part of the anti-British movement. It gave rise to a traditional conservative Sunni movement known as the Deobandi movement. Students from various regions, including Sistan and Baluchestan in Iran, attended Deoband, which led to the spread of its founders ideas. This movement had a significant impact on some of the new generation of Iranian intellectuals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. After entering Iran, the students of this school continued to expand this thinking and with the formation of missionary groups. These thoughts have been strengthened on one hand due to the cultural relationships between the Baloch tribes and on the other hand due to the connection of Sistan and Baluchestan&#x27;s Iran and India&#x27;s Hanafi religious leaders in Iran. Today, Deobandi thinking is one of the intellectual currents in Sistan and Baluchestan and preaching groups are active in different cities and villages. Its playing a crucial role in Iran&#x27;s political landscape. The Deobandis aimed to homogenize religious schools and were opposed to certain popular practices. The Naqshbandi order played an important role in the Deobandi school of thought in the Persian-speaking world.

==== Islamic Revolution ====
The Iranian Revolution (also known as the Islamic Revolution, Persian: انقلاب اسلامی, &quot;Enghelābe Eslāmi&quot;) was the revolution that transformed Iran from a secular, westernizing monarchy under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, to an Islamic republic based on the doctrine of Velayat-e faqih (rule by an Islamic jurist), under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the revolution and founder of the Islamic Republic. It has been called &quot;the third great revolution in history&quot;, following the French and Russian Revolutions, and an event that &quot;made Islamic fundamentalism a political force ... from Morocco to Malaysia.&quot;

==Modern Iranian Islam==

===Demography===

According to official Islamic Republic figures, 99% of Iranians are Muslims, with the remainder being Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians. A 2020 survey by the World Values Survey found that 96.6% of Iranians believe in Islam. However, according to another 2020 online survey by GAMAAN, there has been a sharp decline in religiosity in Iran (mostly among Islam), and only 40% of Iranians who took part of the online survey identified as Muslims.

Figures in the census taken by the Islamic Republic do not include Baháʼís (who are not recognized as a religious group in the Iranian Constitution) or whether a Muslim is Sunni or Shia, but estimates are that there are 300,000 Baháʼís, and approximately 15 million Sunnis, making the former group the largest non-Muslim minority in Iran.

===The Islamic Republic===

Iran&#x27;s government was, until recently, unique in having Shi&#x27;i Islam as the state religion. It still is unique in following the theocratic principle of &quot;velayat-e faqih&quot; or &quot;Guardianship of the Islamic jurist&quot;, according to which government must be run in accordance with traditional Islamic &quot;sharia&quot;, and for this to happen a leading Islamic jurist (&quot;faqih&quot;) must provide political &quot;guardianship&quot; (&quot;wilayat&quot; or &quot;velayat&quot;) over the people.
Following the Iranian Revolution, the 1979 Constitution of Islamic Republic of Iran called for a &quot;guardian&quot; to be the Supreme Leader of Iran, and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the revolution and author of the doctrine of &quot;Velayat-e faqih&quot;, became the first Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic.

The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran mandates that the official religion of Iran is Shia Islam and the Twelver Ja&#x27;fari school, though it also mandates that other Islamic schools are to be &quot;accorded full respect&quot;, and their followers are free to act in accordance with their own jurisprudence in performing their religious rites. According to the constitution, high level officials such as the Supreme Leader, president, and members of the powerful Assembly of Experts that chooses the leader must be Twelver Shia.

It lists Zoroastrian, Jewish, and Christian Iranians as &quot;the only recognized religious minorities, who, within the limits of the law, are free to perform their religious rites and ceremonies, and to act according to their own canon in matters of personal affairs and religious education.&quot; Consequently, to avail oneself of many of the rights of citizenship in the Islamic Republic of Iran, on must declare oneself as a member of one of the four recognized faiths—Muslims, Zoroastrians, Jews and Christians.
This official division ignores other religious minorities in Iran, notably those of the Baháʼí Faith. State sanctioned persecution of Bahá’ís follows from them being a &quot;non-recognized&quot; religious minority without any legal existence, classified as &quot;unprotected infidels&quot; by the authorities, and are subject to systematic discrimination on the basis of their beliefs. Similarly, atheism is officially disallowed.

====Perception in Iranian society====
One unanticipated effect of theocratic rule in Iran is that in the last couple of decades up to at least 2018, not only have secular people become alienated from the regime, but the state has lost much of its religious credibility among the ultra-religious communities because of widespread corruption, discrimination and its secularisation. Thus, many ultra-religious people deny the Islamic legitimacy of the government &quot;in toto&quot; and embrace this or that alternative religiosity ... An example of one kind of religious alternative are figures (such as Ahmad al-Hassan), claiming to be deputies of the Hidden Imam.

In July 2018, following the protests, University of Maryland&#x27;s School of Public Policy released a report, &quot;Iranian Public Opinion after the Protests&quot;, and when the respondents were asked if &quot;Iran’s political system needs to undergo fundamental change&quot; the researchers noted that &quot;over three in four disagreed (77%) with a majority doing so strongly (54%)&quot; with only 5% &quot;agreeing strongly&quot;. They further found out that &quot;a substantial, if lesser, majority (67%) did not agree that “the government interferes too much in people’s personal lives” (30%, strongly), and 59% did not accept the idea that “the government should not be strict in enforcing Islamic laws” (33%, strongly)&quot;, with only 22% agreeing strongly and 15% somewhat agreeing with the idea that the government should not be strict in enforcing Islamic laws.

In 2023, Raz Zimmt, an expert on Iran attached to Israel&#x27;s Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), quoting Iranian sociologist Hamidreza Jalaeipour, argued that 70% of Iranians fall into the category of &quot;silent pragmatist traditionalist majority&quot;, which is defined as those who &quot;might approve of religion and aspects of the regime, while rejecting enforced religion and other aspects of the regime.&quot;

====Shia majority====
According to The World Factbook of the CIA, between 90-95% of Iran&#x27;s Muslim are Shia, and another 5-10% are Sunni, 
the American Iranian Council, citing the Islamic Republic estimates, gives the Sunni percentage at between 7% and 10%. (Almost all of Iran&#x27;s Shia follow the Twelver branch.)
The Atlantic Council gives a higher percentage of Sunni, saying &quot;Sunni leaders and observers&quot; put the Sunni population of Iran &quot;between 12 and 25 percent&quot;.

====Sunni minority====
Most of the Sunni in Iran are Kurds, Achomi Persians, Khorasani Persians, Turkmens, Arabs, Talysh and Baloch, living in the northwest, northeast, south and southeast, respectively, the provinces of West Azerbaijan, Kurdistan and Kermanshah, Golestan and North Khorasan, and Sistan and Baluchestan. A majority of Lari people and Talysh, a part of Kurds, virtually all Baluchis and Turkomans, and a minority of Persians, Arabs and Lurs are Sunnis.

The mountainous region of Larestan is mostly inhabited by indigenous Sunni Persians who did not convert to Shia Islam during the Safavids because the mountainous region of Larestan was too isolated. The majority of Lari people are Sunni Muslims, 35% of Lari people are Shia Muslims. 

Shia clergy tend to view missionary work among Sunnis to convert them to Shi&#x27;a Islam as a worthwhile religious endeavor. In those towns with mixed populations in the Persian Gulf region, and Sistan and Baluchistan, tensions between Shi&#x27;as and Sunnis existed both before and after the Revolution. Religious tensions have been highest during major Shi&#x27;a observances, especially Muharram.

Sunnis have complained that hard-liners in the IRI regime oppose equal rights for Sunnis. When a Sunni was being considered for a position on the Iranian parliament&#x27;s presiding board, one &quot;influential&quot; Ayatollah Vahid Khorasani threatened to write a fatwa delegitimizing the assembly “if a Sunni was installed above Shias.” Despite that, various high ranks have been won by the Sunnis in recent years, including a cabinet member and the top commander of the Iranian navy sine 2021.

Among specific Sunni political complaints are that:
*Article 12 of the constitution, which grants them &quot;certain rights, such as full freedom of worship&quot;, have been &quot;consistently ignored&quot;; and
*Article 115, which forbids anyone but a Shia Muslim from becoming president, has not been repealed; *directives made by the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei on behalf of the Sunni (such as making it illegal to insult Muhammad&#x27;s wife Aisha or a September 2017 call to end discrimination against Sunnis and minority groups in general) have not been enforced.
*They have not been allowed to construct mosques for Sunni worship in larger cities, such as the capital Tehran, where there are an estimated one million Sunnis. (&quot;The government claimed in 2015 that Tehran had nine Sunni mosques, but prominent Sunnis say these are merely prayer rooms.&quot;)
*examination by &quot;Herasat&quot;, a branch of the Intelligence Ministry &quot;tasked with ensuring that applicants are loyal to the regime&quot;. An example of the result is that 90% of high school teachers and 70% of elementary teachers are Shia in areas heavily populated by ethnic Baluchi Sunnis.

===Religious institutions===
====Mosques====
Historically, the most important religious institution in Iran has been the mosque. In towns and cities, congregational prayers, as well as prayers and rites associated with religious observances and important phases in Muslim life, took place in mosques. Primarily an urban phenomenon, mosques did not exist in most Iranian villages. In the years preceding the Revolution, Iranian Shias generally attached diminishing significance to institutional religion, and by the 1970s there was little emphasis on mosque attendance, even for the Friday congregational prayers. During the Revolution, however, mosques in large cities played a prominent social role in organizing people
for large demonstrations. Since that time, the mosques have continued to play important political and social roles, in addition to their traditional religious functions. At the same time, weekly mosque attendance rate in Iran has been very low compared to other Muslim countries. In particular, politicization of Friday prayers under the Islamic Republic has had the paradoxical consequence of discouraging religious people from attending Friday prayers. People who attend prayers tend to have more positive evaluation of the political system than people who do not attend.

====&quot;Hosseiniyeh&quot;====
Another religious institution of major significance has been the hoseiniyeh, or Islamic center. Wealthy patrons financed construction of hoseiniyehs in urban areas to serve as sites for recitals and performances commemorating the martyrdom of Hussein, especially during the month of Moharram. In the 1970s, hoseiniyehs such as the Hoseiniyeh Irshad in Tehran became politicized as prominent clerical and lay preachers helped to lay the groundwork for the Revolution by referring to the symbolic deaths as martyrs of Hussein and the other imams in veiled but obvious criticism of Mohammad Reza Shah&#x27;s regime.

====Islamic schools====
Institutions providing religious education include madrassas, or seminaries, and maktabs, or primary schools run by the clergy. The madrassas historically were important settings for advanced training in Shia theology and jurisprudence. Each madrassa generally was associated with a noted Shia scholar who had attained the rank of ayatollah. Some older madrassas functioned like religious universities at which several scholars taught diverse religious and secular subjects. Students, or talabehs, lived on the grounds of the madrassas and received stipends for the duration of their studies, usually a minimum of seven years, during which they prepared for the examinations that qualify a seminary student to be a low-level preacher, or mullah. At the time of the Revolution, there were slightly more than 11,000 talabehs in Iran, approximately 60 percent of them at the madrassas in Qom. From 1979 to 1982, the number of talabehs in Qom more than tripled from 6,500 to over 20,000. As of the early 2000s, there were just under 25,000 talabehs at all levels of study in Qom seminaries, as well as about 12,000 talabehs at seminaries in other Iranian cities.

Maktabs started to decline in number and importance in the first decades of the twentieth century, once the government began developing a national public school system. Nevertheless, maktabs continued to exist as private religious schools until the Revolution. Because the overall emphasis of public schools has remained secular subjects, since 1979 maktabs have continued to serve children whose parents want them to have a more religious education.

====Clergy====
In 2003, Abbas William Samii estimated that there are 90,000 (the estimate of media observers) to 300,000 (estimate of European sources) clerics in Iran, with, at the time, 40,000 students at the religious seminaries. To this he add 60,000 &quot;people with no formal training or qualifications who acted as urban preachers, rural prayer leaders, and procession organizers.&quot; As for the numbers of seminaries, Qom alone had 60. Abbas Djavadi estimates that after the 1979 revolution, &quot;more than 200,000 mullahs&quot; became &quot;receivers of government salaries and benefits&quot;.

====Shrines====
Another major religious institution in Iran is the shrine. Pilgrimage to the shrines of imams is a specific Shia custom, undertaken because Shia pilgrims believe that the imams and their relatives have the power to intercede with God on behalf of petitioners. Of the more than 1,100 shrines in Iran, the most important are those for the Eighth Imam, Ali al-Ridha, in Mashhad and for his sister Fatimah bint Musa in Qom, and for Seyyed Rouhollah Khomeini in Tehran. Each of these is a huge complex that includes the mausoleum of the venerated one, tombs of various notables, mosques, madrassas, and libraries. Imam Reza&#x27;s shrine is considered the holiest. In addition to the usual shrine accoutrements, it comprises hospitals, dispensaries, a museum, and several mosques located in a series of courtyards surrounding the imam&#x27;s tomb. The shrine&#x27;s endowments and gifts are the largest of all religious institutions in the country. Although there are no special times for visiting this or other shrines, it is customary for pilgrimage traffic to be heaviest during Shia holy periods. Visitors represent all socioeconomic levels. Whereas piety is a motivation for many, others come to seek the spiritual grace or general good fortune that a visit to the shrine is believed to ensure. Since the nineteenth century, it has been customary among the bazaar class and members of the lower classes to recognize those who have made a pilgrimage to Mashhad by prefixing their names with the title mashti. Shrine authorities have estimated that at least 4 million pilgrims visit the shrine annually in the early 2000s. There are also important secondary shrines for other relatives of the Eighth Imam in Tehran and Shiraz. In virtually all towns and in many villages, there are numerous lesser shrines, known as imamzadehs, that commemorate descendants of the imams who are reputed to have led saintly lives. In Iraq the shrines at Karbala and An Najaf also are revered by Iranian Shias. Pilgrimages to these shrines and the hundreds of local mamzadehs are undertaken to petition the saints to grant special favors or to help one through a period of troubles. The constant movement of pilgrims from all over Iran has helped bind together a linguistically heterogeneous population. Pilgrims serve as major sources of information about conditions in different parts of the country and thus help to mitigate the
parochialism of the regions.

====&quot;Waqf&quot;====

The vaqf is a traditional source of financial support for all religious institutions. It is a religious endowment by which land and other income-producing property is given in perpetuity for the maintenance of a shrine, mosque, madrassa, or charitable institution such as a hospital, library, or orphanage. A mutavalli administers a vaqf in accordance with the stipulations in the donor&#x27;s bequest. In many vaqfs, the position of mutavalli is hereditary. Under the Pahlavis, the government attempted to exercise control over administration of the vaqfs, especially those of the larger shrines. This practice caused conflict with the clergy, who perceived the government&#x27;s efforts as inimical
to their influence and authority in traditional religious matters. The government&#x27;s interference with the administration of vaqfs during the Pahlavi era led to a sharp decline in the number of vaqf bequests. Instead, wealthy and pious Shias chose to give financial contributions directly to the leading ayatollahs in the form of zakat, or obligatory alms. The clergy, in turn, used the funds to administer their madrassas and to institute various educational and charitable programs, which indirectly provided them with more influence in society. The access of the clergy to a steady and independent source of funding was an important factor in their ability to resist state controls, and ultimately helped them direct the opposition to the shah.

<text>Magdalena, officially the Municipality of Magdalena (), is a municipality in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 27,816 people.

==History==
Magdalena was formerly a barrio of Majayjay. A petition from the residents of the barrio for the creation of a new town was presented on September 15, 1819. It was proclaimed a new town by Governor General Don Mariano Fernández de Folgueras on January 18, 1820, and was originally named &quot;Magdalena de Ambling&quot;. The name was derived from its patron saint Maria Magdalena and the barrio of Ambling where it was established. The first Teniente Alcalde or Capitan (the highest political authority in a town) was Don Mauricio San Mateo.

They first established a makeshift school in 1820, which was the very first requirement for it to be a town. The municipal hall was also constructed. A small chapel was also constructed and it gave way to the construction of a church in 1829. The church was made of stones and bricks and donations were solicited from the residents. The construction was finished in 1861. The construction of the concrete town hall and the church convent started in 1871 and was finished in 1884.

The revolt against the Spaniards in this area started on November 13, 1896, when the male residents joined the revolutionaries from the province to form a bigger force. It was during one of the encounters that Emilio Jacinto was wounded and sought refuge at the Catholic Church.

Emilio Aguinaldo, then, proclaimed the first Philippine Republic and the Spaniards finally surrendered on September 1, 1898, and celebrations followed.

The arrival of the Americans, at the turn of the century, witnessed the evacuation of the townsfolk to the mountains for fear of being killed, later returned to the Poblacion seeing that the foreigners were well-intentioned.

The Americans enforced a new system of government. Election of government officials was conducted regularly. The first elected President Municipal was Don Victor Crisostomo. It was during this time that rebels, called &quot;tulisan&quot;, formed a force to oppose the foreign rule. They robbed the house of the residents. This made the Americans very strict on the social life of the people, prohibiting them from leaving the Poblacion and talking to each other publicly. It was on June 15, 1929, that electricity was introduced in the municipality. Life continued under the American regime and to an extent, introduced their own culture to the Filipinos until the Second World War broke out in 1941.

In 1945, Filipino troops of the 4th, 42nd, 43rd, 45th and 46th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 4th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary liberated the towns in Magdalena, Laguna. The Japanese surrendered to the Filipino soldiers and guerrillas on May 25, 1945, thus, Magdalena, as well as the Philippines, was liberated from the Japanese army. After the war, they returned to the Poblacion and started their lives from what was left of the war.

Post-World War II, Magdalena became a preferred shooting location for numerous films, including &quot;The Ravagers&quot; (also known as &quot;Only the Brave Know Hell&quot;), and the popular teleserye &quot;Wildflower&quot;.

===The Kawayan Festival===
Magdalena recently held its first Kawayan Festival to mark the town&#x27;s 185th Foundation Day. The colorful festival celebrates the native bamboo and its role in the culture and livelihood of the town and to promote bamboo-based industries.

Liga ng mga Barangay national president James Marty Lim was special guest at the festival, and together with Magdalena town officials led by Mayor David Aventurado Jr., congratulated the Magdaleños for their initiatives to promote the local bamboo industry.

However, no such bamboo enterprise visibly exists in the town.

===St. Mary Magdalene Parish Church===
St. Mary Magdalene Church was constructed from 1851 to 1871 and made of stones and bricks with a sandstone façade. The church is located at the town center or plaza, just across the municipal town hall of Magdalena. In February 1898, after being wounded in a battle with the Spaniards at the Maimpis River, Philippine revolutionary hero Emilio Jacinto sought refuge in this church. His bloodstains were found on the floor of the church. Magdalena is Also called &quot;Little Hollywood Of Laguna&quot; because it is the home of approximately 100 films.

===The Bahay Laguna===
Bahay Laguna is a museum in Barangay Bungkol that houses the memorabilia of Felicisimo San Luis, who served as Governor of Laguna province for 33 years. During his time, he was known as the &quot;Living Legend of Laguna.&quot; Aside from the memorabilia of then governor, Bahay Laguna showcases the specialty crafts and signature products of Laguna towns such as woodcarving of Paete and bottled preserved fruits of Alaminos.

The construction of Bahay Laguna was finished in December 1995. The Dr. Floro Brosas Foundation donated a piece of its land for this repository.

===Magdalena Water System===
Working under the belief that potable water must be accessible to all,Magdalena successfully implemented the LGU Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project (LGU-UWSSP) in their locality.

In years past, the municipality operated the Magdalena Waterworks, a water supply system which covered ten barangays. The main water source was the Oples Spring in the nearby town of Liliw, Laguna, supplying a volume of per second to 1,097 service connections. Tariff was for the first and an additional in excess of 10 cubic meters.

However, the people were not keen on increasing the tariff, as the service was extremely poor. Believing that water is one of the basic services that the government should be able to provide to the people, the LGU consequently searched for a more permanent solution. Through the DILG and World Bank, the Local Government Unit Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project (LGUUWSSP) was introduced to Magdalena officials. Through barangay meetings and consultations, the LGU water project and how it will help address their problems were explained to the people.

With the creation of the Municipal Water Board in August 2004, the water system was also constructed and became fully operational within a period of one year and six months. The Water Board is at present focused in the expansion of the service area to provide quality water service to the nearby barangays. Moreover, the board is continuously producing policies to help the project be a self-sufficient and profitable economic enterprise for the LGU.

With the successful implementation of the LGU-UWSSP, there have been marked improvements in the water supply and living conditions of the people in the community. All stakeholders in the municipality benefitted from the improved water system. From the previous practice of rationing water, a 24/7 supply has been established, contributing to the improved health of the citizenry.

<text>Fred Rouhling (born 24 January 1970) is a French rock climber and boulderer, noted for creating and repeating some of the earliest grade sport climbing routes in the world, including &quot;Hugh&quot; in 1993, the first-ever French sport route. Rouhling is also known for the controversy from his proposed grading of for his 1995 route &quot;&quot;, which would have made it the world&#x27;s first-ever 9b-graded sport route; 25 years later, it was graded at .

==Early life==
Rouhling grew up in the small French farming town of Le Panissaud. His neighboring village of Vilhonneur has a limestone quarry (which supplied materials for the Statue of Liberty). Twenty minutes away is the larger town of Angoulême, where limestone crags overhang many of the roads, with the best-known being Les Eaux Claires (&quot;The Clear Waters&quot;), with 15 to 20-metre overhanging extreme routes that require strong fingers to manage the small pockets used to ascend them; and contains nationally-regarded extreme routes such as &quot;La Crépinette&quot; (1983), France&#x27;s first . Rouhling began to climb in school, and by age 19 was climbing at when the world&#x27;s hardest routes were then at .

==Climbing career==

===&quot;Hugh&quot;, first 9a in France===
In the early 1990s, Rouhling had moved to the south of France for college where he also had access to the leading sport climbing venues of France. Rouhling made the first ascent of &quot;UFO&quot;, the first in the Calanques, and then completed &quot;Les Spécialistes Direct&quot; at the Verdon Gorge. &quot;Les Spécialistes Direct&quot; was a variation on Jean-Baptiste Tribout&#x27;s famous 1987 route, &quot;Les Spécialistes&quot;, which was bolted earlier by Alain Robert; with the downgrade of &quot;Les Spécialistes&quot; to 8b+, Rouhling&#x27;s ascent remains the first 8c route in the gorge.

Returning home in 1993, Rouhling wanted to create different routes from the long steep stamina crimpy routes of the Calanques and Verdon. At his local crag of Eaux-Clairs, he freed a line he called &quot;Hugh&quot; with a double-overhanging bulge that required little footwork. Having climbed it, he made the route harder by filling in holds and chipping-out new ones that he graded at . At the time, there were only three known 9a routes in the world. &quot;Hugh&quot; was repeated in 2001, and by Dai Koyamada (2002), and Sébastien Bouin (2020), confirming the grade of 9a, the first 9a in France.

The use of chipping to create new extreme routes was not uncommon then in France, and included examples such as &#x27;s famous Buoux route, &quot;La Rose et la Vampire&quot; . Some major North American routes also relied on chipped holds for their development, with examples such as &quot;The Phoenix&quot; in Yosemite, and &quot;Just do It&quot; at Smith Rocks. In a 2021 documentary, Rouhling said that finding natural new hard routes is difficult (particularly of the overhanging roof style that he was attracted to) and that the chipping of new &quot;hardest&quot; routes was far more widespread than was understood; Rouhling also noted that other leading French climbers had manufactured such routes in their own local quarries for their development and training.

===&quot;Akira&quot; controversy===
Home again in 1995 as his wife was recovering from back surgery, Rouhling began work on a new route he called &quot;&quot; in the Vilhonneur quarry. &quot;Akira&quot; was a 65-foot long low horizontal roof (only circa 12 feet off the ground), that he estimated had an bouldering problem, with a final 20-foot vertical section beyond the lip (the only part for which he used a rope); such a route was unprecedented as a sport climb at the time. On completing &quot;Akira&quot;, belayed by his recovered wife, Rouhling graded it at . At the time, nobody had climbed 9a+ (Chris Sharma would climb the world&#x27;s first consensus 9a+ in 2001, and the first consensus 9b in 2008). In 1997, Rouhling added another chipped route at Eaux Claire, &quot;L&#x27;autre côté du Ciel&quot;, a spectacular high roof, that he graded at .

Rouhling faced an unprecedented level of personalized attack for &quot;Akira&quot;. Leading climbers publicly challenged his integrity, and various unsubstantiated theories were promoted about Rouhling and his routes. Those that tried &quot;Akira&quot;, failed to climb it. In 2004, &quot;Climbing&quot; sent Pete Ward (a future American Alpine Club Board member), to interview Rouhling over several days, and see him on his routes. Ward could not opine on the grade but verified that Rouhling was able to climb his routes as they were. Ward also believed that Rouhling should have classed &quot;Akira&quot; as a boulder problem rather than as a sport route. Ward was able to debunk several of the criticisms about Rouhling and &quot;Akira&quot;, and expressed a positive view of Rouhling from the interview process.

In 2020, Seb Bouin climbed three of Rouhling&#x27;s routes in his local crags and found two of their grades accurate at 9a (&quot;Hugh&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;autre côté du Ciel&quot;), however, he felt &quot;Akira&quot; was also a &quot;hard 9a&quot;, and that the roof was at . Bouin said: &quot;Anyway this route is hard&quot;, &quot;and quite unbelievable for the 90&#x27;s&quot;. Rouhling was disappointed at the downgrade and felt that the requirement to hang from a pinch hold in the roof at the first crux, while familiar in contemporary extreme routes, was novel in 1995, and was why no climber of his generation could send the route. In 2021, the climbing database &quot;8a.nu&quot; agreed that changes in equipment and techniques for roof climbing could explain much of the downgrade. In 2022, climbing author Sam Anderson attributed some of the vilification of Rouhling to the fact that at the time, he was not considered &quot;the world&#x27;s best climber&quot;, and thus would not be accepted as the person who climbed &quot;the world&#x27;s hardest route&quot;.

===Return to climbing===
After &quot;Akira&quot;, Rouhling&#x27;s wife Celine needed brain surgery for a life-threatening illness, and Rouhling largely abandoned extreme climbing for a number of years to focus on his family and young children. In 2001, on his wife&#x27;s recovery, Rouhling repeated Fred Nicole&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, that – after Fred&#x27;s brother François – was the second-ever repeat of a 9a-graded route in history. In 2002 and 2003, Rouhling visited Switzerland&#x27;s leading bouldering areas repeating several of Fred Nicole&#x27;s most notable problems including several up to (e.g. &quot;Eau Profonde&quot;), and one at , with &quot;E la nave va&quot;.

In 2004, Rouhling established his fourth route above 9a with &quot;Mandallaz Drive&quot; at , and in 2007 he added a fifth with &quot;Salamandre&quot; at . Rouhling did not use any chipping to create these new routes, they were natural. In 2007 Rouhling went on bouldering trips with French climber Romain Desgranges to Rocklands, South Africa and to Joshua Tree, California. In 2010, the pair went on a bouldering trip to New Zealand where Rouhling repeated Chris Sharma&#x27;s 2005 problem, &quot;Archilles last stand&quot; , which was Rouhling&#x27;s 100th boulder ascent above .

In 2009, one of the main online databases for extreme rock climbers, &quot;8a.nu&quot;, asked the question &quot;Is Fred Rouhling the best ever FA [first ascent] climber in the world?&quot;, noting that Rouhling&#x27;s combination of first ascents for the hardest sport climbs and hard bouldering routes ranked him #3 in their All-Time High Combined rankings.

In a 2021 interview, Rouhling said that he then only climbed a few times a year and that while as a climber, he was very disappointed with the reception to his 9a routes, as an artist (he sculpts in his spare time), he was very proud of his creations, and the emotions and engagement that they still aroused in the climbing community.

==Personal life==
Rouhling is married to Céline with whom they have two children, Hugo and Chloe. 

Rouhling sculpts in his spare time.

==Notable ascents==

=== Redpointed routes ===

:* &quot;Salamandre&quot; – Double Cache crag, Saint-Pierre-en-Faucigny (FRA) – 2007. First ascent (natural route, no chipping). First repeat by Baptiste Dherbilly in 2017.

:* &quot;Mandallaz Drive&quot; – Allonzier-la-Caille, (FRA) – 2004. First ascent (natural route, no chipping). First repeat by Baptiste Dherbilly in 2021.

:*&quot;&quot; – Saint Loup, (CHF) – 2001. Third ascent of Fred Nicole&#x27;s 1993 route; at the time of Rouhling&#x27;s ascent, there were only four known 9a routes in the world.

:* &quot;L&#x27;autre côté du Ciel&quot; – Les Eaux-Claires (Charente), (FRA) – 1997. First ascent. Rouhling almost entirely manufactured the route by chipping out the holds (a practice at the time but since shunned). First repeat by in 2020 who agreed it was 9a, but felt that a kneepad (which he did not use) could make it easier.

:* &quot;&quot; – Vilhonneur (Charente), (FRA) – 1995. First ascent. Rouhling used some chipping and hold filling to create the route. He estimated it at 9b, the world&#x27;s first-ever 9b (and even 9a+) at the time, and created one of the most famous grading disputes in sport climbing history. First repeat by and Lucien Martinez in 2020 who assigned the route a &quot;hard 9a&quot; grade.

:*&quot;Hugh&quot; – Les Eaux-Claires (Charente), (FRA) – 1993. First ascent. First-ever French 9a-graded sport route and fourth 9a in the world. Rouhling chipped out some new holds and filled in others to create the route. First repeat by (2001), with many others including Dai Koyamada in 2002, and in 2020 who also confirmed the grade of 9a.

:* &quot;Empreinte&quot; – Double Cache crag, Saint-Pierre-en-Faucigny (FRA) – 2008. First ascent (natural route, no chipping). Rouhling proposed 9a+; first repeat by Baptiste Dherbilly in 2021 said 8c+.
:*&quot;Non à la Bombe &quot; – Saint Loup, (CHF) – 2001. Repeat of Fred Nicole&#x27;s 1995 route. 
:*&quot;Archipel&quot; – Les Eaux-Claires (Charente), (FRA) – 1997. First ascent. First repeat by Dai Koyamada and Yuji Hirayama in 2000 (and first repeat of any Rouhling route above 8c+) who confirmed grade.
:*&quot;Kami&quot; – Les Eaux-Claires (Charente), (FRA) – 1994. First ascent. First repeat by Pierre Bollinger in 2001.

:* &quot;La voie du Charpentier&quot; – Allonzier-la-Caille (FRA) – 2005. First ascent.
:* &quot;Les Spécialistes Direct&quot; – Verdon Gorge (FRA) – 1994. First ascent, and first 8c in the Verdun Gorge. Variation of Jean-Baptiste Tribout&#x27;s famous 1987 8b+ route, bolted by Alain Robert.
:* &quot;UFO&quot; – Massif des Calanques (FRA) – 1993. First ascent.

=== Boulder problems ===

:*&quot;E la nave va&quot; (Traverse) – Lindental, (SUI) – 2003. First repeat of Fred Nicole&#x27;s 1994 boulder traverse problem.

:*&quot;Eau Profonde&quot; – Kesslerloch, Schaffhausen, (SUI) – 2003(e). First repeat of Fred Nicole&#x27;s 1997 boulder problem.
:*&quot;Broadsword&quot; (Traverse) – Lindental, (SUI) – 2003. Repeat of Fred Nicole&#x27;s 1995 boulder traverse problem.
:*&quot;Va piu via&quot; (Traverse) – Lindental, (SUI) – 2003. Repeat.
:*&quot;Joyeux Leon&quot; (Traverse) – La Balmaz, (SUI) – 2003. Repeat of Fred Nicole&#x27;s 1992 boulder traverse problem.
:*&quot;Le voyage du Crabe&quot; (Traverse) – Saint-George, (SUI) – 2003. Repeat.

<doc id="1275624" wikidata="Q3346553" url="?curid=1275624" title="Titumir">
<text>Syed Mir Nisar Ali (27 January 1782 – 19 November 1831), better known as Titumir, was one of the first Bengali revolutionaries in British India who developed a strand of Islamic revivalism, sometimes also for Bengali nationalism coupled with agrarian and political consciousness. He is famed for having built a large bamboo fort to resist the British, which passed into Bengali folk legend.

Titumir was ranked number 11 in the BBC&#x27;s poll of the Greatest Bengali of All Time.

==Early life==
Titumir was born as &quot;Syed Mīr Nisār ʿAlī&quot; on 27 January 1782 (14 Magh 1182), in the village of Haidarpur or Chandpur per some sources — to Syed Mir Hasan Ali and Abidah Ruqayyah Khatun. The family claimed Sayyid ancestry, tracing their descent from Caliph Ali; Syed Shahadat Ali had migrated to Bengal to preach Islam, and his son, Syed Abdullah, was appointed as the Chief Qadi of Jafarpur by the Emperor of Delhi.

Titumir was educated in a local madrasa, where he became a &quot;hafiz&quot; of the Quran by the age of twenty, besides being accomplished in Bengali, Arabic, and Persian. A good wrestler and gymnast, he served as the bodyguard of a local zamindar for some time. However, Titumir was jailed on account of a conflict with zamindars for high taxes from farmers and upon release, in 1822, left his job to embark upon &quot;Hajj&quot;.

==Religio-political activism==
=== Islamic resurgence ===
In Mecca, Titumir was influenced by the Islamist preacher Syed Ahmad Barelvi, an Indian Muslim revivalist, who advocated for Indian Freedom Movement and strict enforcement of free Land form Zaminders , whose followers founded the Barelvi movement.

Upon return from Mecca, he began to mobilize the Muslim peasantry of his native place by preaching against aspects of Islam that were seen as deviations from the Quran and Sunnah —charging of interest on loans, etc. were all frowned upon — and declaring the zamindars — who were mostly, Bengali Hindus — to be in cahoots with the Company regime, who was blamed for promoting these deviations by overthrowing the Islamic rule. Titumir&#x27;s fatwas penetrated into the social life, as well: men were to have beards with trimmed moustaches and women adorn burqas instead of saris; those who did not abide by were to be boycotted.

The lowest classes of the Bengali Muslim society responded favorably but his emphasis on Islamic fundamentalism ensured negligible support from Hindu peasantry. However, the Zamindar community, irrespective of religion, objected to his activities.

=== Confrontation with zamindars ===
In June 1830, Krishnadeva Rai, the Zamindar of Punra — in some sources, alternately described as the Talukdar of Sarfarazpur — imposed an annual tax similar to jizya on all bearded Muslims subjects to combat increase in radicalism among them caused by Titumir&#x27;s preaching. On Titumir&#x27;s advice, the peasants refused to pay and an enraged Krishnadeva led a bevy of armed men on a spree of arson, even destroying a local mosque. The Muslims reciprocated but the melee remained inconclusive; complaints were filed at the Baduria police station by both sides and eventually, the subdivisional magistrate of Barasat dismissed the issue but only after getting a declaration from the peasants about committing to peace.

Buoyed up by the lack of any punishment for Krishnadeva, fellow Zamindars — Ramnarayan Nag Chaudhuri of Taragonia and Guru Prasad Chowdhury of Nagarpur — instituted similar tax-regime on their subjects and imprisoned dissenters. The peasants organised themselves and sued the Zamindars but to little avail. This led Titu to advocate for a full-fledged armed resistance against what he felt to be the nexus of Zamindars and Company; Atis Dasgupta, a scholar of peasant rebellions in early colonial India, notes that here onward, what was essentially a socio-religious agitation against misrule of Hindu zamindars morphed into a political-economic class-struggle against British rule.

=== Confrontations with the Company and Zamindars ===
Titumir shifted his base from Chandpur to Narikelberia, and began organizing an armed militia. In October 1830, one of his declarations proclaimed him to be the natural sovereign of the country, who — rather than the Company — had a unilateral right of remittance on local revenues collected by zamindars; a Muslim landholder was raided in the same month for having disobeyed him.

On 31 October, Titumir set out to avenge a Bengali Hindu zamindar called Krishnadeva along with 300 armed followers; his residence was ransacked, establishments of Hindu moneylenders in the local market were set on fire, and a cow was slaughtered in front of a Hindu temple in an act of desecration to avenge the previously mentioned demolition of the mosque. In response, the Hindu zamindars, outraged at the inflammatory activities of the Muslims formed an alliance with the British indigo planters to render mutual assistance in case of assaults by Titumir&#x27;s militia. Soon Kaliprasanna Mukherjee, the zamindar of Habra-Gobardanga and a key member of the alliance, was targeted and though Davies, manager of a nearby plantation at Mollahati, came to aid with about 200 men, they were soundly defeated. Davies escaped narrowly and was sheltered by Debnath Roy, the zamindar of Gobra-Gobindapur; this precipitated a confrontation between Titumir&#x27;s militia and Debnath&#x27;s forces at Laughati in Nadia, where the latter was killed. Several Indigo plantations were subsequently set on fire.

The month of November was replete with such cases and the local police proved to be of little use in the face of increasing peasant resistance; many of the Zamindars fled to Kolkata. The Commissioner of the Presidency Division was solicited to tackle the situation, and accordingly, on 15 November 1830, Alexander, the Joint Magistrate of Barasat — along with Ramram Chakraborti, Officer-In-Charge of Baduria Thana — set out for Titumir with a force of 120 policemen. Outnumbered by a 500-strong militia, they were defeated; Alexander barely escaped to a neighboring village while Ramram perished alongside 14 others.

=== Self-rule ===
By 1831, there was a political vacuum in large parts of the Parganas, and Titumir capitalized on it, styling himself as the &quot;Badshah&quot; and having thousands of low-caste Hindu and Muslim peasants among his followers. People loyal to him were installed in official positions — his nephew Ghulam Masum Khan served as the &quot;Senapati&quot;, Muizz ad-Din as the &quot;Wazir&quot; etc. — and zamindars were compelled to either submit to his rule or vacate the land-holdings.

==== Final battle ====
On the evening of 18 November 1831, Major Scott, Lieutenant Shakespeare, and Major Sutherland led a military column — composed of a cavalry unit and an infantry unit, having 300 armed personnel and two cannons — to lay a siege to Titumir&#x27;s fort. Nothing of significance transpired until the next morning when a concerted ammunition charge was mounted. The resistance was breached in about three hours, with the fort giving way to cannons.

Titumir was bayoneted to death, as were 50 fellow soldiers. About 800 others were arrested and tried at Alipur Court; Golam Masum was hanged in front of the ruins of the fort, and about 140 had to serve prison terms of varying lengths. The commanding officer of the British forces not only noted Titumir&#x27;s bravery in dispatches to London but also commented on the strength and resilience of bamboo as a material for fortification, since he had had to pound the fort with artillery for a surprisingly long time.

== Contemporary reception ==
The newspapers and journals run by Englishmen and Christian missionaries took the government-line. Other media controlled by the Bengali Hindu middle class like the &quot;Samachar Chandrika&quot;, Reformer, &quot;Jnananveshan&quot; etc. sided with the zamindars and denounced Titumir as a law-and-order nuisance.

==Legacy==
In 2004, Titumir was ranked number 11 in the BBC&#x27;s poll of the Greatest Bengali of All Time.

;Bangladesh
A play-drama &quot;Titumir-er Basher Kella&quot;, directed by Sheikh Kamal was broadcast in 1967 on Bangladesh Television (then PTV); a graphic novel of the same name was also popular in East Pakistan. In Dhaka, &quot;Jinnah College&quot; was renamed to Government Titumir College in 1971. On 19 November 1992, the 161st anniversary of his death, the Government of Bangladesh issued a commemorative stamp in his honor. The principal base of Bangladesh Navy is named as &#x27;BNS Titumir&#x27;.

;India (West Bengal)
Mahasweta Devi wrote a novella &quot;Titumir&quot; that sought to recover subaltern history. In 1978, Utpal Dutt directed an agitprop drama &quot;Titumir&quot; which critiqued the crude representation of Titumir in colonial historiography; it received critical acclaim and was commercially successful. Titumir metro station on Kolkata Metro Orange Line was named after him which was later changed to City Centre II in 2021. The main bus stand at Chapadali intersection in Barasat town of North 24 Parganas has been named &quot;Titumir Central Bus Terminal&quot;.

<text>A battle ensign is the name given to a large war ensign (flag) hoisted on a warship&#x27;s mast just before going into battle.

In what could become a very confusing situation with thick clouds of gunsmoke the ensign gave additional identification, hence their large size, which for the Royal Navy in the 17th and 18th centuries was about . It was commonly accepted that so long as a ship flew its ensign it was an active participant in battle; prior to action it was an acceptable ruse to fly a false flag.

If a ship surrendered then it would take down its ensign (which was known as striking the colors). This is also the origin of the phrase &quot;To nail one&#x27;s colours to the mast&quot;, showing a determination to fight on and never surrender. In practice, warships would fly more than one battle ensign, so that if the flag was destroyed or brought down during the fighting there would be no confusion. Conversely, keeping the flag flying even though the ship might appear to be past fighting was a sign of determination rather than foolishness. The German battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot; continued to fly its battle ensign even after all its gun batteries had been silenced by British shells, and sank with the ensign still flying.

The battle ensign was seen as an important element for the morale of the crew and was held in high regard. If a warship was sinking and had to be abandoned, flags such as the battle ensigns would be taken off the ship before it sank and were entrusted to the senior (surviving) officer.

Some countries use their national flag as the battle ensign, while others use their naval ensign. Sometimes unique flags were made and used as battle ensigns, for example the one flown by United States Naval Forces at the Battle of Lake Erie in the War of 1812.

The battle ensign is sometimes also flown by U.S. Navy warships as a courtesy when entering or leaving foreign ports, or on national holidays when it is referred to as &quot;Holiday Colors.&quot;

==Examples==
In the United States Navy, battle ensigns from American warships and battle ensigns captured from enemy ships are displayed at the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. The battle ensign flown from USS &quot;Arizona&quot; during the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese Naval Air Forces on December 7, 1941 was badly stained with oil and it was burned as being &#x27;unfit for further use&#x27;, before anyone thought to save it.

From the start of the Naval Battle of Casablanca during Operation Torch, the flew an extra-large battle ensign in the hopes the French Forces would decide not to fight the U.S. Navy. The French decided to fight, and the &quot;Massachusetts&quot; continued to fly the large battle ensign, throughout the battle.

The uses the flag of the New York City Police Department as its battle ensign in commemoration of the actions of the NYPD during the September 11 attacks.

The British National Maritime Museum has in its collection a battle ensign taken from the Spanish &quot;San Ildefonso&quot;, captured at the Battle of Trafalgar which measures .

An ensign from the French &quot;Généreux&quot; of was captured by HMS &quot;Foudroyant&quot; in 1800, and presented by its captain, one time Flag Captain of Lord Nelson, to the City of Norwich.

On 9 November 1914, wore a large Australian National Flag as a battle ensign from the mainmast during her celebrated victory over German warship SMS &quot;Emden&quot; at the Battle of Cocos. The battle was the first naval clash and first victory for the Royal Australian Navy.

In the early days of World War II Captain F. S. Bell of the cruiser gave the order to hoist five 24&#x27; by 12&#x27; (7·32m by 3·66m) battle ensigns from the main topmast, port and starboard yardarms, the top mizzen and the lower mizzen as &quot;Exeter&quot; turned to engage the German pocket battleship &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;, which significantly outgunned her (660lb shells against 256lb shells), during the Battle of the River Plate.

During the battle of the North Cape, after being ordered to close with and engage the German battleship &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; with torpedoes, Captain Skule Storheill of the Norwegian destroyer HNoMS &quot;Stord&quot; ordered the ship&#x27;s battle ensign to be hoisted on the mainmast, so &quot;those bastards can see who they&#x27;re dealing with!&quot;

<text>United States in Prophecy was the original title of a publication that became known by its longer name of United States and British Commonwealth in Prophecy and published in various editions and formats after 1945. It was written under the byline of Herbert W. Armstrong who had assistance from staff members of Ambassador College. The publication related the views, beliefs and teachings of the Worldwide Church of God with regards to the identity of the so-called Ten Lost Tribes of Israel and for many years it was distributed as a companion booklet to &quot;1975 in Prophecy!&quot; by the same author and publisher.

==Origins==
The contents of the booklet were not original and many have claimed by comparison texts that most of its content came from an existing book called &quot;Judah&#x27;s Sceptre and Joseph&#x27;s Birthright&quot; by J. H. Allen which was originally published in 1902. That book claimed to be &quot;An Analysis of the Prophecies of the Scriptures in regard to the Royal Family of Judah and the Many Nations of Israel, the Lost Ten Tribes&quot;.

There are different opinions about the origin of the name Aghdam. According to some sources, the word &quot;Ağdam&quot; means &quot;white castle&quot; in old Turkic. According to this version, Turkic-speaking tribes living in this region in the distant past built small fortresses mainly to defend themselves. Over time, the meaning of the name of the city changed. In the first half of the 18th century, the founder of the Karabakh khanate, Panahali khan, ordered that a white stone building be built for him in this city. For a long time, this building became a kind of icon for the inhabitants of the surrounding villages. In this sense, &quot;Aghdam&quot; means a white house illuminated by the sun&#x27;s rays. Aghdam was founded in the middle of the 18th century. It was the site of Panah Ali khan Javanshir&#x27;s summer palace and Javanshir family burial ground. In 1828, it received city status in Shusha Uyezd of Elisabethpol Governorate. During the Soviet era, Aghdam had many industries such as butter, wine, brandy and silk factories, as well as hardware and tool factories. An airport and two train stations served there. In terms of education, Agdam had technical, agricultural, medical and music schools.

It was occupied by the Artsakh Defense Army with the support of the Armenian Armed Forces on 23 July 1993, with the settlement being completely destroyed and the population of the city being expelled to the east, into Azerbaijan.

Agdam, located in the buffer zone between the Armenian and Azerbaijani forces, then looked like a ghost town. It was founded in the 18th century and received city status in 1928. It is 365 km away from Baku. In accordance with the ceasefire agreement signed between Azerbaijan and Armenia on 10 November 2020, the entire Aghdam District passed under the control of Azerbaijan on 20 November 2020. At the 2008 census, its population was 39,900 people.

== Population ==
108,554 people lived in the district in 1979. Population rose to 131,293 in 1989, of whom 28,000 lived in the town of Aghdam and over 103,000 in villages and other rural areas.

Following Aghdam&#x27;s capture following Battle of Aghdam, all of Azerbaijani residents in Armenian-occupied areas were forced to flee. According to the Azerbaijani census of 2009, the nominal population of the district was 175,400.

=== Internally displaced people ===
Internally displaced people from Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding occupied regions were moved to Aghdam district from tent settlements around the country. They live in new houses built by the government.

<text>The NASA M2-F1 is a lightweight, unpowered prototype aircraft, developed to flight-test the wingless lifting body concept. Its unusual appearance earned it the nickname &quot;flying bathtub&quot; and was designated the M2-F1, the M referring to &quot;manned&quot;, and F referring to &quot;flight&quot; version. In 1962, NASA Dryden management approved a program to build a lightweight, unpowered lifting-body prototype. It featured a plywood shell placed over a tubular steel frame crafted at Dryden. Construction was completed in 1963.

==Development==
The lifting-body concept originated in the mid-1950s at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics&#x27; Ames Aeronautical Laboratory, Mountain View, California. By February 1962, a series of possible shapes had been developed, and R. Dale Reed was working to gain support for a research vehicle.

The construction of the M2-F1 was a joint effort by Dryden and a local glider manufacturer, the Briegleb Glider Company. The budget was US$30,000. NASA craftsmen and engineers built the tubular steel interior frame. Its mahogany plywood shell was handmade by Gus Briegleb and company. Ernie Lowder, a NASA craftsman who had worked on Howard Hughes&#x27;s H-4 Hercules (&quot;Spruce Goose&quot;), was assigned to help Briegleb.

Final assembly of the remaining components (including aluminum tail surfaces, pushrod controls, and landing gear from a Cessna 150, later replaced by Cessna 180 landing gear) was done at the NASA facility.

The wingless, lifting-body aircraft design was initially conceived as a means of landing a spacecraft horizontally after atmospheric reentry. The absence of wings would make the extreme heat of reentry less damaging to the vehicle. Rather than using a ballistic reentry trajectory like a Command Module, very limited in maneuvering range, a lifting-body vehicle had a landing footprint of the size of California.

==Tow testing==

The first flight tests of the M2-F1 were at Rogers Dry Lake, at the end of a tow rope attached to a 1963 Pontiac Catalina convertible. On April 5, 1963 test pilot Milt Thompson lifted the M2-F1&#x27;s nose off the ground for the first time while being towed. The speed was . The little craft seemed to bounce uncontrollably between the main landing gear wheels, and stopped when he lowered the nose to the ground. He tried again, but each time with the same results. He felt it was a landing gear problem that could have caused the aircraft to roll on its back if he had lifted the main gear off the ground.

After looking at movies of the tests, it was decided that the bouncing was probably caused by unwanted rudder movements. The control system was modified so that the joystick controlled the elevons rather than the rudder, which solved the problem. 

It was found that the car used to tow the aircraft was not powerful enough to lift the M2-F1 entirely off the ground, so the FRC arranged to have the tow car hot-rodded by Bill Straub: the modifications tuned the engine for increased power, added a rollbar, and turned the front passenger seat to face aft so the passenger could observe the aircraft. This proved successful, and tow tests continued.

Speeds on tow inched up to , which allowed Thompson to climb to about , then glide for about 20 seconds after releasing the line. That was the most that could be expected during an auto tow.

These initial tests produced enough flight data about the M2-F1 to proceed with flights behind a NASA R4D tow plane at greater altitudes.

==Flight testing==
A NASA R4D, the Navy designation for the Douglas DC-3, was used for all of the air tows. The first was on August 16, 1963. The M2-F1 had recently been equipped with an ejection seat and small rockets – referred to by the test team as &quot;instant L/D&quot; – in the tail to extend the landing flare for about 5 seconds if needed, and Thompson prepared for the flight with a few more tows behind the Pontiac.

Forward visibility in the M2-F1 was very limited on tow, requiring Thompson to fly about higher than the C-47, so he could see the plane through the nose window. Towing speed was about .

The C-47 took the craft to an altitude of , where free flights back to Rogers Dry Lake began. Pilot for the first series of flights of the M2-F1 was NASA research pilot Milt Thompson. Typical glide flights with the M2-F1 lasted about two minutes and reached speeds of .

Tow release was at . The lifting body descended at an average rate of about 3,600 feet per minute (1,100 m/min). At above the ground, the nose was lowered to increase speed to about , flare was at from a 20° dive. The landing was smooth, and the lifting-body program was on its way.

The M2-F1 was flown until August 16, 1966. It proved the lifting-body concept and led the way for subsequent metal &quot;heavyweight&quot; designs. Chuck Yeager, Bruce Peterson and Donald L. Mallick also flew the M2-F1.

More than 400 ground tows and 77 aircraft tow flights were carried out with the M2-F1. The success of Dryden&#x27;s M2-F1 program led to NASA&#x27;s development and construction of two heavyweight lifting bodies based on studies at NASA&#x27;s Ames and Langley research centers – the Northrop M2-F2 and the Northrop HL-10, both built by the Northrop Corporation, and the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s X-24 program. The lifting-body program also heavily influenced the Space Shuttle program.

The M2-F1 program demonstrated the feasibility of the lifting-body concept for horizontal landings of atmospheric entry vehicles. It also demonstrated a procurement and management concept for prototype flight research vehicles that produced rapid results at very low cost (approximately US$50,000, excluding salaries of government employees assigned to the project).

<doc id="1275653" wikidata="Q75895" url="?curid=1275653" title="Nagcarlan">
<text>Nagcarlan (), officially termed as the &quot;Municipality of Nagcarlan&quot; (), is a municipality in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 64,866 people.

==Etymology==
According to the origin, the name &quot;Nagcarlan&quot; came from the name of a famous rich and generous woman named Ana Kalang or Ana Panalangin, who was a native woman who was known for her golden salakot and cane which she always carried when walking around town. She was well-respected by the townfolk not just for her wealth, but also for the help she extended to those in need. One day, a Spaniard came to her house and upon looking out of the window; he saw branches swaying and hitting one another, and so he asked what was going on. Ana Kalang answered and said &quot;nagkakalang sila&quot;. The word was repeatedly mispronounced by the Spaniards until it became Nagcarlan, which is now the name of the town.

== History ==
===Spanish colonial era===
Before the Spanish conquest of the area, it was headed by Gat Lakilaw. Christianity was propagated to the area in 1578 through Fr. Juan de Plasencia and Fr. Diego Oropesa, both missionaries of Franciscan Order. The area became a formal town in 1583 under Fr. Tomas de Miranda, who brought and successfully cultivated in Nagcarlan the first wheat seeds ever on our country&#x27;s soil. In 1595, Nagcarlan became an independent pueblo (town), separating itself from other towns which were formally established in 1583. The very first Gobernadorcillo was Gaspar Cahupa (Cajopa), a Nagcarleno who served until 1617. The first stone church was built in 1752 by Fr. Cristobal Torres. While the town is already known as Nagcanlang even before the Spaniards came (as evidenced in the 1572 narrative of Juan Masolong, First Christian of Liliw, Laguna), it was Fr. Torres who officially and formally named it Nagcarlan at that time, to honor and recognize the contributions of an influential and respected tribe woman leader named Ana Kalang (baptized as Ana Panalangin). The name Nagcarlan consistently appeared in the Spanish encomienda system during that period as one of the official name of the town. In 1851, Fr. Vicente Velloc, a Franciscan Missionary built the Underground Cemetery, the first of its kind in the Philippines. According to Historical records, this is where the historic Biac-Na-Bato pact was planned by Pedro Paterno and General Severino Taino in 1897. It was also in Nagcarlan, where the Brain of the Katipunan, General Emilio Jacinto, coming from Majayjay and wounded, was captured.

====The Legend of the Hidden Tunnel of Nagcarlan====

Nagcarlan was first colonized in 1571 by Juan de Salcedo, grandson of Miguel López de Legazpi. It was founded by Franciscan priests Juan de Plasencia and Diego Oropesa in 1578. The church of Nagcarlan was first built from light materials such as nipa and wood in 1583 under the chaplaincy of its first priest, Father Tomas de Miranda who also pioneered the cultivation of wheat in the country and was dedicated to Saint Bartholomew.Fr. Vicente Velloc supervised the establishment of a cemetery in Nagcarlan in 1845 below Mt. San Cristobal. Unlike the traditional Spanish cemeteries at that time, Fr. Velloc decided to build it away from the town&#x27;s center. The cemetery is planned to serve as a public resting place for the people of the town while the underground chamber below the chapel of the cemetery will only house remains of Spanish friars and prominent people. It was built together with the construction of the expanded St. Bartholomew Parish Church and rectory. The cemetery is built with a chapel where funeral masses were held and directly below it is an underground crypt.
Pilgrims flock to the Nagcarlan Church to pray before the images of St. Bartholomew and San Diego de Alcala known for their miraculous healing. However, there is also one interesting belief among the locals about a hidden tunnel which is referred to as &quot;the Jewel of Nagcarlan.&quot; The stories about the existence of a &quot;hidden tunnel of the Nagcarlan Underground Cemetery&quot; circulated and never ceased to depart from the minds of the believers.

This legend has been passed from generations after generations of Nagcarleños about the hidden tunnel somewhere in the very heart of Nagcarlan Underground Cemetery that is believed to be connected behind the church&#x27;s Altar. Stories unendingly chronicled that the Franciscan Father Vicente Belloc who supposedly had the first hand knowledge of the secret tunnel, protectively carried the secret of the underground tunnel to his grave. To this date, many in Nagcarlan still believe and adhere to the &quot;hearsays&quot; that if one can locate &quot;the Jewel of Nagcarlan&quot;, &quot;the Hidden Tunnel of Nagcarlan Underground Cemetery that connects below the Altar of Nagcarlan Catholic Church, he might also be tracking his way up to the summit of the Legendary Mount Banahaw.

==Geography==
Nagcarlan is from Santa Cruz and from Manila.

The town is home to the Nagcarlan Underground Cemetery, one of the most important cemeteries in the Philippines which has been declared as a National Historical Landmark by virtue of Presidential Decree no. 260, dated August 1, 1973 with amendments by Administrative Order 1505, dated June 11, 1978. Since the declaration, no more burials were allowed in the cemetery. It underwent renovations before it was again opened to the public during the unveiling of the marker on November 24, 1981. The oldest tomb is dated 1887 while the last interment was in 1982 when it was formally declared as a National Historical Landmark.

==Tourism==
Nagcarlan offers natural and cultural attractions for visitors: rivers, waterfalls, lakes and hills for outdoor activities; Spanish colonial sites for historical exploration; and restaurants serving local and international cuisine for gastronomic experiences.

Along Rizal Avenue, leading from the market to the municipio still stands many old Art Deco buildings built during the 1920s to the 1930s. The presence of many narrow three-story buildings where the ground floors are rented out to commercial establishments in Nagcarlan is an indication that the town may have played the role of the central trading center early in the previous century.

There are also many natural attractions within Nagcarlan. The little known Bunga Falls is a favorite getaway among the locals, while the hidden Yambo Lake can be accessed through the back roads going to Calauan. The &quot;baby&quot; mountains can be climbed in a day, the assistance of a local guide is usually required, as the trails are usually covered with vegetation.
Another interesting attraction is the San Bartolome Apostol Church. Located on an elevated ground overlooking the rest of the town, the 18th century church built by the Franciscans has an elegant stone and red clay façade with an imposing belltower on the right and an attractive convent on the left. The parish officials still allow visitors to climb up to the top of the belltower to see where Anne Curtis shot most of her scenes in the famous TV series &quot;Kampanerang Kuba&quot;.

Nagcarlan&#x27;s best known attraction is Nagcarlan Underground Cemetery. This one of its kind cemetery in the Philippines, where there are 240 niches laying above ground and 36 niches underground. Members of the town&#x27;s elite were buried underground below the funeral chapel. It is said that the underground cemetery was used by the Katipuneros to hold their secret meetings.

==Education==
Calumpang National High School, a public secondary high school, is located in the city.

Moreover, in recent years it has become a priority to develop rice-paddy growing in extreme salinity sites. Silk-worm breeding is considered to be one of the ancient and traditional fields at the region.

The industry is relatively developed in the district. The main industrial sector of the district is processing. Leki Ginning Factory produces seedless raw cotton which provides 75–85% of all regional industrial production. In addition to that, the region has a developed plastic material and textile industry (Khosrov Metalplastmas Plant, Agdash Industrial Plant), food industry (Agdash Bread-Making Plant, Agdash Foodstuffs Plant) and production of construction materials (Kukel Brick Plant). Recently, “Orelay” and “FA com BICA” sweets production enterprises, “Arash” cooling water and “Arshin Malchin” textile plants have been put into operation in the region.

The region runs education, health, social, recreational and public catering facilities.

== Media ==
Two newspapers – “Agdash” and “Young Educators” are published in the district. The first issue of the &quot;Agdash&quot; newspaper was published on 7 January in 1932 under the title &quot;Aghdash cotton man&quot;. The newspaper was distributed in Ganja under the names “Aghdash cotton man” in 1932–1937 years, “Combating for cotton” in 1938–1962, &quot;New life&quot; covering Agdash, Goychay, Gabala, Ujar, Kurdamir districts in 1962–1966, afterwards during 1966–2003 years it was published in Goychay as &quot;Labor&quot;.

<text>Windows Mobile is a discontinued mobile operating system developed by Microsoft for smartphones and personal digital assistants (PDA). Designed to be the portable equivalent of the Windows desktop OS in the emerging mobile/portable area, the operating system is built on top of Windows CE (later known as Windows Embedded Compact) and was originally released as Pocket PC 2000.

Microsoft introduced the Pocket PC keyboard-less PDAs in 2000, with Pocket PC 2000 being the software. It was based on version 3.0 of Windows CE, the operating system originally developed for the Handheld PC in 1996. The next versions were Pocket PC 2002 and Smartphone 2002, the latter of which would power a new category of keypad-based cell phone devices named Smartphone. With the release of Windows Mobile 2003, the software was rebranded to a single &quot;Windows Mobile&quot; for both Pocket PCs and Smartphones, and to connect the brand with its desktop counterpart. Support for SH-3 and MIPS processor architectures were dropped, focusing only on ARM. In the next major release, Windows Mobile 5.0 in 2005, Microsoft unified the separate developments of Pocket PC and Smartphone software into a single Windows Mobile codebase. Data could be synchronized with desktops using ActiveSync software, and later using Windows Mobile Device Center.

Windows Mobile 6.0 and 6.1 were the next major releases, in 2007 and 2008 respectively, by which time the hardware devices were also solely under the Windows Mobile banner. Along with the final major release, Windows Mobile 6.5, the first to be designed for use without a stylus on touchscreens, Microsoft also introduced the Windows Marketplace for Mobile for software distribution, for Windows Mobile 6.x devices. Following the success of newer mobile operating systems like iOS, Windows Mobile faded rapidly; in 2010, Microsoft announced the more modern and consumer-focused Windows Phone 7 as its replacement, and Windows Mobile has been deprecated since existing devices and software are incompatible with Windows Phone.

==Features==
Most versions of Windows Mobile have a standard set of features, such as multitasking and the ability to navigate a file system similar to that of Windows 9x and Windows NT, including support for many of the same file types. Similarly to its desktop counterpart, it comes bundled with a set of applications that perform basic tasks. Internet Explorer Mobile is the default web browser, and Windows Media Player is the default media player used for playing digital media. The mobile version of Microsoft Office is the default office suite.

Internet Connection Sharing, supported on compatible devices, allows the phone to share its Internet connection with computers via USB and Bluetooth. Windows Mobile supports virtual private networking over PPTP protocol. Most devices with mobile connectivity also have a Radio Interface Layer. The Radio Interface Layer provides the system interface between the Cell Core layer within the Windows Mobile OS and the radio protocol stack used by the wireless modem hardware. This allows OEMs to integrate a variety of modems into their equipment.

The user interface changed dramatically between versions, only retaining similar functionality. The &quot;Today Screen&quot;, later called the &quot;Home Screen&quot;, shows the current date, owner information, upcoming appointments, e-mails, and tasks. The taskbar displays the current time as well as the volume level. Devices with a cellular radio also show the signal strength on said taskbar.

==History==

Windows Mobile is based on the Windows CE kernel and first appeared as the &quot;Pocket PC 2000&quot; operating system. It includes a suite of basic applications developed with the Microsoft Windows API, and is designed to have features and appearance somewhat similar to desktop versions of Windows. It allowed third party developers to develop software for Windows Mobile with no restrictions imposed by Microsoft. Software applications were purchasable from Windows Marketplace for Mobile during the service&#x27;s lifespan.

Most early Windows Mobile devices came with a stylus, which can be used to enter commands by tapping it on the screen. The primary touch input technology behind most devices were resistive touchscreens which often required a stylus for input. Later devices used capacitive sensing which does not require a stylus. Along with touchscreens, a large variety of form factors existed for the platform. Some devices featured slideout keyboards, while others featured minimal face buttons.

===Windows CE===
Microsoft&#x27;s work on handheld portable devices began with research projects in 1990, with the work on Windows CE beginning in 1992. Initially, the OS and the user interface were developed separately. With Windows CE being based on Windows 95 code and a separate team handing the user interface which was codenamed WinPad (later Microsoft At Work for Handhelds). Windows 95 had strong pen support making porting easy; with some saying &quot;At this time, Windows 95 offers outstanding pen support. It is treating pens right for the first time.&quot; WinPad was delayed due to price and performance issues, before being scrapped in early 1995 due to touchscreen driver problems relating to WriteTouch technology, made by NCR Microelectronic Products. Although WinPad was never released as a consumer product, Alpha builds were released showcasing many interface elements. During development of WinPad a separate team worked on a project called Pulsar; designed to be a mobile communications version of WinPad, described as a &quot;pager on Steroids&quot;. This project was also canceled around the same time as WinPad. The two disbanded groups would form the Pegasus project in 1995. Pegasus would work on the hardware side of the Windows CE OS, attempting to create a form factor similar to a PC-esque PDA like WinPad, with communications functionality like Pulsar. Under the name Handheld PC, a hardware reference guide was created, and devices began shipping in 1996, although most of these devices bore little resemblance to the goal of a pen-based touchscreen handheld device. A specification for a smaller form factor under the name Palm-size PC was released in 1998.

===Pocket PC 2000===
Pocket PC 2000, originally codenamed &quot;Rapier&quot;, was released on April 19, 2000, and was based on the Windows CE 3.0 kernel.

Pocket PC 2000 was the debut of what was later to become the Windows Mobile operating system, and was meant to be a successor to the operating system aboard Palm-size PCs. Backwards compatibility was retained with such Palm-size PC applications.

Pocket PC 2000 was intended mainly for Pocket PC devices; however, several Palm-size PC devices had the ability to be updated as well. Furthermore, several Pocket PC 2000 phones were released (under the name Handheld PC 2000), however at this time, Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Smartphone&quot; hardware platform had not yet been created.

At this time, Pocket PC devices had not been standardized with a specific CPU architecture. As a result, Pocket PC 2000 was released on multiple CPU architectures, such as SH-3, MIPS, and ARM. The only resolution supported by this release was 240 x 320 (QVGA). Removable storage card formats that were supported were CompactFlash and MultiMediaCard. Infrared (IR) File beaming capability was among the original hardware features.

Aesthetically, the original Pocket PC operating system was similar in design to the then-current Windows 98, Windows 2000, and the yet-to-be-released Windows Me desktop operating systems. Crucially, the Pocket PC had a less cluttered interface more suitable for a mobile device, unlike the interface on predeceasing Palm-size PCs. Mainstream support for Pocket PC 2000 ended on September 30, 2005, and extended support ended on October 9, 2007.

This initial release had multiple built-in applications, many of them similarly branded to match their desktop counterparts; such as Microsoft Reader, Microsoft Money, Pocket Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player. A version of Microsoft Office called Pocket Office was also bundled and included Pocket Word, Pocket Excel and Pocket Outlook. Notes, a note-taking app saw its first release and would be supported by most later versions of Windows Mobile. Intelligent character recognition support allowed Notes to distinguish styles of handwriting to be learned by the OS during processing to improve accuracy and recognition levels.

===Pocket PC 2002===
Pocket PC 2002, originally codenamed &quot;Merlin&quot;, was released on October 4, 2001, and was based on the Windows CE 3.0 kernel, like with Pocket PC 2000. Although targeted mainly for 240×320 (QVGA) Pocket PC devices, Pocket PC 2002 was also used for Pocket PC phones (Pocket PC 2002 Phone Edition).

Aesthetically, Pocket PC 2002 was meant to be similar in design to the then newly released Windows XP. Newly added or updated programs include Windows Media Player 8 with streaming capability; MSN Messenger, and Microsoft Reader 2, with Digital rights management support. Upgrades to the bundled version of Office Mobile include a spell checker and word count tool in Pocket Word and improved Pocket Outlook. Connectivity was improved with file beaming on non-Microsoft devices such as Palm OS, the inclusion of Terminal Services and Virtual private networking support, and the ability to synchronize folders. Other upgrades include an enhanced UI with theme support and savable downloads and WAP in Pocket Internet Explorer.

=== Smartphone 2002 ===

Smartphone 2002, originally codenamed &quot;Stinger&quot;, was released in 2002. Based on Windows CE 3.0 like Pocket PC 2002 and Pocket PC 2000, Smartphone 2002 was built for GSM cell phones with standard keypad-based form factors, as opposed to Pocket PC 2002 Phone Edition which targeted standard touch-based PDAs. The first device that was supposed to ship with Smartphone 2002 was the Sendo Z100 which was canceled after Microsoft sued Sendo.

===Windows Mobile 2003===
Windows Mobile 2003, initially named as Pocket PC 2003 and originally codenamed &quot;Ozone&quot;, was the first release under the Windows Mobile banner, released on June 23, 2003, based on the Windows CE 4.2 kernel.

It came in four editions: &quot;Windows Mobile 2003 for Pocket PC Premium Edition&quot;, &quot;Windows Mobile 2003 for Pocket PC Professional Edition&quot;, &quot;Windows Mobile 2003 for Smartphone&quot; and &quot;Windows Mobile 2003 for Pocket PC Phone Edition&quot;. The last was designed especially for Pocket PCs which include phone functionalities. The Professional Edition was used in Pocket PC budget models. It lacked a number of features that were in the Premium Edition, such as a client for L2TP/IPsec VPNs. All versions of Windows Mobile 2003 were powered by Windows CE 4.20.

Communications interface were enhanced with Bluetooth device management, which allowed for Bluetooth file beaming support, Bluetooth headset support and support for Bluetooth add-on keyboards. A pictures application with viewing, cropping, e-mail, and beaming support was added. Multimedia improvements included MIDI file support as ringtones in Phone Edition and Windows Media Player 9.0 with streaming optimization. A puzzle game titled &quot;Jawbreaker&quot; is among the preinstalled programs. GAPI was included with this release to facilitate the development of games for the platform.

Other features/built-in applications included the following: enhanced Pocket Outlook with vCard and vCal support, improved Pocket Internet Explorer and SMS reply options for Phone Edition.

===Windows Mobile 2003 SE===
Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition, also known as &quot;Windows Mobile 2003 SE&quot;, was released on March 24, 2004, and first offered on the Dell Axim x30. It was based on the Windows CE 4.x kernel. This was the last version which allowed users to back up and restore an entire device through ActiveSync.

This upgrade allows users to switch between portrait and landscape modes and introduces a single-column layout in Pocket Internet Explorer. It includes support for Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and new screen resolutions: 640×480 (VGA), 240×240, and 480×480. It was powered by the same OS as with Windows Mobile 2003, which was Windows CE 4.20.

===Windows Mobile 5===
Windows Mobile 5.0, originally codenamed &quot;Magneto&quot;, was released at Microsoft&#x27;s Mobile and Embedded Developers Conference 2005 in Las Vegas, May 9–12, 2005, and was based on the Windows CE 5.0 kernel.

Microsoft offered mainstream support for Windows Mobile 5 through October 12, 2010, and extended support through October 13, 2015. It was first offered on the Dell Axim x51. It used the .NET Compact Framework 1.0 SP3, an environment for programs based on .NET. Windows Mobile 5.0 included Microsoft Exchange Server &quot;push&quot; functionality improvements that worked with Exchange 2003 SP2. The &quot;push&quot; functionality also required vendor/device support. With AKU2 software upgrades all WM 5.0 devices supported DirectPush.

Other features included an enhanced battery-saving capability called &quot;persistent storage&quot; capability. Previously up to 50% (enough for 72 hours of storage) of battery power was reserved just to maintain data in volatile RAM. This continued the trend of Windows-based devices moving from using RAM as their primary storage medium to the use of a combination of RAM and flash memory (in use, no distinction between the two is obvious to users). Programs and frequently accessed data run in RAM, while most storage is in the flash memory. The OS seamlessly moves data between the two as needed. Everything is backed up in the flash memory, so unlike prior devices, WM5 devices lose no data if power is lost. New to 5.0, OS updates were released as adaptation kit upgrades, with AKU 3.5 being the final released.

Windows Mobile 5 comes with Microsoft Office Mobile which includes PowerPoint Mobile, Excel Mobile with graphing capability and Word Mobile with the ability to insert tables and graphics. Media management and playback was enhanced with Picture and Video package, which converged the management of videos and pictures and Windows Media Player 10 Mobile. Among new hardware features were enhanced Bluetooth support, default QWERTY keyboard-support and a management interface for Global Positioning System (GPS). Improvements were made to ActiveSync 4.2 with 15% increased synchronization speed. Business customers benefited from a new error reporting facility similar to that present in desktop and server Windows systems. Caller ID now supports photos so a user can apply an image to each contact to show when a call is received. DirectShow was also natively added. This release was the first to include DirectDraw with hardware acceleration, replacing the deprecated graphics component of GAPI.

Windows Mobile 5.0 requires at least 64 MB of ROM (it&#x27;s advisable to have 64 MB of RAM), and the device must run an ARM compatible processor such as the Intel XScale or the Samsung and Texas Instruments ARM compatibles.

===Windows Mobile 6===
Windows Mobile 6, formerly codenamed &quot;Crossbow&quot;, was released on February 12, 2007 at the 3GSM World Congress 2007 and was based on the Windows CE 5.2 kernel.

It comes in three different versions: &quot;Windows Mobile 6 Standard&quot; for Smartphones (phones without touchscreens), &quot;Windows Mobile 6 Professional&quot; for Pocket PCs with phone functionality, and &quot;Windows Mobile 6 Classic&quot; for Pocket PCs without cellular radios.

Windows Mobile 6 is powered by Windows CE 5.0 (version 5.2) and is strongly linked to the then newly introduced Windows Live and Exchange 2007 products. Windows Mobile 6 Standard was first offered on the Orange&#x27;s SPV E650, while Windows Mobile 6 Professional was first offered on the O2&#x27;s Xda Terra. Aesthetically, Windows Mobile 6 was meant to be similar in design to the then newly released Windows Vista. Functionally, it works much like Windows Mobile 5, but with much better stability.

Along with the announcement of Office Mobile 6.1 with support for Office 2007 document formats (pptx, docx, xlsx); OneNote Mobile, a companion to Microsoft Office OneNote was added to the already installed version. In addition to the newly included programs with Office Mobile improvements were made to existing applications. Such as HTML email support in Outlook Mobile. A large number of Windows Mobile users are enterprise users business environments were targeted. With &quot;Server Search&quot; on Microsoft Exchange 2007, Out of Office Replies with Microsoft Exchange 2007, and search ability for contacts in an Exchange Server Address Book being implemented. To aid development for programmers, .NET Compact Framework v2 SP2 is now preinstalled with the OS. Developers and users also have access to Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Compact Edition for storage and retrieval of information. AJAX, JavaScript, and XMLDOM support were added to Internet Explorer Mobile along with improved devicewide Internet Sharing. Communication abilities were further enhanced with a new Microsoft Bluetooth Stack and VoIP (Internet calling) support with acoustic echo cancellation and MSRT audio codec.

To improve security Microsoft added Storage Card Encryption so that encryption keys are lost if device is cold-booted. Further updates both, security and feature, can now also be provided using Operating System Live Update.

Among other improvements: 320×320 and 800×480 (WVGA) screen resolution support (The S01SH or &quot;Em One&quot; by Sharp was the first and only device to have an 800×480 screen on WM5), Improved Remote Desktop access (available for only certain Pocket PCs), Customer Feedback option, &quot;Smartfilter&quot; for searching within programs and Unlicensed Mobile Access (UMA) support for select operators.

===Windows Mobile 6.1===
Windows Mobile 6.1 was announced April 1, 2008, and was based on the Windows CE 5.x kernel.

It is a minor upgrade to the Windows Mobile 6 platform with various performance enhancements and a redesigned &quot;Home&quot; screen featuring horizontal &quot;tiles&quot; that expand on clicking to display more information, although this new home screen is featured only on Windows Mobile Standard edition. This was not supported in the Professional edition. Several other changes such as threaded SMS, full page zooming in Internet Explorer and &#x27;Domain Enroll&#x27; were also added, along with a &quot;mobile&quot; version of the Microsoft OneNote program and an interactive &quot;Getting Started&quot; wizard. Domain Enroll is functionality to connect the device to System Center Mobile Device Manager 2008, a product to manage mobile devices. Windows Mobile 6.1 also had improved bandwidth efficiency in its push-email protocol ActiveSync up to 40%; this considerably improved battery life in many devices.

Aside from the visual and feature distinctions, the underlying CE versions can be used to differentiate WM 6.0 from WM 6.1. The version of Windows CE in WM 6.0 is 5.2.*, where the third and final number being a four-digit build ID (e.g. 5.2.1622 on HTC Wing). In WM 6.1, the CE version is 5.2.* with a five-digit build number (e.g. 5.2.19216 on Palm Treo 800w).

===Windows Mobile 6.5===

Windows Mobile 6.5 is a stopgap update to Windows Mobile 6.1, based on the Windows CE 5.x kernel, intended to bridge the gap between version 6.1 and the then yet-to-be released Windows Mobile 7 (Later canceled in favor of Windows Phone 7), that arrived in 2010. It was never part of Microsoft&#x27;s mobile phone roadmap, and has been described by its chief executive, Steve Ballmer, as &quot;not the full release Microsoft wanted&quot; until the multi-touch-enabled Windows Mobile 7 (now replaced by Windows Phone) arrived in 2010. Ballmer also indicated that the company &quot;screwed up with Windows Mobile&quot;, he lamented that Windows Mobile 7 was not yet available and that the Windows Mobile team needed to try to recoup losses. Microsoft unveiled this version at the 2009 Mobile World Congress in February, and several devices were supplied with it. It was released to manufacturers on May 11, 2009; the first devices running the operating system appeared in late October 2009. Several phones that officially shipped with Windows Mobile 6.1 can be officially updated to Windows Mobile 6.5. This update includes some significant new added features, such as a revamped GUI, a new Today screen resembling that of Microsoft&#x27;s Zune player with vertically scrollable labels (called &#x27;Titanium&#x27;) in terms of functionality with a styling similar to that of Windows 7. WM 6.5 also includes the new Internet Explorer Mobile 6 browser, with improved interface.

Along with Windows Mobile 6.5, Microsoft announced several cloud computing services codenamed &quot;SkyBox&quot;, &quot;SkyLine&quot;, &quot;SkyMarket&quot;. &quot;SkyBox&quot; has been confirmed as My Phone, while &quot;SkyMarket&quot; has been confirmed as Windows Marketplace for Mobile. This version was designed mainly for easier finger usage. Some reviewers have noted interface inconsistencies, with some applications having small buttons making them harder to operate using only a finger. Whilst this version of Windows Mobile does not natively support capacitive screens, mobile manufacturers have been able to use them on their devices.

In the months following this release, development shifted from Windows Mobile to its successor Windows Phone. As such no major upgrades were planned or released, although three minor updates; 6.5.1, 6.5.3 and 6.5.5; were made to satisfy consumers during the transition period. 6.5.1 brings larger user interface elements, including icon based soft buttons (rather than text based), an updated contacts app, native support for A-GPS, improved threaded text messaging, and performance improvements. It was unofficially ported to several Windows Mobile phones.

The second minor update was announced on February 2, 2010, along with the Sony Ericsson Aspen which was the first phone to use this version. 6.5.3 continues the trend of attempting to provide a more finger-friendly user interface with several new usability features such as native support for multitouch; although device maker HTC Corporation created proprietary work-arounds to allow multi-touch to work on some applications it installed on its HD2 handset (However, Microsoft applications on this handset, such as the Internet Explorer web browser, did not support multi-touch.) and drag-and-drop start menu icons. Touchable tiles replaced soft keys.&quot; Internet Explorer Mobile 6 has also received some major updates including decreased page load time, improved memory management and gesture smoothing. As with other updates it was unofficially ported to some other devices. Additional features include threaded email and Office Mobile 2010.

The last minor update and the last released version is 6.5.5. It first leaked in January 2010, and was unofficially ported to some Windows Mobile phones. The name Windows Mobile 6.5.5 has been applied to these newer builds, although this name remained unconfirmed by Microsoft.

==Hardware==

There are three main versions of Windows Mobile for various hardware devices. Windows Mobile Professional, which runs on smartphones with touchscreens; Windows Mobile Standard, which runs on mobile phones without touchscreens; and Windows Mobile Classic, which runs on personal digital assistant or Pocket PCs. Windows Mobile for Automotive and Windows Mobile software for Portable Media Centers are among some specialty versions of the platform.

Microsoft had over 50 handset partners, when Windows Mobile was still being shipped on new devices. 80% of the 50 million Windows Mobile devices that were made from launch to February 2009 were built by one contract manufacturing group, HTC, which makes handsets for several major companies under their brands, and under its own brand.

===Embedded Handheld===
On January 10, 2011, Microsoft announced Windows Embedded Handheld 6.5. The operating system has compatibility with Windows Mobile 6.5 and is presented as an enterprise handheld device, targeting retailers, delivery companies, and other companies that rely on handheld computing. Unlike Windows Phone, Windows Embedded Handheld retains backward compatibility with legacy Windows Mobile applications.

===Pocket PCs===

Pocket PCs and personal digital assistants were originally the intended platform for Windows Mobile. These were grouped into two main categories: devices that lacked mobile phone capabilities, and those that included it. Beginning with version 6 devices with this functionality ran &quot;Windows Mobile 6 Professional&quot; and those that lacked it ran &quot;Windows Mobile 6 Classic&quot;. Microsoft had described these devices as &quot;a handheld device that enables you to store and retrieve e-mail, contacts, appointments, play multimedia files, games, exchange text messages with MSN Messenger, browse the Web, and more&quot;. From a technical standpoint Microsoft also specified various hardware and software requirements such as the inclusion of a touchscreen and a directional pad or touchpad.

===Smartphones===
Smartphones were the second hardware platform after Pocket PC to run Windows Mobile, and debuted with the release of Smartphone 2002. Although in the broad sense of the term &quot;Smartphone&quot;, both Pocket PC phones and Microsoft branded Smartphones each fit into this category. Microsoft&#x27;s use of the term &quot;Smartphone&quot; includes only more specific hardware devices that differ from Pocket PC phones. Such Smartphones were originally designed without touchscreens, intended to be operated more efficiently with only one hand, and typically had lower display resolution than Pocket PCs. Microsoft&#x27;s focus for the Smartphone platform was to create a device that functioned well as a phone and data device in a more integrated manner.

==Market share==

Windows Mobile&#x27;s share of the smartphone market grew from its inception while new devices were being released. After peaking in 2007, it saw decline year-on-year.

In Q1 2003, Windows Mobile was the third largest operating system in the smart handheld market, behind Symbian and Palm OS.

In Q1 2004, Windows Mobile accounted for 23% of worldwide smartphone sales. Windows Mobile was projected in 2005 to overtake Symbian to become the leading mobile OS by 2010. In Q3 2004, Windows Mobile (CE) surpassed Palm OS to become the largest PDA operating system.

In Q4 2005 Microsoft shipped 2.2 million PDAs, which increased to 3.5 million in the same quarter the following year. Windows Mobile saw year over year growth between 2005 and 2006 of 38.8% which according to Gartner &quot;helped Windows Mobile to solidify its stronghold on the market&quot;.

But by 2008, its share had dropped to 14%. Microsoft licensed Windows Mobile to four out of the world&#x27;s five largest mobile phone manufacturers, with Nokia being the exception.

Gartner research data showed that while the total smartphone industry grew 27% between 2008 and 2009, Windows Mobile&#x27;s share of the smartphone market fell 2.7% in that same period. It also decreased by 20% in Q3 2009. At one time Windows Mobile was the most popular handset for business use, but by 2009 this was no longer the case; 24% of planned business deployments of mobile application in the United States were for Windows Mobile, putting it in 3rd place, behind BlackBerry (61%) and iPhone OS (27%);

In February 2009, Microsoft signed a deal with the third largest mobile phone maker, LG Electronics, to license Windows Mobile OS on 50 upcoming LG smartphone models. But in September 2009, Palm, Inc. announced it would drop Windows Mobile from its smartphone line-up. Gartner estimated that by the third quarter of 2009 Windows Mobile&#x27;s share of worldwide smartphone sales was 7.9%. By August 2010, it was the least popular smartphone operating system, with a 5% share of the worldwide smartphone market (after Symbian, BlackBerry OS, Android and iOS). An October 2009 report in &quot;DigiTimes&quot; said that Acer would shift its focus from Windows Mobile to Google Android. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 2009 that Windows Mobile &quot;[was] foundering&quot;, as cellphone makers desert it in favor of Google&#x27;s Android phone platform. It cited the difficulties in Microsoft&#x27;s business model, which involves charging handset manufacturers up to $25 for each copy of Windows Mobile, while rival Google gives away Android for free. From late 2009 analysts and media reports began to express concerns about the future viability of the Windows Mobile platform, and whether Microsoft would keep supporting it into the future. Samsung announced in November 2009 that it would phase out the Windows Mobile platform, to concentrate on its own Bada operating system, Google&#x27;s Android, and Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Phone.
==Software development==

Software could be developed by third parties for the Windows Mobile operating system. Developers had several options for deploying mobile applications. These included writing native code with Visual C++, managed code that worked with the .NET Compact Framework, writing code in Tcl-Tk with eTcl, GCC using CeGCC, Python using PythonCE or server-side code that could be deployed using Internet Explorer Mobile or a mobile client on a user&#x27;s device. The .NET Compact Framework was a subset of the .NET Framework and hence shared many components with software development on desktop clients, application servers, and web servers which had the .NET Framework installed, thus integrating networked computing space.

To aid developers Microsoft released software development kits (SDKs) that worked in conjunction with their Visual Studio development environment. These SDKs included emulator images for developers to test and debug their applications while writing them. Software could be tested on a client machine directly or be downloaded to a device. Microsoft also distributed Visual Studio 2008 / 2005 Professional Editions, and server/database counterparts to students as downloads free of charge via its DreamSpark program. Third party integrated development environments could also be used to write software such as Lazarus, Resco MobileForms Toolkit, Lexico, NS Basic and Basic4ppc. Some third party development environments allowed coding to be done on the device itself without the need for a computer.

Developer communities have used the SDK to port later versions of Windows Mobile OS to older devices and making the OS images available for free, thus providing the devices with newer feature sets. Microsoft had tolerated this procedure for some time but decided in February 2007 to ask developers to take their OS images off the net, which in turn raised discussions. At the same time Microsoft offered upgrades to Windows Mobile 6 versions to manufacturers for free.

On July 5, 2009, Microsoft opened a third-party application distribution service called Windows Marketplace for Mobile. In 2011, Windows Marketplace for Mobile stopped accepting new admissions. and then fully closed on May 9, 2012.

==Connectivity==
In the early years of Windows Mobile devices were able to be managed and synced from a remote computer using ActiveSync; a data synchronization technology and protocol developed by Microsoft, originally released in 1996. This allowed servers running Microsoft Exchange Server, or other third party variants, to act as a personal information manager and share information such as email, calendar appointments, contacts or internet favorites.

With the release of Windows Vista, ActiveSync was replaced with Windows Mobile Device Center. Device Center is included with Vista and Windows 7 and provides many front end enhancements, allowing a home user to sync PIM information with Microsoft Outlook 2003 and later, photos from Windows Photo Gallery, videos or music from Windows Media Player and favorites with Internet Explorer; without the need for a server back end. Devices at this time also included a base driver compatible with Mobile Device Center so a user can connect to a computer without a need for any configuration.

<text>Rose McDowall (née Porter; born 21 October 1959) is a Scottish musician who formed Strawberry Switchblade with Jill Bryson in 1981.
==History==
McDowall was born in Glasgow, Scotland in 1959. Her first venture into music was in the Poems, an art-punk trio formed in 1978 with her then-husband Drew McDowall. She then formed Strawberry Switchblade in 1981 with Jill Bryson. After signing with Warner Bros. Records, they enjoyed chart success with their single &quot;Since Yesterday&quot; in 1984; however, later singles and an album did not sell as well as expected. This and internal problems led to an acrimonious split in 1986.

For the next six years, McDowall was primarily a guest vocalist or &quot;floating member&quot; of several different alternative bands, particularly in the neofolk genre. She contributed backing or lead vocals for Coil, Current 93, Death in June, Felt, Alex Fergusson, Into a Circle, Megas, Nature and Organisation, Nurse with Wound, Ornamental, Psychic TV and Boyd Rice on recordings as well as singing or playing guitar for live appearances. In 1993, she collaborated with Boyd Rice under the band name Spell, producing two singles and an album of 1960s pop, country and psychedelia covers for Mute Records. 

At the same time, she formed a folk rock band called Sorrow with then-husband Robert Lee. Between 1993 and 2001, they released two albums and one EP through World Serpent Distribution and performed in Europe and the US. During this time, McDowall continued to record and perform with Current 93 and Coil, including the short-lived group Rosa Mundi. Robert Lee left the band in 2002. McDowall and her remaining bandmates continued to perform as Rosa Mundi until 2005 when she began performing under her own name.

McDowall is best known as a vocalist, but also plays guitar, keyboards, melodica, and drums. Her signature instruments are a Washburn 12-string acoustic guitar, a Fender Coronado electric 6-string guitar and an electric harmonium.

<text>Aghstafa District () is one of the 66 districts of Azerbaijan. Located in the northwest of the country, it belongs to the Gazakh-Tovuz Economic Region. The district borders the districts of Qazakh, Tovuz, as well as the Kakheti and Kvemo Kartli regions of Georgia. Its capital and largest city is Aghstafa. As of 2020, the district had a population of 88,500.

== Overview ==
Aghstafa District was created on 24 January 1939 as an independent administrative unit out of the larger Qazakh region of Azerbaijan. On 4 December 1959, the status of the district was abolished and it was incorporated into Qazakh District. On 14 April 1990, by the decree of the Council of Deputies of Azerbaijan SSR, it was split from Qazakh District and was again re-established as a separate district. The regional center of the district is its capital
Aghstafa. The district is located in the northwestern part of the country, between Qabirri basin and Lesser Caucasus mountain range, and Ganja-Gazakh
lowlands and Ceyrançöl highlands. It is sandwiched by Qazakh District in the west and Tovuz District in east, and borders Armenia on the southern frontier and Georgia on the northern.
The area of the district is 1,503.7 km2. There are 36 villages in the district. There are 39 secondary schools, lyceum, musical school, 2 museums, 38 cultural clubs, State Arts Gallery, 49 libraries, 3 city and 10 village hospitals functioning in the district. Ganja, Qazakh and Qarayazi lowlands make up most of the district&#x27;s area, whilst its southwestern and northeastern parts comprise lesser mountain sites.

=== Etymology ===
The area&#x27;s name comes from the name of the Oghuz Turks which include mainly the population of Azerbaijan, Turkey and Turkmenistan.
Ağstafa is a merger of two words: &quot;Oğuz + tayfa&quot; &quot;(Oghuz + tribe)&quot;. However, some people argue that it is a merger of the other two words which are: &quot;Oğuz + təpə&quot; &quot;(Oghuz + hill)&quot;.

==Economy==
The region is rich with bentonite, sand, raw cement material (volcanic ash) and other resources which are considered a core of the Aghstafa economy. The Kura River passes through the region. Lower sections of Aghstafa and Həsənsu rivers also flow through the district. Aghstafa has always been in the spotlight because of the historic Silk Way trade which went through the region. Caravans from and to Georgia and Iran would stop in Aghstafa. It was therefore named the &quot;Camel route&quot;. In the 1990s, the caravan route was re-established within the TRACECA project initiated by Heydar Aliyev administration. Then Aghstafa gained importance when it became a transit route on the Baku-Tbilisi railroad built in 1881. A railroad junction at Aghstafa was built in 1914 thus creating leading to construction of Aghstafa city. In addition to the existing railway, the geostrategic importance of Aghstafa was enriched by Baku-Gazakh-Tbilisi gas pipeline, Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline, Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum gas pipeline.

<text>John Harden Allen (1847 – May 14, 1930) was an American minister associated with the Church of God (Holiness), and British Israelism. He came from Illinois, later moving to Missouri in 1879. Originally a pastor in the Methodist Episcopal Church, he later became a pastor in the Wesleyan Methodist Church in California. He was one of the co-founders of the Church of God (Holiness) in 1883. He &quot;evangelized throughout the West and eventually moved to Pasadena, California, where he died&quot;. Around 1917 he produced a publication entitled &quot;Stone Kingdom Herald&quot;.

==&quot;Judah&#x27;s Sceptre and Joseph&#x27;s Birthright&quot; (1902)==

Allen is best known for his book titled &quot;Judah&#x27;s Sceptre and Joseph&#x27;s Birthright&quot;, which states that it is: &quot;An Analysis of the Prophecies of the Scriptures in regard to the Royal Family of Judah and the Many Nations of Israel, the Lost Ten Tribes.&quot;

A review in the &quot;Baptist Messenger&quot; reported:
:This is one of the most interesting volumes we have read in many a day and we confess that the arguments produced by Mr. Allen seem to be unanswerable. It is more thrilling than Western fiction. The description of the scarlet thread, the royal remnant, and the part played by Jeremiah in the preservation of the ruler for David&#x27;s throne, will cause you to lose sleep rather than go to bed without knowing the outcome.

==Overview of publication==
When this book first appeared, Britannia still ruled the waves and the sun was shining on the British Empire, which is why many came to believe that the British were &quot;God&#x27;s People&quot; and an introduction to the book claimed that:

:A notable and immensely significant sign of the times is the revival of interest in Old Testament prophecy that is beginning to be strongly felt in Anglo-Saxon countries. This book presents facts and considerations which everyone must sometime take into account, for they are destined to become important factors in world affairs.

<text>Svyatogor () is a mythical &quot;bogatyr&quot; (knight/hero) in Russian &quot;byliny&quot;. His name derives from the words for &quot;sacred mountain&quot;. Svyatogor&#x27;s tale, &quot;Ilya Muromets and Svyatogor&quot;, forms a part of the Ilya Muromets cycle. According to the epic, the mother-Earth cannot support the weight of Svyatogor, but he can not overcome the &quot;pull of the earth&quot; contained in the bag; when he tries to lift the bag, his feet sink into the ground. Svyatogor&#x27;s father is &quot;dark&quot;, he is blind - a sign of coming from another world.

After becoming a &quot;bogatyr&quot; of knyaz Vladimir the Bright Sun (Владимир Красное Солнышко, &quot;Vladimir Krasnoye Solnyshko&quot;), Ilya (another bogatyr) rides off to challenge Svyatogor, despite being forewarned not to do so by pilgrims who had miraculously healed him. On the road, Ilya Muromets sees a giant asleep on a giant horse. Ilya strikes him three times with his mace, with the only result that the giant, still asleep, grabs Ilya and puts him into his pocket. Eventually, the giant awakes, Ilya introduces himself and learns that the giant is Svyatogor; they become friends and journey together. They arrive at a giant stone coffin and both have a premonition that it is for Svyatogor. Ilya manages to lie down in the coffin first, but it appears too large for him, but it fits Svyatogor perfectly. When Svyatogor closes the lid, it seals the coffin. Before the coffin seals completely, Svyatogor passes part of his strength to Ilya through his breath.

Belarusian Rodnovers worship Svyatogor as a god.

<doc id="1275681" wikidata="Q75899" url="?curid=1275681" title="Paete">
<text>Paete, officially the Municipality of Paete (), is a municipality in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 24,945 people.

Along the shores of picturesque Laguna de Bay. It was founded in 1580 by Spanish friars Juan de Plasencia and Diego de Oropesa of the Franciscan Order. It is believed that the earliest inhabitants were of Malay lineage, coming all the way from Borneo in their swift and sturdy boats called &quot;Balangay&quot;.

==Etymology==
The name of Paete is derived from the Tagalog word &quot;paet&quot;, which means chisel. The proper pronunciation of the town&#x27;s name is &quot;Pī-té&quot;, long &quot;i&quot;, short guttural &quot;ê&quot;, sound at the end. The town was referred to as &quot;Piety&quot; by the American Maryknoll Missioners when they came to the town in the late 1950s.

==History==
===Precolonial era===
The Spanish friars had a tradition of naming towns they built in honor of saints. Paete was an exception. Legend has it that there was once a young Franciscan priest who was tasked by his superior to visit their newly founded settlements alongside Laguna de Bay. The priest knew little about the terrain so he asked a native the name of the place. The latter misinterpreted the young friar, thinking that the former wanted to know the name of the tool he was using. He answered, &quot;Paét&quot; (chisel), thus, the name Paete.

Sargento Mayor Juan de Salcedo was the first Spaniard to set foot in Paete. He was on his way to explore the gold-rich region of Paracale in Bicol. His men first encountered some resistance from the settlers of what is now Cainta in Rizal Province, but defeated the lightly armed natives. Then he ventured to the lakeside barangays of Laguna de Bay on his way to Bicol.

===Spanish colonial era===
Around 1580, Paete was established as a pueblo by the Friars. Juan de Plasencia and Diego Oropesa. Due to a death of the prior of Paete at that time, Paete was annexed to the Convent of Lumban. Then in 1600, Paete became a barrio of Pangil. In 1602, Paete became independent town having its own convent and was christened Pueblo de San Lorenzo in honor of the town&#x27;s first patron saint. The pueblo consisted not only of Paete, but included the neighboring towns of Pakil, San Antonio, Longos and Kalayaan. In 1671, Fray Francisco Soller reenacted the Via Crucis to resuscitate the people&#x27;s waning faith. He carried a cross from the town proper up to Mt. Ping-as in Pakil. In 1676, when Pakil became a separate pueblo, the townspeople of Paete wanted crosses of their own, so they built and located them in &quot;sitio&quot; Santa Ana, and named the site &quot;Tatlong&quot; &quot;Krus&quot; (Three Crosses). Paete regained its full township status only in 1850.

===American colonial era===
In 1899, American forces launched the Laguna campaign to subjugate the whole province and squelch insurrection. On the last leg of the campaign on April 12, an American battalion of 200 men invaded Paete but met strong resistance from an inexperienced force of less than 50 men. The town was subdued but it proved to be a costly battle for the Americans.

===World War II and Japanese occupation===
In 1942, Japanese troops occupied Paete, local recognized guerrillas and ongoing troops under the Philippine Commonwealth Army units were sieges and conflicts in Paete was fought against the Imperial Japanese military and local collaborators from 1942 to 1944 until retreat by local guerrillas from the Japanese hands. In 1945, combined Filipino and American soldiers, as well as recognized guerrillas liberated Paete and defeat by the Japanese and ended in World War II.

===Religion===
The only Catholic Church in the town is the Saint James the Apostle Parish Church which was first built in 1646.

Paete is also a pilgrimage site. One of the primary products of the town&#x27;s woodcarving industry are carving of &quot;pu-on&quot; or images of saints. The town&#x27;s patron saint is St. James the Apostle, also known as St. James the Great. Residents celebrate his feastday every 25 July. The 1st Patron Saint of Paete is St. Lawrence, the deacon.

St. Anthony the Abbot is a secondary patron of the town and his feast is celebrated by the townsfolk every January 17. The patron has a stone chapel locally known as &quot;Ermita&quot; as a shrine dedicated to him. There is a town legend related to the saint where a town native sneaked in the chapel during a conflagration and took a statue the St. Anthony to bathe it in the river. Following this, it began to rain and the fire was extinguished, an event considered as a miracle by the townsfolk.

==Economy==
The town has had a long reputation for its craftsmen highly skilled in wood carving and its embellishment. In 1887, José Rizal described Paete as a town where &quot;carpenter shops&quot; were issuing images &quot;even those more rudely carved&quot; (chapter VI, &quot;Noli Me Tangere&quot;). Even now, its inhabitants (called &quot;Paeteños&quot; or Paetenians) continue with their centuries-old tradition in carving and painting. Its statues, pulpits, murals and bas relief are found in churches, palaces and museums all over the world, including the St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome, St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, New York, the Mission Dolorosa in San Francisco, the San Cayetano Church in Mexico, the St. Joseph&#x27;s shrine in Santa Cruz, California, various churches in the Philippines and the Ayala Museum in Makati, Philippines. The official town hero is not a statesman nor a soldier but a woodcarver, the master artisan Mariano Madriñan, whose &quot;obra maestra&quot;, the lifelike Mater Dolorosa, was honored by the King of Spain with a prestigious award in Amsterdam in 1882. The town was proclaimed &quot;the Carving Capital of the Philippines&quot; on March 15, 2005, by Philippine President Arroyo.

Taka (taká), papier maché made using carved wooden sculpture used as a mold, also originated from Paete. It is also believed that the modern yo-yo, which originated in the Philippines, was invented in Paete.

Many descendants of these artisans have found a niche in the culinary world. Ice sculptures and fruit and vegetable carvings done by &quot;Paeteños&quot; abound on buffet tables of cruise ships and world-class hotels and restaurants. Today the town thrives mainly on the sale and export of woodcarvings and &quot;taka&quot;, tourism, poultry industry, farming and fishing.

<text>Astara District () is one of the 66 districts of Azerbaijan. It is located in the southeast of the country, in the Lankaran-Astara Economic Region. The district borders the districts of Lankaran and Lerik, as well as the Ardabil and Gilan provinces of Iran. Its capital and largest city is Astara. As of 2020, the district had a population of 110,000.

== History ==
=== Ancient history ===
A famous mathematician, astronomer and geographer Alexandria Claudius Ptolomey (AD 100 – c. 170) was one of the oldest researchers who also visited the territory of Azerbaijan. He compiled a map of the Caspian Sea in the second century, has given a clear overview on the geographical names, objects and settlements located on its shores. The names of many cities and villages belonging to Albania, as well as the name “Astara” (Greek: Astarata) are found on this map.

Another scholar of the ancient world, Strabon also pointed out the name “Astara” in his &quot;Historical Sketches&quot; (Historicahypomnemata). British traveler and explorer Anthony Jenkinson (1529 – 1610/1611) visited the coasts of the Caspian Sea in 1559 to establish trade relations between England and Bukhara. In 1562 he returned to London and published a book &quot;Russia and Persia&quot;. He pointed out the names of the villages, settlements and residential areas located on the coasts of the Caspian in his book. The name Astara was mentioned as Stara in Greek in the book.

Astara, which was located on historic Silk Road, established extensive trade relations with Middle East, Central Asia and Asia Minor, China, India and the Arab world. There was Caravanserai with very ancient history in the village of Kapchimahalla located in the southwestern part of Astara. The results of the researches of the remains of this caravanserai showed that the caravanserai belongs to the 7th century.

German traveler Hans Schillerberger (1394-1427), who traveled to different Eastern countries as well asto Azerbaijan, gave information onAstara&#x27;s international trade relations in his notes. The traveler noted that Astara is one of the centers of production of silk in Azerbaijan. The best type of silk produced in Astarawas exported to Damascus, Bursa, Kashan and Venice.

In the Middle Ages Astara was one of the religious, cultural and commercial centers in Azerbaijan. Especially pottery cultivation was the leading industry in the city. Later 13th century and earlier 14th century monetary was existed in the village of Mashkhan in Astara. Russian scientist A.M.Markov deeply investigated the coins produced in Derbent, Shamakhi and Tabriz, as well as in Astara. He gave detailed information about monetary in Astara. The scientist proves that the cities, which names written on the coins are present-day Azerbaijani cities. The Hulakis, Jalaris, Teymuris, their successors that ruled in different periods, minted coins in the Astara monetary. Coins of Amir Teymur&#x27;s period and next period with legend &quot;Zarbe Astara&quot; are the coins, minted in Astara. This was proved in the works of European scientists. 16 pattern of these coins preserved in the Historical Institute, the Tajikistan National Academy of Sciences at present.

As of 1747 Astara was the capital of Talish district. Then the capital was moved from Astara to Lankaran. During moving many ancient construction and architecture objects, fortifications were destroyed. German traveler Adam Oleary (1599-1671), who was also a scientist, visited Astara in 1638 and gave certain interesting information about its territory, residents and culture. The traveler pointed out in his notes that Astara was located on the shore of the Caspian Sea. There were very large grapevines. Strabon also wrote this fact in his book. According to Strabon, one small grapevine yielded a basket of harvest in the places, named Hikaniya at that time. A big chapter of the book &quot;Turkic countries&quot; written by Hungarian traveler Armin Vanberin (1832-1913) was about Azerbaijan. The traveler mentioned in his book that he was in Astara and observed the local population who had beautiful folk patterns.

Famous French scientist, archeologist and traveler Jak De Morgan (1856-1934) also visited Astara. He said that he was astonished at over ground and underground recourses: &quot;Astara is an ancient Russian town. It plays role of custom-house between Iran and Azerbaijan, as well as keeps its former peculiarity. Now it is just custom-house. Astara is exit of caravanserais and ships from Azerbaijan to Iran (Ardabil)&quot;. Famous French writer Alexander Duma gave interesting information about Astara as well.

<doc id="1275696" wikidata="Q2675024" url="?curid=1275696" title="Maresfield">
<text>Maresfield is a village and civil parish in the Wealden District of East Sussex, England. The village itself lies 1.5 miles (2.4 km) north from Uckfield; the nearby villages of Nutley and Fairwarp; and the smaller settlements of Duddleswell and Horney Common; and parts of Ashdown Forest all lie within Maresfield parish.

==History==
The origin of name of the village is uncertain, but the first element may derive from the Old English word &quot;mere&quot; meaning &#x27;pool&#x27;; the second element is certainly &quot;feld&quot; meaning &#x27;open land&#x27; (A. Mawer, &quot;The place-names of Sussex&quot; volume 2, page 349). Iron has also played an important role in the history of the area, during the time when the Wealden iron industry was flourishing. Within 2 miles (3 km) of Maresfield Church in the 16th century were five iron furnaces: Oldlands, Hendall, Old Forge, Lower Marshalls and Maresfield (powder mills). The Levett family owned and worked Oldlands, and it probably controlled Hendall as well, before it passed into the hands of Ralph Hogge, who formerly worked for the Levett family.

Among families long resident in the Maresfield area with historic ties to the old iron industry were the families of Levett, Pope and Chaloner, who had intermarried. William Levett of Buxted, a vicar who was a prime mover behind the iron industry in the Weald, had ties to the Maresfield area during his tenure as an ironmaster and supplier of armaments to Henry VIII. Eventually the vicar&#x27;s former servant Ralph Hogge, who had become a major ironmaster after Levett&#x27;s death, operated four furnaces and one or more forges within a couple of miles of Maresfield Church.

The village has expanded in the past twenty years, and three substantial housing developments have helped to increase the village population.

Maresfield is an old village (its church was founded in approx 1100; the present nave and tower were built between 1375 and 1415). Fairwarp and Nutley developed as offshoots from it.https://sussexparishchurches.org/church/maresfield-st-bartholomew/

There was a Roman settlement, including a bloomery, and later a Norman village grew up around the church. In the 15th and 16th centuries

===Manor===

Until 1926, it was a largely agricultural village, up to 1914 effectively in the ownership and control of the family in Maresfield Park House, initially the Shelley family and then Count Alexander Münster of Hanover, Germany. The estate was confiscated in 1914 by the government after the start of World War I and the Park and estate houses were sold off in 1924 as reparation for war damage, the Park being broken up into housing plots. In the First World War, a large army camp was developed, and later on parts of the village, at Queen&#x27;s Drive and the southern part of Parklands, were developed as married quarters for soldiers.

During the Second World War another large army camp was established to the west of the village, the land on which it was built now redeveloped for housing and the Ashdown Business Park

==Development==
There has been considerable recent development. Since approx 1990, substantial developments at the Cabin Café (now Mulberry Park), Park Farm (now The Paddock, Field End and Maple Close) and at Forest Park have increased the population of the village by about 1/3rd. New development of 80 dwellings is planned for Park Farm, which will further enlarge the village by about 1/6th.

==Governance==
There are 14 members on the Maresfield Parish Council, which has its offices in Nutley.

==Geography==
Maresfield is on the southern edge of Ashdown Forest which was a deer hunting reserve from the time of King Edward II of England.

The Site of Special Scientific Interest Rock Wood falls within the parish. This woodland is of biological interest, with uncommon mosses and ferns growing alongside the stream which flows through the site.

===Nutley===

Nutley is a village on the main road (A22) north of Maresfield. It has its own church, dedicated to St James the Less, although the benefice is combined with Maresfield.

===Fairwarp===
Fairwarp is a small village directly north of Maresfield. The church is Christ Church.

==Transport==
The parish lies at the junction of two main roads: the A22 Eastbourne road; and the A272 cross-country road, the main road being on a bypass to the west of the village.

There are two local bus services 31, 256 that provide a local connection to surrounding areas.

==Sport and leisure==
Maresfield has a local tennis club, cricket club, football club and a gymnastics club all located in less than one mile radius of the Chequers Inn. As of 2024, the bowls club has closed, and the cricket club only has two friendly matches arranged. Maresfield is also home to Underhill Fishing Lake, managed by the Crowborough and District Anglers Association.

==Education==
Maresfield has its own primary school in Bonners CE Primary School, although some children travel to Manor Primary School in Uckfield. Secondary school children travel into Uckfield College or Chailey School.

==Conservation==
The Constitution of Maresfield Conservation Group, which is a Registered Charity, has as its aims the promotion of the conservation, protection and improvement of the physical and natural environment in Maresfield and the surrounding area. Presently the Group is involved in a very wide range of projects.

==Amenities==

At the centre of the village is the Grade II* listed 17th century &quot;Chequers Inn&quot; and Maresfield church founded in approx 1100.

There is also the Maresfield recreation ground, which is home to the &#x27;Maresfield Cricket Club&#x27;, which was established in 1756.

The recreation ground was donated to Maresfield Parish Council by Hervey Charles Pechell in 1897 in commemoration of Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee, and a commemorative oak was planted by the Empress Frederick, Victoria&#x27;s eldest daughter.

The recreation ground wasn&#x27;t legally transferred until 1899 when Alexander Münster had inherited all of the Maresfield Estate from his friend Pechell, though the plaque on the lamp at the entrance to the ground records the gift from the Pechells.

==Freedom of the Parish==
The following people and military units have received the Freedom of the Parish of Maresfield.

===Military Units===
* 5 (Maresfield) Squadron 11 (Royal School of Signals) Signal Regiment: 27 June 2021.
