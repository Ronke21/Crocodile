<text>Amahl and the Night Visitors is an opera in one act by Gian Carlo Menotti with an original English libretto by the composer. It was commissioned by NBC and first performed by the NBC Opera Theatre on December 24, 1951, in New York City at NBC Studio 8H in Rockefeller Center, where it was broadcast live on television from that venue as the debut production of the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;. It was the first opera specifically composed for television in the United States.

==Composition history==
Menotti was commissioned by Peter Herman Adler, director of NBC&#x27;s new opera programming, to write the first opera for television. The composer had trouble settling on a subject for the opera, but took his inspiration from Hieronymus Bosch&#x27;s &quot;The Adoration of the Magi&quot; hanging in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

As the airdate neared, Menotti had yet to finish the score. The singers had little time to rehearse, and received the final passages of the score just days before the broadcast. The composer&#x27;s partner Samuel Barber was brought in to complete the orchestrations. After the dress rehearsal, NBC Symphony conductor Arturo Toscanini told Menotti, &quot;This is the best you&#x27;ve ever done.&quot;

Menotti distinctly wanted Amahl to be performed by a boy. In the &quot;Production Notes&quot; contained in the piano-vocal score he wrote: &quot;It is the express wish of the composer that the role of Amahl should always be performed by a boy. Neither the musical nor the dramatic concept of the opera permits the substitution of a woman costumed as a child.&quot;

==Genesis==

The booklet with the original cast recording contains the following anecdote:

This is an opera for children because it tries to recapture my own childhood. You see, when I was a child I lived in Italy, and in Italy we have no Santa Claus. I suppose that Santa Claus is much too busy with American children to be able to handle Italian children as well. Our gifts were brought to us by the Three Kings, instead.
I actually never met the Three Kings—it didn&#x27;t matter how hard my little brother and I tried to keep awake at night to catch a glimpse of the Three Royal Visitors, we would always fall asleep just before they arrived. But I do remember hearing them. I remember the weird cadence of their song in the dark distance; I remember the brittle sound of the camel&#x27;s hooves crushing the frozen snow; and I remember the mysterious tinkling of their silver bridles.

My favorite king was King Melchior, because he was the oldest and had a long white beard. My brother&#x27;s favorite was King Kaspar. He insisted that this king was a little crazy and quite deaf. I don&#x27;t know why he was so positive about his being deaf. I suspect it was because dear King Kaspar never brought him all the gifts he requested. He was also rather puzzled by the fact that King Kaspar carried the myrrh, which appeared to him as a rather eccentric gift, for he never quite understood what the word meant.

To these Three Kings I mainly owe the happy Christmas seasons of my childhood and I should have remained very grateful to them. Instead, I came to America and soon forgot all about them, for here at Christmas time one sees so many Santa Clauses scattered all over town. Then there is the big Christmas tree in Rockefeller Plaza, the elaborate toy windows on Fifth Avenue, the one-hundred-voice choir in Grand Central Station, the innumerable Christmas carols on radio and television—and all these things made me forget the three dear old Kings of my old childhood.

But in 1951 I found myself in serious difficulty. I had been commissioned by the National Broadcasting Company to write an opera for television, with Christmas as deadline, and I simply didn&#x27;t have one idea in my head. One November afternoon as I was walking rather gloomily through the rooms of the Metropolitan Museum, I chanced to stop in front of the Adoration of the Kings by Hieronymus Bosch, and as I was looking at it, suddenly I heard again, coming from the distant blue hills, the weird song of the Three Kings. I then realized they had come back to me and had brought me a gift.

I am often asked how I went about writing an opera for television, and what are the specific problems that I had to face in planning a work for such a medium. I must confess that in writing &quot;Amahl and the Night Visitors,&quot; I hardly thought of television at all. As a matter of fact, all my operas are originally conceived for an ideal stage which has no equivalent in reality, and I believe that such is the case with most dramatic authors. —Gian-Carlo Menotti
==Premiere==
Menotti wrote &quot;Amahl&quot; with the stage in mind, even though it was intended for broadcast. &quot;On television you&#x27;re lucky if they ever repeat anything. Writing an opera is a big effort and to give it away for one performance is stupid.&quot; The composer appeared on-screen in the premiere to introduce the opera and give the background of the events leading up to its composition. He also brought out director Kirk Browning and conductor Thomas Schippers to thank them on-screen.

&quot;Amahl&quot; was seen on 35 NBC affiliates coast to coast, the largest network hookup for an opera broadcast to that date. An estimated five million people saw the live broadcast, the largest audience ever to see a televised opera.

==Performance history==

===1951–1962===
For its first three telecasts, the program had been presented in black-and-white (there were two presentations of it in 1952, one on Easter and one during the Christmas season), but beginning in 1953, it was telecast in color. Because it was an opera, and commercial network television executives had increasingly little confidence in presenting opera on television, it later began to be scheduled, with rare exceptions, as an afternoon television program, rather than shown in prime time as had been done in its first few telecasts. According to &quot;The New Kobbe&#x27;s Complete Opera Book&quot;, the first stage performance was presented at Indiana University Bloomington, on February 21, 1952, with conductor Ernest Hoffman. The opera&#x27;s second performance was in Boston on December 18 and 19, 1952. It was presented by the Opera Club at the Agassiz Theatre of Radcliffe College, under the direction of Thomas H. Phillips for the Longy School of Music. James Hercules Sutton, 9, soloist for Alfred Nash Patterson at the Church of the Advent, played Amahl; Claire Smith played the mother; Walter Lambert, Paul Johnson and Hermann Gantt played the three kings.

===1963–1966===
For years, Amahl and the Night Visitors was presented live, but in 1963 it was videotaped by NBC with conductor Herbert Grossman and an all-new cast featuring Kurt Yaghjian as Amahl, Martha King as the Mother, and John McCollum, Willis Patterson, and Richard Cross as the Three Kings. This was the first television production of &quot;Amahl&quot; in which the role of King Balthazar was sung by a real African-American. Earlier productions, including the 1951 original version, had had a white man in blackface singing the role. When Menotti found out that NBC had scheduled the taping on a date when he was out of the country, he tried to get the date changed. The network refused and recorded the 1963 performance without the composer&#x27;s presence or participation, telecasting it in December 1963, and twice more after that — in 1964 and 1965. Menotti never approved of the 1963 production, and in May 1966 when the rights to future broadcasts reverted to him, the composer refused to allow it to be shown again. Because of this, &quot;Amahl&quot; was not shown on television at all between 1966 and 1978.

===1978===
In 1978, a new production starring Teresa Stratas as Amahl&#x27;s mother, Robert Sapolsky as Amahl, and Willard White, Giorgio Tozzi and Nico Castel as the Three Kings was filmed by NBC, partly on location in the Holy Land. As was the norm for filmed opera, the music was pre-recorded and the singers mimed their performances to the playback. It did not, however, become an annual tradition the way the 1951 and 1963 versions had.

===BBC productions===
The BBC made several productions of &quot;Amahl and the Night Visitors&quot; in the 1950s. The first performance was broadcast on December 20, 1953, with Charles Vignoles as Amahl, and Gladys Whitred as his mother. The Three Kings were sung by John Lewis (Kaspar), Scott Joynt (Balthasar), and John Cameron (Melchior). Edric Connor was the Page and Josephine Gordon was the dancer. The opera was produced by Christian Simpson and the conductor was Stanford Robinson.
This performance was so successful that it was repeated on Christmas Eve 1954 with substantially the same cast apart from the Page sung by John Carvalho and the dancer, Betty Ferrier. 
Both performances were broadcast live. A telerecording of the 1954 performance was broadcast on Christmas Eve 1956 but this recording seems to have been discarded.
An audio recording of the 1954 performance exists in private hands.

Further performances followed in subsequent years. The 1955 performance was also produced by Christian Simpson, starring Malcolm Day as Amahl, with Gladys Whitred as Amahl&#x27;s mother. Music was provided by the Sinfonia of London. It appears that this performance was also broadcast live. It was either not recorded or the recording was discarded. It does not exist in the BBC Archives. 
The second production was broadcast on December 24, 1959. This version exists as a 35 mm telerecording in the BBC Archives. This version was again produced by Christian Simpson and starred Christopher Nicholls as Amahl and Elsie Morison as Amahl&#x27;s mother. This time music was provided by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.

===1957 Australian TV version===
A version was broadcast on ABC on Australian television in 1957. It was aired live in Melbourne on 18 December 1957, and was kinescoped to be shown in Sydney on Christmas Day. It is not known if the kinescope recording still exists.

== Roles ==
==Synopsis==
:Place: Near Bethlehem.
:Time: The first century, just after the birth of Christ

Amahl, a disabled boy who can walk only with a crutch, has a problem with telling tall tales. He is sitting outside playing his shepherd&#x27;s pipe when his mother calls for him (&quot;Amahl! Amahl!&quot;). After much persuasion, he enters the house but his mother does not believe him when he tells her there is an amazing star &quot;as big as a window&quot; outside over their roof (&quot;O Mother You Should Go Out and See&quot;; &quot;Stop Bothering Me!&quot;).

Later that night, Amahl&#x27;s mother weeps, praying that Amahl not become a beggar (&quot;Don&#x27;t Cry Mother Dear&quot;). After bedtime (&quot;From Far Away We Come&quot;), there is a knock at the door and the mother tells Amahl to go see who it is (&quot;Amahl ... Yes Mother!&quot;). He is amazed when he sees three splendidly dressed kings (the Magi). At first the mother does not believe Amahl, but when she goes to the door to see for herself, she is stunned. The Three Kings tell the mother and Amahl they are on a long journey to give gifts to a wondrous Child and they would like to rest at their house, to which the mother agrees (&quot;Good Evening!&quot;; &quot;Come In!&quot;), saying that all she can offer is &quot;a cold fireplace and a bed of straw&quot;. The mother goes to fetch firewood, and Amahl seizes the opportunity to speak with the kings. King Balthazar answers Amahl&#x27;s questions about his life as a king and asks what Amahl does. Amahl responds that he was once a shepherd, but his mother had to sell his sheep. Now, he and his mother will have to go begging. Amahl then talks with King Kaspar, who is childlike, eccentric, and a bit deaf. Kaspar shows Amahl his box of magic stones, beads, and licorice, and offers Amahl some of the candy (&quot;Are You a Real King?&quot;; &quot;This is My Box&quot;). The mother returns (&quot;Amahl, I Told You Not to Be a Nuisance!&quot;). He defends himself, saying &quot;They kept asking me questions,&quot; when of course it has in fact been Amahl asking the kings questions. Amahl is told to go fetch the neighbors (&quot;All These Beautiful Things&quot;; &quot;Have You Seen a Child?&quot;) so the kings may be fed and entertained properly (&quot;Shepherds! Shepherds!&quot;; &quot;Emily! Emily&quot;; &quot;Olives and Quinces&quot;; &quot;Dance of the Shepherds&quot;).

After the neighbors have left and the kings are resting, the mother attempts to steal for her son some of the kings&#x27; gold that was meant for the Christ Child (&quot;All That Gold&quot;). She is thwarted by the kings&#x27; page (&quot;Thief! Thief!&quot;). When Amahl wakes to find the page grabbing his mother, he attacks him (&quot;Don&#x27;t You Dare!&quot;). Seeing Amahl&#x27;s defense of his mother and understanding the motives for the attempted theft, King Melchior says she may keep the gold as the Holy Child will not need earthly power or wealth to build his kingdom (&quot;Oh, Woman, You Can Keep That Gold&quot;). The mother says she has waited all her life for such a king and asks the kings to take back the gold. She wishes to send a gift but has nothing to send. Amahl, too, has nothing to give the Child except his crutch (&quot;Oh, No, Wait&quot;). When he offers it to the kings, his leg is miraculously healed (&quot;I Walk, Mother&quot;). With permission from his mother, he leaves with the kings to see the Child and give his crutch in thanks for being healed.

==Recordings==
For several years it was assumed that the film (kinescope) of the original telecast had been lost, but a copy was found, transferred to video, and is now available at The Paley Center for Media (formerly The Museum of Television &amp; Radio) and online at the Museum of Broadcast Communications.

The original 1951 telecast has never been rebroadcast, although bootleg recordings have been made. A kinescope of the 1955 broadcast starring Bill McIver as Amahl was digitized in 2007 and is available commercially on DVD. The 1955 and 1978 productions are the only ones released on video. Cast recordings of both the 1951 and the 1963 productions were released on LP by RCA Victor, and the 1951 cast recording was reissued on compact disc in 1987. The 1963 recording of &quot;Amahl&quot; was the first recording of the opera made in stereo.

==Legacy==
&quot;Amahl and the Night Visitors&quot; was the first network television Christmas special to become an annual tradition. There had already been several television productions of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; since about 1947, but they had not been shown annually or presented by the same television network, with the same general technical staff, as &quot;Amahl&quot; was. Until 1963, &quot;Amahl&quot; was nearly always presented with many of the same singers and production staff. From 1951 until 1966 it was presented every year on NBC (which commissioned Menotti to write it) on or around Christmas Eve, as an episode of an existing anthology series, such as &quot;The Alcoa Hour&quot;, &quot;NBC Television Opera&quot;, or the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;. The 1978 production of &quot;Amahl&quot; also premiered on NBC, before it went to cable television in the early 1980s.

A film based on &quot;Amahl&quot;, &quot;Amahl and the Night Visitors&quot;, was made in Britain in 1996 by Christine Edzard.

<doc id="1266809" wikidata="Q942549" url="?curid=1266809" title="Paramotor">
<text>Paramotor is the generic name for the harness and propulsive portion of a powered paraglider (&quot;PPG&quot;). There are two basic types of paramotors: foot launch and wheel launch.

Foot launch models consist of a frame with harness, fuel tank, engine, and propeller. A hoop with protective netting primarily keeps lines out of the propeller. The unit is worn like a large backpack to which a paraglider is attached through carabiners.

Wheel launch units either come as complete units with their own motor and propeller, or as an add-on to a foot-launch paramotor. They usually have three (trike) or four (quad) wheels, with seats for one or two occupants. These are distinct from powered parachutes which are generally much heavier, more powerful, and have different steering.

The term was first used by Englishman Mike Byrne in 1980 and popularized in France around 1986 when La Mouette began adapting power to the then-new paraglider wings.

Power plants are almost exclusively small two-stroke internal combustion engines, between 80 cc and 350 cc, that burn a mixture of gasoline and oil. These engines are favored for their high thrust-to-weight ratio of engine plus fuel; they use approximately 3.7 litres (1 US Gal.) of fuel per hour depending on paraglider efficiency, the weight of unit plus pilot, and weather conditions. At least one manufacturer produces a 4-stroke model with better fuel efficiency, which produces strong thrust at lower rotational speeds (RPM). Electrically powered units are also made, though flight duration is limited by battery weight. Csaba Lemak built the first electric PPG, flying it first on 13 June 2006. Wankel rotary engined paramotors are also available, but rare.

The pilot controls thrust via a hand-held throttle and steers using the wing&#x27;s brake toggles, stabilo steering, weight shifting or a combination of the three. Unlike unpowered paragliding, launching from an elevation or catching thermal columns to ascend are not required. Paramotor wings somewhat different from free flight &quot;paraglider&quot; wings have evolved; such wings are typically designed for a higher speed and may incorporate a &quot;reflex&quot; profile to aid stability in pitch, an idea taken from hang gliders of the 1980s, and developed and pioneered by British designer Mike Campbell-Jones. Paramotor wings typically use trimmers to adjust the angle of attack of the wing to decrease or increase speed. Trimmed out allows the pilot to achieve maximum speed, while trimmed in allows slower speeds, required for launching and landing. Trimmers usually act on the rear of the wing. The angle of attack can also be adjusted by a pulley-style system activated by a bar pushed by the pilot&#x27;s feet, called a speedbar. This system generally acts on the leading edge of the wing; it is only activated in-flight, and is not usually activated on takeoff or landing. Due to the torque effect of the motor, this can cause the glider to turn, especially under hard acceleration. Trimmers can be adjusted unequally to counter this effect.

The most difficult aspect of paramotoring is controlling the wing (paraglider) on the ground during launch and upon landing. Initial training in becoming a paramotor pilot involves managing the wing in the air from the ground without the motor. This process, called kiting, is the most complicated and important step in the process. Once kiting the wing on the ground is mastered, the motor is added to the process to practice with the weight of the paramotor included. A typical paramotor weighs on average around 50 lb (23 kg) with some models as light at 40 lb (18 kg) and some models as heavy as 75 lb (34 kg). The size of the paramotor wing and engine required depend on the weight of the pilot: the heavier the pilot, the larger the size of the wing and thrust required to launch. Most people in reasonably good health can foot-launch a paramotor; some pilots with artificial joints foot-launch. People with issues with the physical aspect of foot launching may opt to add a trike or quad to their paramotor, a platform to which the paramotor can be attached so it can be launched rolling on wheels.

Paramotoring has evolved, and as of the 2020s many advanced pilots perform extreme maneuvers such as wing-overs, barrel rolls and loops. These types of maneuvers present a significant danger, as if the wing is subjected to negative G it will unload, allowing its lines to go slack, losing lift. These maneuvers are typically practiced only by very advanced pilots, who wear a reserve parachute to use in case of loss of control.

<text>The National Organic Program (NOP) is the federal regulatory framework in the United States of America governing organic food. It is also the name of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) program responsible for administering and enforcing the regulatory framework. The core mission of the NOP is to protect the integrity of the USDA organic seal. The seal is used for products adhering to USDA standards that contain at least 95% organic ingredients.

The Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (OFPA) required that the USDA develop national standards for organic products, and the final rule establishing the NOP was first published in the Federal Register in 2000 and is codified in the Code of Federal Regulations at .

== Overview ==
The NOP covers fresh and processed agricultural food products.

The National Organic Program grew from fewer than twelve total employees in 2008 to approximately 37 in 2019 and 82 in January 2023. This growth has been due to increased annual funding appropriated by Congress since 2018.
The key activities of the National Organic Program are to:
* Maintain the Organic Integrity Database, a listing of certified organic operations, and help new farmers and business learn how to get certified
* Develop regulations and guidance on organic standards
* Manage the National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances
* Accredit certifying agents to certify organic producers and handlers
* Facilitate the work of the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB), a Federal Advisory Committee
* Provide training to certifying agents, USDA staff, and other stakeholders
* Engage and serve the organic community
* Investigate alleged violations of the organic standards and bring violators to justice

== Regulation ==
The Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 &quot;requires the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances which identifies synthetic substances that may be used, and the nonsynthetic substances that cannot be used, in organic production and handling operations.&quot; Under this act, the Secretary of Agriculture promulgated regulations establishing the National Organic Program (NOP) in 2000. It restricts the use of the term &quot;organic&quot; to certified organic producers (excepting growers selling under $5,000 a year, who must still comply and submit to a records audit if requested, but do not have to formally apply). Certification is handled by state, non-profit and private agencies that have been approved by the USDA 

NOP regulations cover in detail all aspects of food production, processing, delivery and retail sale. Under the NOP, farmers and food processors who wish to use the word &quot;organic&quot; in reference to their businesses and products, must be certified organic. Producers with annual sales not exceeding US$5,000 are exempted and do not require certification (however, they must still follow NOP standards, including keeping records and submitting to a production audit if requested, and cannot use the term &quot;certified organic&quot;).

Products labeled &quot;100 percent organic&quot;, &quot;organic&quot;, or &quot;made with organic ingredients&quot; must adhere to the Organic Production and Handling Requirements outlined in the regulation 7 CFR Part 205. A USDA Organic seal identifies raw, fresh, and processed products with at least 95% organic ingredients. A product that has not been certified organic by a USDA-authorized certifying agent may not bear the USDA organic seal. Products containing at least 70 percent organically produced ingredients may include a “Made with Organic” label to specify up to three ingredients or ingredient categories. They can not use the USDA organic seal or represent that the finished product is organic. Misuse of the USDA Organic seal on a product may lead to USDA compliance and enforcement actions, including fines up to $11,000 per violation. Misuse may also lead to the suspension or revocation of the violator&#x27;s organic certificate.

=== USDA accredited certifying agents ===
As of 2023, there are about 75 USDA accredited certifying agents (ACA), some of which also have satellite offices.

The NOP provides organic producers with resources to assist in becoming certified organic, including an organic program handbook (which includes guidance, certifier instructions, and policy memos), fact sheets, online training modules, and ways to identify accredited certifying agents. 

In 2022, USDA announced the Organic Transition Initiative to further support transitioning farmers.

=== International equivalency ===
Beginning in 2009, the US implemented an international organic equivalency agreement with Canada. In 2012 they implemented an agreement with the European Union (EU-Eco-regulation), and in 2014 with Japan and Korea. Under these agreements, USDA-certified organic products do not need to meet a separate set of standards before being exported to the market, and vice versa, as equivalency agreements essentially imply that the two sets of standards are equivalent despite a few small differences and do not require any additional certification for the specific market. These agreements streamline certification requirements and increase access to new market opportunities, while maintaining organic integrity of the respective markets.

== Support and assistance ==
The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Environmental Quality Incentives (EQIP) Organic Program provides financial and technical assistance to certain organic producers for implementing conservation practices.

==Controversy==
Certain types of agricultural systems have generated disagreement about whether they can be included in the certification. One of these systems is hydroponics, which do not rely on soil for production. In the regulatory process, hydroponics has been subdivided into the following operations:
* Hydroponics, growing plants in a water and nutrient solution usually in a substrate such as coconut coir 
* Aquaponics, which combines aquaculture, raising aquatic animals, and traditional hydroponics
* Aeroponics, which mist or spray the roots of the plants with water that contains water soluble nutrients.

The topic first came up at a meeting of the NOSB in April, 1995, which briefly stated that &quot;Hydroponic production in soilless media to be labeled organically produced shall be allowed, if all provisions of the OFPA have been met.&quot; The NOSB has made several proposals and recommendations since then but no action was taken until the fall 2017 NOSB meeting. At that meeting, the NOSB was only able to pass a motion to prohibit aeroponic systems in organic production. In 2018, the USDA issued a clarifying statement that the &quot;certification of hydroponic, aquaponic, and aeroponic operations is allowed under the USDA organic regulations&quot; and would consider the NOSB recommendation on aeroponics.

<doc id="1266812" wikidata="Q913025" url="?curid=1266812" title="Lebanese National Movement">
<text>The Lebanese National Movement (LNM; , &quot;Al-Harakat al-Wataniyya al-Lubnaniyya&quot;) was a front of Leftist, pan-Arabist and Syrian nationalist parties and organizations active during the early years of the Lebanese Civil War, which supported the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). It was headed by Kamal Jumblatt, a prominent Druze leader of the Progressive Socialist Party (PSP). The Vice-President was Inaam Raad, leader of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party and Assem Qanso of the pro-Syrian Lebanese Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party. The general secretary of the LNM was Mohsen Ibrahim, leader of the Communist Action Organization in Lebanon (CAOL).

The LNM was one of two main coalitions during the first rounds of fighting in the Lebanese Civil War, the other being the militias of the mainly Christian Lebanese Front, which comprised the nationalist Phalange, the National Liberal Party and others; as well as parts of the Maronite-dominated central government.

==Composition==
The Lebanese National Movement had its genesis in a previous organization, the Front of National and Progressive Parties and Forces – FNPPF (Arabic: &quot;Jabhat al-Ahzab wa al-Quwa al-Taqaddumiyya wa al-Wataniyya&quot;) or Front for Progressive Parties and National Forces (FPPNF), also known as the Revisionist Front, an alliance of anti-status quo political parties originally formed in 1969, which later ran in the 1972 general elections on a reformist secular platform. Overwhelmingly left-wing and Pan-Arabist in both its composition and orientation, the LNM claimed to be a &quot;democratic, progressive and non-sectarian&quot; broad organization that gathered parties and organizations opposing the Maronite-dominated sectarian order in Lebanon. It was reorganized as the Lebanese National Movement (LNM) in the 1970s, and led by Kamal Jumblatt as the main force on the anti-government side in the early years of the Lebanese Civil War.

Among the members were the Progressive Socialist Party (PSP), the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP), the Lebanese Communist Party (LCP) and several Nasserist and Marxist groups. It was also joined by Palestinian factions based in Lebanon&#x27;s refugee camps, mainly from the Rejectionist Front.

===Membership and political organization===
Its membership was overwhelmingly left-wing and professed to be secular, although the fairly obvious sectarian appeal of Jumblatt&#x27;s Progressive Socialist Party (PSP) and some of the Sunni Arab nationalist organizations in some cases made this claim debatable. However, to say that the LNM was an all-Muslim organization would be a gross oversimplification. Its main ideological positions were: the abrogation of sectarianism, political and social reforms, the clear proclamation of the Arab identity of Lebanon, and increased support for the Palestinians. In order to coordinate the military and political actions of the LNM an executive structure, the Central Political Council – CPC (Arabic: &quot;Majliss Tajammu al-kinda&quot;) or Bureau Politique Central (BPC) in French, was set up shortly after the outbreak of the hostilities at the town of Aley, a mountain tourist resort in the Chouf District, which became the military headquarters of the Front. The Council was presided over from its inception by Kamal Jumblatt of the PSP, with Mohsen Ibrahim of the OCAL appointed as Executive Secretary; after Kamal&#x27;s death in 1977, he was replaced by his son Walid Jumblatt, who led the LNM until 1982.

Among the participants in the LNM were the Lebanese Communist Party (LCP), the Communist Action Organization in Lebanon (CAOL or OCAL), the PSP, the Syrian Social Nationalist Party in Lebanon (SSNP), both a Syrian-led Ba&#x27;ath Party branch and an Iraqi-led Ba&#x27;ath Party branch, al-Mourabitoun (a Nasserist group) and several other minor Nasserist and Marxist groupings. Several Palestinian organizations joined the LNM, notably many from the Rejectionist Front. Both the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) were active participants.

The Shia Amal Movement, although supporting some of the LNM&#x27;s positions, did not join it formally.

===Minor groups===
Above and beyond this, an &#x27;alphabet soup&#x27; of other lesser-known smaller Parties were associated with the LNM.
* Revolutionary Communist Group – RCG 
* the Lebanese Revolutionary Party – LRP 
* the Front of Patriotic Christians – PFC 
* the Democratic Lebanese Movement – DLM 
* the Movement of Arab Lebanon – MAL 
* the Arab Revolutionary Movement – ARM 
* the Partisans of the Revolution 
* the Vanguards of Popular Action – VPA 
* the Organization of Arab Youth – OAY 
* the Units of the Arab Call – UAC 
* the Movement of Arab Revolution – MAR 
* the Sixth of February Movement 
* the 24 October Movement – 24 OM 
* the Lebanese Movement in Support of Fatah – LMSF 
* the Union of Working People&#x27;s Forces – UWPF 
* the Union of Working People&#x27;s Forces-Corrective Movement – UWPF-CM 
* the Knights of Ali 
* the Black Panthers

Most of them were marginal political organizations of revolutionary or populist trend (Arab nationalist, libertarian/anarchist, liberal/idealist, radical socialist, Marxist–Leninist, Hoxhaist, Trotskyist, or Maoist) that emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and despite their rather limited base of support, they were quite active. Anti-status quo, Pan-Arabist, and pro-Palestinian in policy, they strived for a social revolution that would transform Lebanese society, therefore sharing the same objectives as the leading LNM secular parties – the recognition of Lebanon as an Arab country and unwavering support for the PLO.

However, apart this minority of committed idealists, the vast majority of the remainder &#x27;movements&#x27; were actually façades or &#x27;shops&#x27; (Arabic: &quot;dakakin&quot;) – slightly politicised neighbourhood militias operating under grandiose pseudo-revolutionary labels – set up by PLO factions (mainly Fatah) in a misguided effort to widen its base of local support among the unemployed Lebanese urban youth. In most cases, their small, poorly disciplined, ill-equipped militia establishments were &quot;ad hoc&quot; formations made of lightly armed and largely untrained Christian or Muslim youths that rarely surpassed the 100-300 fighters&#x27; mark – about the size of an understrength company or battalion. Some groupings were lucky enough to possess a few technicals armed with heavy machine-guns and recoilless rifles but others, for the most part, fought on foot as light infantry, with small arms pilfered from the government forces, acquired on the black market or obtained via the Palestinian factions. Those groups either unable or unwilling to raise their own militias played a political role only by engaging in propaganda activities, keeping themselves out of the 1975-76 savage street battles and sectarian killings, with some of their militants preferring instead to join the medical relief agencies organized by the LNM.

The decline of the LNM in the late 1970s, culminating in its collapse in the aftermath of the Israeli invasion of June 1982, sounded the death toll for many of the minor Lebanese leftist organizations. As the war progressed, many of these small factions – at least the more politically oriented ones – were destroyed in the violent power struggles of the 1980s. For the most part forced to go underground, some evolved to Islamic fundamentalist groups, whilst the less politicized simply degenerated into criminal street-gangs that engaged in assassinations, theft, smuggling, and extortion. As a result, only a small fraction of the truly ideologically committed groupings managed to survive the war to re-emerge in the 1990s as politically active organizations.

===Military strength and organization===
At the beginning of the war in 1975, the different LNM militias were grouped into a military wing, designated the &quot;Common Forces&quot; (Arabic: القوات المشتركة, &quot;Al-Quwwat al-Mushtaraka&quot;), but best known as &quot;Joint Forces&quot; (LNM-JF), which numbered some 18,900 militiamen (not including allied Palestinian factions). Manpower was distributed as follows: the PSP militia (the People&#x27;s Liberation Army) and the LCP militia (the Popular Guard) each had 5,000 men; the SSNP militia had 4,000 men; the pro-Syria Ba&#x27;athists and pro-Iraqi Ba&#x27;athists had 2,000 and 1,500 men respectively. The others militias shared the remainder.

This number was to increase in the following months with the inclusion of 21,900 Palestinian guerrilla fighters from both the Rejectionist Front (RF) and mainstream PLO factions, later joined by 4,400 Lebanese regular soldiers from the Lebanese Arab Army (LAA) led by Lieutenant Ahmad al-Khatib who went over to the LNM-PLO side in January 1976. In the end, the LNM-PLO-LAA combined military forces reached an impressive total of 45,200 troops by March that year, aligned against the 12,000-16,000 right-wing troops their Lebanese Front adversaries were able to muster.
===Sponsor countries and organizations===
The LNM-JF received financial aid and arms from many countries such as Syria, Libya, Iraq and South Yemen, in addition to Palestinian support; besides lending their political backing and contributing with their organizational skills, experienced Palestinian cadres from RF and PLO groups provided weapons, equipment, and in many cases, military leadership to the Lebanese leftist militias. In addition, they also provided training, which was conducted at the refugee camps in the major cities or at PLO bases in southern Lebanon, mainly in the Beqaa Valley (a.k.a. &quot;Fatahland&quot;).

==Participation in the Lebanese Civil War 1975-1982==
As fighting escalated, the LNM allied itself with the umbrella Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and by early 1976 the LNM controlled 80% of Lebanon&#x27;s territory. But as its relations with Damascus deteriorated, the pro-Syrian Ba&#x27;ath branch, Union of Working People&#x27;s Forces and an important SSNP faction left the movement, and formed alongside Amal Movement the Front of Patriotic and National Parties.

In June 1976, the Syrian Army, fearing that a Palestinian victory would weaken its own strategic position, received a request from the Lebanese Front to intervene on their behalf. After strong initial resistance, the LNM/PLO forces began losing ground, and once the Arab states eventually approved the Syrian intervention after the Cairo and Riyadh conferences, the common forces accepted a cease-fire. The Syrian Army then took the role of peace-keepers, as part of Arab League&#x27;s Arab Deterrent Force (ADF), between the belligerents. In 1977, Walid Jumblatt became the head of the LNM after the murder of his resigning father, Kamal, in an ambush widely accredited to either pro-Syrian Palestinian militants or Lebanese SSNP agents working for the Syrian intelligence services. Despite this, Walid aligned himself with Syria, and maintained a good working relationship with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad (who had shared with his father a mutual distrust).

In 1978 the Israeli Operation Litani in southern Lebanon was partly directed against LNM militias, then fighting alongside the PLO after relations improved with Syria. In June 1982, the Movement was virtually dissolved after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and replaced by the Lebanese National Resistance Front – LNRF (, &quot;Jabhat al-Muqawama al-Wataniyya al-Lubnaniyya&quot;), which commenced resistance operations against the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in September of that same year.

<doc id="1266819" wikidata="Q2407956" url="?curid=1266819" title="Aliens of the Deep">
<text>Aliens of the Deep is a 2005 American documentary film directed in part by James Cameron alongside fellow cameraman and friend Steven Quale, who served as second unit director on Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997) and later &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009), and filmed in the IMAX 3D format. It was produced by Walden Media and Walt Disney Pictures. Cameron teams with NASA scientists to explore the mid-ocean ridges, submerged chains of mountains in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans that are home to some of the planet&#x27;s more unusual forms of life. It was released on DVD on November 1, 2005.

==Plot==
Cameron joins up aboard the Russian research vessel &quot;Akademik Mstislav Keldysh&quot; with a group of NASA scientists, as well as some American marine biologists, to investigate ten hydrothermal vents in both the Atlantic and Pacific. The vents have their own unique ecosystem, which support diverse organisms such as giant tube worms, swarms of blind white crabs, and vast amounts of shrimp which are capable of &quot;seeing&quot; water that is heated by the vents. These creatures do not require sunlight like other organisms, and instead obtain their energy from the vents. They are able to survive in the superheated and sulfurous water. Because of this, the documentary suggests that this is what life beyond Earth might look like. As some alien ecosystems are likely to be a lot harsher than a typical terrestrial ecosystem, these exotic vents provide an insight into some of the forms that alien life might take.

The documentary shows Cameron&#x27;s passion for exploring the oceans, as well as his interest in extraterrestrial life. It also showcases the technology employed to reach such depths.

The film is similar to Cameron&#x27;s earlier documentary, &quot;Ghosts of the Abyss&quot; (2003), which involves him journeying to the wreck of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;. It too was filmed in the 3-D IMAX format.

<text>Julian Thomas Peterson (born July 28, 1978) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker for eleven seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Michigan State Spartans. Peterson was selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the first round of the 2000 NFL draft. He also played for the Seattle Seahawks and the Detroit Lions.

==Early life==
Peterson attended Crossland High School in Temple Hills, Maryland. He was the 1996 Chesapeake Classic MVP.

==College career==
Peterson attended Valley Forge Military Academy and College for two years before attending Michigan State. In two seasons at Valley Forge, he recorded 39.5 sacks and was first-team NJCAA All-America and Seaboard Conference Defensive Player of the Year as a sophomore.

Peterson played college football at Michigan State University for his junior and senior year. As a junior, he was the honorable mention All-Big Ten pick by the media. As a senior, he was an All-American selection by &quot;Football News&quot; and the &quot;Sporting News&quot; after recording 15 sacks.

==Professional career==

===San Francisco 49ers===
Peterson was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the first round with the 16th overall pick in the 2000 NFL Draft. The 16th overall pick was acquired by San Francisco in a trade with the New York Jets. The Jets were originally given the pick by the New England Patriots, as a result of the controversy of Bill Belichick leaving the Jets’ head coaching position a few months prior to take the same role with the Patriots. As a rookie he started seven of 13 games recording 47 tackles, four sacks, and two interceptions. In 2002 Peterson was elected to the Pro Bowl for the first time after posting 94 tackles. In six seasons in San Francisco he recorded 394 tackles, 21.5 sacks, and five interceptions in 79 games and was elected to two Pro Bowls.

===Seattle Seahawks===

In his first season in Seattle, he was selected to the Pro Bowl for the third time after recording 89 tackles and a career-high 10 sacks. In his second season with the Seahawks he was selected to the Pro Bowl for the second straight year after posting 74 tackles and 9.5 sacks. During the 2008 NFL Training Camp, Peterson switched jersey numbers from #59 to #98, the number he wore during his previous tenure at San Francisco. In his third season with the team, Peterson made 86 tackles and five sacks, and was selected to his third consecutive Pro Bowl. In three seasons in Seattle, he recorded 249 tackles, 24.5 sacks, and three interceptions in 48 games and was elected to three Pro Bowls.

===Detroit Lions===
The Seattle Seahawks traded Peterson to the Detroit Lions for defensive tackle Cory Redding and a 2009 fifth-round pick on March 14, 2009.
On January 5, 2011, Peterson was given his release by the Lions.

<text>USS &quot;Smith&quot; (DD–17) was the lead ship of s in the United States Navy. She was the first ship named for Lieutenant Joseph B. Smith. Entering service in 1909, the destroyer was placed in reserve in 1912. She was reactivated for World War I and, following the war, was used as a test ship for aerial bombing. In 1921, the vessel was sold for scrapping.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Smith&quot; was laid down on 18 March 1908, by William Cramp &amp; Sons, Philadelphia, and launched on 20 April 1909, sponsored by Mrs. Edward Bridge Richardson. She was commissioned on 26 November 1909.

&quot;Smith&quot; was attached to the Atlantic Torpedo Fleet upon commissioning and, after three years of active service, was placed in reserve in October 1912. Reactivated with reduced complements in December 1915, for Neutrality Patrol duty off Boston, Massachusetts, &quot;Smith&quot; arrived in New Orleans, Louisiana on 10 December, for recruiting duty with the Naval Auxiliary Reserve. She arrived at Key West, Florida on 12 February 1916, and at New York, on 15 February, to continue recruiting duty.

===World War I===
With war imminent, &quot;Smith&quot; was ordered on 1 April 1917, to anchor in the North River, to assist the Collector of Customs in preventing the German ships at New York from escaping or destroying themselves. She departed New York, on 4 April, and operated with the Patrol Force along the East Coast from 10 April-14 May. On 17 April, she reported sighting a submarine which submerged, and then saw a torpedo wake cross her bow; however, neither inflicted damage on the other. &quot;Smith&quot; underwent overhaul at the Charleston Navy Yard from 17 May-16 July, during which time she prepared for distant service.

&quot;Smith&quot; departed Charleston, South Carolina on 16 July, and after a stop at Bermuda from 18–20 July, and three months of patrols in the Azores from 26 July-5 October, she arrived at Brest, France on 20 October. For the remainder of the war, &quot;Smith&quot; escorted eastbound and westbound convoys through the submarine danger area extending about to the westward of Brest. Her escort missions were largely uneventful and, despite several sightings of suspected submarines, she made no confirmed kills. She was called upon twice, however, to rescue survivors of torpedoed transports. On 31 May 1918, she rescued 240 men from , and, while carrying them into port, unsuccessfully attacked a submarine on 1 June. On 1 July, she rescued survivors from &quot;Covington&quot; while other destroyers circled the two ships at high speed to deter submarine attack.

===Inter-war period===
&quot;Smith&quot; underwent repairs in England from 16 September-3 November, and after the end of the war, at Brest, from 7 March-2 April 1919. She sailed for the United States on 11 May; and, after arriving at Philadelphia, was decommissioned there on 2 September. She was ordered sold on 28 February 1920, but was withdrawn from sale on 9 June, in response to a request from the Bureau of Construction and Repair for a destroyer, a submarine, and a battleship for exhaustive bombing experiments. On 18 September, &quot;Smith&quot; was anchored in Chesapeake Bay, with and , for the tests, which were completed on 5 November. &quot;Smith&quot; was then towed back to Philadelphia, and after again being designated a bombing target on 20 July 1921, was sold on 20 December, to Henry A. Hitner&#x27;s Sons Company of Philadelphia, for scrapping.

<text>Bryant Colby Young (born January 27, 1972) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive tackle for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish was selected by the 49ers in the first round of the 1994 NFL draft. Young was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2022. His bust was sculpted by Scott Myers and unveiled at the enshrinement ceremony on August 6, 2022.

==Early life==
Young was born in Chicago Heights, Illinois. He attended Bloom High School in Chicago Heights, Illinois, where he excelled in football.

==College career==
Young was a three-year starter at Notre Dame, lettering all four years from 1990 to 1993. As a senior, he was an All-American selection, and had 6.5 sacks and 67 tackles. As a junior, he was an Honorable Mention All-American selection and garnered 7.5 sacks. He graduated from Notre Dame in 1994 with a major in marketing.

==Professional career==
He was selected by the 49ers in the first round (seventh overall) in the 1994 NFL draft. Young made Honorable Mention All-Pro by The Associated Press in 1995. Young had his finest statistical season in 1996 recording 84 tackles, 11.5 sacks, and two safeties, while earning his first trip to the Pro Bowl. In 1997, although Young&#x27;s sack total dropped to just four on the season, he was still a dominant presence on the interior line, helping San Francisco finish first overall in the NFL in total defense that season. Despite his drop in statistical production, he was still widely considered by many to be the best all-around DT in the NFL, despite teammate DT Dana Stubblefield being named the NFL Defensive Player of the Year that same season. Young was leading the entire NFL at the DT position in sacks with 9.5 prior to his season-ending injury suffered on a Monday Night match-up against the New York Giants in week 13 of the 1998 season. The injury to Young&#x27;s leg was so severe that he needed a metal rod to be inserted in the broken leg. Despite Young&#x27;s devastating injury coming late in the 1998 season, he came back fully recovered in time for the 1999 season and recorded over 70 tackles, 11 sacks and a safety which earned him his second Pro Bowl. Young also received the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award for his fantastic play that same season. Bryant Young had 89.5 career sacks in his 14-year career with the 49ers, ranking him at 6th all-time in the NFL in career sacks for a player at the DT position, trailing only Trevor Pryce, Henry Thomas, Aaron Donald, and Hall of Famers John Randle, Steve McMichael, and Warren Sapp. He also ranks third on the team&#x27;s all-time career sacks list placing him behind only DE Tommy Hart and DE Cedric Hardman. Bryant Young also owns the 49ers&#x27; franchise record for career safeties, with 3. Young retired after the 2007 season, with the distinction of being the last active member of the Super Bowl team.

<doc id="1266840" wikidata="Q5524303" url="?curid=1266840" title="Garston, Liverpool">
<text>Garston is a district of Liverpool, in Merseyside, England. Historically in Lancashire, it is bordered by the suburbs of Aigburth, Allerton, and Speke. It lies on the Eastern banks of the River Mersey.

== History ==
In medieval times, Garston was home to a group of Benedictine monks. The first recorded mention of settlement in Garston is of the Church of St Michael in 1235. By the 19th century, the area had become a small village. Garston was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Childwall, in 1866 Garston became a separate civil parish, from 1894 to 1902 Garston was an urban district, on 1 April 1922 the parish was abolished and merged with Liverpool. In 1921 the parish had a population of 28,729.

A small dock was first built at Garston in 1793 for Blackburne&#x27;s Saltworks, which still stands today.

Garston&#x27;s growth accelerated rapidly in the 1840s, when in 1846, the area&#x27;s first dock was constructed and opened, under the auspices of the St Helens and Runcorn Gap Railway Company. The &quot;Old Dock&quot; was followed twenty years later by a second, the &quot;North Dock.&quot; The third and final dock, Stalbridge, was opened in 1907. In 1903, Garston was incorporated into the City of Liverpool. The population expanded as migrants flooded in to work on the docks, especially from Ireland.

==Description==
Today, Garston is a shipping and container port, with the Port of Garston second only to Liverpool Docks in the North-West. Although inside the city of Liverpool, Garston Docks are not a part of the Port of Liverpool and is regarded as a separate port. Much of the area is also residential, housing being mainly in Victorian terraces with semi-detached homes around Liverpool South Parkway.

Garston is partnered with the nearby district of Speke in a series of redevelopment and regeneration schemes, which have succeeded in reversing trends in dereliction and unemployment, and house prices have continued to rise.

==Etymology==

Grazing settlement root

&quot;Gaerstun&quot;, meaning &#x27;grazing settlement&#x27; or &#x27;grazing farm&#x27; in Old English, is one possible root of the name.

Garston as a name of a place may have its etymology informed by both Old English and Norse. The area that Garston was part of during the Viking Danelaw period would have been influenced by Norse speech. When Vikings settled they would sometimes change names because of speech difficulties. For example, the Saxon name for the city Eoforwic was changed to Jorvik. Shelton, was altered to Skelton, though the old English of &#x27;ton&#x27; meaning settlement was retained attesting to the development of language over time.

Spear root

Gar&#x27;, from Old English (spear, dart, javelin, shaft, arrow, weapon) from Norwegian and Icelandic (spear) and Old Norse geirr (spear, arrow), may suggest that the name of Garston is a combination of Viking and Old English. Another meaning of the name has been suggested as being Gar&#x27; (Great) ston&#x27; (stone). Therefore meaning &quot;Great Stone&quot;. A name possibly meaning the place where spears or arrows were made. In the Anglo Saxon period the forests belong to landowners and their subjects. It wasn&#x27;t until the coming of William in 1066 that the &#x27;Forest Law&#x27; was introduced which claimed woodland as the hunting grounds for kings. Woodland covered approximately 15% of England in 1086 (this had dwindled to just 5.3% in 1905).

Neither of these names may be exclusive and whilst they may have a different etymological ancestry they may simply because of the way language develops have a common history. The etymology of &#x27;garden&#x27; is the same as yard and garth and derives from the Old English &#x27;geard&#x27;, meaning enclosure or hedge. So a hedged enclosure is the exact definition of a garden just as it is of a field.
Etymological conclusions

Geardton (Old English field) or Geirrton (Old Norse spear) or Garton (Old English spear, weapon), all omit the S. S is used in Modern English to suggest plural and possessive. Nouns, noun phrases and some pronouns generally form a possessive with the suffix &#x27;s&#x27;. This form, is sometimes called the Saxon genitive, reflecting the suffix&#x27;s derivation from a genitive case ending in Old English (Anglo-Saxon; a clitic).

This suggests at least two possible roots. Firstly one based on grazing as not geographically specific, unlikely to be fenced in, within the periods we are dealing with and secondly one based on specific activity or activities at a given point in a general location spear or arrow or weapon making, which is linked to a settlement, So a settlement where arrows were made is Geirr(s)ton or as it is now known, Garston, e.g. &quot;the place of the arrows&quot;.

==Transport==
Garston is home to Liverpool South Parkway railway station, a major interchange station opened in 2006 replacing Garston (1874–2006). Trains operate at regular intervals to the city centre, Southport, Manchester and Birmingham, and other locations. The 86 and 86A bus routes provide regular bus services from Liverpool South Parkway to the surrounding districts and the city centre. A regular bus shuttle to Liverpool John Lennon Airport is available from Liverpool South Parkway railway station.

==Attractions==
Garston was home to the &#x27;New Slaughterhouse Gallery&#x27; on St. Mary&#x27;s Road, which aimed to promote local artists as well as community regeneration in partnership with the Garston Embassy on Wellington Street but is now closed. Cressington and Grassendale Parks are nearby, and there is a public swimming pool on Long Lane.

A former venue, the Winter Gardens (since demolished), opposite the police station in Heald Street, hosted concerts, dances and other public events.

==Football==
In 1935, when Garston and indeed much of the south of Liverpool was expanding due to the mass development of council housing to replace inner city slums, as well as the significant development of private housing, the new South Liverpool F.C. was formed in 1935 to serve the area and set up base at the Holly Park stadium in Garston. The club went on to win the Welsh Cup in 1939 (despite being an English side and playing in the English non-league systems) and won a host of non-league football competitions over the next 50 years. However, they were forced to sell Holly Park after a fire in 1989 and folded in 1991, only to reform as a junior side in various locations in and around the city before settling at a site in Otterspool in 2000.

Although South Liverpool were never successful in their many applications to join the Football League, many of their players went on to play for Football League sides; most notably striker John Aldridge and midfielder Jimmy Case, who won major trophies in the great Liverpool sides of the 1970s and 1980s. Aldridge, locally born but of Irish descent, was also a Republic of Ireland international regular in the late 1980s and early to mid-1990s, representing his adopted country at two World Cups.

==Cultural references==

In Episode 2: Days 8 to 16 of the Peter Jackson documentary, The Beatles: Get Back, whilst recording in the Apple Corps studio, there is a humorous exchange between Paul McCartney and John Lennon with the latter asking in mock voice &quot;Are you talking to me?&quot;. It concludes with the McCartney response &quot;The most together man in Garston&quot;. 

The Beatles were very familiar with Garston as it is the village directly between Harrison&#x27;s home in Speke and McCartney&#x27;s in Allerton. In fact the McCartney home had installed a telephone line with a Garston exchange prefix. This was later referenced in the George Harrison recording &quot;Miss O&#x27;Dell&quot; from 1973. The song ends with Harrison saying “Garston six nine double two”. 6922 was the telephone number for the McCartney family home at 20 Forthlin Road, Liverpool, in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

&quot;I remember the great excitement at 20 Forthlin Road when we had the phone put in. I still remember the phone number: Garston 6922. George still remembers it. It’s ingrained.&quot;

A house in Garston was used in creating the artwork for the Arctic Monkeys album &quot;Favourite Worst Nightmare&quot;. The house and estate have been demolished and new houses occupy the site.

<text>The Rheinsender (&quot;Rhine transmitter&quot;) is an FM radio transmission site for the German Südwestrundfunk regional public broadcasting system. The Rheinsender is located near Wolfsheim, southwest of Mainz.

Historically the Rhinesender was a large medium-wave transmission facility near. The transmitter was established in 1950 and went on the air May 15, 1950. It belonged to SWR (until 1998 to SWF) and transmitted until the middle of the 1990s with 600 kilowatts, later reduced to 100 kilowatts. In 2012 the medium-wave mast got demolished.

Today SWR is using the smaller mast for FM transmission.

== History ==
From 1950 to 2003 two 150-metre-high guyed steel tube masts were used as the transmission aerial, which are insulated from ground and which were separated by an insulator in the mast construction electrically in two parts for double feeding as fade reducing aerial. By the usage of two masts a direction minimum toward the southeast was obtained according to international regulations when working with a transmission power of 600 kilowatts at nighttime.

Furthermore, there is a 114-metre-tall guyed steel tube mast, which is also insulated against ground. This mast, which is used as reserve antenna for medium wave broadcasting, has an FM-transmission antenna on its top. Furthermore, there is also a free-standing grounded lattice tower used for radio services in UHF/VHF-ranges.

After transmission power was reduced to 100 kilowatts a direction minimum toward the southeast was no longer necessary and running the transmitter with omnidirectional radiation was possible. Hence the second radio mast was obsolete and was demolished on February 26, 2003. On the remaining radio mast of the Rhine transmitter there are also aerials for FM broadcasting for SWR4 on 94.9 MHz with an output power of 5 kW.

At the site of the demolished radio mast, a further grounded free-standing lattice tower was built in 2003. On this tower in 2004 a cage antenna was installed, which was used for broadcasting the SWR programmes Dasding and SWR cont.ra, in the DRM-mode on 1485 kHz with an output power on 0.42 kW from 2005 to 2008.

<text>Kevan Courtney Barlow (born January 7, 1980) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Pittsburgh Panthers and was selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the third round of the 2001 NFL draft. He played in the NFL for the 49ers, New York Jets, and Pittsburgh Steelers.

==Early life==

Barlow played his high school football at Peabody High School in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As his team&#x27;s star player, he led them to the City League Championship three consecutive times.

During his high school career, Barlow was a two-time All-City selection, a Pittsburgh Post Gazette City League Player of the Year, and also a member of the Post Gazette Fabulous 22. Barlow was selected to play in the prestigious Big 33 Football Classic all-star game. He was compared to NFL hall of famer Curtis Martin during his high school career. After his senior season, he committed to playing for the University of Pittsburgh.

Barlow was inducted into the Pittsburgh City League High School Hall of Fame in 2017.

==College career==
Barlow attended the University of Pittsburgh where he played before entering the NFL draft. During his college career, he rushed 486 times for 2,324 yards (4.78 yards per rush) and 20 touchdowns.

In Barlow&#x27;s junior year, he was named to the All Big East team. He scored the final touchdown at Pitt Stadium at 7:06 PM, just minutes before a record crowd of 60,190 people rushed the field and tore down the goal posts.

Barlow played in the final college game at Three Rivers Stadium, gaining 274 rushing yards and scoring four touchdowns against the West Virginia on November 24, 2000. During this game, Barlow gained the most rushing yards against the Mountaineers breaking Syracuse&#x27;s Larry Csonka’s record of 216 yards in a game against West Virginia in 1965. When he left school, he was ranked 11th on the school&#x27;s career scoring list with 144 points and a total of three 200 yard games.

In 2010, Barlow was ranked top 10 in the Big East in multiple categories including rushing attempts (4th with 197), rushing yards (3rd with 1,053), rushing yards per attempt (7th with 5.3), rushing touchdowns (7th with 8), plays from scrimmage (3rd with 210), yards from scrimmage (4th with 1,187), touchdowns from scrimmage (8th with 9), and overall touchdowns (9th with 9).

Barlow was named in the list of the greatest running backs in the University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s history. He was also listed by ESPN sports analyst Mel Kiper Jr. as one of the top running backs available for the National Football League Draft. He finished 7th on Pittsburgh&#x27;s list for career rushing yards with 2,234.

==Professional career==

Barlow was drafted in the 3rd round (80th overall) of the 2001 NFL draft by the San Francisco 49ers and signed a $3.8 million contract over three years. Denver Head Coach Mike Shanahan congratulated the 49ers for picking &quot;the best back in the draft.&quot; He played a total of seven seasons in the NFL including five with San Francisco.

===San Francisco 49ers===

Barlow started his first professional game in the NFL on December 7, 2003, against the Arizona Cardinals, after the 49er&#x27;s starting running back Garrison Hearst was injured during the third quarter of a game against the Baltimore Ravens the week prior. The 49ers won the game 50–14 with Barlow rushing for 154 yards and a touchdown. Although he only started nine games, he finished the 2003 season leading the 49ers in rushing with 1,024 yards. He also rushed for 6 touchdowns and averaged 5.1 yards per carry. Barlow and Hearst combined to run for 1,792 yards during this year.

In 2002, after the 49ers training camp, Barlow played in an exhibition game against the Washington Redskins in Osaka, Japan as part of the American Bowl series.

After a breakout 2003 season in which Barlow had a 5.1 yard per carry average and 1024 yards, he became a restricted free agent. The 49ers gave him the starting job by releasing Garrison Hearst and signing him to a long-term deal for five years $28 million. The terms included $20 million, of an $8 million signing bonus fully guaranteed. Barlow suffered a knee injury that spanned for multiple games, crippling his play.

The 2005 season seemed to mark a rebound in his running game. His play was severely affected when he received another knee injury, cutting his season short. He had 420 yards on 102 carries for a 4.0 average through 7 games before being sidelined due to injury.

Barlow appeared in 72 games for the 49ers. He rushed for 3,614 yards and 24 touchdowns on 891 carries. He also added 1,143 yards on 137 catches.

===New York Jets===
Looking to replace Curtis Martin, after he suffered a serious knee injury, the New York Jets acquired Barlow from the 49ers on August 20, 2006, in exchange for their fourth round draft pick in the 2007 NFL draft. He was given an honorable mention by Bleacher Report as one of the best trades in the New York Jets&#x27; history. As part of the deal, the Jets assumed the remainder of his contract which had three seasons remaining at base salaries of $2.5 million (2006), $3.25 million (2007) and $4 million (2008).

Barlow appeared in twelve games for the Jets but only started three. He rushed for 370 yards and scored 6 touchdowns. Due to another knee injury, he was placed on injury reserve and was subsequently released on February 21, 2007.

===Pittsburgh Steelers===

After the Pittsburgh Steelers were unable to draft a running back during the 2007 NFL draft, Barlow met with the team on May 4, 2007, eventually signing a one-year contract with them on May 10, 2007. Barlow signed a one-year contract with the Steelers on May 10, 2007. He was expected to share running-back duties with starter Willie Parker. Barlow was released on August 27, 2007, due to a career-ending knee injury.

==Philanthropy==

While a member of the 49ers, Barlow would make routine visits to San Quentin State Prison to visit inmates and give them encouragement for post-prison life. Barlow also spent time reading to kids at different schools in the San Francisco area and also visited kids at UCSF Benioff Children&#x27;s Hospital.

Barlow has been a long-time advocate for children&#x27;s cancer charities. He has rallied with former San Francisco mayor, Lieutenant Governor, and Governor Gavin Newsom at charity events to combat breast cancer. In 2012, Barlow released a statement in support of new cancer treatments including a finding that folic acid playing a significant role in reducing the rates of two childhood cancers.

Barlow is also an outspoken supporter of the YMCA. He is involved in the YMCA&#x27;s day summer camp program and other programs for kids offered by the YMCA.

<doc id="1266867" wikidata="Q4837698" url="?curid=1266867" title="Babel Proclamation">
<text>The Babel Proclamation was issued by Iowa&#x27;s Governor William L. Harding on May 23, 1918. It forbade the speaking of any language besides English in public. The proclamation was controversial, supported by many established English-speaking Iowans and notably opposed by citizens who spoke languages other than English. Harding repealed it on December 4, 1918. The Babel Proclamation marked the peak of a wave of anti-German sentiment in Iowa during World War I.

== Rise in anti-German sentiment ==
As America became involved in World War I on the side of the Allies and against Germany, the nation saw a rise in anti-German sentiment. Nativism, which had existed before the war, became increasingly mainstream as a result of American intervention. The state of Iowa saw a particularly large rise in anti-German sentiment. On November 23, 1917, the Iowa State Council for Defense determined that German should not be taught in public schools and took actions to that effect, such as burning German books. Iowa also saw places that had German-related names renamed, such as Germania being renamed to Lakota. Some German-Americans were attacked for speaking their language in public. In 1900 there were 46 German-language newspapers in Iowa; 20 years later there were just 16.

== Description ==
The Governor of Iowa, William L. Harding, issued the Babel Proclamation on May 23, 1918. It stated that Iowa schools must teach their courses in English, public conversations had to be in English, addresses in public were to be given in English, and religious services were to be in English. Harding asserted that allowing languages other than English to be spoken &quot;disturbs the peace and quiet of the community&quot; and would lead to &quot;discord among neighbors and citizens.&quot; He maintained that all non-English languages could be used to spread German propaganda. He further argued that the proclamation would &quot;save the lives of American boys overseas by curbing sedition at home.&quot; Harding stated that the proclamation should be treated as law, although it was accused of violating the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech. He argued that the amendment did not apply to languages other than English.

In response to the mandate, there were several protests, including one led by a priest at St. Wenceslaus Catholic Church on May 30. Scandinavian speakers were not excluded from the discrimination; one Lutheran pastor wrote to his representative in May 1918 complaining that half his congregation would be unable to understand the service if it were not conducted in Norwegian, the language in which he had been preaching for the past 40 years. The next month, Harding stated that &quot;there is no use in anyone wasting his time praying in languages other than English. God is listening only to the English tongue.&quot;

However, it was generally popular among English-speaking, well established Iowans. Former US President Theodore Roosevelt publicly supported Harding&#x27;s decision in a speech given on May 27, saying &quot;America is a nation—not a polyglot boarding house... There can be but one loyalty—to the Stars and Stripes; one nationality—the American—and therefore only one language—the English language.&quot; Virtually all ethnic minorities who spoke languages other than English opposed the proclamation to some extent. The proclamation was seriously enforced, and many &quot;patriotic organizations&quot; issued fines to violators. The majority of violators were caught when telephone operators listened to conversations for violations. For instance, in Le Claire Township, Scott County, four or five women received fines after they spoke German over the telephone. They ended up paying $225, which was donated to the Red Cross. Nebraska issued a similar proclamation. Across the Midwestern United States, 18,000 people eventually faced charges of violating English mandates.

The proclamation became &quot;the major political issue&quot; in Iowa for 1918. &quot;The Des Moines Register&quot; led opposition, publishing several op-eds against the proclamation.A Jewish leader in Des Moines contacted Louis Marshall, then the president of the American Jewish Committee, for advice. Marshall responded that he couldn&#x27;t &quot;conceive the possibility that the people of any state could be guilty of such an absurdity.&quot; However, he advised the Jewish community to avoid publicly going against the proclamation. On June 13 Marshall wrote a letter of protest to Harding.

People debated the proclamation across the state and more generally what it meant to be &quot;American&quot;. Some newspapers called English &quot;American&quot;, as calling it English would suggest that it was &quot;borrowed, and therefore any European tongue would be as legitimate as English.&quot; After World War I ended, Harding repealed the proclamation on December 4, 1918.

== Legacy ==
A 2018 op-ed published in &quot;The Des Moines Register&quot; called the Babel Proclamation &quot;perhaps the most infamous executive order&quot; in Iowa&#x27;s history. Several articles have cited the proclamation as an early example of anti-immigrant sentiment. A hearing in the United States House of Representatives in 2006 called the proclamation &quot;the most famous&quot; of several &quot;English-only&quot; restrictions passed around the same time.

<text>Timothy F. Rattay (; born March 15, 1977) is an American football coach and former player who is the quarterbacks coach for the Oklahoma State Cowboys. Prior to becoming a coach, Rattay played as a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) and United Football League (UFL). He played college football for the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs, and was selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the seventh round of the 2000 NFL draft.

Rattay was also a member of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Tennessee Titans, Arizona Cardinals, and Las Vegas Locomotives.

==Early life==
Rattay&#x27;s high school career began at Mesa High School in Mesa, Arizona. He did not take snaps as a sophomore or junior at Mesa High before transferring to Phoenix Christian when his father, Jim, became an assistant.

Because he was a backup, Rattay did not play until his senior year at Phoenix Christian, where he set a school record with 40 touchdown passes in 1994.

==College career==

===Scottsdale CC===
Rattay was not scouted by a major college, so he played a year at Scottsdale Community College, where he beat out five quarterbacks ahead of him on the depth chart to earn the starting spot the week of the season opener. He led the nation&#x27;s junior-college quarterbacks in touchdown passes (28) and yardage (3,526).

===Louisiana Tech===
Tim Rattay then transferred to Louisiana Tech, in Ruston. There he set several NCAA records, finishing his career with the NCAA Division I-A records for average passing yards per game, 386.2, and total offensive yards, 12,643. He was in the top 10 voting for the Heisman in 1998, which is awarded to the most outstanding college football player. In 1998, he broke school records as a senior with 4,943 yards and 46 touchdowns to finish with what was, at the time, third in NCAA history in single-season yardage. His 1998 season is, as of 2020, 19th all-time. He finished his college career #2 all-time in passing TDs.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
===San Francisco 49ers===
Tim Rattay entered the league as the seventh-round pick (212th overall) of the San Francisco 49ers in the 2000 NFL draft. Rattay outperformed fellow rookie Giovanni Carmazzi, who&#x27;d been taken in the third round (65th overall, 147 spots ahead of Rattay), to earn a roster spot as a backup to starting quarterback Jeff Garcia. Starting in place of an injured Garcia, Rattay won 2 of 3 games in 2003, throwing 7 touchdowns and just 2 interceptions, before getting injured. When Garcia was released from the team in March 2004, largely due to salary cap constraints, Rattay was given the starting job. From 2004 to 2005 he went 2–11 playing for the 49ers.

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===
On October 18, 2005, Rattay was acquired by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for a 6th-round 2006 NFL draft pick from the San Francisco 49ers.

Late in the 2006 season, Rattay stepped in as the starting quarterback for the Buccaneers due to the poor play of Bruce Gradkowski. In the week 15 game against the Chicago Bears, he entered the game with Tampa Bay losing 14–3. Due to his strong performance, Tampa Bay tied the game at 31, but they eventually lost in overtime 34–31. This performance led head coach Jon Gruden to name Rattay as the team&#x27;s third different starting quarterback in the 2006 season.

===Tennessee Titans===
On May 9, 2007, Rattay signed as a free agent with the Tennessee Titans. The following month Gruden would name Jeff Garcia Rattay&#x27;s successor as the Buccaneers&#x27; starting quarterback. Rattay signed with Tennessee to be a backup before 2007&#x27;s training camp. He made the team&#x27;s 53 man roster, but was cut the next day.

===Arizona Cardinals===
On October 9, 2007, Rattay signed a one-year contract with the Arizona Cardinals as a backup to Kurt Warner, following a season-ending collarbone injury to starting quarterback Matt Leinart. Rattay would replace Warner in goal-line situations, where he went 3 for 3 with all 3 being touchdowns. Rattay declined to sign for another year, and decided to test the free agent market.

In September 2008, there were rumors that the New England Patriots considered signing Rattay after Tom Brady was lost for the entire 2008 season. In the 2000 NFL draft, the Patriots considered drafting Rattay but opted for Brady instead. 
The Patriots brought Rattay to Foxboro along with Chris Simms, but once they arrived, they were told that, since Matt Cassel had emerged, the situation had changed and Simms and Rattay were no longer needed in New England.

A month later, Rattay worked out with the Detroit Lions, but they never made an offer to him.

===Las Vegas Locomotives===
In July 2009, Rattay signed with the Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League. Head coach Jim Fassel said that Rattay would serve as the backup to J. P. Losman. On November 21, Rattay started for an injured Losman and led the Locomotives with two touchdown passes in a blowout win against the New York Sentinels.

On July 12, 2010, Rattay announced his retirement from professional football.

==NFL career statistics==


===Career achievements===
* Rattay is one of only three 7th-round or undrafted quarterback since 1995 (out of a pool of 30 such players) to pass for more than 400 yards in a game. Matt Cassel accomplished this twice in 2008, and Tony Romo in 2010. 
* Rattay broke the San Francisco 49ers team record for the most completions in a 31–28 win against the Arizona Cardinals on October 10, 2004, when he completed 38 passes, breaking Joe Montana&#x27;s record of 37.
* Rattay is the only quarterback in NFL history to throw three consecutive passes all going for touchdowns, as he did for the Arizona Cardinals in 2007.
* Rattay was responsible for the biggest comeback in Buccaneers history on December 17, 2006, when he led the team back from a 21-point 3rd quarter deficit against the eventual NFC Champion Chicago Bears, throwing for three touchdowns in the fourth quarter and sending the game into overtime before the Buccaneers lost, 34–31.

==Coaching career==

===Las Vegas Locomotives===
Following his retirement, Rattay joined the Locomotives coaching staff as wide receivers coach on July 18, 2011.

===Louisiana Tech===
Skip Holtz hired Rattay to be the Louisiana Tech wide receivers coach prior to the 2013 football season. After three seasons in this role, Rattay became the quarterbacks coach for Louisiana Tech, a role in which he served from the 2016 - 2018 seasons.

===Washington Redskins===
On February 8, 2019, Rattay joined the Washington Redskins staff as a quarterbacks coach.

===Oklahoma State Cowboys===
Rattay joined the Oklahoma State Cowboys football team as their quarterbacks coach on January 10, 2020.

<doc id="1266870" wikidata="Q1563735" url="?curid=1266870" title="Smith-class destroyer">
<text>The Smith&quot;-class destroyerswere the first ocean-going torpedo-boat [[destroyer]]s in the [[United States Navy]], and the first to be driven by [[steam turbine]]s instead of the [[triple-expansion engine|reciprocating engines]] fitted in the sixteen earlier and much smaller torpedo-boat destroyers ordered under the Act of 4 May 1898. and are sometimes considered to be Flusser&quot;-class ships. Also, since &quot;Flusser&quot; was completed first, some period documentation refers to the entire class as &quot;Flusser&quot;s.

The first three of the class were ordered under the Act of 29 June 1906 &quot;to have the highest practical speed, and to cost, exclusive of armament, not to exceed seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars each&quot;. The remaining pair were ordered under the Act of 7 March 1907 &quot;to have the highest practical speed, and to cost, exclusive of armament, not to exceed eight hundred thousand dollars each&quot;.

All of the ships served as convoy escorts in World War I, and several attacked U-boats. The latter four vessels were all sold in November 1919 following the end of World War I; &quot;Smith&quot; survived another two years as a bombing target until scrapped.

==Design==

These were the first turbine-powered destroyers in US service, and the last to be coal-fired. Surprisingly, turbines were dictated by cost; when bids were opened, all of the turbine-powered proposals were lower than all of the reciprocating proposals. The &quot;Smith&quot;s were greatly enlarged s; at 900 tons full load they were 50% larger. The extra displacement went into increased armament and more powerful machinery to maintain the &quot;Truxtun&quot;s&#x27; speed. The raised forecastle improved seaworthiness. Also, the coal capacity was increased to 304 tons, nearly half the total full load displacement of the previous class. The increased size and range meant that these were the US Navy&#x27;s first truly ocean-going destroyers, capable of operating with battleships on long voyages. The seizure of the Philippines in the Spanish–American War and the acquisition of Hawaii, both in 1898, had shown the need for long-range ships. Shortly before the &quot;Smith&quot; class entered service, the Great White Fleet of 1907–09 demonstrated that the US Navy was prepared to operate far from home. Ironically, these destroyers would quickly be nicknamed &quot;flivvers&quot; (after the small and shaky Model T Ford) for their small size when the subsequent &quot;thousand tonners&quot; ( through es) entered service in 1913.

It was recognized that destroyers would now be fighting other destroyers rather than torpedo boats, and that destroyers also needed more offensive (aka torpedo) capability to take over the torpedo boats&#x27; role, while retaining the range and seakeeping qualities to operate with the battle fleet. This was the beginning of the multiple missions that US destroyers would eventually be expected to perform, including anti-submarine warfare beginning in World War I and anti-air warfare beginning in the 1930s.

===Armament===

Compared with the &quot;Truxtun&quot;s, the gun armament was increased to five /50 caliber guns; smaller guns were deleted to maximize the number of larger guns. This followed a trend set by the rearmament of the British s in 1906, which reflected the &quot;all big gun&quot; design of the battleship . A third torpedo tube was added, and one torpedo reload per tube was provided. In 1911 it was noted that torpedoes fired from the stern mount at a ship&#x27;s speed much above 20 knots ran erratically due to the stern wave deflecting them.

In 1916, all had their single torpedo tubes replaced by twin mounts (with no reloads) while one 3-inch gun was removed. This was an easy upgrade, as the new design twin mounts actually weighed less than the older single mounts. They were equipped with one or two depth charge racks for convoy escort during World War I.

===Engineering===

Unlike the earlier 16 destroyers, these turbine-driven vessels were triple-screw. The ships&#x27; steam turbines were direct drive and arranged in a similar manner to Sir Charles Parsons&#x27; &quot;Turbinia&quot;, with a high-pressure turbine on the center shaft exhausting to two low-pressure turbines on the outboard shafts. Cruising turbines were also fitted on the outboard shafts to improve fuel economy at low speeds, a problem that would plague turbine-powered ships until fully geared turbines and higher steam pressures and temperatures were introduced during World War I. To attempt to find a middle ground between the turbines&#x27; high efficient speed and the propellers&#x27; low efficient speed, the maximum shaft speed was 724 rpm, over twice that of a modern ship.

All had two widely spaced pairs of funnels except for &quot;Smith&quot;, which had the first and fourth funnels separated from the middle pair.

&quot;Smith&quot; had four Mosher coal-fired boilers supplying steam to three steam turbines totaling (design). She made on trials at . Normal coal capacity was 304 tons.

<text>Frederick Jerome Beasley (born September 18, 1974) is an American former football fullback in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Auburn Tigers and was selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the sixth round of the 1998 NFL draft.

==High school years==
Beasley attended Robert E. Lee High School in Montgomery, Alabama and earned letters in football and track. In football, he was a two-time All-State honoree, won back-to-back state championships and as a senior, he was a &quot;USA Today&quot; All-USA selection and named an All-American by &quot;Parade&quot;. In track, he was a three-time State Champion on the decathlon.
His head coach was Legendary Hall of Famer Spence McCracken. His Home Economics teacher went out on maternity leave, so his full-time substitute was future State Champion basketball Coach Scott C. Davis.

==College career==
Beasley attended Auburn University, and was a star in football. He split time between fullback and tailback and finished his career with 1,241 rushing yards, 567 receiving yards, and 16 rushing touchdowns. In a 1997 game against the Georgia Bulldogs, a match widely considered the &quot;Deep South&#x27;s Oldest Rivalry,&quot; Beasley plowed over current Georgia Bulldogs head coach, Kirby Smart, who was attempting to tackle him.

==Professional career==
Beasley was selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the sixth round of the 1998 NFL draft with the 180th overall pick, and spent the next eight seasons with the franchise. At one time, Beasley was widely regarded as the best blocking fullback in the NFL. In 2002 and 2003, he was selected all-pro as a fullback. In 2003, he was named the NFC Pro Bowl team&#x27;s starting fullback. Following his release from San Francisco following the 2005 season, he signed with the Miami Dolphins but was released early in the season.

He signed with the Washington Redskins to a one-year contract. He was released on September 1, 2007.

<text>Andrew Burnaby (16 August 1732 – 9 March 1812) was an English clergyman and travel writer, mainly about the American colonies and Italy.

==Life==
He was born in Asfordby, Leicestershire, on 16 August 1732, the eldest son and namesake of the Reverend Andrew Burnaby, a well-to-do clergyman of the Church of England. The young Burnaby attended Westminster School, and then Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1754 and his master&#x27;s degree in 1757. After taking his BA he was ordained.

Shortly afterward he toured America, a trip which he later wrote up as a celebrated travelogue, &quot;Travels Through the Middle Settlements in North America, In the Years 1759 and 1760&quot;, which was published in 1775, and again in an enlarged form in 1798. He wrote about all of the things he saw in the colonies. His book avoids taking sides in the growing political struggles between the colonies and Britain, but he describes the discord among the states, the tensions between the colonists and the Indian tribes, and adverse &quot;climate&quot; in the south that &quot;renders them indolent, inactive, and unenterprising... in every line of their character&quot; as evidence that would prevent America from ever becoming a major power. 

After his return to Europe, he became Chaplain to the British mission at Leghorn in 1762. He was posted there for about five years, rising to become Proconsul (but actually doing the job of Consul), until his eventual resignation and return to England, where he was appointed vicar at Greenwich, Kent, from 1769. He wrote an account of his travels in Corsica and Italy in 1804, but this ran to only a few copies.

Burnaby was made Doctor of Divinity and Professor of Sacred Theology at the University of Cambridge in 1776. 

He married Anne Edwyn, daughter and heiress of John Edwyn of Baggrave Hall, Leicestershire, on 26 February 1770 at St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square, London. This renewed his Leicestershire connection and he was made Archdeacon of Leicester in 1786. Their grandson, Edwyn Burnaby, was the maternal great-grandfather of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and, therefore, the great-great-great-grandfather of King Charles III.

Burnaby died on 9 March 1812 at Blackheath, Kent, and was buried at Hungarton, Leicestershire. Anne Edwyn was baptised on 15 October 1735 at Hungarton, Leicestershire, and died there a few days after her husband, on 16 or 19 March 1812.

<text>Merkuriusz Polski Ordynaryjny (The Polish Mercury Ordinary; original 17th-century Polish spelling: &quot;Merkuryusz Polski Ordynaryiny&quot;; full title: &quot;Merkuriusz Polski dzieje wszystkiego świata w sobie zamykający, dla informacji pospolitej&quot;: The Polish Mercury, Encompassing All the World&#x27;s Affairs, for the Common Knowledge) was the first Polish newspaper (actually, a weekly), published from 1661, first in Kraków, then in Warsaw.

Though short-lived, it gave its name to several later newspapers, notably the &quot;Merkuriusz Polski&quot; published in London, 1955–58.

==History==
&quot;Merkuryusz Polski Ordynaryiny&quot; first came out in Kraków on 3 January 1661. Sponsored by the court of King John II Casimir of Poland and his consort Queen Marie Louise Gonzaga, the newspaper was a weekly devoted chiefly to contemporary politics, European dynastic affairs, and monarchs&#x27; military campaigns. With regard to internal affairs, it promoted political reforms and the strengthening of monarchical power. Its demise was associated with the failure of the king&#x27;s political plans.

&quot;Merkuryusz&quot; was edited in a 17th-century Polish heavily influenced by Latin; some parts of issues were written purely in Latin. Initially published by the Kraków printing house of J.A. Gorczyn (issues of 3 January – 4 May 1661), in May 1661 its editorial offices moved to Warsaw, where the issues from 14 May through 22 July 1661 appeared. Altogether 41 issues came out (12 of them &quot;extraordinary,&quot; or special), with a run of 100–250 copies. The last issue was dated 22 July 1661.

&quot;Merkuryusz&quot; was edited by Hieronim Pinocci, an Italian merchant who had migrated to Poland and served in notable posts in the royal administration, including those of master of the Kraków mint and secretary to King John II Casimir. Other collaborators included Łukasz Opaliński.

Between 1933 and 1939 the complete run was reprinted by the Polish National Library.

<doc id="1266901" wikidata="Q424333" url="?curid=1266901" title="Salmeterol">
<text>Salmeterol is a long-acting β2 adrenergic receptor agonist (LABA) used in the treatment and prevention of asthma symptoms and control of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) symptoms. Symptoms of bronchospasm include shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing and chest tightness. It is also used to prevent breathing difficulties during exercise (exercise-induced bronchoconstriction).
It was patented in 1983 and came into medical use in 1990. It is marketed as Serevent in the US. It is available as a dry-powder inhaler (DPI) that releases a powdered form of the drug. It was previously available as a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) but was discontinued in the US in 2002. It is available as an MDI in other countries as of 2020.

== Mechanism of action ==
Inhaled salmeterol belongs to a group of drugs called beta-2 agonists. These drugs stimulate beta-2 receptors present in the bronchial musculature. This causes them to relax and prevent the onset and worsening of symptoms of asthma. They act on the enzyme adenyl cyclase which increases the concentration of cAMP (Cyclic adenosine monophosphate). This cyclic AMP decreases the smooth muscle tone. This drug is 10,000-times more lipid soluble than the short acting beta-2 adrenoceptor agonist, albuterol. Unlike albuterol, salmeterol becomes dissolved in the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane, and its gradual dissociation from the cell membrane provides beta-2 adrenoceptors with a supply of agonist for an extended period of time.

The primary noticeable difference of salmeterol from salbutamol, and other short-acting β2 adrenoreceptor agonists (SABAs), is its duration of action. Salmeterol lasts approximately 12 hours in comparison with salbutamol, which lasts about 4–6 hours. When used regularly every day as prescribed, inhaled salmeterol decreases the number and severity of asthma attacks. Formoterol has been demonstrated to have a faster onset of action than salmeterol as a result of a lower lipophilicity, and has also been demonstrated to be more potent—a 12 μg dose of formoterol has been demonstrated to be equivalent to a 50 μg dose of salmeterol.

==Medical uses==

* Salmeterol is used in moderate-to-severe persistent asthma following previous treatment with a short-acting β2 adrenoreceptor agonist (SABA) such as salbutamol (albuterol).
* LABAs should not be used as a monotherapy, instead, they should be used concurrently with an inhaled corticosteroid, such as beclometasone dipropionate or fluticasone propionate in the treatment of asthma to minimize serious reactions such as asthma-related deaths. Combination of inhaled corticosteroids and salmeterol (LABA) has synergistic action and reduces the frequency of asthma attacks and also makes it less severe. 
* In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), LABAs may be used as monotherapy or in combination with corticosteroids. The Torch study demonstrated benefits in terms of quality of life and lung function of salmeterol alone or in combination with inhaled corticosteroids in patients with COPD
* In exercise-induced bronchospasm monotherapy may be indicated in patients without persistent asthma. LABAs should not be used to treat acute symptoms.

===Pregnancy and lactation===
Salmeterol use during pregnancy must be decided based on the risks versus benefits to the mother. There are no well-controlled studies with salmeterol in pregnant women. Some animal studies showed developmental malformation when the mother was given several clinical doses orally. In rats, salmeterol xinafoate is excreted in the milk. However, since there is no data to show excretion of salmeterol in a mother&#x27;s breast milk, a decision on whether to continue or discontinue therapy should be decided based on the important benefits it provides to the mother. Pregnant and lactating women should consult their doctors before using salmeterol.

==Side effects==
Due to its vasodilation properties, the common side effects of salmeterol are

* dizziness, 
* sinus infection, and
* migraine headaches.

Other side effects

* muscle tremors,
* hypokalemia due to direct effect on beta-2 receptors on skeletal muscle.

In most cases, salmeterol side effects are minor and either do not require treatment or can easily be treated. Certain side effects, however, should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

Some of these more serious side effects include

* very fast heart rate,
* high blood pressure, and
* worsening breathing problems.

==Structure-activity relationship==
Salmeterol has an aryl alkyl group with a chain length of 11 atoms from the amine. This bulkiness makes the compound more lipophilic and it also makes it selective to β2 adrenergic receptors.

==History==
Salmeterol, first marketed and manufactured by Glaxo (now GlaxoSmithKline, GSK) in the 1980s, was released as Serevent in 1990. The product is marketed by GSK under the Allen &amp; Hanburys brand in the UK.

In November 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a health advisory, alerting the public to findings that show the use of long-acting β2 agonists could lead to a worsening of symptoms, and in some cases death.

While the use of inhaled LABAs are still recommended in asthma guidelines for the resulting improved symptom control, further concerns have been raised. A large meta-analysis of pooled results from 19 trials with 33,826 participants, suggests that salmeterol may increase the small risks of asthma-related deaths, and this additional risk is not reduced with the additional use of inhaled steroids (e.g., as with the combination product fluticasone/salmeterol).
This seems to occur because although LABAs relieve asthma symptoms, they also promote bronchial inflammation and sensitivity without warning.

== Society and culture ==

=== Names ===
Combinations of inhaled steroids and these long-acting bronchodilators are becoming more widespread; the most common combination currently in use is fluticasone/salmeterol (brand names Seretide (UK) and Advair (US)). Another combination is budesonide/formoterol (brand name Symbicort).

<text>The Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad (C&amp;SL) was a historic railway in Lower Canada, the first Canadian public railway and one of the first railways built in British North America.

==Origin==

The C&amp;SL was financed by Montreal entrepreneur and brewery owner, John Molson. It was intended as a portage road to connect the St. Lawrence River valley with Lake Champlain, cutting time from the trip between Montreal and New York. Construction began in January, 1835 when surveyors determined the line would run from St. John on the Richelieu River to the nearest point on the St. Lawrence at La Prairie, across the river from Montreal.

Throughout 1835 the grading, fencing, masonry and bridge work were completed, as well as stations and wharves at Laprairie and St. John. Orders were also placed for a locomotive, which was to be built in Newcastle upon Tyne, as well as four passenger cars, which were to be built in the United States. Several freight cars were also built in Montreal.

The line was built as a railway, with rails consisting of pine logs (squared off) which were joined by iron splice plates and bolts laid across wood cross-ties. The pine rails were protected by iron straps spiked to the upper surface. These rails remained the same until being replaced by completely iron rails in the 1850s.

British North America&#x27;s first locomotive arrived at Molson&#x27;s wharf in Montreal in June 1836. It was named &quot;Dorchester&quot; and had been constructed by Robert Stephenson, son of George Stephenson who was the manufacturer of &quot;The Rocket&quot;. A wood-burning 0-4-0 design, it was the 127th locomotive built by Stephenson and was nicknamed &quot;Kitten&quot; by those who observed its uneven &quot;skittish&quot; ride – a result of the short wheelbase. Trial runs took place at night to avoid frightening the public; maximum speed was approximately .

The C&amp;SL opened to great fanfare on July 21, 1836, with several distinguished guests in attendance besides Molson, including Lord Gosford, the Lieutenant-Governor of Lower Canada, as well as Louis-Joseph Papineau, the rebel politician. Over 300 guests crowded the passenger cars in Laprairie station for the first run. The &quot;Dorchester&quot; was unable to handle such a load, therefore the two first-class coaches carrying 32 of the distinguished guests were uncoupled and hauled by the locomotive while the remaining cars were hauled by teams of horses. Two hours later, everyone was at the station in St. John where the ceremonies continued.

in 1999, the Dorchester was inducted into the North America Railway Hall of Fame. Due to its unique status as the first locomotive used in Canada, it was recognized for its contribution to the railway industry as &quot;Rolling Stock&quot; in the &quot;National&quot; category.

==Growth and eventual merging==
Regular operations commenced on July 25 and while freight traffic was stagnant on the line for many years, passenger traffic and excursions proved extremely popular early on, with many extra passenger trains being hauled by horses until additional locomotives arrived in 1837. Charles Dickens even rode the line. The line was extended south along the Richelieu River valley in 1851 to Rouses Point, New York and the following year saw a more direct routing built from the St. John-Laprairie line to St. Lambert, directly opposite Montreal to avoid the indirect journey up and down the St. Lawrence River from Laprairie. This latter line effectively reduced the line into Laprairie to branch line status and it would be later abandoned.

The C&amp;SL merged with the Montreal and New York Railroad in 1857, formerly known as the Montreal and Lachine Railroad, with the new company being named the Montreal and Champlain Railroad. The Grand Trunk Railway leased the M&amp;C in 1864 and purchased it outright in 1872.

In 1923 the GTR was nationalized and the ex-M&amp;C, née-C&amp;SL trackage was incorporated into the Canadian National Railways (CNR). CN (post-1960) continues to operate the majority of this historic route, running from an interchange connection with the Delaware and Hudson Railway (now owned by Canadian Pacific Railway) at Rouses Point, New York, through Saint-Jean and on to Saint-Lambert. The line from Rouses Point to Brossard is now CN&#x27;s Rouses Point Subdivision.

==New York company==
The approximately between Rouses Point and the New York/Quebec border were owned by a separate company, also called the Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad, incorporated in New York on February 26, 1851. It was merged into the Canadian National Railway at the end of 1960.

==Culture==
C&amp;SL Railroad was immortalized by Canadian country music artist Orval Prophet on his &quot;Judgement Day Express&quot; album (1973) with the song &quot;Champlain and St. Lawrence Line&quot;

In 1986, for the World&#x27;s Fair Exhibition in Vancouver called Expo 86, the Molsons donated a functional replica of the steam engine used to ferry travellers and goods on the C&amp;SL Railway.

<text>Demogoblin is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

==Publication history==

Demogoblin first appeared as Demogoblin in &quot;Web of Spider-Man&quot; #86 (March 1992), and had previously appeared as an unnamed demon in &quot;Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; #147. 

==Fictional character biography==
Demogoblin was originally an unnamed demon who inhabited Limbo and was banished there eons ago for unknown reasons. His essence was fused with the Hobgoblin (Jason Macendale) when Jason asked N&#x27;astirh for more power in exchange for his soul. As a part of Hobgoblin, he infected Moon Knight with a demonic virus that would slowly mutate him, and fought the Ghost Rider and John Blaze, eventually being defeated by Blaze&#x27;s hellfire gun and Ghost Rider&#x27;s mystical chain. Hobgoblin quickly realized being possessed by a demon was less than beneficial, and, thanks to the effects of the hellfire and mystical chain, managed to expel his demon half, creating the Demogoblin, a darker, mystical version of the Hobgoblin persona.

Demogoblin believed himself to be on a holy mission and killed everyone whom he deemed a sinner, however, his definition of a sinner is extreme and excludes only children. He often tried to kill heroes and even holy men. He claimed that he was a member of a demonic group known as the &quot;Righteous&quot;—demons who sought redemption for their sins as self-proclaimed servants of the Lord by exterminating other demons and destroying evil wherever they found it.

Once freed from the Hobgoblin, Demogoblin fought and was defeated by Spider-Man and Macendale as the Hobgoblin. He then joined with the Spider-Man doppelganger and tried to kill the Hobgoblin, but they retreated under the sewer depths when opposed by Spider-Man, Venom, Ghost Rider, and Blaze.

Demogoblin then confronted Moon Knight, trying to possess his body, which was ravaged by Demogoblin&#x27;s bloodlink virus from the previous confrontation with the Hobgoblin. Moon Knight was saved from the virus due to the intervention of Dr. Strange and Mr. Fantastic.

During the events of &quot;Maximum Carnage&quot;, Demogoblin joined Carnage, Shriek, Carrion, and the Spider-Man doppelganger on their killing spree throughout Manhattan. He battled Spider-Man, Venom, Iron Fist, Captain America, Deathlok, Cloak and Dagger, and Firestar. He ultimately becomes repulsed by his comrades&#x27; internal feuding and decides to leave them, but he is apprehended by the collective of superheroes before he can make good on this decision.

The Demogoblin is destroyed by the vampire-hunter Blade while Blade is empowered by the Darkhold, but those who had been killed by Blade are restored to life when the Darkhold&#x27;s spell is reversed.

He is summoned to San Francisco by a horde of goblins who hold the city in their grip and intend to make Demogoblin their ruler. However, he regards the goblins as sinners of the worst sort, and so plays along with them only long enough to kill Charles Palentine, the man who had summoned the goblins to Earth, and seize from him the necklace used for the summoning. He then uses the necklace&#x27;s near godlike power to kill all the goblins and destroys the necklace itself, thus saving the city.

Demogoblin&#x27;s physical form is killed in a showdown with Hobgoblin, who has gained greater strength than before. He dies trying to save a child from collapsing debris inside a church, where he is crushed to death.

Post-mortem, the Demogoblin makes an appearance as a taunting hallucination of the heroic Green Goblin, Phil Urich, alongside hallucinations of the original Green Goblin and Hobgoblin.

Demogoblin returns in the Absolute Carnage event as &quot;Demagoblin&quot;, bound to the recently sacrificed Shriek.

==Powers and abilities==
Demogoblin is a demonic being, with numerous supernatural powers granted by magic. He is endowed with superhuman strength, stamina, agility, reflexes, and resistance to injury. He has a magical ability to mentally control and levitate his one-man miniature &quot;goblin glider&quot; composed of hellfire and propel it at high speeds. He can project hellfire from his hands. He can also summon demons from hell that will attack anyone he instructs to be destroyed.

Demogoblin is able to mystically create &quot;pumpkin bombs&quot;, similar to those of the Green Goblin or Hobgoblin. Orange pumpkin bombs are bombs that explode conventionally (albeit magical) as concussion and incendiary Jack O&#x27; Lanterns. Black pumpkin bombs cause their target to be overwhelmed by massive feelings of despair and helplessness. He also can create wraith-shaped smoke and gas-emitting bombs, and bat-shaped razor-edged throwing blades.

Apart from his physical and magical advantages, he is knowledgeable about military training and hand-to-hand combat absorbed from his time merged with the Hobgoblin. Although deranged, the Demogoblin is highly intelligent.

==Reception==
* In 2020, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Demogoblin 4th in their &quot;10 Most Powerful Comic Book Villains With Demonic Origins&quot; list.

==Other versions==
=== Ultimate Marvel ===
In Ultimate Marvel universe, Mary Jane Watson becomes the Demogoblin, after being kidnapped from her bedroom by a facially disfigured clone of Peter Parker who is determined to give her powers so that she is no longer in danger from his enemies. He pumps in her bloodstream an unquantified amount of OZ, the drug responsible for the creation of the Green Goblin, Hobgoblin and also Spider-Man. Upon learning this, she becomes very angry and transforms into a huge, hairy, horned red goblin-type creature.

However, when the real Peter Parker and Spider-Woman show up, she calms down and resumes her original form, just in time for Peter (her ex) to render his evil clone unconscious. MJ is taken to the Fantastic Four&#x27;s Baxter Building and when she wakes up, she is afraid and angry, causing another transformation, but when she spots the Peter clone who was in the building, she calms down once again and reverts to her normal self. She is then given what is believed to be a cure to the effects of the OZ formula, yet the ordeal has left her badly traumatized, and she is shown to be affected by panic issues and haunted by the scarred visage of Peter&#x27;s disfigured clone.

When MJ later gets angry as she watches Peter talking to Kitty, his ex-girlfriend, her hand starts to tremble and her fingernails briefly become claws but she calms down when Kitty takes off in anger, indicating that her cure might not be permanent or even complete. Mary Jane also daydreams a scene where she&#x27;s fighting against Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four in her mutant form, defeating them one by one.

=== Spider-Geddon ===
In the &quot;Spider-Geddon&quot; event, in &quot;Vault of Spiders&quot; #2, on Earth-11580, a version of Demogoblin is seen alongside Green Goblin, Hobgoblin and Jack O&#x27;Lantern during the Goblin Night. Under the orders of the Goblin Queen, they try to kill Gwen Stacy, but Spiders-Man arrives and defeats the Goblins.

<doc id="1266918" wikidata="Q2367261" url="?curid=1266918" title="AFDL">
<text>The Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (), also known by the French acronym AFDL, was a coalition of Rwandan, Ugandan, Burundian, and Congolese dissidents, disgruntled minority groups, and nations that toppled Mobutu Sese Seko and brought Laurent-Désiré Kabila to power in the First Congo War. Although the group was successful in overthrowing Mobutu, the alliance fell apart after Kabila did not agree to be dictated by his foreign backers, Rwanda and Uganda, which marked the beginning of the Second Congo War in 1998.

==Background==

By the middle of 1996, the situation in eastern Zaire was simmering with tension. Following the Rwandan genocide in 1994, hundreds of thousands of ethnic Hutus had fled across the border into Zaire where they settled in large refugee camps. Many of those responsible for the genocide, the former Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR) and &quot;interahamwe&quot; militia, used the anonymity offered by the camps to reorganize into the rebel Rassemblement pour le Retour et la Démocratie au Rwanda (RDR). The RDR began to use the camps as bases to infiltrate back across the border and conduct an insurgency. Despite protests by the new government of Rwanda, the Zairian government and international organizations providing humanitarian aid to the camps were unwilling to remove the militants from the refugee population.

At the same time, the position of the Banyamulenge minority, ethnic Tutsis who had lived in Zaire for generations, was growing precarious. They had long been discriminated against for being relative newcomers to the region and having a different language and culture than neighboring tribes, part of Mobutu Sese Seko&#x27;s strategy of encouraging a low level of internal discord in the country so an alliance would not form against him. The arrival of large numbers of Hutus, many of them militant Hutus who carried out attacks on Banyamulenge targets, had substantially upset what equilibrium existed. The Rwandan government also saw the Banyamulenge as natural allies and had quietly armed and trained a substantial force in anticipation of what it felt to be an unstable situation.

== Formation of the AFDL ==
On 7 October 1996, the vice-governor based in the Kivu town of Bukavu proclaimed that the Banyamulenge were no longer welcome and would have to leave the country. In response, the Banyamulenge began an uprising against the local government, which was used as a pretext by the AFDL to start a war in Zaire, which was initially characterized as a tribal war quickly turned into something more. With support from the Rwandan government, the Banyamulenge managed to fend off an attack by the Zairian Armed Forces. The rising tension between Rwanda and Zaire then led to an exchange of mortar fire over Lake Kivu between the two nations&#x27; armed forces. This violence involving the Banyamulenge in September–October 1996 is seen as the beginning of the First Congo War.

Seemingly out of nowhere, Laurent-Désiré Kabila, a former Marxist rebel who had spent most of the previous decade selling gold in Tanzania, appeared as head of his old rebel group, the Party of the Peoples&#x27; Revolution, which had been defunct. In a remarkably short period of time, Kabila found himself head of the new AFDL, which also included the National Council of Resistance for Democracy (CNRD) led by André Kisase Ngandu, the Revolutionary Movement for the Liberation of Zaire (MRLZ) led by , and the Democratic Alliance of the People (ADP) led by , often known as &quot;Douglas&quot;. On October 18, Bugera became the first general secretary of the organization.

There has been much speculation about foreign involvement in facilitating the creation of the AFDL. Most of it swirls around Rwandan President Paul Kagame and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, both of whom knew Kabila very well. (Kabila had been introduced to Kagame and Museveni by Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, president of Tanzania). After an initial period of denial, since 1997 both Rwanda and Uganda have openly acknowledged the role they played in the formation of the AFDL and its military success. Rwanda and Uganda quickly threw the weight of their support behind the AFDL and sent forces across the Zairian border. Burundi, Angola, the rebels of southern Sudan, and the security forces of the province of Katanga, all of which had long-standing grievances with the Mobutu government, especially his sponsoring of foreign rebel groups to destabilize neighboring countries, also proved to be important backers of the AFDL.

== The course of the war ==

One of the first actions of the AFDL after it began to capture towns along the Zairian border was the dispersal of the large Hutu refugee camps that were offering safe haven to many RDR militants, an act humanitarian and human rights organizations fiercely criticized. As each camp was destroyed, the refugees fled to the next, creating camps with massive populations. One camp at Mugungu, north of Lake Kivu, reached 500,000 inhabitants, which was completely unmanageable by humanitarian organizations. However, in fierce fighting in mid-November the Zairian government forces and RDR were either destroyed or forced out of the provinces of North and South Kivu. The Hutu refugees then split, about 800,000 fleeing back into Rwanda and several hundred thousand moving west into the Zairian jungles where many died of starvation and exposure to the elements or fell victim to attacks by various armed parties. The Rwandan Defence Forces and the AFDL carried out mass atrocities during the war, with tens of thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees going missing.

While Kabila, due to his international contacts and ability to speak multiple languages, was clearly the AFDL spokesperson, there was some question about who was the ultimate leader. André Kisase Ngandu, an elder insurgent with revolutionary credentials, was the president of the AFDL&#x27;s military wing, the National Resistance Council (CNRD), and apparently expressed opposition to the massacre of Hutu refugees in Congolese camps. This internal tension between the two men was resolved on 4 January 1997, when Ngandu was assassinated in North Kivu by Rwandan Tutsi soldiers, allegedly at the instigation of Kabila and/or Rwandan President Paul Kagame. Kabila thereafter appointed himself president of the CNRD as well as retaining his position as spokesperson and head of the political wing.

Once the Kivus were secured, the remainder of the First Congo War consisted for the most part of the AFDL and its allies walking and driving across Zaire to the capital, Kinshasa. The population proved to have a deep antipathy towards Mobutu Sese Seko after decades of corruption and despotism. Most of the demoralized soldiers in the national army either joined the AFDL or deserted. Men from villages and towns throughout Zaire spontaneously joined the AFDL&#x27;s advance. The AFDL was only slowed down by the country&#x27;s decrepit infrastructure. In several parts of the country, no paved roads existed; the only links to the outside world were irregularly used dirt paths.

On 16 May 1997, after seven months of rebellion and the failure of peace talks, Mobutu fled the country. The AFDL marched into Kinshasa a day later. Kabila declared himself president and renamed the country to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The AFDL then became the new national armed forces.

<text>Carl Austin Weiss Sr. (December 6, 1906 – September 8, 1935) was an American physician who assassinated U.S. Senator Huey Long at the Louisiana State Capitol on September 8, 1935.

==Career==
Weiss was born in Baton Rouge to physician Carl Adam Weiss and the former Viola Maine. Weiss&#x27;s father was a prominent ophthalmologist who had once treated Senator Long. His father was of German-Jewish descent. His paternal grandfather was an organist and choirmaster in Bavaria before he emigrated to Louisiana in 1870. His mother had French and Irish ancestry. Both of Weiss&#x27; parents were Roman Catholic, although he may have had some Jewish ancestry through his paternal grandfather. However, despite the conspiracy theories promoted by the antisemitic preacher and Huey Long ally, Gerald L. K. Smith, after Long&#x27;s death, there is no evidence that his family remained religiously Jewish. Weiss was educated in local schools and graduated from St. Vincent&#x27;s Academy, a Catholic school. 

Growing up, Weiss had an interest in electricity and mechanics. He once tampered with the lock at the pew of his downtown church, locking his mother and two aunts inside. Initially, he studied engineering at University, his father having discouraged a career as a doctor due to its time commitments; he often went to the early 5:15 a.m. mass in case of a later medical emergency. However, after two years, Weiss switched to studying medicine, obtaining his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1925 from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. He did postgraduate work in Vienna, Austria, and briefly practiced at the American Hospital of Paris.

Weiss thereafter was awarded internships in Vienna and at Bellevue Hospital in New York City. It was while in Europe that Weiss bought a FN Model 1910 pistol for $25 (equivalent to approximately $ in ) that he allegedly used in the Long assassination.

In 1932, he returned to Baton Rouge to enter private practice with his father. He was president of the Louisiana Medical Society in 1933 and a member of the Kiwanis International.

==Murder of Huey Long==

On September 8, 1935, Carl Weiss confronted and shot Huey Long in the Capitol building in Baton Rouge. At 9:20 p.m., just after passage of a bill reconfiguring the district of Weiss&#x27;s father-in-law, Judge Benjamin Henry Pavy, to deny him reelection, Weiss approached Long. According to the generally accepted version of events, Weiss fired a single shot with a handgun from four feet (1.2 m) away. Long was struck in the torso. Long&#x27;s bodyguards, nicknamed the &quot;Cossacks&quot; or &quot;skullcrushers&quot;, responded by firing at Weiss with their own pistols, killing him; an autopsy found that Weiss had been shot more than 60 times by Long&#x27;s bodyguards.

==Alternative theories and denials of the assassination==

As both Long and Weiss died before a trial could be held, the claim that Weiss was Long&#x27;s assassin was never proven in court. Additionally, no autopsy was ever performed on Long. In the years since the event, theories have arisen that Weiss did not actually murder Senator Long; with some speculating that Long was, in fact, killed by a stray bullet fired from the gun of one of his bodyguards.

===Family denials===
At the time, Weiss&#x27;s wife and their families did not accept his guilt. Indeed, Weiss&#x27;s parents indicated that he had seemed quite happy earlier on the day that Long was killed. Many people close to the family, as well as politicians of the time, doubted the official version of the shooting.

Weiss&#x27;s son, Carl Jr., an infant at the time of his father&#x27;s death, had since vigorously disputed the assertion that his father killed Long. In a 1993 interview on the NBC program &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot;, he asserted that Long was accidentally shot by one of his own bodyguards. Donald Pavy, a medical doctor and first cousin of Weiss&#x27;s wife Yvonne Pavy, conducted a scientific study of the case and concluded in his book &quot;Accident and Deception: The Huey Long Shooting&quot; that Weiss did not shoot the governor-turned-senator.

However, this view is not accepted by Louisiana State University Professor T. Harry Williams, who writes in his 1969 Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Long:
Williams then goes on to say that: 
==Exhumation==
With the approval of the family, the remains of Weiss were exhumed in 1991 and examined by James Starrs, a forensic scientist at George Washington University. Starrs was also the publisher of the Scientific Sleuthing Review.

==Portrayal in literature==
The character of Adam Stanton in Robert Penn Warren&#x27;s fictitious &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; is partially based on Weiss.

In her 1993 memoir, Marguerite Young mentions the murder of Huey Long and how she used to dance with Weiss as a college girl at Louisiana State University.

==Dubious connection to Ernest Hemingway==
Nobel laureate Ernest Hemingway suffered a severe gash to his forehead when a skylight fell on him in March 1928 in his Paris apartment. He was treated at the American Hospital of Paris, and it took nine stitches to suture his head wound. He was left with a permanent, prominent scar on his forehead.

Later in life, Hemingway claimed that the physician who treated him was Carl Weiss. However, Hemingway was almost certainly mistaken, as Weiss did not start practicing at the hospital until July 1929, sixteen months after Hemingway was treated for his head wound.

<text>Angle Lake is an L-shaped lake in SeaTac, Washington, United States, occupying between Interstate 5 and State Route 99. The lake most likely was so named on account of its outline, which forms a right angle. Like nearby Lake Burien and Bow Lake, it was formed by the glacial retreat roughly 12,000 years ago.

On the western shore is a park, Angle Lake Park, administered by the City of SeaTac Parks and Recreation department. The remainder of the shoreline is ringed with private homes. The Angle Lake light rail station is named for the lake, and is located to the southwest.

The lake is stocked with rainbow trout by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. It is also home to kokanee, largemouth bass, crappie, catfish, and yellow perch. The lake is open to fishing year-round.

Angle Lake was home to an annual fireworks show and hydroplane races on Independence Day until 2024, when both were replaced by a drone show due to a complaint filed by a resident, who cited a 1932 Washington Supreme Court ruling. During the first drone show, 55 of the 200 drones lost their GPS signals and descended into the lake, rendering them unusable.

==Park==
Angle Lake Park was established in the 1920s as the private Angle Lake Plunge resort. The Park was acquired by King County in 1957 becoming the public Angle Lake Park. After the City was formed the County transferred the ownership of Angle Lake Park to the City of SeaTac.&lt;https://www.historylink.org/file/4181&gt; The entrance to the park is off International Boulevard (State Route 99), from Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. It includes of the lake shore, with a swimming area, fishing pier, picnic areas and public boat launch.

<text>dB drag racing is a competition rewarding the person who can produce the loudest sound inside a vehicle. The &quot;dB&quot; means decibels of sound pressure level (SPL). In these competitions, SPL of over 140 decibels is common; and the international record in 2003 was 171.5 dB, with records as high as 180 dB claimed more recently.

Competitive vehicles can range from a small vehicle with a single amplifier and subwoofer up to a large van with dozens of amplifiers and subwoofers powered by dozens of car batteries and with upgraded electrical wiring and alternators. 

There were 10,000 competitors in 2003 and 300 &quot;races&quot;. U.S. National Championships were held in Tennessee.

During a competition, the vehicle must be driven . Nobody is allowed to sit in the vehicle during trials because injury would be certain. The vehicles are sealed tight to maximize containment of the sound energy for the decibel level meter. The competitor stands away from the vehicle with an on/off switch control while a computer voice announces the stages for the &quot;races&quot;. The test tone consists of a very short resonating tone between 30 Hz and 70 Hz, called &quot;the burp&quot;.

<text>The Cremlingen transmitter is a large mediumwave transmission facility established in 1962 for transmitting the programme of Deutschlandfunk on 756 kHz near Cremlingen-Abbenrode. It was also known as &quot;Sender Braunschweig&quot; or &quot;Sender Königslutter&quot;.

The first transmitter was installed in 1962. It transmitted the program of Deutschlandfunk on 755 kHz (756 kHz from 1978 on) at a power of 100 kW and used as its aerial a 137-metre-high guyed steel framework mast. The transmitter power was raised to 200 kW one year later, but it only operated during daytime for some time. Interferences with the Ravensburg mediumwave transmitter which worked on the same frequency were common.

A second transmitter was installed for the transmission of the Deutschlandfunk programme on 548 kHz from 28 October 1963, initially with a power of 200 kW. It used a 240-metre-high guyed steel tube mast as its aerial, which was insulated against the ground, A second, insulated guyed steel framework mast was installed to shape the radiation pattern with a minimum towards the southeast, in order to avoid interferences with Radio Mayak in the Soviet Union.

On 1 October 1967 the transmission power on 548 kHz was raised to 800 kW (400 kW during nighttime), sufficient to reach all of the northern Federal Republic of Germany and most of the territory of the GDR.

According to the Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975 which came into effect in November 1978, transmissions on 548 kHz ceased in favour of Thurnau transmitter which started to transmit at this time on 549 kHz with 200 kW, and Nordkirchen transmitter on the same frequency with 100 kW. Both transmitters at Cremlingen were converted to combined operation at 756 kHz with a maximum daytime power of 800 kilowatts, and 200 kilowatts with a radiation minimum towards the southeast during the night. The height of the steel tube mast was reduced from 240 metres to 199 metres to optimize it for 756 kHz. Likewise, the steel framework mast used to for directional purposes was shortened to 99 m. The height of the 137-metre mast was not changed, it was used after 1978 as a backup aerial.

The 800 kW vacuum tube transmitters have been dismantled, and since the middle of the 1990s the transmitter power has been 200 kW all day, provided by two 100 kW transmitters. In 2005, a fully transistorised and DRM capable 800 kW transmitter station was installed.

From 2001 to 2003 the program of the pop music radio MEGARADIO was transmitted using the backup station on 630 kHz and the 137-metre-high radio mast as the aerial. This was made possible after this frequency, which had been used from 1978 until the mid-1990s for transmissions of SFB and NDR on 630 kHz from the Dannenberg transmitter in the daytime, had been re-coordinated for 24-hour transmission from the Cremlingen transmitter.

From 1 April 2005 until 2 January 2013, the program of Voice of Russia was transmitted from Cremlingen on 630 kHz. Switch-off was planned for 31 December 2012, but a technical fault caused transmissions to continue until 2 January 2013.

The last programme to be transmitted from this station was that of Deutschlandradio. Transmissions ceased on 31 December 2015. All masts have been demolished.

<doc id="1266951" wikidata="Q866278" url="?curid=1266951" title="Biscúter">
<text>Biscúter (Spanish spelling for the pronunciation of BiScooter) is a microcar manufactured in Spain, by Auto Nacional, SA, from 1953 until 1960, total of all versions around 10,000 units.
==Background==
Raw material shortages and general economic difficulties in Europe following the Second World War made very small, economical cars popular in many countries. In Spain, following the Spanish Civil War and the embargo declared by the United Nations against General Francisco Franco&#x27;s dictatorship, the situation was even worse. The combination of relative underdevelopment, war devastation and an international trade embargo meant that the country operated at a much lower economic level than the rest of Western Europe for nearly two decades and was forced to develop domestic substitutes for hard-to-get imported products and technologies. The Biscúter, tiny, simple, and cheap even by microcar standards, was a product of this economic environment and was well suited to its time and market.

==Origins==

The car had its origins in France in the late 1940s, where aircraft and car designer and manufacturer Gabriel Voisin had designed a minimal car called the Biscooter for Avions Voisin. The playful name implied that it was about the size of two motorscooters, or a scooter with four wheels. The design drew no interest from either manufacturers or consumers there, however, and he eventually licensed it to Spanish firm Autonacional S.A. of Barcelona. By the time it was introduced in 1953, the marque had been hispanicized to Biscúter. The first car had no formal model name and was called simply the Series 100, but it soon became known as the &quot;Zapatilla&quot;, or little shoe (clog), after a low-heeled peasant slipper popular at the time.

==Technical information==

The Zapatilla was minimal indeed, with no doors or windows or reverse gear. The 1 cylinder, 197 cc, two-stroke motor produced 9 horsepower (7 kW), had a crank starter, and drove only the right front wheel. It had a large, oil-filled cylinder head, to compensate overheating during traffic light arrests, and avoid overcooling while on road at higher speeds, producing a: &#x27;Temperature Buffer&#x27; effect. Braking was by an unusual three-point system involving the transmission and cable ties to the two rear wheels. One genuinely advanced feature was an all-aluminum body, although steel was later used.

==History==

Biscúter flourished for about ten years and the cars became a common sight on Spanish roads, as well as a part of popular culture. (&quot;Ugly as a Biscúter&quot; was a common joke.) Amenities such as doors and windows did eventually appear, and several different bodystyles were produced, including trucks, an elegant woodie station wagon, and a toy-like sports car called the Pegasín (little Pegaso).

In 1950 the Spanish auto maker SEAT was set up as the country&#x27;s national car manufacturer, but at first even the most inexpensive of its designs were considered luxury cars, out of reach of the average Spanish consumer. As time went on and a greater degree of prosperity developed, though, SEATs began to take more of the market and crowd out the cheaper marques. In 1957 the company attempted to produce a sports car, the Biscuter Pegasin in an attempt to attract the wealthier buyers. The styling was similar to the Pegaso Z-102, but it didn&#x27;t help much. By the early 60s, Biscúter sales and production stopped, after a total production run of about 12,000. It is thought that almost all of the cars were eventually scrapped.

==Today==
Now Biscúters are mostly museum curiosities, although like many vanished marques they have some following among auto enthusiasts. The name is little known outside Spain, however, and most materials pertaining to it are in Spanish.

<doc id="1266958" wikidata="Q831297" url="?curid=1266958" title="Pool of Bethesda">
<text>The Pool of Bethesda is referred to in John&#x27;s Gospel in the Christian New Testament, (John 5:2) in an account of Jesus healing a paralyzed man at a pool of water in Jerusalem, described as being near the Sheep Gate and surrounded by five covered colonnades or porticoes. It is also referred to as Bethzatha. It is now associated with the site of a pool in the current Muslim Quarter of the city, near the gate now called the Lions&#x27; Gate or St. Stephen&#x27;s Gate and the Church of St. Anne, which was excavated in the late 19th century.

==Name==
The name of the pool is said to be derived from the Hebrew and/or Aramaic language. &quot;Beth hesda&quot; (בית חסד/חסדא), means either &quot;house of mercy&quot; or &quot;house of grace&quot;. This meaning may have been thought appropriate, since the location was seen as a place of disgrace due to the presence of invalids, and as a place of grace due to the granting of healing.

Alternative renderings to the name Βηθεσδά (Bethesda), appearing in manuscripts of the Gospel of John, include Βηθζαθά (&quot;Beth-zatha&quot; = בית חדתא), a derivative of Bezetha, and &quot;Bethsaida&quot; (not to be confused with Bethsaida, a town in Galilee), although the latter is considered to be a metathetical corruption by Biblical scholars.

Franz Delitzsch suggested that the name comes from a mishnaic Hebrew loanword from Greek, &quot;estiv/estava&quot;, that appropriately referred to stoa (στοά).

==Identification of the biblical site==
According to the Gospel of John, Bethesda was a bathing pool (, &quot;kolumbethra&quot;) with five porticoes (translated as &quot;porches&quot; by older English Bible translations).

Until the 19th century, there was no clear archaeological evidence for the existence of such a pool. The Pool of Bethesda was sometimes identified by commentators with the modern so-called Fountain of the Virgin, in the Kidron Valley, not far from the Pool of Siloam, or alternatively with the &quot;Birket Isrâ&#x27;il&quot;, a pool near the mouth of the valley, which runs into the Kidron south of St. Stephen&#x27;s Gate. Others identified it with the twin pools then called the &quot;Souterrains&quot; (French for &quot;subterranean&quot;), under the Convent of the Sisters of Zion; subsequent archaeological investigation has identified these with the later Struthion Pool.

However, as early as the fifth century, there was a Byzantine church in what became the precincts of the Church of St. Anne, called the Church of the Probatike (the Church at the Probatic Pool, or the Pool of the Sheep) or the Church of the Lame Man. This site, as subsequently excavated by archaeologists, seems plausibly to fit the description in John&#x27;s Gospel.

===Archaeology===
In archaeological digs conducted in the 19th century, Conrad Schick discovered a large tank situated about north-west of St. Anne&#x27;s Church, which he contended was the Pool of Bethesda. Further archaeological excavation in the area, in 1964, uncovered the remains of the Byzantine and Crusader churches, Hadrian&#x27;s Temple of Asclepius and Serapis, the small healing pools of an Asclepeion, the second of the two large pools, and the dam between them. It was discovered that the Byzantine church had been built in the very heart of Hadrian&#x27;s temple and contained the healing pools.

===Gospel account===

The Johannine text (chapter 5) describes the porticoes as being a place in which large numbers of infirm people were waiting, which could correspond with the site&#x27;s possible use in the 1st century AD as an Asclepeion. The biblical narrative continues by describing a Shabbat visit to the site by Jesus, during which he heals a man who has been bedridden for 38 years and could not make his own way into the pool. The healing, and Jesus&#x27; instruction to the man to take up his mat, prompts a protest that the religious customs of the Sabbath have been broken.

==History==
===First (northern) pool===
The history of the pool began in the 8th century BC, when a dam was built across the short Beth Zeta Valley, turning it into a reservoir for rain water; a sluice-gate in the dam allowed the height to be controlled, and a rock-cut channel brought a steady stream of water from the reservoir into the city. The reservoir became known as the &quot;Upper Pool&quot; (&quot;בריכה העליונה&quot;).

===Second (southern) pool===
Around 200 BC, during the period in which Simon II was the Jewish High Priest, the channel was enclosed, and a second pool was added on the south side of the dam.

Although popular legend argues that this pool was used for washing sheep, this is very unlikely due to the pool&#x27;s use as a water supply, and its extreme depth (13m). There has been some scholarly debate about whether the pool may have been a &quot;mikveh&quot; (Jewish ritual bathing pool).

===Hellenistic and Roman temples===
According to Jerome Murphy-O&#x27;Connor in the 1st century BC natural caves to the east of the two pools were turned into small baths with a religious/medical function. The Mishnah implies that at least one of these new pools was sacred to Fortuna, the goddess of fortune, rather than Asclepius, the god of healing. Murphy-O&#x27;Connor thinks it likely that this development was founded by the Roman garrison of the nearby Antonia Fortress, who would also have been able to protect it from attack. Additionally, the location of the baths outside the then city walls would have made its presence tolerable to the Jews, who might otherwise have objected to a non-Jewish religious presence in their holy city.

In the mid 1st century AD, Herod Agrippa expanded the city walls, bringing the baths into the city. When Hadrian rebuilt Jerusalem as Aelia Capitolina, he placed a roadway along the dam, and expanded the site into a large temple to Asclepius and Serapis.

===Byzantine church===
By the fifth century, at least part of the asclepieion had been converted into, or replaced by, a Byzantine church, known as the Church of the Probatike (literally, the Church of the Sheep, the pool being called the Probatic or Sheep Pool) and initially dedicated to the Healing of the Paralytic, though from the sixth century associated with the Virgin Mary (the German pilgrim Theodosius wrote in &quot;De Situ Terrae Sanctae&quot; (c. 530) that &quot;next to the Sheep-pool is the church of my Lady Mary&quot;). This reflects a more general movement which appropriated the healing sites of pagan religion and rededicated them to the Virgin Mary. The theory that this church was built by the Empress Eudocia (present in Jerusalem in 438–439 and 443–460) is uncertain. It seems more likely to be associated with Juvenal, bishop of Jerusalem in the mid 5th century. This church was destroyed in 614 by the Persians.

===Crusader churches===
After the Crusader conquest of Jerusalem in 1099, a much smaller church was built among the Byzantine-period ruins on the stone dyke separating the two pools, known as the Church of the Paralytic or the Moustier (&#x27;the Monastery&#x27;). It was followed by a larger new church erected nearby. This larger church, completed in 1138, was built over the site of a grotto which had (from the fifth or sixth century onwards) been traditionally believed to be the birthplace of Mary, mother of Jesus and was named for Mary&#x27;s mother, Saint Anne. After the conquest of Jerusalem by Saladin in 1187, it was transformed into a Shafi`i fiqh (Islamic law school). Gradually the buildings fell into ruin, becoming a midden (waste dump).

===Modern times===
In 1856, the area including the Church of St. Anne and the pool site was presented by the Ottoman Sultan Abdülmecid I to Napoleon III of France. The French renovated and rededicated the church (under the administration of the White Fathers), at the southeast corner of the pools, leaving the other ruins untouched. There is a tale that the site was originally offered to Queen Victoria as part of the negotiations which led ultimately to the Cyprus Convention of 1878.

<doc id="1266959" wikidata="Q6754342" url="?curid=1266959" title="Maquoketa Caves State Park">
<text>Maquoketa Caves State Park is a state park of Iowa, United States, located in Jackson County. It stands northwest of the city of Maquoketa. In 1991 on the east side of the park were listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Description==
The park contains more caves than any other state park in Iowa. A trail system links the caves, formations, and overlooks while providing a scenic hiking experience. Many areas on these trails have seen new construction, making the journey to the caves safer. Most of the caves may be entered by persons of average physical ability, but some are more advanced. However the park&#x27;s caves were closed to humans between 2010 and April 2012 in the hopes of protecting the resident bats from white nose syndrome. 

The park is in the Driftless Area of Iowa. This region escaped being glaciated in the last ice age, while regions to the east and west were not spared. The park has been subjected to hundreds of thousands of years of natural non-glacial erosion. 

The park&#x27;s caves, limestone formations and rugged bluffs represent a step back in geological time of thousands of years. Stalactites once hung from the ceilings and stalagmites rose from the floor. Souvenir hunters have robbed the caves of this rare beauty, but many formations remain. The park&#x27;s limestone caves, arches and chimneys including Dancehall Cave, Hernado&#x27;s Hideaway, Shinbone Cave, Wye Cave, and an unmarked cave within the Dancehall Cavern locally known as Steelgate Cave.

Today a modern interpretive center outside the park entrance provides maps and other informational materials. Inside the park, a central map kiosk includes charts of some of the more interesting caves. 

== History ==
Artifacts such as pottery, as well as tools and projectile points made of stone have been found in the caves and surrounding area. These discoveries indicate that the Maquoketa Caves area has been of interest to humans for hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years. Early recorded history tells that the Native Americans in the area were likely visitors to the Raccoon Creek valleys. The first Euro-American explorers first visited the caves as late as the mid-1830s. The area was originally known as Morehead Caves or Burt&#x27;s Cave. It had become a popular place for exploration, picnics, parties, and dances by the 1860s. A dance floor was constructed north of Natural Bridge in 1868, and a pavilion, which was used until the 1920s, was built sometime later. By the turn of the 20th century the area had become seriously degraded, and its popularity declined.

The first park land was purchased in 1921 by the Maquoketa Women&#x27;s Club for the purposes of establishing a state park. Originally called Morehead Caves State Park, its name was changed to Maquoketa Caves in 1928. Additional land was acquired in 1931. The majority of the park facilities were constructed from 1932 to 1939 by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Both programs resulted from the federal government effort to make work for Americans during the Great Depression. Their work makes up the contributing properties of the historic district. They include three CCC overlook shelters, the entrance portals, the custodian&#x27;s residence, the shelterhouse/concession building, the stone picnic circle, and two stone latrines. The noncontributing structures in the park include the CCC/WPA cave improvements, the CCC/WPA trail system, the park ranger&#x27;s residence, a picnic shelter, and two wood-frame latrines. State Landscape Architect John Fitzsimmons designed the custodian&#x27;s residence. It and the other historic structures designed by the Central Design Office in Ames, Iowa were built in the Rustic style, which was promulgated by the National Park Service in the 1930s as being appropriate for parks.

The State of Iowa purchased an additional on the west side of the park between 1961 and 1981. This section was dedicated as a nature preserve.

== In popular culture ==

The park was once featured on an episode of &quot;Rescue 911&quot; when a story was done on a hiker who had fallen and was seriously injured while at the park. The hiker was saved by paramedics and the Maquoketa volunteer fire department.

== Familicide ==
In the early morning of July 22, 2022, an assailant killed three members of a family at the campground. The assailant, identified as 23-year-old Anthony Sherwin of Nebraska, later committed suicide.

<doc id="1266965" wikidata="Q81014" url="?curid=1266965" title="Arctic grayling">
<text>The Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) is a species of freshwater fish in the salmon family Salmonidae. &quot;T. arcticus&quot; is widespread throughout the Arctic and Pacific drainages in Canada, Alaska, and Siberia, as well as the upper Missouri River drainage in Montana. In the U.S. state of Arizona, an introduced population is found in the Lee Valley and other lakes in the White Mountains. They were also stocked at Toppings Lake by the Teton Range and in lakes in the high Uinta Mountains in Utah, as well as alpine lakes of the Boulder Mountains (Idaho) in central Idaho.

==Taxonomy==
The scientific name of the Arctic grayling is &quot;Thymallus arcticus&quot;. It was named in 1776 by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas from specimens collected in Russia. The name of the genus &quot;Thymallus&quot; first given to grayling (&quot;T. thymallus&quot;) described in the 1758 edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus originates from the
faint smell of the herb thyme, which emanates from the flesh.

==Description==
Arctic grayling grow to a maximum recorded length of and a maximum recorded weight of . Of typical thymalline appearance, the Arctic grayling is distinguished from the similar European grayling (&quot;T. thymallus&quot;) by the absence of dorsal and anal spines and by the presence of a larger number of soft rays in these fins. There is a dark midlateral band between the pectoral and pelvic fins, and the flanks may possess a pink iridescence. &quot;T. a. arcticus&quot; has been recorded as reaching an age of 18 years.

==Range==

Arctic grayling are widespread in Arctic Ocean drainages from Hudson Bay, Canada to Alaska and in Arctic and Pacific drainages to central Alberta and British Columbia in Canada. They do not occur naturally in the Fraser and Columbia river basins. There are remnant native populations of fluvial Arctic grayling in the upper Missouri River drainage in the Big Hole River and Red Rock basin (&quot;Montana Arctic grayling&quot;). Fluvial Arctic grayling have been reestablished in the upper Ruby River, a tributary of the Beaverhead River. The native range formerly extended south into the Great Lakes basin in Michigan, where the species was extirpated by 1936 due to habitat destruction, unregulated logging, and competition from non-native fish species.

The arctic grayling occurs naturally in the Arctic Ocean basin in Siberia from the Ob to Yenisei drainages and in European Russia in some tributaries of Pechora river. Lake dwelling forms of Arctic grayling have been introduced in suitable lake habitats throughout the Rocky Mountains including lakes in the Teton Range in Wyoming, central Idaho and the high Uinta Mountains in Utah, Cascade Mountains and Sierra Nevada Mountains as far south as Arizona.

==Life cycle==
Several life history forms of Arctic grayling occur: fluvial populations that live and spawn in rivers; lacustrine populations that live and spawn in lakes; and potamodromous populations that live in lakes and spawn in tributary streams.

The Arctic grayling occurs primarily in cold waters of mid-sized to large rivers and lakes, returning to rocky streams to breed. The various subspecies are omnivorous. Crustaceans, insects and insect larvae, and fish eggs form the most important food items. Larger specimens of &quot;T. arcticus&quot; become piscivorous and the immature fish feed on zooplankton and insect larvae.

Spawning takes place in the spring. Adult fish seek shallow areas of rivers with fine, sand substrate and moderate current. Males are territorial and court females by flashing their colourful dorsal fins; the fins are also used to brace receptive females during the vibratory release of milt and roe. The fish are nonguarders: the eggs are left to mix with the substrate. Although the Arctic grayling does not excavate a nest, the highly energetic courtship and mating tends to kick up fine material which covers the zygotes. The zygote is small (approximately in diameter) and the embryo will hatch after two to three weeks. The newly hatched embryo remains in the substrate until all the yolk has been absorbed. They emerge at a length of around , at which time they form shoals at the river margins. The juveniles grow quickly during their first two years of life.

==Conservation==
Arctic grayling are considered a secure species throughout their range. Although some populations at the southern extent of its native range have been extirpated, it remains widespread elsewhere and is not listed on the IUCN Red List of threatened species.

The fluvial population in the upper Missouri river basin once merited a high priority for listing under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) by the US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service (FWS). This unique southernmost population is now extirpated from all areas of the basin with the exception of the Big Hole River watershed. In preparation for an ESA listing, the US FWS began implementing a &quot;Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances&quot; (CCAA). This agreement protects cooperating landowners from being prosecuted under the ESA &quot;takings&quot; clause so long as they fulfill specific obligations, spelled out in a contractual arrangement and intended to restore the dwindling population. Finally, in 2014 the FWS determined not to list the grayling under ESA, due to the effectiveness of the CCAA.

In 2025, efforts to reintroduce Arctic grayling to Michigan streams began, with 400,000 eggs planted in coldwater streams as part of a collaborative restoration initiative.

The Arctic grayling is economically important; it is a &quot;key subsistence species&quot; for the Iñupiat people of the Alaska North Slope, it is raised commercially for food and it is one of the most important species for Sport fishing in Alaska.

<text>Thesis () is a 1996 Spanish horror-thriller film. It is the feature debut of director Alejandro Amenábar and was written by Amenábar and Mateo Gil. It stars Ana Torrent, Fele Martínez and Eduardo Noriega. The film won seven Goya Awards, including Best Film, Best Original Screenplay and Best Director.

== Plot ==
In November 1995, Ángela, a university student in Madrid, is planning to write a thesis on audiovisual violence and the family. Her commuter train is evacuated after a man commits suicide by jumping in front of the train. While being led out of the station, Ángela moves toward the tracks in an attempt to see the man&#x27;s remains. At her school, Ángela asks her thesis director, Professor Figueroa, to help her find the most violent films in the school&#x27;s library, and seeks out a fellow student, Chema, who is known for collecting violent and pornographic videos. While Ángela watches a violent film with Chema, Figueroa finds a tape hidden in the school&#x27;s audiovisual archives. The next day, Ángela finds Figueroa dead of an apparent asthma attack in the screening room and retrieves the tape. A younger professor, Castro, takes over the supervision of Ángela&#x27;s thesis project. At Chema&#x27;s house, Ángela discovers the stolen tape is a snuff film in which a woman is tortured, killed, and disemboweled. Chema recognizes the victim is a student from their university named Vanessa, who went missing two years previously. He is able to determine that the killer used a specific model of Sony camera with a digital zoom feature, and that the film was shot in someone&#x27;s garage.

At the library, Ángela sees a handsome young man named Bosco using the type of camera Chema identified. When she leaves, he pursues and catches up to her. Bosco notices that Ángela has newspaper clippings about Vanessa&#x27;s disappearance and states that he has information about the case. Ángela pretends she is filming a report about the disappearance and asks to interview Bosco about it. In the interview, Bosco insists that Vanessa must have run away with a boyfriend because she sent a note to her family saying that she was in love. Ángela is willing to accept Bosco&#x27;s innocence, but Chema tells her that he is a psychopath. Once home, Ángela realizes that Bosco is inside the house waiting for her. Although she is initially frightened, Bosco charms her family and they invite him to stay for dinner. Once alone, Bosco attempts to seduce Ángela but she resists his advances. At the school, Chema asks a security guard to see the security tape of the video library on the night of Figueroa&#x27;s death. That night, Ángela has a dream that Bosco threatens her with a knife, performs oral sex on her while videotaping it, and then stabs her.

Castro, Ángela new thesis supervisor, questions her about Figueroa&#x27;s death, showing her a security footage of her discovering the body and taking the videotape. As Ángela is about to admit why she took the tape, Chema calls and tells her to leave Castro&#x27;s office immediately, saying that he is involved in the snuff film. Castro fails to catch Ángela as she flees his office. Bosco&#x27;s girlfriend, Yolanda, confronts Ángela and explains that she, Vanessa, Bosco, and Chema, who was once a friend of Bosco, had gone to a series of director&#x27;s workshops with Castro two years previously. Yolanda states that she left when they made Vanessa take off her clothes for a short film, that Chema was obsessed with snuff films, and that she believes he killed Vanessa after the workshop ended. Later, Chema admits to Ángela that he knew Bosco, but claims he also left the workshop when things got out of hand. At night, Chema shows Ángela a hidden tunnel he has discovered in the school&#x27;s video library. In a room off the tunnel, they find shelves of video tapes like the one of Vanessa, indicating that many other women may have been murdered in other snuff films. Suddenly the door to the tunnel closes and they are locked inside. Fearing they will be killed, Chema and Ángela walk further into the tunnel with only matches to light their way. They find an editing room where they fall asleep in each other&#x27;s arms.

When Ángela wakes, the lights have come back on and Chema is gone. She walks through a doorway and is chloroformed. She awakens tied to a chair facing Castro, who is videotaping her. Castro tells that he only edited the snuff videos and did not murder anyone, but that he has to kill her and that her death will be painless and much quicker than Vanessa&#x27;s. As he aims a gun at Ángela&#x27;s head, Chema appears and wrestles with him. The gun goes off, killing Castro. Ángela and Chema escape. Once at her house, Ángela&#x27;s father tells her that her sister, Sena, is at a party with Bosco. Terrified, Ángela hurries to the party. Once there, Sena refuses to leave with Ángela, insisting that Bosco is in love with her. In order to persuade her sister to leave, Ángela approaches Bosco and passionately kisses him. The next day, Ángela tells Chema they need to go to the police. Although initially reluctant, Chema agrees but takes a shower before leaving. While he is in the bathroom, Ángela finds a Sony zoom camera among Chema&#x27;s belongings, which contains a tape showing Ángela from outside her bedroom window. Convinced that Chema has been stalking her, Ángela flees. She goes back home to advise Sena to remain safe, then takes a taxi to Bosco&#x27;s house. She is followed by a figure in a black raincoat.

At Bosco&#x27;s house, he and Ángela talk about their relationship. Suddenly, the lights go out and Bosco goes downstairs to check on the power. When Ángela follows him, she finds him lying on the floor; Chema has followed her to the house and knocked out Bosco. However, Bosco revives and in the struggle that ensues, beats Chema to the ground. While Bosco fetches rope to tie up Chema, he tells Ángela to look in Bosco&#x27;s garage. Ángela does so and recognizes the room from the snuff film of Vanessa. Bosco ties up Ángela and explains how he intends to torture and kill her. However, she cuts her bonds with a knife, slashes Bosco, grabs his gun, and shoots him dead. Ángela visits a recovering Chema in the hospital. On the television in his room, an announcer states that the bodies of six women were found at Bosco&#x27;s home. Ángela gives Chema a book inscribed with an invitation to have coffee with her and tells him she is going to abandon her thesis. As they leave, the announcer states that footage from a snuff film will be shown on air.

== Critical response ==
As a film made by a film student about film students, much of &quot;Tesis&quot; is metafilmic and comments on the Spanish film industry, Hollywood influence and the voyeuristic nature of the horror and snuff genres. Following the aesthetic of the American horror genre, Angela operates as the &quot;Final Girl&quot;, or resourceful female protagonist that defies stereotypical feminine traits. Although &quot;Tesis&quot; fits the suspenseful mold of a Hollywood horror flick rather than its symbol-rich European counterpart, according to European film critic Marguerite la Caze, &quot;Tesis&quot; has a thesis: &quot;human beings, no matter how well-meaning, are attracted to violence and death in all its forms&quot;. Joe Leydon assessed that Amenábar &quot;provides an inventive plot and a sufficient supply of red herrings&quot;.

&quot;Tesis&quot; has generated much critical analysis due to its study of the fascination of violence. Film critic Leora Lev discusses Angela&#x27;s ethical rejection and simultaneous attraction to violent images as this film&#x27;s primary conversation. Lev states that Angela&#x27;s psychosexual conflict with both the snuff film and the murderer, Bosco, is emblematic of the culture that consumes violent films and reality television series.

On the film-critics aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Thesis&quot; has a critical rating of 83% based on 12 reviews.

In September 2019, the probable carcinogen &quot;N&quot;-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) was discovered in ranitidine products from a number of manufacturers, resulting in recalls. In April 2020, ranitidine was withdrawn from the United States market and suspended in the European Union and Australia due to these concerns.

In 2022, these concerns were confirmed in a Taiwanese nationwide population study finding &quot;significant trends of increased liver cancer risk with an increasing dose of ranitidine&quot; (up to 22% higher than control) and increased gastric, pancreatic, lung and overall cancer risk.
Common side effects include headaches, and pain or burning sensation if given by injection. Serious side effects may include cancer, liver problems, a slow heart rate, pneumonia, and the potential of masking stomach cancer. It is also linked to an increased risk of &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; colitis. Ranitidine is an H2 histamine receptor antagonist that works by blocking histamine, thus decreasing the amount of acid released by cells of the stomach.
Ranitidine was discovered in England in 1976 and came into commercial use in 1981. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It has been withdrawn at regulator request from most markets, including the United States; according to the UK NHS, it has been discontinued globally.

==Former medical uses==
* Relief of heartburn
* Short-term and maintenance therapy of gastric and duodenal ulcers
* With nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce the risk of ulceration Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are more effective for the prevention of NSAID-induced ulcers.
* Pathologic gastrointestinal (GI) hypersecretory conditions such as Zollinger–Ellison syndrome
* Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD or GERD)
* Erosive esophagitis
* Part of a multidrug regimen for &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; eradication to minimise the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence
* Recurrent postoperative ulcer
* Upper GI bleeding
* For prevention of acid-aspiration pneumonitis during surgery, it can be administered preoperatively. The drug increases gastric pH, but generally has no effect on gastric volume. In a 2009 meta-analysis comparing the net benefit of PPIs and ranitidine to reduce the risk of aspiration before anaesthesia, ranitidine was found to be more effective than PPIs in reducing the volume of gastric secretions. Ranitidine may have an anti-emetic effect when administered preoperatively.
* Prevention of stress-induced ulcers in critically ill patients
* Used together with diphenhydramine as secondary treatment for anaphylaxis; after first-line epinephrine.

==Contraindication==
Ranitidine has been discontinued globally, according to the NHS, and is contraindicated due to excess cancer risk and the ready availability of H2 antagonist and PPI alternatives.

==Adverse effects==
These adverse effects for ranitidine have been reported as events in clinical trials:

===Central nervous system===
Rare reports have been made of ranitidine causing malaise, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, and vertigo. In severely ill, elderly patients, cases of reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression, and hallucinations have been reported.

===Cardiovascular===
Arrhythmias such as tachycardia, bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and premature ventricular beats have also been reported.

===Gastrointestinal===
All drugs in the H2 receptor blocker class of medicines have the potential to cause vitamin B12 deficiency, secondary to a reduction in food-bound vitamin B12 absorption. Elderly patients taking H2 receptor antagonists are more likely to require B12 supplementation than those not taking such drugs. H2 blockers may also reduce the absorption of drugs (azole antifungals, calcium carbonate) that require an acidic stomach. In addition, multiple studies suggest the use of H2 receptor antagonists such as ranitidine may increase the risk of infectious diarrhoea, including traveller&#x27;s diarrhoea and salmonellosis. A 2005 study found that by suppressing acid-mediated breakdown of proteins, ranitidine may lead to an elevated risk of developing food or drug allergies, due to undigested proteins then passing into the GI tract, where sensitisation occurs. Patients who take these agents develop higher levels of immunoglobulin E against food, whether they had prior antibodies or not. Even months after discontinuation, an elevated level of IgE in 6% of patients was still found in the study.

===Liver===
Cholestatic hepatitis, liver failure, hepatitis, and jaundice have been noted, and require immediate discontinuation of the drug. Blood tests can reveal an increase in liver enzymes or eosinophilia, although in rare instances, severe cases of hepatotoxicity may require a liver biopsy.

===Lungs===
Ranitidine and other histamine H2 receptor antagonists may increase the risk of pneumonia in hospitalised patients. Ranitidine increases the risk of community-acquired pneumonia in adults and children.

===Blood===
Thrombocytopenia is a rare but known side effect. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia usually takes weeks or months to appear, but may appear within 12 hours of drug intake in a sensitised individual. Typically, the platelet count falls to 80% of normal, and thrombocytopenia may be associated with neutropenia and anemia.

===Skin===
Rash, including rare cases of erythema multiforme, and rare cases of hair loss and vasculitis have been seen.

==Precautions==
===Disease-related concerns===
Relief of symptoms due to the use of ranitidine does not exclude the presence of a gastric malignancy. In addition, with kidney or liver impairment, ranitidine must be used with caution. It should be avoided in patients with porphyria, as it may precipitate an attack.

===Children===
In children, the use of gastric acid inhibitors has been associated with an increased risk for development of acute gastroenteritis and community-acquired pneumonia. A cohort analysis including over 11,000 neonates reported an association of H2 blocker use, and an increased incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) neonates. In addition, about a six-fold increase in mortality, necrotizing enterocolitis, and infection such as sepsis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection was reported in patients receiving ranitidine in a cohort analysis of 274 VLBW neonates.

===Drug tests===
Ranitidine may return a false positive result with some commercial urine drug screening kits for testing for drugs of abuse.

===Cancer-causing due to inherent instability===
In June 2019, Valisure informed the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that Zantac-branded and generic ranitidine resulted in very high levels of NDMA in the human body &quot;due to an inherent instability of the ranitidine molecule&quot;.

In September 2019, the FDA acknowledged that ranitidine medicines, including some products sold under the brand name Zantac, contained a nitrosamine impurity called &quot;N&quot;-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), classified as a probable human carcinogen, at unacceptable levels. Health Canada announced that it was assessing NDMA in ranitidine and requested that manufacturers stop the distribution of ranitidine products in Canada until the NDMA levels in the products are found to be safe. Health Canada announced that ranitidine drugs were being recalled by Sandoz Canada, Apotex Inc., Pro Doc Limitée, Sanis Health Inc., and Sivem Pharmaceuticals ULC. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) started a European Union-wide review of ranitidine medicines at the request of the European Commission.

In October 2019, the US. FDA observed that the third-party laboratory that found very high levels of NDMA was using higher temperatures in its tests to detect nitrosamine impurities. The NDMA was mostly generated by the added heat, but the higher temperatures are recommended for using a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry method to test for NDMA in valsartan and angiotensin II receptor blockers. The FDA stated that it recommends using a Liquid Chromatography-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC-HRMS) testing protocol to test samples of ranitidine. Its LC-HRMS testing method does not use elevated temperatures, and has shown the presence of much lower levels of NDMA in ranitidine medicines than were reported by the third-party laboratory. International regulators using similar LC-MS testing methods have also shown the presence of lower but still unacceptable levels of NDMA in ranitidine samples. The FDA provided additional guidance about using another LC-MS method based on a triple-quadrupole MS platform.

In September 2019, Sandoz issued a &quot;precautionary distribution stop&quot; of all medicines containing ranitidine, followed a few days later by a recall of ranitidine hydrochloride capsules in the United States. The Italian Medicines Agency recalled all ranitidine that uses an active pharmaceutical ingredient from Saraca Laboratories. The Federal Union of German Associations of Pharmacists (&quot;Arzneimittelkommission der Deutschen Apotheker&quot;) published a list of recalled products, as did the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia.

In November 2019, the FDA stated that its tests found levels of NDMA in ranitidine and nizatidine that are similar to those that one may typically ingest with common foods such as grilled or smoked meats. The FDA also stated that its simulated gastric fluid model tests and simulated intestinal fluid model tests indicated that NDMA is not formed when exposed to acid in the stomach with a normal diet. The FDA advised companies to recall their ranitidine if testing shows levels of NDMA above the acceptable daily intake (96 nanograms per day or 0.32 parts per million for ranitidine). At the same time, it indicated that some levels of NDMA found in medicines still exceeded the agency&#x27;s acceptable levels.

In December 2019, the FDA asked manufacturers of ranitidine and nizatidine products to expand their NDMA testing to include all lots of the medication before making them available to consumers.

By the end of 2019, ranitidine had already fallen from the 40th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States in 2018, to 53rd place for 2019, with about 13.6million prescriptions for the year, versus nearly 19 million the previous year. This reflects total prescriptions for all of 2019, while safety concerns affected sales in only the final 4 months of the year.

In April 2020, new FDA testing and evaluation prompted by information from third-party laboratories confirmed that NDMA levels increase in ranitidine even under normal storage conditions, and NDMA has been found to increase significantly in samples stored at higher temperatures, including those at which the product may be exposed during distribution and handling by consumers. The testing also showed that the level of NDMA increases as ranitidine medication ages. These conditions may raise the NDMA level above the acceptable daily intake limit. The EMA completed and issued their EU-wide review at the end of the month and the European Commission suspended all ranitidine products in the EU.

In August 2020, the EMA provided guidance to marketing authorization holders for avoiding the presence of nitrosamine impurities and asked them to review all chemical and biological human medicines for the presence of nitrosamines and to test the products at risk. In September 2020, the FDA issued guidance about the control of nitrosamine impurities in human drugs. An implementation plan was issued in February 2021.

In 2022, these concerns were confirmed in a Taiwanese nationwide population study finding &quot;significant trends of increased liver cancer risk with an increasing dose of ranitidine&quot; (22% higher than control) and increased gastric, pancreatic, lung (26%, 35%, and 17% respectively), but &quot;only liver cancer displayed a significant association with long-term ranitidine use&quot; and &quot;there was no continuous dose–response relationship among the other individual cancers&quot;. Overall cancer risk also increased by 10% (&quot;p&quot; &lt; 0.001).

The FDA issued revised guidelines about nitrosamine impurities in September 2024.

==== List of recalls ====
In September 2019, Apotex recalled all over-the-counter ranitidine tablets sold in the United States at Walmart, Rite Aid, and Walgreens. These retailers, along with CVS, removed Zantac and some generics from their shelves.

In October 2019, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency of the United Kingdom (UK) issued a drug alert for ranitidine &quot;... to proactively communicate the recall to hospitals, pharmacies, dispensing practices, retailers and wholesalers in the UK.&quot; This included all Zantac-branded preparations, along with all generic preparations of ranitidine from Teva UK Limited, Rosemont Pharmaceuticals Limited, Omega Pharma Limited and Galpharm International Limited, Perrigo Company plc, Creo Pharma Limited and Tillomed Laboratories Limited, OTC Concepts Ltd, Relonchem Ltd, Noumed Life Sciences Ltd, and Medreich Plc., Accord Healthcare, Medley Pharma Limited, and Medreich Plc.

In October 2019, the Department of Health and Social Care of the United Kingdom issued a supply distribution alert (SDA/2019/005) for all oral formulations of ranitidine.

In October 2019, Sanofi recalled all over-the-counter Zantac in the United States and Canada, Perrigo issued a worldwide recall of ranitidine, Dr. Reddy&#x27;s issued a recall of all ranitidine products in the United States, and Novitium Pharma recalled all ranitidine hydrochloride capsules in the US.

In November 2019, Aurobindo Pharma, Amneal Pharmaceuticals, American Health Packaging, Golden State Medical Supply, and Precision Dose recalled some lots of ranitidine tablets, capsules, and syrup.

In December 2019, Glenmark Pharmaceutical Inc., USA, recalled some lots of ranitidine tablets.

In January 2020, Appco Pharma LLC and Northwind Pharmaceuticals recalled some lots of ranitidine tablets and capsules.

In February 2020, American Health Packaging recalled some lots of ranitidine tablets manufactured by Amneal Pharmaceuticals.

In April 2020, the FDA requested a manufacturer&#x27;s market withdrawal of ranitidine, meaning that ranitidine products would not be available for prescription or over-the-counter sale in the US.

In April 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency recommended the suspension of all ranitidine medicines in the European Union because of the presence of unacceptable levels of NDMA. 

A ranitidine manufacturer requested a re-examination of the decision, but in December 2020, the EMA confirmed its recommendation to suspend all ranitidine medicines in the European Union. The UK National Health Service (NHS) Web site said &quot;Ranitidine is not currently available in the UK or globally... It&#x27;s not yet known whether it will be available again in future.&quot; A March 2024 review left the message up.

In 2021, Solara Active Pharma Sciences, which supplies ranitidine active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), said that it had mitigated the risks of the formation of NDMA during the manufacturing of ranitidine API. The company was granted a revised certificate by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines and Healthcare, which proves that the API complies with certain European rules. GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi, and Teva said they had no plans to reintroduce the drug in the EU, but Accord Healthcare considered the possible reintroduction of ranitidine. However a control strategy regarding NDMA formation through the end of the product’s shelf life, despite heat, time and digestion due to endogenous formation from the API, would be required.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Ranitidine is a competitive, reversible inhibitor of the action of histamine at the histamine H2 receptors found in gastric parietal cells. This results in decreased gastric acid secretion and gastric volume, and reduced hydrogen ion concentration. Ranitidine&#x27;s acid-lowering effect is more pronounced for basal and nocturnal acid secretion than it is for food-stimulated acid secretion. Additional indirect effects of ranitidine are decreased pepsin secretion and increased nitrate-reducing bacterial flora.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Oral absorption: 50%

Protein binding: 15%

Metabolism: The major metabolite in the urine is ranitidine &quot;N&quot;-oxide, which represents less than 4% of the dose. Other metabolites of ranitidine include ranitidine &quot;S&quot;-oxide (1%) and desmethyl ranitidine (1%).

Half-life elimination: With normal renal function, ranitidine taken orally has a half-life of 2.5–3.0 hours. If taken intravenously, the half-life is generally 2.0–2.5 hours in a patient with normal kidney function and normal creatinine clearance. In patients with kidney dysfunction, the half-life may increase to 4 to 5 hours.

Excretion: The primary route of excretion is the urine. In addition, about 30% of the orally administered dose is collected in the urine as unabsorbed drug in 24 hours.

====Elderly====
In the elderly population, the plasma half-life of ranitidine is prolonged to 3–4 hours secondary to decreased kidney function causing decreased clearance.

====Children====
In general, studies of pediatric patients (aged one month to 16 years) have shown no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameter values in comparison to healthy adults, when correction is made for body weight.

==History==

Ranitidine was first prepared in England as AH19065 by John Bradshaw in the summer of 1977 in the Ware research laboratories of Allen and Hanburys, part of the former Glaxo organisation. Its development was a response to the first in class histamine H2 receptor antagonist, cimetidine, developed by Sir James Black at Smith, Kline and French, and launched in the United Kingdom as Tagamet in November 1976. Both companies eventually merged as GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), following a sequence of mergers and acquisitions, starting with the integration of Allen and Hanbury&#x27;s Ltd and Glaxo to form Glaxo Group Research in 1979, and ultimately with the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham in 2000. Ranitidine was the result of a rational drug-design process using what was by then a fairly refined model of the histamine H2 receptor and quantitative structure-activity relationships.

Glaxo refined the model further, by replacing the imidazole ring of cimetidine with a furan ring with a nitrogen-containing substituent, and in doing so developed ranitidine. Ranitidine was found to have a far-improved tolerability profile (i.e. fewer adverse drug reactions), longer-lasting action, and 10 times the activity of cimetidine. Ranitidine has 10% of the affinity that cimetidine has to CYP450, so it causes fewer side effects, but other H2 blockers famotidine and nizatidine have no CYP450 significant interactions.

Ranitidine was introduced in 1981, and was the world&#x27;s biggest-selling prescription drug by 1987. Subsequently, it was largely superseded by the more effective proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) class of drugs, with omeprazole becoming the biggest-selling drug for many years. When omeprazole and ranitidine were compared in a study of 144 people with severe inflammation and erosions or ulcers of the oesophagus, 85% of those treated with omeprazole healed within eight weeks, compared with 50% of those given ranitidine. In addition, the omeprazole group reported earlier relief of heartburn symptoms.

In September 2019, the probable carcinogen &quot;N&quot;-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) was discovered in ranitidine products from a number of manufacturers, resulting in recalls; in April 2020, it was withdrawn from the United States market and suspended in Europe and Australia.

==Preparations==

Preparations of ranitidine products include oral tablets (75, 150, and 300 mg), effervescent tablets, and syrups, and injectable solutions; with doses of specific ranitidine product preparations are available over-the-counter (OTC) in various countries. In the United Kingdom, only the lowest-strength, 75-mg tablet was available to purchase without a prescription. In Australia, packs containing seven or 14 doses of the 150-mg tablet were available in supermarkets, small packs of 150-mg and 300-mg tablets were schedule 2 pharmacy medicines. Larger doses and pack sizes required a prescription. In the United States, 75- and 150-mg tablets were available OTC. In India, it is sold under multiple brand names.

<text>Johann Adam Schall von Bell (1 May 1591 – 15 August 1666) was a German Jesuit, astronomer and instrument-maker. He spent most of his life as a missionary in China (where he is remembered as &quot;Tang Ruowang&quot;) and became an adviser to the Shunzhi Emperor of the Qing dynasty.

== Life ==
Schall von Bell was born to noble parents in Cologne or nearby Lüftelberg (today part of Meckenheim) in the Holy Roman Empire. After he graduated from the Jesuit Gymnasium in Cologne he moved to Rome and studied subjects such as mathematics and astronomy at the Collegium Germanicum. In 1611 he joined the Society of Jesus and continued his education at the Gregorianum.

In 1618 he left for China on a Portuguese ship with a group of missionaries under the lead of Nicolas Trigault. The next year the group reached the Portuguese trading port of Macau where Schall von Bell spent some time learning Chinese. He started missionary work inside China in 1622, but allegedly his success was limited. He participated in the defence of Macau from a Dutch invasion in the same year, and personally took a Dutch captain prisoner from that victorious battle.

Schall von Bell and Giacomo Rho were sent to Beijing in 1630 to continue the work of the deceased Johann Schreck on a reform of the Chinese calendar. With Xu Guangqi, he participated in modifying the Chinese calendar and compiling what is known as the Chongzhen calendar. Named after the Chongzhen Emperor, the last emperor of the Ming dynasty, the modified calendar provided more accurate predictions of eclipses of the sun and the moon. Upon Xu&#x27;s passing, he held the requiem in his honour and oversaw the process of shipping the body back to his relatives in Shanghai. The Ming obtained the services of Father von Bell’s foundry in Beijing, which is said to have produced some five hundred cannon.

After the Ming-Qing Transition in 1644, Schall von Bell gained access to the newly installed Shunzhi Emperor and became one of his trusted counsellors. He was made a mandarin and held an important post in connection with the mathematical school: &quot;Director of the Imperial Observatory and the Tribunal of Mathematics&quot;.

His position enabled him to procure from the emperor permission for the Jesuits to build churches and to preach throughout the country. Thus Schall von Bell is indirectly credited with 500,000 Chinese that are said to have been baptised by Jesuit missionaries within fourteen years, making him a successful missionary.

The Shunzhi Emperor died in 1661 and Schall von Bell&#x27;s position started to erode. In 1664 he was challenged by Yang Guangxian and the Muslim astronomers, who accused him of planning a rebellion and of having wilfully miscalculated time and place of a funeral and in that way contributed to the death of Consort Donggo. Schall von Bell and other Jesuits, Ferdinand Verbiest included, were imprisoned. Schall von Bell had a stroke in prison. At trial, Verbiest spoke in his defence, but all were condemned to death. However, after an earthquake, the Jesuits were pardoned and only five Chinese Christians working in the astronomical office were executed. The Jesuits were exiled to Macau. Schall von Bell died within one year of his release. He was buried in the Jesuits&#x27; Zhalan Cemetery in Beijing.

Yang Guangxian succeeded as the head astronomer at the court. Four years later, however, the young Kangxi Emperor replaced him with Verbiest, and von Bell&#x27;s honours were fully restored.

A collection of Schall von Bell&#x27;s manuscripts was deposited in the Vatican Library.

==Dispute==

In 1758, an allegation, which is disputed by most Jesuits and Catholic historians, was made public. The secretary to Monsignor Charles-Thomas Maillard De Tournon reported that during the final years of his life, Schall von Bell lived &quot;separated from the other missionaries and removed from obedience to his superiors, in the house given him by the emperor with a woman whom he treated as his wife and who bore him two children.&quot;

No evidence was provided and the allegations are even contradicted by contemporaneous witnesses and official Chinese documents. It is stated that if true, the story would almost certainly have been reported by others who sought to discredit Schall von Bell and other Jesuits. In addition, the Jesuit structure would most likely have reported the fact to authorities at higher levels of the order.

The 1912 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; suggests that the source of the rumour was most likely the adoption by Schall von Bell of the son of a former Chinese servant.

==Encounter with Prince Sohyeon==
Crown Prince Sohyeon, first son of King Injo of the Korean Joseon dynasty, was held hostage in Shenyang and later in Beijing. He was highly interested in Western sciences and visited Schall von Bell.

Schall von Bell gave him books on Western sciences as well as on the Catholic faith that drew the crown prince&#x27;s interest. Prince Sohyeon suddenly died when he entered Korea in 1645, which dissipated Schall von Bell&#x27;s hope to extend the Jesuit&#x27;s missionary work into Korea.

==Continued cultural relevance in China==
In 1992, Taiwan issued a commemorative stamp for the 400th anniversary of the birth of Schall von Bell, noting &quot;with all his accomplishments his place in Chinese history is secure&quot;.

In 2013, Chinese CCTV published a documentary on Schall von Bell, as part of its series Biographies. At the very end of the film, the commentator noted that the Chongzhen calendar edited by Schall von Bell is still in use today. China International Communication Center&#x27;s major biographical series of six Westerners in premodern China also featured Schall von Bell. He is also visible in Chinese soap operas, partly because he was close to Shunzhi Emperor and palace drama is the most popular genre on Chinese TV.

<doc id="1266994" wikidata="Q290313" url="?curid=1266994" title="History of France (1900–present)">
<text>The history of France from 1900 to the present includes:
* the later years of the Third Republic (1870–1940)
:* World War I (1914–1918)
:* Interwar Period (1918–1939)
:* World War II (1939–1945)
* the Fourth Republic (1946–1958)
* the Fifth Republic (since 1958)

==Geography==
In 1914, the territory of France was different from today&#x27;s France in two important ways: most of Alsace and the northeastern part of Lorraine had been annexed by Germany in 1870 (following the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871), and the North African country of Algeria had been established as an integral part of France (department) in 1848. Alsace-Lorraine would be restored at the end of World War I (only to be lost again, temporarily, to the Germans a second time during World War II).

==Demographics==
Unlike other European countries France did not experience a strong population growth in the mid-to-late 19th century and first half of the 20th century. That would be compounded by the massive French losses of World War I, roughly estimated at 1.4 million French dead including civilians (or nearly 10% of the active adult male population) and four times as many wounded — and World War II, estimated at 593,000 French dead (one-and-a-half times the number of American dead), of which 470,000 were civilians. From a population of around 39 million in 1880, France still had only a population of 40 million in 1945. The post-war years would bring a massive &quot;baby boom&quot;, and with immigration, France reached 50 million in 1968. This growth slowed down in 1974.

Since 1999, France has seen an unprecedented growth in population. In 2004, population growth was 0.68% and almost reached North American levels (2004 was the year with the highest increase in French population since 1974). France is now well ahead of all other European countries in population growth (except for the Republic of Ireland) and in 2003, France&#x27;s natural population growth (excluding immigration) was responsible for almost all the natural growth in European population (the population of the European Union increased by 216,000 inhabitants (without immigration), of which 211,000 was the increase in France&#x27;s population alone, and 5,000 was the increase in all the other countries EU combined).

Today, France, with a population of 62.5 million, or 65 million including overseas territories, is the third most populous country of Europe, behind Russia and Germany.

Immigration in the 20th century differed significantly from that of the previous century. The 1920s saw great influxes from Italy and Poland; in the 1930-50s immigrants came from Spain and Portugal. Since the 1960s however, the greatest waves of immigrants have been from former French colonies: Algeria (1 million), Morocco (570,000), Tunisia (200,000), Senegal (45,000), Mali (40,000), Cambodia (45,000), Laos (30,000), Vietnam (35,000). Much of this recent immigration was initially economical, but many of these immigrants have remained in France, gained citizenship and integrated into French society. Estimates vary, but of the 60 million people living in France today, close to 4 million claim foreign origin. This massive influx has created tensions in contemporary France, especially over issues of &quot;integration into French society&quot; and the notion of a &quot;French identity&quot;, and in recent years the most controversial issues have been with regards to Muslim populations (at 7%, Islam is the second largest religion in today&#x27;s France; see Islam in France).

Eastern-European and North-African Jewish immigration to France largely began in the mid to late 19th century. In 1872, there were an estimated 86,000 Jews living in France, and by 1945 this increased to 300,000. Many Jews integrated (or attempted to integrate) into French society, although French nationalism led to antisemitism in many quarters. The Vichy regime&#x27;s collaboration with the Nazi Holocaust led to the extermination of 76,000 French Jews (the Vichy authorities however gave preferential treatment to &quot;integrated&quot; Jews who had been in France from two to five generations and who had fought in World War I or held important administrative positions in the government), and of all other Western European countries, this figure is second only to Germany; but many Jews were also saved by acts of heroism and administrative refusal to participate in the deportation (three quarters of France&#x27;s Jewish population was spared, a higher proportion than any other European country touched by the holocaust). Since the 1960s, France has experienced a great deal of Jewish immigration from the Mediterranean and North Africa, and the Jewish population in France is estimated at around 600,000 today.

Around the start of the 20th century, almost half of all Frenchmen depended on the land for their living, and up until World War II, France remained a largely rural country (roughly 25% of the population worked on the land in 1950), but the post-war years also saw an unprecedented move to the cities: only around 4% of the French continue to work in farms and 73% live today in large cities. By far the largest of these is Paris, at 2.1 million inhabitants (11 million in the Parisian region), followed by Lille, Lyon, Marseille (upwards of 1.2 million inhabitants each). Much of this urbanization takes place not in the traditional center of the cities, but in the suburbs (or &quot;banlieues&quot;) that surround them (the cement and steel housing projects in these areas are called &quot;cités&quot;). With immigration from poorer countries, these &quot;cités&quot; have been the center of racial and class tensions since the 1960s.

==French identity==
The loss of regional and traditional culture (language and accent, local customs in dress and food), the poverty of many rural regions and the rise of modern urban structures (housing projects, supermarkets) have created tensions in modern France between traditionalists and progressives. Compounding the loss of regionalism is the role of the French capital and the centralized French State.

Independence movements sprang up in Brittany, Corsica and the Basque regions, and the Vichy Regime (echoing Nazi racial propaganda) actively encouraged Catholicism and local &quot;folk&quot; traditions, which they saw as truer foundations for the French nation.

The post-war years saw the state take control of a number of French industries. The modern political climate has however been for increasing regional power (&quot;decentralization&quot;) and for reduced state control in private enterprise (&quot;privatization&quot;).

It can be assumed that “The First World War initiated a period of sudden, often traumatic transformation. It accelerated changes that had slowly begun to alter French cultural, social, and economic life in the first decades of the twentieth century.” French identity and culture had been completely disheveled after World War I, and that destruction is in part caused by gender-ambiguity. French culture and identity were heavily based on societal gender roles that seemed to have been blurred after the war. Perhaps the “most famous expression of this postwar sense of cultural mortality” came from a 1919 letter by Paul Valery, which discussed that “We modern civilizations, we too now know that we are mortal like the others.&quot;

== Feminist movement ==

After World War I, when it had lost 1.4 million of its citizens to World War I, France was facing a serious issue. With a casualty rate higher than any other country in Europe at 16.5 percent, along with 3 million wounded and 1.1 million suffering from permanent disability, France was suffering from a low birthrate. At the same time, France was painting a fearful picture of women no longer wanting to have children. Because of the flagging birthrate, legislators introduced and passed a bill on July 23, 1920, which penalized the use of propaganda that encouraged and supported abortion and contraceptives. Historians believe that the legislative victory can be interpreted as either a “logical gesture of the postwar conservative, nationalist Block national that came into power in the November legislative elections of 1919,” or they saw the natalist victory as “a response to an already serious demographic problem made worse by wartime casualties.” Prior to World War I, until 1914, abortions were “frequent and virtually unpunished, though outlawed by Article 317 of the Penal Code.” Feminists like Madeleine Pelletier, a female physician and socialist thinker, “developed socio-economic pro-abortion arguments which were already well known to the intellectual working class. Natalists that had pushed this legislation as well as further restrictions against a women’s right not to bear children, as Pelletier observes, “was presented as a class position.” Legislation like this represented the interest of those with a high socio-economic status that “used the working class as a pool of labour to bolster the economy.&quot; Throughout the first couple decades of the 20th century, there is a noticeable clash between French feminists, who more aligned with the socialist parties of France, and the natalists, who resonated more with the conservative parties of France.

==Historical overview==
===Coming of World War I 1900–1914===

In an effort to isolate Germany, France successfully formed alliances with Russia and Great Britain. First came the Franco-Russian Alliance of 1894, then the 1904 Entente Cordiale with Great Britain, and finally the Anglo-Russian Entente in 1907 which became the Triple Entente. This alliance with Britain and Russia against Germany and Austria in 1914 led Russia, Britain, and France to enter World War I as Allies. Military leaders in Berlin planned to defeat first France, then Russia.

Paris feared the German military power (Imperial German Army, Imperial German Navy, Luftstreitkräfte and Feldluftschiffer). The Franco-Russian Alliance of 1894 served as the cornerstone of French foreign policy until 1917, in the expectation that Germany would avoid a two-front war. A further link with Russia was provided by vast French investments and loans before 1914. In 1904, French foreign minister Théophile Delcassé negotiated the &quot;Entente Cordiale&quot; with Lord Lansdowne, the British Foreign Secretary, an agreement that ended a long period of Anglo-French tensions and hostility. The &quot;Entente Cordiale&quot;, which functioned as an informal Anglo-French alliance, was further strengthened by the First and Second Moroccan crises of 1905 and 1911, and by secret military and naval staff talks. Delcassé&#x27;s rapprochement with Britain was controversial in France as Anglophobia was prominent around the start of the 20th century, sentiments that had been much reinforced by the Fashoda Incident of 1898, in which Britain and France had almost gone to war, and by the Boer War, in which French public opinion was very much on the side of Britain&#x27;s enemies. Ultimately, the fear of German power was the link that bound Britain and France together.

Preoccupied with internal problems, France paid little attention to foreign policy in the period between late 1912 and mid-1914 (→ 1913 in France, 1914 in France), although it did extend military service to three years from two over strong Socialist objections in 1913. The rapidly escalating Balkan crisis of July 1914 surprised France, and not much attention was given to conditions that led to the outbreak of World War I. Paris was caught by surprise when the German army suddenly invaded and plunged toward Paris. However London decided that France must be aided or Germany would be far too powerful, and so it declared war on Germany.

=== World War I (1914–1918) ===
Many French intellectuals welcomed the war to avenge the humiliation of defeat and loss of territory to Germany following the Franco-Prussian War of 1871. After Socialist leader Jean Jaurès, a pacifist, was assassinated at the start of the war, the French socialist movement abandoned its antimilitarist positions and joined the national war effort. Prime Minister Rene Viviani called for unity—for a &quot;Union sacrée&quot; (&quot;Sacred Union&quot;)—ending the feud between the right and left factions that had been fighting bitterly. France had few dissenters. However, by 1917 war-weariness was a major factor, seriously weakening the willingness of the Army to take the offensive. Soldiers said that instead of attacking it was best to wait for the arrival of millions of Americans. The soldiers were protesting not just the futility of frontal assaults in the face of German machine guns but also degraded conditions at the front lines and at home, especially infrequent leaves, poor food, the use of African and Asian colonials on the home front, and concerns about the welfare of their wives and children.

The economy was hurt by the German invasion of major industrial areas in the northeast. This occupied area, in 1913, had produced 58% of the steel, and 40% of the coal. Considerable relief came with the influx of American food, money and raw materials in 1917.

Georges Clemenceau became prime minister in November 1917, a time of defeatism and acrimony. Italy was on the defensive, and Russia had surrendered. Civilians were angry as rations fell short and the threat of German air raids grew. Clemenceau realized his first priority was to restore civilian morale. He arrested Joseph Caillaux, a former French prime minister, for openly advocating peace negotiations. He won all-party support to fight to victory calling for &quot;la guerre jusqu&#x27;au bout&quot; (war until the end).

The war brought great losses of manpower and resources. Fought in large part on French soil, it led to approximately 1.4 million French dead including civilians (see World War I casualties), and four times as many wounded. France borrowed billions of dollars from the U.S. that it had to repay. The stipulations of the Treaty of Versailles (1919) were favourable: Alsace and Lorraine were returned to France; Germany was required to take full responsibility for the war and to pay war reparations to France that covered its entire war costs, including veterans&#x27; benefits. One German industrial area, Saar Basin, a coal and steel region, was temporarily occupied by France.

=== Homefront (1914–1919) ===

A dichotomy between the two sexes, that had once already been defined, was becoming inflamed. While the majority of men were sent off into the warfront, the majority of women stayed at the homefront. Because 3.7 million men had left work to serve away from home, women had many new job opportunities. Some quit their old &#x27;feminine&#x27; jobs to take on these more masculine tasks, fulfilling the occupational and family roles that men previously filled. Men in uniform were not pleased. When it comes to viewing the &quot;material contrasts between trench and civilian life, returning soldiers saw the homefront as a world of extravagance and luxury, whose pleasures they were largely denied.&quot; Soldiers returning home soon became lost in a perpetual and mental &quot;no-man&#x27;s-land.&quot; They had come home and witnessed women taking on their jobs, their family responsibilities, they felt stranded in that no-man’s-land. Veterans had felt forgotten. The fact that the women on the homefront had &quot;collapsed conventional notions of sexual difference and reversed the boundaries of social marginality,&quot; women had &quot;become the new insiders,&quot; while the men were left on the cascades of civilization. The way in which civilians passed time had &quot;shocked and offended&quot; these soldiers. The contrast between homefront and warfront life was vast. Historian Mary Louise Robert argues that &quot;women&#x27;s lack of knowledge concerning the war can be ascribed to government censorship rather than to a &quot;demoralization&quot; of the homefront.&quot; She writes that the censorship suppressed news of military defeats and the horrors of the trenches.

===Between the wars (1919–1939)===
In 1920, the socialist party (SFIO) was split in two and the majority broke away and formed the French Communist Party (&quot;Section française de l&#x27;internationale communiste&quot;). The remaining minority, led by Léon Blum, &quot;kept the old house&quot; and stayed in the SFIO. In 1924 and again in 1932, the Socialists joined with the Radical-Socialist Party in the &quot;Coalitions of the Left&quot; (&quot;Cartels des Gauches&quot;), but refused actually to join the non-Socialist governments led by the Radicals Édouard Herriot and Édouard Daladier. Daladier resigned under pressure of the far-right leagues after the 6 February 1934 crisis, and conservative Gaston Doumergue was appointed president of the Council. The left-wing had feared a right-wing coup d&#x27;état as those that had taken place with the 1922 March on Rome and events in Germany. Therefore, under the Comintern&#x27;s influence, the Communists changed their line and adopted an &quot;antifascist union&quot; line, which led to the Popular Front (1936–38), which won the 1936 elections and brought Blum to power as France&#x27;s first socialist prime minister. The Popular Front was composed of radicals and socialists, while the communists supported it without participating in it (in much the same way that socialists had supported radicals&#x27; governments before World War I without participating in them). Within a year, however, Léon Blum&#x27;s government collapsed over economic policy, opposition from the elite (the famous &quot;200 hundreds families&quot;) and also over the issue of the Spanish Civil War Blum decided that supporting the Spanish Republicans might lead to civil war inside France. His decision led to huge defections among the French left-wing, while Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini unashamedly armed and supported Francisco Franco&#x27;s troops.

The French far-right expanded greatly and theories of race and antisemitism proliferated in many quarters. Numerous far-right and anti-parliamentarian leagues, similar to the fascist leagues, sprang up, including colonel de la Rocque&#x27;s &quot;Croix-de-Feu&quot; 1927-1936 which, like its larger rival the monarchist &quot;Action Française&quot; (founded in 1898, condemned by Pope Pius XI in 1926, Action Française supported a restoration of the monarchy and of Roman Catholicism as the state religion) advocated national integralism (the belief that society is an organic unity) and organized popular demonstrations in reaction to the Stavisky Affair 1934, hoping to overthrow the government (see 6 February 1934 crisis).

In the 1920s, France established an elaborate system of border defenses (the Maginot Line) and alliances (see Little Entente) to offset resurgent German strength. In the 1930s, the massive losses of the war led many in France to choose the popular appeasement policy that prevented war with Germany over Czechoslovakia, whose alliance with France proved worthless at the Munich Agreement of 1938.

===Great Depression===

The crisis hit France&#x27;s economy in 1931, a bit later than other countries. While during the 1920s it grew at the very strong rate of 4.43% per year, in the 1930s it fell to an average of only 0.63%. Despite the enormous disruption to the economy caused by the Great War, by 1924 industrial and agricultural production had been restored to prewar levels, with rapid and widespread growth from 1924 to 1931.

France tried vigorously but without much success to obtain the reparations Germany had been forced to promise at the Treaty of Versailles. This led France to invade and occupy the Ruhr industrial district of Germany. That failed. Finally, all the major nations agreed to accept the proposals, known as the Dawes Plan of 1924 and the Young Plan of 1929, to stabilize reparation payments. Germany was virtually bankrupt by 1931, and all payments were suspended.

After 1931 rising unemployment and political unrest led to the February 6, 1934 riots. The left banded together and formed the Popular Front, led by SFIO socialist leader Léon Blum, which won the elections in 1936. Ultra-nationalist groups also saw increased popularity, although democracy prevailed until 1940. Economic conditions did not significantly improve, even as the Popular Front reduced the workweek to 40 hours. Fearful of a civil war in France, as was happening in Spain, France led the major nations to call an arms blockade designed to prevent arms shipments to either side during the Spanish Civil War. This effort nonetheless failed to stop arms shipments from Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union.

=== World War II (1939–1945) ===

In September 1939 Hitler invaded Poland, and France and Great Britain declared war. Both sides built up forces along to the Western Front, but for the next eight months neither side made a move: this was the &quot;phony war&quot;. The German
Blitzkrieg began in May 1940, and in six weeks of retreating the French lost 130,000 men. The Allied armies crumbled, but the British managed to rescue their own soldiers and about 100,000 French soldiers in the Dunkirk evacuation.

France was defeated and had to sign an armistice with Nazi Germany on June 22, 1940. French soldiers became prisoners of war in Germany, were assigned to munitions factories as forced labor, and served as hostages. Nazi Germany occupied three fifths of France&#x27;s territory (the Atlantic seaboard and most of France north of the Loire), leaving the rest to the new Vichy collaboration government established on July 10, 1940 under Henri Philippe Pétain. Its senior leaders acquiesced in the plunder of French resources, as well as the sending of French forced labor to Nazi Germany; in doing so, they claimed they hoped to preserve at least some small amount of French sovereignty. After an initial period of double-dealing and passive collaboration with the Nazis, the Vichy regime passed to active participation (largely the work of prime minister Pierre Laval). The Nazi German occupation proved costly; Nazi Germany appropriated a full one-half of France&#x27;s public sector revenue. From 1942 to 1944 many French citizens were deported to death camps and Nazi concentration camps in Germany and Poland.

On the other hand, those who refused defeat and collaboration with Nazi Germany, led by Charles de Gaulle, organized the Free French Forces in the UK. They coordinated resistance movements in occupied and Vichy France. By August 1944, 260,000 French regulars and 300,000 FFI were fighting in France.

In June 1944 Allied forces invaded and forced the Germans to retreat. France was liberated and the Petain regime ended. Paris was liberated on August 25. On September 10, de Gaulle installed his provisional government in Paris. France could now again participate as a partner in the war. In 1945, the French army numbered 1,300,000 men, 412,000 of whom were fighting in Germany and 40,000 in Italy.

==Post-war (1945–Present)==
===1945–1999===
France emerged from World War II to face a series of new problems. After a short period of provisional government initially led by General Charles de Gaulle, a new constitution (October 13, 1946) established the Fourth Republic under a parliamentary form of government, controlled by a series of coalitions. The mixed nature of the coalitions and a consequent lack of agreement on measures for dealing with colonial wars in Indochina and Algeria caused successive cabinet crises and changes of government. The war in Indochina ended with French defeat and withdrawal in 1954. Algeria was host to a community of a million European residents, known as the pieds-noir), contributing to France&#x27;s refusal to grant it independence, until a large-scale war of independence beginning in November 1954 triggered a large-scale domestic political and civil crisis; Algeria was given its independence in 1962, unleashing a massive wave of immigration from the former colony back to France.

The threat of a coup d&#x27;état in May 1958 by French army units and French settlers opposed to concessions in the face of Arab nationalist insurrection led to the fall of the French government and a presidential invitation to de Gaulle to form an emergency government to forestall the threat of civil war. Swiftly replacing the existing constitution with one strengthening the powers of the presidency, he became the elected president in December of that year, inaugurating France&#x27;s Fifth Republic.

In July 1961 when Tunisia imposed a blockade on the French naval base at Bizerte, hoping to force its evacuation the crisis culminated in a three-day battle between French and Tunisian forces that left some 630 Tunisians and 24 French dead, and eventually led to France ceding the city and naval base to Tunisia in 1963.

In 1965, in an occasion marking the first time in the 20th century that the people of France went to the polls to elect a president by direct ballot, de Gaulle won re-election with a 55% share of the vote, defeating François Mitterrand. Meanwhile, the Algerian War went on raging, with de Gaulle progressively adopting a stance favouring Algeria&#x27;s independence. This was interpreted by his supporters in 1958 as a form of treason, and part of them, who organized themselves in the OAS terrorist group, rebelled against him during the Algiers putsch of 1961. But De Gaulle managed to put an end to the war by negotiating the Evian Agreements of March 1962 with the FLN.
By the end of the 1960s, however, French society grew tired of the heavy-handed, patriarchal Gaullist approach, and of the incompatibilities between modern life and old traditions and institutions. This led to a students&#x27; and worker revolt in May 1968, with a variety of demands including educational, labor and governmental reforms, sexual and artistic freedom, and the end of the Vietnam War. The movement saw occupations of public spaces, strikes and demonstrations. At one point, de Gaulle went to see troops in Baden-Baden, possibly to secure the help of the army in case it were needed to maintain public order. However, snap legislative elections subsequently held in late June returned a Gaullist majority in parliament. Still, May 1968 was a turning point in French social relations, with the Grenelle Agreements, in the direction of more personal freedoms and less social control, be it in work relations, education or in private life. In April 1969, de Gaulle resigned following his defeat in a national referendum on government proposals for decentralization, through the creation of 21 regions with limited political powers. He was succeeded by the Gaullist Georges Pompidou (1969–74), who died during his term. Pompidou&#x27;s succession pitted the Gaullists against the more classical conservatives who eventually won, headed by the Independent Republican Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing (1974–81).

Social movements continued after May 1968. These included the occupation of the Lip factory in 1973, which led to an experience in workers&#x27; self-management, supported by the CFDT, the Unified Socialist Party (PSU) and all of the far-left movements. LIP workers participated in the Larzac demonstrations against the extension of a military camp (in which José Bové was present). Maoism and autonomism became quite popular in far-left movements, opposing both the Socialist Party and the Communist Party.

While France continues to revere its rich history and independence, French leaders increasingly tie the future of France to the continued development of the European Union (EU).

The 1972 Common Program between the Socialist Party (PS), the Communist Party (PCF) and the Left Radical Party (PRG) prepared the victory of the Left at the 1981 presidential election, during which for the first time in the Fifth Republic a left-wing candidate won. François Mitterrand, re-elected in 1988, followed a left-wing inspired social and economic program, formulated in the 110 Propositions for France electoral program. However, reforms came to a stop in 1983. Mitterrand&#x27;s two terms were marked by two cohabitations, the first one in 1986–88 with Jacques Chirac as Prime minister.

Mitterrand stressed the importance of European integration and advocated the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty on European economic and political union, which France&#x27;s electorate narrowly approved in September 1992.

The conservative President Jacques Chirac assumed office May 17, 1995, after a campaign focused on the need to combat France&#x27;s persistently high unemployment rate. The center of domestic attention soon shifted, however, to the economic reform and belt-tightening measures required for France to meet the criteria for Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) laid out by the Maastricht Treaty. In late 1995, France experienced its greatest labor unrest in at least a decade, as employees protested government cutbacks.

In evaluating Chirac&#x27;s presidency in 2015, the British magazine The Economist stated:
:In his term, unemployment averaged 10 percent, debt mounted, the French said no to Europe, and the suburban &quot;banlieues&quot; rioted...It was on his watch that France&#x27;s competitive position sharply declined. His popularity sank to 16 percent...[But today] Jacques Chirac has emerged as an improbable icon of retro taste and a figure of public affection.

===2000 to present===
====Sarkozy presidency====

====Hollande presidency====

====Macron presidency====
Macron formally became president on 14 May 2017. In the 2017 legislative election, Macron&#x27;s party La République en marche and its Democratic Movement allies secured a comfortable majority, winning 350 seats out of 577. After The Republicans emerged as the winners of the Senate elections, government spokesman Christophe Castaner stated the elections were a &quot;failure&quot; for his party.

In his first few months as president, Macron pressed for enactment of package of reforms on public ethics, labor laws, taxes, and law enforcement agency powers.

=====Corruption=====
In response to Penelopegate, the National Assembly passed a part of Macron&#x27;s proposed law to stop mass corruption in French politics by July 2017, banning elected representatives from hiring family members. Meanwhile, the second part of the law scrapping a constituency fund was scheduled for voting after Senate objections.

Macron&#x27;s plan to give his wife an official role within government came under fire with criticisms ranging from it being undemocratic to what critics perceive as a contradiction to his fight against nepotism. Following an online petition of nearly 290,000 signatures on change.org Macron abandoned the plan. On 9 August, the National Assembly adopted the bill on public ethics, a key theme of Macron&#x27;s campaign, after debates on the scrapping the constituency funds.

=====Labour policy and unions=====
Macron aims to shift union–management relations away from the adversarial lines of the current French system and toward a more flexible, consensus-driven system modelled after Germany and Scandinavia. He has also pledged to act against companies employing cheaper labour from eastern Europe and in return affecting jobs of French workers, what he has termed as &quot;social dumping&quot;. Under the EU rules, eastern European workers can be employed for a limited time at the salary level in eastern European countries which has led to dispute between the EU states.

The French government announced the proposed changes to France&#x27;s labour rules (&quot;Code du Travail&quot;), being among the first steps taken by Macron and his government to galvanise the French economy. Macron&#x27;s reform efforts have encountered resistance from some French trade unions. The largest trade union, the CFDT, has taken a conciliatory approach to Macron&#x27;s push and has engaged in negotiations with the president, while the more militant CGT is more hostile to reforms. Macron&#x27;s labour minister, Muriel Pénicaud, is overseeing the effort.

The National Assembly including the Senate approved the proposal, allowing the government to loosen the labour laws after negotiations with unions and employers&#x27; groups. The reforms, which were discussed with unions, limit payouts for dismissals deemed unfair and give companies greater freedom to hire and fire employees as well as to define acceptable working conditions. The president signed five decrees reforming the labour rules on 22 September. Government figures released in October 2017 revealed that during the legislative push to reform the labour code, the unemployment rate had dropped 1.8%, the biggest since 2001.

===== Macron´s second term 2022- =====
In the 2022 presidential election president Macron was re-elected after beating his far-right rival, Marine Le Pen, in the runoff. He was the first re-elected incumbent French president since 2002.

==Population trends==

The population held steady from 40.7 million in 1911, to 41.5 million in 1936. The sense that the population was too small, especially in regard to the rapid growth of more powerful Germany, was a common theme in the early twentieth century. Natalist policies were proposed in the 1930s, and implemented in the 1940s.

France experienced a baby boom after 1945; it reversed a long-term record of low birth rates. In addition, there was a steady immigration, especially from former French colonies in North Africa. The population grew from 41 million in 1946, to 50 million in 1966, and 60 million by 1990. The farm population decline sharply, from 35% of the workforce in 1945 to under 5% by 2000. By 2004, France had the second highest birthrate in Europe, behind only Ireland.

==Economy==

The overall growth rate of the French economy shows a very strong performance in the 1920s and again in the 1960s, with poor performances in the 1910s, 1930s, and 1990s.
By the end of the 19th century, France had joined the industrial era. But it had joined late, and comparatively it had lost in the competition with its war-footing neighbor Germany, and with its trade-based chief rival across the Channel, Great Britain. France had great industry and infrastructure and factories, by 1900; but compared to Germany and Britain was &quot;behind&quot;, so that people spoke of and French politicians complained of &quot;the French backwardness (le retard français)&quot;.

In 1870 the first signs of French industrial and general economic decline started to appear, compared to their new neighbor in Bismarck&#x27;s newly united Germany, appeared during the Franco-Prussian War. The total defeat of France was less a demonstration of French weakness than it was of German militarism and industrial strength; this was in contrast to France&#x27;s occupation of Germany during the Napoleonic wars. A huge sum had to be paid to Germany to end the war which provided the latter with even more capital.

By 1914, however, German armament and general industrialization had out-distanced not only France but all of its neighbors. Just before 1914, France was producing about one-sixth as much Coal as Germany, made less than a third as much Pig iron and a quarter as much Steel. In a scenario recounted best in Barbara Tuchman&#x27;s book &quot;The Guns of August&quot;, France together with Germany&#x27;s other competitors had entered a &quot;war-footing&quot; rearmament race which, once again, temporarily stimulated spending while reducing saving and investment.

The First World War—the &quot;Great War&quot;—however produced an economic outcome disastrous for all parties, not just for the German losers. As predicted by Keynes in his bitter post-Versailles Conference book, &quot;The Economic Consequences of the Peace&quot;, the heavy war reparations imposed upon Germany not only were insufficient to fuel French economic recovery, they greatly damaged a Germany which might have become France&#x27;s leading trade and industrial development partner, thereby seriously damaging France as well.

And their very heavy loss of life, in the &quot;Great War&quot;, robbed France of a generation of its youth, and of some of the youthful imagination necessary for facing Germany again, only 25 years later, in the Second World War, when a by-then aged French general staff was ill-prepared and entirely-defensive up against an even more militant German economy and army. Damaged by the Great Depression, the older leaders left in France were reluctant to assume a &quot;war-footing&quot; economy yet again, and France was overrun and occupied by Nazi Germany, and its wartime economy turned entirely to supporting Germany and the German war effort.

The great hardships of wartime, and of the immediate post-war period, were succeeded by a period of steady economic development, in France, now often fondly recalled there as &quot;The Thirty Glorious Years (Les Trente Glorieuses&quot;). Alternating policies of &quot;interventionist&quot; and &quot;free market&quot; ideas enabled the French to build a society in which both industrial and technological advances could be made but also worker security and privileges established and protected. By the end of the 20th century, France once again was among the leading economic powers of the world, although by the year 2000 there already was some fraying around the edges: people in France and elsewhere were asking whether France alone, without becoming even more an integral part of a pan-European economy, would have sufficient market presence to maintain its position, and that worker security and those privileges, in an increasingly &quot;Globalized&quot; and &quot;transnational&quot; economic world.

==Literature==

Twentieth century French literature was profoundly shaped by the historical events of the century and was also shaped by—and a contributor to—the century&#x27;s political, philosophical, moral, and artistic crises.

Inspired by the theatrical experiments in the early half of the century and by the horrors of the war, the so-called avant-garde Parisian theater, &quot;New Theater&quot; or &quot;Theatre of the Absurd&quot; around the writers Eugène Ionesco, Samuel Beckett, Jean Genet, Arthur Adamov, Fernando Arrabal refused simple explanations and abandoned traditional characters, plots and staging. Other experiments in theatre involved decentralisation, regional theater, &quot;popular theater&quot; (designed to bring working classes to the theater), and theater heavily influenced by Bertolt Brecht (largely unknown in France before 1954), and the productions of Arthur Adamov and Roger Planchon. The Avignon festival was started in 1947 by Jean Vilar who was also important in the creation of the T.N.P. or &quot;Théâtre National Populaire.&quot;

The French novel from the 1950s on went through a similar experimentation in the group of writers published by &quot;Les Éditions de Minuit&quot;, a French publisher; this &quot;Nouveau roman&quot; (&quot;new novel&quot;), associated with Alain Robbe-Grillet, Marguerite Duras, Robert Pinget, Michel Butor, Samuel Beckett, Nathalie Sarraute, Claude Simon, also abandoned traditional plot, voice, characters and psychology. To a certain degree, these developments closely paralleled changes in cinema in the same period (the Nouvelle Vague).

Among the leading women writers were Colette, Simone de Beauvoir, Hélène Cixous, Marguerite Duras and Monique Wittig.

Twentieth century French literature did not undergo an isolated development and reveals the influence of writers and genres from around the world. In turn, French literature has also had a radical impact on world literature. Because of the creative spirit of the French literary and artistic movements at the beginning of the century, France gained the reputation as being the necessary destination for writers and artists. Important foreign writers who have lived and worked in France (especially Paris) in the twentieth century include: Oscar Wilde, Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, William S. Burroughs, Henry Miller, Anaïs Nin, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, Julio Cortázar, Vladimir Nabokov, Eugène Ionesco. Some of the most important works of the century were written by foreign authors in French (Eugène Ionesco, Samuel Beckett).

France has been more permissive in terms of censorship, and many important foreign language novels were originally published in France while being banned in America: Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; (published by Sylvia Beach in Paris, 1922), Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot; and William S. Burroughs&#x27;s &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; (both published by Olympia Press), and Henry Miller&#x27;s &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; (published by Obelisk Press).

==Art==

Following on the radical developments of Impressionism and Post-Impressionism at the end of the nineteenth century, the first half of the twentieth century in France saw the even more revolutionary experiments of cubism, dada and surrealism, artistic movements that would have a major impact on Western, and eventually world, art. After World War II, while French artists explored such tendencies as tachism, fluxus and new realism, France&#x27;s preeminence in the visual arts was eclipsed by developments elsewhere (the United States in particular).

<text>Saxitoxin (STX) is a potent neurotoxin and the best-known paralytic shellfish toxin. Ingestion of saxitoxin by humans, usually by consumption of shellfish contaminated by toxic algal blooms, is responsible for the illness known as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP).

The term saxitoxin originates from the genus name of the butter clam (&quot;Saxidomus&quot;) from which it was first isolated. But the term saxitoxin can also refer to the entire suite of more than 50 structurally related neurotoxins (known collectively as &quot;saxitoxins&quot;) produced by protists, algae and cyanobacteria which includes saxitoxin itself (STX), neosaxitoxin (NSTX), gonyautoxins (GTX) and decarbamoylsaxitoxin (dcSTX).

Saxitoxin has a large environmental and economic impact, as its presence in bivalve shellfish such as mussels, clams, oysters and scallops frequently leads to bans on commercial and recreational shellfish harvesting in many temperate coastal waters around the world including the Northeastern and Western United States, Western Europe, East Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. In the United States, paralytic shellfish poisoning has occurred in California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and New England.

==Source in nature==
Saxitoxin is a neurotoxin naturally produced by certain species of marine dinoflagellates (&quot;Alexandrium&quot; sp., &quot;Gymnodinium&quot; sp., &quot;Pyrodinium&quot; sp.) and freshwater cyanobacteria (&quot;Dolichospermum cicinale&quot; sp., some &quot;Aphanizomenon&quot; spp., &quot;Cylindrospermopsis&quot; sp., &quot;Lyngbya&quot; sp., &quot;Planktothrix&quot; sp.) Saxitoxin accumulates in &quot;planktivorous invertebrates, including mollusks (bivalves and gastropods), crustaceans, and echinoderms&quot;.

Saxitoxin has also been found in at least twelve marine puffer fish species in Asia and one freshwater fish tilapia in Brazil. The ultimate source of STX is often still uncertain. The dinoflagellate &quot;Pyrodinium bahamense&quot; is the source of STX found in Florida. Recent research shows the detection of STX in the skin, muscle, viscera, and gonads of &quot;Indian River Lagoon&quot; southern puffer fish, with the highest concentration (22,104 μg STX eq/100 g tissue) measured in the ovaries. Even after a year of captivity, Landsberg et al. found the skin mucus remained highly toxic. The concentrations in puffer fish from the United States are similar to those found in the Philippines, Thailand, Japan, and South American countries. Puffer fish also accumulate a structurally distinct toxin, tetrodotoxin.

==Structure and synthesis==
Saxitoxin dihydrochloride is an amorphous hygroscopic solid, but X-ray crystallography of crystalline derivatives enabled the structure of saxitoxin to be determined. Oxidation of saxitoxin generates a highly fluorescent purine derivative which has been utilized to detect its presence.

Several total syntheses of saxitoxin have been accomplished.

==Mechanism of action==

Saxitoxin is a neurotoxin that acts as a selective, reversible, voltage-gated sodium channel blocker. One of the most potent known natural toxins, it acts on the voltage-gated sodium channels of neurons, preventing normal cellular function and leading to paralysis.

The voltage-gated sodium channel is essential for normal neuronal functioning. It exists as integral membrane proteins interspersed along the axon of a neuron and possessing four domains that span the cell membrane. Opening of the voltage-gated sodium channel occurs when there is a change in voltage or some ligand binds in the right way. It is of foremost importance for these sodium channels to function properly, as they are essential for the propagation of an action potential. Without this ability, the nerve cell becomes unable to transmit signals and the region of the body that it enervates is cut off from the nervous system. This may lead to paralysis of the affected region, as in the case of saxitoxin.

Saxitoxin binds reversibly to the sodium channel. It binds directly in the pore of the channel protein, occluding the opening, and preventing the flow of sodium ions through the membrane. This leads to the nervous shutdown described above.

== Biosynthesis ==

Although the biosynthesis of saxitoxin seems complex, organisms from two different kingdoms, indeed two different domains, species of marine dinoflagellates and freshwater cyanobacteria, are capable of producing these toxins. While the prevailing theory of production in dinoflagellates was through symbiotic mutualism with cyanobacteria, evidence has emerged suggesting that dinoflagellates, themselves, also possess the genes required for saxitoxin synthesis.

Saxitoxin biosynthesis is the first non-terpene alkaloid pathway described for bacteria, though the exact mechanism of saxitoxin biosynthesis is still essentially a theoretical model. The precise mechanism of how substrates bind to enzymes is still unknown, and genes involved in the biosynthesis of saxitoxin are either putative or have only recently been identified.

Two biosyntheses have been proposed in the past. Earlier versions differ from a more recent proposal by Kellmann, et al. based on both biosynthetic considerations as well as genetic evidence not available at the time of the first proposal. The more recent model describes a STX gene cluster (sxt) used to obtain a more favorable reaction. The most recent reaction sequence of Sxt in cyanobacteria is as follows. Refer to the diagram for a detailed biosynthesis and intermediate structures.
# It begins with the loading of the acyl carrier protein (ACP) with acetate from acetyl-CoA, yielding intermediate 1.
# This is followed by SxtA-catalyzed methylation of acetyl-ACP, which is then converted to propionyl-ACP, yielding intermediate 2. 
# Later, another SxtA performs a Claisen condensation reaction between propionyl-ACP and arginine producing intermediate 4 and intermediate 3. 
# SxtG transfers an amidino group from an arginine to the α-amino group of intermediate 4 producing intermediate 5. 
# Intermediate 5 then undergoes retroaldol-like condensation by SxtBC, producing intermediate 6. 
# SxtD adds a double bond between C-1 and C-5 of intermediate 6, which gives rise to the 1,2-H shift between C-5 and C-6 in intermediate 7.
# SxtS performs an epoxidation of the double bond yielding intermediate 8, and then an opening of the epoxide to an aldehyde, forming intermediate 9. 
# SxtU reduces the terminal aldehyde group of the STX intermediate 9, thus forming intermediate 10. 
# SxtIJK catalyzes the transfer of a carbamoyl group to the free hydroxyl group on intermediate 10, forming intermediate 11. 
# SxtH and SxtT, in conjunction with SxtV and the SxtW gene cluster, perform a similar function which is the consecutive hydroxylation of C-12, thus producing saxitoxin and terminating the STX biosynthetic pathway.

== Illness and poisoning ==

===Toxicology===

Saxitoxin is highly toxic to guinea pigs, fatal at only 5 μg/kg when injected intramuscularly. The lethal doses (LD50) for mice are very similar with varying administration routes: i.v. is 3.4 μg/kg, i.p. is 10 μg/kg and p.o. is 263 μg/kg. The oral LD50 for humans is 5.7 μg/kg, therefore approximately 0.57 mg of saxitoxin is lethal if ingested and the lethal dose by injection is about one-tenth of that (approximately 0.6 μg/kg). The human inhalation toxicity of aerosolized saxitoxin is estimated to be 5 mg·min/m3. Saxitoxin can enter the body via open wounds and a lethal dose of 50 μg/person by this route has been suggested.

===Illness in humans===

The human illness associated with ingestion of harmful levels of saxitoxin is known as paralytic shellfish poisoning, or PSP, and saxitoxin and its derivatives are often referred to as &quot;PSP toxins&quot;.

The medical and environmental importance of saxitoxin derives from the consumption of contaminated shellfish and certain finfish which can concentrate the toxin from dinoflagellates or cyanobacteria. The blocking of neuronal sodium channels which occurs in PSP produces a flaccid paralysis that leaves its victim calm and conscious through the progression of symptoms. Death often occurs from respiratory failure. PSP toxins have been implicated in various marine animal mortalities involving trophic transfer of the toxin from its algal source up the food chain to higher predators.

Studies in animals have shown that the lethal effects of saxitoxin can be reversed with 4-aminopyridine, but there are no studies on human subjects. As with any paralytic agent, where the acute concern is respiratory failure, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation or artificial ventilation of any means will keep a poisoned victim alive until antidote is administered or the poison wears off.

== Military interest ==

Saxitoxin, by virtue of its extremely low LD50, readily lends itself to weaponization. In the past, it was considered for military use by the United States and was developed as a chemical weapon by the US military. It is known that saxitoxin was developed for both overt military use as well as for covert purposes by the CIA. Among weapons stockpiles were M1 munitions that contained either saxitoxin or botulinum toxin or a mixture of both. On the other hand, the CIA is known to have issued a small dose of saxitoxin to U-2 spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers in the form of a small injection hidden within a silver dollar, for use in the event of his capture and detainment.

After the 1969 ban on biological warfare by President Nixon, the US stockpiles of saxitoxin were destroyed, and development of saxitoxin as a military weapon ceased. In 1975, the CIA reported to Congress that it had kept a small amount of saxitoxin and cobra venom against Nixon&#x27;s orders which was then destroyed or distributed to researchers.

It is listed in schedule 1 of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The United States military isolated saxitoxin and assigned it the chemical weapon designation &quot;TZ&quot;.

<text>Gerrit Anne &quot;Gerry&quot; Blaauw (17 July 1924 – 21 March 2018) was a Dutch computer scientist, known as one of the principal designers of the IBM System/360 line of computers, together with Fred Brooks, Gene Amdahl, and others.

== Biography ==
Born in The Hague, Netherlands, Blaauw received his BA from the Delft University of Technology in 1946. In 1947, Blaauw won an exclusive scholarship funded by IBM Chief Executive Officer Thomas J. Watson. After an initial year at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania, Blaauw studied at Harvard University. He received his MA in 1949 and his PhD in 1952 under supervision of Howard Aiken, inventor of the early Mark I computer. At Harvard, he worked on design of the Mark III and Mark IV computers. Blaauw met Fred Brooks while he was working for IBM and visited Harvard, where Fred Brooks was then a graduate student.

After graduation in 1952, Blaauw returned to the Netherlands where he worked at the Mathematical Centre on the second ARRA computer. In 1955 he returned to the United States to work at IBM&#x27;s Poughkeepsie labs where he worked with Brooks on a number of projects:
* He was a designer on the IBM 7030 STRETCH project.
* He worked on the ill-fated IBM 8000 series, and in particular designed a paging system for the IBM 8106 in the 1960-1961 period.
* He was a key engineer on the IBM System/360 project, announced in 1964. Among other contributions, Blaauw made the successful case for an 8-bit (as opposed to 6-bit) computer architecture.
Blaauw also designed a revolutionary address translation system, the &quot;Blaauw Box&quot;, which was removed from the original System/360 design, but was later used in IBM&#x27;s unsuccessful proposal to MIT&#x27;s Project MAC. Subsequently, Dynamic Address Translation (DAT) hardware of a somewhat different design was incorporated in the important IBM System/360-67 computer. As implemented on the Model 67, DAT hardware allowed the implementation of some of the first practical paged virtual memory systems – perhaps the first to be commercially successful. The Model 67 was being used in commercial applications by 1968. The earlier Ferranti Atlas Computer was a seminal platform for paging research, but suffered from well-studied performance issues such as thrashing. Virtual memory address translation capabilities similar to those on the S/360-67 were subsequently included in all models of the IBM System/370 computer line that followed.

After leaving IBM, Blaauw became a computer science professor in the Netherlands. He retired in 1989 as professor emeritus with Universiteit Twente. In 1982 he was elected member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1997 he co-authored &quot;Computer Architecture: Concepts and Evolution&quot; with Brooks.

Blaauw died in Utrecht.

Blaauw was a devout Christian who gave particular attention, especially after retirement, to the relationship of science and faith, a topic he explored in a booklet available in English, Dutch and Spanish.

<text>Bad Schandau (; , ) is a spa town in Germany, in the Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge district of Saxony. It is situated on the right bank of the Elbe, at the mouth of the valley of the Kirnitzsch and in the area often described as Saxon Switzerland.

== Geography ==
Bad Schandau lies east of the Elbe right on the edge of the Saxon Switzerland National Park in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains; the National Park Centre is located in the town. The original town centre nestled on the steep, towering sandstone rocks on the right-hand, northern bank of the river Elbe and squeezed in places into the narrow valley of the Kirnitzsch. The town centre lies above sea level (HN) (market square), whilst its highest points lie over above sea level. A rural tram line, the Kirnitzschtal Tramway, accompanies the little river for several kilometres and offers access to the nearby walking area.

Bad Schandau is about from the Czech frontier and southeast of Dresden on the railway to Děčín.

== Subdivisions ==
The borough of Bad Schandau consists of the core town and the villages Krippen, Ostrau, Porschdorf, Postelwitz, Prossen, Schmilka, and Waltersdorf. All of these except Krippen lie on the right (northern) bank of the Elbe, whilst Krippen lies on the left (southern) bank.

The original craftsmen&#x27;s and merchants&#x27; settlement left of the Elbe with surviving timber-framed houses that were mentioned as early as 1379 has been a summer resort since the end of the 19th century, when development of tourism began. The village was the sphere of action of the Krippen villager and inventor of mechanical wood pulp for the manufacture of paper, Friedrich Gottlob Keller (1816–95), from 1853 to his death. A memorial tablet on the Keller Museum, house number 76 in the main road named after him and in whom the inventor once lived, celebrates him and his work. In 2009, Krippen had a population of 568 (1999: 720).

A stream, the Krippenbach, joins the Elbe near Krippen. The stream is supplied from the Gautzschgraben spring near the border with Czech Republic, and also from other sources on the other side of the state border, its catchment area reaching almost as far as Maxičky on the Bohemian side of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains below the Okrouhlik ( above NN).

Krippen was incorporated into Bad Schandau borough on 1 January 1999.
=== Postelwitz ===

The summer resort of Postelwitz has been part of the borough of Bad Schandau since 1934. The village, which comprises a number of separate groups of houses, hugs the rock face tightly about upstream below the rocks of the Schrammsteine. This originally Slavic settlement of rafters, fishermen, stonebreakers and boat builders was first recorded in 1446. Ships&#x27; anchor smiths worked in the village until 1968. The local sandstone quarries (at times the most important in the region) worked from the second half of the 16th century until 1907; were then reforested and are accessible today via the Elbe Promenade (&quot;Elbpromenade&quot;). The surviving timber-framed houses nos. 55–67, the so-called Seven Brothers&#x27; Houses (&quot;Siebenbrüderhäuser&quot;), are linked to a legend in whom a boatman wanted to build a house for each of his sons. His own building was, however, to be taller than them all. On house nos. 43 and 69, as well as the ferryman&#x27;s house, there are Elbe high-water marks. In 2009, Postelwitz had a population of 282 (1999: 323).

=== Schmilka ===
Schmilka, the border village to the Czech Republic on the Elbe at a height of , has been part of the borough of Bad Schandau since 1 January 1973. This village of Elbe boatmen, rafters, stonecutters, charcoal burners, &quot;Pechsieder&quot; and forest workers was first recorded in 1582. Small timber-framed houses still dominate its façades. In 2009, Schmilka had 137 inhabitants (1999: 169).

The Ilmen Spring (&quot;Ilmenquelle&quot;) rises near the border and, with a discharge of 6 L/s, is the most powerful in Saxon Switzerland. The hills of Schrammsteine and Großer Winterberg may be ascended from Schmilka along various paths and climbs such as the Saints&#x27; Way (&quot;Heilige Stiege&quot;) or the Rübezahl Way (&quot;Rübezahlstiege&quot;).

The Ilmenbach stream drives the Schmilka Mill (&quot;Schmilksche Mühle&quot;) only a few metres below the spring. Built in 1665, it is one of the first buildings in Schmilka. The mill was closed in the 19th century. In 2007, however, the mill was restored to a functional state again. Historic pictures, including a copperplate by Adrian Ludwig Richter, were used in the restoration. Richter was one of the artists who walked the so-called Painters&#x27; Way (&quot;Malerweg&quot;) in Saxon Switzerland about 200 years ago. The Painters&#x27; Way runs directly by the mill. The Schmilka Mill traditionally runs during the Mill Festival that takes place every year at Whitsun. Within the mill is a holiday home, the &quot;Mühlchen&quot; (&quot;Little Mill&quot;), which can be used as holiday accommodation. The village also has a brewery, and functions as a wellness retreat with organic food.

=== Ostrau ===
Ostrau () on the &quot;Ostrauer Scheibe&quot; rises above the Elbe and lies at a height of above NN. The ice-age loess-loam on the plateau of the &quot;Ostrauer Scheibe&quot; enabled the establishment in former times of a German village for seven farmsteads. Ostrau has been directly linked to the town of Bad Schandau since 1904 with an electric passenger lift that was built at the initiative of the hotelier, Rudolf Sendig, who also financed it. Old timber-framed farmsteads, guesthouses (&quot;Pensionen&quot;), holiday homes, a modern spa facility, inns, villas and family homes make up the buildings of the village. With just under 100 inhabitants, the village had a very isolated existence on an exposed upland at the end of the 19th century. But even in 1900, there were ambitious plans for this location with its long-distance, all-round views to be turned into an exclusive tourist centre with sports facilities and an airfield. But only the aforementioned lift was built along with wooden, Scandinavian-style villas on the &quot;Ostrauer Ring&quot;, also at Sendig&#x27;s initiative. In 2009, Ostrau had a population of 419 (1999: 541).

== History ==
In the first half of the 14th century, German settlers acquired the Elbe meadows between Rathmannsdorf and Postelwitz from the feudal estate of Hohnstein and founded a trading post here. Schandau was first mentioned in the records in 1445 and was given, in effect, the status of a town as a result of its important location as a trading site on the Elbe in 1467 by a council constitution. Since about 1800, Bad Schandau has been a spa town and summer resort. In 1877, the place was given a permanent crossing over the river, the Carola Bridge. In 1920, the town was granted the official title of &quot;Bad&quot; (&quot;Spa&quot;). In 1936, it became a Kneipp spa.

The town is the smallest German place with its own tram service, the Kirnitzschtal Tramway. The tramway runs from Schandau to Lichtenhain Waterfall and has been working since 1898.

Bad Schandau was badly hit by the flooding of the Elbe in the years 1845, 2002 and 2006. The floodwater on 16/17 August 2002 stood at above average, above the market square and high in the church. The Schöna gauge reached 12.04 (Bad Schandau gauge 11.88), volumetric flow 4,780 m3/s. The high-water mark was below that of 1845. On 3 April 2006, a high-water mark of and above the market square above average was reached at about 11 pm. Schöna gauge 8.88, volumetric flow 2720 m3/s. The square floods when the Schöna gauge reaches 7.60.

=== Coat of arms ===
In 1480, Schandau was granted the right by Prince Ernest of Saxony to bear a coat of arms and a seal. The coat of arms shows a ship under sail, probably a reference to the importance of Elbe shipping.

== Politics ==

=== Town council ===
The local elections of 26 May 2019 saw a voter turnout of 69,9 % (+9,5) with the following results:

: +/−: Changes against the local elections of 25 May 2014, *: Voters&#x27; associations combined

=== Administration ===
Bad Schandau is a in the Bad Schandau Administrative Association (&quot;Verwaltungsgemeinschaft Bad Schandau&quot;) for the municipalities of Rathmannsdorf and Reinhardtsdorf-Schöna.

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Bad Schandau is twinned with:
* Česká Kamenice, Czech Republic
* Lądek-Zdrój, Poland
* Fichtenau, Germany
* Gößweinstein, Germany
* Überlingen, Germany

== Culture and places of interest ==


=== Overview ===
Schandau was described in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition (1911) thus:
The prefix &quot;Bad&quot; was added in 1920 in acknowledgement of the spa status of the town (the German &quot;Bad&quot; means &quot;spa&quot; in English).

The 2009 film, &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;, directed by Quentin Tarantino, was shot primarily in Bad Schandau, and at Studio Babelsberg in Berlin.

=== Museums ===
* Town Gallery (&quot;Stadtgalerie&quot;)
* Local History Museum (&quot;Heimatmuseum&quot;)
* National Park Museum (&quot;Nationalparkmuseum&quot;)
* Friedrich Gottlob Keller Museum, Krippen, &quot;Friedrich-Gottlob-Keller-Straße&quot; 76 (about the discovery and inventor of mechanical wood pulp paper)

=== Buildings / places of interest ===
Bad Schandau&#x27;s town profile on the right bank of the river is dominated by the hotels of the Gründerzeit bordering the Elbe, the two bridges and St John&#x27;s Church (&quot;Johanniskirche&quot;).

From 2002 to 2007, comprehensive renovation work was carried out on the Gründerzeit hotels on the riverfront – the best-known in the 19th century was the &quot;Dampfschiff&quot; (&quot;Steamship&quot;). The building was gutted from the ground upwards and the façades restored. Several apartment complexes are housed in bathhouse villas (&quot;Bäder-Villen&quot;). The ensemble was opened again in 2007 under the name &quot;Elbresidenz Bad Schandau&quot;.

The impressive Lutheran St John&#x27;s Church with its octagonal west tower has existed in its present form since 1679. The baroque skylight turret was added in 1711 following a town fire. The interior of the church with its wooden coffer, single-storey matroneum and stained glass windows in the chancel is the result of fundamental conversion work in 1876–77. Especially valuable is the two-storied Renaissance altar in sandstone, which the Dresden sculptor, Hans Walther, originally made for the Kreuzkirche, Dresden, and which stood in Dresden Anne&#x27;s from 1760 to 1902.

The main sight in the market square (&quot;Marktplatz&quot;) with its town hall (1863) and several Renaissance buildings (the &quot;Gambrinus&quot; brewery, house No. 1 with its timber-framed upper storey) since 1896 has been the Sendig Fountain next to the church, which for reasons unknown lost its Art Nouveau top extension with sculptures during World War II; it was reconstructed from 1994 to 2011.

The spa facilities and the 3,500 m2 Botanical Garden (&quot;Pflanzengarten Bad Schandau&quot;) with over 1,500 species of plants is located at the entrance to the Kirnitzsch valley. By the tram stop of the Kirnitzschtal Tramway stands the so-called Ice Age Rock (&quot;Eiszeitstein&quot;) illustrating that in the Pleistocene epoch the inland ice sheet extended as far as here from Scandinavia.

Near the Park Hotel and the historical lift to Ostrau stands the Roman Catholic Church next to the hillside on the right of the Elbe. This building was built as accommodation for a Russian diplomat in the classic Saint Petersburg villa style of the 19th century and has been used since 1924 by the Catholic Church as a consecrated building.

The &quot;historical lift to Ostrau&quot; is a , free-standing iron construction, that links the village of Ostrau higher up the hill. The hotelier, Rudolf Sendig, had this electrically driven lift built in 1904 by the firms of Kelle &amp; Hildebrandt (iron framework) and &quot;Kühnscherf &amp; Söhne&quot; (lift). The lift was officially opened on Easter Sunday 1905 and the rivetted structure, that has been protected since 1954, was refurbished in 1989–1990. Due to its view over Saxon Switzerland around Bad Schandau, especially the rocks of the Schrammsteine, but also because of the understated Art Nouveau ornamentation, a journey on the technical monument has become something of a tourist attraction.

The so-called &quot;Ostrauer Scheibe&quot; is a plateau that can be reached on foot along a hiking trail from the Botanical Garden in the Kirnitsch Valley, over the old cart track (&quot;Ostrauer Berg&quot;), as well as by car along a road that weaves in hairpin bends up from Postelwitz.

The new Schrammstein Open-Air Pool (&quot;Schrammstein-Bad&quot;) that was badly damaged before it could open by the flooding of the Elbe in 2002 went bust but, after a two-year delay, was able to open under its new owners, toskanaworld, as the so-called Toskana Thermal Baths (&quot;Toskana-Therme&quot;); this firm has similar facilities in Bad Sulza and Bad Orb.

=== Memorials ===
* VVN monument in the Spa Park (&quot;Kurpark&quot;) to the victims of Fascism
* Memorial rock in front of the mountain hut (&quot;Berghütte über dem Zahnsgrund&quot;) in the village of Ostrau for the Communist resistance fighter Kurt Schlosser, who was murdered in Dresden in 1944
* Memorial tablet from 1957 at a Cave in the Schrammsteinen (&quot;Höhle in den Schrammsteinen&quot;) commemorating the resistance fighters of the United Climbing Division of Dresden (&quot;Vereinigten Kletterabteilung Dresden&quot;)

=== Dialect ===
A special form of the Upper Saxon dialect is spoken in Bad Schandau: the South East Meissen dialect, which is one of five Upper Saxon or Meissen dialects.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

<text>Mean Machine is a 2001 British sports comedy film directed by Barry Skolnick and starring former footballer Vinnie Jones. The film is an adaptation of the 1974 American film &quot;The Longest Yard&quot;, featuring association football rather than American football.

==Plot==
Danny &quot;The Mean Machine&quot; Meehan (Vinnie Jones) is a retired footballer and former captain of England who was banned from football for life for fixing an unspecified match they played against Germany. In the present day, after a long drinking session, he drives recklessly to a local bar where he is pursued by police. Inside the bar, when asked to take a breathalyser test, he attacks two police officers and is arrested; he is later convicted and sentenced to three years in Longmarsh prison.

Once inside, his status as a celebrity immediately puts him at odds with the guards, who brutally beat him soon after arrival. The prison governor then pulls strings to ensure Meehan serves his sentence in Longmarsh as the head coach of the prison wardens&#x27; football team. However, Meehan declines, and instead trains a team of other convicts to play against the wardens.

Meehan is met with an unwelcome reception from his cellmates, Raj, Jerome, and Trojan. Outside, Meehan meets and befriends an elderly convict, Doc, who teaches him how to survive in prison. While cleaning the yards with Doc, Meehan is introduced to Sykes, a gangster and one of the most respected inmates in the prison. Sykes also shows aggression towards Meehan, revealing he lost a large amount of money betting on the England game he had fixed. Later, in the prison cafeteria, Meehan makes another ally, meeting the prison&#x27;s fast-talking contraband dealer &quot;Massive&quot;.

Meehan and Massive begin the recruitment process for his team, but struggle, as many of the inmates are reluctant to join due to both Sykes&#x27; influence over the prison and their hatred for Meehan as a cheat. As Meehan tries and fails to form a team, Massive is playing football in a prison hallway, when a racist guard approaches him and assaults him as the other inmates watch in horror. Meehan lunges at the guard and protects Massive from further beating, earning the respect of many of the other inmates. His team includes a violent maximum-security inmate named &quot;The Monk&quot;. Meanwhile, the warden gets himself into trouble with &quot;Barry the Bookie,&quot; an unlicensed bookmaker who was recommended to him by Sykes. After being threatened on the phone by Barry, the warden decides to try to make back the money he owes by betting on the prison guards&#x27; team.

A psychotic inmate named Nitro accuses Meehan of being a snitch. Meehan gets ambushed in the showers and threatened but refuses to tell, earning the trust of both Sykes&#x27; men and Sykes himself. To win the lost money back, Sykes bribes Meehan: all is forgiven if his team wins. Angry that his plan to have Meehan killed failed, Nitro, a bomb expert, offers to have Meehan killed in exchange for a transfer to a lower security prison which one of the guards, Ratchett, agrees to. Nitro crafts a bomb in his cell and places it in Meehan locker. Meehan and the rest of the team are going over tactics in one of the cells, when Doc arrives at the cell and is killed by the bomb. Nitro is subsequently sent to another facility, but not to the minimum-security prison he was promised, but to a mental health facility.

The match commences shortly after Doc&#x27;s death. At half time, the inmates&#x27; team is winning 1–0, and the morale is high until the governor attempts to blackmail Meehan, accusing him of being an accessory to Doc&#x27;s murder and threatening to sentence him to 20 years unless he throws the match. At first he puts his own interests before that of the team&#x27;s, deliberately playing poorly and faking injury to be taken off the pitch. As the final moments of the game tick down, he redeems himself, bravely using a square-ball to fellow inmate &#x27;Billy the Limpet&#x27; to win the game for the cons. Afterward, the Captain of the Guards, Burton, refuses to co-operate with the governor&#x27;s attempts to get revenge on Meehan, instead congratulating him on the win. The governor&#x27;s vehicle explodes, and Sykes informs him that he and Barry the Bookie will retaliate if he tries anything. A victorious Meehan and Massive walk triumphantly across the pitch.

==Cast==
The film included actors who had formerly played professional football, including three players who were teammates with the film&#x27;s star, Vinnie Jones, at different times in their careers. Charlie Hartfield (prisoners&#x27; team in the film) played with Jones for Sheffield United, while Paul Fishenden and Brian Gayle (guards&#x27; team in the film) played with Jones for Wimbledon. Nevin Saroya (prisoners&#x27; team) was once a Brentford youth team player and Perry Digweed (guard&#x27;s team), played as a goalkeeper primarily for Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, although in the film, he is a defender. Ryan Giggs, then playing for Manchester United and the Wales national football team, appears briefly (at minute 77:00) as a warden.

==Production==
Producer Matthew Vaughn, while looking for a film vehicle to highlight ex-football star Vinnie Jones, came across director Robert Aldrich&#x27;s 1974 American football comedy &quot;The Longest Yard&quot;. Jones, who was known for rough play and off-field rowdiness, seemed a natural for the lead role.

&quot;Mean Machine&quot; was filmed from April to June 2001. Most of the prison scenes were filmed at HM Prison Oxford, and the match was filmed at The Warren, the former home ground of Yeading. The Warren is located in Hayes.

==Release and reception==

&quot;Mean Machine&quot; was released in United Kingdom cinemas on 28 December 2001 and according to the box office database website Box Office Mojo, grossed $2,288,365 during its opening weekend with a total domestic gross of $6,288,153 (as of 27 January 2002). The film was released in the United States on 22 February 2002 with total a gross of $92,770. Total foreign gross (excluding the United States) was $929,283 (as of 23 February 2003).
Metacritic gave the film a score of 45%, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. A major criticism of the film was that it was unintentionally funny and led to &quot;prison cliches&quot;.

Jamie Russell of the BBC wrote, &quot;[I]t keeps its tongue welded firmly in its cheek. The scriptwriters have enough sense to replay every funny moment from the original, while also adding a couple of innovations of their own. The final soccer game is definitely the high point of the proceedings, if only because it lets the star do what he does best - play some very dirty football.&quot;

While A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Reviewing &quot;The Longest Yard&quot; in The New York Times 28 years ago, Nora Sayre objected to its clumsiness and violence, but admitted to being entertained by the football sequences. Watching this remake, I had the opposite response: the story was moderately engaging and moved swiftly, but the long soccer match at the end bored me silly. Perhaps this is just American chauvinism, or perhaps that kind of football is inherently less cinematic than ours. It&#x27;s certainly no less brutal.&quot;

<doc id="1267022" wikidata="Q412208" url="?curid=1267022" title="Lisinopril">
<text>Lisinopril is a medication belonging to the drug class of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and is used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure), heart failure, and heart attacks. For high blood pressure it is usually a first-line treatment. It is also used to prevent kidney problems in people with diabetes mellitus. Lisinopril is taken orally (swallowed by mouth). Full effect may take up to four weeks to occur.
Common side effects include headache, dizziness, feeling tired, cough, nausea, and rash. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure, liver problems, hyperkalemia (high blood potassium), and angioedema. Use is not recommended during the entire duration of pregnancy as it may harm the baby. Lisinopril works by inhibiting the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system.
Lisinopril was patented in 1978 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1987. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the third most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 82million prescriptions. It is available in combination with amlodipine (as lisinopril/amlodipine) and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (as lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide).

== Medical uses ==
Lisinopril is typically used for the treatment of high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, and diabetic nephropathy and after acute myocardial infarction (heart attack). Lisinopril is part of the ACE inhibitors drug class. Lisinopril is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, adjunctive therapy for heart failure, and acute myocardial infarction.

== Contraindications ==
Lisinopril is contraindicated in people who have a history of angioedema (hereditary or idiopathic) or who have diabetes and are taking aliskiren.

== Adverse effects ==
Common side effects include headache, dizziness, feeling tired, cough, nausea, and rash. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure, liver problems, hyperkalemia, and angioedema. Use is not recommended during the entire duration of pregnancy as it may harm the baby.

=== Pregnancy and breastfeeding ===
Animal and human data have revealed evidence of harm to the embryo and teratogenicity associated with ACE inhibitors.

== Interactions ==
===Dental care===
ACE-inhibitors like lisinopril are considered to be generally safe for people undergoing routine dental care, though the use of lisinopril prior to dental surgery is more controversial, with some dentists recommending discontinuation the morning of the procedure. People may present to dental care suspicious of an infected tooth, but the swelling around the mouth may be due to lisinopril-induced angioedema, prompting emergency and medical referral.

== Pharmacology ==
Lisinopril is the lysine-analog of enalaprilat, the active metabolite of enalapril. Unlike other ACE inhibitors, it is not a prodrug, is not metabolized by the liver, and is excreted unchanged in the urine.

=== Mechanism of action ===
Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor, meaning it blocks the actions of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), preventing angiotensin I from being converted to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent direct vasoconstrictor and a stimulator of aldosterone release. Reduction in the amount of angiotensin II results in relaxation of the arterioles. Reduction in the amount of angiotensin II also reduces the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, which allows the kidney to excrete sodium along with water into the urine and increases the retention of potassium ions. Specifically, this process occurs in the peritubular capillaries of the kidneys in response to a change in Starling forces. The inhibition of the RAAS system causes an overall decrease in blood pressure.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
====Absorption====
Following oral administration of lisinopril, peak serum concentrations of lisinopril occur within about seven hours, although there was a trend to a small delay in time taken to reach peak serum concentrations in acute myocardial infarction patients. The peak effect of lisinopril is about 6 hours after administration for most people. Declining serum concentrations exhibit a prolonged terminal phase, which does not contribute to drug accumulation. This terminal phase probably represents saturable binding to ACE and is not proportional to dose. Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and the absorbed drug is excreted unchanged entirely in the urine. Based on urinary recovery, the mean extent of absorption of lisinopril is approximately 25% (reduced to 16% in people with New York Heart Association Functional Classification (NYHA) Class II–IV heart failure), with large interpatient variability (6 to 60%) at all doses tested (5 to 80 mg). Lisinopril absorption is not affected by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract.

Studies in rats indicate that lisinopril crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly. Multiple doses of lisinopril in rats result in little or no accumulation in brain tissue.

====Distribution====
Lisinopril does not bind to proteins in the blood. It does not distribute as well in people with NYHA Class II–IV heart failure.

====Elimination====
Lisinopril leaves the body completely unchanged in the urine. The half-life of lisinopril is 12 hours, and is increased in people with kidney problems. While the plasma half-life of lisinopril has been estimated between 12 and 13 hours, the elimination half-life is much longer, at around 30 hours. The full duration of action is between 24 and 30 hours.

Lisinopril is the only water-soluble member of the ACE inhibitor class and thus has no metabolism by the liver.

=== Chemistry ===
Pure lisinopril powder is white to off-white in color. Lisinopril is soluble in water (approximately 13 mg/L at room temperature), less soluble in methanol, and virtually insoluble in ethanol.

== History ==
Captopril, the first ACE inhibitor, is a functional and structural analog of a peptide derived from the venom of the jararaca, a Brazilian pit viper (&quot;Bothrops jararaca&quot;). Enalapril is a derivative, designed by scientists at Merck to overcome the rash and bad taste caused by captopril.

Enalapril is actually a prodrug; the active metabolite is enalaprilat.

The di-acid metabolite of enalapril, enalaprilat, and its lysine analogue lisinopril are potent inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE); they do not contain sulphydryl groups. Both drugs can be assayed by high-pressure liquid chromatography and by radioimmunoassay and plasma ACE inhibition remains stable under normal storage conditions. It is therefore possible to study their pharmacokinetics as well as their pharmacodynamic effects in humans. Enalaprilat and lisinopril as well as ACE activity have been measured in blood taken during the course of two studies of the effects of these drugs on blood pressure and autonomic responsiveness.

Lisinopril is a synthetic peptide derivative of captopril. Scientists at Merck created lisinopril by systematically altering each structural unit of enalaprilat, substituting various amino acids. Adding lysine at one end of the drug turned out to have strong activity and adequate bioavailability when given orally; analogs of that compound resulted in lisinopril, which takes its name from the discovery of lysine. Merck conducted clinical trials, and the drug was approved for hypertension in 1987 and congestive heart failure in 1993.

The discovery posed a problem, since sales of enalapril were strong for Merck, and the company did not want to diminish those sales. Merck ended up entering into an agreement with Zeneca under which Zeneca received the right to co-market lisinopril, and Merck received the exclusive rights to an earlier stage aldose reductase inhibitor drug candidate, a potential diabetes treatment. Zeneca&#x27;s marketing and brand name, &quot;Zestril&quot;, turned out to be stronger than Merck&#x27;s effort. The drug became a blockbuster for AstraZeneca (formed in 1998), with annual sales in 1999 of $1.2B.

The US patents expired in 2002. Since then, lisinopril has been available under many brand names worldwide; it is also available in combination drugs with diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (as lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide), and with calcium channel blocker amlodipine (as lisinopril/amlodipine).

== Society and culture ==
=== Legal status ===
In July 2016, an oral solution formulation of lisinopril was approved for use in the United States.

<text>Sophus Christian Frederik Schandorph (or Skamdrup), known simply as Sophus Schandorph, (8 May 1836 – 1 January 1901), Danish poet and novelist, was born at Ringsted in Zealand. He was one of the men of &quot;the Modern Break-through.&quot;

==Biography==
Schandorph was born on 8 May 1836 in Ringsted, the son of Johan Frederik Schandorph (1790–1855) and Andrea Kirstine Møller (1804–73). In 1855 he entered the University of Copenhagen. In 1862 he published his first volume of poetry, written in the romantic style and giving little indication of the ultimate direction that his talent was to take. Other books followed, but his gifts first found full expression in a volume of rustic tales entitled &quot;Fra Provinsen&quot; (1876), in which he described provincial character and life with much frankness of detail and a great deal of wit.

In 1878 his novel, &quot;Uden Midtpunkt&quot; (&quot;Without a Centre&quot;), recast later in dramatic form, attracted great attention by its exposure of contemporary failings. Among the more famous of his later novels are:
*&quot;Thomas Friis&#x27; Historie&quot; (2 vols, 1881)
*&quot;Det gamle Apothek&quot; (&quot;The Old Apothecary&quot;[?]) (1855)
*&quot;Poet og Junker&quot; (1892)
*&quot;Helga&quot; (1900)
But his most characteristic work is to be found in his various volumes of short sketches. He published his own &quot;Recollections&quot; (&quot;Oplevelser&quot;) in 1889. He died after a long illness at Frederiksberg on New Year&#x27;s Day 1901.

Today Schandorph is little read and not regarded a very outstanding man of the ”break-through” but he is however an important key figure as an inspiration of Henrik Pontoppidan and later regionalist and social writers.

<text>The Sea Within are an international rock supergroup founded in 2017, formed by Swedish guitarist and singer-songwriter Roine Stolt, bassist Jonas Reingold and guitarist Daniel Gildenlöw, German drummer Marco Minnemann, and American keyboardist Tom Brislin. Their self-titled debut album was released on 22 June 2018.

==History==
===The beginning===
The band&#x27;s formation was first announced in December 2017. Stolt recalled that the German-based independent record label Inside Out Music first suggested the idea of establishing a new band with strong songwriters. By the time of their announcement, their debut album was nearing completion. The group had gathered in north London to record at Livingston Studios which marked the first time the five had been in the same room together. Stolt realised such a risk would affect the music, but the experience turned into a successful and productive one after almost two hours of music was developed collectively and recorded. Stolt said their direction includes elements of progressive and art rock combined with pop and cinematic music. 

Their self-titled debut album, featuring guest performances from keyboardist Jordan Rudess, singers Jon Anderson and Casey McPherson, and saxophonist Rob Townsend was released on 22 June 2018. The release was followed by their debut live gig at the Night of the Prog XIII festival in Lorelei, Germany, on 14 July 2018 as well as two gigs on the 2019 Cruise To The Edge.

<text>The Amur grayling (Thymallus grubii) is a species of freshwater ray-finned fish from the genus &quot;Thymallus&quot; (graylings) of the family Salmonidae, endemic to the Amur basin in Russian Far East and Northeast China and also the Onon and Kherlen basins in Mongolia. It is sometimes difficult to differentiate the species with the Lower Amur grayling (&quot;Thymallus tugarinae&quot;). It is seen as a game fish and food fish in Russian Far East and the Chinese Heilongjiang province.

==Description==
The body of Amur grayling is usually dark, with its back being slightly purple. There are some small dark spots on the sides of the body. The edge of the dorsal fin is purplish red mixed with some spots. It can reach a maximum length of 31.3 cm.

==Life cycle==
In winter, adult Amur grayling are found in deep parts of mountain streams. While in summer, they are usually found in clear streams flowing slowly with thick aquatic weeds. Most Amur grayling is feed on benthic organisms and insects. They form schools while breeding in clear, fast-flowing streams.

<text>The Sea Inside () is a 2004 Spanish psychological drama film co-written and directed by Alejandro Amenábar, who also co-produced, scored and edited. It is based on the real-life story of Ramón Sampedro (played by Javier Bardem), who was left quadriplegic after a diving accident, and his 28-year campaign in support of euthanasia and the right to end his life. The film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

==Plot==
This is the life story of Spaniard Ramón Sampedro, who fought a 28-year campaign to win the right to end his own life with assisted suicide. The film explores Ramón&#x27;s relationships with two women: Julia, a lawyer suffering from Cadasil syndrome who supports his cause, and Rosa, a local woman who wants to convince him that his life is worth living. Through the gift of his love, these two women are inspired to accomplish things they never previously thought possible.

Ramón, now 54 years old, has been fighting for 26 years for his right to die following a diving incident which left him paralysed from the neck down. He is unable to end his life by himself and does not wish to implicate his family or friends, as by Spanish law, they would be charged with murder or assisting a suicide. Following the death of his mother, he is cared for by his sister-in-law, Manuela. Ramón&#x27;s elder brother José does not believe he should have the right to die; both Manuela and her son, Javier, believe in his case.

Ramón&#x27;s friend Gené, who works for an organization fighting for the right to die, puts him in contact with Julia, a lawyer. As she seeks to learn more about him and his situation in order to fight for his cause, he recounts his past and his reasons for wanting to die: He says that there is no dignity in living paralysed. After seeing his story online, Rosa visits Ramón to convince him to live. He demands that she respect his wishes and she leaves, upset. Later, whilst DJing her part-time radio show, she apologises on air in the hopes that he is listening. She continues to visit, bringing her children, and the two strike up a friendship. Despite romantic interest in both women, Ramón maintains that he is spoken for by death.

Julia reads Ramón&#x27;s memoir describing his life and experiences as a quadriplegic and urges him to publish it. He imagines flying from his bed to visit her on the beach. Later, she is hospitalised with a stroke and admitted to rehab to relearn how to walk. The two write letters to each other, sending updates of their lives. Ramón loses a court case for his right to die. Rosa, in tears, appears at his house and Ramón admits that he has planned a way to commit suicide without the direct and obvious involvement of anyone else.

Meanwhile, Padre Francisco, a quadriplegic Catholic priest, comes to convince Ramón to want to live. Ramón refuses to be carried downstairs and so the two men converse through the help of a church boy, who runs up and down to share their arguments. Angry and upset, Manuela asks him to leave. Julia visits to assist Ramón in writing his memoir whilst his family and friends discuss his right to die. Divided, they fight. But Ramón is unwavering in his wish. Again, he imagines that he is able-bodied, kissing Julia. Later, she admits that her condition will only become more severe and that she is planning to kill herself. But first, she would like to help Ramón.

Ramón and Javier work together to design and build a wheelchair for him in which he can appear in court to fight for his own right to die. His appeal is ultimately rejected, but Ramón eventually fulfils his wish nonetheless. Each of his friends and family complete a small action in his death; not enough to convict any of them of his murder or assisting his suicide. He records himself on a video camera, narrating his own death, before ingesting a cyanide-laced drink that kills him.

<doc id="1267068" wikidata="Q2890312" url="?curid=1267068" title="East Siberian grayling">
<text>The East Siberian grayling &quot;(Thymallus pallasii)&quot; is a grayling in the salmon family Salmonidae.
 Males can reach a size of .

==Distribution==
East Siberian grayling was first described to be found at the Kolyma River basin by Peter Simon Pallas. Its distribution range is still insufficiently understood, and is believed to include most of the rivers flowing to the Arctic coast eastward from the Khatanga River, across the East Siberian Plain, and further east to easternmost Siberia, including the rivers in the Chukotka Peninsula as well as rivers of the Sea of Okhotsk basin, such as the Ola River in the Magadan Oblast and the Kukhtuy in Khabarovsk Krai.

==Description==
&quot;Thymallus&quot; can be distinguished by their elongated, often cylindrical body, greatly enlarged dorsal fin, small mouth and striking dorsal coloration. Adult dorsum color ranges from dark purple to blue/black, and claret red spots are sometimes observed above ventral fins and on the caudal peduncle. Adults can have dark lateral spotting, and the lower caudal lobe is often longer than the upper lobe East-Siberian grayling were first described by Valenciennes (1828) and were described as having a less acute pectoral fin, radiating streaks on the operculum, longer dorsal fin rays, and narrower maxillae than other &quot;Thymallus sp.&quot;. Additionally, &quot;Thymallus sp.&quot; can be distinguished by the extension of the upper jaw beyond the anterior of the eye but not to the midpoint of the eye. &quot;Thymallus sp.&quot; including &quot;T. pallasii&quot; often have plastic phenotypes distinguished by differences in relative length, rows of spots on dorsal fins and caudal peduncle color.

==Reproduction and development==
&quot;Thymallus&quot; spawn polygamously in the spring in rivers and lakes, with males guarding independent territories. Eggs are laid in shallow areas of clear, fast-moving streams with rocky or sandy bottoms, and incubate for between 13 and 18 days before hatching. Adults do not perform any parental care. Juveniles reach sexual maturity at around 2 – 6 years old, and maximum sizes recorded are 515 mm and 488 mm, for females and males, respectively. Grayling live up to 22 years, and are known to have complex local migrations corresponding with the seasons. 

==Behavior, diet and predation==
Adults are visual predators and stay in depths of 110 – 152 cm. Grayling feed primarily on aquatic and terrestrial insects, aquatic insect larvae, fish, small mammals, and crustacean zooplankton, and often require clear streams to feed. East-Siberian grayling predators include humans, as well as pike (&quot;Esox sp.&quot;). 

==Economic importance and conservation status==
While &quot;Thymallus&quot; do not have significant commercial economic importance, they are culturally relevant and are harvested massively by anglers. Additionally, grayling require rocky or sandy bottom streams and well oxygenated water- giving them important potential as an indicator species. &quot;Thymallus&quot; pallasii are considered a species of least concern, and recent genetic work indicates &quot;T. pallasii&quot; may be part of a larger group, &quot;T. arcticus sl.&quot;, composed of &quot;T. mertensii&quot;, &quot;pallasii&quot; and &quot;signifer&quot;.

<doc id="1267076" wikidata="Q17050186" url="?curid=1267076" title="Kaiju Big Battel">
<text>Kaiju Big Battel is a performance by the New York City based performance entertainment troupe created by Rand Borden. The performances are parodies of both professional wrestling and the &quot;tokusatsu&quot; &quot;kaiju&quot; eiga films of Japan. These Battels are presented in the style of professional wrestling events, with the costumed performers playing the roles of giant, city-crushing monsters similar to Godzilla and Gamera. The odd spelling of battel originates in a mistake Borden made on a T-shirt design, which became an inside joke. The performances include many in-jokes aimed towards fans of professional wrestling (especially Mexican wrestling), superhero comic books and Japanese popular culture. Many of the names of the characters are in mock Spanish or mock Japanese, and Engrish is used liberally for comedic effect.

==History of Studio Kaiju==
While a student at School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Rand Borden and peers who grew up watching Ultraman decided to make kaiju suits for a short film. The first character created was Midori no Kaiju (Japanese for &quot;Big Green Monster&quot;), which Borden assembled from upholstery foam coated with latex. After about a year, he finished this first kaiju suit. The other students did not make anything, but Borden enjoyed making the costume decided to make more.

On Halloween night in 1994, the first live competition, or Big Battel, occurred at the Revolving Museum in Boston. The Battel featured Midori No Kaiju, as well as Atomic Cannon, Powa Ranjuru, Force Trooper Robo, Taro &quot;The Mouth&quot; Fuji&#x27;s commentary, and Anthony Salbino&#x27;s construction. The first full-scale Kaiju Big Battel event was held in March 1995 in Boston, Massachusetts at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. The earliest performances in other cities included matches with other troupes of costumed wrestlers at venues such as Fort Thunder in Providence, Rhode Island. Borden has created more than 120 monster costumes, which he keeps in storage.

In 2000, Borden formed Studio Kaiju and hired his brother, David, as manager. &quot;Kaiju Big Battel: Terebi Sento&quot; was the studio&#x27;s first DVD release, showcasing four matches from 2001 and several bonus features. &quot;Kaiju Big Battel: A Practical Guide to Giant City-Crushing Monsters&quot;, a comedic history of the first 8 years of Kaiju Big Battel, was published in 2004 by Hyperion Press.

Studio Kaiju was dissolved in 2011 and Rand Borden returned to producing Kaiju on his own. 

Kaiju Big Battel performed at TwitchCon 2017 in Long Beach, California at an event that was simultaneously broadcast on Twitch. On May 4, 2019 Kaiju Big Battel held their first European event at Alexandra Palace in London, England.

==Notable characters==

*Dusto Bunny is a monstrous anthropomorphic dust bunny. His height is &quot;one billion dust mites&quot;, and he weighs &quot;64 tons (mostly fluff)&quot;.
*French Toast is a giant waffle with a French accent. His nickname is &quot;The Awful Waffle&quot;.
*Kung-Fu Chicken Noodle is a martial artist wielding a cleaver and wearing a can of soup over his torso. He weighs &quot;120 fluid tons&quot;.
*Dr. Cube is the main villain of Kaiju Big Battel. He is a disfigured plastic surgeon who wears a white box over his face to hide his scars. He uses genetic modification and mind-control to command an army of kaiju to destroy mankind and control the earth. His character was created after Rand Borden found a surgical gown and a box.
*American Beetle is an American-born hero &quot;so proud of his Mexican heritage that he only speaks Spanish&quot;
*Referee &quot;You Call that a Knife&quot; Dundee keeps order in the big ring.

==Kickstarter projects==
Studio Kaiju has run two Kickstarter campaigns. The first, 20 Years of Kaiju Big Battel Posters, was launched in June 2016 and was to be a hardcover art book featuring posters from Kaiju shows. The campaign failed to meet its stated goal of $20,000. A second Kickstarter for Kaiju Big Battel figurines was launched in August 2018 and successfully raised $21,396.

==&quot;Kaiju Big Battel: Fighto Fantasy&quot;==
On October 31, 2018 a Kaiju Big Battel video game was released on PC and mobile platforms. The game was developed by Super Walrus Games and is a satire of Final Fantasy style RPGs from the &#x27;90s.

==Political themes==
Story lines for events are inspired by the American political atmosphere at the time. During the time when Obamacare was being legislated, the character of American Beetle switched from a Republican to a Democrat because he needed insurance for surgery. Quotes from American president Donald Trump were sometimes used in speeches made by the main villain, Dr. Cube.

<doc id="1267077" wikidata="Q1508241" url="?curid=1267077" title="George Scharf">
<text>Sir George Scharf KCB (16 December 1820 – 19 April 1895) was a British art critic, illustrator, and director of the National Portrait Gallery.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Scharf was born at 3 St Martin&#x27;s Lane, London, the son of George Johann Scharf, a Bavarian miniature painter, and older brother to Henry Scharf, actor and illustrator. He was educated at University College School, and after studying under his father and obtaining medals from the Society of Arts, entered the schools of the Royal Academy in 1838.

===Travels ===

In 1840 Charles Fellows engaged Scharf to join him on his second journey to Asia Minor and on the way spent some time in Italy. Three years later he again visited Asia Minor in the capacity of draughtsman. He made drawings of views and antiquities from Lycia, Caria, and Lydia, which are now in British Museum. A selection of these illustrations with text by Fellows was published in 1847.

===Career===

After his return to England, Scharf exhibited his paintings of the tombs in Myra and Xanthos at the Royal Academy in 1845 and 1846. He also illustrated books relating to art and antiquity, of which the best known are Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;Lays of Ancient Rome&quot; (1847); Milman&#x27;s &quot;Horace&quot;, (1849); Kugler&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of Italian Painting&quot; (1851); and Dr Smith&#x27;s classical dictionaries. In addition, he produced thirty-seven illustrations for the 1845 illuminated &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; designed by Owen Jones.

He also engaged largely in lecturing and teaching, and took part in the formation of the Greek, Roman and Pompeian courts at the Crystal Palace. He acted as art secretary to the great Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857, and in that year was appointed secretary and director to the newly founded National Portrait Gallery. The remainder of his life was given to the care of that institution.

Scharf acquired an unrivalled knowledge of all matters relating to historic portraiture, and was the author of many learned essays on the subject. In 1885, in recognition of his services to the Portrait Gallery, he was made CB, and on his resignation, early in 1895, KCB and a trustee of the Gallery. He died at his home 8 Ashley Place, London in April 1895 after a long illness.

<doc id="1267081" wikidata="Q412666" url="?curid=1267081" title="Ramipril">
<text>Ramipril, sold under the brand name Altace among others, is an ACE inhibitor type medication used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and diabetic kidney disease. It can also be used as a preventative medication in patients over 55 years old to reduce the risk of having a heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death in patients shown to be at high risk, such as some diabetics and patients with vascular disease. It is a reasonable initial treatment for high blood pressure. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include headaches, dizziness, fatigue, and cough. Serious side effects may include liver problems, angioedema, kidney problems, and high blood potassium. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended. It is an ACE inhibitor and works by decreasing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity.
Ramipril was patented in 1981 and approved for medical use in 1989. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 187th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2million prescriptions.

== Activation and binding ==
Ramipril is a pro-drug. The molecule must be hydrolyzed by an esterase at the and form a carboxylate. This carboxylate then interacts with the positive Zn2+ ion which is located at the active site of the ACE enzyme. Ramipril is similar in structure to another ACE Inhibitor, trandolapril, but it has a second cyclopentane ring instead of a cyclohexane ring.

==Medical uses==
Medical uses include:
* High blood pressure (Hypertension)
* Congestive heart failure
* Following heart attack in people with evidence of heart failure
* People over 55 years at high risk: prevention of heart attack, stroke, cardiovascular death, or in need of revascularization procedures
* Prevent the onset and/or delay the progression of diabetic kidney disease, with or without proteinuria. Randomized trial evidence suggests that a maximum tolerable dose prevents cardiovascular events and death in patients with diabetic kidney disease.

==Contraindications==
Contraindications to its use include volume-depleted patients, a history of angioedema while on an ACE inhibitor, pregnancy and hypotension.

People should not take ramipril (or any ACE inhibitors) if they have hyperkalemia. It is also recommended to avoid using salt-substitutes as this can further increase potassium levels in the blood.

Ramipril can be considered in patients with bilateral or unilateral significant renal artery stenosis (RAS). An early rise in serum creatinine above baseline is expected after initiation of therapy with Ramipril, however, monitoring serum biochemistry and renal function after initiation is crucial. Treatment with Ramipril in some patients with significant narrowing in both kidneys can increase serum creatinine concentration (measured in the blood test), which returns to baseline upon therapy cessation.

==Adverse effects==
* Shakiness
* Dry cough
* Dizziness and lightheadedness due to low blood pressure
* Fatigue, especially in the early stages
* Mouth dryness in the early stages
* Nausea
* Fainting
* Signs of infection (e.g., fever, chills, persistent sore throat)
* Chest pain
* Neutropenia (low white blood cells)
* Impotence (erectile dysfunction)
* Hyperkalemia

Serious allergic reactions to this drug are unlikely, but immediate medical attention must be sought if they occur. Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction include, but are not limited to a rash or swelling of the face, mouth, tongue, or throat. In extreme cases, ramipril may lead to potentially fatal liver problems.

==Mechanism of action==

ACE inhibitors inhibit the actions of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), thereby lowering the production of angiotensin II and decreasing the breakdown of bradykinin. The decrease in angiotensin II results in relaxation of arteriole smooth muscle leading to a decrease in total peripheral resistance, reducing blood pressure as the blood is pumped through widened vessels. Its effect on bradykinin is responsible for the dry cough side effect.

Ramipril, a prodrug or precursor drug, is converted to the active metabolite ramiprilat by carboxylesterase 1. Ramiprilat is mostly excreted by the kidneys. Its half-life is variable (3–16 hours), and is prolonged by heart and liver failure, as well as kidney failure. Peak effect occurs between 3 and 6 hours after dosing, with approximately 50% of this effect retained after 24 hours.

==Synthesis==
The penultimate step in the synthesis of ramipril combines an alanine derivative with a (&quot;S,S,S&quot;)-2-azabicyclo-[3.3.0]-octane-3-carboxylic acid protected as its benzyl ester. In the original patented route, these components were obtained by a multi-step process.
The acid chloride forms an amide bond with the amino group of the pyrrolidine ring in the presence of triethylamine and ramipril is the product after the benzyl ester has been removed by hydrogenation.

==Society and culture==
===US patent===
The compound was protected by a patent which was assigned to the German pharmaceutical company Hoechst AG (since merged into Aventis) on 29 October 1991. The patent was scheduled to expire on 29 October 2008. On 11 September 2007, in an appeal by the Indian company Lupin Ltd., the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed a district court trial verdict and found that Aventis&#x27;s patent on ramipril was invalid for &quot;obviousness&quot;, opening this drug to generic manufacturers.

===Brand names===
Ramipril is marketed as Prilace by Arrow Pharmaceuticals in Australia, Ramipro by Westfield Pharma in the Philippines, Triatec by Sanofi-Aventis in Italy and United States and Altace by King Pharmaceuticals in the United States, Novapril by Pharmanova in Ghana, Ramitens by PharmaSwiss, Ampril by Krka in Slovenia, Corpril by Cemelog-BRS in Hungary, Piramil and Prilinda by Hemofarm in Serbia, by Lek in Poland and by Novartis and Opsonin Pharma Limited as Ramace in Bangladesh, and in Canada as Altace (Sanofi-Aventis) and Ramipril (Pharmascience).

Ramipril is marketed in India under the brand names Cardace, Zigpril, Ramistar, Odipril and Zorem . Ramipril is marketed in Myanmar under brand name Endpril .

==Research==
The 2001 Heart Outcomes and Prevention Evaluation trial seemed to show ramipril possessed cardioprotective qualities which extended beyond its qualities as an antihypertensive. However, the trial and the interpretation of its results have been criticised.

The Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy (AIRE) trial showed a 27% reduction in mortality for patients receiving ramipril for chronic heart failure following a myocardial infarction.

Ramipril was found to have similar results as telmisartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker.

<doc id="1267092" wikidata="Q62805" url="?curid=1267092" title="Leopold Schefer">
<text>Leopold Schefer (30 July 1784 in Muskau – 13 February 1862 in Muskau), German poet, novelist, and composer, was born in a small town in Upper Lusatia (then under Saxon rule), the only child of a poor country doctor.

==Biography==
Leopold Schefer was educated, privately, by his parents, later on by the principal of the Muskau primary school, &quot;Andreas Tamm&quot;, afterwards in a small private school of the former hofmeister of the local Earl of Callenberg, &quot;Johann Justus Röhde&quot;. From 1799 up to 1805 he attended the secondary school (“Gymnasium”) at Bautzen. During this time he started writing diaries, poems, and compositions, the last under the influence of his teacher &quot;Johann Samuel Petri&quot;. After that he returned to Muskau, helping his widowed mother, while writing and composing.

During Napoleon&#x27;s failed campaign in Russia in 1812, Schefer was appointed manager of the big estates of his newly-won friend, Prince Hermann von Pückler-Muskau, doing well under hard circumstances until 1816. The prince, recognizing the literary abilities of his friend, encouraged his early poetical efforts. Having visited England together with Pückler for studying landscape gardens (and being deeply impressed by Eliza O&#x27;Neill on the stage), Schefer studied composition under Antonio Salieri in Vienna from 1816–17, and travelled to Italy, Greece, Egypt, Palestine, and Turkey. Schefer returned in 1819 to Muskau, where he remained for all his life, married, fathering one son and four daughters, due to his literary success in easy - after the lost German revolution 1848/49 in poor - circumstances, following his literary pursuits until his death in 1862.

==Works==
Schefer wrote a large number of novels, short novels, and narratives which appeared mostly in literary almanacs. Some of his novels have been published in English, as e.g. &quot;Künstlerehe&quot; (1828, with deep insights into married life).

Schefer was well known for his novels and their observative power, but even more for a single volume of poems, &quot;Laienbrevier&quot; (1834–1835). These, owing to their warmth of feeling, keen psychology, and descriptions of the beauties of nature, at once established his fame as a poet. This vein he followed in later years with the poems &quot;Vigilien&quot; (1843), &quot;Der Weltpriester&quot; (1846), and &quot;Hausreden&quot; (1869). Encouraged by his friend, the poet Max Waldau (1822–1855), he published &quot;Hafis in Hellas&quot; (Hamburg, 1853) and &quot;Koran der Liebe&quot; (Hamburg, 1855) containing with their glowing descriptions of the East love poetry of a realistic and high order. But, due to his pantheistic beliefs, his poetry and novels were barred from the curricula of the Prussian elementary and secondary schools, which resulted in his being forgotten after 1910.

On the occasion of Schefer&#x27;s 222nd birthday on July 30, 2006, a whole day was devoted to several of Bad Muskau&#x27;s events as part of the Lusatian Music Summer, above all to his compositional oeuvre.

<text>The Johannes Kepler University Linz (German: &quot;Johannes Kepler Universität Linz&quot;, short: &quot;JKU&quot;) is a public university in Austria. It is located in Linz, the capital of Upper Austria. It offers bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, diploma and doctoral degrees in business, engineering, law, science, social sciences and medicine.

Today, about 24,000 students study at the park campus in the northeast of Linz, with one out of nine students being from abroad. The university was the first in Austria to introduce an electronic student ID in 1998.

The university is the home of the Johann Radon Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematics (RICAM) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.

== History ==
The JKU was established as the &quot;College of Social Sciences, Economics and Business&quot; (&quot;Hochschule für Sozial- und Wirtschaftswissenschaften&quot;) in 1966. The Faculty of Sciences and Engineering was established three years later and in 1975, the college was awarded university status and the Faculty of Law was integrated on campus. The university was named in honor of astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) who wrote his magnum opus &quot;harmonices mundi&quot; (&quot;The Harmony of the world&quot;) in Linz during the early 17th century and taught mathematics at a school for the landed gentry (&quot;Adelichen Landt-Schuelen&quot;) near Linz. At present, the campus added the &quot;JKU Science Park&quot;, additional buildings for science and engineering institutes. In 2019 many new buildings are being built.

== Campus ==
JKU&#x27;s campus is located in the northeast of Linz, in the &quot;Auhof&quot; area of the &quot;St. Magdalena&quot; district. The university buildings are placed in a 90-acre (364,000 m2) park centered around a pond.

=== Infrastructure ===
The campus is accessible by the Linz tram lines &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; and the express bus line &quot;77&quot;. On weekdays, trams travel every 5 minutes and a trip to the city center (&quot;Hauptplatz&quot;) takes approximately 16 minutes.

The JKU is also located close to Austria&#x27;s autobahn network at the &quot;Dornach&quot; exit on the &quot;A7 Mühlkreisautobahn&quot; (ca. 1 km or 0.6 miles). In anticipation of extending the campus, an additional autobahn exit, &quot;Auhof&quot;, is currently in the construction stages and is expected to better facilitate traffic, allowing a more direct route to the university.

A bicycle path in the north-east corner of the town located along the north side of the Danube river provides direct access to the university and helps to reduce traffic in the area.

=== Housing ===
Many larger dormitories are within walking distance of the university, such as the &quot;Julius Raab Heim&quot;, the &quot;WIST Haus&quot;, the &quot;Kepler Heim&quot;, the &quot;ESH&quot; and the &quot;KHG Heim&quot;. Several other dormitories are located in different parts of Linz, providing housing for more than 3,100 students in all of Linz.

Some of the dormitories become hotels during the summer holidays, most notably the &quot;Julius Raab Heim&quot; under the name &quot;Hotel Sommerhaus&quot;.

=== Management ===
The vice-chancellor and the Academic Senate are responsible for the university&#x27;s management. There are several pro-vice-chancellors who are each assigned to specific task areas and who assist the vice-chancellor. The university board is an independent body that advises and counsels the vice-chancellor and the Academic Senate on management issues. Deans and faculty committees are responsible for management on a faculty level. Vice-chancellor and deans are elected for a 4-year period whereas faculty committees are elected for a 2-year period.

=== Faculties and Degree Programs===
The Johannes Kepler University has four faculties with a total of 127 institutes.

==== Faculty of Social Sciences, Economics and Business (SoWi) ====
The Faculty of Social Sciences, Economics and Business is the oldest and largest faculty in terms of students and graduates. The faculty consists of 32 institutes and offers academic degrees e.g. in Economics and Business Administration, Business Informatics, Business and Education, Social Economics, Sociology and Statistics.

The faculty&#x27;s abbreviation &quot;SoWi&quot; is derived from the German name of the faculty, &quot;Sozial- und Wirtschaftswissenschaftliche Fakultät&quot;.

==== Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences (TN) ====
The Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences was established in 1969 and initially offered degrees e.g. in Technical Mathematics, Computer Science and Technical Physics. Over time, degrees in Technical Chemistry, Mechatronics and Information Electronics were introduced.

Several master&#x27;s degrees to specialize in the area of computer science, mathematics and physics, such as pervasive computing, industrial mathematics or biophysics are available. Doctorate degrees are offered in the areas of natural science and technical science.

The TN faculty consists of 51 distinctive institutes and the German name is &quot;Technisch-Naturwissenschaftliche Fakultät&quot;, hence the abbreviation &quot;TN&quot; or &quot;TNF&quot;.

==== Faculty of Law (RE) ====
The Faculty of Law was officially established in 1975. Before that time period, law degrees were offered by the &quot;SoWi&quot; faculty, which was then the&quot;Faculty of Social Sciences, Economics, Business and Law&quot;. In addition to Diploma and doctorate degrees in law, the RE faculty offers a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in Business Law in cooperation with the &quot;SoWi&quot; faculty. Law degrees are also offered via multimedia distance learning.

The abbreviation &quot;RE&quot; is derived from the first two letters of the faculty&#x27;s name German name, &quot;Rechtswissenschaftliche Fakultät.&quot; At present, the RE faculty consists of 20 institutes.

==== Faculty of Medicine (MED) ====
The Faculty of Medicine was founded in 2014. A new MED-Campus is being built.

==== Interdisciplinary programs ====
The Leading Innovative Organizations program is a one-year master&#x27;s program offered jointly by the institute for organization, the institute for leadershing and change management and the institute of innovative management. It aims to offer its students the skills required to establish, lead, and manage a successful, innovative, and sustainable organization.

The master&#x27;s degree program in web sciences is divided into branches of study:
social web, web art &amp; design, web business &amp; economy, web engineering as well as
web and the law. It offers those with academic background in various fields a research-led expansion and in-depth look at fields relevant to the web such as technology, business, law, society, art and culture.

==== Distance learning ====
The JKU maintains several distance learning centers in Austria that offer degrees and courses at the German FernUniversität Hagen, the British Open University and JKU&#x27;s own distance law degree program.

<doc id="1267094" wikidata="Q2892971" url="?curid=1267094" title="Beatlemania (musical)">
<text>Beatlemania was a Broadway musical revue focused on the music of the Beatles as it related to the events and changing attitudes of the tumultuous 1960s. A &quot;rockumentary,&quot; advertised as &quot;&quot;Not the Beatles, but an incredible simulation&quot;,&quot; it ran from May 1977 to October 1979 for a total of 1,006 performances.

== Synopsis ==
&quot;Beatlemania&quot; took the form of a roughly chronological history of the Beatles via their music. A total of 29 songs were performed during the show. Other than some unscripted onstage banter, there was very little dialogue during the production, which consisted mostly of exact re-enactments of the Beatles&#x27; music. The ground-breaking multimedia production was notable for its extensive use of backdrops, projected images on multiple screens, film, newspaper headlines, and video footage to evoke the 1960s and iconic Beatle moments.

== Productions ==
Originally conceived and produced by Steve Leber and David Krebs, &quot;Beatlemania&quot; debuted in Boston at the Colonial Theatre in April 1977. It premiered on Broadway at the Winter Garden Theatre on May 31, 1977 (after previewing since May 26 — although no critics were invited), with cast members Joe Pecorino (rhythm guitar, John), Mitch Weissman (bass guitar, Paul), Les Fradkin (lead guitar, George), and Justin McNeill (drums, Ringo) along with an alternating cast: Randy Clark &quot;John&quot;, Reed Kailing &quot;Paul&quot;, P.M. Howard &quot;George&quot;, and Bobby Taylor &quot;Ringo.&quot;

Quickly achieving sellout status without ever having an official &quot;opening night&quot;, &quot;Beatlemania&quot; saw great success and coverage in &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;People&quot;, &quot;Us&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. For the first six months, every ticket for the show was sold out.

The production was nominated for the 1978 Tony Award for Best Lighting Design by designer Jules Fisher. Sound design by Abe Jacob.

The Broadway show ran until October 17, 1979, for a total of 1006 performances; grossing more than $40 million. During its New York run, the show moved to the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre and finally the Palace Theatre.

As the show expanded, over 50 cast members formed 10 &quot;bunks&quot; (or casts of a single set of four). As the New York show continued its run, shows were opened in Los Angeles, Chicago, Cincinnati, and London. At its peak, &quot;Beatlemania&quot; had limited-engagements in many more cities in the U.S. and abroad.

After closing on Broadway, the &quot;Beatlemania Bus and Truck Tour&quot; began, running until 1983 and touring across the United States and worldwide. Short-term tours of Australia, Europe, Asia, and Africa were produced after 1982.

A 1986 decision in a lawsuit by the Beatles production company Apple Corps officially ended the show for a period of time, but subsequent revival tours were still produced under such titles as &quot;Beatlemania: Yesterday and Today&quot; and &quot;Beatlemania Now&quot;.

== &quot;Beatlemania: The Album&quot; ==
In 1978, &quot;Beatlemania&quot; released a self-titled original cast album of the show which included contributions from the first and second cast of performers from the show (as well as five additional off-stage musicians — keyboards; violin; cello; sax/flute/recorder; trumpet/piccolo trumpet and oboe). Released on Arista Records in 1978, the album received warm audience reaction, even placing on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for several weeks, before falling into obscurity.

Tracks from the album included most but not all of the original show&#x27;s song list, and several of the tracks were either re-recorded entirely or partially re-recorded in the studio. Original cast members that appear on the album include Mitch Weissman, Joe Pecorino, Les Fradkin, Justin McNeill, Randy Clark, Reed Kailing, P. M. Howard, and Bobby Taylor.

== &quot;Beatlemania: The Movie&quot; ==
After three years of production USA Video Productions took an interest in making a film version of the &quot;Beatlemania&quot; stage show. After a brief contract negotiation, &quot;Beatlemania: The Movie&quot; began production in late 1980 (shortly before the murder of John Lennon). Directed by Joseph Manduke, the film&#x27;s cast featured Mitch Weissman (bass guitar; &quot;Paul&quot;), David Leon (rhythm guitar; &quot;John&quot;), Tom Teeley (lead guitar; &quot;George&quot;), and Ralph Castelli (drums; &quot;Ringo&quot;).

&quot;Beatlemania: The Movie&quot; was released in the summer of 1981 and received negative reviews. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;&quot;Beatlemania&quot; was a horror on the stage, and it&#x27;s even more of a horror at close range, where the seams really show. This isn&#x27;t a loving impersonation, or even an honest one. It&#x27;s cheap, disingenuous and loathsome.&quot; Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; wrote, &quot;My idea of hell is being forced at gunpoint to resee this ... atrocity, ... based on a terrible stage musical.&quot; Other observers criticized the film for being too artsy and not worthy of being associated with the stageshow; plans for a follow-up film were immediately cancelled.

== Apple Corps lawsuit==
In 1979, Apple Corps sued show creator Steve Leber and &quot;Beatlemania&quot;&#x27;s producers, alleging that Apple Corps owned various publicity rights and trademarks, and Leber and others &quot;appropriated to themselves&quot; the value of those trademarks and the Beatles&#x27; goodwill and fame without paying for it. In 1986, Los Angeles Superior Court judge Paul Breckenridge found in favor of Apple Corps, and ordered Leber and Beatlemania Inc. to pay Apple $5.6 million, plus 7% interest from September 1979. He also found that Apple was entitled to a court order barring the further unconsented use or exploitation of the Beatles, and that Beatlemania&#x27;s actions &quot;amounted to virtually a complete appropriation of the Beatles&#x27; persona&quot; without their consent.
The judge also found that Ely Landau and the This Is The Week That Was Beatlemania Company, which produced the &quot;Beatlemania&quot; film, were liable $2 million and 7% interest, also payable to Apple Corps.

==Music==

The musical numbers in the show (all written by Lennon–McCartney), based on the Broadway opening, were:

;Act 1
*&quot;I Wanna Hold Your Hand&quot;
*&quot;She Loves You&quot;
*&quot;Help!&quot;
*&quot;If I Fell&quot;
*&quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;
*&quot;Day Tripper&quot;
*&quot;Yesterday&quot;
*&quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;
*&quot;We Can Work It Out&quot;
*&quot;Nowhere Man&quot;
*&quot;A Day in the Life&quot;
*&quot;Penny Lane&quot;
*&quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;
*&quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;
*&quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;
;Act 2
*&quot;Lady Madonna&quot;
*&quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot;
*&quot;Got to Get You into My Life&quot;
*&quot;Michelle&quot;
*&quot;Get Back&quot;
*&quot;Come Together&quot;
*&quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;
*&quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;
*&quot;Revolution&quot;
*&quot;Helter Skelter&quot;
*&quot;Hey Jude&quot;
*&quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;
*&quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;
*&quot;Let It Be&quot;
== Cast members ==

Because of the vocal strain (especially for &quot;Paul&quot;) involved in doing 8 or more shows per week, each production utilized two casts or &quot;Bunks,&quot; as they were dubbed by musical director Sandy Yaguda (after they had dubbed him &quot;Camp Counselor&quot;). The Original Broadway production featured Bunk 1: Mitch Weissman, Joe Pecorino, Les Fradkin and Justin McNeill. and Bunk 2: Randy Clark, Reed Kailing, P.M. Howard, and Bobby Taylor. Subsequent cast members were added as the show expanded with several touring casts. Casts and casting became independent after 1984 as revival and current casts tour under many different Beatle-related nomenclatures. (It is common practice for other Beatles tribute bands to promote themselves falsely as &quot;Original Broadway Cast&quot;.)

<doc id="1267101" wikidata="Q1899220" url="?curid=1267101" title="Scancode">
<text>A scancode (or scan code) is the data that most computer keyboards send to a computer to report which keys have been pressed. A number, or sequence of numbers, is assigned to each key on the keyboard.

== Variants ==

Mapping key positions by row and column requires less complex computer hardware; therefore, in the past, using software or firmware to translate the scancodes to text characters was less expensive than wiring the keyboard by text character. This cost difference is not as profound as it used to be. However, many types of computers still use their traditional scancodes to maintain backward compatibility.

Some keyboard standards include a scancode for each key being pressed and a different one for each key being released. In addition, many keyboard standards (for example, IBM PC compatible standards) allow the keyboard itself to generate &quot;typematic&quot; repeating keys by having the keyboard itself generate the pressed-key scancode repeatedly while the key is held down, with the release scancode sent once when the key is released.

== Scancode sets ==

On some operating systems one may discover a key&#x27;s downpress scancode by holding the key down while the computer is booting. With luck, the scancode (or some part of it) will be specified in the resulting &quot;stuck key&quot; error message. [Note: On Windows 7 only one byte of the scancode appears.]

=== PC compatibles ===

Scancodes on IBM PC compatible computer keyboards are sets of 1 to 3 bytes which are sent by the keyboard. Most character keys have a single byte scancode; keys that perform special functions have 2-byte or 3-byte scancodes, usually beginning with the byte (in hexadecimal) codice_1, codice_2, or codice_3. In addition, a few keys send longer scancodes, effectively emulating a series of keys to make it easier for different types of software to process.

PC keyboards since the PS/2 keyboard support up to three scancode sets. The most commonly encountered are the &quot;XT&quot; (&quot;set 1&quot;) scancodes, based on the 83-key keyboard used by the IBM PC XT and earlier. These mostly consist of a single byte; the low 7 bits identify the key, and the most significant bit is clear for a key press or set for a key release. Some additional keys have an codice_1 (or rarely, codice_2 or codice_3) prefix. These were initially assigned so that ignoring the codice_1 prefix (which is in the key-up range and thus would have no effect on an operating system that did not understand them) would produce reasonable results. For example the numeric keypad&#x27;s Enter key produces a scancode of codice_8, which corresponds to the Return key&#x27;s scancode of codice_9.

The IBM 3270 PC introduced its own set of scancodes (&quot;set 3&quot;), with a different key numbering and where a key release is indicated by an codice_10 prefix. For backward compatibility, the 3270 PC translated these to XT (set 1) scancodes using an add-on card and a BIOS extension. This set is used by Linux by default when it detects a PS/2 keyboard that can properly support scan code set 3.

The IBM PC AT introduced the &quot;AT&quot; (&quot;set 2&quot;) scancodes. On the 84-key AT keyboard these were largely a subset of set 3, with some differences caused by the revised layout (for example, the position and scancodes of the function keys changed). Keys added since the PC AT often have different scancodes in set 2 and set 3, and in set 2 frequently have an codice_1 or codice_2 prefix. Again, key release is indicated by an codice_10 prefix.

For computers since the IBM PC AT, the keyboard controller on the motherboard translates AT (set 2) scancodes into XT (set 1) scancodes in so called &quot;translation mode&quot;. This translation can be disabled in &quot;pass-through-mode&quot;, allowing the raw scancodes to be seen. Therefore, whether a software developer will encounter AT scancodes or XT scancodes on a modern PC-compatible depends on how the keyboard is being accessed.

A compliant PS/2 keyboard can be told to send scancodes in set 1, 2 or 3.

=== USB ===
USB keyboards use a new set of scancodes, mostly specified in the USB standard. All computers that recognize USB keyboards recognize these new scancodes.

<text>The Albanian Football Federation (; FSHF) is the governing body of football in Albania. Headquartered in Tirana, it organizes the national football leagues of Kategoria Superiore, Kategoria e Parë, Kategoria e Dytë, Kategoria e Tretë, Albanian Cup, Supercup, Kategoria Superiore Femra and the Albanian Women&#x27;s Cup. The federation also coordinates and oversees the activities of the Albania national football team, Albania women&#x27;s national football team and the Albania national youth football teams such as Under-21, Under-20, Under-19, Under-18, Under-17, Under-16 and Under-15.

==History==
On June 6, 1930, the government of King Zog I issued a royal decree recognizing the establishment of the Albanian Sports Federation. The newly formed sports entity would join the world governing body, FIFA, during the June Congress of 1932, officially marking Albania’s participation in international football. A revised order was issued in March of 1934, to dissolve the Federation, transferring its authority to the heads of the national entity &quot;Vllaznija Shqiptare&quot; (est.1928), which was in charge of various sports activities at the time. The federation was one of the founding members of UEFA in 1954.
On 14 March 2008, FSHF were suspended by FIFA for &quot;heavy political interference.&quot; This meant that their national teams were banned from playing official matches, representatives banned from official events, and referees unable to officiate FIFA-sanctioned matches. The ban was subsequently lifted as the political interferences were clarified, and on 27 May 2008, Albania played a friendly against Poland.

The current president of FSHF, Armand Duka, has been at this position since 2002 and won the elections for a third term in 2010.

During the 2009 controversy between FSHF and the Albanian government as to the property of the Qemal Stafa Stadium. UEFA insisted in lobbying that the stadium be given to FSHF ownership so that investments on it can be made. In February 2011 it was decided that the new stadium, which will replace the current one and will cost 60M Euro, will be 75% of FSHF and 25% of the Albanian government.

<doc id="1267105" wikidata="Q444775" url="?curid=1267105" title="Saint Nicolas (Britten)">
<text>Saint Nicolas, Op. 42, is a cantata with music by Benjamin Britten on a text by Eric Crozier, completed in 1948. It covers the legendary life of Saint Nicholas, Bishop of Myra, Lycia, in a dramatic sequence of events. The composer wrote the work for the centenary of Lancing College in Sussex, with the resources of the institution in mind. It is scored for mixed choir, tenor soloist, four boy singers, strings, piano duet, organ and percussion. The only professionals required are the tenor soloist, a quintet of string players to lead the other strings, and the first percussionist. &quot;Saint Nicolas&quot; is Britten&#x27;s first work for amateur musicians, and it includes congregational hymns. The premiere was the opening concert of the first Aldeburgh Festival in June 1948, with Peter Pears as the soloist.

== History ==
Benjamin Britten wrote the cantata &quot;Saint Nicolas&quot;, Op. 42, from December 1947 to May 1948 for the centennial celebrations of Lancing College in Sussex. Writing for the resources available, Britten scored the piece for mixed choir, tenor soloist, four boys, strings, piano duet, organ and percussion. The only professional musicians required are the tenor soloist, five string section principals to lead the other strings, and the first percussionist. &quot;Saint Nicolas&quot; marks Britten&#x27;s first professional work intended primarily for performance by amateur musicians: it is now frequently performed by youth and amateur ensembles. The duration is given as 50 minutes. While the piece was written for Lancing College, the first performance was actually, with the college&#x27;s permission, the opening concert of the first Aldeburgh Festival on 5 June 1948, when it was performed in Aldeburgh Church. Britten&#x27;s dedication reads: &quot;This Cantata was written for performance at the centenary celebrations of Lancing College, Sussex, on 24 July 1948&quot;.

The text of &quot;Saint Nicolas&quot; was written by Eric Crozier after extensive research into the legendary life of Saint Nicholas, Bishop of Myra, Lycia. Crozier&#x27;s libretto paints a dramatically bold portrait of the saint&#x27;s character, exaggerating the legends and glory that have accumulated over the centuries around Nicholas&#x27;s story. Britten&#x27;s music enhances the drama of Crozier&#x27;s text using striking contrasts in instrumentation, vocal style, and musical textures.

The Thames Television production, with Ian Partridge singing the title role, won the 1977 Prix Italia.

== Overview ==

=== I. Introduction ===
&quot;Saint Nicolas&quot; opens with an introduction in which the mixed choir, representing a contemporary people, calls to Nicolas to speak to them across the ages. They sing, &quot;Our eyes are blinded by the holiness you bear&quot;, and they wish to hear the true story of Nicolas, the man. After being implored to &quot;Strip off [his] glory&quot;, Nicolas responds in a flourish, speaking to the choir, &quot;Across the tremendous bridge of sixteen hundred years…” The first movement ends with a choral prayer.

The choral introduction is centred on the pitch class E, prominent as a pedal tone for much of the first movement. Harmonic tension is achieved by brief chromatic meanderings that return to the central pitch; this technique is effective by providing harmonic and melodic interest while remaining accessible to young and/or amateur singers. Nicolas&#x27; response to the chorus departs from the emphasis on E, travelling through many different keys, though generally using diatonic melodies. Nicolas ends his solo on pitch class A, which becomes the new pedal tone for the choral prayer.

=== II. The Birth of Nicolas ===

The second movement begins the depiction of Nicolas&#x27; life, recounting the story of his miraculous birth, when “…from his mother&#x27;s womb he sprang and cried, &#x27;GOD BE GLORIFIED!’” Stories of his childhood continue, punctuated by the refrain &quot;GOD BE GLORIFIED!”, sung by the boy Nicolas (portrayed by the &#x27;youngest boy in the choir&#x27;, as specified by the composer.) At the end of the movement, the boy becomes a man, and the movement closes with the full-voiced adult tenor singing the refrain.

This movement consists of a tune written in the A-Lydian mode. Britten modulated between A-Lydian and E-Lydian for alternating verses; he did so by altering the Lydian modes into whole-tone-collections, raising the fourth scale degree (as is customary for Lydian) but also raising the fifth scale degree to travel from one mode to the other. The harmonies supporting the modal melodies are tonal and fairly straightforward. At the moment that Nicolas becomes a man, Britten colours the melody&#x27;s supporting harmonies in a much more dissonant manner, using a semitone clash to darken the simple refrain.

=== III. Nicolas Devotes Himself to God ===

The third movement is sung by Nicolas alone, who recounts how &quot;My parents died … All too soon I left the tranquil beauty of their home … and knew the wider world of men&quot;. Nicolas then bemoans his distress over man&#x27;s faults and devotes himself to a life of service to God.

Britten orchestrated the second movement for just strings and tenors; the texture is much less complicated than the preceding movements. The third movement lacks a tonal center and meanders through significantly more dissonant harmonies; the absence of a catchy, recognisable tune (found in most other movements) makes the third movement come across as a recitative.

=== IV. He Journeys to Palestine ===
The fourth movement of the cantata depicts a sea voyage bringing Nicolas to Palestine. During this voyage, a mighty storm assails the ship, perhaps as punishment to the faithless sailors who have mocked the pious saint. The storm is terrifying, and the sailors despair. Amidst the violent winds, waves, and rain, Nicolas gathers the sailors in prayer, and the storm subsides.

The movement opens with an energetic modal melody centred on F; the melody alternates between the Aeolian, or natural minor mode, and Dorian, with its raised sixth. Britten even raises the fourth occasionally, hinting at Lydian. The interplay between modes in this melody contributes to its lilting character. The tune becomes more dissonant as the storm approaches, and when the storm arrives, the men&#x27;s song is halted. The female chorus, singing from the galleries, represents the winds and tempests; the girls&#x27; voices describe the terrifying storm, pausing only for the sailors&#x27; cries for mercy. As the storm subsides, Nicolas emerges; his prayer is musically and textually simple. The movement ends with a return of the initial tune, this time in F major with very slight alteration.

=== V. Nicolas Comes to Myra and is Chosen Bishop ===
In the fifth movement, Nicolas is appointed Bishop of Myra. The chorus calls upon him to &quot;Serve the faith and spurn its enemies&quot;. Nicolas vows to do just that, and the movement closes with a congregational hymn.

This movement is the most traditionally tonal of the entire cantata; D major is strongly established in the chorus&#x27; homophonic texture. Halfway through the movement, Britten employs a diatonic fugato that concludes in G major. In this key, the congregation joins in the singing of the hymn known as Old Hundredth, which misses out verses 2 and 5 and begins with the words &quot;All people that on earth do dwell&quot; The semichorus sings an upliftingly beautiful descant in Verse 2, rising up to a top B on the word &quot;it&quot; in &quot;For &quot;it&quot; is seemly so to do&quot;.

=== VI. Nicolas from Prison ===
Like the third movement, the sixth recalls an operatic recitative. Here Nicolas admonishes mankind for accepting its wilderness, calling them to turn to God. While the strings and piano accompaniment are generally centred on a D minor chord, the vocal melody is highly chromatic and dissonant.

=== VII. Nicolas and the Pickled Boys ===
The seventh movement of Saint Nicolas depicts the legend of the Pickled Boys. Nicolas finds himself in an inn where a group of travellers have paused for the night. They invite the bishop to dine with them, but Nicolas stops them from eating, realising that the meat that they eat is in fact the flesh of three boys murdered and pickled by the butcher. Nicolas calls to the boys, &quot;Timothy, Mark, and John, put your fleshly garments on!” and the boys come back to life, singing &quot;Alleluia!&quot;

Like the second and fourth movements, the seventh employs a diatonic mode (here it is B-Aeolian) and a memorable tune sung by the chorus. The female chorus, again singing from the galleries, employ Phrygian and Aeolian modes as they sing the roles of mothers seeking their missing sons. When Nicolas enters the scene, he begins with a melody based on F#-Mixolydian, with occasional chromatic alterations. He ends his call to the dead boys in A major, and the movement concludes with a triumphant repeat of the opening motif in B major.

=== VIII. His Piety and Marvellous Works ===
This movement is a choral song of praise to Nicolas, briefly recounting several different stories of his mercy, charity, and kindness. Most of this movement is written homophonically, with a brief canonic section towards the end. This movement is strongly tonal, in G major.

=== IX. The Death of Nicolas ===
In the final movement of the cantata, Nicolas speaks to his impending death with joy, eagerness, and acceptance. He sings, &quot;Lord, I come to life, to final birth ...&quot; using a highly chromatic melody characteristic of the tenor&#x27;s solo section. Simultaneously, the chorus chants the Nunc dimittis using the Gregorian &quot;fourth tone&quot; (on which the music of the orchestral introduction is also based). They conclude the chant as Nicolas concludes with the text, &quot;I bless Thy name, who lived and died for me, and dying, dying, dying, dying, yield my soul to Thee.&quot; After an energetic instrumental interlude (again based on the plainchant), the cantata closes with a congregational hymn praising God&#x27;s mysteries and the courage of the saints. The hymn tune of &quot;God Moves in a Mysterious Way&quot; is known as the &quot;London New&quot;.

<text>Heinrich Julian Schmidt (March 7, 1818 – March 27, 1886) was a German journalist and historian of literature.

==Biography==
He was born in Marienwerder (today Kwidzyn) in West Prussia.
After studying history and philosophy at the University of Königsberg, he was appointed in 1842 to a mastership in the Luisenstadt Realschule in Berlin.
From 1848 to 1861, he owned and edited &quot;Die Grenzboten&quot; conjointly with Gustav Freytag.

In 1861, he moved to Berlin where he was editor-in-chief of the &quot;Berliner allgemeine Zeitung&quot;, and after that dedicated himself to literary history. In 1878 was rewarded for the journalistic services rendered to the government, by a pension from the emperor William I. He died at Berlin on March 27, 1886.

Julian Schmidt&#x27;s principal contributions to literary history are:
*&quot;Geschichte der Romantik im Zeitalter der Revolution und Restauration&quot; (History of Romanticism during the times of Revolution and Restoration; 1848)
*&quot;Geschichte der deutschen Nationalliteratur im 19. Jahrhundert&quot; (History of German national literature in the 19th century; 1853) His numerous critical articles for &quot;Die Grenzboten&quot; formed the basis for this. The 5th ed., revised and enlarged, appeared under the title &quot;Geschichte der deutschen Litteratur seit Lessings Tod&quot; (History of German literature since Lessing&#x27;s death; 1865–67). 
*&quot;Geschichte des geistigen Lebens in Deutschland von Leibniz bis auf Lessings Tod&quot; (History of Germany&#x27;s intellectual life from Leibniz until Lessing&#x27;s death; 1861–1863)

The latter two works subsequently appeared as &quot;Geschichte der deutschen Literatur von Leibniz bis auf unsere Zeit&quot; (History of German literature from Leibniz until modern times; 4 vols., 1886–1896). Schmidt also wrote a &quot;Geschichte der französischen Literatur seit der Revolution&quot; (History of French literature since the Revolution; 1857), &quot;Uebersicht der englischen Litteratur im 19. Jahrhundert&quot; (Outline of English literature of the 19th century; 1859); &quot;Schiller und seine Zeitgenossen&quot; (Schiller and his contemporaries; 1859); the collections of essays &quot;Bilder aus dem geistigen Leben unserer Zeit&quot; (Snapshots from the intellectual life of our time; 1870–74), and &quot;Porträts aus dem 19. Jahrhundert&quot; (Portraits from the nineteenth century; 1878)

==An evaluation from the New International Encyclopædia ==
Julian Schmidt exercised more influence upon the period of German intellectual life in which he worked than has been accorded him. As a critic in journals and periodicals, his discussions comprised the entire scope of intellectual life in science, arts, and politics. The forte of his criticism, especially in regard to works of art, lay in an almost infallible instinct to perceive truth, power, and sterling worth, which quality enabled him to teach his contemporaries not to borrow their views of things from remote chains of thought, but to trust the spontaneity of their own feelings.

<doc id="1267110" wikidata="Q902198" url="?curid=1267110" title="Radical substitution">
<text>In organic chemistry, a radical-substitution reaction is a substitution reaction involving free radicals as a reactive intermediate. 

The reaction always involves at least two steps, and possibly a third. 

In the first step called initiation (2,3), a free radical is created by homolysis. Homolysis can be brought about by heat or ultraviolet light, but also by radical initiators such as organic peroxides or azo compounds. UV Light is used to create two free radicals from one diatomic species. The final step is called termination (6,7), in which the radical recombines with another radical species. If the reaction is not terminated, but instead the radical group(s) go on to react further, the steps where new radicals are formed and then react are collectively known as propagation (4,5). This is because a new radical is created, able to participate in secondary reactions.

== Radical substitution reactions ==
In free radical halogenation reactions, radical substitution takes place with halogen reagents and alkane substrates. Another important class of radical substitutions involve aryl radicals. One example is the hydroxylation of benzene by Fenton&#x27;s reagent. Many oxidation and reduction reactions in organic chemistry have free radical intermediates, for example the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids with chromic acid. Coupling reactions can also be considered radical substitutions. Certain aromatic substitutions takes place by radical-nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Auto-oxidation is a process responsible for deterioration of paints and food, as well as production of certain lab hazards such as diethyl ether peroxide. 

More radical substitutions are listed below:
* The Barton–McCombie deoxygenation involves substitution of a hydroxyl group for a proton.
* The Wohl–Ziegler reaction involves allylic bromination of alkenes.
* The Hunsdiecker reaction converts silver salts of carboxylic acids to alkyl halides.
* The Dowd–Beckwith reaction involves ring expansion of cyclic β-keto esters.
* The Barton reaction involves synthesis of nitrosoalcohols from nitrites.
* The Minisci reaction involves generation of an alkyl radical from a carboxylic acid and a silver salt, and subsequent substitution at an aromatic compound

<doc id="1267116" wikidata="Q217633" url="?curid=1267116" title="1950 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1950 Atlantic hurricane season was the first year in the Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT) that storms were given names in the Atlantic basin. Names were taken from the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet, with the first named storm being designated &quot;Able&quot;, the second &quot;Baker&quot;, and so on. It was a very active season with sixteen tropical storms, with eleven of them developing into hurricanes. Six of these hurricanes were intense enough to be classified as major hurricanes—a denomination reserved for storms that attained sustained winds equivalent to a Category 3 or greater on the present-day Saffir–Simpson scale. One storm, the twelfth of the season, was unnamed and was originally excluded from the yearly summary, and three additional storms were discovered in re-analysis. The large quantity of strong storms during the year yielded, prior to modern reanalysis, what was the highest seasonal accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) of the 20th century in the Atlantic basin; 1950 held the seasonal ACE record until broken by the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. However, later examination by researchers determined that several storms in the 1950 season were weaker than thought, leading to a lower ACE than assessed originally. This season also set the record for the most tropical storms, eight, in the month of October.

The tropical cyclones of the season produced a total of 88 fatalities and $38.5 million in property damage (1950 USD). The first officially named Atlantic hurricane was Hurricane Able, which formed on August 12, brushed the North Carolina coastline, and later moved across Atlantic Canada. The strongest hurricane of the season, Hurricane Dog, reached the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale and caused extensive damage to the Leeward Islands. Two major hurricanes affected Florida: Easy produced the highest 24-hour rainfall total recorded in the United States, while King struck downtown Miami as a Category 4 hurricane and caused $27.75 million (1950 USD) of damage. The two major landfalls made the 1945–1950 period the only five-year period to feature five major hurricane landfalls in the United States—a record that held until tied in 2000–2005. The last storm of the year, an unnamed tropical storm, dissipated on November 12.

The season officially began on June 15 and ended on November 15; these dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. This season was the first time that the United States Weather Bureau operated with radar technology to observe hurricanes away from land. Although the season began on June 15, tropical activity typically does not begin before August. The tropics remained tranquil through early August, and the U.S. Weather Bureau noted that the season had been &quot;remarkably quiet&quot;. The inactive period ended on August 12, when the first tropical storm developed east of the Lesser Antilles. This storm received the name &quot;Able&quot; as part of the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet. (The same alphabet was also used in the 1951 and 1952 seasons, before being replaced by female naming in 1953.)

Before the end of August, four hurricanes had formed in the Atlantic, two of which attained major hurricane status. A major hurricane is a tropical cyclone with winds of at least ; a storm of this intensity would be classified as a Category 3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale introduced in the 1970s. In contrast to the busy August, only three named storms developed in September—although three of the August hurricanes lasted into September. Hurricane Dog became the strongest hurricane of the season on September 6 with winds of ; its peak strength occurred over the open Atlantic Ocean, so it did not cause significant damage when it was at its strongest. It was among the most severe hurricanes on record in Antigua, where the hurricane struck early in its duration. Eight tropical storms or hurricanes formed in October, which is greater than in any other year.

In total, there were sixteen tropical storms during the season, of which five (Tropical Storm How, Tropical Storm Mike and three unnamed tropical storms) did not attain hurricane status. Overall, six major hurricanes occurred during the year. The Hurricane Hunters made about 300 flights into hurricanes during the season, the most since the practice began in 1943. The number of storms was above average; in a typical year, eleven tropical storms, six hurricanes, and between two and three major hurricanes take place. With the numerous major hurricanes, the season produced a high accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) of 211, although it was originally assessed as 243 before reanalysis. At one point, the 1950 total was the highest on record, before being surpassed by the 2005 season. This value is an approximation of the combined kinetic energy used by all tropical cyclones throughout the season.
==Systems==
===Hurricane Able===
The beginning of the hurricane season was inactive, with the formation of no tropical cyclones during June or July. The first storm of the year originated from a tropical wave that exited the west coast of Africa around August 5. Its status over the next few days were unknown due to sparse observations. On August 12, the system was designated Tropical Storm Able east of the Lesser Antilles, which strengthened to hurricane status on August 14. Able gradually intensified as it tracked generally west-northwestward, and by 12:00 UTC on August 17, Able became a major hurricane. Initially, Able was thought to pose a threat to the Bahamas and Florida. Instead, the hurricane turned to the northwest, reaching its peak intensity as a strong Category 3 hurricane, with winds of . The storm later turned to the northeast, passing just offshore Cape Hatteras, North Carolina and Cape Cod. Steadily weakening and accelerating, Able struck Nova Scotia as a minimal hurricane, and later struck Newfoundland as an extratropical storm. It dissipated early on August 24 in the far northern Atlantic Ocean.

Along the coast of North Carolina, the hurricane produced light winds and rough waves, as well as moderate precipitation. Heavier rainfall occurred in southern New England, causing flooding in portions of New York City and producing slick roads that caused nine traffic fatalities. Able produced hurricane-force winds in Nova Scotia, and damage across Canada totaled over $1 million (1950 CAD, $  USD) in the agriculture, communications, and fishing industries. Two people died in Canada when their raft was overturned.
===Hurricane Baker===
A tropical wave exited western Africa on August 13, which developed into Tropical Storm Baker east of the Lesser Antilles on August 18. It moved northwestward and later turned to the west, attaining hurricane status on August 21. The next day, the hurricane attained Category 2 intensity just as it crossed over Antigua, where heavy damage was reported. More than 100 homes were damaged or destroyed, which left thousands homeless. Afterward, the hurricane began to weaken, and later on August 22 its winds decreased to tropical storm status. The cyclone then struck Montserrat as a strong tropical storm. The next day it struck southwestern Puerto Rico, and shortly thereafter weakened into a tropical depression, passing over the Dominican Republic. Baker turned more to the west, re-attaining tropical storm status before striking eastern Cuba on August 24. In Cuba, 37 people died, and the property losses reached several million dollars.

On August 25, Baker weakened to tropical depression status while crossing Cuba, but soon thereafter regained tropical storm intensity in the western Caribbean Sea. Two days later, Baker entered the Gulf of Mexico, and by the next day Baker had regained hurricane status. It turned northward, reaching a peak intensity of on August 30. Baker weakened slightly before making landfall near Gulf Shores, Alabama with winds of on August 31. Property and crop damage totaled $2.55 million (1950 USD), primarily between Mobile, Alabama and Saint Marks, Florida. Torrential rainfall fell throughout the region, with the largest total occurring in Caryville, Florida, where of precipitation were recorded. The heavy precipitation was responsible for extensive crop damage across the region. The hurricane also spawned two tornadoes, one of which destroyed four houses and a building in Apalachicola, Florida. In Birmingham, Alabama, high wind downed power lines, which caused one death and two injuries due to live wires. While inland, Baker tracked northwestward and eventually dissipated over southeastern Missouri on September 1.
===Hurricane Charlie===

Hurricane Charlie developed on August 21 to the southwest of the Cape Verde islands. At the time, the Weather Bureau did not consider Charlie to be a tropical cyclone until almost a week later. For four days, the storm tracked generally to the west as a weak tropical storm. On August 25, it turned to the northwest and intensified, becoming a hurricane on August 28. On August 30, Charlie attained peak winds of , although the Hurricane Hunters estimated higher winds. At the time, the hurricane was stalled to the east-southeast of Bermuda, and subsequently turned to a westward drift. On September 2, Charlie turned to the north and northeast. At the time, it co-existed with two other hurricanes, Dog and Easy; it is a rare occurrence for three hurricanes to exist simultaneously in the Atlantic. Charlie slowly weakened and lost tropical characteristics, and by September 5 Charlie had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. It dissipated later on September 5 without having affected land.
===Hurricane Dog===
Hurricane Dog is believed to have developed from a tropical wave that left the coast of Africa on August 24. Its first observation as a tropical cyclone occurred on August 30, when it was a hurricane; the storm is believed to have begun farther east as a Cape Verde-type hurricane, but was not detectable before August 30. At the time, Dog was located east of the Lesser Antilles, and it quickly attained major hurricane status as it moved to the west-northwest. Dog passed through the Lesser Antilles with winds of . It was considered among the worst hurricanes in the history of Antigua, where thousands were left homeless. Damage was estimated at $1 million (1950 USD$,  USD), and there were two deaths from drowning in the region.

After passing through the Leeward Islands, the hurricane turned to a northerly drift with continued intensification. On September 5, it attained wind speeds that would be equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane on the present-day Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained winds of . Operationally, the wind intensity value was estimated by Hurricane Hunters at when the hurricane was located about south-southwest of Bermuda; this estimate is now believed to have been an overestimation of the peak winds in Hurricane Dog, though the storm produced enormous wave heights at sea.

Maintaining peak intensity for about 18 hours, Dog began a weakening trend as it made a sharp turn to the west. It accelerated to the north on September 10, and two days later Dog passed within of Cape Cod. Newspapers attributed heavy rainfall in the Mid-Atlantic states—which resulted in five deaths—to the hurricane. Further north, the hurricane killed 12 people in New England, and produced a total of $2 million (1950 USD$,  USD) of property damage. Twelve others died in two shipwrecks off the coast of Canada. The hurricane later became a strong extratropical cyclone, maintaining hurricane-force winds while passing south of Nova Scotia and eventually hitting Scotland with hurricane-force gusts on September 18.
===Hurricane Easy===
Hurricane Easy developed on September 1 from a trough in the western Caribbean, which persisted after Hurricane Baker moved through the region in late August. Moving northeastward, the hurricane crossed Cuba on September 3 and entered the Gulf of Mexico. Easy turned to the northwest and strengthened to its peak intensity as a Category 3 hurricane. At the time, Easy was located just off the west coast of Florida; however, a ridge to its north caused the hurricane to stall, execute a small loop, and make landfall near Cedar Key. Following the landfall, Easy moved offshore, turned to the southeast, and made a second landfall near Hernando Beach on September 6. The hurricane turned northwestward over the Florida Peninsula, and gradually weakened as it moved into Georgia and the southeastern United States. On September 9, Easy dissipated over northeastern Arkansas.

Damage in Cuba was minor, although large portions of western Florida experienced hurricane-force winds and heavy rainfall. Yankeetown reported of precipitation in 24 hours, which at the time was the largest 24-hour rainfall total on record in the United States. The cumulative total rainfall on Yankeetown from Easy was , which still retains the record for the wettest tropical cyclone in Florida. Damage was heaviest in Cedar Key, where half of the houses were destroyed and most of the remaining were damaged. The rainfall caused heavy crop damage in the region. Across the state, Easy caused $3 million in damage (1950 USD), the total was less than expected, due to the sparse population of the affected area. Additionally, the hurricane was indirectly responsible for two deaths by electrocution. At the time, Easy was also known as the &quot;Cedar Keys Hurricane&quot;.
===Hurricane Fox===

On September 8, Tropical Storm Fox was present in the open Atlantic Ocean between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde, likely originating from a tropical wave. Hurricane Fox was first discovered by Hurricane Hunters on September 10, when it was located about east of Puerto Rico. A small system, the hurricane moved generally northwestward and gradually intensified. After turning toward the north, Fox reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of on September 14, as it passed about east of Bermuda. Following its peak intensity, the hurricane accelerated to the north and northeast. By September 17, Fox had lost all tropical characteristics, and later that day the circulation dissipated about halfway between the Azores and Newfoundland. Fox never affected land along its path. When Fox dissipated, it was the first time in 36 days without an active tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean.
===Hurricane George===

Tropical Storm George originated on September 27 from a strong tropical wave northeast of the Lesser Antilles and southeast of Bermuda. A large system, it moved to the northwest and later west-northwest. George began strengthening on September 30 as it decreased its forward speed. The next day, while remaining nearly stationary south of Bermuda, a nearby ship reported that George had reached hurricane status. It continued moving very slowly, passing only south of Bermuda. The island experienced winds of . Aside from rainbands, little impact was reported on Bermuda.

The hurricane passed west of Bermuda on October 3. A day later, George reached its maximum intensity, attaining sustained winds of ; in its small eye, an Air Force Hurricane Hunter plane measured a central pressure of . It accelerated to the north and later to the northeast, and on October 5 George transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Shortly thereafter, it passed just south of Newfoundland, and on October 7 the remnants of George dissipated south of Iceland.
===Tropical Storm How===

A weak trough existed in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on September 29. A circulation developed within the storm, becoming a tropical depression on October 1. Later that day, the system intensified into Tropical Storm How. Initially, the tropical storm moved west-northwestward and its sustained winds peaked by October 2, estimated at . Officials advised small boats to remain at port along the Louisiana coast due to the storm. On October 3, Tropical Storm How turned toward the southwest as it began weakening, and the next day it moved ashore near La Pesca, Tamaulipas as a tropical depression. About six hours after making landfall, How dissipated over the Sierra Madre Oriental in northeastern Mexico.
===Hurricane Item===

On October 4, a trough was present in the western Caribbean Sea, and was possibly a tropical cyclone. Moving northwest, the system crossed the Yucatán Peninsula and became disrupted, while also associating with a cold front. It emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on October 7 and became more defined. On the next day, the system developed into Tropical Storm Item off the northwest coast of the Yucatán Peninsula. The storm moved to the southwest and intensified into a hurricane on October 9, reaching peak winds of on the next day based on Hurricane Hunters observations. It is possible that Item was stronger, due to the storm&#x27;s small size but lack of direct observations. On October 11, the hurricane made landfall at 04:00 UTC near Nautla, Veracruz, with peak gusts of . The hurricane quickly dissipated over land.

In the sparsely populated area where Item moved ashore, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall. Newspaper reports considered it the worst storm to hit Mexico in ten years, with damage in Veracruz totaling around $1.5 million (1950 USD$,  USD). The strong winds sank 20 ships, and although there were no reports of casualties, Item caused 15 injuries. Communications were disrupted across the region, and downed trees blocked roads. Near Tuxpam, the winds damaged large areas of banana plantations.
===Hurricane Jig===

A tropical storm was first observed on October 11 in the central Atlantic Ocean, northeast of the Lesser Antilles and southeast of Bermuda. Two days later, a ship reported strong winds and a rapid pressure drop, indicating a hurricane was in the region; the tropical cyclone was given the name Jig. It moved northwestward, steadily intensifying before turning to the north and northeast. On October 15, Hurricane Jig passed about east of Bermuda, and later that day its sustained winds reach peak winds of , although the intensity was uncertain, based on estimates from the Hurricane Hunters. The hurricane began weakening on October 16. Jig became an extratropical cyclone later that day and quickly dissipated, never having affected land due to its small size.
===Hurricane King===
A trough was present in the western Caribbean on October 11. It is estimated that a tropical depression developed just off the north coast of Honduras on October 13, which moved northeastward and intensified into Tropical Storm King the next day. The tropical storm was a small weather system throughout its duration. On October 16, King reached hurricane strength while the passing between Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. The next day, King struck Cuba near Camagüey, Cuba with winds of , equivalent to an upper-end Category 1 hurricane. The hurricane killed seven people and caused $2 million (1950 USD$,  USD) in damage throughout the country.

After crossing Cuba, King rapidly deepened as it turned toward South Florida, becoming the sixth and final major hurricane of the season on October 18. King made landfall around 04:30 UTC on October 18, with estimated winds of , or a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale; it was the most severe hurricane to impact the city since the 1926 Miami hurricane. As it approached Miami, the hurricane had a radius of maximum winds of , and a minimum pressure of was reported as King moved across the city. The swath of destructive winds was only , likened to a small tornado. Early on October 19, King weakened to tropical storm status over north-central Florida, and on the next day it dissipated over western Georgia. There was one additional death in Georgia.

Across Florida, damage totaled $27.75 million (1950 USD$,  USD), of which $15 million (1950 USD$,  USD) was in the Miami metropolitan area. A preliminary survey indicated there were 12,290 houses damaged in the region, with an additional eight destroyed. Along its path through the state, strong winds were observed around Lake Okeechobee, with a gust in Clewiston. Overall, there were three deaths in the state. 
===Tropical Storm Twelve===

A tropical storm was present in the east-central Atlantic on October 17. It moved northwestward at first before turning to the northeast on October 19, when it was already a small, compact tropical cyclone. The storm steadily intensified as it tracked toward the Azores, and it reached a peak intensity of on October 21. Maintaining its peak strength for 30 hours, the storm began a steady weakening trend before crossing through the southern Azores. It turned to the southeast, weakening to tropical depression status on October 24. Subsequently, the system turned to the south and quickly dissipated. This tropical storm was not included in the &quot;Monthly Weather Review&quot;&#x27;s summary of the 1950 hurricane season, but was added to the Atlantic hurricane database in 1959.
===Hurricane Love===

In the wake of Hurricane King moving northward through Florida, an area of low pressure developed into a tropical cyclone on October 18 south of Louisiana. This storm was given the name Love and quickly strengthened, reaching hurricane status shortly thereafter. The storm initially moved westward across the Gulf of Mexico, but soon swung southward into the central portion of the Gulf on October 19. Hurricane Love&#x27;s maximum sustained winds are believed to have reached their peak intensity early on October 20. Throughout the hurricane&#x27;s track, dry air infringed on the western side of the tropical cyclone&#x27;s circulation, which produced unfavorable conditions for additional tropical cyclogenesis. On October 20, the storm began curving northeastward towards the coast of western Florida; however, the dry air completely circled Love&#x27;s center of circulation, drastically weakening the cyclone in the process. On October 21, Love weakened to a tropical storm, and it struck the Big Bend region of Florida, north of Cedar Key. At the time, its winds were only of moderate gale force, and the storm degenerated into a trough of low pressure shortly thereafter. This combined with an approaching cold front to produce a powerful extratropical storm.

Certain areas began preparing for the storm along Florida&#x27;s west coast. Hospitals set up emergency facilities in case of power failure, and some coastal residents left their homes. Initially, the storm was forecast to strike the Tampa area, but missed to the north as it weakened. It reportedly left little damage in the sparsely populated land where it made landfall.
===Tropical Storm Mike===
A westerly moving trough was evident in the east-central Atlantic Ocean on October 24, south of a dissipating cold front. Ships in the region reported light winds, and surface observations suggested that a circulation developed by October 25; on that basis, it is estimated that a tropical depression formed. A nearby ship reported gale-force winds on October 27, suggesting that it intensified into a tropical storm with peak winds of . An approaching cold front turned the storm northward, which absorbed the storm on October 28. The Air Weather Service (AWS) noted the system as &quot;Storm Mike&quot;, but the storm was not included in the annual Monthly Weather Review summary, nor was it included in the database until it was added by the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project in 2014.
===Tropical Storm Fifteen===

Ships in the eastern Atlantic Ocean suggested that a tropical storm was present on October 28 with peak winds of . It was estimated to have originated the previous day. The small storm moved to the northwest and later west into an area of sparse observations, suggesting a weaker system. The system&#x27;s track ended on October 29 due to uncertainty, but it was estimated to have dissipated soon after.
===Tropical Storm Sixteen===

For several days in November, a trough was present across the west-central Atlantic Ocean. On November 10, three ships reported a cyclonic circulation northeast of Bermuda, with peak winds of . It was a large system, and would likely have been classified a subtropical cyclone in the satellite era. The storm moved northeastward and weakened, degenerating into a trough on November 12 before being merging with another system.
==Storm names==

The Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet was used to name cyclones that attained at least tropical storm status in the North Atlantic in 1950. This was the first season in which tropical storms in the basin were officially given names.

<text>William Montague Charles Gummow (born 9 October 1942) is a former Justice of the High Court of Australia, the highest court in the Australian court hierarchy. He was appointed to the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong on 8 April 2013 as a non-permanent judge from other common law jurisdictions.

==Early life and education==
Justice Gummow completed his secondary education at Sydney Grammar School. He went on to study at the University of Sydney, where he graduated as Bachelor of Arts, and later Master of Laws, both with first-class honours. One of his lecturers was Sir Anthony Mason.

==Career==
===Early legal career===
Gummow first practiced as a solicitor with law firm Allen Allen and Hemsley. He was admitted as a solicitor in 1966 and became a partner of the firm in 1969. He had a diverse practice, including banking law, trusts and revenue law, intellectual property litigation, commercial transactions and some constitutional law.

===Barristerial career===
After 10 years in practice as a solicitor, Gummow was called to the New South Wales Bar in 1976. At the bar, his practice included equity, commercial, tax and intellectual property matters. It also included large constitutional issues and in several cases he appeared as a junior to then Commonwealth Solicitor-General, Maurice Byers. Gummow was appointed a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1986.

===Judicial career===
In 1986, Justice Gummow was appointed to the Federal Court of Australia. He was appointed to the High Court of Australia in April 1995. He retired from the High Court on 8 October 2012, upon reaching the constitutionally mandatory retirement age of 70. 

On 8 April 2013, he was appointed to the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong as a non-permanent judge from other common law jurisdictions. He remains in the position , along with other Australian judges Patrick Keane and James Allsop, after British judge Jonathan Sumption resigned, criticising the judiciary of Hong Kong after 14 prominent democratic activists were convicted for subversion.

===Academic career===
For 30 years, from the year of his graduation until his appointment as a judge, Gummow taught at the Faculty of Law at the University of Sydney. He lectured in equity from 1970 to 1995. Gummow&#x27;s essay &quot;Legal Education&quot; (1988) emphasised the importance of statutes and legal history; areas he considers were and are insufficiently taught in Australian law schools. He further advocated the need for practitioners in legal education, who were exposed to &#x27;the law in action&#x27;.

Following his retirement from the High Court of Australia, Gummow was appointed a Professor of the Sydney Law School, where he gives guest lectures, and a professor at the Australian National University (ANU) College of Law, where he teaches in the constitutional, equity, conflict of laws and refugee law programs.

==Jurisprudence==
Gummow&#x27;s judgments are notable for their careful attention to statutory language and context, and are marked by a thorough and scholarly examination of doctrinal history. Gummow is particularly known for his contribution to intellectual property law and equity.

Any attempt to select notable judgments of Justice Gummow is made difficult because he is so often a participant in joint judgments, whose authorship cannot be attributed. However, some of his more notable individual opinions include: &quot;Breen v Williams&quot;, &quot;Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions for New South Wales&quot;, &quot;The Wik Peoples v The State of Queensland&quot;, &quot;Hill trading as R F Hill &amp; Associates v Van Erp&quot;, &quot;Pyrenees Shire Council v Day&quot;, &quot;Scott v Davis&quot;, &quot;Roxborough v Rothmans of Pall Mall&quot;, and &quot;Al-Kateb v Godwin&quot;.

Gummow is also the author of, or participant in, numerous leading judgments in intellectual property law. See, for example: &quot;Werner &amp; Co v Bailey Aluminium Products&quot; (1989), &quot;Advanced Building Systems v Ramset Fasteners&quot; (1998), &quot;Prestige Group v Dart Industries&quot; (1990), &quot;ConAgra v McCain Foods&quot; (1992).

Statistics in recent years have consistently shown Justice Gummow to be most likely to participate or be joined in a majority opinion. He only dissented once in 2006, out of 55 judgments. Justice Gummow also often joins with Justice Hayne; in 2006 this number was 40 (75.47%) joint judgments. Similarly, in the same year Justices Gummow and Hayne joined each other in judgment in all 11 constitutional cases. Michael McHugh, who served on the court with Gummow for ten years, has called Gummow as a &quot;great judicial politician&quot;, referring to his ability to convince other justices of the court to join in his opinions.

==Publications==
Gummow has written extensively and has published numerous essays and articles.

He is the author of books including &quot;Change and Continuity: Statute, Equity, and Federalism&quot;, which is based upon the lectures he delivered at Oxford University in 1999 as part of the Clarendon law lectures series. These lectures take up themes of continuity and change in the law, particularly as they appear in the great common law jurisdictions.

He is a co-author of &quot;Jacobs&#x27; Law of Trusts in Australia&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, the pre-eminent text on equity in Australia. Gummow also wrote, with Dyson Heydon and Robert Austin, several editions of &quot;Cases and Materials on Equity and Trusts&quot; (4th ed, 1993).

==Personal life==
Gummow is unmarried and protective of his personal life.

In 2018, Gummow suffered a blood clot in a leg following a long-haul flight and had to have part of his leg amputated in Sydney.

==Honours==
Gummow was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC), Australia&#x27;s highest civil honour, in 1997, and awarded the Centenary Medal in 2001.

The University of Sydney honoured Gummow&#x27;s scholarly contributions to the law by conferring him with an honorary doctorate in law (LLD).

<doc id="1267118" wikidata="Q2826212" url="?curid=1267118" title="History of rugby union matches between Ireland and South Africa">
<text>The [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] and [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] rugby union teams have a rivalry dating back to 1906. The Springboks of South Africa dominated their early meetings, with the Irish winning just once against South Africa prior to 2004, but results have since turned in Ireland&#x27;s favour. Ireland have won nine of the last fourteen test matches since they met during the 2004 Autumn internationals. Following Ireland&#x27;s tour win over New Zealand in 2022, South Africa are the only major Southern Hemisphere team over which Ireland has not achieved a series victory, although in 2024 the two sides shared a series in South Africa 1-1.

2023 marked the two sides first ever Rugby World Cup meeting and first meeting on neutral soil. This was also the first occasion in which the world number one (Ireland) and world number two (South Africa) teams as per World Rugby Rankings, had ever met at the pool stages of a Rugby World Cup. Ireland, prevailed 13–8 over South Africa.

Along with New Zealand, South Africa and Ireland have dominated the top rankings spot in the World Rugby international men&#x27;s rankings since the mid-2010s, and meetings between any two of these three teams have been considered significant events in global rugby. In recent matches between South Africa and Ireland, in particular, the games have been noted for their closeness (only one of the eight matches since 2016 has ended with the teams more than a single score apart), and particular physical ferocity. While South Africa dominated the rivalry before the 1990s, since the return of South Africa to international rugby post-Apartheid, the record over 20 matches stands 11–9 to South Africa. The rivalry has been encouraged by the fact that Ireland and South Africa are also habitually the two strongest nations overall in the United Rugby Championship with the international rivalry replicated between the best provincial clubs in both nations.

==2004 Ireland rugby union tour of South Africa==
Ireland travelled to South Africa in June 2004, having won their first Triple Crown since 1985, and beaten the champions of the 2003 Rugby World Cup, England in their first home game since the final. As a result, the Irish manager, Eddie O&#x27;Sullivan, was confident that Ireland would achieve their first win over South Africa in 39 years, their only previous victory having come in Dublin in 1965.

By contrast, South Africa had just changed their coach to Jake White and he had radically changed the team for his first test since taking charge of the Springboks. The first of the two game test series was played at altitude in Bloemfontein and South Africa eventually won the match 31–17, despite the scores being level at 11-all at half time.

The second match was played in the Newlands Stadium in Cape Town, and was a closer affair. However, South Africa maintained their unbeaten record against Ireland on home soil by winning 26–17.

==2004 Autumn Internationals==
The two teams were to meet again in November 2004 when South Africa toured the UK and Ireland, playing each of the home nations. In the lead-up to the match, South African coach Jake White provided additional motivation to the Irish team by publicly repeating his statement from earlier in the year that &quot;only three Irish players would be good enough to get onto the South African team&quot;.

The game&#x27;s only try was scored in controversial circumstances by Irish fly-half Ronan O&#x27;Gara. In the 21st minute, New Zealand referee Paul Honiss awarded Ireland a penalty inside the South African 22 and told John Smit to go and talk to his players regarding their repeated infringements at the break-down. While Smit&#x27;s back was turned and the Springbok players were being called into a huddle, O&#x27;Gara took a quick tap and ran in for five points. John Smit protested but the try stood. O&#x27;Gara missed the conversion, but was to make up for it with a drop goal from 35 meters 12 minutes later. Percy Montgomery put the first points on the board for South Africa on 26 minutes, but missed a second effort shortly afterwards. Ireland led 8–3 at the break.

O&#x27;Gara continued his success with the boot three minutes after the start of the second half with a penalty to stretch the Irish lead to 11–3. Montgomery quickly responded in kind, but shortly afterwards Schalk Burger was sin-binned for the second week in a row, which allowed Ronan O&#x27;Gara to increase the Irish lead to 14–6. A late tackle on Irish skipper Brian O&#x27;Driscoll allowed O&#x27;Gara to increase the margin between the teams to 17–6. Percy Montgomery landed two more penalties, but Ireland hung on to win only their second victory over the Springboks, 17–12.

John Smit claims that Paul Honiss approached him after the match to apologise for the mistake regarding Ronan O&#x27;Gara&#x27;s try. A few months after the incident Paul Honiss apologised publicly on South African radio for his mistake.

==2006 Autumn Internationals==
On Saturday, 11 November 2006, the Springboks came to Lansdowne Road with an experimental side, including three debutants in the back three. The team was selected by head coach Jake White as a way of blooding players for the 2007 Rugby World Cup, and South Africa&#x27;s urgent need to develop new players in the lead up to that tournament. By contrast, Ireland&#x27;s coach, Eddie O&#x27;Sullivan chose Ireland&#x27;s strongest available team, hoping to take a prized southern hemisphere scalp and boost his team&#x27;s morale.

The day of the match was a clear, wintry day, but as the late kick off time of 5pm approached, the infamous &#x27;swirling winds of Lansdowne Road&#x27; began to blow. South Africa won the toss and chose to play into the wind in the first half, starting the game with a fine display of running rugby. On their first visit to the Irish half, they returned with points as their out half André Pretorius kicked a penalty into the wind. The Irish responded with a barging run by Denis Leamy who made the hard yards before passing to Ronan O&#x27;Gara, who then passed back inside to Andrew Trimble who found his way over for Ireland&#x27;s first points.

From there, Ireland scored two more tries and ended the first half 22–3 ahead. South Africa played better in the second half and debutant winger François Steyn showed good pace to score in the corner, but Pretorius failed to convert the try. Bryan Habana who usually plays at winger, but who played this match in the position of outside center, showed his speed and guile by scoring a remarkable solo try. Any thoughts of a South African revival were stamped out when Girvan Dempsey set up Shane Horgan for a try in the 76th minute. Ronan O&#x27;Gara scored the last points of the match with the conversion for a final score of 32–15.

For the 2006 November Test against Ireland the Springboks wore an exact replica of the jersey that was worn by the touring side captained by Paul Roos in 1906. It was on this tour that the name &#x27;Springboks&#x27; was coined. The kit consisted of a green jersey with a white collar, blue shorts and blue socks. Sponsors Sasol did not appear on the jersey. The strip was a part of South African rugby&#x27;s centenary celebrations.

==2010 Autumn International==
The teams&#x27; meeting on 6 November 2010 was the first Ireland test at their new home of Aviva Stadium, where Ireland lost 23–21.

==2016 Ireland tour of South Africa==
In 2016, Ireland achieved their first test victory against the Springboks in South Africa with a 26–20 victory in Cape Town.

==2023 Rugby World Cup meeting==
The two teams&#x27; first meeting at the Rugby World Cup (RWC) took place in the pool stage of the 2023 edition on 23 September at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis. The fixture, largely considered to be a decider as to who would win the pool and the number one spot in the world ranking, was won by Ireland, 8–13. Ireland then relinquished the number 1 spot when they were knocked out by New Zealand in the Quarter Finals. Meanwhile, South Africa went on to win the World Cup.

==2024 Ireland rugby union tour of South Africa==
During the 2024 mid year rugby union tests, Ireland claimed their second ever test win on South African soil and split the test series 1–1 with the Springboks following a deep, match-winning drop goal from Ciarán Frawley as time expired in the second test.

<text>Kew Railway Bridge spans the River Thames in London, England, between Kew and Strand-on-the-Green, Chiswick. The bridge was opened in 1869. 

==History==
The bridge, which was given Grade II listed structure protection in 1983, was designed by W. R. Galbraith and built by Brassey &amp; Ogilvie for the London and South Western Railway. The bridge is part of an extension to the latter company&#x27;s railway line from Acton Junction to Richmond. 

In 1964, the north arch under Kew Railway Bridge was acquired by Strand on the Green Sailing Club, and was rented from British Rail and then from Network Rail.

==Design==
It consists of five wrought iron lattice girder spans of 35 metres each. The cast iron piers are decorated in three stages. During the Second World War a pillbox was built to guard it on the south end, along with an open enclosure to fire an anti-tank gun from. 

The bridge carries two tracks which are electrified with both third rail and London Underground-style fourth rail. It is now owned by Network Rail and used by London Overground for North London line passenger trains running between Richmond and Stratford. The same tracks are also used by London Underground&#x27;s District line trains running between Richmond and Upminster.

==In fiction==
In &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot;, a 1964 serial from the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the TARDIS materialises under the bridge; it is trapped when the bridge collapses.

A District line train can be seen crossing the bridge in the 1965 film &quot;Four in the Morning&quot;.

<doc id="1267130" wikidata="Q808156" url="?curid=1267130" title="Barghouti family">
<text>Barghouti (other spellings Barghuthi, Barghouthi, or Al-Barghuthi) (classical Arabic: &quot;al-Barghūthī&quot;) is the surname of a prominent Palestinian family. Many of its members are notable figures in Palestinian political and cultural life, and mainly come from Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorate&#x27;s most prominent villages of Deir Ghassanah, Aboud, Kobar and Bani Zeid.

== Origin traditions ==
There are various traditions regarding the origins of the Barghouti family. According to Palestinian researcher Mustafa al-Dabbagh, the family is named after a person called Barghout and traces its roots back to the Bani Zeid clan which originated in the Arabian Peninsula, before eventually settling in Deir Ghassaneh, Palestine.

Omar al-Saleh al-Barghouti, born in 1894, recounts a tradition that the clan traces its lineage to second caliph Omar ibn al-Khattab. Following the events involving Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr during the Umayyad period, they traveled from the Hejaz to Egypt, then moved to Tunisia, and later to Palestine to support Saladin in his conquest of the region.

==List of notable members==
*Abd al-Jabir al-Barghouthi, Palestinian commander of the Bani Zeid during the Peasants&#x27; revolt in Palestine
*Abdul Latif Barghouti (1928–2002), Palestinian writer and poet
*Abdullah Barghouti (born 1979), Palestinian leading commander in Hamas&#x27; armed wing Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades

*Imad Barghouthi (born 1962), Palestinian astrophysicist and public figure, subject to several administrative detentions in Israeli prisons for his political statements, as well as one arrest by the Palestinian Authority.
*Marwan Barghouthi (born 1958), Palestinian leader of Fatah, jailed by Israel during the Second Intifada
*Mohammad Barghouti, Palestinian former labor minister of the Palestinian Authority

<doc id="1267135" wikidata="Q1335232" url="?curid=1267135" title="Mazda 787B">
<text>The Mazda 787 and its derivative 787B are Group C sports prototype racing cars that were developed by Japanese automobile manufacturer Mazda for use in the World Sportscar Championship, All Japan Sports Prototype Championship, and the 24 Hours of Le Mans from 1990 to 1991. Designed to combine a mixture of the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) Group C regulations with the International Motor Sports Association (IMSA) GTP regulations, the 787s were the last Wankel rotary-powered racing cars to compete in the World and Japanese championships, using Mazda&#x27;s R26B engine.

Although the 787 and 787B lacked the single lap pace of World Championship competitors such as Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, and Porsche, as well as Japanese Championship competitors Nissan and Toyota, the 787s had reliability that allowed them to contend for their respective championships. The reliability of the cars eventually paid off in 1991 when a 787B driven by Johnny Herbert, Volker Weidler, and Bertrand Gachot went on to victory in the 1991 24 Hours of Le Mans. As of 2023, this remains the only victory by a car not using a reciprocating engine design. It was the first victory by a Japanese manufacturer, and the only such victory until Toyota won the 2018 24 Hours of Le Mans.

A total of two 787s were built in 1990, while three newer specification 787Bs were built in 1991.

==Development==
The initial design of the 787 was an evolution of the 767 and 767B designs that had been used by Mazda in 1988 and 1989. The 787 name was used instead of 777 to indicate a two-step improvement over the 767, and possibly over pronunciation difficulties of 777 in Japanese. Many mechanical elements of the 767 were carried over by Nigel Stroud when he designed the 787, but with some notable exceptions. Foremost was the replacement of the 767&#x27;s 13J Wankel rotary engine. In its place, the brand new R26B was installed. The custom-built R26B featured a nearly identical layout and displacement, but included new design elements such as more granular variable intakes and three spark plugs per rotor instead of the 13J&#x27;s two along with ceramic apex seals and variable length trumpets, among other modifications for increased efficiency. This allowed for a maximum power output of , which was reportedly limited to 700 hp during the 1991 race at Le Mans for longevity. The five-speed gearbox manufactured by Porsche, also mounted on the 767 and 787 was retained.

Other modifications made to the 787&#x27;s design included a relocation of the radiators. Initially placed beside the cockpit on the 767, a new single radiator was integrated into the nose of the 787. Air moved from the blunt nose of the car underneath the bodywork and through the radiator before exiting in front of the windshield. A Gurney flap was located at the radiator exit to increase front-end downforce. This new radiator location also meant a redesign of the doors of the car, where the old radiator design had been located. The intake in front of the door and exit behind were no longer necessary and were thus not included, giving the 787 a smoother bodywork design on top. To aid in rear engine and brake cooling, intakes were placed on the side bodywork, immediately above the exhaust cooling vents.

As before, Stroud&#x27;s monocoque design was built from carbon and kevlar by Advanced Composite Technology in the United Kingdom. Carbon fiber body panels were affixed to the two initial chassis that were built in 1990.

===787B===
Following the 1990 season, Mazda continued development of the 787 chassis in order to make improvements on its pace and reliability. One major development was the intake system for the rotary engine. In the past, Mazda had developed variable-length telescopic intake runners to optimize engine power and torque for varying RPM levels. For 1991, the system became continuously variable, rather than previous versions that had steps for different engine ranges. This resulted in an increased torque of at 6,500 rpm. The 787B&#x27;s onboard ECU controlled the action of the telescopic intake. Another main improvement was the change in suspension geometry which allowed for larger wheels to be fitted along with carbon ceramic brakes, a first for a Mazda racing car.

The engineers at Mazdaspeed determined that fuel efficiency was crucial for achieving victory so they restricted the redline of the engine to 8,500 rpm thus reducing the power output to . Emphasis was put on high cornering speeds rather than attaining high top speeds at the straight sections of the track. Jacky Ickx was appointed as an advisor to guide the team in preparing the car. 

Three new 787Bs were built for 1991, while the two existing 787s were also upgraded with the new intakes. For Le Mans, two 787Bs were entered along with a 787 in the C2 class which were subject to greater restrictions than the newly introduced C1 class in which the cars were fitted with 3.5-litre Formula One-inspired naturally aspirated engines. The third car was built primarily to replace the Le Mans winning car in competition but it retired in 1992 with no notable success.
==Racing history==

===1990===
The first 787 chassis made its competition debut in April 1990, at the second round of the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship (JSPC) season. For the Inter Challenge Fuji 1000 km, Mazdaspeed entered their 787 alongside an older 767B chassis, with Yoshimi Katayama, David Kennedy, and Pierre Dieudonné in the new car. After Fuji, the second 787 chassis was completed, and the team departed for Europe to prepare for Le Mans. Tests were performed at the Silverstone Circuit in Great Britain and Autódromo do Estoril in Portugal to prepare the car&#x27;s setups and test its endurance. A total of were completed over the tests.

Former Le Mans-winner Jacky Ickx was hired by Mazdaspeed in order to prepare the two 787s, as well as an older 767B, for the race. Driver Stefan Johansson joined Kennedy and Dieudonné in the first car, and Bertrand Gachot, Volker Weidler and Johnny Herbert were hired for the second entry. The all-Japanese line-up of Katayama, Yojiro Terada and Takashi Yorino remained in the 767B. In qualifying the new 787s set the 22nd and 23rd fastest lap times, ahead of the 767B&#x27;s 34th fastest time.

The two 787s ran reliably for much of the race, lasting through the night until problems were encountered in the early hours of Sunday morning. While leading their GTP class, an oil leak on the No. 201 entry for Kennedy, Dieudonné, and Johansson forced the team to retire the car. Two hours later, the No. 202 787 was also retired after an electrical failure and fire. Heat from the engine was blamed for both failures. The 767B, the only car remaining in its class, survived until the end of the race and finished 20th.

After Le Mans, Mazdaspeed withdrew the remaining 767B from competition. Two 787s were entered for the rest of the JSPC season with the Japanese trio of drivers in one entry and Kennedy and Dieudonné remaining in the other. Returning to Fuji, the 787s earned fifth and tenth-place finishes in a 500 km event, although the fifth-place finisher was later disqualified due to a fuel cell that was too large. Tenth place was again earned at the 1000 km of Suzuka, although the all-Japanese entry retired after an engine failure. A similar result occurred at Sugo, except it was the Japanese squad that finished eleventh while the international squad had an engine failure.
For the last event of the season, the 1000 km of Fuji, Mazdaspeed entered the two 787s and a 767B, brought out of retirement. It finished sixth: one 787 was seventh and the other retired following a transmission failure. Mazdaspeed&#x27;s Yoshimi Katayama earned 25th in the drivers&#x27; championship, and Mazda was fourth in the constructors&#x27; championship.

===1991===
For the 1991 season, Mazda expanded their efforts with the 787. Two cars were assigned to the JSPC series, while a third car ran the full Sportscar World Championship season for the first time, with drivers David Kennedy, Maurizio Sandro Sala, and Pierre Dieudonné assigned to the team. The French Oreca team were put in charge of the world championship campaign. Oreca and team consultant Jacky Ickx were able to persuade FISA that the 787s should be allowed to run with less weight than their competitors, leading to FISA allowing the team to run the cars at rather than the standard required for the C2 class.

Unlike the JSPC series, FISA had begun to integrate regulations for a new engine formula in the world championship, which required all teams to use 3,500 cc engines for 1991. Cars that met these regulations in 1991 became the top C1 class, while cars with other engines, including the 787, were reclassified as C2. The C2 class cars also retained the fuel consumption formula that group C had been founded on, while C1 cars no longer required it. This meant that Mazda now had to fight for class wins within their new class. In the JSPC, however, Mazda&#x27;s 787s remained in the GTP class, as the sole competitors in the category.

The year started in Japan, with Mazdaspeed entering two older 787s while the new 787Bs were being finalised. Both cars suffered problems and were uncompetitive. Attention then turned to the Suzuka Circuit, where the début race of the world championship season was being run. The first new 787B chassis arrived alongside an older 787. The newer car, with Sandro Sala and Kennedy, out-qualified the older chassis driven by the all Japanese squad by only an eighth of a second, but the 787B was able to outlast several other competitors and finish in sixth overall, fourth in the C2 class, and earning Mazda points in the championship.

The 787B was retained in Japan while the European squad turned to Monza with an older 787. Yojiro Terada and Takashi Yorino earned the new 787B another sixth-place finish at the 1000 km of Fuji, while the European team finished seventh at Monza on the same day. A poor race at Silverstone added no points to Mazda&#x27;s world championship total before the team concentrated on Le Mans.

Following the team&#x27;s Le Mans victory, Mazdaspeed returned to Fuji once more with a 787B, and improved their season results with a fourth-place finish followed by another sixth at Suzuka. A third 787B was completed by October, and the two cars finished in third and fourth places at the second 1000 km of Fuji. To end the season, the team finished in sixth at Sportsland SUGO, earning Mazda fourth in the constructors&#x27; championship, and Takashi Yorino fourteenth in the drivers&#x27; championship.

The European squad meanwhile continued to use the older 787, finishing in fifth at the Nürburgring and seventh at Magny-Cours. The championship then flew to Mexico City where Mazda finished ninth, before the season ended back in Japan. The two 787Bs of the Japanese squad replaced the older 787, and the two cars finished in ninth and tenth places. Mazdaspeed finished fifth in the teams&#x27; championship, and Maurizio Sandro Sala earned fifteenth place in the drivers&#x27; championship.

====24 Hours of Le Mans====
The 59th 24 Hours of Le Mans, round four of the World Sportscar Championship, was the first time the race took place at the entirely new pit complex much to the pleasure of pit crews and drivers, after several years of having to use the notoriously cramped area, which became associated with the film &quot;Le Mans&quot;.

Mazdaspeed entered three cars and a spare. One of them was a 787 from the previous year, numbered 56, driven by Dieudonné, Yorino and Terada and two brand new 787B&#x27;s. One of them was driven by Maurizio Sandro Sala who replaced the newly retired Katayama, Johansson and Kennedy No. 18 (001) and the No. 55 (002) car of Weidler, Herbert and Gachot making its only appearance in its sole race.

Unlike the other two cars that were painted in their standard blue stripes on white livery, No. 55 had an outrageous bright orange and green scheme in honour of a main sponsor, Renown, a Japanese clothing manufacturer that had been supporting the team since 1988 by providing all their clothing for the events.

Mazda was not the favourite to win, but the three Mazdas started 19th (No. 55), 23rd (No. 18) and 30th (No. 56), despite being the 12th, 17th and 24th fastest qualifiers respectively. The new 3.5 litre cars were given the first grid positions, moving everyone else back by seven places. On the day before the race, team manager Ohashi decided to drop his usual conservative strategy and instructed the drivers of the No. 55 car to drive as if it were a short sprint race.

The decision was made based on the reliability of the cars demonstrated in the Paul Ricard tests, as well as the car&#x27;s exceptional fuel economy, which meant that the carefully learned driving techniques intended to preserve the fuel allowance were no longer a critical part of the team&#x27;s strategy. A number of teams were concerned about the reliability of the new 3.5L engine formula, with Jaguar and Sauber entering their older Group C vehicles; Jaguar entering their XJR12 alongside a sole XJR14 and Sauber not entering their C291 despite being developed for the 1991 season, instead entering the C11.

In the early stages of the race, the No. 55 car made its way to third place with the No. 18 car behind it two laps down. The No. 18 had a lower gear ratio setup meaning the car used less fuel but was slower. The No. 55 moved into second place when the Mercedes-Benz C11 of Michael Schumacher, Fritz Kreutzpointner and Karl Wendlinger spun off and later pitted with a gearbox problem. It soon became obvious that the leading car had slowed down to preserve its fuel allowance and an air of disbelief spread around the Mazda pit as it became obvious with six hours to run that there was a chance of victory.

At the 22nd hour, the No. 55 car took the lead after the C11 of Alain Ferté was forced to pit with mechanical problems. At the last pit-stop, Herbert asked to stay in the car, and went on to take the 787B across the finish line first, completing 362 laps and covering 4,932.2 km (both new records for the recently modified circuit). The two other cars finished sixth (No. 18) and eighth (No. 56). Three Jaguar XJR-12s and a sole Mercedes filled out positions two through five.

Herbert was so dehydrated that he had to be assisted out of the car and taken to the circuit&#x27;s medical centre. As a result, he was unable to make it to the podium, leaving Weidler and Gachot to take up the celebrations. He later commented in a magazine interview that some “dodgy” spaghetti he ate before his shift was the cause.

The winning car ran without a hitch apart from a blown headlamp bulb and a precautionary rear wheel bearing change on the driver&#x27;s side of the car, when a regular check during a pit-stop showed it to be overheating slightly. The victory was a major success for Mazda after several years of poor results.

==After Le Mans==

=== 787B ===

After Le Mans, the winning car (787B-002) was retired from duty while the other two cars (787B-001 and new 787B-003) continued to race. Mazda would go on to finish fourth and fifth in the Japanese and world championship respectively, with a season high (besides Le Mans) third in the 1000 km Fuji race (a JSPC race). As Mazda used different drivers throughout the season, none of their drivers finished in the top 10 in points.

After the 1991 24 Hours of Le Mans, the 787B would compete once more, at the last race of the season, the 1991 430 km of Autopolis (finishing 9th and 10th). At the end of the season, the Group C series was replaced by the 3.5-litre World Sports Championship and therefore Wankel-type rotary engines would no longer be allowed to run as they were outlawed and, as per Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile&#x27;s earlier decision, 3.5-litre engines similar to those used in Formula One became the new formula for the 1992 season. The following year, Mazda entered the MXR-01, based on the Jaguar XJR-14 and powered by a Judd unit, without much success (placed fourth at Le Mans in 1992).

Despite the Le Mans success of the 787B and its Wankel powerplant, Mazda did not exploit its historic victory through marketing campaigns and advertising. It partially improved sales for Mazda&#x27;s road cars, however. In the United Kingdom, Mazda would introduce a special edition of its MX-5 with the racing colour and also a BBR (Brodie Brittain Racing) turbo conversion; only 24 were produced and the car is one of the most sought after special edition cars of its model. Long a proponent of the rotary engine, Mazda maintained a rotary-engine road car for many years, though sales of the RX-7 were stopped in North America after the 1995 model year (with Japanese-market production ending in 2002) until the introduction of the 2003 RX-8. The RX-8 utilized a new generation of the Mazda Wankel engine, dubbed &quot;Renesis&quot;, which uses side intake and exhaust ports.

787B was displayed at the Otaru City Museum for 20 years, but the car has been returned to Mazda Headquarters as of November 18, 2015.

=== Drivers ===

Of the winning drivers, Herbert would have a successful career in Formula One, notching three wins before leaving the championship in 2000 and returning to sportscar racing. Gachot went on to drive for Jordan Grand Prix in 1991 before being given an eighteen-month prison sentence in August 1991 for a CS gas attack on a taxi driver in London; his place for the Belgian Grand Prix was famously filled by then-newcomer Michael Schumacher. He was released after two months and achieved minor successes before retiring altogether. Weidler would compete in the Japanese Formula 3000 championship, only to have his career cut short when he was diagnosed with tinnitus. It was recommended he should take time off to allow for an operation but he chose to retire from the sport and handed his seat over to Heinz-Harald Frentzen. Of the non-winning drivers, Dieudonné later retired from driving and become sporting director at Oreca, this time backed by Chrysler to help the Dodge Viper to score class wins at Le Mans by the late nineties and an overall win at the 24 Hours of Daytona in 2000. Terada, a veteran of the race since 1974, continued to run his Autoexe tuning business. He still competed at Le Mans, although without factory backing but showing no signs of retiring. The former F1 driver, Johansson, returned to IndyCar duties, frequently competing in the race before returning full-time.

=== Engine ===
The R26B engine was used by Mazda in its RX-792P for its premier IMSA GTP category with limited success. The engine continued to be used in the GTS category for the spaceframe FD3S RX-7, which returned to Le Mans in 1994, backed by Mazdaspeed. The livery returned again, in 1995, in Jim Downing&#x27;s rotary-powered Kudzu DG-1, which competed in IMSA&#x27;s WSC (World Sport Car), a category with different regulations than the FIA. This time, they started the race without the Renown sponsorship and in 1996 in the lower end LMP2 category, which was the last time Mazda used the livery. Mazdaspeed would continue to compete in the race until 1999.

In 2002 Autoexe Motorsport with Yojiro Terada as one of its drivers participated in 24 Hours of Le Mans using a R26B 2.6L four-rotor engine in a modified WR chassis. They did not finish the race, however. In 2005 B-K Motorsports competed a Courage C65 LMP2 prototype in the American Le Mans Series, powered by a Mazda tri-rotor Wankel and painted in a yellow and blue version of the livery worn by the 787B.

=== 787B&#x27;s legacy ===
Today the car is considered by Mazda and Wankel enthusiasts as one of the most iconic race cars to come out of Japan. It has appeared in several video games, such as the &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; series, the &quot;Forza Motorsport&quot; series, and &quot;Assetto Corsa&quot;. In 2005, a factory-backed RX-8 used the Renown colours to compete in a 24-hour race at Silverstone.

Mazda keeps the winning car at the Mazda Museum in Hiroshima. At the same time, Mazda produced two replicas and gave one of them to the Le Mans Museum. The Le Mans Museum car, chassis 04, is an authentic car with non-operational mechanics. The race winning car usually makes appearances at the annual Sevenstock shows, and has made two appearances at the Monterey Historics event in 1999 and 2004 and still bears a pair of small oval racing stickers behind the side windows, referring to its appearance at the 1999 Goodwood Festival of Speed, when it was reunited with and driven by Gachot.

The 2008 Mazda Furai Concept bears the 55 number of the winning 787B.

After a lengthy restoration, the winning No. 55 787B was demonstrated during the pre-race of the 2011 24 Hours of Le Mans. Winning driver Johnny Herbert took the 787B around the Circuit de La Sarthe for a demonstration lap.

On December 24, 2014, as part of the Vision Gran Turismo project, Mazda unveiled the LM55 Vision Gran Turismo concept car, available as downloadable content in &quot;Gran Turismo 6&quot;. The LM55 is seen as an homage to Mazda&#x27;s own 1991 victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. At the 2015 Goodwood Festival of Speed, the LM55 and 787B were the focus of that year&#x27;s monument.

On July 2, 2016, at the annual Sahlen&#x27;s Six Hours of the Glen, held at Watkins Glen International as leg in the Tequila Patron North American Endurance Cup, Mazda&#x27;s Prototype team used the 787B livery on their two prototypes in commemoration for the 25th anniversary of Mazda&#x27;s Le Mans win.

On July 30, 2018, the 787B No. 55 was added to the game &quot;Gran Turismo Sport&quot;, keeping the 787B&#x27;s long streak as part of the &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; series alive. The car&#x27;s engine sound was slightly updated, along with its interior and its drivers&#x27; names, which were corrected.

<text>Joseph Victor von Scheffel (16 February 1826 – 9 April 1886) was a German poet and novelist. His novel &quot;Ekkehard&quot; (1855) became one of the most popular German novels in the 19th century.

==Biography==
He was born at Karlsruhe. His father, a retired major in the Baden army, was a civil engineer and member of the commission for regulating the course of the Rhine; his mother, &quot;née&quot; Josephine Krederer, the daughter of a prosperous tradesman at Oberndorf am Neckar, was a woman of great intellectual powers and of a romantic disposition. Young Scheffel was educated at the lyceum at Karlsruhe and afterwards (1843–1847) at the universities of Munich, Heidelberg and Berlin.

After passing the state examination for admission to the judicial service, he graduated &quot;Doctor juris&quot; and for four years (1848–1852) held an official position at the town of Säckingen. Here he wrote his epic poem &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Trumpeter of Säckingen&quot;) (1853), a romantic and humorous tale which immediately gained extraordinary popularity. It reached more than 250 editions and was made into an opera by Viktor Nessler in 1884. Scheffel next undertook a journey to Italy.
Returning home in 1853 he found his parents more than ever anxious that he should continue his legal career. But in 1854, defective eyesight incapacitated him; he quit the government service and took up his residence at Heidelberg, with the intention of preparing himself for a post on the teaching staff of the university. His studies were, however, interrupted by eye disease, and in search of health he travelled to Switzerland and took up residence at Lake Constance, and elaborated the plan of his famous historical romance &quot;Ekkehard&quot; (1855); (Eng. translation by Sofie Delffs, Leipzig, 1872). Part of this work was later used by Max Bruch as the libretto for his cantata &quot;The Lay of the Norsemen&quot;. The first ideas for this work he got from the &quot;Monumenta Germaniae Historica&quot;. &quot;Ekkehard&quot; was almost as popular than the &quot;Trompeter von Säkkingen&quot;. In 1901 it reached the 179th edition.

Scheffel next returned to Heidelberg, and published &quot;Gaudeamus, Lieder aus dem Engeren und Weiteren&quot; (1868), a collection of joyous and humorous songs, the subject matter of which is taken partly from German legends and partly from historical subjects. In these songs the author shows himself the light-hearted student, a friend of wine and song; and their success is unexampled in German literature and encouraged numerous imitators. One example is &quot;Im schwarzen Walfisch zu Askalon&quot; where the lyrics reflect an endorsement of the bacchanalian mayhem of student life. The song describes an &#x27;old assyrian&#x27; drinking binge with some references to the Classics and the large invoice presented in cuneiform on six brick stones. However the carouser has to admit that he left his money already in an inn in Nineveh and gets kicked out. In typical manner of Scheffel, it contains an anachronistic mixture of various times and eras and parodistic notions on current science.

Scheffel&#x27;s life was marked by disappointments: the unsuccessful German revolution of 1848 and his unsuccessful courting of Emma Heim in 1851. He also used natural science to mock the political environment, as he mocked Hegel with his guano poem or referred to the course of time in his Ichthyosaurus poem. Indirectly, Scheffel coined the expression &#x27;Biedermeier&#x27; for the pre-1848 age, as two of Scheffel poems &quot;Biedermanns Abendgemütlichkeit&quot; and &quot;Bummelmaiers Klage&quot;, based on the poetry of teacher and poet , published 1848, were used in later satires about the reactionary .

For two years (1857–1859) Scheffel was custodian of the library of Prince Egon von Fürstenberg at Donaueschingen, but giving up his appointment in 1850, visited Joseph von Laßberg, at Meersburg at Lake Constance, stayed for a while with Charles Alexander, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, at the Wartburg in Thuringia, then, settling at Karlsruhe, he married in 1864 Caroline von Malzen, and, in 1872, retired to his Villa Seehalde near Radolfzell at the lower Lake Constance. On the occasion of his jubilee (1876), which was celebrated all over Germany, he was granted a patent of hereditary nobility by the grand duke of Baden. He died at Karlsruhe on 9 April 1886.

== Legacy ==

1891 (1844–1893) founded the in Schwetzingen (now Karlsruhe), the largest literary society in Germany with about 7000 members. The Scheffelprize is dedicated to excellent pupils. There are various Scheffel memorials, street and place names. The Scheffel Archive is partially at the Scheffelbund and partially at the Baden State Library.

==Works==

*&quot;Frau Aventiure. Lieder aus Heinrich von Ofterdingens Zeit&quot; (1863)
*&quot;Juniperus. Geschichte eines Kreuzfahrers&quot; (1866)

*&quot;Waldeinsamkeit&quot; (1880)
*&quot;Der Heini von Steier&quot; (1883)
*&quot;Hugideo, eine alte Geschichte&quot; (1884)
Volumes of &quot;Reisebilder&quot; (1887); &quot;Epistein&quot; (1892); and &quot;Briefe&quot; (1898) were published posthumously. Scheffel&#x27;s &quot;Gesammelte Werke&quot; have been published in six volumes (1907).

In 1969, when Thierry Le Luron was a 17-year-old student at the Lycée Emmanuel-Mounier in Châtenay-Malabry, he and his friends created a band called &quot;Les rats crevés&quot; (&quot;The Dead Rats&quot;) and performed a few gigs in the Hauts-de-Seine region. The band debuted in several Parisian cabarets, including L&#x27;Echelle de Jacob. Le Luron was featured on 4 January 1970 on the game show &quot;Le jeu de la chance,&quot; a segment of the TV show &quot;Télé Dimanche&quot;. He won six consecutive times, first singing classic tunes before choosing to devote himself to imitation. He performed his first sketches on the same program, including the 1 February 1970 (imitation Adamo) and 15 February 1970 editions, even on the anniversary of Jean Nohain, when he sang for Prime Minister Jacques Chaban-Delmas and Jean Nohain.

In 1971, Le Luron released his first album, &quot;Le Ministère patraque&quot; (&quot;The Ministry out of sorts&quot;), which became very popular. He gave his first performance as an actor in Bobino between February and March 1972 and opened for the Claude François tour in the summer of 1972.

==Success==
From November 1972 to July 1973, Le Luron hosted his first show, &quot;Le Luron du dimanche&quot; (&quot;Le Luron on Sunday&quot;), on the first channel of ORTF. It was created the same year as his new show was premiered at the Théâtre des Variétés.

Thierry Le Luron performed every evening with some of his friends, his last acts were poignant. The band &quot;Le Luron&quot; included Jacques Collard, Jacques Pessis, Pierre Guillermo, Francis Diwo, Luc Fournol, and Bernard Mabille. The portraits, sketches and imitations were refined and gave birth to very elaborate performances at the Olympia (December 1976), Bobino (February-April 1978), Théâtre Marigny (October 1979 – June 1980), &quot;Thierry Fééries&quot; at the Palais des congrès de Paris (November 1980 – January 1981), &quot;De de Gaulle à Mitterrand&quot; at the Théâtre Marigny (January- December 1983), and &quot;Le Luron en liberté&quot; at the Théâtre du Gymnase Marie Bell (November 1984 – March 1986).

The last show attracted about 400,000 viewers. He then worked mainly with Bernard Mabille and created the character of Adolphe Benito Glandu, caretaker at 22 Rue de Bièvre, a &quot;fairly extensive caricature of the average Frenchperson: an individual with no particular equities, influenced by calamities, and that defines Le Luron: Petainist under Pétain, Mendesist under Mendès France, and Socialist May 10 to 11!&quot;.

He also pursued an intense activity on television and radio: &quot;Chat en poche&quot; by Georges Feydeau as part of the TV show &quot;Au théâtre ce soir&quot; (released 24 October 1975) and &quot;Numéro 1&quot; by Maritie and Gilbert Carpentier (March 1976 and June 1979). From 1978 to 1979, he hosted a weekly show, &quot;Les Parasites sur l&#x27;antenne&quot;, on France Inter including Pierre Desproges, Lawrence Riesner, Bernard Mabille and Evelyne Grandjean as columnists. In 1981, he recorded the theme song of the animated television series &quot;Rody le petit Cid&quot;.

Thierry Le Luron later imitated Gilbert Bécaud on the TV show &quot;Champs-Elysees&quot; on 10 November 1984, singing and making the public sing along a song titled &quot;L&#x27;emmerdant, c&#x27;est la rose&quot; (&quot;The rose is what&#x27;s annoying&quot;, a parody of Bécaud&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;important c&#x27;est la rose&quot;), with the rose being the symbol of the Socialist Party dedicating this song to President François Mitterrand.

On 25 September 1985, he &quot;married&quot; Coluche &quot;for better or for laughter&quot; (&quot;pour le meilleur ou pour le rire,&quot; a pun on the phrase &quot;pour le meilleur ou pour le pire&quot;) to great fanfare in Montmartre. A few weeks later his &quot;son,&quot; played by Carlos was born. Le Luron said: &quot;I wanted Coluche to be dressed by Pierre Cardin. But...for Mourousi&#x27;s marriage, he has to make both dresses&quot;. This statement, and the false marriage itself, are often interpreted as a public act of vengeance, especially by Le Luron&#x27;s friends, as most of the attention was focused on Coluche, although the press commended both of them for their outspokenness.

==Death and legacy==
Le Luron was diagnosed with AIDS at the age of 34, and cancelled his scheduled appearances in December 1985. He died on 13 November 1986.

<text>The Heusweiler transmitter was a facility for medium wave broadcasting north of Heusweiler, Germany. It originally went into service on 23 December 1935. On 19 June 1946 transmitter Heusweiler went in service again.

It was used by Saarländischen Rundfunk and with 1200 kW the most powerful medium wave transmitter in the ARD syndicat. The transmitters were defunct in 2015.

== History ==

=== Original transmitter ===
It used a t-aerial, which was up-hung on two 35 and 31 meters tall wooden towers. The Heusweiler transmitter was destroyed on March 17, 1945 by war damage.

First a t-aerial was used, which was, in the same year, replaced by a 50 metre tall steel framework mast insulated against ground, which exists still today and serves as reserve antenna.

=== Replacement transmitters ===
In 1948, a 120 meter high steel framework mast insulated from ground was built in Heusweiler. In the following years, the transmitting power of the Heusweiler transmitter was steadily increased.

In 1965, another radio mast with a height of 120 meters was built, and in 1973 the transmitting power was increased to 1200 kilowatts, with the power reduced to 600 kilowatts at night. The Heusweiler transmitter was thereby the most powerful medium wave transmitter in Germany, and the most powerful transmitter of the ARD.

From 1973 to 1994 the Heusweiler transmitter transmitted the program of Europawelle Saar.

Since 1994, the transmitter has been used for broadcasting the program of Deutschlandfunk. The transmitting power was permanently 600 kilowatts, however Deutschlandfunk closed down all its Medium Wave transmitters, including the Heusweiler radio transmitter on December 31, 2015.

In order to prevent a disturbing influence on car electronics by the transmitter, a net of wires was hung over the A8 Autobahn near the transmitter.

=== De-funct 2015 ===
On December 31, 2015 at 11:57 p.m. the channels were finally switched off. Since 11:45 p.m., the Deutschlandfunk frequency 1422 kHz had been broadcasting the old Deutschlandfunk marker, which has not been used in the program for years, in a continuous loop as a special farewell campaign.

The 1179 kHz frequency of Antenne Saar was switched off in the middle of the ARD night program.

After the end of the medium wave era in Germany, the facility in Heusweiler was shut down by Saarländischer Rundfunk. A planned sale to RTL in Luxembourg did not take place. In 2018 the masts were blown up in a controlled manner.

<doc id="1267147" wikidata="Q511329" url="?curid=1267147" title="Andrija Artuković">
<text>Andrija Artuković (19 November 1899 – 16 January 1988) was a Croatian lawyer, politician, and senior member of the ultranationalist and fascist Ustasha movement, who served as the Minister of Internal Affairs and Minister of Justice in the Government of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) during World War II in Yugoslavia. He signed into law a number of racial laws against Serbs, Jews, and Roma, and was responsible for a string of concentration camps in which over 100,000 civilians were tortured and murdered. He escaped to the United States after the war, where he lived until extradited to Yugoslavia in 1986. He was tried and found guilty of a number of mass killings in the NDH, and was sentenced to death, but the sentence was not carried out due to his age and health. He died in custody in 1988.

==Early life and career==
Andrija Artuković was born on 19 November 1899, in Klobuk, near Ljubuški in Austro-Hungarian to Marijan and Ruža (née Rašić) Artuković. He was one of 14 siblings raised on a farm. He studied at a Franciscan &quot;gymnasium&quot; (high school) run by the monastery in nearby Široki Brijeg, and obtained a doctorate in law from the University of Zagreb in 1924. From 1926 he was practising law in Gospić in the Lika region of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

==&quot;Ustaše&quot; activities==
Artuković joined the Croatian nationalist and terrorist &quot;Ustaše&quot; organisation which had been formed in 1929 and in 1932, he was one of the organisers of their small Velebit uprising in Lika, which involved an attack on a Yugoslav gendarmerie station by a group of &quot;Ustaše&quot;. Artuković fled Yugoslavia before the uprising commenced, escaping via Rijeka to Venice on 31 August. On arrival in Italy, the &quot;poglavnik&quot; (supreme leader) of the &quot;Ustaše&quot;, Ante Pavelić, appointed Artuković as an adjutant to Main &quot;Ustaša&quot; Headquarters and commander of all &quot;Ustaše&quot; in Italy, and Artuković adopted the pseudonym &quot;Hadžija&quot; (pilgrim). The uprising he helped organise was quickly and brutally suppressed by the Yugoslav authorities, which brought the &quot;Ustaše&quot; some public attention and prestige.

In Italy, Artuković came into conflict with a group of supporters of fellow &quot;Ustaša&quot; Mijo Babić (known as &quot;Giovanni&quot;). In late 1933, Artuković left the country. After that he went to Budapest and then Vienna where he was arrested and briefly detained in March 1934 before being expelled from Austria. He returned to Budapest, then after meeting Pavelić in Milan in early October, he travelled to London. He was arrested there after the Ustaše assassination of the Yugoslav King Alexander I in Marseilles, France.

After his arrest, he was handed over to French authorities and spent three months in a Paris prison. In January 1935 he was extradited to Yugoslavia, and after 16 months spent in prison in Belgrade, he was acquitted by the Court for the Protection of the State. He was released on 16 April 1936, and briefly returned to Gospić before travelling to Austria in May. He later went to Germany, where he was involved in spreading &quot;Ustaše&quot; propaganda. In early 1937 he was living in Berlin when he was interrogated by the Gestapo, and under threat of arrest, he fled to France. This was followed by a stint in Budapest after which he returned to Berlin. By the late 1930s, the &quot;Ustaše&quot; had adopted the fascist principles of their financial backer and protector, Italy.

==Independent State of Croatia==
In late March 1941, Yugoslavia joined the Axis, but two days later, a pro-Allied coup d&#x27;état overthrew the government that had signed the treaty. In response, Adolf Hitler decided to invade and dismember Yugoslavia. The German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in early April comprehensively defeated the Yugoslav military, and the country was divided up between the Axis powers. Before the Yugoslav government had capitulated, the Germans engineered the creation of the Independent State of Croatia, and placed Pavelić and the &quot;Ustaše&quot; in charge.

Slavko Kvaternik, the most senior &quot;Ustaše&quot; still in Yugoslavia, proclaimed the Independent State of Croatia on 10 April 1941, and Artuković and the other émigré &quot;Ustaše&quot; returned to Zagreb. On 12 April, Kvaternik formed an interim government, which included Artuković. Pavelić arrived in Zagreb on 15 April, and on the following day, Artuković became the Interior Minister in the first Croatian government. As a member of Pavelić&#x27;s trusted inner circle, Artuković carried out the orders he was given.

On 17 April, to provide authority for &quot;Ustaše&quot; policies targeting Serbs, Jews, Roma, and anti-&quot;Ustaše&quot; Croats within the NDH, Pavelić proclaimed the Law Decree on the Defence of the People and the State. It prohibited any person from acting against the Croatian people and their interests, for which the penalty was death. Such alleged offences were to be dealt with in a summary manner by a panel similar to a court martial. On 22 April, Artuković announced that the NDH government would solve the &quot;Jewish question&quot; in the same way as the German government, and a week later, he issued further racial laws, and advocated a policy of terror. These first and subsequent racial laws were vaguely worded, permitting wide interpretation. The organisation charged with enforcing these laws was the Directorate of Public Order and Security, which was subordinated to Artuković&#x27;s Interior Ministry. The Directorate was established in May, and was headed by Eugen &quot;Dido&quot; Kvaternik, the son of Slavko Kvaternik.

In the meantime, Artuković participated in the Croatian-Italian border negotiations that took place between Pavelić and the Italian Foreign Minister Count Galeazzo Ciano in Italian-annexed Ljubljana on 25 April 1941. The Italians made a claim for the entire eastern shore of the Adriatic, but Pavelić made a counter-offer of that part of Dalmatia that had been offered to Italy in the secret Treaty of London of 1915. The earlier Pavelić-Ciano agreement became the basis for the Treaties of Rome, which ceded these areas to Italy, and Artuković also accompanied Pavelić to the signing of those treaties in mid-May.

On 6 June, Artuković accompanied Pavelić during his visit to Adolf Hitler. On 24 February 1942, at the opening of the Croatian Parliament (), Artuković announced the creation of the Croatian Orthodox Church, which was intended to replace the Serbian Orthodox Church for Serbs living within the NDH. During the same speech, he promised that the NDH would take more radical action against Jews than Nazi Germany, referring to the Jewish people of the NDH as &quot;insatiable and poisonous parasites&quot; who would be destroyed, and stating that Croats had been forced to serve the Jews in pursuit of their &quot;filthy&quot; profits and &quot;materialistic and grasping&quot; ambitions. This speech preceded a systematic campaign against Croatian Jews which included mass deportations to NDH concentration camps and German extermination camps. After the government reshuffle on 10 October 1942, Artuković became Minister of Justice and Religion, then from 29 April 1943 until 1 October 1943 he was again the Minister of Interior. He was Secretary of State from 11 October 1943 until the collapse of the Independent State of Croatia on 8 May 1945.
==Emigration, repatriation, and trials==
With other members of the Government, he left Zagreb on 6 May 1945 in the Independent State of Croatia evacuation to Austria. He was detained in an Allied camp in Spittal an der Drau. On 18 May 1945, the British extradited some Croatian ministers and Prime Minister Nikola Mandić to the Yugoslav authorities. Artuković was not extradited, but he was released soon with the remaining ministers. He left the British occupational zone and then went via the American to the French occupational zone, where his family was. In November 1946, he crossed the Austria–Switzerland border. In Switzerland, he declared a false name, Alois Anich, and a false visa. In February 1947, he asked Swiss authorities to get a Nansen passport. Some months later, they found out his real identity. Switzerland offered him to keep his Nansen passport provided that he and his family would leave Switzerland until 15 July 1947. Exactly at that date, they took a plane to Ireland. About one year later, they entered the United States on a tourist visa 
and settled in Seal Beach, California. He worked at a company owned by his brother. As an accused war criminal, Romani Holocaust perpetrator and Ustaše official, he did not qualify for legal status in the United States and remained in the country after overstaying his visa.

In July 1945, the Yugoslav State Commission for Investigation of Crimes of Occupiers and Their Allies declared Artuković a war criminal. The Government of the FPR Yugoslavia made a request for his extradition on 29 August 1951. Their request met with a seven years long bureaucratic delay in Los Angeles, California due to the influence of the Croatian émigré community and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, to whom Artuković and his family had appealed. On 15 January 1959, U.S. Commissioner Theodore Hocke rejected Yugoslavia&#x27;s extradition request; the INS&#x27;s grounds for refusing extradition was &quot;&quot;...since the crimes for which extradition was requested were deemed &#x27;political&#x27; by the court, if Artukovic were deported to Yugoslavia, he would be &quot;subject to physical persecution&quot;.&quot; When the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) raised the question of the legal basis of the stay in the US of a large number of associates of and/or collaborationists with Nazi Germany, the Yugoslav authorities, under the initiative of the Special Investigation Court of the U.S. Department of Justice, renewed their request for Artuković&#x27;s extradition. He was arrested on 14 November 1984, and a court process began in New York. Artuković remained in custody until his deportation. In 1985, he was transferred to the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri due to his health problems.

Artuković was prosecuted by the Office of Special Investigations of the U.S. Department of Justice as the &quot;Butcher of the Balkans&quot;. He was ordered extradited to Yugoslavia on 11 November 1986, where he was tried in the Zagreb District Court. He was found guilty of:

*ordering the deaths of a lawyer and former member of the Yugoslav National Assembly, Dr. Ješa Vidić, in early 1941;
*ordering the deaths by machine-gun fire of 450 men, women and children in late 1941 because there was no room for them in a concentration camp;
*ordering the killing of the entire population of the town of Vrginmost and its surrounding villages in 1942; and
*ordering the execution of &quot;several hundred&quot; prisoners at Samobor Castle near Zagreb in 1943 by having them driven into an open field, where they were machine-gunned and then crushed by tanks.

The court held that Artuković&#x27;s intent had originated with &quot;his Ustaša orientation, by which persecutions, concentration camps and mass killings of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies, as well as Croats who did not accept the ideology, were part of the implementation of a program of creating a &#x27;pure&#x27; Croatia&quot;. In sentencing him to death, the court described him as one of the &quot;ruthless murderers, who under the cover of &#x27;protecting purity of race and faith&#x27; and with the aim of realising their Nazi-Fascist ideology, [... ] killed, slaughtered, tortured, crippled, exposed to great suffering, and persecuted thousands and thousands of people, among whom were women and children.&quot; He was sentenced to death, but the sentence was not carried out due to his age and poor health.

==Death==
Artuković died of natural causes in prison hospital in Zagreb on 16 January 1988. His son, Radoslav (a California native), requested information about his father&#x27;s burial from the Yugoslav authorities. A special law was passed in Yugoslavia that the remains of those convicted and sentenced to death but who escaped execution, were to be disposed of as those of executed persons. It is unclear what happened to his remains. In 2010—also at Radoslav’s request—the president of the Croatian Helsinki Committee, Ivan Zvonimir Čičak, called for authorities to investigate what happened to the remains.

<text>Sadová () is a municipality and village in Hradec Králové District in the Hradec Králové Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 300 inhabitants.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from the Czech word &quot;sad&quot;, i.e. &#x27;orchard&#x27;.

==Geography==
Sadová is located about northwest of Hradec Králové. It lies in a flat agricultural landscape of the East Elbe Table. The municipality is situated on the right bank of the Bystřice River.

==History==
The first written mention of Sadová is from 1086, when it was owned by the St. George&#x27;s Convent in Prague. Between 1228 and 1400, the village was owned by various lower nobles and by the Teutonic Order in Hradec Králové. Until 1420, it was again property of the St. George&#x27;s Convent. In 1448, Sadová was acquired by the Knights of Sloupno, and they became known as the Knights of Sadovský of Sloupno. After the Battle of White Mountain in 1620, their properties were confiscated and Sadová was bought by Albrecht von Wallenstein.

Albrecht von Wallenstein owned Sadová only one year, then he exchanged the village with Maria Magdalena Trčková for other properties. She bequeathed the village to Adam Erdmann Trčka von Lípa, but he was murdered in 1636, and Sadová was gifted to General Lieutenant Matthias Gallas. In the late 1640s, Sadová was acquired by marriage by the House of Schaffgotsch. They ruled the village until 1788, when they had to sell it due to debts. From 1788 to 1829 it was owned by Lords of Gränzenstein, and from 1829 by the Harrach family.

On 3 July 1866, the area around Sadová became the scene of the sanguinary Battle of Königgrätz, also known as the Battle of Sadowa, the decisive combat of the Austro-Prussian War.

Despite France being neutral in that war, the French public resented the Prussian victory and demanded &quot;Revanche pour Sadova&quot; (Revenge for Sadowa), which was one factor leading to the Franco-Prussian War of 1870.

==Demographics==
==Transport==

The I/35 road (part of the European route E442) passes through the municipality.

Sadová is located on the railway line from Hradec Králové to Turnov.

==Sights==
There are no protected cultural monuments in the municipality. The Battle of Königgrätz is commemorated by a military cemetery from 1866 with several monuments.

<text>Jean de Schelandre (c.1585 – 18 October 1635), Seigneur de Saumazènes, was a French poet.

==Biography==
He was born about 1585 near Verdun of a Calvinist family, and studied at the university of Paris. He then joined Turenne&#x27;s army in the Netherlands, where he gained rapid advancement.

He was the author of a tragedy, &quot;Tyr et Sidon, ou les funestes amours de Belcar et Méliane&quot;, published in 1608 under the anagram-name &quot;Daniel d&#x27;Anchéres&quot;, and reprinted with numerous changes in 1628 under the author&#x27;s own name. It has been suggested that Schelandre was directly acquainted with Shakespearian drama, but of this there is no direct proof, although he appears to have spent some time in England and to have seen James I.

He pursued his military career to the end of his life, dying at Saumazènes in 1635 from wounds received in the German campaign of Louis d&#x27;Epernon, Cardinal de la Valette.

==&quot;Tyr et Sidon&quot;==
In defiance of all rules, the action of &quot;Tyr et Sidon&quot; proceeds alternately at Tyre where Belcar, prince of Sidon, is a prisoner, and at Sidon where Léonte, prince of Tyre, is a prisoner and pursues his gallant adventures. The play, which was divided into two days and ten acts, had a complicated plot and contained 5000 lines. It required an immense stage on which the two towns should be represented, with a field between, where the contests should take place.

&quot;Tyr et Sidon&quot; is noteworthy as an attempt to introduce the liberty of the Spanish and English drama into France, thus anticipating the romantic revolt of the 19th century. It is reprinted in the 8th volume of the &quot;Ancien Théâtre français&quot;. Schelandre was also the author of a &quot;Stuartide&quot; (1611), and of &quot;Les Sept Excellents Travaux de la penitence de Saint Pierre&quot; (1636).

<text>The Currency of Maldives is Rufiyaa, (introduced in 1947). The rufiyaa is divided into 100 laari.

==History==

===Boli===

Cowry shells (&quot;Cypraea moneta&quot;), or &quot;boli&quot;, were the first known medium of exchange used in the Maldives. Various writers and travellers have in the past recorded the country&#x27;s trade in these money shells, which were used as a medium of exchange in parts of Asia and Africa. In the past, cowry were actually cultivated in the Maldives. When Moroccan traveler and historian Ibn Battuta visited this country, feojedfe Dutch in Ceylon, continued until the late 19th century, when it was used mostly as ballast for sailing vessels.

===Dhigu laari===
According to history, the first &quot;dhigu laari&quot; was struck in the Maldives, during the reign of Sultan Ibrahim III ibn Ghazi Muhammed (1585–1607), son of the hero Sultan Ghazi Muhammed Thakurufa&#x27;anu Akbar al-&#x27;Azam. Dhigu laari or larin, which owes its name to Lar, in the Persian Gulf, where it was originally struck, was one of the standard currencies of the Indian Ocean in the late 16th century. The dhigu laari is actually a long piece of silver, about three inches in length, doubled over and stamped with the name of the sultan, in Arabic.

===Loa laari===
&quot;Loa laari&quot; or &quot;laari fothi&quot; (&quot;circular coin&quot;) was first struck by Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar I (1648–1687). The first coins were of silver and fairly coarse. Later, coins of copper and lead were put into circulation. Gold coins were also struck by Sultan Hassan Nooraddin (1779–1799). Said to be the finest struck at the Maldive mint, the two denominations of gold coins issued by Sultan Hassan Nooraddin, known as the &quot;mohori&quot; and &quot;bai mohori&quot;, were never put into circulation.

==Today==
The Maldivian unit of currency is the rufiyaa (ISO 4217 code MVR, symbol &quot;Rf.&quot;), introduced in 1947. The rufiyaa is divided into 100 laari. On 1 February 2009, the exchange rate with the US dollar was US$1.00 = MVR12.80. On 10 April 2011, the Government announced a limited float of the currency within a band of 20% from the previous exchange rate of 12.80. Due to short supply of US Dollars, the official rate quoted by all banks as on 10 May stands as follows: Buy Rate USD 1.00 = MVR 14.42; Sell Rate USD 1.00 = MVR 15.42.

<text>Industries in the Maldives center around fishing and tourism, with some overlap between the two with recreational fishing.

== Fishing ==
=== Pole and line fishing ===
Since prehistory, the method of fishing employed in the archipelago has been the pole and line method. The types of fish caught by this method are tuna, skipjack tuna, frigate and mackerel. The main catch is tuna, which is used in the daily diet of the inhabitants, as well as for export in different forms. The daily catch mainly depends on the seasons. Triangular sailed &quot;dhoni&quot; were used in the past, while mechanized fishing &quot;dhoanis&quot; are now used.

Traditionally, fishermen set out at dawn in search of bait fish, which were caught and kept alive in a specially prepared compartment of the &quot;dhoani&quot;. Eight or nine men did the actual fishing. The poles are short, are equipped with a line, and hook. During a favorable season, the catch can be as much as a thousand fish per &quot;dhoani&quot; per day. Traditionally, the fishermen return to the island by nightfall; however, with the advent of mechanized &quot;dhoani&quot;, they are generally back by the early afternoon. Skipjack tuna and yellowfin tuna are the most common species caught in Maldives.

===Industrial fishing===
Mechanization of the traditional sailing &quot;dhoani&quot; in 1974 changed the fishing industry of the Maldives. A new generation of dhoani, designed especially for mechanization, was introduced. A fish-canning factory was set up in 1977 as a joint venture with a Japanese company. However, when the government took over the plant in 1982, it was unable to meet the overseas demand due to the condition of buildings and equipment, so a new factory was opened in 1986. In 1979, Maldives Nippon Corporation was formed, in partnership with the Marubeni Corporation of Japan, to process and can fresh tuna. In the same year, the Maldives Fisheries Corporation (MFC) was formed to exploit the fish industry. The MFC later became the Fisheries Projects Implementation Department (FPID), which was transformed into MIFCO in 1993.

When the Japanese pulled out, the government negotiated a deal to buy the three freezer and six collector vessels that belonged to them, which then became part of the State Trading Organization (STO) fleet. However, by the time that STO inherited the Japanese fleet; the vessels were over twenty years old. A new fleet of vessels was acquired. Three mother ships were built in Korea and nine collector vessels were constructed in Malé. A boat yard was built on the island of Alifushi and the construction of one hundred second-generation Mark II &quot;dhoanis&quot; was begun. These dhoanis were sold to the fishermen on a lease-purchase basis. The opening up of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), for fisheries proved to be a boon to the country&#x27;s fishing industry.

===Fish cannery===
The first fish canning plant was established on the island of Felivaru, as a joint venture with a Japanese firm, in 1977. In 1982, the government took over the cannery, but the condition of the original buildings, equipment seriously limited production, and the cannery was not able to meet the increasing demand of an expanding overseas market. In 1987, a new cannery and cooling/freezing plant opened. The work was done by the NORAD project (Norwegians and Englishmen). The Norwegians built the buildings, while the Englishmen worked the unsteady ground underneath. The plant was fully opened between September and October 1987. The new Felivaru Tuna Processing Plant has its own electricity, a desalination plant, water storage tanks and an ice making plant. While this 150,000 cans per hour plant increased production, it was still unable to meet the rising overseas demand for Maldive tuna.

==Tourism==
===Development===
White sandy beaches, clear waters, and waving palms under blue skies make Maldives a tourist destination. Tourism was introduced to the Maldives in the early 1970s. The first two resort islands had a capacity of 280 beds. The first tourists arrived mostly as individuals or small groups. Soon, Maldives began to be recognized as an international tourist destination.

In 1972, the first tourist resort, Kurumba Village (a five star hotel as of now), was pioneered by two Maldivian entrepreneurs in association with an Italian investor. A second resort was opened the same year on the island of Bandos. Despite conditions of facilities and services, 1,096 tourist arrivals were recorded that year.

At the start, the country&#x27;s tourism and its development was for the most part dependent on private initiative. In 1979, the tourism law was enacted, requiring all foreign investments to be registered at the Department of Tourism and Foreign Investment. A tourism plan was formulated in 1983, creating guidelines for the overall development of tourism, and identifying tourism zones in different parts of the country. In 1984, the tourism advisory board was created. The department of tourism was upgraded to a ministry in 1988.

The opening of Malé International Airport in 1981 was a milestone in the travel business. At the early stages, tourism in Maldives was a seasonal industry. As the country opened up further, this seasonal nature of tourism changed. In the early 21st century tourist arrivals were recorded throughout the year. During 1987, a school of hotel and catering was established to meet the manpower requirements of the industry. Both government and private sector provide overseas training to those employed in the industry.

The private sector and the government are actively involved in the promotion and marketing of the tourism product. Maldives is represented in all major international travel fairs by both the government and the private operators. The tourist information counter at the Malé International Airport hands out leaflets and other information about the country. The Tourist Information Unit was formed in 1989 to further disseminate information.

The development of tourism has fostered the overall growth of the country&#x27;s economy. It has created direct and indirect employment and income generation opportunities in other related industries. Today, tourism is the country&#x27;s biggest foreign exchange earner, contributing nearly a fifth of the GDP.

With 86 tourist resorts in operation, the year 2000 recorded 467,154 tourist arrivals.

===Tourist facilities===
Each tourist resort is situated on an uninhabited island. The islands are self-contained, with its own electricity, water and waste disposal facilities. The islands are developed according to the standards and guidelines set by the Ministry of Tourism. While all modern facilities are available, the islands retain its unique natural beauty. The designs feature local architectural concepts as well as international style. A variety of services and facilities are available to guests, to make visits comfortable, pleasant and memorable.

===Maldives Tourism Promotion Board===
The Maldives Tourism Promotion Board was established by the government to promote quality and sustainable growth in the country&#x27;s tourism industry and to foster a well utilized and financially healthy private sector industry. - in this way enabling the industry to deliver long-term economic, social and cultural benefits to the people of Maldives, whilst at the same time contributing to enhancements in Maldives’ marine environment to the benefit of the people and visitors of the Maldives.

=== MATI ===
Maldives Association of Tourism Industry (MATI) is a non-profit non-governmental organization working towards the sustainable development of the country&#x27;s tourism industry. Its membership is open to those engaged in the travel trade business. MATI coordinates its activities with the government and work in partnership with other national and international organizations.
