<text>A pro-drop language (from &quot;pronoun-dropping&quot;) is a language in which certain classes of pronouns may be omitted when they can be pragmatically or grammatically inferable. The precise conditions vary from language to language, and can be quite intricate. The phenomenon of &quot;pronoun-dropping&quot; is part of the larger topic of zero or null anaphora. The connection between pro-drop languages and null anaphora relates to the fact that a dropped pronoun has referential properties, and so is crucially not a null dummy pronoun.

Pro-drop is a problem when translating to a non-pro-drop language such as English, which requires the pronoun to be added, especially noticeable in machine translation. It can also contribute to transfer errors in language learning.

An areal feature of some European languages is that pronoun dropping is not, or seldom, possible (see Standard Average European); this is the case for English, French, German, and Emilian dialect, among others. In contrast, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Slavic languages, Finno-Ugric languages, Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, Kra-Dai languages, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese exhibit frequent pro-drop features. Some languages, such as Greek and Hindi also exhibit pro-drop in any argument.

==Usage of term==

In Noam Chomsky&#x27;s &quot;Lectures on Government and Binding&quot;, the term is used for a cluster of properties of which &quot;null subject&quot; was one (for the occurrence of &quot;pro&quot; as a predicate rather than a subject in sentences with the copula see Moro 1997).

Thus, a one-way correlation was suggested between inflectional agreement (AGR) and empty pronouns on the one hand and between no agreement and overt pronouns, on the other. In the classical version, languages which not only lack agreement morphology but also allow extensive dropping of pronouns—such as Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese—are not included, as is made clear in a footnote: &quot;The principle suggested is fairly general, but does not apply to such languages as Japanese in which pronouns can be missing much more freely.&quot; (Chomsky 1981:284, fn 47).

The term pro-drop is also used in other frameworks in generative grammar, such as in lexical functional grammar (LFG), but in a more general sense: &quot;Pro-drop is a widespread linguistic phenomenon in which, under certain conditions, a structural NP may be unexpressed, giving rise to a pronominal interpretation.&quot; (Bresnan 1982:384).

The empty category assumed (under government and binding theory) to be present in the vacant subject position left by pro-dropping is known as &quot;pro&quot;, or as &quot;little pro&quot; (to distinguish it from &quot;big PRO&quot;, an empty category associated with non-finite verb phrases).

==Cross-linguistic variation==
It has been observed that pro-drop languages are those with either rich inflection for person and number (Persian, Polish, Czech, Portuguese, etc.) or no such inflection at all (Japanese, Chinese, Korean, etc.), but languages that are intermediate (English, French) are non-pro-drop.

While the mechanism by which overt pronouns are more &quot;useful&quot; in English than in Japanese is obscure, and there are exceptions to this observation, it still seems to have considerable descriptive validity. As Huang puts it, &quot;Pro-drop is licensed to occur either where a language has full agreement, or where a language has no agreement, but not where a language has impoverished partial agreement.&quot;

In pro-drop languages with a highly inflected verbal morphology, the expression of the subject pronoun is considered unnecessary because the verbal inflection indicates the person and number of the subject, thus the referent of the null subject can be inferred from the grammatical inflection on the verb.

Barbosa defines these typological patterns as null-subject languages (NSL), expressing that the term itself, pro-drop, can be subcategorized into categories such as: topic (discourse) pro-drop, partial NSL (partial pro-drop) and consistent NSL (full pro-drop).

==Topic pro-drop languages==
In everyday speech there are instances when who or what is being referred to — namely, the topic of the sentence — can be inferred from context. Languages which permit the pronoun to be inferred from contextual information are called topic-drop (also known as discourse pro-drop) languages: thus, topic pro-drop languages allow referential pronouns to be omitted, or be phonologically null. (In contrast, languages that lack topic pro-drop as a mechanism would still require the pronoun.) These dropped pronouns can be inferred from previous discourse, from the context of the conversation, or generally shared knowledge. Among major languages, some which might be called topic pro-drop languages are Japanese, Korean, and Mandarin. Topic prominent languages like Korean, Mandarin and Japanese have structures which focus more on topics and comments as opposed to English, a subject-prominent language. It is this topic-first nature that enables the inference of omitted pronouns from discourse.

=== Korean ===
The following example from Jung (2004:719) Korean shows the omission of both pronouns in the subject and object position.

=== Japanese ===

Consider the following examples from Japanese:

The words in parentheses and boldface in the English translations (&quot;it&quot; in the first line; &quot;I&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, and &quot;it&quot; in the second) appear nowhere in the Japanese sentences but are understood from context. If nouns or pronouns were supplied, the resulting sentences would be grammatically correct but sound unnatural. Learners of Japanese as a second language, especially those whose first language is non-pro-drop like English or French, often supply personal pronouns where they are pragmatically inferable, an example of language transfer.

=== Mandarin ===

The above-mentioned examples from Japanese are readily rendered into Mandarin:

Unlike in Japanese, the inclusion of the dropped pronouns does not make the sentence sound unnatural.

==Partial pro-drop languages==

Languages with partial pro-drop have both agreement and referential null subjects that are restricted with respect to their distribution. The partial null-subject languages include most Balto-Slavic languages, which allow for the deletion of the subject pronoun. Hungarian allows deletion of both the subject and object pronouns.

=== Slavic languages ===
The following table provides examples of subject pro-drop in Slavic languages. In each of these examples, the 3rd person masculine singular pronoun &#x27;he&#x27; in the second sentence is inferred from context.

In the East Slavic languages even the objective pronoun &quot;его&quot; can be omitted in the present and future tenses (both imperfect and perfective). In these languages, the missing pronoun is not inferred strictly from pragmatics, but partially indicated by the morphology of the verb (Вижу, Виждам, Widzę, Vidim, etc...). However, the past tense of both imperfective and perfective in modern East Slavic languages inflects by gender and number rather than the person due to the fact that the present tense conjugations of the copula &quot;to be&quot; (Russian &quot;быть&quot;, Ukrainian &quot;бути&quot;, Belarusian &quot;быць&quot;) have practically fallen out of use. As such, the pronoun is often included in these tenses, especially in writing.

===Finno-Ugric languages===
In Finnish, the verb inflection replaces first- and second-person pronouns in simple sentences: &quot;menen&quot; &quot;I go&quot;, &quot;menette&quot; &quot;all of you go&quot;. Pronouns are typically left in place only when they need to be inflected, e.g. &quot;me&quot; &quot;we&quot;, &quot;meiltä&quot; &quot;from us&quot;. There are possessive pronouns but possessive suffixes, e.g. &quot;-ni&quot; as in &quot;kissani&quot; &quot;my cat&quot;, are also used, as in &quot;Kissani söi kalan&quot; (&quot;my cat ate a fish&quot;). A peculiarity of Colloquial Finnish is that the pronoun &quot;me&quot; (&quot;we&quot;) can be dropped if the verb is placed in the passive voice (e.g. &quot;haetaan&quot;, Standard &quot;it is fetched&quot;, colloquial &quot;we fetch&quot;). Estonian, a close relative of Finnish, has a tendency that is less clear. Literary Estonian generally uses explicit personal pronouns in the literary language, but they are often omitted in colloquial Estonian.

Hungarian is also pro-drop, and subject pronouns are used only for emphasis: &quot;(Én) mentem&quot; &quot;I went&quot;. Because of the definite conjugation, object pronouns can be often elided as well. For example, the question &quot;(Ti) látjátok a macskát?&quot; &quot;Do (you pl.) see the cat?&quot; can be answered with just &quot;látjuk&quot; &quot;(We) see (it)&quot; because the definite conjugation renders the object pronoun superfluous.

===Hebrew===
Modern Hebrew, like Biblical Hebrew, is a &quot;moderately&quot; pro-drop language. In general, subject pronouns must be included in the present tense. Since Hebrew has no verb forms expressing the present tense, the present tense is formed by using the present participle (somewhat like English &quot;I am guarding&quot;). The Hebrew participle , as is the case with other adjectives, declines only in grammatical gender and number (like the &quot;past&quot; tense in Russian), thus:

:I (m.) guard (&quot;ani shomer&quot;) = 

:You (m.) guard (&quot;ata shomer&quot;) = 

:He guards (&quot;hu shomer&quot;) = 

:I (f.) guard (&quot;ani shomeret&quot;) = 

:We (m.) guard (&quot;anachnu shomrim&quot;) = 

Since the forms that are used for the present tense lack the distinction between grammatical persons, explicit pronouns must be added in most cases.

In contrast, the past tense and the future tense the verb form is inflected for person, number, and gender. Therefore, the verb form itself indicates sufficient information about the subject. The subject pronoun is therefore normally dropped, except in third-person.

: I (m./f.) guarded (&quot;shamarti&quot;) = 

:You (m. pl.) guarded (&quot;sh&#x27;martem&quot;) = 

:I (m./f.) will guard (&quot;eshmor&quot;) = 

:You (pl./m.) will guard (&quot;tishm&#x27;ru&quot;) = 

Many nouns can take suffixes to reflect the possessor in which case the personal pronoun is dropped. In daily usage, the inflection of Modern Hebrew nouns is common only for some nouns. In most cases, inflected possessive pronouns are used. In Hebrew, possessive pronouns are treated mostly like adjectives and follow the nouns which they modify. In Biblical Hebrew, inflection of more sophisticated nouns is more common than in modern usage.

== Full pro-drop languages ==
Full pro-drop languages, also known as consistent NSLs, are languages that are characterized by rich subject agreement morphology where subjects are freely dropped under the appropriate discourse conditions. In some contexts, pro-drop in these languages is mandatory and also occurs in contexts in which pro-drop cannot happen for partial pro-drop languages. The following languages exhibit full pro-drop in their own distinct ways.

=== Hindi ===
South Asian languages such as Hindi, in general, have the ability to pro-drop any and all arguments. Hindi is a split-ergative language and when the subject of the sentence is in the ergative case (also when the sentence involves the infinitive participle, which requires the subject to be in the dative case), the verb of the sentence agrees in gender and number with the object of the sentence, hence making it possible to drop the object since it can be contextually inferred from the gender of the verb.

In the example below, the subject is in the ergative case and the verb agrees in number and gender with the direct object.



In the example below, the subject is in the dative case and the verb agrees in number and gender with the direct object.



In the example below, the subject is in the nominative case and the verb agrees in number, gender, and also in person with the subject.



=== Greek ===

Subject pronouns are usually omitted in Greek, but the verb is inflected for the person and number of the subject. Example:

=== Romance languages ===

Like their parent Latin, most Romance languages (with the notable exception of French) are categorised as pro-drop as well, though generally only in the case of subject pronouns. Unlike in Japanese, however, the missing subject pronoun is not inferred strictly from pragmatics, but partially indicated by the morphology of the verb, which inflects for person and number of the subject. Spanish, Italian, Romanian, Catalan and Occitan can elide subject pronouns only (Portuguese sometimes elides object pronouns as well), and they often do so even when the referent has not been mentioned. This is helped by person/number inflection on the verb. The 3rd person singular and plural subject pronouns are often kept to denote and differentiate male and female subjects/genders.

====Spanish====
In Spanish, the verb is inflected for both person and number, thus expression of the pronoun is unnecessary because it is grammatically redundant. In the following example, the inflection on the verb &quot;ver,&quot; &#x27;see&#x27;, signals informal 2nd person singular, thus the pronoun is dropped. Similarly, from both the context and verbal morphology, the listener can infer that the second two utterances are referring to the log, so the speaker omits the pronoun that would appear in English as &quot;it.&quot; 


Although Spanish is a predominantly pro-drop language, not all grammatical contexts allow for a null pronoun. There are some environments that require an overt pronoun. In contrast, there are also grammatical environments that require a null pronoun. According to the &quot;Real Academia Española&quot;, the expression or elision of the subject pronoun is not random. Rather there are contexts in which an overt pronoun is abnormal, but in other cases, the overt pronoun is possible or even required. Further, the examples below illustrate how overt pronouns in Spanish are not constrained by inflectional morphology. The pronoun &quot;nosotros&quot; can be either present or absent, depending on certain discourse conditions:

The third person pronouns (&quot;él, ella, ellos&quot;, &quot;ellas&quot;) in most contexts can only refer to persons. Therefore, when referring to things (that are not people) an explicit pronoun is usually disallowed.

Subject pronouns can be made explicit when used for a contrastive function or when the subject is the focus of the sentence. In the following example, the first person explicit pronoun is used to emphasize the subject. In the next sentence the explicit &quot;yo&quot;, stressed that the opinion is from the speaker and not from the second person or another person.
 
Subject pronouns can also be made explicit in order to clarify ambiguities that arise due to verb forms that are homophonous in the first person and third person. For example, in the past imperfect, conditional, and subjunctive, the verb forms are the same for first person singular and third person singular. In these situations, using the explicit pronoun &quot;yo&quot; (1st person singular) or &quot;él, ella&quot; (3rd person singular) clarifies who the subject is, since the verbal morphology is ambiguous.

====Italian====

Italian further demonstrates full pro-drop by allowing for the possibility of a salient, referential, definite subject of finite clauses. With respect to the Null subject parameter (NSP), this will be analyzed using the phrase &#x27;S/he speaks Italian.&#x27;

Italian has a [+] value:
:&quot;Parla italiano&quot;. (Italian, +NSP)

A non pro-drop language, such as English, has a [-] value for NSP and thus does not allow for that possibility:
: *Speaks Italian. (English, -NSP)

====Portuguese====
Portuguese displays full pro-drop by allowing subjects of finite clauses to be phonetically null:

Provided this example, it is important to note that variations of Portuguese can differ with respect to their pro-drop features. While European Portuguese (EP) is a full pro-drop language, Brazilian Portuguese (BP) exhibits partial pro-drop. The two are compared below, respectively:

Examples of omitted subject:

Omission of object pronouns is likewise possible when the referent is clear, especially in colloquial or informal language:

The use of the object pronoun in these examples (&quot;aceitá-la&quot;, &quot;comeu-o&quot;) is the default everywhere but Brazil.

Here &quot;não me achou&quot; would also be possible.

Omission of the object pronoun is possible even when its referent has not been explicitly mentioned, so long as it can be inferred. The next example might be heard at a store; the referent (a dress) is clear to the interlocutor. In both Brazilian and European Portuguese the pronoun is omitted.

==== Pro-drop with locative and partitive ====
&quot;Modern&quot; Spanish and Portuguese are also notable amongst Romance languages because they have no specific pronouns for circumstantial complements (arguments denoting circumstance, consequence, place or manner, modifying the verb but not directly involved in the action) or partitives (words or phrases denoting a quantity of something). However, both languages had them during the Middle Ages: Portuguese &quot;hi&quot; and &quot;ende&quot;.

Compare the following examples in which Spanish, Portuguese, Galician, and Romanian have null pronouns for place and partitives, but Catalan, French, Occitan, and Italian have overt pronouns for place and partitive. 

==Other examples==

===Arabic===
Arabic is considered a null-subject language, as demonstrated by the following example:

=== Turkish ===
The subject &quot;I&quot; above is easily inferable as the verb &quot;gör-mek&quot; &quot;to see&quot; is conjugated in the first person simple past tense form. The object is indicated by the pronoun &quot;seni&quot; in this case. Strictly speaking, pronominal objects are generally explicitly indicated, although frequently possessive suffixes indicate the equivalent of an object in English, as in the following sentence.

In this sentence, the object of the verb is actually the action of coming performed by the speaker (&quot;geldiğimi&quot; &quot;my coming&quot;), but the object in the English sentence, &quot;me&quot;, is indicated here by the possessive suffix -im &quot;my&quot; on the nominalised verb. Both pronouns can be explicitly indicated in the sentence for purposes of emphasis, as follows:

=== Swahili ===
In Swahili, both subject and object pronouns can be omitted as they are indicated by verbal prefixes.

===English===

English is not a pro-drop language, but subject pronouns are almost always dropped in imperative sentences (e.g., &quot;Come here!&quot; &quot;Do tell!&quot; &quot;Eat your vegetables!&quot;), with the subject &quot;you&quot; understood or communicated non-verbally.

In informal speech, the pronominal subject is sometimes dropped. The ellipsis has been called &quot;conversational deletion&quot; and &quot;left-edge deletion&quot;, and is common in informal spoken English as well as certain registers of written English, notably diaries. Most commonly, it is the first person singular subject which is dropped.

Some other words, especially copulas and auxiliaries, can also be dropped.

*&quot;[Have you] ever been there?&quot;
*&quot;[I&#x27;m] going shopping. [Do you] want to come?&quot;
*&quot;[I] haven&#x27;t been there yet. [I&#x27;m] going later.&quot;
*Seen on signs: &quot;[I am/We are] out to lunch; [I/we shall be] back at 1:00 [P.M].&quot;
*&quot;What do you think [of it]?&quot; – &quot;I like [it]!&quot; (the latter only in some dialects and registers)
*&quot;[Do you] want a piece of cake?&quot;
*&quot;[You] are not!&quot; – &quot;[I] am too!&quot; This pattern is also common with other tenses (e.g., &quot;were&quot;, &quot;will&quot;) and verbs (e.g., &quot;do/did&quot;, &quot;have/had&quot;).

In speech, when pronouns are not dropped, they are more often reduced than other words in an utterance.

Relative pronouns, provided they are not the subject, are often dropped in short restrictive clauses: &quot;That&#x27;s the man [whom] I saw.&quot;

The dropping of pronouns is generally restricted to very informal speech and certain fixed expressions, and the rules for their use are complex and vary among dialects and registers. A noted instance was the &quot;lived the dream&quot; section of George H. W. Bush&#x27;s speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention.

===German===

Colloquial and dialectal German, unlike the standard language, are also partially pro-drop and typically allow deletion of the subject pronoun only in main clauses without inversion. German has personal inflections of verbs, which makes pro-drop sentences easier to understand.

===South Asia===
In the South Asian linguistic area, along with few specialized Indo-Aryan languages like Marathi, Kashmiri are pro-drop; many Tibeto-Burman languages and most Munda languages (except Korku) are generally pro-drop, since both subjects and objects of intransitive and transitive verbs are indexed into the verb itself.

Limbu (Kiranti, Sino-Tibetan):
Juang (South Munda, Austroasiatic):
==Other language families and linguistic regions==
Among the Indo-European and Dravidian languages of India, pro-drop is the general rule though many Dravidian languages do not have overt verbal markers to indicate pronominal subjects. Mongolic languages are similar in this respect to Dravidian languages, and all Paleosiberian languages are rigidly pro-drop.

Outside of northern Europe, most Niger–Congo languages, Khoisan languages of Southern Africa and Austronesian languages of the Western Pacific, pro-drop is the usual pattern in almost all linguistic regions of the world. In many non-pro-drop Niger–Congo or Austronesian languages, like Igbo, Samoan and Fijian, however, subject pronouns do not occur in the same position as a nominal subject and are obligatory even when the latter occurs. In more easterly Austronesian languages, like Rapa Nui and Hawaiian, subject pronouns are often omitted even though no other subject morphemes exist. Pama–Nyungan languages of Australia also typically omit subject pronouns even when there is no explicit expression of the subject.

Many Pama–Nyungan languages, however, have clitics, which often attach to nonverbal hosts to express subjects. The other languages of Northwestern Australia are all pro-drop, for all classes of pronoun. Also, Papuan languages of New Guinea and Nilo-Saharan languages of East Africa are pro-drop.

Among the indigenous languages of the Americas, pro-drop is almost universal, as would be expected from the generally polysynthetic and head-marking character of the languages. That generally allows eliding of all object pronouns as well as subject ones. Indeed, most reports on Native American languages show that even the emphatic use of pronouns is exceptionally rare. Only a few Native American languages, mostly language isolates (Haida, Trumai, Wappo) and the Oto-Manguean family are known for normally using subject pronouns.

Yahgan, an extinct language isolate from Tierra del Fuego, had no pro-drop when it was still spoken widely in the late 19th century, when it was first described grammatically and had texts translated from English and other languages (three biblical New Testament texts: Luke, John, and Acts of the Apostles). In fact, emphatic pronouns and cross-reference pronouns on the verb commonly appeared together.

===Pragmatic inference===
Classical Chinese exhibits extensive dropping not only of pronouns but also of any terms (subjects, verbs, objects, etc.) that are pragmatically inferable, which gives a very compact character to the language. Note, however, that Classical Chinese was a written language, and such word dropping is not necessarily representative of the spoken language or even of the same linguistic phenomenon.

<text>A knock-down kit (also knockdown kit, knocked-down kit, or simply knockdown or KD) is a collection of parts required to assemble a product. The parts are typically manufactured in one country or region, and then exported to another country or region for final assembly. CBU, on the other hand, stands for &quot;Completely Built Up&quot; and signifies import of a finished product.

==Definitions==

A common form of knock-down is a complete knock-down (CKD), which is a kit of entirely unassembled parts of a product. It is also a method of supplying parts to a market, particularly in shipping to foreign nations, and serves as a way of counting or pricing. CKD is a common practice in the automotive, bus, heavy truck, and rail vehicle industries, as well as electronics, furniture and other products. Businesses sell knocked-down kits to their foreign affiliates or licensees for various reasons, including the avoidance of import taxes, to receive tax preferences for providing local manufacturing jobs, or even to be considered as a bidder at all (for example, in public transport projects with &quot;buy national&quot; rules).

A semi-knocked-down kit (SKD) or incompletely disassembled kit (although it has never been assembled) is a kit of the partially assembled parts of a product. Both types of KDs, complete and incomplete, are collectively referred to within the auto industry as knocked-down export (KDX), and cars assembled in the country of origin and exported whole to the destination market are known as built-up export (BUX).

Technically, the terms &quot;knock-down&quot;, &quot;incompletely disassembled kit&quot;, and &quot;kits of parts&quot; are all misnomers because the knock-downs were never built up in the first place. The parts shipments are often not in the form of kits, but rather bulk-packed by type of part into shipping containers. The degree of &quot;knock-down&quot; depends on the desires and technical abilities of the receiving organization or government import regulations. Developing nations may pursue trade and economic policies that call for import substitution or local content regulations. Companies with CKD operations help the country substitute the finished products it imports with locally assembled substitutes.

Knock-down kit assembly plants are less expensive to establish and maintain because they do not need modern robotic equipment, and the workforce may be less costly than in the country of origin. The plants may also be effective for low-volume production. The CKD concept allows firms in developing markets to gain expertise in a particular industry. At the same time, the CKD kit exporting company gains new markets that would otherwise be closed.

==Automotive==
In the automotive industry, the most basic form of a vehicle in the KD kit lacks the wheels, internal combustion engine, transmission, and battery. They are either supplied as &quot;parts&quot; for assembly (a &quot;complete&quot; kit) or obtained from third parties (an &quot;incomplete&quot; kit); all of the interiors are already installed at the originating factory. The term SKD for semi-knocked-down refers to a kit with a complete, welded car body, usually coated or already painted. To gain extra tax preferences, the manufacturer needs to &quot;localize&quot; the car further, i.e., increase the share of parts produced by local manufacturers, such as tires, wheels, seats, headlights, windscreens and glass, batteries, interior plastics, etc., even down to the engine and transmission. At some point, the steel body could be pressed, welded, and painted locally, effectively making KD assembly only a few steps away from full-scale production.

By the time Henry Ford co-wrote his 1922 memoir, &quot;My Life and Work&quot;, the Ford Motor Company was already shipping car parts from its Michigan plants for final assembly in the regions of the United States or foreign countries where the cars would be sold.

During World War II, a significant number of US- and Canadian-built vehicles, most notably light and heavy trucks like Willys MB/Ford GPW/GPA, GMC-353/CCKW, and vehicles from the CMP family, were crated and shipped overseas in KD form, in various degrees of completeness, to Allied countries to sustain their war effort. Assembly lines were preferably set up in local automotive factories where appropriate tooling and equipment could be easily found, but, where needed, other types of buildings could be used, especially in on-the-field situations, and on occasion, even open-air rebuilding camps were set up, managed by military personnel. Owing to male mobilization, sometimes a female workforce was employed. CKD military vehicles could be stored for shipment in one-vehicle-per-crate form (or SUP, Single Unit Pack), or as several vehicles (usually two to three) divided in two or more crates. Vehicles shipped to certain countries could be lacking some items, such as cabs, beds, or tires, that were built and provided locally.

Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Limited in India began its business in 1947 with assembling CKD Jeeps. Mahindra expanded its operations to include domestic manufacture of Jeep vehicles with a high level of local content under license from Kaiser Jeep Corporation and later American Motors Corporation (AMC).

In the 1950s and 1960s, Lotus Cars sold its Lotus Seven car in CKD form to avoid the UK purchase tax that applied to sales of fully assembled vehicles.

By 1959, and with the introduction of the Mini, British Motor Corporation (BMC) products were still either imported or assembled from CKD kits in several international markets.

In 1961, Renault began negotiations for a first partnership agreement with AMC to assemble Rambler automobiles in Europe. Beginning in 1962, and continuing until 1967, AMC also sold CKD kits of its passenger cars to Renault. They were assembled in Renault&#x27;s factory in Haren, Belgium, and sold through its dealers in Algeria, Austria, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. The deal allowed AMC to sell its cars in new markets without significant foreign direct investment (FDI). The arrangement benefited the French automaker because its product range lacked large-sized cars, and it needed to offer an &quot;executive&quot; model for its European markets. The situation changed by 1977. By this time, AMC sought outside support for a new car in the sub-compact market segment, which led to the first of many agreements with Renault.

Volvo&#x27;s Halifax Assembly Plant, which opened in 1963, completed vehicles in CKD form from Sweden for North American consumers. Halifax Assembly closed in December 1998.

In 1967, Rootes Group UK began exporting CKD Hillman Hunters to Iran where they were sold as the Paykan (meaning &quot;arrow&quot; in Persian). Bought by Chrysler in 1967 and then part of the sale to the PSA Group by the Chrysler Corporation of its European operations in late 1978, the Rootes business basis in Iran became the primer for the very significant PSA Peugeot Citroën business in Iran involving engine and CKD deliveries, particularly from the 405, introduced in 1990 and facelifted as the Pars in 1999 and 206 introduced in 2001. In 2004, Peugeot&#x27;s partner Iran Khodro produced 281&#x27;000 Peugeot vehicles, securing a 36% market share.

In 1967 as well, Peugeot introduced CKD-based production of a light pick-up vehicle based on the Peugeot 403 in Peugeot&#x27;s Berazategui factory (in Buenos Aires) under the name Peugeot 4TB. In 1973, this model was replaced by the 404 pick-up and later (1990) by the 504 pick-up. The 404 and 504 were massively marketed worldwide through local CKD assembly shops: the 404 was assembled, besides France and Argentina, in Australia, Belgium, Canada (at the SOMA plant shared with Renault), Chile, Ireland, Kenya, Madagascar, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Portugal, Perú, Rhodesia, South Africa, and Uruguay; the 504, mainly in Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, South-Africa, Australia, and China by the Guangzhou Peugeot Automobile Company which developed a specific crew cab version.

In 1968, the independent German automotive firm, Karmann, began assembly of CKD kits of AMC&#x27;s newly introduced Javelin for distribution in Europe. American Motors also provided right-hand drive versions of their automobiles to markets such as Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The components were shipped in containers to Australia from AMC&#x27;s plants in Kenosha, Wisconsin, or Brampton, Ontario. Assembly of Rambler and AMC vehicles in Australia was done by Australian Motor Industries (AMI) in Port Melbourne, Victoria. Local content requirements were met by using Australian suppliers for the interiors (seats, carpeting, etc.) as well as for lights, heaters, and other components. Various Rambler models were assembled in New Zealand from the early 1960s until 1971 by Campbell Motors in Thames (later Toyota New Zealand), which had also built Toyota, Datsun (later known as Nissan), Hino, Renault, and Peugeot cars.

New Zealand had developed a car assembly industry as a means of import substitution and providing local employment, despite the small size of the local market. Following economic reforms in the 1980s, including the lowering of import tariffs, and the ability to import Australian-built vehicles duty-free under the CER agreement, many car companies ended assembly in New Zealand. They switched to importing completely built-up vehicles from Japan, Australia, or Europe. More significantly, the easing of import restrictions led to many used imports, because they were less expensive than locally assembled used cars, and outsold the &#x27;NZ New&#x27; vehicles. The last companies to construct CKD kits in New Zealand were Toyota, Nissan, Mitsubishi, and Honda, which closed their plants in 1998 when the government announced plans to abolish import tariffs on cars.

Other examples include Ukraine, which has almost prohibitive import taxes on finished cars. AutoZAZ assembles CKD kits of some Lada, Opel, Mercedes-Benz, and Daewoo cars. It went as far as adopting a version of Daewoo Lanos for full-scale production and equipping it with a domestic engine. The German automotive giant Volkswagen Group also produces SKDs in Ukraine at its Solomonovo plant, producing cars under its Škoda and Volkswagen Passenger Cars marques.

In Russia, KD assembling facilities are owned by Avtotor, which produced Hummer H2, BMW 3 Series, and BMW 5 Series in Kaliningrad, and Renault Logan in Moscow using facilities that once belonged to AZLK. In Kaluga, Volkswagen Group had a plant that was expected to have an annual output of 150,000 units.

Daimler AG has a CKD assembly plant in South Carolina that re-assembles Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans for sale in the United States and Canada at Mercedes-Benz and Freightliner dealers, along with Dodge dealers before Fiat Group&#x27;s takeover of Chrysler Group LLC—essentially to circumvent the 25% tariff on imported light trucks known as the &quot;Chicken Tax&quot;. The Sprinter was eventually replaced in the Dodge/Ram lineup with the similar Ram ProMaster, a rebadged Fiat Ducato. Unlike the CKD Dodge Sprinter, the ProMaster is fully imported to the U.S. from a Chrysler plant in Mexico under of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

In 2009, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Limited announced that it would export pickup trucks powered by diesel engines from India to the United States in knockdown kit (CKD) form, again to circumvent the chicken tax. Mahindra planned to export CKDs to the United States as complete vehicles that will be assembled in the United States from kits of parts shipped in crates. However, Mahindra&#x27;s United States CKD and export plans never materialized and were subject to several lawsuits.

In 2013, Tesla started operating an assembly plant in Tilburg, the Netherlands. It is used for the assembly of their Model S sedan and Model X SUV for the European Union, but not all of Europe since only cars imported to the EU benefit from circumventing the 10% import duty (e.g. cars to Norway are shipped directly from the United States). For the most part, the car is still manufactured in the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California. During the final assembly in the Netherlands, various parts are added to the car, most notably the rear subframe with the drive train as well as the battery pack.

==Buses==

Motor Coach Industries opened its Pembina, North Dakota, assembly plant in 1963, as part of an expansion into the US market. Unfinished KD (knocked down) coach bodies are shipped from Winnipeg, Manitoba, by flatbed trailer and completed, outfitted, and delivered at Pembina. This practice simplifies US Customs and meets the &quot;Buy America Act&quot; provisions (49 USC 5323(j) and 49 CFR Part 661) for public agencies purchasing new equipment with federal funds.

North American Bus Industries opened operations in Anniston, Alabama, in 1993, with incomplete buses shipped from Budapest, Hungary, to Anniston for final assembly. NABI expanded production operations in Anniston to allow full production with its first fully domestically produced bus unit in 2008.

==Rail==

The practice of selling &quot;knocked down&quot; railcars, called by that name, pre-dates the 20th century, as evidenced by an advertisement by JG Brill Company in the &quot;Street Railway Journal&quot; from 1898.

Many rail equipment builders have used kits or incomplete vehicles, often to meet local assembly and production requirements or quotas, or to satisfy tariffs. Some examples include:
*Between 1938 and 1951, the St Louis Car Company shipped PCC streetcar body shells and trucks north for assembly by Canadian Car &amp; Foundry. The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) PCC fleet was purchased and delivered in this method.
*Bombardier ships incomplete cars from its plant at La Pocatière Quebec, to Plattsburgh, New York, and (until 2002) Barre, Vermont, facilities for final assembly. These are to meet Buy America Act provisions for US public transit agencies and tariff rules. Since 2009 the Plattsburgh assembly plant has had full stainless steel welding and fabrication capability, allowing for cars to be fully assembled and completed on-site.
*Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) and CSR Qingdao Sifang has a joint venture assembly plant in Qingdao, China, that carried out final assembly of first 10 sets of China Railways CRH2 high-speed trains, itself derived from E2 Series Shinkansen, using parts shipped from Kobe, Japan. Later the plant was tasked with the local manufacturing of further CRH2 train orders, through technology transfer from Japan.
*Alstom&#x27;s Hornell, New York, assembly plant produces final completed cars using stainless body assemblies shipped from the Lapa plant in São Paulo, Brazil. Morrison-Knudsen used the same production method when it built new passenger cars at the Hornell shops in the 1990s.
*From their first US order from the South Shore Line in 1982 until the opening of a full-body manufacturing and assembly line in Rochelle, Illinois, thirty years later, Nippon Sharyo sent commuter train bodies from Japan to US finishers, including an American unit of Sumitomo.
*Hyundai Rotem opened an assembly facility in South Philadelphia, located in an industrial park off Columbus Boulevard. Car shells are assembled, outfitted, and completed for delivery at this site, which is served by Conrail on the Philadelphia Belt Line, allowing delivery of new cars by rail. The Silverliner V cars for Denver&#x27;s RTD commuter rail and Philadelphia&#x27;s SEPTA Regional Rail were purchased and delivered in this method.
*The London Underground 1995 and 1996 Stock fleets have aluminium bodies built by Alstom in Barcelona with assembly completed at the Metro-Cammell works in Washwood Heath, Birmingham.
*British Rail Class 385 fleets have aluminum bodies built by Hitachi in Kasado, Japan, with assembly completed at the Newton Aycliffe works in Country Durham.
*Taiwan Rolling Stock Company&#x27;s assembly plant in Hsinchu County, Taiwan has assembled several rolling stock models using knock-down kits from Hitachi Rail Italy (EMU101 trains for Taipei Metro Circular Line), Kawasaki Heavy Industries (Taipei Metro C371, C381 and Taoyuan Metro 1000 series) and Nippon Sharyo (TRA EMU700 and EMU800 series)

==Aircraft==
Unserviceable military aircraft are also sold as &quot;knock-downs&quot; after they have ended their service life, packaging them with serviceable aircraft. This allows them to be used for cannibalization of spare parts.

The European aircraft manufacturer Airbus uses knock-down kits to assemble A320 family aircraft outside Europe. The Airbus A320 final assembly line in Tianjin, China, assembles fuselage, wing, and tail sections made in Europe with avionics and engines made in the EU or the United States and locally sourced components for interiors. Airbus opened a similar A320 final assembly line in the United States in September 2015, located in Mobile, Alabama; again using European-made fuselages, wings, and tail sections. However, the Mobile final assembly line will use more locally sourced components than the Tianjin line; engines, interior components, and avionics will be sourced mainly from American suppliers. Both the Airbus Tianjin and Mobile plants receive their fuselages, wings, and tail sections from Europe via ocean freight using specially designed ships, as the plants are located in port cities.

==Housing==

From 1908 to 1940, the Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. mail-order catalog offered over 400 styles of homes. Buyers were provided with all of the materials and the instructions needed to build a house. Everything that arrived by train or in the mail was designed to fit together, therefore buyers could build the houses themselves or hire contractors. Sears sourced building materials at a high volume, thus keeping prices low and competitive with the local builders.

==Furniture==

Knock-down furniture dates back to at least the mid-19th century, with the 1859 Thonet No. 14 chair bentwood chair being easily disassembled for transportation. In the late 1940s, Australian designer Frederick Charles Ward founded a mail-order business for knock-down furniture in response to a lack of affordable furniture.

Swedish furniture company IKEA began selling flat-pack furniture in 1956.

<text>Neve Yaakov (; also &quot;Neve Ya&#x27;aqov&quot;, lit. Jacob&#x27;s Oasis) is an Israeli settlement in East Jerusalem, part of the Israeli-occupied territories, north of the settlement of Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev and south of the Palestinian locality of al-Ram. Established in 1924 during the period of the British Mandate, it was depopulated during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The area was captured by Israel in the Six-Day War and a new neighborhood was built nearby, at which time international opposition to its legitimacy began. The international community considers Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this, defining it as a neighborhood within the jurisdiction of the Jerusalem Municipality, which provides all services. The population of Neve Yaakov is 23,300. Neve Yaakov is one of the Ring Settlements of East Jerusalem. The settlement is also the location of the IDF&#x27;s Central Command for the West Bank, Jerusalem, Sharon, Gush Dan and Shephelah.

==History==

Neve Yaakov was established in 1924 on a parcel of land purchased from Arabs from nearby Beit Hanina by members of the American Mizrachi movement. HaKfar HaIvri Neve Yaakov (The Jewish Village of Neve Yaakov) was named for the leader of the movement, Rabbi Yitzchak Yaacov Reines (1839–1915). It was an hour&#x27;s walk to the Old City, where most Jews of Jerusalem lived at the time. Until they were abandoned in 1948, Neve Yaakov and Atarot were the only Jewish settlements north of the Old City.

The first houses were ready for occupancy in the summer of 1925. The village&#x27;s rav, Rabbi Yitzchak Avigdor Orenstein, ruled that new homeowners could move into their homes even during The Nine Days, saying that the mitzvah of settling the Land of Israel overrode the laws of the mourning period. Rabbi Orenstein himself moved into his new house during The Nine Days, while village administrator Dov Brinker moved his furniture and belongings into his new house on Tisha B&#x27;Av itself.

The village, home to 150 families, suffered from financial problems and lack of a regular water supply. After years of hauling water in buckets from a well six kilometers away, the village received a government water pipeline in 1935. Electricity was hooked up in 1939.

After years of peaceful co-existence with the surrounding Arab villagers, from whom they purchased vegetables, fruit and eggs, the inhabitants of Neve Yaakov were attacked during the 1929 Palestine riots, and many families returned to the Old City. According to a census conducted in 1931 by the British Mandate authorities, Neve Yaakov had a population of 101 inhabitants, in 20 houses. In the course of the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine, shots were heard from the Arab side almost every night. The British Mandate government supplied a cache of arms to defend Neve Yaakov, and members of the Zionist Haganah pre-state army moved in to guard the village and its water pipeline.

During the peaceful years from 1940 to 1947, the village operated a school that accepted students from all over the country. Children&#x27;s summer camps and convalescent facilities were opened, taking advantage of the rural atmosphere and fresh air. Veteran Jerusalem residents remember hiking to Neve Yaakov to buy fresh milk from dairy farmers.

During the last months of the British Mandate, snipers in Neve Yaakov shot at traffic on the Jerusalem/Ramallah road. In March 1948 the British Army introduced convoys to protect travellers.

When the Jordanian Arab Legion advanced toward Jerusalem from the north during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Neve Yaakov and Atarot were abandoned in the wake of advance warning that they were about to be attacked. Atarot was abandoned on May 17, 1948. The region was occupied by the Jordanians until the 1967 Six-Day War, when Israel captured the Old City and its surroundings.

On 27 January 2023, a Palestinian assailant killed seven Israelis in a shooting in Neve Yaakov.

According to ARIJ, Israel has confiscated land from three nearby Palestinian communities in order to re-establish Neve Yaakov:
*551 dunams from Beit Hanina,
*385 dunams from Hizma,
*315 dunums from Al-Ram.

In August 1970 3,500 acres of privately owned and titled Palestinian land was confiscated for &quot;public purposes&quot;. On this land, four residential colonies were established including Neve Yaakov with 4,000 apartments. In 1972, a new Israeli neighborhood was constructed on the site of the original village, with 4,900 apartments in high-rise buildings. The new neighborhood was populated by Jewish immigrants from Bukhara, Georgia, Latin America, North Africa, France and Iran. In the 1990s, when large waves of Russian and Ethiopian Jews came to Israel, many settled in Neve Yaakov.

In October 1971, Rabbi Meir Kahane presented the Minister of Immigrant Absorption, Natan Peled, a memo detailing plans for a community for American Jews in Neve Yaakov.

==Demography==

In 1982, Kiryat Kaminetz, a housing development on the eastern edge of Neve Yaakov named for the Jewish community of Kamenets, Poland destroyed in the Holocaust, was built on the eastern side of the existing neighborhood. Several hundred apartments were populated by young, Haredi Jewish families, many of them from English-speaking countries. In 1992, 700 new apartments were added to Kiryat Kaminetz on the eastern slope of the mountain; this new neighborhood is also known as Neve Yaakov Mizrach (Neve Yaakov East). The latter has a high concentration of Hasidic and Sephardic Haredi families, with a variety of schools and synagogues serving each population.

The Haredi character of the neighborhood has expanded further since 2004 with an influx of newlywed couples, both Israeli-born and immigrants from English-speaking countries, to the older sections of Neve Yaakov. This new trend has been characterized by calling the older section the &quot;Mitchared&quot; (literally, &quot;Haredization&quot;). In 2009 the Haredi presence in Neve Yaakov was estimated at 900 families.

Figures as of January 2016 from the Jerusalem Municipality showed a total population of 24,225, of which nearly half are under the age of 21. Seventy-six percent of the population is under the age of 40. Neve Yaakov is noted as having the largest kindergarten enrollment in the city. The 2016 figures cite 91 percent as being enrolled in Haredi kindergartens. In the elementary school system, 86 percent of children are enrolled in Haredi schools.

==Education==
Neve Yaakov Mizrach is home to two yeshivas catering to American students: Yeshivas Bais Yisroel and Yeshivas Lev Aryeh.

<text>Available bit rate (ABR) is a service used in ATM networks when source and destination don&#x27;t need to be synchronized. ABR does not guarantee against delay or data loss. ABR mechanisms allow the network to allocate the available bandwidth fairly over the present ABR sources. ABR is one of five service categories defined by the ATM Forum for use in an ATM Network. 

The network switches use locally available information to determine the explicit allowable rates or relative rate (increase/decrease) for the source. The newly calculated rates are then being sent to the sources using resource management records (RM-cells). RM-cells are generated by the source and travel along the data path to the destination and sent back. ABR sets a minimum cell rate (MCR) and a peak cell rate (PCR). When transfers exceed the PCR, cells are dropped.

Many implementers consider ABR to be overly complex, and its adoption has been modest.

<text>Thursday Dinners (, less commonly translated as Thursday Lunches) were gatherings of artists, intellectuals, architects, politicians and statesmen held by the last King of Poland, Stanislaus II Augustus during the Enlightenment period in Poland.

==History== 
Stanislaus Augustus Poniatowski was famed as a patron of the arts and learning. It was during his reign that Poland&#x27;s Age of Enlightenment (already begun in the 1730s–40s), reached its peak. It went into decline with the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. During the Age of Enlightenment, Warsaw was modernised and became a favourite meeting place for notable people in the worlds of art, architecture and literature along with other intellectuals and statesmen. The King invited influential figures of the time to his Thursday Dinners. He founded the School of Chivalry. 

The gatherings were usually held in the Royal Castle and in summer at the Palace on the Isle in Warsaw, between 1770 and 1784. During the gatherings, which typically lasted three hours and were akin to French salons, the King and his guests discussed literature, art and politics over a light meal. The number of guests varied over the years, with about thirty regulars, including politicians, writers, bibliophiles, military officers of rank and philosophers. Notable guests included:
* Ignacy Krasicki
* Franciszek Bohomolec
* Adam Naruszewicz
* Ignacy Potocki
* Stanisław Kostka Potocki
* Hugo Kołłątaj
* Jan Śniadecki and Jędrzej Śniadecki
* Stanisław Konarski
* Tomasz Adam Ostrowski
* Józef Szymanowski
* Andrzej Zamoyski.

The king also held less well-known Wednesday Dinners, &quot;Obiady Środowe&quot;. While the guests at the Thursday Dinners were usually writers, poets and artists, the Wednesday Dinners brought together educators, scientists and political activists.

The Thursday Dinners spawned the first Polish literary magazine, &quot;&quot; - &quot;Diversions Pleasurable and Useful&quot;, published from 1770 to 1777.

In the 1990s, Warsaw Mayor Paweł Piskorski reinstated the tradition by holding &quot;Tuesday Breakfasts&quot; to talk over current issues with leading businessmen and activists.

<doc id="1272686" wikidata="Q57303" url="?curid=1272686" title="Karolos Papoulias">
<text>Karolos Papoulias ( ; 4 June 1929 – 26 December 2021) was a Greek politician who served as the president of Greece from 2005 to 2015.

A member of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), he previously served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1985 to 1989 and again from 1993 until 1996.

== Early life ==
Karolos Papoulias was born in the village of Molyvdoskepastos, Ioannina on 4 June 1929, and was the son of Major General Gregorios Papoulias. He attended primary school in Pogoniani and secondary schools in Pogoniani, Zosimaia School in Ioannina, and in the Paleo Faliro and Pangrati districts of Athens. The Nazi invasion of Greece in April 1941 caught him studying in Pogoniani and Papoulias joined the armed resistance against the Germans. He obtained a law degree from the University of Athens, a master&#x27;s degree in public international law and international relations from the University of Milan, and a doctorate in private international law from the University of Cologne with a doctoral thesis entitled: &quot;Erwerb und Verlust des unmittelbaren Besitzes im griechishen und deutschen Recht&quot; (&quot;The acquisition and loss of immediate possession in Greek and German law&quot;). He was in West Germany at the time of the 1967 coup d&#x27;état and Papoulias headed the organization of the Democratic Socialist Union Abroad, which was responsible for mobilizing Greek workers, students and scientists in Europe against the new junta of the Colonels. He also founded the first trade union organization of the resistance and collaborated with the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle.

Papoulias was an associate of the Munich Institute for Southeast Europe. A onetime pole vault national champion and national volleyball team player, Papoulias was chairman of the National Sports Association. He was also a founding member and president of the Association for the Greek Linguistic Heritage.

Papoulias was active in the left-wing EPON youth as a young man.

== Role in PASOK, parliamentary, and government offices ==
Papoulias was a founding member of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) and a close associate of its leader Andreas Papandreou. From December 1974 on he was continually elected to the PASOK Central Committee. He was also member of the Coordination Council, the Executive Bureau and the Political Secretariat, as well as Secretary of the PASOK International Relations Committee from April 1975 to 1985. For a number of years he was also a member of the Coordinating Committee of the Socialist and Progressive Parties of the Mediterranean.

He was first elected to the Greek Parliament in 1977 for Ioannina, and held his seat continuously through the subsequent legislative elections until his 2004 election as President of the Republic. Under Andreas Papandreou government, Papoulias was deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, from 1981 to 1985, and from 1985 to 1989 and from 1993 to 1996, Minister of Foreign Affairs. During the ecumenical government of Xenophon Zolotas he served as deputy minister of National Defense between 1989 and 1990. During Costas Simitis&#x27; first ministerial term, he was for several years, from 1998 to 2004, president of the Permanent Committee of National Defense and Foreign Affairs.

== Minister for Foreign Affairs: 1985–1989, 1993–1996 ==
In the 1980s, Papoulias played a key role in trying to reach a solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. He mediated a safe departure of trapped Palestinian militants and Yasser Arafat from Lebanon aboard Greek vessels in 1983. He created diplomatic relations with the Arab world and achieved the normalization of relations between Greece and Egypt and the establishment of tripartite cooperation between Iran, Armenia, and Greece. He held talks with a total of 12 Turkish Foreign Ministers to normalize Greco-Turkish relations. This resulted in the signing of the Papoulias-Yılmaz memorandum in 1988.

He supported Turkey&#x27;s European aspirations conditional on their respect for international law and European Union values.

In his term between 1993 and 1996 and particularly at the crucial Essen Summit he played an important role in starting accession talks between the Republic of Cyprus and the European Union.

As president-in-office of the European Union and member of the contact group for the former Yugoslavia he worked to bring about a resolution of the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He signed the Interim Agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, aiming at the establishment of better relations between that nation and Greece.

He was very interested in relations between Greece and the Balkan states and it was upon his initiative that the first meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Balkans was organized in Belgrade in 1988. There, he began talks with Bulgaria and the then Soviet Union on the Burgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline.

He was responsible for the signing of the protocol of mutual civil and military assistance with Bulgaria in the 1980s. He restored friendly and neighbourly relations with Albania by ending the state of war between that country and Greece.

Papoulias was supportive of any step towards détente, peace, and disarmament e.g. the &quot;Initiative of the Six&quot; for peace and disarmament, the participation of Greece in the Conference on Disarmament and Peace in Europe and in the Conference for the Abolition of Chemical Weapons, his proposals to create a nuclear-free zone in the Balkans and the promotion of the idea of making the Mediterranean a sea of peace and cooperation. The JANNINA 1 tripartite cooperation conference, between Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania, was his idea and he was a strong supporter of the Black Sea Conference, which he also chaired.

With his visit to Washington, D.C. in 1985 and the return visit of Secretary of State George Shultz, he revitalized Greek-U.S. relations which had gone through a delicate phase during the previous years.

== Presidency ==
===First term: 2005–2010===

On 12 December 2004, Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis, leader of the governing New Democracy party, and George Papandreou, leader of the PASOK opposition, nominated Papoulias for the presidency. That same day Karamanlis made it public in a televised message. In fact, he had already communicated this decision to Papoulias in a phone call on 5 December, as he had been discussing his candidacy with him since the summer. Papoulias won over the other four candidates that PASOK and ND had been negotiating. On 8 February 2005, he was elected by 279 of 300 votes to a five-year term. He was sworn in as the 6th President of the Third Hellenic Republic on 12 March 2005, succeeding Konstantinos Stephanopoulos.

In December 2008, the police killing of a 15-year-old protester, Alexandros Grigoropoulos, sparked four days of riots in Athens. Papoulias called for calm to &quot;honor Alexis&#x27; memory peacefully&quot;.

At the inauguration of the Acropolis Museum on 20 June 2009, Papoulias demanded the return of the Elgin Marbles from the United Kingdom, which were torn from the Parthenon by the British, because &quot;it is time to heal the wounds of the monument with the return of the marbles that belong to it&quot;.

===Second term: 2010–2015===

After securing the support of the two major political parties, Papoulias was re-elected to a second and final term on 3 February 2010 with a parliamentary majority of 266 votes. His second term in office was mired in the country&#x27;s worsening financial crisis and large demonstrations and protests. This resulted in successive changes of government of different political orientations, with the appointment of conservative, socialist, socialist-conservative and left-wing governments.

Following the government&#x27;s agreement with the International Monetary Fund on 3 May 2010, Papoulias expressed on 5 May that &quot;our country has reached the limit of disaster&quot; after the general strike that day turned violent and in which three bank workers were killed when the offices were set on fire by protesters.

On 28 October 2011, Greece&#x27;s national day, protests occurred throughout the country. In Thessaloniki, protesters managed to prevent the annual military parade from taking place and chanted slogans against Papoulias, calling him, among other things, a &quot;traitor&quot; and he was forced to leave the area. On that day Papoulias&#x27; emotional statement is remembered, in which he said that &quot;I became a guerrilla when I was fifteen years old to fight against Nazism&quot;.

George Papandreou offered Papoulias his resignation as Prime Minister on 5 November 2011 to secure approval of the €130 billion bailout deal, and he appointed Lucas Papademos as his caretaker successor on 10 November. Papademos resigned few months after, in April 2012 and asked Papoulias to dissolve the Parliament and call for a snap election, scheduled for 6 May of that year.

On 15 February 2012 Papoulias resigned his salary as president. A few months later it was revealed that his salary was not withdrawn, but decreased.

That same month, when Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister, said that Greece should delay its elections and install a technocratic government, Papoulias replied that &quot;we are all obliged to work hard to overcome this crisis, but we cannot accept Mr. Schäuble&#x27;s insults. Who is Mr. Schäuble to insult Greece? Who are these Dutch? who are these Finns? We have always defended not only the freedom of our country, but the freedom of Europe&quot;.

After no party won an absolute majority of seats in the May 2012 legislative election, Papoulias called all party leaders to a meeting on 13 May following the terms of section 37 of the constitution, in a final attempt to form a national unity government. After he had met with all represented parties over the course of the day, he decided to call for a second meeting the next day with the PASOK, ND and DIMAR. The talks failed on 15 May, with an early election expected in June. So Papopulias appointed a caretaker cabinet under Council of State president Panagiotis Pikrammenos on 16 May, and the election date set for 17 June. At the same time, Papoulias was told by the head of the Bank of Greece George Provopoulos that local financial institutions were concerned about a bank run with the increased rate of withdrawal of euros, which were up to 700 million. Papoulias stated that &quot;there is, of course, no panic, but there is fear that could develop into panic&quot; acknowledging that Greeks on 14 May had withdrawn 800 million euros from the country&#x27;s banking system.

With the victory of ND leader Antonis Samaras in the elections, Papoulias tasked him to form a government. On 20 June he invested Samaras as the new Prime Minister.

The murder of rapper and anti-fascist Pavlos Fyssas in September 2013 by a Golden Dawn neo-fascist sparked a wave of outrage in Greece and Papoulias stated that &quot;it&#x27;s my supreme duty as president of the republic to defend democracy and the Greek people from the storm that is approaching&quot; and protect Greeks from neo-fascism. In 2014, during an official visit by German President Joachim Gauck Papoulias demanded that talks be scheduled as soon as possible on Greek claims for war reparations for the brutal German occupation during World War II.

His presidential term ended in March 2015 and he was replaced by Prokopis Pavlopoulos, who was elected Greece&#x27;s new president in a parliamentary vote in February 2015.

==Personal life and death==
Papoulias was married to Mary Panou and together, they had three daughters. Apart from his native Greek, he also spoke English, German, French as well as Italian fluently.

He died on 26 December 2021 in Athens at the age of 92. The Greek government announced three days of national mourning on December 27–29 with flags down to half-mast. His state funeral took place on 29 December at the church of Agios Spyridon in Pagrati and was attended by the country&#x27;s highest authorities. The following day he was buried on the island of Lake Ioannina.

<text>The Kylver stone, listed in the Rundata catalog as runic inscription G 88, is a Swedish runestone which dates from about 400 AD. It is notable for its listing of each of the runes in the Elder Futhark.

==Description==
The Kylver stone was found during the excavation of a cemetery near a farm at Kylver, Stånga, Gotland in 1903. The stone was a flat limestone rock used to seal a grave and the runic inscription was written on the underside, and could therefore not be read from above. The dating of the stone from 400 CE is based upon the archeological dating of the graves.

The Kylver stone was removed from Gotland and brought to the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm where it is on display . 

The fact that the inscription was on the inside of a cover to a grave has resulted in speculation that it represented a use of the Elder Futhark to pacify the dead man in some manner. However, it has been pointed out that there is nothing in the inscription to support this. In addition, there is no evidence that the inscription was made for the purpose of being used on the cover of a grave. There are many examples where stone with runic inscriptions was reused for other purposes. It has been suggested that the likely purpose of making the inscription was for practice or instruction in the carving of the Elder Futhark.

==Inscription==
The Kylver stone is inscribed with the earliest known sequential listing of the 24 runes of the Elder Futhark,

with the a (ᚨ), s (ᛊ), and b runes (ᛒ) mirrored compared to later use, and the z rune (ᛉ) upside down (ᛦ). The dots in the image indicate incorrect or unorthodox forms like these in the original inscription. The f (ᚠ) and w runes (ᚹ) runes are only partially inscribed.

After the last rune follows a spruce- or tree-like rune, with six twigs to the left and eight to the right of a single stave. This is interpreted as a bindrune of stacked Tiwaz rune, or possibly of six Tiwaz and four Ansuz runes to invoke Tyr and the Æsir for protection.

At a separate space the word ᛊᚢᛖᚢᛊ sueus is inscribed. The meaning of this latter palindromic word is unknown, but it is possible that it is associated with magic. One suggestion presented by Marstrander is that it is a magical writing of the word &#x27;eus&#x27; (the nominative form of the word horse) starting from the e and writing either way. However, this suggestion has been criticized as being &quot;linguistically impossible&quot; for that time period. The small inscription also uses the Younger Futhark version of the s-rune. It is also possible that it refers to the Germanic tribe of the Suiones that inhabited the region, whose realm laid the basis for what became Sweden.

<doc id="1272689" wikidata="Q1035359" url="?curid=1272689" title="Caramac">
<text>Caramac is the brand name for a caramel-based confectionery created by Mackintosh&#x27;s, and is manufactured by Nestlé. It was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1959 and was discontinued in 2023 and brought back for a limited period in July 2024. The name is derived from the syllabic abbreviation of &quot;Caramel&quot; and &quot;Mackintosh&quot;.

A similar confection is used in the covering of McVitie&#x27;s Gold biscuit bar. A limited edition Caramac Kit Kat bar was released in the United Kingdom in 2005 and due to popular demand it was brought back in 2007.

In 2015 a buttons version was launched.

In November 2023, Nestle announced that they would be withdrawing the Caramac from their range due to low sales. In July 2024 the bar was brought back for a &quot;limited release&quot;.

== History ==
The name of the product was determined in a competition. The competition was held in what was the Norwich factory of Mackintosh&#x27;s, and won by Barbara Herne. The bar was made at the old Norwich factory until its closure in 1996, when production transferred to Fawdon on Tyneside.

== Design ==
The bar was a light brown colour and was manufactured using sweetened condensed milk, butter, various flavourings, and sugar. It has been compared to blond chocolate (a variant of white chocolate). Caramac uses, however, palm and shea butter instead of cocoa butter.

It was packaged in a red and yellow wrapper.

<doc id="1272690" wikidata="Q2915231" url="?curid=1272690" title="Shuafat">
<text>Shuafat ( ), also &quot;Shu&#x27;fat&quot; and &quot;Sha&#x27;fat&quot;, is a mostly Palestinian Arab neighborhood of East Jerusalem, forming part of north-eastern Jerusalem. Located on the old Jerusalem–Ramallah road about three miles north of the Old City, Shu&#x27;fat has a population of 35,000 residents.

Next to the Shuafat neighbourhood there is a refugee camp of the same name, which was established by King Hussein of Jordan in 1965 to house Palestinian refugees from the Jerusalem, Lydda, Jaffa, and Ramleh areas, after the Muascar camp in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City had been closed.

Shuafat borders Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev and Beit Hanina on the north, Shu&#x27;fat refugee camp on the east, French Hill on the south, and Ramat Shlomo on the west. Shu&#x27;fat is located in the part of the West Bank which was included in the municipal boundaries of Jerusalem after its occupation in 1967.


== Etymology ==
Conder and Kitchener suggested that Shuafat&#x27;s name derives from the Jewish king Jehoshaphat, but it could be a corruption of Mizphe or Sapha. It is possible that the name of this town was altered by the Crusaders or that it was slightly modified from the word &quot;Sh&#x27;af&quot; (plural &quot;Sh&#x27;afat&quot;), which means mountain top.

Edward Henry Palmer gave &quot;p.n&quot; as the meaning for the name, (&quot;&quot;p.n&quot;: (proper name) after a name, mean either that it is a common Arabic personal appellation, or that it is a word to which no meaning can be assigned&quot;), and added &quot;The village is said by the peasantry to have been named after a king &quot;Shafat&quot; (perhaps
Jehoshaphat).&quot;

Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau reported several traditions regarding the name of the village. According to one tradition, told by a local woman, Sha&#x27;fat was known in ancient times under the name of &quot;Alaikou&quot;. According to a second tradition, it was known in the past as &quot;Deir Mahruk&quot;, &quot;the burned covent&quot;. A third tale, &quot;evidently of Christian origin&quot;, also linked the place to Jehoshaphat. It asserted that &quot;there was once upon a time at Sha&#x27;fat a king named Yachafat, who is mentioned in the Tora; it was he who gave his name to the country&quot;. Clermont-Ganneau noted that the Hebrew name Jehoshaphat does not contain the &#x27;ayin that exists in Sha&#x27;fat, and therefore, this tale was an &quot;entirely artificial tradition&quot;, which was possibly influenced by the nearby valley of Josaphat.

==History==
The area of Shuafat has been intermittently settled, with the oldest architectural findings dating to the Chalcolithic period 7000 years ago. Findings from the 2nd–1st century BC revealed the presence of a fortified agricultural settlement by that period. The settlement reached its largest size in the Roman period, between 70–130 CE, before being abandoned or destroyed after the 135 CE Bar Kokhba Revolt, only to be re-inhabited on a smaller scale in the 2nd–4th centuries.

Late 19th-century Biblical historians have suggested that it might be linked to Mizpah in Benjamin, and Nob, while one 21st-century review suggested Gebim, though cautioning that it remains uncertain.

=== Second Temple Period ===
Following a 1991 archaeological dig conducted by Alexander Onn and Tzvi Greenhut which unearthed a 2nd century BCE fortified agricultural settlement near Shuafat, an underground room in the complex was dated to the early first century BCE, and identified as a prayer room or synagogue. Subsequently, this interpretation of the site was strongly questioned. In 2008, Rachel Hachlili stated that the structure is no longer considered to have been a synagogue. The settlement was abandoned after being severely damaged by the 31 BCE earthquake.

Jewish tombs dating to this period have also been discovered at Ramat Shlomo, at what was formerly known as Shuafat Ridge. A large quarry, possibly linked to Herod&#x27;s expansion of the Second Temple, dating to the period has also been found in Ramat Shlomo.

During an archaeological salvage dig conducted near the Shuafat refugee camp in preparation for the laying of the tracks for the Jerusalem Light Rail system, the remains of a Jewish settlement from the Roman period were discovered. The settlement was on the main Roman road leading northward from Jerusalem towards Shechem/Flavia Neapolis. It was inhabited between the two main revolts of the Jews against the Romans, as it was established after the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE and was suddenly abandoned around 130 CE, shortly before the outbreak of the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–36). This settlement is thought to have been inhabited by elite Jewish families, including priests, who stayed close to Jerusalem after its destruction, possibly in anticipation of the temple&#x27;s future restoration. It is described as a &#x27;sophisticated community impeccably planned by the Roman authorities, with orderly rows of houses and two fine public bathhouses to the north.&#x27; 

At the time of its discovery, the site was said to be the first indication of an active Jewish settlement in the area of Jerusalem after the city fell in 70 CE, and with a presumed total surface area of c. 11 dunams (minimum length 310 m, width c. 35 m), it was also considered the largest Jewish settlement of the time &quot;in the vicinity of Jerusalem&quot;. The main indication that the settlement was a Jewish one is the large and varied assemblage of chalkstone vessels found there. Such vessels, for food storage and serving, were only used by Jews because they were believed not to transmit impurity. Some of the vessels discovered there belong to a type only found after 70 CE. An even more conclusive archaeological evidence of the Jewish character of a settlement is the presence of Jewish ritual baths, several of which were found during later work.

The presence of the public bathhouses, the delay in finding Jewish ritual baths, and the discovery of imported Italian and Greek wine produced by non-Jews, which the very purity-concerned Jews of the time would have avoided, made researchers at first speculate whether the settlement might have been a mixed Jewish-Roman (pagan) one, with the bathhouses operated by Jews for the benefit of Roman soldiers. The quality of the buildings and other findings, such rich coin hoards, cosmetics, stone vessels and imported wine, attest to the wealth of the inhabitants.

=== Late Roman and Byzantine periods ===
The abandoned or destroyed site was resettled on a smaller scale in the second–fourth centuries CE, with agricultural terraces recently exposed west of Shuʽfat Street.

===Crusader period===
The place was known to the Crusaders as &quot;Dersophath&quot; or &quot;Dersophach&quot;. In March 1179, it was noted that its revenues went to the abbey of St Mary of Mount Sion as the result of a grant made by Anselm de Parenti.

Remains of a Crusader structure in the center of the village have been found. Guérin thought it was possibly a church: &quot;One [house] which still today bears the name &quot;El-Kniseh&quot; (the church), presents the remains of a Christian sanctuary facing east, whose windows were pointed and which dates in all likelihood from the Middle Ages. Some fine ashlars of antique appearance had been used, along with other smaller material, in the construction of this little church.&quot; However, Schick found no church, &quot;simply an old Crusading building with two preserved windows. The walls are about 6 feet thick, against which the fellaheen houses are built and so it is not easy to recognise. It was a kind of khan built in the usual Crusading way, with a vault a little higher in the middle than semi-circular.&quot; Seikh &#x27;Abd-allah&#x27;s tomb was built on top of this church.

===Mamluk period===
Archaeologists discovered that agricultural terraces from the area were built and covered with topsoil during the Mamluk period (1260–1516).

===Ottoman period===
The village was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, and in 1596 Shuafat appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being in the &quot;Nahiya&quot; of Quds of the &quot;Liwa&quot; of Quds. It had eight Muslim families who paid taxes on wheat, barley, vineyards and other agricultural produce; a total of 2,200 akçe.

In 1838, Edward Robinson described Shuafat as a small Muslim village with the remains of an old wall, while de Saulcy, who saw it in 1851, wrote that &quot;this village has the appearance of a castle of the middle ages with a square keep.&quot;

The French explorer Guérin visited in 1863 and noted that the village was situated on an elevated plateau &quot;from which one can make out perfectly the cupolas and minarets of Jerusalem,&quot; and that it counted 150 inhabitants. He described the houses as for the most part fairly old and vaulted internally. He noted the remains of a church called &quot;al-Kanisa&quot;, facing east. He thought it was a Frankish church. He also passed by in 1870. An official Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed 23 houses and a population of 90, counting men only.

In 1883, the Palestine Exploration Fund&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described Shuafat as &quot;A small village, standing on a flat spur immediately west of the watershed, surrounded with olive-trees. It has wells to the north. There is a sacred chapel of Sultan Ibrahim in the village.&quot; In 1896 the population of &quot;Scha&#x27;fat&quot; was estimated to be about 276 persons.

The Ottomans built a road in the same place as the old Roman road linking Jerusalem to Nablus.

===British Mandate period===

In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Sha&#x27;afat had a population 422, all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 539, still all Muslims, in 123 houses.

In the 1945 statistics the population of Shu&#x27;fat was 760, all Muslims, and it had 5,215 dunams of land according to an official land and population survey. 484 dunams were for plantations and irrigable land, 2,111 for cereals, while 62 dunams were built-up (urban) land.

===Jordanian period===
The town of Shuafat was to be the most northernmost point of the &quot;corpus separatum&quot; proposed in 1947 for Jerusalem and its surrounding villages, which &quot;in view of its association with three world religions&quot; was to be &quot;accorded special and separate treatment from the rest of Palestine and should be placed under effective United Nations control&quot;.

In mid-February, during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni, leader of Palestinian irregulars in the area, tried to persuade the residents of Shuafat to attack the neighbouring Jewish village of Neve Yaakov but the invitation was declined. On 13 May the villagers were evacuated on orders from the Arab Legion. Shortly afterwards the Palmach captured Shuafat, destroying many of the buildings. Shuafat was then occupied by Jordan, which annexed the West Bank in April 1950.

Jordan&#x27;s king Hussein also built a palace here.

In 1961, the population of Shuafat was 2,541, of whom 253 were Christian.

====Shuafat refugee camp====
In the wake of the 1948 war, the Red Cross accommodated Palestinian refugees in the depopulated and partly destroyed Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem&#x27;s Old City. This grew into the Muaska refugee camp managed by UNRWA, which housed refugees from 48 locations now in Israel. Over time many poor non-refugees also settled in the camp. Conditions became unsafe for habitation due to lack of maintenance and sanitation, but neither UNRWA nor the Jordanian government wanted the negative international response that would result if they demolished the old Jewish houses.

In 1964, a decision was made to move the refugees to a new camp constructed on mostly Jewish land near Shuafat. Most of the refugees refused to move, since it would mean losing their livelihood, the market and the tourists, as well as reducing their access to the holy sites. In the end, many of the refugees were moved to Shuafat by force during 1965 and 1966.

===1967 and aftermath===
After the Six-Day War in 1967, East Jerusalem, including the town and refugee camp, was occupied and later annexed by Israel and were incorporated into the Jerusalem municipal district. The residents were offered Israeli citizenship, but most refused it as they considered the area to be illegally occupied. Many accepted permanent residency status instead.

According to ARIJ, Israel has illegally and unilaterally redrawn the boundaries of Jerusalem Municipality, and confiscated 3,989 dunams of Shu’fat land (47% of the total town&#x27;s area) in order to establish five Israeli settlements:
*1,494 dunams for Rekhes Shufat (Ramat Shlomo)
*1,446 dunams for Ramot (Ramot Allon)
*416 dunams for Ramat Eshkol
*239 dunams for Pisgat Amir
*394 dunams for Giva&#x27;t Shappira (French Hill)

The Shuafat refugee camp is the only Palestinian refugee camp located inside Jerusalem or any other Israeli-administered area. While its residents carry Jerusalem identity cards, which grants them the same privileges and rights as regular Israelis, the camp itself is largely serviced by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, even though 40 - 50% of the camp&#x27;s population are not registered refugees. The Israeli West Bank barrier was partially constructed between the camp and the rest of Shuafat and Jerusalem. Some health services are provided by Israeli clinics in the camp. The Israeli presence is limited to checkpoints controlling entry and exit. According to Ir Amim, the camp suffers from high crime as Israeli Police rarely enter due to security concerns and the Palestinian Civil Police Force do not operate in Israeli-administered municipalities. Unlike other UN-run refugee camps, residents of Shuafat camp pay taxes to the Israeli authorities.

The Shuafat Ridge next to the township was declared a &#x27;green zone&#x27; to stop Palestinians in Shuafat from building there, until the opportunity arose to unfreeze its status as a green area and open it up for a new Jewish neighbourhood, as Teddy Kollek openly admitted.

In a survey conducted as part of the research for the book &quot;Negotiating Jerusalem&quot; (2000), it was reported that 59% of Israeli Jews supported redefining the borders of the city of Jerusalem so as to exclude Arab settlements such as Shuafat, in order to ensure a &quot;Jewish majority&quot; in Jerusalem.

In July 2001, the Israeli authorities destroyed 14 homes under construction in Shuafat on the orders of then mayor Ehud Olmert, who said the structures were built without permits. No one was yet living in them. The families acknowledged they do not own the land they built on, but believed they had permission to build there from Islamic Trust religious authorities and argue that obtaining permits to build legally is nearly impossible. Olmert said the houses were being constructed on public land in a &quot;green area&quot; and posed a security threat to the Jews of Pisgat Zeev. According to Isabel Kershner of the New York Times, Shuafat suffered from an absence of municipal planning, overcrowding, and potholed roads in 2007.

As prime minister, Ehud Olmert questioned whether the annexation of areas like Shuafat into the Jerusalem area was necessary. The Israeli initiative to transfer control of the area to the Palestinian National Authority led to a split in the community: A camp official favored being under Palestinian sovereignty, while the neighborhood&#x27;s mukhtar rejected the plan, citing his residents&#x27; participation in Israeli elections as well as the danger of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel.

In 2012, Sorbonne scholar Prof. Sylvaine Bulle cited the Shuafat refugee camp for its urban renewal dynamic, seeing it as an example of a creative adaptation to the fragmented space of the camps towards creating a bricolage city, with businesses relocating from east Jerusalem there and new investment in commercial projects.

Three stations of the First &#x27;Red&#x27; Line of the Jerusalem Light Rail are situated in Shuafat: Shuafat North, Shuafat Central and Shuafat South.

The neighbourhood&#x27;s Main Street, Shuafat Road, was previously part of route 60. In the 1990s a new route was built to the east of the neighbourhood, a dual carriageway with 3 lines in each direction, relieving traffic congestion along the road.

In 2014, the 16-year-old Mohammed Abu Khdeir was kidnapped from near his home in Shuafat. He was then murdered by his kidnappers, who were Jewish extremists.

Based on a unibody chassis with front-wheel drive configuration, the Strada shares its platform with several Fiat subcompact cars such as the Palio, Siena, and Uno. , the Strada is the smallest of three Fiat pickup trucks, which include the larger unibody Toro and the body-on-frame Titano. 


== First generation (278; 1998) ==

Launched in October 1998 in Brazil, the first-generation Strada is the cargo carrying derivative of the &quot;Project 178&quot;. The Strada was made to replace the Fiat City, a pickup version of the Fiorino, a commercial derivative of the Fiat Uno. The Strada features a maximum loading capacity of and a cargo space of x .

In Europe the Strada was launched in April 1999 with two engines: the 1.2 Fire petrol with and the 1.7 turbodiesel with .

=== 2001 revision ===
In 2001, the model had its first facelift. The new design was made by the Italian design guru Giorgetto Giugiaro. The facelift included a new front and interior. The Mark II series marked the début of an extended-cab version. In 2002, Fiat do Brasil launched the first version of a Fiat Strada Adventure, with &quot;off-road&quot; looks.
=== 2004 revision ===
The new Mark III was launched in 2004. It has a revised front and interior design taken from the Palio (and also designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro). Also, a second version of the Strada Adventure was built, with the same features of the Weekend Adventure. It was offered in Europe with the relatively modern 1.9-L JTD diesel engine.

In South Africa, the Strada is offered in four variants: 1.2 Fire MPI EL, 1.6 Torque MPI EL, 1.6 Torque MPI ELX (same as the EL but with colour-coded bumpers and mirrors, electric windows, driver&#x27;s airbag, and air conditioning), and 1.7 turbo diesel EL. Fiat South Africa also introduced the X-Space model, which stretches the cab by . This model is available in two models, the standard X-Space and the X-Space Adventure (which has similar specifications to the standard 1.6 ELX model). Both X-Space models are powered by the 1.4 Fire MPI engine.

In Europe, it is available only with the 1.3 Multijet 16V diesel engine with and Euro 4 standard emission level.

=== 2009–2013 ===
Unveiled in summer 2009, the all-new Mark IV model was put on sale in the end of 2009. Whilst the model shares its name with the previous Strada, a large number of its components are new, including a new bodyshell. For the rest of the South America, the new Strada was introduced in mid-2010. The design is inspired by the Fiat Grande Punto with many elements similar to the latest versions of the family Palio and Siena. The fourth-generation Strada is built in four different versions: Working, the basic version, Trekking, with more goodies, the Sporting for sportier style with aero kit body style, and the Adventure with a locking differential dedicated to off-road use. In 2010, Fiat do Brazil introduced a new double-cab version (also called Strada Cabina Dupla) with four seats, but maintaining the same wheelbase.

The engines used are the Fiat 1.4-L 16V Fire Flex (85 PS) and the 1.8-L 16-V Ecotec Flex (114 PS). For diesel, the 1.3-L 16V Multijet unit with is also available.

The Strada was relaunched for Italy and other selected European markets in 2012.

=== 2013–2021 ===
At the end of 2013, Fiat unveiled the latest facelift of the Strada (as a model year 2014) based on the 2009 version. The new Strada introduced a new front fascia and new rear lights, and the double-cab version is available with the suicide-style rear doors. Three versions are sold in South America: Working, Trekking and Adventure with four different body styles.

For the 2015 model year, the Fiat Strada was rebadged by Ram Trucks for the Mexican market as the Ram 700.

In 2018, total sales of the Strada in the Brazilian market surpassed 1.4 million of units.

== Second generation (281; 2020) ==

The second generation of the Fiat Strada (codeproject 281) was presented on June 26, 2020 in Brazil and is based on the new MC-P modular platform derived from the Fiat Argo with the front MacPherson suspension and part of the cabin taken from the Fiat Mobi model and the rear suspension taken from the Brazilian Fiat Fiorino (327). For the first time the Strada was produced in the double cab 4-door version with 5-seats.

The second generation of Strada introduce the large silver-colored Fiat front logo replacing the previous one, a small Italian flag inserted in the grid and LED light clusters. The side and tail, on the other hand, appear more classic, with the possibility of choosing between the two and four-door versions featuring a different capacity: 720 kg and 1,354 liters for the first and 650 kg and 844 liters for the second. In order to ensure maximum mobility even on rough surfaces, the raised structure allows the car to lift from the ground by 211 mm and a front angle of attack of 24 degrees. The interior reproduces some of the contents of the Fiat Uno (327) produced in Brazil, even if some secondary controls are modified. In addition to the display at the center of the instrumentation, there is also an UConnect 5 infotainment with 7-inch touchscreen, bluetooth, wireless, compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. 

Starting on 18 November 2020, the rebadged RAM 700 saw a new generation for the Mexican market. It is offered in the SLT (regular and crew cab), Bighorn, and Laramie trim levels.

=== Engine ===
The range of engines consist in the 1.4 Fire EVO Flex 8 valve (85 HP petrol and 88 HP ethanol) of the Endurance versions and the 1.3 Firefly Flex 8 valve (101 HP petrol and 109 HP ethanol) of the Freedom, Volcano and ranch, both with the five-speed manual gearbox gears and simulated 7-speed cvt-type automatic transmission and the E-Locker traction control system. As of August 2023, the Ultra and Ranch versions will feature the new 1.0-liter gasoline/ethanol turbo engine, producing 125/130hp and 20.4 kgfm coupled to a CVT gearbox that simulates 7 gears.
===Safety===
The Strada has 4 airbags, electronic stability control (ESC) Ventilated Front disc brakes and drum brakes in the rear.

====Latin NCAP====
The Latin American Strada with airbags and ESC received 1 star from Latin NCAP in 2022 under its new protocol (similar to Euro NCAP 2014).

<doc id="1272705" wikidata="Q2829270" url="?curid=1272705" title="Duchy of Spoleto">
<text>The Duchy of Spoleto () was a Lombard territory founded about 570 in central Italy by the Lombard &quot;dux&quot; Faroald. Its capital was the city of Spoleto.

== Lombards ==
The Lombards invaded northern Italy in 568 and began their conquest of the peninsula eventually establishing the Kingdom of the Lombards. Following the conquest of the north, the Lombards moved into central and southern Italy capturing the important hub of Spoleto in 570. In 572, the Lombards captured the northern city of Pavia after a siege of three years and established the first capital city of their new Kingdom. As time progressed, the captured territories were divided by the Lombard king among numerous dependent dukes.

A decade of interregnum after the death of Alboin&#x27;s successor (574), however, left the Lombard dukes (especially the southern ones) well settled in their new territories and quite independent of the Lombard kings at Pavia. By 575 or 576 Faroald had seized Nursia and Spoleto, establishing his duchy and sponsoring an Arian bishop. Within Spoleto, the Roman &quot;capitolium&quot; dedicated to Jupiter, Juno and Minerva had already been occupied by the bishop&#x27;s cathedral (the see was founded in the 4th century) which incorporated the pagan structure (now the church of San Ansano). The Lombard dukes restored the fortifications of the high &quot;rocca,&quot; whose walls had been dismantled by Totila during the Gothic War.

The dukes of Spoleto waged intermittent war with the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna, and Spoleto&#x27;s territories fluctuated with the fortunes of the times over much of Umbria, Lazio, the Marche and the Abruzzi. Never as important as the Duchy of Benevento, Spoleto has a fairly obscure spot in Lombard history, nevertheless. Its second Duke Ariulf made frequent expeditions against the Byzantines (in 579–592 against Ravenna and in 592 against Rome). Ariulf was succeeded by Theudelapius, son of Faroald, whom the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; credits with the first building of Spoleto&#x27;s cathedral. Then came Atto (653), Thrasimund I (663), and Faroald II (703), who ruled conjointly with his brother Wachilap. Faroald II captured Classis, the port of Ravenna, according to Paul the Deacon&#x27;s &quot;History of the Lombards&quot;: &quot;In that time too Faroald, the first &quot;dux&quot; of the Spoletans, invading Classis with an army of Lombards, left the wealthy city despoiled and bare of all its riches.&quot; He was then obliged by Liutprand, King of the Lombards to restore it, a measure of the loose central control of Lombard rule that Liutprand was occupied in tightening, at least as Paul interpreted events for his Frankish patrons. At Spoleto Faroald was deposed by his son Transemund II (724), who also rebelled against Liutprand and formed an alliance with Pope Gregory III, who sheltered him in Rome in 738. Ilderic, who had replaced him as duke, was slain by Transemund in 740, but in 742 Transemund was forcibly retired to a monastery by Liutprand, who conferred the duchy that he had rewon by force of arms upon Agiprand (742). By the time of Liutprand&#x27;s death (744), Spoleto was more securely in central control from Pavia, and Theodicus succeeded peaceably. Three 8th-century dukes were Kings of the Lombards, a sign that in that period Spoleto was linked more closely to the kingdom than was Benevento.

== Imperial fief ==
In 776, two years after the fall of Pavia, Spoleto fell likewise to Charlemagne and his Carolingian Empire, and he assumed the title King of the Lombards. Though he granted the territory to the Church, he retained the right to name its dukes, an important concession that can be compared to the as-yet uncontested Imperial right to invest territorial bishops, and perhaps at times a matter of contention between emperor and papacy, for Pope Adrian I had recently named a duke of Spoleto.

In 842, the former duchy was resurrected by the Franks to be held as a Frankish border territory by a dependent margrave. Among the more outstanding of the Frankish dukes, Guy I divided the duchy between his two sons Lambert and Guy II, who received as his share the lordship of Camerino, which was made a duchy. Lambert was a doughty fighter against Saracen raiders, but an individual who equally massacred Byzantines (as in 867), and was deposed in 871, restored in 876, and finally excommunicated by Pope John VIII. In 883 Guy II reunited the dukedom, henceforth as the Duchy of Spoleto and Camerino. After the death of Charles the Fat in 888, Guy had himself crowned emperor of the Romans and king of Italy by Pope Stephen V (891). The following year Pope Formosus crowned Guy&#x27;s son Lambert II as duke, king and emperor.

The dukes of Spoleto continued to intervene in the violent politics of Rome. Alberico I, Duke of Camerino (897), and afterwards of Spoleto, married the notorious Roman noblewoman Marozia, mistress of Pope Sergius III (904–911), and was killed by the Romans in 924. His son Alberico II overthrew the &quot;senatrix&quot; in 932 though her son, his half-brother, was Pope John XII. About 949, the Frankish King Berengar II of Italy took Spoleto from the margrave, diminished the size of the duchy, and set aside territory that would become the March of Fermo.

At that time, Emperor Otto I detached from the Duchy of Spoleto the lands called &quot;Sabina Langobardica&quot; and presented them to the Holy See. Now the control of Spoleto became increasingly a gift of the emperors. In 967, Otto briefly united the Duchy of Spoleto with that of Principality of Capua and Benevento, which was then ruled by Pandulf Ironhead. After Pandolf&#x27;s death in 981, the joint principality of Spoleto, Capua and Benevento was partitioned amongst the sons of Pandulf, who fought endlessly to gain supremacy. Landulf IV gained Spoleto, Capua, and Benevento, while Pandulf II received Salerno. Then in 989 Otto III detached Spoleto and granted it to Hugh, Margrave of Tuscany. Later in December 998, Otto appointed Adhemar of Capua as the duke of Spoleto. Adhemar ruled four years until the duchy was united a second time with Tuscany in 1003.

During the Investiture Controversy with the papacy, Emperor Henry IV named other dukes of Spoleto. In 1152, the emperor gave the duchy to Guelf VI of Este. The city was destroyed by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa three years later, but was soon rebuilt. After that, the dukedom was held by the family of the Werner (Guarnieri) of Urslingen, margraves of Ancona. In 1183, Frederick appointed Conrad of Urslingen as the duke. Conrad ruled until 1190 when Frederick died and the Guelphs seized the principality and positioned Pandulf as the duke. Five years later after Henry VI succeeded Frederick I as emperor, Conrad regained the position as duke of Spoleto. After Henry VI died in 1197 and Otto of Brunswick became the king of Italy in 1198, however, Conrad left the position and ceded Spoleto to Pope Innocent III.

== Papal fief ==
In 1201, in support of Pope Innocent&#x27;s desire to strengthen the dominion of the Papal States, Otto made a gift of the Imperial rights for Spoleto to the Papacy. In 1209, after the death of Philip of Swabia, however, Otto became the Holy Roman Emperor and reneged on his earlier promises to support the Pope. Otto set his sights on reestablishing Imperial power and occupied Spoleto until 1213 when the duchy was brought back under papal rule with a governor, usually a cardinal. However, Spoleto remained a pawn in the struggles between the Papacy and Frederick II until the extinction of the House of Hohenstaufen in 1254.

Ultimately, the territories of Spoleto were annexed to the Papal States and the Kingdom of Naples. The title of Duchy of Spoleto was later used by members of the House of Savoy.

<doc id="1272709" wikidata="Q367017" url="?curid=1272709" title="Kenneth Colley">
<text>Kenneth Colley (born 7 December 1937) is an English film and television actor whose career spans over 60 years. He came to wider prominence through his role as Admiral Piett in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980) and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), as well as his roles in the films of Ken Russell and as Jesus in &quot;Monty Python’s Life of Brian&quot;.

==Career==
Colley was born in Manchester, Lancashire. One of his early appearances on British television was as Noah Riley in the 1970s police drama &quot;The Sweeney&quot;, in an episode entitled &quot;Trap&quot;. He played Jesus in &quot;The Life of Brian&quot;, having also appeared in the earlier Monty Python-related production &quot;Ripping Yarns&quot; episode &quot;The Testing of Eric Olthwaite&quot; alongside Michael Palin. As a Shakespearean actor he played the Duke of Vienna in the BBC Television Shakespeare production of &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; in 1979.

Colley worked extensively with British director Ken Russell from the early 1970s to the early 1990s as part of a repertory of actors who appeared across Russell&#x27;s television and film work. He played the role of Modest Tchaikovsky in the film &quot;The Music Lovers&quot; (1971). He went on to play the role of LeGrand in Russell&#x27;s &quot;The Devils&quot; (also 1971); he played the journalist Krenek in the biopic &quot;Mahler&quot; (1974); the composer Frédéric Chopin in &quot;Lisztomania&quot; (1975); Mr Brunt in Russell&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Rainbow&quot; (1989) by D. H. Lawrence. His last role for Russell was as Captain Dreyfus in the film &quot;Prisoner of Honor&quot; (1991), which dealt with the Dreyfus affair.

For his work in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, Colley&#x27;s role as Admiral Piett is noted for differing from the other ill-fated Imperial officers who appeared alongside him in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), as Colley was the only actor to play an Imperial officer in a second &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, reprising his role in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983). Colley reprised his role as Piett in the Cartoon Network animated special &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Out&quot; in September 2012. Coincidentally, Colley and David Prowse had a part in the fantasy film &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; (1977).

Colley also played a notable role in the 1982 Clint Eastwood film &quot;Firefox&quot;, where he played a Soviet colonel tasked with the protection of the Firefox and its secrets. He went on to play SS-&quot;Standartenführer&quot; Paul Blobel in the Second World War drama &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;.

Colley has directed one film to date, &quot;Greetings&quot; (2007), a horror film starring Kirsty Cox, Henry Dunn and Ben Shockley.

In 2017, Colley recorded a series of short narrations for inclusion on &quot;Pop Wasteland&quot;, an album by Folkestone band Phenomenal Cat.

==Personal life==

Colley lives in Hythe, Kent.

According to comments which Terry Gilliam (who directed him in &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; and acted with him in &quot;Life of Brian&quot;) made in the DVD audio commentaries for both films, Colley has a stammer in real life. When he had a role in a film, however, he could recite the lines perfectly. Stuttering is a character trait, however, in his role as the Accordion Man in the 1978 BBC television drama &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot;.

<doc id="1272714" wikidata="Q316815" url="?curid=1272714" title="Aérospatiale Alouette II">
<text>The Aérospatiale Alouette II (, &quot;lark&quot;; company designations SE 313 and SA 318) is a French light helicopter originally manufactured by Sud Aviation and later Aérospatiale. It was the first production helicopter powered by a gas turbine engine instead of the heavier conventional piston powerplant.

On 12 March 1955, the prototype SE 3130 performed its maiden flight. The Alouette II was a widely used type and popular with operators, with over 1,300 rotorcraft eventually being constructed between 1956 and 1975. The type was predominantly used for military purposes in observation, photography, air-sea rescue, liaison and training, but it has also carried anti-tank missiles and homing torpedoes. As a civilian helicopter, the Alouette II has been used for casualty evacuation (with two external stretcher panniers), crop-spraying and as a flying crane, with a external underslung load.

A high-altitude derivative, the SA 315B Lama, was developed and entered operational service in July 1971. The Alouette II also was further developed into the larger and more powerful Alouette III. In 1975, production of the type was terminated, having been effectively succeeded by these newer rotorcraft. Despite it being long out of production, considerable numbers of Alouette II were still in service at the start of the 21st century.

==Development==
Although Sud-Est&#x27;s previous helicopter design, the SE 3120 Alouette, broke helicopter speed and distance records in July 1953, it was too complex an aircraft to market successfully. With the records falling, the French government started showing interest, but with their financial backing, the state gave an ultimatum that within two years a helicopter had to be in production, otherwise all rotary wing activities would cease. SNCASE came up with seven helicopter designs powered by turboshaft engines: X.310A – X.310G. Earlier Joseph Szydlowski, the founder of Turbomeca, had successfully managed to develop the Artouste, a single shaft turbine engine derived from his Orédon turbine. The X.310G design was chosen and, together with an improved version of the Artouste engine, was fast-tracked towards production as the &quot;SE 3130 Alouette II&quot;.
On 12 March 1955, the prototype SE 3130 performed its maiden flight; within three months, on 6 June, a pre-production Alouette II, flown by Jean Boulet, established a new helicopter altitude record of . According to the manufacturer, such early demonstrations of the Alouette II had served to promote the performance and advantages of turbine helicopters over their piston-engined counterparts.

In April 1956, the first production Alouette II was completed, making it the first production turbine-powered helicopter in the world. Upon completion, several of the initial production models were dispatched for a series of evaluation flights in the Alps. On 13 June 1958, a single SE 3130, again flown by Boulet, re-took the altitude record, reaching a height of 10,984 m (36,027 ft). In 1964, a new version of the Alouette II was introduced, the &quot;SA 3180 Alouette II Astazou&quot; (originally called &quot;Alouette Astazou&quot;), using the Turbomeca Astazou IIA engine in place of the Artouste II. In 1975, production of the Alouette II ended after more than 1,300 had been built; in 1969, a new high-altitude variant, the Aérospatiale SA 315B Lama had been developed to replace it in this niche capacity. A slightly larger and more powerful helicopter in the form of the Aérospatiale Alouette III has also entered production, which had negatively impacted upon the demand for the older II model.

==Design==
The Aérospatiale Alouette II is a French light helicopter, incorporating many innovations of its time. It was powered by a single Turbomeca Artouste II turboshaft engine capable of generating a maximum output of 400 hp. The speed of the main rotor is controlled by an automated fuel supply governor, eliminating the necessity of a twist-grip throttle and a conventional link between the throttle and the collective-pitch. Instead, the Alouette II uses a simple control lever arrangement, which acts to directly regulate the collective-pitch and actuate the governor while immediately and automatically applying the correct level of power to conform with flight condition. Without a clutch, the transmission is considerably simplified in both design and maintenance aspects.

Despite being a light helicopter, the Alouette II possesses a reasonable lift capacity and can carry underslung loads on an external sling; during one high-profile public demonstration, one helicopter was able to air-lift a compact Citroen truck weighing in excess of half a ton without visible difficulty. While flying at sea level, the Alouette II uses only 300 of the powerplant&#x27;s available 400 hp; accordingly, performance can be maintained while operated at a high altitude and within tropical conditions where the additional power would come into play. It was capable of flying at altitudes of up to 2,286 meters above sea level while possessing an average climb rate of 250 meters per minute and a typical maximum range of 563 miles. Various alternative landing gear configurations could be fitted, including skids, wheels, or pontoons.

The Alouette II is capable of accommodating a seating arrangement for up to five personnel, including the pilot; access to the cabin was provided via a pair of side-hinged doors. The compact cockpit was provided with a dome-shaped windscreen which provided for excellent levels of external visibility. The Alouette II also made innovative use of armaments. It was the first helicopter worldwide to be equipped with anti-tank munitions in the form of the SS.11 MCLOS wire-guided anti-tank missile. In addition to anti-tank missiles, the French Army chose to arm their Alouette IIs with machine guns, while the French Navy outfitted theirs with aerial torpedoes to conduct anti-submarine warfare (ASW) duties.

Under operational conditions, the Alouette II often proved to be a relatively maintenance-intensive rotorcraft. It required a high level of regular lubrication, the main rotorhead alone featuring 20 grease nipples that had to be re-lubricated after every five flight hours, while the drive shaft for the tail rotor was similarly demanding. Due to its high susceptibility to dust ingestion, some operators would have to remove the Alouette&#x27;s rectangular sand filters after every landing in order to clean them.

==Operational history==
On 3 July 1956, prior to even entering civil service, the Alouette II was responsible for breaking new ground when it became the first helicopter to perform a mountain rescue mission, having been deployed to evacuate a mountaineer who had suffered from cardiac arrest at over . On 3 January 1957, the Alouette II was called upon again in order to rescue the crew of a crashed Sikorsky S-58, which had been searching for missing mountaineers Jean Vincendon and François Henry on Mont Blanc.

On 2 May 1957, following a series of airborne trials, the Alouette II was awarded a French domestic certificate of airworthiness, which cleared the type to enter service with civil operators. Initial production was allocated to fulfil those orders placed by the French military, as well as by civilian customers. During 1957, the first deliveries of the Alouette II were made to the French Army. Shortly thereafter, large-scale orders for the type were received from several foreign nations, including the United Kingdom, Federal Republic of Germany, and Austria.

Almost immediately upon entering service, French forces commenced active combat operations using their fledgling Alouette II fleet; the type being placed into heavy use in the Algerian War, during which it made valuable contributions to France&#x27;s activities in the theatre. When used as a troop-transport, up to four fully equipped soldiers could be airlifted at a time. Additionally, a number of Alouette IIs were modified to become what has been argued by some to have been the world&#x27;s first helicopter gunships; in this capacity, it would have been typically armed with Nord Aviation-built SS.10 or SS.11 anti-tank missiles.
The nation of Rhodesia emerged as a prolific user of both the Alouette II and its enlarged sibling, the Alouette III. Early operations were flown with an emphasis on its use by the Army and British South Africa Police, including paramilitary and aerial reconnaissance operations. Throughout the 1960s, the type progressively spread into additional roles, including aerial supply, casualty evacuation, communications relays, and troop-transports. Rhodesian aerial operations would typically involve flying under relatively high and hot conditions, which reduced the efficiency of aircraft in general; however, the Alouette II proved to be both hardy and relatively resistant to battle damage. In order to extend the inadequate range of the type, fuel caches were strategically deployed across the country to be used for refuelling purposes.

In order to improve performance, Rhodesia&#x27;s Alouette II fleet was subject to extensive modifications, including changes to their refuelling apparatus, gun sights, cabin fittings, armouring, and armaments. Over time, the Rhodesian Security Forces developed an innovative deployment tactic of rapidly encircling and enveloping enemies, known as the Fireforce, for which the Alouette II served as a core component. The quick-reaction Fireforce battalions were centred at Centenary and Mount Darwin; emphasis was placed on locating both rotorcraft and troops as close to a current or anticipated theatre of operations as would be feasibly possible.

By 1975, at which point production of the type was terminated, in excess of 1,300 Alouette IIs had been constructed. The rotorcraft was also in use in over 80 countries, including 47 separate armed forces. The Alouette II was produced and sold under licence by Brazil, Sweden, India and in the United States. While succeeded in some respects by the SA 315B Lama, which was itself a derivative of the Alouette II; the French Army ultimately replaced their Alouette II fleet with a newly developed observation and reconnaissance helicopter in the form of the Aérospatiale AS350 Écureuil.

During July 2018, a single Alouette II was involved in the helicopter prison escape of the French gangster Rédoine Faïd. The rotorcraft, which had been hijacked by gang members who held the pilot hostage at gunpoint, flew into the courtyard of Réau prison, before flying to Roissy in the north-eastern suburbs of Paris; the event allegedly occurred in under ten minutes from take-off to escape.

<text>Angelo Bortolo Bertelli (June 18, 1921 – June 26, 1999) was an American football quarterback who played in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). He played college football for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, where he won the Heisman Trophy in 1943.

==Early life==
Bertelli was born in West Springfield, Massachusetts, on June 18, 1921, to Italian immigrant parents. At Cathedral High School in Springfield, he won all-state honors in football, baseball, and hockey, and was senior class president.

==College career==
When Bertelli entered Notre Dame in 1940, he was 6 feet 1 inch and 173 pounds, a skinny but highly regarded tailback in the single-wing formation used by most college teams. When Coach Elmer Layden left to become commissioner of the National Football League, Notre Dame&#x27;s new coach Frank Leahy immediately noticed Bertelli&#x27;s passing talents.

As a sophomore, Bertelli, still a single-wing tailback, led the nation with a 56.9 percent passing average, completing 70 of 123 attempts. In 1942, Leahy switched to a modified T formation, in which Bertelli would play under the center and take every snap. As he told his budding star, &quot;Bert, you&#x27;re the finest passer and the worst runner I&#x27;ve ever coached.&quot; That summer, preparing for his new role, Bertelli said he took &quot;a thousand snaps...maybe a million.&quot; Bertelli and the T-formation were an immediate success. He passed for 1,039 yards and 10 touchdowns. Celebrated sportswriter Grantland Rice referenced Bertelli as &quot;the T-formation magician.&quot;

During his senior year in 1943, the Marine Corps activated Bertelli after six games of Notre Dame&#x27;s 10-game season. In the six games Bertelli started in, he threw 36 passes, completing 25 with 10 touchdowns. Bertelli&#x27;s six-game 1943 performance was enough to win the Heisman Trophy earning 648 votes; he was informed of his Heisman win while in boot camp at Parris Island. During Bertelli&#x27;s three seasons, Notre Dame lost only three games. In 1943, Notre Dame won 43 to 5 on average.

Bertelli&#x27;s collegiate career earned him multiple awards. He was named to the 1942 and 1943 All-American teams. In the Heisman voting for America&#x27;s outstanding college football player, Bertelli finished second in 1941 and sixth in 1942 before capturing the trophy in 1943. Though he was on active duty with the Marine Corps, the Boston Yanks selected Bertelli as their number one draft choice in 1944. Bertelli was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1972.

==Military service==
While at Notre Dame, Bertelli enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserves in 1942 prior to his activation to active duty in the fall of 1943. In 1944, Bertelli was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant, where he served as an infantry and recreation officer. After stops at Quantico, Camp Lejeune and Camp Pendleton, Bertelli embarked to participate in combat operations in the Pacific. After arriving from Guam in February 1945, he served in the Battle of Iwo Jima as a liaison officer with the 21st Marine Regiment, where he was nearly killed when a Japanese mortar shell landed 15 feet away from his position; four others were also caught in the explosion, with a doctor suffering serious wounds but surviving.

Bertelli returned to Guam in March 1945 and served in Sasebo, Japan. When World War II ended, Bertelli was stationed in Nagasaki with the 2nd Marine Division as a second lieutenant. On January 1, 1946, he captained a Marine football team, the Nagasaki Bears, in the Atom Bowl against National Football League star Bill Osmanski and his Isahaya Tigers, where he threw two touchdown passes in the first half; although the two had promised to ensure the game end in a tie to promote unit morale, Osmanski scored the game-winning extra point in the 14–13 Tiger win. Bertelli&#x27;s son Mike quipped in 2005, &quot;My dad didn&#x27;t lose any sleep over it, but of all the games he played in, he remembered that incident.&quot;

Bertelli later entered the United States Marine Corps Reserve where he was promoted to the rank of captain and served until 1957.

==Professional career==
After returning to the United States in 1946, Bertelli signed with the Los Angeles Dons of the AAFC; he also recruited Atom Bowl players Bill Joslin and Gorham Graham, who were still stationed in Japan, to play with him. Bertelli played for the Chicago Rockets between 1947 and 1948. After several knee surgeries, he retired prior to the 1949 season. After his retirement from professional football, Bertelli moved to Clifton, New Jersey, and operated several businesses, with Bertelli Enterprises, Inc. becoming a retail liquor outlet.

He was the color analyst for the Princeton University football games broadcast on radio station WVNJ, 620 AM and 100.3 FM in the 1950s and 60s.

==Death and family==
On June 26, 1999, Bertelli died at the age of 78 after a losing battle with brain cancer. He was buried in Immaculate Conception Cemetery, Montclair.

He was survived by his wife, the former Gilda Passerini whom he married in 1944, and four children. Bertelli is the father of Robert Bertelli, better known as Bob Bert, a musician who played in Sonic Youth and other bands.

<text>The United Kingdom Local Government Act 1988 (c. 9) is an act of the United Kingdom Parliament. It was famous for its controversial section 28. This section prohibited local authorities from promoting, in a specified category of schools, &quot;the teaching of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship&quot;.
The act included a number of other provisions affecting local authorities. Part I introduced compulsory tendering of contracts for certain types of activities. Part II dealt with aspects of public sector contracting. Part III allowed housing authorities to provide financial assistance to people living in private property. Section 38, part of the &quot;miscellaneous and general&quot; coverage of Part IV, abolished dog licences.

==Part 1==
Part 1 of the act provided for the following activities to be subject to compulsory competitive tendering (CCT):
*refuse collection
*cleaning of buildings and &quot;other cleaning&quot;
*school and welfare catering
*&quot;other catering&quot;
*grounds maintenance
*vehicle repair and maintenance.

==Section 17==
Section 17(1) stipulates that public bodies covered by the Act are not permitted to take &quot;non-commercial considerations&quot; into account when carrying out their functions relating to awarding contracts. The Act lists non-commercial matters relating to public supply or works contracts, including terms and conditions of employment offered by contractors to their workers, the involvement of contractors with irrelevant fields of Government policy, and the conduct of contractors or workers in industrial disputes.

In 2000, the Employment Sub-committee of the House of Commons Education and Employment Select Committee suggested that this requirement needed to be amended so that local councils could address local employment gaps by including local labour clauses in appropriate contracts.

==Section 28==

Section 28 stated that a local authority &quot;shall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality&quot; or &quot;promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship&quot;. This section was repealed in 2000.

<text>The stained-glass ceiling is a sociological phenomenon in religious communities similar to the concept of the &quot;glass ceiling&quot;. This concept revolves around the apparent difficulty for women who seek to gain a role within church leadership. The use of the term &quot;stained-glass ceiling&quot; is metaphorical, indicating a certain level of power or authority within structures that women tend not to rise above within church hierarchies. This could range from a group&#x27;s &quot;de jure&quot; barring of women from positions like priest, bishop, pastor, rabbi, or similar clerical figures, to gender discrimination at the level of local congregations that prevent women from rising to any role of particular status or power.

The stained-glass ceiling is a particular aspect of a broader trend of gender segregation and discrimination in religious communities, by use defined social roles and barriers typically justified by either tradition, dogma, or doctrine of the church group.

The phrase &quot;stained-glass&quot; refers to the frequent placement of stained-glass artwork in places of Christian worship.

==Statistics==
Among the most significant examples of resistance to female clergy has been in the position of senior pastor in large church settings. For example, in the United Methodist Church only two female ministers have ever led churches with membership numbers within the top 100 of United Methodist churches in the U.S. The most recent national data (2005) indicates that there are no female ministers currently leading top 100 membership UMCs. Resistance has eased more rapidly for the position of bishop in the United Methodist Church. For 2004–2008, 15 of the 50 (30%) United Methodist bishops serving the U.S. are women.

==Notable people==
* Marjorie Matthews, elected bishop in the United Methodist Church in 1980. She was the first woman elected as a bishop by a U.S. mainline Christian denomination.
* Julie Pennington-Russell, Senior Pastor of First Baptist Church (Decatur, Georgia)(8/2007–present). The largest church affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention with a woman as senior pastor (weekly worship attendance of 483/ 2,696 members &quot;1,804 resident and 892 non-resident&quot;).
* Barbara Harris – the first woman ordained as a bishop in the Anglican Communion (1989)
* Katharine Jefferts Schori – the first woman elected as a primate of the worldwide Anglican Communion (2006)
* Elizabeth Eaton – the first woman elected as presiding bishop in the Evangelical Church in America (2013)

<doc id="1272729" wikidata="Q969037" url="?curid=1272729" title="The Man Who">
<text>The Man Who is the second studio album by the Scottish rock band Travis. The album was released on 24 May 1999 through Independiente. It saw a change in musical direction for the band, moving away from the rockier tone of their debut &quot;Good Feeling&quot; (1997). Four singles were released: &quot;Writing to Reach You&quot;, &quot;Driftwood&quot;, and the top 10 hits &quot;Why Does It Always Rain on Me?&quot; and &quot;Turn&quot;.

&quot;The Man Who&quot; initially received mixed reviews and sold slowly. Boosted by the success of &quot;Why Does It Always Rain on Me?&quot; and the band&#x27;s appearance at the 1999 Glastonbury Festival, it eventually spent a total of 9 weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart and brought the band international recognition, with retrospective reviews being more positive. , according to Concord Music, &quot;The Man Who&quot; has sold over 3.5 million copies worldwide. It was among ten albums nominated for the best British album of the previous 30 years by the Brit Awards in 2010, losing to &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; by Oasis.

==Background and recording==
&quot;The Man Who&quot; was produced by Nigel Godrich and partially recorded at producer Mike Hedges&#x27;s chateau in France. The majority of the songs were written before the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Good Feeling&quot; (1997) was released; &quot;Writing to Reach You&quot;, &quot;The Fear&quot; and &quot;Luv&quot; were written around 1995–96, while &quot;As You Are&quot;, &quot;Turn&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s So Strange&quot; date back as far as 1993 and the &quot;Glass Onion&quot; EP. The band continued recording at studios including RAK Studios and Abbey Road Studios in London. &quot;[&quot;Good Feeling&quot;] was recorded with no trickery and it became this supposedly &#x27;schizophrenic&#x27; record,&quot; said bass guitarist Dougie Payne. &quot;[&quot;The Man Who&quot;] was recorded over six months in six different studios, using more instrumentation, and it&#x27;s turned into this weirdly cohesive piece of work.&quot;

The title &quot;The Man Who&quot; is derived from the book &quot;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat&quot; (1985) by neurologist Oliver Sacks. The album&#x27;s sleeve notes include a dedication to film director Stanley Kubrick, who had died a few months prior to the album&#x27;s release.

==Reception==

The initial reception of &quot;The Man Who&quot; was mixed, with some publications that had previously praised the band&#x27;s more rock-oriented album &quot;Good Feeling&quot; criticizing the shift towards melodic and melancholic material. Stuart Bailie of &quot;NME&quot; expressed dissatisfaction with the band&#x27;s decision to move away from the &quot;rowdy&quot; elements of &quot;Good Feeling&quot; and create an album filled with ballads. Despite acknowledging some good songs, he suggested that Travis would be better off if they moved away from making sad classic records. Danny Eccleston of &quot;Q&quot; magazine noted that &quot;The Man Who&quot; loses its momentum after the first four songs, and the rest of the album is excessively tasteful, missing some of the enchanting qualities found in &quot;Good Feeling&quot;. However, Steve Lowe of &quot;Select&quot; found the album to showcase the band&#x27;s ability to create pretty music, describing them as ordinary guys crafting extraordinary melodies and being good songwriters without trying too hard.

Although &quot;The Man Who&quot; initially appeared to follow the success of &quot;Good Feeling&quot; by entering the UK Albums Chart at number five, it faced a decline in the charts due to limited radio play of its singles and its lukewarm critical reception. However, the third single from the album, &quot;Why Does It Always Rain on Me?&quot;, gained significant popularity and helped raise awareness of the band. Travis&#x27; performance of the song at the 1999 Glastonbury Festival, where rain began to fall as soon as the first line was sung, garnered media attention and increased word-of-mouth interest. Coupled with radio play of &quot;Why Does It Always Rain on Me?&quot; and the album&#x27;s other singles, &quot;The Man Who&quot; eventually climbed back up the charts and reached the number one spot on the UK Albums Chart. It went on to become the third best-selling album of the year in the UK.

By the end of the year, the album&#x27;s critical standing had improved dramatically. &quot;Select&quot; named &quot;The Man Who&quot; the best album of 1999, and the album also placed on the year-end lists of publications such as &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;Mojo&quot;, &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;. &quot;The Man Who&quot; won the award for Best Album at the 2000 Brit Awards, with Travis being named Best British Group. At the Ivor Novello Awards, Travis frontman Fran Healy won the awards for Best Songwriter(s) and Best Contemporary Song for &quot;Why Does It Always Rain on Me?&quot; &quot;The Man Who&quot; received a belated American release in early 2000, and the same year Travis undertook an extensive 237-gig world tour, including headlining the 2000 Glastonbury, T in the Park and V Festivals, and a US tour leg with Oasis.

==Legacy==
In 2006, &quot;The Man Who&quot; was named the 70th greatest album of all time by &quot;Q&quot;. At the Brit Awards 2010, it was nominated for the Best Album of the Past 30 Years award, losing to Oasis&#x27;s &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; The album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. , &quot;The Man Who&quot; has sold 2,687,500 copies in the UK.

<doc id="1272738" wikidata="Q957589" url="?curid=1272738" title="Tunneling protocol">
<text>In computer networks, a tunneling protocol is a communication protocol which allows for the movement of data from one network to another. They can, for example, allow private network communications to be sent across a public network (such as the Internet), or for one network protocol to be carried over an incompatible network, through a process called encapsulation.

Because tunneling involves repackaging the traffic data into a different form, perhaps with encryption as standard, it can hide the nature of the traffic that is run through a tunnel.

Tunneling protocols work by using the data portion of a packet (the payload) to carry the packets that actually provide the service. Tunneling uses a layered protocol model such as those of the OSI or TCP/IP protocol suite, but usually violates the layering when using the payload to carry a service not normally provided by the network. Typically, the delivery protocol operates at an equal or higher level in the layered model than the payload protocol.

== Uses ==
A tunneling protocol may, for example, allow a foreign protocol to run over a network that does not support that particular protocol, such as running IPv6 over IPv4.

Another important use is to provide services that are impractical or unsafe to be offered using only the underlying network services, such as providing a corporate network address to a remote user whose physical network address is not part of the corporate network.

=== Circumventing firewall policy ===
Users can also use tunneling to &quot;sneak through&quot; a firewall, using a protocol that the firewall would normally block, but &quot;wrapped&quot; inside a protocol that the firewall does not block, such as HTTP. If the firewall policy does not specifically exclude this kind of &quot;wrapping&quot;, this trick can function to get around the intended firewall policy (or any set of interlocked firewall policies).

Another HTTP-based tunneling method uses the HTTP CONNECT method/command. A client issues the HTTP CONNECT command to an HTTP proxy. The proxy then makes a TCP connection to a particular server:port, and relays data between that server:port and the client connection. Because this creates a security hole, CONNECT-capable HTTP proxies commonly restrict access to the CONNECT method. The proxy allows connections only to specific ports, such as 443 for HTTPS.

Other tunneling methods able to bypass network firewalls make use of different protocols such as DNS, MQTT, SMS.

== Technical overview ==
As an example of network layer over network layer, Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE), a protocol running over IP (IP protocol number 47), often serves to carry IP packets, with RFC 1918 private addresses, over the Internet using delivery packets with public IP addresses. In this case, the delivery and payload protocols are the same, but the payload addresses are incompatible with those of the delivery network.

It is also possible to establish a connection using the data link layer. The Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) allows the transmission of frames between two nodes. A tunnel is not encrypted by default: the TCP/IP protocol chosen determines the level of security.

SSH uses port 22 to enable data encryption of payloads being transmitted over a public network (such as the Internet) connection, thereby providing VPN functionality. IPsec has an end-to-end Transport Mode, but can also operate in a tunneling mode through a trusted security gateway.

To understand a particular protocol stack imposed by tunneling, network engineers must understand both the payload and delivery protocol sets.

== Common tunneling protocols ==
* IP in IP (IP protocol 4): IP in IPv4/IPv6
* SIT/IPv6 (IP protocol 41): IPv6 in IPv4/IPv6
* GRE (IP protocol 47): Generic Routing Encapsulation
* OpenVPN (UDP port 1194)
* SSTP (TCP port 443): Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol
* IPSec (IP protocols 50 and 51): Internet Protocol Security
* L2TP (UDP port 1701): Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol
* L2TPv3 (IP protocol 115): Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol version 3
* VXLAN (UDP port 4789): Virtual Extensible Local Area Network
* PPTP (TCP port 1723 for control, GRE for data): Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol
* PPPoE (EtherType 0x8863 for control, 0x8864 for data): Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet
* GENEVE
* WireGuard (UDP dynamic port)

== TCP meltdown problem ==

Tunneling a TCP-&quot;encapsulating&quot; payload (such as PPP) over a TCP-based connection (such as SSH&#x27;s port forwarding) is known as &quot;TCP-over-TCP&quot;, and doing so can induce a dramatic loss in transmission performance — known as the &quot;TCP meltdown problem&quot; which is why virtual private network (VPN) software may instead use a protocol simpler than TCP for the tunnel connection. TCP meltdown occurs when a TCP connection is stacked on top of another. The underlying layer may detect a problem and attempt to compensate, and the layer above it then overcompensates because of that, and this overcompensation causes said delays and degraded transmission performance.

== Secure Shell tunneling ==
A &quot;Secure Shell (SSH) tunnel&quot; consists of an encrypted tunnel created through an SSH protocol connection. Users may set up SSH tunnels to transfer unencrypted traffic over a network through an encrypted channel. It is a software-based approach to network security and the result is transparent encryption.

For example, Microsoft Windows machines can share files using the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, a non-encrypted protocol. If one were to mount a Microsoft Windows file-system remotely through the Internet, someone snooping on the connection could see transferred files. To mount the Windows file-system securely, one can establish a SSH tunnel that routes all SMB traffic to the remote fileserver through an encrypted channel. Even though the SMB protocol itself contains no encryption, the encrypted SSH channel through which it travels offers security.
Once an SSH connection has been established, the tunnel starts with SSH listening to a port on the remote or local host. Any connections to it are forwarded to the specified address and port originating from the opposing (remote or local, as previously) host.

The #TCP meltdown problem is often not a problem when using OpenSSH&#x27;s port forwarding, because many use cases do not entail TCP-over-TCP tunneling; the meltdown is avoided because the OpenSSH client processes the local, client-side TCP connection in order to get to the actual payload that is being sent, and then sends that payload directly through the tunnel&#x27;s own TCP connection to the server side, where the OpenSSH server similarly &quot;unwraps&quot; the payload in order to &quot;wrap&quot; it up again for routing to its final destination. Naturally, this wrapping and unwrapping also occurs in the reverse direction of the bidirectional tunnel.

SSH tunnels provide a means to bypass firewalls that prohibit certain Internet services so long as a site allows outgoing connections. For example, an organization may prohibit a user from accessing Internet web pages (port 80) directly without passing through the organization&#x27;s proxy filter (which provides the organization with a means of monitoring and controlling what the user sees through the web). But users may not wish to have their web traffic monitored or blocked by the organization&#x27;s proxy filter. If users can connect to an external SSH server, they can create an SSH tunnel to forward a given port on their local machine to port 80 on a remote web server. To access the remote web server, users would point their browser to the local port at http://localhost/

Some SSH clients support dynamic port forwarding that allows the user to create a SOCKS 4/5 proxy. In this case users can configure their applications to use their local SOCKS proxy server. This gives more flexibility than creating an SSH tunnel to a single port as previously described. SOCKS can free the user from the limitations of connecting only to a predefined remote port and server. If an application does not support SOCKS, a proxifier can be used to redirect the application to the local SOCKS proxy server. Some proxifiers, such as Proxycap, support SSH directly, thus avoiding the need for an SSH client.

In recent versions of OpenSSH it is even allowed to create layer 2 or layer 3 tunnels if both ends have enabled such tunneling capabilities. This creates codice_1 (layer 3, default) or codice_2 (layer 2) virtual interfaces on both ends of the connection. This allows normal network management and routing to be used, and when used on routers, the traffic for an entire subnetwork can be tunneled. A pair of codice_2 virtual interfaces function like an Ethernet cable connecting both ends of the connection and can join kernel bridges.

== Cyberattacks based on tunneling ==
Over the years, tunneling and data encapsulation in general have been frequently adopted for malicious reasons, in order to maliciously communicate outside of a protected network.

In this context, known tunnels involve protocols such as HTTP, SSH, DNS, MQTT.

<doc id="1272743" wikidata="Q1332167" url="?curid=1272743" title="Volume of distribution">
<text>In pharmacology, the volume of distribution (VD, also known as apparent volume of distribution, literally, &quot;volume of dilution&quot;) is the theoretical volume that would be necessary to contain the total amount of an administered drug at the same concentration that it is observed in the blood plasma. In other words, it is the ratio of &quot;amount of drug in a body (dose)&quot; to &quot;concentration of the drug that is measured in blood, plasma, and un-bound in interstitial fluid&quot;.

The VD of a drug represents the degree to which a drug is distributed in body tissue rather than the plasma. VD is directly proportional with the amount of drug distributed into tissue; a higher VD indicates a greater amount of tissue distribution. A VD greater than the total volume of body water (approximately 42 liters in humans) is possible, and would indicate that the drug is highly distributed into tissue. In other words, the volume of distribution is smaller in the drug staying in the plasma than that of a drug that is widely distributed in tissues.

In rough terms, drugs with a high lipid solubility (non-polar drugs), low rates of ionization, or low plasma protein binding capabilities have higher volumes of distribution than drugs which are more polar, more highly ionized or exhibit high plasma protein binding in the body&#x27;s environment. Volume of distribution may be increased by kidney failure (due to fluid retention) and liver failure (due to altered body fluid and plasma protein binding). Conversely it may be decreased in dehydration.

The initial volume of distribution describes blood concentrations prior to attaining the apparent volume of distribution and uses the same formula.

==Equations==
The volume of distribution is given by the following equation:

:::::::formula_1

Therefore, the dose required to give a certain plasma concentration can be determined if the VD for that drug is known. The VD is not a physiological value; it is more a reflection of how a drug will distribute throughout the body depending on several physicochemical properties, e.g. solubility, charge, size, etc.

The unit for Volume of Distribution is typically reported in litres. As body composition changes with age, VD decreases.

The VD may also be used to determine how readily a drug will displace into the body tissue compartments relative to the blood:

:::::::formula_2

Where:

* VP = plasma volume
* VT = apparent tissue volume
* fu = fraction unbound in plasma
* fuT = fraction unbound in tissue

==Examples==
If you administer a dose D of a drug intravenously in one go (IV-bolus), you would naturally expect it to have an immediate blood concentration formula_3 which directly corresponds to the amount of blood contained in the body formula_4. Mathematically this would be:

formula_5

But this is generally not what happens. Instead you observe that the drug has distributed out into some other volume (read organs/tissue). So probably the first question you want to ask is: how much of the drug is no longer in the blood stream?
The volume of distribution formula_6 quantifies just that by specifying how big a volume you would need in order to observe the blood concentration actually measured.

An example for a simple case (mono-compartmental) would be to administer D=8 mg/kg to a human. A human has a blood volume of around formula_70.08 L/kg 
This gives a formula_8100 μg/mL if the drug stays in the blood stream only, and thus its volume of distribution is the same as formula_4 that is formula_10 0.08 L/kg. If the drug distributes into all body water the volume of distribution would increase to approximately formula_100.57 L/kg
If the drug readily diffuses into the body fat the volume of distribution may increase dramatically, an example is chloroquine which has a formula_10250-302 L/kg
In the simple mono-compartmental case the volume of distribution is defined as: formula_13, where the formula_3 in practice is an extrapolated concentration at time = 0 from the first early plasma concentrations after an IV-bolus administration (generally taken around 5 min - 30 min after giving the drug).

<doc id="1272745" wikidata="Q7609925" url="?curid=1272745" title="Stephen Maxwell">
<text>Stephen Maxwell (11 October 1942 – 24 April 2012) was a Scottish nationalist politician and intellectual and, from the 1980s, a leading figure in the Scottish voluntary sector.

==Early life==
Born in 1942 in Edinburgh to a Scottish medical family, he was brought up in Yorkshire, England, where his father, John, accepted a job as a surgeon on return from service in India during the Second World War. Maxwell was educated at Pocklington School, Yorkshire, and at 17 won a scholarship to study Moral Sciences at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. After graduating from Cambridge he made an unsuccessful attempt to move into journalism before going on to study for an MA in International Relations at the London School of Economics. On completion of the MA (for which he was awarded a distinction) he spent two years working on a PhD thesis on the irrationality of nuclear deterrence, also at the LSE.

==Life==
In the late 1960s he abandoned academia in England and returned to Scotland, where he balanced his work at the University of Edinburgh with campaigning for the Scottish National Party (SNP). In 1973, at the age of 31, he was appointed Head of Press for the SNP. His friend Owen Dudley Edwards, an Irish-born Edinburgh historian, remembers his press briefings as unique: &quot;Hostile journalists were staggered to hear him explain that their objections to this or that in the party were not really rewarding subjects but that a more useful question to raise would be this other.&quot;

During the 1970s Maxwell played a formative role in developing the SNP&#x27;s industrial and defence policies and became known as one of the most radical and articulate figures in the party. In 1979 he directed the SNP&#x27;s campaign for a Yes vote in the referendum on Scottish devolution. The campaign was ultimately unsuccessful and heralded the start of a period of decline in the SNP&#x27;s fortunes.

In 1979 Maxwell, together with Margo MacDonald, Owen Dudley Edwards and a number of younger nationalist activists (including Alex Salmond and Kenny MacAskill) established the 79 Group, a left-wing faction within the SNP. Maxwell stood as the group&#x27;s candidate in the 1979 Scottish National Party leadership election, taking a distant second place. In 1981 Maxwell wrote and published a pamphlet, The Case for Left-Wing Nationalism, which became the 79 Group&#x27;s defining statement. Later that year, the 79 Group was expelled by the party leadership, partly because of its alleged affiliations to Irish republicanism.

Throughout the 1980s Maxwell wrote extensively for periodicals, including &quot;The Bulletin of Scottish Politics&quot;, &quot;Cencrastus&quot; and &quot;Radical Scotland&quot;. Following a second failed attempt to move into journalism, he became involved with the Scottish Council of Voluntary Organisations (SCVO).

He worked for the SCVO until he retired from his post as Associate Director in 2009. Between 2010 and his death in April 2012 he chaired the Scottish Urban Regeneration Forum and worked on a book, Arguing for Independence: Evidence, Risk and the Wicked Issues, which examines six cases for Scottish independence: the democratic, the economic, the social, the international, the cultural and the environmental. It was published in September 2012.

Upon his hearing of Maxwell&#x27;s death, Scottish First Minister and SNP leader Alex Salmond said, &quot;During Stephen’s long career he made an immense contribution to the national movement in Scotland, and was a key figure in the development of the modern SNP. But Stephen’s loss will be felt much more widely than just politics. Over a quarter of a century with the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, Stephen was a tireless campaigner for the third sector in Scotland, helping it through the difficult days of the 1980s and establishing it as a major force in post-devolution Scotland. Above all, I will remember Stephen’s courtesy to all, his extraordinary intellect combined with gentle persuasiveness, and his lifelong service to others.&quot;

==Death==
He died on 24 April 2012, aged 69. He is survived by his wife Sally, his children Luke, Katie and Jamie and his brother Peter.

<text>The antennas contained in mobile phones, including smartphones, emit radiofrequency (RF) radiation (non-ionizing &quot;radio waves&quot; such as microwaves); the parts of the head or body nearest to the antenna can absorb this energy and convert it to heat or to synchronised molecular vibrations (the term &#x27;heat&#x27;, properly applies only to disordered molecular motion). Since at least the 1990s, scientists have researched whether the now-ubiquitous radiation associated with mobile phone antennas or cell phone towers is affecting human health. Mobile phone networks use various bands of RF radiation, some of which overlap with the microwave range. Other digital wireless systems, such as data communication networks, produce similar radiation.

In response to public concern, the World Health Organization (WHO) established the &quot;International EMF (Electric and Magnetic Fields) Project&quot; in 1996 to assess the scientific evidence of possible health effects of EMF in the frequency range from 0 to 300 GHz. They have stated that although extensive research has been conducted into possible health effects of exposure to many parts of the frequency spectrum, all reviews conducted so far have indicated that, as long as exposures are below the limits recommended in the ICNIRP (1998) EMF guidelines, which cover the full frequency range from 0–300 GHz, such exposures do not produce any known adverse health effect. In 2011, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an agency of the WHO, classified wireless radiation as Group 2B – possibly carcinogenic. That means that there &quot;could be some risk&quot; of carcinogenicity, so additional research into the long-term, heavy use of wireless devices needs to be conducted. The WHO states that &quot;A large number of studies have been performed over the last two decades to assess whether mobile phones pose a potential health risk. To date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use.&quot; 

In 2018 the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) published the results of its ten year, $30 million study of the effects of radio frequency radiation on laboratory rodents, which found &#x27;clear evidence&#x27; of malignant heart tumors (schwannomas) and &#x27;some evidence&#x27; of malignant gliomas and adrenal tumors in male rats. In 2019, the NTP scientists published an article stating that RF scientists found evidence of &#x27;significant&#x27; DNA damage in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of male rat brains and the blood cells of female mice. In 2018 the Ramazzini Cancer Research Institute study of cell phone radiation and cancer published its results and conclusion that &#x27;The RI findings on far field exposure to RFR are consistent with and reinforce the results of the NTP study on near field exposure, as both reported an increase in the incidence of tumors of the brain and heart in RFR-exposed Sprague-Dawley rats. These tumors are of the same histotype of those observed in some epidemiological studies on cell phone users. These experimental studies provide sufficient evidence to call for the re-evaluation of IARC conclusions regarding the carcinogenic potential of RFR in humans.’ 

International guidelines on exposure levels to microwave frequency EMFs such as ICNIRP limit the power levels of wireless devices and it is uncommon for wireless devices to exceed the guidelines. These guidelines only take into account thermal effects and not the findings of biological effects published in the NTP and Ramazzini Institute studies. The official stance of the British Health Protection Agency (HPA) is that &quot;there is no consistent evidence to date that Wi-Fi and WLANs adversely affect the health of the general population&quot;, but also that &quot;it is a sensible precautionary approach ... to keep the situation under ongoing review ...&quot;. In a 2018 statement, the FDA said that &quot;the current safety limits are set to include a 50-fold safety margin from observed effects of Radio-frequency energy exposure&quot;.

==Exposure==

===Mobile phones ===
A mobile phone connects to the telephone network by radio waves exchanged with a local antenna and automated transceiver called a cellular base station (&quot;cell site&quot; or &quot;cell tower&quot;). The service area served by each provider is divided into small geographical areas called &quot;cells&quot;, and all the phones in a cell communicate with that cell&#x27;s antenna. Both the phone and the tower have radio transmitters which communicate with each other. Since in a cellular network the same radio channels are reused every few cells, cellular networks use low power transmitters to avoid radio waves from one cell spilling over and interfering with a nearby cell using the same frequencies.

Mobile phones are limited to an effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) output of 3 watts, and the network continuously adjusts the phone transmitter to the lowest power consistent with good signal quality, reducing it to as low as one milliwatt when near the cell tower. Tower channel transmitters usually have an EIRP power output of around 50 watts. Even when it is not being used, unless it is turned off, a mobile phone
periodically emits radio signals on its control channel, to keep contact with its cell tower and for functions like handing off the phone to another tower if the user crosses into another cell. When the user is making a call, the phone transmits a signal on a second channel which carries the user&#x27;s voice. Existing 2G, 3G, and 4G networks use frequencies in the UHF or low microwave bands, 600 MHz to 3.5 GHz. Many household wireless devices such as WiFi networks, garage door openers, and baby monitors use other frequencies in this same frequency range.

Radio waves decrease rapidly in intensity by the inverse square of distance as they spread out from a transmitting antenna. So the phone transmitter, which is held close to the user&#x27;s face when talking, is a much greater source of human exposure than the tower transmitter, which is typically at least hundreds of metres away from the user. A user can reduce their exposure by using a headset and keeping the phone itself farther away from their body.

Next generation 5G cellular networks, which began deploying in 2019, use higher frequencies in or near the millimetre wave band, 24 to 52 GHz. Millimetre waves are absorbed by atmospheric gases so 5G networks will use smaller cells than previous cellular networks, about the size of a city block. Instead of a cell tower, each cell will use an array of multiple small antennas mounted on existing buildings and utility poles. In general, millimetre waves penetrate less deeply into biological tissue than microwaves, and are mainly absorbed within the first centimetres of the body surface.

===Cordless phones ===
The HPA also says that due to the mobile phone&#x27;s adaptive power ability, a DECT cordless phone&#x27;s radiation could actually exceed the radiation of a mobile phone. The HPA explains that while the DECT cordless phone&#x27;s radiation has an average output power of 10 mW, it is actually in the form of 100 bursts per second of 250 mW, a strength comparable to some mobile phones.

===Wireless networking===
Most wireless LAN equipment is designed to work within predefined standards. Wireless access points are also often close to people, but the drop off in power over distance is fast, following the inverse-square law. However, wireless laptops are typically used close to people. WiFi had been anecdotally linked to electromagnetic hypersensitivity but research into electromagnetic hypersensitivity has found no systematic evidence supporting claims made by affected people.

Users of wireless networking devices are typically exposed for much longer periods than for mobile phones and the strength of wireless devices is not significantly less. Whereas a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) phone can range from 21 dBm (125 mW) for Power Class 4 to 33 dBm (2W) for Power class 1, a wireless router can range from a typical 15 dBm (30 mW) strength to 27 dBm (500 mW) on the high end.

However, wireless routers are typically located significantly farther away from users&#x27; heads than a phone the user is handling, resulting in far less exposure overall. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) says that if a person spends one year in a location with a WiFi hot spot, they will receive the same dose of radio waves as if they had made a 20-minute call on a mobile phone.

The HPA&#x27;s position is that &quot;... radio frequency (RF) exposures from WiFi are likely to be lower than those from mobile phones.&quot; It also saw &quot;... no reason why schools and others should not use WiFi equipment.&quot; In October 2007, the HPA launched a new &quot;systematic&quot; study into the effects of WiFi networks on behalf of the UK government, in order to calm fears that had appeared in the media in a recent period up to that time. Michael Clark of the HPA says published research on mobile phones and masts does not add up to an indictment of WiFi.

==Effects studied==
===Neurological Modulation===
Modulation of neurological function is possible using radiation in the range hundreds of GHz up to a few THz at relatively low energies (without significant heating or ionisation) achieving either beneficial or harmful effects. The relevant frequencies for neurological interaction are at or beyond the upper end of what is typically employed for consumer wireless devices and are thus expected to have poor penetration into human tissue. Many of the studies referenced in the review examined rodents rather than humans, thus overcoming the screening typically provided by the thicker skulls of larger mammals.

===Blood–brain barrier===
A 2010 review stated that &quot;The balance of experimental evidence does not support an effect of &#x27;non-thermal&#x27; radio frequency fields&quot; on the permeability of the blood–brain barrier, but noted that research on low frequency effects and effects in humans was sparse. A 2012 study of low-frequency radiation on humans found &quot;no evidence for acute effects of short-term mobile phone radiation on cerebral blood flow&quot;.

===Cancer===
There have been rumors that mobile phone use can cause cancer, but this has not been conclusively proven. The CDC states that no scientific evidence definitively answers whether mobile phone use causes cancer.

In a 2018 statement, the US Food and Drug Administration said that &quot;the current safety limits are set to include a 50-fold safety margin from observed effects of radiofrequency energy exposure&quot;.

A 2021 review found &quot;limited&quot; but &quot;sufficient&quot; evidence for radio frequencies in the range of 450 MHz to 6,000 MHz to be related to gliomas and acoustic neuromas in humans, however concluding also that &quot;... the evidence is not yet sufficiently strong to establish a direct relationship&quot;. Conclusions could not be drawn for higher frequencies due to insufficient adequate studies.

===Fertility and reproduction===
A decline in male sperm quality has been observed over several decades. Studies on the impact of mobile radiation on male fertility are conflicting, and the effects of the radio frequency electromagnetic radiation (RF-EMR) emitted by these devices on the reproductive systems are currently under active debate. A 2012 review concluded that &quot;together, the results of these studies have shown that RF-EMR decreases sperm count and motility and increases oxidative stress&quot;. A 2017 study of 153 men that attended an academic fertility clinic in Boston, Massachusetts found that self-reported mobile phone use was not related to semen quality, and that carrying a mobile phone in the pants pocket was not related to semen quality.

A 2021 review concluded 5G radio frequencies in the range of 450 MHz to 6,000 MHz affect male fertility, possibly affect female fertility, and may have adverse effects on the development of embryos, fetuses and newborns. Conclusions could not be drawn for higher frequencies due to insufficient adequate studies. The magnitude of the effect was not quantified. 

===Electromagnetic hypersensitivity===

Some users of mobile phones and similar devices have reported feeling various non-specific symptoms during and after use. Studies have failed to link any of these symptoms to electromagnetic exposure. In addition, EHS is not a recognized medical diagnosis.

===Glucose metabolism===
According to the National Cancer Institute, two small studies exploring whether and how mobile phone radiation affects brain glucose metabolism showed inconsistent results.

===Effects on children===
A report from the Australian Government&#x27;s Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) in June 2017 noted that:

=== Other organisms ===
Low-level EMF does have some effects on other organisms. Vian &quot;et al.&quot;, 2006 finds an effect of microwave on gene expression in plants.

==Base stations==

Experts consulted by France considered it was mandatory that the main antenna axis should not to be directly in front of a living place at a distance shorter than 100 metres. This recommendation was modified in 2003 to say that antennas located within a 100-metre radius of primary schools or childcare facilities should be better integrated into the city scape and was not included in a 2005 expert report. 
The &quot;Agence française de sécurité sanitaire environnementale&quot;, , says that there is no demonstrated short-term effect of electromagnetic fields on health, but that there are open questions for long-term effects, and that it is easy to reduce exposure via technological improvements. A 2020 study in &quot;Environmental Research&quot; found that &quot;Although direct causation of negative human health effects from RFR from cellular phone base stations has not been finalized, there is already enough medical and scientific evidence to warrant long-term liability concerns for companies deploying cellular phone towers&quot; and thus recommended voluntary setbacks from schools and hospitals.
==Safety standards and licensing==
To protect the population living around base stations and users of mobile handsets, governments and regulatory bodies adopt safety standards, which translate to limits on exposure levels below a certain value. There are many proposed national and international standards, but that of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) is the most respected one, and has been adopted so far by more than 80 countries. For radio stations, ICNIRP proposes two safety levels: one for occupational exposure, another one for the general population. Currently there are efforts underway to harmonize the different standards in existence.

Radio base licensing procedures have been established in the majority of urban spaces regulated either at municipal/county, provincial/state or national level. Mobile telephone service providers are, in many regions, required to obtain construction licenses, provide certification of antenna emission levels and assure compliance to ICNIRP standards and/or to other environmental legislation.

Many governmental bodies also require that competing telecommunication companies try to achieve sharing of towers so as to decrease environmental and cosmetic impact. This issue is an influential factor of rejection of installation of new antennas and towers in communities.

The safety standards in the US are set by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FCC has based its standards primarily on those standards established by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) a Congressionally chartered scientific organization located in the WDC area and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), specifically Subcommittee 4 of the &quot;International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety&quot;.

Switzerland has set safety limits lower than the ICNIRP limits for certain &quot;sensitive areas&quot; (classrooms, for example).

In March 2020, for the first time since 1998, ICNIRP updated its guidelines for exposures to frequencies over 6 GHz, including the frequencies used for 5G that are over 6 GHz. The Commission added a restriction on acceptable levels of exposure to the whole body, added a restriction on acceptable levels for brief exposures to small regions of the body, and reduced the maximum amount of exposure permitted over a small region of the body.

==Lawsuits==
In the US, personal injury lawsuits have been filed by individuals against manufacturers (including Motorola, NEC, Siemens, and Nokia) on the basis of allegations of causation of brain cancer and death. In US federal courts, expert testimony relating to science must be first evaluated by a judge, in a Daubert hearing, to be relevant and valid before it is admissible as evidence. In a 2002 case against Motorola, the plaintiffs alleged that the use of wireless handheld telephones could cause brain cancer and that the use of Motorola phones caused one plaintiff&#x27;s cancer. The judge ruled that no sufficiently reliable and relevant scientific evidence in support of either general or specific causation was proffered by the plaintiffs, accepted a motion to exclude the testimony of the plaintiffs&#x27; experts, and denied a motion to exclude the testimony of the defendants&#x27; experts.

Two separate cases in Italy, in 2009 and 2017, resulted in pensions being awarded to plaintiffs who had claimed their benign brain tumors were the result of prolonged mobile phone use in professional tasks, for 5–6 hours a day, which they ruled different from non-professional use.

In the UK Legal Action Against 5G sought a Judicial Review of the government&#x27;s plan to deploy 5G. If successful, the group was to be represented by Michael Mansfield QC, a prominent British barrister. This application was denied on the basis that the government had demonstrated that 5G was as safe as 4G, and that the applicants had brought their action too late.

==Precautions==

===Precautionary principle===
In 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that the precautionary principle could be voluntarily adopted in this case. It follows the recommendations of the European Community for environmental risks.

According to the WHO, the &quot;precautionary principle&quot; is &quot;a risk management policy applied in circumstances with a high degree of scientific uncertainty, reflecting the need to take action for a potentially serious risk without awaiting the results of scientific research.&quot; Other less stringent recommended approaches are prudent avoidance principle and as low as reasonably practicable. Although all of these are problematic in application, due to the widespread use and economic importance of wireless telecommunication systems in modern civilization, there is an increased popularity of such measures in the general public, though also evidence that such approaches may increase concern. They involve recommendations such as the minimization of usage, the limitation of use by at-risk population (e.g., children), the adoption of phones and microcells with as low as reasonably practicable levels of radiation, the wider use of hands-free and earphone technologies such as Bluetooth headsets, the adoption of maximal standards of exposure, RF field intensity and distance of base stations antennas from human habitations, and so forth. Overall, public information remains a challenge as various health consequences are evoked in the literature and by the media, putting populations under chronic exposure to potentially worrying information.

===Precautionary measures and health advisories===
In May 2011, the World Health Organization&#x27;s International Agency for Research on Cancer classified electromagnetic fields from mobile phones and other sources as &quot;possibly carcinogenic to humans&quot; and advised the public to adopt safety measures to reduce exposure, like use of hands-free devices or texting.

Some national radiation advisory authorities, including those of Austria, France, Germany, and Sweden, have recommended measures to minimize exposure to their citizens. Examples of the recommendations are:

* Use hands-free to decrease the radiation to the head.
* Keep the mobile phone away from the body.
* Do not use telephone in a car without an external antenna.

The use of &quot;hands-free&quot; was not recommended by the British Consumers&#x27; Association in a statement in November 2000, as they believed that exposure was increased. However, measurements for the (then) UK Department of Trade and Industry and others for the French showed substantial reductions. In 2005, Professor Lawrie Challis and others said clipping a ferrite bead onto hands-free kits stops the radio waves travelling up the wire and into the head.

Several nations have advised moderate use of mobile phones for children. An article by Gandhi et al. in 2006 states that children receive higher levels of Specific Absorption Rate (SAR). When 5- and 10-year-olds are compared to adults, they receive about 153% higher SAR levels. Also, with the permittivity of the brain decreasing as one gets older and the higher relative volume of the exposed growing brain in children, radiation penetrates far beyond the mid-brain.

====5G====
The FDA is quoted as saying that it &quot;...continues to believe that the current safety limits for cellphone radiofrequency energy exposure remain acceptable for protecting the public health.&quot;

During the COVID-19 pandemic, misinformation circulated claiming that 5G networks contribute to the spread of COVID-19.

===Bogus products===
Products have been advertised that claim to shield people from EM radiation from mobile phones; in the US the Federal Trade Commission published a warning that &quot;Scam artists follow the headlines to promote products that play off the newsand prey on concerned people.&quot;

According to the FTC, &quot;there is no scientific proof that so-called shields significantly reduce exposure from electromagnetic emissions. Products that block only the earpieceor another small portion of the phoneare totally ineffective because the entire phone emits electromagnetic waves.&quot; Such shields &quot;may interfere with the phone&#x27;s signal, cause it to draw even more power to communicate with the base station, and possibly emit more radiation.&quot; The FTC has enforced false advertising claims against companies that sell such products.

<doc id="1272759" wikidata="Q729149" url="?curid=1272759" title="Blackfoot (band)">
<text>Blackfoot is an American Southern rock band from Jacksonville, Florida, formed in 1970. Though they primarily play with a Southern rock style, they are also known as a hard rock act. The band&#x27;s classic lineup consisted of guitarist and vocalist Rickey Medlocke, guitarist Charlie Hargrett, bassist Greg T. Walker and drummer Jakson Spires.

They had a number of successful albums during the 1970s and early 1980s, including &quot;Strikes&quot; (1979), &quot;Tomcattin&#x27;&quot; (1980) and &quot;Marauder&quot; (1981).

== History ==
=== Early years ===
During the spring of 1969, Rickey Medlocke and Greg T. Walker met New York City natives Ron Sciabarasi and Charlie Hargrett in Jacksonville and organized the band &quot;Fresh Garbage&quot; (named after the like titled song from California psychedelic rock act Spirit), featuring Medlocke on drums and vocals, Walker on bass, Hargrett on guitar and Sciabarasi on keyboards. They played most of their shows at The Comic Book Club on Forsyth Street.

That autumn, Fresh Garbage dissolved following the departure of Sciabarasi, who was drafted and sent to Vietnam. However, Medlocke, Walker and Hargrett regrouped and formed the band &quot;Hammer&quot;, with Medlocke switching to vocalist/guitarist and with new recruits Jakson Spires (drums; born on April 12, 1951, died on March 16, 2005), DeWitt Gibbs (keyboards) and Jerry Zambito (guitars, who only stayed briefly) joining the band. Gibbs, Zambito and Spires had previously played together in Tangerine, while Spires and Walker had been in a high school group called the Rocking Aces. They soon relocated to Gainesville, Florida to be the house band of Dub&#x27;s Steer Room, a well-known topless bar on the outskirts of town.

At the beginning of 1970, the band relocated to Manhattan after a friend, Nancy O&#x27;Connor who was working in a music publishing company, told her boss about the band and he had them move to New York City.

During the early spring of the same year, the band, after learning of another band on the West Coast named Hammer, decided to change their name to Blackfoot to represent the American Indian heritage of its members: Jakson Spires (from Oklahoma) had a Cheyenne/French father and a Cherokee mother; Rickey Medlocke&#x27;s father was Lakota Sioux and Blackfoot Indian, and his mother&#x27;s side is Creek/Cherokee, Scottish and Irish; Greg &quot;Two Wolf&quot; Walker is part Eastern (Muskogee) Creek, a tribe recognized by the state of Florida, but not federally. Charlie Hargrett was the only white man of the original, classic line-up.

When the band failed to acquire a contract as a result of their relocation, Gibbs quit the band and Medlocke began playing rhythm guitar full-time.

During the spring of 1971, Medlocke and Walker accepted an offer to join Lynyrd Skynyrd and Blackfoot ended for a time. Still in New Jersey, Charlie Hargrett played briefly in &quot;No Name&quot; a band formed around him. They rehearsed at Steve Bondy&#x27;s Family Home nearby in Morristown and included New Jersey locals Steve Bondy on guitar, Bert Carey on bass and Andy Peebles on drums. &quot;No Name&quot; played covers as well as original songs briefly in Budd Lake &amp; Stanhope, New Jersey. 

There was a brief attempt to regroup as Blackfoot during 1972, but Medlocke bowed out again and Walker and Gibbs got together with others in a new band named Rainbow to do some demos in Atlanta. But when this didn&#x27;t lead anywhere, Rainbow splintered and Walker relocated to New York to join the band Cross Country for a short period. Hargrett remained in the north, living in Hackettstown, New Jersey.

During August 1972, Blackfoot&#x27;s old friend and roadie, John Vassiliou, visited Hargrett with Reidsville, North Carolina bassist Leonard Stadler from the band Blackberry Hill. Hargrett decided to relocate to North Carolina and invited Medlocke, who had left Lynyrd Skynyrd by this time, to reform Blackfoot with Stadler on bass guitar and Spires returning as drummer. Danny Johnson (later with the bands Derringer and Steppenwolf), from a Louisiana group, Axis, was employed as second guitarist. But Medlocke soon decided to be both main vocalist and guitarist again, and so Johnson&#x27;s tenure with the band was brief.

During the summer of 1973, Stadler quit the band after a tumor was discovered on one of his lungs. It later dissolved, but Stadler decided to leave secular music to join a gospel group. He eventually became a Methodist minister. Greg T. Walker was invited to rejoin at this juncture.

By 1974, the band had returned their base of operations to the Northeast (Northern New Jersey) and Medlocke developed nodes on his vocal cords and temporarily lost his voice. Another singer, Patrick Jude, was brought into the band. But after a brief time, Medlocke was able to sing again and Jude was dismissed. Soon afterward, Medlocke and Walker sent producers/session players Jimmy Johnson and David Hood a copy of Blackfoot&#x27;s material. Johnson and Hood had worked with Medlocke and Walker in Muscle Shoals, Alabama when they were there recording with Lynyrd Skynyrd.

&quot;No Reservations&quot; was released by the company Island Records in September 1975 as part of a deal organized by Blackfoot&#x27;s then manager Lou Manganiello, and their second record album, &quot;Flyin&#x27; High&quot;, was released by Epic Records company in December 1976. Both record albums were produced by Johnson and Hood.

=== Mid-1970s ===
By late 1975, the group was living back in Gainesville, Florida. During 1977, they communicated with Black Oak Arkansas&#x27; manager, Butch Stone, who hired them as the backing group for one of his clients, Ruby Starr, who had been a backup singer for Black Oak but was now becoming self-employed. After the stint with Ruby ended during 1978, they met Brownsville Station manager Al Nalli and his partner Jay Frey, who got them a contract with Atco Records.

&quot;Blackfoot Strikes&quot;, produced by Al Nalli and engineered by Brownsville Station drummer Henry Weck, was recorded in Nalli&#x27;s basement studio in Ann Arbor, Michigan and was completed by January 1979. It was destined to be the band&#x27;s most commercially successful effort. The song &quot;Train, Train&quot;, written by Rickey&#x27;s grandfather, &quot;Shorty&quot; Medlocke, became their first success and best known song. &quot;Highway Song&quot; proved to be another success for them later that year.

The group toured frequently during 1979; at the end of that year, on December 7th, they opened for the band The Who at the Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan, while developing their next album, &quot;Tomcattin&quot;, which was released in June 1980. They went on to release the album &quot;Marauder&quot; in July 1981 and &quot;Highway Song Live&quot; (taken from a show the band played in Zurich, Switzerland on 3/26/82) in June 1982.

=== 1980s ===
During the early 1980s, the &quot;Southern rock&quot; genre was considered passe by the pop music press, so the band began attempting to change their style somewhat. They decided to add keyboards to the group once again. Organist Ken Hensley (ex-Uriah Heep) was contacted and agreed to join during 1982 in time for their next record album, &quot;Siogo&quot; (May 1983). But the poor sales for &quot;Siogo&quot; had the band thinking they might have to &quot;modernize&quot; for the new MTV generation. It was also thought that perhaps Hargrett with his &quot;biker type&quot; appearance might not be appropriate for television. Hargrett angrily and reluctantly decided to end his employment with the band during January 1984, having not played on their next album, &quot;Vertical Smiles&quot;, which had been recorded in Atlanta in late 1983 with former Yes band&#x27;s engineer Eddy Offord. This album was rejected by Atco. But the revamped version, which was finally released in October 1984, also failed to sell well.

Ken Hensley, no longer accustomed to Blackfoot&#x27;s intense tour schedule, quit by late 1984 and was replaced by former Axe band&#x27;s singer/guitarist Bobby Barth. But by December 1985, with their popularity waning and good-quality engagements becoming few, the band decided to quit. During February 1986 the Blackfoot company was dissolved. Medlocke decided to continue with a new team that included Doug &quot;Bingo&quot; Bare (keyboards, synthetics, backup vocals, ex-Whiteface), Jerry &quot;Wizzard&quot; Seay (bass, backing vocals, from Mother&#x27;s Finest) and Harold Seay (drums, percussion). For their album &quot;Rick Medlocke and Blackfoot&quot; (April 1987, their final album for Atlantic Records), the new group was attempting a more radio-style 1980s rock music sound. Jeff Stevens played bass guitar for one track.

During 1988, Wizzard and Seay quit and Gunner Ross (drums, percussion, ex-Ted Nugent), bassist Mark Mendoza (formerly of The Dictators) and Neal Casal (guitar) were employed. Mendoza quit by the end of the year and Rikki Mayr (ex-Lizzy Borden band) began playing bass for the band during early 1989.

=== 1990s ===
During 1990, a new album, &quot;Medicine Man&quot;, was released by the independent Loop company.

By 1992, Medlocke had revamped the team yet again and hired three other players: guitarist Mark Woerpel (former front man for the band Warp Drive out of Milwaukee, who had also done some studio work for Medlocke for earlier albums), Benny Rappa (drums, percussion, a former Whiteface player) and Tim Stunson on bass guitar. Another new album, &quot;After the Reign&quot;, was released during 1994 by the company Wildcat and, like &quot;Medicine Man&quot;, had something of the band&#x27;s old style. Also during 1994, the Rhino Records collection &quot;Rattlesnake Rock N&#x27; Roll: The Best of Blackfoot&quot; was released.

By 1996, Blackfoot was: Medlocke, drummer Stet Howland, John Housley (from Ragady Ann) for lead and rhythm guitar and Bryce Barnes (from Edwin Dare) for bass guitar. That same year, Medlocke rejoined Lynyrd Skynyrd, this time as a guitarist. But he continued to tour with Blackfoot honoring all dates booked through 1997, then disbanded the group to concentrate on Lynyrd Skynyrd.

&quot;Live On The King Biscuit Flower Hour&quot;, a 1983 concert recording, was released during early 1998, and EMI released &quot;Live&quot; during 2000, also culled from the band&#x27;s heyday.

=== 2004–2011 ===

During 2004 a second resurrection of Blackfoot occurred with original members Jakson Spires, Greg T. Walker and Charlie Hargrett. Medlocke was not available, so the lead vocals role was given to Bobby Barth (band member of Axe). Spires died suddenly on March 16, 2005, at age 53, of an aneurysm, but the band decided to persevere. In compliance with the will of Spires, Austrian drummer Christoph Ullmann was hired as the new drummer.

During 2006, the band toured and was joined by Skinny Molly&#x27;s Jay Johnson (the son of Jimmy Johnson, their original co-producer) for guitar and vocals after Barth was sidelined for a shoulder and neck operation. Barth resumed performing later that year, as Johnson stayed on for a short time. During November 2006, Ullman left to return to Austria and was succeeded by Mark McConnell. In April 2007 Blackfoot dismissed Johnson and McConnell. That year the band toured and consisted of bassist Walker, Hargrett, Barth and drummer Michael Sollars. Later that year a live DVD was released. In 2009 Scott Craig was employed as drummer to succeed Sollars.

During the spring of 2010, Barth was forced to undergo emergency back surgery. Former Lynyrd Skynyrd guitarist Mike Estes and current vocalist/guitarist for Skinny Molly was then employed for lead vocals/guitar and Kurt Pietro (drummer of Skinny Molly) replaced Scott Craig on drums. In the summer of 2011 Charlie Hargrett was replaced by Randy Peak.

=== 2012–2015 ===
In 2012 Rickey Medlocke reformed Blackfoot with a completely new line-up (see Members below), with him acting as their producer.

Walker, Hargrett, Estes and Pietro subsequently regrouped under the band name Fired Guns. Then in 2015, Walker, Hargrett, Barth and Ullman began performing together again under the band name Warrior&#x27;s Pride. Medlocke continued to perform with Lynyrd Skynyrd and Walker eventually formed a new band called Two Wolf by the end of the decade.

=== 2016 ===
On August 5, 2016, Blackfoot released their first album in 20 years, &quot;Southern Native&quot;. The video for the song and samples were released on August 2, 2016, via regular channels and social media.

Since the new lineup&#x27;s first appearance in 2012, there have been constant shuffles in personnel. And since 2023, Medlocke has been making it a point to appear at more of the band&#x27;s concerts, alongside former 90s member Mark Woerpel.

<text>Thornbury is a small village and civil parish in the local government district of Torridge, Devon, England. The parish, which lies about north-east of the town of Holsworthy, comprises the five hamlets of Thornbury, Woodacott, Brendon, Lashbrook and South Wonford. These five hamlets are spread over an area of some , with a distance of from Brendon to Thornbury Church. Hence, the community is quite widespread, with the only focal point being the Green at Woodacott Cross. The parish is surrounded clockwise from the north by the parishes of Milton Damerel, Bradford, Cookbury and Holsworthy Hamlets. In 2011, its population was 290, in 120 households, little changed from the 291 residents it had in 1901.

The parish church, dedicated to St Peter, is in the hamlet of Thornbury and has a fine Norman south doorway dated to around 1150. Although most of the rest of the fabric dates to the early 14th century, it was partly hidden by a heavy restoration in 1876 during which the tower was also increased in height by five feet. In the churchyard there is an arch which used to lead to the village pound where stray animals were kept. In 2014 a group of volunteers photographed and transcribed all of the gravestones and inscriptions in and around both the Church and Chapel. The results are available here.

There is a Methodist Chapel at Woodacott, which was originally built in 1833, with the current building dating from 1891. It is now closed for worship.

The nearest primary school is in Bradford.

The village has its own website at www.thornburyhamlets.com and copies of the parish magazine, the &quot;Thornbury Tatler&quot; can be downloaded from the website.

<text>Ivan Earnest Allen Jr. (March 15, 1911 – July 2, 2003) was an American businessman who served two terms as the 52nd mayor of Atlanta, during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.

Allen took the helm of the Ivan Allen Company, his father&#x27;s office supply business, in 1946 and within three years had the company bringing in annual revenues of several millions of dollars. In 1961, he authored a white paper for revitalizing Atlanta. It was adopted by the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce and became the Six Point Forward Atlanta program. This plan would become his roadmap as mayor for creating an economic surge that established the infrastructure, business, education, arts, sports, and international presence that are the foundations for modern Atlanta. Allen was a founding member of Atlanta&#x27;s influential Commerce Club, which he chaired until his death in 2003. He became president of the city Chamber of Commerce in 1961 and during this same year ran for mayor, defeating the staunch segregationist, Lester Maddox.

Convinced that the South could never thrive economically under segregation, Allen supported the demands of African Americans for their accommodation at public facilities. On his first day in office, he ordered the removal of all &quot;white&quot; and &quot;colored&quot; signs from facilities in city hall. Racial alliances forged by Allen with Martin Luther King Jr. and others in the African American community, along with his advocacy for the public accommodation of African Americans in the white community, allowed Allen to guide Atlanta through the turbulence of racial integration without the violence that occurred in many southern cities. In a key address to the public, he asked Atlantans to eliminate racial segregation and in doing so, to set an example to inspire &quot;all the world&quot;. At the behest of President John F. Kennedy, Allen testified before Congress on behalf of what became the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He was the only white southern politician of significance to do so. After his testimony, Allen and his family were under death threats and required police protection for a year.

==Early life==

Ivan Earnest Allen Jr. was born in Atlanta on March 15, 1911, the only son of Ivan Allen Sr. (1876–1968) and Irene Beaumont Allen (1889–1972). His father Allen Sr. was co-founder of the Ivan Allen Company (1900), an office supply and furniture store that, by 1925, had about fifty employees and was one of Atlanta&#x27;s best-known businesses. Allen Sr. was also a founding member of the Atlanta Rotary Club, served as president of the new Atlanta Convention Bureau (1913–1917), president of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce (1917), two years as senator in the Georgia state legislature (1918–1919), and was the treasurer of the Georgia Democratic Party in 1936. In an effort to attract northern capital to Atlanta, Allen Sr. headed the Atlanta chamber&#x27;s &quot;Forward Atlanta&quot; booster campaign (1926–1929), a strategy that would lure almost 700 new businesses to Atlanta and serve to influence Allen Jr.&#x27;s future as a businessman and civic leader.

From an early age, Allen understood that his family was one of privilege. He began attending Boys High School in 1927, and was one of the few students to own a car. That same year, his father&#x27;s name was published for the first time in the Social Cities Register, an annual list of elites in Richmond, Atlanta, Charleston, Savannah, and Augusta. He regularly attended the First Presbyterian Church of Atlanta with his parents, and would later serve as an elder for many years and an active member until his death.

==Education==

Initially an indifferent student, Allen asserted himself during his last year at Boys High, earning a spot on the honor roll. In 1929, he enrolled in the School of Commerce at the Georgia Institute of Technology. During his first year at Georgia Tech, he was one of only five students in the student body of about two thousand to make straight A&#x27;s. He graduated cum laude in 1933, with a Bachelor of Science in Commerce. While at Georgia Tech, he served as president of the student body, vice president of the Inter-Fraternity Council, cadet colonel of the ROTC, president of Omicron Delta Kappa, vice-president of ANAK, president of the Georgia Phi chapter of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, was a member of the Honor Roll, and a member of the Dean&#x27;s List.

At one point, he led a student protest against Governor Eugene Talmadge when the board of regents abolished the School of Commerce at Tech and moved it to the University of Georgia. During one summer as a college student he served as postmaster, strung tennis rackets, and worked as a counselor for young campers at Camp Greenbriar in Alderson, West Virginia. He was paid $500 and invested this money in Coca-Cola stock, of which he wrote was &quot;my first investment and probably the greatest I ever made&quot;.

==Business career==

After graduating from Georgia Tech in 1933 during the depths of the Great Depression, Allen refused offers from other companies and began his lifetime of work in the family business, which was at the time called the Ivan Allen–Marshall Company. That summer, he worked in the basement of the business, learning from a black employee named Arthur Wright and earning $100 per month. At the time, the business consisted of one Atlanta store and grossed $196,000.

In 1936, he married Louise Richardson, granddaughter of Hugh T. Inman, and member of one of the most prominent families in Atlanta. He continued working at the company until he was called to the army to serve in World War II from 1942 to 1945.

After the War, he worked in the Georgia State Capitol statehouse from the fall of 1945 until the spring of 1946. In March 1946, Allen Sr. asked his son to return to the family business, in light of the fact that his partner, Charles Marshall, was in poor health and had decided to retire. Allen resigned from his position as executive secretary to the governor and became president his father&#x27;s company in 1946. In 1948, Marshall died and willed his half of the Ivan Allen–Marshall Company to Allen Jr., giving the Allen family ownership of the firm. By 1949, the firm had more than two hundred employees and annual revenues of several million dollars. Together with his father, he changed the name to the Ivan Allen Company in 1953. The company would flourish over the next four decades under his leadership and that of his late son, Ivan Allen III, becoming the region&#x27;s preeminent office supplies and furniture dealer, with 17 offices across the South.

Ivan Allen Jr. was president of Ivan Allen Company from 1946 to 1970 and chairman from 1970 to 1995. In 1988, the Ivan Allen Company boasted $116 million in revenues. In 1999, the supplies division of the Ivan Allen Company was sold to Staples, Inc. The furniture division, now known as Ivan Allen Workspace, is headed by his son, Iman Allen.

==Political and civic involvement==

In 1936, Allen actively campaigned for Georgia Governor Eurith D. Rivers, serving in a number of state-government positions during the Rivers administration between 1936 and 1940. As treasurer of the State Hospital Authority, he raised $2.5 million by passing the state&#x27;s first revenue certificate bond issue to rebuild the white section of the old state mental hospital at Milledgeville.

When Pearl Harbor was struck in late 1941, he was called into the army as a reserve officer. During World War II, he served as a supply officer and directed the field division of the Selective Service System in Georgia for the United States Army. He entered the service in 1942 as a second lieutenant and was discharged in 1945 as a major.

When the War ended, an old college friend who was also the progressive young Governor of Georgia, Ellis Arnall, went to Washington and asked the Secretary of Defense to release Allen from his duties. Allen was discharged and immediately became executive secretary to Governor Arnall until March 1946. He was later chief of staff for Governor M.E. Thompson (1947–1948).

While working at Ivan Allen–Marshall Company, he began to participate in civic affairs, such as the Boy Scouts and the Community Chest. He served as a member of the state Board of Education and the state Department of Veteran Services. He was a director of the Bank of Georgia, a trustee at the Georgia Tech Research Institute, an executive board member of the state&#x27;s Family Welfare Society and of the Atlanta YMCA, president of the Young Democrats Club of Georgia, and president of the Atlanta Improvement Association (1951).

For almost ten years, he led the state Chamber of Commerce in industrial development projects. With friends Mills B. Lane, Jack Glenn, Philip Alston, Richard Rich, Lawrence Gellerstedt Jr., and others, he founded The Commerce Club, which served as a venue for business networking and hospitality. He served as chairman until his death.

Allen was an active member of the Atlanta Rotary Club from 1939 until his death. He served as president of the Community Chest and United Way, president of the Atlanta Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America, and president of the Georgia Chamber of Commerce. In 1947, he was selected to head the Community Chest fund drive, during which time he became the first white member of the Community Chest leadership to attend the opening fundraising dinner for the black division of the Community Chest. In 1958, he served as a member on the Atlanta Citizens Advisory Committee on Urban Renewal. He was elected president of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce in 1960 and, in 1961, proposed the Six Point Forward Atlanta program, which became the cornerstone of his platform in his successful campaign for mayor in 1961.

==Bids for governor==

In 1954, Ivan Allen Jr. made a brief bid for Georgia Governor on a segregationist platform. In a field of nine candidates, he lost to segregationist Marvin Griffin.

In 1957, Allen resigned from his position as president of the Georgia State Chamber of Commerce, hired a press agent, and delivered speeches across Georgia as a potential candidate for the 1958 Gubernatorial Election. Again, he ran on a segregationist platform, but emphasized the &quot;peace and tranquility necessary to continue our economic development program&quot;. In the coming years he would drastically change his political philosophy on segregation.

In December 1957, he announced that he would not be a candidate for governor. He alluded to the fact that no Atlantan in forty years had won the race for governor, mostly as a result of rural Georgian apprehension towards the leaders from the &quot;large, liberal cities&quot;. Allen wrote, &quot;As a businessman I have analyzed the market and found that I am not a saleable product...No matter how clear and unequivocal I made my support of segregation, I was still from Atlanta&quot;.

==Mayoralty==

In 1961, he ran for Mayor of Atlanta against Lester Maddox, a 45-year-old restaurant owner and staunch segregationist. Allen was carried to victory by 63,522 votes, while Maddox received 35,922 votes. Allen gained much of his support from the black community, which made up 40 percent of the city&#x27;s population at the time. He took office in early 1962, replacing outgoing Atlanta Mayor William B. Hartsfield, who was retiring after 23 years in office.

In June 1962, during his first term as mayor, Allen took the solemn responsibility of flying to France to help identify and bring home the bodies of 106 of Atlanta&#x27;s art and business leaders who, on an art appreciation tour, died in the Air France Flight 007 plane crash at Orly Airport in Paris. Many of the deceased had been personal friends of Allen.

In his book, Allen wrote about going to Paris immediately after the crash:

&quot;I realized how insignificant I was, but I knew I had to assume the posture of representing these families and, indeed, the entire city of Atlanta, Georgia. I knew nothing about protocol, foreign relations, aviation, international agreements, or any of the other details I might become involved in. I was nothing but the Mayor of Atlanta and a friend and neighbor of 106 people who had been killed at this same airport only the day before...These were my lifelong friends. This was my generation. This was also the backbone of Atlanta&#x27;s cultural society, the city&#x27;s leading patrons of the arts. There was no precedent for this kind of agony&quot;.

In 1965, Allen made a very private commitment to himself and to his wife Louise that he would not seek a third term in office. This was not revealed to the public until January 1969, when Allen formally announced his decision at a meeting of the Atlanta Rotary Club. That year, he refused to publicly endorse any particular candidate in the mayoral race, until just days before the runoff between Sam Massell and Rodney Cook, when reports surfaced suggesting that Allen&#x27;s vice-mayor and mayoral-elect, Massell, had abused his power as vice-mayor through misuse of the Atlanta Police Department. On the Sunday before the election, Allen called for a press conference and asked Massell to immediately withdraw from consideration &quot;for an office which requires intuitive integrity and instinctive withdrawal from even the suspicion and appearance of evil.&quot; Despite the backlash he received, Allen wrote, &quot;Had my candidate, Rodney Cook been involved in the same affair I am convinced I would have taken the same action – except... I would have gone into greater detail to make the public fully understand the seriousness of the situation&quot;. Sam Massell went on to win the election and succeed Allen as the 53rd mayor of Atlanta.

===Economic development of Atlanta===

Under Mayor Allen&#x27;s Forward Atlanta program, the city&#x27;s population grew more than 30 percent. Atlanta ranked in the top ten in the nation in downtown construction, with more than 55 new buildings constructed and 22,000 new jobs created each year. In 1969, Atlanta&#x27;s unemployment rate at one point plummeted to an astonishing 1.9 percent. Eleven of the city&#x27;s twelve tallest buildings were constructed during the sixties, and the Atlanta International Airport (now Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport), acquired its first direct international air routes and saw its ranking change from the tenth-busiest airport in the nation to the third-busiest. In an attempt to manage the city&#x27;s vast increase in traffic, Allen oversaw the early phases of construction of the Interstate 285 perimeter and the Downtown Connector, and presided over the creation of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA), which would take over the old Atlanta Transit system and build the MARTA rail system.

The $13 million Memorial Arts Center (now the Woodruff Arts Center) was established as a memorial to the victims of the 1962 Orly plane crash. The $10 Million Atlanta Civic Center and the $100 million Peachtree Center complex were all built during Allen&#x27;s mayoralty. Between 1965 and 1969, convention business in Atlanta doubled, with 400,000 delegates spending $60 million.

Mayor Allen also played a key role in bringing Major League Sports to Atlanta. In a politically risky move, he backed the construction of the $18 million Atlanta-Fulton Stadium, which attracted the Milwaukee Braves baseball team in 1965, the new NFL franchised Falcons football team in 1966, and the St. Louis Hawks basketball team arrived in 1968 Local Black leaders criticized him for demolishing a Black neighborhood to build it.

His building program, with its emphasis on developing downtown, was opposed by some of Atlanta&#x27;s black leaders as not adequately meeting the need for low-income housing. Despite the criticisms, however, there was more low-income housing built during Allen&#x27;s eight years as mayor than the entire thirty years prior to that. Allen wrote, &quot;It is wonderful to be idealistic and to speak about human values, but you are not going to be able to do one thing about them if you are not economically strong. If there is any one slogan I lived by as mayor of Atlanta, that would be it&quot;.

===Civil rights and desegregation===

As mentioned earlier, Allen had initially been a segregationist. However, his business pragmatism led him to become an advocate for African American rights. He believed that to flourish, Atlanta must address its racial issues. Eventually, however, Allen was deeply affected by daily, firsthand dealings he faced with racial issues, as well as the profound questions African American citizens posed to him about their humanity and the cultural system that refused to recognize them. His pragmatic support of racial integration transformed rapidly into a conviction about the moral rightness of racial equality – a belief would lead Allen to place himself at the center of a firestorm. 

Even before becoming mayor, Allen was involved in efforts to bring desegregation to Atlanta for the sake of Atlanta&#x27;s businesses and city image. As president of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, he worked closely with Judge A.T. Walden, longtime African-American leader; Opie Shelton, vice-president of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce; and 25 owners and managers of Atlanta&#x27;s leading department, variety, and chain stores to come to an agreement of the full desegregation of downtown stores and lunch counters.

On his first day in office, he ordered all &quot;white&quot; and &quot;colored&quot; signs removed from City Hall and desegregated the cafeteria. This was the first of many steps he took to advance integration. Allen authorized black Atlanta policemen to arrest whites, hired the city&#x27;s first black firefighters, and quickly put Atlanta ahead of every other city in the South as far as hiring black workers for positions &quot;other than the most menial jobs&quot;. He painstakingly negotiated agreements for the accommodation of African Americans at 18 private and public facilities including hotels, swimming pools, and restaurants. Many Atlanta restaurants and other public facilities desegregated by mutual agreement between their owners and Mayor Allen before the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. By January 1964, 14 major Atlanta hotels and motels had publicly pledged to accept reservations regardless of race.&quot;I wasn&#x27;t so all-fired liberal when I first moved into City Hall&quot;, Allen wrote. &quot;But when I saw what the race-baiters were doing or could do to hold back the orderly growth of Atlanta, it infuriated me and eventually swung me to the extreme end opposite them&quot;.

Despite his claims to have been committed to integration one of his first actions was to erect a fence to separate a black neighborhood from a white neighborhood. In the face of criticism Mayor Allen refused to take it down until a court order forced him to. The event was known as &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s Berlin Wall&quot; or &quot;the Peyton Road Affair.&quot;

In 1966, a riot broke out in Summerhill, a neighborhood south of the Atlanta Stadium, when a white police officer shot a black resident. Mayor Allen rushed to the scene of the riot, climbing a police car in an attempt to talk to and calm the crowd. He toppled from the car, uninjured, when the crowd repeatedly rocked the vehicle. Afterwards, he walked the streets – refusing to wear a riot helmet as the police did – urging the black residents to &quot;please go home.&quot; &quot;This is a good city&quot;, he shouted. &quot;Help keep it that way, and go home&quot;. In his 1973 autobiography, &quot;The River of No Return&quot;, Cleveland Sellers a leader in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee claimed that Allen then instructed police to, &quot;get them out of here, if you have to tear it down brick by brick,&quot; referring to their homes.

===Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.===

Mayor Allen challenged members of Atlanta&#x27;s prestigious Commerce Club to accept African American businessmen. When Martin Luther King Jr. won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, Allen helped organize a 1,500-person bi-racial banquet to honor him (Atlanta was King&#x27;s hometown). Furthermore, he shamed many of the white leaders in the city into supporting the event beyond pragmatic grounds. Many attended the dinner, making it a turning point in Atlanta&#x27;s race relations.

Upon hearing that Martin Luther King Jr. had been shot in Memphis, Mayor Allen immediately rushed to the support of Dr. King&#x27;s wife. Allen and his wife were with Mrs. King when it was confirmed that Dr. King was dead. Two days after Dr. King&#x27;s assassination on April 4, 1968, he participated in a march across the west side of Atlanta, leading the way in a police car for the nearly four thousand black students walking in memory of Dr. King. Along with Atlanta&#x27;s police chief, Herbert Jenkins, he visited every black neighborhood in Atlanta during the traumatic days between Dr. King&#x27;s death and his funeral, walking up and down the streets and reassuring the black community. Mayor Allen went to great lengths to ensure the city remained peaceful when nearly two hundred thousand people gathered to mourn Dr. King&#x27;s death. King&#x27;s widow, Coretta Scott King, honored Allen with the Martin Luther King Jr. Nonviolent Peace Prize in 1981.

===Testimony before Congress===

&quot;I was convinced now that voluntary desegregation of public facilities, worked out on a local level, had gone as far as it was going to go in the South and much of the rest of the United States...&quot;, Allen wrote. &quot;It was obvious that the President was going to have to push through a very plain and airtight law that would, once and for all, abolish the practice of segregation. And segregation, as I intended to say in my testimony, was &#x27;the stepchild of slavery&#x27;&quot;.

In 1963, President John F. Kennedy made a direct request asking Ivan Allen Jr. to testify before the U.S. Congress in support of a federal law mandating public accommodations for African Americans. This law, particularly directed at those [restaurants and hotels] in the South that continued to close their doors to blacks by arguing private property rights, would force any private business, however remotely involved in interstate commerce, to open its doors to every person regardless of race. Against the counsel of even Atlanta&#x27;s most prominent black leaders, Allen chose to go to Washington and deliver his testimony, knowing it would most likely ruin his political career and deeply affect his personal and business relationships. Nevertheless, with the support of his wife and very few others, Allen risked his place in society, his political future, the safety of his family, and ultimately his life to advocate the public accommodation of African Americans.

On July 26, 1963, Allen spoke before the U.S. Congress and the nation in support of what became the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He was the only prominent white southern elected official to do so. As a result, there were death threats made towards the Allen family, and many white friends and constituents never spoke to him again. Just one month after Allen&#x27;s testimony, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, also calling for racial equality and an end to discrimination, later proving to be a very defining moment in the Civil Rights Movement.

Excerpts from Allen&#x27;s testimony were published in newspapers the day after he spoke in front of Congress: &quot;I am firmly convinced that the Supreme Court insists the same fundamental rights must be held by every American citizen. Therefore, any failure by Congress to pass the [Civil Rights] bill would amount to an endorsement of private business setting up an entirely new status of discrimination throughout the nation... I submit that it is not right to allow an American&#x27;s citizenship to be changed merely as a matter of convenience... I want to emphasize again that now is the time for legislative action. We cannot dodge this issue. We cannot look back over our shoulders or turn the clock back to the eighteen-sixties. We must take action now to assure a greater future for our citizens and our country... Now the elimination of segregation, which is slavery&#x27;s stepchild, is a challenge to all of us to make every American free in fact as well as in theory...&quot;

Allen described that to be the moment which made civil rights a very personal matter to him: &quot;I have to be honest with myself and admit that up until the time I had to make the decision to go to Washington or not go, my liberalism on the race issue had been based to a large degree on the pragmatism: it was simply good business for Atlanta to be an open city, a fair city, a &quot;City Too Busy to Hate&quot;, a city trying to raise the level of its poorest citizens and get them off the relief roles...I am certain that at this point I had finally crossed over and made my commitment on a very personal basis. And I think I took some of my friends with me&quot;.

Allen continued to engage racial issues throughout his eight years in office. He worked closely with Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. By the time he stepped down, Atlanta was at the forefront of progress in public accommodations, school desegregation, voting rights, housing, and employment. Black citizens occupied positions on the city board of aldermen and the board of education.

==Family==

Ivan Allen Jr. married Louise Richardson Allen (1917–2008), granddaughter of the influential Atlanta businessman, Hugh T. Inman, on New Year&#x27;s Day in 1936. They were married for sixty-six years before Allen&#x27;s death. They had three sons, Ivan Allen III (1938–1992), Hugh Inman, and Beaumont (1951–2014). At the time of Allen Jr.&#x27;s death, he was survived by his wife, sons Hugh Inman and Beaumont, daughters-in-law Margaret (Mrs. Ivan Allen III), Tricia (Mrs. Hugh Inman Allen) and Sally (Mrs. Beaumont Allen), seven grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.

==Georgia Institute of Technology==

Ivan Allen Jr. graduated in the top five students of his class at Georgia Tech (Commerce, 1933). He was president of the Student Body and the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, to which he offered lifelong support. For many years, he hosted the annual Ivan Allen Rush Party for his fraternity in the meadow behind his home. In 1990, the liberal arts college at Georgia Tech was renamed the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts.

==The Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage==

Entrusted by the Allen family to carry forward Mayor Allen&#x27;s legacy, Georgia Tech&#x27;s Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts awarded the Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Progress and Service from 2001 to 2010. In 2010, Georgia Tech established the Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage. Awarded for the first time in 2011, it recognizes those around the world whose life and work embody Mayor Allen&#x27;s moral imperative and compassion in shaping a better future for humankind.

==Legacy==

After Allen&#x27;s death on July 2, 2003, at the age of 92, he was buried at Westview Cemetery in Atlanta. His remains were reinterred at Oakland Cemetery alongside other family members in 2009.

Ivan Allen Jr. was awarded a Doctor of Public Service degree from Georgia Tech and honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from Morris Brown College, Juniata College, Clark College, Morehouse College, LaGrange College, Emory University, and Davidson College.

He was also awarded the Lyndon Baines Johnson Foundation Award for achievement in urban affairs in 1974, the Martin Luther King Jr. Nonviolent Peace Prize in 1981, the Shining Light Award in 1995, and was inducted into the International Civil Rights Walk of Fame at the Martin Luther King Jr. Historic Site in Atlanta, Georgia in 2004 (cite). In 1999, The Commerce Club created the Ivan Allen Jr. Leadership Award, which is presented annually.

A memorial statue of Ivan Allen Sr., Ivan Allen Jr., and Ivan Allen III was commissioned for the Olympic Games and stands in Centennial Olympic Park, adjacent to the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce headquarters. The Atlanta Braves&#x27; museum and hall of fame at the now-demolished Turner Field was named in his honor.

His commitment to urban transformation founded in social justice became a cornerstone of the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts at Georgia Tech. G. P. &quot;Bud&quot; Peterson, president of Georgia Tech, stated, &quot;He was a leader while he was a student here at Georgia Tech, and went on to be a leader in everything he did throughout his career. Now, half a century later, his life is a beacon of light for those of us following in his footsteps. It is our goal here at Georgia Tech to take the legacy of Ivan Allen Jr. and pass it on to the next generation.&quot; Research, teaching, and public service in the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts are grounded in Mayor Allen&#x27;s values and principles.

==Books==

In 1971, Ivan Allen Jr. published his first and only book, &quot;Mayor: Notes on the Sixties&quot;, with Paul Hemphill. The inside cover of the book reads, &quot;To my father, who saw it coming; and to my wife, whose advice and courage saw me through it.&quot;

The members of the Ivan Allen family, along with former mayor Maynard Jackson (Dobbs Family), are the subjects of the book, &quot;Where Peachtree Meets Sweet Auburn&quot;, published in 1996 by Gary M. Pomerantz.

In 1928, Ivan Allen Sr. published his first and only book, &quot;Atlanta From the Ashes&quot;. In the Foreword, Allen Sr. writes, &quot;It is the author&#x27;s intention in this volume to present his city to the executives of American business.&quot; A 1929 New York Times article referred to the book: &quot;Picture of Rise After Sherman&#x27;s March Is Told In a New Descriptive Book.&quot;

<text>Kim Hyun-joo (; born April 24, 1977) is a South Korean actress. She is best known for her leading roles in the television dramas &quot;Glass Slippers&quot; (2002), &quot;Toji, the Land&quot; (2004), &quot;Twinkle Twinkle&quot; (2011), &quot;What Happens to My Family?&quot; (2014), &quot;I Have a Lover&quot; (2015), &quot;Watcher&quot; (2019), and &quot;Hellbound&quot; (2021–present).

==Career==
===1996–2001: Early acting credits===
Kim Hyun-joo began modeling in teen magazines when she was in her third year of high school. In 1996, she made her entertainment debut when she starred in the music video for Kim Hyun-chul&#x27;s &quot;One&#x27;s Lifetime.&quot; Kim launched her acting career in 1997 in the television drama &quot;The Reason I Live&quot; (1997). Despite being inexperienced, she was cast in the leading role in the film &quot;If It Snows on Christmas&quot; (1998) with Park Yong-ha, followed by &quot;Calla&quot; (1999) with Song Seung-heon.

After doing a few sitcoms, Kim built her resume further by playing supporting roles on television. In 1999, She gained her first major role when she appeared in the Jang Dong-gun show &quot;Springtime&quot; (also known as &quot;Youth&quot;), which received low ratings. But the popular &quot;Into the Sunlight&quot; later that year boosted Kim&#x27;s career. In early 2000, she appeared in episode 7 of Song Ji-na&#x27;s omnibus drama &quot;Love Story&quot;, titled &quot;Insomnia, Manual and Orange Juice.&quot; Kim then landed her first TV leading role in &quot;Virtue&quot; (&quot;Deok-yi&quot;), followed by more supporting roles in 2001 with &quot;Her House&quot; (headlined by Kim Nam-joo) and the historical drama &quot;Sangdo&quot; (based on Choi In-ho&#x27;s novel about Joseon merchant Im Sang-ok).

===2002–2005: Glass Slippers breakthrough===
Kim achieved mainstream stardom in 2002, with her &quot;Cinderella&quot;-esque leading role in &quot;Glass Slippers&quot;, about two sisters who were separated as children and unknowingly encounter each other as adults. Also starring Kim Ji-ho, Han Jae-suk and So Ji-sub, the drama was a hit with ratings of over 30%, and Kim received acting and popularity awards at the SBS Drama Awards. &quot;Glass Slippers&quot; was also successful in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Vietnam and with Kim&#x27;s new pan-Asian popularity, she starred opposite Taiwanese actor/singer Vanness Wu in the martial arts movie &quot;Star Runner&quot; (2003).

For &quot;Ms. Kim&#x27;s Million Dollar Quest&quot; (also known as &quot;Miss Kim&#x27;s One Billion Won Project&quot; and &quot;Miss Kim&#x27;s Adventures in Making a Million&quot;), she and Ji Jin-hee displayed their comedic chops as a girl left at the altar and a bankrupt playboy, respectively, who join forces in a moneymaking scheme. Kim&#x27;s next role was as Lee Sung-jae&#x27;s love interest in the body swapping comedy film &quot;Shinsukki Blues&quot;.

From late 2004 to 2005, Kim played the heroine Choi Seo-hee in &quot;Toji, the Land&quot; , a television adaptation of Park Kyung-ni&#x27;s celebrated novel &quot;Toji&quot; (&quot;The Land&quot;), which portrayed the lives and loves of peasants and the nobility (&quot;yangban&quot;) in Korea at the turn of the 20th century, spanning from Japan&#x27;s colonial rule to the division of the peninsula. The big-budget production was a hit, and Kim received a Best TV Actress nomination at the 2006 Baeksang Arts Awards.

Inspired by the American TV show &quot;Joe Millionaire&quot;, &quot;Marrying a Millionaire&quot; (2005) was about an average guy (Go Soo) pretending to be rich as the concept for a dating reality show, who then genuinely falls for one of the contestants (Kim), the only girl who knows the truth. After &quot;Marrying a Millionaire&quot;, Kim went on a two-year hiatus. She later said she took a break because she hated being typecast in such sweet, wholesome roles. But as time passed, she said she regretted the decision and should&#x27;ve worked harder instead to develop as an actress.

===2007–2010: Resurgence===
Kim returned to television in 2007 with &quot;In-soon Is Pretty&quot;, playing the titular character who went to prison for unintentionally killing someone in high school, and after serving her sentence, must face prejudice as an ex-con while rebuilding her life. Despite the drama&#x27;s low ratings, Kim was praised for her acting and received a Top Excellence Award at the KBS Drama Awards.

In 2009, she was cast in a small supporting role (or extended cameo) as the hero&#x27;s tough-but-stylish older sister in the highly popular &quot;Boys Over Flowers&quot;, adapted from the Japanese manga &quot;Hana Yori Dango&quot;. Then in the legal drama &quot;Partner&quot;, Kim played a widow-turned-lawyer whose passionate idealism clashes with her colleague&#x27;s (Lee Dong-wook) detached cynicism.

Kim then spent ten days in Vancouver, Whistler, and Victoria to film the documentary &quot;ECO Canada by Kim Hyun-joo&quot;, which aired on MBC Life. Also featured as a photo spread in &quot;Sure&quot; magazine, the shoot promoted environmental awareness by emphasizing Canada&#x27;s natural backdrops, and showing Kim&#x27;s green practices such as using canvas instead of plastic bags and unplugging unused electrical appliances.

Her book &quot;Hyun-joo&#x27;s Handcrafted Story&quot; was published on December 20, 2009, featuring personal essays and photos about her needlework and knitting.

2010 was a difficult year for Kim, with the deaths of three of her loved ones in close succession: her friend, actor Park Yong-ha committed suicide on June 30, the production company executive who&#x27;d cast her in &quot;The Land&quot; committed suicide on July 1 because of financial difficulties, and her father Kim Tae-beom died on July 7 after a long illness. She spent the rest of the year volunteering in Bangladesh and the Philippines as the goodwill ambassador for Good Neighbors, a humanitarian NGO. She donated the condolence money collected for her father&#x27;s funeral and a portion of her book sales to Good Neighbors, which was used to build libraries in 11 orphanages in impoverished areas of Dhaka. Kim said, &quot;I literally fled to Bangladesh after a series of personal tragedies, but I was consoled by the smiles of children who are living in these dire conditions. The act of sharing has given me strength to live.&quot; She continues to as an instructor for several classes organized by Good Neighbors, teaching Korean elementary schoolchildren about poverty around the world.

===2011–2015: Focusing on weekend dramas===
Kim resumed her acting activities in 2011, playing the daughter from a wealthy publishing company whose life is turned upside down when she learns that she was switched at birth with another baby in &quot;Twinkle Twinkle&quot;. Her performance garnered a Top Excellence Award at the MBC Drama Awards. She also starred in Kim Dae-seung&#x27;s short film &quot;Q&amp;A&quot;, which was included in &quot;If You Were Me 5&quot;, an omnibus film commissioned by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea. Then in &quot;Dummy Mommy&quot; (2012), she played a fashion magazine editor with a genius-level IQ who is embarrassed by her developmentally disabled mother (Ha Hee-ra).

In a departure from her typical parts, Kim played one of the legendary femme fatales of the Joseon Dynasty, Lady Jo (or Jo &quot;Gwi-in&quot;), in the period drama &quot;Blooded Palace: The War of Flowers&quot; (2013). She said she was &quot;more than delighted to have been given the opportunity to try something new,&quot; adding that, &quot;This role will be a new life story for my acting career. I personally think it will be more interesting for an actress with an innocent image like myself to take up this wicked role.&quot; Critics praised Kim&#x27;s versatility, as Lady Jo transforms from a naive young girl into an ambitious royal concubine who uses her beauty and wiles on King Injo in her lust for power.

In early 2014, Kim began hosting &quot;Musical Journey to Yesterday&quot;, a music program in which a mix of current idol singers and industry veterans perform live hit songs from the 1970s to 1990s. Later that year, she starred in the weekend drama &quot;What Happens to My Family?&quot;, which had over 40% ratings. Her performance garnered the Top Excellence award at the KBS Drama Awards.

In 2015, she played dual roles in the melodrama, &quot;I Have a Lover&quot;. She won the Top Excellence Top Excellence Award from the APAN Star Awards and SBS Drama Awards.

===2016–present: Professional expansion===
Kim starred in the drama series &quot;Fantastic&quot;, portraying a screenwriter grappling with a terminal illness.

In 2018, she took on the role of Sun Hye-jin in the fantasy melodrama &quot;Miracle That We Met&quot;, playing a wife who feels trapped in a loveless marriage. Kim described her character as a dormant volcano waiting to erupt, adding depth and complexity to the show&#x27;s storyline.&quot;

In 2019, Kim starred in OCN&#x27;s drama &quot;Watcher&quot;, portraying a criminal lawyer who had once been a highly promising prosecutor. Her performance garnered rave reviews, with critics praising her for creating a wholly unique and independent character, unlike any that they had seen before.

In 2020, Kim starred in &quot;Undercover&quot;, a JTBC&#x27;s remake of the British BBC drama of the same name. The drama marked her third reunion with &quot;Ji Jin-hee&quot;, her co-star from the 2015 drama, &quot;I Have a Lover&quot;. Kim explained her reason for accepting the offer to join the drama, &quot;Last time, for I Have a Lover, Ji helped me a lot on set. The reason viewers liked my character was that Ji made me shine in the series. So this time, I wanted to return that favor. Ji accepted the role first, and I knew that many people would want to see us reunite on screen, so it didn&#x27;t take me long to decide to join the series.&quot;.

That same year, Kim was confirmed to join the cast of &quot;Hellbound&quot;, a Netflix series directed by &quot;Yeon Sang-ho&quot;. She portrayed the character of Min Hye-jin, an attorney who courageously stands up against religious extremists.

In October 2022, Netflix confirmed that Kim would play one of the lead roles in their upcoming thriller drama, &quot;The Bequeathed&quot;. In December 2022, Kim starred in SBS&#x27;s drama &quot;Trolley&quot; as the wife of a National Assembly member.

In 2023, Kim starred in the Netflix sci-fi film &quot;Jung-E&quot; directed by &quot;Hellbound&quot; director &quot;Yeon Sang-ho&quot;, in the title role of a legendary mercenary who is also the subject of brain-clone testing.

<text>Thornbury is an area of Bradford, in West Yorkshire, England on the border with the City of Leeds.
Thornbury is located in the Bradford Moor ward and the Bradford East parliamentary constituency.
Thornbury is contiguous with Pudsey – part of the City of Leeds conurbation and borders Laisterdyke, and Fagley in Eccleshill ward.

== History ==

Thornbury was originally a distinct village, in 1894 Thornbury became a civil parish, being formed from the part of the parish of Calverley with Farsley in the County Borough of Bradford, on 25 March 1898 the parish was abolished and merged with Bradford.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, Thornbury was the seat of various enterprises such as Crofts Engineering
and John Sharp &amp; Co textile manufacturing machine engineers
and the Phoenix Dynamo Manufacturing Company.
On Leeds Road there were some large former tramsheds and former bus depot
dating from when Bradford had its own tram, trolleybus and bus services.
Bradford Corporation Trams had their own works in Thornbury where over 150 tram cars were built.

Buffalo Bill staged a performance of his Wild West Show in Thornbury when touring England in 1903.
The Kozey Picture Hall on Leeds Old Road was converted from a boxing stadium and gymnasium starting operation as a cinema in 1912.
The cinema closed in 1920 principally due to competition from the larger Lyceum Cinema that opened in 1919 in nearby Laisterdyke, and became a weaving shed.
== Economy ==

On Gain Lane are British Bakeries&#x27; Hovis bakeries, and the headquarters of Wm Morrison Supermarkets.

<doc id="1272800" wikidata="Q816658" url="?curid=1272800" title="Bencao Gangmu">
<text>The Bencao gangmu, known in English as the Compendium of Materia Medica or Great Pharmacopoeia, is an encyclopedic gathering of medicine, natural history, and Chinese herbology compiled and edited by Li Shizhen and published in the late 16th century, during the Ming dynasty. Its first draft was completed in 1578 and printed in Nanjing in 1596. The &quot;Compendium&quot; lists the &quot;materia medica&quot; of traditional Chinese medicine known at the time, including plants, animals, and minerals that were believed to have medicinal properties. 

Li compiled his entries not only from hundreds of earlier works in the &quot;bencao&quot; medical tradition, but from literary and historical texts. He reasoned that a poem might have better value than a medical work and that a tale of the strange could illustrate a drug&#x27;s effects. The Ming dynasty emperors did not pay too much attention to his work, and it was ignored.

Li&#x27;s work contained errors and mistakes due to his limited scientific knowledge at the time. For example, Li claimed that all otters were male and that quicksilver (mercury) was not toxic. 

==Name==
The title, translated as &quot;&quot;Materia Medica&quot;, Arranged according to Drug Descriptions and Technical Aspects&quot;, uses two Chinese compound words. &quot;Bencao&quot; (&quot;Pen-ts&#x27;ao&quot;; &quot;roots and herbs; based on herbs, pharmacopeia, &quot;materia medica&quot;&quot;) combines &quot;ben&quot; ( &#x27;origin, basis&#x27;) and &quot;cao&quot; ( &#x27;grass, plant, herb&#x27;). &quot;Gangmu&quot; (&quot;Kang-mu&quot;; &#x27;detailed outline; table of contents&#x27;) combines &quot;gang&quot; (&quot;kang&quot;; &#x27;main rope, hawser; main threads, essential principles&#x27;) and &quot;mu&quot; ( &#x27;eye, look; category, division&#x27;).

The characters and were later used as &#x27;class&#x27; and &#x27;order&#x27;, respectively, in biological classification.

==History==
Li Shizhen travelled widely for field study, combed through more than 800 works of literature, and compiled material from the copious historical &quot;bencao&quot; literature. He modelled his work on a Song dynasty compilation, especially its use of non-medical texts. He worked for more than three decades, with the help of his son, Li Jianyuan, who drew the illustrations. He finished a draft of the text in 1578, the printer began to carve the blocks in 1593, but it was not published until 1596, three years after Li died. Li Jianyuan presented a copy to the Ming dynasty emperor, who saw it but did not pay much attention. Further editions were then published in 1603, 1606, 1640, and then in many editions, with increasing numbers of illustrations, down to the 21st century.

==Contents==
 The text consists of 1,892 entries, each entry with its own name called a &quot;gang&quot;. The &quot;mu&quot; in the title refers to the synonyms of each name.

The &quot;Compendium&quot; has 53 volumes in total:

#The opening table of contents lists entries, including 1,160 hand drawn diagrams and illustrations.
#Volume 1 to 4 – an index () and a comprehensive list of herbs to treat the most common sicknesses ().
#Volume 5 to 53 – the main text, contains 1,892 distinct herbs, of which 374 were added by Li Shizhen. There are 11,096 side prescriptions to treat common illness (8,160 of which are compiled in the text).

The text is written in almost 2 million Chinese characters, classified into 16 divisions and 60 orders. For every herb there are entries on their names, a detailed description of their appearance and odor, nature, medical function, side effects, recipes, etc.

== Errors ==
The text contains information that was proven to be wrong due to Li&#x27;s limited scientific and technical knowledge. For example, it is claimed that quicksilver (mercury) and lead were not toxic. Li also claimed that otters are always male and that the Moupin langur is tall, has backwards feet and can be caught when it draws its upper lip over its eyes.

== Evaluation ==
The British historian Joseph Needham writes about the Compendium in his &quot;Science and Civilisation in China&quot;.

The text provided classification of how traditional medicine was compiled and formatted, as well as biology classification of both plants and animals.

The text corrected some mistakes in the knowledge of herbs and diseases at the time. Several new herbs and more details from experiments were also included. It also has notes and records on general medical data and medical history.

The text includes information on pharmaceutics, biology, chemistry, geography, mineralogy, geology, history, and even mining and astronomy.

<text>The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel is a daily morning broadsheet printed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where it is the primary newspaper and also the largest newspaper in the state of Wisconsin, where it is widely read. It was purchased by the Gannett Company in 2016.

In early 2003, the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; began printing at a new facility in West Milwaukee. In September 2006, the &quot;Journal Sentinel&quot; announced it had &quot;signed a five-year agreement to print the national edition of &quot;USA Today&quot; for distribution in the northern and western suburbs of Chicago and the eastern half of Wisconsin&quot;.

==History==
===&quot;Milwaukee Sentinel&quot;===
The &quot;Milwaukee Sentinel&quot; was founded on June 27, 1837, in response to disparaging statements made about the east side of town by Byron Kilbourn&#x27;s westside partisan newspaper, the &quot;Milwaukee Advertiser&quot;, during the city&#x27;s &quot;bridge wars&quot;, a period when the two sides of town fought for dominance. A co-founder of Milwaukee, Solomon Juneau, provided the starting funds for editor John O&#x27;Rourke, a former office assistant at the &quot;Advertiser&quot;, to start the paper.

On Juneau&#x27;s request, O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s associate, Harrison Reed, remained to take over the &quot;Sentinel&quot;″s operations on behalf of Democratic Party politician James Duane Doty. Reed continued the struggle to keep the paper ahead of its debts, often printing pleas to his advertisers and subscribers to pay their bills any way they could. Meanwhile, the establishment of the Whig party in the territory thrust the &quot;Sentinel&quot; into partisan politics. In 1840 Reed was assaulted by individuals whom the &quot;Sentinel&quot; charged were hired by Democratic Governor Henry Dodge. When Doty backed William Henry Harrison, the &quot;Sentinel&quot; endorsed Harrison for president in the 1840 election.

Starr guarded the &quot;Sentinel&quot; position as the sole Whig organ in Milwaukee. Heavily in debt, he secured the partnership of David M. Keeler, who paid off the paper&#x27;s creditors. Keeler took on partner John S. Fillmore (nephew of U.S. president Millard Fillmore) and succeeded in ousting Starr, who kept publishing his own version of the &quot;Sentinel&quot;. Keeler and Fillmore trumped his efforts by turning their &quot;Sentinel&quot; into a daily on December 9, 1844, while still publishing a weekly edition. The paper finally began to prosper and establish itself as a major political force in the nascent state of Wisconsin. Having accomplished his goal of establishing the first daily paper in the territory, Keeler retired two months later, but not before opening a public reading room of the nation&#x27;s newspapers, the origin of Milwaukee&#x27;s public library system. Fillmore employed a succession of editors, including Jason Downer, later a Wisconsin Supreme Court justice, and Increase A. Lapham, a Midwestern naturalist who later helped establish the National Weather Service.

After running through six editors in eight years, Fillmore sought a more stable editorial foundation and went east to confer with Thurlow Weed, editor of the &quot;Albany Evening Journal&quot; and powerful Whig political boss of New York. Weed recommended his associate editor and protégé, Rufus King. King was a native of New York City, a graduate of West Point, a brevet lieutenant, the son of the president of Columbia College and the grandson of U.S. Constitution signer Rufus King. In June 1845 King came to Milwaukee and became the &quot;Sentinel&quot;″s editor three months later.

The paper provided thorough coverage of Wisconsin&#x27;s constitutional convention, held in Madison in 1846. When the adopted constitution fell short of Whig expectations, the &quot;Sentinel&quot; was instrumental in encouraging its rejection by territorial voters on April 6, 1847. The &quot;Sentinel&quot; launched a German-language paper, &quot;Der Volksfreund&quot;, to bring the city&#x27;s large population of German immigrants to the Whig cause. Gen. King himself was a delegate to Wisconsin&#x27;s second constitutional convention. He was also appointed head of the Milwaukee militia and sat on the University of Wisconsin&#x27;s board of regents, as well as being the first superintendent of Milwaukee public schools. In the wake of the Panic of 1857 King sold the paper to T.D. Jermain and H.H. Brightman, but remained editor, covering the state legislative sessions of 1859–1861 himself.

In 1848, the &quot;Sentinel&quot; praised the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, a treaty that ended the Mexican–American War, commenting: &quot;Peace upon almost any terms will be joyfully welcomed by the American People. They have long since tired of the war.&quot;

The &quot;Sentinel&quot; prospered during the Civil War, sometimes printing five editions of the paper in a day. Though much of the war news was copied from Chicago papers, the &quot;Sentinel&quot; did dispatch a war correspondent for over half a year. The war also resulted in a shortage of skilled printers, so in 1863 the &quot;Sentinel&quot; began hiring and training &quot;female compositors&quot; to typeset the paper, albeit in another building away from the men. This resulted in members of the Milwaukee Typographical Union leaving their jobs, but the war had already depleted their ranks to such a degree that the union later temporarily disbanded. Frustrated by the lack of skilled help, editor C. Latham Sholes tried building a typesetting machine, but failed. After becoming comptroller for the city a few years later, he invented the modern typewriter. After the war ended circulation fell off and the number of editions was kept to a minimum.

A supporter of the Liberal Republicans, who opposed President Ulysses S. Grant, Thomson was ousted from the paper after Carpenter&#x27;s former law partner Newton S. Murphey bought the &quot;Sentinel&quot; in 1874 with other pro-Grant Republicans, including Carpenter, who had failed to be re-elected. After Murphey loaned Carpenter $20,000 to also become a stakeholder in the paper, Carpenter hired A. C. Botkin as editor, formerly of the &quot;Chicago Times&quot;, to replace Thomson. The &quot;Sentinel&quot; was soon perceived as Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;personal mouthpiece&quot; and an organ of the state Republican central committee. After committee chairman Elisha W. Keyes blocked Carpenter from becoming a delegate to the national Republican convention in 1876, the paper began running fierce editorials denouncing Keyes. The &quot;Sentinel&quot; later endorsed Carpenter over Keyes as senator in the 1878 election.

Disappointed in the paper&#x27;s weak defense of unregulated corporations, a new group of stalwart Republicans purchased the old Democratic &quot;Milwaukee News&quot; in 1880 and resurrected it as the &quot;Republican and News&quot;. Horace Rublee, a former editor of the &quot;Wisconsin State Journal&quot; and who had been the chairman of the state Republican party, was hired as editor-in-chief. Failing to put the &quot;Sentinel&quot; out of business, the Republicans bought the paper outright and issued it as the &quot;Republican-Sentinel&quot;. The next year the word Republican was dropped, but the paper remained a major force in the state&#x27;s Republican party. This troubled managing editor Lucius W. Nieman, who had covered the state capitol for the &quot;Sentinel&quot; and had seen the control the powerful monied interests had over state government. When a Democrat was elected to Congress from a die-hard Republican county, the &quot;Sentinel&quot;″s editor refused to print the fact. This led Nieman to resign and join the fledgling &quot;Milwaukee Journal&quot;. The &quot;Journal&quot; first received acclaim when Nieman&#x27;s coverage of a deadly hotel fire revealed it to be a firetrap, but the &quot;Sentinel&quot; defended the hotel&#x27;s management, which included a &quot;Sentinel&quot; stockholder.

Historian Frederick Jackson Turner was the &quot;Sentinel&quot; Madison correspondent for a year, beginning in April 1884, while he finished his senior year at the University of Wisconsin. He covered various aspects of life in Madison, from campus news to the state legislature. He delivered the scoop that university regent and state political boss Elisha W. Keyes wished to remove university president John Bascom for political reasons and it was Turner&#x27;s reports that resulted in a backlash of support for the president. Bascom had earlier offered Turner a position teaching elocution at the university that he turned down in favor of working for the &quot;Sentinel&quot; for nine more months. He left the paper after Republicans appointed him as the transcribing clerk to Wisconsin&#x27;s state senate before later going on to teach history.

In 1892–1893 the &quot;Sentinel&quot; moved temporarily from its home on Mason Street so that the old building could be torn down and a new, state-of-the-art structure could be erected in its place.

With the dawning of the Progressive Era during the 1890s the &quot;Sentinel&quot; began to moderate its views, often echoing calls for political reform. After the Panic of 1893 a private utility monopoly run by stalwart Republican party bosses Charles F. Pfister and Henry C. Payne, The Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Company (TMER&amp;L), revoked commuter passes and raised utility rates during the depression. The &quot;Sentinel&quot; joined in the chorus of indignation that resounded from Milwaukee and beyond, particularly during 1899 when Pfister and Payne succeeded, by means of bribery, to push through a 35-year contract with the city. On December 29 Pfister and Payne sued the &quot;Sentinel&quot; for libel, to which the paper replied that it had fallen prey to &quot;probably the most formidable and influential combination of selfish interests ever found in the city of Milwaukee.&quot;

Rather than going to trial and having his business practices revealed, Pfister bought the &quot;Sentinel&quot; outright on February 18, 1901, paying an immense sum to buy up a majority of its stock. After the death of his publisher, Lansing Warren, that summer Pfister assumed publishing duties, immersing himself in the paper&#x27;s operations and directing political coverage. Owning the &quot;Sentinel&quot; expanded his conservative influence from the convention backrooms to the pages of the largest daily paper in Wisconsin. The &quot;Sentinel&quot; immediately opposed the newly elected Governor La Follette. During La Follete&#x27;s successful re-election campaign in 1902, Pfister&#x27;s political power was diminished after it had been revealed that he had secretly purchased the editorial pages of some 300 of the state&#x27;s newspapers.

A majority stake was purchased by the Hearst Corporation in 1924. Operations of the &quot;Sentinel&quot; were joined to Hearst&#x27;s papers, the afternoon &quot;Wisconsin News&quot; and the morning &quot;Milwaukee Telegram&quot;; the latter being merged with the &quot;Sentinel&quot; as the &quot;Milwaukee Sentinel &amp; Telegram&quot;. The &quot;Wisconsin News&quot; entered into a lease arrangement with the School of Engineering for radio station WSOE on November 15, 1927. The lease was for a minimum of three years. To reflect the new arrangement, the &quot;Wisconsin News&quot; changed the call letters of WSOE to WISN on January 23, 1928. The station was sold to the &quot;Wisconsin News&quot; in November 1930. Hearst&#x27;s associate Paul Block acquired Pfister&#x27;s remaining stake of the &quot;Sentinel&quot; in 1929. The &quot;News&quot; closed in 1939, being consolidated with the &quot;Sentinel&quot; as a single morning paper. In 1955 Hearst purchased television station WTVW and changed the call letters to WISN-TV.

===&quot;The Milwaukee Journal&quot;===
&quot;The Milwaukee Journal&quot; began as &quot;The Daily Journal&quot; in 1882. Edna Ferber, later a famed writer and Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist, was a &quot;Milwaukee Journal&quot; reporter for nearly four years, from approximately 1903 to 1907.

The &quot;Journal&quot; followed the &quot;Sentinel&quot; into broadcasting. The &quot;Journal&quot; purchased radio station WKAF in 1927, changing its call letters to WTMJ. It launched an experimental FM station, W9XAO, in 1940, which was licensed as a commercial station in 1941, originally as W55M, and later becoming WMFM and WTMJ-FM. This station was shut down in 1950. In 1959 a new WTMJ-FM was licensed, which later became WKTI-FM, WLWK-FM, and WKTI. WTMJ-TV, Wisconsin&#x27;s first television station, went on the air in 1947.

===21st century===

As of mid-2012, the &quot;Journal Sentinel&quot; had the 31st-largest circulation among all major U.S. newspapers, with circulation of 207,000 for the daily edition and just under 338,000 for the Sunday edition.

On April 8, 2016, decades of local ownership for both papers ended when Journal Media Group was acquired by the Gannett Company for $280 million. Gannett owns most of the daily newspapers in the central and eastern parts of Wisconsin (eleven in all), including the &quot;Green Bay Press-Gazette&quot; and Appleton&#x27;s &quot;The Post-Crescent&quot;. The &quot;Journal Sentinel&quot; has been integrated into the company&#x27;s &quot;&quot;USA Today&quot; Network Wisconsin&quot;. The &quot;Journal Sentinel&quot; also collaborates with the &quot;Press-Gazette&quot; for Packers coverage, and adapted to Gannett standards, including newspaper layout, website and apps, in August 2016.

In the spring of 2018, the &quot;Journal Sentinel&quot; press facility began to print all of Gannett&#x27;s state papers (it already printed &quot;The Sheboygan Press&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot;) replacing the company&#x27;s Appleton facility. By 2021, it was reported that about 90% of &quot;Journal Sentinel&quot; subscriptions were for its print edition despite a years-long push to increase the number of digital subscribers.

In April 2024, the newspaper launched a redesigned Sunday edition. 

==Awards==
&quot;The Milwaukee Journal&quot; and the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; have received Pulitzer Prizes:

In 1934, cartoonist Ross A. Lewis won for his cartoon on labor-industry violence, &quot;Sure, I&#x27;ll Work for Both Sides&quot;.

In 1966, the series &quot;Pollution: The Spreading Menace&quot; garnered the award for public service.

In 1977, Margo Huston became the first female staff member of &quot;The Milwaukee Journal&quot; to win a Pulitzer Prize. She won the award in the category of best general reporting for a series of articles on the elderly and the process of aging.

In 2008, local government reporter David Umhoefer was awarded the 2008 Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting for his investigation of the Milwaukee County pension system.

In 2010, reporter Raquel Rutledge was awarded the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for local reporting for her investigations and stories on abuses in a state-run child care system.

In 2011, Mark Johnson, Kathleen Gallagher, Gary Porter, Lou Saldivar, and Alison Sherwood were awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting for their &quot;lucid examination of an epic effort to use genetic technology to save a 4-year-old boy imperiled by a mysterious disease, told with words, graphics, videos and other images.&quot;

===Other awards===
In 1965 the paper&#x27;s women&#x27;s section won the Penney-Missouri Award for General Excellence.

==Archives==
In 2008, Google published the newspaper&#x27;s archives as part of an initiative to digitize historical newspapers. Though the initiative ended in 2011, the archives remain accessible. The Milwaukee digitization used microfilm that had been scanned for ProQuest&#x27;s database. At the &quot;Journal Sentinel&quot; request, the Milwaukee Public Library loaned decades of missing microfilm volumes to complete the digitization. When Google&#x27;s project ended, the newspaper began the process of creating its own archive via its relationship with Newsbank.

Newsbank unsuccessfully attempted to sell &quot;Journal Sentinel&quot; digital archive access to the Milwaukee Public Library, which could not afford their asking price. The Library already subscribed to Newsbank&#x27;s obituary and recent &quot;Journal Sentinel&quot; articles, as well as other proprietary databases with annual subscriptions costing less than $100,000. In May 2014, Newsbank suggested several purchase options, one of which was $1.5 million, which would have consumed nearly all of the library&#x27;s $1.7 million materials budget. The newspaper changed ownership to Gannett in April and by August had requested that Google remove free public access to the archives, leaving a gap in coverage. Google Newspapers access was restored in December 2017, but digital access continued to be sporadic over the next several years.

<text>Forio (known also as &quot;Forio of Ischia&quot;) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; of c. 17,000 inhabitants in the Metropolitan City of Naples, southern Italy, situated on the island of Ischia.

==Overview==
Its territory includes the town of Panza, the only &quot;frazione&quot; of Forio and of the island of Ischia. Panza has always been an independent village since the 16th century when a first governmental organization was introduced on the island. In the 1975 the inhabitants of Panza tried to become an independent &quot;comune&quot; but the referendum, claimed by the inhabitants of Forio, was denied by the Campania&#x27;s Regional Government.

There are numerous coastal watchtowers, built from the Middle Ages against Saracen and African pirates raids.

In the 20th century, Ischia inspired at least two well-known English language poets. Ischia was the site where W.H. Auden composed one of his most famous poems, In Praise of Limestone. And the American Poet, Theodore Roethke, dedicated his poem The Storm, to &quot;Forio d&#x27;Ischia&quot; as printed in Selected Poems of Theodore Rothke (Library of America, Edwin Hirsch, Ed., 2005, p.113).

<doc id="1272820" wikidata="Q3571432" url="?curid=1272820" title="Yamaha QY10">
<text>The Yamaha QY10 is a hand-held music workstation produced by the Yamaha Corporation in the early 1990s. Possessing a MIDI sequencer, a tone generator and a tiny single-octave keyboard, the portable and battery-powered QY10 enables a musician to compose music while traveling.

== History ==

Released by Yamaha in 1990, the QY10 was the first device offering the facilities of a music workstation in a portable package. In response to its design, the music technology press coined the term &quot;walkstation&quot;, a portmanteau of the words &quot;Walkman&quot; and &quot;workstation&quot;. The QY10 sold well, indicating that there was a market for these devices, so Yamaha followed it up in 1992 with the more powerful QY20 and QY22. Subsequently, both Yamaha (most Yamaha QY sequencers) and Roland (the Roland PMA-5) have produced walkstations, although neither officially use the term for their products.
In 1992, Novation took advantage of the QY10&#x27;s success by releasing a companion keyboard, the Novation MM10. The top of the keyboard has a slot which securely accommodates a QY10, and short cables connect the two units together. With two octaves of full size velocity-sensitive keys, the MM10 overcomes a significant limitation of the QY10: its lack of a proper keyboard. Combined, they constitute a complete, if basic, music workstation.

During the 1990s, electronic musical equipment became more dependent on large and sophisticated graphical displays. However, the QY10&#x27;s display is a small LCD panel which accommodates only 16 characters of text. This made it feasible for the Kentucky LCD Interface Project to modify the QY10 with a speech interface as an assistive technology for the blind.

The QY10 was discontinued in the mid-1990s.

== Sequencer ==

The main feature of the QY10 is its eight track sequencer. With its &quot;pattern&quot;-based design, it was more suited to supporting song writing rather than creating full musical compositions.

A &quot;pattern&quot; is a short sequence of backing music played on bass guitar, percussion and two other instruments. Patterns for various musical styles are built into the QY10, such as European house music, rhythm and blues and bossa nova. Users may also write their own patterns, which must be written in the key of C major. When playing a song, the QY10 automatically rescales patterns to match a selected chord.

The eight tracks of the sequencer are thus divided into two groups: four standard sequencer tracks and four tracks dedicated to pattern playback. The latter are typically programmed as one &quot;backing track&quot; which stores a sequence of pattern numbers and chord changes.

The QY10&#x27;s sequencer data is maintained by an internal back-up battery, but it may also be stored externally by transferring it to a suitable device, such as a MIDI equipped computer.

== Tone Generator ==

The QY10&#x27;s tone generator is a sample-based synthesizer using Yamaha&#x27;s 12-bit Advanced Wave Memory synthesis technology. The tone generator is eight part multi-timbral (i.e., eight instruments may sound at once) and 28 note polyphonic (i.e., 28 notes may sound at once), which provides adequate support for sequences written on the unit. In other respects, however, the tone generator is quite limited. Only 30 instruments and one drum kit with 26 sounds are available. Furthermore, instruments must be either centered or panned completely left or right. These limitations can be understood in the context of the QY10&#x27;s primary role as a composition tool, rather than as a musical instrument.

== Applications ==

Although the primary use of the QY10 is as a portable composing tool, it has other applications.

With its pattern-based sequencing system, it is particularly suited for use as an accompaniment device. However, unlike other sequencers in the QY series, the QY10 cannot auto-harmonize its backing tracks to chords played on an external MIDI keyboard.

Another application is as a general purpose MIDI sequencer, controlling instruments with far superior sounds than those available from its own tone generator. However, for this use, it has several disadvantages, including fixed MIDI channel assignments and limited support for MIDI control information. The pattern-based design of its sequencer might also be considered a disadvantage in this context.

==Legacy==

The QY10&#x27;s legacy is the introduction of the walkstation and the QY sequencer. It has also influenced the physical design of many of Yamaha&#x27;s subsequent devices, for example the MU5 sound module, the RY8 drum machine and the SU10 sampler. The CS1x, CS2x and AN1x have a small lip on the right hand end of the keyboard to accommodate a QY or SU sized module.

<doc id="1272847" wikidata="Q327201" url="?curid=1272847" title="GAZ-69">
<text>The GAZ-69 is a Soviet four-wheel drive off-road vehicle produced by GAZ (ГАЗ, or &quot;Gorkovsky Avtomobilnyi Zavod&quot;, Gorky Automobile Factory) between 1953 and 1956 and then by UAZ between 1956 and 1972, though all of these light truck class vehicles were known as GAZ-69s. It was also produced in Romania until 1975.

==Development and production==
The GAZ-69 was created by the team of chief designer Grigoriy Vasserman as a replacement for the GAZ-67B that would have lower fuel consumption than its predecessor and use the same inline four and three-speed transmission as the GAZ-M20 &quot;Pobeda&quot;. The axles and some other parts were taken from the GAZ-67B. The development process started in 1946 and the first prototypes known under the name &quot;Truzhenik&quot; (Toiler) were built in 1947. After extensive on-road testing, the new off-road vehicle went into production on August 25, 1953. Over 600,000 GAZ-69s had been built by the end of production in the USSR in 1972. A copy of the GAZ-69 with some modifications was produced by ARO in Romania until 1975, first as the IMS-57, then heavily redesigned as the IMS M59, and later modernized as the ARO M461. GAZ-69s were standard military jeeps of the Eastern Bloc and client states, except Romania that mainly used the locally built ARO models.

==Design==
The standard GAZ-69 was able to reach , but more powerful versions, with 2,400 cc (derived from the basic 2,100 cc) 65 h.p. engines and the same three-speed gearbox, could reach . They were known as the GAZ-69M, or GAZ-69AM for the four-door version.

It featured two fuel tanks, one of under the floor, one of beneath the passenger&#x27;s seat. All civilian models also had to meet Army requirements, in case of wartime requisitioning. (This is also why a hardtop version was not available until 1993) The basic variant GAZ-69 has a pair of doors and usually has standard canvas top and upper sides; there are two seats in front and two folding benches for three passengers each on sides. The further variant GAZ-69A (UAZ-69A) has four doors, folding canvas top and two rows of seats.

It was used as the basis for the rear-wheel drive van GAZ-19 that was built in 1955 but did not pass the prototype stage. The off-road van and light truck UAZ-450 and the newer UAZ-469 also traced their origins to the GAZ-69.

==Military use==
The GAZ-69 had been the basic light off-road vehicle of the Soviet Army, replacing GAZ-67s and Willys Jeeps, before the army adopted the UAZ-469. It was also used as the basis for the 2P26 tank destroyer, as well as for the GAZ-46 MAV, a light 4x4 amphibious vehicle inspired by the Ford GPA &#x27;Seep&#x27;.

<text>Kunnathu Puthiyaveettil Ramapurathu Gopalan (1 June 1906 – 5 August 1997), popularly known as KPR was an Indian politician and a communist leader from Kalliasseri, Kerala. Once a member of the Kerala State Assembly, he lost his seat in the general election of 1 February 1960. He was subsequently re-elected. While a member, he led a failed attempt at armed revolt in the Cannanore area. At one point he was sentenced to death by the colonial authorities, before the sentence was commuted by Charu Chandra Biswas, at the urging of A. K. Gopalan.

Gopalan was one of the founding members of the Communist Party in Kerala in 1940. He, in cooperation with the KPCC, was the main organizer of Morozha protest on 15 September 1940. The protest became violent when police tried to suppress it. One Sub-Inspector and a Constable died in the clash with the mob, mainly constituted of farmers, agricultural labourers, and other trade union workers.

The police caught all prominent leaders, including Gopalan and E. Narayanan Nayanar, the elder brother of E. K. Nayanar, former Kerala Chief Minister for 11 years. The court sentenced all of them to imprisonment and later on appeal, Madras High Court sentenced Gopalan to death. He was sent to Bellary Jail. The verdict attracted wide protest across Kerala and India. Kerala observed a day honoring K.P.R. Gopalan and Mathrubhumi, the leading newspaper wrote an editorial demanding that his death sentence be commuted. Gandhiji was also involved and said it is not acceptable. British communist party protested and the case even received the attention of the British Parliament. Due to this mass protest, the British Government finally reduced the punishment from hanging to life imprisonment. Later, he was released when Congress Interim Government took power in Madras state. Eminent Communist leader P. Krishna Pillai wrote an article hailing Gopalan entitled &quot;The Bolshevik Hero of Kerala&quot;. Gopalan died of natural causes on 5 August 1997, aged 91. His niece K. P. Sarada was married to E. K. Nayanar.

<doc id="1272859" wikidata="Q7837468" url="?curid=1272859" title="Tredegar House Country Park">
<text>Tredegar Park () is a country park situated in the Coedkernew area of Newport, Wales. It lies close to junction 28 of the M4 motorway connecting London and West Wales.

== History ==

It formerly formed part of the original 16th century estate of the Morgan family, first substantially redeveloped by William Morgan (of Machen and Tredegar) in the 17th century and owned for generations by the Lords Tredegar. The Grade I building, Tredegar House, and the Grade I listed stables, are also situated within the park.

The park is very large, comprising around and includes a large lake that it is possible to walk around.

The present day community (parish) of Tredegar Park is a much smaller area consisting of the Duffryn estate and immediate surroundings. The park itself falls within the boundaries of Coedkernew.

==Parkrun==

Parkrun (a UK-wide running series) takes place in the grounds of the park each Saturday at 9am. The first event was hosted in 2011. As of May 2024, 586 runs have been held, attracting 20,284 runners. An average of over 300 people compete each week, however some events have attracted up to 700 competitors.

==National Trust==

The National Trust took over management of the Country House and Grounds in 2015. As a condition of their management, the grounds and gardens of the house are to remain free for the public to access, with the House entry at £10.10 for adults as part of the Trust&#x27;s costs to manage their estates.

<doc id="1272873" wikidata="Q686834" url="?curid=1272873" title="Good Feeling (Travis album)">
<text>Good Feeling is the debut studio album by the Scottish rock band Travis. The 
album was released on 8 September 1997, on Independiente Records. All four singles released from the album reached the UK Top 40 (with &quot;Tied To The 90s&quot; making to Top 30).

==Background and release==
Once set up in London, the band spent between nine months and a year recording new songs. The band played their first London show at the Dublin Castle pub in Camden. With around twenty good songs ready, they then approached managers Colin Lester and Ian McAndrew of Wildlife Entertainment, who then introduced the band to Andy MacDonald, owner of Go! Discs Records and founder of Independiente Records. The band was signed to MacDonald personally, not to the label—if MacDonald ever leaves the Sony-financed label Independiente Records, the band goes with him (commonly referred to in the industry as a &quot;golden handcuffs&quot; clause).

The album itself has a much more upbeat and &#x27;rockier&#x27; sound than their subsequent releases and is often regarded as one of their best. In 2000 the album was re-released, with the only differences being new album artwork (featuring a headshot of the band on a black background) and a slightly-tweaked version of &quot;More Than Us&quot;. In April 2021, Craft Recordings re-issued the album on vinyl with the original cover (featuring a full band shot with a mostly white background).

==Production==
Produced by Steve Lillywhite of U2 fame, Travis&#x27; first studio album, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Good Feeling&quot;, is a rockier, more upbeat record than the band&#x27;s others to date. Recorded at the legendary Bearsville Studios in Woodstock, New York, the place where Travis favourite the Band recorded, the album contained singles such as &quot;All I Want to Do Is Rock&quot;, &quot;U16 Girls&quot;, the Beatle&#x27;esque &quot;Tied to the 90&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Happy&quot; and &quot;More Than Us&quot;. Guest musicians include Page McConnell of Phish playing keyboards on the title track &quot;Good Feeling&quot;. The album reached No. 9 on the British charts, but with little radio play, it slipped from the charts relatively quickly, dropping to number 26 and then 53 over the next couple of weeks (though over the next few years it would end up with 27 weeks inside the Top 100, making it the third longest chart run for a Travis album). Although it heralded Travis&#x27; arrival on the British music scene, received extremely positive reviews, and substantially broadened Travis&#x27; fan base, it sold just 40,000 copies. Following the release, Travis toured extensively, their live performances further enhancing their reputation. This included support slots in the UK for Oasis, after Noel Gallagher became an outspoken fan.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The New York Times&quot; concluded that the album &quot;is flawed, sprinkled with a few songs that are worse than bad—they&#x27;re boring and trite... But if future albums live up to the promise of this one&#x27;s best moments, Travis could be Britain&#x27;s next revered rock standard-bearer.&quot;

<doc id="1272885" wikidata="Q826992" url="?curid=1272885" title="DarkSky International">
<text>DarkSky International, formerly the International Dark-Sky Association (IDA), is a United States–based non-profit organization incorporated in 1988 by founders David Crawford, a professional astronomer, and Tim Hunter, a physician and amateur astronomer. The mission of DarkSky is &quot;to preserve and protect the night time environment and our heritage of dark skies through quality outdoor lighting.&quot;

Light pollution is the result of outdoor lighting that is not properly shielded, allowing light shine into the eyes and night sky. Direct light that shines into the eyes is called glare, and light directed into the night sky above the horizon causes skyglow. Lighting can also cause light trespass when it enters areas where unwanted (e.g. a neighbor&#x27;s yard and windows). DarkSky was the first organization in the dark-sky movement, and is currently the largest.

==Principal approach==
DarkSky&#x27;s principal approach is to raise awareness about the value of dark, star-filled night skies and encourage their protection and restoration through education about the problems and solutions, including outdoor lighting practices that create less light pollution. In 2011, the organization had about 5,000 members in 70 countries.

==International Dark Sky Places==

To promote awareness about the issues, DarkSky has an International Dark Sky Places program that aims &quot;to encourage communities, parks and protected areas around the world to preserve and protect dark sites through responsible lighting policies and public education&quot;. There are currently five types of designation for International Dark Sky Places:
* International Dark Sky Sanctuaries

<text>La Sainte Union (LSU) in Southampton was a teacher training college. It was owned and run by the La Sainte Union des Sacrés Coeurs order of nuns, and this Catholic background was reflected in the student makeup.

In addition to teacher training, LSU also provided first degree courses in the Humanities, particularly history (notably American and Soviet), art, English and foreign languages (B.A. Combined Studies, B.A. Modern Foreign Languages &amp; European Studies, Theology). Although the education was provided by independent lecturers and professors the courses were overseen by the University of Southampton and degrees (both ordinary and honours) awarded by the university. Towards the end of its time LSU also started moving into medical training.

In April 1997 the Teacher Training Agency decided to withdraw accreditation for the college&#x27;s teacher training courses, forcing LSU to close. This followed the college&#x27;s failure to pass an important academic validation inspection after which Bishop of Portsmouth Anthony Emery was quoted as saying &quot;The full story cannot be told at the present time&quot;. At that stage the college employed 315 staff and had over 2,000 students. The teacher training and art programmes were immediately taken over by nearby education providers, including the University of Southampton, Chichester Institute of Higher Education (now University of Chichester and King Alfred&#x27;s College, Winchester.

The college campus was immediately taken over by the University of Southampton and became a campus of the university called &quot;New College&quot;, specialising in adult and continuing education, and art programmes. The New College campus was sold by the university in 2006, and the educational activities on the site moved to Southampton University&#x27;s main campuses at Highfield, Winchester and Boldrewood.

The campus is now a housing area with a mix of houses and apartments, built by Linden Homes. Most of the original buildings, and the original houses which were used as Halls of Residence in Archers Road, are gone. The two newer Halls of Residence, Gateley Halls and Romero Halls, which were built in 1994, are still being used by University of Southampton students.

<doc id="1272902" wikidata="Q3400831" url="?curid=1272902" title="Powell and Pressburger">
<text>The British film-making partnership of [[Michael Powell]] (1905–1990) and [[Emeric Pressburger]] (1902–1988)—together often known as The Archers, the name of their production company—made a series of influential films in the 1940s and 1950s. Their collaborations—24 films between 1939 and 1972—were mainly derived from original stories by Pressburger with the script written by both Pressburger and Powell. Powell did most of the directing while Pressburger did most of the work of the producer and also assisted with the editing, especially the way the music was used. Unusually, the pair shared a writer-director-producer credit for most of their films. The best-known of these are &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; (1943), &quot;A Canterbury Tale&quot; (1944), &quot;I Know Where I&#x27;m Going!&quot; (1945), &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; (1946), &quot;Black Narcissus&quot; (1947), &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (1948), and &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot; (1951).

In 1981, Powell and Pressburger were recognised for their contributions to British cinema with the BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award, the most prestigious award given by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.

==History==

===Early films===
Powell was already an experienced director, having worked his way up from making silent films to the First World War drama &quot;The Spy in Black&quot; (1939), his first film for Hungarian émigré producer Alexander Korda. Pressburger, who had come from Hungary in 1935, already worked for Korda, and was asked to do some rewrites for the film. This collaboration was the first of 19, most over the next 18 years.

After Powell had made two further films for Korda, he reunited with Pressburger in 1940 for &quot;Contraband&quot;, the first in a run of Powell and Pressburger films set during the Second World War. The second was &quot;49th Parallel&quot; (1941), which won Pressburger an Academy Award for Best Story. Both are Hitchcock-like thrillers made as anti-Nazi propaganda. For these three films, Powell is the credited director (also producer on &quot;49th Parallel&quot;), while Pressburger is credited with the screenplay:
* &quot;The Spy in Black&quot; (1939)
* &quot;Contraband&quot; (1940)
* &quot;49th Parallel&quot; (1941)

===Birth of The Archers===
The pair adopted a joint writer-producer-director credit for their next film, &quot;One of Our Aircraft Is Missing&quot; (1942) and made reference to &quot;The Archers&quot; in the credits. In 1943 they incorporated their own production company, Archers Film Productions, and adopted a distinctive archery target logo which began each film. The joint credit &quot;Written, Produced and Directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger&quot; indicates their joint responsibility for their own work and that they weren&#x27;t beholden to any studio or other producers.

In a letter to Wendy Hiller in 1942, asking her to appear in &quot;Colonel Blimp&quot;, Pressburger explicitly set out &#x27;The Archers&#x27; Manifesto&#x27;. Its five points express the pair&#x27;s intentions:

# We owe allegiance to nobody except the financial interests which provide our money; and, to them, the sole responsibility of ensuring them a profit, not a loss.
# Every single foot in our films is our own responsibility and nobody else&#x27;s. We refuse to be guided or coerced by any influence but our own judgement.
# When we start work on a new idea, we must be a year ahead, not only of our competitors, but also of the times. A real film, from idea to universal release, takes a year. Or more.
# No artist believes in escapism. And we secretly believe that no audience does. We have proved, at any rate, that they will pay to see the truth, for other reasons than her nakedness.
# At any time, and particularly at the present, the self-respect of all collaborators, from star to propman, is sustained, or diminished, by the theme and purpose of the film they are working on.

They began to form a group of regular cast and crew members who worked with them on many films over the next 12 years. Hardly any of these people were ever under contract to The Archers—they were hired film by film—but Powell and Pressburger soon learnt whom they worked well with and who enjoyed working with them. When Raymond Massey was offered the part of the Prosecuting Attorney in &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; his cabled reply was &quot;For The Archers anytime, this world or the next.&quot;

Powell and Pressburger also co-produced a few films by other directors under The Archers&#x27; banner: &quot;The Silver Fleet&quot; (1943), written and directed by Vernon Sewell and Gordon Wellesley, based on a story by Pressburger, and &quot;The End of the River&quot; (1947), directed by Derek N. Twist, to which both Powell and Pressburger contributed uncredited writing. Both Sewell and Twist had worked with Powell &amp; Pressburger previously on other films and were being given their first chance as directors.

Over the course of the war and afterwards, they released a series of acclaimed films:
* &quot;One of Our Aircraft Is Missing&quot; (1942)
* &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; (1943)
* &quot;The Silver Fleet&quot; (1943) (producers only; written and directed by the team of Vernon Sewell and Gordon Wellesley)
* &quot;The Volunteer&quot; (1944) a short propaganda film
* &quot;A Canterbury Tale&quot; (1944)
* &quot;I Know Where I&#x27;m Going!&quot; (1945)
* &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; (1946)

===The collaboration===
Generally, Pressburger created the original story (for all their films from 1940–1946) and wrote the first draft of the script. They then passed the script back and forth a few times—they could never work on it together in the same room. For the dialogue, Pressburger knew what he wanted the characters to say but Powell would often supply some of the actual words.

They both acted as producers, perhaps Pressburger slightly more than Powell, since he could soothe the feathers ruffled by Powell&#x27;s forthright manner. They became their own producers mainly to stop anyone else from interfering, since they had a considerable degree of freedom, especially under Rank, to make just about any film they wanted.

The direction was nearly all done by Powell, but even so The Archers generally worked as a team, with the cast and crew often making suggestions. Pressburger was always on hand, usually on the studio floor, to make sure that these late changes fit seamlessly into the story.

Once the filming was finished, Powell usually went off for a walk in the hills of Scotland to clear his head, but Pressburger was often closely involved in the editing, especially in the way the music was used. Pressburger was a musician himself and had played the violin in an orchestra in Hungary.

When the film was finally ready and Powell was back from the Highlands, he was usually &quot;the front man&quot; in any promotional work, such as interviews for the trade papers or fan magazines.

Because collaborative efforts such as Powell and Pressburger&#x27;s were, and continue to be, unusual in the film industry, and because of the influence of the auteur theory, which elevates the director as a film&#x27;s primary creator, Pressburger has sometimes been dismissed as &quot;Michael Powell&#x27;s scriptwriter&quot;. Powell himself consistently, emphatically and categorically rejected this characterization, and was the first to say, in many interviews, that he couldn&#x27;t have done most of what he did without Pressburger working as a full and equal film-making partner.

===Post-war success and decline===
* &quot;Black Narcissus&quot; (1947)
* &quot;The End of the River&quot; (1947) (producers only; written by Wolfgang Wilhelm, directed by Derek Twist)
* &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (1948)
* &quot;The Small Back Room&quot; (1949)
* &quot;The Elusive Pimpernel&quot; (1950)
* &quot;Gone to Earth&quot; (1950). A substantially re-edited version was released in the US as &quot;The Wild Heart&quot; (1952) by co-producer David O. Selznick, after a court battle with Powell and Pressburger. The film was fully restored by the British Film Archive in 1985.
* &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot; (1951)

===End of the partnership===
After the early 1950s, Powell and Pressburger began to produce fewer films. Their last two films were financially successful, but the duo&#x27;s mid-1950s output met with less critical success than their earlier films. Powell himself felt that &quot;Ill Met by Moonlight&quot; was The Archers&#x27; worst film.
* &quot;Oh... Rosalinda!!&quot; (1955)
* &quot;The Battle of the River Plate&quot; (1956)
* &quot;Ill Met by Moonlight&quot; (1957)

The Archers&#x27; productions officially came to an end in 1957, and the pair separated to pursue their individual careers. The separation was amicable, and they remained devoted friends for the rest of their lives.

===Later collaboration===
The pair reunited for two films:
* &quot;They&#x27;re a Weird Mob&quot; (1966)
* &quot;The Boy Who Turned Yellow&quot; (1972)

For both these films, Powell was credited as the sole director, and Pressburger as the sole screenwriter (for &quot;They&#x27;re a Weird Mob&quot;, Pressburger used the pseudonym &quot;Richard Imrie&quot;). Powell produced &quot;They&#x27;re a Weird Mob&quot;, Pressburger produced &quot;The Boy Who Turned Yellow&quot;.

==Regular cast and crew==
Powell and Pressburger re-used actors and crew members in a number of films. Actors who were part of The Archers&#x27; &quot;stock company&quot; include:

* Pamela Brown (&quot;One of Our Aircraft Is Missing&quot;, &quot;I Know Where I&#x27;m Going!&quot;, &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;)
* Kathleen Byron (&quot;The Silver Fleet&quot;, &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot;, &quot;Black Narcissus&quot;, &quot;The Small Back Room&quot;)
* Robert Coote (&quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot;, &quot;The Elusive Pimpernel&quot;)
* Finlay Currie (&quot;The Edge of the World&quot;, &quot;49th Parallel&quot;, &quot;I Know Where I&#x27;m Going!&quot;)
* Cyril Cusack (&quot;The Small Back Room&quot;, &quot;The Elusive Pimpernel&quot;, &quot;Gone to Earth&quot;, &quot;Ill Met by Moonlight&quot;)

Powell &amp; Pressburger also produced two films written and directed by crewmembers or compatriots of through their production company.
* &quot;The Silver Fleet&quot;, based on an original story by Pressburger, was written and directed by Vernon Sewell and Gordon Wellesley, who like Powell and Pressburger worked as a team and were both credited in both roles. Sewell had previously worked for Powell as a crew member on &quot;The Edge of the World&quot;, and Wellesley had co-written &quot;Atlantic Ferry&quot; with Pressburger.
* &quot;The End of the River&quot; was written by Wolfgang Wilhelm and directed by Derek Twist. In the 30&#x27;s, Twist had edited &quot;The Fire Raisers&quot;, &quot;The Phantom Light&quot;, &quot;The Edge of the World&quot;, and &quot;The Lion Has Wings&quot;, all directed or co-directed by Powell. Wilhelm had co-written the screenplay of 1943&#x27;s &quot;Squadron Leader X&quot; from a story by Pressburger.

==Critical opinions==
British film critics gave the films of Powell and Pressburger a mixed reaction at the time, acknowledging their creativity, but sometimes questioning their motivations and taste. For better or worse, The Archers were always out of step with mainstream British cinema.

From the 1970s onwards, British critical opinion began to revise this lukewarm assessment, with their first BFI retrospective in 1970 and another in 1978. They are now seen as playing a key part in the history of British film, and have become influential and iconic for many film-makers of later generations, such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and George A. Romero, among others.

<text>The Peugeot 403 is a mid-size car manufactured and marketed by Peugeot between May 1955 and October 1966. A total of 1,214,121 of all types, including commercial models, were produced, making it the first Peugeot to exceed one million in sales.

==History==
The 403 debuted as a sedan/saloon on 20 April 1955 at the Trocadéro Palace in Paris. For several months before it was launched, numerous 403s, their badges removed, were driving on the roads near the manufacturer&#x27;s Sochaux factory. They became so familiar that the locals no longer noticed them, but attracted the Paris motoring press to a town usually of little interest to the national media.

The TN3 engine size gave the car a &quot;tax horsepower&quot; of 8 CV, which placed it a class below the soon-to-be-replaced 11 CV Citroën Traction, but at least one class above the small cars produced by the principal competitor manufacturers.

When it was first shown, and until after 1958, the leading edge of car&#x27;s nose carried an angular, forward-leaning chrome lion bonnet ornament – as Peugeot&#x27;s trade mark. That was removed for 1959, due to safety concerns, and the logo was incorporated into a shield-shaped grill emblem.

Subsequently the semaphore-style trafficators on the C-pillars were replaced with flashing indicators within the light cluster. The front lights were modified to conform to new standards and in 1957 parallel windscreen wipers were substituted for the original &quot;cross hands&quot; design featured at launch.

Although, the car was subject to numerous improvements during production, mostly minor. Improvements for 1959, included moving the nozzles for the windscreen washer from the strip of metal between the base of the windscreen and the bonnet/hood a short distance to the rear edge of the bonnet/hood itself. This was also the year the semi-circular ring inside the lower half of the steering wheel operating the horn was replaced by a full circular horn-ring.

==Design==
Styled by Pinin Farina, the 403 featured ponton, three-box styling incorporating, except on the most basic models, a metal sunroof. The collaboration with PininFarina marked the start of a partnership which would see the Italian designer producing designs for Peugeot, including those many mainstream volume models, for more than fifty years. Regarding the 403 itself there were persistent rumours that the design was one originally intended for a replacement Fiat 1900 which had been rejected when Turin had decided to defer replacement of the Fiat for another four years.

Unusual in Europe at the time were the wide, 90° opening rear doors. Also unusual were the windows in the rear doors that lowered fully, despite the intrusion of the wheel arch into the door frame.

==Engine==
The 403 used an enlarged version of the Peugeot 203&#x27;s 1290 cc petrol engine. Displacing 1468 cc, the straight-four unit employed pushrod-actuated valves and hemispherical combustion chambers and a crossflow cylinder head to produce at about 4,900 rpm and of torque at 2,500 rpm. Power increased to in 1958. An unusual feature at the time was the thermostatically controlled engine fan which cut out when the engine temperature fell to 75°C and reengaged when the engine temperature increased to 84°C. Claimed advantages included an improvement in fuel consumption of between 5% and 10% according to average speed and the avoidance, under many conditions, of fan noise. A small hot water-activated heating device for the carburetor linked to the heater for the passenger cabin — operating only when the driver activated the cabin heat, but not when the ambient temperature was high enough for the heater to be left off.

A diesel powered Peugeot 403 estate was introduced in the Autumn of 1958, the first of a long line, followed by a diesel saloon a year later.

After the 203&#x27;s discontinuation in 1960, a version of its 1290 cc powerplant became available as an option on a reduced specification version of the 403, branded initially as the &quot;403 Sept&quot; (&quot;7&quot;) and soon afterwards as the &quot;403 Berline Luxe&quot;. Car tax in France was mostly based on engine size, and the smaller engined 403 fell within the 7CV taxation class rather than the 8CV of the bigger version.

==Transmission==
The 403 used a manual 4-speed all-synchromesh transmission driving the rear wheels. The gear change lever stuck out from the right side of the steering column.

For the Paris Motor Show in October 1957 the manufacturer offered, at extra cost, an electro-magnetic Jaeger automatic clutch, activated when changing gear.

==Interior==
The front seats reclined, allowing their seat backs to be flush with the cushions of the rear seat, creating a &quot;couchette&quot;.

==Body variants==
The wheelbase was lengthened by for the five door Peugeot 403 &quot;Familiale&quot; and &quot;Commerciale&quot; estate versions. The Familiale provided a third row of seats and was described as a 7/8 seater while the Commerciale offered a more conventional seat configuration for an estate car.

The lengthened 403 estate had a solid rear axle fitted to an aluminum differential case. It used a manual column shift and in &quot;Familiale&quot; trim included fully reclinable front seats. Sunroof and steel belted radial tires were standard.

A two-door cabriolet version of the car was also offered, with a luxurious interior featuring high quality leather upholstery. In 1958 the 403 cabriolet cost 80% more than the entry level &quot;berline grand luxe&quot; 403 sedan, and presumably for this reason the convertible 403 was produced and sold only in very modest numbers. In the spring of 1961 production of the 403 cabriolet ended, in anticipation of the launch later that year of the manufacturer&#x27;s 404 Cabriolet.

2-door pickup and 3-door van commercial variants of the 403 were also produced.

Largely superseded by the Peugeot 404 in 1960, the 403 did remain available as a budget alternative. While the 403 saloon was taken out of production at the end of October 1966, leaving only the pickup truck (&quot;camionnette&quot;). This was supplanted by the 404 pickup in March 1967.

In addition to Argentinian and Australian production, the local Volkswagen assembler in New Zealand assembled 1,033 Peugeot 403s in just under four years, beginning in March 1960.

The Argentinian version reached 90% integration of local parts.

<text>Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan (2 April 1902 – 23 April 1968) was an Indian vocalist, from the Kasur Patiala Gharana.

==Early life and background==
Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan was born in Kasur, of the erstwhile Punjab Province, British India in 1902. Following partition of India in 1947, Kasur Tehsil was allocated to Pakistan.
At the age of five, Bade Ghulam began training in vocal music from his uncle Kale Khan, and later from his father. He had three younger brothers namely Barkat Ali Khan, Mubarak Ali Khan and Amanat Ali Khan.

Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan had two sons from his first marriage to Allah Jawai. Munawar Ali Khan, his younger son, was born in August 1930 and Karamat Ali Khan, his elder son, was born in Lahore on 28 December 1928. Seven sons were born to his elder son Karamat Ali Khan: Baqi Ali, Asif Ali, Mazhar Ali Khan, Jawaad Ali Khan, Mehdi Ali, Sajjad Ali, and Naqi Ali Khan. Out of the seven sons, three have carried on the Gharana lineage and are still singing. Mazhar Ali Khan died in New Delhi, India, in September 2021. Three children were born to Munawar Ali Khan: two sons, Raza Ali Khan, Shakir Ali Khan, and a daughter. Raza Ali Khan is carrying on the Gharana customs as well.

==Singing career==

Though he started his career by singing a few compositions of his late father Ali Baksh Khan and uncle Kale Khan, Bade Ghulam amalgamated the best of three traditions into his own Patiala-Kasur style:
* The Behram Khani elements of Dhrupad
* The gyrations of Jaipur and
* The behlavas (embellishments) of Gwalior.
Many of his raga expositions were brief, contrary to convention, and, while he agreed that the beauty of classical music lay in leisurely improvisation, he believed that the audience would not appreciate long alaps, particularly considering his tendency towards singing for the masses. He, therefore, changed the music to what the audience wanted. He excelled at more light-hearted ragas such as:
* Adana
* Bhupali
* Hameer
* Jaijaiwanti and
* Jaunpuri.
Under the pen name of Sabrang, he created many new compositions. Unlike his younger son, Munawar Ali Khan, who had an open-throated voice, Khan Sahib&#x27;s voice was slurred.

After the Partition of India in 1947, Bade Ghulam Ali Khan went to his hometown Kasur in Pakistan, but moved to India later to live permanently in 1957. With the help of the Bombay Chief Minister, Morarji Desai, he acquired Indian citizenship and moved to a bungalow at Malabar Hill in Mumbai. He lived at various times in Lahore, Bombay, Calcutta, and finally Hyderabad.

For a long time, he stayed away from singing in films, despite requests and persuasion from well-known producers and music directors. Finally, after much coaxing, he was convinced by the film producer, K Asif, to sing two songs based on the ragas Sohni and Rageshri for the 1960 film Mughal-e-Azam, with music directed by Naushad. He demanded and received an extremely high price, reportedly ₹ 25,000 per song, at a time when the rates of popular and star playback singers such as Lata Mangeshkar and Mohammed Rafi were below ₹ 500 per song.

==Awards and recognition==
*Sangeet Natak Akademi Award (1962) 
*Sangeet Natak Akademi fellow (1967) 
*Padma Bhushan Award (1962)

==Death and legacy==

He died in Basheer Bagh Palace in Hyderabad on 23 April 1968 after a prolonged illness that had left him partially paralyzed in the last few years of his life. He continued to sing and perform in public with the support of his son, Munawar Ali Khan, until his death. He was buried at Daira Mir Momin cemetery in Hyderabad.

Indian film director Harisadhan Dasgupta made a documentary film about Khan in 1968, titled &quot;Bade Ghulam Ali Khan Sahib&quot;.

In 2017, the &quot;Bade Ghulam Ali Khan Yaadgaar Sabha&quot; was founded by his disciple Malti Gilani. It helps to keep his music and memory alive even today.

The main street at Basheerbagh is named &quot;Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan Marg&quot; in his honour.

<doc id="1272917" wikidata="Q1414939" url="?curid=1272917" title="Inoue Enryō">
<text>was a Japanese philosopher, Shin Buddhist priest and reformer, educator, and royalist. A key figure in the reception of Western philosophy, the emergence of modern Buddhism, and the permeation of the imperial ideology during the second half of the Meiji Era. He is the founder of Toyo University and the creator of Tetsugaku-dō Park (Temple Garden of Philosophy) in Tokyo. Because he studied all kinds of mysterious phenomena and in order to debunk superstitions, he is sometimes called and the .

==Biography==

===Early Years 1858-1881===
Born in a village close to Nagaoka in today&#x27;s Niigata Prefecture, he was ordained as a priest in the Ōtani Branch (大谷派) of Shin Buddhism (真宗) at the age of 13. As the oldest son, he was brought up to inherit the ministry of his father&#x27;s parish temple. His early education included the Chinese classics and Western subjects like geography and English. In 1878, his Buddhist order sent him to Tokyo in order to study at Japan&#x27;s first modern university. Before entering Tokyo University in 1881 Inoue received additional secondary education in English, history, and mathematics in the university&#x27;s Preparatory School.

===Establishment 1881-1888===

Registering for philosophy as single major at Tokyo University first became possible in 1881. Inoue was the first and only student in 1881 to do so. As a student, Inoue initiated Japan&#x27;s first Society of Philosophy (1884). On the occasion of his graduation in 1885, he created a Philosophy Ceremony that commemorated Buddha, Confucius, Socrates and Kant as the Four Sages of world philosophy. In 1887, he set up a Philosophy Publishing House , edited the first issue of the &quot;Journal of the Philosophy Society&quot;and founded the Philosophy Academy , the predecessor of today&#x27;s Toyo University (). His early works &quot;Epitome of Philosophy&quot;(1886/86) and &quot;Outline of Ethics&quot;(1887) are the first Japanese introductions to philosophy in East and West.

Besides establishing and popularizing philosophy, Inoue dedicated himself as a lay scholar to the critique of Christianity and the reform of Buddhism. The latter project he announced in the &quot;Prolegomena to a Living Discourse on Buddhism&quot;(1887), which is the introduction to a tripartite work that aimed to give Buddhism a new doctrinal foundation for the modern world. In the &quot;Prolegomena&quot; Inoue first proclaimed his lifelong slogan &quot;Protection of Country and Love of Truth&quot; . Inoue attempted to demonstrate Buddhism&#x27;s consistency with philosophical and scientific truth and its benefit to the modern Japanese nation state.

In 1886, Inoue married Yoshida Kei (1862-1951) with whom he had one son, Gen&#x27;ichi (1887-1972), and two daughters, Shigeno (1890-1954) and Sumie (1899-1979).

===Leadership 1889-1902===

In 1888, Inoue departed on his first of three world tours. The nationalist spirit he observed in the Western imperial countries and the promulgation of the Imperial Rescript on Education (1890) after his return, gave Inoue&#x27;s maxim of the Protection of Country concrete meaning. The spread of the Education Rescript as the moral foundation of the rising Japanese Empire became one of his main objectives for the rest of his life.

In his lectures at the Philosophy Academy, Inoue pioneered several academic fields. Inoue&#x27;s lecture records which were published as textbooks for the Academy&#x27;s distance learning program cover subjects like Psychology, Pedagogy, Religious Studies, Buddhist Philosophy and the original science Inoue called Mystery Studies . In a large-scale project, he recorded, categorized and rationally explained every kind of folk belief and superstition he heard about in Japan. This ambitious program made him famous among his contemporaries as Doctor Specter or .

Inoue managed the Philosophy Academy as an institution that promoted the revival of Eastern scholarship. Most pioneers of modern Buddhist studies were lecturing in the Academy. Inoue interpreted his role as a lobbyist for Buddhism in the capital and worked to consolidate the position of private education with the Ministry of Education. In 1896, Inoue was the first to be awarded a Doctor of Letters by submitting a thesis to the Faculty of Literature of Tokyo Imperial University.

===Crisis 1903-1906===

While Inoue was on his second world tour, the so-called Philosophy Academy Incident (1903/04) took its course. Inspectors from the Education Ministry became aware that one student received a full score in the ethics examination for answering that regicide under certain circumstances could be legitimate. The ministry threatened to close down the Academy, demanded that the responsible teacher resign and withdrew the Academy&#x27;s right to grant certificates for teaching in public schools.

In the years after the Philosophy Academy Incident several factors played together which eventually led to Inoue&#x27;s resignation from the Academy in 1905/06: (1) internal differences about the Academy&#x27;s management, (2) estrangement from other Buddhist leaders, (3) health problems.

During the same period, Inoue started two new projects that became seminal for his late activities: the foundation of the Morality Church (1903) and the building of the Philosophy Shrine (1904).

===Independence 1906-1919===

Starting in 1890, lecture tours were important for Inoue to raise funds for the Philosophy Academy. After 1906, the fund raising served to create the Temple Garden of Philosophy around the Philosophy Shrine in today&#x27;s Nakano District in Tokyo. Inoue started his lecture tours during his late period in the name of the Morality Church initiative, which aimed at establishing Sunday schools in shrines and temples all over the country. In 1912, he renamed the organization into the Society for the Spread of Civic Morality . The venue of his lectures moved away from temples into primary schools. The main objective however stayed the same, namely teaching national morals and spreading the Imperial Rescript on Education. It was Inoue&#x27;s ambition to lecture literally everywhere in Japan. During his late life, he extended his radius to the new Japanese colonies in Korea, Manchuria, Hokkaidō, Sakhalin, Okinawa, Taiwan, and China.

Inoue died on June 6 1919 after giving a lecture in Dalian, China.

==Influence and Evaluation==

During his lifetime, Inoue was a widely read author, of whom more than ten books were translated into Chinese. His works were influential in spreading the terminology of modern East Asian humanities. Due to his prolific writing, the distance learning program of the Philosophy Academy and his lectures tours, Inoue probably had a larger audience than any other public intellectual before the First World War. He must have contributed considerably to the decline of superstition and the spread of the imperial ideology during the late Meiji period.

His prominence during his lifetime stands in stark contrast to the minimal attention paid to his work after his death. His uncritical speculative metaphysics and his ethics being based solely on imperially decreed virtues, make any future affirmative philosophical reception unlikely. Japanese Buddhist studies have passed over Inoue, because his Buddhist scholarship was not yet based on Sanskrit philology. Any philosophical discussion about the doctrinal foundations of Buddhism will nonetheless have to acknowledge Inoue&#x27;s pioneering work.

In contemporary scholarship, a growing interest in his voluminous works on Mystery Studies is conceivable.

Toyo University, Tokyo University&#x27;s Society of Philosophy, and the Temple Garden of Philosophy are Inoue&#x27;s lasting institutional heritage.

<text>Herman Charles Merivale MA (27 January 1839 – 17 August 1906) was an English dramatist and poet, son of Herman Merivale. He also used the punning pseudonym Felix Dale.

==Life== 
Herman Charles Merivale was born in London on 27 January 1839, the only son of Herman Merivale (1806–1874), a barrister and civil servant who was permanent under-secretary of the India Office, and his wife, Caroline Penelope Robinson (d. 1881), daughter of the Revd William Villiers Robinson. Merivale was educated at Harrow School and Balliol College, Oxford, where Algernon Charles Swinburne and Charles Bowen were his contemporaries. He graduated BA in 1861. At his father&#x27;s home he met many distinguished men, including Lord Robert Cecil (afterwards Prime Minister Lord Salisbury), who became a lifelong friend. His friends in literary and dramatic circles included William Makepeace Thackeray, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, Matthew Arnold, Anthony Trollope, W. S. Gilbert, Arthur Sullivan, Edmund Yates, Charles Dickens and others.
Following his father&#x27;s death in 1874 he gave up the law in favour of literature and the theatre. Merivale wrote many farces and burlesques. For John Hollingshead he produced a burlesque, &quot;The Lady of Lyons Married and Settled&quot;, performed at the Gaiety Theatre (1878), and &quot;Called There and Back&quot; (1884). &quot;The Butler&quot; (1886) and &quot;The Don&quot; (1888) were both written for the actor J. L. Toole. In writing &quot;The Don&quot;, and other works, Merivale was assisted by his wife, Elizabeth, the daughter of John Pittman, whom he married in London on 13 May 1878.

During the 1870s, he was a resident of Ticehurst House Hospital after suffering depression for many years following a breakdown. He wrote of his experiences there in a book called &quot;My Experiences in a Lunatic Asylum by a Sane Patient&quot;. In 1879 he went to Australia on the advice of his physician, and then returned with his health recovered, only to discover that the power of attorney he had left with a defaulting solicitor had cost him his entire fortune.

A few years before his death Merivale became a Roman Catholic. He died suddenly of heart failure on 14 January 1906 at 69 Woodstock Road, Acton, Middlesex, and was buried in his father&#x27;s grave in Brompton Cemetery. He had no children, and his widow was granted a civil-list pension of £50 in 1906.

<doc id="1272919" wikidata="Q695274" url="?curid=1272919" title="Philhellenism">
<text>Philhellenism (&quot;the love of Greek culture&quot;) was an intellectual movement prominent mostly at the turn of the 19th century. It contributed to the sentiments that led Europeans such as Lord Byron, Charles Nicolas Fabvier and Richard Church to advocate for Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire.

The later 19th-century European philhellenism was largely to be found among the Classicists. The study of it falls under Classical Reception Studies and is a continuation of the Classical tradition.

==Antiquity==

In antiquity, the term &quot;philhellene&quot; (&quot;the admirer of Greeks and everything Greek&quot;), from the (, from &quot;φίλος&quot; - &quot;philos&quot;, &quot;friend&quot;, &quot;lover&quot; + &quot;Ἕλλην&quot; - &quot;Hellen&quot;, &quot;Greek&quot;) was used to describe both non-Greeks who were fond of ancient Greek culture and Greeks who patriotically upheld their culture. The Liddell-Scott Greek-English Lexicon defines &#x27;philhellene&#x27; as &quot;fond of the Hellenes, mostly of foreign princes, as Amasis; of Parthian kings[...]; also of Hellenic tyrants, as Jason of Pherae and generally of Hellenic (Greek) patriots. According to Xenophon, an honorable Greek should also be a philhellene.

Some examples:
*Evagoras of Cyprus and Philip II were both called &quot;philhellenes&quot; by Isocrates
*The early rulers of the Parthian Empire, starting with Mithridates I (), used the title of philhellenes on their coins, which was a political act done in order to establish friendly relations with their Greek subjects.
*Following the example of the Parthians, Tigranes adopted the title of Philhellene (&quot;friend of the Greeks&quot;). The layout of his capital Tigranocerta was an example of Greek architecture.

===Roman philhellenes===
The literate upper classes of Ancient Rome were increasingly Hellenized in their culture during the 3rd century BC.
Among Romans the career of Titus Quinctius Flamininus (died 174 BC), who appeared at the Isthmian Games in Corinth in 196 BC and proclaimed the freedom of the Greek states, was fluent in Greek, stood out, according to Livy, as a great admirer of Greek culture. The Greeks hailed him as their liberator. There were some Romans during the late Republic, who were distinctly anti-Greek, resenting the increasing influence of Greek culture on Roman life, an example being the Roman Censor, Cato the Elder and Cato the Younger, who lived during the &quot;Greek invasion&quot; of Rome but towards the later years of his life he eventually became a philhellene after his stay in Rhodes. 

The lyric poet Quintus Horatius Flaccus, often anglicized as Horace, was another philhellene. He is notable for his words, &quot;Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit et artis intulit agresti Latio&quot; (Conquered Greece took captive her savage conqueror and brought her arts into rustic Latium), meaning that after the conquest of Greece the defeated Greeks created a cultural hegemony over the Romans.

Horace&#x27;s contemporary lyric poets, Virgil and Ovid, both produced magnum opuses (the Aeneid and the Metamorphoses, respectively) which were substantially founded upon Hellenic references and culture. Additionally, Virgil&#x27;s Eclogues were inspired by Theocritus&#x27; earlier pastoral poetry in his idylls. The Aeneid, Virgil&#x27;s story of Rome&#x27;s founding myth, notably shares several similarities with Homer&#x27;s earlier epics, particularly the Odyssey, one of which being both his epic and the Odyssey follow a demigod protagonist&#x27;s military voyage after the Trojan War. It also was influenced by Homer&#x27;s Iliad; for example, the ekphrasis of Achilles&#x27; divine shield from his mother, Thetis, was mirrored by the ekphrasis of Aeneas&#x27; divine shield from his mother, Venus. Ovid&#x27;s work was perhaps even more influenced by ancient Greek culture than Virgil; his Metamorphoses were inspired by the Greek epic tradition and metamorphosis poetry in the Hellenistic tradition, and its content was derived to a large extent from Greek myth and folklore, including the Trojan War. Ovid&#x27;s treatment of Greek myths was so impactful for later Philhellenism, especially during the Renaissance, that the well-known versions of some myths are actually Ovid&#x27;s versions (e.g. Echo and Narcissus). Soon after these writers, other Roman lyric poets such as Lucan (inspired by Greek epics with his Pharsalia) or Persius (heavily inspired by Horace with his &quot;Life&quot;) continued to exhibit strong interests and admirations for Greek literary, artistic, and religious culture. 

Roman emperors known for their philhellenism include Nero, Hadrian, Marcus Aurelius and Julian the Apostate.

==Modern times==

In the period of political reaction and repression after the fall of Napoleon, when the liberal-minded, educated and prosperous middle and upper classes of European societies found the Romantic nationalism of 1789–1792 repressed by the restoration of absolute monarchy at home, the idea of the re-creation of a Greek state on the very territories that were sanctified by their view of Antiquity—which was reflected even in the furnishings of their own parlors and the contents of their bookcases—offered an ideal, set at a romantic distance. Under these conditions, the Greek uprising constituted a source of inspiration and expectations that could never actually be fulfilled, disappointing what Paul Cartledge called &quot;the Victorian self-identification with the Glory that was Greece&quot;. American higher education was fundamentally transformed by the rising admiration of and identification with ancient Greece in the 1830s and afterward.

Another popular subject of interest in Greek culture at the turn of the 19th century was the shadowy Scythian philosopher Anacharsis, who lived in the 6th century BC. The new prominence of Anacharsis was sparked by Jean-Jacques Barthélemy&#x27;s fanciful &quot;Travels of Anacharsis the Younger in Greece&quot; (1788), a learned imaginary travel journal, one of the first historical novels, which a modern scholar has called &quot;the encyclopedia of the new cult of the antique&quot; in the late 18th century. It had a high impact on the growth of philhellenism in France: the book went through many editions, was reprinted in the United States and was translated into German and other languages. It later inspired European sympathy for the Greek War of Independence and spawned sequels and imitations throughout the 19th century.

In German culture the first phase of philhellenism can be traced in the careers and writings of Johann Joachim Winckelmann, one of the inventors of art history, Friedrich August Wolf, who inaugurated modern Homeric scholarship with his &quot;Prolegomena ad Homerum&quot; (1795) and the enlightened bureaucrat Wilhelm von Humboldt. It was also in this context that Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Hölderlin were to compose poetry and prose in the field of literature, elevating Hellenic themes in their works. One of the most renowned German philhellenes of the 19th century was Friedrich Nietzsche. In the German states, the private obsession with ancient Greece took public forms, institutionalizing an elite philhellene ethos through the &quot;Gymnasium&quot;, to revitalize German education at home, and providing on two occasions high-minded philhellene German princes ignorant of modern-day Greek realities, to be Greek sovereigns.

During the later 19th century the new studies of archaeology and anthropology began to offer a quite separate view of ancient Greece, which had previously been experienced second-hand only through Greek literature, Greek sculpture and architecture. Twentieth-century heirs of the 19th-century view of an unchanging, immortal quality of &quot;Greekness&quot; are typified in J. C. Lawson&#x27;s &quot;Modern Greek Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion&quot; (1910) or R. and E. Blum&#x27;s &quot;The Dangerous Hour: The lore of crisis and mystery in rural Greece&quot; (1970).

According to the Classicist Paul Cartledge, they &quot;represent this ideological construction of Greekness as an essence, a Classicizing essence to be sure, impervious to such historic changes as that from paganism to Orthodox Christianity, or from subsistence peasant agriculture to more or less internationally market-driven capitalist farming.&quot;

The Philhellenic movement led to the introduction of Classics or &quot;Classical studies&quot; as a key element in education, introduced in the Gymnasien in Prussia. In England the main proponent of Classics in schools was Thomas Arnold, headmaster at Rugby School.

Nikos Dimou&#x27;s &quot;The Misfortune to be Greek&quot; argues that the Philhellenes&#x27; expectation for the modern Greek people to live up to their ancestors&#x27; allegedly glorious past has always been a burden upon the Greeks themselves. In particular, Western Philhellenism focused exclusively on the heritage of Classical Greece, while negating or rejecting the heritage of the Byzantine Empire and the Greek Orthodox Church, which for the Greek people are at least as important.
===Art===
Philhellenism also created a renewed interest in the artistic movement of Neoclassicism, which idealized fifth-century Classical Greek art and architecture, very much at second hand, through the writings of the first generation of art historians, like Johann Joachim Winckelmann and Gotthold Ephraim Lessing.

The groundswell of the Philhellenic movement was result of two generations of intrepid artists and amateur treasure-seekers, from Stuart and Revett, who published their measured drawings as &quot;The Antiquities of Athens&quot; and culminating with the removal of sculptures from Aegina and the Parthenon (the Elgin Marbles), works that inspired the British Philhellenes, many of whom, however, deplored their removal.

===Greek War of Independence and later===

Many well-known philhellenes supported the Greek Independence Movement such as Shelley, Thomas Moore, Leigh Hunt, Cam Hobhouse, Walter Savage Landor and Jeremy Bentham.

Some, notably Lord Byron, even took up arms to join the Greek revolutionaries. Many more financed the revolution or contributed through their artistic work.

Throughout the 19th century, philhellenes continued to support Greece politically and militarily. For example, Ricciotti Garibaldi led a volunteer expedition (&quot;Garibaldini&quot;) in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897. A group of Garibaldini, headed by the Greek poet Lorentzos Mavilis, fought also with the Greek side during the Balkan Wars.

<doc id="1272921" wikidata="Q7740497" url="?curid=1272921" title="The House (radio program)">
<text>The House is a Canadian national politics and current affairs radio program, airing nationally on Saturday mornings on CBC Radio One with repeat broadcasts Saturday nights. The show&#x27;s contents and format are similar to a television Sunday morning talk show. It is produced from the studios of CBO-FM at the CBC Ottawa Broadcast Centre in Ottawa, Ontario.

The program&#x27;s current host is Catherine Cullen.

==History==
The program debuted on October 22, 1977, soon after the rules of the House of Commons of Canada were changed to permit radio and television broadcasts of the chamber&#x27;s proceedings. The program&#x27;s original concept was to simply record and air House debates, although the producers soon decided to add interview and journalism segments to broaden the program&#x27;s scope and appeal.

In late 2001 and early 2002, during the same repositioning process that ultimately saw the network&#x27;s weekday morning program &quot;This Morning&quot; replaced with &quot;The Current&quot; and &quot;Sounds Like Canada&quot;, media began to report that &quot;The House&quot; was also slated for cancellation. The CBC acknowledged that the show&#x27;s future was under consideration, but denied that any decision to cancel it had already been made. When the CBC formally announced its new programming lineup in May 2002, &quot;The House&quot; remained on the schedule.

==Content==
The content is focused on interviews with Canadian politicians, advocates, and commentators, with infrequent radio documentaries and a weekly &quot;in-House panel&quot; discussion featuring a rotating roster of CBC and external political journalists including Terry Milewski, Rosemary Barton, Ici RDI&#x27;s Emmanuelle Latraverse, Joël-Denis Bellavance of &quot;La Presse&quot;, and pundit Tasha Kheiriddin. In the late 2000s, it also featured a segment called &quot;That&#x27;s a Good Question,&quot; in which Kady O&#x27;Malley answered listener questions about political processes.

Apart from the serious current affairs pieces, the show has also aired some complementary entertainment features. These have included &quot;Beat the House,&quot; where listeners are challenged to guess the identity of the mystery guest who was a notable figure in recent Canadian political news who gives a series of clues, and &quot;A Little Housecleaning,&quot; which features political satirical humour. The Christmas episode is reserved for an annual holiday House Quiz, a game show-format political trivia competition featuring a panel of CBC journalists as competitors, each equipped with a different humorous noisemaker used to claim precedence in answering questions posed by the host about news stories from throughout the year.

The digital archive on the CBC&#x27;s website includes selected segments from the program dating as far back as 1978.

==Hosts==
The program&#x27;s original host was Marguerite McDonald. Since then, it has been hosted by Stephen Boissonneault, Denise Rudnicki, Judy Morrison (1980s), Jason Moscovitz (1990s), Anthony Germain (2001–2006), Kathleen Petty (2006–2011) and Evan Solomon (2011–2015).

After Solomon&#x27;s dismissal from the CBC in June 2015, Rosemary Barton hosted the first episode, while parliamentary reporter Chris Hall hosted thereafter.

Hall retired from the CBC in June 2022.

On August 17, 2022, it was announced that Catherine Cullen will be the new permanent host.

<text>Edith Caroline Rivett (6 May 1894 – 2 July 1958) was a British crime writer, who wrote under the pseudonyms E. C. R. Lorac, Carol Carnac and Mary Le Bourne during the golden age of detective fiction.

==Life and career==
===Childhood===

The youngest daughter of Harry (1861–1900) and Beatrice Rivett (née Foot; 1868–1943), Edith was born in Hendon, Middlesex, (now London) on 6 May 1894. She had two sisters, Gladys and Maud. In 1898 the family emigrated to Australia, for warm weather to treat Harry Rivett&#x27;s tuberculosis. This was unsuccessful, and in 1900 the family returned, travelling on the SS &quot;Illawarra&quot;. Harry Rivett died on the voyage, and was buried at sea.

When the family reached London, they were literally penniless but were received into the welcoming, if crowded, household of Beatrice Rivett&#x27;s father, Edward Foot, and the widow found employment as an assistant rate collector. Edith attended South Hampstead High School, and the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London and she continued as a craft practitioner throughout her life; her work included embroidery and calligraphy that has been on display at Westminster Abbey.

===Literary career===

She published her first detective novel in 1931; this was &quot;The Murder on the Burrows&quot;, a well-crafted debut which launched her detective Macdonald on a career that was to last for more than a quarter of a century. Nine Lorac novels were published by Sampson Low, earning increasingly favourable reviews, before she moved to the more prestigious imprint of Collins Crime Club in 1936, with Crime Counter Crime, set during a General Election. She remained a Crime Club stalwart for the rest of her life.

John Curran, historian of the Crime Club, argues that she was especially well served by the designers of the cover artwork for her books, and this is no doubt one of the factors that has made her work especially collectable. First editions in the attractive dust jackets of the period can now change hands—on the rare occasions when they come on to the market—for thousands of pounds.

She was equally at home with urban and rural settings. Her early books include &quot;Murder in St John’s Wood&quot; and &quot;Murder in Chelsea&quot;, while two other books set in London, &quot;Bats in the Belfry&quot; and the war-time mystery &quot;Murder by Matchlight&quot;.

Like Rosanne Manaton, a character in her &quot;Checkmate to Murder&quot;, she was artistic and had an interest in ski-ing; the winter sport plays a central part in her Carol Carnac novel &quot;Crossed Skis&quot;, also published by the British Library.
In November 1940, having been evacuated to Devon, she wrote to a friend about the horrors of living through a war. Referring to the death of one of her oldest friends, killed while fire-fighting, she said: “Most of my other friends have been bombed or burnt out of their homes. What a sickening insanity it all is.”

===Personal life and death===
Remaining unmarried, she lived her last years with her elder sister, Gladys Rivett (1891–1966), in the village of Aughton, in Lonsdale, Lancashire. She became a popular figure in the village while continuing to work productively as a detective novelist. To this day, she is remembered in the local community as spirited and strong-willed, a woman with a strong social conscience. Edith Rivett died at the Caton Green Nursing Home, Caton-with-Littledale, near Lancaster. According to the probate records for her will, she left an estate valued at £10,602, 16 shillings [about £250,000 in 2020]. Rivett is buried in the churchyard at St Saviour&#x27;s Church, Aughton.

Westminster Abbey holds a number of works by the Sheffield-trained silversmith Omar Ramsden. One of these was given by Miss Carol Rivett in memory of her grandfather, Edward Smith Foot. It is a silver alms dish of hammer and repousse work. She also donated a tunicle (the vestment worn by a subdeacon) to the Abbey.

===Legacy===
As of 2021, the British Library has included eight novels by E.C.R. Lorac in its &quot;Crime Classics&quot; series of re-issued works: &quot;Fire in the Thatch&quot;; &quot;Bats in the Belfry&quot;; &quot;Murder by Matchlight&quot;; &quot;Murder in the Mill-Race&quot;; &quot;Fell Murder&quot;; &quot;Checkmate to Murder&quot; and &quot;Crossed Skis&quot;. A previously unpublished late work, &quot;Two-Way Murder&quot;, was added in 2021; the original manuscript was under a new pen name, &#x27;Mary le Bourne&#x27;, but has been published by the British Library as by E.C.R. Lorac. The back cover of the re-issued, &quot;Fire in the Thatch: A Devon Mystery&quot; (originally published in 1946), declares that, &quot;Her books have been almost entirely neglected since her death, but deserve rediscovery as fine examples of classic British crime fiction in its golden age.&quot; In August 2024, an English Heritage plaque was unveiled at Newbanks Cottage in Aughton, UK, the former residence of Rivett.

<doc id="1272925" wikidata="Q2578497" url="?curid=1272925" title="William Drayton">
<text>William Drayton (December 30, 1776May 24, 1846) was an American politician, banker, and writer who grew up in Charleston, South Carolina. He was the son of William Drayton Sr., who served as justice of the Province of East Florida (1765–1780).

Drayton served as a United States Representative to Congress (1825–1833). Following the Nullification Crisis, as a unionist Drayton decided to move his family to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1833 and lived there the rest of his life.

==Early life and education==
The son of William Drayton Sr. and his wife, William was born in St. Augustine in East Florida (then a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain), where his father served from 1765 to 1780 as the chief justice for the Province of East Florida. In 1780 the judge lost his position due to accusations of sympathy with rebels in the American Revolutionary War; he returned with his family to Charleston. He had bought property and plantations in Florida, including what became known as Drayton Island.

The Drayton sons were sent to England to complete their educations. Afterward, with his older brother Jacob, William studied law in Charleston. Both became lawyers.

==Marriage and family==
About 1804 William Drayton married Anna Gadsden (d. 1814), a cousin once removed. They had four children: 
*Emma Gadsden ( – 1840)
*Thomas Fenwick (1809–1891), became a Confederate Army general
*Percival (1812–1865), became a career US Naval officer
*William Sidney (b. – 1860), became a US Naval officer and shipping businessman

After Anna&#x27;s death, in 1817 Drayton married Maria Heyward. Two of their five children survived to adulthood. Maria Heyward Drayton was also close to her young stepchildren.: 
*William Heyward, became a lawyer in Philadelphia.
*Henry Edward, became a doctor in Philadelphia. The two younger Drayton brothers married the sisters Harriet and Sarah Coleman, respectively.

Thomas Drayton, a West Point graduate, stayed in South Carolina when the family moved north and bought a plantation at Hilton Head. He resigned from the US Army to join Confederate forces after secession. He and his brother Percival &quot;commanded opposing forces&quot; in the battle of Port Royal, South Carolina, when Union forces captured the forts.
==Career==

William Drayton served in the War of 1812, where he was commissioned as a colonel (a rank he used all his life). In a November 12, 1816, letter to president-elect James Monroe, Andrew Jackson recommended, unsuccessfully, that Drayton, a Federalist who had shown loyalty to the Madison administration and the union through his military service, be appointed Secretary of War to heal the breach between the Federalist Party, now largely moribund on the national level, and the Republicans. Colonel Drayton was elected in 1824 to represent South Carolina&#x27;s first district in the U.S. Congress, and served from 1825 to 1833 with repeated re-election.

A unionist during the nullification controversy, in 1833 he moved his family to Philadelphia. Two years later in 1835, he was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society. While a unionist, Drayton continued to support slavery. In Philadelphia he wrote and published &quot;The South Vindicated from the Treason and Fanaticism of the Abolitionists&quot; (1836), a pro-slavery tract. He briefly became the president of the defunct Second Bank of the United States in 1841.
Drayton died on May 24, 1846, in Philadelphia and was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery.

==Legacy and honors==
*His papers are held by the Historical Society of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
*The author Edgar Allan Poe dedicated his collection &quot;Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque&quot; (1840) to him.

<doc id="1272926" wikidata="Q442166" url="?curid=1272926" title="Lynne Frederick">
<text>Lynne Frederick (25 July 1954 – 27 April 1994) was an English actress and model. In a career spanning ten years, she made over thirty appearances in film and television productions. She often played the girl next door and performed in a range of genres, from contemporary science fiction to slasher horror, romantic dramas, classic westerns, and occasional comedies, although her greater successes were in period films and costume dramas.

In 1980, after the death of her husband, Peter Sellers, she came to national attention over the nature of his controversial will, in which she was listed as the primary beneficiary. She was publicly criticised, ridiculed and perceived as a gold digger by the press and public. Her career and reputation never recovered from the backlash and she was subsequently blacklisted by Hollywood. She lived out the remainder of her years in California, and kept a low profile until her death in 1994.

In the decades since her death, Frederick has steadily attracted a posthumous cult following for her collection of work in motion pictures and television. Some of her better-known performances include her roles in films such as &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; (1971), &quot;The Amazing Mr. Blunden&quot; (1972), &quot;Henry VIII and His Six Wives&quot; (1972), and &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; (1976). Other films of hers such as &quot;Vampire Circus&quot; (1971), &quot;Phase IV&quot; (1974), &quot;Four of the Apocalypse&quot; (1975), &quot;A Long Return&quot; (&quot;Largo retorno&quot;) (1975), and &quot;Schizo&quot; (1976) have all become underground hits or established a status as a cult film in their respective genres, contributing to the renewed interest in her life and career.

She was the first recipient of the award for Best New Coming Actress from the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; British Film Awards in 1973, for her performances in &quot;Henry VIII and His Six Wives&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Amazing Mr. Blunden&quot; (1972). She is one of only eight actresses, and the youngest, to hold this title.

==Early life==
Frederick was born in Hillingdon, Middlesex, to Andrew Frederick (1914–1983) and Iris C. Frederick (née Sullivan, 1928–2006). While she was very young, her father abandoned the family, and she was brought up by her mother and maternal grandmother, Cecilia. Lynne never knew or met her father, and had no personal relationships or connections with his side of the family. Although her mother was employed as a casting director for Thames Television, they often lived a frugal lifestyle. In her work, Iris gained a reputation for being a stern and imposing individual.

Frederick was brought up in Market Harborough in Leicestershire. She occasionally faced social stigma due to her parents&#x27; divorce. She attended Notting Hill and Ealing High School in London. Her original career choice was to become a schoolteacher of physics and mathematics.

==Career==

=== 1969–1974: Discovery and early roles ===
Frederick was discovered at the age of 15 by American actor and film director Cornel Wilde, who was a friend and colleague of her mother. Wilde had been looking for a young, unknown actress to star in his film adaptation of the best-selling post-apocalyptic science fiction novel &quot;The Death of Grass&quot; by John Christopher. Wilde first saw her when she came to work with her mother to pose for some test shots, and he immediately was smitten by her beauty, charisma, and bubbly personality. Despite her having no previous experience in theatre, films, or commercials, Wilde offered her the role without an audition.

When &quot;No Blade of Grass&quot; (1970) was released, the film received mixed reviews from critics. Notwithstanding the lukewarm reception of the film, Frederick became an overnight sensation, and her career quickly took off. Represented by the talent agency Hazel Malone Management, Frederick became a teen idol among the British public in the early 1970s, and was seen as the next Hayley Mills and Olivia Hussey. She was regularly featured in newspaper articles and fashion magazines as a model and cover girl. For a spread in the September 1971 edition of British &quot;Vogue&quot;, she was photographed by Patrick Lichfield. In addition, she appeared in several television commercials for products that included Camay soap. Frederick then signed a cosmetics contract with Mennen, and became a spokesmodel for Protein 21 shampoo, starring in nationwide print and television advertising campaigns. &quot;The Daily Express&quot; declared her &quot;The Face of 1971&quot;, hailing her as one of Britain&#x27;s more promising newcomers. In it, the copy read: &quot;She has that indefinable something. Whatever it is it all adds up to a delightful image of rare and innocent beauty...that face of Lynne Frederick will be seen in many more films…&quot;.

In 1971, she appeared in the biographical film &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; (1971), in which she played the Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia, second eldest daughter of Tsar Nicholas II. For the film&#x27;s press tour, she toured Europe with her three co-stars Ania Marson, Candace Glendenning, and Fiona Fullerton. That same year, she auditioned for the role of Alice in &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1972), but lost the role to her friend Fiona Fullerton. Frederick was also first runner-up for the role of Saint Clare of Assisi in the Franco Zeffirelli production of &quot;Brother Sun, Sister Moon&quot; (1972), which ultimately went to Judi Bowker.

Her best-known appearance was in 1972 when she played Catherine Howard, in &quot;Henry VIII and His Six Wives&quot;. Her next role was in the 1972 family film &quot;The Amazing Mr. Blunden&quot;; in 1973, she won the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; British Film Award for Best New Actress. She continued to work in film and television projects throughout 1973 and 1974. Some of the shows in which she appeared were &quot;Wessex Tales&quot;, &quot;Follyfoot&quot;, &quot;The Generation Game&quot;, and an adaptation of &quot;The Canterville Ghost&quot; where she first met David Niven, who became a lifelong friend.
Frederick&#x27;s most prominent television role came in 1974 when she appeared in three episodes of the critically acclaimed and Emmy-winning series &quot;The Pallisers&quot;. The series featured a huge cast of prominent and rising British actors, including Anthony Andrews, of whom she played the love interest.

===1975–1977: Adult stardom===
Frederick landed a role in the Spanish romance film &quot;A Long Return&quot; (&quot;Largo retorno&quot;, 1975), where she played her first grown-up character. She also appeared alongside Fabio Testi in &quot;Four of the Apocalypse&quot; as well as in the adventure film &quot;Cormack of the Mounties&quot;. She returned to playing a teenaged character in the Spanish film &quot;El Vicio Y La Virtud&quot; (1975).

Frederick began 1976 with an appearance in a then controversial episode of the BBC series &quot;Play for Today&quot;, titled &quot;The Other Woman&quot;, in which she played a sexually enigmatic girl who falls for a lesbian artist played by Jane Lapotaire. Later the same year, she delivered a critically acclaimed performance in the Oscar-nominated film &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; (1976). She followed that with a leading role in a Pete Walker slasher horror film &quot;Schizo&quot; (1976), a movie that became an underground hit in the horror film genre.

Along with Frederick&#x27;s rising mainstream success as an actress, her modelling career was also taking off. Shifting her style and image to that of a more sophisticated glamour girl, Frederick emerged as a movie sex symbol of the late 1970s. Her profile expanded to Japan, and she became a frequent face in the Japanese entertainment magazine &quot;Screen&quot;. She was featured as a celebrity centrefold pin-up, and made the cover three times in the space of eighteen months. Frederick was also listed in several press and editorial publications as one of photographer Terry Fincher&#x27;s muses.

By this point in her career, Frederick was earning over £4,000 (equivalent to £ in ) per week for her film work alone. She was also being represented by A-list Hollywood agent Dennis Selinger, who represented internationally successful British actors such as Vanessa Redgrave, Michael Caine, and Sean Connery. Selinger was preparing Frederick for worldwide crossover stardom in mainstream film and television productions. In addition, Frederick had now reached the point where she no longer had to audition for roles, and she was being sent stacks of scripts and lucrative film offers.

===1978–1980: Career decline and blacklisting===
Following her marriage to Peter Sellers in 1977, Frederick&#x27;s career stalled for over a year as Sellers forced her to turn down all the acting offers she was receiving in order to tend him through poor health, including looking after him on the sets of his films. She attempted to make a career comeback in 1978, but the year-long absence had cost Frederick her burgeoning stardom.

Frederick campaigned and auditioned for several films. The role that she most desired, and spent a great deal of time lobbying for, was the leading role of Meggie Cleary in &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot;. Despite her lengthy and accomplished acting résumé, the producers selected Rachel Ward. Other roles she campaigned for included Cosette in the 1978 television adaptation of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1978), and Anne Sullivan in the television remake of &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; (1979), neither of which she received. She made her final onscreen appearance with Sellers in the 1979 remake of &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;, which was a box-office and critical flop. Her final credit was as an executive producer on &quot;The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu&quot; (1980), Sellers&#x27; last film.

Following Sellers&#x27; death, his controversial will, the ongoing feuds with her stepchildren, and her short marriage to David Frost, Frederick became a figure of hate and ridicule in the press and other media. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; featured her in a list of disgraced public figures of 1980. Labelled as a &quot;gold digger&quot; and &quot;professional wife&quot;, she was shunned and blacklisted from the film industry. 

==Personal life==

===Marriages===
Frederick&#x27;s first marriage at age 22 was to Peter Sellers. They met at a dinner party in March 1976 when she was 21 and Sellers was 50, after Frederick had finished making &quot;Schizo&quot; (1976). Sellers initially proposed to her two days after their first meeting, but she turned him down. They courted for a year, he proposed to her again, and they eloped to Paris on 18 February 1977.

Writer Stephen Bach said of their relationship: &quot;I noticed as he [Peter Sellers] rose, that not once in the long talkative afternoon had he let go of Lynne&#x27;s hand, nor had she moved away. She transfused him simultaneously with calm and energy, and the hand he clung to was less a hand than a lifeline&quot;. He also added that he believed that Lynne had a unique ability to calm Sellers&#x27; manic moods; &quot;the atmosphere was uneasy only until Lynne Frederick came into the room, exuding an aura of calm that somehow enveloped us all like an Alpine fragrance. She was only in her mid-twenties, but instantly observable as the mature center around which the household revolved, an emotional anchor that looked like a daffodil&quot;. David Niven, who was a friend to both Sellers and Frederick, had credited Peter&#x27;s happiness to Lynne being a devoted and loving wife.

Their marriage declined as Sellers&#x27; health deteriorated. He forced Frederick to forfeit her growing and lucrative acting career to care for him. Sellers&#x27;s biographer Ed Sikov claimed that Frederick was offered a lucrative five-month job in Moscow where she was to lead a big-budgeted television miniseries, but Sellers insisted she should turn it down so that he would not be left alone.

The tension between them increased after the box-office and critical failure of &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1979), followed by negative tabloid reports of rumours of drug use, infidelity, domestic abuse, and other alleged conflicts. Despite their struggles, Frederick stood by Sellers and cared for him as his health continued to decline and he became more temperamental. Although they separated a number of times, they always came back together.

Sellers was in the process of excluding her from his will, according to a letter he wrote just before he died of a heart attack on 24 July 1980, the day before her 26th birthday. The planned changes to the will not having been finalised, she inherited almost his entire estate, worth an estimated £4.5 million (equivalent to £ million in ), and his children received £800 each (£ in ). Despite appeals from a number of Sellers&#x27;s friends to make a fair settlement to the children, Frederick allegedly refused to give her stepchildren anything due to their rocky relationship with her and Peter. After Sellers&#x27;s death, her stepson Michael Sellers published &quot;P.S. I Love You: An Intimate Portrait of Peter Sellers&quot;, an exposé memoir concerning his relationship with his father. In the book, he accused Frederick of being a deceitful, cunning and narcissistic fraud who only married his father for his money. He also alleged that Frederick had cheated his sisters and him out of their inheritance by intentionally manipulating their father to alter the will in her favour. These accusations led to the press vilifying and labelling her as a &quot;gold digger&quot;.

She briefly married David Frost (on 25 January 1981). Her supposed eagerness to remarry so quickly after Sellers&#x27;s death caused a loss of reputation in the public eye, and was one of the major factors in her blacklisting. Before their marriage, Frederick had known Frost for several years, and they were occasional lovers in between relationships. Frederick divorced Frost after 17 months. During the course of their marriage, she suffered a miscarriage in March 1982.

In December 1982, she married U.S. cardiologist Barry Unger with whom she had her only child. Frederick and Barry divorced in 1991.

===Later life===
After losing her acting career, Frederick lived a private and reclusive life. When she divorced Frost, she faced public embarrassment when it was reported that she became intoxicated at a formal restaurant. Following this incident, she fled from England to California and never returned to her homeland. In later years, she was known for being fiercely private. Subsequently, she refused to give interviews and distanced herself from the celebrity lifestyle.

After her divorce from Barry Unger, Frederick lived in a Los Angeles mansion that had previously been owned by the actor Gary Cooper. She struggled with alcoholism, epileptic seizures, and clinical depression. There were also rumours of nervous breakdowns and suicide attempts. Despite participating in numerous recovery treatments at hospitals and clinics, she was unable to rebuild her health. Weary after her years of public scorn and deteriorating conditions, she cloistered herself in her home for days at a time. Her mother Iris moved from England to California to live with Frederick to help care for her and her daughter, Cassie.

Frederick was the sole manager of Sellers&#x27; estate. She took such pride in being Sellers&#x27; wife that she legally changed her last name to Sellers. It has been reported that when she took part in group therapy sessions, she introduced herself as &quot;Lynne Sellers, the wife of Peter Sellers&quot;.

===Relationships===
Frederick, who never met her biological father, regarded actor David Niven as her substitute father. They first met while filming the television film adaptation of &quot;The Canterville Ghost&quot; (1974). They remained close friends over the years until Niven&#x27;s death in 1983, which occurred just eight weeks after the birth of her daughter.

As a child, Lynne was very close to her mother Iris and grandmother Cecilia. Her relationship with her mother suffered major damage after she married Peter Sellers in 1977. Five days after the wedding, Iris spoke out against the marriage in an interview with the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;:
&quot;Time will tell, but I think Lynne has made a terrible mistake. I hope it will work for her sake. He [Peter Sellers] is a brilliant man, but not the kind of son in law I would have chosen. I wasn&#x27;t invited to the ceremony, but that isn&#x27;t surprising. When I heard it was taking place, I said: &#x27;The sooner it happens, the sooner it will be over&#x27;. Somehow, in view of Sellers&#x27;s previous record with the ladies who have gone before, I think this marriage may not last too long.&quot;
Feeling hurt and betrayed by this interview, Lynne did not see or speak to her mother again for the duration of her marriage to Sellers. When asked about cutting ties with her daughter, Iris said: &quot;I have my own life to live. Of course I still love her. I&#x27;ve cried for her and I miss her a great deal. Lynne is right when she says we were terribly close and it hurts when I see her using the press to make me look the guilty party in all this.&quot;

During the period when Iris was not in communication with Lynne, she continued to publicly blast her daughter&#x27;s marriage in the press.
&quot;My own marriage ended unhappily when Lynne was two. I tried to compensate for her having no father by devoting all the time I wasn&#x27;t working to her. Perhaps if I had married again she wouldn&#x27;t gone on choosing men twice her age as boyfriends – looking for a father figure I suppose. She met Peter Sellers on the rebound from David Frost. I thought &#x27;here we go again&#x27; but I didn&#x27;t want to be the one to put it down without giving it a chance. I know I said things later about marital track record not being very good, but at the time I went along with it wondering how long it would be before I was having to give him the &#x27;Lynne regrets&#x27; speech. Now I ask you! What mother can be expected to approve of the marriage of her daughter to such a man? My heart bled for her. To me their marriage is doomed right from the start. I hope and pray they&#x27;ll prove me wrong. God knows I want Lynne to be happy. But this time I must let her sort it out for herself. She must understand that I am staying clear for her sake even though it hurts me to do so.&quot;
After Sellers&#x27; death in 1980, Frederick reconciled with her mother. Despite its rekindling, their relationship was never the same again.

In 1972, while in her late teens, Frederick became involved with Curzon House Club casino owner Julian Posner, who like Sellers was 30 years her senior. They had an on-and-off relationship for about three years until 1975, while Frederick&#x27;s acting career continued to blossom. During their off times, Frederick often discreetly engaged in affairs with her friend and future husband David Frost.

Frederick&#x27;s relationship with her former stepchildren (Michael Sellers, Sarah Sellers, and Victoria Sellers) was, like Peter&#x27;s relationship with them, distant and often strained. When Lynne began her relationship with Peter, she made efforts to establish a friendly connection with them. Sarah recalled of Lynne: &quot;she seemed quite nice to begin with. I actually told dad that I thought she was a bit stupid. But she came across as very bubbly, friendly, warm and interested. But once they got married things definitely changed&quot;. Michael Sellers wrote of Frederick in his exposé memoir: &quot;my first impression of Lynne didn&#x27;t do much to alter my views. She was not exactly my idea of sweetness and light. It didn&#x27;t concern me that she lacked the good looks of dad&#x27;s past wives and girlfriends, but those innocent eyes, certainly her strongest feature, didn&#x27;t deceive me&quot;. Michael Sellers also bluntly acknowledged his intentional hostility and lack of respect towards Lynne when they first met: &quot;I&#x27;m afraid we weren&#x27;t very kind in our judgement of Lynne. Sarah thought she wasn&#x27;t too bright. But our views didn&#x27;t really count for much. Because whatever our opinions, they would be of purely academic interest&quot;. Months after Frederick&#x27;s death in 1994, Victoria said &quot;I feel now that she&#x27;s in hell – I don&#x27;t know but that makes me feel better.&quot;

One of Frederick&#x27;s close friends was Mauritian actress Françoise Pascal. The two first met when they co-starred on a 1972 episode of the television anthology series &quot;BBC Play of the Month&quot;, and they quickly became &quot;firm friends&quot;. Pascal recalled that they remained friends for several years before regretfully losing touch after Frederick married Sellers in 1977. In April 2020, a few weeks before the 26th anniversary of Frederick&#x27;s death, Pascal tweeted a photo of herself and Frederick, with the caption &quot;I think of her very often! Always had that fresh baby face! RIP Lynne! Xxx&quot;.

In 2018, Judy Matheson revealed that she had worked with Frederick in the early 1970s. They were slated to appear in a film together that was to be shot in the Netherlands, with John Hamil, Robert Coleby, and Nina Francis. Because Frederick was young and a relative newcomer to filmmaking at the time, Matheson (who was a few years older and had industry experience) was asked to be Lynne&#x27;s chaperone for the trip (as Lynne&#x27;s mother was unavailable). They spent about three weeks lodged together in a hotel room before production on the film was prematurely closed due to financial withdrawals. Matheson stated that she enjoyed Frederick&#x27;s company, and that they managed to have fun together despite the production difficulties. After returning to Great Britain, they corresponded for a while before gradually losing touch with each other.

During production of &quot;Four of the Apocalypse&quot; (1975), she was rumoured to have had a brief romance with her co-star Fabio Testi (who was having trouble in his relationship with actress Ursula Andress at the time), which was also during a time when Frederick was having trouble in her own relationship with Julian Posner. Naturally, this helped Testi and Frederick with their chemistry in the movie, and they were paired again for the film &quot;Cormack of the Mounties&quot; (1975). There has been much speculation about such a romance between Testi and Frederick, but it has not been confirmed.

In her 2014 memoir &quot;I Said Yes to Everything&quot;, Lee Grant claimed that during production of the film &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; (1976) Frederick, then aged 21, engaged in an affair with Sam Wanamaker, who was 35 years Frederick&#x27;s senior and married to Charlotte Holland at the time. Grant also stated that she witnessed all the men on set, including the film&#x27;s director Stuart Rosenberg, make salacious passes at Frederick, all of which she rejected.

Julie Andrews stated in her 2019 autobiography &quot;Home Work: A Memoir of My Hollywood Years&quot; that she suspected her husband Blake Edwards was having an affair with Lynne (who was married to Sellers at the time) during production of &quot;Revenge of the Pink Panther&quot; (1978). When Andrews confronted Blake about the &quot;flirtations&quot; between him and Frederick, Julie asked him point-blank which he preferred: staying married or continuing this flirtation. After this confrontation, Blake apparently ceased any kind of flirtation with Frederick. She later had a falling-out with Edwards and Andrews after successfully suing them for their involvement with the film &quot;Trail of the Pink Panther&quot; (1982), claiming that it insulted Sellers&#x27; memory.

===Political views and beliefs===
In a 1975 interview with &quot;Men Only&quot;, Frederick stated that she &quot;partially agreed&quot; with Women&#x27;s Lib. Stating &quot;I agree with the fact that women should have equal rights&quot;, she added that she also believed in some old-fashioned gender roles. &quot;I agree that there are certain things that men are designed to do; just as there are things women are designed to do. I think women are just as capable of ruling people and looking after our affairs as men are. Sometimes possibly better because women have a level of sensibility and sensitivity as well, which possibly men don&#x27;t sometimes.&quot;

Although not gay herself, Frederick was known for being a blunt and outspoken advocate for same-sex relationships and LGBT rights during a time when it was considered highly taboo. Following her appearance on a controversial episode of the television series &quot;Play for Today&quot;, where she played a sexually fluid character and shared an onscreen kiss with her female co-star Jane Lapotaire, she said &quot;with homosexuality and lesbianism, I just don&#x27;t think you can put a ban on it. I don&#x27;t think you can say it&#x27;s wrong. I think people should live how they want to live. I don&#x27;t think it should be illegal.&quot;

Frederick grew up as a Methodist. In a 1975 interview, she expressed some agnostic views when she was asked about a progressive Catholic priest&#x27;s response to the pope&#x27;s declaring premarital sex a sin. &quot;I really agree with the other priests that it should have never been issued. I think that does put the Church back; I really do. I can say it because I&#x27;m not particularly religious. But I think people who are religious, I hope they would feel that it&#x27;s not a step forward. I think premarital sex is a good idea. I think the worst thing that could possibly happen is to not have sex before you get married, then get married and find out it&#x27;s dreadful.&quot; After Peter Sellers died, she went to visit spiritualist and psychic medium Doris Collins. When asked if she believed in life after death, she replied &quot;I&#x27;ve always believed that death was not the end&quot;. Frederick later suggested in an interview that she still retained her Methodist faith: &quot;I never touch hard liquor. I suppose wine is okay for a good Methodist like me&quot;.

===Philanthropy===
Following the death of her first husband Peter Sellers, she became involved in donating to various heart charities.

In November 1980, she bought and donated an echocardiograph (valued at £12,400) to the Middlesex Hospital in London where Sellers died of a heart attack. Frederick stated &quot;I wanted to try and reciprocate in some way to the enormous love and care which staff here showed my husband&quot;.

After her own death in 1994, she left individual sums of $250,000 to the British Heart Foundation and the Middlesex Hospital in London as tribute to Sellers. As a sign of gratitude, the Middlesex Hospital hung a plaque thanking both Sellers and Frederick for their generous contributions.

===&quot;Trail of the Pink Panther&quot; (1982) lawsuit===
Shortly after the release of &quot;Trail of the Pink Panther&quot; (1982), Frederick filed suit against MGM, United Artists, and film director Blake Edwards for $3 million in damages and to block the film&#x27;s distribution. She claimed that the film tarnished Peter Sellers&#x27; reputation and that it was made without authorisation from his estate, which she controlled.

At the High Court in London, the defence argued that the film was meant to be a tribute to Sellers, but Frederick stated &quot;It was an appalling film: Not a tribute to my husband but an insult to his memory&quot;. Her chief objection was that her late husband had specifically prohibited the use of outtakes from earlier Pink Panther films in his lifetime, and that his estate should have had the right to control the use of outtakes after his death. The idea of using outtakes in future Pink Panther films was first presented in Sellers&#x27; lifetime when Edwards had shot and edited a three-hour version of &quot;The Pink Panther Strikes Again&quot; (1976). However, United Artists objected to this long version, and the film was trimmed from three hours to an hour and a half.

After Sellers&#x27; death in 1980, United Artists, wanting to cash in on the continuation of the series, elected Edwards to construct a new film from outtakes and deleted scenes from the five previous &quot;Pink Panther&quot; movies featuring Sellers. A handful of new material involving other actors was specially filmed for inclusion. Some of the older material dated as far back as 1963. The lack of continuity was evident in many scenes, and was mocked by film critics.

In 1985, Judge Charles Hobhouse ruled in favour of Frederick, awarding her $1 million, but dismissed her request to ban the film. Frederick stated &quot;I hope this proves that I&#x27;m not a gold digger! I&#x27;ve risked my entire fortune and the financial future of my daughter to protect Peter&#x27;s reputation.&quot; After the lawsuit Frederick continued to guard Sellers&#x27; films.

==Death==
On 27 April 1994, Frederick was found dead by her mother in her West Los Angeles home, aged 39. Foul play and suicide were ruled out, and an autopsy failed to determine the cause of death. Her remains were cremated at Golders Green Crematorium in London, and her ashes were interred with those of Peter Sellers.

In a 1995 interview with &quot;Hello!&quot;, her mother Iris claimed that Lynne died from natural causes which was brought on by a seizure in her sleep. She also denied accusations that her daughter had a drug or alcohol problem.
&quot;There is absolutely no truth in any of the stories I have read about Lynne&#x27;s death. I never saw Lynne taking cocaine. She liked a glass of wine, but so do most people and she was no more an alcoholic than the next person. The autopsy report was quite clear, her death was by natural causes. Lynne died of a seizure in her sleep. For the record, the coroner found no evidence that Lynne had been taking drugs.&quot;

==Legacy==
In the years after her death, Frederick&#x27;s legacy remained poisoned. In the 1995 revision of his 1994 book &quot;The Life and Death of Peter Sellers&quot;, Roger Lewis claimed that &quot;there is yet to find a single person to say a good thing about Lynne&quot;. British journalist Nigel Dempster had a profound dislike for Frederick and referred to her as an &quot;avaricious and cunning man-eater&quot;. Other people who have voiced unfavorable views of Frederick include Spike Milligan, Britt Ekland, Roger Moore, and Wendy Richard.

She received minimal attention in the 2004 film adaptation of Lewis&#x27;s book where she was portrayed by British actress Emilia Fox. All scenes featuring Fox&#x27;s portrayal of Frederick were deleted from the final cut of the film, but included in the supplemental features of the film&#x27;s DVD release. On portraying Frederick, Fox stated &quot;I had thought very carefully about playing Lynne. I wanted to represent her in a way that I thought was fair – which was a very young girl being taken up in this world of laughter and light, and then finding out the reality. Peter Sellers was completely obsessed by work, and it&#x27;s very difficult to live with someone like that.&quot;

Over time, views toward Frederick&#x27;s image gradually shifted, and she soon gained a cult following through her films, and has been described as one of the most promising, talented, and beautiful young British actresses of the 1970s. Many credit the negative events in her life (the loss of her acting career, blacklisting in Hollywood, and untimely death) to her marriage to Sellers. Even Roger Lewis, who was blunt about his disdain for Frederick, admitted that &quot;of all of Sellers&#x27;s wives, Lynne Frederick was the most poorly treated&quot;. One of the early people to advocate for Frederick was American author Ed Sikov in the 2002 book &quot;Mr. Strangelove: A Biography of Peter Sellers&quot;: &quot;Lynne Frederick deserves a bit of compassion herself in retrospect. It was the helpless Peter she nursed, the dependent and infantile creature of impulse and consequent contradiction. Patiently she ministered him&quot;. Other people who have defended or come forward with positive recollections of Frederick over the years include Judy Matheson, Françoise Pascal, John Moulder-Brown, Mark Burns, Fabio Testi, Malcolm McDowell, and Graham Crowden.

There has been continued belief that Frederick would have achieved greater career success had it not been for her marriage to Sellers and untimely death. It had been speculated that she had the potential to attain stardom equivalent to that of Helen Mirren, Judi Dench, and Julie Walters.

In 1982, Frederick&#x27;s screen appearance as Catherine Howard from the film &quot;Henry VIII and His Six Wives&quot; (1972) was used on the cover art for the 1982 novel &quot;The Dark Rose&quot; by Cynthia Harrod-Eagles.

For her work in horror films, Frederick has garnered significant popularity as a scream queen. In 2014, her image from the film poster of &quot;Schizo&quot; (1976) was featured in a montage for the cover of the publication &quot;X-CERT 2: The British Independent Horror Film: 1971–1983&quot; by John Hamilton.

&quot;The Times&quot; obituary for Frederick called her the &quot;Olivia Hussey of her day&quot;.

<doc id="1272937" wikidata="Q6287091" url="?curid=1272937" title="Joseph Sobran">
<text>Michael Joseph Sobran Jr. (; February 23, 1946 – September 30, 2010), also known as M. J. Sobran, was an American paleoconservative journalist and syndicated columnist. He wrote for the &quot;National Review&quot; magazine from 1972 to 1993.

In his columns, Sobran was moralistic, opposed to big government, and an isolationist critic of U.S. foreign policy. When he fired Sobran from his longtime job at &quot;National Review&quot; in 1993, publisher William F. Buckley Jr. termed some of Sobran&#x27;s writings &quot;contextually anti-semitic&quot;. In the early 2000s, Sobran was a speaker for the Holocaust denial group Institute for Historical Review.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Michael Joseph Sobran Jr. was born in Ypsilanti, Michigan, on February 23, 1946, to Doris (née Prevost, 1924–1997), a department store clerk, and Michael Joseph Sobran (1916–1994), an autoworker. His paternal grandparents were from Austria-Hungary, and his mother was of English, French-Canadian and Irish ancestry. Sobran was raised in a Roman Catholic family.

Sobran graduated from Eastern Michigan University in 1969 with a Bachelor of Arts in English. He studied for a Master of English degree with a concentration on Shakespearean studies. In the late 1960s, Sobran lectured on Shakespeare and English on a fellowship with Eastern Michigan.

=== Columnist ===
In 1972, while at Eastern Michigan, Sobran published rebuttals of criticisms from other faculty of an upcoming campus visit by William F. Buckley Jr., publisher of the &quot;National Review&quot; and a prominent conservative. After reading Sobran&#x27;s comments, Buckley hired him as a columnist at the &quot;National Review&quot;. After three years, Buckley promoted Sobran to senior editor. They had a long friendship. 

Aside from his work at &quot;National Review,&quot; Sobran spent 21 years as a commentator on the CBS Radio &quot;Spectrum&quot; program series. He was a syndicated columnist, first with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and later with the Universal Press Syndicate. From 1988 to 2007, he wrote the column &quot;Washington Watch&quot; for the traditionalist lay Catholic weekly &quot;The Wanderer&quot;. He also wrote a monthly column for the traditionalist &quot;Catholic Family News&quot; (a publication considered anti-Semitic by the Southern Poverty Law Center) and the &quot;Bare Bodkin&quot; column for &quot;Chronicles&quot; magazine. He was a media fellow of the Mises Institute.

=== Firing from &quot;National Review&quot; ===
In 1993, in a column in &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, Sobran attacked Buckley for his support of the 1991 Gulf War. Already unhappy with Sobran&#x27;s columns on Israel and anti-Semitism, Buckley was reportedly angered that Sobran had used information from their private conversations and decided to fire him as senior editor. Buckley said he considered some of Sobran&#x27;s columns to be &quot;... contextually anti-Semitic. By this I mean that if he had been talking, let us say, about the lobbying interests of the Arabs or of the Chinese, he would not have raised eyebrows as an anti-Arab or an anti-Chinese&quot;. In response to his firing, Sobran claimed that Buckley told him to &quot;stop antagonizing the Zionist crowd&quot; and accused him of libel and moral incapacitation. In his own assessment, Columnist Norman Podhoretz wrote that Sobran&#x27;s columns were &quot;anti-Semitic in themselves, and not merely &#x27;contextually. 

In 1994, he founded &quot;Sobran’s: The Real News of the Month&quot;, a newsletter that published until 2007. Sobran was named the Constitution Party&#x27;s vice presidential nominee in 2000, but withdrew later that year due to scheduling conflicts. 

=== Institute for Historical Review ===
In 2001, Pat Buchanan offered Sobran a column in Buchanan&#x27;s new magazine &quot;The American Conservative&quot;. (After Sobran&#x27;s death, Buchanan called him &quot;perhaps the finest columnist of our generation&quot;.) However, the magazine&#x27;s editor, Scott McConnell, withdrew the offer when Sobran refused to cancel his appearance before the Institute for Historical Review, a leading Holocaust-denying group.

In 2001 and 2003, Sobran spoke at conferences organized by David Irving and shared the podium with Paul Fromm, Charles D. Provan, and Mark Weber, director of the Institute for Historical Review. In 2002, he spoke at the Institute for Historical Review&#x27;s annual conference. Referring to Sobran&#x27;s appearance at the conferences, historian Deborah Lipstadt wrote: &quot;Mr. Sobran may not have been an unequivocal [Holocaust] denier, but he gave support and comfort to the worst of them&quot;. Writing in &quot;National Review&quot;, Matthew Scully said: &quot;His appearance before that sorry outfit a few years ago [...] remains impossible to explain, at least if you&#x27;re trying to absolve him&quot;.

In the 2008 presidential election, Sobran endorsed Constitution Party candidate Chuck Baldwin.

=== Death and legacy ===
Sobran was twice married and divorced. He had four children. Sobran died in a nursing home in Fairfax, Virginia, on September 30, 2010, of kidney failure due to diabetes. 

== Views ==

=== Philosophy ===
Throughout much of his career, Sobran identified as a paleoconservative like his colleagues Samuel T. Francis, Pat Buchanan, and Peter Gemma. He claimed to support a strict interpretation of the United States Constitution. He asserted that the Tenth Amendment meant that almost every federal government act since the Civil War had been illegal. In 2002, Sobran announced his philosophical and political shift to libertarianism (paleolibertarian anarcho-capitalism), citing inspiration by theorists Murray Rothbard and Hans-Hermann Hoppe. He referred to himself as a &quot;theo-anarchist&quot;.

Sobran asserted in the neo-Confederate &quot;Southern Partisan&quot; magazine that Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s dream had become an &quot;American nightmare&quot; because civil rights had encouraged, in Sobran&#x27;s words, &quot;black thugs&quot;.

=== Catholic teachings ===
Sobran said Catholic teachings were consistent with his opposition to abortion and the Iraq War. Asked to summarize his views, Sobran said once, &quot;I won&#x27;t be satisfied until the Church resumes burning for heresy&quot; — a remark that Buchanan&#x27;s biographer Timothy Stanley described as &quot;funny, offensive and honest&quot;.

=== Jews and Israel ===
Sobran frequently used his columns to criticize Israel, the Holocaust and Zionism. In one column, Sobran wrote that &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;really ought to change its name to &quot;Holocaust Update&quot;. In a 1992 column, he complained of &quot;a more or less official national obsession with a tiny, faraway socialist ethnocracy&quot;, meaning Israel. Sobran argued that the 9/11 attacks were a result of the United States government&#x27;s policies in the Middle East. He claimed those policies are formed by the Jewish lobby.

In 2002, Sobran wrote, &quot;My chief offense, it appears, has been to insist that the state of Israel has been a costly and treacherous ‘ally’ to the United States. As of last Sept. 11, I should think that is undeniable. But I have yet to receive a single apology for having been correct.&quot; Sobran said he lacked the &quot;scholarly competence&quot; to be a Holocaust denier. He also claimed that the official number of Holocaust victims was inaccurate and that Nazi Germany was not intent on racial extermination. He said his attitude was not anti-Semitism but &quot;more like counter-Semitism&quot;.

<text>A thymiaterion (from Ancient Greek: θυμιατήριον from θυμιάειν &quot;thymiaein&quot; &quot;to smoke&quot;; plural &quot;thymiateria&quot;) is a type of censer or incense burner, used in the Mediterranean region since antiquity for spiritual and religious purposes and especially in religious ceremonies.

The term is used not only for the censers of ancient Greece, from where the term comes, but also to describe the censers of other peoples of the ancient world, such as the Phoenicians and Etruscans.

Thymiateria could take a wide variety of forms, ranging from simple earthenware pots to elaborate carved, moulded or cast items made from clay or bronze.

Various types of thymiateria are still used in the Greek Orthodox rituals in churches, homes, cemeteries etc. They are commonly known also as &quot;livanisteria&quot; (from the w. &quot;Livanos&quot;, incense).

<text>Carpenter Body Works (typically referred to simply as Carpenter) is a defunct American bus manufacturer. Founded in 1918 in Mitchell, Indiana, the company produced a variety of vehicles, with the majority of production consisting of yellow school buses for the United States and Canada.

Remaining a family-owned company into the late 1980s, Carpenter entered bankruptcy at the end of 1989 and was forced to reorganize to survive. In 1995, the company relocated to the former Wayne Corporation facilities in Richmond, Indiana; in 1996, the company rebranded its product line as &quot;Crown by Carpenter&quot;. In 1998, Carpenter was acquired by specialty vehicle manufacturer Spartan Motors.

In early 2001, Carpenter ended vehicle production, as its market share declined further.

==History==

===Foundation===
Carpenter traces its roots to 1918, in Mitchell, Indiana. Local blacksmith Ralph H. Carpenter established his own blacksmith works; at the time, part of the business involved building and repairing horse-drawn wagons. At the time, in many rural areas, these were still adapted to carry people simply with the addition of wooden benches. Inspired by the merger of two local school systems in the area near Mitchell, in 1922, Carpenter shifted from repair to construction of new bodies, constructing his first wooden-bodied &quot;kid hack&quot;. By the mid-1920s, motorized truck chassis formed the basis of all vehicle bodies. Although still constructed primarily of wood, the new bus bodies were now reinforced by steel in the exterior and framing.

In 1935, the combination of wood and metal construction was replaced by a body built solely of steel; the roof panels were welded together instead of riveted, forming a single panel. At the same time, the company debuted an early form of the school bus stop arm, though in a much different form: instead of a stop sign, the company used a clenched fist with a red-painted index finger that was propped out from the side of the bus. In 1937, Ralph Carpenter reincorporated his business as Carpenter Body Works, expanding into a larger factory in Mitchell in 1939.

In 1939, Ralph Carpenter attended a New York conference organized by rural education professor Dr. Frank W. Cyr, who sought to develop uniform design standards for school bus manufacturers; the event led to the birth of school bus yellow. Several of Carpenter&#x27;s ideas were adopted, including shatterproof safety glass, steel seat frames, and a fold-out stop sign.

In 1941, the company became one of the first publicly owned bus manufacturers. During the World War II moratorium on private-sector vehicle manufacturing, Carpenter became a bus supplier for the US Army and US Navy, becoming a source of buses for military training facilities across the United States.

===1950s–1980: Reconstruction and expansion===

In May 1947, the Carpenter factory in Mitchell, Indiana, was heavily damaged by a fire in the paint shop.

In 1954, Carpenter produced its first transit-style &quot;forward-control&quot; bus. Similar to designs from Blue Bird and Wayne, the company used Marmon-Herrington as its chassis supplier. As with other manufacturers, Carpenter conventional-style buses in the early 1950s were available on a variety of chassis, including Chevrolet/GMC, Ford, Dodge, International Harvester, Mack, REO, Diamond T, Studebaker, and White.

In March 1956, the Carpenter factory was again struck by fire, starting on the body-fitment station. Causing nearly $750,000 in damage, much of the factory was destroyed, except for the warehouse, upholstery shop, and paint shop; approximately two dozen buses were driven away from the fire to safety. With the help of factory workers, the factory was rebuilt and expanded in just 89 days. During the reconstruction, some workers worked without pay until later compensated.

Following the 1963 death of Ralph Carpenter at age 85, leadership of the company transferred to his son-in-law John A. Foddrill.

To the end of the 1960s, Carpenter continued to produce its school bus product line as it had since the 1920s: every vehicle was essentially built one at time without an assembly line and essentially to order. Although one of the larger school bus manufacturers, Carpenter allowed for a great deal of specialization and available options for a purchaser.

In 1969, Carpenter became one of the first manufacturers to offer a downsized school bus (25-30 passengers) for smaller-scale operators. Based on the General Motors P-chassis, the Carpenter Cadet CV utilized the roof and the body of the conventional-body Carpenter from the entry door rearward. From the drivers&#x27; seat forward, the Cadet was designed similar to the GM &quot;stepvan&quot;. The Cadet would spawn a number of similar designs from other manufacturers, remaining in production for 29 years.

In 1970, Carpenter upgraded its transit-style school buses with the introduction of the Corsair; the Marmon-Herrington chassis was replaced by a Hendrickson chassis. In addition, a distinguishing feature of the Corsair was its wraparound curved &quot;fishbowl&quot; windshield. Along with the forward-control Corsair, an all-new rear-engine model made its debut.

In 1970, parts of the factory were expanded further; under a company objective, management sought to source nearly all materials for the construction within Indiana (only carpet had to be sourced out of state)

During much of 1978, production at the Mitchell, Indiana facility was halted by a six-month long labor strike lasting from February to August.

===1981–90: Financial decline===

As the 1980s began, a critical factor affecting school bus manufacturing was declining student populations; the baby boomer generation that had attended schools for the past 25 years were now on the verge of all completing their secondary education. Overcapacity and lowered demand in the bus manufacturing industry was coupled with the unstable economy of the time. The company unsuccessfully attempted to diversify into the small transit bus market.

In 1981, Carpenter made its first move in expanding beyond its Mitchell, Indiana home. After securing over $1 million in loans, the company opened a machine shop in North Vernon, Indiana. In addition, in moving into the mass-transit market, Carpenter introduced the CBW range. A rear-engine mass-transit bus designed in 30 and 35-feet lengths, large orders for the CBW were received from the Southern California Rapid Transit District (Los Angeles), the Chicago Transit Authority and New Orleans RTA.

In 1983, the forward-control version of the Corsair was replaced by a far more modern Cavalier. Based on an International Harvester chassis, the Cavalier improved driver usability and ergonomics over its predecessor. As it was sold in limited numbers, the rear-engine Corsair remained in production.

In 1984, the Carpenter conventional (now called the Classic) received its most extensive updates in nearly 20 years. After fewer than 150 buses were sold, sales of the CBW mass-transit line were discontinued in that year.

In 1985, the company opened a chassis-manufacturing plant in Seymour, Indiana, although the plant would close within a year. In an expansion of the model line, Carpenter became one of the last major manufacturers (alongside Ward/AmTran) to introduce a school bus based on a cutaway van as it introduced the Clipper in 1985. The Clipper was a dual rear-wheel design sold primarily on a Chevrolet/GMC chassis.

In 1988, due to escalating costs, the North Vernon machine shop was closed down.

In 1989, the Cavalier was replaced by the Counselor, as the International Harvester chassis was replaced by a GMC chassis. For the last time, the rear-engine Corsair was produced.

In December 1989, with nearly $14 million in unpaid debt, Carpenter Body Works was forced to declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In 1990, Indianapolis-based businessman Dr. Beurt SerVaas formed a holding company (CBW, Inc) to acquire Carpenter Body Works. Although the company board (consisting primarily of the Foddrill family and supporters) were in favor of the acquisition, the United Auto Workers labor force rejected the proposal, due to massive labor concessions; it would take two weeks for an agreement to take place.

=== 1991–2001: Struggle for identity ===
As it entered the 1990s, Carpenter was no longer a family-owned company, transitioning into the leadership formed by Dr. SerVaas. During the acquisition, the product line was called &quot;the Cadillac of school buses&quot;; as such, the company had high hopes for the future based on its moves early in the 1990s.

In May 1991, Carpenter purchased the tooling, product rights, and intellectual property of Crown Coach, a California-based manufacturer that had closed its doors two months prior. The original intent of the company was to restart production of the Crown Supercoach Series II under the Carpenter name, but the complexity of its unibody construction proved too expensive for mass production (the purchase price of the original Series II was over $125,000 in 1990, nearly twice as high as a competitive Blue Bird or Thomas). Introduced in 1989, the Series II had been the most updated bus from Crown Coach in 40 years. While Carpenter would have to shelve the Supercoach II as a whole, it did not go unnoticed. A number of elements were carried over for the bus that was brought to market in its place.

Introduced for 1992, the Carpenter Coach RE (Rear Engine) also served as the replacement for the long-running Corsair. Far more modern than its predecessor, the Coach utilized a chassis manufactured by the Crane Carrier Company of Tulsa, OK and was equipped with a Detroit Diesel 6v92 coupled with an Allison transmission. A minor change was added as the Clipper was renamed the Classmate.

In 1994, Carpenter leased the former Wayne plant in Richmond, Indiana and began producing RE and FE chassis. Though the Crane Carrier chassis designs were produced initially, Carpenter designed chassis were rapidly phased into production. In a joint venture, Carpenter expanded its cutaway-van model line by distributing single rear-wheel buses manufactured by Quebec-based manufacturer Les Enterprises Michel Corbeil (badged as both Carpenter and Corbeil vehicles).

====Crown by Carpenter (1996–99)====
As part of the 1991 purchase of the Crown Coach intellectual property, Carpenter inherited the rights to the Crown brand name. Though the Crown-influenced Carpenter Coach RE was withdrawn after 1993, the company revived the Crown name during an rebranding of the company in the second half of the 1990s. For 1996, Carpenter buses were sold under the name &quot;Crown by Carpenter&quot;. 

The same year, Carpenter leased the former facilities of Wayne Corporation (closed in 1992), moving company operations to Richmond, Indiana. Along with restarting a larger, more advanced facility, the company inherited the leadership and workforce of the former Wayne operations, bringing considerable experience and knowledge of the plant and industry to the effort. The Crown Classic inherited some parts from the Wayne Lifeguard, including its windshield, entry door, and driver&#x27;s switch panel. Carpenter made several structural changes to the body, including a new roof design with single-piece roof bows and two sets of full-length rub rails. In adapting to the equipment at the Richmond plant, a change to the techniques of welding the roof joints from the procedures used before at Mitchell would later prove vital in excluding Crown by Carpenter products from containing a crucial structural flaw. That situation was not envisioned by anyone then and would only become an issue nearly a decade in the future.

The Crown by Carpenter line included three small buses (Classmate single-rear wheel, built by Corbeil, Classmate dual rear-wheel, by Carpenter, and the Type B Cadet), the Crown Classic conventional school bus, and the Crown FE/RE transit-style (dropping the Counselor name). In an industry first, the Crown RE offered a rear-mounted emergency door (as an option), instead of the emergency exit window typical on rear-engine school buses. To make the option possible, the floor of the Crown RE was angled upward in the rear portion of the bus (to gain height over the engine compartment).

Alongside commercial-use variants of its school buses (also marketed as Crown by Carpenter), Carpenter also developed a Crown delivery truck loosely derived from its Cadet Type B school bus line.

In place of cash payment for the development of the Crown FE/RE, Carpenter offered chassis manufacturer Spartan Motors a ⅓ stake of the company in 1996. At the beginning of 1997, Spartan invested over $30 million of capital in Carpenter, with SerVaas, Inc. retaining a stake in the company. After Carpenter shut down production for four months during 1998, Spartan became the majority owner of the company.

====Carpenter (2000–01)====
In its return to production, Carpenter rebuilt its business strategy, shifting its objectives from production goals and market share towards quality, innovation, and design. Abandoning small buses altogether, the company moved towards a full-size conventional school bus, with transit-style school buses intended to be developed only as a secondary effort. The company retired the Crown by Carpenter branding, moving back to the Carpenter brand name; an all-new diamond company logo was nearly entirely from the Spartan Motors diamond logo.

Released in late 1999, the all-new Carpenter Classic 2000 conventional featured a structural redesign. Distinguished by its fully vertical rear body, larger entry and emergency doors, a redesigned windshield, and an all-new drivers area (with nearly all controls shared with the Wayne Lifeguard). The Crown FE was replaced in early 2000 by the Carpenter Chancellor, which featured the same structural changes of the Classic 2000. 

===== Carpenter Chancellor RE =====
Intended as the flagship of the new Carpenter product lineup, the 2001 Chancellor RE rear-engine Type D (transit-style) school bus was built on a Spartan Motors chassis. Its chassis featured full air-ride suspension and double frame rails for a ride similar to a motorcoach; a flat floor inside the bus was created from the double frame as well as from the fitment of smaller-diameter wheels (19&quot; vs. the standard 22.5&quot;). Unlike its Crown RE predecessor, the Chancellor RE did not feature an option for a rear emergency door, opting instead for a window emergency exit traditionally seen on rear-engine school buses.

The combination of the Spartan Motors chassis with the Carpenter Chancellor body resembled (in some aspects) the massive workhorses built in California by Crown and Gillig in years past, many of which stayed in service for 25 years or longer. Only a single prototype was completed with a second bare chassis intended for display purposes. From all reports, the Chancellor was well-received, incorporating many components and features long desired by school bus operating and maintenance personnel.

In the context of the school bus industry, the Spartan Motors chassis was in reality a premium option, incorporating many of the features long sought in a school bus. However, there were several downsides to this approach which proved fatal to the effort. As one might reasonably anticipate, the extra durability came with added cost. Also, Spartan had been serving lower quantity and higher margin markets for similar products used for high-end Class A motor homes as well as fire and rescue apparatus. Although Spartan had entered the school bus market through supplying Carpenter (for nearly a decade), their production facilities were not geared up to produce a large volume under low pricing pressures, even though their products would have proved more durable in the long run. As such, Carpenter was no longer able to compete with AmTran, Blue Bird, or Thomas on price.

This was a familiar dilemma, the same one which earlier had helped seal the fate of the Crown and Gillig coaches on the West Coast, as well as the entry of competitor Blue Bird into the mass-transit market during the 1970s. It was also similar to the situation which faced HARSCO BMY (parent company of Wayne Wheeled Vehicles) operation some years earlier, where a lesser quantity of higher quality products (at a correspondingly higher price) had also been the plant&#x27;s historical output.
===Closure===
For almost 20 years, Carpenter had been struggling between a variety of factors, including declining market share, reputation, and company finances. Though Spartan Motors considered its investment in Carpenter profitable in the long term, the parent company felt that school bus production itself was too much of a financial risk. At the beginning of October 2000, Spartan approved the liquidation of Carpenter, leading to the closure of the company.
====Epilogue: Body structure concerns====
On March 20, 2003 in Alachua County, Florida, a Carpenter school bus rolled over onto its roof. At the time of the accident, no passengers were on board and the driver survived the accident. In the rollover of the bus, the internal roof structure failed, causing much of the roof to collapse down to the level of the seats. Following the 2003 accident, subsequent inspections of Carpenter school buses by operators in various parts of the United States revealed cracked and broken welds in their roof structures; the problem was not unique to the vehicle involved in the rollover crash.

In the initial investigation, the problem of cracked and broken roof welds were found in each type of Carpenter buses built at the Mitchell, Indiana facility prior to its 1995 closure. Crown by Carpenter buses and Carpenter buses built in Richmond, Indiana from 1996 to 2001 (which used a different design for its roof structure) were not found to have any issues with cracked or broken roof welds.

In a normal case, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) would have used the findings as part of a full-scale investigation. If the findings found any kind of manufacturers defect, a safety recall of the vehicles involved would be ordered by NHTSA. As Carpenter was no longer in existence, that procedure was impossible, as there would be no one for NHTSA to hold accountable for the design problem.

In June 2003, NHTSA introduced several advisories regarding Carpenter buses. As NHTSA could not offer its own recall due to the lack of a manufacturer and remained concerned about the problem, operators were recommended to inspect their own buses for cracked and broken welds in the roof structure.

In its 2003 advisories, if a Carpenter bus was found with cracked or broken roof welds, NHTSA recommended replacement of the bus; if not practical, repair of the problem and restriction of the bus to low-speed routes to minimize the chance of rollover. To avoid resale of affected vehicles to the public, NHTSA advised that the title of Carpenter buses removed from service to be branded as &quot;scrap&quot;.

==Products==
Carpenter produced a product lineup of both small and full-size buses. Like other school bus manufacturers, the company also produced commercial, shuttle, and transit bus derivatives of their school bus designs. The Carpenter Cadet, introduced in 1969, was one of the first Type B school buses; during the Crown by Carpenter era, a modified version of the Cadet was marketed as a delivery van.

With the exception of &quot;Classic&quot;, its Type C conventional and &quot;Coach&quot;, its Type D rear-engine transit style (influenced by Crown Coach), most Carpenter school buses derived their model names from themes in education (Classmate, Cadet, Counselor, Chancellor) while many transit-style Carpenters derived their model names from common team names (Corsair, Cavalier).

==Survivors==
The Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of American History in Washington, DC has a thirty-six passenger school bus built by Carpenter Body Works in 1936 on a chassis made by Dodge in 1939. The bus carried students to the grade school in Martinsburg, Indiana from 1940 to 1946, and was owned and driven by Russell Bishop during that period. It was later used as a traveling grocery store until 1962.

The bus has a streamlined steel body painted double-deep or &quot;Omaha&quot; orange with black trim. It was restored by Carpenter in the early 1980s under the supervision of Ollie Eager, who was Carpenter&#x27;s plant manager in 1936, and John Foddrill, who worked in the Carpenter plant in 1936. The bus has replacement seats that do not match the originals exactly. The originals were black upholstery.

<text>Sir Arthur Somervell (5 June 18632 May 1937) was an English composer and educationalist. After Hubert Parry, he was one of the most successful and influential writers of art song in the English music renaissance of the 1890s–1900s. According to Michael Hurd, his most important work is found in the five song cycles, particularly his settings of Tennyson in &quot;Maud&quot; (1898) and Housman in &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot; (1904).

==Career==
He was born in Windermere, Westmorland, the son of Robert Miller Somervell and his wife. His father was a shoe manufacturer who served as JP of &quot;Hazelthwaite&quot; at Winderemere (1821-1899). The Somervell (originally Somerville) family came from Scotland, settling in London in the 1700s. 

Somervell&#x27;s brother, Colin Somervell, became a shoe-manufacturer like their father and later served as High Sheriff of Westmorland in 1916. Colin&#x27;s son, Maj. Arnold Colin Somervell, O.B.E., served in this office in 1936; later, other members of the Somervell family also served.

Somervell was initially educated at Uppingham School and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he studied composition under Sir Charles Villiers Stanford. From 1883 to 1885 he studied at the High School for Music, Berlin, and from 1885 to 1887 at the Royal College of Music in London, under Parry. He studied composition with Friedrich Kiel. He became a professor at the Royal College of Music in 1894, and conducted his own works at the Leeds and Birmingham Festivals, 1895-97.

In 1890 Somervell married Edith Lance Collet (1861-1944). There were four children: Viola Helen Antonia, Katharine Margaret, Hubert Arthur, and Ronald Arthur. Through their daughter Katherine (&#x27;Kit&#x27;), who became a dancer with Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes, they were grandparents of writer Elizabeth Jane Howard. 

Somervell was also influential in the field of music education. He worked for twenty-eight years as one of His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectors of Schools (HMI), with special responsibility for the teaching of music. He was appointed Inspector of Music at the Board of Education and Scottish Education Department in 1901 (succeeding John Stainer). In June the following year he received the degree Doctor of Music from the University of Cambridge.

Somervell was knighted in 1929. After retirement he continued as Chairman of the School Orchestra Festivals, Queen&#x27;s Hall, from 1932 until his death. He died at his home, 105 Clifton Hill, St John&#x27;s Wood, aged 73. After he was cremated, his ashes were buried in the place of his birth, the Lake District, specifically within Grasmere Cemetery.

==Music==
Somervell&#x27;s style was conservative, and shows the influence of Mendelssohn and Brahms. He achieved success in his own day as a composer of choral works such as &quot;The Forsaken Merman&quot; (1895), &quot;Intimations of Immortality&quot; (which he conducted at Leeds Festival in 1907), and a short oratorio &quot;The Passion of Christ&quot; (1914). For a time this rivalled Stainer’s ubiquitous &quot;Crucifixion&quot; in popularity. His only symphony, &quot;Thalassa&quot;, was first performed in February 1913, and clearly follows on from the example of Brahms. The central ‘Lost in Action’ slow movement was regularly played as a stand-alone piece during the First World War. The Clarinet Quintet was first performed by Haydn Draper at the Wigmore Hall on 19 May, 1919, but received few other performances until the recent revival of interest. His Violin Concerto of 1930 was dedicated to the violinist Adila Fachiri. His popular Handel adaptation &quot;Silent Worship&quot; was featured in the 1996 film &quot;Emma&quot;.

Today he is chiefly remembered for his song cycles, such as &quot;Maud&quot; (after Tennyson, 1898) and the first known musical setting (1904) of A. E. Housman&#x27;s &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;. Trevor Hold points out that Somervell had &quot;a genuine, deep affection for literature&quot;, reflected in his wide and eclectic choice of texts. &quot;Maud&quot; was the first successful English song cycle, and &quot;remains one of the masterpieces of English song&quot;. Stephen Banfield considers the Robert Browning cycle &quot;A Broken Arc&quot; (1923) his best, and &#x27;The worst of it&#x27; his best song.

==Recordings==
* The Violin Concerto in G minor (1930) received its first recording in 2005 by Anthony Marwood and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Martyn Brabbins.

* The &quot;Thalassa&quot; Symphony in D minor (The Sea Symphony), received its world premiere recording in 2011 for Cameo Classics, nearly 100 years after its composition. Written in 1912, the second movement, &#x27;Elegy&#x27;, commemorates Robert Falcon Scott&#x27;s death in the Antarctic that year. The Malta Philharmonic Orchestra was conducted by Michael Laus.

* The Piano Concerto (1921) and the &quot;Normandy Variations&quot; for piano and orchestra (1912) were recorded for Hyperion Records in 2011, with Martin Roscoe and the BBC Concert Orchestra under Martin Yates.

* &quot;Two conversations about Bach&quot; (1915) for two violins and piano received its premiere recording in 2015, by Rupert Marshall-Luck (both violins, double-tracked), and Matthew Rickard (piano).

* The Clarinet Quintet in G major (1913) was recorded by Stephan Siegenthaler and the Leipzig String Quartet on CPO in 2016.

* There are many recordings of &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot; and &quot;Maud&quot;. But the lesser known song cycle &quot;A Broken Arc&quot; (setting Browning) from 1923 has also been recorded.

==History==
The family was first recorded in September 1303 when its progenitor knight Heinrich genannt Flecke von Nesselrode was mentioned as feudal lord of Deutz Abbey. served as their first family seat. There were several branches of the family: Nesselrode-Reichenstein, Nesselrode-Ehreshoven, Nesselrode-Landscron, and Nesselrode-Hugenpoēt. They were sovereign Counts of the imperially immediate .

The Reichenstein line were made Imperial barons in 1653 and Imperial Counts in 1702. In 1698, Baron Franz von Nesselrode-Reichenstein (1635–1707), from 1702 Imperial Count, who served as Imperial Chancellor in the Principality of Münster, bought the immediate Lordship of Reichenstein from the Counts von Wied for 6000 thaler. He was followed by his son, Count Franz Wilhelm Anton von Nesselrode-Reichenstein (1701–1776). With his death, this line of the family became extinct. The County of Reichenstein was inherited by his cousin, Count Johann Wilhelm Maximilian von Nesselrode-Landscron (1726–1800), who became the reigning Count von Nesselrode-Reichenstein.

<doc id="1272970" wikidata="Q3274892" url="?curid=1272970" title="Zhonghua Gate, Nanjing">
<text>The Zhonghua Gate (), is a gate and defensive complex on the city wall of Nanjing, China. This is the southern gate of Nanjing city. It is a renowned ancient city gate in China and the city gate with the most complex structure in the world.

== History ==


The city wall of Nanjing was built from 1360 to 1386 under the founder of the Ming dynasty, the Hongwu Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang. In 1368, Zhu Yuanzhang was crowned Emperor, and made Nanjing his capital. The southern and eastern sections of the old city wall from the Tang dynasty were incorporated into the new wall. The northern and eastern sections were built afresh. The city wall was 33.676 kilometres long. It was 14–21 m high; 14.5m thick at its base, and 4.9m thick at the top. Thirteen gates were built into the wall, and the enclosed area was the largest of any walled city in China.

The gate today known as Zhonghua Gate was then known as Jubao Gate (). It was built on the site of the south gate of the capital city of the Southern Tang dynasty. It was the largest among the thirteen gates of Nanjing. In 1931, after the Republic of China government established Nanjing as its capital, the gate was renamed to Zhonghua Gate. In one sense, this reflects the triumph of the southern factions led by Chiang Kai-shek over the northern factions of the Beiyang government in Beijing, who had named the southern (main) gate of Beijing &quot;Gate of China&quot; to signify its status as &quot;gate of the nation&quot;.

== Layout ==
The gate was made of huge strip stones 0.8 – 1.39 m long, 0.7 m wide and 0.26-0.35 thick and large Chinese brick 0.4 m long 0.2 m wide and 0.1 m thick.

Its dimensions were 118.5 m from east to west, and 128 m from south to north. The ramparts were 20.45 m high. The total area enclosed was 15,168 square meters. Three barbicans were connected by four arched gates, each of which was equipped with a Qianjinzha () which could be opened up and down, as well as a pair of wooden doors. The Toudaomen () consisted of 3 steps.

At the top step, there used to be a wooden building to defend against the enemy. The middle step was built of brick and stone. It was 65.15 m long, 47.20 m wide and 9.00 m high. In the north section of it were constructed 7 soldier staying holes. In the middle of the lower step was constructed an arched gate leading to barbican. It was 52.60 m long, 5.35 m wide and 8.7 m high. At the north section of it were built 3 soldier staying holes. Erdaomen (the second gate) was 16.14 m away from Toudaomen. Its hole was 8.20 m long, 4.97 m wide and 8.10 m high. The hole of Sandaomen (the third gate) 15.18 m away from Erdaomen was 8.32 m long, 4.82 m wide and 8.1 m high. Sidaomen (the fourth gate) was 19.3 m away from Sandaomen. Its hole was 8.8 m long, 4.8 m wide and 8.1 m high. At the outerside of the east and west of barbican were constructed 14 soldier staying holes (7 facing to the east 7 facing to the west). There are 27 soldier staying holes altogether in all the barbican and two paved ramps by which mounted troops can ride to the top.

Zhonghua Gate has weathered wind and rain for 600 years. It still holds its original state except that the wooden structure has been destroyed and some features on the wall constructed of sticks and stones. It is rare in the world for its vast scale and sophisticated style.

It is a great engineering project of complex and intricate design, occupying an important place in Chinese construction history, as well as being important in Chinese military history. It was listed on the cultural and scenic spots under careful protection by the Jiangsu provincial government in 1957 and the state council in 1988.

== Admission ==
The site is open to the public from 08:30 to 20:00, with tickets costing 50 yuan.

== Transportation ==
The area is accessible within walking distance north of Zhonghuamen Station of Nanjing Metro.

<doc id="1272972" wikidata="Q156073" url="?curid=1272972" title="Jetix">
<text>Jetix (stylized in all caps) was a children&#x27;s entertainment brand owned by The Walt Disney Company. The brand was for a slate of action/adventure-related programming blocks and television channels. Jetix programming mainly originated from the Saban Entertainment library, airing live-action and animated series with some original programming. The channel&#x27;s target audience was older children and adolescents aged 8–15.

Jetix was first launched as a programming block in the United States on Toon Disney on February 14, 2004, to compete with Cartoon Network&#x27;s Toonami block, and in Europe in April 2004. By the end of 2004, Jetix began completely replacing the international Fox Kids channels around the world, the first being the French version in August 2004, and the last one being the German version, in June 2005.

Although it was commercially successful, the Jetix brand was later discontinued in 2009. All international channels were rebranded as either Disney XD or Disney Channel due to The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s focus on its existing television brands. After the shutdown of the last Jetix channel in Russia (replaced with Disney Channel Russia) on August 10, 2010, and with the shutdown of Jetix Play in the Middle East on September 1, 2010 (which was replaced with Playhouse Disney, later Disney Junior) the Jetix brand officially ceased usage.

== History ==
=== The development of the Jetix brand and launch in the United States ===
In January 2004, Fox Kids Europe, Fox Kids Latin America (both of which were purchased by Disney in 2001 as part of Fox Family Worldwide) and the ABC Cable Networks Group agreed to rename its then current operations under a single brand, called Jetix, which helped strengthen its then operations into a single force. The Jetix name was applied to its programming blocks which aired on ABC Family and Toon Disney, its television channels in Europe and Latin America, along with its program library and merchandising. After the end of Fox Kids in the US, much of the content previously aired on the block migrated to ABC Family and Toon Disney; the international Fox Kids networks kept operating despite their US forerunner becoming defunct.

The Jetix name was chosen after the company conducted international research specifically with a number of children&#x27;s focus groups. Many of the children picked the name as it implied action and adventure, and the company was able to use the name internationally due to its ambiguity. Bruce Steinberg, chairman and chief executive officer of Fox Kids Europe, explain that Jetix would help strengthen Fox Kids Europe&#x27;s partnership with Disney while building new alliances to continue to successfully leverage its programming library and distribution.

On Valentine&#x27;s Day 2004, Toon Disney and ABC Family launched Jetix with &quot;Jetix Cards Live&quot;, the world&#x27;s first concurrently online and telecast trading card game. ABC Family aired Jetix on weekdays from 7am to 9am and weekends 7am to 12 noon ET/PT. The block also aired on Toon Disney Monday through Thursday from 7pm to 9pm ET/PT and weekends from 7pm to 9pm ET/PT.

=== International expansion and transition of the Fox Kids brand into Jetix ===
Outside of the United States, Jetix was first launched as a programming block on the European Fox Kids channels in April 2004, airing in mornings and afternoons.

The transition of Fox Kids networks into Jetix started in August 2004 with the French version&#x27;s rebranding, which was followed up with the Latin American version later in the month. The transitioning continued throughout 2004 and 2005 with the rebranding of the Scandinavian version (October), versions in most European territories (January), the Netherlands (February) and Italy and Israel (March). The transition was completed in June 2005 when the final Fox Kids network in Germany was rebranded as Jetix.

The Fox Kids Play channels available in CEE and MENA (which primarily aired archive programming from Saban, Fox Kids, and Jetix archives, including some DiC Entertainment shows) were rebranded as Jetix Play, on 1 January 2005.

The Jetix brand unified the children&#x27;s programming department at ABC&#x27;s domestic cable networks, as well as Fox Kids in Europe and Latin America, in a joint programming alliance. The first Jetix Europe co-productions were &quot;W.I.T.C.H.&quot; and &quot;Super Robot Monkey Team Hyper Force Go!&quot;, with &quot;Get Ed&quot; and &quot;Yin Yang Yo!&quot; following in 2005 and 2006 respectively.

=== The fate of Jetix ===
In Fall 2006, Toon Disney in the United States became the exclusive home for Jetix, effectively ending the block on ABC Family. The Jetix programming block continued to take significant chunks of Toon Disney&#x27;s airtime, until the introduction of Disney XD in the United States on February 13, 2009.

Disney XD was to be slightly different from Jetix; it still mostly focused on the boy demographic, but would include more live-action productions under the Disney banner and also be a home for Disney&#x27;s recent animated productions (for both boys and girls), effectively superseding Toon Disney in the United States. The new brand was to be &quot;aimed at boys ages 6-14 and features content focusing on the themes of adventure, accomplishment, gaming, music and sports.&quot;

A few months before the U.S. launch of Disney XD on December 8, 2008, Disney announced that it would be increasing its shares in Jetix Europe to 96% with the intention to buy the remaining shares in the company, effectively ending Jetix Europe&#x27;s autonomy. Disney wanted full control of the company and to bring the European Jetix channels completely under the Disney umbrella, enabling Disney to have a singular unified strategy for its channels. After the completion of Jetix Europe&#x27;s share buy-back offer, Jetix Europe was delisted from the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange on 27 February 2009. In the gradual phase out of the Jetix brand, Jetix Europe&#x27;s CEO Paul Taylor resigned, with John Hardie, the Executive Vice President of Disney Channels EMEA as CEO on 11 February 2009. John Hardie left Disney for ITN in June 2009 and was replaced with Giorgio Stock (who later became head of Turner Broadcasting System Europe).

In June 2008, Disney France announced that Disney Channel and Jetix would merge operations; at the time, Jetix was being affected by falling carriage rates and came close to leaving the CanalSat pay-TV platform in France after protracted negotiations. Jetix France was the first European version of Jetix to make the conversion to Disney XD on 1 April 2009.

In countries where Disney Channel didn&#x27;t already exist, Jetix became Disney Channel (most notably the Central Eastern Europe and the Hungarian, Czech, Slovakian, Romanian, and Israeli feeds). The last main Jetix feed in operation, Jetix Russia, made the conversion to Disney Channel on 10 August 2010. Also, in the countries where Jetix Play broadcast, it became a localised version of Playhouse Disney; however, the rollout was not synchronized with the conversion of the main Jetix networks in these areas, instead happening between 2010 and 2011, one region at a time.

In Italy, the managing director of Jetix Italy, Francesco Nespega, led a management buyout; Jetix Italy was renamed as Switchover Media and was now responsible for two channels that were previously operated by Jetix Italy, pay-TV channel GXT and free-to-air channel K2 (as of 2024, they are operated by Warner Bros. Discovery EMEA). However, the main Jetix Italy channel remained at Disney and was rebranded as Disney XD in September 2009.

== List of versions ==


=== Other versions ===
== Programming ==
Jetix was primarily built upon Disney&#x27;s ownership of the Saban Entertainment library (acquired along with ABC Family Worldwide in 2001), which included shows from Marvel Productions; action-adventure shows were the primary programming theme, though not all Jetix networks and blocks were necessarily limited to that genre. Furthermore, programming from outside producers and distributors were also included.

Jetix Animation Concepts was a brand by Walt Disney Television Animation used for animation co-produced by and for the Jetix global group by the ABC Cable Networks Group.

==Magazine and other ventures==
As part of brand extension, many of the overseas Jetix networks engaged in various marketing exercises, including print publications, awards shows and sporting events.

In the U.K., Future plc published the official &quot;Jetix Magazine&quot;; it was launched in early September 2004 by Jetix Consumer Products and Future Publishing. Cavan Scott was the magazine&#x27;s initial editor. Published every four weeks, it featured puzzles and features based on the channel&#x27;s shows. The magazine also came with a free DVD featuring shows from the channel.

In other countries, including Bulgaria, the Netherlands and Romania, similar Jetix magazines were also produced.

With the purchase of the remaining Jetix Europe shares by The Walt Disney Company and the change over of the channels to a Disney branded channel, Future renamed the magazine to &quot;Nitro!&quot;, to become an independent magazine with the same general focus.

In CEE, there was annual children&#x27;s musical event called &quot;Jetix Kids Awards,&quot; in which children could vote their favorite shows and stars, in order to win prizes. The last edition took place in 2008.

The &quot;Jetix Kids Cup&quot; (formerly known as the &quot;Fox Kids Cup&quot;) was an association football tournament in which children from 16 countries competed to &quot;promote fair play, sportsmanship and cultural exchange&quot;.

<doc id="1272973" wikidata="Q319355" url="?curid=1272973" title="Ted Drake">
<text>Edward Joseph Drake (16 August 1912 – 30 May 1995) was an English football player and manager. As a player, he first played for Southampton but made his name playing for Arsenal in the 1930s, winning two league titles and an FA Cup, as well as five caps for England. Drake is Arsenal&#x27;s joint fifth highest goalscorer of all time. He also holds the record for the most goals scored in a top flight game in English football, with seven against Aston Villa in December 1935. A former centre forward, Drake has been described as a &quot;classic number 9&quot; and as a &quot;strong, powerful, brave and almost entirely unthinking&quot; player who &quot;typified the English view.&quot;

After retiring from playing football, Drake became a manager, most notably of Chelsea. In 1955, he led the club to their first league title. This made him the first person to win the English top-flight as both a player and a manager. He was also a cricketer, but only ever played sparingly for Hampshire.

==Club career==

===Southampton===
Born in Southampton, Drake started playing at Winchester City, whilst continuing to work as a gas-meter reader. He nearly joined Spurs as a schoolboy, but missed the trial match with an injury. In June 1931, he was persuaded by George Kay to join Southampton, then playing in Division Two. He made his Saints debut on 14 November 1931 at Swansea Town, and signed as a professional in November, becoming first-choice centre-forward by the end of the 1931–32 season.

In the following season he made 33 league appearances, scoring 20 goals. After only one full season, his bravery and skill attracted the attention of Arsenal&#x27;s Herbert Chapman, who tried to persuade Drake to move to north London. Drake rejected the chance of a move to Highbury and decided to remain at The Dell. He started the 1933–34 season by scoring a hat-trick in the opening game against Bradford City, following this with at least one goal in the next four games, thereby amassing eight goals in the opening five games. By early March he had blasted his way to the top of the Football League Division Two goal-scoring table with 22 goals.

Arsenal, with George Allison now in charge, renewed their interest and Drake eventually decided to join the Gunners. Saints had declined several previous offers, but eventually were forced to sell to balance their books. Drake made a total of 74 appearances for Southampton, scoring 48 goals.

===Arsenal===
Drake moved to Arsenal in March 1934 for £6,500, and scored on his league debut against Wolves on 24 March 1934, in a 3–2 win. Although he joined too late to qualify for a League Championship medal in 1933–34, Drake would win one in 1934–35, scoring 42 goals in 41 league games in the process – this included three hat-tricks and four four-goal hauls. With two more goals in the FA Cup and Charity Shield, Drake scored 44 in all that season, breaking Jack Lambert&#x27;s club record, one that still holds to this day.

The following season, 1935–36 Drake scored seven in a single match against Aston Villa at Villa Park on 14 December 1935, a club record and top flight record that also still stands. Drake claimed an eighth goal hit the crossbar and went over the line, but the referee waved away his appeal. Drake would go on to win the FA Cup in 1935–36 with him scoring the only goal in the final and the League title again in 1937–38 with Arsenal.

Despite being injured regularly (he was a doubt up until the last minute for the 1936 Cup Final), Drake&#x27;s speed, fierce shooting and brave playing style meant he was Arsenal&#x27;s first-choice centre forward for the rest of the decade, and he was the club&#x27;s top scorer for each of the five seasons from 1934–35 to 1938–39. The Second World War curtailed Drake&#x27;s career, although he served in the Royal Air Force as well as turning out for Arsenal in wartime games and also appearing as a guest player for West Ham United later in World War II. However, Drake&#x27;s career would not last long into peacetime; a spinal injury incurred in a game against Reading in 1945 forced him to retire from playing. With 139 goals in 184 games, he is along with Jimmy Brain the joint-fifth all-time scorer for Arsenal.

Drake was one of 32 Arsenal legends who were emblazoned in a mural upon the walls of the club&#x27;s Emirates Stadium.

==International career==
Drake&#x27;s exploits at club level brought him recognition at international level, and he made his England debut against Italy in the &quot;Battle of Highbury&quot; on 14 November 1934. As one of seven Arsenal players in the side, he scored the third goal in a heated 3–2 win. With England Drake also went on to win the 1935 British Home Championship title. In total he won five caps, scoring six times for the Three Lions.

==Cricket career==
Drake made his debut for Hampshire in 1931 and shared a vital stand of 86 with Phil Mead against Glamorgan. He made 45 but never reached this score again in the 15 further matches he played over the next six years, first as an amateur and then as a professional.

==Managerial career==

===Hendon and Reading===
After retiring as a player, Drake managed Hendon in 1946, and then Reading from 1947. He led the club to the runners-up spot in Division Three South in 1948–49 and again in 1951–52, though at the time only the champions were promoted.

===Chelsea===

He was appointed manager of First Division Chelsea in June 1952. Upon Drake&#x27;s arrival at Chelsea, he made a series of sweeping changes, doing much to rid the club of its previous image. He discarded the club&#x27;s Chelsea pensioner crest and with it the Pensioners nickname, and insisted a new one be adopted. From these changes came the Lion Rampant Regardant crest and the Blues nickname. He introduced scouting reports and a new, tougher, training regime based on ballwork, a rare practice in English football at the time. The club&#x27;s previous policy of signing unreliable big-name players was abandoned; Drake instead used his knowledge of the lower divisions and the amateur game to recruit little-known, but more reliable players. These included John McNichol, Frank Blunstone, Derek Saunders, Jim Lewis and Peter Sillett

Within three years, in the 1954–55 season, Drake had led Chelsea to their first league championship triumph. In doing so, he became the first person to win the league title both as player and manager. However, Drake never came close to repeating the success. The championship-winning side was gradually broken up, to be replaced by the crop of youngsters emerging from the club&#x27;s youth team, such as Jimmy Greaves, Peter Brabrook and Bobby Tambling. Thereafter performances and results were erratic, leaving the club stranded in mid-table; an FA Cup loss to Fourth Division side Crewe Alexandra weakened his position at the club and a few months later during the 1961–62 season Drake was dismissed.

===Later career===
After leaving Chelsea, he became reserve team manager at Fulham, where he was also assistant to the manager Vic Buckingham. In December he joined Barcelona as assistant to Buckingham, staying until June 1970. He later returned to Fulham where he became a chief scout, director and life president of the Cottagers. Drake died at the age of 82 on 30 May 1995.

<doc id="1272976" wikidata="Q3236645" url="?curid=1272976" title="Karma in Hinduism">
<text>Karma is a concept of Hinduism which describes a system in which beneficial effects are derived from past beneficial actions and harmful effects from past harmful actions, creating a system of actions and reactions throughout a soul&#x27;s (jivatman&#x27;s) reincarnated lives, forming a cycle of rebirth. The causality is said to apply not only to the material world but also to our thoughts, words, actions, and actions that others do under our instructions.

For example, if one performs a good deed, something good will happen to them, and the same applies if one does a bad thing. In the Puranas, it is said that the lord of karma is represented by the planet Saturn, known as Shani.

According to Vedanta thought, the most influential school of Hindu theology, the effects of karma are controlled by God (Isvara).

There are four different types of karma: &quot;prarabdha&quot;, &quot;sanchita&quot;, and &quot;kriyamana&quot; and &quot;agami&quot;. &quot;Prarabdha karma&quot; is experienced through the present body and is only a part of &quot;sanchita karma,&quot; which is the sum of one&#x27;s past karma&#x27;s, Kriyamana karma is the karma that is being performed in the present whereas &quot;Agami karma&quot; is the result of current decisions and actions.

==Origins==
The earliest appearance of the word &quot;karma&quot; is found in the Rigveda. The term &quot;karma&quot; also appears significantly in the Veda. According to &quot;Brahmanas&quot;, &quot;as his creations is born to the world he has made&quot; and one is placed in a balance in the other world for an estimate of one&#x27;s good and evil deed. It also declares that as a man is &#x27;constituted&#x27; by his desires, he is born in the other world concerning these.

The earliest evidence of the term’s expansion into an ethical domain is provided in the Upanishads. In the &quot;Brhadaranyaka&quot;, which is the earliest of the Upanishads, the Vedic theologian Yajnavalkya expressed: “A man turns into something good by good action and into something bad by bad action.” The doctrine occurs here in the context of a discussion of the fate of the individual after death.

The doctrine of transmigration of the soul, concerning fateful retribution for acts committed, appears in the Rig Veda (Mandala 1, Sukta 24, Mantra 2), with words like &quot;saha na mahye aaditaye punar-daath pitharam drisheyam matharam cha&quot; (You must also know that one God to be a giver of rebirth, non else can do this work. It is he who gives birth to emancipated persons also through parents at the end of MahaKalpa.) Rebirth is also mentioned in the Yajur Veda (Mandala 3, Mantras 53-54):

The belief in rebirth is, suggests Radhakrishnan, evident in the &quot;Brāhmaṇas&quot;, where words like &quot;punar-mrtyu&quot; (re-death), &quot;punar-asu&quot; (coming to life again) and &quot;punarajati&quot; (rebirth) are used to denote it. Radhakrishnan acknowledges that other scholars interpret certain &quot;punar-mrtyu&quot; verses of Rigveda to be discussing &quot;repeated deaths&quot;; however, he suggests that it might also be re-interpreted to imply rebirth, as in &quot;come home once again&quot;.

The significance of reinterpreting religious principles such as karma in the Bhagavad Gita as an important source, as well as a dedication to benevolence, applied spirituality, and religious activism The topic of karma is mentioned in the Puranas.

==Definitions==

Our Sanathana Dharma roots and traditions provide insight into four kinds of karma, further divided into two components of each karma.

Four Karmas:
*Sanchita Karma
*Prarabdha Karma 
*Kriyamana Karma
*Agama Karma

Two sub-components:
*Dridha
*Adridha

Essentially in simple English, they can be categorized broadly as Fate and Free Will.

Intertwined Fate and Free Will:

The first 2 Karmas, namely Sanchita and Prarabdha are Fated and the next 2 karmas Kriyamana and Agama are free will. The 2 components are called Dridha and Adridha. Dridha is fixed and Adridha is non-fixed.

Fated Ones:

The Fated ones are an accumulation of all our past lives actions, for which one would experience his or her consequences in the current life and future lives. Consequences can be perceived as positive, negative and/or neutral. In simple essence, they will be experiences one has to undertake.

The Dridha aspects of Sanchita and Prarabdha Karmas will be experienced, as and when the time (Kala) arises and cannot be influenced, changed or altered.

The Free will ones are the thinking (agama Karma) and execution of actions (kriyamana Karma) that an individual can undertake freely in his or her current life, and can help influence, change or alter, the Adridha (non-fixed) aspects of the Fated ones in this current life, and can/will also accumulate karmic credits into his or her Sanchita and Prarabdha accounts, which will be experienced in the future.

Overall, The Hindu Sanathana Dharma shows that one with his or her free will, if pursuing a life of proper dharma, can alter his or her current life and also influence the future destiny of their life, as well as future lives and essentially attain nirvana, or a state of no more births, where they essentially merge with the Universe/GOD/Almighty/Infinity.

Everything that we have ever thought, spoken, done or caused is karma, as is also that which we think, speak or do this very moment. Hindu scriptures divide karma into three kinds:

* &quot;Sanchita&quot; is the accumulated karma. It would be impossible to experience and endure all karma in one lifetime. From this stock of &quot;Sanchita karma&quot;, a handful is taken out to serve one lifetime and this handful of actions, which have begun to bear fruit and which will be exhausted only on their fruit being enjoyed and not otherwise, is known as &quot;Prarabdha karma&quot;.
* &quot;Prarabdha&quot; is a collection of past &quot;Sanchita karmas&quot; that are selected to be experienced through the present body.
* &quot;Kriyamana&quot; is everything that we produce in our current life. All &quot;kriyamana karmas&quot; flow into &quot;Sanchita karma&quot; and consequently shape our future. Only in human life, we can change our future destiny. After death, we lose &quot;Kriya Shakti&quot; (ability to act) and &quot;Kriyamana&quot; (do) karma until we are born again in another human body.

Some believe that only human beings who can distinguish right from wrong can do (&quot;Kriyamana&quot;) karma. Therefore, animals and young children are considered incapable of creating new karma (and thus cannot affect their future destinies) as they are incapable of discriminating between right and wrong.

Tulsidas, a Hindu saint, said: &quot;Our destiny was shaped long before the body came into being.&quot; As long as the stock of &quot;Sanchita Karma&quot; lasts, a part of it continues to be taken out as &quot;Prarabdha Karma&quot; for being enjoyed in one lifetime, leading to the cycle of birth and death. A Jiva cannot attain moksha (liberation) from the cycle of birth and death, until the accumulated &quot;Sanchita karmas&quot; are completely exhausted.

Unkindness yields spoiled fruits, called &quot;pāpa&quot;, and good deeds bring forth sweet fruits, called &quot;punya&quot;. As one acts, so does one become: one becomes virtuous by virtuous action, and evil by evil action.

==The role of Isvara (God)==
Several different views exist in Hinduism, some extant today and some historical, regarding the role of divine beings in controlling the effects of karma or the lack thereof.

=== Markandeya Purana ===
According to the Markandeya Purana, Shani (Saturn) is described as the son of the Sun god, Surya, and his wife Chhaya (shadow). Saturn is characterized as cold and dry due to its internal core structure made of ice. Internally, he is considered pure. The Purana also states that Shani was entrusted with the role of the Lord of Karma and Justice by the Trimurti.

===In Vedanta===
In Vedanta philosophy, the creator Ishvara rules over the world through the law of karma. The various schools of Vedanta hold that karma cannot function independently on its own. Instead they think that God (Isvara) is the dispenser of the fruit (phala) of karma. This idea is defended in the &quot;Brahmasutras&quot;, a major scriptural source for Vedanta.

The &quot;Brahmasutras&quot; (3.2.38) state:The fruits of action (&quot;phalam&quot;) come from Him (The Lord, Isvara), since this is reasonable (&quot;upapatteḥ)&quot;.

==== In the Advaita system of Śaṅkara ====
In the non-dualistic (Advaita) school of Vedanta, the creator God (Ishvara) is not the ultimate reality, instead the formless Brahman is the supreme truth. As such, the teaching of karma is part of Maya, or the relative and ultimately illusory reality. Nevertheless, Advaita also shares the general concepts of karma and rebirth with other Indian religions, with some differences.

In a commentary to &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot; (III, 2, 38, and 41), a Vedantic text, Adi Sankara, an Indian philosopher who consolidated the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta, a sub-school of Vedanta, argues that the original karmic actions themselves cannot bring about the proper results at some future time; neither can super sensuous, non-intelligent qualities like adrsta—an unseen force being the metaphysical link between work and its result—by themselves mediate the appropriate, justly deserved pleasure and pain. The fruits, according to him, then, must be administered through the action of a conscious agent, namely, a supreme being (Ishvara).

Shankara (8th century) comments as follows:Karma is insentient and short-lived, and cannot therefore be expected to bestow the fruits of actions at a future time according to one’s deserts. We do not see any insentient thing bestow fruits on those who worship it. Therefore it is only from the Lord, who is worshipped through actions, that their results proceed.A human&#x27;s karmic acts result in merits and demerits. Since unconscious things generally do not move except when caused by an agent (for example, the axe moves only when swung by an agent), and since the law of karma is an unintelligent and unconscious law, Sankara argues there must be a conscious God who knows the merits and demerits which persons have earned by their actions, and who functions as an instrumental cause [a &quot;judge and police-force&quot; working for &quot;the law&quot;] in helping individuals reap their appropriate fruits.

Thus, God affects the person&#x27;s environment, even to its atoms, and for those souls who reincarnate, produces the appropriate rebirth body, all in order that the person might have the karmically appropriate experiences. Since a data-system (or computer) is needed to discern different &quot;just&quot; consequences for actions, there is suggested to be a sentient theistic administrator or supervisor for karma (Ishvara).

==== In the Vishishtadvaita of Rāmāṉuja ====
Ramanuja of the Vishishtadvaita school, another sub-school of Vedanta, addresses the problem of evil by attributing all evil things in life to the accumulation of evil karma of jivas (souls in bondage to a corporeal form) and maintains that God is &quot;amala,&quot; or without any stain of evil. In his &quot;Sri Bhasya&quot;, Ramanuja&#x27;s interpretation of the Brahma sutras from a Vaishnavite theistic view, Brahman, whom he conceives as Vishnu, arranges the diversity of creation in accordance with the different karma of individual souls.

Ramanuja reiterates that inequality and diversity in the world are due to the fruits of karma of different souls and the omnipresent energy of the soul suffers pain or pleasure due to its karma. Unlike the Semitic religions, e.g., Abrahamic religions, which believe that God created the soul and the world out of &#x27;nothing,’ Ramanuja believed that creation is an eternally recurring cyclic process; hence, God is free from the responsibility of starting it and causing the evils accruing from it. Instead he believed that karma, the result of the actions of Jivas (souls) in previous embodiments, causes the good and evil, enjoyments and sufferings of karma which have to be necessary to be enjoyed or suffered by the Jivas themselves who are responsible for the fruits.

Although souls alone have the freedom and responsibility for their acts and thus reap the fruits of karma, i.e., good and evil karma, God as Vishnu, is the supreme Enforcer of karma, by acting as the Sanctioner (&quot;Anumanta&quot;) and the Overseer (&quot;Upadrasta&quot;). According to Ramanuja, all jivas are burdened with their load of Karma, which gives them only enjoyments and sufferings, but also desires and tendencies to act in particular ways; although the moral responsibility accrues only to the Jiva, as he acts according to the tendencies and deserts he has acquired by his karma, Ramanuja believes that God wills only their fructification. According to the foregoing concept, God is &quot;compared to light which may be used for forging or for reading scriptures,&quot; but the merits or demerit &quot;devolves entirely on the persons concerned and not on the darkness.&quot;

Furthermore, Ramanuja believes that Vishnu wishing to do a favor to those who are resolved on acting so as fully to please Her, engenders in their minds a tendency towards highly virtuous actions, such as means to attain to Him; while on the other hand, in order to punish those who are resolved on lines of action altogether displeasing to Him, He engenders in their minds a delight in such actions as have a downward tendency and are obstacles in the way of the attainment of God.

====Madhva (Dvaita)====

Madhva, the founder of the Dvaita school, another sub-school of Vedanta, on the other hand, believes that there must be a root cause for variations in karma even if karma is accepted as having no beginning and being the cause of the problem of evil. Since jivas have different kinds of karma, from good to bad, all must not have started with the same type of karma from the beginning of time. Thus, Madhva concludes that the jivas (souls) are not God&#x27;s creation as in the Christian doctrine, but are rather entities co-existent with Vishnu, although under His absolute control. Souls are thus dependent on Him in their pristine nature and in all transformations that they may undergo.

According to Madhva, God, although He has control, does not interfere with Man&#x27;s free will; although He is omnipotent, that does not mean that He engages in extraordinary feats. Rather, God enforces a rule of law and, in accordance with the just deserts of jivas, gives them the freedom to follow their own nature. Thus, God functions as the sanctioner or as the divine accountant, and accordingly Jivas are free to work according to their innate nature and their accumulated karma, good and bad. Since God acts as the sanctioner, the ultimate power for everything comes from God and the Jiva only utilizes that power, according to his/her innate nature. However, like Shankara&#x27;s interpretation of the Brahma Sutras as mentioned earlier, Madhva, agrees that the rewards and punishments bestowed by God are regulated by Him in accordance with the good and sinful deeds performed by them, and He does so of out of His own will to keep himself firm in justice and he cannot be controlled in His actions by karma of human beings nor can He be accused of partiality or cruelty to anyone.

Swami Tapasyananda further explains the Madhva view by illustrating the doctrine with this analogy: the power in a factory comes from the powerhouse (God), but the various cogs (&quot;Jivas&quot;) move in a direction in which they are set. Thus he concludes that no charge of partiality and cruelty can be brought against God. The Jiva is the actor and also the enjoyer of the fruits of his/her own actions.

Madhva differed significantly from traditional Hindu beliefs, owing to his concept of eternal damnation. For example, he divides souls into three classes: one class of souls which qualify for liberation (Mukti-yogyas), another subject to eternal rebirth or eternal transmigration (Nitya-samsarins), and a third class that is eventually condemned to eternal hell or Andhatamas (Tamo-yogyas).

==== According to Sivananda ====

Swami Sivananda, an Advaita scholar, reiterates the Advaita view in his commentary synthesizing Vedanta views on the Brahma Sutras. In his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed. Hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one&#x27;s merit. Furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates apurva or punya, which gives fruit. Since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as God. It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.

There is a passage from Swami Sivananda&#x27;s translation of the Svetasvatara Upanishad (4:6) illustrating this concept:

In his commentary, the first bird represents the individual soul, while the second represents Brahman or God. The soul is essentially a reflection of Brahman. The tree represents the body. The soul identifies itself with the body, reaps the fruits of its actions, and undergoes rebirth. The Lord alone stands as an eternal witness, ever contented, and does not eat, for he is the director of both the eater and the eaten.

Swami Sivananda also notes that God is free from charges of partiality and cruelty which are brought against him because of social inequality, fate, and universal suffering in the world. According to the Brahma Sutras, individual souls are responsible for their own fate; God is merely the dispenser and witness with reference to the merit and demerit of souls.

In his commentary on Chapter 2 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda further notes that the position of God with respect to karma can be explained through the analogy of rain. Although rain can be said to bring about the growth of rice, barley and other plants, the differences in various species is due to the diverse potentialities lying hidden in the respective seeds. Thus, Sivananda explains that differences between classes of beings are due to different merits belonging to individual souls. He concludes that God metes rewards and punishments only in consideration of the specific actions of beings.

=== In Shaivism ===
====Thirugnana Sambandar====

Sambandar of the Shaiva Siddhanta school (7th century C.E.) discusses karma in his hymns on devotion and grace of Shiva. He explains the concept of karma in Hinduism by distinguishing it from that of Buddhism and Jainism, which do not require the existence of an external being like God. Sambandar explains the concept with a metaphor: just as a calf among a large number of cows can find its mother at suckling time, so also does karma find the specific individual it needs to attach to and come to fruition. However, theistic Hindus posit that karma, unlike the calf, is an unintelligent entity. Hence, karma cannot locate the appropriate person by itself. Sambantha concludes that an intelligent Supreme Being with perfect wisdom and power (Shiva, for example) is necessary to make karma attach to the appropriate individual. In such sense, God is the Divine Accountant.

====Appayya Dikshita====
Appayya Dikshita, a Shaiva theologian and proponent of Shiva Advaita, states that Shiva only awards happiness and misery in accordance with the law of karma. Thus persons themselves perform good or evil actions according to their own inclinations as acquired in past creations, and in accordance with those deeds, a new creation is made for the fulfilment of the law of karma. Shaivas believe that there are cycles of creations in which souls gravitate to specific bodies in accordance with karma, which as an unintelligent object depends on the will of Shiva alone.

====Srikantha====
Srikantha, another Saivite theologian and proponent of Shiva Advaita, believes that individual souls themselves do things which may be regarded as the cause of their particular actions, or desisting from particular actions, in accordance with the nature of the fruition of their past deeds. Srikantha further believes that Shiva only helps a person when he wishes to act in a particular way or to desist from a particular action. Regarding the view that karma produce their own effects directly, Srikantha holds that karma being without any intelligence cannot be expected to produce manifold effects through various births and various bodies; rather fruits of one&#x27;s karma can be performed only by the will of God operating in consonance with man&#x27;s free will, or as determined in later stages by man&#x27;s own karma so the prints of all karma are distributed in the proper order by the grace of God Shiva. In this way, God is ultimately responsible on the one hand for our actions, and on the other for enjoyment and suffering in accordance with our karmas, without any prejudice to humans&#x27; moral responsibility as expressed through free will or as determined later by our own deeds.

===Vaishnavism===
====Sacred texts====
=====Bhagavata Purana=====
In Chapter 1 of 10th book of the Bhagavata Purana, Vasudeva, the father of Krishna, exhorts Kamsa to refrain from killing his wife, Devaki, the mother of Krishna, by stating that death is certain for those who are born and when the body returns to the five elements, the soul leaves the body and helplessly obtains another form in accordance with the laws of karma, citing passages from Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, IV:4:3. Moreover, he adds and states that the soul materializes into an appropriate body whatever the state of the mind one remembers at the time of death; i.e., at the time of the death, the soul and its subtle body of mind, intelligence and ego, is projected into the womb of a creature, human or non-human that can provide a gross body that is most suitable for the dominant state of the mind of the particular person at the time of death; note that this passage is similar in meaning as Bhagavad Gita, VIII, verse 6.

=====Vishnu Sahasranama=====

Many names in the Vishnu Sahasranama, the thousand names of Vishnu allude to the power of God in controlling karma. For example, the 135th name of Vishnu, Dharmadhyaksha, in the Advaita philosopher Sankara&#x27;s interpretation means, &quot;One who directly sees the merits (Dharma) and demerits (Adharma), of beings by bestowing their due rewards on them.&quot;

Other names of Vishnu alluding to this nature of God are Bhavanah, the 32nd name, Vidhata, the 44th name, Apramattah, the 325th name, Sthanadah, the 387th name and Srivibhavanah, the 609th name. Bhavanah, according to Sankara&#x27;s interpretation, means &quot;One who generates the fruits of Karmas of all Jivas (souls) for them to enjoy.&quot; The Brahma Sutra (3.2.28) &quot;Phalmatah upapatteh&quot; speaks of the Lord&#x27;s function as the bestower of the fruits of all actions of the jivas.

====Other Vaishnavite thoughts====
Kulashekhara Alwar, a Vaishnava devotee, says in his &quot;Mukundamala Stotra&quot;: &#x27;yad yad bhavyam bhavatu bhagavan purva-karma-anurupam&#x27;. And purva-karma or bhaagya or daiva is unseen adrsta by us, and is known only to God as Vidhaataa. God created the law of karma, and God will not violate it. God does, however, give courage and strength if asked.

==Dharmaśāstras==

In Hinduism, more particularly the Dharmaśāstras, Karma is a principle in which &quot;cause and effect are as inseparably linked in the moral sphere as assumed in the physical sphere by science. A good action has its reward and a bad action leads to retribution. If the bad actions do not yield their consequences in this life, the soul begins another existence and in the new environment undergoes suffering for its past deeds&quot;. Thus it is important to understand that karma does not go away; one must either reap the benefits or suffer the consequences of his past actions. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad states, &quot;According as a man acts and according as he believes so will he be; a man of meritorious acts will be meritorious, a man of evil deeds sinful. He becomes pure by pure deeds and evil by evil deeds. And here they say that person consists of desires. And as is his desire so is his will; and as is his will, so is his deed; and whatever deeds he does that he will reap&quot;. The doctrine of karma dates from ancient times and besides the above author is mentioned in the Gautama dharma-sutra, Shatapatha Brahmana, Kathaaka-grey-sutra, Chandogya Upanishad, Markandeya Purana, and many others.

The shastras written about karma go into some detail about possible consequences of karma. There is often talk about coming back as a variety of different objects when it comes to reincarnation and pasts lives. In this case, it holds true, or at least insofar as the texts state. The Kathaaka-grhya-sutra states, &quot;some human beings enter the womb in order to have an embodied existence; others go into inorganic matter (the stump of a tree and the like) according to their deeds and according to their knowledge&quot;.

More extensively discussed is the consequences of karma in relation to sin. &quot;Karmavipaka means the ripening (or fruition) of evil actions or sins. This fruition takes three forms, as stated in the Yogasutra II. 3, i.e., jati (birth as a worm or animal), ayuh (life i.e. living for a short period such as five or ten years) and bhoga (experiencing the torments of Hell&quot;.

==Vedas==
In Vedantic literature, there is an analogy. The bowman has already sent an arrow and it has left his hands. He cannot recall it. He is about to shoot another arrow. The bundle of arrows in the quiver on his back is the sanchita; the arrow he has shot is prarabdha; and the arrow which he is about to shoot from his bow is &quot;agami&quot;. Of these, he has perfect control over the sanchita and the agami/Kriyamana, but he must surely work out his prarabdha. The past which has begun to take effect he has to experience.

There is another analogy also. The granary represents the sanchita karma; that portion taken from the granary and put in the shop for future daily sale corresponds to agami; that which is sold daily represents prarabdha.

== Bhagavad Gita ==
In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna differentiates between &quot;karma&quot; motivated by desire and &quot;karma yoga&quot; (selfless action performed as duty). Krishna teaches Arjuna that one must act according to &quot;dharma&quot; (righteous duty) without attachment to the results. While karma (including Vedic rituals) is usually performed for personal gain, &quot;karma yoga&quot; is action carried out with detachment, guided by wisdom (buddhi). In Chapter 2, verses 47-53, Krishna teaches that one has a right only to action, not its fruits, and instructs Arjuna to remain steadfast in yoga, treating success and failure with equanimity.

==Free will limited by karma==

The doctrine of karma explains that while &quot;prarabdha&quot; &quot;karma&quot; shapes current life, we still have the free will to make choices in the present. These choices create &quot;agami karma&quot; (karma that affects our future). The present situation is influenced by the personal choices made through past actions, and the free will to make choices in the present shapes our future.

According to Swami Mukundananda&#x27;s interpretation of Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 18, verse 63:

Karma is not the only factor for fate, and therefore, the Hindu concept of fate is not deterministic or fatalistic. Along with an individual&#x27;s actions, gods, personalized time, death, or nature can influence fate.

==Mitigation of bad karma==
According to a theistic view, the effects of one&#x27;s bad karma may be mitigated. Examples of how bad karma can be mitigated include the following virtue, or living virtuously; performing good deeds, such as helping others; yoga, or worshiping God to receive grace; and conducting pilgrimages to sacred places, such as or to get the grace of God. In another example, Ganesha can unweave his devotees from their karma, simplifying and purifying their lives, but this only happens after they have established a personal relationship with Him.

===Upanishads===

Shvetashvatara Upanishad 7 and 12 aver that the doer of the deeds wanders about and obtains rebirth according to his deeds but postulates an omnipotent creator, i.e., Isvara and the doctrine of grace. Isvara is the great refuge of all and a person attains immortality when blessed by Isvara or at Isvara&#x27;s pleasure.

A person can be free from sorrow through the grace of Isvara. Therefore, the Shvetashvatara Upanishad postulates a supreme Being whose grace to devotees provides a way of escape from the law of karma.
As Adi Sankara stated in his commentary on Shvetashvatara Upanishad VI:4, &quot;If we dedicate all our works to Ishvara, we will not be subject to the law of karma.&quot;

==Relation between birth in a particular body to karma==

Theistic schools believe in cycles of creations where souls gravitate to specific bodies in accordance with karma, which as an unintelligent object depends on the will of God alone. For example, Kaushitaki Upanishad 1.2 asserts that birth in different forms of existence as a worm, insect, fish, bird, lion, boar, snake or a human, is determined by a person&#x27;s deeds and knowledge.

Chandogya Upanishad 5.10.7 distinguishes between a good birth such as a birth in a spiritual family, i.e., (brahmin caste) or an evil birth, such as birth as a dog or hog.) Thus, the doctrine of karma comes to explain why different life forms manifest, into widely various levels of biological development such as characterization into different species from plants to various types of animals, and even differences between members of the same species, such as humans.

Swami Nikilananda comments: As the rivers, following their different courses, ultimately merge in the ocean and give up their names and forms, so the devotees, losing their names and forms, become one with the Supreme Reality.

==Relation between astrology and karma==

According to Charles Keyes and Valentine Daniel, many Hindus believe that heavenly bodies, including the planets, have an influence throughout the life of a human being, and these planetary influences are the &quot;fruit of karma.&quot; The Navagraha and planetary deities, including Shani (Saturn), are considered subordinate to Ishvara (i.e., the Supreme Being) and are believed by many to assist in the administration of justice. Such planetary influences are believed by many to be measurable using astrological methods including Jyotiṣa, the Hindu system of astrology.

== Karma and Samadhi ==
In his commentary on Yoga Sutra I.50, Vijnanabhiksu shares the view of the relationship between karma and samadhi in Samkhya and Vedanta. According to Vijnanabhiksu, the samskaras (impressions) associated with wisdom only eliminate the &quot;sanchita&quot; (dormant and unmanifest) &quot;karma&quot;, not the &quot;prarabdha&quot; &quot;karma&quot;, which has already been activated. Samadhi is said to eliminate all dormant karma. However, the karma already active in the yogi&#x27;s present life, such as their lifespan, body type, and ongoing experiences, continues until the yogi reaches &quot;nirbija samadhi&quot;.

==Other uses in Hinduism==
Other uses include such expressions such as &quot;ugra-karma&quot;, meaning bitter, unwholesome labor.

<text>The Sri Lanka national football team ( &quot;Shri Lanka Papandu Kandayama&quot;, &quot;Ilaṅkai Tēciya Kālpantu Aṇi&quot;) represents Sri Lanka in Association football and is administered by Football Federation of Sri Lanka, the governing body of football in Sri Lanka. They have been a member of FIFA since 1952 and a member of AFC since 1954. Sri Lanka&#x27;s home stadium is the Sugathadasa Stadium in Colombo. The Sri Lankan team was known as the Ceylon national football team until 1972 when Ceylon was renamed Sri Lanka.

A member of the AFC, the team has yet to make their first appearance in FIFA World Cup or AFC Asian Cup finals. They have been South Asian champions once, in 1995. As is true elsewhere on the sub-continent, top-level football in Sri Lanka stands somewhat in the shadow of the country&#x27;s Cricket team. However, the side did reach the second qualification stage for the 2006 World Cup. In the same year, they became the runners-up in the 2006 Challenge Cup.

In the qualification round of the 2018 World Cup, Sri Lanka lost both matches against Bhutan and failed to qualify for the next round. However, Sri Lanka national football team had managed to qualify for the semi-finals of the 2015 SAFF Championship.

== History ==

=== Early history (1890s–2014) ===
Football was introduced to Sri Lanka (then called Ceylon) by the British. There is evidence of it being played in Galle Face, a sandy area near the coast, by British servicemen stationed in Colombo in the 1890s. The game was also played at grounds of the barracks at Echelon Barracks and the army grounds (presently the Taj Samudra Hotels).

British servicemen of the Royal Air Force, Royal Navy, Royal Engineers, Royal Artillery and the Royal Garrison Command began and promoted competitive football in Ceylon. The British administrative service and the planting community enthusiastically took it to the Central, Southern, and Up-Country regions. By early 1900 competitive football was popular with the local youth.

The game became popular and local football clubs were formed. St. Michael&#x27;s SC, Havelock&#x27;s Football Club, Java Lane SC, Wekande SC, Moors FC, and CH &amp; FC, the last being a European monopoly, were some of the first clubs in Columbo. Harlequins FC and Saunders SC soon joined. The trophies of the early tournaments were the De Mel Shield and the Times of Ceylon Cup.

Football also became popular in the country&#x27;s Southern Provence, where the planting and administrative community promoted the game. British planter T R. Brough in Deniyaya heavily promoted football in the south between 1910 and 1920, and British servicemen from the Navy wireless station in Matara also helped popularise it.

In 1952, Ceylon became a member of FIFA and gained the opportunity to play football at the international level. The country&#x27;s first international game was played against India in the 1952 Asian Quadrangular Football Tournament, organized by The Ceylon Football Association.

On 24 October 1953, Tom Ossen, a product of Dharmaraja College, scored the country&#x27;s first official international goal against Burma at the 1953 Asian Quadrangular Football Tournament. The game ended in a 2–3 defeat, with T. J. Azeez netting Ceylon&#x27;s second goal.

=== Renaissance of Sri Lanka football (2015–2019) ===

In 2015, Sri Lanka played for the first time in the Bangabandhu Cup. This tournament was organised by Bangladesh Football Federation. The national U-23 teams of Thailand, Bahrain, Malaysia and Singapore participated in this tournament. The national football teams of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka also competed in this tournament.

Sri Lanka was placed in the group with Malaysia and Bangladesh. In the first game Sri Lanka played against the Malaysian team. Malaysia won the match by 2–0. The second match was played against the host Bangladesh. Sri Lanka lost the game 1–0. Sri Lanka failed to score a goal in this tournament. After a six years of poor performance in the international football field Sri Lanka football team managed to qualify for the Semi Final of 2015 SAFF Championship. The poor performance continued in the Solidarity Cup as well. They had another shock defeat this time by the hands of Mongolia the lowest ranked team in Asia. As a result of this defeat Sri Lanka eliminated in the group stage of the tournament.

In July 2018, Sri Lanka welcomed a historical encounter when they faced Lithuania, marked for the first time Sri Lanka will face a European team. The Sri Lankans managed a respectable 0–0 draw to the UEFA side but lost 0–2 in the second encounter. During 2022 World Cup campaign however, Sri Lanka suffered another poor performance as the team fell 0–1 in Zhuhai to Macau. Macau was subsequently disqualified, as the team refused to travel to Sri Lanka in the aftermath of 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings, Sri Lanka was awarded a 3–0 win in response, thus qualified to the second round of the World Cup for the first time since 2006 campaign.

=== Amir Alagic era (2020–2022) ===

In the second round, Sri Lanka was unlucky to be drawn with four 2019 AFC Asian Cup participants, South Korea, North Korea, Lebanon and Turkmenistan. As predicted, Sri Lanka proved too weak for the group, losing all matches without scoring a single goal as for the end of 2019, and was eliminated from World Cup contention. Sri Lanka had improved since then, and participated in the 2020 Bangabandhu Cup, but the team still finished bottom with two defeats and no goal.

In February 2020, the Football Federation of Sri Lanka announced the appointment of Bosnian-Australian specialist Amir Alagić as head coach of the national team. Sri Lanka then travelled to South Korea to finish their two remaining games against Lebanon and South Korea, losing both, yet optimism rose when Sri Lanka demonstrated an outstanding performance against Lebanon, scoring two goals and only lost by one goal margin, which was also the country&#x27;s first-ever goals in the qualification. Alagić resigned as coach of Sri Lanka after the qualification, as Sri Lanka, rated as the weakest team in the group, were eliminated without scoring a point. He was replaced by Scottish manager, Andy Morrison.

=== FIFA suspension and Participation in FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifying (2023) ===
On 22 January 2023, FIFA announced the suspension of the FFSL from 21 January 2023 until further notice due to the government interference in football, but was provisionally included in the draw, pending a resolution. Therefore, all teams/clubs affiliated with the FFSL are no longer entitled to take part in international competitions. However, after the issue was settled, the ban was lifted allowing Sri Lanka to take part in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification under a strict condition: FFSL must conduct a new election ten days before the fixture against Yemen; failure to do so would result in automatic disqualification of the team. The suspension was lifted on 29 August 2023.

Sri Lanka then participated in the first round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification facing against Yemen on 12 October 2023 but lost 4–1 on aggregate in the process. In September 2024, Sri Lanka then played in the 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualification play-off round against Cambodia in which the aggregate was tied on 2–2 where Claudio Kammerknecht scored in the 120+2th minute in extra time to send the game to penalties shoot-out. Sri Lanka came out victorious thus qualifying to the third round.

=== 2027 Asia Cup Qualification (2024–2025) ===
The Sri Lanka national football team began their 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualification campaign by integrating players of Sri Lankan origin from overseas, including Claudio Kammerknecht and Marvin Hamilton. Their contributions were pivotal in the team’s penalty shoot-out victory over Cambodia in the play-off round, securing a place in the third round.

In September 2024, Mohamed Al-Mutairi was appointed as head coach to prepare the team for the next stage of qualification. Sri Lanka is scheduled to play six international friendlies in 2025 to build match fitness and test tactical adjustments ahead of the third round. 

The third round of qualification will take place in 2025, where Sri Lanka has been drawn into Group D alongside Thailand, Turkmenistan, and Chinese Taipei. The matches are scheduled to be played on a home-and-away basis between 25 March 2025 and 31 March 2026 for Sri Lanka.

Only the group winners will advance to the AFC Asian Cup Saudi Arabia 2027 Finals.

=== Media coverage ===
There is no official TV broadcaster for the football matches played by the Sri Lanka team because the Football Federation of Sri Lanka has not sold broadcasting rights. The SAFF Championship was broadcast by several channels, and tournaments in the 1990s and 2000s were broadcast free-to-air by Channel Eye. The 2013 SAFF Championship was broadcast by CSN. Star Sports also broadcast the SAFF Championship on pay TV satellite broadcasters.

The official online broadcaster of Sri Lankan football matches is thepapare.com which streams the games of the Sri Lanka Football Premier League, the finals of the Sri Lanka FA Cup, and the AFC U-19 Championship.

<doc id="1272984" wikidata="Q1229353" url="?curid=1272984" title="Distal radius fracture">
<text>A distal radius fracture, also known as wrist fracture, is a break of the part of the radius bone which is close to the wrist. Symptoms include pain, bruising, and rapid-onset swelling. The ulna bone may also be broken.
In younger people, these fractures typically occur during sports or a motor vehicle collision. In older people, the most common cause is falling on an outstretched hand. Specific types include Colles, Smith, Barton, and Chauffeur&#x27;s fractures. The diagnosis is generally suspected based on symptoms and confirmed with X-rays.
Treatment is with casting for six weeks or surgery. Surgery is generally indicated if the joint surface is broken and does not line up, the radius is overly short, or the joint surface of the radius is tilted more than 10% backwards. Among those who are cast, repeated X-rays are recommended within three weeks to verify that a good position is maintained.
Distal radius fractures are common, and are the most common type of fractures that are seen in children. Distal radius fractures represent between 25% and 50% of all broken bones and occur most commonly in young males and older females. A year or two may be required for healing to occur. Most children with a buckle wrist fracture experience a broken wrist for life and do have an increased chance of re-fracturing the same spot or other adverse effects.
==Signs and symptoms==
People usually present with a history of falling on an outstretched hand and complaint of pain and swelling around the wrist, sometimes with deformity around the wrist. Any numbness should be asked to exclude median and ulnar nerve injuries. Any pain in the limb of the same side should also be investigated to exclude associated injuries to the same limb.

Swelling, deformity, tenderness, and loss of wrist motion are normal features on examination of a person with a distal radius fracture. &quot;Dinner fork&quot; deformity of the wrist is caused by dorsal displacement of the carpal bones (Colle&#x27;s fracture). Reverse deformity is seen in volar angulation (Smith&#x27;s fracture). The wrist may be radially deviated due to shortening of the radius bone. Examination should also rule out a skin wound which might suggest an open fracture, usually at the side. Tenderness at an area with no obvious deformity may still point to underlying fractures. Decreased sensation especially at the tips of the radial three and one half digits ( thumb, index finger, middle finger and radial portion of the ring finger ) can be due to median nerve injury. Swelling and displacement can cause compression on the median nerve which results in acute carpal tunnel syndrome and requires prompt treatment. Very rarely, pressure on the muscle components of the hand or forearm is sufficient to create a compartment syndrome which can manifest as severe pain and sensory deficits in the hand.

=== Complications ===
Nonunion is rare; almost all of these fractures heal. Malunion, however, is not uncommon, and can lead to residual pain, grip weakness, reduced range of motion (especially rotation), and persistent deformity. Symptomatic malunion may require additional surgery. If the joint surface is damaged and heals with more than 1–2 mm of unevenness, the wrist joint will be prone to post-traumatic osteoarthritis. Half of nonosteoporotic patients will develop post-traumatic arthritis, specifically limited radial deviation and wrist flexion. This arthritis can worsen over time. Displaced fractures of the ulnar styloid base associated with a distal radius fracture result in instability of the DRUJ and resulting loss of forearm rotation.

Nerve injury, especially of the median nerve and presenting as carpal tunnel syndrome, is commonly reported following distal radius fractures. Tendon injury can occur in people treated both nonoperatively and operatively, most commonly to the extensor pollicis longus tendon. This can be due to the tendon coming in contact with protruding bone or with hardware placed following surgical procedures.

Complex regional pain syndrome is also associated with distal radius fractures, and can present with pain, swelling, changes in color and temperature, and/or joint contracture. The cause for this condition is unknown.

==Cause==

The most common cause of this type of fracture is a fall on an outstretched hand from standing height, although some fractures will be due to high-energy injury. People who fall on the outstretched hand are usually fitter and have better reflexes when compared to those with elbow or humerus fractures. The characteristics of distal radius fractures are influenced by the position of the hand at the time of impact, the type of surface at point of contact, the speed of the impact, and the strength of the bone. Distal radius fractures typically occur with the wrist bent back from 60 to 90 degrees. Radial styloid fracture would occur if the wrist is ulnar deviated and vice versa. If the wrist is bent back less, then proximal forearm fracture would occur, but if the bending back is more, then the carpal bones fracture would occur. With increased bending back, more force is required to produce a fracture. More force is required to produce a fracture in males than females. Risk of injury increases in those with osteoporosis.

Common injuries associated with distal radius fractures are interosseous intercarpal ligaments injuries, especially scapholunate (4.7% to 46% of cases) and lunotriquetral ligaments (12% to 34% of cases) injuries. There is an increased risk of interosseous intercarpal injury if the ulnar variance (the difference in height between the distal end of the ulna and the distal end of the radius) is more than 2mm and there is fracture into the wrist joint. Triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injury occurs in 39% to 82% of cases. Ulnar styloid process fracture increases the risk of TFCC injury by a factor of 5:1. However, it is unclear whether intercarpal ligaments and triangular fibrocartilage injuries are associated with long term pain and disability for those who are affected.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis may be evident clinically when the distal radius is deformed, but should be confirmed by X-ray.
The differential diagnosis includes scaphoid fractures and wrist dislocations, which can also co-exist with a distal radius fracture. Occasionally, fractures may not be seen on X-rays immediately after the injury. Delayed X-rays, X-ray computed tomography (CT scan), or Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can confirm the diagnosis.

===Medical imaging===

X-ray of the affected wrist is required if a fracture is suspected. Posteroanterior, lateral, and oblique views can be used together to describe the fracture. X-ray of the uninjured wrist should also be taken to determine if any normal anatomic variations exist before surgery.

A CT scan is often performed to further investigate the articular anatomy of the fracture, especially for fracture and displacement within the distal radio-ulnar joint.

Various kinds of information can be obtained from X-rays of the wrist:

Lateral view
* Carpal malalignment - A line is drawn along the long axis of the capitate bone and another line is drawn along the long axis of the radius. If the carpal bones are aligned, both lines will intersect within the carpal bones. If the carpal bones are not aligned, both lines will intersect outside the carpal bones. Carpal malignment is frequently associated with dorsal or volar tilt of the radius and will have poor grip strength and poor forearm rotation.
* Tear drop angle - It is the angle between the line that pass through the central axis of the volar rim of the lunate facet of the radius and the line that pass through the long axis of the radius. Tear drop angle less than 45 degrees indicates displacement of lunate facet.
* Antero-posterior distance (AP distance) - Seen on lateral X-ray, it is the distance between the dorsal and volar rim of the lunate facet of the radius. The usual distance is 19 mm. Increased AP distance indicates the lunate facet fracture.
* Volar or dorsal tilt - A line is drawn joining the most distal ends of the volar and dorsal side of the radius. Another line perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the radius is drawn. The angle between the two lines is the angle of volar or dorsal tilt of the wrist. Measurement of volar or dorsal tilt should be made in true lateral view of the wrist because pronation of the forearm reduces the volar tilt and supination increases it. When dorsal tilt is more than 11 degrees, it is associated with loss of grip strength and loss of wrist flexion.

Posteroanterior view
* Radial inclination - It is the angle between a line drawn from the radial styloid to the medial end of the articular surface of the radius and a line drawn perpendicular to the long axis of the radius. Loss of radial inclination is associated with loss of grip strength.
* Radial length - It is the vertical distance in millimetres between a line tangential to the articular surface of the ulna and a tangential line drawn at the most distal point of radius (radial styloid). Shortening of radial length more than 4mm is associated with wrist pain.
* Ulnar variance - It is the vertical distance between a horizontal line parallel to the articular surface of the radius and another horizontal line drawn parallel to the articular surface of the ulnar head. Positive ulnar variance (ulna appears longer than radius) disturbs the integrity of triangular fibrocartilage complex and is associated with loss of grip strength and wrist pain.

Oblique view
* Pronated oblique view of the distal radius helps to show the degree of comminution of the distal end radius, depression of the radial styloid, and confirming the position the screws at the radial side of the distal end radius. Meanwhile, a supinated oblique view of shows the ulnar side of the distal radius, accessing the depression of dorsal rim of the lunate facet, and the position of the screws on the ulnar side of the distal end radius.

===Classification===

There are many classification systems for distal radius fracture. AO/OTA classification is adopted by Orthopaedic Trauma Association and is the most commonly used classification system. There are three major groups: A—extra-articular, B—partial articular, and C—complete articular which can further subdivided into nine main groups and 27 subgroups depending on the degree of communication and direction of displacement. However, none of the classification systems demonstrate good liability. A qualification modifier (Q) is used for associated ulnar fracture.

For children and adolescents, there are three main categories of fracture: buckle (torus) fractures, greenstick fractures, and complete (or off-ended) fractures. Buckle fractures are an incomplete break in the bone that involves the cortex (outside) of the bone. Buckle fractures are stable and are the most common type. Greenstick fractures are a bone that is broken only on one side and the bone bows to the other side. Greenstick fractures are unstable and often occur in younger children. Complete fractures, where the bone is completely broken, are unstable. In a complete fracture the bone can be misaligned. For a complete fracture, a closed fractures are those in which the skin and tissue lying over the bone is intact. An open fracture (exposed bone) is a serious injury.

== Treatment ==

Correction should be undertaken if the wrist radiology falls outside the acceptable limits:
* 2-3mm positive ulnar variance
* There should be no carpus malalignment 
* If carpus is aligned, then the dorsal tilt should be less than 10 degrees
* If carpus is aligned, there are no limits for palmar tilt
* If carpus is malaligned, wrist tilt should be neutral
* Gap or step deformity is less than 2mm

Treatment options for distal radius fractures include nonoperative management, external fixation, and internal fixation. Indications for each depend on a variety of factors such as the patient&#x27;s age, initial fracture displacement, and metaphyseal and articular alignment, with the ultimate goal to maximize strength and function in the affected upper extremity. Surgeons use these factors combined with radiologic imaging to predict fracture instability, and functional outcome to help decide which approach would be most appropriate. Treatment is often directed to restore normal anatomy to avoid the possibility of malunion, which may cause decreased strength in the hand and wrist. The decision to pursue a specific type of management varies greatly by geography, physician specialty (hand surgeons vs. orthopedic surgeons), and advancements in new technology such as the volar locking plating system.

Distal radius fractures are often associated with distal radial ulnar joint (DRUJ) injuries, and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons recommends that postreduction lateral wrist X-rays should be obtained in all patients with distal radius fractures in order to preclude DRUJ injuries or dislocations.

Most children with these types of fractures do not need surgery.

=== Nonoperative ===
The majority of distal radius fractures are treated with conservative nonoperative management, which involves immobilization through application of plaster or splint with or without closed reduction. The prevalence of nonoperative approach to distal radius fractures is around 70%. Nonoperative management is indicated for fractures that are undisplaced, or for displaced fractures that are stable following reduction. Variations in immobilization techniques involve the type of cast, position of immobilization, and the length of time required in the cast.

====Undisplaced fractures====
For those with low demand, cast and splint can be applied for two weeks. In those who are young and active, if the fracture is not displaced, the patient can be followed up in one week. If the fracture is still undisplaced, cast and splint can be applied for three weeks. If the fracture is displaced, then manipulative reduction or surgical stabilisation is required. Shorter immobilization is associated with better recovery when compared to prolonged immobilization. 10% of the minimally displaced fractures will become unstable in the first two weeks and cause malunion. Therefore, follow up within the first week of fracture is important. 22% of the minimally displaced fractures will malunite after two weeks. Subsequent follow ups at two to three weeks are therefore also important. There is weak evidence to suggest that some children with a buckle fracture may not require cast immobilization.

Where the fracture is undisplaced and stable, nonoperative treatment involves immobilization. Initially, a backslab or a sugar tong splint is applied to allow swelling to expand and subsequently a cast is applied. Depending on the nature of the fracture, the cast may be placed above the elbow to control forearm rotation. However, an above-elbow cast may cause long-term rotational contracture. For torus fractures, a splint may be sufficient and casting may be avoided. The position of the wrist in cast is usually slight flexion and ulnar deviation. However, neutral and dorsiflex position may not affect the stability of the fracture.

====Displaced fractures====
In displaced distal radius fracture, in those with low demands, the hand can be cast until the person feels comfortable. If the fracture affects the median nerve, only then is a reduction indicated. If the instability risk is less than 70%, the hand can be manipulated under regional block or general anaesthesia to achieve reduction. If the post reduction radiology of the wrist is acceptable, then the person can come for follow up at one, two, or three weeks to look for any displacement of fractures during this period. If the reduction is maintained, then the cast should continue for 4 to 6 weeks. If the fracture is displaced, surgical management is the proper treatment. If the instability risk of the wrist is more than 70%, then surgical management is required. 43% of displaced fractures will be unstable within the first two weeks and 47% of the remaining unstable fractures will become unstable after two weeks. Therefore, periodic reviews are important to prevent malunion of the displaced fractures.

Closed reduction of a distal radius fracture involves first anesthetizing the affected area with a hematoma block, intravenous regional anesthesia (Bier&#x27;s block), sedation or a general anesthesia. Manipulation generally includes first placing the arm under traction and unlocking the fragments. The deformity is then reduced with appropriate closed manipulative (depending on the type of deformity) reduction, after which a splint or cast is placed and an X-ray is taken to ensure that the reduction was successful. The cast is usually maintained for about 6 weeks.

====Outcome of nonoperative treatment====
Failure of nonoperative treatment leading to functional impairment and anatomic deformity is the largest risk associated with conservative management. Prior studies have shown that the fracture often redisplaces to its original position even in a cast. Only 27-32% of fractures are in acceptable alignment 5 weeks after closed reduction. For those less than 60 years in age, there will be a dorsal angulation of 13 degrees, while for those older than 60, the dorsal angulation can reach as high as 18 degrees. In people over 60, functional impairment can last for more than 10 years.

Despite these risks with nonoperative treatment, more recent systematic reviews suggest that when indicated, nonsurgical management in the elderly population may lead to similar functional outcomes as surgical approaches. In these studies, no significant differences in pain scores, grip strength, and range of motion in patients&#x27; wrists occurred when comparing conservative nonsurgical approaches with surgical management. Although the nonsurgical group exhibited greater anatomic misalignment such as radial deviation, and ulnar variance, these changes did not seem to have significant impact on overall pain and quality of life.

=== Surgery ===
Surgery is generally indicated for displaced or unstable fractures. The techniques of surgical management include open reduction internal fixation (ORIF), external fixation, percutaneous pinning, or some combination of the above. The choice of operative treatment is often determined by the type of fracture, which can be categorized broadly into three groups: partial articular fractures, displaced articular fractures, and metaphyseal unstable extra- or minimal articular fractures.

Significant advances have been made in ORIF treatments. Two newer treatments are fragment-specific fixation and fixed-angle volar plating. These attempt fixation rigid enough to allow almost immediate mobility, in an effort to minimize stiffness and improve ultimate function; no improved final outcome from early mobilization (prior to 6 weeks after surgical fixation) has been shown. Although restoration of radiocarpal alignment is thought to be of obvious importance, the exact amount of angulation, shortening, intra-articular gap/step which impact final function are not exactly known. The alignment of the DRUJ is also important, as this can be a source of a pain and loss of rotation after final healing and maximum recovery.

An arthroscope can be used at the time of fixation to evaluate for soft-tissue injury and the congruity of the joint surface and may increase the accuracy of joint surface alignment Structures at risk include the triangular fibrocartilage complex and the scapholunate ligament. Scapholunate injuries in radial styloid fractures where the fracture line exits distally at the scapholunate interval should be considered. TFCC injuries causing obvious DRUJ instability can be addressed at the time of fixation.

Prognosis varies depending on dozens of variables. If the anatomy (bony alignment) is not properly restored, function may remain poor even after healing. Restoration of bony alignment is not a guarantee of success, as soft tissue contributes significantly to the healing process.

==== Little joint involvement ====
These fractures are the most common of the three groups mentioned above that require surgical management. A minimal articular fracture involves the joint, but does not require reduction of the joint. Manipulative reduction and immobilization were thought to be appropriate for metaphyseal unstable fractures. However, several studies suggest this approach is largely ineffective in patients with high functional demand, and in this case, more stable fixation techniques should be used.

Surgical options have been shown to be successful in patients with unstable extra-articular or minimal articular distal radius fractures. These options include percutaneous pinning, external fixation, and ORIF using plating. Patients with low functional demand of their wrists can be treated successfully with nonsurgical management; however, in more active and fit patients with fractures that are reducible by closed means, nonbridging external fixation is preferred, as it has less serious complications when compared to other surgical options. The most common complication associated with nonbridging external fixation is pin tract infection, which can be managed with antibiotics and frequent dressing changes, and rarely results in reoperation. The external fixator is placed for 5 to 6 weeks and can be removed in an outpatient setting.

If the fractures are unlikely to be reduced by closed means, open reduction with internal plate fixation is preferred. Although major complications (i.e. tendon injury, fracture collapse, or malunion) result in higher reoperation rates (36.5%) compared to external fixation (6%), ORIF is preferred, as this provides better stability and restoration of the volar tilt. Following the operation, a removable splint is placed for 2 weeks, during which time patients should mobilize the wrist as tolerated.

==== Displaced intra-articular fractures ====
These fractures, although less common, often require surgery in active, healthy patients to address displacement of both the joint and the metaphysis. The two mainstays of treatment are bridging external fixation or ORIF. If reduction can be achieved by closed/percutaneous reduction, then open reduction can generally be avoided. Percutaneous pinning is preferred to plating due to similar clinical and radiological outcomes, as well as lower costs, when compared to plating, despite increased risk of superficial infections. Level of joint restoration, as opposed to surgical technique, has been found to be a better indicator of functional outcomes.

==Outcome==
World Health Organization (WHO) divides outcomes into three categories: impairment, disabilities, and handicaps. Impairment is the abnormal physical function, such as lack of forearm rotation. It is measured clinically. Disability is the lack of ability to perform physical daily activities. It is measured by Patient Reported Outome Measures (PROMs). Examples of scoring system based on clinical assessment are: Mayo Wrist Score (for perilunate fracture dislocation), Green and O’Brien Score (carpal dislocation and pain), and Gartland and Werley Score (evaluating distal radius fractures). These scores includes assessment of range of motion, grip strength, ability to perform activities of daily living, and radiological picture. However, none of the three scoring system demonstrated good reliability.

There are also two scoring systems for Patient Reported Outome Measures (PROMs): the Disabilities of Hand, Arm and Shoulder (DASH) Score and the Patient-Related Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) Score. These scoring systems measures the ability of a person to perform a task, pain score, presence of tingling and numbness, the effect on activities of daily living, and self-image. Both scoring systems show good reliability and validity.

=== Age factor ===
In children, the outcome of distal radius fracture is usually very good with healing and return to normal function expected. Some residual deformity is common, but this often remodels as the child grows.

In young patients, the injury requires greater force and results in more displacement, particularly to the articular surface. Unless an accurate reduction of the joint surface is obtained, these patients are very likely to have long-term symptoms of pain, arthritis, and stiffness.

In the elderly, distal radius fractures heal and may result in adequate function following nonoperative treatment. A large proportion of these fractures occur in elderly people who may have less requirement for strenuous use of their wrists. Some of these patients tolerate severe deformities and minor loss of wrist motion very well, even without reduction of the fracture. There is no difference in functional outcomes between operative and non-operative management in the elderly age group, despite better anatomical results in the operative group.

==Epidemiology==
Distal radius fractures are the most common fractures seen in adults and children. Distal radius fractures account for 18% of all adult fractures with an approximate rate of 23.6 to 25.8 per 100,000 per year. For children, both boys and girls have a similar incidence of these types of fractures, however the peak ages differ slightly. Girls peak at 11 years old and boys peak at 14 years old (the age that children experience the most fractures). For adults, incidences in females outnumber incidences in males by a factor of three to two. In adults, the average age of occurrence is between 57 and 66 years. Men who sustain distal radius fractures are usually younger, generally in their 40s (vs. 60s in females). Low energy injury (usually fall from standing height) is the usual cause of distal end radius fracture (66 to 77% of cases). High energy injuries accounts for 10% of wrist fractures. About 57% to 66% of the fractures are extra-articular fractures, 9% to 16% are partial-articular fractures, and 25% to 35% are complete articular fractures. Unstable metaphyseal fractures are ten times more common than severe articular fractures. Older people with osteoporosis who are still active are at an increased risk of getting distal radius fractures.

==History==

Before the 18th century, distal radius fracture was believed to be due to dislocation of the carpal bones or the displacement of the distal radioulnar articulation. In the 18th century, Petit first suggested that these types of injuries might be due to fractures rather than dislocations. Another author, Pouteau, suggested the common mechanism of injury which leads to this type of fractures - injury to the wrist when a person falls on an outstretched hand with dorsal displacement of the wrist. However, he also suggested that volar displacement of the wrist was due to the ulnar fracture. His work was met with skepticism from colleagues and little recognition, since the article was published after he died. In 1814, Abraham Colles described the characteristics of distal end radius fracture. In 1841, Guilaume Dupuytren acknowledged the contributions by Petit and Pouteau, agreeing that the distal end radius fracture is indeed a fracture, not a dislocation. In 1847, Malgaigne described the mechanism of injury for distal end radius fractures that can be caused by falling on the outstretched hand or on the back of the hand and also the consequences if the hand fracture is not treated adequately. After that, Robert William Smith, professor of surgery in Dublin, Ireland, first described the characteristics of volar displacement of distal radius fractures. In 1895, with the advent of X-rays, the visualisation of the distal radius fracture became more apparent. Lucas-Champonnière first described the management of fractures using massage and early mobilization techniques. Anaesthesia, aseptic technique, immobilization and external fixation have all contributed to the management of fixation of distal radius fracture. Ombredanne, a Parisian surgeon in 1929, first reported the use of nonbridging external fixation in the management of distal radius fractures. Bridging external fixation was introduced by Roger Anderson and Gordon O’Neill from Seattle in 1944 due to poor results in conservative management (using orthopaedic cast) of distal end radius fractures. Raoul Hoffman of Geneva designed orthopaedic clamps, which allow adjustments of the external fixator to reduce the fractures by closed reduction. In 1907, percutaneous pinning was first used. This was followed by the use of plating in 1965.

<text>Jovan Cvijić (, ; 1865 – 16 January 1927) was a Serbian geographer and ethnologist, president of the Serbian Royal Academy of Sciences and rector of the University of Belgrade. Cvijić is considered the founder of geography in Serbia. He began his scientific career as a geographer and geologist, and continued his activity as a human geographer and sociologist. He initiated the &quot;Serbian Ethnographic Collection&quot; (&quot;Srpski etnološki zbornik&quot;), within which 102 books were published, representing a unique scientific and interdisciplinary project on a global scale. Jovan Cvijić received numerous awards and medals, both domestically and internationally, for his work.

== Early life and family ==

Cvijić was born in Loznica, in the westernmost part of the Principality of Serbia. His family was part of the Spasojević branch of the Piva tribe (&quot;Pivljani&quot;) in Old Herzegovina (currently Montenegro). Cvijić&#x27;s father, Todor, was a merchant; his grandfather, Živko, was head of Loznica and a supporter of the House of Obrenović in Mačva. Živko fought in the 1844 Katana Uprising against the Defenders of the Constitution, and died after torture.

Cvijić&#x27;s great-grandfather, Cvijo Spasojević, patriarch of the Cvijić family, was a &quot;hajduk&quot; leader in Old Herzegovina who fought in the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire. After its failure in 1813, he moved to Loznica, built a house and opened a store.

His father, Todor (d. 1900), was a trader before accepting a clerkship in the municipality. Cvijić&#x27;s mother, Marija (), was from a family in the village of Korenita in the Jadar region (near Tronoša and Tršić, the birthplace of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić). Todor and Marija had two sons, Živko and Jovan, and three daughters. Cvijić often said that in his childhood his spiritual education was primarily influenced by his mother and her family; he said less about his father and his father&#x27;s family. However, in his works on ethnic psychology, Cvijić praised the Dinaric race of his father.

== Education ==

After completing elementary school, Cvijić attended grammar school in Loznica where he took an interest in literature and learned French and German.

He continued his education in Šabac before embarking to the First Belgrade Gymnasium to study medicine, graduating in 1884.

After graduation, he wanted to study medicine, but Loznica could not provide him a scholarship to study abroad. A grammar-school teacher suggested that he attend geography classes at the &quot;Velika skola&quot; in Belgrade (now the University of Belgrade). Cvijić took his advice, enrolling in the natural sciences department and graduating in 1889.
Cvijić taught at the Second Male Grammar School in Belgrade and in the meantime published his first geographical work on the Karst landscape in 1889 after a trip to the eastern countryside of Serbia piqued his interest.

He enrolled at Vienna University where he studied physical geography and geology under the tutelages of scholars like Albrecht Penck, Professor Suess (president of the Austrian Academy) and Julius von Hann. He received his PhD from Vienna University in 1893. His thesis &quot;Das Karstphänomen&quot;, introduced the sub-discipline study of Karst geomorphology.

Soon afterwards, Cvijić would tour the Balkans to conduct fieldwork and research.

In 1911, Cvijić married Ljubica Nikolić, a widow from Belgrade, née Krstić (1879–1941).

== Research ==

Cvijić&#x27;s work can be compartmentalized into five sections: the karst, glaciations in the Balkan mountains, tectonic elements in the peninsula, lakes and human geography. Much of his research was complicated by the tense political situations with the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman authorities, dangerous and remote areas and lack of suitable roads and maps.

In the mid 1890s, Cvijić&#x27;s excursions took him first to eastern Serbia and then to Bulgaria, where he visited the area around the Rila mountain range. Later, he focused on the mountains of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, studying the karst and tectonic structure, looking for evidence of glaciations, leading him to publish &quot;Papers on the glacial epoch in the Balkan peninsula&quot;.

He was interested in geology and geomorphology. Cvijić&#x27;s monograph on lime karst was well received in European scientific circles, and an introductory academic lecture established him as the first South Slavic tectonicist. The Serbian lime fields had been studied only peripherally by Otto von Pirch (1830), Ami Boué (1840), Felix Philipp Kanitz, Milan Milićević, Jovan Žujović and Vladimir Karić before him.

Cvijić conducted a pioneering human-geographical survey in &quot;Balkan Peninsula 1918&quot;, 1922–I, 1931–II, based on his research of Balkan personality types. He researched for 38 years, leading expeditions in the Balkans, the southern Carpathian Mountains and Anatolia which produced a number of research papers. Cvijić&#x27;s two-volume &quot;Geomorphology&quot; is an important starting point for research into the Balkan peninsula.

=== Karst geomorphology ===
When studying under Albrecht Penck&#x27;s tutelage he was encouraged to focus on the study of karst phenomena in the northern Dinaric Alps which was a region Penck was already acknowledged with. His first major work was &quot;Das Karstphänomen&quot; published in 1893. This work was a publication of the key points of his doctoral thesis. &quot;Das Karstphänomen&quot; was published as a slightly modified translation in Serbo-Croat in 1895. This work describes landforms such as karren, dolines and poljes. In a 1918 publication, Cvijić proposed a cyclical model for karstic landscape development. The results of this work written in French were made accessible to English-language scientists in 1921 when it was commented by E.M. Sanders. Differences in climate and geology were used by Cvijić to explain various shapes and types of karst landforms, sometimes incorrectly. Nevertheless, his views on the role of climate on the development of karst were more accurate than those of various climatic geomorphologists that succeeded him and who greatly exaggerated the role of climate.

It has been attributed to Cvijić that the term karst prevailed over Edouard Martel&#x27;s proposed term &quot;Le Causse&quot;. Another terminology usage indebted to Cvijić is that of doline, a term he introduced, and that overlaps with that of sinkhole. Eventually, Cvijić emerged as the &quot;father of karst geomorphology&quot;.

=== Human geography ===
In 1896 Cvijić published &quot;Instructions for studying villages in Serbia and other Serbian lands&quot;, which was later revised to apply to other Balkan regions.

Concurrently, he developed an interest in the life of people living in the Balkans. His travels took him to Macedonia and its lakes, the coastlines of Albania and Greece, to Lake Skadar and Lake Pamvotida. In 1902 he published his first work on human geography. In 1906 he published his signature monograph &quot;Basics of Geography and Geology of Macedonia and Old Serbia&quot;, which would become a staple reference for future researchers.

He published detailed instructions for conducting field research into populations and habitats to help his colleagues, including the 1907 article &quot;On scientific research and our University&quot;.

Cvijić&#x27;s thesis on the effects of climate and geography on human life is the basis of his approach to human geography, where he emphasizes that humankind is ecologically sensitive. When classifying anthropological types Cvijić considered social structure (work, endogamy, exogamy and migration) the primary factor, stressing the effects of the physical environment on a population&#x27;s psyche. His basic concepts are presented in the 1902 Balkan-peninsula paper, &quot;Human-geography problems&quot;. Influenced by Cvijić&#x27;s paper, Milorad Dragić (a former student) elaborated on psychological anthropological research in his 1911 paper &quot;Instructions for studying settlements and psychological characteristics&quot; (after which Cvijić expanded his thesis on &quot;The Balkan peninsula and South Slavic lands&quot; in Serbian).

Cvijić introduced the term &#x27;metanastasic movements&#x27;, which referred to slow, gradual, a place-to-place human movement. He and his students took wide exploration of this phenomenon, eventually establishing the Serbian ethnological-historic school which gathered ethnological material from all around the Balkan peninsula and encompassed exploration of written sources.

The sparking of interest in human-geographical and ethnographical research was one of the greatest achievements of Cvijić&#x27;s scientific career. His efforts and research helped him gather crucial data, which he used during negotiations on the state borders of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia after World War I.

==== Influence on Yugoslav state borders ====
After the conclusion of World War I, Cvijić was invited to the Paris Peace Conference as an expert on border delineation. Using ethnographic charts, Cvijić demonstrated the geographical distribution of the various Balkan peoples which helped determine the borders of a new country: the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. It was agreed that the new country should incorporate Banat, Bačka, Baranya and Carniola as well as the Bled triangle (Bled, Bohinj and Triglav).

== Teaching ==
After Cvijić&#x27;s return from Vienna in March 1893 he became a professor in the Faculty of Philosophy of the &quot;Velika Skola&quot; in Belgrade where he taught geography. He was tenured and taught there until 1927.

Cvijić played an active role in reforming the school, helping found an ethnography department whose first professor was his oldest student and assistant, Jovan Erdeljanović (followed by Tihomir Đorđević); Cvijić remained in the geography department. He was influential in establishing five new faculties: medicine, agriculture and theology in Belgrade, philosophy in Skopje and the Subotica Law School. From 1906 to 1907 he was rector of Belgrade University and again from 1919.

In 1915 he lectured about the Balkans at Sorbonne University in Paris.

==Views==

=== Critique of education ===
Cvijić thought that the grammar-school education of that era should last seven years, instead of eight, and felt that young men should be included early in adult life and independent work.

=== Territorial expansion ===
Cvijić&#x27; s scientific impartiality has been criticized for his support of Serbia&#x27;s political advancement; his geographic work was used to scientifically justify politics of territorial expansion and further territorial claims.

According to Cvijić, Bulgarians were &quot;different from the other South Slavs in their ethnic composition&quot;. He described as Slav three ethnographic groups previously considered Bulgarians: the Macedonian Slavs, the Shopi and the Torlaks. Cvijić excluded the region around Sofia (Bulgaria&#x27;s capital) from the Bulgarian group, maintaining that the aforementioned groups were Slavic (and therefore Serbian). He believed that Serbia could govern a much larger area than the territory it held.

== Legacy ==
With a group of geographers and biologists, Cvijić founded the Serbian Geographic Society in Belgrade in 1910 and was its president until his death. In 1912 he began a magazine, the &quot;Serbian Geographic Society Herald&quot;, which is still published. Cvijić conducted weekly seminars for science students, which were also attended by teachers from Belgrade grammar schools. He founded the Faculty of Philosophy&#x27;s Geographical Institute in 1923 (the first such organization in the Balkans), managing it until his death.


In 1947, the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts founded the Jovan Cvijić Geographical Institute in Belgrade. On 21–22 November 2002, the Academy hosted a meeting on &quot;the socio-political work of Jovan Cvijić&quot;.

The Jovan Cvijić&#x27;s house is housed in his family&#x27;s house in Belgrade at 5 Jelena Ćetković Street. Since 1996, the house (built in 1905) has been declared a cultural monument by the state and was decorated by Dragutin Inkiostri Medenjak; Cvijić favored a decorative style based on Balkan folklore. The museum features manuscripts, letters, notes, books, paintings, geographical charts, atlases and personal items, and occasional lectures are presented.

In Serbia, a number of schools and streets are named after Cvijić and he is still considered the most important Serbian geographer. His work has been continued by his students, six of whom later became members of the Serbian Academy (including Pavle Vujević, Borivoje Z. Milojević and Milisav Lutovac). The scientist&#x27;s life and work were researched by geographer Milorad Vasović for his 454-page book, &quot;Jovan Cvijić: Scientist, Public Worker, Statesman&quot; (1994).

== Academic honors ==

Cvijić received a number of awards. He belonged to 30 scientific societies (academies, geographical and natural societies), receiving ten decorations. Cvijić received a gold medal for his work in 1924 from the New York Geographical Society and medals from England and France. Two varieties of saffron were named after him.

<doc id="1272987" wikidata="Q39605" url="?curid=1272987" title="Standard Schnauzer">
<text>The Schnauzer () or Mittelschnauzer is a German breed of dog in the Pinscher and Schnauzer group. It is characterised by an abundant bristly beard and whiskers, usually lighter than the coat. It is one of three Schnauzer breeds, the others being the Giant Schnauzer or Riesenschnauzer, and the Miniature Schnauzer or Zwergschnauzer. In Germany it is an endangered breed, and is listed in category III of the Rote Liste of the Gesellschaft zur Erhaltung alter und gefährdeter Haustierrassen.

Its development as a breed dates from the 1880s, in southern Germany. It is a robust and squarely-built dog of medium size, of working or utility type; the coat may be salt-and-pepper or black. A dog of this type was exhibited in Hanover in 1879; another was &quot;Best in Show&quot; at the Westminster Kennel Club in the United States in 1997.

== History ==
Neither the origin of the breed name, nor when it came into use, is known. The German word means &#x27;snout&#x27;, while both and mean &#x27;walrus moustache&#x27;. The word appears in the &quot;Bilder und Sagen aus der Schweiz&quot; of Jeremias Gotthelf, published in 1842. &#x27;Schnauz&#x27; was a common name for a dog – several dogs with this name were shown in Elberfeld in 1880. At the third international dog show of the Verein zur Veredelung der Hunderassen in Hanover in 1879, a dog named &#x27;Schnautzer&#x27; took first place in the Rauche Pinscher or Wire-haired Pinscher class.

The Schnauzer originated in southern Germany; it shares a common history with the German Pinscher. Dogs of this type, both rough-haired and smooth-haired, were traditionally kept as carriage dogs or as stable dogs, and so were sometimes known as ; they were capable ratters. Both types were known as Deutscher Pinscher, and came from the same lineage; rough-haired and smooth-haired puppies could occur in the same litter. The rough-haired type, which would later become the Schnauzer, was also known as the .

In 1880 the Pinscher was recorded in the &quot;Deutschen Hundestammbuch&quot; of the Verein zur Veredelung der Hunderassen, and the first breed standard was drawn up. Various colours were described for the rough-haired type, including iron-grey, silver-grey, grey-yellow, corn-yellow and rust-yellow. In 1895 described five varieties of Pinscher – the rough- and smooth-haired Pinscher, the rough- and smooth-haired Miniature Pinscher, and the Affenpinscher. Also in 1895, a breed society, the Pinscherklub, was established for both types, both rough- and smooth-haired. Another society, the Schnauzerklub München, was formed in Munich in 1907 by breeders of the Mittelschnauzer. In 1917, with the sixth edition of the stud-book, the name of the rough-haired breed was officially changed from Rauhaarige Pinscher to Schnauzer. In 1918 the Pinscherklub and the Schnauzerklub München merged to form the Pinscher-Schnauzer-Verband, which in 1921 changed its name to the present Pinscher-Schnauzer-Klub 1895 e.V.

In the interwar period the pepper-and-salt Schnauzer flourished, while the black was less often seen; after the end of the Second World War, the reverse was true. The Schnauzer was definitively accepted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1955. In the fifteen-year period from 2007 to 2021, annual registrations in Germany varied between and , with an annual average of .

Since 2014 the pepper-and-salt Schnauzer has been on the Rote Liste of the Gesellschaft zur Erhaltung alter und gefährdeter Haustierrassen. In 2022 its conservation status was listed as , &#x27;endangered&#x27;, the third-highest category of endangerment of the organisation. In 2018 a total of 201 pepper-and-salt puppies were whelped in 26 litters.

A few Schnauzers were exported to the United States before the outbreak of the First World War. In 1925 the Wire-Haired Pinscher Club of America was started, covering both standard-sized and miniature Schnauzers; in 1933 it was divided into two separate clubs, one of them the Standard Schnauzer Club of America.

== Characteristics ==

The Schnauzer is a robust and squarely-built dog of medium size, of working or utility type. The coat is hard, wiry and dense, with a thick soft under-coat; it may be salt-and-pepper or black. In the salt-and-pepper, the grey may vary from pale silver-grey to dark iron-grey, always with a mask of a darker shade. The ears are v-shaped, are set high and hang close to the face. The eyes are dark, the nose and lips are black.

Median lifespan is reported to be 13 years, slightly greater than the median for all dogs, 12.5 years.

== Use ==

The Schnauzer was traditionally kept as a farm dog, with a particular aptitude for ratting. In the twenty-first century it is commonly kept as a companion animal.

<text>American Specialty Cars (commonly known as ASC or American Sunroof Company) was an automobile supplier of highly engineered and designed roof systems, body systems and other specialty-vehicle systems for the world’s automakers. The company was headquartered in Warren, Michigan, in the United States and was one of several coach convertible builders. ASC sold assets to its Creative Services division in late 2016 to Roush Industries. In late June 2017, ASC effectively ceased operations, laying off all staff and had tooling and production equipment removed from the manufacturing plant in Lexington, Kentucky.

==Founding==
The company was founded by Heinz Prechter in Los Angeles, California as the American Sunroof Company in 1965. In 2004, the aftermarket sunroof business was sold to Inalfa, and the company changed its name from American Sunroof Company to American Specialty Cars, with a &quot;new emphasis on handling design, engineering and manufacturing of low-volume niche vehicles&quot;.

All employees were terminated June 27, 2017 and ASC ceased operations. Major manufacturing operations were sourced to other suppliers, mainly Toyota and FCA, effectively shutting down production operations.

== Products ==

In 1983 the Ford Flair ASC Concept was presented, built by AMC.

The first generation Saab 900 cabriolet was developed by ASC and first unveiled as a 1983 concept car.

In 1984 ASC built and marketed the ASC McLaren, a convertible version of the Mercury Capri, licensing the McLaren brand. This was followed by an ASC/McLaren Mustang convertible. and an ASC/McLaren Pontiac Turbo Grand Prix

From 1989, ASC manufactured the Porsche 944 Cabriolet at its factory in Weinsberg, Germany.

In 1986, ASC build prototypes of a Chevrolet Corvette ZR-1 convertible.

In 1993 ASC created a Cadillac Seville Coupe concept car.

In 1994 ASC and Heuliez built a prototype for a Citroen ZX convertible.

In 2004 ASC unveiled the Helios concept, a four-door convertible version of the Chrysler 300C.

<text>The Toyota Camry Solara, popularly known as the Toyota Solara, is a mid-size coupé/convertible built by Toyota. The Camry Solara is mechanically based on the Toyota Camry and effectively replaced the discontinued Camry Coupé (XV10); however, in contrast with its predecessor&#x27;s conservative design, the Camry Solara was designed with a greater emphasis on sportiness, with more rakish styling, and uprated suspension and engine tuning intended to provide a sportier feel. The coupe was launched in late 1998 for model year 1999. In 2000, the convertible was introduced, effectively replacing the Celica convertible in Toyota&#x27;s North American lineup.

The second-generation Camry Solara debuted in 2003 for model year 2004, initially offered as a coupe; the second-generation convertible was introduced in the spring of 2004 as a 2005 model. Coupe production ended in mid-2008. Despite official statements that the convertible might be sold until 2010 if demand was sufficient, production was suspended in December 2008 and never resumed.


== First generation (XV20; 1998–2003) ==

The Solara was created to appeal to a demographic of more sport-minded drivers than those who prefer the Toyota Camry sedan, while still needing &quot;room and comfort.&quot; The Camry Solara thus aspired to blend &quot;sporty&quot; looks and style with spacious practicality. Prior to the production of the Camry Solara, the 2-door version of the Toyota Camry was simply known as the Camry Coupe. It was added to the third generation Camry lineup in 1993 for model year 1994 to compete with the Honda Accord and other cars in its class. However, due to it never being nearly as popular as the 4-door sedan of the Camry, the Camry Coupe was dropped in 1996 when the sedan was redesigned for model year 1997. A distinct successor went into development in the mid-1990s, resulting a winning design entry in 1995 from Warren J. Crain of Calty Design and Research. After design approval, production development ran from 1995 to the first half of 1998. Patents were filed at the Japan Patent Office on January 18, 1996, under 1020408 and November 14, 1996, at the United States Patent Office USPTO under D407350.

The first generation Camry Solara went on sale in the third quarter of 1998 as a 1999 model to replace the Camry Coupe. It was based on the mechanical platform of the previous generation XV10 Toyota Camry and was built at the TMMC facilities in Cambridge, Ontario, Canada. This model featured a 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine with and of torque at 4,400 rpm, and a 3.0-liter V6 engine with at 5,200 rpm, and of torque at 4,400 rpm. The engines are the same as the ones used in the fourth generation Camry, but slightly revamped to have a small gain in power (two and six horsepower, respectively). The V6 claimed a 0-to-60 mph (97 km/h) time of 7.1 seconds.

Toyota offered dealer-installed performance upgrades for the first-generation Solara under the Toyota Racing Development (TRD) banner. The upgrades included stiffer shock absorbers and anti-roll bars, a less restrictive muffler, a &quot;tasteful&quot; body kit, larger wheels with high-performance tires, and a supercharger that increased the power of the V6 engine by a claimed . The parts were covered under a TRD warranty and provided a substantial increase in performance; &quot;Motor Trend&quot; found that the 0-to- acceleration time of the V6 Solara decreased to 5.6 seconds with the full TRD package.

The Toyota Camry Solara is also the first vehicle in the Toyota lineup, after their 1997 partnership agreement, to feature a JBL premium stereo option. All models came with a single-slot in-dash CD player and cassette deck from JBL. The SE models come standard with 15-inch steel wheels and hubcaps, upgradable to 15-inch alloy wheels. The Sports Package also adds a retuned suspension, perforated leather-wrapped steering wheel, perforated eight-way power-adjustable leather seats, an upgrade to 16-inch alloy wheels, retuned steering, minor trim changes and a rear lip spoiler.

In 2000, the SE and SLE convertibles were added to the lineup; these cars were built as semi-finished coupes, shipped to an American Sunroof Company (ASC) facility where the roofs were removed and convertible tops installed, and were then shipped back to Toyota for painting and final assembly. Claiming that the car&#x27;s basic structure was designed for this treatment, Toyota made no suspension changes from the coupe. Toyota did strengthen the rocker sections by doubling them up, while adding steel bracing between the wheel wells, adding over the coupe&#x27;s weight. Nonetheless, the car was considerably less rigid than the coupe.

=== Minor model update (2001–2003) ===

The Camry Solara was lightly facelifted in September 2001 for the 2002 model year, receiving changes to the grille pattern, taillights, headlights that now featured a 4-bulb system instead of 2, a chrome logo on the steering wheel (instead of an embossed pattern), and smaller fog lights. The trunk was now openable by remote and the wood trim changed from Oxford Burlwood to Mustard Wood. New packages and options were also offered and include heated leather seats, an Appearance Package that featured a three-spoke steering wheel, leather-wrapped shift knob, black pearl emblems, and a different center cap on the wheels.

Mechanically, the 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine was replaced with the same 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine offered on the redesigned 2002 Camry, the 2AZ-FE. This new engine was chosen because it featured the same gas mileage as the previous engine, except it offered more power and the addition of VVT-i, a technology that improved performance and reduced emissions. This new engine featured at 5,600 rpm, and of torque at 4,000 rpm, up from the previous model.
== Second generation (XV30; 2003–2008) ==
The second generation of the Solara was completely redesigned (design approval in 2001; JPO patent number 1218292) and introduced to the public in August 2003 for the 2004 model year and featured a curvier body, with the option of adding XM radio and/or a navigation system. Based on the platform of the 2002 Camry sedan, the Gen 2 body is heavier than the Gen 1.5 body. The four-cylinder engine was carried over from the previous generation, while the optional V6 was a new 3.3 L unit rated at 225 net hp at 5,600 rpm (168 kW) and of torque at 3,600 rpm. The four-cylinder engine could be coupled to a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 was offered only with a five-speed U151E automatic transmission. Both engines featured Toyota&#x27;s VVT-i technology.

The Solara moved to Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky for the second generation model. Production started in July 2003 for the coupe and February 2004 for the convertible. The convertible was offered only with the 3.3 liter V-6 and the 5-speed MMT automatic transmission. Rather than being adapted from the coupe like the first-generation car—which had been criticized for poor structural rigidity—Toyota claimed that the second-generation convertible was specifically designed and built as such, with a more rigid body structure for decreased levels of noise and vibration.

In late 2005 for the 2006 model year, the five-speed MMT automatic transmission replaced the four-speed automatic on four-cylinder models, and minor changes were made to the optional power driver&#x27;s seat.

In June 2006, a restyled 2007 Solara was introduced, with new LED tail lights, a revised rear bumper, and a redesigned front fascia. Interior changes include Optitron gauges, blue backlighting in the rest of the car&#x27;s controls, a new steering wheel design that is somewhat similar to the recently revised Camry SE&#x27;s steering wheel, revised shifter, MP3 and WMA CD playback capability, external audio device (e.g. iPod, Zen, cassette) auxiliary port connectivity, Bluetooth connectivity, and voice-activated navigation on the SLE V6 models. Powertrains were unchanged, although new SAE-Certified testing methods resulted in the 4-cylinder model being rated at with of torque, while the V6 was now rated at and of torque.

The second-generation Solara sold below expectations, as the market for large sedan-based coupes and convertibles was shrinking, and the car had inherited unexciting handling from its Camry parent. Despite the structural redesign, the convertible was still criticized for soft handling that did not feel sporty, and for significant body shake. From model year 2005 to 2008, sales fell from roughly 50,000 units annually to just over 20,000. After the 2008 model year, the coupe was discontinued due to faltering sales, but the convertible, which accounted for the majority of units sold, continued to be produced.

Despite statements that the convertible might be sold until at least 2010, production was quietly suspended in December 2008, with sales continuing from inventory to gauge demand. In June 2009, Toyota announced that sales had not met expectations, and that production would not resume.

== Use of model name ==

The name Solara was previously used on a motor vehicle by Peugeot, with their Talbot Solara, a notchback variant of the Chrysler Alpine hatchback developed by Chrysler Europe before their takeover by Peugeot in 1978. The rights to use the Solara name on a motor vehicle within Europe remain with Peugeot. From time to time, such names from the past appear on limited edition models. Mitsubishi Australia also used this name on the mid-spec versions of its Mitsubishi Magna sedan and station wagon.

<text>A rhyming dictionary is a specialized dictionary designed for use in writing poetry and lyrics. In a rhyming dictionary, words are categorized into equivalence classes that consist of words that rhyme with one another. They also typically support several different kinds of rhymes and possibly also alliteration as well.

Because rhyming dictionaries are based on pronunciation, they are difficult to compile. Words and rhyming patterns change their pronunciation over time and between dialects. Rhyming dictionaries for Old English, Elizabethan poetry, or Standard English would have quite different content. Rhyming dictionaries are invaluable for historical linguistics; as they record pronunciation, they can be used to reconstruct pronunciation differences and similarities that are not reflected in spelling.

A simple reverse dictionary, which collates words starting from the end, provides a rough rhyming dictionary to the extent that spelling follows pronunciation. However, a precise rhyming dictionary reflects pronunciation, not spelling.

Today, there are many websites on the internet that provide the same function as rhyming dictionaries.
