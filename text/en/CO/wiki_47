<text>The marbled cat (Pardofelis marmorata) is a small wild cat native from the eastern Himalayas to Southeast Asia, where it inhabits forests up to an elevation of . As it is present in a large range, it has been listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List since 2015.

The marbled cat is closely related to the Asian golden cat (&quot;Catopuma temminckii&quot;) and the bay cat (&quot;C. badia&quot;), all of which diverged from other felids about 9.4 million years ago.

==Characteristics==
The marbled cat is similar in size to a domestic cat, but has rounded ears and a very long tail that is as long as the cat&#x27;s head and body. The ground colour of its long fur varies from brownish-grey to ochreous brown above and greyish to buff below. It is patterned with black stripes on the short and round head, on the neck and back. On the tail, limbs and underbelly it has solid spots. On the flanks it has irregular dark-edged blotches that fuse to dark areas and look like a &#x27;marbled&#x27; pattern. Its paws are webbed between the digits and are completely sheathed.
Its coat is thick and soft. Spots on the forehead and crown merge into narrow longitudinal stripes on the neck, and irregular stripes on the back. The legs and underparts are patterned with black dots, and the tail is marked with black spots proximally and rings distally. It has large feet and unusually large canine teeth, resembling those of the big cats, although these appear to be the result of parallel evolution. Marbled cats range from in head-body length with a long and thickly furred tail that indicates the cat&#x27;s adaptation to an arboreal lifestyle, where the tail is used as a counterbalance. Recorded weights vary between .

==Distribution and habitat==

The marbled cat occurs along the eastern Himalayan foothills and in tropical Indomalaya eastward into southwest China, and on the islands of Sumatra and Borneo. It is primarily associated with moist and mixed deciduous-evergreen tropical forests. Its distribution in India is confined to the north-eastern forests.

In eastern Nepal, a marbled cat was recorded for the first time in January 2018, outside a protected area in the Kangchenjunga landscape at an altitude of .

In northeast India, marbled cats were recorded in Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary, Dampa and Pakke Tiger Reserves, Balpakram-Baghmara landscape and Singchung-Bugun Village Community Reserve in Arunachal Pradesh between January 2013 and March 2018.

In Bhutan, it has been recorded in Royal Manas National Park, and in broadleaved and mixed conifer forests at elevations up to in Jigme Dorji National Park and Wangchuck Centennial National Park.

In Thailand, it was recorded in a hill evergreen bamboo mixed forest in Phu Khieu Wildlife Sanctuary.

In Borneo, it has also been recorded in peat swamp forest.
The population size of the marbled cat is not well understood. Few records were obtained during camera-trapping surveys throughout much of its range. In three areas in Sabah, the population density was estimated at 7.1 to 19.6 individuals per , an estimate that may be higher than elsewhere in the cat&#x27;s range.
In Kalimantan, marbled cats were recorded in mixed swamp forest and tall interior forest at altitudes below in the vicinity of Sabangau National Park between 2008 and 2018.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
Marbled cats recorded in northeastern India and Kalimantan on Borneo were active by day.

The first-ever radio-tracked marbled cat had an overall home range of at an elevation of and was active primarily during nocturnal and crepuscular times.
Marbled cats recorded in northeast India were active during the day with activity peaks around noon.

Forest canopies probably provide the marbled cat with much of its prey: birds, squirrels and other rodents, and reptiles. In the Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, a marbled cat was observed in a dense forest patch in an area also used by siamang. In Thailand, one individual has been observed in Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary preying on a Phayre&#x27;s leaf monkey.

A few marbled cats have been bred in captivity, with gestation estimated to be 66 to 82 days. In the few recorded instances, two kittens were born in each litter, and weighed from . Their eyes open at around 12 days, and the kittens begin to take solid food at two months, around the time that they begin actively climbing. Marbled cats reach sexual maturity at 21 or 22 months of age, and have lived for up to 12 years in captivity.

== Threats ==
The primary threat to the marbled cat is loss and degradation of forest as it depends on large tracts of intact forest.
Forest loss is continuing across its range due to logging and expansion of human settlements and agriculture. 
Indiscriminate snaring is prevalent throughout much of its range, and also likely poses a major threat. It is valued for its skin, meat, and bones, but infrequently observed in the illegal Asian wildlife trade.
During a survey in the Lower Subansiri District of Arunachal Pradesh, a marbled cat was encountered that had been killed by a local hunter for a festival celebrated by the indigenous Apatani people in March and April every year. The dead cat was used in a ceremony, and its blood was sacrificed to the deity for goodwill of their family and for ensuring a good harvest, protection from wildlife, disease and pest.

==Conservation==
&quot;Pardofelis marmorata&quot; is included in CITES Appendix I and protected over parts of its range. Hunting is prohibited in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Yunnan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, and Thailand. Hunting is regulated in Laos and Singapore. In Bhutan and Brunei, the marbled cat is not legally protected outside protected areas. No information about protection status is available from Cambodia and Vietnam.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Felis marmorata&quot; was the scientific name proposed by William Charles Linnaeus Martin in 1836 for a skin of a male marbled cat from Java or Sumatra.
&quot;Felis longicaudata&quot; proposed by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1843 was a zoological specimen from India or Cochinchina.
&quot;Felis charltoni&quot; proposed by John Edward Gray in 1846 was a specimen from Darjeeling.
The generic name &quot;Pardofelis&quot; was proposed by Nikolai Severtzov in 1858.

At present, two subspecies are recognized as valid:
*&quot;P. marmorata marmorata&quot; (Martin, 1836) – from the Malay Peninsula to Sumatra and Borneo
*&quot;P. marmorata longicaudata&quot; (Blainville, 1843) – from Nepal to north of the Isthmus of Kra

=== Phylogeny ===
The marbled cat was once considered to belong to the pantherine lineage of cats. But
results of a phylogenetic analysis indicate that it forms an evolutionary lineage with the Asian golden cat (&quot;Catopuma temminckii&quot;) and the bay cat (&quot;C. badia&quot;) that genetically diverged about . The marbled cat diverged from this lineage about .

<doc id="1284947" wikidata="Q134690" url="?curid=1284947" title="Pardofelis">
<text>Pardofelis is a genus of the cat family Felidae. This genus is defined as including one species native to Southeast Asia: the marbled cat. Two other species, formerly classified to this genus, now belong to the genus &quot;Catopuma&quot;.

The word &quot;pardofelis&quot; is composed of the Latin words &quot;pardus&quot; (pard), and &quot;felis&quot; (cat) in allusion to the spots of the type species, the marbled cat.

==Taxonomic history==
&quot;Pardofelis&quot; was first proposed by the Russian explorer and naturalist Nikolai Severtzov in 1858 as generic name comprising a single felid species occurring in tropical Asia, the marbled cat &quot;Pardofelis marmorata&quot;.
The British zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock recognized the taxonomic classification of &quot;Pardofelis&quot; in 1917 as comprising not only the marbled cat but also the Borneo bay cat &quot;Pardofelis badia&quot;, because of similarities in the shape of their skulls. In 1939, he described &quot;Pardofelis marmorata&quot; on the basis of skins and skulls which originated in Java, Sumatra, Darjeeling and Sikkim.

Until 2006, the classification of &quot;Pardofelis&quot; as a monotypic genus was widely accepted. Genetic analysis carried out at the turn of the century revealed a close genetic relationship with the Borneo bay cat &quot;Pardofelis badia&quot; and the Asian golden cat &quot;Pardofelis temminckii&quot;. All of them diverged from the other felids about , and have therefore been proposed to be placed in the genus &quot;Pardofelis&quot;. Meanwhile, &quot;Pardofelis&quot; is considered a synonym of &quot;Catopuma&quot;.

The relationship between this branch and others on the feline family tree has also become clearer. &quot;Pardofelis&quot; species do not stem from the Pantherinae subfamily but belong to the other main branch of mostly smaller cat species, the Felinae. They share a more recent common ancestor with servals, caracals, and African golden cats than with any other existing cat genus.

==Characteristics==
&quot;Pardofelis&quot; are small long-tailed, short-headed cats with rounded ears, distinguishable from &quot;Prionailurus&quot; and related Oriental genera by having the skull higher and more rounded, with the mesopterygoid fossa lanceolate in front and provided with thickened margins or a better developed external crest. The skull is short, broad, strongly convex in dorsal profile, not comparatively long and low. The nasal branch of the premaxilla is thin, not expanded, the summit of the muzzle is not compressed above, the maxilla is not expanded where it abuts against the nasal bone, and develops no excrescence outside the suborbital foramen.

<text>Braunlage () is a town and health resort in the Goslar district of Lower Saxony in Germany. Situated within the Harz mountain range, south of the Brocken massif, Braunlage&#x27;s main business is tourism, particularly skiing. Nearby ski resorts include the Sonnenberg and the slopes on the Wurmberg.

== Geography ==
Braunlage is located on the Warme Bode, a headstream of the river Bode, close to the border with Elend in the state of Saxony-Anhalt. The municipal area stretches along the south-eastern rim of the Harz National Park from an elevation of up to at the summit of the Wurmberg. Other peaks in the vicinity include the Achtermannshöhe and the Hahnenklee Crags.

===Districts===
The town consists of three districts:
* Braunlage proper
* Hohegeiß*, incorporated on 1 July 1972
* Sankt Andreasberg**, incorporated on 1 November 2011

* with the village of Königskrug
** with the villages of Sonnenberg, Oderhaus, Oderbrück, Oderberg, Odertaler Sägemühle and Silberhütte

===Transportation===
Braunlage is on the &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; B4 between Braunschweig and Nordhausen and the B27 from Blankenburg to Göttingen.

Local buses run between Braunlage and the nearby communities of Bad Harzburg, Sankt Andreasberg, Schierke, Wernigerode, Hohegeiß, Bad Sachsa, Nordhausen, Bad Lauterberg, Herzberg and Clausthal-Zellerfeld.

Braunlage used to be served by the South Harz Railway Company, which provided a link to the Harz Narrow Gauge Railways via Sorge, but service ceased in 1958.

== History ==

First mentioned as &quot;Brunla&quot; in 1227, the town started out as a pit settlement in the Harz forests. It appeared as &quot;Brunenlo&quot; in a 1253 register of the Saxon counts of Regenstein and was revived when their successors, the Counts of Blankenburg, established an ironworks here in 1561. With the extinction of the Blankenburg dynasty in 1599 Braunlage fell to the Dukes of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel.

In the 17th century it was a small Brunswick market town in the west corner of the former Blankenburg lands. Tourism developed from the late 19th century onwards and other branches of business were forestry and a large granite quarry on the Wurmberg. Around 1910 one of the first interurban bus lines ran from Bad Harzburg up to Braunlage, served by Büssing vehicles. The Wurmberg Ski Jumps were erected in 1922 (demolished in 2014). In 1934 Braunlage received town privileges and municipal status as a health resort.

After World War II Braunlage was close to the fortified inner German border through the Harz mountains. In 1963 it became the location of the Wurmberg Gondola Lift, today with a length of and a height difference of to the summit station the longest in Northern Germany. On 7 May 1964 Gerhard Zucker demonstrated a flight of mail rockets on the Hasselkopf hill. One of them exploded, killing two spectators.

Since German reunification in 1990 Braunlage has again been in the centre of the Harz tourist region but it has had to cope with growing competition from the neighbouring resorts in Saxony-Anhalt.

=== Demographics ===

== Politics ==
=== Town council ===
Seats in the town council (&quot;Stadtrat&quot;) as of 2016 local elections:
* Christian Democratic Union (CDU): 7

== Culture and sights ==
A museum of local history covers Braunlage&#x27;s tradition as a health resort and official venue of the International Ski Federation (FIS). The townscape includes extensive spa gardens

=== Sports ===
The local ice-hockey team &quot;Harzer Wölfe&quot; is an important part of the north German ice-hockey culture.

There used to be several ski jumps on the Wurmberg, which hosted international competitions such as the FIS Ski Jumping Continental Cup until 2011. Between 2009 and 2012 the Braunlage Nude Sledging World Championships were held.

=== Sights ===
The Silberteich and the &quot;Hahnenkleeklippen&quot; on the way to Sankt Andreasberg are popular tourist destinations.

<doc id="1284966" wikidata="Q571888" url="?curid=1284966" title="Balys Sruoga">
<text>Balys Sruoga (2 February 1896 – 16 October 1947) was a Lithuanian poet, playwright, critic, and literary theorist.

He contributed to cultural journals from his early youth. His works were published by the liberal wing of the Lithuanian cultural movement, and also in various Lithuanian newspapers and other outlets (such as &quot;Aušrinė&quot;, &quot;Rygos naujienos&quot; etc.). In 1914, he began studying literature in Saint Petersburg, and later in Moscow, due to World War I and the Russian Revolution. In 1921, he enrolled in the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where in 1924 he received his Ph.D for a doctoral thesis on the relations between Lithuanian and Slavic folk songs. Sruoga was also the first translator of Anna Akhmatova&#x27;s poetry, which he likely completed between November 1916 and early 1917.

After returning to Lithuania, Sruoga taught at the University of Lithuania, and established a theater seminar that eventually became a course of study. He also wrote various articles on literature. From 1930 he began writing dramas. In 1939, he began teaching at Vilnius University. Shortly after the annexation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union, Sruoga relocated to Vilnius, where he continued lecturing on theater. However, during the Nazi occupation of the country, as an intellectual, Sruoga was arrested, imprisoned, and later deported to the Stutthof concentration camp. He wrote of his experience in the camp in the novel &quot;Forest of the Gods&quot;. After the camp was liberated by Soviet troops, the frail author died two years later in 1947.

==Early life==
===Studies in Lithuania===
Balys Sruoga was born on 2 February 1896 in the village of (near modern-day Panevėžys), then the Kovno Governorate of the Russian Empire. Balys&#x27;s parents Pranciškus Sruoga and Agota Sruogienė (née Lomanaitė) also raised Juozas Sruoga (1886–1957), a diplomat; Adolfas Sruoga (1887–1941), director of postal services; and Kazys Sruoga (1899–1974), an economist. Their parents had a large amount of land, but were nevertheless peasants. Future Prime Minister of Lithuania Ernestas Galvanauskas was a distant relative of the Sruoga family. As was standard at the time, before beginning official education, Sruoga attended a private secret school that was set up at his home. He attended a school of the Vabalninkas parish in 1903. From 1906 to 1914 Sruoga attended the Panevėžys real school, where he belonged to the socialist &quot;Aušrininkai&quot; society and became its leader in the city. Sruoga was an active participant and organizer of the city&#x27;s music and drama society &quot;Aidas&quot;. Although reserved in nature, Sruoga became known for his literary school work; he later printed poems, articles, and correspondences in newspapers such as &quot;Aušrinė&quot;, &quot;Rygos naujienos&quot;, and the &quot;Vaivorykštė&quot; magazine.

===Studies in Russia===

Although he initially wanted to study philology in Moscow, instead in 1914 Sruoga traveled to St. Petersburg, where he first studied at the Imperial Forestry Institute, but later changed to studying literature in 1915. In the city, Sruoga experienced a psychological crisis mainly due to loneliness and homesickness. Sruoga was one of the editors of the Lithuanian literary almanac in the Russian language. To assist Sruoga in his living standards, Sruoga was invited to work at the Lithuanian Society for the Relief of War Sufferers by Stasys Šilingas and Adomas Varnas, where he had prepared a technical terms glossary that has not survived. In St. Petersburg, Sruoga was also acquainted with Ignas Šeinius, Jurgis Baltrušaitis, Konstantin Balmont, Vyacheslav Ivanov, and Maxim Gorky. Sruoga continued translating the works of Mykolas Vaitkus, Maironis, Sofija Čiurlionienė, Ignas Šeinius, and others.

In 1916, Sruoga moved to Moscow where he began attending Moscow State University at the faculty of history and philology. In Moscow, Sruoga was attracted by the symbolist movement as well as the works and ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche. Due to the outbreak of the October Revolution, Sruoga&#x27;s language almanac was not published. Sruoga visited the Caucasus in 1917. A year later, due to the increasing chaos and famine, Sruoga and other war refugees returned to Lithuania in 1918.

==Independent Lithuania==

After returning to Lithuania, Sruoga lived in Vilnius. However, as military tensions between newly independent Lithuania and Poland were rising (which would culminate into the Polish–Lithuanian War), Sruoga decided to leave Vilnius and traveled to Kaunas on foot in 1919. Sruoga there worked as the chief editor of the newspaper &quot;Lietuva&quot;. That same year he was elected as the first president of the Vilkolakis Theatre. There he met his future wife Vanda Daugirdaitė-Sruogienė. Sruoga was also one of the initiators in establishing the Society of Lithuanian Art Creators, abbreviated then as &quot;Liemenkūdra&quot;. As the secretary of the society, Sruoga wrote letters to Lithuanian authorities and Lithuanians in the United States regarding the establishment of opera and drama theaters, the publication of chrestomathy of world literature, and the awarding of prizes and scholarships to prominent artists. Sruoga at that point established himself as a literary and theater critic.

In 1921 Sruoga traveled to Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where he studied Slavic philology. Sruoga also was interested in German impressionist and expressionist literature. Sruoga planned on becoming a mountaineer at the nearby mountains. Nonetheless, Sruoga continued to be a critic for the press as a means to earn money. In 1924, Sruoga received a Ph.D for his doctoral thesis on the relations between Lithuanian and Slavic folk songs.

He returned to Lithuania that same year. On 22 March 1924, Sruoga married Vanda Daugirdaitė in the village of , after which they moved to the port city Klaipėda. Their only daughter Dalia Sruogaitė was born in 1927. Originally, Sruoga decided to move there to write a libretto commissioned by Jonas Žilius-Jonila. For a few months Sruoga worked on the editorial board of the local state-established news magazine. In autumn, Sruoga moved to back to Kaunas. Until 1940, Sruoga worked at the faculty of humanitarian sciences of the Vytautas Magnus University, where he lectured on Russian literature and the history of theater as a docent. During this time, Sruoga created what is considered his most mature works of literature, such as the historical plays &quot;Milžino paunksmė&quot; (1932), &quot;Baisioji naktis&quot;, &quot;Radvila Perkūnas&quot;, the allegorical children&#x27;s play &quot;Aitvaras teisėjas&quot; (1935), &quot;Giesmė apie Gediminą&quot; (1938), among others. During his fifteen years of work at the university, Sruoga published fourteen fiction and science books. He also briefly belonged to the Lithuanian Writers&#x27; Union. In 1932 Sruoga became a professor. Sruoga also published two volumes on the history of Russian literature in 1931–1933.

==Life during occupation==
In 1940, after the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, Sruoga moved to Vilnius. Sruoga proceeded to join the Writer&#x27;s Trade Union of the Lithuanian SSR. During Nazi occupation, Sruoga continued to head his theater seminar.

===&quot;Forest of the Gods&quot;===

Sruoga&#x27;s best known work is the novel &quot;Forest of the Gods&quot;, based on his own life experiences as a prisoner in Stutthof concentration camp in Sztutowo, Free City of Danzig (now present-day Nowy Dwór Gdański County, Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland), where he was sent in March 1943 together with forty-seven other Lithuanian intellectuals after the Nazis started a campaign against possible anti-Nazi agitation in occupied Lithuania. Sruoga staunchly opposed Nazism. In the book, Sruoga revealed life in a concentration camp through the eyes of a man whose only way to save his life and maintain his dignity was to view everything through a veil of irony and humor, where torturers and their victims are exposed as imperfect human beings, being far removed from the false ideals of their political leaders. For example, he wrote &quot;A man is not a machine. He gets tired.&quot;, referring to the guards beating prisoners. Originally the novel was suppressed by the Soviet officials; it was ultimately published in 1957, ten years after the author&#x27;s death. The novel was adapted into a movie in 2005 under the name &quot;Forest of the Gods&quot;, becoming the most profitable film released after Lithuania restored its independence.

Sruogas&#x27;s experiences in the concentration camp were written with elements of the grotesque, where dark humor creates an image of an absurd world. The novel is generally compared to Western existentialist literature due to motifs of dehumanization and the fall of civilization – the camp is presented at the beginning of the book as a resort, and German culture is presented as passing from &quot;baroque&quot; to &quot;barrack&quot;.

==Later life==
After the Soviet Union liberated the Nazi camps, Sruoga continued to be held in the same camp. Before returning to Vilnius, Sruoga spent another two months in a military field hospital in Lauenburg and in Toruń, in a temporary camp where ex-prisoners were checked to ensure that there were no war criminals or agents subordinate to Nazi Germany in hiding. In the camp, Sruoga worked at the post office and the chief&#x27;s office, where he translated and processed documents. In 1945, Sruoga returned to Vilnius and lectured teaching at Vilnius University, where he wrote the dramas &quot;Pajūrio kurortas&quot; and &quot;Barbora Radvilaitė&quot;.

The authorities&#x27; refusal to publish Sruogas&#x27;s novel, weak health resulting from his time in the concentration camp, as well as the psychological burden of not seeing his daughter and wife who were migrating abroad, led to his death on 16 October 1947. He succumbed during his return journey from Kaunas to Vilnius due to complications arising from a cold. He was buried in the Rasos Cemetery.

==Remembrance==
A memorial plate was uncovered in Vilnius in 1992. He is the namesake of a street in Antakalnis.

<doc id="1284973" wikidata="Q168745" url="?curid=1284973" title="Nile crocodile">
<text>The Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) is a large crocodilian native to freshwater habitats in Africa, where it is present in 26 countries. It is widely distributed in sub-Saharan Africa, occurring mostly in the eastern, southern, and central regions of the continent, and lives in different types of aquatic environments such as lakes, rivers, swamps and marshlands. It occasionally inhabits deltas, brackish lakes and rarely also saltwater. Its range once stretched from the Nile Delta throughout the Nile River. Lake Turkana in Kenya has one of the largest undisturbed Nile crocodile populations.

Generally, the adult male Nile crocodile is between in length and weighs . However, specimens exceeding in length and in weight have been recorded. It is the largest predator in Africa, and may be considered the second-largest extant reptile in the world, after the saltwater crocodile (&quot;Crocodylus porosus&quot;). Size is sexually dimorphic, with females usually about 30% smaller than males. The crocodile has thick, scaly, heavily armoured skin.

Nile crocodiles are opportunistic apex predators; a very aggressive crocodile, they are capable of taking almost any animal within their range. They are generalists, taking a variety of prey, with a diet consisting mostly of different species of fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals. As ambush predators, they can wait for hours, days, and even weeks for the suitable moment to attack. They are agile predators and wait for the opportunity for a prey item to come well within attack range. Even swift prey are not immune to attack. Like other crocodiles, Nile crocodiles have a powerful bite that is unique among all animals, and sharp, conical teeth that sink into flesh, allowing a grip that is almost impossible to loosen. They can apply high force for extended periods of time, a great advantage for holding down large prey underwater to drown.

Nile crocodiles are relatively social. They share basking spots and large food sources, such as schools of fish and big carcasses. Their strict hierarchy is determined by size. Large, old males are at the top of this hierarchy and have first access to food and the best basking spots. Crocodiles tend to respect this order; when it is infringed, the results are often violent and sometimes fatal. Like most other reptiles, Nile crocodiles lay eggs; these are guarded by the females but also males, making the Nile crocodiles one of few reptile species whose males contribute to parental care. The hatchlings are also protected for a period of time, but hunt by themselves and are not fed by the parents.

The Nile crocodile is one of the most dangerous species of crocodile and is responsible for hundreds of human deaths every year. It is common and is not endangered, despite some regional declines or extirpations in the Maghreb.

==Etymology and naming==
The binomial name &quot;Crocodylus niloticus&quot; is derived from the Greek κρόκη, &quot;kroke&quot; (&quot;pebble&quot;), δρῖλος, &quot;drilos&quot; (&quot;worm&quot;), referring to its rough skin; and &quot;niloticus&quot;, meaning &quot;from the Nile River&quot;. The Nile crocodile is called &quot;timsah al-nil&quot; in Arabic, &quot;mamba&quot; in Swahili, &quot;yaxaas&quot; in Somali, &quot;garwe&quot; in Shona, &quot;ngwenya&quot; in Ndebele, &quot;ngwena&quot; in Venda, &quot;kwena&quot; in Sotho and Tswana, and &quot;tanin ha-yeor&quot; in Hebrew. It also sometimes referred to as the African crocodile, Ethiopian crocodile, and common crocodile.

==Taxonomy==
Although no subspecies are currently formally recognized, as many as seven have been proposed, mostly due to variations in appearance and size noted in various populations throughout Africa. These have consisted of &quot;C. n. africanus&quot; (informally named the East African Nile crocodile), &quot;C. n. chamses&quot; (the West African Nile crocodile), &quot;C. n. cowiei&quot; (the South African Nile crocodile), &quot;C. n. madagascariensis&quot; (the Malagasy or Madagascar Nile crocodile, regionally also known as the &quot;croco Mada&quot;, which translates to Malagasy crocodile), &quot;C. n. niloticus&quot; (the Ethiopian Nile crocodile; this would be the nominate subspecies), &quot;C. n. pauciscutatus&quot; (the Kenyan Nile crocodile) and &quot;C. (n.) suchus&quot; (now widely considered a separate species).

In a study of the morphology of the various populations, including &quot;C. (n.) suchus&quot;, the appearance of the Nile crocodile &quot;sensu lato&quot; was found to be more variable than that of any other currently recognized crocodile species, and at least some of these variations were related to locality. For example, a study on Lake Turkana in Kenya (informally this population would be placed in &quot;C. n. pauciscutatus&quot;) found that the local crocodiles have more osteoderms in their ventral surface than other known populations, and thus are of lesser value in leather trading, accounting for an exceptionally large (possibly overpopulated) local population there in the late 20th century. The segregation of the West African crocodile (&quot;C. suchus&quot;) from the Nile crocodile has been supported by morphological characteristics, studies of genetic materials and habitat preferences. The separation of the two is not recognized by the IUCN as their last evaluations of the group was in 2008 and 2009, years before the primary publications supporting the distinctiveness of the West African crocodiles.

==Evolution==
Although originally thought to be the same species as the West African crocodile, genetic studies using DNA sequencing have revealed that the Nile crocodile is actually more closely related to the crocodiles of the Americas, namely the American (&quot;C. acutus&quot;), Cuban (&quot;C. rhombifer&quot;), Morelet&#x27;s (&quot;C. moreletii&quot;), and Orinoco crocodiles (&quot;C. intermedius&quot;). The fossil species &quot;C. checchiai&quot; from the Miocene in Kenya was about the same size as the extant African Nile crocodiles and shared similar physical characteristics to this specific species.

At one time, the fossil species &quot;Rimasuchus lloydi&quot; was thought to be the closest relative of the Nile crocodile, but more recent research has indicated that &quot;Rimasuchus&quot;, despite its very large size (about 20–30% bigger than a Nile crocodile with a skull length estimated up to ), is more closely related to the dwarf crocodile (&quot;Osteolaemus tetraspis&quot;) among living species. Two other fossil species from Africa retained in the genus &quot;Crocodylus&quot; appear to be closely related to the Nile crocodile: &quot;C. anthropophagus&quot; from Plio-Pleistocene Tanzania and &quot;C. thorbjarnarsoni&quot; from Plio-Pleistocene Kenya. &quot;C. anthropophagus&quot; and &quot;C. thorbjarnarsoni&quot; were both somewhat larger, with projected total lengths up to . As well as being larger, &quot;C. anthropophagus&quot; and &quot;C. thorbjarnarsoni&quot;, as well as &quot;Rimasuchus&quot; spp., were all relatively broad-snouted, indicating a specialization at hunting sizeable prey, such as large mammals and freshwater turtles, the latter much larger than any in present-day Africa. Studies have since shown these other African crocodiles to be only more distantly related to the Nile crocodile.

Below is a cladogram based on a 2018 tip dating study by Lee &amp; Yates simultaneously using morphological, molecular (DNA sequencing), and stratigraphic (fossil age) data, as revised by the 2021 Hekkala &quot;et al.&quot; paleogenomics study using DNA extracted from the extinct &quot;Voay&quot;.
==Characteristics and physiology==

Adult Nile crocodiles have a dark bronze colouration above, with faded blackish spots and stripes variably appearing across the back and a dingy off-yellow on the belly, although mud can often obscure the crocodile&#x27;s actual colour. The flanks, which are yellowish-green in colour, have dark patches arranged in oblique stripes in highly variable patterns. Some variation occurs relative to environment; specimens from swift-flowing waters tend to be lighter in colour than those dwelling in murkier lakes or swamps, which provides camouflage that suits their environment, an example of clinal variation. Nile crocodiles have green eyes. The colouration also helps to camouflage them; juveniles are grey, multicoloured, or brown, with dark cross-bands on the tail and body. The underbelly of young crocodiles is yellowish green. As they mature, Nile crocodiles become darker and the cross-bands fade, especially those on the upper-body. A similar tendency in coloration change during maturation has been noted in most crocodile species.

Most morphological attributes of Nile crocodiles are typical of crocodilians as a whole. Like all crocodilians, for example, the Nile crocodile is a quadruped with four short, splayed legs, a long, powerful tail, a scaly hide with rows of ossified scutes running down its back and tail, and powerful, elongated jaws. Their skin has a number of poorly understood integumentary sense organs that may react to changes in water pressure, presumably allowing them to track prey movements in the water. The Nile crocodile has fewer osteoderms on the belly, which are much more conspicuous on some of the more modestly sized crocodilians. The species, however, also has small, oval osteoderms on the sides of the body, as well as the throat. The Nile crocodile shares with all crocodilians a nictitating membrane to protect the eyes and lachrymal glands to cleanse its eyes with tears. The nostrils, eyes, and ears are situated on the top of the head, so the rest of the body can remain concealed under water. They have a four-chambered heart, although modified for their ectothermic nature due to an elongated cardiac septum, physiologically similar to the heart of a bird, which is especially efficient at oxygenating their blood. As in all crocodilians, Nile crocodiles have exceptionally high levels of lactic acid in their blood, which allows them to sit motionless in water for up to 2 hours. Levels of lactic acid as high as they are in a crocodile would kill most vertebrates. However, exertion by crocodilians can lead to death due to increasing lactic acid to lethal levels, which in turn leads to failure of the animal&#x27;s internal organs. This is rarely recorded in wild crocodiles, normally having been observed in cases where humans have mishandled crocodiles and put them through overly extended periods of physical struggling and stress.

===Skull and head morphology===
The mouths of Nile crocodiles are filled with 64 to 68 sharply pointed, cone-shaped teeth (about a dozen less than alligators have). For most of a crocodile&#x27;s life, broken teeth can be replaced. On each side of the mouth, five teeth are in the front of the upper jaw (premaxilla), 13 or 14 are in the rest of the upper jaw (maxilla), and 14 or 15 are on either side of the lower jaw (mandible). The enlarged fourth lower tooth fits into the notch on the upper jaw and is visible when the jaws are closed, as is the case with all true crocodiles. Hatchlings quickly lose a hardened piece of skin on the top of their mouths called the egg tooth, which they use to break through their eggshells at hatching. Among crocodilians, the Nile crocodile possesses a relatively long snout, which is about 1.6 to 2.0 times as long as broad at the level of the front corners of the eyes. As is the saltwater crocodile, the Nile crocodile is considered a species with medium-width snout relative to other extant crocodilian species.

In a search for the largest crocodilian skulls in museums, the largest verifiable Nile crocodile skulls found were several housed in Arba Minch, Ethiopia, sourced from nearby Lake Chamo, which apparently included several specimens with a skull length more than , with the largest one being in length with a mandibular length of . Nile crocodiles with skulls this size are likely to measure in the range of , which is also the length of the animals according to the museum where they were found. However, larger skulls may exist, as this study largely focused on crocodilians from Asia. The detached head of an exceptionally large Nile crocodile (killed in 1968 and measuring in length) was found to have weighed , including the large tendons used to shut the jaw.

====Biting force====
The bite force exerted by an adult Nile crocodile has been shown by Brady Barr to measure . However, the muscles responsible for &quot;opening&quot; the mouth are exceptionally weak, allowing a person to easily hold them shut, and even larger crocodiles can be brought under control by the use of duct tape to bind the jaws together. The broadest snouted modern crocodilians are alligators and larger caimans. For example, a black caiman (&quot;Melanosuchus niger&quot;) was found to have a notably broader and heavier skull than that of a Nile crocodile measuring . However, despite their robust skulls, alligators and caimans appear to be proportionately equal in biting force to true crocodiles, as the muscular tendons used to shut the jaws are similar in proportional size. Only the gharial (&quot;Gavialis gangeticus&quot;) (and perhaps some of the few very thin-snouted crocodilians) is likely to have noticeably diminished bite force compared to other living species due to its exceptionally narrow, fragile snout. More or less, the size of the tendons used to impart bite force increases with body size and the larger the crocodilian gets, the stronger its bite is likely to be. Therefore, a male saltwater crocodile, which had attained a length around , was found to have the most powerful biting force ever tested in a lab setting for any type of animal.

===Size===
The Nile crocodile is the largest crocodilian in Africa, and is generally considered the second-largest crocodilian after the saltwater crocodile. Typical size has been reported to be as much as , but this is excessive for actual average size per most studies and represents the upper limit of sizes attained by the largest animals in a majority of populations. Alexander and Marais (2007) give the typical mature size as ; Garrick and Lang (1977) put it at from . According to Cott (1961), the average length and weight of Nile crocodiles from Uganda and Zambia in breeding maturity was and . Per Graham (1968), the average length and weight of a large sample of adult crocodiles from Lake Turkana (formerly known as Lake Rudolf), Kenya was and body mass of . Similarly, adult crocodiles from Kruger National Park reportedly average in length. In comparison, the saltwater crocodile and gharial reportedly both average around , so are about longer on average, and the false gharial (&quot;Tomistoma schlegelii&quot;) may average about , so may be slightly longer, as well. However, compared to the narrow-snouted, streamlined gharial and false gharial, the Nile crocodile is more robust and ranks second to the saltwater crocodile in total average body mass among living crocodilians, and is considered to be the second-largest extant reptile. The largest accurately measured male, shot near Mwanza, Tanzania, measured and weighed about . Another large male measuring in total length (Cott 1961) was among the largest Nile crocodiles ever recorded. It was estimated to weigh .

====Size and sexual dimorphism====

Like all crocodiles, they are sexually dimorphic, with the males up to 30% larger than the females, though the difference is considerably less compared to some species, like the saltwater crocodile. Male Nile crocodiles are about longer on average at sexual maturity and grow more so than females after becoming sexually mature, especially expanding in bulk after exceeding in length. Adult male Nile crocodiles usually range in length from long; at these lengths, an average sized male may weigh from . Very old, mature ones can grow to or more in length (all specimens over from 1900 onward are cataloged later). Large mature males can reach or more in weight. Mature female Nile crocodiles typically measure , at which lengths the average female specimen would weigh .

An old male individual, named &quot;Big Daddy&quot;, housed at Mamba Village Centre, Mombasa, Kenya, is considered to be one of the largest living Nile crocodiles in captivity. It measures in length and weighs . In 2007, at the Katavi National Park, Brady Barr captured a specimen measuring in total length (with a considerable portion of its tail tip missing). The weight of this specimen was estimated to be , making it one of the largest crocodiles ever to be captured and released alive. The bulk and mass of individual crocodiles can be fairly variable, some animals being relatively slender, while others being very robust; females are often bulkier than males of a similar length. As an example of the body mass increase undergone by mature crocodiles, one of the larger crocodiles handled firsthand by Cott (1961) was and weighed , while the largest specimen measured by Graham and Beard (1973) was and weighed more than . One of the largest known specimens from South Africa, caught by J. G. Kuhlmann in Venda, which was long weighed . On the other hand, another individual measuring in length was estimated to weigh between . In attempts to parse the mean male and female lengths across the species, the mean adult length was estimated to be reportedly in males, at which males would average about in weight, while that of the female is , at which females would average about . This gives the Nile crocodile somewhat of a size advantage over the next largest non-marine predator on the African continent, the lion (&quot;Panthera leo&quot;), which averages in males and in females, and attains a maximum known weight of , far less than that of large male crocodiles.

Nile crocodiles from cooler climates, like the southern tip of Africa, may be smaller, reaching maximum lengths of only . A crocodile population from Mali, the Sahara Desert, and elsewhere in West Africa reaches only in length, but it is now largely recognized as a separate species, the West African crocodile.

==Distribution and habitat==

The Nile crocodile&#x27;s current distribution extends from the regional tributaries of the Nile in Sudan and Lake Nasser in Egypt to the Cunene river in Angola, the Okavango Delta of Botswana, and the Olifants River in South Africa. It is the most common crocodilian in Africa and occurs in Somalia, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Gabon, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Sudan, South Sudan and Cameroon. Its historic range extended to the Mediterranean coast in Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and across the Red Sea in the Palestine region and Syria. Herodotus sighted it in Lake Moeris in Egypt. It is thought to have become extinct in the Seychelles in the early 19th century. It has rarely been spotted in Zanzibar and the Comoros.

An isolated population also exists in western and southern Madagascar from Sambirano River to Tôlanaro. It likely colonized the island after the extinction of the endemic crocodile &quot;Voay&quot; within the last 2000 years. In 2022, a skull of &quot;Crocodylus&quot; from Madagascar was found to be around 7,500 years old based on radiocarbon dating, suggesting that the extinction of &quot;Voay&quot; post-dates the arrival of Nile crocodiles on Madagascar.

The Nile crocodile was previously thought to also occur in West and Central Africa, but these populations are now typically recognized as a distinct species, the West African (or desert) crocodile. The West African crocodile occurs throughout much of West and Central Africa, ranging east to South Sudan and Uganda where it may come into contact with the Nile crocodile. The Nile crocodile is absent from most of West and Central Africa, but range into the latter region in eastern and southern Democratic Republic of Congo, and along the Central African coastal Atlantic region north to Cameroon. Likely a level of habitat segregation occurs between the two species, but this remains to be confirmed.

Nile crocodiles may be able to tolerate an extremely broad range of habitat types, including small brackish streams, fast-flowing rivers, swamps, dams, and tidal lakes and estuaries. In East Africa, they are found mostly in rivers, lakes, marshes, and dams, favoring open, broad bodies of water over smaller ones. They are often found in waters adjacent to various open habitats such as savanna or even semi-desert but can also acclimate to well-wooded swamps, extensively wooded riparian zones, waterways of other woodlands and the perimeter of forests. In Madagascar, the remnant population of Nile crocodiles has adapted to living within caves. Nile crocodiles may make use of ephemeral watering holes on occasion. The Nile crocodile possesses salt glands like all true crocodiles and does on occasion enter coastal and even marine waters. They have been known to enter the sea in some areas, with one specimen having been recorded off St. Lucia Bay in 1917.

===Invasive potential===
Nile crocodiles have been recently captured in South Florida, though no signs that the population is reproducing in the wild have been found. Genetic studies of Nile crocodiles captured in the wild in Florida have revealed that the specimens are all closely related to each other, suggesting a single source of the introduction. This source remains unclear, as their genetics do not match samples collected from captives at various zoos and theme parks in Florida. When compared to Nile crocodiles from their native Africa, the Florida wild specimens are most closely related to South African Nile crocodiles. It is unknown how many Nile crocodiles are currently at large in Florida. The animals likely were either brought there to be released or are escapees.

==Behaviour==

Generally, Nile crocodiles are relatively inert creatures, as are most crocodilians and other large, cold-blooded creatures. More than half of the crocodiles observed by Cott (1961), if not disturbed, spent the hours from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. continuously basking with their jaws open if conditions were sunny. If their jaws are bound together in the extreme midday heat, Nile crocodiles may easily die from overheating. Although they can remain practically motionless for hours on end, whether basking or sitting in shallows, Nile crocodiles are said to be constantly aware of their surroundings and aware of the presence of other animals. However, mouth-gaping (while essential to thermoregulation) may also serve as a threat display to other crocodiles. For example, some specimens have been observed mouth-gaping at night, when overheating is not a risk. In Lake Turkana, crocodiles rarely bask at all through the day, unlike crocodiles from most other areas, for unknown reasons, usually sitting motionless partially exposed at the surface in shallows, with no apparent ill effects from the lack of basking on land.
In South Africa, Nile crocodiles are more easily observed in winter because of the extensive amount of time they spend basking at this time of year. More time is spent in water on overcast, rainy, or misty days. In the southern reaches of their range, as a response to dry, cool conditions that they cannot survive externally, crocodiles may dig and take refuge in tunnels and engage in aestivation. Pooley found in Royal Natal National Park that during aestivation, young crocodiles of total length would dig tunnels around in depth for most, with some tunnels measuring more than , the longest there being . Crocodiles in aestivation are lethargic, entering a state similar to animals that hibernate. Only the largest individuals engaging in aestivation leave the burrow to sun on the warmest days; otherwise, these crocodiles rarely left their burrows. Aestivation has been recorded from May to August.

Nile crocodiles usually dive for only a few minutes at a time, but can swim under water up to 30 minutes if threatened. If they remain fully inactive, they can hold their breath for up to 2 hours (which, as aforementioned, is due to the high levels of lactic acid in their blood). They have a rich vocal range and good hearing. Nile crocodiles normally crawl along on their bellies, but they can also &quot;high walk&quot; with their trunks raised above the ground. Smaller specimens can gallop, and even larger individuals are capable of occasional, surprising bursts of speed, briefly reaching up to . They can swim much faster, moving their bodies and tails in a sinuous fashion, and they can sustain this form of movement much longer than on land, with a maximum known swimming speed of .
Nile crocodiles have been widely known to have gastroliths in their stomachs, which are stones swallowed by animals for various purposes. Although this is clearly a deliberate behaviour for the species, the purpose is not definitively known. Gastroliths are not present in hatchlings, but increase quickly in presence within most crocodiles examined at and yet normally become extremely rare again in very large specimens, meaning that some animals may eventually expel them. However, large specimens can have a large number of gastroliths. One crocodile measuring and weighing had of stones in its stomach, perhaps a record gastrolith weight for a crocodile. Specimens shot near Mpondwe on the Semliki River had gastroliths in their stomach despite being shot miles away from any sources for the stones; the same holds true for specimens from Kafue Flats, Upper Zambezi and Bangweulu Swamp, all of which often had stones inside them despite being nowhere near stony regions. Cott (1961) felt that gastroliths were most likely serving as ballast to provide stability and additional weight to sink in water, this bearing great probability over the theories that they assist in digestion and staving off hunger. However, Alderton (1998) stated that a study using radiology found that gastroliths were seen to internally aid the grinding of food during digestion for a small Nile crocodile.

Herodotus claimed that Nile crocodiles have a symbiotic relationship with a bird named the Trochilus which enter the crocodile&#x27;s mouth and pick leeches feeding on the crocodile&#x27;s blood. Guggisberg (1972) had seen examples of birds picking scraps of meat from the teeth of basking crocodiles (without entering the mouth) and prey from soil very near basking crocodiles, so felt it was not impossible that a bold, hungry bird may occasionally nearly enter a crocodile&#x27;s mouth, but not likely as a habitual behaviour. MacFarland and Reeder, reviewing the evidence in 1974, found that: &quot;Extensive observations of Nile crocodiles in regular or occasional association with various species of potential cleaners (e.g. Plovers, Sandpipers, water dikkop) ... have resulted in only a few reports of sandpipers removing leeches from the mouth and gular scutes and snapping at insects along the reptile&#x27;s body.&quot;

==Hunting and diet==
Nile crocodiles are apex predators throughout their range. In the water, this species is an agile and rapid hunter relying on both movement and pressure sensors to catch any prey unfortunate enough to present itself inside or near the waterfront. Out of water, however, the Nile crocodile can only rely on its limbs, as it gallops on solid ground, to chase prey. No matter where they attack prey, this and other crocodilians take practically all of their food by ambush, needing to grab their prey in a matter of seconds to succeed. They have an ectothermic metabolism, so can survive for long periods between meals. However, for such large animals, their stomachs are relatively small, not much larger than a basketball in an average-sized adult, so as a rule, they are anything but voracious eaters. Young crocodiles feed more actively than their elders, according to studies in Uganda and Zambia. In general, at the smallest sizes (), Nile crocodiles were most likely to have full stomachs (17.4% full per Cott); adults at in length were most likely to have empty stomachs (20.2%). In the largest size range studied by Cott, , they were the second most likely to either have full stomachs (10%) or empty stomachs (20%). Other studies have also shown a large number of adult Nile crocodiles with empty stomachs. For example, in Lake Turkana, Kenya, 48.4% of crocodiles had empty stomachs. The stomachs of brooding females are always empty, meaning that they can survive several months without food.

The Nile crocodile mostly hunts within the confines of waterways, attacking aquatic prey or terrestrial animals when they come to the water to drink or to cross. The crocodile mainly hunts land animals by almost fully submerging its body under water. Occasionally, a crocodile quietly surfaces so that only its eyes (to check positioning) and nostrils are visible, and swims quietly and stealthily toward its mark. The attack is sudden and unpredictable. The crocodile lunges its body out of water and grasps its prey. On other occasions, more of its head and upper body is visible, especially when the terrestrial prey animal is on higher ground, to get a sense of the direction of the prey item at the top of an embankment or on a tree branch. Crocodile teeth are not used for tearing up flesh, but to sink deep into it and hold on to the prey item. The immense bite force, which may be as high as in large adults, ensures that the prey item cannot escape the grip. Prey taken is often much smaller than the crocodile itself, and such prey can be overpowered and swallowed with ease. When it comes to larger prey, success depends on the crocodile&#x27;s body power and weight to pull the prey item back into the water, where it is either drowned or killed by sudden thrashes of the head or by tearing it into pieces with the help of other crocodiles.
Subadult and smaller adult Nile crocodiles use their bodies and tails to herd groups of fish toward a bank, and eat them with quick sideways jerks of their heads. Some crocodiles of the species may habitually use their tails to sweep terrestrial prey off balance, sometimes forcing the prey specimen into the water, where it can be more easily drowned. They also cooperate, blocking migrating fish by forming a semicircle across the river. The most dominant crocodile eats first. Their ability to lie concealed with most of their bodies under water, combined with their speed over short distances, makes them effective opportunistic hunters of larger prey. They grab such prey in their powerful jaws, drag it into the water, and hold it underneath until it drowns. They also scavenge or steal kills from other predators, such as lions and leopards (&quot;Panthera pardus&quot;). Groups of Nile crocodiles may travel hundreds of meters from a waterway to feast on a carcass. They also feed on dead hippopotamuses (&quot;Hippopotamus amphibius&quot;) as a group (sometimes including three or four dozen crocodiles), tolerating each other. Much of the food from crocodile stomachs may come from scavenging carrion, and the crocodiles could be viewed as performing a similar function at times as do vultures or hyenas on land. Once their prey is dead, they rip off and swallow chunks of flesh. When groups are sharing a kill, they use each other for leverage, biting down hard and then twisting their bodies to tear off large pieces of meat in a &quot;death roll&quot;. They may also get the necessary leverage by lodging their prey under branches or stones, before rolling and ripping.

The Nile crocodile possesses unique predation behavior characterized by the ability of preying both within water, where it is best adapted, and out of it, which often results in unpredictable attacks on almost any other animal up to twice its size. Most hunting on land is done at night by lying in ambush near forest trails or roadsides, up to 50 m (170 ft) from the water&#x27;s edge. Since their speed and agility on land is rather outmatched by most terrestrial animals, they must use obscuring vegetation or terrain to have a chance of succeeding during land-based hunts. In one case, an adult crocodile charged from the water up a bank to kill a bushbuck (&quot;Tragelaphus scriptus&quot;) and instead of dragging it into the water, was observed to pull the kill further on land into the cover of the bush. Two subadult crocodiles were once seen carrying the carcass of a nyala (&quot;Tragelaphus angasii&quot;) across land in unison. In South Africa, a game warden far from water sources in a savannah-scrub area reported that he saw a crocodile jump up and grab a donkey by the neck and then drag the prey off. Small carnivores are readily taken opportunistically, including African clawless otters (&quot;Aonyx capensis&quot;).

===Interspecific predatory relationships===
Living in the rich biosphere of Africa south of the Sahara, the Nile crocodile may come into contact with other large predators. Its place in the ecosystems it inhabits is unique, as it is the only large tetrapod carnivore that spends the majority of its life in water and hunting prey associated with aquatic zones. Large mammalian predators in Africa are often social animals and obligated to feed almost exclusively on land. The Nile crocodile is a strong example of an apex predator. Outside water, crocodiles can meet competition from other dominant savannah predators, notably big cats, which in Africa are represented by lions, cheetahs, and leopards. In general, big cats and crocodiles have a relationship of mutual avoidance. Occasionally, if regular food becomes scarce, both lions and the crocodile will steal kills on land from each other and, depending on size, will be dominant over one another. Both species may be attracted to carrion, and may occasionally fight over both kills or carrion. Most conflicts over food occur near the water and can literally lead to a tug-of-war over a carcass that can end either way, although seldom is there any serious fighting or bloodshed between the large carnivores. Intimidation displays may also resolve these conflicts. However, when size differences are prominent, the predators may prey on each other.

==Reproduction==

On average, sexual maturity is obtained from 12 to 16 years of age. For males, the onset of sexual maturity occurs when they are about long and mass of , being fairly consistent. On the other hand, that for females is rather more variable, and may be indicative of the health of a regional population based on size at sexual maturity. On average, according to Cott (1961), female sexual maturity occurs when they reach in length. Similarly, a wide range of studies from southern Africa found that the average length for females at the onset of sexual maturity was . However, stunted sexual maturity appears to occur in populations at opposite extremes, both where crocodiles are thought to be overpopulated and where they are overly reduced to heavy hunting, sometimes with females laying eggs when they measure as small as although it is questionable whether such clutches would bear healthy hatchlings.

According to Bourquin (2008), the average breeding female in southern Africa is between . Earlier studies support that breeding is often inconsistent in females less than and clutch size is smaller, a female at reportedly never lays more than 35 eggs, while a female measuring can expect a clutch of up to 95 eggs. In &quot;stunted&quot; newly mature females from Lake Turkana measuring , the average clutch size was only 15. Graham and Beard (1968) hypothesized that, while females do continue to grow as do males throughout life, that past a certain age and size that females much over in length in Lake Turkana no longer breed (supported by the physiology of the females examined here); however, subsequent studies in Botswana and South Africa have found evidence of nesting females at least in length. In the Olifants River in South Africa, rainfall influenced the size of nesting females as only larger females (greater than ) nested during the driest years. Breeding females along the Olifants were overall larger than those in Zimbabwe. Most females nest only every two to three years while mature males may breed every year.

During the mating season, males attract females by bellowing, slapping their snouts in the water, blowing water out of their noses, and making a variety of other noises. Among the larger males of a population, territorial clashes can lead to physical fighting between males especially if they are near the same size. Such clashes can be brutal affairs and can end in mortality but typically end with victor and loser still alive, the latter withdrawing into deep waters. Once a female has been attracted, the pair warble and rub the undersides of their jaws together. Compared to the tender behaviour of the female accepting the male, copulation is rather rough (even described as &quot;rape&quot;-like by Graham &amp; Beard (1968)) in which the male often roars and pins the female underwater. Cott noted little detectable discrepancy in the mating habits of Nile crocodiles and American alligators. In some regions, males have reportedly mated with several females, perhaps any female that enters his claimed territory, though in most regions annual monogamy appears to be most common in this species.
Females lay their eggs about one to two months after mating. The nesting season can fall in nearly every month of the year. In the northern extremes of the distribution (i.e. Somalia or Egypt), the nesting season is December through February while in the southern limits (i.e. South Africa or Tanzania) is in August through December. In crocodiles between these distributions egg-laying is in intermediate months, often focused between April and July. The dates correspond to about a month or two into the dry season within that given region. The benefits of this are presumably that nest flooding risk is considerably reduced at this time and the stage at which hatchlings begin their lives out of the egg falls roughly at the beginning of the rainy season, when water levels are still relatively low but insect prey is in recovery. Preferred nesting locations are sandy shores, dry stream beds, or riverbanks. The female digs a hole a few metres from the bank and up to 0.5 m (20 in) deep, and lays on average between 25 and 80 eggs. The number of eggs varies and depends partially on the size of the female. The most significant prerequisites to a nesting site are soil with the depth to permit the female to dig out the nest mound, shading to which mother can retire during the heat of the day and access to water. She finds a spot soft enough to allow her to dig a sideways slanted burrow. The mother Nile crocodile deposits the eggs in the terminal chamber and packs the sand or earth back over the nest pit. While, like all crocodilians, the Nile crocodile digs out a hole for a nest site, unlike most other modern crocodilians, female Nile crocodiles bury their eggs in sand or soil rather than incubate them in rotting vegetation. The female may urinate sporadically on the soil to keep it moist, which prevents soil from hardening excessively. After burying the eggs, the female then guards them for the three-month incubation period. Nests have been recorded seldom in concealed positions such as under a bush or in grasses, but normally in open spots on the bank. It is thought the Nile crocodile cannot nest under heavy forest cover as can two of the three other African crocodiles because they do not use rotting leaves (a very effective method of producing heat for the eggs) and thus require sunlight on sand or soil the surface of the egg chamber to provide the appropriate warmth for embryo development. In South Africa, the invasive plant &quot;Chromolaena odorata&quot; has recently exploded along banks traditionally used by crocodiles as nesting sites and caused nest failures by blocking sunlight over the nest chamber.

When Nile crocodiles have been entirely free from disturbance in the past, they may nest gregariously with the nest lying so close together that after hatching time the rims of craters are almost contiguous. These communal nesting sites are not known to exist today, perhaps being most recently recorded at Ntoroko peninsula, Uganda where two such sites remaining until 1952. In one area, 17 craters were found in an area of , in another 24 in an area of . Communal nesting areas also reported from Lake Victoria (up until the 1930s) and also in the 20th century at Rahad River, Lake Turkana and Malawi. The behaviour of the female Nile crocodile is considered unpredictable and may be driven by the regional extent of prior human disturbance and human persecution rather than natural variability. In some areas, the mother crocodiles will only leave the nest if she needs to cool off (thermoregulation) by taking a quick dip or seeking out a patch of shade. Females will not leave nest site even if rocks are thrown at her back and several authors note her trance-like state while standing near nest, similar to that of crocodiles in aestivation but not like any other stage in their life-cycle. In such a trance, some mother Nile crocodiles may show no discernable reaction even if pelted with stones. At other times, the female will fiercely attack anything approaching their eggs, sometimes joined by another crocodile which may be the sire of the young. In other areas, the nesting female may disappear upon potential disturbance which may allow the presence of both the female and her buried nest to escape unwanted detection by predators. Despite the attentive care of both parents, the nests are often raided by humans and monitor lizards or other animals while she is temporarily absent.

At a reported incubation period of about 90 days, the stage is notably shorter than that of the American alligator (110–120 days) but slightly longer than that of the mugger crocodile. Nile crocodiles have temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), which means the sex of their hatchlings is determined not by genetics as is the case in mammals and birds, but by the average temperature during the middle third of their incubation period. If the temperature inside the nest is below 31.7 °C (89.1 °F), or above 34.5 °C (94.1 °F), the offspring will be female. Males can only be born if the temperature is within that narrow range. The hatchlings start to make a high-pitched chirping noise before hatching, which is the signal for the mother to rip open the nest. It is thought to be either difficult or impossible for hatchlings to escape the nest burrow without assistance, as the surface may become very heavy and packed above them. The mother crocodile may pick up the eggs in her mouth, and roll them between their tongue and the upper palate to help crack the shell and release her offspring. Once the eggs hatch, the female may lead the hatchlings to water, or even carry them there in her mouth, as female American alligators have been observed doing.
Hatchling Nile crocodiles are between long at first and weigh around . The hatchlings grow approximately that length each year for the first several years. The new mother will protect her offspring for up to two years, and if there are multiple nests in the same area, the mothers may form a crèche. During this time, the mothers may pick up their offspring either in their mouths or gular fold (throat pouch) to keep the babies safe. The mother will sometimes carry her young on her back to avoid natural predators of the small crocodiles, which can be surprisingly bold even with the mother around. Nile crocodiles of under two years are much more rarely observed than larger specimens, and more seldom seen than the same age young in several other types of crocodilian. Young crocodiles are shy and evasive due to the formidable array of predators that they must face in sub-Saharan Africa, spending little time sunning and moving about nocturnally whenever possible. Crocodiles two years old and younger may spend a surprising amount of time on land, as evidenced by the range of terrestrial insects found in their stomachs, and their lifestyle may resemble that of a semi-aquatic mid-sized lizard more so than the very aquatic lives of older crocodiles. At the end of the two years, the hatchlings will be about long, and will naturally depart the nest area, avoiding the territories of older and larger crocodiles. After this stage, crocodiles may loosely associate with similarly sized crocodiles and many enter feeding congregations of crocodiles once they attain , at which size predators and cannibal crocodiles become much less of a concern. Crocodile longevity is not well established, but larger species like the Nile crocodile live longer, and may have a potential maximum life span of 70 to 100 years, though no crocodilian species commonly exceeds a lifespan of 50 to 60 years in captivity.

===Natural mortality of young Nile crocodiles===
An estimated 10% of eggs will survive to hatch and a mere 1% of young that hatch will successfully reach adulthood. The full range of causes for mortality of young Nile crocodiles is not well understood, as very young and small Nile crocodiles or well-concealed nests are only sporadically observed. Unseasonable flooding (during nesting which corresponds with the regional dry season) is not uncommon and has probably destroyed several nests, although statistical likelihood of such an event is not known. The only aspect of mortality in this age range that is well studied is predation and this is most likely the primary cause of death while the saurians are still diminutive. The single most virulent predator of nests is almost certainly the Nile monitor. This predator can destroy about 50% of studied Nile crocodile eggs on its own, often being successful (as are other nest predators) in light of the trance-like state that the mother crocodile enters while brooding or taking advantage of moments where she is distracted or needs to leave the nest. In comparison, perenties (&quot;Varanus giganteus&quot;) (the Australian ecological equivalent of the Nile monitor) succeeds in depredating about 90% of freshwater crocodile (&quot;Crocodylus johnsoni&quot;) eggs and about 25% of saltwater crocodile nests. Mammalian predators can take nearly as heavy of a toll, especially large mongooses such the Egyptian mongoose (&quot;Herpestes ichneumon&quot;) in the north and the water mongoose in the south of crocodile&#x27;s range. Opportunistic mammals who attack Nile crocodile nests have included wild pigs, medium-sized wild cats and baboon troops. Like Nile monitors, mammalian predators probably locate crocodile nests by scent as the padded-down mound is easy to miss visually. Marabou storks sometimes follow monitors to pirate crocodile eggs for themselves to consume, although can also dig out nests on their own with their massive, awl-like bills if they can visually discern the nest mound.

Predators of Nile crocodiles eggs have ranged from insects such as the red flour beetle (&quot;Tribolium castaneum&quot;) to predators as large and formidable as spotted hyenas (&quot;Crocuta crocuta&quot;). Unsurprisingly, once exposed to the elements as hatchlings, the young, small Nile crocodiles are even more vulnerable. Most of the predators of eggs also opportunistically eat young crocodiles, including monitors and marabous, plus almost all co-existing raptorial birds, including vultures, eagles, and large owls and buzzards. Many &quot;large waders&quot; are virulent predators of crocodile hatchlings, from dainty little egrets (&quot;Egretta garzetta&quot;) and compact hamerkops (&quot;Scopus umbretta&quot;) to towering saddle-billed storks (&quot;Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis&quot;), goliath herons and shoebills (&quot;Balaeniceps rex&quot;). Larger corvids and some non-wading water birds (i.e. pelicans) can also take some young Nile crocodiles. Mammalian carnivores take many hatchlings as well as large turtles and snakes, large predatory freshwater fish, such as the African tigerfish, the introduced largemouth bass, and possibly bull sharks, when they enter river systems. When crocodile nests are dug out and the young placed in water by the mother, in areas such as Royal Natal National Park predators can essentially enter a feeding frenzy. It may take a few years before predation is no longer a major cause of mortality for young crocodiles. African fish eagles can take crocodile hatchlings up to a few months of age and honey badgers can prey on yearlings. Once they reach their juvenile stage, large African rock pythons and big cats remain as the only predatory threat to young crocodiles. Perhaps no predator is more deadly to young Nile crocodiles than larger crocodiles of their own species, as, like most crocodilians, they are cannibalistic. This species may be particularly dangerous to their own kind considering their aggressive dispositions. While the mother crocodile will react aggressively toward potential predators and has been recorded chasing and occasionally catching and killing such interlopers into her range, due to the sheer number of animals who feed on baby crocodiles and the large number of hatchlings, she is more often unsuccessful at deflecting such predators.

==Environmental status==
Conservation organizations have determined that the main threats to Nile crocodiles, in turn, are loss of habitat, pollution, hunting, and human activities such as accidental entanglement in fishing nets. Though the Nile crocodile has been hunted since ancient times, the advent of the readily available firearm made it much easier to kill these potentially dangerous reptiles. The species began to be hunted on a much larger scale from the 1940s to the 1960s, primarily for high-quality leather, although also for meat with its purported curative properties. The population was severely depleted, and the species faced extinction. National laws, and international trade regulations have resulted in a resurgence in many areas, and the species as a whole is no longer wholly threatened with extinction. The status of Nile crocodiles was variable based on the regional prosperity and extent of conserved wetlands by the 1970s. However, as is the case for many large animal species whether they are protected or not, persecution and poaching have continued apace and between the 1950s and 1980s, an estimated 3 million Nile crocodiles were slaughtered by humans for the leather trade. In Lake Sibaya, South Africa, it was determined that in the 21st century, persecution continues as the direct cause for the inability of Nile crocodiles to recover after the leather trade last century. Recovery for the species appears quite gradual and few areas have recovered to bear crocodile populations, i.e. largely insufficient to produce sustainable populations of young crocodiles, on par with times prior to the peak of leather trading. Crocodile &#x27;protection programs&#x27; are artificial environments where crocodiles exist safely and without the threat of extermination from hunters.
An estimated 250,000 to 500,000 individuals occur in the wild today. The IUCN Red List assesses the Nile crocodile as &quot;Least Concern (LR/lc)&quot;. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) lists the Nile crocodile under Appendix I (threatened with extinction) in most of its range; and under Appendix II (not threatened, but trade must be controlled) in the remainder, which either allows ranching or sets an annual quota of skins taken from the wild. The Nile crocodile is widely distributed, with strong, documented populations in many countries in eastern and southern Africa, including Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Zambia and Zimbabwe. This species is farmed for its meat and leather in some parts of Africa. Successful sustainable-yield programs focused on ranching crocodiles for their skins have been successfully implemented in this area, and even countries with quotas are moving toward ranching. In 1993, 80,000 Nile crocodile skins were produced, the majority from ranches in Zimbabwe and South Africa. Crocodile farming is one of the few burgeoning industries in Zimbabwe. Unlike American alligator flesh, Nile crocodile meat is generally considered unappetizing although edible as tribes such as the Turkana may opportunistically feed on them. According to Graham and Beard (1968), Nile crocodile meat has an &quot;indescribable&quot; and unpleasant taste, greasy texture and a &quot;repellent&quot; smell.

The conservation situation is more grim in Central and West Africa presumably for both the Nile and West African crocodiles. The crocodile population in this area is much more sparse, and has not been adequately surveyed. While the natural population in these areas may be lower due to a less-than-ideal environment and competition with sympatric slender-snouted and dwarf crocodiles, extirpation may be a serious threat in some of these areas. At some point in the 20th century, the Nile crocodile appeared to have been extirpated as a breeding species from Egypt, but has locally re-established in some areas such as the Aswan Dam. Additional factors are a loss of wetland habitats, which is addition to direct dredging, damming and irrigation by humans, has retracted in the east, south and north of the crocodile&#x27;s range, possibly in correlation with global warming. Retraction of wetlands due both to direct habitat destruction by humans and environmental factor possibly related to global warming is perhaps linked to the extinction of Nile crocodiles in the last few centuries in Syria, Israel and Tunisia. In Lake St. Lucia, highly saline water has been pumped into the already brackish waters due to irrigation practices. Some deaths of crocodiles appeared to have been caused by this dangerous salinity, and this one-time stronghold for breeding crocodiles has experienced a major population decline. In yet another historic crocodile stronghold, the Olifants River, which flows through Kruger National Park, numerous crocodile deaths have been reported. These are officially due to unknown causes but analysis has indicated that environmental pollutants caused by humans, particularly the burgeoning coal industry, are the primary cause. Much of the contamination of crocodiles occurs when they consume fish themselves killed by pollutants. Additional ecological surveys and establishing management programs are necessary to resolve these questions.

The Nile crocodile is the top predator in its environment, and is responsible for checking the population of mesopredator species, such as the barbel catfish and lungfish, that could overeat fish populations on which other species, including birds, rely. One of the fish predators seriously affected by the unchecked mesopredator fish populations (due again to crocodile declines) is humans, particularly with respect to tilapia, an important commercial fish that has declined due to excessive predation. The Nile crocodile also consumes dead animals that would otherwise pollute the waters.

===Attacks on humans===

Much of the hunting of and general animosity toward Nile crocodiles stems from their reputation as a man-eater, which is not entirely unjustified. Despite most attacks going unreported, the Nile crocodile along with the saltwater crocodile is estimated to kill hundreds (possibly thousands) of people each year, which is more than all other crocodilian species combined. While these species are much more aggressive toward people than other living crocodilians (as is statistically supported by estimated numbers of crocodile attacks), Nile crocodiles are not particularly more likely to behave aggressively to humans or regard humans as potential prey than saltwater crocodiles. However, unlike other &quot;man-eating&quot; crocodile species, including the saltwater crocodile, the Nile crocodile lives in close proximity to human populations through most of its range, so contact is more frequent. This combined with the species&#x27; large size creates a higher risk of attack. Crocodiles as small as are capable of overpowering and successfully preying on small apes and hominids, presumably including children and smaller adult humans, but a majority of fatal attacks on humans are by crocodiles reportedly exceeding in length.

In studies preceding the slaughter of crocodiles for the leather trade, when there were believed to be many more Nile crocodiles, a roughly estimated 1,000 human fatalities per annum by Nile crocodiles were posited, with a roughly equal number of aborted attacks. A more contemporary study claimed the number of attacks by Nile crocodiles per year as 275 to 745, of which 63% are fatal, as opposed to an estimated 30 attacks per year by saltwater crocodiles, of which 50% are fatal. With the Nile crocodile and the saltwater crocodile, the mean size of crocodiles involved in non-fatal attacks was about as opposed to a reported range of or larger for crocodiles responsible for fatal attacks. The average estimated size of Nile crocodiles involved in fatal attacks is . Since a majority of fatal attacks are believed to be predatory in nature, the Nile crocodile can be considered the most prolific predator of humans among wild animals. In comparison, lions, in the years from 1990 to 2006, were responsible for an estimated one-eighth as many fatal attacks on humans in Africa as were Nile crocodiles. Although Nile crocodiles are more than a dozen times more numerous than lions in the wild, probably fewer than a quarter of living Nile crocodiles are old and large enough to pose a danger to humans. Other wild animals responsible for more annual human mortalities either attack humans in self-defense, as do venomous snakes, or are deadly only as vectors of disease or infection, such as snails, rats and mosquitos.

Regional reportage from numerous areas with large crocodile populations nearby indicate, per district or large village, that crocodiles often annually claim about a dozen or more lives per year. Miscellaneous examples of areas in the last few decades with a dozen or more fatal crocodile attacks annually include Korogwe District, Tanzania, Niassa Reserve, Mozambique, and the area around Lower Zambezi National Park, Zambia. Despite historic claims that the victims of Nile crocodile attacks are usually women and children, there is no detectable trends in this regard and any human, regardless of age, gender, or size is potentially vulnerable. Incautious human behavior is the primary drive behind crocodile attacks. Most fatal attacks occur when a person is standing a few feet away from water on a non-steep bank, is wading in shallow waters, is swimming or has limbs dangling over a boat or pier. Many victims are caught while crouching, and people in jobs that might require heavy usage of water, including laundry workers, fisherman, game wardens and regional guides, are more likely to be attacked. Many fisherman and other workers who are not poverty-stricken will go out of their way to avoid waterways known to harbor large crocodile populations.

Most biologists who have engaged in months or even years of field work with Nile crocodiles, including Cott (1961), Graham and Beard (1968) and Guggisberg (1972), have found that with sufficient precautions, their own lives and the lives of their local guides were rarely, if ever, at risk in areas with many crocodiles. However, Guggisberg accumulated several earlier writings that noted the lack of fear of crocodiles among Africans, driven in part perhaps by poverty and superstition, that caused many observed cases of an &quot;appalling&quot; lack of caution within view of large crocodiles, as opposed to the presence of bold lions, which engendered an appropriate panic. Per Guggisberg, this disregard (essentially regarding the crocodile as a lowly creature and thus non-threatening to humans) may account for the higher frequency of deadly attacks by crocodiles than by large mammalian carnivores. Most locals are well aware of how to behave in crocodile-occupied areas, and some of the writings quoted by Guggisberg from the 19th and 20th century may need to be taken with a &quot;grain of salt&quot;.

<doc id="1284980" wikidata="Q588321" url="?curid=1284980" title="Toxic megacolon">
<text>Toxic megacolon is an acute form of colonic distension. It is characterized by a very dilated colon (megacolon), accompanied by abdominal distension (bloating), and sometimes fever, abdominal pain, or shock.

Toxic megacolon is usually a complication of inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis and, more rarely, Crohn&#x27;s disease, and of some infections of the colon, including &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infections, which have led to pseudomembranous colitis. Other forms of megacolon exist and can be congenital (present since birth, such as Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease). It can also be caused by &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot; and &quot;Shigella&quot;. It may also be caused by the use of loperamide.

==Signs and symptoms==
* Abdominal bloating
* Abdominal pain
* Abdominal tenderness
* Dehydration
* Fever
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)

There may be signs of septic shock. A physical examination reveals abdominal tenderness and possible loss of bowel sounds. An abdominal radiography shows colonic dilation. White blood cell count is usually elevated. Severe sepsis may present with hypothermia or leukopenia.

===Complications===
* Perforation of the colon
* Sepsis
* Shock

Emergency action may be required if severe abdominal pain develops, particularly if it is accompanied by fever, rapid heart rate, tenderness when the abdomen is pressed, bloody diarrhea, frequent diarrhea, or painful bowel movements.

Colonoscopy is contraindicated, as it may rupture the dilated colon resulting in peritonitis and septic shock.

==Pathophysiology==
The pathological process involves inflammation and damage to the colonic wall with unknown toxins breaking down the protective mucosal barrier and exposing the muscularis propria. There is relative destruction of the ganglion cells and swelling of the nerve fibers in the myenteric plexus, with concomitant damage to the colonic musculature. This results in almost complete paralysis of the diseased segment of the colon with loss of smooth muscle substance, tone and motility. This can lead to further complications as pressure builds up in the colon due to relative fecal stasis including sepsis, intestinal hemorrhage or free perforation and spontaneous decompression.

==Diagnosis==
Massively dilated colon with air-fluid level can be seen on abdominal radiograph or CT scan.

==Treatment==
The objective of treatment is to decompress the bowel and to prevent swallowed air from further distending the bowel. If decompression is not achieved or the patient does not improve with medical management, surgery is indicated. When surgery is required the recommended procedure is a colectomy (surgical removal of all or part of the colon) with end ileostomy. Fluid and electrolyte replacement help to prevent dehydration and shock. Use of corticosteroids may be indicated to suppress the inflammatory reaction in the colon if megacolon has resulted from active inflammatory bowel disease. Antibiotics may be given to prevent sepsis.

==Prognosis==
If the condition does not improve, the risk of death is significant. In case of poor response to conservative therapy, a colectomy is usually required.

<doc id="1284983" wikidata="Q387636" url="?curid=1284983" title="Attenuation-to-crosstalk ratio">
<text>Attenuation-to-crosstalk ratio (ACR) is a parameter that is measured when testing a communication link, which represents the overall performance of the cable. AcR is a mathematical formula that calculates the ratio of attenuation to near-end crosstalk for each combination of cable pairs. ACR is expressed as a figure in decibels (dB), between the signal attenuation produced by a wire or cable transmission medium and the near-end crosstalk (NEXT). In order for a signal to be received with an acceptable bit error rate, the attenuation and the crosstalk must both be minimized. Crosstalk can be reduced by ensuring that twisted-pair wiring is tightly twisted and is not crushed, and by ensuring that connectors between wire and cable media are properly rated and installed.

Positive ACR calculations mean that transmitted signal strength is stronger than that of near-end crosstalk. ACR can be used to define a signal bandwidth (e.g. 250 MHz for category 6 cable) where signal to noise ratios are sufficient to support certain applications. The maximum frequency for which positive ACR is assured provides a benchmark to assess the usable bandwidth of twisted-pair cabling systems. EIA/TIA specifies specific values for ACR in order to meet the various categories of cable.

<text>Otavice is a small village in Dalmatian hinterland in Croatia, located on edge of Petrovo field, approximately 35 km away from the city of Šibenik. The village has 183 permanent inhabitants (2011 census).

Houses in Otavice are built mostly of concrete, and some of stone. Before its present location, the village Otavice was located on the nearby Svilaja mountain, spread in several groups of houses and barns, named after the family names of the people who lived there. In the 20th century, all this population relocated toward the valley and built new houses.

In Otavice, on a hill, there is a Meštrović family mausoleum, built by the famous Croatian sculptor Ivan Meštrović.

<text>The &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot;–class battleships were a group of three dreadnoughts built for the Royal Italian Navy (&quot;Regia Marina&quot;) in the 1910s. The ships were completed during World War I. In December 1915, and January 1916, when the Serbian army was driven by the German foces under General von Mackensen toward the Albanian coast, 138,000 Serbian infantry and 11,000 refugees were ferried across the Adriatic and landed in Italy in 87 trips by the and other shps of the Italian Navy under the command of Admiral Conz. These ships also carried 13,000 cavalrymen and 10,000 horses of the Serbian army to Corfu in 13 crossings from the Albanian port of Vallons. was sunk by a magazine explosion in 1916 and sold for scrap in 1923. The two surviving ships, and , supported operations during the Corfu Incident in 1923. They were extensively reconstructed between 1933 and 1937 with more powerful guns, additional armor and considerably more speed than before.

Both ships participated in the Battle of Calabria in July 1940, when &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; was lightly damaged. They were both present when British torpedo bombers attacked the fleet at Taranto in November 1940, and &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; was torpedoed. She was grounded with most of her hull underwater and her repairs were not completed before the Italian surrender in September 1943. &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; was scrapped in 1946. &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; escorted several convoys, and participated in the Battle of Cape Spartivento in late 1940 and the First Battle of Sirte in late 1941. She was designated as a training ship in early 1942, and escaped to Malta after Italy surrendered. The ship was transferred to the Soviet Union in 1949 and renamed &quot;Novorossiysk&quot;. The Soviets also used her for training until she was sunk when a mine exploded in 1955. She was scrapped in 1957.

==Design and description==

The &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot;–class ships were designed by Rear Admiral Engineer Edoardo Masdea, Chief Constructor of the &quot;Regia Marina&quot;, and were ordered in response to French plans to build the s. They were intended to be superior to the &quot;Courbet&quot;s and to remedy &#x27;s perceived flaws of weak protection and armament. As upgrading a warship&#x27;s protection and armament on a similar displacement typically requires a loss in speed, the ships were not designed to reach the of their predecessor. They were still given a advantage over the standard of most foreign dreadnoughts. Foreign dreadnoughts were being designed with guns, but the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; was forced to use guns in the &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot;s because Italy lacked the ability to build larger guns. An additional gun, making a total of 13, was added to offset this deficiency.

Taking advantage of the lengthy building times of these ships, other countries were able to build dreadnoughts that were superior in protection and armament, with the exception of the French. Construction was delayed by late deliveries of the 305-millimeter guns and armor plates as well as shortages of labor. The Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912 diverted workers at the shipyards for repairs and maintenance of the ships participating in the war. The Italians imported the raw nickel steel for their armor from America and Britain and processed it into their equivalent of Krupp cemented armor, called Terni cemented, but there were problems with this process and suitable plates took longer to produce than planned.

===Basic characteristics===
The ships of the &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; class were long at the waterline, and overall. They had a beam of , and a draft of . They displaced at normal load, and at deep load. The &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; class was provided with a complete double bottom and their hulls were subdivided by 23 longitudinal and transverse bulkheads. The ships had two rudders, both on the centerline. They had a crew of 31 officers and 969 enlisted men.

===Propulsion===
The original machinery for all three ships consisted of three Parsons steam turbine sets, arranged in three engine rooms. The center engine room housed one set of turbines that drove the two inner propeller shafts. It was flanked by compartments on either side, each housing one turbine set which powered the outer shafts. Steam for the turbines was provided by 20 Blechynden water-tube boilers in &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; and &quot;Leonardo da Vinci&quot;, eight of which burned oil and twelve of which burned both oil and coal. &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; used a dozen each oil-fired and mixed-firing Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Designed to reach a maximum speed of , none of the ships reached this goal on their sea trials, despite generally exceeding the rated power of their turbines. They only achieved speeds ranging from using . The ships could store a maximum of of coal and of fuel oil that gave them a range of at , and at . Each ship was equipped with three turbo generators that provided a total of 150 kilowatts at 110 volts.

===Armament===
As built, the ships&#x27; main armament comprised thirteen 46-caliber 305-millimeter guns, designed by Armstrong Whitworth and Vickers, in five gun turrets. The turrets were all on the centerline, with a twin-gun turret superfiring over a triple-gun turret in fore and aft pairs, and a third triple turret amidships, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;Q&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from bow to stern. This was only one fewer gun than the Brazilian &quot;Rio de Janeiro&quot;, then the most heavily armed battleship in the world; &quot;Rio de Janeiro&quot;″s guns were mounted in seven twin-gun turrets. The turrets had an elevation capability of −5° to +20 degrees and the ships could carry 100 rounds for each gun, although 70 was the normal load. Sources disagree regarding these guns&#x27; performance, but naval historian Giorgio Giorgerini claims that they fired armor-piercing (AP) projectiles at the rate of one round per minute and that they had a muzzle velocity of which gave a maximum range of . The turrets had hydraulic training and elevation, with an auxiliary electric system.

The secondary armament on the first two ships consisted of eighteen 50-caliber guns, also designed by Armstrong Whitworth and Vickers, mounted in casemates on the sides of the hull. These guns could depress to −10 degrees and had a maximum elevation of +15 degrees; they had a rate of fire of six shots per minute. They could fire a high-explosive projectile with a muzzle velocity of to a maximum distance of . The ships carried a total of 3,600 rounds for them. For defense against torpedo boats, the ships carried fourteen 50-caliber guns; thirteen of these could be mounted on the turret tops, but they could be mounted in 30 different positions, including some on the forecastle and upper decks. These guns had the same range of elevation as the secondary guns, and their rate of fire was higher at 10 rounds per minute. They fired a AP projectile with a muzzle velocity of to a maximum distance of . The ships were also fitted with three submerged torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and the third in the stern.

===Armor===
The &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot;-class ships had a complete waterline armor belt that was high; of this was below the waterline and above. It had a maximum thickness of amidships, reducing to towards the stern and towards the bow. The lower edge of this belt was a uniform in thickness. Above the main belt was a strake of armor thick that extended up to the lower edge of the main deck. Above this strake was a thinner one, 130 millimeters thick, that extended from the bow to &#x27;X&#x27; turret. The upper strake of armor protected the casemates and was thick. The ships had two armored decks: the main deck was thick in two layers on the flat that increased to on the slopes that connected it to the main belt. The second deck was thick, also in two layers. Fore and aft transverse bulkheads connected the armored belt to the decks.

The frontal armor of the gun turrets was in thickness with thick sides, and an roof and rear. Their barbettes also had 230-millimeter armor above the forecastle deck that reduced to between the forecastle and upper decks and 130 millimeters below the upper deck. The forward conning tower had walls 280 millimeters thick; those of the aft conning tower were 180 millimeters thick. The total weight of the protective armor was , just over 25 per cent of the ships&#x27; designed displacement. The total weight of the entire protective system was , 30.2 per cent of their intended displacement.

==Modifications and reconstruction==

Shortly after the end of World War I, the number of 50-caliber 76 mm guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter anti-aircraft (AA) guns were installed abreast the aft funnel. In addition two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were mounted on the forecastle deck abreast &#x27;B&#x27; turret. In 1925–1926 the foremast was replaced by a tetrapodal mast, which was moved forward of the funnels, the rangefinders were upgraded, and the ships were equipped to handle a Macchi M.18 seaplane mounted on the center turret. Around that same time, one or both of the ships was equipped with a fixed aircraft catapult on the port side of the forecastle.

The sisters began an extensive reconstruction program directed by Vice Admiral (&quot;Generale del Genio navale&quot;) Francesco Rotundi in October 1933. This lasted until June 1937 for &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; and October 1937 for &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;, and resulted in several changes. A new bow section was grafted over the existing bow which increased their length by to and their beam increased to . Their draft at deep load increased to for &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; and for &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;. All of the changes made during their reconstruction increased their displacement to at standard load and at deep load. The ships&#x27; crews increased to 1,260 officers and enlisted men.
Only 40% of the original ship&#x27;s structure remained after the reconstruction was completed.
Two of the propeller shafts were removed and the existing turbines were replaced by two Belluzzo geared steam turbines rated at . The boilers were replaced by eight superheated Yarrow boilers with a working pressure of . On her sea trials in December 1936, before her reconstruction was fully completed, &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; reached a speed of from . In service their maximum speed was about . The ships now carried of fuel oil which provided them with a range of at a speed of .
The center turret and the torpedo tubes were removed and all of the existing secondary armament and AA guns were replaced by a dozen 120-millimeter guns in six twin-gun turrets and eight AA guns in twin turrets. In addition the ships were fitted with a dozen 54-caliber Breda  light AA guns in six twin-gun mounts and twelve Breda M31 anti-aircraft machine guns, also in twin mounts. The guns were bored out to  and their turrets were modified to use electric power, a fixed loading angle of +12 degrees, and the guns could now elevate to +27 degrees. The 320 mm AP shells weighed and had a maximum range of with a muzzle velocity of . In 1940 the 13.2 mm machine guns were replaced by 65-caliber  AA guns in twin mounts. &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; received two more twin mounts as well as four additional 37 mm guns in twin mounts on the forecastle between the two turrets in 1941.
The tetrapodal mast was replaced with a new forward conning tower, protected with thick armor. Atop the conning tower there was a director fitted with two rangefinders, with a base length of .

The deck armor was increased during reconstruction to a total of over the engine and boiler rooms and over the magazines, although its distribution over three decks, each with multiple layers, meant that it was considerably less effective than a single plate of the same thickness. The armor protecting the barbettes was reinforced with plates. All this armor weighed a total of .

The existing underwater protection was replaced by the Pugliese system that consisted of a large cylinder surrounded by fuel oil or water that was intended to absorb the blast of a torpedo warhead. It lacked enough depth to be fully effective against contemporary torpedoes. A major problem of the reconstruction was that the ships&#x27; increased draft meant that their waterline armor belt was almost completely submerged with any significant load.

==Ships==
==Service==

&quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; and &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; served as flagships in the southern Adriatic Sea during World War I, but saw no action and spent little time at sea. &quot;Leonardo da Vinci&quot; was also little used and was sunk by an internal magazine explosion at Taranto harbor on the night of 2/3 August 1916 while loading ammunition. Casualties included 21 officers and 227 enlisted men killed. The Italians blamed Austro-Hungarian saboteurs, but unstable propellant may well have been responsible. The ship was refloated, upside down, on 17 September 1919 and righted on 24 January 1921. The &quot;Regia Marina&quot; planned to modernize her by replacing her center turret with six AA guns, but lacked the funds to do so and sold her for scrap on 22 March 1923.

In 1919, &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; sailed to North America and visited ports in the United States as well as Halifax, Canada. &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; made port visits in the Levant in 1919 and 1920. &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; was mostly inactive in 1921 because of personnel shortages and was refitted at La Spezia from November to March 1922. Both battleships supported Italian operations on Corfu in 1923 after an Italian general and his staff were murdered on the Greco-Albanian border; Benito Mussolini was not satisfied with the Greek Government&#x27;s response so he ordered Italian troops to occupy the island. &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; bombarded the town with her 76 mm guns, killing 20 and wounding 32 civilians.

&quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; escorted King Victor Emmanuel III and his wife aboard &quot;Dante Alighieri&quot;, on a state visit to Spain in 1924 and was placed in reserve upon her return until 1926, when she conveyed Mussolini on a voyage to Libya. The ship was again placed in reserve from 1927 until 1933. Her sister became a gunnery training ship in 1928, after having been in reserve since 1926. &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; was reconstructed at the CRDA Trieste Yard while &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; was rebuilt at Cantieri del Tirreno, Genoa between 1933 and 1937. Both ships participated in a naval review by Adolf Hitler in the Bay of Naples in May 1938 and covered the invasion of Albania in May 1939.
Early in World War II, the sisters took part in the Battle of Calabria (also known as the Battle of Punta Stilo) on 9 July 1940, as part of the 1st Battle Squadron, commanded by Admiral Inigo Campioni, during which they engaged major elements of the British Mediterranean Fleet. The British were escorting a convoy from Malta to Alexandria, while the Italians had finished escorting another from Naples to Benghazi, Libya. Admiral Andrew Cunningham, commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, attempted to interpose his ships between the Italians and their base at Taranto. Crew on the fleets spotted each other in the middle of the afternoon and the Italian battleships opened fire at 15:53 at a range of nearly . The two leading British battleships, and , replied a minute later. Three minutes after she opened fire, shells from &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; began to straddle &quot;Warspite&quot; which made a small turn and increased speed, to throw off the Italian ship&#x27;s aim, at 16:00. At that same time, a shell from &quot;Warspite&quot; struck &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; at a distance of about . The shell pierced the rear funnel and detonated inside it, blowing out a hole nearly across. Fragments started several fires and their smoke was drawn into the boiler rooms, forcing four boilers off-line as their operators could not breathe. This reduced the ship&#x27;s speed to . Uncertain how severe the damage was, Campioni ordered his battleships to turn away in the face of superior British numbers and they successfully disengaged. Repairs to &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; were completed by the end of August and both ships unsuccessfully attempted to intercept British convoys to Malta in August and September.

On the night of 11 November 1940, &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; and &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; were at anchor in Taranto harbor when they were attacked by 21 Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers from the British aircraft carrier , along with several other warships. One torpedo exploded underneath &#x27;B&#x27; turret at 23:15, and her captain requested tugboats to help ground the ship on a nearby sandbank. His admiral vetoed the request until it was too late and &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; had to use a deeper, , sandbank at 04:30 on 12 November. In an effort to lighten the ship, her guns and parts of her superstructure were removed and &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; was refloated on 9 June 1941. Temporary repairs to enable the ship to reach Trieste for permanent repairs took until 22 December. Her guns were operable by September 1942, but replacing her entire electrical system took longer and she was still under repair when Italy surrendered a year later. The &quot;Regia Marina&quot; made plans to replace her secondary and anti-aircraft weapons with a dozen dual-purpose guns in twin mounts, twelve 64-caliber , and twenty-three 65-caliber 20 mm AA guns. Her hulk was damaged in an air raid and capsized on 23 February 1945. Refloated shortly after the end of the war, &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; was scrapped in 1946.
&quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; participated in the Battle of Cape Spartivento on 27 November 1940, but never got close enough to any British ships to fire at them. The ship was damaged in January 1941 by a near miss during an air raid on Naples; repairs were completed in early February. She participated in the First Battle of Sirte on 17 December 1941, providing distant cover for a convoy bound for Libya, again never firing her main armament. In early 1942, &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; was reduced to a training ship at Taranto and later Pola. She steamed to Malta in early September 1943 after the Italian surrender. The unsuccessfully attacked the ship in the Gulf of Taranto in early March 1944.

After the war, &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; was allocated to the Soviet Union as war reparations in 1949, and renamed &quot;Novorossiysk&quot;, after the Soviet city on the Black Sea. The Soviets used her as a training ship when she was not undergoing one of her eight refits in their hands. In 1953, all remaining Italian light AA guns were replaced by eighteen 37 mm 70-K AA guns in six twin mounts and six singles. They also replaced her fire-control systems and added radars, although the exact changes are unknown. The Soviets intended to rearm her with their own 305 mm guns, but this was forestalled by her loss. While at anchor in Sevastopol on the night of 28/29 October 1955, she detonated a large German mine left over from World War II. The explosion blew a hole completely through the ship, making a hole in the forecastle forward of &#x27;A&#x27; turret. The flooding could not be controlled and she later capsized with the loss of 608 men. &quot;Novorossiysk&quot; was stricken from the Navy List on 24 February 1956, salvaged on 4 May 1957, and subsequently scrapped.

<text>Tami Hoag (born Tami Mikkelson; January 20, 1959) is an American novelist, best known for her work in the romance and thriller genres. More than 22 million copies of her books are in print.

==Biography==
Hoag was born in Cresco, Iowa and raised in the small town of Harmony, Minnesota, where her father sold insurance. From childhood, she knew she wanted to be a writer. &quot;I had to spend a lot of time entertaining myself,&quot; she told an interviewer in 2016. &quot;I found books at a really young age and fell in love with books.&quot;

Hoag&#x27;s first job after graduating from high school was in the &quot;La Crosse Tribune&quot; circulation department. Before publishing her first novel, she also worked as a photographer&#x27;s assistant, trained show horses, and sold designer bathroom accessories. She married and divorced Daniel Hoag, whom she had dated in high school.

Hoag began her career as an author in 1988, writing category romances for the Bantam Books Loveswept Line. After several years of success in that field, Hoag switched her focus to single-title suspense novels. She has had thirteen consecutive New York Times bestsellers, including five in a 20-month span. Her novel &quot;Night Sins&quot; became a TV miniseries starring Valerie Bertinelli and Harry Hamlin. Hoag has been invited to do a reading at one of Barbara Bush&#x27;s literacy functions.

Hoag and three other authors who made the leap from romance to thrillers at roughly the same time (Eileen Dreyer, Elizabeth Grayson, and Kimberly Cates) have formed a group they call the Divas. The group provides support and encouragement for each other, and Hoag often thanks them in the acknowledgement section of her books.

Hoag owns horses, and often goes for a ride to combat writer&#x27;s block. She has competed in dressage at a national level, but stopped competing after breaking five vertebrae in her back during a fall while trying out a horse for a friend. Hoag fully recovered from her accident, and has returned to the competition arena. , she was living in Malibu, California, and Wellington, Florida.

<text>McClintockville, Pennsylvania was a small community in Cornplanter Township in Venango County located in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States.

== History ==

Venango County, Pennsylvania was home to an oil boom in the years following discovery of natural oil (petroleum) in the mid-1850s.

George Bissell, a Yale University chemistry professor, and Edwin L. Drake, a former railroad conductor, made the first successful use of a drilling rig on August 28, 1859 at Titusville, Pennsylvania. This single well soon exceeded the entire cumulative oil output of Europe since the 1650s. The principal product of the oil was kerosene.

In 1861, McClintockville was the location of Rogers &amp; Ellis, the first business venture of Henry Huttleston Rogers, who became a leading American businessman, industrialist and financier, with his partner Charles P. Ellis. Rogers and his young wife Abbie Palmer Gifford Rogers lived in a one-room shack there along Oil Creek for several years.

Shortly later, Rogers met oil pioneer Charles Pratt who purchased the entire output of the tiny Wamsutta Oil Refinery. In 1867, Rogers joined Pratt in forming Charles Pratt and Company, which was purchased by Standard Oil in 1874. Rogers became one of the key men in John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Trust.

After joining Standard Oil, Rogers invested heavily in various industries, including copper, steel, mining, and railways. The Virginian Railway is widely considered his final life&#x27;s achievement. Rogers amassed a great fortune, estimated at over $100 million, and became one of the wealthiest men in the United States.

He was also a generous philanthropist, providing many public works for his hometown of Fairhaven and financially assisting helping such notables as Mark Twain, Helen Keller, and Booker T. Washington.

Near McClintockville and Oil City, in western Pennsylvania, there is a Pennsylvania State Park and many heritage sites to tell the story and memorialize the people of the oil boom of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

<text>Rakuten.co.uk is a website owned by Rakuten, that operated as an online marketplace until August 2016.

The website replaced Play.com, which was originally established in Jersey as an online retailer of entertainment products. Rakuten had purchased Play.com in 2011, and in 2013 the company switched to a new third-party marketplace format following a change in the law covering VAT for companies operating in Jersey and selling to consumers on the UK mainland.

The Play.com website was replaced by Rakuten.co.uk on 23 March 2015.

Rakuten.co.uk was relaunched in October 2016 as a portal to earn loyalty &quot;Superpoints&quot; from UK online shops such as Topman, HMV and B&amp;Q.

==History==

===Play.com===

The business was founded in 1998 under the name Play247.com, but rebranded as Play.com in 2000. Play.com originally sold region 1 and 2 DVDs only, but since expanded its range to include CDs and video games and other electronic items. In 2004 it began to sell books and electronics, in 2006 it started selling personal computers, posters and T-shirts and in 2007 it started selling HD DVDs and Blu-rays, with sister site PlayUSA.com selling region 1 DVDs, HD DVDs and region A Blu-ray Discs and offering sales in a range of currencies. The site&#x27;s interface was redesigned on a number of occasions.

Play.com was ranked second on the November 2006 UK &quot;Hot Shops List&quot; compiled by IMRG and Hitwise.

In 2008, Play.com started selling DRM-free MP3s, clothing, accessories, and tickets for events, allowing customers to buy and sell tickets. They also held a consumer games show which was open to the public, with tickets available through Play.com. This event was backed by Sony, Microsoft, Ubisoft, Activision, and THQ among others.

On 15 January 2009, a survey published by Verdict Research found Play.com was the UK&#x27;s second favourite music and video retailer, behind first place Amazon.co.uk and ahead of the now defunct entertainment retailer Zavvi which was third. On 24 February 2009, it was reported that Play.com had topped the National Consumer Satisfaction Index, ahead of Amazon.co.uk and iTunes.

In May 2009, Play.com launched a branded Visa credit card in partnership with MBNA. Cardholders received points for purchases made on the website and at other retailers. Points could then be redeemed against products bought on the Play.com website.

The PlayUSA.com website was closed down in February 2011. In September 2011, Japan-based Rakuten purchased Play.com for £25 million.

From March 2013, Play.com operated solely as an online marketplace, where third party retailers sold products with their listings hosted on the website.

<text>Alicia Ashley (born August 23, 1967) is a Jamaican-American professional boxer who competed from 1999 to 2018. She held the World Boxing Council (WBC) female super bantamweight title twice between 2011 and 2016. Ashley was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2023.

==Personal life==
Born in Jamaica, Ashley moved to the United States at a young age. She is the younger sister of chess grandmaster Maurice Ashley and former world kickboxing champion Devon Ashley.

==Career==
Ashley began her professional boxing career on January 29, 1999, defeating Lisa Howarth by a six-round split decision in Atlantic City, New Jersey. On her second professional boxing fight, held in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, she suffered her first defeat when she was outpointed over six rounds by Doris Hackl on June 20 of that year.

Ashley rebounded from that defeat with an eight-round decision win over Bonnie Canino June 27 at Tunica, Mississippi.

After her first three fights, she took a seven-month hiatus from boxing, but on February 11, 2000, she returned, losing by an eight-round decision to Mexico&#x27;s Laura Serrano, also in Tunica. After splitting her two next fights, she met &quot;Downtown Leona Brown&quot;: on June 29, she beat Brown on points over eight rounds in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Next, she fought Kelsey Jeffries, who, until that bout, had lost only one of her nine fights. On September 3, Ashley beat Jeffries by a six-round unanimous decision in Nevada.

Ashley had only one fight in 2001, a decision victory, and then, on January 13, 2002, she made her Las Vegas debut, drawing (tying) in six rounds with Layla McCarter.

Her next fight fought on February 23 of that year, was also her first world title try, when she and Jeffries were rematched with the vacant IWBF world Featherweight title on the line. Ashley became a world champion by defeating Jeffries, this time by a ten-round split decision, at New Jersey.

Ashley lost her next fight when she met the experienced Chevelle Hallback for Hallback&#x27;s WIBA world Junior Lightweight title by a ten-round unanimous decision in Georgia on August 27.

Ashley then went down in weight, returning to the Super Bantamweight division. On November 15, she defeated Marcela Acuña by a ten-round split decision in Córdoba, Argentina, to win the WIBF&#x27;s vacant world Super Bantamweight title. But this decision win was controversial (the fight was scored 96-94 by two judges for Ashley and 97-95 by the third for Acuña), and the WIBF ordered an immediate rematch between the two women fighters. On June 14, 2003, she and Acuña met again, this time at Buenos Aires. Ashley retained the title the second time around with a ten-round unanimous decision.

On November 15, she lost her title to Esther Schouten by a ten-round split decision in Austria.

Her next was against Shondell Alfred, on March 27, 2004, in Guyana. She defeated Alfred by an eight-round decision.

After a hiatus that lasted almost one year, Ashley returned to boxing on March 3, 2005. when she knocked out Elena Reid in seven rounds at Laughlin, she also fought in the World Combat League.

She lost the fight against Argentina&#x27;s Marcela Eliana Acuna for the WBC female world super bantamweight title by a majority decision at the Estadio Luna Park in Buenos Aires on August 20, 2009.

After winning two fights in New York City, Ashley won the vacant WBC female super bantamweight title via a unanimous decision at the Hunts Point Produce Market in the Bronx on July 23, 2011. On 1 October 2016 at Dort Federal Event Center in Flint Michigan, she lost her title to Fatuma Zarika by split decision.

In 2023, Ashley was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

<text>Ermentrude of Orléans (27 September 823 – 6 October 869) was the Queen of the Franks by her marriage to Charles II. She was the daughter of Odo, count of Orleans and Engeltrude de Fézensac.

== Queenship ==
The traditional historiography on queenship has created an image of a queen who a king&#x27;s &quot;helpmate&quot; and provider of heirs. P.Stafford has examined queenship in a lot of depth, using Ermentrude&#x27;s role in the Carolingian dynasty. They had power within the royal household and partially within the court. Their official duty was running the royal household smoothly, such as directing the children&#x27;s education, supervising the staff and managing the private royal treasury. They unofficially acted as hostesses, ensuring the royal family was not involved in scandals and giving gifts to high-ranking officials in a society where this was important to maintain bonds. As a result, queens were expected to act as wise, loyal and chaste women. 

In particular, Ermentrude was described by a contemporary, John Scotus Eriugena, as a &#x27;strong woman&#x27; (&quot;femina fortis&quot;). 2 letters written in her name survive, a further 5 letters were addressed to her, and 12 charges issued by Charles II had her involved. In her free time, she showed a gift for embroidery.

== Consecration ==
In 866, Ermentrude was consecrated by the Archbishop Hincmar of Rheims during a politically turbulent time regarding his relationship with Charles II. It was the coronation of a wife rather than a bride, as she was crowned over 20 years after her wedding. According to Z. Mistry, the ordination shows two important ideas about Ermentrude and queenship in general: a) dynastic security b) how to be a good wife to a king. 

Throughout the ordination, Ermentrude is repeatedly compared to Sarah from the Bible, and Zubin Mistry concludes that this is an attempt from Hincmar and Charles II to bless the Carolingian dynasty with more heirs through Ermentrude. This is because Sarah struggled to have children until she reaffirmed her faith, showing that fertility and dynastic survival was entwined with devout faith. Fittingly, Ermentrude had an interest in religious foundations and associations with several convents, including Chelles and Avenay.

Zubin Mistry points out that Hincmar also developed an ideology for the behaviour of queens in his ordination and other works. He expected Ermentrude to be ‘loveable like Rachel, wise like Rebecca, loyal like Sarah.’ This list for how to be a good queen was common in Carolingian times, as Eriugena praised Ermentrude for her chastity, piety, and constant prayer, all virtues reminiscent of biblical women.

== Issue ==

<text>The SS Division Hitlerjugend or 12th SS Panzer Division &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot; () was a German armoured division of the Waffen-SS during World War II. The majority of its junior enlisted men were drawn from members of the Hitler Youth, while the senior NCOs and officers were from other Waffen-SS divisions. Most of the enlisted men were teenagers, starting from the ages of 16 or even 15.

The division committed several war crimes while en route to and during the early battles of the Allied Normandy landings, including the Ascq and Normandy massacres, and several massacres, arsons and rapes in the cities of Plomion, Tavaux, Bouillon, Godinne, Hun, Rivere, Warnant and Namur. It first saw action on 7 June 1944 as part of the German defensive operations at Caen against Allied Forces, and suffered great casualties during the Battle of the Falaise Pocket.

In December 1944, the division was committed against the US Army in the Ardennes offensive. After the operation&#x27;s failure, which became known as the Battle of the Bulge, the division was sent to Hungary to participate in fighting around Budapest. The division eventually retreated into Austria and surrendered to the 7th US Army on 8 May 1945. After the war several members of the division, including its former commander Kurt Meyer, were convicted of war crimes.

==Formation and training==
The idea for the Waffen-SS division was first proposed by Artur Axmann, the leader of the Hitler Youth, to &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler in early 1943. The plan for a division made up of Hitler Youth members born in 1926 was passed on to Adolf Hitler for his approval. Hitler approved the plan in February and SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; Gottlob Berger was ordered to recruit the personnel. SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot; Fritz Witt of &quot;1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler&quot; (LSSAH) was appointed the divisional commander. Personnel from the LSSAH provided the regimental, battalion and most of the company commanders for the division.

About 2,000 personnel were transferred from the LSSAH and in September 1943, the division had over 16,000 recruits on its roster, undergoing training in Beverloo Camp in Leopoldsburg, Belgium. The indoctrination was often brutal; while in Allied captivity, an SS man from the division recalled: &quot;In the Waffen-SS you couldn&#x27;t do anything if an Unterfuhrer hit you during the training. The purpose of the training is to make you just as they are; it&#x27;s pure sadism&quot;.

In March 1944 the 12th SS was attached to the I SS Panzer Corps and transferred to Caen in Normandy. At the beginning of June, the division had over 150 tanks.

==Ascq massacre==
The division committed its first massacre while en route to Normandy. The division executed 86 French men on 1 April 1944 in Ascq, France, in a reprisal against the civilian population after the railway they were on was sabotaged. The commander of the convoy, SS-&quot;Obersturmführer&quot; Walter Hauck, ordered troops to search and arrest all male members of the houses on both sides of the track. Altogether, 70 men were shot beside the railway line and another 16 killed in the village. In 1949, Hauck was put on trial in Lille, France, and was sentenced to death. His sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment. He was freed in 1957 after a further sentence reduction.

==Normandy==

On 6 June 1944, the division, along with the 21st Panzer Division, were the closest Panzer divisions to the landing beaches but they were unable to move until ordered by the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW, armed forces high command). The division was ordered to the front at 14:30 hours on 6 June, over twelve hours after the first reports of the landings. Prior to this Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt had ordered over half of the division to deal with a parachute landing on the coast near Lisieux which was found to be dummies from Operation Titanic.

The division&#x27;s advance to the areas near the British–Canadian landing beaches of Sword and Juno proceeded slowly due to Allied air attacks. The first units of the 12th SS reached their assembly area near Evrecy at 22:00 hours on 6 June but the Panther battalion ran out of fuel east of the Orne River. According to Marc Milner, &quot;[t]his was just the first example of sloppy staff work and command and control that characterized 12th SS Division&#x27;s experience in the beachhead battles&quot;.

At 10:00 hours on 7 June, the 25th SS Panzergrenadier Regiment, along with 50 Panzer IV tanks of the 12th SS Panzer Regiment, arrived and moved into position north-west of Caen. Supported by a battalion of artillery (3rd Battalion, 12th SS Panzer Regiment), this battle group was ordered to stop the Canadian advance and drive through to the coast, a few kilometres away. They failed to break through the Canadians around Buron, a kilometre to the north. Meyer countermanded the divisional commander&#x27;s order on his own initiative, feeling that objective unrealistic and hoped merely to stop the flow of Canadian units inland until the situation could be stabilized.

The attack by the division was supposed to have been supported by the 21st Panzer Division but they could not disengage from fighting the British 3rd Infantry Division and were still at Couvre. Casualties of the 25th SS Panzergrenadier Regiment amounted to about 300 men, while 15 tanks from the 12th SS Panzer Regiment were also destroyed. Late on 7 June, the 26th SS Panzergrenadier Regiment under command of SS-&quot;Obersturmbannfuhrer&quot; Wilhelm Mohnke arrived on the battlefield. Meyer had pushed back one part of the Canadian advance but to the west, the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade had occupied a group of small villages three kilometres into the German line. The 26th Panzergrenadier Regiment crossed behind Meyer&#x27;s regiment and took post to the west. The 1st Battalion launched an attack towards Norrey-en-Bessin, defended by the Regina Rifles, 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade, 3rd Canadian Division. Their orders were to overrun the Canadians and force a deep wedge between them and the British to the west. No reconnaissance of the Canadian positions was done and the infantry met intense defensive fire from firmly established positions.

The attack at 03:30 hours on 8 June had little initial success. The various companies in the attacking battalion failed to coordinate effectively and suffered many casualties. Facing Canadian artillery and the supporting heavy machine guns of the Cameron Highlanders of Ottawa, the 1st Battalion of the 12th SS was forced to fall back. Despite their losses, the Regina Rifles stood their ground. The Hitlerjugend division was criticized for performing inadequately in the opening days of the Normandy campaign, with the Canadian Brigadier, Harry Foster, later noting that &quot;no use was made of the fact that the Reginas&#x27; flanks were exposed; instead, the enemy flung himself straight against the strongest points and utterly failed to exploit the undoubted weakness of his opponent&#x27;s position&quot;.
On the Canadian right, the 2nd Battalion attacked the Royal Winnipeg Rifles defending the village of Putot-en-Bessin at 06:30 hours. The battalion managed to break into the village and surround several companies, pushing the Winnipeg Rifles out of the village by 13:00 hours and inflicting 256 casualties – of which 175 were taken prisoner. Later that day, a counter-attack by the Canadian Scottish Regiment, with artillery, tank and tank-destroyer support, re-took Putot with the SS giving up the struggle for the village and withdrawing around midnight. Oliver Haller concluded that &quot;It is evident that the 12th SS was not capable of conducting successful offensive operations against prepared positions in Normandy. Artillery and anti-tank guns were the key to victory, and the Allies possessed large numbers of these effective weapons. All of the German assaults were checked and defeated in detail. The 3rd Canadian Division had won a decisive victory&quot;.

The 3rd Canadian Division ceased major combat operations until July, with only one day of major operations, on 11 June, at the Battle of Le Mesnil-Patry. This saw the 12th SS inflict many casualties on the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada and the 1st Hussars (6th Armoured Regiment) which lost 51 Sherman tanks. Also on 11 June the 46th Royal Marine Commando assaulted Rots. The official historian of Le Régiment de la Chaudière, described the &quot;ferocious battle&quot; including hand-to-hand fighting and &quot;smoldering&quot; tanks, &quot;from each blackened turret hangs the charred corpse of a machine gunner&quot;. The following two weeks was a period of relative quiet, as both sides were exhausted. What did not stop was the constant Allied artillery, naval bombardment and air attacks. Major operations for both sides began again in July, including Operation Windsor and Operation Charnwood.

During Charnwood, the division was driven from its positions in Buron and nearby villages of Gruchy and Cussy and the divisional command post in the Ardenne Abbey, which had been occupied since before D-Day, was lost. Witt was killed in action by a Royal Navy naval artillery barrage which hit the divisional command post at Venoix on 14 June 1944 and Kurt Meyer was placed in command of the division. In August, the division was involved in the fighting around Falaise against the Polish 1st Armoured Division battlegroups who were trying to close the Falaise Pocket. The 12th SS, along with several other German units and panzer ace SS-Oberscharführer Rudolf Roy who destroyed 26 Allied tanks, was instrumental in re-opening the corridor out of the pocket on 20 August, allowing an estimated 10,000 German soldiers to escape encirclement.
During their retreat from France, members of the LSSAH and the Hitlerjugend division murdered 34 French civilians in the towns of Tavaux and Plomion. The units in the division that were not fit for combat were ordered to return to Germany on 8 September, leaving behind a small &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; attached to the SS Division Das Reich. The division losses during the fighting in Normandy, in the three months from June to September, amounted to men, over 80 per cent of its tanks, 70 per cent of its armored vehicles, 60 per cent of its artillery and 50 per cent of its motor vehicles.

==Ardenne Abbey massacre==

Another massacre was committed by the division on its second day of operations during Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of France. During the evening of 7 June, 11 Canadian prisoners of war from the North Nova Scotia Highlanders, the Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry Highlanders and the 27th Armoured Regiment (The Sherbrooke Fusilier Regiment), were shot in the back of the head. After a year of investigations from August 1944 to August 1945, the Canadian War Crimes Commission (CWCC) strove to discover the details of the murders. As commander of the regiment, Kurt Meyer was the prime suspect. At Meyer&#x27;s war crimes trial in December 1945, he was found guilty of inciting his troops to commit murder and of being responsible as a commander for the killings at the Abbey. He was sentenced to death on 28 December 1945; his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1946. He was released in 1954.

==Ardennes offensive==

In September, SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Hubert Meyer was placed in command of the division. In November 1944, the division was sent to Nienburg in Germany, where it was to be reformed. The majority of reinforcements were transferred from Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine personnel. Hubert Meyer was replaced by SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Hugo Kraas, and the division was attached to the 6th SS Panzer Army of SS-&quot;Oberstgruppenführer&quot; Sepp Dietrich, which was forming up for Operation Wacht am Rhein (the Second Battle of the Ardennes, popularly known as the Battle of the Bulge), a large-scale offensive to recapture Antwerp and halt the Allied advance. The operation opened on 16 December 1944, with &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; from the 1st SS Panzer Division &quot;Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler&quot; breaking through the American lines with some difficulty. After the 12th SS reached the front, it was met with heavy resistance from American troops stationed on the Elsenborn Ridge. Despite repeated efforts, the division could not budge the American defenders. As a result, the division was ordered to swing left and follow the advance line of the remainder of the 1st SS Panzer Division. American troops prevented the division from reaching its objective, and after the destruction of &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; from the LSSAH, the advance of Dietrich&#x27;s forces was altogether stopped. On 8 January Hitler gave the authorization to withdraw. The attack was ultimately a failure. The 12th SS had been severely mauled, with only 26 tanks and assault guns and an average of 120 men remaining in each battalion. In total during the offensive the division had lost 9,870 men which included 328 officers and 1,698 NCO&#x27;s. By 28 January 1945, the 12th SS, along with all the German forces, had been pushed back to its starting positions.

==1945==

On 14 January 1945, Dietrich&#x27;s 6th SS Panzer Army was ordered to Hungary where it was to take part in an offensive to recapture the Hungarian oilfields and open the way to Budapest, where 45,000 men of the IX SS Mountain Corps had been encircled. While the division was in transit, the IV SS Panzer Corps launched several unsuccessful relief operations. The division, alongside the LSSAH as a part of I SS Panzer Corps arrived in Hungary in early February 1945, a few days before the city fell. The division next took part in Operation Spring Awakening, another operation to retake the Hungarian oilfields. The attack got underway on 6 March 1945; after initial success, the combination of the muddy terrain and strong Soviet resistance ground them to a halt. On 16 March, the Soviet forces counterattacked in strength, driving the entire southern front into a retreat towards Vienna. The Soviet forces took Vienna on 13 April. Retreating through Odenburg and Hirtenberg, the division reached Linz, Austria near the American lines. On 8 May 1945, 10,000 men of the division surrendered near the town of Enns to the troops of the 65th Infantry Division commanded by Major General Stanley Eric Reinhart.

<doc id="1285078" wikidata="Q486926" url="?curid=1285078" title="Esterel">
<text>Esterel is a synchronous programming language for the development of complex reactive systems. The imperative programming style of Esterel allows the simple expression of parallelism and preemption. As a consequence, it is well suited for control-dominated model designs.

The development of the language started in the early 1980s, and was mainly carried out by a team of Ecole des Mines de Paris and INRIA led by Gérard Berry in France. Current compilers take Esterel programs and generate C code or hardware (RTL) implementations (VHDL or Verilog).

The language is still under development, with several compilers out. The commercial development environment of Esterel is Esterel Studio. The company that commercialized it (Synfora) initiated a normalization process with the IEEE in April 2007 however the working group (P1778) dissolved March 2011. The reference manual is publicly available.

A provisional version of Esterel has been implemented in Racket.

==The multiform notion of time==
The notion of time used in Esterel differs from that of non-synchronous languages in the following way: The notion of physical time is replaced with the notion of order. Only the simultaneity and precedence of events are considered. This means that the physical time does not play any special role. This is called multiform notion of time. An Esterel program describes a totally ordered sequence of logical instants. At each instant, an arbitrary number of events occur (including 0). Event occurrences that happen at the same logical instant are considered simultaneous. Other events are ordered as their instances of occurrences. There are two types of statements: Those that take zero time (execute and terminate in the same instant) and those that delay for a prescribed number of cycles.

==Signals==
Signals are the only means of communication. There are valued and non-valued signals. They are further categorized as being input, output, or local signals. A signal has the property of being either present or absent in an instant. Valued signals also contain a value. Signals are broadcast across the program, and that means any process can read or write a signal. The value of a valued signal can be determined in any instant, even if the signal is absent. The default status of a signal is absent. Signals remain absent until they are explicitly set to present using the emit statement.
Communication is instantaneous, that means that a signal emitted in a cycle is visible immediately. Note that one can communicate back and forth in the same cycle.

===Signal coherence rules===
* Each signal is only present or absent in a cycle, never both.
* All writers run before any readers do.
Thus
 present A else
 emit A
 end
is an erroneous program, since the writer &quot;emit A&quot; should run before the reader &quot;present A&quot;, whereas this program requires &quot;present A&quot; to be performed first.

==The language statements==

===Primitive Esterel statements===

Pure Esterel has eleven primitive statements.

===Derived Esterel statements===

Esterel has several derived constructions:

===Other Esterel statements===

The full Esterel language also has statements for declaring and instantiating modules, for variables, for calling external procedures, and for valued signals.

===Example (ABRO)===
The following program emits the output O as soon as both inputs A and B have been received. Reset the behaviour whenever the input R is received.

 module ABRO:
 input A, B, R;
 output O;
 loop
 [ await A || await B ];
 emit O
 each R
 end module

==Advantages of Esterel==
* Model of time gives programmer precise control
* Concurrency convenient for specifying control systems
* Completely deterministic
* Finite-state language
** Execution time predictable
** Much easier to verify formally
* Can be implemented in hardware as well as in software

==Disadvantages of Esterel==
* Finite-state nature of the language limits flexibility (but expressivity is sufficient for the chosen application field)
* Semantic challenges
** Avoiding causality violations is often difficult
** Difficult to compile in the general case, but simple correctness criteria exist

<doc id="1285090" wikidata="Q2144568" url="?curid=1285090" title="Pan-Iranism">
<text>Pan-Iranism () is a nationalist ideology that espouses the necessity of socio-cultural intimacy between all Iranian peoples.

According to the &quot;Routledge Handbook of Persian Gulf Politics&quot;: &quot;One important point distinguishing the radical nationalism of pan-Iranism from pan-Arab or pan-Turk orientations in the region is the fact that the Iranian version currently does not seem to include irredentist plans in its political program. Rather than demanding the return the lands separated from Iran in the past, such as Afghanistan, Tajikistan, the Republic of Azerbaijan, Bahrain, or the Kurdish areas of Iraq and Turkey, the Pan-Iranist Party emphasizes the cultural integration of the Iranian civilizational basin.&quot;

However, there are some streams of this form of pan-nationalism that promote irredentist views and ambitions, namely by demanding the territorial unification of all Iranian-inhabited lands in West Asia, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and South Asia. More specifically, radical pan-Iranists typically take the view that the historic boundaries of Iran, such as those of the ancient Achaemenid Empire, must be revived to the extent where Iranian peoples are brought closer together under one state.

== Origins and ideology ==

Iranian political scientist Mahmoud Afshar developed the Pan-Iranist ideology in the early 1920s in opposition to Pan-Turkism and Pan-Arabism, which were seen as potential threats to the territorial integrity of Iran. He also displayed a strong belief in the nationalist character of Iranian people throughout the country&#x27;s long history.

On the eve of World War I, pan-Turkists focused on the Turkic-speaking lands of Iran, Caucasus and Central Asia. The ultimate purpose was to persuade these populations to secede from the larger political entities to which they belonged and join the new pan-Turkic homeland. It was the latter appeal to Iranian Azerbaijanis, which, contrary to Pan-Turkist intentions, caused a small group of Azerbaijani intellectuals to become the strongest advocates of the territorial integrity of Iran. After the constitutional revolution in Iran, a romantic nationalism was adopted by Azerbaijani Democrats as a reaction to the pan-Turkist irredentist policies threatening Iran&#x27;s territorial integrity. It was during this period that Iranism and linguistic homogenization policies were proposed as a defensive nature against all others. Contrary to what one might expect, foremost among innovating this defensive nationalism were Iranian Azerbaijanis. They viewed that assuring the territorial integrity of the country was the first step in building a society based on law and a modern state. Through this framework, their political loyalty outweighed their ethnic and regional affiliations. The adoption of these integrationist policies paved the way for the emergence of the titular ethnic group&#x27;s cultural nationalism.

Geographically and culturally, Greater Iran is generally acknowledged to include the entire Iranian plateau and its bordering plains, extending from Mesopotamia and the South Caucasus in the west, to the Indus River in the east, and from the Oxus River in the north to the Persian Gulf and Sea of Oman in the south.

==History==

With the collapse of the Qajar dynasty, which had descended into corruption, and the rise of Reza Shah Pahlavi in 1925, who began introducing secular reforms limiting the power of the Shia clergy, Iranian nationalist and socialist thinkers had hoped that this new era would also witness the introduction of democratic reforms. However, such reforms did not take place. This culminated in the gradual rise of a loosely organized grass roots Pan-Iranist movement made up of nationalist writers, teachers, students, and activists allied with other pro-democracy movements.

In the 1940s, following the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran, the Pan-Iranist movement gained momentum and popularity as a result of the widespread feeling of insecurity among Iranians who saw the king, Reza Shah, powerless against such foreign presence in the country. There were soldiers from Russia, England, India, New Zealand, Australia and later on, America, present in the country, especially in the capital, Tehran. The Allied occupation influenced a series of student movements in 1941. One of these new groups was an underground nationalist guerrilla group called the Revenge group, also known as the Anjoman. The Pan-Iranist Party was founded later on by two of the members of the Revenge group and two other students in the mid-to-late 1940s in Tehran University. Though the pan-Iranist movement had been active throughout the 1930s, it had been a loosely organized grass roots alliance of nationalist writers, teachers, students, and activists. The party was the first organization to officially adopt the pan-Iranist position, which believed in the solidarity and reunification of the Iranian peoples inhabiting the Iranian plateau. In 1951, the party leaders Mohsen Pezeshkpour and Dariush Forouhar came to a disagreement as to how the party should operate, and a division occurred. The two factions greatly differed in their organizational structure and practice. The Pezeskpour faction, which retained the party name, believed in working within the system of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The Forouhar faction, which adopted a new name, Mellat Iran (&quot;Nation of Iran Party&quot;), believed in working against the system.

==&quot;Iran-e Bozorg&quot;==
 was the name periodical published in the city of Rasht by the Armenian political activist Gregory Yeghikian (). It advocated the unification of Iranian peoples (e.g., Afghans, Kurds, etc.) including the Armenians. Yaqikiān believed that, with education and the rising of the levels of people&#x27;s awareness, such a goal was feasible through peaceful means. The journal benefited from the contributions of a number of leading intellectuals of the time, including Moḥammad Moʿin and ʿAli Esfandiāri (Nimā Yušij), and carried articles, poetry, a serialized story, and some news. It also published articles in support of the Kurds who had risen in rebellion in Turkey, which caused the protest of the Turkish counsel in Rasht and led to the banning of the paper by the order of the minister of court. Yaqikiān tried, without success, to have the ban removed and eventually moved to Tehran, where he published the paper Irān-e Konuni.

<text>Jacques Dudon () is a French just intonation composer and instrument builder. He is best known for developing a series of photosonic disk () instruments in the 1980s that produced sound from modulated light (a light source shines through painted glass discs; the resulting patterns of light are picked up by photo cells and converted into a voltage which can then be treated as a sound signal).

The production of synthetic sound in this manner has been used in &quot;optosonic&quot; instruments since the early 20th century (for example the Optophonic Piano). However Dudon&#x27;s method is notable for the generation of tone which is produced by the overlapping of two or three discs, and the opportunities this design provides for timbral shifts by slowing one or more discs manually, thereby altering the waveform.

In the 1970s, he created 150 water instruments called &quot;aquaphones&quot; (described in his pioneering book ), including a &quot;flutabullum&quot;, a system of transforming flute sounds by recording them underwater).

==Aquavina==
The aquavina was an experimental musical instrument created by Jacques Dudon.

It was essentially a variant of the Appalachian dulcimer, but with a metal resonator body partially filled with water. The player would agitate the instrument while playing, resulting in a constant acoustic phasing effect within the instrument&#x27;s harmonics.

<text>Grape-Nuts is a brand of breakfast cereal made from flour, salt and dried yeast, developed in 1897 by C. W. Post, a former patient and later competitor of the 19th-century breakfast food innovator Dr. John Harvey Kellogg. Post&#x27;s original product was baked as a rigid sheet, then broken into pieces and run through a coffee grinder.

== Marketing ==

Grape-Nuts was initially marketed as a natural cereal that could enhance health and vitality, and as a &quot;food for brain and nerve centres.&quot; Its lightweight and compact nature, nutritional value, and resistance to spoilage made it a popular food for exploration and expedition groups in the 1920s and 1930s. In World War II, Grape-Nuts was a component of the lightweight jungle ration used by some U.S. and Allied Forces in wartime operations before 1944.
A 1939 ad campaign by cartoonist Walter Hoban continued his &quot;Jerry on the Job&quot; comic strip in &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot; magazine and daily newspaper comics pages. General Foods also marketed Grape-Nuts through a comics-style advertising campaign (a trailblazer in this regard) featuring a character named Little Alby, who gained inordinate strength after consuming a bowl of Grape-Nuts.

During the 1940s, comic books from various companies featured one-page comic-strip ads starring &quot;Volto from Mars&quot;, a finned red helmet-clad alien superhero visiting Earth, who, like all Martians, recharged his magnetic powers (his left hand repels, his right attracts) by eating &quot;cereal grains&quot;, with him quickly developing a particular fondness for Grape-Nuts Flakes which he proclaimed &quot;the best I ever tasted!&quot;

In the 1960s, advertising promoted Grape-Nuts as the cereal that &quot;fills you up, not out&quot;. Brand users, particularly mother/daughter look-alikes, were shown engaged in fitness activities such as tennis, horseback riding, skiing, and swimming. Also appearing during the &quot;fills you up, not out&quot; campaign were Rob Steffens and Peter Steffens as the characters from &quot;The Peter and Bobert Show&quot;, as well as Andy Griffith and Don Knotts as Sheriff Andy Taylor and Deputy Barney Fife.

This ad campaign produced one television commercial, which aired on television in 1968, that featured a catchphrase that became a target for numerous sketches and satirical mentions in media. Spanning the ensuing two decades and beyond, &quot;Oh no, Mrs. Burke! I thought you were Dale!&quot; was parodied on television variety show sketches, in the film &quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie,&quot; and in many episodes of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000.&quot; Fans continue to discuss the origin of this &quot;riff&quot; and have even developed products that feature the text, &quot;I thought you were Dale.&quot;

A subsequent ad campaign generated another catchphrase, as Euell Gibbons became the spokesperson for the brand, promoting Grape-Nuts as the &quot;Back to Nature Cereal.” The line &quot;Ever eat a pine tree? Many parts are edible&quot; drew attention to the product from consumers, as well as from comedians.

Grape-Nuts is credited as the first widespread product to use a coupon in sales promotion when C. W. Post Company offered a penny-off coupon to get people to try their cereal in the late 1890s.
Until recent years, Grape-Nuts packaging set it apart from other cereals, in that no sealed film bag was used. It was sold in a cardboard box, with perforations similar to cardboard laundry detergent powder boxes, perforations could be broken to form a small opening for pouring, near the intersection of one of the narrow side faces and the top surface, rather than featuring lightly glued interlockable flaps at the top which could be separated to open the top face completely (for flake cereal).

At one time, Grape-Nuts was the seventh-most popular cold breakfast cereal, but sales declined as Post was sold from one company to another. Around 2005, it held less than 1% of the market. About this time, the formula was changed; the husks from milled grain were ground into the flour and the cereal was pitched as &quot;whole grain&quot;, albeit at the cost of roughening the cereal&#x27;s texture and detracting significantly from mouthfeel. The addition of vitamins and minerals allowed it to qualify for food-stamp programs.

== History ==
There are two versions of the Grape-Nuts name&#x27;s origin. One is that Post thought that what he referred to as “grape sugar” (glucose) was created when the product was baked. Since the product has a nutty flavor, he is said to have combined the two into &quot;grape nuts.&quot; The second version is that the product resembles grape seeds, or grape “nuts.”

Grape-Nuts sponsored Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd’s 1933 expedition to Antarctica, which resulted in the first two-way radio transmission. Maps of Admiral Byrd&#x27;s expedition appeared on Grape-Nuts boxes at the time. During World War II, Grape-Nuts were included in the Allied Forces jungle rations on missions to Panama and various other tropical locations. In 1953, Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay brought Grape-Nuts along on their trek to the peak of Mount Everest when they became the first to reach the mountain&#x27;s summit.

Due to production issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic Grape-Nuts were temporarily discontinued in 2021 before returning in mid-March.

== Ingredients ==
Modern-day original Grape-Nuts contain whole grain wheat flour, malted barley flour, salt, dried yeast, and the following added vitamins and minerals: iron, vitamin B3, zinc oxide, vitamin B6, vitamin B1, and folic acid. Grape-Nuts Flakes contain sugar as well.

== Ice cream ==
Grape-Nuts ice cream is a popular regional dish in the Canadian Maritimes, the Shenandoah Valley, Panama, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, and New England. One origin story is that it was created by chef Hannah Young at The Palms restaurant in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, in 1919. She created it when she ran out of fresh fruit to add to ice cream and decided to throw in some cereal. It proved popular at the restaurant and the Scotsburn Dairy company began mass-producing the ice cream variety, and it sold across the region. Variations of ice cream with Grape-Nuts are also called brown bread ice cream.

<doc id="1285108" wikidata="Q718169" url="?curid=1285108" title="Ibn al-Shatir">
<text>ʿAbu al-Ḥasan Alāʾ al‐Dīn bin Alī bin Ibrāhīm bin Muhammad bin al-Matam al-Ansari, known as Ibn al-Shatir or Ibn ash-Shatir (; 1304–1375) was an Arab astronomer, mathematician and engineer. He worked as &quot;muwaqqit&quot; (موقت, timekeeper) in the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus and constructed a sundial for its minaret in 1371/72.

== Biography ==
Ibn al-Shatir was born in Damascus, Mamluk Sultanate around the year 1304. His father died when he was six years old. His grandfather took him in which resulted in Ibn al-Shatir learning the craft of inlaying ivory. Ibn al-Shatir traveled to Cairo and Alexandria to study astronomy, where he fell in, inspired him. After completing his studies with Abu &#x27;Ali al-Marrakushi, Ibn al-Shatir returned to his home in Damascus where he was then appointed &quot;muwaqqit&quot; (timekeeper) of the Umayyad Mosque. Part of his duties as &quot;muqaqqit&quot; involved keeping track of the times of the five daily prayers and when the month of Ramadan would begin and end. To accomplish this, he created a variety of astronomical instruments. He made several astronomical observations and calculations both for the purposes of the mosque, and to fuel his later research. These observations and calculations were organized in a series of astronomical tables. His first set of tables, which have been lost over time, allegedly combined his observations with those of Ptolemy, and contained entries on the Sun, Moon and Earth.

==Astronomy==
Ibn al-Shatir′s most important astronomical treatise was &quot;kitab nihayat al-sul fi tashih al-usul&quot; (نهاية السول في تصحيح الاصول &quot;The Final Quest Concerning the Rectification of Principles&quot;). In it he refined the Ptolemaic models of the Sun, Moon and planets. His model incorporated the Urdi lemma, and eliminated the need for an equant (a point on the opposite side of the center of the larger circle from the Earth) by introducing an extra epicycle (the Tusi-couple), departing from the Ptolemaic system in a way that was mathematically identical (but conceptually very different) to what Nicolaus Copernicus did in the 16th century. This new planetary model was published in his work the &quot;al-Zij al-jadid (الزيج الجديد The New Planetary Handbook.)&quot; Before the &quot;kitab nihayat al-sul fi tashih al-usul&quot; was made, there was a treatise that Ibn al-Shatir made which described the observations and procedures that lead to him creating his new planetary models.

Drawing on the observation that the distance to the Moon did not change as drastically as required by Ptolemy&#x27;s lunar model, Ibn al-Shatir produced a new lunar model that replaced Ptolemy&#x27;s crank mechanism with a double epicycle model that computed a more accurate range of distances of the Moon from the Earth.

=== Solar Model ===
Ibn al-Shatir&#x27;s Solar Model exemplifies his commitment towards accurate observational data, and its creation serves as a general improvement towards the Ptolemaic model. When observing the Ptolemaic solar model, it is clear that most of the observations are not accounted for, and cannot accommodate the observed variations of the apparent size of the solar diameter. Because the Ptolemaic system contains some faulty numerical values for its observations, the actual geocentric distance of the Sun had been greatly underestimated in its solar model. And with the problems that had arisen from the Ptolemaic models, there was an influx of need to create solutions that would resolve them. Ibn al-Shatir&#x27;s model aimed to do just that, creating a new eccentricity for the solar model. And with his numerous observations, Ibn al-Shatir was able to generate a new maximum solar equation (2;2,6°), which he found to have occurred at the mean longitude λ 97° or 263° from the apogee. As the method was deciphered through geometric ways, it was easy to identify that 7;7 and 2;7 were the radii of the epicycles. In addition, his final results for apparent size of the solar diameter were concluded to be &quot;at apogee&quot; (0;29,5), &quot;at perigee&quot; (0;36,55), and &quot;at mean distance&quot; (0;32.32). This was partially done by reducing Ptolemy&#x27;s circular geometric models to numerical tables in order to perform independent calculations to find the longitude of the planets. The longitude of the planets was defined as a function of the mean longitude and the anomaly. Rather than calculating every possible value, which would be difficult and labor-intensive, four functions of a single value were calculated for each planet and combined to calculate quite accurately the true longitude of each planet.

To calculate the true longitude of the moon, Ibn al-Shatir assigned two variables, η, which represented the Moon&#x27;s mean elongation from the Sun, and γ, which represented its mean anomaly. To any pair of these values was a corresponding e, or equation which was added to the mean longitude to calculate the true longitude. Ibn al-Shatir used the same mathematical scheme when finding the true longitudes of the planets, except for the planets the variables became α, the mean longitude measured from apogee (or the mean center) and γ which was the mean anomaly as for the moon. A correcting function c3&#x27; was tabulated and added to the mean anomaly γ to determine the true anomaly γ&#x27;. As shown in Shatir&#x27;s model, it was later discovered that Shatir&#x27;s lunar model had a very similar concept as Copernicus. Ibn al-Shatir never gave motivation towards his two epicycles to be adopted, so it was hard to tell the difference between his model and the Ptolemaic model.

===Possible influence on Nicolaus Copernicus===
Although Ibn al-Shatir&#x27;s system was firmly geocentric (he had eliminated the Ptolemaic eccentrics), the mathematical details of his system were identical to those in Copernicus&#x27;s &quot;De revolutionibus&quot;. Furthermore, the exact replacement of the equant by two epicycles used by Copernicus in the &quot;Commentariolus&quot; paralleled the work of Ibn al-Shatir one century earlier. Ibn al-Shatir&#x27;s lunar and Mercury models are also identical to those of Copernicus. Copernicus also translated Ptolemy&#x27;s geometric models to longitudinal tables in the same way Ibn al Shatir did when constructing his solar model. This has led some scholars to argue that Copernicus must have had access to some yet to be identified work on the ideas of Ibn al-Shatir. It is unknown whether Copernicus read Ibn al-Shatir and the argument is still debated. The differences between the two can be seen in their works. Copernicus followed a heliocentric model (planets orbit the Sun) while Ibn al-Shatir followed the geocentric model (as mentioned earlier). Also Copernicus followed the inductive reasoning while Ibn al-Shatir followed the Zij traditions. A Byzantine manuscript containing a solar model diagram with a second epicycle, was discovered to have been in Italy at the time of Copernicus. The presence of this eastern manuscript containing the ideas of Islamic scholars in Italy provides potential evidence of transmission of astronomical theories from the East to Western Europe.

==Instruments==
The idea of using hours of equal time length throughout the year was the innovation of Ibn al-Shatir in 1371, based on earlier developments in trigonometry by al-Battānī. Before the Islamicate scholar created the improved sundial, he had to understand the sundial created by his predecessors. The Greek had sundials too, but they had nodus-based with straight hour lines which meant that the hours in the day would be unequal (temporary hours) depending on the season. Each day was split into twelve equal segments which meant that the hours would have been shorter in the winter and longer in the summer due to the activity of the sun. Ibn al-Shatir was aware that &quot;using a gnomon that is parallel to the Earth&#x27;s axis will produce sundials whose hour lines indicate equal hours on any day of the year.&quot; His sundial is the oldest polar-axis sundial still in existence. The concept later appeared in Western sundials from at least 1446.

Ibn al-Shatir also invented a timekeeping device called &quot;Sandūq al‐Yawāqīt li maʿrifat al-Mawāqīt&quot; (صندوق اليواقيت لمعرفة المواقيت jewel box), which incorporates both a universal sundial and a magnetic compass. He invented it for the purpose of finding the times of prayers. The &quot;Sandūq al‐Yawāqīt li maʿrifat al-Mawāqīt&quot; had a moveable hole in it which allowed the user to find the hour angle of the sun. If this angle was suitable with the horizon, then the user could use it as a polar sundial. This device is preserved in the museum of Aleppo (largest museum in the city of Aleppo, Syria). He also created a sundial which was placed on top of the Madhanat al-Arus (The Minaret of the Bride) in the Umayyad Mosque. The sundial was created on a slab of marble which was approximately 2 meters by 1 meter. The sundial being engraved on the marble was so that Ibn al-Shatir could read the time of the day in equinoctial (equal times) hours for the prayer times. This sundial was later removed in the eighteenth century and a replica was put in its place. The original sundial was placed in the Damascus archeology museum. He also created another sundial but in smaller dimensions (12 cm x 12 cm × 3 cm) to find out the prayer times of midday and the afternoon. This sundial was able to tell the local meridian and the direction of Mecca (located in Saudi Arabia).

Other notable instruments made by him include a reversed astrolabe and an astrolabic clock. The astrolabe that he created was called the &quot;al‐āla al‐jāmiʿa&quot; (الآلة الجامعة the universal instrument). This astrolabe was created by Ibn al-Shatir when he wrote on the ordinary planispheric astrolabe and when he wrote on the two most common quadrants (the astrolabic and the trigonometric varieties). These two common quadrants were modified versions of the sine quadrant. He also created a set of tables that had values of spherical astronomical functions for prayer times. The tables displayed the times for the morning, afternoon, and evening prayers. The latitude that was used to create the table was 34° (which was correspondent to a location north of Damascus).

<text>Agesipolis I (; died 380 BC) was the twenty-first of the kings of the Agiad dynasty in ancient Sparta.

Agesipolis succeeded his father Pausanias, while still a minor, in 394 BC, and reigned fourteen years. Upon the death of Pausanias, Agesipolis and his brother, Cleombrotus I, were both placed under the guardianship of Aristodemus, their nearest relative. Agesipolis came to the crown just about the time that the confederacy (partly brought about by the intrigues of the Persian satrap Tithraustes), which was formed by Thebes, Athens, Corinth, and Argos, against Sparta, rendering it necessary to recall his colleague, Agesilaus II, from Asia; and the first military operation of his reign was the expedition to Corinth, where the forces of the confederates were assembled.

The Spartan army was led by Aristodemus, and gained a victory over the allies. In 390 Agesipolis, who had now come of age, was entrusted with the command of an army for the invasion of Argolis. Having procured the sanction of the Olympic and Delphic gods for disregarding any attempt which the Argives might make to stop his march, on the pretext of a religious truce, he carried his ravages still farther than Agesilaus had done in 393; but as he suffered the aspect of the victims to deter him from occupying a permanent post, the expedition yielded no fruit but the plunder.

In 385 the Spartans, seizing upon some frivolous pretexts, sent an expedition against Mantineia, in which Agesipolis undertook the command, after it had been declined by Agesilaus. In this expedition the Spartans were assisted by Thebes, and in a battle with the Mantineans, the Theban generals Epaminondas and Pelopidas narrowly escaped death. Agesipolis took the town by diverting the river Ophis, so as to put the low ground at the foot of the city walls under water. The basements, being made of unbaked bricks, were unable to resist the action of the water. The walls soon began to totter, and the Mantineans were forced to surrender. They were admitted to terms on condition that the population should be dispersed among the four hamlets, out of which it had been collected to form the capital. The democratic leaders were permitted to go into exile.

Early in 382, an embassy came to Sparta from the cities of Acanthus and Apollonia, requesting assistance against the Chalkidian League, who were endeavoring to compel them to join their confederacy. The Spartans granted it, but were not at first very successful. After the defeat and death of Teleutias in the second campaign in 381 Agesipolis took the command. He set out in 381, but did not begin operations until the spring of 380. He then acted with great vigor, and took Toroni by storm; but in the midst of his successes he was seized with a fever, which carried him off in seven days. He died in the town of Aphytis, in the peninsula of Pallene. His body was immersed in honey and conveyed home to Sparta for burial.

Though Agesipolis did not share the ambitious views of foreign conquest cherished by Agesilaus, his loss was deeply regretted by Agesilaus, who seems to have had a sincere regard for him. He was succeeded as king by his brother Cleombrotus I. Paul Cartledge, however, suggests that Agesilaus&#x27; grief was partly due to the loss of a malleable &quot;partner in crime&quot;.

<doc id="1285118" wikidata="Q5373847" url="?curid=1285118" title="Empeg Car">
<text>The Empeg Car was one of the first in-car MP3 players developed. Originating in a personal project to build an in-car system that could perform MP3 playback in software, a British company called &quot;Empeg&quot; was formed in July 1998 to build a commercial version of the concept, this becoming available for sale in August 1999.

Although the original project employed an embedded PC board from Advantech running a Linux-based operating system, employing a 150 MHz Cyrix processor that was later upgraded to a 166 MHz Pentium, the Empeg Car was built around a system employing a StrongARM processor. Transfer of MP3 tracks to the player was facilitated by the provision of USB, Ethernet, and serial port connections. Initial production was limited to 400 units, after which the &quot;mark II&quot; version of the product, suitable for larger scale production, was to be offered from late 2000 onwards at an estimated starting price of around £900.

Prices started at $1,100 US for the 4GB version, reaching up to $2,400 for a 28GB unit that utilized two laptop drives (which was considered very large capacity at the time). The Empeg Car garnered quite a following and became beloved among the small group of users who bought one.

SONICblue - the former S3 company that had already acquired both the Rio line of MP3 portables by purchasing Diamond and the Rave-MP line by purchasing Sensory Science - took notice of the unit and decided the Empeg Car would fit into its plans. On November 1, 2000 Empeg was acquired by SONICblue Incorporated and the unit was renamed the Rio Car. The original British development team was rolled into the company and eventually took responsibility for all audio software development at SONICblue.

Unfortunately, SONICblue did not have a clear game plan with how to promote the Rio Car. Rio did little to market it and soon left it to languish. Despite their owners&#x27; strong devotion to the product, sales of new units were modest and on September 24, 2001 SONICblue discontinued the line. Fewer than 6000 players were ever produced.

Most of the resources, including people, code, and design work, behind the Empeg Car went into the following products:
*Rio Receiver - Network enabled client for streaming music off a computer to anywhere in the home
*Rio Central - A home stereo component that ripped CDs to MP3s and stored them on an internal hard drive. Supported Rio Receivers as clients.
*Rio Karma - Portable 20gb music player

SONICblue went bankrupt in 2003, but the Rio division was purchased by D&amp;M Holdings. The former Empeg employees still with Rio went on to produce the Rio Karma, the Rio Carbon, and several recent flash memory players. In 2005, D&amp;M sold all of their audio player technology to SigmaTel, including all of the Empeg technology, and all of the patents, source code, and designs related to the Rio audio players. The former Empeg employees as well as other Rio technical employees are now employed by SigmaTel at their Austin, TX offices.

<doc id="1285127" wikidata="Q1569468" url="?curid=1285127" title="The Ghost Busters">
<text>The Ghost Busters is a live-action children&#x27;s sitcom that ran on CBS in 1975, about a team of bumbling detectives who investigate ghostly occurrences. Fifteen episodes were produced. The show reunited Forrest Tucker and Larry Storch in roles similar to their characters in &quot;F Troop&quot;.

The series is unrelated to the 1984 film &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (although Columbia Pictures did pay Filmation a significant fee for a license to use the name). Like the film, the series spawned its own animated sequel in 1986.

The series utilizes slapstick, with scenes centered on the perpetual bumbling of the characters, good and evil alike. The series also makes references to classic cinema; the names &quot;Spencer&quot; and &quot;Tracy&quot; were taken from the actor Spencer Tracy, while the name Kong – not given to the gorilla – was an homage to King Kong.

==Premise==
Spencer, Tracy, and Kong, bumbling paranormal detectives, billed themselves as &quot;The Ghost Busters.&quot; Kong (Tucker) was the leader of the trio with Spencer (Storch) as his partner, and Tracy (a gorilla, played by Burns) as their assistant who also drove their barely-functional jalopy. Their headquarters was situated in a run down office building in an unspecified city. Outside of normal office equipment, plus a large armoire on which Tracy hung numerous hats including his trademark beanie with a propeller, the office itself was also dilapidated, with peeling wallpaper and a pay phone near the door as the Ghost Busters&#x27; only means of communicating with prospective clients. 

Spencer&#x27;s name on the office door was misspelled &quot;Spenser.&quot; His first name was given as Eddie in the second episode, &quot;Dr. Whatsisname.&quot; Kong&#x27;s first name was never mentioned in the original series. 

Each episode consisted of the same formula: in the pre-credits teaser, a ghost or monster- usually accompanied by a half-witted sidekick, would manifest and vow to wreak havoc or vengeance on a particular person, the city, or even the world. After the credits, Kong would send Tracy and Spencer to a general store to get their next assignment from the unseen &quot;Zero&quot; (voiced by Scheimer). The tape-recorded message was usually hidden inside an everyday object such as a bicycle, typewriter, or toy. In a parodic homage to &quot;&quot;, the recording would end with Zero saying, &quot;This message will self-destruct in five seconds&quot;; after Tracy counted down the seconds, the message- and often the item in which it was hidden, would explode in Tracy&#x27;s face.

The Ghost Busters&#x27; assignments would invariably take them to the same place, a spooky castle with an adjoining graveyard on the city&#x27;s outskirts; Kong would point out that the castle was the only one in or near the city. After a series of farcical chases, the ghouls would be cornered and dispatched back to the netherworld by means of a &quot;Ghost De-Materializer&quot;, usually activated by Kong as he triumphantly shouted &quot;Zap!&quot;

===Ghosts and monsters===
The show frequently made use of ghostly characters and other characters from popular and literary culture, as well as real-life historical figures. These included:
* Dr. Frankenstein and his monster

==Production==
In an interview conducted with Bob Burns III in 2007, he revealed that all 15 episodes were taped in a span of 9 weeks, every other day. Burns also revealed that the show did well enough in the ratings to warrant a second season, coming in at number two behind &quot;The Shazam!/ISIS Hour&quot;, but Filmation decided instead to put more money into its number-one program, thus canceling the show after one season. Though the series ended, reruns were broadcast for some time afterward.

==Sequel==
In 1986, after the success of the Columbia &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; film, the show was revived in animated format with Kong and Spencer&#x27;s sons, Jake and Eddie Jr., inheriting their fathers&#x27; business (and Tracy the Gorilla) in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;.

In addition, unlike many of BCI Ink &amp; Paint&#x27;s other Filmation releases, this DVD set appears to have been sourced from the original NTSC videotapes (the show having been recorded on tape rather than shot on film).

Prior to this, there were at least three VHS tapes released by Continental Video during the 1980s. These are now extremely hard to find. The show was billed as &quot;The Original Ghostbusters&quot;.

Australia received the complete series on DVD in a two-disc set on July 11, 2016.

As of 2009, this release has been discontinued and is out of print as BCI Eclipse has ceased 
operations.

Mill Creek Entertainment announced the re-release of the series on DVD.

<doc id="1285129" wikidata="Q2305337" url="?curid=1285129" title="Azerbaijan People's Government">
<text>The Azerbaijan People&#x27;s Government (; ) was a short-lived unrecognized secessionist state in northern Iran from November 1945 to December 1946. Like the unrecognized Republic of Mahabad, it was a puppet state of the Soviet Union. Established in Iranian Azerbaijan, the Azerbaijan People&#x27;s Government capital was the city of Tabriz. It was headed by an ethno-separatist and communist government led by the Azerbaijani Democratic Party, which also followed a pan-Turkist discourse. Its establishment and demise were a part of the Iran crisis, an early event in the Cold War.

==History==
To supply the Soviet forces with war material through Iran, British and Soviet troops jointly occupied the country in August 1941. Soviet forces entering Iranian territory from the Armenian SSR and the Azerbaijan SSR and British and Indian forces entering from Iraq soon took the control of the country. On 16 September, the British forced Reza Shah to abdicate in favor of his son Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, who ruled until 1979.

With the dethronement of Reza Shah in September 1941, Soviet troops captured Tabriz and northwestern Iran for military and strategic reasons. The Azerbaijan People&#x27;s Government, set up by the Soviets, under leadership of Ja&#x27;far Pishevari was proclaimed in Tabriz in 1945. Lavrenti Beria was nominally in charge of the operation, but delegated it to Mir Jafar Baghirov, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan in Baku. The Democratic Party of Azerbaijan was also created by the direct order of Joseph Stalin and capitalized on some local people&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the centralization policies of Reza Shah. It was supplied with money and weapons by the USSR. Stalin wanted to make pressure on Iran to get an oil concession in Iranian Azerbaijan. During this time, a revival of the Azerbaijani literary language, which had largely been supplanted by Persian, was promoted with the help of writers, journalists, and teachers from the Azerbaijan SSR. In the quest of imposing national homogeneity on the country where half of the population consisted of ethnic minorities, Reza Shah had previously issued in quick succession bans on the use of Azerbaijani language on the premises of schools, in theatrical performances, religious ceremonies, and, finally, in the publication of books.

The U.S. supported the Iranian complaint against Soviet actions lodged with the Security Council in Resolution 3 and Resolution 5; in mid December 1946, the U.S. supported the shah&#x27;s government in sending the Iranian army to re-occupy Mahabad and Azerbaijan. The leaders of the Azerbaijan enclave in Iran fled to the Azerbaijan SSR, and the leaders of the Kurdish Republic were tried and sentenced to death. They were hanged in Chwarchira Square in the center of Mahabad in 1947.

1947&#x27;s efforts centered on the issue of Soviet designs on Iran&#x27;s northern oil resources. Following the election that year of a new Majlis, the newly elected deputies were reluctant to ratify the Soviet-Iranian oil agreement, which had been concluded under duress in March 1946 and had granted the Soviets 51% ownership and &quot;de facto&quot; control. On September 11, 1947, U.S. ambassador George V. Allen publicly decried intimidation and coercion used by foreign governments to secure commercial concessions in Iran, and promised full U.S. support for Iran to freely decide about its own natural resources. With this unequivocal encouragement, the Majlis refused to ratify the Soviet oil agreement on October 22, 1947; the vote was 102 to 2.

==Establishment==
The &quot;Firqah-i Dimukrat&quot;, or Azerbaijani Democratic Party (ADP), publicly announced its formation in Tabriz on 3 September 1945 by a group of veteran communists headed by Ja&#x27;far Pishevari. After the announcement, the communist, Soviet-supported Tudeh party dissolved its Azerbaijan chapter and ordered its members to join ADP. ADP expanded throughout Iranian Azerbaijan, and initiated a local coup d&#x27;état with help from Soviet army, who prevented the Iranian army from intervening. During the first week of September 1945, the Azerbaijani Democratic Party, led by Ja&#x27;far Pishevari, a long-time leader of the revolutionary movement in Gilan, declared itself to be in control of Iranian Azerbaijan, promised liberal democratic reforms, and disbanded the local branch of Tudeh. Later in September 1945, at its first congress, the Azerbaijani Democratic Party authorized the formation of a peasant&#x27;s militia. This militia started a bloodless coup on 18 November 1945 and by 21 November they had captured all remaining government posts in the province, and Iranian Azerbaijan &quot;became an autonomous republic under the direction of a 39-member national executive committee&quot;. The power seems to have been exercised by Mohammed Biriya, the Minister of Propaganda and head of the local secret police.
At the same time, the US was steadily increasing its military assistance to the Iranian government. Under pressure by the Western powers, the Soviet Union revoked its support of the newly created state and the Iranian military succeeded in re-establishing Iranian rule in November 1946. According to Tadeusz Swietochowski:

===Soviet support===
Declassified documents from the Cold War implicates the USSR in forming the government of Pishevari by the direct orders of Stalin. The Soviet military supported the new autonomous entity and prevented the Iranian army from restoring governmental control over the area. After the Soviet withdrawal, Iranian troops entered the region in December 1946 and Pishevari and his cabinet fled to the Soviet Union. According to Prof. Gary R. Hess:

==Dissolution==
On 13 June 1946, an agreement was reached between the Central Government in Tehran and the delegates from Azerbaijan, headed by Pishevari. Under the agreement, Pishevari agreed to abandon the APG&#x27;s autonomy, to relinquish its ministries and premiership, and to become once more part of Iran. Its parliament was to be transformed into a provincial council – a system recognized and provided for in the Iranian Constitution.

By mid-December 1946, the Iranian army, backed by the United States and the British, reentered Tabriz, thus putting an end to Azerbaijan People&#x27;s Government after a full year of its existence. During the lawless interregnum, approximately 500 supporters of the Ferqeh were killed. According to the U.S. Supreme Court Justice, William O. Douglas, while the Red Army had been on its best behavior when stationed in Azerbaijan, the Iranian Army behaved as an occupying force and brutalized the local inhabitants. The beards of peasants were burned, their wives and daughters raped. Houses were plundered and livestock were stolen. The Army left a trail of death and destruction behind it.

Many of the leaders took refuge in the Azerbaijan SSR. Ja&#x27;far Pishevari died in a car accident in Baku in 1947. Prime Minister Kordary was jailed for many years by the Shah and later released due to the efforts of his brother Kazem Kordary.

<text>The Honda Domani () is a car made by Honda and marketed in east Asia, including Japan. The car was mutually developed during Rover&#x27;s collaboration with Honda. It was introduced on 4 November 1992, replacing the Concerto in Honda&#x27;s lineup, although that model lasted until 1995 in Europe. 

The Domani was another example of Honda taking one product and selling multiple versions at different dealership sales channels in Japan, called &quot;Honda Clio&quot; for the more upscale Domani, Honda Integra SJ at &quot;Honda Verno&quot; locations from 1996 to 2000. 

This was while &quot;Honda Primo&quot; sold the mechanically identical but aesthetically different Civic Ferio, along with the Civic three and five door hatchbacks. &quot;Domani&quot; is Italian for &quot;tomorrow&quot;. In Japan, the Domani was also rebadged as the Isuzu Gemini.
== First generation: MA4-7 (1992–1997) ==
It is mechanically identical to the early 1990s version of the Honda Civic (chassis code EG) and production ended in 1997. The Domani sedan had 1.6-liter and 1.8-liter engines at first (from 1992 to 1997), and also a 1.5-liter gasoline engine from 1994 onwards. It was offered as a four-door sedan only, in Ri, Vi, Si, Si G and Ri F trims. The Si and Si G had the 1.8-liter engine installed.

In Europe, five-door hatchback and wagon variants were available, replacing the Concerto sedan and five-door hatchback. The United Kingdom received two VTi trims of the Domani (&quot;Civic&quot;), chassis codes MB6 (five-door hatch) and MC2 (five-door estate) with the 1.8-litre DOHC VTEC B18C4 4-cylinder engine. They were sold there as the Honda Civic. 

The version for Japan also was available with Honda&#x27;s Real-Time Four Wheel Drive System, especially on RiF models.

The Honda Domani has a very close relative in the saloon of the Rover 400, with which it shared virtually all its main components. Renamed the Rover 45 when facelifted in the end of 1999, it was also sold as the MG ZS from August 2001. The Rover/MG derivatives were produced, with numerous facelifts, until the Rover Group went into administration in April 2005, by which time the design was thirteen years old.

== Second generation: MB3-5 (1997–2000) ==

The second generation was introduced on January 31, 1997. It was based on the EK Civic.

In Japan, the second-generation Domani was introduced in four variants: X, G, and G 4WD, all equipped with the D16A engine, and the E variant, featuring the 15B engine. Each variant included SRS airbag systems for both the driver and passenger seats. The X variant came with an ABS system as standard, while ABS was available as an optional feature for the other models.

A version for the market of Canada of the second generation Domani was built alongside the Civic in Alliston, Ontario, called the Acura 1.6 EL. This car was also exported back to Japan and Taiwan as the Honda Domani. In Japan, the Domani was replaced by the Honda Fit Aria as the compact sedan at &quot;Honda Clio&quot; dealerships for the model year of 2002. In 2006, the EL is replaced by the Acura CSX in Canada.

<text>Paekākāriki () is a town in the Kāpiti Coast District in the south-western North Island, New Zealand, and one of the northernmost towns of the wider Wellington region. It lies north of Porirua and northeast of the Wellington CBD. The town&#x27;s name comes from the Māori language and can mean &quot;parakeet perch&quot;. Paekākāriki had a population of 1,665 at the time of the 2013 census, up 66 from the 2006 census.

Paekākāriki lies on a narrowing of the thin coastal plain between the Tasman Sea and the Akatarawa Ranges (a spur of the Tararua Ranges), and thus serves as an important transportation node. To the south, State Highway 59 climbs towards Porirua; to the north the plains extend inland from the Kāpiti Coast; at Paekākāriki the highway and North Island Main Trunk railway run close together between the coast and hills. Paekākāriki is also served by the nearby Transmission Gully and Kāpiti Expressway (both part of State Highway 1).

==Etymology==
The town&#x27;s name comes from the Māori language &quot;Paekākāriki&quot;. &quot;Pae&quot; in Māori can mean &#x27;perch&#x27; and &quot;kākāriki&quot; &#x27;parakeet&#x27;, so &quot;pae kākāriki&quot; can mean &#x27;parakeet perch&#x27;. Though usually written in English without macrons, the New Zealand Geographic Board changed the official name to &quot;Paekākāriki&quot; on 21 June 2019.

The name was also spelt &quot;Paikakariki&quot; prior to 1905.

==History==

Prior to European settlement, the area was contested by Māori groups including Rangitāne and Muaūpoko. During the 1820s the war leader Te Rauparaha defeated and expelled the earlier inhabitants and claimed the region for Ngāti Toa and their allies. Ngāti Haumia, a hapū of Ngāti Toa, built their pa by the mouth of the Wainui steam at the northern end of Paekākāriki. Te Rauparaha, whose pa was on nearby Kapiti Island, died in 1849, the same year that a road connecting Paekākāriki with Porirua was completed. In 1850 the New Zealand Government resettled Wainui&#x27;s inhabitants and merged their pa with the new settlement of Paekākāriki.

Paekākāriki&#x27;s history has been intimately linked with the railway, and there is a museum at the Paekākāriki railway station commemorating this heritage. In 1886 the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company&#x27;s line from Wellington to Longburn was completed, and Paekākāriki became an important stop on the journey. In 1908, the line was incorporated into the national network of the New Zealand Railways Department and became part of the North Island Main Trunk linking Wellington and Auckland, the North Island&#x27;s most important line. In 1917, NZR withdrew dining cars from its passenger trains due to World War I economic difficulties and Paekākāriki became a main refreshment stop on the trip north; originally a temporary measure, the dining cars did not return for decades and Paekākāriki&#x27;s status remained until the 1960s.

From 1940 the line south to Wellington through the new Tawa Flat deviation was electrified and at Paekakariki engines were changed, with a steam engine depot at Paekakariki. Electrified commuter services were also extended to Paekakariki. The locomotive depot gradually declined in importance due to changing motive power, and nowadays only FP/FT &quot;Matangi&quot; class electric multiple units are stabled here. The old steam locomotive depot is now the location of &quot;The Engine Shed&quot;, the base of Steam Incorporated, one of New Zealand&#x27;s premier railway preservation societies. The Paekakariki Station Precinct Trust has been established to manage the station area, including the museum and Steam Incorporated&#x27;s depot, and firmly establish it as a historical and tourist attraction.

During the Second World War Paekākāriki served as a major base for US Marines fighting in the Pacific Campaign. There were three main camps, all situated in or adjacent to present-day Queen Elizabeth Park. At the height of the occupation there were over 20,000 Americans stationed in the region, significantly outnumbering locals. The camps were used for training purposes, as well as rest and recreation for those returning from the Pacific combat zone. Paekākāriki&#x27;s steep surrounding hills proved suitable terrain for marching and mortar practice, whilst its beaches were used to stage amphibian invasions. They were the scene of an unfortunate tragedy in June 1943 when a landing craft was swamped by a wave during a nighttime training exercise. Nine men drowned in the heavy surf according to official figures; local rumour put the toll higher. The incident was not reported at the time due to wartime censorship provisions.

While the American base in Paekākāriki was only in existence for a few years it had an important and lingering impact on the region. Several local place names remain as reminders of this wartime presence. Tarawa Street, for example, commemorates one of the bloodiest battles of the Pacific War which locally based marines fought in directly after the camps were abandoned in October 1943.

<text>The Ōtaki River is in the southwestern North Island of New Zealand, located in the Kāpiti Coast District

==Geography==

It originates in the Tararua Range and flows for , heading southwest through a valley in the Tararua Ranges. It turns northwest in the area of Ōtaki Forks, where it is joined by the Waiotauru River. After continuing through Otaki Gorge towards Kāpiti Coast, it crosses State Highway 1 (SH1) south of Ōtaki and reaches the Tasman Sea south of the settlement of Ōtaki Beach. Around 80% of the catchment area of the river is within the Tararua Forest Park.

The Ōtaki River is one of the major rivers that formed the fertile floodplains of the Kāpiti Coast. The Ōtaki Forks area, accessible via Otaki Gorge Road, is a popular recreational area and the start of several tramping tracks into the Tararua Range.

==Uses==

The Ōtaki River also offers fishing of brown trout and whitebait.

It was reported in 1863 that the river contains &quot;what appears to be vein stones of carbonate, of lime in soft slate, are found in grade quantities.&quot;

In 1881, the Assam Railway and Trading Company opened a metre gauge line long from Dibrugarh to Makum. This company later started the first passenger train in Assam by the name of Dibru–Sadiya Railway.
The North Eastern Railway was formed on 14 April 1952 by amalgamating two railway systems: the Assam Railway and Oudh and Tirhut Railway. Later, it was bifurcated into two railway zones on 15 January 1958, the North Eastern Railway and the Northeast Frontier Railway. to better serve the needs of the northeastern states.

==Operational area==



The area of Northeast Frontier Railway operations is characterized by exceptional beauty and at the same time by some of the most arduous terrain. This difficult terrain limits the rail network expansion, and the only state with a decent rail network is Assam. The network is not broad gauge in many parts and the rail lines are antiquated with speeds at some sections being limited to a maximum of . Before the Saraighat Bridge was constructed, passengers had to get down on the Amingaon side of the Brahmaputra and take a ferry across to Pandu Junction from where they could resume their journey.
The majority of the tracks have been converted to BG and electrification is in process starting from Katihar till Guwahati.

===Major sections===
A few of the major sections under the Northeast Frontier Railway zone are:
*Eklakhi–Balurghat branch line
*New Bongaigaon–Guwahati section
*New Jalpaiguri–New Bongaigaon section
*Rangiya–Murkongselek section
*Guwahati–Lumding section
*Lumding–Dibrugarh section
*Silchar–Sabroom section
*Katihar–Siliguri section
*Katihar–Jogbani branch line
*Alipurduar–Bamanhat branch line
*New Jalpaiguri–Alipurduar–Samuktala Road line
*Barauni–Guwahati line

==Darjeeling Himalayan Railway==
The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway is maintained and governed under the responsibility of Katihar division. It ascends from New Jalpaiguri; the climb begins at Sukna, continues uninterruptedly to Ghum () and descends the final to Darjeeling. After independence, India&#x27;s partition resulted in the isolation of the Northeast region. Consequently, the DHR was merged into Assam Railways, it was closed for the construction of the Assam–Bengal link line and one of its extension lines to Kishanganj was converted to metre gauge. DHR&#x27;s other extension line to Kalimpong was washed away due to floods. On reopening, the DHR was merged with North Eastern Railway in 1952 and later into Northeast Frontier Railway in 1958.

The DHR achieved worldwide fame for many reasons such as:

* A gateway to the Himalayas
* The tiny four-wheeled steam locomotives of the 19th century
* The curves, loops, &quot;Z&quot;s and steep grades crisscrossing the road

An interest in DHR all along has ensured that it continues to operate notwithstanding very heavy losses. The steam locomotive is an icon of this Railway. Tindharia workshop has kept 13 locomotives surviving, some of which are over 100 years old and the youngest is about 70 years old.

Timeline of DHR:

* 20 January 1948: Purchased by the Government of India
* 26 January 1948: Transferred to Assam Rail Link
* 26 January 1950: Transferred to Assam Railway
* 14 January 1952: Transferred to North Eastern Railway
* 15 January 1958: Transferred to Northeast Frontier Railway

<text>In the United Kingdom, as in other countries, feminism seeks to establish political, social, and economic equality for women. The history of feminism in Britain dates to the very beginnings of feminism itself, as many of the earliest feminist writers and activists—such as Mary Wollstonecraft, Barbara Bodichon, and Lydia Becker—were British.

==19th century==
The first organised movement for British women&#x27;s suffrage was the Langham Place Circle of the 1850s, led by Barbara Bodichon (&quot;née&quot; Leigh-Smith) and Bessie Rayner Parkes. They also campaigned for improved female rights in the law, employment, education, and marriage.

Property owning women and widows had been allowed to vote in some local elections, but that ended in 1835. The Chartist Movement of 1838 to 1857 was a large-scale demand for suffrage—however it only gave suffrage to men over 21. In 1851 the Sheffield Female Political Association was founded and submitted an unsuccessful petition calling for women&#x27;s suffrage to the House of Lords. This probably inspired British feminist Harriet Taylor Mill to write the pro-women&#x27;s-suffrage &quot;The Enfranchisement of Women&quot; (1851). On 7 June 1866 a petition from 1,499 women calling for women&#x27;s suffrage was presented to the Parliament, but it also did not succeed.

Upper-class women could exert a little backstage political influence in high society. However, in divorce cases, rich women lost control of their children.

===Careers===

Ambitious middle-class women faced enormous challenges when they proposed entering suitable careers, such as nursing, teaching, law, and medicine, and the loftier their ambition, the greater the challenge. Physicians barred admission to the medical profession; there were a few opportunities for women lawyers, but none as clerics. White collar business opportunities outside family-owned shops were few until clerical positions opened in the 20th century. Florence Nightingale demonstrated the necessity of professional nursing and warfare, and set up an educational system that tracked women into that field in the second half of the nineteenth century. Teaching was not quite as easy to break into, but the low salaries were less of the barrier to the single woman than to the married man. By the late 1860s a number of schools were preparing women for careers as governesses or teachers. The census reported in 1851 that 70,000 women in England and Wales were teachers, compared to the 170,000 who comprised three-fourths of all teachers in 1901. The great majority came from lower middle class origins. The National Union of Women Teachers (NUWT) originated in the early 20th century inside the male-controlled National Union of Teachers (NUT). It demanded equal pay with male teachers, and eventually broke away. Both Oxford and Cambridge minimized the role of women, allowing small all-female colleges to operate. However the new redbrick universities and the other major cities were open to women.

Medicine was the greatest challenge, with the most systematic resistance by the physicians, and the fewest women breaking through. One route to entry was to go to the United States where there were suitable schools for women as early as 1850. Britain was one of the last countries to train women physicians, so 80 to 90% of the British women departed to America for their medical degrees. Edinburgh University admitted a few women in 1869, then reversed itself in 1873, leaving a strong negative reaction among British medical educators. The first separate school for women physicians opened in London in 1874 to a handful of students. Scotland was more open. Coeducation had to wait until the World War.

By the end of the nineteenth century, women had secured equality of status in most spheres – except for the vote and the holding of office.

===Child custody ===

Under traditional common law, children were considered to belong to their father, who had full legal rights over them, both during and after the dissolution of a marriage. Before 1839, after a divorce, women lost control of their children, as those children would continue to live in the family unit with the father, who, as head of the household, continued to be responsible for them. Caroline Norton was one such woman; her personal tragedy where she was denied access to her three sons after a divorce led her to a life of intense campaigning which successfully led to the passing of the Custody of Infants Act 1839 and paved the way for the tender years doctrine for child custody arrangement. The Act gave women, for the first time, a right to their children and gave some discretion to the judge in child custody cases. The Custody of Infants Act 1839 permitted a mother to petition the courts for custody of her children up to the age of seven, and for access in respect of older children, maintaining the responsibility for financial support to the father.
The Custody of Infants Act 1873, passed by the Parliament due to additional pressure from women, extended the maternal right to petition for custody to children under sixteen. The doctrine spread in many states of the world because of the British Empire.

In divorce cases in the 19th century, a woman found guilty of adultery lost not only custody but also access (visitation) to her children. This is exemplified by a ruling by Sir C. Cresswell in 1862, stating that: &quot;&quot;It will probably have a salutary effect on the interests of public morality, that it should be known that a woman, if found guilty of adultery, will forfeit, as far as this Court is concerned, all right to the custody of or access to her children&quot;.&quot; 

In 1886, the Parliament adopted the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1886, which made it easier for mothers to become guardians of the children after their father&#x27;s death. 

A slightly less punitive approach towards adulterous mothers was made possible by &quot;Mozley Stark v Mozley Stark and Hitchins&quot; (1910, Court of Appeal).

Before 1923, male and female adultery were legally treated differently (see section below).

Custody rights were relevant not only with regard to divorce, but also with regard to the legal rights of parents who were married (regarding decisions about children, which included the right of a father to separate a child from the mother, for example by the father sending the child to live abroad). Originally, the father alone had such rights, as the common law gave only the father the right to make decisions about the upbringing of a legitimate child. Mothers&#x27; rights gradually improved, especially with the passage of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1925, but it was only in 1973 that full equality was obtained.

===Divorce===

In Britain, before 1857, the dissolution of a marriage was nearly impossible, being &quot;de facto&quot; restricted to the very wealthy, as it demanded either a complex annulment process or a private bill leading to an act of Parliament, with great costs for either. The latter entailed sometimes lengthy debates about a couple&#x27;s intimate marital relationship in public in the House of Commons. Obtaining a divorce was very difficult, and there were only 314 divorces between 1700 and 1857, corresponding to a rate of two divorces a year. 
Traditionally, poor people used desertion, and (for poor men) even the practice of selling wives in the market, as a substitute for divorce. 

The first key legislative change came with the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857. It passed over the strenuous opposition of the highly traditional Church of England. The new law made divorce a civil affair of the courts, rather than a Church matter, with a new civil court in London handling all cases. The process was still quite expensive, at about £40, but now became feasible for the middle class. A woman who obtained a judicial separation took the status of a &quot;feme sole,&quot; with full control of her own civil rights. Additional amendments came in 1878, which allowed for separations handled by local justices of the peace. The Church of England blocked further reforms until the final breakthrough came with the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.

Before the Matrimonial Causes Act 1923, a man could divorce on the ground of a wife&#x27;s adultery, but a woman could only divorce by proving a husband&#x27;s adultery aggravated by other misconduct (eg. adultery &quot;and&quot; cruelty).

The Matrimonial Causes Act 1937 broadened the grounds for divorce, adding additional reasons for which a divorce could be granted.

The Divorce Reform Act 1969 was the first divorce law to allow no fault divorce (on the ground of having lived separate and apart).

===Limitations to women&#x27;s rights in family law===
The 19th century was a period of major legal changes in family law, which improved women&#x27;s legal status, but there were also numerous limitations, in law and in practice, which prevented women from obtaining these rights. The Custody of Infants Act 1839 was the first law to give mothers legal rights to their children, eroding the absolute rights of the father, but it made little difference in practice given that the act explicitly banned adulterous women from applying for custody or access, at a time when most divorces were granted on the grounds of women&#x27;s adultery (before the Matrimonial Causes Act 1937 the only ground for divorce was adultery, although judicial separation could be granted on other grounds too). Women in the 19th century were rarely successful in obtaining a divorce initiated by them, especially before 1857, when divorce required an act of Parliament; only four Acts of Parliament for divorces were granted on the application of women during that period of the 19th century. Before the Matrimonial Causes Act 1923, male and female adultery were treated differently, with men being able to divorce solely on the ground of adultery, but women having to prove adultery aggravated by additional misconduct. This led to situations where in cases of a woman&#x27;s adultery, the custody of the child would be given to the father regardless of the father&#x27;s conduct. Although the Custody of Infants Act 1873 no longer made any reference to a mother&#x27;s adultery, theoretically allowing mothers divorced due to adultery to obtain rights to the children, the traditional view that such mothers should be completely removed from their children&#x27;s life and denied any access to the child continued to be applied by the courts until the early 20th century. The emphasis on women&#x27;s morality in Victorian England often put women in vulnerable situations, where they could lose rights to their children if it was deemed that their behavior was inappropriate. For example Annie Wood Besant lost custody of her daughter because of her allegedly immoral social activism.

Women had very little protection from domestic violence, as traditional common law had given husbands a right to chastisement. Traditional homicide laws which were in force before the Offences against the Person Act 1828 differentiated between homicide committed by a husband against his wife (which was classed as murder) and homicide committed by a woman against her husband (which was classed as petty treason and was a crime more severe than murder, because it was seen as threatening the hierarchical social order, and for women it incurred burning at stake).

Women who were victims of their husband&#x27;s violence were finally given protection under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1878, which allowed them to obtain a judicial separation (not divorce) and to obtain custody of their children. 

The preoccupation with women&#x27;s morality and sexuality meant that women perceived to violate social norms risked being sent to lunatic asylums. The men who were in charge of these women, either a husband, father or brother, could easily send these women to mental institutions, stating that they believed that these women were mentally ill because of their nonconformist behaviors. Based on her study of cases from the Homewood Retreat, Cheryl Krasnick Warsh concludes that &quot;the realities of the household in late Victorian and Edwardian middle class society rendered certain elements—socially redundant women in particular—more susceptible to institutionalization than others.&quot;

===Prostitution===

Bullough argues that prostitution in 18th-century Britain was a convenience to men of all social statuses, and economic necessity for many poor women, and was tolerated by society. The evangelical movement of the nineteenth century denounced the prostitutes and their clients as sinners, and denounced society for tolerating it. Prostitution, according to the values of the Victorian middle-class, was a horrible evil, for the young women, for the men, and for all of society. Parliament in the 1860s in the Contagious Diseases Acts (&quot;CD&quot;) adopted the French system of licensed prostitution. The &quot;regulationist policy&quot; was to isolate, segregate, and control prostitution. The main goal was to protect working men, soldiers and sailors near ports and army bases from catching venereal disease. Young women officially became prostitutes and were trapped for life in the system. After a nationwide crusade led by Josephine Butler and the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts, Parliament repealed the acts in 1886 and ended legalised prostitution. The age of consent for young women was raised from 12 to 16, undercutting the supply of young prostitutes who were in highest demand. The new moral code meant that respectable men dared not be caught.

===Protection for rich and poor women===

A series of four laws each called the Married Women&#x27;s Property Act passed Parliament from 1870 to 1893 effectively removed the restrictions that kept wealthy married women from controlling their own property. They now had practically equal status with their husbands, and a status superior to women anywhere else in Europe. Working class women were protected by a series of laws passed on the assumption that they (like children) did not have full bargaining power and needed protection by the government. The Act did receive a great deal of criticism as many believed that &quot;household harmony could only be achieved by the total subordination of women to their husband&quot;.

==1900–1950==

The early 20th century, the Edwardian era, saw a loosening of Victorian rigidity and complacency: women had more employment opportunities and were more active. Many served worldwide in the British Empire or in Protestant missionary societies.

The Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU) was formed in 1903 by Emmeline Pankhurst to fight for women&#x27;s rights to vote. Women had the vote in Australia, New Zealand and some of the American states. While WSPU was the most visible suffrage group, it was only one of many, such as the Women&#x27;s Freedom League and the National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) led by Millicent Garrett Fawcett.

In 1906, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; first coined the term &quot;suffragettes&quot; as a form of ridicule, but the term was quickly embraced in Britain by women who used militant tactics in the cause of women&#x27;s suffrage. The term became visible in distinctive green, purple, and white emblems, and the Artists&#x27; Suffrage League&#x27;s dramatic graphics. Feminists learned to exploit photography and the media, and left a vivid visual record including images such as the 1914 photograph of Emmeline. Violence separated the moderates from the radicals led by the Pankhursts. The radicals themselves split; Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst expelled Sylvia Pankhurst for insubordination and she formed her own group that was left-wing and oriented to broader issues affecting working class women. It was first called the East London Federation of Suffragettes (ELFS), but over the years evolved politically and changed its name accordingly, first to the Women&#x27;s Suffrage Federation and then to the Workers&#x27; Socialist Federation.

The radical protests slowly became more violent, and included heckling, banging on doors, smashing shop windows, and arson. Emily Davison, a WSPU member, unexpectedly ran onto the track during the 1913 Epsom Derby and died under the King&#x27;s horse. These tactics produced mixed results of sympathy and alienation. As many protesters were imprisoned and went on hunger-strike, the Liberal government was left with an embarrassing situation. From these political actions, the suffragists successfully created publicity around their institutional discrimination and sexism. Historians generally argue that the first stage of the militant suffragette movement under the Pankhursts in 1906 had a dramatic mobilizing effect on the suffrage movement. Women were thrilled and supportive of revolting in the streets; the membership of the militant WSPU and the older NUWSS overlapped and was mutually supportive. However a system of publicity, Ensor argues, had to continue to escalate to maintain its high visibility in the media. The hunger strikes and force-feeding did that. However the Pankhursts refused any advice and escalated their tactics. They turned to systematic disruption of Liberal Party meetings as well as physical violence in terms of damaging public buildings and arson. This went too far, as the overwhelming majority of suffragists pulled back and refused to follow because they could no longer defend the tactics. They increasingly repudiated the suffragettes as an obstacle to achieving suffrage, saying the militant suffragettes were now aiding the antis, and many historians agree. Searle says the methods of the suffragettes did succeed in damaging the Liberal party but failed to advance the cause of woman suffrage. When the Pankhursts decided to stop the militancy at the start of the war, and enthusiastically support the war effort, the movement split and their leadership role ended. Suffrage did come four years later, but the feminist movement in Britain permanently abandoned the militant tactics that had made the suffragettes famous.

The First World War advanced the feminist cause, as women&#x27;s sacrifices and paid employment were much appreciated. Prime Minister David Lloyd George was clear about how important the women were: 

The militant suffragette movement was suspended during the war and never resumed. British society credited the new patriotic roles women played as earning them the vote in 1918. However, British historians no longer emphasize the granting of woman suffrage as a reward for women&#x27;s participation in war work. Pugh (1974) argues that enfranchising soldiers primarily and women secondarily was decided by senior politicians in 1916. In the absence of major women&#x27;s groups demanding for equal suffrage, the government&#x27;s conference recommended limited, age-restricted women&#x27;s suffrage. The suffragettes had been weakened, Pugh argues, by repeated failures before 1914 and by the disorganising effects of war mobilization; therefore they quietly accepted these restrictions, which were approved in 1918 by a majority of the War Ministry and each political party in Parliament. More generally, Searle (2004) argues that the British debate was essentially over by the 1890s, and that granting the suffrage in 1918 was mostly a byproduct of giving the vote to male soldiers. Women in Britain finally achieved suffrage on the same terms as men in 1928.

The Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 received Royal Assent on 23 December 1919. The basic purpose of the act was, as stated in its long title, &quot;... to amend the Law with respect to disqualification on account of sex&quot;, which it achieved in four short sections and one schedule. Its broad aim was achieved by section 1, which stated that: The Crown was given the power to regulate the admission of women to the civil service by Orders in Council, and judges were permitted to control the gender composition of juries. By section 2, women were to be admitted as solicitors after serving three years only if they possessed a University degree which would have qualified them if male, or if they had fulfilled all the requirements of a degree at a University which did not, at the time, admit women to degrees. By section 3, no statute or charter of a University was to preclude University authorities from regulating the admission of women to membership or degrees. By section 4, any orders in council, royal charters, or statutory provisions which were inconsistent with this Act were to cease to have effect.

At the same time there was a relaxing of clothing restrictions on women; however, by 1920 there was negative talk about young women called &quot;flappers&quot; flaunting their sexuality.

The BBC had a marriage bar between 1932 and 1944, although it was a partial ban and was not fully enforced due to the BBC&#x27;s ambivalent views on the policy.

The marriage bar was abolished in 1946 for the Home Civil Service; until then women were required to resign when they married.

Lloyds Bank had a marriage bar that also meant that female employees were classified as supplementary staff, rather than permanent. The bank abolished its marriage bar in 1949.

=== Electoral reform ===

The United Kingdom&#x27;s Representation of the People Act 1918 gave near-universal suffrage to men, and suffrage to women over 30. The Representation of the People Act 1928 extended equal suffrage to both men and women. It also shifted the socioeconomic makeup of the electorate towards the working class, favouring the Labour Party, which was more sympathetic to women&#x27;s issues. The 1918 election gave Labour the most seats in the house to date. The electoral reforms also allowed women to run for Parliament. Specifically, the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918 gave women over 21 the right to stand for election as an MP. Christabel Pankhurst narrowly failed to win a seat in 1918, but in 1919 and 1920, both Lady Astor and Margaret Wintringham won seats for the Conservatives and Liberals respectively by succeeding their husband&#x27;s seats. Labour swept to power in 1924. Constance Markievicz (Sinn Féin) was the first woman elected in Ireland in 1918, but as an Irish nationalist, refused to take her seat. Astor&#x27;s proposal to form a women&#x27;s party in 1929 was unsuccessful. Women gained considerable electoral experience over the next few years as a series of minority governments ensured almost annual elections, but there were 12 women in Parliament by 1940. Close affiliation with Labour also proved to be a problem for the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship (NUSEC), which had little support in the Conservative party. However, their persistence with Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin was rewarded with the passage of the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928.

=== Social reform ===

The political change did not immediately change social circumstances. With the economic recession, women were the most vulnerable sector of the workforce. Some women who held jobs prior to the war were obliged to forfeit them to returning soldiers, and others were excessed. With limited franchise, the UK National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) pivoted into a new organisation, the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship (NUSEC), which still advocated for equality in franchise, but extended its scope to examine equality in social and economic areas. Legislative reform was sought for discriminatory laws (e.g., family law and prostitution) and over the differences between &quot;equality&quot; and &quot;equity&quot;, the accommodations that would allow women to overcome barriers to fulfillment (known in later years as the &quot;equality vs. difference conundrum&quot;). Eleanor Rathbone, who became an MP in 1929, succeeded Millicent Garrett as president of NUSEC in 1919. She expressed the critical need for consideration of &quot;difference&quot; in gender relationships as &quot;what women need to fulfill the potentialities of their own natures&quot;. The 1924 Labour government&#x27;s social reforms created a formal split, as a splinter group of strict egalitarians formed the Open Door Council in May 1926. This eventually became an international movement, and continued until 1965. Other important social legislation of this period included the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 (which opened professions to women), and the Matrimonial Causes Act 1923. In 1932, NUSEC separated advocacy from education, and continued the former activities as the National Council for Equal Citizenship and the latter as the Townswomen&#x27;s Guild. The council continued until the end of the Second World War.

In 1921, Margaret Mackworth (Lady Rhondda) founded the Six Point Group, which included Rebecca West. As a political lobby group it aimed at political, occupational, moral, social, economic and legal equality. Thus it was ideologically allied with the Open Door Council, rather than National Council. It also lobbied at an international level, such as the League of Nations, and continued its work till 1983. In retrospect both ideological groups were influential in advancing women&#x27;s rights in their own way. Despite women being admitted to the House of Commons from 1918, Mackworth, a Viscountess in her own right, spent a lifetime fighting to take her seat in the House of Lords against bitter opposition, a battle which only achieved its goal in the year of her death (1958). This revealed the weaknesses of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act. Mackworth also founded &quot;Time and Tide&quot; which became the group&#x27;s journal, and to which West, Virginia Woolf, Rose Macaulay and many others contributed. A number of other women&#x27;s periodicals also appeared in the 1920s, including &quot;Woman and Home&quot;, and &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;, but whose content reflect very different aspirations. In 1925 Rebecca West wrote in &quot;Time and Tide&quot; something that reflected not only the movement&#x27;s need to redefine itself post suffrage, but a continual need for re-examination of goals. &quot;When those of our army whose voices are inclined to coolly tell us that the day of sex-antagonism is over and henceforth we have only to advance hand in hand with the male, I do not believe it.&quot;

=== Reproductive rights ===
In 1803 the United Kingdom enacted Lord Ellenborough&#x27;s Act, making abortion after quickening a capital crime, and providing lesser penalties for the felony of abortion before quickening.

Annie Besant was tried in 1877 for publishing Charles Knowlton&#x27;s &quot;Fruits of Philosophy&quot;, a work on family planning, under the Obscene Publications Act 1857. Knowlton had previously been convicted in the United States. She and her colleague Charles Bradlaugh were convicted but acquitted on appeal, the subsequent publicity resulting in a decline in the birth rate. Not discouraged in the slightest, Besant followed this with &quot;The Law of Population&quot;.

In 1929 the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929 was enacted; it created the offence of child destruction. It also amended the law so that an abortion carried out in good faith, for the sole purpose of preserving the life of the mother, would not be an offence.

In 1938 Dr. Aleck Bourne aborted the pregnancy of a young girl who had been raped by soldiers. Bourne was acquitted after turning himself in to authorities.

==1950s – 21st century==
1950s Britain is regarded as a bleak period for feminism. In the aftermath of World War II, a new emphasis was placed on companionate marriage and the nuclear family as a foundation of the new welfare state.

In 1951, the proportion of adult women who were (or had been) married was 75%; more specifically, 84.8% of women between the ages of 45 and 49 were married. At that time: “marriage was more popular than ever before.” In 1953, a popular book of advice for women states: “A happy marriage may be seen, not as a holy state or something to which a few may luckily attain, but rather as the best course, the simplest, and the easiest way of life for us all”.

While at the end of the war, childcare facilities were closed and assistance for working women became limited, the social reforms implemented by the new welfare state included family allowances meant to subsidize families, that is, to support women in the “capacity as wife and mother.” Sue Bruley argues that “the progressive vision of the New Britain of 1945 was flawed by a fundamentally conservative view of women”.

Women&#x27;s commitment to companionate marriage was encouraged by the popular media: films, radio and popular women&#x27;s magazines. In the 1950s, women&#x27;s magazines had considerable influence on forming opinion in all walks of life, including the attitude to women&#x27;s employment.

Nevertheless, 1950s Britain saw several strides towards the parity of women, such as equal pay required by law for women teachers (1952) and for women in the civil service (1954), thanks to activists like Edith Summerskill, who fought for women&#x27;s causes both in parliament and in the traditional non-party pressure groups throughout the 1950s. Barbara Caine argues: “Ironically here, as with the vote, success was sometimes the worst enemy of organised feminism, as the achievement of each goal brought to an end the campaign which had been organised around it, leaving nothing in its place.”

The act allowed for the creation of female peers entitled to sit in the House of Lords. The first such women peers were four— Barbara Wootton and Stella Isaacs, who were sworn in on 21 October 1958, and Katharine Eliot and Irene Curzon, who took office the next day.

Feminist writers of that period, such as Alva Myrdal and Viola Klein, started to allow for the possibility that women should be able to combine home with outside employment. 1950s’ form of feminism is often derogatorily termed “welfare feminism.” Indeed, many activists went to great length to stress that their position was that of ‘reasonable modern feminism,’ which accepted sexual diversity, and sought to establish what women&#x27;s social contribution was rather than emphasizing equality or the similarity of the sexes. Feminism in 1950s England was strongly connected to social responsibility and involved the well-being of society as a whole. This often came at the cost of the liberation and personal fulfillment of self-declared feminists. Even those women who regarded themselves as feminists strongly endorsed prevailing ideas about the primacy of children&#x27;s needs, as advocated, for example, by John Bowlby the head of the Children&#x27;s Department at the Tavistock Clinic, who published extensively throughout the 1950s and by Donald Winnicott who promoted through radio broadcasts and in the press the idea of the home as a private emotional world in which mother and child are bound to each other and in which the mother has control and finds freedom to fulfill herself.

===A series of legislation and organising around women&#x27;s rights:===

The birth control pill was introduced in the UK on the National Health Service in 1961 for married women only, and made available for all women with the NHS from 1967.

The Peerage Act 1963 granted &quot;suo jure&quot; hereditary women peers (other than those in the Peerage of Ireland) the right to sit in the House of Lords.

The Abortion Act 1967 is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom legalising abortions by registered practitioners, and regulating the tax-paid provision of such medical practices through the National Health Service. The Act made abortion legal in all of Great Britain (but not Northern Ireland) up to 28 weeks&#x27; gestation. In 1990, the law was amended by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act so that abortion was no longer legal after 24 weeks, except in cases where it was necessary to save the life of the woman, there was evidence of extreme fetal abnormality, or there was a grave risk of physical or mental injury to the woman. Furthermore, all abortion remains officially restricted to cases of maternal life, mental health, health, rape, fetal defects, and/or socioeconomic factors.

The Ford sewing machinists strike of 1968, led by Rose Boland, Eileen Pullen, Vera Sime, Gwen Davis, and Sheila Douglass, began because women sewing machinists, as part of a regrading exercise, were informed that their jobs were graded in Category B (less skilled production jobs), instead of Category C (more skilled production jobs), and that they would be paid 15% less than the full B rate received by men. At the time, it was common practice for companies to pay women less than men, irrespective of the skills involved. Following the intervention of Barbara Castle, the Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity in Harold Wilson&#x27;s government, the strike ended three weeks after it began, as a result of a deal that immediately increased their rate of pay to 8% below that of men, rising to the full category B rate the following year. A court of inquiry (under the Industrial Courts Act 1919) was also set up to consider their regrading, although this failed to find in their favour. The women were only regraded into Category C following a further six-week strike in 1984. The 1968 strike was a trigger cause of the passing of the Equal Pay Act 1970. As well, inspired by the 1968 strike, women trades unionists founded the National Joint Action Campaign Committee for Women&#x27;s Equal Rights (NJACCWER), which held an equal pay demonstration attended by 1,000 people in Trafalgar Square on 18 May 1969.

The Equal Pay Act 1970 is an act of the United Kingdom Parliament from 1970 which prohibits any less favourable treatment between women and men in terms of pay and conditions of employment. The act has now been mostly superseded by part 5, chapter 3, of the Equality Act 2010.

Refuge was founded in 1971 in Chiswick, West London, as the modern world&#x27;s first safe house for women and children escaping domestic violence.

The socialist feminist Brixton Black Women&#x27;s Group was formed in 1973 to raise consciousness and organise around issues specifically affecting Black women. Several of the group&#x27;s founding members, such as Beverley Bryan, Olive Morris and Liz Obi, had previously been active in the British Black Panthers and BWG was formed partly from frustrations that the Panthers were not taking women&#x27;s issues seriously.

The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (c. 65) was an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which protected people from discrimination on the grounds of sex or marital status. The Act concerned employment, training, education, harassment, the provision of goods and services, and the disposal of premises. The Gender Recognition Act 2004 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (Amendment) Regulations 2008 amended parts of this act to apply to transsexual people. Other amendments were introduced by the Sex Discrimination Act 1986, the Employment Act 1989, the Equality Act 2006, and other legislation such as rulings by the European Court of Justice. The act did not apply in Northern Ireland, however the Sex Discrimination Gender Reassignment Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1999 does. The act was repealed in full by the Equality Act 2010.

The Grunwick dispute at the Grunwick Film Processing Laboratories in London, was an industrial dispute involving trade union recognition that led to a two-year strike between 1976 and 1978. It was led by Mrs Jayaben Desai, and involved mostly female, immigrant, East African Asian strikers. It was the first dispute where the majority of strikers were from an ethnic minority and still received widespread support from the labour movement.

The United Kingdom signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 1981 and ratified it in 1986.

Female genital mutilation was outlawed in the UK by the Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985, which made it an offence to perform FGM on children or adults.

When Margaret Thatcher (who had been the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990) died the then Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband paid tribute to her as &quot;the first woman Prime Minister&quot;. However Thatcher received scant credit from feminists for breaking the ultimate glass ceiling, because she herself avoided feminism, and expressed an intensely masculine style.

 is a court judgment delivered in 1991, in which the House of Lords determined that under English criminal law it is possible for a husband to rape his wife.

== Education ==
In a 2015 evaluation from Lord David Willetts stated that in 2013, the percentage of undergraduate students in the UK were 54 percent female and 46 percent male. Whereas in the 1960s only 25 percent of full-time students in the United Kingdom were female. The increase of women going to university and contributing in the educational system can be linked to the women’s suffrage movements that aimed to encourage women to enroll in higher education.

==21st century==
The Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002 (c.2) is an act of Parliament of the United Kingdom. The purpose of the act was to exempt the selection of candidates in parliamentary elections from the provisions in the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and the Sex Discrimination (Northern Ireland) Order 1976 that outlaw sexual discrimination. The purposes of the act allow political parties to select candidates based on gender in an effort to increase representation of women in British politics.

The act applies to elections to:
* the House of Commons;
* the Scottish Parliament;
* the National Assembly for Wales;
* the Northern Ireland Assembly;
* Local Government Elections (including the London Assembly); and
* the European Parliament.

The act does not apply to selection of candidates for the Mayor of London elections. Only political parties registered under part 2 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 are covered by the act.

The act was originally scheduled to run until the end of 2015. On 6 March 2008, Minister for Women Harriet Harman announced that the exemption would be extended until 2030 under the Equality Act 2010.

The Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 and the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation (Scotland) Act 2005 made it an offence to arrange FGM outside the country for British citizens or permanent residents, whether or not it is lawful in the country to which the girl is taken. The first prosecutions took place in 2015 against a doctor for performing FGM and another man for aiding and abetting; both were found not guilty.

The Equality Act 2006 (c. 3) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, a precursor to the Equality Act 2010, which combines all of the equality enactments within Great Britain and provides comparable protections across all equality strands. Those explicitly mentioned by the Equality Act 2006 include gender; disability; age; proposed, commenced or completed gender reassignment; race; religion or belief and sexual orientation. Among other things, it created a public duty to promote equality on the ground of gender (The Equality Act 2006, section 84, inserting section 76A of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, now found in section 1 of the Equality Act 2010.)

From 2007 until 2015, Harriet Harman was the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party. Traditionally, being Deputy Leader has ensured the cabinet role of Deputy Prime Minister. However, Gordon Brown announced that he would not have a deputy prime minister, much to the consternation of feminists, particularly with suggestions that privately Brown considered Jack Straw to be de facto deputy prime minister and thus bypassing Harman. With Harman&#x27;s cabinet post of Leader of the House of Commons, Brown allowed her to chair Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions when he was out of the country. Harman also held the post Minister for Women and Equality.

The Equality Act 2010 is an act of Parliament of the United Kingdom; the primary purpose of the act is to codify the complicated and numerous array of Acts and Regulations, which formed the basis of anti-discrimination law in Great Britain. This was, primarily, the Equal Pay Act 1970, the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, the Race Relations Act 1976, the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and three major statutory instruments protecting against discrimination in employment on grounds of religion or belief, sexual orientation and age. It requires equal treatment in access to employment as well as private and public services, regardless of the protected characteristics of sex, age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, race, religion or belief, and sexual orientation. In the case of gender, there are special protections for pregnant women. The act does not guarantee transsexuals&#x27; access to gender-specific services where restrictions are &quot;a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim&quot;. Under s.217, with limited exceptions the act does not apply to Northern Ireland.

In 2013, the first oral history archive of the United Kingdom women&#x27;s liberation movement (titled &quot;Sisterhood and After&quot;) was launched by the British Library.

Sisters Uncut was founded in 2014 to take direct action in response to cuts to domestic violence services by the UK government, which has included demonstrating against cuts at 7 October London premiere of the 2015 film &quot;Suffragette&quot;. Sisters Uncut organises intersectionally and see the struggle against racism and borders as intimately connected to the struggle against violence towards women.

In 2016, a British receptionist was dismissed for not wearing high heels and she then started a petition which attracted sufficient support to be considered by the UK Parliament. Outsourcing firm Portico stated that Nicola Thorp &quot;had signed the appearance guidelines&quot; but after Thorp launched her online petition—&quot;Make it illegal for a company to require women to wear high heels at work&quot;—the firm changed their policy. The new guideline states that all female employees &quot;can wear plain flat shoes or plain court shoes as they prefer.&quot; The petition gained widespread support from public figures such as Scotland&#x27;s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and MPs Caroline Dinenage, Margot James and Tulip Siddiq. Two parliamentary committees in January 2017 decided that Portico had broken the law; the company had already changed its terms of employment. The petition gained over 130,000 signatures, sufficient for a debate in the British parliament. This took place on 6 March 2017, when MPs decided the UK government should change the law to prevent the demand being made by employers. However, this was rejected by the government in April 2017 as they stated that existing legislation was &quot;adequate&quot;.

==Timeline==
===1700s===
* 1792: Mary Wollstonecraft published &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot;.

===1800–1850===
* 1803: The United Kingdom enacted Lord Ellenborough&#x27;s Act, making abortion after quickening a capital crime, and providing lesser penalties for the felony of abortion before quickening.
* 1818: Jeremy Bentham advocated female suffrage in his book &quot;A Plan for Parliamentary Reform&quot;.
* 1832: Great Reform Act – confirmed the exclusion of women from the electorate. 
* 1835: Property owning women and widows had been allowed to vote in some local elections, but that ended in 1835.
* 1839: The Custody of Infants Act 1839 was enacted. The Act gave women, for the first time, a right to their children and gave some discretion to the judge in child custody cases. The Act permitted a mother to petition the courts for custody of her children up to the age of seven, and for access in respect of older children, maintaining the responsibility for financial support to the father.
* 1844: The regulation of working hours in factories was extended to women by the Factories Act 1844. 
* 1847: The Factory Act 1847, also known as the Ten Hours Act, was a United Kingdom act of Parliament which restricted the working hours of women and young persons (13-18) in textile mills to 10 hours per day. The practicalities of running a textile mill were such that the act should have effectively set the same limit on the working hours of adult male mill-workers, but defective drafting meant that the subsequent Factory Act 1850 imposing tighter restrictions on the hours within which women and young persons could work was needed to bring this about.

===1850–1880===
* 1842: The Mines and Collieries Act 1842, commonly known as the Mines Act 1842, was an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which forbade women and girls of any age to work underground and introduced a minimum age of ten for boys employed in underground work. However, the employment of women did not end abruptly in 1842; with the connivance of some employers, women dressed as men continued to work underground for several years. Penalties for employing women were small and inspectors were few and some women were so desperate for work they willingly worked illegally for less pay.
* 1850s: The first organised movement for British women&#x27;s suffrage was the Langham Place Circle of the 1850s, led by Barbara Bodichon (née Leigh-Smith) and Bessie Rayner Parkes. They also campaigned for improved female rights in the law, employment, education, and marriage.
* 1851: The Sheffield Female Political Association was founded and submitted an unsuccessful petition calling for women&#x27;s suffrage to the House of Lords.
* 1851: Harriet Taylor Mill published the pro-women&#x27;s-suffrage &quot;The Enfranchisement of Women&quot;. 
* 1857: The Matrimonial Causes Act 1857 allowed for easier divorce through a Divorce Court based in London. Divorce remained too expensive for the working class. 
* 1864–1886: The Contagious Diseases Acts, also known as the CD Acts, were originally passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1864, with alterations and editions made in 1866 and 1869. In 1862, a committee was established to inquire into venereal disease (i.e. sexually transmitted infections) in the armed forces. On its recommendation the first Contagious Diseases Act was passed. The legislation allowed police officers to arrest women suspected of being prostitutes in certain ports and army towns. The women were then subjected to compulsory checks for venereal disease. If a woman was declared to be infected, she would be confined in what was known as a lock hospital until she recovered or her sentence finished. The original act only applied to a few selected naval ports and army towns, but by 1869 the acts had been extended to cover eighteen &quot;subjected districts&quot;. In 1886, the acts were repealed.
* 1865: John Stuart Mill elected as an MP showing direct support for women&#x27;s suffrage.
* 1866: On 7 June 1866 a petition from 1,499 women asking for women&#x27;s suffrage was presented to Parliament, but it did not succeed.
* 1867: Second Reform Act – Male franchise extended to 2.5 million; no mention of women.
* 1869: In June 1869, Lydia Becker and fellow campaigners were successful in securing the vote for women in municipal elections. 
* 1870: The Married Women&#x27;s Property Act 1870 was enacted; it allowed married women to be the legal owners of the money they earned and to inherit property.
* 1873: The Custody of Infants Act 1873, enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom due to additional pressure from women, extended the maternal right to petition for custody to children under sixteen 
* 1877: Annie Besant was tried in 1877 for publishing Charles Knowlton&#x27;s &quot;Fruits of Philosophy&quot;, a work on family planning, under the Obscene Publications Act 1857. Knowlton had previously been convicted in the United States. She and her colleague Charles Bradlaugh were convicted but acquitted on appeal, the subsequent publicity resulting in a decline in the birth rate. 
* 1878: Magistrates&#x27; courts were given the authority to grant separation and maintenance orders to wives of abusive husbands; much cheaper than divorce.

===1880–1900===
* 1882: The Married Women&#x27;s Property Act 1882 (45 &amp; 46 Vict. c.75) was an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom that significantly altered English law regarding the property rights of married women, which besides other matters allowed married women to own and control property in their own right. The Act applied in England (and Wales) and Ireland (after Irish independence in 1922, only Northern Ireland), but did not extend to Scotland.
* 1883: Conservative Primrose League formed. &quot;The Primrose League was the first political organisation to give women the same status and responsibilities as men&quot; according to Alistair Cooke.
* 1884: Third Reform Act – Male electorate doubled to 5 million.
* 1884: The Married Women&#x27;s Property Act 1884 was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that significantly altered English law regarding the property rights granted to married women, allowing them to own and control their own property, whether acquired before or after marriage, and sue and be sued in their own name.
* 1886: The Contagious Disease Acts were repealed.
* 1886: The Guardianship of Infants Act, 1886 made it easier for mothers to become guardians of the children after their father&#x27;s death. 
* 1889: Women&#x27;s Franchise League established.
* 1893: The Married Women&#x27;s Property Act 1893 was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that significantly altered English law regarding the property rights granted to married women. It completed the Married Women&#x27;s Property Act 1882 by granting married women the same property rights equal to unmarried women.
* 1894: Local Government Act; women who owned property could vote in local elections, become Poor Law Guardians, serve on School Boards
* 1894: The publication of C.C. Stopes&#x27;s &quot;British Freewomen&quot;, staple reading for the suffrage movement for decades.
* 1897: National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies NUWSS formed (led by Millicent Fawcett).

===1900–WW1===
* 1903: Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union WSPU was formed (under tight control of Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters)
* 1904: WPSU Militancy begins. 
* 1905, 1908, 1913: Three phases of WSPU militancy (Civil Disobedience; Destruction of Public Property; Arson/Bombings).
* 1906: The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; first coined the term &quot;suffragettes&quot; as a form of ridicule, but the term was quickly embraced in Britain by women who used militant tactics in the cause of women&#x27;s suffrage.
* February 1907: NUWSS &quot;Mud March&quot; – largest open air demonstration ever held (at that point) – over 3000 women took part. In this year, women were admitted to the register to vote in and stand for election to principal local authorities.
* 1907: The Matrimonial Causes Act 1907 was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that consolidated previous legislation relating to maintenance payments to separated and divorced women. It was designed in response to one cause of poverty amongst mothers and their children, marriage break-up. Support for the &quot;endowment of motherhood&quot; was also increased. 
* 1907: The Artists&#x27; Suffrage League founded.
* 1907: The Women&#x27;s Freedom League founded. 
* 1909: The Women&#x27;s Tax Resistance League founded.
* September 1909: Force feeding introduced to WSPU hunger strikers in English prisons
* February 1910: Cross-Party Conciliation Committee (54 MPs). Conciliation Bill (that would enfranchise women) passed its 2nd reading by a majority of 109 but Prime Minister Asquith refused to give it more parliamentary time
* November 1910: Asquith changes Bill to enfranchise more men instead of women
* October 1912: George Lansbury, Labour MP, resigned his seat in support of women&#x27;s suffrage
* February 1913: David Lloyd George&#x27;s house burned down by WSPU (despite his support for women&#x27;s suffrage). 
* April 1913: Cat and Mouse Act passed, allowing hunger-striking prisoners to be released when their health was threatened and then re-arrested when they had recovered.

Its broad aim was achieved by section 1, which stated that: The Crown was given the power to regulate the admission of women to the civil service by Orders in Council, and judges were permitted to control the gender composition of juries. By section 2, women were to be admitted as solicitors after serving three years only if they possessed a University degree which would have qualified them if male, or if they had fulfilled all the requirements of a degree at a University which did not, at the time, admit women to degrees. By section 3, no statute or charter of a University was to preclude University authorities from regulating the admission of women to membership or degrees. By section 4, any orders in council, royal charters, or statutory provisions which were inconsistent with this Act were to cease to have effect.

The Act made abortion legal in all of Great Britain (but not Northern Ireland) up to 28 weeks&#x27; gestation. In 1990, the law was amended by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act so that abortion was no longer legal after 24 weeks, except in cases where it was necessary to save the life of the woman, there was evidence of extreme fetal abnormality, or there was a grave risk of physical or mental injury to the woman. Furthermore, all abortion remains officially restricted to cases of maternal life, mental health, health, rape, fetal defects, and/or socioeconomic factors.
* 1967: In the common law of crime in England and Wales, a common scold was a type of public nuisance—a troublesome and angry woman who broke the public peace by habitually arguing and quarrelling with her neighbours. The offence was punishable by ducking: being placed in a chair and submerged in a river or pond. Although rarely prosecuted it remained on the statute books in England and Wales until 1967.
* 1968: The Ford sewing machinists strike of 1968, led by Rose Boland, Eileen Pullen, Vera Sime, Gwen Davis, and Sheila Douglass, began because women sewing machinists, as part of a regrading exercise, were informed that their jobs were graded in Category B (less skilled production jobs), instead of Category C (more skilled production jobs), and that they would be paid 15% less than the full B rate received by men. At the time it was common practice for companies to pay women less than men, irrespective of the skills involved. Following the intervention of Barbara Castle, the Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity in Harold Wilson&#x27;s government, the strike ended three weeks after it began, as a result of a deal that immediately increased their rate of pay to 8% below that of men, rising to the full category B rate the following year. A court of inquiry (under the Industrial Courts Act 1919) was also set up to consider their regrading, although this failed to find in their favour. The women were only regraded into Category C following a further six-week strike in 1984 (source BBC documentary broadcast 9 March 2013). The 1968 strike was a trigger cause of the passing of the Equal Pay Act 1970. 
* 1969: Inspired by the Ford sewing machinists strike of 1968, women trades unionists founded the National Joint Action Campaign Committee for Women&#x27;s Equal Rights (NJACCWER), which held an equal pay demonstration attended by 1,000 people in Trafalgar Square on 18 May 1969.

Ten UK conferences took place between 1970 and 1978, with the first taking place in 1970.
* 1970: The Equal Pay Act 1970 is an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament from 1970 which prohibits any less favourable treatment between women and men in terms of pay and conditions of employment. The Act has now been mostly superseded by Part 5, chapter 3, of the Equality Act 2010.

The Gender Recognition Act 2004 and The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (Amendment) Regulations 2008 amended parts of this Act to apply to transgender people. Other amendments were introduced by the Sex Discrimination Act 1986, the Employment Act 1989, the Equality Act 2006, and other legislation such as rulings by the European Court of Justice.

===2001–2010===
* 2002: The Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002 (c.2) is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom. The purpose of the Act was to exempt the selection of candidates in parliamentary elections from the provisions in the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and the Sex Discrimination (Northern Ireland) Order 1976 that outlaw sexual discrimination. The purposes of the Act allow political parties to select candidates based on gender in an effort to increase representation of women in British politics.

The Act applies to elections to:
* the House of Commons;
* the Scottish Parliament;
* the National Assembly for Wales;
* the Northern Ireland Assembly;
* Local Government Elections (including the London Assembly); and
* the European Parliament.

The Act does not apply to selection of candidates for the Mayor of London elections. Only political parties registered under Part 2 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 are covered by the Act.

* 2006: The Equality Act 2006 (c 3) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, a precursor to the Equality Act 2010, which combines all of the equality enactments within Great Britain and provides comparable protections across all equality strands. Those explicitly mentioned by the Equality Act 2006 include gender; disability; age; proposed, commenced or completed gender reassignment; race; religion or belief and sexual orientation. Among other things, it created a public duty to promote equality on the ground of gender (The Equality Act 2006, section 84, inserting section 76A of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, now found in section 1 of the Equality Act 2010.)
* 2007: The Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007 (applicable in England and Wales, and in Northern Ireland) was passed, which enables the victims of forced marriage to apply for court orders for their protection. 
* 2010: The Equality Act 2010 is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom; the primary purpose of the Act is to codify the complicated and numerous array of Acts and Regulations, which formed the basis of anti-discrimination law in Great Britain.

It requires equal treatment in access to employment as well as private and public services, regardless of the protected characteristics of sex, age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, race, religion or belief, and sexual orientation. In the case of gender, there are special protections for pregnant women. The Act does not guarantee transgender people&#x27;s access to gender-specific services where restrictions are &quot;a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim&quot;. Under s.217, with limited exceptions the Act does not apply to Northern Ireland.

===2011–2020===

* 2012–2015: No More Page 3 was a campaign to stop &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper from including pictures of topless glamour models on its Page 3; it ended when the topless feature was discontinued. The campaign was started by Lucy-Anne Holmes in August 2012; it reached 215,000 signatures by January 2015. The campaign gained widespread support from MPs and organisations but was criticised by Alison Webster, the photographer for Page 3. In January 2015, it was reported that &quot;The Sun&quot; had ended Page 3, but the feature was revived for one issue published on 22 January. Following that, Page 3 has not been featured in &quot;The Sun&quot; again.
* 2013: The Succession to the Crown Act 2013 (c. 20) is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom which altered the laws of succession to the British throne in accordance with the 2011 Perth Agreement.

It was brought into force on 26 March 2015, at the same time as the other Commonwealth realms implemented the Perth Agreement in their own laws.
* 2013: The first oral history archive of the United Kingdom women&#x27;s liberation movement (titled &quot;Sisterhood and After&quot;) was launched by the British Library.
* 2014: Sisters Uncut was founded in 2014 to take direct action in response to cuts to domestic violence services by the UK government, which has included demonstrating against cuts at 7 October London premiere of the 2015 film &quot;Suffragette&quot;.

It stipulates that whenever a vacancy arose among the Lords Spiritual during the next ten years after the Act came into force, the position had to be filled by a woman, if there was one who was eligible. It did not apply to the five sees of Canterbury, York, London, Durham or Winchester, which are always represented in the House of Lords. The Act was passed shortly after the Bishops and Priests (Consecration and Ordination of Women) Measure 2014 authorised the Church of England to appoint women as bishops.
* 2016–2017: In 2016, a British receptionist was dismissed for not wearing high heels and she then started a petition which attracted sufficient support to be considered by the UK Parliament. Outsourcing firm Portico stated that Nicola Thorp &quot;had signed the appearance guidelines&quot; but after Thorp launched her online petition—&quot;Make it illegal for a company to require women to wear high heels at work&quot;—the firm changed their policy. The new guideline states that all female employees &quot;can wear plain flat shoes or plain court shoes as they prefer.&quot; The petition gained widespread support from public figures such as Scotland&#x27;s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and MPs Caroline Dinenage, Margot James and Tulip Siddiq. Two parliamentary committees in January 2017 decided that Portico had broken the law; the company had already changed its terms of employment. The petition gained over 130,000 signatures, sufficient for a debate in the British parliament. This took place on 6 March 2017, when MPs decided the UK government should change the law to prevent the demand being made by employers. However, this was rejected by the government in April 2017 as they stated that existing legislation was &quot;adequate&quot;.
* 2020: Scotland became the first nation to pass a law (the Period Products (Free Provision) (Scotland) Act 2021) making period products, including tampons and pads, free and available to access in public buildings.

===2021–2030===
* 2021: Britain abolished the tampon tax, meaning there is now a zero rate of VAT applying to women&#x27;s sanitary products.
* 2024: The Garrick Club voted to admit women.

<text>The MG ZR is an MG branded &quot;hot hatch&quot; version of the Rover 25 supermini class car, produced by MG Rover at their Longbridge plant in Birmingham from 2001 to 2005. Compared to the Rover 25, the ZR featured a number of styling modifications and performance enhancements, such as updated sports suspension and a less baffled exhaust.

==Reception==
The MG ZR was one of Britain&#x27;s most popular sporting hatchbacks throughout its production life, and in 2004, it was MG Rover&#x27;s best selling car—the first time that any MG product had been the most popular product of any of the many combines that had owned the MG marque.

Tens of thousands of MG ZRs were sold in Britain and proved particularly popular with young buyers who were attracted by deals such as free insurance and discounts that were the equivalent of VAT. The car was made until April 2005. While its handling was praised by reviewers, other aspects of the ZR were found to be inadequate.

==Performance==

The entry level ZR 105 came with the 16 valve 1.4 K series engine which produced and torque giving a 0–60 mph time of 9.7 seconds and a top speed of . It featured 262mm solid discs up front and drum brakes at the rear.

The ZR 120 came with a larger 1.8 K series engine which produced and torque giving a 0–60 mph time of 8.6 seconds and a top speed of . This had a more advanced brake set up despite the small power increase, featuring the same diameter 262mm discs up front, but this time vented for better cooling. The drums at the back were also replaced with 239mm solid discs to maintain braking balance.

The range topping ZR 160 came with a 1.8 K Series VVC engine producing and torque giving a 0–60 mph of 7.4 seconds and a top speed of . This featured the most advanced brake set up available with 282mm vented front discs, and even larger solid 260mm rear discs.

There were also two diesel variants of the ZR, the first being the ZR TD 100 which had a 2.0 L Series engine producing and of torque, giving a 0-60 mph time of 9.7 seconds and a top speed of .

The other diesel engined ZR was the TD 115 which came with the same 2.0 L series engine but with some minor performance enhancements (improved ECU map), to produce and of torque, which gave the car a 0–60 mph time of 9.1 seconds and a top speed of .

The ZR TD 115 also came equipped with disc brakes at both the front and the rear sharing its brake set up with the ZR 120, whereas the ZR TD 100 had drums at the back, sharing its brake set up with the ZR 105.

The MG Express was produced alongside the MG ZR as a car derived van. It had the same trim options and running gear as the MG ZR, with a reinforced loadspace floor and bulkhead fitted instead of the rear seats, and the rear side windows replaced with bonded panels. A total of 317 Express vans were produced.

==Facelift==
In January 2004, the ZR was facelifted with the rest of the MG Rover range, the new design was created by Peter Stevens, who also designed the McLaren F1. A new, more modern look was given to the car through new front and rear bumpers, headlights, tailgate, and various other exterior features.

The 2004 model also received a revised interior with new seat materials and a new dashboard design incorporating soft touch buttons. This gave the cars a far more modern feel and matched the clean, more angular lines of the exterior.

The facelifted ZR also saw the introduction of the Trophy and Trophy SE models. The MG ZR Trophy features a sunroof, 16 inch &#x27;Grid spoke&#x27; alloy wheels, new rear light clusters, leather steering wheel, and side sill and rear bumper extensions. The Trophy SE features 17 inch &#x27;Straights&#x27; alloy wheels and has air conditioning in the place of a sunroof.

Under the &quot;Monogram&quot; program, buyers could also select a wide range of options to customise their ZR, such as choosing optional extras from the Rover 25 list. An example of this is rear parking sensors or heated seats.

== The MG ZR&#x27;s rallying history ==
The MG company produced a number of rally-based ZRs to be used in club and national rallying. MG Sport &amp; Racing signed Gwyndaf Evans, Tony Jardine and Natalie Barratt to compete in a number of events. Some MG ZRs still rally race at international tournaments and the 2007 Rally of GB event saw Luke Pinder racing a ZR in the N1 class, and despite not driving the car before the event, he led the class after day one and went on to win his class.

== MG ZR in racing ==

MG Sport &amp; Racing built two MG ZR 160&#x27;s to Group N Specification for the 2003 &quot;National Saloon Car Championship&quot;. After only two events, and due to poor grids, the &#x27;Team Airconstruct&#x27; cars were modified with dry break refueling systems and entered into the EERC Britcar Endurance Series run by James Tucker. Driven by car owner John Hammersley and teenager Andrew Dunlop, car #34 was a late entry into the Series, with only eight races remaining.

In a remarkable season, the Hammersley/Dunlop pairing scored maximum points in Britcar Class 4 in seven out of eight events, missing out on the overall title, and a perfect score, by only two points to Andy Rouse in a DTM Mercedes, and Calum Lockie in a BMW M3.

John Hammersley with son Mark took the Series win in the following year with the car, which had by then been upgraded to &#x27;works&#x27; specification , Group N+ Spec. The MG ZR is now raced in the MGCC in two classes, 160s and 190.

=== MG Car Club MG Trophy Championship ===
The MG Trophy is a single make club championship in the United Kingdom offering close racing for the front wheel drive MG ZR in three classes.

In 2014, the MG Car Club MG Trophy Championship saw the introduction of the ‘new’ 160 class (D) for basic road-going ZR160 cars. The previous 160 class (C) was upgraded with an ECU remap and other changes and rebranded as the 170 class. Both these changes proved to be winners, with four of the new 160&#x27;s and 19 170&#x27;s racing.

==MG Rover collapse==
In April 2005, MG Rover&#x27;s proposed takeover by SAIC collapsed, and the company went into receivership. Nanjing Automobile eventually bought the company&#x27;s assets three months later, but when the MG range was relaunched in April 2007, the ZR and ZS were not included in the model range. It was replaced by the MG3 SW in 2008, sold to the Chinese market only.

In 2010, SAIC announced a new MG3 concept car to replace the ZR, which entered the United Kingdom in September 2013. It was initially only available with a 1.5 litre, 105 hp engine. In 2016, the MG3 received many improvements: the installation of an EU 6 derivative of the standard 1.5-litre engine developed by SAIC Motor UK, a start-stop system was fitted, and two-tone colour schemes, primarily on the red and yellow MG3&#x27;s which can have either a black or white roof, were offered as options.

<doc id="1285190" wikidata="Q7246958" url="?curid=1285190" title="Problem of evil in Hinduism">
<text>The standard [[problem of evil]] found in monotheistic religions does not apply to almost all traditions of [[Hinduism]] because it does not posit an omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent creator.

Scholars have proposed alternate forms of the problem of evil based on Hinduism&#x27;s karma and transmigration doctrines. According to Arthur Herman, karma-transmigration theory solves all three historical formulations to the problem of evil while acknowledging the theodicy insights of Adi Shankara and Ramanuja.

==Applicability==
Hinduism is a complex religion with many different currents or schools. Its non-theist traditions such as Samkhya, early Nyaya, Mimamsa and many within Vedanta do not posit the existence of an almighty, omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent god (monotheistic god), and the classical formulations of the problem of evil and theodicy do not apply to most Hindu traditions. Further, deities in Hinduism are neither eternal nor omnipotent nor omniscient nor omnibenevolent. Devas are mortal and subject to samsara. Evil as well as good, along with suffering is considered real and caused by human free will, its source and consequences explained through the karma doctrine of Hinduism, as in other Indian religions.

Both evil (&quot;agha&quot;, अघ) and suffering (&quot;dukkha&quot;, दुःख) are extensively discussed in ancient and medieval Hindu texts. However, neither good nor evil, neither bliss nor suffering are linked to gods or god, but considered a part of the innate nature of living in the Saṃsāra cycle of rebirths. In Hindu thought, some suffering is self-caused (karma in this life or past life, either intentionally or from ignorance), some caused by evilness of others, some are natural (aging, disease, natural disasters). Some texts include the actions or influence of supernatural forces on evil experienced by man. One text of the ancient Samkhya school of Hinduism, for example describes three kinds of suffering: first, of body and mind caused by diseases or personal behavior such as anger, greed, delusion, etc.; second, suffering caused by other beings such as men, beasts, reptiles etc.; third, suffering caused by the influence of yaksha, planets and such forces. The Hindu texts describe and discuss suffering caused by both moral evils and natural evils.

Hinduism and other Indian religions do not focus on the problem of evil as formulated in monotheistic religions, by attempting to reconcile the nature of one all-powerful, all-seeing, all-benevolent god with existence of evil. Rather, they focus on the path to spiritual liberation called moksha, one that grants bliss in the present life such that evil and suffering have no effect on the liberated person&#x27;s state of inner peace and happiness, and attaining moksha also means an end to the cycle of rebirth. In theistic devotional sub-traditions of Hinduism, the personal god such as Krishna or Shiva or Devi is believed by the Hindu to stand by, as a form of spiritual support and liberator, when one faces evil and suffers.

==Problem of Injustice in the Brahma sutras==
A version of the problem of evil appears in the ancient &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot;, probably composed between 200 BCE and 200 CE, a foundational text of the Vedanta tradition of Hinduism. Its verses 2.1.34 through 2.1.36 aphoristically mention a version of the problem of suffering and evil in the context of the abstract metaphysical Hindu concept of Brahman. The verse 2.1.34 of &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot; asserts that inequality and cruelty in the world cannot be attributed to the concept of Brahman, and this is in the Vedas and the Upanishads. In his interpretation and commentary on the &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot;, the 8th-century scholar Adi Shankara states that just because some people are happier than others and just because there is so much malice, cruelty and pain in the world, some state that Brahman cannot be the cause of the world. Shankara attributes evil and cruelty in the world to Karma of oneself, of others, and to ignorance, delusion and wrong knowledge, but not to the abstract Brahman. Shankara develops the argument that God is not the Brahman, and that &quot;a loving and good God could not have created the universe&quot;, a position held by Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism.

In other words, in the &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot;, the formulation of problem of evil is considered a metaphysical construct, but not a moral issue. Ramanuja of the theistic Sri Vaishnavism school – a major tradition within Vaishnavism – interprets the same verse in the context of Vishnu, and asserts that Vishnu only creates potentialities.

According to Swami Gambhirananda, Sankara&#x27;s commentary explains that God cannot be charged with partiality or cruelty (i.e. injustice) on account of his taking the factors of virtuous and vicious actions (Karma) performed by an individual in previous lives. If an individual experiences pleasure or pain in this life, it is due to virtuous or vicious action (Karma) done by that individual in a past life 

Ramanuja of the theistic Sri Vaishnavism school interprets the same verse in the context of Vishnu, and asserts that Vishnu only creates potentialities. According to Arvind Sharma, Shankara&#x27;s Advaita Vedanta school does not attribute the evil and suffering to the abstract concept of Brahman, but to ignorance, delusion and wrong knowledge. The universe and all existence is without a beginning or end, and Brahman is everything before and after that beginning, before and after the end. Further, in Hindu thought, neither evil nor error are final, all happiness and suffering is impermanent, and truth ultimately triumphs.

==Karma doctrine and the problem of evil==
The theory of karma refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect). The problem of evil, in the context of karma, has been long discussed in Indian religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, both in its theistic and non-theistic schools; for example, in Uttara Mīmāṃsā Sutras Book 2 Chapter 1; the 8th century arguments by Adi Sankara in &quot;Brahmasutrabhasya&quot; where he posits that God cannot reasonably be the cause of the world because there exists moral evil, inequality, cruelty and suffering in the world; and the 11th century theodicy discussion by Ramanuja in &quot;Sribhasya&quot;.

Many Indian religions place greater emphasis on developing the karma principle for first cause and innate justice with Man as focus, rather than developing religious principles with the nature and powers of God and divine judgment as focus. Karma theory of Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism is not static, but dynamic wherein livings beings with intent or without intent, but with words and actions continuously create new karma, and it is this that they believe to be in part the source of good or evil in the world. These religions also believe that past lives or past actions in current life create current circumstances, which also contributes to either. Other scholars suggest that nontheistic Indian religious traditions do not assume an omnibenevolent creator, and some theistic schools do not define or characterize their God(s) as monotheistic Western religions do and the deities have colorful, complex personalities; the Indian deities are personal and cosmic facilitators, and in some schools conceptualized like Plato’s Demiurge. Therefore, the problem of theodicy in many schools of major Indian religions is not significant, or at least is of a different nature than in Western religions.

==Dvaita tradition of Vaishnavism==
One sub-tradition within the Vaishnavism school of Hinduism that is an exception is dualistic Dvaita, founded by Madhvacharya in the 13th-century. Madhvacharya was challenged by Hindu scholars on the problem of evil, given his dualistic Dvaita Vedanta (&quot;Tattvavada&quot;) theory that proposed God (Vishnu, supreme soul) and the individual souls (jīvātman) exist as independent realities, and these are distinct. Madhvacharya asserted, &quot;Yathecchasi tatha kuru&quot;, which Sharma translates and explains as &quot;one has the right to choose between right and wrong, a choice each individual makes out of his own responsibility and his own risk&quot;. According to Sharma, &quot;Madhva&#x27;s tripartite classification of souls makes it unnecessary to answer the problem of evil&quot;.

<text>SS &quot;Federico C.&quot; was a cruise ship that made headlines when its passengers were unloaded mid-way through their cruise and the vessel was put under arrest in Halifax Harbour. The ship then sank in international waters three months later. At the time of the sinking, It was owned by International Shipping Partners and insured for $20M while its scrap value was estimated at $5–6M.

==History==
The ship was launched on 31 March 1957 and completed in March 1958 by the Ansaldo Sestri Ponente shipyard in Italy as &quot;Federico C&quot;, the first new ship built for the Costa Cruises. The ship initially provided a liner service between Genoa, Italy and Buenos Aires, Argentina via Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. During that time, in 1963, Witold Gombrowicz traveled from Buenos Aires, Argentina to Europe on the ship. The famous Polish writer and playwright left his home country 24 years earlier aboard MV Chrobry, having been invited to take part in the maiden voyage of the latest addition to the Polish flotilla of liners. In 1966 &quot;Federico C&quot; was transferred to a service between Genoa and Florida, the Caribbean and Venezuela. The ship underwent a major refit in 1968, then added Caribbean cruises between trans-Atlantic trips. &quot;Federico C&quot; operated cruises exclusively from 1972 until 1983, when the ship was sold.

In 1983, Premier Cruises obtained the ship and named it &quot;Royale&quot;; it became &quot;StarShip Royale&quot; in the same year. In 1988, the ship was renamed &quot;SeaBreeze&quot; when it was placed in service for Dolphin Cruise Lines. One year later, the ship had been refurbished. Premier took possession of the ship when it acquired Dolphin in 1997. When Premier went out of business in September 2000, the ship was ordered to immediately cease operations and dock at Halifax Harbour. Some days later, it sailed to be laid up in Freeport, Bahamas.

==Sinking==
On December 17, 2000, the ship sank off the coast of North Carolina/Virginia. The boiler allegedly broke off and damaged the ship.

The investigation into the sinking of &quot;Seabreeze I&quot; caused international concern, based upon numerous suspicious incidents, including the fact that the ship was likely to fetch only between $5 and $6 million for scrap, but had a $20 million insurance policy on it. The cruise ship sank in international waters flying the Panamanian flag, making Panama responsible for the investigation of the sinking.

The ship&#x27;s captain told the United States Coast Guard rescuers that his boat was in imminent danger of sinking as a result of its engine room being flooded in high winds and seas. At the time, the Coast Guard rescuers believed that it was highly unlikely for a ship that large to sink that quickly, and were astonished when the Greek captain demanded that all hands be extracted from the ship, instead of requesting salvage tugs and trying to tow it to shore for recovery. Subsequently, all 34 crewmembers were rescued; there were no passengers on board.

At the time of the sinking, Steven Cotton of the International Transport Workers&#x27; Federation in London stated that he wished that the ship, which went down off the Virginia coast, had gone down closer to the coast because that would have put the case in the hands of American investigators. According to Cotton, &quot;Panama&#x27;s track record of carrying out comprehensive investigations into vessel sinkings is not very good.&quot;

The vessel had just been purchased by Cruise Ventures III, a subsidiary of New York-based DLJ Capital Funding, and was traveling from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Charleston, South Carolina.

<text>Warrick De&#x27;Mon Dunn (born January 5, 1975) is an American former professional football player who was a running back for 12 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 12th overall in the 1997 NFL draft, after playing college football for the Florida State Seminoles. Dunn was named AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year in 1997 and earned three Pro Bowl selections in his career. After his playing career, Dunn took a minority stake in the Falcons&#x27; ownership group led by Arthur Blank.

==Early life==
At Catholic High in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Dunn played quarterback, cornerback, and running back. During his sophomore year, he helped lead Catholic High to the state 4A championship game for the first time in its history. He was an All-America honorable mention selection by &quot;USA Today&quot; as a senior.

On January 7, 1993, two days after Dunn&#x27;s eighteenth birthday, his mother, Betty Smothers, a Baton Rouge Police Officer, was murdered while working an off-duty security job. Dunn became the head of his family and raised his siblings. He later met with one of his mother&#x27;s killers, Kevan Brumfield, and offered his forgiveness.

==College career==
Dunn played college football at Florida State University, where he rushed for over 1,000 yards in 3 straight seasons. He graduated in 1997 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in information studies. He was a three-time All-ACC selection.

Dunn&#x27;s jersey, along with those of other Seminoles players such as Fred Biletnikoff, Ron Sellers, Ron Simmons, Charlie Ward, Deion Sanders, and Chris Weinke, has been retired by the university. His number (28) may still be worn by Seminole players, but his jersey will be displayed in the Moore Athletic Center at FSU. He also won a national championship in 1993 with Florida State.

===Track and field===
Warrick Dunn was also an accomplished track and field star, named as an Associated Press All-American as a member of Florida State&#x27;s men&#x27;s 4x100m relay team. Dunn competed on the Seminoles&#x27; track &amp; field team as a sprinter during all four years he was enrolled at Florida State. His personal best in the 100 meters is 10.3 seconds.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
===Tampa Bay Buccaneers (first stint)===
Dunn was selected in the first round of the 1997 NFL draft with the 12th overall pick by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Dunn had a highly successful rookie season, was selected to the NFC Pro Bowl team, and named the Associated Press Offensive Rookie of the Year. Dunn spent the next four years of his career in Tampa Bay, and was again named to the Pro Bowl in 2000. In game 13 of that season, he had a career-best 210 yards rushing against the Dallas Cowboys (then, 2nd most in franchise history).

===Atlanta Falcons===
A free agent in the 2002 offseason, Dunn signed with the Atlanta Falcons. Once again, he made a positive impact on his team with 9 total TDs and in that year, he led the league with a 5.4 yards per carry average. Dunn scored the most rushing touchdowns in his career, 9, in the 2004 season despite splitting carries with T.J. Duckett and also led the team in rushing with 1,106 yards. Having led his team in rushing yards again in 2005, Dunn was named the NFC&#x27;s Pro Bowl team, marking his third selection to the team. For his career, Dunn has only missed 10 games and has a total of 2,256 carries for 9,461 yards 43 touchdowns and a 4.2 average. Dunn finished his first 10 seasons with at least 1,000 combined rushing and receiving yards per season. During the 2007 season, with Falcons starting quarterback Byron Leftwich out with a high ankle sprain, Dunn served as the third string emergency quarterback behind Joey Harrington and Chris Redman, a position he played in high school.

On March 3, 2008, the Falcons released Dunn per his request. This came a day after the Falcons signed former San Diego Chargers backup running back Michael Turner. On December 17, 2009, he became a minority owner of the Atlanta Falcons.

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers (second stint)===
On March 10, 2008, Dunn returned to the Buccaneers after signing a two-year, $6 million contract. In week 6 against the Carolina Panthers, Dunn had his first 100-yard game since re-joining the Buccaneers. Dunn was released by the Buccaneers on February 25, 2009. He retired from the NFL 14th all-time in all-purpose yards with 15,306 (20th ) and 19th in rushing yards with 10,967 (23rd ).

==NFL career statistics==

* 1000+ rushing yard seasons: career (2, tied with 3 others)

==Personal life==
Dunn established the Homes for the Holidays (HFTH) program in 1997, and started Warrick Dunn Charities (WDC) in 2002 as a way to grow programs and services. The HFTH program rewards single-parent families for reaching first-time homeownership. HFTH recipient families are chosen through a partnership with Habitat for Humanity affiliates and WDC with complete home furnishings and down-payment assistance. As of July 2012, HFTH has assisted over 150 single parents and over 300 dependents in Atlanta, Baton Rouge, Tampa and Tallahassee. By providing families with a positive home environment, WDC believes that children can thrive educationally, socially and economically. In 2006, one of those homes happened to go to the family of future NFL player Deshaun Watson. Watson went on to play quarterback for Clemson and win the 2017 College Football Playoff National Championship.

Dunn&#x27;s achievements have been recognized over the years. He received a Giant Steps Award in civic leadership from former President Bill Clinton for his program. In 2005, Dunn was presented with the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award. This award is the only NFL award that recognizes a player for his community service as well as for his excellence on the field. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Dunn challenged all NFL players, except for those who play for the New Orleans Saints, to donate at least $5,000 to the effort. The effort received over $5 million in contributions.

In 2007, Dunn, along with Andre Agassi, Muhammad Ali, Lance Armstrong, Jeff Gordon, Mia Hamm, Tony Hawk, Andrea Jaeger, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Mario Lemieux, Alonzo Mourning and Cal Ripken Jr., founded Athletes for Hope, a charitable organization that helps professional athletes, sports industry professionals and fans get involved in charitable causes.
For his exceptional involvement on and off the field, Dunn was awarded with the 2009 Bart Starr Award. He also received a Jefferson Award for Outstanding Athlete in Service and Philanthropy in 2011.

===Writing===
Dunn&#x27;s 2008 autobiography, &quot;Running For My Life&quot; , details his mother&#x27;s murder and his battles with depression throughout his life.

<doc id="1285206" wikidata="Q916973" url="?curid=1285206" title="Funeral for a Friend">
<text>Funeral for a Friend are a Welsh post-hardcore band from Bridgend, formed in 2001. The band&#x27;s members are Kris Roberts (guitar, backing vocals), Gavin Burrough (guitar, vocals), Darran Smith (guitar), Richard Boucher (bass), and Ryan Richards (drums, vocals).

Funeral for a Friend&#x27;s popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their debut album, &quot;Casually Dressed &amp; Deep in Conversation&quot; (2003). Achieving both a gold certification and three top-twenty singles in their home country, &quot;Casually Dressed &amp; Deep in Conversation&quot; is often acclaimed as one of the landmark emo records of the 2000s. &quot;Hours&quot; (2005) featured a similar musical style to their debut, but also showcased more melodic sensibilities, and &quot;Tales Don&#x27;t Tell Themselves&quot; (2007) showed an evolution in Funeral for a Friend&#x27;s musical style from that which defined their debut, as the group began to diverge from their use of screaming vocals and post-hardcore-influenced guitars, favoring a more melodic rock influence. These albums achieved gold and silver sales certificates respectively in the UK.

Funeral for a Friend self-released their fourth album, &quot;Memory and Humanity&quot; (2008) through their short-lived record label &quot;Join Us&quot;, the album arguably being their most eclectic to date. Following this the band tied themselves to other independent labels for &quot;Welcome Home Armageddon&quot; (2011) &quot;Conduit&quot; (2013), and &quot;Chapter and Verse&quot; (2015), which showed the band returning to the heavier style of their earlier work. In September 2015, they announced their break-up and final tour in 2016. On 21 May 2016, they played their last performance to a sold-out Forum in London.

In October 2019, Funeral for a Friend reunited as a live band, initially for three benefit shows – two in Cardiff at the Cardiff University Student Union followed by one in London at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire. Following a planned performance at the canceled 2020 Download Festival, they announced a headline UK tour for April 2021 playing songs from their first three albums. In December 2023 the band announced they would be returning to recording music, but without founding vocalist Matthew Davies-Kreye.

==History==
===Formation and early years (2001–2003)===
When Michael Davies, one of January Thirst&#x27;s original vocalists, quit in December 2001, Matthew Evans (vocals) and Johnny Phillips (drums) invited Matt Davies (later Davies-Kreye) to try out for the vacated singer position. Soon afterward, the band reformed as Funeral for a Friend; the name is derived from a song by Planes Mistaken for Stars, one of Davies&#x27; favourite bands at the time.

During the start of the New Year they parted ways with second guitarist Kerry Roberts (Kris Roberts&#x27;s brother) and found a suitable replacement in Darran Smith (ex-Tripcage). The band recorded four tracks at Mighty Atom Studios for a proposed self-financed EP with another Welsh band &quot;From This Moment On&quot;. Upon hearing the tracks, Mighty Atom Records approached the band and offered a two-album deal, resulting in their debut EP, &quot;Between Order and Model&quot; (2002). Before the EP&#x27;s release, Andi Morris (bass) quit to join death metal band Amputated, with Phillips and Evans also leaving. The band then recruited Gareth Davies (later Ellis-Davies) on bass and Ryan Richards on drums. Matt Davies became the band&#x27;s only primary vocalist, with Gareth Davies performing backing melodies and Richards taking over Evans&#x27; screaming role.

In 2003, Funeral for a Friend recorded their second EP, &quot;Four Ways to Scream Your Name&quot;, produced and mixed by Colin Richardson. In mid-2003, the band secured their first &quot;Kerrang!&quot; award, winning the award for &quot;Best UK Newcomer&quot;, beating The Darkness, who won in all other nominated categories. Funeral for a Friend&#x27;s win was largely attributed to their fervent fan base, as the awards winner was decided by public vote online at the official &quot;Kerrang!&quot; Web site. In August 2003, Funeral for a Friend opened the Concrete Jungle stage at the Reading and Leeds Festivals.

===Major record label years and international success (2003–2009)===
====&quot;Casually Dressed &amp; Deep in Conversation&quot;====
On 21 August 2003, Funeral for a Friend were awarded a Kerrang! Award for &quot;Best British Newcomer&quot;. On 20 October 2003, after recording for the duration of the summer, Funeral for a Friend&#x27;s full-length debut album was released. &quot;Casually Dressed &amp; Deep in Conversation&quot;, produced and mixed by Colin Richardson, was released to critical acclaim in the UK. The album did not see a concurrent release in the US (though it eventually released there on 13 July 2004); instead, a seven-track &quot;mini-album&quot;, entitled &quot;Seven Ways to Scream Your Name&quot;, was released, and featured songs from the band&#x27;s &quot;Between Order &amp; Model&quot; and &quot;Four Ways to Scream Your Name&quot; EPs plus Juneau B Side &quot;The Getaway Plan&quot;. In the United Kingdom the album received a Gold certification a year after its release on 29 October 2004, which was achieved with a sales figure of over 100,000.

&quot;Casually Dressed &amp; Deep in Conversation&quot; saw three top-twenty singles including &quot;Juneau&quot; (#19), &quot;She Drove Me to Daytime Television&quot; (#20) and &quot;Escape Artists Never Die&quot; (#19). Funeral for a Friend toured extensively to promote &quot;Casually Dressed &amp; Deep in Conversation&quot;, including a series of European dates in which they opened for Iron Maiden. This was met with a mixed reception, as their style and fan base bore little resemblance to the heavy metal background of Iron Maiden.

The band joined Avenged Sevenfold, My Chemical Romance and Moments in Grace for an American tour spanning 17–23 April 2004. Coinciding with their shows together, Funeral for a Friend and Moments in Grace teamed up for a split 7-inch vinyl, co-released through Atlantic Records, Salad Days Records, Mighty Atom Records and Infectious Records, on 20 April 2004. Funeral for a Friend contributed the song &quot;Bullet Theory&quot; (previously-released in the UK but then-unreleased in the US). In promotion of the split 7-inch vinyl, webzine Ultimate Guitar held a giveaway contest for five winners to receive a record and a signed poster. Also in 2004, Funeral for a Friend supported Linkin Park throughout America and headlined the second stage of the Reading and Leeds Festivals.

====&quot;Hours&quot;====
In May 2005, the first single from the upcoming second album &quot;Streetcar&quot; acted as the band&#x27;s fourth consecutive top 20 single in the United Kingdom by debuting at number 15. On 14 June 2005, the band released their second album &quot;Hours&quot; through Atlantic Records. Produced by Terry Date, the album was recorded in two Seattle studios owned by the grunge band Pearl Jam and featured unusual methods of recording, for example Matt Davies&#x27; vocals were recorded whilst in a moving car and on a crowded Seattle street, for the song &quot;Drive&quot;. Just two weeks after its release the album was certified a Silver over 60,000 sales and was awarded a Gold for over 100,000 sales on 23 December 2005. In August of the same year, the band won a Kerrang! Award for &quot;Best British Band&quot;.

Funeral for a Friend performed several low-profile shows in Wales, including Bangor University and Bridgend Recreation Centre, prior to the release of &quot;Hours&quot;. In the United States, they played alongside bands such as Atreyu, Saosin, Hawthorne Heights and Thrice on the Maurice Stage of the 2005 Vans Warped Tour. The band headlined the British leg of Taste of Chaos across November with support from The Used, Killswitch Engage, Rise Against and Story of the Year. Funeral for a Friend released the third and last single from Hours, &quot;History&quot;, which music video depicts the events of the miner strikes of the mid-1980s in South Wales.

Funeral For a Friend closed the promotional activity for &quot;Hours&quot; in the Summer of 2006, with a series of UK shows rescheduled from February. Most of the original dates had been cancelled because Matt Davies had suffered from a bout of laryngitis. Several other shows were scheduled in the UK to complement these rescheduled dates, and the tour culminated in a slot below headliners Guns N&#x27; Roses at the Download Festival at Donington Park. The rest of 2006 was spent writing and recording the band&#x27;s third album.

====&quot;Tales Don&#x27;t Tell Themselves&quot;====
Funeral for a Friend mentioned the writing of this album during their UK shows in summer 2006 and they started writing and recording at the end of the tour. &quot;Tales Don&#x27;t Tell Themselves&quot; was released on 14 May 2007 in the UK, having been leaked to the internet on 10 May 2007. The band released video diary updates of the recording on their MySpace page.

A selection of intimate shows to promote the album were played on 12, 13 and 14 April 2007 in intimate coastal venues in the south of England. Only 200 tickets were available for each show and these had to be applied for via an e-mail sent to members of the FFAF mailing list. Names were then picked out of a hat and the selected people were offered the opportunity to buy a pair of tickets to the gig, exclusive T-shirts were given to anyone paying using PayPal mobile. On 8 May 2007 the band released &quot;Tales Don&#x27;t Tell Themselves&quot; in its entirety for fans to preview via their MySpace page. This album is the first on which Matt plays guitar. On 10 May 2007 the band played another intimate gig for Kerrang! 105.2 at the Wolverhampton Civic Hall Bar, in which they played &quot;Walk Away&quot; for the very first time. This is one of the tracks which Matt plays guitar on live, alongside &quot;Raise The Sail&quot; and &quot;The Sweetest Wave&quot;, which were debuted on the full tour in May 2007. The album was their highest charting yet, reaching Number 3 in the UK Album Charts.

On 16 July 2007, &quot;Walk Away&quot;, was released as the second single from &quot;Tales Don&#x27;t Tell Themselves&quot; and reached number 40 in the UK singles charts. It was announced in a newsletters that &quot;The Great Wide Open&quot; would be the next single and would be released as an EP. The EP, &quot;The Great Wide Open&quot; was released on 15 October 2007 through Atlantic Records, negating the release of the single itself.

====&quot;Memory and Humanity&quot; and &quot;Your History Is Mine&quot;====

On 26 January 2008, drummer Ryan Richards made an announcement on the band&#x27;s forum, stating that FFAF were to spend the first few months of the year recording, with a view of releasing a four or five track EP in March or April 2008. After writing more material than originally planned, the band decided to scrap plans for the EP and released a full-length album instead. Ryan also announced that the new album would contain screaming vocals, riffs and would be closer to &quot;Casually Dressed &amp; Deep in Conversation&quot; than any of their other albums, although would still be significantly different and more technical, citing that they want to move forward, and never back to any old style.

On 11 May 2008, it was announced via a MySpace bulletin that the band would be shooting a video for the first single from the album, &quot;Waterfront Dance Club&quot;, on 17 May. &quot;Waterfront Dance Club&quot; was played exclusively for the first time on Radio 1&#x27;s Rock Show on 2 June 2008, where it was also announced that the single would be released as a double A-side with the track &quot;Beneath the Burning Tree&quot;. Both singles were also released as a limited edition 7-inch on the same date. The album&#x27;s title was confirmed as &quot;Memory and Humanity&quot; by Rock Sound magazine on 30 June 2008, and that its release would take place in October 2008. On 2 July 2008, the band announced the UK tour of &quot;Memory and Humanity&quot;, commencing 14 October 2008.

9 August 2008 saw the debut of the video for the single &quot;Kicking and Screaming&quot; on MySpace. Later that month on the 27th, it was announced that the band had licensed their new record to Victory Records for the U.S. and Canadian releases.
The album was released via the label on 28 October 2008. It was also released via Roadrunner Records in the rest of the world, apart from the UK, where it was released through the band&#x27;s own label, &quot;Join Us&quot;. The release was followed by a tour in Britain, Ireland and northern Europe, supported by Canadian hardcore punk act Cancer Bats.

On 4 September 2008, it was announced via a MySpace blog post that Gareth Davies had left the band, to be replaced by Gavin Burrough (Hondo Maclean, Ghostlines, The Future). &quot;As some of you may know, Gareth has been living in America for the past couple of years, and recently got married. Ultimately, the strain of travelling between continents has taken its toll and Gareth made the decision that it would be in the best interests of himself, his family and Funeral to leave the band. We totally respect and understand his choice, wish him all the best in his future and we thank him for being part of our lives for the past 6 years.&quot; The first interview to surface with Burrough in the band appeared on the Rocklouder webzine in the week of the &quot;Memory and Humanity&quot; release. In the 24 January 2009 issue of Kerrang! magazine, it was stated that the band were currently filming the video for the third single off the album, &quot;Rules and Games&quot;. The single was released on 23 March 2009. They will also be going on tour with We Are the Ocean supporting to coincide with its release.

It was initially revealed in Kerrang! magazine on 24 June 2009 that the band were to release a greatest hits album, entitled &quot;Your History Is Mine: 2002–2009&quot; on 28 September 2009. the Compilation album was released by Atlantic records because the record deal between the band and the label allowed the Atlantic records to release a compilation CD at any point in the band&#x27;s career. The band then decided to record four brand new tracks in order to give the release value to fans. On 21 July 2009, &quot;Wrench&quot;, one of the new songs, premiered on Radio One&#x27;s Rock Show with Dan Carter. Zane Lowe credited them as &quot;one of the best British bands of the last decade&quot; upon the release of &quot;Your History Is Mine&quot;.

===Independent years (2010–2016)===
====Break from Atlantic Records and &quot;Welcome Home Armageddon&quot;====

On 23 April 2010, Funeral for a Friend announced on Facebook that guitarist Darran Smith would be leaving the band, but not before playing his final shows.

That ought to be an indication of how great he is.&quot; The band stated that they are excited for the new material being made and can&#x27;t wait to show the fans what they have: &quot;The creative well, is well and truly overflowing. Exciting times. Stay tuned, and be ready.&quot;

It was also announced via &quot;Kerrang!&quot; that the newly recorded EP would be released on 1 September 2010; however, in actuality, the downloadable version was released on 6 September 2010 with the physical copies being planned on being released sometime in the third week of October. On 9 November, Funeral For a Friend released a music video for the track &quot;Serpents in Solitude&quot;. Towards the end of October 2010 they finished a session of recording for a new album for which a name and date were yet to be announced. On 2 November, they played two new songs, confirmed to be on this album (which was announced as due for release in March 2011), called &quot;Man Alive&quot; and &quot;Front Row Seats to the End of the World&quot;. Another song title was confirmed as &quot;Spinning Over the Island&quot;.
On 10 January 2011, the band released the official video for the album&#x27;s leading single &quot;Front Row Seats to the End of the World&quot; and announced their fifth studio album would be called &quot;Welcome Home Armageddon&quot;. On 17 January, they released the album&#x27;s artwork and track list On 24 January, it was announced that the album was to be released by Good Fight Music, a move that would reconnect the band with the original label team that released &quot;Seven Ways to Scream Your Name&quot; and &quot;Casually Dressed &amp; Deep in Conversation&quot;. On 9 February, the band released the video for their newest single, &quot;Sixteen&quot;. On 5 March 2011, the band played their first ever show in South Africa, at the RAMFest in Worcester, outside of Cape Town alongside Alkaline Trio and Die Antwoord. They concluded their South African tour by playing in Durban and Johannesburg on 9 and 12 March 2011 respectively.

The EP is titled &quot;See You All in Hell&quot; and it will feature only one brand new track while the remainder of the tracks are acoustic, live session recordings and remixes of tracks from &quot;Welcome Home Armageddon&quot; as well as a cover of a Strife song. The band has expressed an eagerness to return to the studio and write the follow-up to &quot;Welcome Home Armageddon&quot; and they describe &quot;High Castles&quot; as being a &quot;good indication of where we&#x27;ll be taking things on the next record.&quot; The release of the EP is accompanied by a UK tour by the band in October with support from Escape The Fate, The Amity Affliction, The Bunny The Bear and Straight Lines. On 13 October 2011, Funeral for a Friend released a new digital single from the EP titled &quot;High Castles&quot;, the only original track from the EP. See You All in Hell was released on 7 November.

====&quot;Conduit&quot; and departure of Ryan Richards====
On 22 May 2012, Ryan Richards announced that he was leaving the band. He cited his family as the reason, saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve always put music first in my life - but the time has come now for my family to take the top spot.&quot; Pat Lundy replaced Richards in the band full-time, after initial discussions over joining as a touring member. Lundy is the former drummer of London-based heavy metal band Rise to Remain, having left the band in January 2012. After being contacted by the band to come to audition in Cardiff for the role, Pat learned their whole setlist in seven days for the audition. Whilst the line up change occurred the band was recording and mixing their follow-up to their fifth studio album. Across the year the band made few live appearances as they were working on the album, performing at Wakestock in North Wales, both the northern and southern dates of Slam Dunk Festival 2012 and the UK Warped Tour festival at the Alexandra Palace in London on 10 November 2012.
Funeral for a Friend spent all of 2012, bar their brief festival appearances, writing and recording for their sixth studio album. Over the year they released several studio updates showing the band members tracking different instruments for the album. On 4 October of that year the band confirmed the title and release date of their sixth album &quot;Conduit&quot; for a 28 January 2013 release in the United Kingdom and on 5 February 2013 through The End Records In the United States. To support the release of the album, the band underwent a headlining tour with support acts such as Such Gold, Daytrader and I Divide throughout January and February. However, Daytrader had to pull out of the tour, so Major League took their place on the bill. The band continues to work with Welsh music producer, Romesh Dodangoda, on the album as they did with their previous album. Vocalist Matthew Davies-Kreye spoke of their working union, &quot;To me, he gets our individual personalities and works his magic with each of us, making sure that we&#x27;re all comfortable with what we have to do for the record.&quot; Davies-Kreye has described the reasoning behind the title &quot;Conduit&quot; as &quot;the experiences of being in a band&quot; and summarised the album&#x27;s style as &quot;a post-hardcore record that is not afraid to drop into some hardcore for good measure.&quot; The first single from the album, &quot;Best Friends and Hospital Beds&quot;, would be released on 12 November with the music video being released prior on 10 October.

After its first week of release in the United Kingdom, &quot;Conduit&quot; debuted at number 34 on the official UK album charts. Funeral for a Friend completed a 10-date Australian tour in May, which will mark the band&#x27;s most extensive yet in the country. Later in 2013, the band released a remastered edition of the Between Order and Model EP on End Hits Records, complete with some previously unreleased tracks and live versions of the EP tracks.

In April 2014, they toured the UK and Europe playing &quot;Hours&quot; in its entirety. During these shows, they also performed a new song titled &quot;1%&quot; from their forthcoming seventh album.

====&quot;Chapter and Verse&quot; and breakup====
On 28 September 2014, Funeral for a Friend debuted the lead single from their forthcoming album &quot;Chapter and Verse&quot;, titled &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Bad Case of the Religions&quot; on the Rock Show on BBC Radio 1. The band then announced the album&#x27;s release date of 19 January 2015 as well as a UK/European Tour in support of the album. &quot;Chapter and Verse&quot; was recorded in just under two weeks, at The Ranch, Southampton; the record was produced by Lewis Johns. They also announced that Pat Lundy had left the band to focus on his new band Modestep, and that Goodtime Boys drummer Casey McHale would be their live/touring drummer, but they weren&#x27;t looking for a replacement full-time drummer. Prior to the album&#x27;s release, music videos were released for both &quot;1%&quot; and &quot;Pencil Pusher&quot;. In June, they released &quot;Hours - Live at Islington Academy&quot;, a live DVD of their show at O2 Academy Islington in April 2014 where they played &quot;Hours&quot; in full. The DVD also came with a CD or vinyl record of the show. Also around this time, they recorded a cover of &quot;I Can Climb Mountains&quot; by Hell Is For Heroes for &quot;Worship and Tributes&quot;, a compilation CD included with Rock Sound magazine&#x27;s 200th issue, which ended up being the band&#x27;s final recording. They were the only band who recorded a cover for the compilation who had one of their own songs covered on the same compilation, with Pop Punk band Neck Deep covering &quot;Juneau&quot;.

On 14 September 2015, Funeral for a Friend announced their breakup and the &#x27;Last Chance to Dance&#x27; final tour across Australia, Germany and the UK, which spanned from February to April 2016; they played two subsequent nights on each stop of the tour, performing &quot;Hours&quot; and &quot;Casually Dressed &amp; Deep in Conversation&quot; in their entirety (alongside other songs) on the first and second night respectively. In October 2015, the band announced American metalcore band Shai Hulud would support them on their final tour, with Zoax being announced as the opening band in December. In late February, the band announced the London shows originally scheduled for 15 and 16 April at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire would instead take place on 20 and 21 May 2016 at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town due to structural issues at the original venue which caused many gigs to be cancelled/moved to other dates. Due to Shai Hulud being unable to make the rearranged dates, Raging Speedhorn and Creeper played as the main support bands on 20 and 21 May respectively. Their final performance was on 21 May.

===Reunion (2019–present)===
====Live shows====
In August 2019, Funeral for a Friend announced two special reunion concerts, with the proceedings going to the family of a terminally ill friend of the band. The two shows were set to be on 28 and 29 October at The Globe in Cardiff and O2 Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in London. As well as members Matt Davies-Kreye, Kris Roberts, Gav Burrough, and Richard Boucher, the band will be joined by former guitarist Darran Smith and drummer/screamer Ryan Richards. After the initial two dates sold out quickly, the Cardiff show was upgraded from The Globe to the Cardiff Student Union, and a second Cardiff date was added for 27 October.

On 27 January 2020, Download festival announced their upcoming performance as part of the 2020 lineup. The festival would be cancelled in April, however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. In September 2021, the band were a late addition to Slam Dunk festival. In July 2020, the band announced that they would be touring the UK in April 2021 playing songs from &quot;Casually-dressed &amp; deep in Conversation&quot;, &quot;Hours&quot;, and &quot;Tales don&#x27;t tell themselves&quot;, also due to COVID-19 the tour dates were postponed, taking place in early March 2022. After the initial dates sold out, the band added two additional dates in Cardiff and London and upgraded the venues for Manchester and Glasgow, which was then followed up with four additional dates in Leeds, Bristol, and Bournemouth alongside a third London date at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire. Due to illness, Richard Boucher was replaced on bass for the last 4 shows by the band&#x27;s guitar-tech Steve Nash.

In March 2023, the band announced that they would tour the UK to celebrate the 20th anniversary of ‘casually dressed…’ with special guests Dashboard Confessional as the supporting act. Tickets went on sale in March 2023 with dates for the tour scheduled to kick off at the Manchester O2 on 7 October 2023 and finishing at London’s Roundhouse on 15 October 2023. 

The tour would prove to be the last with Matt Davies-Kreye as lead vocalist leaving Kris Roberts as the only original member of the 2001 lineup.

====Return to recording music and Davies-Kreye&#x27;s departure====
On 4 December 2023, Funeral for a Friend announced that they would be recording new music, but Matthew Davies-Kreye had decided not to commit to their future plans and had therefore left the band. Lucas Woodland, the vocalist for Holding Absence, performed with the band at Slam Dunk Festival 2024 and Download Festival 2024.

==Musical style and influences==
Funeral for a Friend&#x27;s music has been described variously as post-hardcore, emo, melodic hardcore, heavy metal and screamo. Guitarist Gavin Burrough describes the band&#x27;s style as eclectic, based on each members individual influences and summarising Funeral for a Friend&#x27;s style by pointing out &quot;there&#x27;s a definite melancholy feel to our tracks[...] We can punish you with our metallic, angular riffs, and also seduce you with our serene melodies.&quot; Their influences include Shai Hulud, Glassjaw, Poison the Well, Thursday, Manic Street Preachers, the Haunted, Vision of Disorder, Deadguy, Kiss It Goodbye, and Drowningman. Regarding the &quot;emo&quot; label, drummer Ryan Richards has said &quot;I have no more problem with being called emo than with being called metal or hardcore, I just don&#x27;t think any one term or label does justice to the music we do.&quot;

Their earlier EPs and their debut album &quot;Casually Dressed &amp; Deep in Conversation&quot; were considered their heaviest work for some time, as their subsequent material used less aggressive vocals and instrumentation; however, recent years have seen a resurgence of such elements and a higher number of &#x27;heavy&#x27; songs. &quot;tour de force of audience-friendly post-hardcore&quot;. Their second album &quot;Hours&quot; is seen as being a part of the new wave of emo that occurred during the mid-2000s. Songs on Hours were seen as the band &quot;transcending their genre limitations&quot;, including &quot;History&quot; which combines &quot;melodic interplay and sincere lyricism&quot;.

While their next two albums followed a different musical direction. With &quot;Tales Don&#x27;t Tell Themselves&quot; they use a more alternative rock and post-hardcore style with classic rock, alternative country and 1980s heartland rock influences. The album uses choral elements for tracks like &quot;Into Oblivion (Reunion)&quot;. Their 4th album, &quot;Memory and Humanity&quot; returned to a more post-hardcore sound however adopted a more alternative rock influence, incorporating an emo influence with an anthemic rock uplift.

All subsequent material following the band&#x27;s extended play, &quot;The Young &amp; Defenceless&quot; saw them returning to a more aggressive elements of their post-hardcore style. Burrough saw it as a capturing of energy that their previous two albums lacked and so wanted to write music more &quot;direct and in your face.&quot; In the band&#x27;s opinion they had always wanted to return to their hardcore punk roots. However, it has also been noted that &quot;Welcome Home Armageddon&quot; incorporates more pop rock inspired hooks and melodies, the album&#x27;s more melodic approach is credited in songs like &quot;Old Hymns&quot;. The band and critics alike have said that because they released the two on indie labels they had more creative freedom from when they were signed to Atlantic Records. When &quot;Welcome Home Armageddon&quot; came out, critics were quick to compare and contrast it to &quot;Casually Dressed &amp; Deep in Conversation&quot;.

Their final album &quot;Chapter and Verse&quot; was described by &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; writer Gareth O&#x27;Malley as being &quot;cut from similar cloth to its predecessor&quot;.

===Lyrical themes===
Funeral for a Friend&#x27;s lyrical themes, primarily written by Davies-Kreye, center around personal and emotional experiences. The first album &quot;Casually Dressed and Deep in Conversation&quot; was focused on a disintegrating relationship, while the second album &quot;Hours&quot; was more &quot;extroverted&quot; in its direction, additionally discussing &quot;war, fiscal abuse, alcohol abuse, people not giving a shit&quot;.

===Legacy===
Funeral for a Friend has been said to be a prominent influence on the British post-hardcore scene, primarily with their debut album &quot;Casually Dressed &amp; Deep in Conversation&quot;, a release which is believed by some to have set a high standard for the band to rival in future releases. James Ding of AbsolutePunk stated that: &quot;...the album still stands tall atop of many recent releases due to the quality of the music on offer, and even though FFAF may have strayed from the style that started their career, this is still a landmark album in modern British rock music&quot;. In April 2011, Rock Sound magazine inducted &quot;Casually Dressed &amp; Deep in Conversation&quot; into Rock Sound&#x27;s Hall of Fame, crediting the album as an influence on albums by bands like: Fightstar, The Blackout, Kids in Glass Houses and We Are the Ocean. Blood Youth have cited their work as an influence.

<text>Miron Cozma (born August 25, 1954) is a former Romanian labor-union organizer and politician, and leader of Romania&#x27;s Jiu Valley coal miners&#x27; union. He is best known for his leading the miners of the Jiu Valley during the September 1991 Mineriad which overthrew the reformist Petre Roman government. Cozma was a controversial character in the 1990s, both within and outside of Jiu Valley.

In 2011, he re-entered in politics and founded Worker&#x27;s Social Democratic Party, after he was vicepresident of the Greater Romania Party during the 1990s.

== Early life ==
Born in Derna, Bihor, Miron Cozma studied to become an electromechanical assistant engineer. After graduation, he began working as a trainee at the Bărbăteni Mine, while living in Lupeni. He was also the DJ of the town&#x27;s disco. In 1977, he became an informant for the Securitate, using the code name &quot;Paul&quot;, sending memos about co-workers until 1983.

== Trade union leadership==

In 1990, Cozma was working at the Lonea Coal Mine, being involved in the January 1990 Mineriad, when he was one of the 16 miners who were involved in talks with President Iliescu and the prime minister. On 21–24 March 1990, the League of Miners Unions of the Jiu Valley elected Cozma as its leader.

In 1991, Cozma&#x27;s companies gained a monopoly in food retail in the mines of the Jiu Valley, which gave him substantial profits and influence.

On 19 June 1991, Cozma ran over and killed a 31-year-old woman, Roza Violeta Drăghici, in the village of Paroșeni, Vulcan, Hunedoara, doing an irregular overtaking. He was convicted of manslaughter and given a 2-years suspended sentence; the lenient sentence may have been caused by the close relationship of Cozma with the ruling National Salvation Front.

== 1999 Mineriads and imprisonment ==

In January 1999, Cozma led another series of miner protests, sparked by the Radu Vasile government&#x27;s intention to close down several money-losing mines in the Jiu Valley region. Intending to put pressure on the government, Cozma and his miners started marching towards Bucharest. The mineriad was openly supported by the Greater Romania Party (PRM) and by the president of this party, Corneliu Vadim Tudor, who invited the miners to occupy the Romanian Parliament and to topple the government. Miron Cozma, the leader of the miners, was also vice-president of the PRM, being in constant contact with the PRM leadership in Bucharest, which was preparing the arrival of miners in the Romanian capital. The miners clashed with the Gendarmerie at Costeşti, Vâlcea County; about 70 miners and 100 gendarmes were wounded and one miner died. Soon after, Prime Minister Radu Vasile held talks with Cozma at the Cozia Monastery, and Cozma agreed to end the protest and disband the miner units.

At the beginning of February of the same year, however, Cozma was sentenced by the Supreme Court of Justice to 18 years in prison for his involvement in the 1991 mineriad. This quickly prompted a new march of the miners towards Bucharest. This time, special forces intervened and dispersed the miners at Stoeneşti, Olt County. Cozma and his lieutenants were captured by the police; Cozma himself was taken to the Rahova prison to serve his term.

He was pardoned by Romanian President Ion Iliescu on December 15, 2004, only a few days before the end of the latter&#x27;s final term in office. However, Iliescu revoked the pardon on December 16, stating that &quot;it was a mistake&quot;. Yet Cozma was released in June 2005, when the cancellation of his pardon was ruled illegal by the Bucharest Court of Appeal. In September 2005, he was sentenced by the Romanian Supreme Court to a 10-year term for the January 1999 Mineriad. His sentences overlapped, so as of June 2006 he still had to serve a 13-month concurrent sentence in prison.

On June 2, 2006, Miron Cozma&#x27;s request to be released on parole was denied by the Parole Commission of the Rahova Penitentiary. A Bucharest court dismissed his appeal against the decision 2 weeks later.

Cozma could have left the prison 6 months before time as recommended by the Parole Commission on January 3, 2007. Although the decision was upheld by a Bucharest court on January 9, it was overturned on appeal on February 20, 2007.

Miron Cozma was finally released on 2 December 2007, with a restriction on entering Petroşani or Bucharest. Upon leaving Rahova, he flew to Timişoara to meet with his family and friends. He stated in his interviews that certain politicians should have been incarcerated as well, adding &quot;Spiritul lui Miron Cozma nu moare!&quot; (&quot;The soul of Miron Cozma will never die!&quot;).

In June 2013, Miron Cozma claimed during an interview that the Army had used live rounds against miners.

<doc id="1285208" wikidata="Q714931" url="?curid=1285208" title="William of Gellone">
<text>William of Gellone ( 755 – 28 May 812 or 814), the medieval William of Orange, was the second Duke of Toulouse from 790 until 811. In 804, he founded the abbey of Gellone. He was canonized a saint in 1066 by Pope Alexander II.

In the tenth or eleventh century, a Latin hagiography, the &quot;Vita sancti Willelmi&quot;, was composed. By the twelfth century, William&#x27;s legend had grown. He is the hero of an entire cycle of &quot;chansons de geste&quot;, the earliest of which is the &quot;Chanson de Guillaume&quot; of about 1140. In the &quot;chansons&quot;, he is nicknamed &quot;Fièrebrace&quot; (fierce or strong arm) due to his apparent strength and the &quot;marquis au court nez&quot; (margrave with the short nose) as the result of an injury suffered in battle with a giant.

==William in history==
William was born in northern France in the mid-8th century, to Thierry IV, Count of Autun, and his wife Aldana. He was a relative of Charlemagne. The relationship is speculated to have come through William&#x27;s mother, perhaps a daughter of Charles Martel, or through Thierry, apparently a close kinsman of Charlemagne&#x27;s maternal great-grandmother (Bertrada of Prüm), with the two relationships not mutually exclusive. As a kinsman and trusted &quot;comes&quot;, he spent his youth in the court of Charlemagne. In 788, Chorso, Count of Toulouse, was captured by the Basque Adalric, and made to swear an oath of allegiance to the Duke of Gascony, Lupus II. Upon his release Charlemagne replaced him with his Frankish cousin William (790). William, in turn, successfully subdued the Gascons.

In 793, Hisham I, the successor of Abd ar-Rahman I, proclaimed a holy war against the Christians to the north. He amassed an army of 100,000 men, half of which attacked the Kingdom of Asturias while the other half invaded Languedoc, penetrating as far as Narbonne.

William met this force and defeated them. He met the Muslim forces again near the river Orbieu at Villedaigne but was defeated, though his obstinate resistance exhausted the Muslim forces so much that they retreated to Hispania. In 801, William commanded along with Louis, King of Aquitaine a large expedition of Franks, Burgundians, Provençals, Aquitanians, Gascons (Basques) and Goths that captured Barcelona from the Ummayads.

In 804, he founded the abbey in Gellone (now Saint-Guilhem-le-Désert) near Lodève in the diocese of Maguelonne. He granted property to Gellone and placed the monastery under the general control of Benedict of Aniane, whose monastery was nearby. Among his gifts to the abbey he founded was a piece of the True Cross, a present from his cousin Charlemagne. Charlemagne had received the relic from the Patriarch of Jerusalem according to the &quot;Vita&quot; of William.

In 806, William retired to Gellone as a monk and eventually died there on 28 May 812 (or 814). When he died, it was said the bells at Orange rang on their own accord.

William mentioned both his family and monastery in his will: his will of 28 January 804, names his wives Cunegonde and Witburgis, his deceased parents, Theodoric/Thierry and Aldana, two brothers, Theodino and Adalelmo, two sisters, Abbana and Bertana, four children, Barnard, Witcher, Gotzelm and Helimburgis, and a nephew, Bertrano. In addition, he had a son Heribert, a daughter Gerberge, and perhaps a daughter Rotlinde.

Gellone remained under the control of the abbots of Aniane. It became a subject of contention, however, as the reputation of William grew. So many pilgrims were attracted to Gellone that his corpse was exhumed from the modest site in the narthex and given a more prominent place under the choir, to the intense dissatisfaction of the Abbey of Aniane. A number of forged documents and assertions were produced on each side that leave details of actual history doubtful. The abbey was a major stop for pilgrims on their way to Santiago de Compostela. Its late-12th-century Romanesque cloister, systematically dismantled during the French Revolution, found its way to The Cloisters in New York. The &quot;Sacramentary of Gellone&quot;, dating to the late 8th century, is a famous manuscript.

==William in romance==
William&#x27;s faithful service to Charlemagne is portrayed as an example of feudal loyalty. William&#x27;s career battling Saracens is sung in epic poems in the 12th- and 13th-century cycle called &quot;La Geste de Garin de Monglane&quot;, some two dozen &quot;chansons de geste&quot; that actually center around William, the great-grandson of the largely legendary Garin.

One section of the cycle, however, is devoted to the feats of his father, there named Aymeri de Narbonne, who has received Narbonne as his seigniory after his return from Spain with Charlemagne. Details of the &quot;Aymeri&quot; of the poem are conflated with a later historic figure who was truly the viscount of Narbonne from 1108 to 1134. In the &quot;chanson&quot; he is awarded Ermengart, daughter of Didier, and sister of Boniface, king of the Lombards. Among his seven sons and five daughters (one of whom marries Louis the Pious) is William.

The defeat of the Moors at Orange was given legendary treatment in the 12th-century epic &quot;La Prise d&#x27;Orange&quot;. There, he was made Count of Toulouse in the stead of the disgraced Chorso, then King of Aquitaine in 778. He is difficult to separate from the legends and poems that gave him feats of arms, lineage and titles: Guillaume Fièrebras, Guillaum au Court-Nez (broken in a battle with a giant), Guillaum de Narbonne and Guillaume d&#x27;Orange. These legends turn his wife into a converted Saracen, Orable, later christened Guibourc.

<doc id="1285210" wikidata="Q2659229" url="?curid=1285210" title="Czech nobility">
<text>Czech nobility consists of the noble families from historical Czech lands, especially in their narrow sense, i.e. nobility of Bohemia proper, Moravia and Austrian Silesia – whether these families originated from those countries or moved into them through the centuries. These are connected with the history of Great Moravia, Duchy of Bohemia, later Kingdom of Bohemia, Margraviate of Moravia, the Duchies of Silesia and the Crown of Bohemia, the constitutional predecessor state of the modern-day Czech Republic.

Noble titles were abolished by law (No. 61/1918 Sb. z. a n.) in December 1918, shortly after the establishment of the independent Czechoslovak Republic. During the period of Nazism and communism, representatives of Czech noble families were often persecuted. After the Velvet Revolution in 1989, the property confiscated by the communists was returned to the nobility.

== History ==
The beginnings of the Czech nobility can be seen in the time of the first Přemyslid princes and kings, i.e. in the 9th century. As a legally defined state of nobility in the Czech lands, it arose in the course of the 13th century, when members of noble families began to own newly built stone castles. The influence of the nobility rose rapidly, which became the cause of a strained relationship between the king and the nobility during the last Přemyslid kings and especially during the reign of John of Bohemia and his grandson, Wenceslaus IV at the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries.
After the burning of Jan Hus in 1415, Czech society and therefore the Czech nobility was divided into two groups - Catholic and Hussite (later Protestant). Both groups were at war with each other both during the Hussite Wars and long after them. After the end of the Hussite Wars and the rule of the Luxembourgers in the 1530s, the country was controlled by various noble associations. In 1452, they agreed on a land administrator, who became the noble George of Poděbrady. Five years later he was elected King of Bohemia, but disputes between the Catholic and Protestant nobility continued until the outbreak of the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1618. 

The status of the nobility further increased in 1500, when the Vladislav land constitution was issued. In 1526, Ferdinand I of Habsburg was elected King of Bohemia. He, along with his successors, tried to reduce the influence of the nobility. This process was interrupted during the reign of Rudolf II in the years 1576-1611. In 1618, the Protestant part of the Czech estates started the Bohemian Revolt by throwing imperial officials out of the windows of Prague Castle. Czech Protestants were defeated in the Battle of White Mountain in 1620, and the following year 27 leaders of this rebellion were executed. Thus, the Catholic aristocracy definitively won over the Protestant aristocracy in Bohemia, but at the same time the absolutist monarchy won over the estate monarchy.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War after the Battle of White Mountain, a large part of the Protestant nobility had their property confiscated. Many new noble families came to the Czech lands at this time, originally usually from Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria or Scotland. Of the old Czech noble families, for example, the Kinsky, Sternberg, Kolowrat, Czernin, Lobkowitz, Pernštejn or Lichtenstein families remained in Bohemia, while the Eggenberg, Bucquoy, Colloredo-Mannsfeld, Gallas, Piccolomini, Schwarzenberg and others arrived.

From the 17th century, only the Catholic Czech nobility significantly participated in the functioning of the Habsburg Monarchy. Newly arrived families gradually identified with the Czech lands and often also with the Czech language. At the end of the 18th century, a period called Josephinism began. His representative, the Emperor and King Joseph II (1780-1790), initiated extensive reforms that significantly changed the position of the nobility and reduced the number of aristocratic privileges. Part of the modernization of the country was also the prioritization of German at the expense of Czech (the purpose was more efficient state administration).

During the 19th century, the Czech nobility was significantly involved in the process of national revival, the promotion of the Czech language and the emergence of modern Czech culture and society. Prominent representatives of the patriotic nobility were especially the Sternberg, Chotek, Schwarzenberg, Czernin, Kolowrat, Kinsky and Lobkowitz. In the second half of the 19th century, representatives of these and other families became involved in emerging parliamentary activity. The patriotically oriented nobles founded the Party of the Conservative Estate, cooperating with the Old Czech Party, another aristocratic political force was the Party of the Constitutionalist Estate. In the second half of the 19th century, the ranks of the Czech nobility were expanded by successful businessmen, politicians and artists, for example the Bartoň family, the founder of the Škoda Works Emil Škoda, the industrialist František Rienghoffer, the leader of the Old Czech Party František Ladislav Rieger, the composer Antonín Dvořák and the writer Jaroslav Vrchlický. The representatives of this so-called new nobility, however, usually remained outside the Czech aristocracy.

After the First World War, the monarchy disappeared in the Czech lands and a republic was established. Most of the Czech nobility held monarchist positions, but remained loyal to the newly established Czechoslovak Republic. Some nobles even entered the service of the Czechoslovak Republic and worked in diplomacy (for example, representatives of the Lobkowitz, Schwarzenberg and others). The Czechoslovak Republic confiscated the property of the Habsburgs and Hohenbergs, and the Clam-Martinic family also lost their property. During the following years, the property was sold off and the Fürstenbergs, for example, left the country. 

The turning point occurred in 1938. In response to the direct threat to the democratic state by Nazi Germany, the most important noble families issued a Declaration of the members of the old Czech families on the inviolability of the territory of the Czech state. During the audience with President Edvard Beneš, members of the Schwarzenberg, Lobkowitz, Kinsky, Kolowrat, Czernin, Sternberg, Colloredo-Mannsfeld, Parish, Dobrzenský, Strachwitz, and Belcredi publicly joined him. A similar statement was issued a year later, already in the occupied Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. In September 1939, the National Declaration of the Czech Nobility was drawn up, in which 85 of the most important Czech noblemen from 33 noble families declared their Czech nationality. The Nazis subsequently confiscated the property of these nobles, and some then lived through the war in house internment or in concentration camps. Some nobles managed to emigrate. Part of the nobles actively participated in the domestic resistance, for example the Bořek-Dohalský brothers were murdered in a concentration camp, Karel VI Schwarzenberg or Václav Norbert Kinský participated in the anti-Nazi uprising in 1945.

In 1945, the properties of most Czech noble families were returned. However, there was a deportation of the majority of the population of German nationality, in which both the nobles who collaborated with the Nazis and the nobles who did not collaborate with the Nazis, but only claimed German nationality before the war, lost their property. For example, Trauttmansdorff, Windischgrätz, Clam-Gallas, Thurn-Taxis, Desfours, or one branch of the Kinsky, Czernin and Rohan families had to leave the Czech lands. Due to the growing influence of the communists in Czechoslovakia in the years 1945-1948, the return of some property was also withheld (the Colloredo-Mannsfeld case), or the unjust confiscation of the primogeniture property of the Schwarzenberg family (based on the Lex Schwarzenberg Act of 1947). The Liechtenstein family is still suing the Czech Republic for seized property, as well as several other families labeled as Germans after the war.

In 1948, there was a communist coup in Czechoslovakia. Subsequently, the property of all noble families was confiscated. A large part of the Czech nobility therefore emigrated (for example, the Schwarzenberg, Colloredo-Mannsfelds, Kolowrat, Hildprand, some Lobkowitz or Sternberg). The nobles who stayed at home (such as the Kinsky, Wratislav, Czernin, some Sternberg and Lobkowitz) were variously persecuted, for example they were prevented from studying, usually they were also evicted to unsuitable dwellings. Some members of the Czech nobility were imprisoned.

After the Velvet Revolution in 1989, properties seized by the communist regime were returned to their original owners. Members of the Czech nobility who emigrated abroad returned to their estates. Some subsequently returned to public life (for example, Karel Schwarzenberg as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Member of Parliament and Senator, Michal Lobkowitz as Minister of Defense and Member of Parliament, Tomáš Czernin as Senator). Other Czech nobles devote themselves, for example, to business, culture, science, the church, or knightly orders.

<text>Patrick Manning Kerney (born December 30, 1976) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive end for 11 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Virginia Cavaliers in Charlottesville and was selected by the Atlanta Falcons in the first round of the 1999 NFL draft with the 30th overall pick.

==Early life==
A native of Trenton, New Jersey, Patrick Kerney enrolled in the Taft School (CT) his sophomore, junior, and senior years after attending Princeton Day School. At Taft, Patrick Kerney was a starter in football and a two-year letterman in wrestling. Initially viewed by his coach to be too scrawny to play football, Patrick Kerney eventually became team captain and was selected Most Valuable Player while recording three sacks, one blocked punt, one interception and 84 tackles in just eight games as a junior. Pat had seven sacks as a sophomore defensive end. In wrestling, Pat placed second at the All-New England tournament as a senior. Princeton Day School named their new fitness center in honor of Patrick Kerney. The center has his signed uniform and features his number on the floor. The &quot;Patrick Kerney &#x27;94 Fitness Center&quot; opened in 2007.

==College career==
Patrick Kerney received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Virginia, where Pat played for coach George Welsh&#x27;s Virginia Cavaliers football team from 1997 to 1999. Pat amassed 127 tackles and 24 sacks in his three-year college career. His 24 career sacks ranks third in Virginia history. As a junior in 1997, Pat made 45 tackles and registered eight sacks. In his senior year in 1998, Pat recorded 62 tackles and 15 sacks and helped lead the 1998 Cavaliers to a 9–3 overall record, a trip to the Peach Bowl, and a final ranking of 18th in both the Associated Press and USA Today/CNN polls. The 15 sacks led the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), ranked second in the nation, and tied the Virginia record set by Chris Slade in 1992. &quot;Football News&quot; and the Football Writers Association named Patty a first-team All-American at defensive end. Pat also earned first-team All-ACC honors. The Associated Press and &quot;The Sporting News&quot; selected Patty as a second-team All-American. Patrick Kerney finished second in balloting for the 1998 ACC Defensive Player of the Year by one vote to fellow Cavalier All-American Anthony Poindexter. Pat was also one of five finalists for the Bronko Nagurski Award, given annually by the Football Writers Association to the nation&#x27;s best defensive player. Pat finished second in the ACC and 10th nationally with 21 tackles for loss.

Patrick Kerney was originally recruited to play lacrosse and Pat was a defenseman on the Virginia lacrosse team in 1996 and 1997. Pat was a member of the 1996 Cavalier squad that advanced to the NCAA championship game and lost to Princeton 13–12 in overtime. Patrick Kerney was also a member of the 1997 team that made it to the NCAA playoffs and lost to Maryland in the quarterfinals 10–9. Pat did not participate in 1996 spring football practice in order to compete on the lacrosse team.

On November 13, 2010, Patrick Kerney had his #58 jersey retired by the University of Virginia.

==Professional career==
===Pre-draft===
===Atlanta Falcons===
Patrick Kerney was drafted as the 30th overall pick in the 1999 NFL draft by the Atlanta Falcons, wearing the number 97 jersey. The Falcons signed Patrick Kerney to a 5-year $5.6 million contract. As a rookie, Patrick Kerney started two games (one at left defensive end and one a left defensive tackle) and recorded 25 tackles and 2.5 sacks. In 2000, Kerney was the starting left defensive end and again recorded 2.5 sacks.

In 2001, Kerney recorded 12 sacks. Early in the 2002 season, the Falcons agreed to a seven-year contract extension with him. The deal, which could be voided after five seasons, included a team-record $8.5 million signing bonus. It could have been worth up to $40 million if all incentives were met. Kerney finished the 2002 season with 10.5 sacks while playing left defensive end in a 3-4 defense. He remained at that position in 2003 and recorded 6.5 sacks.

In 2004 the Falcons returned to a 4-3 defense and Patrick Kerney responded with his best season up until that time, playing the Pro Bowl for the first time and recording career-highs in tackles (66), sacks (13) and passes defensed (9). Pat was also voted second-team All-Pro by the Associated Press.

In 2006, Kerney moved to right defensive end as a starter and moved to left defensive end in passing situations (newly acquired free agent John Abraham played right defensive end in those situations). In Week 9, Kerney&#x27;s 105-game starting streak came to an end, with a torn right pectoral muscle that required surgery. (He was injured while tackling Cleveland Browns tight end Steve Heiden.) The seven games Kerney missed were the only games that he missed in his career. In Kerney&#x27;s absence, John Abraham was the starter at right defensive end.

===Seattle Seahawks===
On February 23, 2007, Kerney opted out the last two years of his contract with the Atlanta Falcons to become an unrestricted free agent. On March 5, he signed a six-year, $39.5 million contract with the Seahawks that included $19.5 million in guaranteed money.

With the Seahawks in 2007, he was voted as a starter in the Pro Bowl and led the NFC in sacks with 14.5 (which set a new career-high for Kerney). Kerney also had a career-high 5 forced fumbles and recorded 62 tackles. He missed the Pro Bowl due to shoulder surgery.

On April 13, 2010, Kerney announced his retirement.

===NFL statistics===
==Personal life==
Patrick is one of six children. He has four sisters and had a brother who died when Patrick was a child. When he first entered the NFL, he set up a foundation in name of his brother called the Lt. Thomas L. Kerney Endowment Fund. The fund provides college scholarships and financial assistance to children of fallen police officers. Kerney donated $1000 per sack he recorded to the foundation. He is married to former Sportscenter anchor Lisa Kerney and has been accepted to Columbia Business School&#x27;s MBA program beginning in the fall of 2010.

<text>Badarayana (IAST Bādarāyaṇa; Devanāgari बादरायण) was an Indian philosopher and sage who was the reputed author of the &quot;Brahma Sutras.&quot; The Brahma Sutras is a source text for the Hindu philosophical school of Vedānta and one of three texts along with the Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita which establish the prasthantrayi. Estimates of his lifetime vary very widely from around fifth century BCE to third or fourth century CE.

His work &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot; is variously dated from 500 BCE to 450 CE. The Brahma Sutras of Bādarāyana, also called the &quot;Vedanta Sutra&quot;, was compiled in its present form around 400–450 CE, but &quot;the great part of the &quot;Sutra&quot; must have been in existence much earlier than that&quot;.

Bādarāyana is regarded as having written the basic text of the Vedanta system, the &quot;Vedāntasūtra&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Brahmasūtra&quot;. He is thus considered the founder of the Vedānta system of philosophy.

<text>The Jeker (; , ) is a river in Belgium and in the Netherlands. It is a left-bank tributary to the river Meuse. The source of the Jeker is near the village of Geer, in the Belgian province of Liège. The river is approximately long, of which about is in Belgium (provinces of Liège and Limburg) and in the Netherlands (province of Limburg), where it flows into the river Meuse at Maastricht (Netherlands).

Places through which the Jeker passes include Waremme, Tongeren, Kanne, (all three in Belgium) and Maastricht.

==Recreational aspect==

Rafting on the Jeker is an entertaining recreational activity. Beginning in Kanne, it is possible to raft into the city of Maastricht on this relaxing river. The water flow is best in mid-autumn and spring. Obstacles may be present when the water is low. The trip from Kanne to Maastricht takes about two hours and crosses the border between Belgium and the Netherlands.

<doc id="1285228" wikidata="Q1282131" url="?curid=1285228" title="Egotism">
<text>Egotism is defined as the drive to maintain and enhance favorable views of oneself and generally features an inflated opinion of one&#x27;s personal features and importance distinguished by a person&#x27;s amplified vision of one&#x27;s self and self-importance. It often includes intellectual, physical, social, and other overestimations. The egotist has an overwhelming sense of the centrality of the &quot;me&quot; regarding their personal qualities.

==Characteristics==
Egotism is closely related to an egocentric love for one&#x27;s imagined self or narcissism. Egotists have a strong tendency to talk about themselves in a self-promoting fashion, and they may well be arrogant and boastful with a grandiose sense of their own importance. Their inability to recognise the accomplishments of others leaves them profoundly self-promoting; while sensitivity to criticism may lead, on the egotist&#x27;s part, to narcissistic rage at a sense of insult.

Egotism differs from both altruism – or behaviour motivated by the concern for others rather than for oneself – and from egoism, the constant pursuit of one&#x27;s self-interest. Various forms of &quot;empirical egoism&quot; have been considered consistent with egotism, but do not – which is also the case with egoism in general – necessitate having an inflated sense of self.

==Development==
In developmental terms, two different paths can be taken to reach egotism – one being individual, and the other being cultural.

With respect to the developing individual, a movement takes place from egocentricity to sociality during the process of growing up. It is normal for an infant to have an inflated sense of egotism. The over-evaluation of one&#x27;s own ego regularly appears in childish forms of love.

Optimal development allows a gradual decrease into a more realistic view of one&#x27;s own place in the world. A less optimal adjustment may later lead to what has been called defensive egotism, serving to overcompensate for a fragile concept of self. Robin Skynner however considered that in the main growing up leads to a state where &quot;your ego is still there, but it&#x27;s taking its proper limited place among all the other egos&quot;.

However, alongside such a positive trajectory of diminishing &quot;individual&quot; egotism, a rather different arc of development can be noted in cultural terms, linked to what has been seen as the increasing infantilism of post-modern society. Whereas in the nineteenth century egotism was still widely regarded as a traditional vice – for Nathaniel Hawthorne egotism was a sort of diseased self-contemplation – Romanticism had already set in motion a countervailing current, what Richard Eldridge described as a kind of &quot;cultural egotism, substituting the individual imagination for vanishing social tradition&quot;. The romantic idea of the self-creating individual – of a self-authorizing, artistic egotism – then took on broader social dimensions in the following century. Keats might still attack Wordsworth for the regressive nature of his retreat into the egotistical sublime; but by the close of the twentieth century egotism had been naturalized much more widely by the Me generation into the Culture of Narcissism.

In the 21st century, romantic egotism has been seen as feeding into techno-capitalism in two complementary ways: on the one hand, through the self-centred consumer, focused on their own self-fashioning through brand &#x27;identity&#x27;; on the other through the equally egotistical voices of &#x27;authentic&#x27; protest, as they rage against the machine, only to produce new commodity forms that serve to fuel the system for further consumption.

==Sexuality==
There is a question mark over the relationship between sexuality and egotism. Sigmund Freud popularly made the claim that intimacy can transform the egotist, giving a new sense of humility in relation to others.

At the same time, it is very apparent that egotism can readily show itself in sexual ways and indeed arguably one&#x27;s whole sexuality may function in the service of egotistical needs.

== Social egotism ==
Leo Tolstoy, used the term &quot;aduyevschina&quot; (after the protagonist Aduyev of Goncharov&#x27;s first novel, &quot;A Common Story&quot;) to describe social egotism as the inability of some people to see beyond their immediate interests.

==Etymology==
The term egotism is derived from the Greek (&quot;εγώ&quot;) and subsequently its Latinised ego (&quot;ego&quot;), meaning &quot;self&quot; or &quot;I,&quot; and &quot;-ism&quot;, used to denote a system of belief. As such, the term shares early etymology with .

== Egotism vs. pride ==
Egotism differs from pride. Although they share the state of mind of an individual, ego is defined by a person&#x27;s self-perception. That is how the particular individual thinks, feels and distinguishes him/herself from others. Pride may be equated to the feeling one experiences as the direct result of one&#x27;s accomplishment or success.

==Cultural examples==
* A. A. Milne has been praised for his clear-eyed vision of the ruthless, open, unashamed egotism of the young child.
* Ryan Holiday described our cultural values as dependent on validation, entitled, and ruled by our emotions, a form of egotism.

<text>Jon Daniel Runyan (born November 27, 1973) is an American athlete and politician who was the U.S. representative for from 2011 to 2015. He is a member of the Republican Party. Before entering politics, he played football for 14 seasons as an offensive tackle in the National Football League (NFL). He was a participant in the 2003 Pro Bowl following the 2002 NFL season.

He was selected by the Houston Oilers in the fourth round of the 1996 NFL draft and later played for the Philadelphia Eagles and San Diego Chargers. Runyan was the last active NFL player to have played for the Oilers. He played college football for the Michigan Wolverines where he was a 1995 All-Big Ten Conference selection. In high school, he had been an All-State (Michigan) selection in basketball and two-time state champion shot putter. He retired at the end of the 2009 NFL season and launched his campaign for Congress against incumbent freshman Democrat John Adler, winning the general election on November 2, 2010.

On November 6, 2013, Runyan announced he would not seek reelection to Congress in 2014.

On May 17, 2016, the NFL announced they hired Runyan as their Vice President of the Policy and Rules administration.

==Football career==

===Early years===
Runyan was born in Flint, Michigan where his father was an employee of General Motors.

Runyan continues to hold the Flint, Michigan Carman-Ainsworth Middle School shot put record with a 1988 heave of . Runyan was a two-time Michigan High School Athletic Association state shot put champion for Carman-Ainsworth High School (1991 ; 1992 ). He was a 1992 &quot;Detroit News&quot; second-team All-State basketball center. He was recruited by Michigan State men&#x27;s basketball, though he declined in order to play football. He chose to play for the Michigan Wolverines football team where he was an All-Big Ten Conference selection for the 1995 Wolverines.

===Professional===
====Houston/Tennessee Oilers/Titans====
Runyan was selected in the fourth round (109th overall) of the 1996 NFL draft by the Houston Oilers (now the Tennessee Titans). He played with the Houston Oilers in 1996 and became a starter in only the sixth game of his rookie season. He moved with the team as they became the Tennessee Oilers in 1997 and 1998, and finally played one year in the new jerseys as the Tennessee Titans in 1999 when the team made it to Super Bowl XXXIV. Runyan was the last active player in the NFL to have played for the Houston Oilers.

====Philadelphia Eagles====

Runyan was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles to a six-year, $30 million contract on February 14, 2000, as an unrestricted free agent. The contract made him the highest paid offensive lineman in NFL history at the time. Runyan was selected to the Pro Bowl in 2002.

On March 24, 2006, the Eagles announced that Runyan had re-signed with the team with a three-year contract. He had visited with the New York Jets on March 21 prior to re-signing with the Eagles.

In a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine in October 2006, Runyan was ranked second on a list of the Dirtiest Players in the NFL. Bills linebacker Shawne Merriman stated that Runyan &quot;was one of the dirtiest players I&#x27;ve ever been against in my whole entire life. He was real good at being dirty&quot;. Runyan did not deny the charges, criticizing the current game instead: &quot;That&#x27;s the way the game&#x27;s supposed to be played. I think they’ve tried to change that over the years. It&#x27;s turned into a basketball game out there.&quot;

In a 2007 game against the Dallas Cowboys, Runyan instructed Eagles running back Brian Westbrook to take a knee at the one-yard line rather than score a touchdown with two minutes left in the game so that Dallas would not get the ball back. Westbrook followed Runyan&#x27;s direction, the play worked, and Philadelphia won the game.

A 2008 poll revealed that getting blocked by Runyan on a screen pass was one of the scariest things in the NFL.

Runyan held the remarkable streak for an offensive lineman of having started 190 consecutive regular season games. This was the second longest streak among active NFL players in 2008. He has also started in all 18 playoff games his teams have appeared in during this streak.

On January 28, 2009, Runyan had microfacture surgery on his right knee. In February 2009, Runyan&#x27;s contract expired with the team. He worked out for the Eagles on September 10, but did not sign a contract. He was signed by the San Diego Chargers, playing in five games before retiring.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;2010
In November 2009, published reports indicated Runyan was interested in running for Congress. On November 24, 2009, Runyan announced his congressional bid to challenge one-term Democratic incumbent John Adler for , which included parts of Burlington, Camden and Ocean Counties. Libertarian nominee Russ Conger and Your Country Again nominee Lawrence J. Donahue were also running. Even though he now played for the Chargers, he maintained a home in Mount Laurel, across the Delaware River from Philadelphia (and which coincidentally also happens to be home to the headquarters of NFL Films). On March 7, 2010, the Ocean County Republicans endorsed Runyan. On June 8, Runyan won the Republican nomination.
On November 2, 2010, Runyan defeated Adler 50%–47%, becoming the first challenger to unseat an incumbent New Jersey Congressman since Rush Holt in 1998. He lost the Burlington and Camden portions of the district, but carried solidly Republican Ocean County by nearly 20,000 votes, far exceeding his overall winning margin of over 6,000 votes. Runyan is the fourth former NFL player to be elected to Congress, after Jack Kemp, Steve Largent, and Heath Shuler.

;2012
Runyan was re-elected, defeating attorney Shelley Adler, the widow of John Adler (who intended to run in a rematch, but died suddenly in April 2011). Shelley Adler had defeated Jason Sansone for the Democratic nomination. Runyan won 54% of the vote, to Adler&#x27;s 45%.

;2014
Runyan announced that he would not seek re-election, after expressing frustration with his fellow Republicans over the government shutdown.

===Tenure===
Over the course of his tenure, Runyan sponsored 15 pieces of legislation. Like most New Jersey Republicans, he was considered moderate relative to the national party. He voted with the Republican party 92% of the time. Key votes he supported included the payroll tax cut, the Balanced budget amendment, defunding of National Public Radio, and the Republican budget plan.

In June 2013, Runyan was one of the sponsors to pass an amendment to H.R. 2217, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2014, which increased the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) Grants, and the Assistance to Firefighter Grants (FIRE) by $2.5 million each.

On November 6, 2013, Runyan announced he would not seek reelection in 2014.

<text>The Maryland Conservation Council (MCC) is a coalition of environmental organizations that has been active since the early 1970s. MCC aims to protect the environment in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, with special attention to Maryland. During the Maryland General Assembly legislative session (January through April each year), MCC publishes a weekly legislative update, &quot;Conservation Reports.&quot; One of MCC&#x27;s earliest projects involved the protection of Cove Point in Calvert County, Maryland, which resulted in the formation of Cove Point Natural Heritage Trust.

The MCC&#x27;s Goals are to protect
*Scenic wild rivers and Appalachian hardwood forests in the Allegheny Plateau of Western Maryland; 
*Sandy beaches on the barrier islands of the Atlantic Ocean with productive yet fragile bays behind them; 
*Cypress swamps along an ancient black water river and vast wetlands providing winter habitat for migrating waterfowl on the Coastal Plain of the Eastern Shore; 
*Geologically significant features and species rich forests and rivers in the Piedmont; 
*The Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries which once produced vast quantities of aquatic resources.

Conservationists today are faced with a serious dilemma. They are certain that the use of fossil fuels is leading toward a global catastrophe. But at the same time they are increasingly aware that many types of renewable energy, because of the large amount of land that they require, will have a seriously detrimental impact on the natural world, especially if their use expands.

The MCC has concluded that nuclear energy, which produces no carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases, (1) also has a smaller footprint or impact on biological diversity compared to wind, solar, or biomass; in some cases, orders of magnitude smaller. When cost is stripped of various forms of governmental assistance, and the actual, not theoretical, effectiveness is used to calculate the size of the installation needed to generate a given amount of electricity, nuclear power is the least expensive.

The MCC has also concluded that commercial reactors of the type now used in the United States have a sound safety record, even considering the accident at Three Mile Island (TMI), and that there is no credible evidence that there has been harm to health by these reactors. MCC further concluded that the hazards of transporting used nuclear fuel have been badly exaggerated, and that recent proposals about the storage of used fuel will reduce the technological difficulty of construction a long-term repository.

The MCC&#x27;s Board voted at its November 2007 meeting to support Constellation Energy Group’s proposal to build a third nuclear reactor at its Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant in Charles County.

<doc id="1285249" wikidata="Q7280455" url="?curid=1285249" title="Radical Routes">
<text>Radical Routes is a UK-based network of housing co-ops. The organisation supports new and established co-ops through loan finance, training workshops, practical support, and national gatherings.

==History==
Radical Routes emerged in 1986 from a network of people in London and Hull who wanted to develop workers&#x27; co-operatives. The network agreed its common aims and adopted the name Radical Routes in 1988, and became incorporated as Radical Routes Limited in 1992. In 1998 Rootstock Limited was incorporated as an investment scheme supporting Radical Routes co-operatives. The original house in Hockley was set up as the &#x27;New Education Housing Co-op&#x27;.

According to Rootstock, between 1991 and 2012 Radical Routes made over sixty loans to member co-ops – totaling over £1m – with no co-operatives defaulting on loan payments. These loans have typically been used by member housing co-ops, in addition to finance from traditional lenders, to buy property.

==Work==
Radical Routes provides small loans (up to about £50,000) to member co-operatives. Decisions on making loans are made collectively by other member co-operatives, this has been described as &quot;peer-group loan appraisal&quot;.

Radical Routes publishes booklets on subjects such as How to set up a Housing Co-operative and How to set up a Worker Co-operative.

With Cooperatives UK they launched proposals for an independent co-operative regulator after the government announced that it would be abolishing the FSA. Previously the FSA had regulated co-operatives, which were registered as industrial and provident societies.

Radical Routes is developing a ‘co-op cluster’ model for co-op housing with groups of housing co-ops combining their assets to buy new properties outright, eliminating mortgage interest.

==Membership==
Member co-operatives are expected to commit to a share of Radical Routes&#x27; workload as volunteers, and work toward radical social change.

At January 2024 the organisation has 30 members: 26 housing co-ops and 4 worker co-ops.

==Limitations==
A 2014 round table report by Radical Routes and Friends Provident Foundation identified carpet bagging, among other things, as a systemic weakness within the existing housing co-op framework. &#x27;Carpet bagging&#x27; refers to established co-ops significantly reducing their rents or, rarely, selling their property for private gain. The report explores ways in which the systematic weaknesses might be addressed, mentioning the &quot;Mietshäuser Syndikat&quot; model as having provably solved the carpet bagging issue.

<doc id="1285252" wikidata="Q1211214" url="?curid=1285252" title="Lamphun">
<text>Lamphun (, ) is a town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) in northern Thailand, capital of Lamphun Province. It covers the whole &quot;tambon&quot; Nai Mueang of Mueang Lamphun district. As of 2006 it has a population of 14,030. Lamphun lies north of Bangkok and south of Chiang Mai.
==History==
Lamphun was founded by Queen Chama Thevi as the capital of the Haripunchai Kingdom, the last and most northerly Mon kingdom in the area which now forms Thailand. Around south of Chiang Mai, it was constructed in the shape of a conch shell, following the Khuang River on its east side and divided by moats at the remaining points of the compass.

Queen Chama Thevi is remembered in the wat of her name, which is said to be the resting place of her ashes. Near the town&#x27;s main morning market in the south-west of the city is a statue of the queen at which offerings are still made today by citizens.

While still living in the north King Mangrai was visited by some merchants from the Mon Kingdom, and hearing of the wealth of Lamphun he determined to conquer it, even against the advice of his councillors.

As it was deemed impossible to take the city by force, he sent a skillful merchant called Ai Fa to gain the confidence of the King Yi Ba, and in time he became the chief minister and managed to undermine the king&#x27;s authority.

In 1281, with the people in a state of discontent, Mangrai defeated the Mon Kingdom, and added the city and its wealth to his kingdom, while Yi Ba, the last king of Hariphunchai, was forced to flee south to Lampang. Lamphun was then incorporated into the new Lanna Kingdom. Ai Fa was subsequently appointed king, and King Mangrai began building the fortress Wiang Kum Kam as his new capital.

Lamphun is host to one of northern Thailand&#x27;s most important temples, Wat Phra That Hariphunchai, featured on the reverse of the one-satang coin. The &quot;phra that&quot; in the title indicates the presence of a Buddha relic, in this case one of his hairs, which was interred in the chedi in 897, which is probably the founding date of the wat.

The town is surrounded by lush countryside punctuated by rice fields and orchards of the popular fruit, longan, which is celebrated in a festival every August.

==Geography==
The town is in the Ping River valley, between the Thanon Thong Chai Range on the west and the Khun Tan Range in the east.

<text>A Palestinian suicide bombing at a pizzeria in downtown Jerusalem on 9 August 2001 killed 16 people, including seven children and a pregnant woman. A further 130 were wounded. The attack occurred during the Second Intifada.

==Attack==
At the time of the bombing, the Jerusalem branch of the Sbarro pizza restaurant chain was located at the corner of King George Street and Jaffa Road in Jerusalem, one of the busiest pedestrian crossings in the region. Although not required to do so, owner Noam Amar added extra support columns on the advice of city inspectors.

Ahlam Tamimi, who was charged as an accomplice, scouted for a target before leading Izz al-Din Shuheil al-Masri, the suicide bomber, to the Sbarro restaurant. They arrived just before 2:00 p.m., when the restaurant was filled with customers, &quot;dozens of women, children and babies&quot;, and pedestrian traffic outside was at its peak. Tamimi departed before Al-Masri, thought to be carrying a rigged guitar case or wearing an explosive belt weighing five to 10 kilograms, containing explosives, nails, nuts and bolts, detonated his bomb.

Chaviv Avrahami, who saw the scene of the attack after the bombing, recounted: &quot;I heard a tremendous explosion, and I was thrown up a metre into the air. I knew immediately that it was a bomb attack, and a catastrophic one. There were people – babies – thrown through the window and covered with blood. The whole street was covered with blood and bodies: the dead and the dying.&quot; Naor Shara, a soldier who witnessed the attack, said, &quot;The worst thing I saw, which I think will haunt me all my life, is a baby that was sitting in a stroller outside a shop and was dead. After the explosion, the baby&#x27;s mother came out of the store and started screaming hysterically.&quot;

== Casualties ==
The dead included 14 Israelis, one pregnant American, and one Brazilian. Additionally, 130 were injured. One victim, Chana Nachenberg, remained hospitalized in a persistent vegetative state more than 20 years after the attack until finally dying of her injuries on 31 May 2023. She was 31-years-old at the time of the bombing. Her daughter, who was two years old at the time, was one of the few in the restaurant who was not injured.

Yocheved Shoshan, 10, was killed, and her 15-year-old sister Miriam was severely injured with 60 nails lodged in her body, a hole in her right thigh, third degree burns on 40 percent of her body, and a ruptured spleen.

Mordechai and Tzira Schijveschuurder, both children of Holocaust survivors, were killed along with three of their children. Two other daughters, Leah, 11, and Chaya, 8, were critically injured. The family was of Dutch origin.

==Perpetrators==
Both Hamas and the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine initially claimed responsibility, with Hamas saying that the attack was in response to Israel&#x27;s assassination ten days earlier in Nablus of the two leading Hamas commanders Jamal Mansour and Omar Mansour as well as six civilians including two children.

The suicide bomber who died in the course of carrying out the attack was later identified to be Izz al-Din Shuheil al-Masri () from the Palestinian West Bank town of Aqabah. Izz al-Masri was 22 at the time and the son of a successful restaurant owner, and from an affluent land-owning family.

The person who constructed the explosives was Abdallah Barghouti. For his part in the bombing and a string of other attacks, in which 67 civilians were killed and 500 injured, he received 67 life sentences on 30 November 2004.

===Ahlam Tamimi===

Izz al-Masri was escorted to the restaurant by Ahlam Tamimi, a 20-year-old female university student and part-time journalist, who had disguised herself as a Jewish tourist for the occasion. She later commented that she was not sorry for what she had done and does not recognize Israel&#x27;s existence. &quot;Despite the fact that I&#x27;m sentenced to 16 life sentences I know that we will become free from Israeli occupation and then I will also be free from the prison,&quot; she said. When she first learned from a journalist who was interviewing her in jail that she had murdered eight children, not just three as she had initially believed, she just smiled broadly and continued with the interview.

Tamimi was released in October 2011 in exchange for the release of captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.

==Aftermath==
In response to the attack, Israel shut down the unofficial Palestinian &quot;foreign office&quot; in Jerusalem, at the Orient House. 

In 2001, the family of Malka Chana (Malki) Roth, a 15-year-old victim of the attack, founded The Malki Foundation, a charity organization that supports families of children with disabilities. All services and equipment are provided at no cost to the families and people of all religions and backgrounds are eligible for assistance. Her parents, Arnold and Frimet Roth, participated in a mass protest in Europe alongside the families of other terror victims in support of the legality the Israeli West Bank barrier. Arnold remarked, &quot;Do I feel bad about the destruction the fence is causing? I do. But do not compare the murder of my daughter to the inability of a Palestinian to get to work by 9:00 A.M.&quot;

The incident inspired the Belzberg family to establish the ONE Family Fund, a charity that provides assistance to victims of terrorist attacks targeting Israel. The husband of Shoshana Greenbaum, the pregnant woman killed in the attack, organized a group called &quot;Partners in Kindness&quot; and writing a column called &quot;A Daily Dose of Kindness&quot;. He explained that he made these efforts in attempt to &quot;improve the world&quot;.

After the suicide bombing, Palestinian university students at the An-Najah University in the West Bank city of Nablus created an exhibition celebrating the first anniversary of the Second Intifada. The exhibit&#x27;s main attraction was a room-sized re-enactment of the bombing at Sbarro. The installation featured broken furniture splattered with fake blood and human body parts. The entrance to the exhibition was illustrated with a mural depicting the bombing. The exhibit was later shut down by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.

==Reactions==
Foreign Minister Peres said that &quot;If the Palestinian Authority had acted with the necessary determination and carried out preventive detentions of Hamas terrorists and their operators, the murders today in Jerusalem would have been prevented.&quot;

Within the Palestinian Territories, Hamas claimed responsibility for the bombing which it praised as a &quot;retaliation of the Palestinian people&quot; against Israel. President of the Palestine Liberation Organization and of the Palestinian Authority Yasser Arafat condemned the &quot;bombing attack ... in West Jerusalem and I denounce all acts that harm civilians.&quot; but the Palestinian Authority blamed Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon for provoking the attack and stated it held him &quot;fully responsible for what happened. The assassinations, the killings and the terrorism that he has practised and escalated in recent weeks led to this result.&quot; The following day, the PA claimed that they had arrested two people &quot;in connection with the Sbarro bombing&quot;.

U.S. President George W. Bush expressed condolences and stated, &quot;I deplore and strongly condemn the terrorist bombing in downtown Jerusalem today. My heartfelt sympathies and those of the American people are with the victims of this terrible tragedy and their families.&quot; Bush demanded Arafat to &quot;condemn this horrific terrorist attack, act now to arrest and bring to justice those responsible, and take immediate, sustained action to prevent future terrorist attacks.&quot;

According to the U.N. press release, &quot;UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan condemned today&#x27;s terror attack by a suicide bomber in Jerusalem. He deplored all acts of terror and is deeply disturbed by the terrible loss of life.&quot; According to the Belgian EU Presidency, &quot;The Presidency of the European Union unreservedly condemns the bombing of a Jerusalem shopping centre today, 9 August. It abhors this cowardly act which mainly claimed the lives of innocent civilians.&quot;

===2011 prisoner exchange===
During the 2011 Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange, relatives of the victims of the bombing vehemently protested the release of Ahlam Tamimi, who chose the Sbarro restaurant as a target and drove the bomber to the location.

Arnold and Frimet Roth circulated a petition against Tamimi&#x27;s inclusion in the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange and also wrote a letter to Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu urging him to exclude her from the list. Frimet Roth said in October, &quot;We feel desperate. We beg Mr. Netanyahu to grant us a few minutes of his time and hear us out. In any sane country with a fair judicial system, even paroled murderers are not released without granting the victims&#x27; loved ones a chance to address the parole board.&quot;
Chaya Schijveschuurder, whose parents and three siblings were killed in the attack, protested with a sign that read, &quot;My parents&#x27; blood screams from the grave!&quot; Her brother, Shvuel, vandalized the Yitzhak Rabin memorial and commented, &quot;My opinions are all right compared to [Chaya&#x27;s] and compared to how she feels about the deal. She was badly wounded in the [Sbarro] attack, she feels that releasing the terrorist is as if she were raped and then the rapist went and murdered her parents and is now being released. For her it&#x27;s like being raped twice.&quot;

<doc id="1285262" wikidata="Q11790911" url="?curid=1285262" title="Newbottle, Tyne and Wear">
<text>Newbottle is a village in the Sunderland district, in Tyne and Wear, England. The village is situated between Durham and Sunderland is . It was historically a part of County Durham.

==Location==
Neighbouring villages and areas include Grasswell (between Newbottle and Houghton le Spring), Shiney Row (between Newbottle and Washington, Tyne and Wear), Herrington Burn (between Newbottle and Shiney Row) and Success/Philadelphia (between Newbottle and Herrington Burn).

The village is served by major road links with the A690 (to Durham/Sunderland) and A19 (to Teesside/North Tyneside) junctions one and a half miles to the east and the A1M (to Newcastle/the South) two and a half miles to the west near Chester-le-Street. Newbottle has a helicopter pad located at the bottom of Stadon Way near the entrance to Okerhampton Drive.

==Etymology==
The name Newbottle derives from the Saxon &#x27;New Battle&#x27; meaning &#x27;new settlement&#x27;. Newbottle village traces its roots to the year 1050, making it medieval in origin. The earliest mention of the town&#x27;s name is in the Boldon Book in 1183 as &#x27;Newbotill&#x27; and by reference to neighbouring Houghton-le-spring (&#x27;Hoctona&#x27;). An English transcription states:

:&quot;In Hoctona are thirteen cottagers, whose tenures, works and payments are like those of Newbotill; and three other half cottagers, who also work like the three half cottagers of Newbotill. Henry the greeve, holds two oxgangs of 24 acres for his service. The smith – 12 acres for his service. The carpenter holds a toft and 4 acres (16,000 m2) for his service. The punder (one who impounds straying animals) has 20 acres and the thraves of Hoctona, Wardon and Morton; he renders 60 hens and 300 eggs. The mills of Newbotill and Bidic, with half of Raynton Mill, pay XV marks. The demesne, consisting of four carucates, and the sheep pastures are in the hands of the lord.&quot;

==History==
In the 19th century there were three potteries, one belonging to the Broderick family. A corn mill was also in the village. Another name is the Russell family, who were believed to be solicitors of Sunderland and there is still a house named Russell today. In 1691, parts of Newbottle called Hall Moor and Dubmire were divided and the tenants all claimed leasehold. There were 16 pits recorded by Lord Lumley as the &quot;Newbottle Group&quot; on 19 August 1762. The Collieries belonging to the Nesham family were sold to the Earl of Durham for £70,000 in 1822. The last of these ceased mining in 1956.

One of the Nesham collieries, the &quot;Success&quot; pit was the scene of a disaster on Friday 2 June 1815. The pit had reached coal at . The explosion was obvious to the men above ground by a large column of dust rising from the pit. No flames were observed, the flame front seems to have been stopped by a large wagon blocking one of the roadways. Early reports blamed a sudden inrush of firedamp from old workings which pitmen had inadvertently broken into. Not all the men were killed by the blast. A number attempted to reach the shaft but were overcome by afterdamp, some even surviving to reach the surface before succumbing to its effects. Out of 72 men and boys underground only 15 survived; 57 were killed.

The local church, St Matthews, dates from 1886, having replaced a previous chapel which was built in 1850. The village centre is a designated conservation area and has stone built housing. Herrington Country Park provides walking, picnics, model boating and cycling and is a mile on foot to the north of the village accessible by public footpath.

The village is situated in the Copt Hill ward on a predominantly Labour run council, however since the local elections of May 2007 the ward itself is served by an Independent councillor. Along with many other communities the local economy has changed over the past generation. The Co-operative store and Post Office have closed and the land and property developed.

Newbottle was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Houghton-le-Spring, in 1866 Newbottle became a separate civil parish, on 1 April 1937 the parish was abolished and merged with Houghton le Spring and East and Middle Herrington. In 1931 the parish had a population of 6811.

Newbottle has been featured in the media since 2005 North East News, BBC Look North, Durham FM, BBC Radio Newcastle, &quot;Sunderland Echo&quot;, &quot;The Journal&quot;, &quot;Evening Chronicle&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; as 7,000 trees, which are part of the Great North Forest are being threatened to be chopped down to make way for 20 new football pitches, car parking and infrastructure. As a result of this threat protestors have been campaigning &quot;Save Our Trees!&quot;. On 29 June 2006 a &#x27;chain saw&#x27; gang acting on the instructions of developers moved into the wood and began felling trees. This action caused the local community to apply to the high court in London for an emergency injunction. Mr Justice Bennett granted the high court injunction. In 2009 the plans were allowed to go ahead and have been ongoing since January 2010, with expected completion around September. After delays, the action was started and in April 2011 a brand new Football Association sponsored and endorsed football training facility was opened. Former England player Sir Trevor Brooking and Sunderland AFC player Jordan Henderson attended the opening. The article was featured on the front page of the newspaper Sunderland Echo.

==Facilities==
The village is served by Newbottle Workingmen&#x27;s Club CIU, The Sun Inn and the Queen&#x27;s Head public houses. There is also an Italian restaurant and a Chinese takeaway. There is a newsagent and a Foodstore/General dealer. Newbottle has one school, Newbottle Primary Academy which has more than 450 students from around the catchment area.

==People==
People to have lived in the village include footballers David Meyler, Chris Turner, Thomas Sorensen and Colin Todd, and singer Bryan Ferry.

<text>James Coleman (born 1941) is an Irish installation and video artist associated with slide-tape works: sequences of still images fading one into the other with synchronized sound. Often, social situations are depicted with a precision which, paradoxically, creates a narrative ambiguity. There is often a focus in his works on how time can warp subjective experience, and how this subjectivity is indispensable to an understanding of how the photographic image accrues meaning. 

James Coleman was born in Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon. He studied at the National College of Art and Design, Dublin, and at University College, Dublin and then spent time in Paris and London before moving to Milan, where he stayed for twenty years. He now lives and works in Ireland. He represented Ireland in the 1973 Paris Biennale. His many exhibitions include a large retrospective shown in a number of major galleries throughout Dublin in 2009, and retrospectives at Reina Sofia, Madrid (2012), and at Centre Pompidou, Paris (2021). 

He was conferred with the degree of Doctor of Fine Arts &quot;honoris causa&quot; by the National University of Ireland at NUI Galway in June 2006.

<doc id="1285282" wikidata="Q192279" url="?curid=1285282" title="Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy">
<text>Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy (; – 23 February 1945) was a Russian writer whose works span across many genres, but mainly belonged to science fiction and historical fiction.

Despite having opposed the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, he was able to return to Russia six years later and live a privileged life as a highly paid author, reputedly a millionaire, who adapted his writings to conform to the line laid down by the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks).

==Life and career==

===Parentage===
Tolstoy&#x27;s mother Alexandra Leontievna Turgeneva (1854–1906) was a grand-niece of Nikolay Turgenev, who had been a Decembrist, and a relative of the Russian writer Ivan Turgenev. She married Count Nikolay Alexandrovich Tolstoy (1849–1900), a member of the aristocratic Tolstoy family and a distant relative of Leo Tolstoy.

Aleksey claimed that Count Tolstoy was his biological father, which allowed him to style himself as a Count; since his mother had taken a lover and left her husband before he was born, not all of his contemporaries believed him. The Nobel Prize winning author Ivan Bunin, who knew him as a young man, wrote in his diary, on 23 February 1953: &quot;Aldanov said that Alyosha Tolstoy himself told him that he, T., bore the surname Bostrom until the age of 16 and then went to see his imaginary father, Count Nick Tolstoy, and begged to legitimize him.&quot; According to author and historian Nikolai Tolstoy, a distant relative:His father had been a rake-hell cavalry officer, whose rowdy excesses proved too much even for his fellow hussars. He was obliged to leave his regiment and the two capital cities, and retired to an estate in Samara, Russia. There he met and married Alexandra Leontievna Turgenev, a lively girl of good family, but slender means. She bore him two sons, Alexander and Mstislav, and a daughter Elizabeth. But the wild blood of the Tolstoys did not allow him to settle down to an existing domestic harmony. Within a year the retired hussar had been exiled to Kostroma for insulting the Governor of Samara. When strings were eventually pulled to arrange his return, he celebrated it by provoking a fellow-noble to a duel. Alexandra fell in love with Alexei Appollonovich Bostrom. In May 1882, already two months pregnant with her fourth child, she fled into the arms of her lover. The Count threatened Bostrom with a revolver but was exculpated by the courts. The ecclesiastical court, in granting a divorce, ruled that the guilty wife should never be allowed to remarry. In order to keep the expected baby, Alexandra was compelled to assert that it was Bostrom&#x27;s child.

What is known is that Bostrom brought the boy up as his own child, on his family farm in Samara province, and that he was known in his childhood and in his teens as Aleksey Bostrom. When he was 13, his mother began a lawsuit to have him recognized as the son of Count Tolstoy, which eventually he was on his 17th birthday, after which he was entitled to style himself as Count Tolstoy.

===Early life===
Tolstoy&#x27;s adoptive father was a liberal landowner, who had supported the emancipation of Russian serfs in the 1860s. His mother wrote children&#x27;s stories, using the pseudonym Alexander Bostrom. Due in part to their rejection by both the Russian nobility and the Church, Aleksey grew up in a staunchly atheistic and anti-monarchist environment, and was encouraged to be creative. He was home taught by his parents, and by a visiting tutor, until the age of 14, when the family moved to Samara, after selling their farm, and he was enrolled in a local school.

===St. Petersburg===
Count Nikolai Tolstoy died in 1900, leaving a will from which Aleksey received 30,000 rubles. This allowed him to move to St Petersburg, where he studied at the Technological Institute St Petersburg in 1901-06. In June 1902 he married a fellow student, Julia Rozhansky, the daughter of a provincial doctor. Their son, Yuri, was born in 1903. According to Nikolai Tolstoy, he took part in a student protest on 12 February 1902 along Nevsky Prospekt, which was broken up by police and Cossacks, and joined the Social Democratic Party, but there does not appear to be any corroboration for this account of his student radicalism. He avoided becoming involved in the 1905 Revolution, by moving to Dresden in February 1906, to enrol in the Royal Saxon Higher School after the government temporarily closed the Technological Institute.

In Dresden, he met Sofia Dymshitz (1889-1963), who had recently married another emigre student named Isaac Rosenfeld (1879-1978). She and Tolstoy became lovers, and returned to rent a shared apartment in St Petersburg, where she took up painting. (Her sister in law, Bella Rosenfeld, married Marc Chagall) Tolstoy&#x27;s wife agreed to a divorce, which was finalised in 1910, but Rosenfeld always refused to divorce Dymshitz.

===Paris===
In 1907 Tolstoy broke off his studies to dedicate himself to writing. The couple decided to emigrate in 1907, and arrived in Paris in January 1908, to join a wide network of emigré Russian writers and artists, including Nikolay Gumilyov, Valery Bryusov, Konstantin Balmont, Andrei Bely, Maximilian Voloshin. He and Gumilyov launched a periodical that folded after one issue for lack of funds. Tolstoy&#x27;s first book of poems, &quot;Lyric&quot;, was published in 1907, at his own expense, but in later life he was embarrassed by it and preferred to forget it. His second poetry collection, &quot;Beyond the Blue Rivers&quot; (1908) was his last. In a letter to his adoptive father, he complained that the name &#x27;Tolstoy&#x27; meant that people had high expectations of him, though Voloshin suggested to him that it was an advantage. One young poet he met mistook him for Leo Tolstoy, who had died in 1910 aged 82.

In 1908, he learnt from his ex-wife that their son had died from meningitis. According to Nikolai Tolstoy,

Sophia claimed in a pious official memoir published in Moscow in 1973 that Alexey, &#x27;took the child&#x27;s death very much to heart.&#x27; One may question this. The father, after all, made no attempt to visit his ailing son before his lonely end, nor did he return for the funeral (though he did make another, business journey to Petersburg from Paris). As subsequent events were to show, he could evince extraordinary callousness toward individual members of the human race, whatever his broadly liberal viewpoint toward the species at large.

===Return to Russia===
Aleksey and Sophia returned to St Petersburg in January 1909. By 1910 his success as a writer enabled them to move into a flat along Nevsky Prospekt, but because of her husband&#x27;s refusal to grant a divorce, when she became pregnant, she returned to Paris in May 1911, where he joined her, so that he could be registered under French law as the father of their daughter, Marianna. They returned to St Petersburg later in the year, but moved to Moscow in 1912.

In the summer of 1914 Tolstoy and Dymshitz took a vacation in Koktebel, Crimea, where he met a 17 year old ballerina named Margarita Kandaurova. Nikolai Tolstoy wrote in 1983 that &quot;The break with Sophia was as abrupt as it had been with Julia. Out on a stroll, Aleksey said significantly, &#x27;I feel that this winter you&#x27;re going to leave me.&#x27; Sophia did not reply, but took the hint and departed for another visit to Paris. The baby Mariana was deposited with an aunt.&quot;

Tolstoy hoped to marry Kandaurova, but she rejected him, and before the end of the year he had met his third wife, Natalya Volkenstein, née Krandinskaya, by whom he had three children.

During World War I Tolstoy worked as a war correspondent, visiting England and France, and wrote several essays and two plays.

===Emigré===
Tolstoy opposed the Bolshevik Revolution. To escape living under Bolshevik rule, he moved with his family in 1918 to Odesa. Then, as the White Army was driven out of Crimea, they fled to Constantinople, before once more relocating to Paris. Unhappy at being, as he put it, &quot;cut off from his homeland&quot;, in 1920, he wrote the story &quot;Nikita&#x27;s Childhood&quot;, about growing up as an exile. Nikita was their oldest child, born in 1917, who was starting to speak with a French accent.

While living in France, Aleksey wrote several plays, and began writing a lengthy historical novel entitled, &quot;The Road to Calvary&quot;, which tracked the period from 1914 to 1919 including the Russian Civil War, which he had completed by 1921. Reaction to it in Soviet Russia was very hostile. The leading Bolshevik literary critic, Aleksandr Voronsky, editor of &quot;Krasnaya Nov&quot; described Tolstoy&#x27;s depiction of the new regime as a &quot;tendentious lie&quot; full of &quot;improbable banalities&quot; and berated the writer for his &quot;countish hatred, his lordly disdain, his spite, bitterness, fury.&quot;

By 1921, Tolstoy was bothered by the Gallicisms appearing in his son&#x27;s spoken Russian language. Declaring that his son was becoming a foreigner, Aleksey moved the family to Berlin, which was then one of the main centers of the Russian diaspora. There, he wrote his science fiction novel, &quot;Aelita&quot;, and became associated with the &#x27;Changing Landmarks&#x27; (&quot;Смена вех&quot;) group whose leading thinker was Nikolai Ustryalov, who were also known National Bolsheviks, because, despite their opposition to communism, they acknowledged that the Bolsheviks had united Russia. While there, he eventually began collaborating with Maxim Gorky on the Pro-Soviet journal &quot;Nakanune&quot;. Ilya Ehrenburg later recalled:There was a place in Berlin that reminded one of Noah&#x27;s Ark, where the clean and unclean met peacefully; it was called the House of Arts and was just a common German café where Russian writers gathered on Fridays. Stories were read aloud by Tolstoy ... Apparently, not all the dice had been cast yet. There were people who called Gorky the &#x27;semi emigre&#x27;... Alexey Tolstoy, surrounded by &quot;Smena Vekh&quot; (Changing Landmarks) people, alternately praised the Bolsheviks as, &#x27;unifiers of the Russian land,&#x27; and indulged in angry abuse. The fog was still swirling.

===Soviet dignitary===
Tolstoy revisited Russia in May 1923, and decided to return permanently, having decided that &quot;no literature will come out of the emigration&quot;. In his farewell editorial printed in &quot;Nakanune&quot;, he wrote, &quot;I am leaving with my family for the homeland forever. If there are people here abroad close to me, my words are addressed to them. Do I go to happiness? Oh, no: Russia is going through hard times. Once again she is enveloped by a wave of hatred... I am going home to a hard life.&quot;

Because of his ancestry he was sometimes called &quot;Comrade Count&quot; or &quot;Red Count&quot;.

Far from experiencing a &quot;hard life&quot; in the Soviet Union, Tolstoy was a highly privileged Soviet citizen, who prospered under the dictator, Joseph Stalin, when other writers who had chosen to live under Soviet rule throughout the civil war were persecuted. According to a widespread rumour, he was a millionaire with a &#x27;bottomless bank account&#x27;. The American journalist Eugene Lyons noted how &quot;almost alone among Russians, Tolstoy lived in baronial style in a rambling many-roomed mansion stocked with rich antiques ... the whole atmosphere of ripe old-world culture seemed like a throw-back to a nearly forgotten period.&quot; Anna Akhmatova paid a back-handed tribute to his ability to live well in a short poem written in the 1920s, which included the lines: 
&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Ah, where are those islands&quot;
&quot;Where the villain Yagoda&quot;
&quot;Would not drive people to the wall&quot;
&quot;and Alyoshka Tolstoy&quot;
&quot;Would not skim it all.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;
If Tolstoy was aware that she had linked his name with that of the reviled head of the NKVD, he did not bear a grudge. In 1940, he and Mikhail Sholokhov proposed that Akhmatova be awarded a Stalin Prize, which would have been her first official recognition by the Soviet literary establishment, but the proposal was vetoed by Stalin.

Soviet critics abruptly changed their view of Tolstoy&#x27;s work once he had declared his new allegiance to the regime. Instead of being denounced in &quot;Krasnaya nov&quot;, he had more work published in that magazine during the 1920s than any other author apart from Maxim Gorky, starting with &quot;Aelita&quot;. A critic writing in the same magazine praised &quot;The Road to Calvary&quot; as the best novel ever written by an emigre Russian.

When Nadezhda Mandelstam published her memoirs in the 1960s, she opened with this enigmatic sentence: &quot;After slapping Alexei Tolstoy in the face, M. immediately returned to Moscow.&quot; She did not explain why her husband, Osip Mandelstam struck Tolstoy, but makes it clear that Tolstoy was so well connected with the Soviet authorities that Mandelstam fled Leningrad because he was afraid that he would be arrested. According to other sources, Tolstoy had chaired a writers&#x27; &#x27;court of honour&#x27; which looked into Mandelstam&#x27;s complaint against a fellow writer who had slapped his wife, and objected to a verdict which implied fault on both sides.

Tolstoy was Chairman of the USSR Writers Union in 1936-38. In January 1937, during the second of the Moscow show trials, at which 17 defendants including former leading Bolsheviks such as Georgy Pyatakov and Karl Radek were forced to confess to crimes they had not committed, Tolstoy signed a collective letter, with other writers, declaring &quot;We demand merciless punishment for traitors, spies and murderers who sell their homeland.&quot;

In 1937, he published his novel &quot;Bread&quot;, which eulogised Stalin&#x27;s role in the defence of Tsaritsyn (later renamed Stalingrad) during the civil war. This prompted one Soviet reader to write to him anonymously, saying that he had previously admired Tolstoy as Russia&#x27;s greatest living writer since the death of Maxim Gorky, but on reading &quot;Bread&quot;:
 
In December 1937 Tolstoy was elected to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. He became a full member of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1939.

=== Peter the Great ===
Tolstoy spent 16 years studying the life of Peter the Great. His first work on this subject was his 1929 play, &quot;Na dybe&quot; (&quot;On the Rack&quot;). In the 1920s, Soviet historiography was dominated by the Bolshevik historian Mikhail Pokrovsky, who despised &quot;Peter, whom fawning historians have called the great&quot; as a tyrant who provoked war with Sweden and impoverished his subjects. Tolstoy&#x27;s 1929 play was true to the party line, depicting Peter as a tyrant who &quot;suppressed everyone and everything as if he had been possessed by demons, sowed fear, and put both his son and his country on the rack.&quot; Stalin went to see the play, but left before the end, setting off speculation that he did not like it. Critics consequently trashed it, until Stalin sent Tolstoy a note saying &quot;A splendid play. Only it&#x27;s a pity Peter is not depicted heroically enough&quot;, and summoned him to advise him on how to write a novelised version of the life of Peter.

In 1935, after Pokrovsky had died and his school of history had been denounced by the party leadership, and the Soviet economy had begun the process of rapid industrialisation through Five Year Plans, Tolstoy wrote a radically different play, &quot;Peter I&quot;, in which – borrowing a motto from Pushkin that &#x27;Russia came into Europe like the launching of a ship&#x27; – the construction of a ship, with Peter acting as the master builder, is the symbol of the entire play.

The first volume of his uncompleted novel, &quot;Peter the Great&quot; was published in 1936, and won a Stalin Prize.

In 1939, with war looming in Russia, Tolstoy produced a third version of his play, which stressed the importance of the army, and the patriotism of its foot soldiers.

=== Ivan the Terrible ===
In December 1940 Tolstoy was commissioned to write a play about the life of Ivan the Terrible, after the Central Committee had issued an instruction that Ivan&#x27;s role in history was to be re-evaluated. The instruction was followed by a phone call from Stalin, who told Tolstoy that Ivan had &#x27;one shortcoming&#x27;, which was that he &#x27;repented of his cruelty.&#x27;

After the German invasion, Tolstoy moved to Zimenki, a village east of Moscow, where he wrote the first scenes of &quot;The Eagle and His Mate&quot;, covering the years 1553-59. In November 1941 he was evacuated to Tashkent, where he completed it the following February. This original version, which was to have been performed in the Maly Theatre was banned by order of the political director the Red Army, Aleksandr Shcherbakov, who sent Stalin a memo explaining that Tolstoy had failed to portray Ivan as &quot;the outstanding stateman of the 16th century&quot;. Despite this official rebuke, Tolstoy was awarded a Stalin Prize in 1943 for &quot;The Road to Calvary&quot;.

In April 1943 Tolstoy completed &quot;The Difficult Years&quot;, his second play about Ivan, covering the years to 1571. In June he sent the script to Stalin, complaining that Shcherbakov had failed to say whether the play was to be allowed to be performed. Stalin then read both scripts, suggested changes, and final versions were completed in November. Both scripts were published in 1944, and &quot;The Eagle and His Mate&quot; received its premiere in the Maly Theatre in October, but the reviews were such that it was taken off, and the next performance opened a week after Tolstoy&#x27;s death. The premiere of &quot;The Difficult Years&quot; was delayed until 1946.

===Wartime===
In November 1942 Tolstoy was appointed a member of the Extraordinary State Commission, established to investigate atrocities committed on Soviet territory by the German invaders and their allies. During the Nuremberg Trial the Soviet prosecutor Lev Smirnov posthumously credited Tolstoy with having led the team that investigated war crimes committed in Stavropol, which for the first time ascertained &#x27;without reasonable doubt&#x27; that gas vans had been used by the Nazis to commit genocide.

In December 1943 Tolstoy was one of a contingent of Soviet and foreign journalists who were sent to Kharkov to cover the first war crimes trial, at which three Germans and a Soviet collaborator were sentenced to death. Ilya Ehrenburg, who also covered the trial, later wrote: &quot;I did not go to the square where the accused were to be hanged. Tolstoy said he must be present: he did not feel he had the right to evade it. After the execution, he came back blacker than night.&quot;

In January 1944 Tolstoy was appointed a member of a special commission that was supposedly charged by the Politburo with investigating the massacre in Katyn forest of 22,000 Polish officers, who had been taken prisoner when the Soviet Union occupied the eastern part of Poland in 1939-1940 under a pact with Nazi Germany. In January 1944 he held a press conference for foreign journalists, in which he and other members of the commission asserted that the officers had been massacred by the Germans in August and September 1941. The special commission&#x27;s report was submitted by the Soviet prosecution team at the Nuremberg Trials, but was not included in the verdict, and in the 1980s, the Soviets belatedly admitted that Stalin ordered the Katyn massacre. As the leading spokesman at the press conference in January 1944, Tolstoy played a major role in ensuring that the Soviet version of the Katyn massacre – which is now known to be a lie – was widely reported in the USA and Great Britain.

=== Death ===
Tolstoy died on 23 February 1945 in Moscow.

==Legacy==

Tolstoy is credited with having produced some of the earliest works of science fiction in the Russian language. His novels &quot;Aelita&quot; (1923) about a journey to Mars and &quot;The Hyperboloid of Engineer Garin&quot; (1927) have gained immense public popularity. The former spawned a pioneering sci-fi movie in 1924. His supernatural short story, &quot;Count Cagliostro&quot;, reportedly inspired the 1984 film &quot;Formula of Love&quot;.

He penned several books for children, starting with &quot;Nikita&#x27;s Childhood&quot;, a memorable account of his early years (the book is sometimes mistakenly believed to be about his son, Nikita; in truth, however, he only used the name because it was his favorite – and he would later give it to his eldest son). In 1936, he created an adaptation of the famous Italian fairy tale about Pinocchio entitled the &quot;Adventures of Buratino or The Golden Key&quot;, whose main character, Buratino, quickly became hugely popular among the Soviet populace. The creator of the Moscow Children&#x27;s Theatre, Natalya Sats spent several months persuading him to write the work, and finally won him over by supplying his wife with foreign fashion magazines.

He is also suspected of being the main author of a libelous and partly pornographic literary fraud entitled &quot;Vyrubova&#x27;s Diary&quot; published in 1927, on instruction from the authorities, to discredit the Russian royal family. Anna Vyrubova was the lady-in-waiting to the Empress Alexandra, consort of Nicholas II, about whom there had been scandalous rumours of sexual relations with Rasputin or with the Tsar or his consort, all of which she denied when under arrest after the revolution. The &#x27;diary&#x27; was &quot;a vulgar and dirty forgery&quot;.

In 1974, a minor planet was discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Zhuravlyova and named 3771 Alexejtolstoj after the Red Count.

==Comments==

While Tolstoy enjoyed huge popularity and success in Russia in his lifetime, western assessments of him have been generally negative because of his role as a Stalin apologist. Nikolai Tolstoy&#x27;s summation of his distant relative was that &quot;His personal character was without question beneath contempt ... in Stalin, he found a worthy master. Few families have produced a higher literary talent than Leo Tolstoy, but few have sunk to one as degraded as Alexei Nikolaevich.

Professor Gleb Struve, a former White Army soldier and committed anti-Communist, who became a leading authority on 20th century Russian literature reckoned that:

Alexei Nikolaevich Tolstoy is, without doubt, one of the most gifted Russian writers of the 20th century … But—and this is the point—this man, endowed with so many extraordinary gifts and sharing the heritage of the great age of Russian literature, lacks one quality which distinguished all of the great Russian poets and writers : a sense of moral and social responsibility. His essence is that of a cynic and opportunist.George Orwell branded Tolstoy, along with contemporary Ilya Ehrenburg, as a &quot;literary prostitute&quot; whose freedom of expression was denied by Soviet totalitarianism.

But Tolstoy&#x27;s friend Ilya Ehrenburg reckoned that &quot;like the real artist he was, he was never sure of himself, always dissatisfied, painfully seeking the right form to express what he wanted to say.&quot;

<doc id="1285284" wikidata="Q2554662" url="?curid=1285284" title="Conscription in Germany">
<text>Between 1956 and 2011, Germany conscripted men subject to mandatory military service (, ). After a proposal on 22 November 2010 by Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, the German Minister of Defence at the time, Germany put conscription into abeyance on 1 July 2011. While the German constitution retains the legal instruments for reintroducing conscription in Germany, currently only men over 18 years of age can be conscripted whilst women cannot under any circumstance () be required to &quot;serve with a weapon&quot; (). 

The constitution (called &quot;Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany&quot;) and several special laws (e.g., ) regulate these duties and exceptions. In the last year of active conscription, men were obliged to either (1) serve six months in the military, which they could refuse, or alternatively (2) complete a civilian or honorary service of at least six months in a civil defence organisation. Families of those who were victims of or oppressed by the Nazi regime (predominantly Jews) were exempted from conscription, although some volunteered to serve. 

 While military service itself will continue to be on a voluntary basis, the government hopes to recruit at least 5,000 additional German citizens of all genders for military service each year in this manner. The participation of women and other genders in equality to men, as regulated by the Self-Determination Act from 1 November 2024, will remain a subject of discussion from 2024 but requires a change to the constitution.

== History of conscription ==
===Military service for conscripts===
Men who did not state that they were conscientious objectors and did not request civil service were by default conscripted into military service () in the . Basic training () comprised three months of combat training, then three months&#x27; service at an assigned post. The conscript would normally reach the rank of (NATO code OR-3, comparable to U.S. Army Private First Class). During his service, he received free health care, housing, food, and railway travel between his home and military base. Conscripts were paid between and per day of basic pay (depending on rank) plus several bonus payments such as distance-from-home pay, additional food pay for days absent from service.

Conscripts could not be deployed to active service in conflicts against their will. The German contributions to forces such as ISAF in Afghanistan and KFOR in Kosovo exclusively comprised professional soldiers and volunteers. Conscripts who wished to partake in such missions had to volunteer for it; this included volunteering for a service extension (because at the time compulsory service duration, nine months at the time, would not have sufficed for recruit training, post-specific training, mission-specific training, mission, and post-processing the mission put together).

===Service in Civil Protection Services===
Conscripts could also opt for civil service, which was, by law, equal to military service, consisting mostly of medical ambulance organisations and organisations for disaster relief (). This was subject to validation by local authorities, who usually were allowed a certain contingent of such volunteers per year of birth. Thus, organizations such as the Technical Relief Service (, abbreviated to THW), volunteer fire services, and other emergency assistance and crisis management agencies such as the Red Cross were supported in performing their volunteer services in disaster response. In the ambulance services, their service could overlap with the service of conscientious objectors.

Conscripts that served in civil protection received no payment outside of compensations for clothing and transportation expenses, as they were performing an honorary service ().

===Conscientious objection===
The German constitution requires that conscientious objection be possible, and therefore conscripts were allowed to perform civilian alternative service ( or ). The conscientious objection had to be declared in a personal letter to the local branch (), with an appendix outlining one&#x27;s moral objections. The branch then sent this appendix to the Federal Office for Civilian Service () for approval or denial. From 1983, denial of conscientious objection claims was quite rare, but prior to 1983 the objector had to defend the validity of his claim before a committee at the draft office. These claims must have been directed against war and military service in general, without regard to the circumstances, and, if they were rejected (which was then a common outcome), the only legal recourse was to challenge the decision in administrative court. While the option of conscientious objection is required by law, in the past there were several hurdles in place to discourage it. Until 1983 conscientious objectors had to undergo a (), an oral examination before a board that tried their motivations, which could decide to deny them conscientious objector status.

Those who objected had to perform civilian alternative service, lasting the same amount of time as military service, plus one additional month, during which they may have found employment with a civilian institution that renders a public service, such as a kindergarten, hospital, rehabilitation center or assisted living facility for the elderly. Alternative service could be more convenient than military service since the conscript could continue living at home rather than in military barracks.

Before German reunification in 1990, residents of West Berlin were exempt from conscription as West Berlin did not formally belong to the Federal Republic of Germany. Therefore some young men moved to West Berlin immediately upon their high school graduation in order to avoid conscription, and thus served neither in the military nor in an alternative service. A total of around 50,000 West German men evaded conscription by moving to West Berlin.

In East Germany, conscripts who were not willing to bear arms were drafted into the National People&#x27;s Army as &quot;construction soldiers&quot; (). They were deployed to public construction projects, and sometimes also to fill worker shortages in various parts of the East German economy, such as the mining industry. Men who served as were frequently subjected to discrimination by the East German state, even after they had finished their service. For example, former were often barred from enrolling at university.

===Duration and payment===
The German constitution also requires that the duration of civilian service does not exceed that of military service. Beginning in 2003, civilian service was of the same duration in months as military service. Until then there was a rate in hours both services had to serve, which was then divided by the average daily work hours in military and civil service. Thereby, civil service tended to be 1–3 months longer than military service, as the latter used to have 50 working hours a week (as opposed to 40 working hours in civil organisations). This made four &quot;military weeks&quot; equivalent to five &quot;civil weeks&quot;. This practice was abolished when the conscription duration was reduced from 10/12 months to 9/9 and later 6/6 months.

=== Exemption from service ===
Women were not conscripted, but they could serve voluntarily. Since 1975 women have been allowed to serve in medical and music band functions. In 2001 the European Court of Justice ruled that limiting women to these functions was against European law. Subsequently, all positions in the Bundeswehr were opened up to women but without also changing the constitution that would have made all genders equal in this regard.

Under a deal between the German Defense Ministry and the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Jews descending from Holocaust victims (up to the third generation) were exempted from military service obligations, but could still volunteer for military service. For decades, volunteering for military service was taboo in the German-Jewish community, but eventually, Jews began joining. In 2007, there were an estimated 200 Jewish soldiers serving in the Bundeswehr.

Men could be exempted from conscription for various reasons. The most frequent reason was medical exemption (). All conscripts, including conscientious objectors but excluding those exempt for other reasons, had to attend a medical examination () at the local conscription branch (). Those who did not pass were exempted from conscription, both military and civilian.

Anyone sentenced to more than a year of imprisonment, or who was charged with a felony against peace, democracy, the state, or state security was not conscripted. Priests were also not drafted, and another provision released everyone from military service who had two siblings who had already served. The same was true for men whose fathers, mothers, or siblings died in military or civil service. Men who were married, living in a registered civil union, or had children were also free to choose. In addition, anyone employed in areas of significant public interest could be exempted from military service upon request. This mostly applied to policemen, career firemen, and specialists in telecommunication and engineering services. 

===Alternative services to &quot;Zivildienst&quot;===
Another alternative was to become a foreign (), which means that the person would be expected to work in a technical capacity in a recognized developing country for a period of not less than two years. To qualify for this option, the candidate had to meet the requests of the chosen agency which included formal vocational training or an educational program that granted a recognized qualification in a marketable skill making him a useful asset in a developing host country. Many men who chose this option became so engaged in the developmental needs of these countries that they stayed abroad many years longer than the legal requirement. The disproportionately high percentage of German nationals found in many international aid, conservation, medical and technical assistance organizations active in developing countries may be directly attributable to this.

Women and unconscripted men were able to opt into serving one year of voluntary service in a social or environmental institution, called (FSJ) and (FÖJ), respectively. It was not a real alternative to military service, but for most practical purposes identical to the civilian alternative service that conscientious objectors were required to serve. This included social security coverage for the term of service and might have given the young attendee a direction for their later career as well as a certain improvement in soft skills.

===Total resisters (&quot;Totalverweigerung&quot;)===
If a conscripted man refused to serve in the military and refused alternative service, he was subject to legal prosecution and imprisonment. The sentence was dependent upon the way the conscript refused to serve. In the military it was prosecuted under military law as desertion () and insubordination (), whereas in the civilian alternative service it was AWOL (). It was never a court-martial. The accused man was often prosecuted under juvenile law and in theory could be fined or imprisoned for up to five years. In practice, the most frequent punishment was three months imprisonment, as longer first-time sentences would be recorded in a (certificate of conduct).

==Political debate to suspend conscription==
The post-Cold-War downsizing of the Bundeswehr led to a considerable decrease in demand for young conscripts. Of all men reaching conscription age, less than one half actually served. In 2005, about 15% served in the military whilst 31% performed civilian service or some other form of alternative service. More than 36% were screened out for medical reasons. This percentage was lower in the past (15% in 2003), but to avoid conscripting more men than needed, medical standards were raised. The remainder included those that were exempted for various reasons, but was mostly made up of men who were not conscripted because the military had already met its recruitment goals. This led to discussions about &quot;conscription equality&quot; ()the principle that conscription be applied equally and non-discriminatorily to all men. The issue of was one aspect of the political debate over whether the Bundeswehr should be converted into a purely volunteer-based, professional army.

===Historical arguments===
Proponents of conscription reason that it conserved the military&#x27;s firm rooting in civilian society and warn that a professional army might return to the militaristic, anti-democratic and elitist traditions of the Nazi and German Empire erasdespite the fact that those regimes also practiced conscription. Conscription is sometimes defended as a tradition dating back to the 1848 revolution, intended to ensure the continuity of the democratic state.

===Military arguments===
Military detractors of conscription reasoned that shortening the service to six months, which was necessary to accommodate a constant number of conscripts in a shrinking army, had made conscription worthless because conscripts receive too little training. Military proponents countered that some service is better than none at all, bringing citizens in contact with their military and thereby countering fears of an increasing disconnect between military and society.

Another factor was the armed forces&#x27; difficulty to find volunteers for senior positions beyond the conscript level. Many soldiers in advanced ranks were recruited from former conscripts who volunteer to extend their service. Abolishing conscription could close this pathway into the military. Therefore, military leaders feared that the abolition of conscription would lead to recruitment shortages even for higher ranking positions.

===Financial arguments===
Some detractors of conscription expected considerable savings in defence spending from abolishing conscription, because it would allow a downsizing of the armed forces, which owe much of their current size to the need to accommodate large numbers of conscripts. It was arguable how such a reduction in size would affect the Bundeswehr&#x27;s capabilities. Those in favour of a downsizing claimed that it would not affect the ability to act in conflict theatres, since conscripts at the time could not be involuntarily deployed to such theatres, which were therefore the domain of a quasi-professional army only anyway.

Experiences of countries who have abolished conscription, especially the United States and France, show that professional armed forces can be more expensive than a conscription-based military. Professional armies need to pay their soldiers higher wages, and have large advertising expenses to attract sufficient numbers of able recruits. The difficulties in recruiting soldiers for advanced ranks without conscription, as well as difficulties in retaining such higher-ranking soldiers whose term of service time ends, indicates that a professional army might have to make considerable financial efforts to be competitive as an employer.

===Civic arguments===
Civilian detractors argued that conscription was simply anachronistic, instilling an undue sense of militarism in young men, and also delaying their entry into the workforce. Others argued that especially young people often detached themselves from their community, consuming its benefits but trying to avoid its duties. Conscription obliged at least the male portion of the population to pay society back through military and civilian service.

Furthermore, abolishing conscription also meant abolishing civilian service. A purely civilian compulsory service would be incompatible with the German basic law, which permitted conscription only for the purpose of defense. This caused a considerable drop in the number of people working in the care of children and elderly people. Such care facilities often relied on civilian service to furnish them with large numbers of very low-paid workers.

Apart from that, professional forces tend to recruit largely from underprivileged groups in society. In 2007 for example, a disproportionate number of soldiers (about 4 out of 10) who volunteer beyond their basic service came from the poorer eastern parts of Germany. It was feared that a professional force would increase this trend, disconnecting the armed forces from the more affluent groups in society.

== Further mandatory services ==
In Germany, beside the suspended military service, a few other mandatory services are possible and implemented by law in some municipalities.

=== Border Guard Service ===
By constitutional law a Compulsory Border Guard Service in the Federal Police (), the renamed Federal Border Guard () can be implemented. Currently conscription is suspended in peacetime, similar to conscription for military service.

=== Compulsory Fire Service ===
A Compulsory Fire Service for a local fire department is in force in a handful of municipalities.

=== Dyke Relief Service ===
In the case of floodings and crevasse the &quot;Dyke Relief Service&quot; () can be enforced where citizens can be drafted by municipalities for cleanup services or to make dykes safe.

=== Hand and hitch-up services ===
So-called &quot;hand and hitch-up services&quot; () or more contemporary the (mandatory) &quot;municipal services&quot; () is an obligatory service, that can be requested by a local government and is still enforced in small townships to maintain municipal properties and infrastructure.

<doc id="1285318" wikidata="Q940069" url="?curid=1285318" title="Lime Rock Park">
<text>Lime Rock Park is a natural-terrain motorsport road racing venue located in Lakeville, Connecticut, United States, a hamlet in the town of Salisbury, in the state&#x27;s northwest corner. Built in 1956, it is the nation&#x27;s third oldest continuously operating road racing venue, behind Road America (1955) and Willow Springs International Motorsports Park (1953). The track was owned by Skip Barber from 1984 to April 2021, a former race car driver who started the Skip Barber Racing School in 1975. Now, it is owned by Lime Rock Group, LLC. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.

==History==
The Lime Rock track was originally conceived of in 1956 by Jim Vaill, who, along with John Fitch and Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, built the track utilizing state-of-the-art road and highway safety principles of the time. The first race, a mix of G-Production class and an MG class, was held on April 28, 1957. The winner of the G-Production was Ted Sprigg in an Alfa Romeo Giulietta. The winner of the MG class was Charles Callanan in an MG TC.

In 1959, Lime Rock was the site of a notable upset, when Rodger Ward won a Formula Libre race driving an Offenhauser-engined midget car, usually used on oval tracks. Ward used an advantageous power-to-weight ratio and his dirt-track cornering abilities to defeat several highly regarded sports cars and drivers for the victory. The year, the track also hosted the Little Le Mans race, won by Charles Callanan and Roger Penske in a Fiat Abarth. In 2008, the track was re-paved and two new corner complexes were added.

The track has a loyal following, though it did face some resistance from the local community shortly after it opened. In 1959, the Lime Rock Protective Association, with support from the nearby Trinity Episcopal Church, took the park to Litchfield Superior Court in an effort to ban Sunday racing. The court issued a permanent injunction against Sunday racing, and its decision was upheld by the Connecticut Supreme Court. While restrictive, the carefully crafted injunction was also enabling. It preserved the track&#x27;s right to conduct unmuffled sports car racing on Fridays and Saturdays, plus testing on Tuesdays and other operating benefits. The injunction stands to this day.

The track has featured many well-known racers including Paul Newman, who supported his own Newman-Haas team with Bob Sharp, Mario Andretti, Stirling Moss, Dan Gurney, Sam Posey, and Mark Donohue. Other racers have included Parnelli Jones, Joey Logano, Austin Dillon, Simon Pagenaud, Alexander Rossi, and Tom Cruise. Posey and Newman have sections of the circuit named for them.

The Rolex Sports Car Series, American Le Mans Series and IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship have used a configuration which included the chicane at turn five and West Bend.

==Track==
The track is a natural terrain road course, constructed over hilly terrain in the Berkshire Mountains, part of the greater Appalachian mountain range. The famous Appalachian Trail hiking route passes by the circuit on the ridge lines visible from the track a half mile to the east. The venue is somewhat unique in that it features no grandstands or bleacher seating, instead inviting fans to bring chairs and blankets and enjoy the racing from its grassy hillside areas under the shade of trees. While the venue is relatively compact, the relatively short track is renowned for its spectator experience, offering fans an up close view and close quarters racing.

For years the track was listed as being in length—the story goes that right after it was built, somebody used the odometer in a Chevrolet to measure the track length—and 1.53 was taken as gospel. Following the 2008 reconstruction (see below), Lime Rock&#x27;s operations people measured all four possible configurations, and as it turns out, each was long, plus or minus a few hundred feet. The IMSA Weathertech Sportscar Championship gives the distance of the track as . The &quot;classic&quot; configuration is seven turns, while the three optional layouts are eight, nine and ten turns, respectively.

<text>The Codex Alexandrinus (London, British Library, Royal MS 1. D. V-VIII) is a manuscript of the Greek Bible, written on parchment. It is designated by the siglum A or 02 in the Gregory-Aland numbering of New Testament manuscripts, and δ 4 in the von Soden numbering of New Testament manuscripts. It contains the majority of the Greek Old Testament and the Greek New Testament. It is one of the four Great uncial codices (these being manuscripts which originally contained the whole of both the Old and New Testaments). Along with Codex Sinaiticus and Vaticanus, it is one of the earliest and most complete manuscripts of the Bible. Using the study of comparative writing styles (palaeography), it has been dated to the fifth century. 

It derives its name from the city of Alexandria (in Egypt), where it resided for a number of years before it was brought by the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch Cyril Lucaris from Alexandria to Constantinople (modern day Istanbul in Turkey). It was then given to Charles I of England in the 17th century. Bishop Brian Walton assigned Alexandrinus the capital Latin letter A in the Polyglot Bible (a multi-language version of the Bible with the different languages placed in parallel columns) of 1657. This designation was maintained when the New Testament manuscript list system was standardized by Swiss theologian and textual critic Johann J. Wettstein in 1751. Thus Alexandrinus held the first position in the manuscript list. 

Until the later purchase of Codex Sinaiticus, biblical scholar and textual critic Frederick H. A. Scrivener described it as the best manuscript of the Greek Bible deposited in Britain. Today, it rests along with Codex Sinaiticus in one of the showcases in the Sir John Ritblat Gallery of the British Library in London, U.K. A full photographic reproduction of the New Testament volume (Royal MS 1 D. viii) is available on the British Library&#x27;s website.

==Description==

The manuscript is a codex (precursor to the modern book) made from 773 vellum folios (specific name for pages in a codex) measuring , bound in quarto format (parchment leaves placed on top of each other, folded in half vertically, and then folded in half again horizontally, to make a single block, then stitched together with others to create a book), which now comprise four volumes. Most of the folios were originally gathered into quires of eight leaves each (this being eight parchment leaves placed on top of each other, then folded as per quarto above). Scholar B. H. Cowper describes the vellum as &quot;thin, fine, and very beautiful&quot;. In modern times it was rebound into sets of six leaves each. Cowper&#x27;s further description of the pages note they are &quot;often discoloured at the edges&quot;, which have been damaged by age and more so through &quot;the ignorance or carelessness of the modern binder, who has not always spared the text, especially at the upper inner margin&quot;. Scrivener noted that &quot;[t]he vellum has fallen into holes in many places, and since the ink peels off for every age whensoever a leaf is touched a little roughly, no one is allowed to handle the manuscript except for good reasons.&quot; Three volumes contain the Septuagint (the Greek version of the Old Testament, also known as the LXX), of which the total count of folios for each volume is 279, 238, and 118 with ten leaves lost. The fourth volume contains the New Testament in the remaining 144 folios, with 31 leaves lost. In the fourth volume, 1 and 2 Clement are also missing leaves, perhaps 3.

The text in the codex is written in two columns in uncial script, with between 49 and 51 lines per column, and 20 to 25 letters per line. The beginning lines of each book are written in red ink, and sections within the book are marked by a larger letter set into the margin. The text is written continuously, with no division of words (known as &quot;Scriptio continua&quot;), but some pauses are observed in places in which a dot should be between two words. There are no accents or breathing marks, except a few added by a later hand. The punctuation was written by the first hand. The poetical books of the Old Testament are written stichometrically (this being a new verse/phrase starting on a new line). The Old Testament quotations in the text of New Testament are marked in the margin by the sign 〉(known as a &quot;diplai&quot;).

The only decorations in the codex are tail-pieces at the end of each book (see illustration), and it also shows a tendency to increase the size of the first letter of each sentence. The larger letters at the beginning of the sections stand out in the margin as in codices Ephraemi and Basilensis. Codex Alexandrinus is the oldest manuscript to use larger letters to indicate new sections.

Iotacistic errors occur in the text: αὶ is exchanged for ε, εὶ for ὶ and η for ὶ. This is, however, no more than seen in other manuscripts of the same date. The letters Ν and Μ are occasionally confused, and the cluster (gg) is substituted with (ng). This may be an argument which points to Egypt as where the codex was produced, but it is not universally accepted.

The handwriting from the beginning of Luke to 1 Corinthians 10:8 differs from that in the rest of the manuscript. Some letters have Coptic shapes (f.e. Α (&quot;alpha&quot;), Μ (&quot;mu&quot;), Δ (&quot;delta&quot;), and Π (&quot;pi&quot;)). The letters are more widely spaced and are a little larger than elsewhere. Δ has extended base and Π has extended cross-stroke. Numerals are not expressed by letters except in Revelation 7:4; 21:17. In the past the codex had been judged to have been carelessly written, with many errors of transcription, but not so many as in Codex Sinaiticus, and no more than Codex Vaticanus.
The majuscule letters have elegant shape, but a little less simple than those in Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus. At the end of a line, these letters are often very small, and much of the writing is very pale and faint. Punctuation is more frequent, usually on a level with the top of the preceding letter, while a vacant space, proportionate to the break in the sense, follows the end of a paragraph. At the end of each book the colophon is ornamented by pretty volutes from the initial copyist. The Ammonian Sections with references to the Eusebian Canons (an early system of dividing the four Gospels into different sections, developed by early church writer Eusebius of Caesarea) stand in the margin of the Gospels. It contains divisions into larger sections (known as (&quot;kephalaia&quot;), or &quot;chapters&quot;), the headings of these sections (known as / &quot;titloi&quot;) stand at the top of the pages. The places at which sections start are indicated throughout the Gospels, and in Luke and John their numbers are placed in the margin of each column. To all the Gospels (except Matthew, due to several pages missing at the beginning) is prefixed by a table of contents (also known as ).

The various Euthalian Apparatus sections into which the Acts, Epistles, and Apocalypse were divided (similar to Eusebius&#x27; system for the Gospels) are not indicated in this manuscript. A &quot;cross&quot; appears occasionally as a separation in the Book of Acts. A larger letter in the margin throughout the New Testament marks the beginning of a paragraph.

The number of scribes who worked on the codex have been disputed. According to biblical and classical scholar Frederic Kenyon&#x27;s opinion there were five scribes, two scribes in the Old Testament (I and II) and three in the New (III, IV, and V). Subsequently, textual critics Theodore Skeat and Milne argued there were only two or possibly three scribes. 20th-21st century scholars agreed in that case (such as biblical scholar and textual critic Bruce Metzger, biblical scholar and textual critic Kurt Aland, textual critic Juan Hernández Jr., and textual critic Dirk Jongkind).

Many corrections have been made to the manuscript, some of them by the original scribe, but the majority of them by later hands. The corrected form of the text agrees with that seen in Codex Bezae (D), Codex Petropolitanus Purpureus (N), Codex Monacensis (X), Codex Macedoniensis (Y), Codex Tischendorfianus IV (Γ), Codex Koridethi (Θ), Codex Petropolitanus (Π), Codex Rossanensis (Σ), Codex Beratinus (Φ) and the majority of minuscule manuscripts. Kenyon observed that Codex Alexandrinus had been &quot;extensively corrected, though much more in some books than in others&quot;. In the Pentateuch, whole sentences were erased and a new text substituted. Kings was the least corrected of the books. In the Book of Revelation only 1 of its 84 singular readings was corrected, the rest remained uncorrected. This is in stark contrast with Codex Sinaiticus, in which 120 of the Apocalypse&#x27;s 201 singular readings were corrected in the 7th century.

Each leaf has Arabic numeration, set in the verso of the lower margin. The first surviving leaf of Matthew has number 26. The 25 leaves now lost must have been extant when that note was written.

==Contents==

The codex contains a nearly complete copy of the LXX, including the deuterocanonical books (those books not accepted as authoritative by some Christians, but accepted by certain Christian denominations) 3 and 4 Maccabees, Psalm 151 and the 14 Odes. The Epistle to Marcellinus (attributed to Saint Athanasius) and the Eusebian summary of the Psalms are inserted before the Book of Psalms (an overview of the Psalms written by the early Christian writer Eusebius of Caesarea). It also contains all of the books of the common modern 27-book New Testament, however the pages containing Matthew 1:1–25:5 are not extant. The codex also contains 1 Clement (lacking 57:7–63; this is a letter attributed to the early Christian writer Clement of Rome) and the homily known as 2 Clement (up to 12:5a; another letter attributed to Clement of Rome). The books of the Old Testament are thus distributed: Genesis – 2 Chronicles (first volume), Hosea – 4 Maccabees (second volume), Psalms – Sirach (third volume). The New Testament (fourth volume) books are in the order: Gospels, Acts of the Apostles, General epistles, Pauline epistles (Hebrews placed between 2 Thessalonians and 1 Timothy), Book of Revelation.

There is an appendix marked in the index, which lists the Psalms of Solomon and probably contained more apocryphal/pseudepigraphical books (books written which have been attributed to certain famous people mentioned in the Bible, but likely of unknown authorship), but it has been torn off and the pages containing these books have also been lost.
Due to damage and lost folios, various passages are missing or have defects:
* Lacking: 1 Sam 12:17–14:9 (1 leaf); Ps 49:20–79:11 (9 leaves); Matt 1:1-25:6 (26 leaves); John 6:50-8:52 (2 leaves); 2 Cor 4:13-12:6 (3 leaves); 1 Clement 57:7-63 (1 leaf) and 2 Clement 12:5a-fin. (2 leaves);
* Damaged: Gen 14:14–17, 15:1–5, 15:16–19, 16:6–9 (lower portion of torn leaf lost);
* Defects due to torn leaves: Genesis 1:20–25, 1:29–2:3, Lev 8:6,7,16; Sirach 50:21f, 51:5;
* Lacunae on the edges of almost every page of the Apocalypse.
* The ornamented colophon of the Epistle to Philemon has been cut out.

==Textual features==

Textual critics have had a challenging task in classifying the text of the codex, specifically when it comes to the New Testament; the exact relationship to other text-types and manuscript families is still disputed, and as such the Greek text of the codex is considered to be of mixed text-types. The text-types are groups of different New Testament manuscripts which share specific or generally related readings, which then differ from each other group, and thus the conflicting readings can separate out the groups. These are then used to determine the original text as published; there are three main groups with names: Alexandrian, Western, and Byzantine. The codex is a representative of the Byzantine text-type in the Gospels (the text-type&#x27;s oldest example), and the rest of the New Testament books are of the Alexandrian text-type, with some Western readings. As the text in the codex is believed to have come from several different traditions, different parts of the codex are not of equal textual value. Aland placed it in Category III in the Gospels, and in Category I in rest of the books of the New Testament according to his manuscript text classification system. Category III manuscripts are described as having &quot;a small but not a negligible proportion of early readings, with a considerable encroachment of [Byzantine] readings, and significant readings from other sources as yet unidentified&quot;; Category I manuscripts are depicted as featuring &quot;a very high proportion of the early text, presumably the original text, which has not been preserved in its purity in any one manuscript.&quot; 
;Text of the Gospels
The Byzantine text of the Gospels has a number of Alexandrian features, with some affinities to the textual Family Π. Biblical scholar and textual critic Hermann von Soden associated the text of the gospels with Family Π, though it is not a pure member of this family. According to biblical scholar and textual critic Burnett Streeter, it is the earliest Greek manuscript which gives us approximately the text of Lucian the Martyr (who is believed to have created a critical recension of both the Old and New Testaments), but a small proportion of the readings seem to be earlier.
; Text of the rest of the codex
Alexandrinus follows the Alexandrian readings through the rest of the New Testament; however, the text goes from closely resembling Codex Sinaiticus in the Pauline epistles to more closely resembling the text of a number of papyri ( for Acts, for the Apocalypse). The text of Acts frequently agrees with the biblical quotations made by the 4th century Christian writer Athanasius of Alexandria. In the Pauline Epistles its text is closer to Codex Sinaiticus than to Codex Vaticanus. In the General Epistles it represents a different subtype than Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus. In Revelation it agrees with Codex Ephraemi and against Codex Sinaiticus and . According to Metzger, in Revelation and in several books of the Old Testament it has the best text of all manuscripts. In the Old Testament its text often agrees with Codex Sinaiticus.

Alexandrinus is an important witness for the absence of &quot;Pericope Adultera&quot; (John 7:53–8:11). Gregory asserted in regard to the lost two leaves (John 6:50–8:52), &quot;For by counting the lines we can prove that it was not in the book. There was not room for it&quot;. A similar counting involving missing leaves is done with Codex Ephraemi.

== History ==

=== Place of origin ===
The codex&#x27;s original provenance is unknown. Cyril Lucaris was the first to suggest Alexandria as its place of origin, which has been the traditional view and is the most probable hypothesis. This popular view is based on an Arabic note on folio 1 (from the 13th or 14th century), which reads: &quot;Bound to the Patriarchal Cell in the Fortress of Alexandria. Whoever removes it thence shall be excommunicated and cut off. Written by Athanasius the humble.&quot; &quot;Athanasius the humble&quot; is identified with Athanasius III, Patriarch of Alexandria from 1276 to 1316.

Burnett Hillman Streeter proposed Caesarea or Beirut for three reasons: 1) after the New Testament it contains the two Epistles of Clement; 2) it represents an eclectic text in the New Testament (Antiochian in the Gospels and Alexandrian in the Acts and Epistles), suggesting some place where the influence of Antioch and of Alexandria met; 3) the text of the Old Testament appears to be a non-Alexandrian text heavily revised by the Hexapla, as the Old Testament quotations in the New Testament portion more often agree with Alexandrinus against Vaticanus than not.

Theodore C. Skeat disputed the notion that the Codex Alexandrinus &quot;had been in Alexandria from time immemorial&quot;. Instead, he thought that the codex was brought to Alexandria from Constantinople between 1308 and 1316. Cyril Lucaris then brought it back to Constantinople in 1621, and it was given to Charles I in 1627. 

McKendrick proposed an Ephesian provenance for the codex.

A 17th-century Latin note on a flyleaf (from the binding in a royal library) states the codex was given to a patriarchate of Alexandria in 1098 (&quot;donum dedit cubicuo Patriarchali anno 814 Martyrum&quot;), although this may well be &quot;merely an inaccurate attempt at deciphering the Arabic note by Athanasius&quot; (possibly the patriarch Athanasius III). The authority for this statement is unknown.

===Date===
According to an Arabic note on the reverse of the first volume of the manuscript, the manuscript was written by the hand of Thecla, the martyr, a notable lady of Egypt, a little later than the Council of Nicaea (A.D. 325). Tregelles made another suggestion, the New Testament volume has long been mutilated, and begins now in the twenty-fifth chapter of Matthew, in which chapter the lesson for Thecla&#x27;s Day stands. &quot;We cannot be sure how the story arose. It may be that the manuscript was written in a monastery dedicated to Thecla.&quot; Tregelles thought that Thecla&#x27;s name might have on this account been written in the margin above, which has been cut off, and that therefore the Egyptians imagined that Thecla had written it. Cyril Lucaris believed in Thecla&#x27;s authorship, but the codex cannot be older than from late 4th century.

Codex Alexandrinus contains the Epistle of Athanasius on the Psalms to Marcellinus, so it cannot be considered earlier than A.D. 373 (&quot;terminus post quem&quot;). In the Acts and Epistles we cannot find such chapter divisions, whose authorship is ascribed to Euthalius, Bishop of Sulci, come into vogue before the middle of the fifth century. It is &quot;terminus ad quem&quot;. The presence of Epistle of Clement, which was once read in Churches recalls to a period when the canon of Scripture was in some particulars not quite settled. It is certain that the writing of the manuscript appears to be somewhat more advanced than that of the Vaticanus or Sinaiticus, especially in the enlargement of initial letters. It is also more decorated, though its ornamentations are already found in earlier manuscripts.

Codex Alexandrinus was written a generation after codices Sinaiticus and Vaticanus, but it may still belong to the fourth century. It cannot be later than the beginning of the fifth. It is currently dated by the INTF to the 5th century.

==In Britain==

The codex was brought to Constantinople in 1621 by Cyril Lucaris (a patriarch of Alexandria first, then later a patriarch of Constantinople). Lucaris was involved in a complex struggle with the Turkish government, the Catholic Church, and his own subordinates. He was supported by the English government, and presented the codex to James I in 1624, as gratitude for his help. The codex was presented through the hands of Thomas Roe (together with minuscule 49), the English ambassador at the court of the Sultan. King James I died before the codex was sent to England, and the offer was transferred to Charles I in 1627. It was saved from the fire at Ashburnham House (the Cotton library) on 23 October 1731, by the librarian, Richard Bentley. It became a part of the Royal Library at the British Museum, and since 1973 has been in the British Library.

===Collations and editions===

The text of the Epistles of Clement from the codex was published in 1633 by Patrick Young, the Royal Librarian. A collation was made by Alexander Huish, Prebendary of Wells, for the &quot;London Polyglot Bible&quot; (1657). The text of the codex was cited in footnotes. Richard Bentley made a collation in 1675.

The Old Testament was edited by Ernst Grabe in 1707–1720, and the New Testament by Carl Gottfried Woide in 1786, in facsimile from wooden type, line for line, without spaces between the words, exactly mimicking the original. For the text in 1 Tim 3:16, the facsimile has , and Woide in his prolegomenon combats the opinion of Wettstein, who maintained that was the original reading, and that the stroke, which in some lights can be seen across part of the Ο, arose from the middle-stroke part of a letter Ε being visible through the vellum. Wettstein&#x27;s assertion was also disputed by F.H. Scrivener, who found that &quot;Ε cut the Ο indeed . . . but cut it too high to have been reasonably mistaken by a careful observer for the diameter of Θ.&quot; Tregelles however agrees with Wettstein&#x27;s reading of the codex, and states &quot;as the result of repeated examinations, we can say distinctly that Woide was wrong, and Wetstein was right.&quot;

Woide&#x27;s edition contained some typesetting errors, such as in the Epistle to Ephesians – (4:1) and πραόθητος for πραότητος (4:2). These errors were corrected in 1860 by B. H. Cowper, and E. H. Hansell, with three other manuscripts, in 1860. The Old Testament portion was also published in three folio volumes by Baber in 1816–1828. In 1879 and 1880, the entire codex was issued in photographic facsimile by the British Museum, under the supervision of E. M. Thompson. Frederic G. Kenyon edited a photographic facsimile of the New Testament with reduced size in 1909. The text of the Old Testament followed four parts in 1915.

===Textual criticism===

According to Bentley the codex is &quot;the oldest and best in the world&quot;. Bentley assumed that by supplementing this manuscript with readings from other manuscripts and from the Latin Vulgate, he could triangulate back to the single recension which he presumed existed at the time of the First Council of Nicaea. Wettstein highly esteemed the codex in 1730, but changed his opinion in 1751 and was no longer a great admirer of it. He came to the conviction that Athos was the place of its origin, not Alexandria. Michaelis also did not esteem it highly, either on account of its internal excellence or the value of its readings. The principal charge which has been produced against the manuscript, and which had been urged by Wettstein, was it had been altered from the Latin version. Michaelis countered that the transcriber who lived in Egypt would not have altered the Greek text from a Latin version, because Egypt belonged to the Greek diocese, and Latin was not understood there. Woide, who defended the Greek manuscripts in general, and the Codex Alexandrinus in particular, from the charge of having been corrupted from the Latin, discerned two hands in the New Testament.

Griesbach agreed with Woide and expanded on Michaelis&#x27; point of view. If this manuscript has been corrupted from a version, it is more reasonable to suspect the Coptic, the version of the country in which it was written. Between this manuscript and both the Coptic and Syriac versions there is a remarkable coincidence. According to Griesbach the manuscript follows three different editions: the Byzantine in the Gospels, the Western in the Acts and General epistles, and the Alexandrian in the Pauline epistles. Griesbach designated the codex by letter A.

Tregelles explained the origin of the Arabic inscription, on which Cyril&#x27;s statement appears to rest, by remarking that the text of the New Testament in the manuscript begins with Matthew 25:6, this lesson (Matthew 25:1–13) being that appointed by the Greek Church for the festival of St. Thecla. 

==Importance==
It was the first manuscript of great importance and antiquity of which any extensive use was made by textual critics, but the value of the codex was differently appreciated by different writers in the past. Wettstein created a modern system of catalogization of the New Testament manuscripts. Codex Alexandrinus received symbol A and opened the list of the NT uncial manuscripts. Wettstein announced in his &quot;Prolegomena ad Novi Testamenti Graeci&quot; (1730) that Codex A is the oldest and the best manuscript of the New Testament, and should be the basis in every reconstruction of the New Testament text. Codex Alexandrinus became a basis for criticizing the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; (Wettstein, Woide, Griesbach).

<text>Ibbur (, &quot;pregnancy&quot; or &quot;impregnation&quot; or &quot;&quot;), is one of the transmigration forms of the soul and has similarities with Gilgul neshamot. &quot;Ibbur&quot; is always good or positive, while dybbuk (), is negative. &quot;Ibbur&quot; is the most positive form of possession, and the most complicated. It happens when a righteous soul decides to occupy a living person&#x27;s body for a time, and joins, or spiritually &quot;impregnates&quot; the existing soul. Ibbur is always temporary, and the living person may or may not know that it has taken place. Often the living person has graciously given consent for the &quot;Ibbur&quot;. The reason for &quot;Ibbur&quot; is always benevolent—the departed soul wishes to complete an important task, to fulfil a promise, or to perform a mitzvah (a religious duty) that can only be accomplished in the flesh. In Lurianic Kabbalah, &quot;ibbur&quot; occurs when an incomplete soul which cannot achieve tikun is completed by the addition of the soul of a tzadik, or spiritual master. Luria believed this to be possible even whilst the possessor was still alive.

<text>The North Jersey Imperials were a soccer club based in Paramus, New Jersey. They played in the United Soccer Leagues between 1994 and 2001. The Imperials were the first pro team of US national team goalkeeper Tim Howard. Sean Kenny was the head coach.

During their inaugural season in 1994, the Imperials played their home games at Bruins Stadium, which is located within James J. Braddock-Hudson County Park, in North Bergen, New Jersey. That year, the Imperials defeated the Jersey Dragons in the USISL D3 Pro League Northeast Division semi-finals, but fell to the Long Island Rough Riders. Players of note during the inaugural season were John Diffley, who went on to play for the Tampa Bay Mutiny and Kansas City Wizards, Jeff Zaun, who went on to play for the MetroStars, and Tom Lips, who went on to play for the New England Revolution. Another original Imperials player, Pat O&#x27;Kelly, was drafted by the MetroStars in 1996, but chose not to sign with the team.

The 1995 season saw the Imperials play their home games at Veteran&#x27;s Memorial Stadium, in Bayonne, New Jersey. This season saw the Imperials play their two best attended games, when over 2,500 fans turned out to see them play against the Long Island Rough Riders, who featured US national team goalkeeper Tony Meola in their starting lineup, and over 4,500 turned out to see them play an exhibition against Polish club Stal Mielec. That year, the Imperials fell to the New York Fever in the Northeast Division Final.

The 1996 season saw the Imperials play their home games at Fairleigh Dickinson University&#x27;s University Stadium, located in Teaneck, New Jersey. The Imperials won the USISL D3 Northeast Division Championship that year, defeating the Central Jersey Riptide in the final and advancing to the Sizzling Six National Finals. Notable games that year were exhibitions against Danish club Viborg FF and a game featuring a team of several former New York Cosmos players. Imperials players of note that year were Rob Johnson and Petter Villegas, both of which would go on to play for the MetroStars, and Altimont Butler, who would play for the San Jose Clash.

The 1997 Season saw the Imperials continue their tenure at FDU&#x27;s University Stadium. The Imperials fell in the D3 semi finals (by shoot out) to the Central Jersey Riptide. This season was notable as 18-year-old Tim Howard, from North Brunswick, was the starting goalkeeper for the Imperials. Howard went on to the join the MetroStars for the 1998 season. He was then transferred to Manchester United in 2003 and has been the starting goalkeeper at Everton from 2006 (loan in 2006, transferred in 2007). Howard has been the first-choice goalkeeper for the US national team since 2007 and was the starting goalkeeper at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. Other notable Imperials players that year were MetroStars back-up goalkeeper Zach Thornton (4 games) and MetroStars midfielder Cristian da Silva (2 games). During this season, 4 Imperials players, including Tim Howard, Jerry Lucey and Kenny Santos, were called up by the MetroStars for a July 30 exhibition against the Long Island Rough Riders.

The 1998 season saw the Imperials on hiatus.

The 1999 season saw the Imperials play their home games at Sprague Field, on the Campus of Montclair State University, in Montclair, New Jersey. This was a poor campaign, and the Imperials finished in 8th place in the Northeast Division. This season also saw the return of former Imperials goalkeeper Tim Howard, for at least 1 home game, on loan from the MetroStars. A player of note during this season was goalkeeper Kevin East, who&#x27;d spent time with the Columbus Crew and the MetroStars. East was loaned to the MetroStars that year, as a backup, when Tim Howard was away with the U.S. U-20 national team.

The 2000 and 2001 seasons saw the Imperials, still playing at Montclair State University, drop a level to the Premier Development League (the 4th division of US Soccer). One notable player from this period is Alecko Eskandarian, who played for the PDL Imperials during the 2000 season. Eskandarian, a Montvale native, would go on to play in Major League Soccer for several MLS teams, and was named MLS Cup MVP for his 2-goal performance at the 2004 event. The North Jersey Imperials became defunct after the 2001 season.

<doc id="1285374" wikidata="Q522379" url="?curid=1285374" title="Society of the Priests of Saint Sulpice">
<text>The Society of Priests of Saint-Sulpice (; PSS), also known as the Sulpicians, is a society of apostolic life of Pontifical Right for men, named after the Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris, where it was founded. The members of the Society add the nominal letters PSS after their names to indicate membership in the Congregation. Typically, priests become members of the Society of the Priests of St. Sulpice only after ordination and some years of pastoral work. The purpose of the society is mainly the education of priests and to some extent parish work. As their main role is the education of those preparing to become priests, Sulpicians place great emphasis on the academic and spiritual formation of their own members, who commit themselves to undergoing lifelong development in these areas. The Society is divided into three provinces, operating in various countries: the Province of France, Canada, and the United States.

==In France==
The Society of Priests of Saint Sulpice was founded in France in 1641 by Father Jean-Jacques Olier (1608–1657), an exemplar of the French School of Spirituality. A disciple of Vincent de Paul and Charles de Condren, Olier took part in &quot;missions&quot; organized by them.

The French priesthood at that time suffered from low morale, academic deficits and other problems. Envisioning a new approach to priestly preparation, Olier gathered a few priests and seminarians around him in Vaugirard, a suburb of Paris, in the final months of 1641. Shortly thereafter, he moved his operation to the parish of Saint-Sulpice in Paris, hence the name of the new Society. After several adjustments, he built a seminary next to the current church of Saint-Sulpice. The Séminaire de Saint-Sulpice thereby became the first Sulpician seminary. There the first seminarians got their spiritual formation, while taking most theology courses at the Sorbonne. The spirit of this new seminary and its founder caught the attention of many leaders in the French Church; and before long, members of the new Society staffed a number of new seminaries elsewhere in the country.

Sulpician priests contributed to the parish community during the day, but at night they would return to their institutions. Jean-Jacques Olier attempted to control diverse social groups by having laymen of the community give reports on family life, poverty, and disorder. The Sulpicians were very strict in regards to women and sexuality to the extent that they were eventually banned from the seminary unless it was for short visits in the external area with appropriate attire. The Sulpicians accepted aspirants to the company as long as they were priests and had permission from their bishop. The Sulpicians would thus recruit wealthy individuals since Sulpicians did not take vows of poverty. They retained ownership of individual property and were free to dispose their wealth. The Sulpicians soon came to be known for the revival of the parish life, reform of seminary life, and the revitalization of spirituality.

In the 18th century they attracted the sons of the nobility, as well as candidates from the common class, and produced a large number of the French bishops. The Séminaire de Saint-Sulpice was closed during the French Revolution, and its teachers and students scattered to avoid persecution. That Revolution also led to the secularization of the University of Paris. When France stabilized, theology courses were offered exclusively in seminaries, and the Sulpicians resumed their educational mission. Sulpician seminaries earned and maintained reputations for solid academic teaching and high moral tone. The Society spread from France to Canada, the United States and to several other foreign countries, including eventually to Vietnam and French Africa, where French Sulpician seminaries are found even today.

== In Canada ==

=== New France ===
The Sulpicians played a major role in the founding of the Canadian city of Montreal, where they engaged in missionary activities, trained priests and constructed the Saint-Sulpice Seminary.

The Société Notre-Dame de Montréal, of which Jean-Jacques Olier was an active founder, was granted the land of Montreal from the Company of One Hundred Associates, which owned New France, with the aim of converting the indigenous population and providing schools and hospitals for both them and the colonists. The Jesuits served as missionaries for the small colony until 1657 when Olier sent four priests from the Saint-Sulpice seminary in Paris to form the first parish. In 1663, France decided to substitute direct royal administration over New France for that hitherto exercised by the Company of One Hundred Associates, and in the same year the Société Notre-Dame de Montréal ceded its possessions to the Seminaire de Saint-Sulpice. Just as in Paris, the Montreal Sulpicians had important civil responsibilities. Most notably, they acted as seigneurs for the island of Montreal.

The Sulpicians served as missionaries, judges, explorers, schoolteachers, social workers, supervisors of convents, almsmen, canal builders, urban planners, colonization agents, and entrepreneurs. Despite their large role in society and their influence in shaping early Montreal, each night they would all return to the Saint-Sulpice Seminary. The administration of the Séminaire de Montreal was modeled on that of the Séminaire de Paris, in which the company was run by the superior, the four-man Consulting Council, and the Assembly of Twelve Assistants. According to the rules of the seminary in 1764, the superior, during his five-year renewable term, was to act like a father and was to be respected. The seminary kept careful records of all employees including birthday, place of birth, marital status, and salary. Female employees posed a particular problem since although a cheap source of labour, their presence in a male religious community was problematic. The superior of the Séminaire de Montréal was inherently also the Island of Montreal&#x27;s seigneur. In the case of M. Vachon de Belmont, who was responsible for the mission of La Montagne, sixth superior of the Montreal Sulpicians, the master designer of the fort and Sulpicians&#x27; residential château, and who was independently wealthy, was very well educated and had trained as draughtsman and architect, M. Belmont had a more than passing interest in military strategy and architecture. M. Belmont&#x27;s military strategy stamp is also evident in the implementation of the Sault-au-Récollet&#x27;s :fr:Fort Lorette and the seigneurie Lac-de-Deux-Montagnes&#x27; fort.

==== Early missionary work====
In 1668, several Sulpicians went to evangelize the Haudenosaunee in the Bay of Quinte, north of Lake Ontario, the Mi&#x27;kmaq in Acadia, the Haudenosaunee on the present site of Ogdensburg in the State of New York and, finally, the Algonquins in Abitibi and Témiscamingue. François Dollier de Casson and Brehan de Gallinée explored the region of the Great Lakes (1669), of which they made a map. In 1676 the mission of La Montagne was opened on the site of the present Séminaire de Montréal, where M. Belmont built a fort (1685). Alcohol traffic, major loss of mission housing by fire in 1694, and other factors necessitated the move of the first mission to one on the edge of the rivière des Prairies, near the Sault-au-Récollet rapids, in north end Montreal island. In 1717, the Compagnie de Saint-Sulpice de Paris was granted. a concession (~10.5 miles of frontage, ~9 miles deep) named seigneurie du Lac-des-Deux-Montagnes. In 1721, the Sulpicians moved the Sault-au-Récollet mission to two villages on seigneurie Lac-des-Deux-Montagnes territory; a first village to the west, which was their former hunting grounds and came to be called Kanesatake, was assigned to the Mohawks, and, later, a village to the east was assigned to the Algonquins and the Nipissings.

=== After the Conquest ===
On April 29, 1764, the Séminaire de Saint-Sulpice de Paris executed an act of donation giving all Canadian property to the Séminaire de Montréal making possible the survival of the Sulpicians to become British subjects, loyal to the Crown. In the wake of the Conquest of 1760, the Séminaire de Montreal thus became independent from the Séminaire de Saint-Sulpice de Paris. By contrast, since 1763, other male-affiliated religious orders deemed to be too dependent on France and Rome, that is, the Récollets and Jésuit orders, were prevented from recruiting members and these religious orders properties were confiscated to become British Crown property.

In 1794 after the French Revolution, twelve Sulpicians fled persecution by the National Convention and emigrated to Montreal, Quebec. According to Pierre-Auguste Fournet, the Sulpicians of Montreal would have died out had not the British Government opened Canada to the priests persecuted during the French Revolution.

After lengthy negotiations, in 1840 the British Crown recognized the possessions of the Sulpicians, the status of which had been ambiguous since the Conquest, while also providing for the gradual termination of the seigneurial regime. This enabled the Sulpicians to keep their holdings and continue their work, while allowing landowners who so desired to make a single final payment (&quot;commutation&quot;) and be relieved of all future seigneurial dues. Inauguration in 1825 of the Lachine Canal opened up markets to the United States&#x27; interior via the Erie Canal (opened in 1822), which in turn provided the impetus for the rapid sudden development of North America&#x27;s largest industrial park in the area known as Pointe-Saint-Charles, named after Charles le Moyne. A large part of Pointe-Saint-Charles was occupied by the Sulpicians&#x27; Saint-Gabriel Farm established in 1659 and named after the first superior, Gabriel de Queylus.

At the request of Bishop Ignace Bourget, in 1840 the Sulpicians took over the diocesan school of theology, creating the famous Grand Séminaire de Montréal. Since 1857 it has been located on Sherbrooke Street near Atwater Avenue. This operation enabled the Montreal Sulpicians to expand their primary work, the education of priests. They have trained innumerable priests and bishops, Canadian and American, down to the .

Canadian Sulpicians may be found operating in seminaries in Montreal and Edmonton. In 1972 the Canadian Province established a Provincial Delegation for Latin America, based in Bogotá, Colombia. In Latin America, the Society functions in Brazil (Brasília and Londrina) and Colombia (Cali, Cúcuta and Manizales). They have also served in Fukuoka, Japan since 1933.

In 2006, the Society of St. Sulpice of Montreal created Univers culturel de Saint-Sulpice, a non-profit organization whose mission is to ensure the preservation, accessibility and outreach of the archives, movable heritage assets and old and rare books of their community.

The rare book collections situated at the Grand Séminaire de Montréal Library (now Institut de formation théologique de Montréal), and the Séminaire Saint-Sulpice located in Old Montreal, host different collections from different institutions Sulpicians created from the 17th century to the 20th century (Séminaire Saint-Sulpice, Collège de Montréal, Grand Séminaire de Montréal, Séminaire de Philosophie, Collège pontifical canadien de Rome, and Collège André Grasset). These books span from the late Middle Ages to the mid 20th century. The works in these libraries were used for teaching and for the enrichment of knowledge on various subjects, allowing the Sulpicians to fulfill their mission as educators. These collections are an expression of scholarly culture. They provide information on the social and intellectual concerns of Quebec&#x27;s elites, on the evolution of ideas in many fields between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, and on the value of the education provided at the time. In 2021, these collections (including archives and moveable heritage assets) were added to the Cultural Heritage Act of Quebec.

== In the United States ==

Sulpicians set foot in what is now the United States as early as 1670 when Fathers Dollier de Casson and Brehan de Galinee from Brittany landed in what would later become Detroit, Michigan. In 1684 Robert de la Salle headed an ill-fated expedition from France to what is now Texas, taking with him three priests, all Sulpicians. These were Fathers Dollier de Casson, Brehan de Galinee, and Jean Cavelier, the explorer&#x27;s older brother. This expedition ended in failure, and the vessel carrying the three Sulpicians was shipwrecked in what is now the state of Texas. Among the survivors were the three Sulpicians, two of whom returned to France on the next available vessel. The third, Dollier de Casson, decided to remain to catechize the natives. This, after all, was a major motive for his coming. He met with little success in this endeavor, however, and finally decided to return to France as had his companions. His missionary zeal unslaked, he soon found a vessel to transfer him to the Sulpician enterprise in Montreal, which was quite successful and has endured down to the present day.
In July 1791, four Sulpicians, newly arrived from France, established the first Catholic institution for the training of clergy in the newly formed United States: St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary in Baltimore. They were Francis Charles Nagot, Anthony Gamier, Michael Levadoux, and John Tessier, who had fled the French Revolution. Purchasing the One Mile Tavern then on the edge of the city, they dedicated the house to the Blessed Virgin. In October they opened classes with five students whom they had brought from France, and thereby established the first enduring community of the Society in the nation.

In March, 1792 three more priests arrived, Abbé Chicoisneau, Abbé John Baptist Mary David, and Abbé Benedict Joseph Flaget. Two seminarians arrived with them, Stephen T. Badin and another named Barret. They were joined in June of that same year by the Abbés Ambrose Maréchal, Gabriel Richard and Francis Ciquard. Many of these early priests were sent as missionaries to remote areas of the United States and its territories. Flaget and David founded the Catholic Seminary of St. Thomas, at Bardstown, Kentucky. It was the first seminary west of the Appalachians. Their St. Thomas Catholic Church, built there in 1816, is the oldest surviving brick church in Kentucky. In 1796, Louis William Valentine Dubourg arrived and became the president of Georgetown University. Later he became the first bishop of the Louisiana Territory.

A decade later, Dubourg was instrumental in the transfer from New York City of the widow and recent convert Elizabeth Seton, who had been unsuccessful in her efforts to run a school, in part to care for her family. With his encouragement, she and other women drawn to the vision of caring for the poor in a religious way of life came to found the first American congregation of Sisters in 1809. The Sulpicians served as their religious superiors until 1850, when the original community located there chose to merge with another religious institute of Sisters. In 1829, Sulpician Fr. James Joubert worked with Mary Lange, a Haitian immigrant, to establish the first community of black sisters in the United States, the Oblate Sisters of Providence.

The Society helped to found and staff for a time St. John&#x27;s Seminary, part of the Archdiocese of Boston (1884–1911). In that same period, for a brief time they also staffed St. Joseph Seminary, serving the Archdiocese of New York (1896–1906). The Sulpicians who staffed that institution chose to leave the Society and become part of the archdiocese. Among their number was Francis Gigot.

In 1898, at the invitation of the Archbishop of San Francisco, Patrick William Riordan, the Sulpicians founded what was, until 2017, their primary institution on the West Coast, Saint Patrick Seminary, Menlo Park, California. From the 1920s until about 1971, the Society operated St. Edward Seminary in Kenmore, Washington. The grounds now form Saint Edward State Park and Bastyr University. For a brief period in the 1990s, the Sulpicians were also involved in teaching at St. John&#x27;s Seminary in Camarillo, the college seminary for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.

In 1917, the construction of the Sulpician Seminary began in Washington, D.C., next to The Catholic University of America. The seminary, which became an independent institution in 1924, changed its name to Theological College in 1940. It has graduated over 1,500 priests, including 45 bishops and four cardinals.
American Sulpicians gained a reputation for forward-thinking at certain points of their history, to the suspicion and dissatisfaction of more conservative members of the hierarchy. They were on the cutting edge of Vatican II thinking and thus gained both friends and enemies. A constant in the Sulpician seminaries has been an emphasis on personal spiritual direction and on collegial governance.

In 1989, U.S. Sulpicians began a collaborative approach to priestly formation with the bishops of Zambia. the American Province has several seminary placements in Zambia and a number of new Zambian Sulpicians and Candidates.

The American Province has also distinguished itself by producing several outstanding scholars and authors in the field of theology and scriptural studies. Among the most well-known was Scripture scholar Raymond E. Brown, S.S..

<doc id="1285375" wikidata="Q3828581" url="?curid=1285375" title="Hyperbolic metric space">
<text>In mathematics, a hyperbolic metric space is a metric space satisfying certain metric relations (depending quantitatively on a nonnegative real number δ) between points. The definition, introduced by Mikhael Gromov, generalizes the metric properties of classical hyperbolic geometry and of trees. Hyperbolicity is a large-scale property, and is very useful to the study of certain infinite groups called Gromov-hyperbolic groups.

== Definitions ==

In this paragraph we give various definitions of a formula_1-hyperbolic space. A metric space is said to be (Gromov-) hyperbolic if it is formula_1-hyperbolic for some formula_3.

=== Definition using the Gromov product ===
Let formula_4 be a metric space. The Gromov product of two points formula_5 with respect to a third one formula_6 is defined by the formula:

formula_7

Gromov&#x27;s definition of a hyperbolic metric space is then as follows: formula_8 is formula_1-hyperbolic if and only if all formula_10 satisfy the &quot;four-point condition&quot;

formula_11

Note that if this condition is satisfied for all formula_12 and one fixed base point formula_13, then it is satisfied for all formula_14 with a constant formula_15. Thus the hyperbolicity condition only needs to be verified for one fixed base point; for this reason, the subscript for the base point is often dropped from the Gromov product.

=== Definitions using triangles ===
Up to changing formula_1 by a constant multiple, there is an equivalent geometric definition involving triangles when the metric space formula_8 is &quot;geodesic&quot;, i.e. any two points formula_18 are end points of a geodesic segment formula_19 (an isometric image of a compact subinterval formula_20 of the reals). Note that the definition via Gromov products does not require the space to be geodesic.

Let formula_21. A geodesic triangle with vertices formula_22 is the union of three geodesic segments formula_23 (where formula_24 denotes a segment with endpoints formula_25 and formula_26).

If for any point formula_27 there is a point in formula_28 at distance less than formula_1 of formula_30, and similarly for points on the other edges, and formula_31 then the triangle is said to be &quot;formula_1-slim&quot; .

A definition of a formula_1-hyperbolic space is then a geodesic metric space all of whose geodesic triangles are formula_1-slim. This definition is generally credited to Eliyahu Rips.

Another definition can be given using the notion of a formula_35-approximate center of a geodesic triangle: this is a point which is at distance at most formula_35 of any edge of the triangle (an &quot;approximate&quot; version of the incenter). A space is formula_1-hyperbolic if every geodesic triangle has a formula_1-center.

These two definitions of a formula_1-hyperbolic space using geodesic triangles are not exactly equivalent, but there exists formula_40 such that a formula_1-hyperbolic space in the first sense is formula_42-hyperbolic in the second, and vice versa. Thus the notion of a hyperbolic space is independent of the chosen definition.

=== Examples ===

The hyperbolic plane is hyperbolic: in fact the incircle of a geodesic triangle is the circle of largest diameter contained in the triangle and every geodesic triangle lies in the interior of an ideal triangle, all of which are isometric with incircles of diameter 2 log 3. Note that in this case the Gromov product also has a simple interpretation in terms of the incircle of a geodesic triangle. In fact the quantity is just the hyperbolic distance from to either of the points of contact of the incircle with the adjacent sides: for from the diagram , so that 

The Euclidean plane is not hyperbolic, for example because of the existence of homotheties.

Two &quot;degenerate&quot; examples of hyperbolic spaces are spaces with bounded diameter (for example finite or compact spaces) and the real line.

Metric trees and more generally real trees are the simplest interesting examples of hyperbolic spaces as they are 0-hyperbolic (i.e. all triangles are tripods).

The 1-skeleton of the triangulation by Euclidean equilateral triangles is not hyperbolic (it is in fact quasi-isometric to the Euclidean plane). A triangulation of the plane formula_43 has a hyperbolic 1-skeleton if every vertex has degree 7 or more.

The two-dimensional grid is not hyperbolic (it is quasi-isometric to the Euclidean plane). It is the Cayley graph of the fundamental group of the torus; the Cayley graphs of the fundamental groups of a surface of higher genus is hyperbolic (it is in fact quasi-isometric to the hyperbolic plane).

=== Hyperbolicity and curvature ===

The hyperbolic plane (and more generally any Hadamard manifolds of sectional curvature formula_44) is formula_45-hyperbolic. If we scale the Riemannian metric by a factor formula_46 then the distances are multiplied by formula_47 and thus we get a space that is formula_48-hyperbolic. Since the curvature is multiplied by formula_49 we see that in this example the more (negatively) curved the space is, the lower the hyperbolicity constant.

Similar examples are CAT spaces of negative curvature. While curvature is a property that is essentially local, hyperbolicity is a large-scale property which does not see local (i.e. happening in a bounded region) metric phenomena. For example, the union of an hyperbolic space with a compact space with any metric extending the original ones remains hyperbolic.

== Important properties ==

=== Invariance under quasi-isometry ===

One way to make precise the meaning of &quot;large scale&quot; is to require invariance under quasi-isometry. This is true of hyperbolicity.

:&quot;If a geodesic metric space formula_50 is quasi-isometric to a formula_1-hyperbolic space formula_8 then there exists formula_53 such that formula_50 is formula_53-hyperbolic.&quot;

The constant formula_53 depends on formula_1 and on the multiplicative and additive constants for the quasi-isometry.

=== Approximate trees in hyperbolic spaces ===

The definition of an hyperbolic space in terms of the Gromov product can be seen as saying that the metric relations between any four points are the same as they would be in a tree, up to the additive constant formula_1. More generally the following property shows that any finite subset of an hyperbolic space looks like a finite tree.

:&quot;For any formula_59 there is a constant formula_35 such that the following holds: if formula_61 are points in a formula_1-hyperbolic space formula_8 there is a finite tree formula_64 and an embedding formula_65 such that formula_66 for all formula_67 and &quot;
formula_68

The constant formula_35 can be taken to be formula_70 with formula_71 and this is optimal.

=== Exponential growth of distance and isoperimetric inequalities ===

In an hyperbolic space formula_8 we have the following property:

:&quot;There are formula_73 such that for all formula_74 with formula_75, every path formula_76 joining formula_77 to formula_78 and staying at distance at least formula_79 of formula_25 has length at least formula_81. &quot;

Informally this means that the circumference of a &quot;circle&quot; of radius formula_79 grows exponentially with formula_79. This is reminiscent of the isoperimetric problem in the Euclidean plane. Here is a more specific statement to this effect.

:&quot;Suppose that formula_8 is a cell complex of dimension 2 such that its 1-skeleton is hyperbolic, and there exists formula_35 such that the boundary of any 2-cell contains at most formula_35 1-cells. Then there is a constant formula_46 such that for any finite subcomplex formula_88 we have &quot;
:: formula_89

Here the area of a 2-complex is the number of 2-cells and the length of a 1-complex is the number of 1-cells. The statement above is a linear isoperimetric inequality; it turns out that having such an isoperimetric inequality characterises Gromov-hyperbolic spaces. Linear isoperimetric inequalities were inspired by the small cancellation conditions from combinatorial group theory.

=== Quasiconvex subspaces ===

A subspace formula_50 of a geodesic metric space formula_8 is said to be quasiconvex if there is a constant formula_35 such that any geodesic in formula_8 between two points of formula_50 stays within distance formula_35 of formula_50.

:&quot;A quasi-convex subspace of an hyperbolic space is hyperbolic.&quot;

=== Asymptotic cones ===

All asymptotic cones of an hyperbolic space are real trees. This property characterises hyperbolic spaces.

== The boundary of a hyperbolic space ==

Generalising the construction of the ends of a simplicial tree there is a natural notion of boundary at infinity for hyperbolic spaces, which has proven very useful for analysing group actions.

In this paragraph formula_8 is a geodesic metric space which is hyperbolic.

=== Definition using the Gromov product ===

A sequence formula_98 is said to &quot;converge to infinity&quot; if for some (or any) point formula_25 we have that formula_100 as both formula_101 and formula_30 go to infinity. Two sequences formula_103 converging to infinity are considered equivalent when formula_104 (for some or any formula_25). The &quot;boundary&quot; of formula_8 is the set of equivalence classes of sequences which converge to infinity, which is denoted formula_107.

If formula_108 are two points on the boundary then their Gromov product is defined to be:

formula_109

which is finite iff formula_110. One can then define a topology on formula_107 using the functions formula_112. This topology on formula_107 is metrisable and there is a distinguished family of metrics defined using the Gromov product.

=== Definition for proper spaces using rays ===

Let formula_114 be two quasi-isometric embeddings of formula_115 into formula_8 (&quot;quasi-geodesic rays&quot;). They are considered equivalent if and only if the function formula_117 is bounded on formula_115. If the space formula_8 is proper then the set of all such embeddings modulo equivalence with its natural topology is homeomorphic to formula_107 as defined above.

A similar realisation is to fix a basepoint and consider only quasi-geodesic rays originating from this point. In case formula_8 is geodesic and proper one can also restrict to genuine geodesic rays.

=== Examples ===

When formula_122 is a simplicial regular tree the boundary is just the space of ends, which is a Cantor set. Fixing a point formula_123 yields a natural distance on formula_124: two points represented by rays formula_114 originating at formula_77 are at distance formula_127.

When formula_8 is the unit disk, i.e. the Poincaré disk model for the hyperbolic plane, the hyperbolic metric on the disk is

formula_129

and the Gromov boundary can be identified with the unit circle.

The boundary of formula_101-dimensional hyperbolic space is homeomorphic to the formula_131-dimensional sphere and the metrics are similar to the one above.

=== Busemann functions ===

If formula_8 is proper then its boundary is homeomorphic to the space of Busemann functions on formula_8 modulo translations.

=== The action of isometries on the boundary and their classification ===

A quasi-isometry between two hyperbolic spaces formula_134 induces a homeomorphism between the boundaries.

In particular the group of isometries of formula_8 acts by homeomorphisms on formula_107. This action can be used to classify isometries according to their dynamical behaviour on the boundary, generalising that for trees and classical hyperbolic spaces. Let formula_137 be an isometry of formula_8, then one of the following cases occur:

*First case: formula_137 has a bounded orbit on formula_8 (in case formula_8 is proper this implies that formula_137 has a fixed point in formula_8). Then it is called an &quot;elliptic&quot; isometry.
*Second case: formula_137 has exactly two fixed points formula_145 on formula_107 and every positive orbit formula_147 accumulates only at formula_148. Then formula_137 is called an &quot;hyperbolic&quot; isometry.
*Third case: formula_137 has exactly one fixed point on the boundary and all orbits accumulate at this point. Then it is called a &quot;parabolic&quot; isometry.

== More examples ==

Subsets of the theory of hyperbolic groups can be used to give more examples of hyperbolic spaces, for instance the Cayley graph of a small cancellation group. It is also known that the Cayley graphs of certain models of random groups (which is in effect a randomly-generated infinite regular graph) tend to be hyperbolic very often.

It can be difficult and interesting to prove that certain spaces are hyperbolic. For example, the following hyperbolicity results have led to new phenomena being discovered for the groups acting on them.

*The hyperbolicity of the curve complex has led to new results on the mapping class group.
*Similarly, the hyperbolicity of certain graphs associated to the outer automorphism group Out(Fn) has led to new results on this group.

<text>Gideon Ouseley (24 February 1762 – 13 May 1839) was born into an Anglican gentry family in Dunmore, County Galway.

==Biography==
His father, although a deist, intended that his son enter the clergy, but Ouseley spent much of his childhood in the cabins of peasant neighbours. He was tutored with his cousins Gore and William, and all three had notable careers.

Married at age 20, Ouseley led a wild life that dissipated both his own and his wife&#x27;s fortunes. After losing an eye when shot in a tavern brawl, a loss that reputedly left him with a frightening appearance, Ouseley left his wild ways behind him. In 1791 he was converted to Methodism by English soldiers stationed in Dunmore, and he set out in turn, to convert and reform others. Ouseley preached the gospel, mostly in Ulster, until his death, preaching up to 20 sermons a week. His knowledge of the Irish language and of peasant mores— not to mention his eccentric preaching astride a white horse— won him renown as Methodism&#x27;s &#x27;apostle to the Irish&#x27;.

*&quot;Four letters&quot; (1829)

Oliver St. John Gogarty wrote an autobiographical novel &quot;Tumbling in the Hay&quot; and two plays under the pseudonym Gideon Ouseley, &quot;A Serious Thing&quot; and &quot;The Enchanted Trousers&quot;.

The writer John Mulvey Ousley was of a later generation of the same family.
