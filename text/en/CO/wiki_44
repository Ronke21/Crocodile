<text>Bordetella () is a genus of small (0.2 – 0.7 μm), Gram-negative, coccobacilli bacteria of the phylum Pseudomonadota. &quot;Bordetella&quot; species, with the exception of &quot;B. petrii&quot;, are obligate aerobes, as well as highly fastidious, or difficult to culture. All species can infect humans. The first three species to be described (&quot;B. pertussis&quot;, &quot;B. parapertussis&quot;, &quot;B. bronchiseptica&quot;) are sometimes referred to as the &#x27;classical species&#x27;. Two of these (&quot;B. pertussis&quot; and &quot;B. bronchiseptica&quot;) are also motile.

There are about 16 different species of &quot;Bordetella&quot; likely descending from ancestors who lived in soil and/or water environments. &quot;B. pertussis&quot; and occasionally &quot;B. parapertussis&quot; cause pertussis (whooping cough) in humans, and some &quot;B. parapertussis&quot; strains only colonize sheep. It has also been known to cause bronchitis in cats and bronchopneumonia in pigs.

&quot;B. bronchiseptica&quot; rarely infects healthy humans, though disease in immunocompromised patients has been reported. &quot;B. bronchiseptica&quot; causes several diseases in other mammals, including kennel cough in dogs and atrophic rhinitis in pigs. Other members of the genus cause similar diseases in other mammals, and in birds (&quot;B. hinzii&quot;, &quot;B. avium&quot;).

The genus &quot;Bordetella&quot; is named after Jules Bordet.

==Pathogenesis==
The three most common species of &quot;Bordetella&quot; are &quot;B. pertussis&quot;, &quot;B. parapertussis&quot; and &quot;B. bronchiseptica&quot;. These species are known to accumulate in the respiratory tracts of mammals. This is most commonly seen in human infants as a product of an illness known as whooping cough. The particular species responsible for this illness is &quot;B. pertussis&quot;, and can only be found in humans. Even with extensive vaccination research on &quot;B. pertussis&quot;, whooping cough is still considered endemic in many countries. Due to the fact &quot;B. pertussis&quot; is only found in humans and shows little genetic variation from the other &quot;Bordetella&quot; species, it is thought that it was derived from a common ancestor in recent years.

&quot;B. parapertussis&quot; can affect both humans and other mammals, primarily sheep. Similar to &quot;B. pertussis&quot;, it causes whooping cough in babies. Yet, when strains found in sheep are isolated there is a strong distinction between those found in humans. This suggests that the varying strains of this species evolved independently of one another, the one found in humans and the one found in sheep. With this particular distinction it means that there is little to no transmission between the two reservoirs.

The species &quot;B. bronchiseptica&quot; (gram-negative, aerobic) however has a broader host range, causing similar symptoms in a wide range of animals, while only occasionally affecting humans. These symptoms often manifest as chronic and asymptomatic respiratory infections. &quot;B. bronchiseptica&quot; is a small, coccobacillus shape sized at approximately 0.5 μm. It has peritrichous flagella that enables it to be motile. On a petri dish, colonies of this species appear small, grayish-white, smooth, and shiny. This species is also typically associated with kennel cough (Canine Respiratory Infectious Disease (CRID)) in dogs.

The most thoroughly studied of the &quot;Bordetella&quot; species are &quot;B. bronchiseptica&quot;, &quot;B. pertussis&quot; and &quot;B. parapertussis&quot;, and the pathogenesis of respiratory disease caused by these bacteria has been reviewed. Transmission occurs by direct contact, via respiratory aerosol droplets, or fomites. Bacteria initially adhere to ciliated epithelial cells in the nasopharynx, and this interaction with epithelial cells is mediated by a series of protein adhesins.. These include filamentous haemaglutinin, pertactin, fimbriae, and pertussis toxin (though expression of pertussis toxin is unique to &quot;B. pertussis&quot;). As well as assisting in adherence to epithelial cells, some of these are also involved in attachment to immune effector cells.

The initial catarrhal phase of infection produces symptoms similar to those of the common cold, and during this period, large numbers of bacteria can be recovered from the pharynx. Thereafter, the bacteria proliferate and spread further into the respiratory tract, where the secretion of toxins causes ciliostasis and facilitates the entry of bacteria to tracheal/bronchial ciliated cells. One of the first toxins to be expressed is tracheal cytotoxin, which is a disaccharide-tetrapeptide derived from peptidoglycan. Unlike most other &quot;Bordetella&quot; toxins, tracheal cytotoxin is expressed constitutively, being a normal product of the breakdown of the bacterial cell wall. Other bacteria recycle this molecule back into the cytoplasm, but in &quot;Bordetella&quot; and &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot;, it is released into the environment. Tracheal cytotoxin itself is able to reproduce paralysis of the ciliary escalator, inhibition of DNA synthesis in epithelial cells and ultimately killing of the same. One of the most important of the regulated toxins is adenylate cyclase toxin, which aids in the evasion of innate immunity. The toxin is delivered to phagocytic immune cells upon contact. Immune cell functions are then inhibited in part by the resulting accumulation of cyclic AMP. Recently discovered activities of adenylate cyclase toxin, including transmembrane pore formation and stimulation of calcium influx, may also contribute to the intoxication of phagocytes.

==Virulence factors==
The virulence factors identified in the &quot;Bordetella&quot; are common to all three species. These include adhesins, such as filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), pertactin, tracheal colonization factor and fimbriae, and toxins, such as adenylate cyclase-hemolysin, dermonecrotic toxin and tracheal cytotoxin. These factors are then expressed and regulated most often by environmental stimuli. Differences in virulence factors relate to the loss of regulatory or control functions. &quot;Bordetella sp.&quot; is typically found to live within the hosts&#x27; respiratory tract and immune system and can transmit to new hosts. &quot;Bordetella pertussis&quot; also affects human adults and even with an 85% vaccination coverage over 160,000 related deaths occur each year all around the globe. There are few antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods but no change or progress have been discovered as of 2018. Most studies performed using &quot;Bordetella&quot; vaccines have many flaws and fail to come to an official conclusion.

==Regulation of virulence factor expression==
The expression of many &quot;Bordetella&quot; adhesins and toxins is controlled by the two-component regulatory system BvgAS. Much of what is known about this regulatory system is based on work with &quot;B. bronchiseptica&quot;, but BvgAS is present in &quot;B. pertussis&quot;, &quot;B. parapertussis&quot; and &quot;B. bronchiseptica&quot; and is responsible for phase variation or phenotypic modulation.

BvgS is a plasma membrane-bound sensor kinase which responds to stimulation by phosphorylating a cytoplasmic helix-turn-helix-containing protein, BvgA. When phosphorylated, BvgA has increased affinity for specific binding sites in Bvg-activated promoter sequences and is able to promote transcription in &quot;in vitro&quot; assays.

Most of the toxins and adhesins under BvgAS control are expressed under Bvg+ conditions (high BvgA-Pi concentration). But there are also genes expressed solely in the Bvg− state, most notably the flagellin gene &quot;flaA&quot;. The regulation of Bvg repressed genes is mediated by the product of a 624-bp open reading frame downstream of B&quot;vgA&quot;, the so-called Bvg-activated repressor protein, BvgR. BvgR binds to a consensus sequence present within the coding sequences of at least some Bvg-repressed genes. Binding of this protein to the consensus sequence represents gene expression by reducing transcription.

It is not known what the physiological signals for BvgS are, but &quot;in vitro&quot; BvgAS can be inactivated by millimolar concentrations of magnesium sulfate or nicotinic acid, or by reduction of the incubation temperature to ≤ 26 °C.

The identification of a specific point mutation in the BvgS gene which locks &quot;B. bronchiseptica&quot; in an intermediate Bvg phase revealed a class of BvgAS-regulated genes that are exclusively transcribed under intermediate concentrations of BvgA-Pi. This intermediate (Bvgi) phenotype can be reproduced in wild-type &quot;B. bronchiseptica&quot; by growth of the bacteria in a medium containing intermediate concentrations of the BvgAS modulator, nicotinic acid. In these conditions, some, but not all of the virulence factors associated with the Bvg+ phase are expressed, suggesting this two-component regulatory system can give rise to a continuum of phenotypic states in response to the environment.

==Vaccines==
The &quot;Bordetella&quot; vaccine is non-essential, but highly recommended for dogs especially if they are expected to come into contact with other dogs at dog parks, boarding facilities, dog shows, training classes, etc. In fact, it can be required at certain facilities for entry. The vaccine can also be given to cats, but it is less commonly done because infection appears to be uncommon in adult cats. However, it may be a good idea to vaccinate a kitten if it is in a high-risk environment (i.e. living with multiple other cats).

The &quot;Bordetella&quot; vaccine specifically targets &quot;Bordetella bronchiseptica&quot;, the species typically responsible for kennel cough. The vaccine introduces the bacteria (live or dead) to the body in order to develop an immunity. It is important to remember that the vaccine only protects against one species of &quot;Bordetella&quot;. Therefore, it is possible for a pet to become infected with another &quot;Bordetella&quot; species or contract kennel cough from another source, such as the parainfluenza virus, even after being vaccinated for &quot;B. bronchiseptica&quot;. The &quot;Bordetella&quot; vaccine is also only about 70% effective.

There are three licensed ways to deliver the &quot;Bordetella&quot; vaccine to dogs: orally, intranasally, and subcutaneously. The two former methods are administered using live bacteria, while the latter is done with a killed bacteria. A comparative study done in 2013 by the School of Veterinary Medicine in Madison, Wisconsin studied the effectiveness of these three methods by vaccinating beagle puppies. The 40 beagles were divided into four groups; a group to test each of the three methods, plus one unvaccinated control group. After 42 days, the dogs were exposed to &quot;Bordetella bronchiseptica&quot;. This study determined that the live intranasal &quot;Bordetella&quot; vaccine was more effective than the killed subcutaneous vaccine, and the live oral vaccine works equally as well as the live intranasal vaccine.

<text>Makro is a Dutch international brand of warehouse clubs, also called cash and carry stores. Makro was founded by SHV Holdings, a Dutch conglomerate based in Utrecht in partnership with German company Metro AG, with the first warehouse club opened in Amsterdam in 1968. Currently, ownership of the worldwide chain of stores is split between different companies like Metro AG in Europe (except UK), SHV Holdings in Latin America (except Peru) and CP All in Asia. In many countries, access to stores is restricted to business customers, and the stores are not open to the general public.

== History ==
SHV originated in 1896 from a merger between a number of large coal mining companies, some of which had been active since the 18th century.

In 1968, the first Makro store opened in Amsterdam. In the following years more stores opened in the Netherlands and several other European countries.
In April 1971 the first Makro in the UK opened in Eccles, Manchester. Also in 1971, the first Makro store outside Europe opened in South Africa.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Makro extended its business to the Americas and Asia. Makro had also expanded to the United States in the mid-1980s. In 1989, Kmart bought the US locations, and converted most of them to Pace Warehouse in 1990.

Makro expanded to Asia with its first store in Thailand in 1989. Operating as Siam Makro, the company is a joint venture between Charoen Pokphand and SHV Holdings. In 1994, Siam Makro planned to be listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand to fund an expansion programme.

The South African stores were subsequently in 1990 exchanged for a shareholding in Massmart and in 2004 SHV sold its Massmart shares.

Makro began operations in Malaysia around 1994 with its first outlet in Shah Alam, followed by another one in Selayang and in Johor Bahru. Makro Malaysia was a partnership between its parent Dutch company, the Selangor State Development Corporation (PKNS) and PKNS-Inchcape (a joint venture between PKNS and Inchcape). In its first year of operation, Makro Malaysia invested a total of RM 90 million. It had plans to open six to eight outlets in a few years.

In 1998, owner SHV Holdings sold the Makro stores in Europe to German partner Metro AG. The sale, announced on 29 October 1997, was approved by the supervisory board of Metro AG on 17 December 1997.

Makro entered the Philippine market in 1996 through a joint venture with SM Prime Holdings and the Ayala Group. In 2004, Ayala sold its 28% stake to its joint venture partners. By late 2007, SM Investments Corporation increased its ownership in Pilipinas Makro to 60% and subsequently integrated Makro stores into its operations. Eventually, the SM Group of Companies acquired full ownership of Makro and rebranded all its stores as SM Hypermarket and SM Savemore.

On 31 January 2007, Makro Malaysia was acquired by Tesco and the 8 stores in Malaysia were converted to Tesco Extra.

In 2010, Makro Cash &amp; Carry Indonesia was sold to Lotte Mart and rebranded as Lotte Mart Wholesale.

In 2011 Walmart took ownership of Makro in South Africa after acquiring a majority stake in Massmart (which Walmart would fully acquire later in the year).

In 2012, Metro sold the Makro UK business to Booker Group, while Makro-Habib in Pakistan was rebranded as Metro-Habib.

In 2013, SHV sold Siam Makro Pcl. (Thailand) to CP ALL, a subsidiary of CP Group.

In 2014, Metro sold the Makro Greek business to Sklavenitis and rebranded as The Mart in 2016.

In 2020, 30 of 54 Makro stores in Brazil, were acquired by Carrefour.

In December 2022, Makro Cash &amp; Carry Belgium went bankrupt in Belgium. All 6 shops closed permanently.

== Store locations ==
European stores can be found in the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom. Stores have spread to Colombia, South Africa, Argentina, Peru, Venezuela, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Thailand.

Makro stores formerly existed in China, Greece, Belgium, Indonesia, Malaysia, Morocco, Pakistan, Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States.

===Netherlands===
Makro Netherlands operates 17 stores across the Netherlands, with seven of the stores also containing a fuel station. Makro Netherlands is owned by the Metro Group. Since January 2018, The Chief Executive Officer is Paulo Peerenboom.

===Thailand===
CP Axtra Public Company Limited was established in 1988. At the end of April 2020 there were 100 Makro stores and Makro FoodService stores in operation, serving a registered customer base of 2.6 million. Revenues for 2020 were 210 billion baht with a net profit of 6.2 billion baht. Siam Makro shares are traded on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET).

In 2013, Siam Makro was purchased by Charoen Pokphand Group for US$6.6 billion. CP Axtra (known as Siam Makro until 2023) is owned by CP ALL, a subsidiary of CP Group.
===United Kingdom===
Makro UK operates 30 branches across the United Kingdom. Since 2012 Makro UK has been owned by Booker Group, and 11 of the Makro branches now operate as a combined Booker/Makro.

===Venezuela===
SVH operates 35 Makro warehouse clubs across the country and also have a supermarket chain named Mikro with 19 stores.

===Spain===
* Makro España was founded in 1972
* Operates 37 stores in 15 different regions
* Had a total of 3700 employees (2021)
* 2021 sales was €1097 million

== Product range ==

Makro sells food and non-food products, usually located in different sections of the store. Each store also contains a hot-food cafeteria, and a cash machine.

The food section always includes a fresh fish section, a wine section, fresh meat and butchery department, and refrigerated aisles. The non-food area includes clothing, DIY, office supplies, electricals, computing, and seasonals such as garden furniture.

Special offers are featured via a printed and online fortnight brochure known as Makro Mail.

The stores are not open to the general public, but serve the following trades:

* Newsagent&#x27;s shops and convenience stores.
* Restaurants, hotels and caterers.
* Schools, universities, sport clubs and associations.

Customers can shop at Makro with a membership card.

Makro UK used to have the tag-line &quot;The UK&#x27;s No.1 Discounter&quot;. This tag-line was replaced with &quot;For Professionals&quot;. Makro has subsequently changed this to &quot;Your business partner everyday&quot; [sic].

Recent changes to the Makro UK structure include the closure of three stores: Wolverhampton, Coventry and Swansea. Metro announced that the company has to be financially independent by 2011, and in 2012 Makro UK was sold to the rival wholesaler Booker Group in an agreement valued at around £140 million.

<doc id="1283638" wikidata="Q12189" url="?curid=1283638" title="Canopus">
<text>Canopus is the brightest star in the southern constellation of Carina and the second-brightest star in the night sky. It is also designated α Carinae, which is romanized (transliterated) to Alpha Carinae. With a visual apparent magnitude of −0.74, it is outshone only by Sirius.

Located around from the Sun, Canopus is a bright giant of spectral type A9, so it is essentially white when seen with the naked eye. It has a luminosity over 10,000 times the luminosity of the Sun, is eight times as massive, and has expanded to 71 times the Sun&#x27;s radius. Its enlarged photosphere has an effective temperature of around . Canopus is undergoing core helium burning and is currently in the so-called blue loop phase of its evolution, having already passed through the red-giant branch after exhausting the hydrogen in its core. Canopus is a source of X-rays, which are likely being emitted from its corona.

The prominent appearance of Canopus means it has been the subject of mythological lore among many ancient peoples. Its proper name is generally considered to originate from the mythological Canopus, who was a navigator for Menelaus, king of Sparta. The acronycal rising marked the date of the Ptolemaia festival in Egypt. In ancient India, it was named Agastya after the revered Vedic sage. For Chinese astronomers, it was known as the Old Man of the South Pole. In Islamic astronomy, it is Suhail or Suhayl, a name that is also commonly used to imply rareness of appearance (as the Canopus infrequently appeared to a gazer at Middle Eastern latitutes)

==Nomenclature==
The name &quot;Canopus&quot; is a Latinisation of the Ancient Greek name Κάνωβος/Kanôbos, recorded in Claudius Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot; (c.150 AD). Eratosthenes used the same spelling. Hipparchos wrote it as Κάνωπος. John Flamsteed wrote Canobus, as did Edmond Halley in his 1679 &quot;Catalogus Stellarum Australium&quot;. The name has two possible derivations, both listed in Richard Hinckley Allen&#x27;s seminal &quot;Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning&quot;.

* The brightest star in the obsolete constellation of Argo Navis, which represented the ship used by Jason and the Argonauts, was given the name of a ship&#x27;s pilot from another Greek legend: Canopus, pilot of Menelaus&#x27; ship on his quest to retrieve Helen of Troy after she was taken by Paris.
* A ruined ancient Egyptian port named Canopus lies near the mouth of the Nile, site of the Battle of the Nile. It is speculated that its name is derived from the Egyptian Coptic &quot;Kahi Nub&quot; (&quot;Golden Earth&quot;), which refers to how Canopus would have appeared near the horizon in ancient Egypt, reddened by atmospheric extinction from that position.

In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included &quot;Canopus&quot; for this star. Canopus is now included in the &quot;IAU Catalog of Star Names&quot;.

Canopus traditionally marked the steering oar of the ship Argo Navis. German celestial cartographer Johann Bayer gave it—as the brightest star in the constellation—the designation of &quot;α Argus&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Alpha Argus&quot;) in 1603. In 1763, French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille divided the huge constellation into three smaller ones, and hence Canopus became &quot;α Carinae&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Alpha Carinae&quot;). It is listed in the Bright Star Catalogue as HR 2326, the Henry Draper Catalogue as HD 45348, and the Hipparcos catalogue as HIP 30438. Flamsteed did not number this southern star, but Benjamin Apthorp Gould gave it the number 7 (7 G. Carinae) in his &quot;Uranometria Argentina&quot;.

An occasional name seen in English is &quot;Soheil&quot;, or the feminine Soheila; in Turkish is &quot;Süheyl&quot;, or the feminine Süheyla, from the Arabic name for several bright stars, سهيل &quot;suhayl&quot;, and Canopus was known as Suhel in medieval times. Alternative spellings include Suhail, Souhail, Suhilon, Suheyl, Sohayl, Sohail, Suhayil, Shoel, Sohil, Soheil, Sahil, Suhayeel, Sohayil, Sihel, and Sihil. An alternative name was &quot;Wazn&quot; &quot;weight&quot; or &quot;Haḍar&quot; &quot;ground&quot; , implying the anchor stone used by ship, rather than being related to its low position near the horizon. Hence comes its name in the &quot;Alfonsine tables&quot;, Suhel ponderosus, a Latinization of &quot;Al Suhayl al Wazn&quot;. Its Greek name was revived during the Renaissance.

==Observation==

The Arabic Muslim astronomer Ibn Rushd went to Marrakesh (in Morocco) to observe the star in 1153, as it was invisible in his native Córdoba, Al-Andalus. He used the different visibility in different latitudes to argue that the Earth is round, following Aristotle&#x27;s argument which held that such an observation was only possible if the Earth was a relatively small sphere.

English explorer Robert Hues brought Canopus to the attention of European observers in his 1592 work &quot;Tractatus de Globis&quot;, along with Achernar and Alpha Centauri, noting:&quot;Now, therefore, there are but three Stars of the first magnitude that I could perceive in all those parts which are never seene here in England. The first of these is that bright Star in the sterne of Argo which they call Canobus. The second is in the end of Eridanus. The third is in the right foote of the Centaure.&quot;
In the Southern Hemisphere, Canopus and Sirius are both visible high in the sky simultaneously, and reach a meridian just apart. Brighter than first magnitude, Canopus can be seen by naked eye in the early twilight. Mostly visible in mid to late summer in the Southern Hemisphere, Canopus culminates at midnight on December 27, and at 9 PM on February 11.

When seen from latitudes south of  S, Canopus is a circumpolar star. Since Canopus is so far south in the sky, it never rises in mid- to far-northern latitudes; in theory the northern limit of visibility is latitude north. This is just south of Athens, San Francisco, and Seoul, and very close to Seville and Agrigento. It is almost exactly the latitude of Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton, California, from which it is readily visible because of the effects of elevation and atmospheric refraction, which add another degree to its apparent altitude. Under ideal conditions, it can be spotted as far north as latitude from the Pacific coast. Another northernmost record of visibility came from Mount Nemrut in Turkey, latitude . It is more easily visible in places such as the Gulf Coast and Florida, and the island of Crete (Greece) where the best season for viewing it around 9 p.m. is during late January and early February.

Canopus has a B–V color index of +0.15—where 0 is a blue-white—indicating it is essentially white, although it has been described as yellow-white. Canopus&#x27; spectral type has been given as F0 and the incrementally warmer A9. It is less yellow than Altair or Procyon, with indices measured as 0.22 and 0.42, respectively. Some observers may have perceived Canopus as yellow-tinged because it is low in the sky and hence subject to atmospheric effects. Patrick Moore said that it never appeared anything but white to him. The bolometric correction for Canopus is 0.00, indicating that the visual absolute magnitude and bolometric absolute magnitude are equal.

Canopus was previously proposed to be a member of the Scorpius–Centaurus association, however it is not located near the subgroups of that association, and has not been included as a Sco-Cen member in kinematic studies that used Hipparcos astrometric data. Canopus is not thought to be a member of any nearby young stellar groups. In 2014, astronomer Eric Mamajek reported that an extremely magnetically active M dwarf (having strong coronal X-ray emission), 1.16 degrees south of Canopus, appears to share a common proper motion with Canopus. The projected separation of the M dwarf 2MASS J06234738-5351131 (&quot;Canopus B&quot;) is approximately 1.9 parsecs. However, despite this large separation, it is still within the estimated tidal radius (2.9 parsecs) for the massive star Canopus.

Since it is more luminous than any star closer to Earth, Canopus has been the brightest star in the night sky during three epochs over the past four million years. Other stars appear brighter only during relatively temporary periods, during which they are passing the Solar System much closer than Canopus. About 90,000 years ago, Sirius moved close enough that it became brighter than Canopus, and that will remain so for another 210,000 years. But in 480,000 years, as Sirius moves further away and appears fainter, Canopus will once again be the brightest, and will remain so for a period of about 510,000 years.

===Role in navigation===

The southeastern wall of the Kaaba in Mecca is aligned with the rising point of Canopus, and is also named &quot;Janūb&quot;. The Bedouin people of the Negev and Sinai knew Canopus as &quot;Suhayl&quot;, and used it and Polaris as the two principal stars for navigation at night. Because it disappears below the horizon in those regions, it became associated with a changeable nature, as opposed to always-visible Polaris, which was circumpolar and hence &#x27;steadfast&#x27;.

The south celestial pole can be approximately located using Canopus and two different bright stars. The first, Achernar, makes an equilateral triangle between the stars and the south pole. One can also locate the pole more roughly using an imaginary line between Sirius and Canopus; Canopus will be approximately at the midpoint, being one way to Sirius and to the pole.

Canopus&#x27;s brightness and location well off the ecliptic make it useful for space navigation. Many spacecraft carry a special camera known as a &quot;Canopus Star Tracker&quot; plus a Sun sensor for attitude determination. Mariner 4 used Canopus for second axis stabilisation (after locking on the Sun) in 1964, the first time a star had been used.

==Spectrum==
Canopus was little-studied by western scientists before the 20th century. It was given a spectral class of F in 1897, an early use of this extension to Secchi class I, applied to those stars where the hydrogen lines are relatively weak and the calcium K line relatively strong. It was given as a standard star of F0 in the Henry Draper Catalogue, with the spectral type F0 described as having hydrogen lines half the strength of an A0 star and the calcium K line three times as strong as Hδ. American astronomer Jesse Greenstein was interested in stellar spectra and used the newly built Otto Struve Telescope at McDonald Observatory to analyze the star&#x27;s spectrum in detail. In a 1942 paper, he reported that the spectrum is dominated by strong broad hydrogen lines. There are also absorption lines of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur, iron, and many ionised metals. It was studied in the ultraviolet by an early astronomical satellite, Gemini XI in 1966. The UV spectra were considered to be consistent with an F0 supergiant having a temperature of , the accepted parameters for Canopus at the time. New Zealand-based astronomers John Hearnshaw and Krishna Desikachary examined the spectrum in greater detail, publishing their results in 1982.

When luminosity classes were added to the MK spectral classification scheme, Canopus was assigned class Iab indicating an intermediate luminosity supergiant. This was based on the relative strengths of certain spectral lines understood to be sensitive to the luminosity of a star. In the Bright Star Catalogue 5th edition it is given the spectral class F0II, the luminosity class indicating a bright giant. Balmer line profiles and oxygen line strengths indicate the size and luminosity of Canopus.

When the effects of stellar rotation speed on spectral lines are accounted for, the MK spectral class of Canopus is adjusted to A9II. Its spectrum consists mostly of absorption lines on a visible continuum, but some emission has been detected. For example, the calcium K line has weak emission wings on each side of the strong central absorption line, first observed in 1966. The emission line profiles are usually correlated with the luminosity of the star as described by the Wilson-Bappu effect, but in the case of Canopus they indicate a luminosity much lower than that calculated by other methods. More detailed observations have shown that the emission line profiles are variable and may be due to plage areas on the surface of the star. Emission can also be found in other lines such as the h and k lines of ionised magnesium.

==Distance==
Before the launch of the Hipparcos satellite telescope, distance estimates for Canopus varied widely, from 96 light-years to 1200 light-years (or 30 to 370 parsecs). For example, an old distance estimate of 200 parsecs (652 light years) gave it a luminosity of , far higher than modern estimates. The closer distance was derived from parallax measurements of around . The larger distance derives from the assumption of a very bright absolute magnitude for Canopus.

Hipparcos established Canopus as being () from the Solar System; this is based on its 2007 parallax measurement of . At 95 parsecs, the interstellar extinction for Canopus is low at 0.26 magnitudes. Canopus is too bright to be included in the normal observation runs of the Gaia satellite and there is no published Gaia parallax for it.

At present the star is drifting further away from the Sun with a radial velocity of 20 km/s. Some 3.1 million years ago it made the closest approach to the Sun at a distance of about . Canopus is orbiting the Milky Way with a heliocentric velocity of 24.5 km/s and a low eccentricity of 0.065.

==Physical characteristics==

The absorption lines in the spectrum of Canopus shift slightly with a period of . This was first detected in 1906 and the Doppler variations were interpreted as orbital motion. An orbit was even calculated, but no such companion exists and the small radial velocity changes are due to movements in the atmosphere of the star. The maximum observed radial velocities are only 0.7 to . Canopus also has a magnetic field that varies with the same period, detected by the Zeeman splitting of its spectral lines. Canopus is bright at microwave wavelengths, one of the few F-class stars to be detected by radio. The rotation period of the star is not accurately known, but may be over three hundred days. The projected rotational velocity has been measured at 9 km/s.

An early interferometric measurement of its angular diameter in 1968 gave a limb-darkened value of , close to the accepted modern value. Very-long-baseline interferometry has been used to calculate Canopus&#x27; angular diameter at . Combined with distance calculated from its Hipparcos parallax, this gives it a radius of 71 times that of the Sun. If it were at the centre of the Solar System, it would extend 90% of the way to the orbit of Mercury. The radius and temperature relative to the Sun means that it is 10,700 times more luminous than the Sun, and its position in the H-R diagram relative to theoretical evolutionary tracks means that it is times as massive as the Sun. Measurements of its shape find a 1.1° departure from spherical symmetry.

Canopus is a source of X-rays, which are probably produced by its corona, magnetically heated to several million Kelvin. The temperature has likely been stimulated by fast rotation combined with strong convection percolating through the star&#x27;s outer layers. The soft X-ray sub-coronal X-ray emission is much weaker than the hard X-ray coronal emission. The same behaviour has been measured in other F-class supergiants such as α Persei and is now believed to be a normal property of such stars.

== Evolution ==
The spectrum of Canopus indicates that it spent some 30 million years of its existence as a blue-white main sequence star of around 10 solar masses, before exhausting its core hydrogen and evolving away from the main sequence. The position of Canopus in the H–R diagram indicates that it is currently in the core-helium burning phase. It is an intermediate mass star that has left the red-giant branch before its core became degenerate and is now in a blue loop. Models of stellar evolution in the blue loop phase show that the length of the blue loop is strongly affected by rotation and mixing effects inside the star. It is difficult to determine whether a star is currently evolving towards hotter temperature or returning to cooler temperatures, since the evolutionary tracks for stars with different masses overlap during the blue loops.

Canopus lies on the warm side of the instability strip and does not pulsate like Cepheid variables of a similar luminosity. However its atmosphere does appear to be unstable, showing strong signs of convection.

Canopus may be massive enough to explode by an iron-core collapse supernova.

==Cultural significance ==
Canopus was known to the ancient Mesopotamians and represented the city of Eridu in the &quot;Three Stars Each&quot; Babylonian star catalogues and later MUL.APIN around 1100 BC. Canopus was called MUL.NUNKI by the Babylonians, which translates as &quot;star of the city of Eridu&quot;. Eridu was the southernmost and one of the oldest Sumerian cities. From there is a good view to the south, so that about 6000 years ago due to the precession of the Earth&#x27;s axis the first rising of the star Canopus in Mesopotamia could be observed only from there at the southern meridian at midnight.

Today, the star Sigma Sagittarii is known by the common name Nunki.

Canopus was not visible to the mainland ancient Greeks and Romans; it was, however, visible to the ancient Egyptians. Hence Aratus did not write of the star as it remained below the horizon, while Eratosthenes and Ptolemy—observing from Alexandria—did, calling it &quot;Kanōbos&quot;. An Egyptian priestly poet in the time of Thutmose III mentions the star as &quot;Karbana,&quot; &quot;the star which pours his light in a glance of fire, when he disperses the morning dew.&quot; Under the Ptolemies, the star was known as &quot;Ptolemaion&quot; (Greek: Πτολεμαῖον) and its acronychal rising marked the date of the Ptolemaia festival, which was held every four years, from 262 to 145 BC.

The Greek astronomer Posidonius used observations of Canopus to calculate quite accurately the Earth&#x27;s circumference, around 90 – 120 BC.

===India===
In Indian Vedic literature, Canopus is associated with the sage Agastya, one of the ancient siddhars and rishis (the others are associated with the stars of the Big Dipper). To Agastya, the star is said to be the &#x27;cleanser of waters&#x27;, and its rising coincides with the calming of the waters of the Indian Ocean. Canopus is described by Pliny the Elder and Gaius Julius Solinus as the largest, brightest and only source of starlight for navigators near Tamraparni island (ancient Sri Lanka) during many nights.
===Iran (Persia)===
Canopus, known as Suhail (سُهَيْل) in Arabic and Soheil (سهیل) in Farsi, holds significant cultural importance in Iran. Its visibility in Iran varies due to the country&#x27;s range of latitudes. For instance, in the Alborz Mountains, at approximately 36°N latitude, Canopus rises just one degree above the southern horizon, making it a rare sight. This rarity has led to the Persian expression &quot;ستاره سهیل شدن&quot; (&quot;becoming the star Soheil&quot;), used to describe someone who is seldom seen or elusive. The term &quot;Soheil&quot; symbolizes rarity in Persian literature, reflecting the star&#x27;s infrequent visibility in the region. 
Ferdowsi references Canopus in his poetry, associating it with Yemen:
&lt;poem&gt;
ز سر تا بپایش گلست و سمن 
به سرو سهی بر سهیل یمن 
&lt;/poem&gt;
Ze sar tā be-pāyash golast o saman 
Be sarv-e sehī bar Sohayl-e Yaman 
&lt;poem&gt;
From head to toe, she is adorned with flowers and jasmine, 
Like the tall cypress under the Canopus of Yemen.
&lt;/poem&gt;
Ferdowsi uses Canopus as a metaphor for beauty and rarity, linking it to Yemen, where the star is visible.
The star&#x27;s name also appears in Persian literary works, such as Anvār-i Suhaylī (انوار سهیلی) (&quot;Lights of Canopus&quot;), a 15th-century Persian adaptation of Kalīla wa-Dimna (کلیله و دمنه) (itself an earlier Persian translation of the ancient Indian Panchatantra).These works highlight the cultural significance of Canopus in Persian literature.
===China===
Canopus was described as Shou Xing, the Star of Longevity, in the &quot;Shiji&quot; (Records of the Grand Historian) completed in 94 BC by Chinese historian Sima Qian. Drawing on sources from the Warring States period, he noted it to be the southern counterpart of Sirius, and wrote of a sanctuary dedicated to it established by Emperor Qin Shi Huang between 221 and 210 BC. During the Han dynasty, the star was auspicious, its appearance in the southern sky heralding peace and absence war. From the imperial capital Chang&#x27;an, the star made a low transit across the southern sky, indicating true south to observers, and was often obscured by clouds. During this time it was also equated with Old Man of the South Pole (in ) Under this name, Canopus appears (albeit misplaced northwards) on the medieval Chinese manuscript the Dunhuang Star Chart, although it cannot be seen from the Chinese capital of Chang&#x27;an. The Chinese astronomer Yi Xing had journeyed south to chart Canopus and other far southern stars in 724 AD. Its personification as the Old Man Star was popularised in the Tang dynasty, where it appeared often in poetry and memorials. Later still, during the Ming dynasty, the star was established as one of the Three Stars (Fu Lo Shou), appearing frequently in art and literature of the time. This symbolism spread into neighbouring cultures in Asia.
In Japan, Canopus is known as &quot;Mera-boshi&quot; and &quot;Roujin-sei&quot; (the old man star), and in Mongolia, it was personified as the White Old Man. Although the link was known in Tibet, with names such as &quot;Genpo karpo&quot; (&quot;Rgan po dkar po&quot;) or &quot;Genkar&quot; (&quot;Rgan dkar&quot;) &quot;White Old Man&quot;, the symbolism was not popular. Instead, Canopus was more commonly named &quot;Karma Rishi སྐར་མ་རི་ཥི།&quot;, derived from Indian mythology. Tibetans celebrated the star&#x27;s heliacal rising with ritual bathing and associated it with morning dew.

===Polynesia===
Bright stars were important to the ancient Polynesians for navigation between the many islands and atolls of the Pacific Ocean. Low on the horizon, they acted as stellar compasses to assist mariners in charting courses to particular destinations. Canopus served as the southern wingtip of a &quot;Great Bird&quot; constellation called &quot;Manu&quot;, with Sirius as the body and Procyon the northern wingtip, which divided the Polynesian night sky into two hemispheres. The Hawaiian people called Canopus &quot;Ke Alii-o-kona-i-ka-lewa&quot;, &quot;The chief of the southern expanse&quot;; it was one of the stars used by Hawaiʻiloa and Ki when they traveled to the Southern Ocean.

The Māori people of New Zealand/Aotearoa had several names for Canopus. &quot;Ariki&quot; (&quot;High-born&quot;), was known as a solitary star that appeared in the east, prompting people to weep and chant. They also named it &quot;Atutahi&quot;, &quot;Aotahi&quot; or &quot;Atuatahi&quot;, &quot;Stand Alone&quot;. Its solitary nature indicates it is a &quot;tapu&quot; star, as &quot;tapu&quot; people are often solitary. Its appearance at the beginning of the &quot;Maruaroa&quot; season foretells the coming winter; light rays to the south indicate a cold wet winter, and to the north foretell a mild winter. Food was offered to the star on its appearance. This name has several mythologies attached to it. One story tells of how Atutahi was left outside the basket representing the Milky Way when Tāne wove it. Another related myth about the star says that Atutahi was the first-born child of Rangi, who refused to enter the Milky Way and so turned it sideways and rose before it. The same name is used for other stars and constellations throughout Polynesia. &quot;Kapae-poto&quot;, &quot;Short horizon&quot;, referred to it rarely setting as seen in New Zealand; &quot;Kauanga&quot; (&quot;Solitary&quot;) was the name for Canopus only when it was the last star visible before sunrise.

The people of the Society Islands had two names for Canopus, as did the Tuamotu people. The Society Islanders called Canopus &quot;Taurua-e-tupu-tai-nanu&quot;, &quot;Festivity-whence-comes-the-flux-of-the-sea&quot;, and &quot;Taurua-nui-o-te-hiti-apatoa&quot; &quot;Great-festivity-of-the-border-of-the-south&quot;, and the Tuamotu people called the star &quot;Te Tau-rari&quot; and &quot;Marere-te-tavahi&quot;, the latter said to be the true name for the former, &quot;He-who-stands-alone&quot;.

===Africa===
In the Guanche mythology of the island of Tenerife (Spain), the star Canopus was linked with the goddess Chaxiraxi.

The Tswana people of Botswana knew Canopus as &quot;Naka&quot;. Appearing late in winter skies, it heralded increasing winds and a time when trees lose their leaves. Stock owners knew it was time to put their sheep with rams. In southern Africa, the Sotho, Tswana and Venda people called Canopus &quot;Naka&quot; or &quot;Nanga&quot;, “the Horn Star”, while the Zulu and Swazi called it &quot;inKhwenkwezi&quot; &quot;Brilliant star&quot;. It appears in the predawn sky in the third week of May. According to the Venda, the first person to see Canopus would blow a &quot;phalaphala&quot; horn from the top of a hill, getting a cow for a reward. The Sotho chiefs also awarded a cow, and ordered their medicine men to roll bone dice and read the fortune for the coming year. To the ǀXam-speaking Bushmen of South Africa, Canopus and Sirius signalled the appearance of termites and flying ants. They also believed that stars had the power to cause death and misfortune, and they would pray to Sirius and Canopus in particular to impart good fortune or skill. The ǃKung people of the Kalahari Desert in Botswana held Canopus and Capella to be the horns of &quot;tshxum&quot; (the Pleiades), the appearance of all three marking the end of the dry season and start of the rainy season.

===Americas===
The Navajo observed the star and named it &quot;Maʼii Bizòʼ&quot;, the “Coyote Star”. According to legend, Maʼii (Coyote) took part in the naming and placing of the star constellations during
the creation of the universe. He placed Canopus directly south, naming it after himself.

The Kalapalo people of Mato Grosso state in Brazil saw Canopus and Procyon as &quot;Kofongo&quot; &quot;Duck&quot;, with Castor and Pollux representing his hands. The asterism&#x27;s appearance signified the coming of the rainy season and increase in manioc, a food staple fed to guests at feasts.

===Australia===
Canopus is identified as the moiety ancestor &quot;Waa&quot; &quot;Crow&quot; to some Koori people in southeastern Australia. The Boorong people of northwestern Victoria recalled that &quot;War&quot; (Canopus) was the brother of &quot;Warepil&quot; (Sirius), and that he brought fire from the heavens and introduced it to humanity. His wife was &quot;Collowgullouric War&quot; (Eta Carinae). The Pirt-Kopan-noot people of western Victoria tell of &quot;Waa&quot; &quot;Crow&quot; falling in love with a queen, &quot;Gneeanggar&quot; &quot;Wedge-tailed Eagle&quot; (Sirius) and her six attendants (the Pleiades). His advances spurned, he hears that the women are foraging for grubs and so transforms himself into a grub. When the women dig him out, he changes into a giant and carries her off.

The Kulin people know Canopus as &quot;Lo-an-tuka&quot;. Objects in the sky are also associated with states of being for some tribes; the Wailwun of northern New South Wales know Canopus as &quot;Wumba&quot; &quot;deaf&quot;, alongside Mars as &quot;Gumba&quot; &quot;fat&quot; and Venus as &quot;Ngindigindoer&quot; &quot;you are laughing&quot;.

Tasmanian aboriginal lore holds that Canopus is &quot;Dromerdene&quot;, the brother of &quot;Moinee&quot;; the two fought and fell out of the sky, with &quot;Dromerdene&quot; falling into Louisa Bay in southwest Tasmania. Astronomer Duane Hamacher has identified Canopus with &quot;Moinee&quot; in a paper dating Tasmanian Aboriginal oral tradition to the late Pleistocene, when Canopus was much closer to the South celestial pole.

===Legacy===
Canopus appears on the flag of Brazil, symbolising the state of Goiás.

Two U.S. Navy submarine tenders have been named after Canopus, the first serving from 1922 to 1942 and the second serving from 1965 to 1994.

The Royal Navy built nine Canopus-class ships of the line in the early 19th century, and six s which entered services between 1899 and 1902.

There are at least two mountains named after the star: Mount Canopus in Antarctica; and Mount Canopus or Canopus Hill in Tasmania, the location of the Canopus Hill astronomical observatory.

<text>Young Adelaide Voices is a large children&#x27;s choir in Adelaide, South Australia, run by Christie Anderson. They have won many international awards as well as at home and interstate. They were formerly known as the Adelaide Girls Choir, but became known as Young Adelaide Voices in November 2004, since which time membership has also been open to boys.

Young Adelaide Voices is a community choir formed in 1988. The choir has 250 members aged 5 to 25 years old, placed in 7 choirs according to age and experience. The choristers sing for a wide variety of functions, from community events to national and international conferences. In addition, the choir often performs as guest artists for professional organisations such as the Adelaide Festival Centre, the South Australian Police Band and the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra, with whom they have sung over 40 times and recorded one of their 9 CDs.

There have been four overseas tours to the UK, Europe, Canada and America, as well as interstate trips to Brisbane, Canberra and New South Wales. Their international performances have earned the choir world renown. The Concert Choir has given recitals in such places as Westminster Abbey, St Martin-in-the-Fields and St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, and even Disneyland in America.

<text>Canopus Co., Ltd. was a manufacturer of video editing cards and video editing software. The company&#x27;s focus shifted from enthusiast video cards to other areas of video hardware and software after the release of their Spectra line of products. Some of their previous competitors included Matrox and Pinnacle Systems. In 2005, Thomson Multimedia acquired Canopus to bolster their Grass Valley broadcasting and network product line.

When 3dfx&#x27;s Voodoo series of PC-gaming-oriented 3D graphics cards became popular in the mid-1990s, Canopus produced the Pure3D, a Voodoo graphics processor-based graphics card with 6 MB of memory instead of the standard 4 MB. When the Voodoo 2 was released, the Canopus Pure3D II was praised for the fact that their cards were shorter than competitors&#x27; Voodoo 2 cards. Canopus had a reputation for driver optimization that gave a performance advantage over other cards. They were the cards of choice for Maximum PC&#x27;s 1998 Dream Machine.

Canopus also released a version of the nVidia TNT that offered a unique internal cable that connected the TNT card to the Voodoo2 based Pure3D II—as opposed to the standard connection with an external cable.

The Canopus DVStorm2 was a realtime video editing card that Canopus discontinued in early 2005. Canopus is also known for EDIUS, non-linear video editing software, and a transcoder application called ProCoder, and their ADVC range of DV (IEEE1394) video conversion units.

<doc id="1283646" wikidata="Q1975693" url="?curid=1283646" title="Masao Abe">
<text>was a Japanese Buddhist philosopher and religious studies scholar who was emeritus professor at Nara University. He is best known for his work in comparative religion, developing a Buddhist-Christian interfaith dialogue which later also included Judaism. His mature views were developed within the Kyoto School of philosophy. According to Christopher Ives: &quot;Since the death of D. T. Suzuki in 1966, Masao Abe has served as the main representative of Zen Buddhism in Europe and North America.&quot;

==Life and career==
===Training===
Abe&#x27;s father was a medical doctor, his mother a practitioner of Pure Land Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism, from whom came his early faith in Amida Buddha. Born in Osaka, Abe was the third of six children. His higher education began at Osaka Municipal University, where he studied Economics and Law. For four years during the late 1930s he worked in a business office at a private trading company in neighboring Kobe. Yet Abe was seriously troubled by an ongoing personal crisis, which stemmed from the perceived conflict: rationality versus faith in the Amida of Pure Land Buddhism. This conflict he thought he could conclusively resolve in favor of faith through the study of philosophy, by which he could overcome objections posed by reason.

Abe entered Kyoto University in April 1942. It was a courageous step, as he changed career direction in mid-stream, exceptional in Japanese life, yet even more so considering the current political situation. He studied Western philosophy under Hajime Tanabe. Also, Abe studied Zen under the direction of Shin&#x27;ichi Hisamatsu, a philosophy professor at Kyoto University and a lay practitioner of the Rinzai school. Guided by Hisamatsu, Abe worked with others to revitalize Buddhist youth organization at Kyoto University throughout the 1940s. Professor Hisamatsu challenged Abe&#x27;s quasi-theistic faith in Amida Buddha; instead Hisamatsu became for Abe a vital religious model, of a rigorous adherent of Sunyata (which may be called &quot;emptiness&quot;) as an ultimate reality. In consequence, Abe came to understand Amida Buddha as a sacred fiction.

Abe&#x27;s spiritual progression under Hisamatsu was complex and dialectical. Hisamatsu taught that the revered image of Amida Buddha was but a stage on the way to realizing a &quot;formless&quot; Buddha, whereby one could awaken to one&#x27;s True Self. Nonetheless Abe first reacted to Hisamatsu by coming to discover and experience an infinite grace from the Amida Buddha. Abe&#x27;s profound quest continued. In December 1951, during a group Zen sitting at the Reiun Temple of the Myōshin-ji in Kyoto, Abe personally challenged Hisamatsu, screaming to him, &quot;Is that the True Self?&quot; Hisamatsu replied, &quot;That&#x27;s the True Self.&quot; Thereafter Abe entered an intense phase and struggled with the view that &quot;It&#x27;s all a lie!&quot; (which he cried out while dousing himself with a bucket of ice water at a subsequent group sitting). He agonized over the seeming proximity of the Deity and the devil, and with his own complicity. Finally, Abe told Hisamatsu, &quot;I just cannot find any place where I can stand.&quot; Hisamatsu told him, &quot;Stand right at that place where there is nowhere to stand.&quot;

Along this way Abe confronted, and managed to distinguish and overcome, a &quot;positive nihilism&quot; associated with the secular, irreligious philosopher Frederich Nietzsche. Reflecting on his life development, Abe acknowledged the crucial role of Shin&#x27;ichi Hisamatsu in his spiritual formation. &quot;Without him I am not what I am.&quot;

===Academia===
Among Abe&#x27;s chief academic influences would be the aforementioned Shin&#x27;ichi Hisamatsu (1889–1980) and also Keiji Nishitani (1900–1990), as well as Hajime Tanabe (1885–1962), key professors for Abe at Kyoto University, and Kitaro Nishida (1870–1945), teacher of Hisamatsu and Nishitani, and teacher of his own successor Tanabe. Abe follows Nishida&#x27;s Kyoto school of philosophy. During the 1950s and early 1960s Abe was in communication with the well-known Buddhist scholar Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki (1870–1966), e.g., at Columbia University in New York City; Abe is said to have later assumed Suzuki&#x27;s role as academic transmitter of Buddhism. Also in New York City, at the Union Theological Seminary, Abe encountered the Christian professors and teachers Paul Tillich (1886–1965) and Reinhold Niebuhr (1892–1971).

From 1952 to 1980, Abe served as professor of philosophy at Nara University. Before he had been professor at Kyoto Women&#x27;s College (1946–1948) and Otani University (1948–1950). Thereafter, while at Nara, Abe was concurrently professor at Kyoto University from 1955 to 1958, and from 1964-1980 professor at Hana Zono University. Also in the mid-1950s he studied Christian theology in New York City at the Union Theological Seminary and at Columbia University. Then in 1980 he left Nara University and moved to California, to the Department of Religion at the Claremont Graduate School, and later in 1983 to the University of Hawaii where he served as Professor of Japanese Philosophy. From 1965 Abe participated and made presentations at many universities and colleges throughout the U.S.A. while serving as a visiting professor in residence (with his wife Ikuko). During these years Abe shared in the Buddhist-Christian dialogue while at universities in Europe.

Abe contributed to and led many conferences on comparative religion, Buddhism, and related subjects. He was perennially involved with: the East-West Philosophers&#x27; Conference at the University of Hawaii; and the &quot;International Buddhist-Christian Theological Encounter&quot; (the &quot;Abe-Cobb group&quot;) which, along with Professor John B. Cobb, Jr., Abe directed.

In addition to his contributions of creative insight and scholarship, Masao Abe also brought to interfaith meetings a serenity and a quiet charm. Here, for example, his fellow academic Arvind Sharma recalls a moment with Abe at a conference in 1986:

Abe broke into a smile. I still remember it vividly because it had a compelling ineffable quality about it. It was so totally unencumbered. It seemed curiously and totally detached from the environment, a happening complete in itself, with a childlike simplicity beguiling in its guilelessness. When his face assumed its normal expression, one was left with the feeling of something very precious—found fleetingly and then lost irretrievably—until he smiled again.

Apparently, the source of this &quot;giving gift&quot; had passed through spiritual trials. Abe earlier was required to walk down a path of terrifying dread, and to make a leap into the abyss, in order to find &quot;that place where there is nowhere to stand.&quot;

===Dialogue===
Abe sought to advance the interreligious dialogue while serving in his widespread teaching assignments; he led many seminars on Buddhism and western religions, particularly Christianity. A frequent procedure followed by the convened representatives of different religions was: first to attempt to understand the other&#x27;s faith perspective from the inside (without compromising each one&#x27;s own faith), to the extent of being able to &quot;see&quot; how things may look from the other&#x27;s point of view; second, there would follow a period during which each would &quot;return&quot; to their own faith; thereafter, a more fruitful discussion might commence. Abe further sought to encourage dialogue through his various philosophical and spiritual writings.

Generally Abe has received praise for his efforts. Professor Jürgen Moltmann found that the Buddhist scholar&#x27;s presentation was profound and precise concerning a central topic of Christian theology. &quot;Here reciprocal understanding is not only furthered, but Christianity and Buddhism in their immiscible difference are led into a common reality. In light of this common reality, perhaps a mutual transformation does not yet begin, but certainly a reciprocal liking and opening for each other.&quot;

In 1983 Professor Abe disclosed aspects of his inner motivation. He wrote that, in addition to his abiding interest in Buddhism, he was profoundly concerned with the spiritual foundation for all of &quot;humanity in a global age. To provide this foundation, a comparative and dialogical study of Buddhism and Western thought, Christianity included, is absolutely necessary.&quot;

==An essay with responses==
* Abe&#x27;s essay is entitled &quot;Kenotic God and Dynamic Śūnyatā&quot;, which discusses &quot;emptiness&quot; in Christianity and Buddhism. Abe refers to St. Paul in his letter to the Philippians 2:5-11, especially the verses stating that &quot;Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.&quot; Abe eventually extrapolates to posit an emptying of God the Father, and hence an ontological resemblance between Christianity and the Buddhist concept of &quot;sunyata&quot; or emptiness as an ultimate reality. In the process, Abe discusses Buddhist social ethics and social responsibility. Also, he addresses the Shoah; here, he raises the difficult issue of a &quot;collective karma&quot; manifested in guilt felt by those far removed from the time and locale of these genocidal crimes. Abe writes for an educated multi-religious readership, with keen awareness and observation, informed to a certain extent by Process theology developed within modern Christianity, and from a perspective nurtured in the Kyoto school of Buddhist philosophy. His essay has been published as follows.
** &quot;The Emptying God: A Buddhist-Jewish-Christian Conversation&quot; (Maryknoll, NY: Orbis 1990), edited by John B. Cobb, Jr., and Christopher Ives. Professor Cobb was a leader in Process theology. Herein Abe&#x27;s essay &quot;Kenotic God and Dynamic Sunyata&quot; appears, which is addressed by one Jewish (Eugene Borowitz) and six Christian (Thomas J. J. Altizer, John B. Cobb, Jr., Catherine Keller, Jürgen Moltmann, Schubert M. Ogden, and David Tracy) theologians. Then follows a &quot;Rejoinder&quot; by Abe. Several subsequent responses and replies appear in the journal &quot;Buddhist-Christian Studies&quot; (Honolulu: Univ.of Hawaii).

==A Zen view of time==

By realization through Zen practice of the Buddhist teaching of the impermanence of all things (Skt: anitya) (Jpn: mujō), we come to experience that we are living-dying at each and every moment. &quot;If we grasp our lives not objectively from without but subjectively from within, we are not moving from life to death but are in the midst of this process of living-dying.&quot; By a careful reading of Dōgen (1200–1253) and a watchful understanding of the inner sense of time, Abe learns and teaches how the objectification of time can alienate us from our own experience of its impermanence.

Dōgen puzzled over a seeming contradiction in Buddhism. All sentient beings are originally enlightened, yet Buddhist teachings &quot;arouse the longing for enlightenment&quot; in those who hear it. If we do religious practice we may become enlightened due to an &quot;acquired awakening&quot; yet &quot;original awakening&quot; is ours &quot;before our parents were born&quot;. Dōgen rejects as naturalistic fallacy a theory of &quot;original awakening&quot; that would equate a given human self-consciousness with genuine enlightenment. Also Dōgen rejects the idea that practice is a means to the goal of enlightenment. The epistemological process of enlightenment is undertaken by zen practice, but the process itself becomes enlightenment, i.e., the path is the way of awakening. Abe quotes Dōgen: &quot;In the Buddha Dharma, practice and realization are identical. [O]ne&#x27;s initial negotiating of the Way in itself is the whole of original realization. Thus, even while directed to practice, one is told not to anticipate a realization apart from practice, because practice points directly to original realization.&quot;

Instead of waiting for the time of awakening while sitting in meditation, one is &quot;directly knowing temporal conditions&quot; for the &quot;time has already arrived&quot;. &quot;There is no time that is not the right time.&quot; &quot;Dōgen denies continuity of time and emphasizes the independence of each point of time... .&quot; Prof. Abe then quotes Dōgen to illustrate:

&quot;[I]t being an established teaching of Buddhism not to speak of life becoming death, Buddhism speaks of the unborn. It being a confirmed Buddhist teaching that death does not become life, it speaks of non-extinction. Life is a stage of time and death is a stage of time, like, for example, winter and spring. We do not suppose that winter becomes spring, or say that spring becomes summer.&quot;

Subjectively from within, &quot;the process of our living-dying [is] being without beginning and without end.&quot; For Buddhists, there is no beginning of the universe (no creation), and there is no end (no last judgment). &quot;We must realize the beginninglessness and endlessness of samsara, that is, the transmigration of living-dying.&quot; Prof. Abe mentions several experiences:

* &quot;[E]ach and every moment can be a beginning and an end in itself: time begins and ends with each moment. Accordingly, time is not understood to be a unidirectional movement but is seen as a sheer series of moments that can move reciprocally. Here a sort of reversibility of time is realized.&quot;
* &quot;[I]f we clearly realize the beginninglessness and endlessness of living-dying &quot;at this particular moment&quot;, the whole process of living-dying is concentrated within this moment. In other words, each moment embraces the whole process of beginningless and endless time within itself. Thus, one can in fact transcend time at this very moment.&quot;
* &quot;The Buddhist view, based on full immersion in the depth of the moment, is that there is no difference between past and future. The temporal distinction belongs to the observer&#x27;s perspective on the horizontal and historical plane. In the vertical or depth dimension, Buddhists insist, time is overcome.&quot;
* &quot;Although karma works deterministically on the horizontal dimension of time, once the vertical, or transtemporal, dimension is opened up as one awakens to the truth of no-self, that person is no longer a slave to karma but becomes its master. This means that on the basis of the realization of the true self as no-self at the bottomless depth of the vertical dimension of time, the present act can emancipate one&#x27;s self from past karma and create new karma that will affect the future as, for instance, in the form of a vow.&quot;

<doc id="1283659" wikidata="Q6801200" url="?curid=1283659" title="McGarvie model">
<text>The McGarvie model is a proposition for change to the Australian Constitution to remove references to the monarchy and establish a republic. It is also known as the &quot;Australian Democracy Model&quot;.

The model was developed by former Governor of Victoria Richard McGarvie and originally submitted to the Republic Advisory Committee in 1993. At the Constitutional Convention of 1998, it was the second most popular model of the four voted upon.

Under the McGarvie model, a Constitutional Council would appoint and dismiss the head of state, the Governor-General. The Constitutional Council would be bound to act in accordance with the Prime Minister&#x27;s advice by a convention backed by the penalty of public dismissal for breach.

The three members of the Constitutional Council, who can act by majority, are determined automatically by constitutional formula, with places going first to former Governors-General (with priority to the most recently retired), and excess places going (on the same basis) in turn to former state governors, lieutenant-governors (or equivalent), judges of the High Court or judges of the Federal Court.

The tenure of the head of state would be under the same arrangements as the existing practice for the current Governor-General. The head of state would also have the same range of powers as the current Governor-General, but, except for the reserve powers, they could only be exercised on the advice of the Federal Executive Council or a Minister. Otherwise there would be no codification of the constitutional conventions.

The only eligibility requirement for a head of state under the McGarvie model would be Australian citizenship because the process for selecting the head of state is designed to ensure a non-political head of state.

Supporters of the model claim that, although described as &quot;no-risk but uninspiring&quot; and occasionally as &quot;elitist&quot;, it has the considerable advantage of being developed by one with experience as a governor and hence a working knowledge of how the system of governorship actually functions in Australia. They claim it is straightforward, easily implemented, demonstrates twin requirements of practicality and principle, and keeps the separation of powers intact.

Legal commentators have remarked that the McGarvie model is broadly consistent with the constitution&#x27;s existing arrangements under the monarchy and that it requires the least change to constitutional practice. 

Some republicans have been critical of the appointment process in the McGarvie model and argue that a model without any public participation in its selection mechanism would not be successful in any referendum to change the constitution.

Hollett went on to edit small-town newspapers throughout Ontario, including the &quot;Orangeville Citizen&quot;, the &quot;Caledon Citizen&quot; and the &quot;Halton Hills Herald&quot;, Georgetown, Ontario.

== Career ==
In 1981, Hollett co-founded &quot;NOW&quot; with his partner Alice Klein. The paper has remained independent ever since. Although a number of alternative weekly newspapers had been attempted in Toronto without success in the past, &quot;Now&quot;&#x27;s early decision to be distributed without charge proved to be crucial in its success. Buzz Burza helped develop the free distribution initiative after the paper initially charged 50 cents per copy.

The magazine also continues to reflect the editorial slant that Hollett brought to it, notably favouring the New Democratic Party (NDP) politically.

In 1995, Hollett became a founder of the North by Northeast (NXNE) music festival.

In 2004, he provided the liner notes for a greatest hits CD release by the band Blue Rodeo.

Hollett served on the board of directors of the Association of Alternative Newsmedia (AAN) a continental organization representing alt weeklies and digital media across North America from 2009 until 2016. He was also a founding member of the Alternative Media Foundation. Hollett resigned from both boards when he resigned from NOW Magazine in 2016. He resigned from NOW to focus on growing NXNE and to spend more time writing.
He is a founding board member of Music Canada Live, launched in 2014, and remains active in the association. Hollett continues to travel the world attending music festivals and conferences, often as a speaker, expanding NXNE&#x27;s contacts and looking for talent to book. He recently spoke at the Golden Medlody Awards, Conference and Festival in Taipei, Taiwan in June, 2018 and again in 2019.

== Personal life ==
Hollett resides in the Toronto neighbourhood of Riverdale. He is an avid hockey fan and player, and was active with the Friends of Maple Leaf Gardens, an organization dedicated to the preservation of the historic hockey arena in downtown Toronto who helped preserve and re-purpose the building.

<doc id="1283663" wikidata="Q4825988" url="?curid=1283663" title="Authorship of the Pauline epistles">
<text>The Pauline epistles are the thirteen books in the New Testament traditionally attributed to Paul the Apostle.

There is strong consensus in modern New Testament scholarship on a core group of authentic Pauline epistles whose authorship is rarely contested: Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians, and Philemon.

Several additional letters bearing Paul&#x27;s name are disputed among scholars, namely Colossians, 2 Thessalonians, Ephesians, 1 and 2 Timothy, and Titus. Scholarly opinion is sharply divided on whether or not Colossians and 2 Thessalonians are genuine letters of Paul. The remaining four contested epistles – Ephesians, as well as the three known as the Pastoral Epistles (1 and 2 Timothy, and Titus) – have been labeled pseudepigraphical works by most critical scholars. Some scholars have proposed that Paul may have used an &quot;amanuensis&quot;, or secretary, in writing the disputed letters, although such a solution would not explain the fact that the disputed letters appear to have been written at least a decade after Paul’s death.

There are two examples of pseudonymous letters written in Paul&#x27;s name apart from the New Testament epistles, the Epistle to the Laodiceans and 3 Corinthians.

The Epistle to the Hebrews is actually anonymous, but it has been traditionally attributed to Paul. The church father Origen of Alexandria rejected the Pauline authorship of Hebrews, instead asserting that, although the ideas expressed in the letter were genuinely Pauline, the letter itself had actually been written by someone else. Most modern scholars generally agree that Hebrews was not written by the apostle Paul. Various other possible authorships have been suggested.

==Criteria used by scholars==
Scholars use a number of methods of historiography and higher criticism to determine whether a text is properly attributed to its author. The primary methods used for Paul&#x27;s letters are the following:

===Internal evidence===
Internal evidence consists of what the author states about himself in the letter, either explicitly the author clearly identifies himself or implicitly provides autobiographical details. This evidence is important in spite of its problems. For example, because the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews never identified himself, scholars as early as Origen of Alexandria in the 3rd century suspected that Paul was not the author.

===External evidence===
External evidence consists of references, again either explicit or implicit, to the text, especially during earliest times by those who had access to reliable sources now lost.

Explicit references would be mentioning the text or letter by name, or referencing a recognizable form of that text. Examples include a list of accepted biblical books, such as the Muratorian fragment, or the contents of an early manuscript, such as Papyrus 46. Unfortunately, these witnesses are often either damaged or too late in date to provide much help.

Implicit references are quotations from Paul (especially indirect or unattributed), or expressions of ideas and phrases that appear in his works. This use or reference implies the material quoted was in existence at the time the external evidence was created. For example, the &quot;Second Epistle to the Thessalonians&quot; is named by Irenaeus in the mid-2nd century, as well as by Justin Martyr and Ignatius of Antioch; it is considered unlikely for the surviving version of this letter to have been written after this time. On the other hand, lack of witness by ancient sources suggests a later date - an argument from silence. However, use of this line of reasoning is dangerous, because of the incompleteness of the historical record: many ancient texts are lost, damaged, have been revised or possibly contrived.

===Historical setting===
An independently written narrative of Paul&#x27;s life and ministry, found in the Acts of the Apostles, is used to determine the date, and possible authorship, of Pauline letters by locating their origin within the context of his life. For example, Paul mentions that he is a prisoner in his Epistle to Philemon 1:7; based on this statement, J. A. T. Robinson argued that this captivity was Paul&#x27;s imprisonment in Caesarea, while W. M. Ramsay identified this as Paul&#x27;s captivity in Rome, while others have placed the captivity in Ephesus.

One difficulty with this position is the limited data available on Paul&#x27;s historical setting, and this is especially true with the conclusion of the narrative of Acts prior to Paul&#x27;s death. It also assumes that the book of Acts was written by an actual traveling companion of Paul&#x27;s. Recent scholarship challenges the validity of using the Acts of the Apostles to determine anything about Pauline letters. Borg and Crossan cautiously comment that &quot;the author of Acts was not concerned with factual inerrancy&quot;; Dewey et al. note in similar vein that &quot;in much of Acts as a whole, Luke gives us historical fiction rather than an historical report.&quot; They therefore &quot;recommend against using Acts, either as a whole or in part, as a historical source for Paul&#x27;s career&quot;.

===Language and style===
Vocabulary, sentence structure, employment of idioms and common phrases, etc. are analyzed for consistency with the author&#x27;s other known works. A similar style implies common authorship, while a radically divergent vocabulary implies different authors. For example, E. J. Goodspeed argued that the vocabulary of the Epistle to the Ephesians showed a literary relationship with the &quot;First Epistle of Clement&quot;, written around the end of the 1st century. Similarly, E. Percy argued that the speech and style of Colossians more strongly resembled Pauline authorship than not. Of course, style and language can vary for reasons other than differing authorship, such as the subject of the letter, the recipient, the circumstances of the times, a different amanuensis, or simply maturation on the part of the author.

===Contents and theology===
Similar to internal evidence, doctrinal consistency and development are examined against the author&#x27;s other known works. Theological themes like the &quot;eschaton&quot; or the Mosaic Law could reappear in different works, but in a similar manner. A consistent point of view implies a common author; contradictory or unrelated teachings imply multiple authors. For example, W. Michaelis saw the Christological likeness between the Pastoral Epistles and some of Paul&#x27;s undisputed works, and argued in favor of Pauline authorship. A problem with this method is analyzing the coherence of a body of diverse and developing teachings. This is seen in the disagreement between scholars. For example, with the same epistles mentioned above, B. S. Easton argued their theological notions disagreed with other Pauline works and rejected Pauline authorship. G. Lohfink argued the theology of the Pastoral Epistles agreed with Paul&#x27;s, but took this as proof someone wishing to enjoy the authority of an apostle copied the famous church leader.

==Undisputed epistles==


The name &quot;undisputed&quot; epistles represents the scholarly consensus asserting that Paul authored each letter.

The undisputed letters are:

* Romans
* First Corinthians
* Second Corinthians
* Galatians
* Philippians
* First Thessalonians
* Philemon

These seven letters are quoted or mentioned by the earliest of sources, and are included in every ancient canon, including that of Marcion (). There is no record of scholarly doubt concerning authorship until the 19th century when, around 1840, German scholar Ferdinand Christian Baur accepted only four of the letters bearing Paul&#x27;s name as genuine, which he called the &quot;Hauptebriefe&quot; (Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and Galatians). Hilgenfeld (1875) and H. J. Holtzmann (1885) expanded Baur&#x27;s four into seven, by adding Philemon, 1 Thessalonians, and Philippians.

Nowadays, few scholars argue against this list of seven epistles, which all share common themes, emphasis, vocabulary and style. They also exhibit a uniformity of doctrine concerning the Mosaic Law, Christ, and faith.

==Disputed epistles==

===Colossians===
Although Colossians is witnessed by the same historical sources as the undisputed texts, Pauline authorship of Colossians has found some critics. It was originally doubted by F. C. Baur, though others working from his general thesis, such as H. J. Holtzmann, argued that an original brief Pauline text experienced many interpolations by a later editor. The basis for this early objection was that the letter aimed at refuting Gnosticism, a heresy which had not reached its ascendancy until the early 2nd century. This thesis subsequently declined, especially following an analysis of Gnosticism by R. Wilson, in which he contended that the supposed parallels to Gnosticism were unsupported.

Another argument centers on differences in style and vocabulary. W. Bujard attempted to show significant stylistic differences between Colossians and Paul&#x27;s other works, such as unusual genitive constructions. Others have analyzed the style and reached opposite conclusions.

The extensiveness of the theological development in the epistle compared to other epistles has also led to skepticism concerning Pauline authorship. H. Conzelmann made such an argument, pointing to differing theological concepts of &quot;hope&quot;. Others accepting this analysis have asserted that the text is merely a late text of Paul, though the thesis has not found wide scholarly concurrence. Many have argued that Colossians has an ecclesiology that is incompatible with the authentic Pauline texts. While Romans and 1 Corinthians, like Colossians, speak of a body of Christ, it is clear that Paul imagines the church &quot;as&quot; the body of Christ on earth (Rom 7:4, 12:5; 1 Cor 12:27). Conversely, the text of Colossians seems to imagine that Christ is the head of the body, which is the church (Col 1:18). Additionally, detractors of the traditional authorship of Colossians point to the work&#x27;s &quot;realized eschatology.&quot; Whereas Paul, an apocalyptic Jew, anticipated the bodily resurrection of the faithful in the future (Rom 6:4-5), Colossians indicates that believers have already been raised with Christ (2:12; 3:1). Similarly, though Paul envisions Christ&#x27;s triumph over rulers and authorities as a future event (1 Cor 15:24), Colossians 2:15 acknowledges this as having already occurred. Another intriguing distinction between the Colossian correspondence and the &quot;7 authentic letters&quot; is the lack of a financial request for the poor in Jerusalem. Kiley notes that while every one of Paul&#x27;s main letters wish for financial report, Colossians is mysteriously lacking such a request.

The connection between Colossians and Philemon, an undisputed letter, is significant. A certain Archippus is referred to in both Philemon 2 and Colossians 4:17, and the greetings of both letters bear similar names. Additionally, the nearly identical phrases of Philemon 5 and Colossians 1:4 and the presence of Onesimus in both letters stands out. However, the connection between the two epistles can be used by those on both sides of the Pauline vs. deutero-Pauline debate. To those who favor Pauline authorship of Colossians, this is evidence of same authorship; to those who do not, this, combined with the other evidence noted, is indicative of a skillful forger.

===Ephesians===
The author of Ephesians claims to be Paul in the opening address, itself identical to those of Second Corinthians and Colossians. There were no doubts in the late-second century church that Paul wrote the epistle: it was quoted authoritatively by church fathers, including Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, and Irenaeus, among others. Ephesians may be an amended version of the letter to the Laodiceans in the Marcion canon (130) and the Muratorian fragment (before 180).

The authenticity of this letter was first disputed by the Dutch Renaissance scholar Desiderius Erasmus, and in more recent times has drawn detailed criticism.

The letter is made up of 50 sentences, 9 with over 50 words. The closest, Romans, has 3 out of 581 sentences of such length. E. J. Goodspeed, and C. L. Mitton argued the style was unlike Paul&#x27;s other works. Many words in the letter are not in the &quot;undisputed&quot; epistles. However, still, some scholars do not find the style of Ephesians to be unlike Paul&#x27;s authentic letters. In antiquity, the Greek Church Fathers, many of whom noticed the divergent Greek style of Hebrews, made no such comments about Ephesians.

In this letter, the word &quot;&quot; is used to refer theologically to the universal church rather than, as Paul typically employs it, to the local churches that he had founded. Also, the eschatological tone is more subdued than in other letters: the expectation of Christ&#x27;s imminent return is unmentioned, while future generations are (3:21), as is a concern for social order. W. G. Kümmel argued that the theology is later than Paul.

There is a close literary relationship between the Colossians and Ephesians. E. F. Scott argued that Paul used one letter as a model for the other, whereas others have considered Ephesians to be derivative of Colossians, edited and reworked by another. Donald Guthrie summarized the implications of this: &quot;Advocates of non-Pauline authorship find it difficult to conceive that one mind could have produced two works possessing so remarkable a degree of similarity in theme and phraseology and yet differing in so many other respects, whereas advocates of Pauline authorship are equally emphatic that two minds could not have produced two such works with so much subtle interdependence blended with independence.&quot;

Paul founded and built up the church in Ephesus; however, this letter does not appear to contain the usual specific greetings, seen in Paul&#x27;s other letters, addressed to people he remembers. There is some evidence that the Letter to the Ephesians might have been sent to several different churches. Some of the oldest manuscripts of this letter are not addressed to &quot;God&#x27;s holy people who are at Ephesus,&quot; but merely to &quot;God&#x27;s holy people.&quot; Marcion, around 140, quoted from this letter and attributed the quote to Paul&#x27;s &quot;Letter to the Laodiceans.&quot; In the 17th century, James Ussher suggested that this might have been a &quot;circular letter&quot; that Paul sent to several churches, including Ephesus and Laodicea. This would explain why Paul&#x27;s usual personal greetings are absent: these could not be included in a letter sent to several different churches.

Summary of the reasons for thinking Ephesians is not by Paul:

* The language and style are different. Ephesians contains 40 new words, e.g. 1:3 &quot;heavenly places&quot;; &quot;family, or fatherhood&quot; (3:15). 1:19 has four different words for &quot;power&quot;; Ephesians and Colossians use a different word for &quot;reconcile&quot; from Paul&#x27;s word (Col 1:20, 22; Eph 2:16). And they both use many very long sentences, e.g. 1:3-14; 1:15-23; 3:1-7; 4:11-16; 6:14-20. Also Col 1:9-20.
* Metaphors, or illustrations in Paul are turned into actual objective realities in Ephesians (and sometimes in Colossians also). E.g. faith, gospel, word of God, reconciliation, salvation, human resurrection and glorification, the Church as the Body of Christ, Minister, Saints of God.
* Ephesians shows that the Church is becoming an advanced and powerful universal institution. In Paul&#x27;s time there was no universal Church in that sense, but only informal gatherings of individual believing communities.

See the section above on Colossians for the view of N.T. Wright.

===Second Epistle to the Thessalonians===
The epistle was included in the Marcion canon and the Muratorian fragment; it was mentioned by name by Irenaeus, and quoted by Ignatius, Justin, and Polycarp. The Pauline authorship of 2 Thessalonians was first questioned by J.E.C. Schmidt in 1801. In recent times, criticism of Pauline authorship was raised by H. J. Holtzmann and G. Hollmann (see above). Much of the dispute concerns the linguistic similarity between 1 Thessalonians and 2 Thessalonians. For example, 1 Thessalonians 2:9 is almost identical to 2 Thessalonians 3:8. This has been explained in the following ways: Paul wrote 2 Thessalonians soon after writing 1 Thessalonians or with the aid of a copy of 1 Thessalonians, or Paul wrote 1 Thessalonians himself but a later writer imitated him, or the linguistic similarities are seen as subtle enough to make imitation an unnecessary hypothesis.

Udo Schnelle argued that 2 Thessalonians was significantly different in style from the undisputed epistles, characterizing it as whole and narrow, rather than as a lively and abrupt discussion on a range of issues. Moreover, Alfred Loisy argued that it reflected knowledge of the synoptic gospels, which, according to the current scholarly consensus, had not been written when Paul wrote his epistles. Bart D. Ehrman viewed the insistence of genuineness within the letter and the strong condemnation of forgery at its start as ploys commonly used by forgers. G. Milligan observed that a church which possessed an authentic letter of Paul would be unlikely to accept a fake addressed to them. However, Milligan&#x27;s analysis assumes that 2 Thessalonians is not a late forgery and thus was received by the Thessalonian community.

2 Thessalonians is often regarded as pseudonymous due to its apparent divergence in theology/content from Paul&#x27;s authentic letters. Perhaps the most frequent attack on authenticity concerns the letter&#x27;s eschatology in relation to 1 Thessalonians and the rest of the Pauline corpus. It is often said that 1 Thessalonians (4:15; 5:2-3), like the historical Paul (1 Cor 7:29; Phil 4:5), expects an imminent end to the world, while 2 Thessalonians sees it as a future event (3:6-12). However, others understand 2 Thessalonians to be a correction of his audience&#x27;s misunderstanding of 1 Thessalonians, which explains Paul&#x27;s tone shift.

It has also been argued that the Christology of 2 Thessalonians is at odds with the true Paul, as what is attributed to Jesus in 2 Thessalonians is normally attributed to God in his other letters. As identified by M.J.J. Menken, several phrases in 2 Thessalonians seem to share a theme with phrases in 1 Thessalonians, yet with an elevated role of Christ. In particular, Jesus is described as the giver of salvation rather than God (2 Thess 2:13 vs. 1 Thess 1:4). Norman Perrin claimed that, in the time of Paul, prayer usually treated God the Father as ultimate judge, rather than Jesus. From this hypothesis he contrasted 2 Thessalonians 3:5 with 1 Thessalonians 3:13 and contended that 2 Thessalonians was written sometime after Paul&#x27;s death. Still, some see the texts in 2 Thessalonians that seem to elevate the role of Christ as overblown. Abraham Malherbe, for example, acknowledges the presence of Jesus as eschatological judge already in 1 Thessalonians 2:19; 3:11-12.

2 Thessalonians 2:2 seems to warn its readers against accepting teachings from a letter forged in Paul&#x27;s name, indicating that either a pseudonymous author was attempting to disarm the letter&#x27;s audience into accepting his forgery as authentically Pauline, or that Paul himself was writing to warn his readers that forged letters were being circulated in his name.

===Pastoral epistles===
The First Epistle to Timothy, the Second Epistle to Timothy, and the Epistle to Titus are often referred to as the &quot;pastoral epistles&quot; and are the most disputed of all the epistles ascribed to Paul.

Despite this, these epistles were accepted as genuine by many, perhaps most of the ante-Nicene Church Fathers. Some scholars have argued that the letters were certainly accepted as Pauline by the time of Irenaeus. They were also included in the Muratorian fragment. According to Jerome, the gnostic Christian Basilides also rejected these epistles, and Tatian, while accepting Titus, rejected other Pauline epistles. Marcion (c. 140) excluded all three, along with Hebrews, from his otherwise complete Pauline corpus, and it is impossible to determine whether or not he knew of them. Donald Guthrie, for instance, argues that Marcion&#x27;s theology would have been cause to reject the letters since it was incompatible with certain passages, such as 1 Tim 1:8 and 1 Tim 6:20, while Ehrman suggests that 2nd-century proto-orthodox Christians had motivation to forge the Pastorals to combat the Gnostic use of other Pauline epistles. Even the ancient writer Tertullian (c. 220), in &quot;Adv. Marc.&quot; V.21, expresses confusion as to why these epistles had not been included in Marcion&#x27;s canon. Modern scholars postulate that the &quot;Pauline Epistles&quot; originally circulated in three forms, for example, from &quot;The Canon Debate&quot;, attributed to Harry Y. Gamble:

# &quot;Marcion&#x27;s collection that begins with Galatians and ends with Philemon;&quot;
# &quot;Papyrus 46, dated about 200, that follows the order that became established except for reversing Ephesians and Galatians;&quot;
# &quot;[T]he letters to seven churches, treating those to the same church as one letter and basing the order on length, so that Corinthians is first and Colossians (perhaps including Philemon) is last.&quot;

Beginning in the early 19th century, many German biblical scholars began to question the traditional attribution of these letters to Paul. The vocabulary and phraseology used in the Pastorals is often at variance with that of the other epistles. Over 1/3 of the vocabulary is not used anywhere else in the Pauline epistles, and over 1/5 is not used anywhere else in the New Testament, while 2/3 of the non-Pauline vocabulary is used by 2nd-century Christian writers. For this reason, and because of a claimed precedence of 1 Clement, some scholars have associated these works with later 2nd-century Christian writings. The precedence of 1 Clement was challenged by R. Falconer, while L. T. Johnson challenged the linguistic analysis as based on the arbitrary grouping of the three epistles together: he argued that this obscures the alleged similarities between 1 Timothy and 1 Corinthians, between Titus and the other travel letters, and between 2 Timothy and Philippians.

Norman Perrin argued that Paul&#x27;s travels to Crete (Titus 1:5-6), again to Ephesus (1 Tim 1:3), Nicopolis (Titus 3:12), and Troas (2 Tim 1:15, 4:13) cannot be fit into any reconstruction of Paul&#x27;s life or works as determined from the other epistles or from Acts. In this he was preceded by several scholars who rejected Pauline authorship. Robinson argued against this analysis, while others have debated whether this should be grounds for rejection of Pauline authorship, as Acts concludes while Paul is still alive. Harnack, Lightfoot and other scholars have suggested hypothetical scenarios that would have these epistles written near the end of Paul&#x27;s life without contradicting biographical information in the other epistles or Acts. Scholars arguing for the authenticity of the pastorals posit a &quot;second career&quot; of Paul to explain the occasion for the visits mentioned in these letters, though contemporary scholars generally consider the &quot;second career&quot; of Paul to be a creation of later Christian communities.

Other reasons for a 2nd-century date have been argued. The pastoral epistles lay out church organization concerning the character and requirements for bishops, elders, deacons, and widows. Some scholars have claimed that these offices could not have appeared during Paul&#x27;s lifetime. In terms of theology, some scholars claim that the Pastorals reflect more the characteristics of 2nd century (proto-orthodox) church thought, than those of the 1st century. In particular, whilst in the 1st century the idea of Christ&#x27;s return being immediate was current (see parousia, as also described in the non-pastoral epistles), in the 2nd century it was seen as more distant, matching the choice of the pastorals to lay down instructions for a long time after the passing away of the apostles. Lastly, some have argued that the Pastorals condemn forms of Hellenic mysticism and gnosticism, which were seen as not significant in the 1st century; that said, some scholarship of 1st-century Gnosticism has suggested an earlier dominance of Gnostic views.

===Hebrews===

Unlike the thirteen epistles above, the Epistle to the Hebrews is internally anonymous. Moreover, scholars such as Robert Grant have noted the many obvious differences in language and style between Hebrews and the correspondence explicitly ascribed to Paul.

Church Fathers and ante-Nicene writers such as Tertullian noted the different manner in which the theology and doctrine of the epistle appear. This variance led many to name other candidates for authorship, such as the fellow traveller of Paul called Barnabas (favored by Tertullian), a follower of John the Baptist called Apollos (favored by Martin Luther and several modern scholars), as well as less likely candidates such as Silas and even Priscilla.

Origen of Alexandria (), as quoted by Eusebius () had this to say on the matter: &quot;That the character of the diction of the epistle entitled To the Hebrews has not the apostle&#x27;s rudeness in speech, who confessed himself rude in speech, that is, in style, but that the epistle is better Greek in the framing of its diction, will be admitted by everyone who is able to discern differences of style. But again, on the other hand, that the thoughts of the epistle are admirable, and not inferior to the acknowledged writings of the apostle, to this also everyone will consent as true who has given attention to reading the apostle…. But as for myself, if I were to state my own opinion, I should say that the thoughts are the apostle&#x27;s, but that the style and composition belonged to one who called to mind the apostle&#x27;s teachings and, as it were, made short notes of what his master said. If any church, therefore, holds this epistle as Paul&#x27;s, let it be commended for this also. For not without reason have the men of old handed it down as Paul&#x27;s. But who wrote the epistle, in truth God knows. Yet the account which has reached us [is twofold], some saying that Clement, who was bishop of the Romans, wrote the epistle, others, that it was Luke, he who wrote the Gospel and the Acts.&quot;

Modern scholars consider the evidence against Pauline authorship of &quot;Hebrews&quot; too solid for dispute. Donald Guthrie, in his &quot;New Testament Introduction&quot; (1976), commented that &quot;most modern writers find more difficulty in imagining how this Epistle was ever attributed to Paul than in disposing of the theory.&quot; Harold Attridge states that &quot;it is certainly not a work of the apostle&quot;; Daniel Wallace states, &quot;the arguments against Pauline authorship [...] are conclusive.&quot; As a result, few supporters of Pauline authorship remain. As Richard Heard notes, in his &quot;Introduction to The New Testament&quot;, &quot;modern critics have confirmed that the epistle cannot be attributed to Paul and have for the most part agreed with Origen&#x27;s judgement, &#x27;But as to who wrote the epistle, God knows the truth.&#x27;&quot;

==History of the Pauline canon==
There are no preserved lists of a Christian New Testament canon from the 1st century and early 2nd century.

The Second Epistle of Peter, a pseudepigrapha written between 60-130 and attributed to Saint Peter refers to the Pauline epistles, but does not specify which ones it is referring to.

Pope Clement I (c. 35-99 AD) quotes from 1 Corinthians and alludes to Paul&#x27;s epistles to the Romans, Galatians, Ephesians, and Philippians, Titus, 1 Timothy, numerous phrases from the Epistle to the Hebrews, and possible material from the Acts of the Apostles.

Ignatius of Antioch (died c. 110 AD) appears to have quoted from Romans, 1 Corinthians, Ephesians, Colossians, and 1 Thessalonians.

Polycarp of Smyrna (69–156 AD) not only quoted from 2 Thessalonians but also the Gospel of Matthew, Gospel of Mark, Gospel of Luke, Acts of the Apostles, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, Epistle to the Hebrews, 1 Peter, 1 John, 3 John.

The Epistle of Barnabas, written between 96 and 135, quotes from Galatians.

Clement of Alexandria (c. 150-215 AD) quotes all the books of the New Testament with the exception of Philemon, James, 2 Peter, and 2 and 3 John.

The earliest extant canon containing Paul&#x27;s letters is from the 2nd century:

* It is a canon compiled by Marcion, the founder of Marcionism. Marcion did not include any of the modern Gospels, only his Gospel of Marcion, which according to his enemies he had edited from the Gospel of Luke, whereas he claimed that it was their version which was edited from his &quot;original gospel&quot;. He includes ten epistles by Paul, omitting the Pastoral Epistles (Titus, 1 and 2 Timothy), as well as &quot;To the Hebrews&quot;.
* The Muratorian fragment (c. 140) accepts all Pauline epistles as authentic, but does not mention the Epistle to the Hebrews and rejects the Epistle to the Laodiceans and the Epistle to the Alexandrians as spurious.
* Papyrus 46, one of the oldest New Testament manuscripts (c. 200), contains the last eight chapters of Romans; all of Hebrews; virtually all of 1–2 Corinthians; all of Ephesians, Galatians, Philippians, Colossians; and two chapters of 1 Thessalonians. Because it is damaged there is no scholarly consensus on whether to consider the omission of a text definitive.

==Historical criticism of the authorship of the epistles==
In the nineteenth century, a group of scholars at the University of Tübingen, led by Ferdinand Christian Baur, engaged in radical bible study, including the claim that only Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and Galatians were authored by Paul (i.e. &quot;Hauptbriefe&quot;). During the same period, another group of Dutch scholars led by Allard Pierson (Dutch Radical School), argued that all Pauline epistles were pseudepigrapha, a view that was also shared by Bruno Bauer, Rudolf Steck and Arthur Drews.

<doc id="1283664" wikidata="Q1872169" url="?curid=1283664" title="Louise McKinney">
<text>Louise McKinney (; 22 September 186810 July 1931) was a Canadian politician, temperance advocate, and women&#x27;s rights activist. She was the first woman elected into the Legislative Assembly of Alberta and the first woman to serve in a legislature in the British Empire. She served in the Alberta legislature from 1917 to 1921 as a member of the Non-Partisan League. Later she was one of the Famous Five who campaigned successfully for the right of Canadian women to be appointed to the Senate. A former schoolteacher and temperance organizer, she came to Alberta in 1903 as a homesteader.

McKinney was heavily involved in the Methodist Church and the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union, and she served as president of the Alberta branch for 22 years, from 1908 to 1930. In 1930, she was elected president of the Dominion WCTU, and organized the 1931 World Convention in Toronto. McKinney supported stricter immigration laws and the creation of institutions for &quot;feeble-minded&quot; people. In 2009, the Senate of Canada voted to make McKinney and other members of the Famous Five Canada&#x27;s first honorary Senators.

== Early life ==
McKinney was born Louise Crummy on 22 September 1868 in Frankville, Ontario, the sixth of ten children of Richard Crummy and Esther Empey. Her father had emigrated from Ireland to settle in Upper Canada in 1842, later bringing his wife in 1857. McKinney graduated from Athens High School intending to become a physician but faced difficulty entering medical school due to her gender. Instead, she attended Ottawa Normal School to become a teacher. She taught for four years in Ontario before moving to North Dakota, where she taught for three more years.

== Involvement in the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union ==
While teaching in North Dakota, McKinney became interested in the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union. In 1894 she became one of the union&#x27;s local organizers, travelling around the state to preach about the dangers of alcohol. While working in this capacity, she met James McKinney, whom she married in March 1896. They had one son, Williard, named after Frances Williard, the founder of the WCTU. She was elected as the North Dakota WCTU&#x27;s District President in 1898 and represented her area at the National Convention the following year. The McKinneys continued to farm in North Dakota until 1903, when they moved to the Northwest Territories (present-day Alberta) and settled near Claresholm.

Within a few weeks of arriving in Alberta, McKinney set out to establish a local branch of the WCTU. The following year, she met with women from across the North-West Territories to discuss forming a larger union. The North-West Territories&#x27; WCTU was established. It was later renamed the Alberta and Saskatchewan WCTU when those provinces were formed in 1905. By 1912, the organization had so many members that it split into a separate group for each province. McKinney served as president of the Alberta WCTU for 22 years, from 1908 to 1930. For the same period, she served as vice-president of the Dominion WCTU. In 1930, she was voted president of the Dominion WCTU and organized the 1931 World Convention in Toronto, where she was elected vice-president of the World WCTU.

== Political career ==
 McKinney ran for a seat in the Alberta Legislature for the electoral district of Claresholm in the 1917 general election, the first election in which women were allowed to vote. She defeated Liberal incumbent William Moffat as a candidate for the Non-Partisan League. In winning the election, she became the first woman elected to a legislature in the British Empire. Much of her term in office was focused on working towards more effective prohibition, and she gained a reputation as a capable debater. Together with Henrietta Muir Edwards, she drafted and introduced a motion which ensured widows would receive a portion of their husbands&#x27; estate. After passing, it became known as the Dower Act.

Several of her fellow Famous Five members, including Parlby, Murphy, and McClung, were supporters of the eugenics movement in Alberta. It is not known if McKinney supported mandatory sterilization of &quot;mental defectives.&quot; She advocated the creation of institutions to care for feeble-minded people and to prevent their procreation. McKinney promoted stricter immigration laws.

She ran for a second term in the 1921 Alberta general election as a United Farmers candidate. She was defeated by independent candidate Thomas Milnes by a margin of 46 votes. She never ran for political office again.

She remained active in the social and political sphere, especially with the WCTU. She was one of four women, and the only woman from Western Canada, who signed the Basis of Union for the United Church of Canada in 1925.

== Persons Case ==

McKinney was one of the Famous Five, along with Irene Parlby, Henrietta Muir Edwards, Emily Murphy and Nellie McClung, a group of five women who fought for the right to be considered &quot;persons&quot; and be eligible to serve in the Senate of Canada. The case is officially titled &quot;Edwards v Canada (AG)&quot; but is popularly known as the Persons Case. In 1927, the case was taken to the Supreme Court of Canada, which ruled that women were not eligible to serve in the Senate. In 1929, the Five appealed the ruling at the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, Canada&#x27;s highest court at the time. The Judicial Committee overturned the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision, and the first woman, Cairine Wilson, was appointed to the Senate the following year.

== Death and honours ==
McKinney fell ill during the WCTU World Convention in June 1931, and her sickness became worse after her return to Claresholm. She died after returning home the following month, less than two years after her victory in the Persons Case. Her death came as a shock to the WCTU, and tributes came from across the country and the world.

In 1939, the government of Canada recognized McKinney as a Person of National Historic Significance. A plaque commemorating this is on display at the post office in Claresholm. In 1997, the Persons Case was recognized as a National Historic Event. In 2000, two identical monuments were created in Calgary, Alberta, and near the Senate of Canada Building, in Ottawa, Ontario. The monuments, called &quot;Women are Persons!&quot;, depict the members of the Famous Five reading the news about their victory in the Persons Case. The monuments were later featured on the $50 banknote of the Canadian Journey series. In October 2009, the Senate voted to name McKinney and the rest of the Famous Five Canada&#x27;s first &quot;honorary senators&quot;.

<doc id="1283665" wikidata="Q5600765" url="?curid=1283665" title="Greater Sudbury City Council">
<text>Greater Sudbury City Council () is the governing body of the City of Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.

The council consists of the mayor plus a twelve-person council. The city is divided into twelve wards; each ward is represented by one councillor. The council meets at Tom Davies Square.

The city was created by amalgamating the former City of Sudbury with six suburban municipalities on January 1, 2001. Initially, the council structure consisted of six wards, each represented by two councillors. Ward boundaries in the new city were drawn by grouping former suburban municipalities with adjacent neighbourhoods in the former city. For the 2006 municipal election, council was reorganized into twelve single-member wards.

Past mayors of the city and the former suburban municipalities are listed at List of mayors of Sudbury, Ontario.

==2000–2003==
Council elected in the 2000 municipal election:

==2003–2006==
Council elected in the 2003 municipal election:

==2006–2010==
Council elected in the 2006 municipal election:

==2010–2014==
Council elected in the 2010 municipal election.

As the vacancies in wards 1 and 8 occurred less than six months prior to the 2014 municipal election, by provincial law both were required to be filled by temporary appointment to the seat rather than in a conventional by-election. Sizer was appointed on June 26 to succeed Belli, and McIntaggart was appointed on July 8 to succeed Cimino. Unlike many cities in similar circumstances, Greater Sudbury City Council opted &quot;not&quot; to impose a requirement that the appointed councillors could not run for reelection in 2014; Sizer chose to run as a candidate and won reelection, while McIntaggart did not run.

==2014–2018==
Council elected in the 2014 municipal election.

==2018–2022==
Council elected in the 2018 municipal election.
==2022–2026==
Council elected in the 2022 municipal election.

<text>Burkholderia is a genus of Pseudomonadota whose pathogenic members include the &quot;Burkholderia cepacia&quot; complex, which attacks humans and &quot;Burkholderia mallei&quot;, responsible for glanders, a disease that occurs mostly in horses and related animals; &quot;Burkholderia pseudomallei&quot;, causative agent of melioidosis; and &quot;Burkholderia cepacia&quot;, an important pathogen of pulmonary infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). &quot;Burkholderia&quot; species is also found in marine environments. S.I. Paul et al. (2021) isolated and characterized &quot;Burkholderia cepacia&quot; from marine sponges of the Saint Martin&#x27;s Island of the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh.

The &quot;Burkholderia&quot; (previously part of &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;) genus name refers to a group of virtually ubiquitous Gram-negative, obligately aerobic, rod-shaped bacteria that are motile by means of single or multiple polar flagella, with the exception of &quot;Burkholderia mallei&quot;, which is nonmotile. Members belonging to the genus do not produce sheaths or prosthecae and are able to use poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) for growth. The genus includes both animal and plant pathogens, as well as some environmentally important species. In particular, &quot;B. xenovorans&quot; (previously named &quot;Pseudomonas cepacia&quot; then &quot;B. cepacia&quot; and &quot;B. fungorum&quot;) is renowned for being catalase positive (affecting patients with chronic granulomatous disease) and its ability to degrade chlororganic pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls. The conserved RNA structure anti-hemB RNA motif is found in all known bacteria in this genus.

Due to their antibiotic resistance and the high mortality rate from their associated diseases, &quot;B. mallei&quot; and &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; are considered to be potential biological warfare agents, targeting livestock and humans.

==History==
The genus was named after Walter H. Burkholder, plant pathologist at Cornell University. The first species placed in the genus were transfers from &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, on the basis of various biochemical tests.

Until recently, the genus &quot;Burkholderia&quot; was inclusive of all &quot;Paraburkholderia&quot; species. However, the genus &quot;Paraburkholderia&quot; is phylogenetically distinct, and can be distinguished from all &quot;Burkholderia&quot; species on the basis of molecular signatures that are uniquely found for each genus.

==Taxonomy== 
&quot;Burkholderia&quot; species form a monophyletic group within the Burkholderiales order of the Betaproteobacteria. Currently, the 48 validly named species can be distinguished from related genera (i.e. &quot;Paraburkholderia&quot;) and all other bacteria by conserved signature indels in a variety of proteins. These indels represent exclusive common ancestry shared among all &quot;Burkholderia&quot; species.

The genus has three distinct monophyletic clusters. One group consists of all species belonging to the &quot;Burkholderia cepacia&quot; complex, another clade comprises &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; and closely related species, and the last clade encompasses of most of the phytogenic species within the genus, including &quot;B. glumae&quot; and &quot;B. gladioli &quot;. Conserved signature indels are specific for each of these subgroups within the genus that aid in demarcating members of this extremely large and diverse genus.

== Research ==
Recently, research in &quot;Burkholderia&quot; species has investigated a range of topics and characteristics including metabolomic response to antibiotics, contact-dependent interactions between bacterial communities, and genomic potential to yield beneficial products.

In &quot;Burkholderia&quot; species, certain antibiotics such as trimethoprim has been shown to induce and upregulate a large amount of the metabolome, inducing over 100 silent secondary metabolite gene clusters in &quot;Burkholderia thailandensis.&quot; These global activators can be used as a source of investigation into how the metabolomes of pathogenic bacterial species respond to antibiotic stress and how bacterial species can vary in response to them. It has been shown that closely related cystic fibrosis-associated &quot;Burkholderia&quot; species respond to trimethoprim with differing levels of expression of various secondary metabolites, highlighting the personalized nature of metabolomics in related bacterial strains.

Research focused on interbacterial signaling using &quot;Burkholderia&quot; has shown that contact-dependent growth inhibition plays a significant role in mediating cell to cell communication specifically in &quot;B. thailandensis&quot;. In this interaction, cells release protein toxins to the surrounding environment, and only those with a corresponding protective protein (usually bacteria of the same strain) will not have its growth inhibited or die. Furthermore, recipient cells that have the corresponding protein then undergo changes to gene expression and phenotype that promotes community formation in the form of biofilms. This occurs even if the recipient cell was not of the same bacterial strain which highlights the importance of this system. The genes that encode the protein toxins and the rest of the contact-dependent inhibition system can become mobile in the form of a transposon that can transfer between cells and is critical to communal aspect of the system. Thus, contact-dependent signaling plays a significant role in bacterial self recognition and community formation.

&quot;Burkholderia&quot; species have been shown to be a potential source of beneficial products such as antimicrobials and biosurfactants. Along with the related genus &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, &quot;Burkholderia&quot; can synthesize a particular class of biosurfactant called rhamnolipids. Rhamnolipids synthesized by &quot;Burkholderia&quot; have differing chemical characteristics (compared to those synthesized by &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;) and thus have the potential for novel applications.

<text>A blobject is a design product, often a brightly-coloured household object which has smooth curves and no sharp edges. The word is a portmanteau of &quot;blob&quot; and &quot;object&quot;.

Blobjects can be made of any material in any size or scale for the home, office, car, or outdoors. Common materials used in fabricating blobjects are plastic (especially polycarbonate, polypropylene, or polyethylene), metal, and rubber, with the aim being to give a more organic and animate feel.

==Etymology==
The origin of the term is disputed, but it is often attributed to either the designer-author Steven Skov Holt or the designer Karim Rashid.

Holt has defined a blobject as a colorful, mass-produced, plastic-based, emotionally-engaging consumer product with a curvilinear, flowing shape. This fluid and curvaceous form is the blobject&#x27;s most distinctive feature.

Rashid, the contemporary designer who wrote the book &quot;I Want to Change the World&quot;, was an early leader in creating blobjects and has become one of the most celebrated designers of his generation.

==Overview==
While often viewed as a modern concept, Blobject can be traced all the way back to prehistoric sculptures like Venus of Willendorf. In the early 20th century, in the work of Joan Miró and Jean Arp, these characteristics appeared. After World War II, these design started appearing in home goods like La Chaise chair.

In the 1990s, designers like Philippe Starck, Marc Newson, and Karim Rashid led the way with the use of technology. Many of the most famous blobjects appeared in this decade.

Blobjects can also be found in most areas of contemporary visual culture. A blobject can be a typographic font (cf. Neville Brody), an animation (cf. Monica Peon), a piece of furniture (Marc Newson), an article of clothing (Rei Kawakubo), a motorcycle (GK Dynamics), a car (GEMCAR), a building (Future Systems), a painting (Rex Ray), a piece of sculpture (Hadeki Matsumoto), or ceramics work (Ken Price).

The blobject trend has largely been driven by advances in computer-aided design, information visualization, rapid prototyping, materials, and injection molding. These technologies have given designers the chance to use new shapes and to explore transparency and translucency without significant extra production costs.

<text>Link Real Estate Investment Trust (, or ), previously known as The Link Real Estate Investment Trust (, or ), is a wholly-owned private real estate investment trust managed by Link Asset Management Limited. It is the first real estate investment trust in Hong Kong and the largest in Asia by market capitalisation. 

Link REIT&#x27;s portfolio consists of 126 properties with about 9 million sq ft of retail and office space in Hong Kong, as well as 7 properties with about 6 million sq ft of retail and office space outside Hong Kong.

Link REIT has its head office at in Kwun Tong.

==History==
The LINK REIT was established by the Hong Kong government, which hived off assets from the Hong Kong Housing Authority that included 151 retail facilities – mainly within public housing estates – and 79,000 parking spaces. The date for the listing was 25 November 2005, at a valuation of HK$22.02 billion (Valuation = 2,137,454,000 x HK$10.30 = HK$22.02 Billion) (US$2.82 billion). Upon privatisation, Link Reit remains tied to terms in existing tenancy agreements, but will no longer require approval from government to increase rents for new leases. However, financial analysts expected attractive dividend yields – up to 7 per cent – from the privatised company and greater commercial orientation, although some feared that the scope for increasing rental income and cutting labour costs might be limited due to most of its properties being tied to the public housing sector.

===Initial public offering===
IPO of The Link REIT, delayed for a year until 2005 through legal action by housing tenants worried that rents would rise, was eventually 18 times oversubscribed. About 510,000 Hong Kong residents, or seven percent of the city&#x27;s population, placed US$36 billion of orders while institutional investors were ready to commit US$40 billion.

The IPO&#x27;s joint global coordinators were Goldman Sachs, HSBC Holdings plc, and UBS AG. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. was the financial adviser to the Housing Authority.

The proposed flotation of The Link REIT by the Housing Authority was delayed when a public housing tenant, Lo Siu-lan, challenged the legality of the proposed divestment of the properties. Lo&#x27;s lawyer submitted that the Housing Authority had &quot;breached its duty under the Housing Ordinance to provide housing to people in need. Instead, it was selling assets to a private company, which could sublet the properties at market rates rather than benefiting the underprivileged&quot;. She represented a concern among many residents of public housing that existing amenities would no longer be public and that The Link would raise rents, thereby forcing price rises in shops without due consideration of the public good. Some NGOs also were concerned that the reduced income of the Housing Authority would eventually lead to rent rises for public tenants. Lo&#x27;s request for judicial review of the privatisation was rejected at the Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeal.

Since the listing in 2005, Link has engaged in a process of &#x27;asset enhancement works&#x27;, seeking to raise the value of the properties through upgraded physical structure, replacing low-end utility local shops with higher-paying brands and chains, enhanced &#x27;customer service&#x27;, and promotional activities. The Link also overhauled many of the wet markets under its management. The renovations have led to higher rents, higher prices, and the loss of local shops.

===Acquisition of properties===
In moves to diversify its property portfolio and mix, Link acquired the shopping mall portion of Nan Fung Centre with parking facilities in Hang Hau, from Nan Fung Group mid 2010 for a total of $1.17 billion.

In late 2010, Link acquired the shopping mall portion of Maritime Bay Shopping Mall with parking facilities in Hang Hau, from Sino Group, for a total of $588.4 million

In mid 2014, Link acquired The Lions Rise Mall with parking facilities in Wong Tai Sin, from Kerry Properties, for a total of $1.38 billion.

In 2015, The Link took its first step in purchasing by government land auction when it partnered with Nan Fung Group to buy land lot NKIL 6512 in Kwun Tong for a total of $5.86 billion in January. Then, Link surprised the market by successively making its first two purchases in mainland China, when it acquired Beijing EC Mall, for a consideration of ¥2.5 billion; it acquired two commercial buildings in Shanghai for ¥6.6 billion. The company has a target where mainland properties would not exceed 12.5% of its portfolio.

On 19 February 2016, a subsidiary of the Link purchased the Trade and Industry Department Tower in Mong Kok (formerly the Argyle Centre Tower II) from the government for a sum of HK$5.91 billion.

In April 2020, LINK REIT completed its purchase of 100 Market Street in Sydney at approximately AUD683 million from Blackstone Group. It is a building is 10-storeys office tower of 28,385 square metre above the Westfield mall in Sydney&#x27;s CBD.

===Sale of properties===
In mid-2014, Link REIT sold four commercial properties, to four different buyers, for a total of $1.24 billion. The properties are Hing Tin Commercial Centre (in Lam Tin), Kwai Hing Shopping Centre (Kwai Chung), the Tung Hei Court shopping centre (Shau Kei Wan), and Wah Kwai Shopping Centre (Pokfulam).

In late 2015, they sold five properties, namely: Fung Wah Estate Retail and Car Park, Ka Fuk Shopping Centre, Kwong Tin Shopping Centre, Siu On Court Retail and Car Park, and Tin Wan Shopping Centre.

In late 2016, they sold five properties again, namely: Sui Wo Court Commercial Centre, On Yam Shopping Centre, Sun Tin Wai Commercial Centre, Cheung Hong Commercial Centre and Shek Wai Kok Commercial Centre.

===Green Bond===
In July 2016, Link REIT issue a green convertible bonds, raising US$500 million at 2.875% fixed rate due 2026.

===Change of Name===
On 19 August 2015, Link announced the changing of its corporate name to Link REIT. Some have alleged that the purpose of the name change is to disassociate itself from its past activities.

==Reception==

===Economic hardship on lower classes===
The Link was called a &quot;bloodsucker&quot; by public housing estate residents after the company acquired the Housing Authority shopping centres, renovated them, and raised rents. This has led to local shops being pushed out, higher prices, and the dominance of chain stores within the estates. This trend has reduced entrepreneurship opportunities for lower income people in Hong Kong&#x27;s public housing estates and new towns, diminishing their chances to achieve social mobility, and has increased the cost of living.

A 2012 campaign by The Link to promote &quot;nostalgic restaurants&quot; in its shopping centres was widely derided on social media as hypocritical. Users on Golden Forum and Facebook wrote that the company &quot;first killed the shops, then makes money from their death&quot; and criticised the company for only allowing chain stores in their properties.
In 2006, The Link cut thousands of staff, a move &quot;fiercely criticised by unionists, who said Link Management had dishonoured a pledge to protect the welfare of its frontline workers when it took over the operation from the Housing Authority&quot;. The Link replied that &quot;the job cuts were in line with private practice&quot;.

By mid 2015, NGO Link Watch () published a report that showed big chains made up 76 per cent of the 2,075 shops in 22 shopping centres run by the firm, but the Link&#x27;s CEO claimed, &quot;We continue to maintain roughly 60 per cent of our shops leased to smaller operators.&quot;

Anti-Link REIT protests have become increasingly common in recent years. Link REIT headquarters in Kwun Tong has been the site of demonstrations, scuffles, and sit-ins, leading the company to seek a court order to bar activists from entering the building.

===Market management===

In addition to indoor shopping centres, The Link also acquired many local estate markets in 2005. Such markets are covered facilities with small stalls and shops let out to local residents, generally offering fresh meat and vegetables as well as daily necessities and home wares. As with the shopping centres, The Link has raised rents and also renovated some properties, leading to increased food prices and financial hardship on low-income households.

In Tin Shui Wai, where The Link exercises a near-monopoly on commercial space, the company was criticised by local residents and Legislative Councillors in 2015–16 for planning to convert the Tin Yiu Market into a conventional shopping centre. The market supplies fresh vegetables, meat, and fish to residents of the surrounding public housing estates. The next closest market is 5 to 10 minutes&#x27; walk away.

Stall operators at Cheung Fat Estate on Tsing Yi have gone on strike, in 2010 and 2016, to protest rent increases. By the latter strike it was reported that rents had doubled in ten years. Some local residents stated that they visit a government-run market in Tsuen Wan instead owing to the higher prices at Cheung Fat. The Cheung Fat stall owners also protested the outsourcing of the market&#x27;s management to Uni-China (Market) Management Limited, which they feared will lead to untenable rent increases.

Uni-China (Market) Management also manages the market at Leung King Estate in Tuen Mun, which is also owned by The Link. In February 2016 a group of men dressed in dark jackets with &quot;manager&quot; (管理員) printed on the backs acted in an intimidating manner toward hawkers in the area of the shopping centre since 2 February. More than 200 showed up to protest against the men combating hawkers on the night of 8 February. Some minor clashes broke out between the self-proclaimed managers and the protesters, and required mediation by the police. Two protesters were arrested and one reporter was injured during the clash.

Conflicts between the management and the public reoccurred on the night of 9 February. The men were filmed beating up protesters while police stood by and prevented others from being involved. A reporter was also beaten up by the control team. A 31-year-old man was arrested for causing disorder in a public place. He allegedly interfered with a worker performing his duties at Leung King Estate. The Link REIT distanced itself from the clashes and denied the hawker control team was part of its staff.

===Illegal wastewater discharges===
In 2016 the Environmental Protection Department initiated prosecution against the Link REIT under the Water Pollution Control Ordinance because wastewater from the Mei Lam Shopping Centre, owned and managed by the Link, was being illegally discharged into the Shing Mun River. The company was fined $15,000 in November 2016 and ordered to rectify the situation immediately.

===Bloodsucking landlord===
Due to its history as monopoly landlord of community shopping malls, controversial business ethics and unfriendly treatment to neighbourhoods, small business owners and investors. The company is well known as a &quot;bloodsucking landlord&quot; as bipartisan parties has put it over the years for its unyielding fist on its tenants. According to Richard Harris&#x27;s opinion, Link Reit has been widely considered a &quot;corporate monster&quot; in Hong Kong partly responsible for the city&#x27;s socioeconomic issues.

=== Ill managed rodent issue during COVID-19 ===
In Aug 2020, dozens of rats were found crawling over fresh pork laid on the floor outside the vendor during the early hours in Link REIT&#x27;s Sau Mau Ping wet market.

=== Effects of renovation on air quality and pollution ===

==Government response==

Link REIT has been widely condemned by officials on both sides of the political spectrum. Starry Lee, chairperson of the pro-Beijing DAB, reported that former chief executive Leung Chun-ying &quot;strongly criticised&quot; Link REIT in a meeting with the DAB. In an interview with the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot;, Leung questioned whether the remuneration structure for top management of Link REIT had led to the trust&#x27;s behaviour. He said that, as the previous owner of the public housing commercial space, the Hong Kong government has a responsibility to public housing tenants &quot;to satisfy their needs and if necessary to provide alternatives to Link REIT properties&quot;. He said that a Link REIT monopoly in public estates was not acceptable as elderly tenants could not be expected to carry their heavy shopping to and from other markets. He said there was no plan to buy back the Link, but the government could explore providing alternatives if the Link was not serving nearby residents.

Carrie Lam, ex-Hong Kong chief executive, was reported in 2016 to have called Link REIT one of the &quot;three mountains&quot; – i.e. one of the major sources of contention in Hong Kong society – that the government sought to conquer. Lam stated that the government should explore different avenues toward tackling the problem, including launching a potential legal battle against the company.

Similarly, in April 2019, legislator Alice Mak moved a motion in the Legislative Council urging the government to &quot;overcome the &#x27;three big mountains&#x27;&quot; that she wrote had plagued the local community, one of which is Link REIT. Various other legislators moved motions to this amendment suggesting means of tackling the problem, including amending the Housing Ordinance to regulate rent increases; constructing more public markets and bazaars to diminish Link REIT&#x27;s commercial monopoly in many areas, and provide residents with greater shopping choices; creating a dedicated team within the Lands Department to inspect Link REIT properties, and to conduct enforcement against violations of land lease conditions by the company; and buying back Link REIT properties and placing them back under government management.

<doc id="1283675" wikidata="Q724576" url="?curid=1283675" title="Christopher Priest (comic book writer)">
<text>Christopher James Priest (born James Christopher Owsley , June 30, 1961) is an American comic book writer who is at times credited simply as Priest. He changed his name legally circa 1993. He was the first black writer-editor in mainstream comics.

==Comics writing==
Priest (as Jim Owsley) entered the comics industry as a Marvel Comics intern in 1978. He joined Marvel&#x27;s editorial staff in 1979, working for Paul Laikin as a managing editor on &quot;Crazy Magazine&quot; and becoming the first African American editor in mainstream comics. He next became assistant editor for Larry Hama on the &quot;Conan&quot; titles.

Owsley made his professional debut as a writer in 1983 with issue No. 1 of &quot;The Falcon&quot; miniseries and was made full editor of the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; comic books from 1985 to 1986. Professional and personal disagreements eventually led to his leaving Marvel. Owsley&#x27;s writing tenure on &quot;Power Man and Iron Fist&quot; concluded with Iron Fist&#x27;s controversial death.

Moving to DC Comics, Owsley had a run as writer of Green Lantern when the character was exclusive to the anthology series &quot;Action Comics Weekly&quot; from 1988 to 1989. Owsley wrote the &quot;Green Lantern&quot; serial issues #601–607, left part way through a story arc and then returned for issues #621–635. He worked with artists Gil Kane and Tod Smith during his first run, and then upon his return, with artist M. D. Bright. Owsley would write two &quot;Green Lantern Special&quot;s, the second issue concluding the plots left off from the end of &quot;Action Comics Weekly&quot;, with Bright drawing. They would work again on the first issue of &quot;Green Lantern: Emerald Dawn&quot; before Owsley departed. He edited several titles in DC Comics&#x27; Impact Comics imprint from 1991 to 1993.

As a writer, Owsley/Priest worked on the series &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;, &quot;King Conan&quot;, &quot;The Ray&quot;, &quot;Steel&quot;, &quot;Deadpool&quot;, and &quot;Black Panther&quot; vol. 3. He co-created the series &quot;Quantum and Woody&quot;, &quot;Xero&quot;, and &quot;The Crew&quot;, among others.

In 1993, he became part of the group of writers and artists that launched Milestone Media, a comic book publisher affiliated with DC Comics. He has said he was intended to become the company&#x27;s editor-in-chief, but personal problems forced him to scale down his involvement to liaison between DC and Milestone. During this period, he co-created the character Static, among others. 

Shortly afterward, he changed his name from &quot;Jim Owsley&quot; to &quot;Christopher Priest&quot; for reasons he has not discussed publicly other than in one remark in an interview about becoming a priest if his marriage, which later ended in divorce, did not last. During Owsley&#x27;s &quot;Green Lantern&quot; run, prior to his name change, he introduced a character named Priest. He has stated he was unaware of the British science fiction novelist Christopher Priest. He refers to himself professionally as either the mononym &quot;Priest&quot; or &quot;Christopher J. Priest&quot;.

After a decade-long absence from comics, he returned in 2014–2015 to write a &quot;Quantum and Woody&quot; miniseries for Valiant Comics. He was chosen to write the DC Rebirth version of &quot;Deathstroke&quot; in 2016. He became the writer for &quot;Justice League&quot; in December 2017, but was replaced by Scott Snyder in 2018. Priest contributed a story to the &quot;Black Panther Annual&quot; No. 1, released in February 2018. In 2019 he was announced as the writer on &quot;Vampirella&quot; for Dynamite Comics and &quot;U.S.Agent&quot; for Marvel Comics.

==Music==
Priest is a singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist music producer who has written and produced dozens of tracks for himself and others. &quot;Streetwise&quot;, Priest&#x27;s first solo album, recorded under the stage name &quot;Hollis Stone,&quot; was released on vinyl on March 3, 1981. It featured a cover photo by Eliot R. Brown of the
then-Jim Owsley standing in front of the Marvel Comics office building at 575 Madison Avenue.

In 1993, Priest co-produced &quot;Live! Minister Darryl Cherry and the Covenant Mass Choir&quot; (RWM-4445), a full concert multitrack recording featuring an 85-voice choir and 10-piece band including Priest playing bass guitar on two selections. The album was recorded before a live concert audience in New Brunswick, New Jersey.

==Personal life==
Priest is an ordained Baptist minister, and maintains an extensive archive of progressive Christian ecumenical essays on his website PraiseNet.Org. Priest resides in Denver, Colorado.

<text>Orin Samuel Kerr (born June 2, 1971) is an American legal scholar and professor of law at the UC Berkeley School of Law. He is known for his studies of American criminal procedure and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as well as computer crime law and internet surveillance. Kerr is one of the contributors to the law-oriented blog titled &quot;The Volokh Conspiracy&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Kerr was born in 1971 in New York. His father, Arnold D. Kerr (born Aronek Kierszkowski; 1928–2012), was a Polish Jew who was the only member of his family to survive the Holocaust; he immigrated to the United States in 1954 and was a professor of civil engineering at New York University and the University of Delaware. 

After graduating from Tower Hill School in Wilmington, Delaware, in 1989, Kerr studied mechanical engineering and aerospace engineering at Princeton University, graduating in 1993 with a Bachelor of Science in Engineering, &quot;magna cum laude&quot;. He then did graduate study in mechanical engineering at Stanford University, where he received a Master of Science degree in 1994. Kerr then attended Harvard Law School, where he was an executive editor of the &quot;Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy&quot; and an editor of the &quot;Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology&quot;. He graduated in 1997 with a Juris Doctor, &quot;magna cum laude&quot;.

==Career==
Kerr was a law clerk for Judge Leonard I. Garth of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit from 1997 to 1998. From 1998 to 2001, he was a trial attorney in the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section of the U.S. Department of Justice&#x27;s Criminal Division. In 2001, he joined the faculty of George Washington University Law School.

In 2003, Kerr took a leave of absence from the law school to clerk for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy of the United States Supreme Court during October Term 2003. In 2009, he served U.S. Senator John Cornyn of the Senate Judiciary Committee as Special Counsel for Supreme Court Nominations during Sonia Sotomayor&#x27;s confirmation as Supreme Court Justice; a year later, he again served as an advisor to Cornyn, this time on the Supreme Court confirmation of Elena Kagan.

Kerr was one of the lawyers for alleged MySpace &quot;cyberbully&quot; Lori Drew. His blog contributions at &quot;The Volokh Conspiracy&quot; often focus on developments in internet privacy law. He has been regarded as a leading scholar on Fourth Amendment jurisprudence in electronic communications and surveillance. Kerr was repeatedly cited in the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s 2008 opinion &quot;Quon v. Arch Wireless Operating Co., Inc.&quot;, which held that users have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the content of text messages and e-mails. The Supreme Court later took up the case, as &quot;Ontario v. Quon&quot;, and unanimously reversed. Kerr argued before the Supreme Court in the 2011 case &quot;Davis v. United States&quot;.

In response to a 2011 comment by Chief Justice John Roberts criticizing the irrelevancy of legal scholarship for focusing on issues such as Immanuel Kant&#x27;s influence on 18th century evidentiary approaches in Bulgaria, Kerr wrote a short, humorous paper on the topic in 2015, finding that such influence was highly improbable.

===Academia===
In 2012, he was appointed to a position as a scholar-in-residence at the Library of Congress; the two-year part-time position focused on information technology, privacy, and criminal justice. In 2018, Kerr joined the faculty of the USC Gould School of Law. In 2019, Kerr joined the faculty of the UC Berkeley School of Law.

<doc id="1283679" wikidata="Q5303533" url="?curid=1283679" title="Downtown Orlando">
<text>Downtown Orlando is the historic core and central business district of Orlando, Florida, United States. It is bordered by Marks Street in the north, Mills Avenue (SR 15) in the east, Orange Blossom Trail (US 441) in the west, and Kaley Avenue in the south. There are several distinct neighborhoods in downtown; &quot;North Quarter&quot; to the north, &quot;Lake Eola Heights Historic District&quot; just north of Lake Eola, &quot;South Eola&quot; contains Lake Eola Park and continues to the east and south of Lake Eola, &quot;Thornton Park&quot; in the east, &quot;Parramore&quot; in the west, &quot;Lake Cherokee Historic District&quot; to the south, and the &quot;Central Business District&quot; (or the &quot;Financial District&quot;) between Colonial Drive and Lake Lucerne in the center. In 2010, the estimated population of downtown was 18,731. The daytime population was estimated to be 65,000 (in 2010). The 5-mile radius population of downtown is 273,335.

== Overview ==
Downtown Orlando is the largest of urban centers in Central Florida. It is home to residential and commercial towers; local, state, and federal government offices; sports facilities; performing arts theaters; art galleries; retail; restaurants; nightclubs; and parks. Downtown is removed from the tourist areas located in the southwestern half of the city, but it draws visitors seeking to experience the &quot;Real Orlando&quot;. It is also the location of numerous festivals, parades, concerts, political demonstrations, and other high-profile events.

== Geography ==

There are seven official neighborhoods with significant portions inside the Downtown Orlando Community Redevelopment Area (CRA):
*Callahan (portion east of Westmoreland Drive)
*Central Business District
*Holden/Parramore (portion east of Westmoreland Drive)
*Lake Dot (portion east of Westmoreland Drive)
*Lake Eola Heights (portion west of Summerlin Avenue)
*South Eola
*North Quarter
*City District 
The CRA also includes small pieces of College Park (portions east of Peachtree Road, and along Orange Avenue between Magnolia and Highland Avenues), Lake Cherokee (portions west of Delaney Avenue and north of Ponce de Leon Place / Palmer Street), Lorna Doone (Camping World Stadium only), Park Lake/Highland (portion north of Lake Highland), South Division (portion north of Gore Street, mostly highway right-of-way), South Orange (portion north of Gore Street), and Thornton Park (portion north of Central Boulevard and west of James Avenue).

=== North Quarter ===
Located north of Colonial Drive, the border of this area is Interstate 4 to the west, and Highland Avenue to the east, the north border is N Orange Ave &amp; the I-4 on-ramps at Lake Ivanhoe. This is a vibrant area that has seen many apartments and condominiums built, bringing a diverse collection of businesses including dining and shopping to the area. As one of the cheaper neighborhoods in the downtown area, with many artists including members of the Orlando Ballet and Orlando Opera making their home here. Diverse Word, the oldest open mic night in Orlando, is held at Downtown Credo North Quarter on Tuesday nights. With such close proximity to the Central Business District for working professionals, this has become a valuable area for those who seek the convenience of work/play/live in downtown Orlando.

=== Parramore ===

Established in the 1880s, Parramore is the historical hub of Orlando&#x27;s African-American community. The area is located just west of the Central Business district along Division Ave and West Church Street. Now considered an economically depressed area, Orlando leaders are working with business owners in the community to improve the area&#x27;s reputation. While some parts of the neighborhood have been gentrified, Parramore still maintains its historical African-American identity.

It is a residential area with a large number of high-intensity entertainment and office institutions; such as the Kia Center, Bob Carr Performing Arts Centre, US Courthouse for the Mid-District of Florida, Florida A&amp;M University School of Law, county &amp; state buildings, and Orlando Police Department headquarters. Smaller businesses include grocery stores, barber shops, and soul food restaurants.

Orlando officially considers Parramore to be three separate neighborhoods: Lake Dot (between Colonial Drive and Amelia Street), Callahan (between Amelia Street and Central Boulevard), and Holden/Parramore (between Central Boulevard and Gore Street). All three are bounded on the east by Interstate 4 and on the west by Orange Blossom Trail.

=== Central Business District ===
The central business district is Orlando&#x27;s Financial District and is the most recognized feature of downtown. The majority of Orlando&#x27;s night clubs are also in this area. Located here are corporate offices for banks Wells Fargo, Seacoast, FifthThird Bank, and Suntrust banks, tech companies, restaurants, Orlando City Hall, foreign consulates, and many hotels. SunTrust Center and City Commons are two large office complexes within
the CBD. Church Street Station is also located in this area. Many of Orlando&#x27;s historic buildings are located within the CBD standing next to modern skyscrapers. The Rogers Building (built in 1886), originally an English Gentlemen&#x27;s Club built in the Queen Anne style, is the oldest building in downtown Orlando and now is home the Downtown Art&#x27;s District.

The Downtown Arts District provides funding support, manages and operates CityArts—a multi-use arts and cultural destination where visual and performing arts co-exist inside the Roger&#x27;s Building. Visited by more than 100,000 people annually, CityArts showcases an infusion of local and international works of art, and is home to six independently operated art galleries as well as art collective, Red Tape.

In addition to the plethora of bars and corporate offices, the district hosts several prominent theaters including the Mad Cow Theater and Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, home to Steimetz Hall, one of the world&#x27;s most acoustically perfect halls, designed to achieve an N1 sound rating.

Orlando City Council on March 20, 2023, approved an ordinance to establish a permit for alcohol service after midnight in a district called the downtown entertainment area (DEA). The ordinance included a requirement to hire extra-duty police officers to patrol the central business district&#x27;s entertainment area, depending on the size of a venue, on Fridays-Sundays from 10:30 p.m. to 3:30 a.m. The ordinance took effect May 1, 2023. On September 13, 2024, three downtown businesses filed a federal lawsuit against the city of Orlando and Orlando Police Chief Eric Smith, challenging the city’s after midnight alcohol sales land-use permit ordinance. The businesses alleged that the ordinance is an unconstitutional financial burden, claiming the mandated extra-duty police officers costs them an annual $591,120 combined while other permit holders were not required to pay.

Many major events take place in the Central Business District throughout the year. Creative City Project hosts the annual Immerse Arts Festival, an annual performing and interactive arts event. The festival takes place across 10 city blocks in Downtown Orlando every October. In November, the area outside of City Hall hosts FusionFest. The festival is sponsored by the Downtown Arts District and support from Orange County Government, the Orlando Downtown Development Board, the Dr. Phillips Center, and a growing grassroots movement.

===Lake Eola===
Lake Eola Park is located in South Eola, east of the CBD. The park is bordered by the Lake Eola Heights neighborhood north of the lake, South Eola Heights to the South and Thornton Park on the East side of the lake. The park is historically significant and is a frequent venue for events and festivals. The park&#x27;s most iconic landmark is the Linton E. Allen Memorial Fountain (locally known as the Lake Eola Fountain), permanently embedded to the bottom with concrete beams in the center of the lake. The fountain is illuminated nightly in various colors with two nightly water shows. In addition to the fountain, the park features swan boat rentals and the &quot;Walt Disney Amphitheater&quot;. Every Independence Day, the park is host to a large fireworks display which draws thousands of people to downtown. A recreational pathway circles the park and leads to a playground.

Lake Eola Heights is unique in Orlando as it contains some of the oldest homes in the city and is one of Orlando&#x27;s historic districts. There are many historical &quot;Florida style&quot; bungalows and century-old oak lined brick streets.

=== Thornton Park ===

Thornton Park is located one city block east of Lake Eola Park. The streets creating its border are: Summerlin Ave, E Robinson St, N Brown Ave, E Central Blvd to S Hyer Ave, and S Hyer Ave south to Florida State Road 408. The area is similar to the Lake Eola Heights neighborhood in that it contains historic homes and the streets are paved with bricks, although it is roughly half the size. Thornton Park also enjoys a handful of small restaurants, bars and boutiques along E Washington St. The neighborhood also has a small fountain located in the center of the intersection of E Washington St &amp; N Hyer Ave which has become a focal point, and is described here: The Fountain is a replica of a fountain found in a Paris city center that is 25 times its size. In 1999 the &quot;Taste of Thornton Park Event&quot; was organized specifically to raise enough money to purchase the Thornton Park Fountain for around $17,000 + $23,000 for fountain foundation. Howard Middle School, which was the original Orlando High School, is located here.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
Prior to the arrival of European settlers in 1837, the Orlando area was occupied by the Native American Creek and Seminole tribes. In 1838, Fort Gatlin was built a few miles south of downtown Orlando on the shores of modern-day Lake Gatlin; (a historic marker is now located on the fort site). In 1850, a man named Aaron Jernigan built a post office north of the fort and the area became known as &quot;Jernigan&quot;. In 1856, Jernigan was relieved of his command of the post office due to &quot;notorious acts&quot; and the area was renamed &quot;Orlando&quot;. The village remained little more than a backwater during and after the Civil War until 1875 when The &quot;Town of Orlando&quot; was incorporated. It was centered around the original Orange County Courthouse in between today&#x27;s Court Avenue and Magnolia Avenue (originally named &quot;Main Street&quot;).

A fire in 1884 almost destroyed the entire town. Before the fire, most of the structures in Orlando were built with wood and the town was without fire protection. The town began to rebuild and a fire brigade was formed. Orlando became a city in 1885 and the arrival of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1890 brought tremendous growth. Commercial activity shifted away from the courthouse and moved to the new railroad depot located on Church Street. Settlers from England arrived in Orlando and established homes and businesses. One of the newly arrived Englishmen was named Joseph Bumby. He and his family settled in the town and built a hardware store known as &quot;Bumby Hardware Store&quot;. The store remained an Orlando fixture until the 1960s, but the name &quot;Bumby&quot; is still famous in the city. The location of the hardware store is now a Hamburger Mary&#x27;s.

=== Downtown&#x27;s heyday ===
By the 1920s, Orlando had grown from a cattle town to a major citrus growing center. The Florida land boom of the 1920s brought many newcomers to the city. The population increase led to the construction of the Orlando Public Library in 1923, the Orlando Municipal Auditorium (now Bob Carr Performing Arts Centre) in 1926, and several grand hotels; namely the Angebilt Hotel and San Juan Hotel. By this time, the city&#x27;s population had grown to 9,000 people.

=== Great Depression to post-war years ===
The federal government&#x27;s Works Progress Administration programs during the Great Depression helped Orlando remain economically stable. New parks were developed, the Municipal Airport (now Orlando Executive Airport) was built, and the city also built a new football stadium at Tinker Field (now the site of Florida Citrus Bowl). By 1944, enough jobs were created to increase the city&#x27;s population to 45,000 people. Orlando became a major military center when World War II brought the development of McCoy Air Force Base and Pinecastle AFB, located southeast of downtown. This status intensified with the 1968 opening of the Orlando Naval Training Center east of downtown.

=== Decline and redevelopment ===
Walt Disney World&#x27;s 1971 opening in southwest Orange County brought major development to Orlando, but relatively little to the downtown area. During this time, development in downtown was mainly focused upon the construction of office towers, such as the Citrus Center and the original Sunbank building. However, downtown began to fall into a state of decline. The Angebilt Hotel and San Juan Hotel were abandoned and left to crumble. The San Juan was eventually demolished in 1980, but the Angebilt Hotel at 37 N Orange Ave which was built in 1923 would be transformed in modern times into an office building with retail on the ground floor. Lake Eola Park became a haven for prostitutes and drug addicts. In addition, downtown department stores and family owned businesses closed or moved to the newly constructed Orlando Fashion Square mall. After the opening of Interstate 4, the downtown population base moved out of downtown to the suburbs.
Efforts to revitalize downtown began in the mid-1970s and continued into the 1980s. Bob Snow opened &quot;Rosie O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s&quot; in 1974 at Church Street Station, which quickly became a popular attraction. In the mid-1980s, several skyscrapers were constructed; including SunTrust Center and Barnett Plaza (now Bank of America Center). Lake Eola Park was redesigned and the Walt Disney Amphitheater opened in the park around the same time the annual &quot;Orlando Shakespeare Festival&quot; was established. On the other hand, downtown&#x27;s population base still had yet to rebound to previous levels and major corporations were still opening locations outside of the city center.

The Orlando City Hall building, the city&#x27;s third, opened in 1991 directly behind the previous City Hall, constructed in 1958. To clear the area for future development, the Orlando City Council chose to implode the 1950s building. The event was met with much local fanfare and was filmed for use in the opening scenes of the 1992 film Lethal Weapon 3. The area cleared is now occupied by CNL City Center Commons.

=== Recent years ===
Until the late 1990s, downtown was relatively small compared to other cities of Orlando&#x27;s size. A building boom began in 1998 and continued through the 2000s decade. New commercial towers sprouted along Orange Avenue and residential towers were constructed around Lake Eola and along Magnolia Ave. CNL Financial Group established a major footprint in downtown with the construction of CNL City Center Commons, a complex of office towers surrounding Orlando City Hall. CNL continues to expand their presence downtown. As a result of the construction boom, downtown density doubled and Orlando&#x27;s skyline dramatically changed. In 2005, the term &quot;Manhattanization&quot; was locally applied to Orange Avenue when a large number of construction cranes loomed over downtown. The late 2000s recession slowed large intensity skyscraper construction; but infill development continued downtown including construction of the Amway Center in 2009.

In 2011, construction began on phase one of the long-awaited Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts across from City Hall along Orange Ave.

== High-rise buildings ==
The majority of the tallest towers in Central Florida are located downtown. Of the 79 existing high-rises in the Greater Orlando region, 46 are located downtown.

The tallest high-rises in Orlando are:
* Suntrust Center, 1988, is the tallest building in Central Florida.
* The Vue at Lake Eola, 2008, 
* The Orange County Courthouse, 1997, 
* The Bank of America Center, 1988, 
* 55 West on the Esplanade, 2009, 
* Solaire at the Plaza, 2006, 
* One Eleven Building, 2009, 
* SunTrust Center at Church Street Station, Under Construction, 326 ft (100 m)
*Citi Tower, 2017, 
* Modera Central, 2018, 260 ft (80m)
*Citrus Center, 1971, 
* Premier Trade Plaza Orlando, 2006, 
* CNL Center City Commons, 1999, 

Towers built in downtown Orlando have not exceeded since the completion of the Suntrust Center in 1988. There has never been an &quot;official&quot; reason why, but local architects speculate it is due to the Orlando Executive Airport location just east of downtown. The airport&#x27;s flight path is over the city center, thus the Federal Aviation Administration has imposed height restrictions.

== Transportation ==
Downtown Orlando is served by three main arteries, two limited access highways, several secondaries, and many byways.

Public transportation

Bus

The Central Florida Regional Transportation Authority (CFRTA), better known as Lynx, operates the regional bus service with its central station and offices located at 455 N Garland Avenue.

Lynx Operates a zero-fare bus route called Lymmo (Link 31) along a completely separate and dedicated right-of-way. Because this bus system runs on its own right-of-way and controls the traffic signaling, in most cases it is superior to automobile travel within the downtown area. Lymmo service also runs along the Orange Avenue corridor, north to Florida Hospital and south to Michigan Avenue. There is also an east/west connection from the Citrus Bowl to South Eola.

Rail

Downtown is served by an Amtrak station about a mile south of the central business district. The &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; and &quot;Silver Star&quot; lines provide train service to New York City, Miami and Tampa.

Construction began in 2012 on SunRail, a north–south commuter rail that will run mostly along existing CSX/Amtrak rails. Launched in 2014, it provides service between the northern suburb of DeLand to the southern suburb of Poinciana. A large transfer station, the LYNX Central Station, currently handles Lynx bus transfers and was constructed to accommodate the large capacity expected from SunRail. Further development is underway to extend the service to multiple additional points south. Connections to the Orlando International Airport (MCO) and to other lines connecting to South Florida (All Aboard Florida) are being evaluated.

Air

The Orlando Executive Airport is located east of the CBD. While technically not in downtown proper, the airport serves the downtown district.

== Redevelopment ==
The Triple Crown for Downtown, a construction initiative involving three high intensity public works projects, began in 2010 and is almost complete.

* Kia Center (formerly Amway Center) - The first initiative of the Triple Crown. Construction began in 2008 and was completed in October, 2010. It is the new home of the Orlando Magic. In addition to other events, the venue has brought major concerts back to Orlando (the former &quot;Amway Arena&quot; was deemed too small for major concerts by promoters).
* Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts - Located across from City Hall on Orange Ave, it replaced the Bob Carr Performing Arts Centre and is being built in phases. Phase I is already complete with a 2,800 seat amplified hall and a 300-seat theater for smaller productions. Phase II, currently under construction, will include a 1,700 seat acoustic hall for ballet, orchestra, and opera performances.
* Camping World Stadium - Located to the west of downtown and formerly named &quot;The Florida Citrus Bowl&quot;, is an outdoor venue for sports and large events. The stadium was 80% rebuilt with construction completing in 2017.

A more ambitious project currently under construction is completely transforming the Orlando Centroplex, the home of the former Amway Arena, into a &quot;Creative Village&quot;. The project is privately funded with satellite schools for the University of Central Florida and the University of Florida, of office space, residential apartment buildings, and a large central park with sporting facilities and an amphitheater.

<text>Spritzgebäck (), also called a spritz cookie in the United States, is a type biscuit or cookie of German and Alsatian-Mosellan origin made of a rich shortcrust pastry. When made correctly, the cookies are crisp, fragile, somewhat dry, and buttery. 

The German root verb &quot;&quot; () is cognate with the English &quot;to spurt&quot;. As the name implies, these cookies are made by squeezing, or &quot;spritzing&quot;, the dough through a 
cookie press fitted with patterned holes (or extruded through a cake decorator or pastry forcing bag to which a variety of nozzles may be fitted).

<text>WSPA-TV (channel 7) is a television station licensed to Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States, serving Upstate South Carolina and Western North Carolina as an affiliate of CBS. It is owned by Nexstar Media Group alongside Asheville, North Carolina–licensed CW station WYCW (channel 62). WSPA-TV and WYCW share studios on International Drive (next to the I-26 and I-85 Business/Veterans Parkway interchange) in Spartanburg; both stations broadcast from an antenna on Hogback Mountain in northeastern Greenville County (southwest of Tryon, North Carolina).

WSPA-TV began broadcasting in April 1956 amid a controversy that spanned a decade over the station&#x27;s proposed transmitter site. Owned by the locally based Spartan Radiocasting Company (renamed Spartan Communications in 1995) for more than four decades, it was a CBS affiliate from its inception and the second VHF television station in Upstate South Carolina. Its original studios in downtown Spartanburg were destroyed by fire in 1960; the station rebuilt at another site downtown but constructed its present facilities in 1979. Spartan Communications was acquired by Media General in 2000; under Media General, the station enjoyed strong local news ratings performances, moving from its traditional second-place to first against traditional news ratings leader WYFF. Nexstar acquired Media General in 2017; the station has since slipped back to second place in news ratings.

==Early years==
===Permitting===
When the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ended its multi-year freeze on television stations in April 1952, it allotted very high frequency (VHF) channel 7 to Spartanburg instead of the state capital of Columbia. Two radio station owners in Spartanburg made plans to apply for the channel: the Broadcasting Company of the South, owner of WSPA (950 AM), and the Spartan Radiocasting Company, owner of WORD (910 AM). Spartan&#x27;s owner, Walter J. Brown, had been instrumental in getting channel 7 assigned to Spartanburg and not Columbia; when a proposed table of allotments threatened to leave Spartanburg without any VHF channels, he pressed South Carolina&#x27;s governor, fellow Spartanburg resident James F. Byrnes, to use his influence with the FCC to move channel 7 from Columbia to Spartanburg. Spartan Radiocasting attempted to have Broadcasting Company of the South disqualified once it received the construction permit for WIS-TV on channel 10 at Columbia due to alleged overlap, which the FCC dismissed.

The dispute between the two station owners ended in an unusual settlement. On November 26, 1953, Broadcasting Company of the South announced an agreement with Spartan Radiocasting under which, if Spartan were granted channel 7, it would acquire WSPA and its FM sister station from Broadcasting Company of the South and sell off the stations it already owned. The commission agreed to the transaction, which saw Spartan owner Walter J. Brown sell off one station he founded (WORD) to acquire another (WSPA). A deal to sell off WORD was agreed in January 1954. Originally designated WORD-TV, the call sign on the channel 7 construction permit was changed to WSPA-TV in March 1954.

===The Paris Mountain dispute===

Channel 7 was originally designated to operate from a site on Hogback Mountain, northwest of Spartanburg and northeast of Greenville. But in January 1954, the FCC permitted a temporary operation from the former WFBC-FM transmitter site on Paris Mountain, from Greenville, until Hogback was ready, so that Spartan could bring television to Spartanburg sooner. This application was vociferously opposed by two operating television stations and a third permittee, all in the ultra high frequency (UHF) band: WGVL (channel 23) of Greenville, WAIM-TV (channel 40) of Anderson, and the unbuilt WSCV (channel 17) of Spartanburg. They feared that, were the station to go on the air, it would be in effect a Greenville station, and they claimed that the Paris Mountain move would be permanent and would cause them economic injury by encouraging CBS to affiliate with the new VHF station. The WSCV permittee had noted that CBS was unwilling to grant WSPA-TV an affiliation if it broadcast from Hogback to protect the service area of WBTV in Charlotte, North Carolina. Days later, CBS signed an affiliation agreement with WSPA-TV. The UHF stations continued to fight against the channel 7 permit. Wilton E. Hall, the owner of WAIM-TV, alleged that in the short time between the granting of the Paris Mountain permit and February 8, his station had lost nearly $60,000 in network revenue and advertising contracts. A senator joined the UHF stations in their plea: Edwin C. Johnson of Colorado, who decried the damage done to not only the operating WAIM-TV and WGVL but the unbuilt WSCV.

After the FCC denied their pleas, the UHF stations took their fight to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. While WSPA-TV, in response to the court ruling against it, initially gave up the temporary authority to build on Paris Mountain with the stated aim of instituting a regular and not an interim service, it then asked to modify its primary construction permit for the same site. The FCC by majority vote approved this modification on April 30, 1954, finding that it met the technical standards for separation and signal strength in Spartanburg. The two operating UHF stations, WGVL and WAIM-TV, each protested the grant. The FCC initially rebuffed their requests for a review, but the appeals court in March 1955 ordered the commission to hold a hearing, noting that both stations were CBS affiliates in danger of losing their network affiliation. The stations made their economic injury claims in three days of hearings in April, with WGVL and WAIM-TV each opening their books to describe their mounting losses and near-zero network revenues. Hall also made an unsuccessful plea that channel 7 be moved out of Spartanburg entirely to Knoxville, Tennessee, or another city, forcing WSPA-TV to a UHF channel.

In an initial decision released in September 1955, FCC chief hearing examiner James D. Cunningham proposed to affirm the Paris Mountain grant. Cunningham found that it mattered little from where the station broadcast because the effect of its transmissions would be the same from either site in Greenville and Anderson. WGVL and WAIM-TV appealed this ruling to the full FCC, but the FCC issued a final decision favoring WSPA-TV on March 9, 1956, and Brown announced that the station—its studios complete with closed-circuit telecasting underway since late 1955—would go on the air the next month. In its ruling, the FCC found that even after getting authority for Paris Mountain, Brown tried to &quot;sell&quot; CBS on the Hogback site like a &quot;vacuum sweeper salesman&quot; and rejected the claims of economic injury.

When the Court of Appeals gave final approval for WSPA-TV to begin from Paris Mountain on April 29, 1956, WGVL and WAIM-TV announced that they would leave the air. WSPA-TV was the sixth VHF television station in South Carolina with coverage of parts of three states. WGVL left the air that day, while WAIM-TV only briefly left the air before returning.

Even though WSPA-TV was on the air, the Paris Mountain case was not over, as the appeals court had yet to consider the merits of the UHF stations&#x27; protest. In a unanimous ruling from judge David L. Bazelon, on September 6, 1956, the court found that the FCC had erred in letting the station make the move. It cited engineering data that showed the Paris Mountain site served hundreds of thousands fewer people and called Spartan&#x27;s &quot;misrepresentation&quot; as to whether it would permanently operate from there &quot;calculated&quot;. It also agreed with a previously rejected claim that the stronger signal in Greenville made WSPA-TV, in effect, a Greenville station. The order was revised to allow WSPA-TV to remain on the air while the case was adjudicated, which the UHF stations further fought. Though the FCC upheld the stay and called the misrepresentation not willful in a July 1957 decision, the appeals court ordered another hearing of the Paris Mountain matter in May 1958 because it felt the commission had failed to justify the reduction of service. In written testimony, Walter Brown revealed that CBS would not pull its affiliation from channel 7 if it had to move to Hogback Mountain, a reversal of what had appeared to be the situation in the past.

In January 1961, the FCC found Spartan Radiocasting qualified to be a broadcast licensee but ordered the Paris Mountain grant to be set aside. The transmitter site matter then became entangled with a separate issue against Spartan Radiocasting. That July, the FCC ordered the record reopened to consider a 1956 &quot;ex parte&quot; off-the-record contact made by Brown to FCC commissioner Rosel Hyde and any influence Brown might have had on a letter written by South Carolina senator Strom Thurmond to former FCC chairman George McConnaughey. The cases were finally decided by the FCC in November 1962; Brown was cleared of the &quot;ex parte&quot; charges, but WSPA-TV had to move off Paris Mountain. As a result, construction began in earnest on Hogback Mountain. On October 14, 1963, the video transmitter was moved to Hogback; for a week, the video and audio on WSPA-TV were broadcast from separate sites until the audio transmitter was moved.

With the move to Hogback, WSPA-TV began planning the installation of translators to serve areas screened from the mountaintop site by terrain. By October 1964, six such translators were in service in Georgia and North Carolina.

==Spartan ownership (1956–2000)==
After beginning operations, WSPA-TV initially operated for seven hours a day, later 12, from its studios on Main Street. In addition to CBS programs, it presented local shows including &quot;The Jane Dalton Show&quot;, &quot;Carolina Showtime&quot;, &quot;Cousin Bud&#x27;s Settin&#x27; Room&quot;, &quot;Dancetown&quot;, and &quot;Tim the Squirrel&quot;. On the morning of May 16, 1960, a fire started in the air conditioning system and swept through the building shared by the WSPA radio and television stations, gutting it in what was deemed one of the worst fires in Spartanburg history to date. Operations continued unimpeded; Charlotte&#x27;s WBTV and Greenville&#x27;s WFBC-TV (now WYFF-TV) loaned equipment, and all television broadcasting shifted to Paris Mountain. In order to replace the lost studios, Spartan Radiocasting leased a former Colonial Stores grocery store on Converse Street and refitted it as a television studio within less than two months. This facility was expanded and remodeled in 1966, enabling WSPA-TV to be the first in the market to begin live local color broadcasting that September.

WSPA-TV left downtown Spartanburg in April 1979, when it relocated to a new, building near the interchange of Interstate 85 and Interstate 26 that had been under construction since 1977.

Walter J. Brown, who had been the president of Spartan Radiocasting since 1947, became its chairman in 1988. The company was renamed Spartan Communications in September 1995, shortly before Brown&#x27;s death that November.

During the late 1990s, Spartan Communications and WSPA-TV embarked on a series of relevant regional expansions. The first was the 1995 launch of WNEG-TV (channel 32) in Toccoa, Georgia, which returned over-the-air CBS access to northeast Georgia after an affiliation switch in Atlanta the year prior. In 1997, Spartan Communications teamed with Pappas Telecasting to relaunch WASV-TV (channel 62) as a dual affiliate of The WB and UPN, operating the new station under a local marketing agreement.

==Media General and Nexstar ownership==
On December 8, 1999, Spartan Communications agreed to be purchased by Media General for $605 million. The transaction bolstered Media General&#x27;s portfolio of Southeastern TV stations while marking the end of a local, family-owned broadcaster.

On March 1, 2009, WSPA&#x27;s digital tower on Hogback Mountain—built in 2000 for the launch of digital service that June—collapsed in a wind storm, taking down the tower used for analog broadcasting—dating to the 1970s—as it fell. WSPA&#x27;s digital signal was restored as a subchannel of WYCW, and a replacement antenna was mounted on the remnant lower portion of the digital tower to broadcast a temporary analog and digital service until a replacement tower was constructed.

On September 8, 2015, Media General announced that it would acquire the Meredith Corporation, then-owner of regional Fox affiliate WHNS (channel 21), for $2.4 billion to form Meredith Media General. With WSPA and WHNS among the four highest-rated stations in the market, one of WSPA or WHNS would have had to be divested had the deal gone through. That sale was canceled on January 27, 2016, in favor of a sale of Media General to the Nexstar Broadcasting Group that was completed in January 2017.

==News operation==
As in other multi-city markets, news viewership in the Greenville–Spartanburg–Asheville market has tended to be fragmented by city. Consequently, WSPA-TV&#x27;s news viewership has traditionally been strongest in and around Spartanburg, and its newscasts emphasize coverage of Upstate South Carolina. Though WYFF has traditionally been the leader in total news viewership in the market, WSPA has been its most common competitor, particularly for Upstate viewership, sometimes outpacing channel 4. In 2007, WSPA for the first time swept WYFF in evening news, and it had the most revenue of any local station in 2011 and 2014. By 2022, WYFF led the market again in all news ratings time slots, with WLOS and WSPA nearly tied in late news viewership.

WSPA-TV has operated several facilities in Greenville, the most recent a bureau and studio on Main Street that opened in 2017. The lifestyle show &quot;Your Carolina&quot; is presented from the Greenville studio.

From 1996 to 1999, WSPA-TV produced a 10 p.m. newscast for WHNS, which utilized WSPA&#x27;s local reporting resources with a separate anchor lineup and was dropped when WHNS started an in-house news department. Since 2002, when a 10 p.m. newscast launched under the title &quot;The News on 62&quot;, WASV-TV/WYCW has aired newscasts from WSPA-TV. In 2022, the 10 p.m. newscast was extended to a full hour, joining the station&#x27;s two-hour morning news extension from 7 to 9 a.m.

<text>Organic architecture is a philosophy of architecture which promotes harmony between human habitation and the natural world. This is achieved through design approaches that aim to be sympathetic and well-integrated with a site, so buildings, furnishings, and surroundings become part of a unified, interrelated composition.

==History==

=== Frank Lloyd Wright ===
The term &quot;organic architecture&quot; was coined by Frank Lloyd Wright (1867–1959); it was a continuation of the principles of his master, Louis Sullivan, whose slogan &quot;form follows function&quot; became contemporary architecture&#x27;s watchwords. Wright altered the statement to &quot;form and function are one,&quot; citing nature as the clearest illustration of such integration. A consistent thread runs across his whole body of work, which the architect refers to as &#x27;Organic Architecture&#x27;. In this situation, some people view the term &#x27;organic&#x27; as a synonym for &#x27;natural,&#x27; connecting Organic Architecture with the use of curved and free forms, replicating natural shapes, or using environmentally friendly materials. This is to misinterpret the term. While natural materials are frequently used in Organic Architecture to strengthen the link between the interior and the outside world, this is a result rather than a philosophy. In actuality, Organic Architecture is not a stylistic or aesthetic movement, but rather a specific technique or, more accurately, a philosophy.

Wright created the ultimate masterpiece of organic architecture, Fallingwater, which best demonstrates his organic architecture philosophy: the harmonious union of art and nature. Fallingwater is the residence Wright designed for the Kaufmann family in rural Pennsylvania. Wright had many choices to locate a home on this large site but chose to place the home directly over the waterfall and creek creating a close, clamorous dialog with the rushing water and the steep site. The horizontal striations of stone masonry with daring cantilevers of colored beige concrete blend with native rock outcroppings and the wooded environment.

==== Japanese Architecture ====
The primary components of organic architecture, which result in the inner harmony of an architectural building, are paradigmatic for Japanese architecture. Throughout history, those values have been defined and positioned at the forefront of total harmony, which has become the essence of Japanese culture. Using Japanese architecture as an example, Wright was able to verify the validity and solidity of his organic architecture ideas. Wright believed that traditional Japanese architecture embodied many of his theory&#x27;s &#x27;organic&#x27; qualities. When Wright created his designs in Japan, he attracted pupils and admirers, and his influence on the development of Japanese architecture is still felt today.

=== Rudolf Steiner ===
Rudolf Steiner, an esoteric philosopher, social reformer and architect, is also a significant player in organic architecture history. He is best known today for the Steiner concept of education or Waldorf schools, as well as being the father of the biodynamic approach to agriculture, but he also created a number of structures in the early 1900s and introduced his ideas about transformation into architecture. The original Goetheanum he constructed was an early example of organic architecture; but, due to fire, it was redesigned and replaced by the second, concrete and organically formed Goetheanum building, a cultural and spiritual center for the artists.

Other modernist architects in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere held complementarily and often competing views of how architecture could best emulate nature. Key figures in the U.S. included Louis Sullivan, Claude Bragdon, Eugene Tsui and Paul Laffoley while among European modernists Hugo Häring, Arthur Dyson, Hans Scharoun, and Rudolf Steiner stand out. Following World War II, organic architecture often reflected cybernetic and informatics models of life, as is reflected in the later work of futurist architect Buckminster Fuller.

In his book The Breaking Wave: New Organic Architecture, Architect and planner- David Pearson created the Gaia Charter, a set of rules for organic architecture. Pearson draws inspiration from various movements, including Celtic design, Art Nouveau, Arts and Crafts, and Antoni Gaudí&#x27;s work.

&quot;Let the design:

* be inspired by nature and be sustainable, healthy, conserving, and diverse.
* unfold, like an organism, from the seed within.
* exist in the &quot;continuous present&quot; and &quot;begin again and again&quot;.
* follow the flows and be flexible and adaptable.
* satisfy social, physical, and spiritual needs.
* &quot;grow out of the site&quot; and be unique.
* celebrate the spirit of youth, play, and surprise.
* express the rhythm of music and the power of dance.&quot;

There are contemporary creations of organic architecture. The definition of &#x27;organic&#x27; has dramatically changed during recent times. Avoiding materials of construction that require more embodied energy to build and sustain it, when the building blends naturally and sits seamlessly to its surroundings, reflecting cultural continuity, it is &#x27;organic&#x27; and is idealistic. Examples include leaving natural material, such as bedrock, exposed and unsculptured, such as the underground Rådhuset metro station in Stockholm, which appears to occupy a natural cave system.

== Principles of Organic Architecture ==
Building and Site- The site is earth but raw; it has its own form and structure (flat or contour); trees and other plantations are part of the landform. The nature of the land influences the form of the building to some extent or completely. Buildings, like plants, emerge naturally from the landscape.

Material- The material or skin of a building that attractively displays its texture, color, and strength. Organic architecture uses minimal materials.

Shelter- The structure should give a sense of shelter and safety, and it should never be left unprotected or without privacy.

Space- Space is the core of structure; it may be seen when walls, floors, and roofs are packed together, but it is invisible when it is free. He states: &quot;The reality of the building does not consist of the roof and the walls but the space within to be lived in&quot; . An Area can only be completely appreciated when viewed from one point to another as you move from one space to another.

Proportion and Scale- Nature has its own proportions and scales, and changing them would result in ludicrous or illogical shapes. According to Wright, &quot;Integral harmony of proportion to the human figure to have all details so designed as to make the human relationship to architecture not only convenient but charming&quot; .

Nature- Nature is an instructor for everyone, including architects, artists, engineers, and doctors. Nature taught us how to build and occupy space. Organic design requires that buildings mirror nature, be a part of nature, and not look out of place.

Repose- Creating an appropriate setting for human life. Uncluttered areas and the use of non-natural materials that have a harmful influence on the environment are not accepted in organic architecture.

== Examples of organic architecture ==

* Taliesin West (1937): This Arizona home was Wright&#x27;s winter residence.  The walls are covered in desert rocks, and the colors throughout the house—greys, tawny yellows, and reds—reflect the colors of the surrounding natural world. The property also has a pavilion with a translucent roof that welcomes sunshine and highlights the open Arizona sky.
* Rabbi Dr. I. Goldstein Synagogue (1957): Designed by Heinz Rau and David Resnick, this synagogue is located on the campus of Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Israel. It&#x27;s exposed concrete dome-like construction is just high and holds 150 people. The building was awarded the 1964 Rechter Prize.
* Rådhuset metro station (1975): Designed by Sigvard Olsson, Rådhuset station in central Stockholm has uncovered and unsculpted bedrock, highlighting the cave-like elements of this metro stop.
* Tampere Central Library (1986): The main municipal library in Tampere, Finland, was built by architects Reima and Raili Pietilä. This example of organic building makes use of the Finnish rock Rapakivi granite and includes animal shapes and glacial patterns.
* Cloud Art Museum (2020): This museum takes its cues from the meandering river and undulating hills on its site. Curving and transparent glass walls support a cloud-shaped roof that seemingly floats above the picturesque setting of the Qingshen Wetland Park. While flowing architectural lines allow the buildings to better integrate with their environment, clouds are also an auspicious symbol in traditional Chinese culture 
* The Mushroom - a wood house in the forest (2020): Located in a misty pine forest, the architects used a commission for a modest hotel to experiment with novel natural-architecture interactions. The end result was two simple volumes in the shape of a mushroom stem and cap.
* The House of Three Trees (2018)
* Breakwater (2019)

<doc id="1283701" wikidata="Q14330328" url="?curid=1283701" title="John Poulson">
<text>John Garlick Llewellyn Poulson (14 April 1910 – 31 January 1993) was a British architectural designer and businessman who caused a major political scandal when his use of bribery was disclosed in 1972. The highest-ranking figure to be forced out due to the scandal was Conservative Home Secretary Reginald Maudling. Poulson served a prison sentence, but continued to protest his innocence, claiming that he was &quot;a man more sinned against than sinning&quot;.

==Family and early life==
Poulson came from a strict Methodist family and inherited a strong faith which stressed the importance of self-help. He did badly at school and at Leeds College of Art but nevertheless was articled to a Pontefract firm of architects, Garside and Pennington. He left to found his own architecture practice with financial backing from his father. He never registered with the ARCUK (Architects&#x27; Registration Council of the United Kingdom), later claiming &quot;I was too busy to complete my examinations&quot;. Poulson soon began to cultivate contacts in the local borough council and officials at the larger West Riding County Council. Work soon began to arrive and Poulson told friends that he was &quot;on his way&quot;. Poulson also became politically involved with the National Liberals, although he never let political differences stop him from making &quot;friends&quot; who were in charge of commissioning public buildings. He was a Freemason.

==Post-war business==

Poulson obtained a medical exemption from wartime service in 1939. The same year he married Cynthia Sykes, whose sister Lorna was married to John King, who many years later was ennobled as John King, Baron King of Wartnaby. He was thus well placed to expand his business throughout the wartime years. He was a workaholic and demanded the same commitment from his staff, dismissing staff who would not work his way. He had his own firm build him a house called &quot;Manasseh&quot; at a cost of £60,000, helped by building contractors donating services for free in the hope of getting contracts in the future. The house won the Ideal Homes &quot;House of the Year&quot; competition in 1958.

Poulson revolutionised the accepted architectural method of completing a design then handing it over for costing, planning and building. He developed a combined architecture and design practice, an all-in-one service which employed all the separate disciplines in integrated teams. This approach accelerated the development process and reduced costs. In the post-war years, Poulson&#x27;s business boomed and by the 1960s was one of the largest in Europe. He later admitted that the practice expanded &quot;beyond my wildest dreams&quot; and offices were opened in London, Middlesbrough, Newcastle upon Tyne, Edinburgh, Beirut, and Lagos, Nigeria.

==Local authorities==

In 1958, the National Liberal MP Sir Herbert Butcher advised his friend Poulson to set up a servicing company to win business for his architect&#x27;s practice. Poulson established Ropergate Services Ltd., named after the street in Pontefract where he was based. This company also had the advantage of reducing Poulson&#x27;s tax liability considerably. In the late 1950s, there was a building boom as many local authorities embarked on major building schemes.

In Newcastle upon Tyne, council leader T. Dan Smith&#x27;s ambition to redevelop Newcastle attracted the attention of the construction firm Bovis which had worked for Poulson. Bovis&#x27; managing director suggested formalising links and in February 1962 Smith was appointed as a consultant to the Poulson organisation. This connection was extremely valuable to Poulson as Smith had a network of contacts among other authorities in the north-east, many of whom were also recruited as Poulson consultants. Smith&#x27;s involvement with the Labour Party reassured many Labour councillors wary of dealing with someone involved in the Conservative-allied National Liberals. Poulson also won other public sector work in the North East, such as Sunderland Police Station.

Poulson also found a useful contact in Andrew Cunningham, a senior figure in both the General and Municipal Workers Union and the Labour Party in North East England. Some of Poulson&#x27;s largest residential blocks were built in Cunningham&#x27;s home town of Felling, County Durham. Cunningham was later imprisoned for his dealings with the architect. Poulson&#x27;s work in Felling consisted of the building of one 16-storey high-rise apartment block with six seven-storey blocks of maisonettes surrounding it. These were approved in 1966. Four of the low-rise maisonette blocks were demolished in 1987 owing to their poor state of repair and tenants dislike of them. Two maisonette blocks and the high-rise block Crowhall Tower remain.

In his home town of Pontefract, Poulson won much local authority work for the then Pontefract Municipal Borough Council, such as the town&#x27;s library and the Horsefair flats, a high-rise social housing project consisting of four six-storey blocks and one twelve-storey block, constructed between 1963 and 1964, which has proved controversial owing to its proximity to Pontefract Castle.

==Nationalised industries==
Poulson was in a good position to gain commissions from the nationalised industries, partly due to his having offered gifts to many civil servants when they were relatively junior and calling upon them for a return of gratitude years later. As an example, Poulson had met Graham Tunbridge, a railway employee, during the war. After the nationalisation of British Rail, Tunbridge became estates surveyor for its Eastern Region and sent Poulson several contracts for modernisation of stationmasters&#x27; homes. When Tunbridge became Estates and Rating Surveyor for BR Southern Region, Poulson moved on to contracts at Waterloo railway station, Cannon Street station and East Croydon station. In return, Poulson had given Tunbridge £8,547 in cash and in kind.

Another beneficial contact was Scottish Office civil servant George Pottinger, who in the late 1950s was put in charge of a £3 million redevelopment of Aviemore as a winter sports complex. Poulson was appointed by Pottinger as architect in charge of the Aviemore project. In return, Poulson gave Pottinger gifts worth over £30,000 over six years.

Poulson&#x27;s connections with the National Liberals began to give him political advancement in the early 1960s. He was Vice-Chairman of the Executive Committee of the National Liberal Council from 1961 and frequently hosted National Liberal events in London at which he met senior government ministers. He also made contact with the Labour MP Albert Roberts. Roberts was later accused of having &quot;acted inconsistently with the standards of the House of Commons&quot;.

==Overseas work==
Poulson was increasingly interested in obtaining commissions outside Britain in the mid-1960s. This required making more contacts. The Conservative MP John Cordle had extensive contacts in West Africa and after helping on several small contracts, in 1965 became a consultant to Poulson. Cordle admitted that he had received £5,628 from Poulson&#x27;s business.

==Maudling==
Another contact was the then Shadow Commonwealth Secretary Reginald Maudling, whom Poulson knew from his National Liberal activities. Maudling was anxious to build up a business career to keep up his income and Poulson needed a big name as chairman of one of his companies, Construction Promotion. In 1966 Maudling accepted an offer to be chairman. In return, Maudling helped to bring pressure on the government of Malta to award a £1.5 million contract for the new Victoria Hospital on Gozo to Poulson.

==Financial trouble==
Poulson&#x27;s business model was initially highly successful and, at its apogee, had an annual turnover of £1 million; he himself admitted to being a millionaire. However, it was consuming more contract work than was becoming available, and Poulson resorted to tackling these difficulties by bribing and corrupting local councillors, local authority officials and civil servants at all levels. This was an expensive strategy and Poulson later estimated that he &quot;gave away&quot; about £500,000 in the last few years of his involvement in the business. As part of his attempts to gain attention, Poulson had become a local Commissioner of Taxes.

On 31 December 1969, Poulson was formally removed from control of J.G.L. Poulson and Associates. On 9 November 1971, he filed his own bankruptcy petition, revealing debts of £247,000. The bankruptcy hearings in spring 1972 were assisted by Poulson&#x27;s meticulous record-keeping which detailed his payments and gifts. Poulson&#x27;s generosity drew the comment from Muir Hunter QC during the bankruptcy proceedings that &quot;[i]n fact, Mr Poulson, you were distributing largesse like Henry VIII&quot;. The bankruptcy hearing also revealed Poulson&#x27;s love for a lavish lifestyle and his penchant for rubbing shoulders with senior figures in the establishment. This desire to show his financial superiority over others only served to highlight his true character as a lonely, friendless and insecure person. One of Poulson&#x27;s biggest creditors was the Inland Revenue to which he owed around £200,000. Whilst the Revenue were pressing Poulson for payment of this amount, he was himself presiding over debt hearings in Wakefield in his role as a Commissioner of Inland Revenue.

It swiftly became apparent that Poulson was at the centre of a massive corruption scandal, and in July 1972, the Metropolitan Police began an investigation for fraud. This precipitated the resignation of Reginald Maudling, then Home Secretary, who was notionally in charge of the police.

==Dénouement==
On 22 June 1973, Poulson was arrested and charged with corruption in connection with the award of building contracts. The trial at Leeds Crown Court lasted 52 days, and cost an estimated £1.25 million. Defending Poulson, Donald Herrod QC , said: &quot;He has nothing to live for and his abiding fear is that he will never complete his sentence because of ill health&quot;. Donald Herrod later described his client as &quot;hypocritical, self-righteous and perhaps something of a megalomaniac&quot;.

Following the trial which was widely reported in the press, he was convicted on 11 February 1974 of fraud and jailed for five years (later increased to seven years). Sentencing him, the judge called Poulson an &quot;incalculably evil man&quot;. For his part, Poulson denied the charges, saying &quot;I have been a fool, surrounded by a pack of leeches. I took on the world on its own terms, and no one can deny I once had it in my fist&quot;.

Many of his contacts, in particular T. Dan Smith and George Pottinger, were similarly convicted and gaoled, though not the three MPs: it was found that there was a legal loophole through which members of parliament could not be considered as in charge of public funds. The Poulson scandals did much to force the House of Commons to initiate a Register of Members&#x27; Interests. A subsequent Select Committee inquiry which reported in 1977 found that all three had indulged in &quot;conduct inconsistent with the standards which the House is entitled to expect from its Members&quot;.

After serving periods in Armley Gaol, Wakefield and Oakham prisons, Poulson was released on 13 May 1977 from Lincoln Prison after Lord Longford had appealed on his behalf. Longford had successfully argued that to keep a sick man in gaol was an &quot;indefensible cruelty&quot;. His bankruptcy was discharged, with creditors receiving 10p in the pound, in 1980. A condition of the discharge was that half the proceeds of his autobiography would go to his creditors; the resulting book, &quot;The Price&quot;, gives his side of the corruption scandal and maintains his innocence. Only a few copies of the book remain in circulation as it was withdrawn and pulped by the publishers through fear of libel actions.

Poulson died in the General Infirmary in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, on 31 January 1993. His wife and two daughters survived him.

==Contributions==
Among buildings designed by Poulson are the City House (1962) and International Pool (1965–1968), both in Leeds, and Forster House in Bradford, which was demolished in 2005 as part of the Forster Square redevelopment. The International Pool in Leeds was closed in 2007 and razed to the ground in 2009. The site is now used for car parking.

In an indirect way, Poulson did make a contribution to the UK&#x27;s broadcasting culture. A special edition of the investigative ITV series &quot;World in Action&quot;, &quot;The Friends and Influence of John L Poulson&quot;, became a cause célèbre in the debate about the power of Britain&#x27;s television regulators to interfere with broadcast journalism. The Poulson programme was banned by the then regulator, the ITA, even though its members had not seen it. A furious debate followed in which newspapers united in calling for an end to such &quot;censorship&quot;.

Granada Television, the makers of &quot;World in Action&quot;, broadcast a blank screen as a protest against the banning. There was some irony in this: the editor of &quot;World in Action&quot; was Raymond Fitzwalter, who earlier, as deputy news editor of the &quot;Telegraph &amp; Argus&quot; in Bradford, had led an investigation into Poulson&#x27;s activities, which the newspaper published. Eventually, after the film was shown to the ITA, it was transmitted on 30 April 1973, three months late, and under a different title, &quot;The Rise and Fall of John Poulson&quot;.

The 1996 BBC television drama serial &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot;, written by Peter Flannery, contains a character, John Edwards (played by Geoffrey Hutchings), who is closely based on Poulson. One of the reasons the production took so long to reach the screen—Flannery had originally written it for the stage in 1982—was the fear of the BBC that Poulson and others fictionalised in the drama might take legal action. In the event, the deaths of Poulson and T. Dan Smith in 1993 finally allowed the production to commence.

<doc id="1283718" wikidata="Q7952401" url="?curid=1283718" title="WLOS">
<text>WLOS (channel 13) is a television station licensed to Asheville, North Carolina, United States, broadcasting ABC and MyNetworkTV programming to Western North Carolina and Upstate South Carolina. It is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group in an effective duopoly with WMYA-TV (channel 40) in Anderson, South Carolina. WLOS maintains studios on Technology Drive (near I-26/US 74) in Asheville and a transmitter on Mount Pisgah in Haywood County, North Carolina.

WLOS-TV began broadcasting in September 1954 as the ABC affiliate for Asheville and most of the western Carolinas and the city&#x27;s second TV station. It was founded by the Skyway Broadcasting Corporation, owner of WLOS radio, and owned by Wometco Enterprises from 1958 to 1987; Sinclair has owned it since 1996. Its local news coverage has historically focused on western North Carolina, in contrast to the other major stations in the market, all of which broadcast from studios in South Carolina.

==History==
===Early years===
Prior to the 1948 freeze on television station applications imposed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Skyway Broadcasting Corporation—owner of Asheville radio stations WLOS (1380 AM) and WLOS-FM (99.9)—had applied for the use of channel 7, one of three channels assigned to the city along with channel 5 (applied for by actress Mary Pickford) and 12. However, the major overhaul of TV allocations accompanying the introduction of ultra high frequency (UHF) channels resulted in only one VHF channel being allotted to Asheville: 13, along with UHF 56 (educational) and 62. The Skyway Broadcasting Company, corporate parent of WLOS, applied for channel 13 on December 7, 1951. It was soon joined by WSKY (1230 AM) in August 1952 and WWNC (570 AM), owned by the &quot;Asheville Citizen-Times&quot; Company, in March 1953. WSKY had withdrawn by August 1953, as had the Community Television Company, but Asheville tax attorney William W. Orr then filed in October, bringing the field back up to three contenders for channel 13.

In December 1953, the field cleared, and Orr and the Citizen-Times Company withdrew their applications to allow WLOS to get the construction permit; the latter received an option to buy stock in Skyway, though it was cautioned that such would require additional FCC approval. The next step was securing a transmitter site. WLOS immediately proposed to erect a tower atop Mount Pisgah, which was met with divided sentiment. Civic groups favored the location and claimed it was the only site in the mountainous area from which the station could provide regional coverage; others derided what they felt as the commercialization of the well-known summit. A United States Forest Service hearing in February 1954 drew 50 attendees and thousands of letters, telegrams, and postcards, but the federal government approved the Pisgah tower site at the end of February 1954. Meanwhile, the station acquired the Battle House, a 1925-built residence on Macon Avenue described by &quot;The Asheville Citizen&quot; as &quot;long considered one of Asheville&#x27;s finest ... [with] a reputation as a residential showplace&quot;, to use as its studios. By July 1954, work was under way on the Mount Pisgah transmitter facility, and a September 18 start date goal had been set; WLOS-TV had signed for affiliation with ABC and the DuMont Television Network.
WLOS-TV, as projected, began broadcasting on September 18, 1954. This gave Asheville its second station, as WISE-TV had begun broadcasting on channel 62 in August 1953. Local programming was immediately planned, including shows for housewives, children, and teenagers; the WLOS radio stations also occupied the Battle House. The Mount Pisgah transmitter site gave the station a wide coverage area; pre-launch advertising boasted of having the highest antenna in the South and a signal that reached Johnson City, Tennessee.

===Wometco ownership===
A squabble over options to purchase stock in Skyway Broadcasting Company erupted in April 1957, when Harold H. Thoms—owner of WISE radio and television—and Walter Tison of Tampa, Florida, announced they had an option to buy shares in the firm and were going to exercise it. Skyway denied that any such option existed, claiming that it was based on an option extended to a minority stockholder—J. E. Edmonds—and later withdrawn. The matter was taken to court, where Edmonds attacked the validity of the 1953 Citizen-Times option, which remained outstanding. Then, that option catapulted into the spotlight when Miami businessman Mitchell Wolfson—a summer resident of Asheville—announced that he had acquired the Citizen-Times option through his other broadcast property, WTVJ in Miami, and that he was offering a buyout of all other shareholders in Skyway. The so-called &quot;Britt option&quot; that Thoms and Tison claimed to hold became the subject of multiple court cases as Thoms and Tison sued Britt and others for breach of contract.

On March 1, 1958, Wolfson&#x27;s company, Wometco Enterprises, announced it had reached a deal to buy Britt&#x27;s stock in Skyway Broadcasting and thus assume majority ownership of the WLOS stations. The FCC approved the transaction in August, and upon closure, several WTVJ employees moved to Asheville to help manage WLOS radio and television.

In 1959, Bill Norwood, known on air as &quot;Mr. Bill&quot;, began hosting a children&#x27;s program under a range of titles (the last being &quot;Mr. Bill&#x27;s Friends&quot;) which continued to air until June 1988, later returning as a fill-in weatherman in the late 1990s. Bill&#x27;s sidekick was a clown named Bumbo, played by longtime WLOS weatherman Bob Caldwell.

Wometco sold off WLOS AM to the Greater Asheville Broadcasting Corporation in 1969, retaining the FM and TV stations; the AM station changed its call sign to WKKE when the sale took effect. WLOS continued to share ABC programming in the western Carolinas with WAIM-TV (channel 40) in Anderson, South Carolina, on the opposite end of the market. It was a dual ABC/CBS affiliate; while WAIM-TV&#x27;s ABC affiliation agreement allowed it to carry any network program not aired by WLOS in Asheville, which was not receivable in the Anderson area. This ended in January 1979; after an ownership change at channel 40, ABC only allowed the station to continue airing its programming through the end of 1978.

===Ownership changes===
In 1984, Wometco was taken private in a leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR). As part of this transaction, WLOS-FM was sold to WISE and became WRLX-FM and later WKSF. KKR struggled with the station, in part because ABC sank to third in the national ratings. It set revenue goals that were so unreachable that the entire WLOS-TV sales force turned over.

AnchorMedia, associated with the Robert M. Bass Group, acquired WLOS-TV for $50 million in 1987 after two attempts had been made in the preceding year to purchase the station from KKR. Anchor was a rapidly growing group in radio, having acquired stations in Dallas, Las Vegas, and Albuquerque, but WLOS-TV marked its first television station property. Anchor had also bid on WTVJ in Miami only to be beaten at the last minute by a bid from General Electric and NBC.

During AnchorMedia&#x27;s ownership, the company attempted to acquire WAXA, the former WAIM-TV, in Anderson; the company proposed to simulcast WLOS on channel 40 for the benefit of viewers in the southern portion of the market who could not receive the Asheville station. The FCC denied an outright sale, citing the stations&#x27; overlapping coverage areas, but AnchorMedia continued to negotiate a simulcast agreement with WAXA&#x27;s existing ownership. It also won a victory in federal appeals court, which ordered the FCC to reconsider its denial of the WAXA purchase. WLOS produced a limited amount of South Carolina-specific programming for air on channel 40, including a public affairs program, &quot;Viewpoint 40&quot;, and a 6 p.m. newscast using the resources of the &quot;Anderson Independent-Mail&quot; newspaper.

In 1994, Continental Broadcasting—the former AnchorMedia—was purchased by River City Broadcasting, a St. Louis-based owner of television and radio properties. The three ABC affiliates owned by Anchor represented River City&#x27;s first major network affiliates. River City spun WAXA out as a separately programmed independent station, WFBC-TV, in September 1995. WFBC-TV later became The WB affiliate WBSC-TV in 1999 and MyNetworkTV affiliate WMYA-TV in 2006.

===Sinclair ownership===
River City merged with Sinclair Broadcast Group in 1996. WFBC-TV was sold to a related company to Sinclair, Glencairn, Ltd. Glencairn subsequently changed its name to Cunningham Broadcasting Corporation, but its stock is still almost entirely owned by the Smith family that owns Sinclair, and the companies continue to be closely related.

WLOS sold the Battle House studios to the adjoining Grove Park Inn in 1999 and began scouting for a new location. The station then secured space in the Biltmore Park commercial development south of downtown Asheville, with the first broadcasts from the new studio taking place in December 2000. Battle House was demolished in 2006; the inn argued that it was too deteriorated to be preserved and that a half-century of use as a TV studio had resulted in too many alterations. Among these were replacement of windows and doors and the removal of many finishes, as well as an addition to the structure made by the television station.

By 2014, WLOS ranked second in estimated revenue, ahead of NBC affiliate WYFF in Greenville but behind WSPA-TV; this was an improvement from 2011, when it trailed both of the Upstate stations in revenue.

On September 20, 2021, &quot;My 40&quot; and the MyNetworkTV programming on WMYA-TV moved exclusively to the 13.2 subchannel of WLOS.

==Programming==
===News operation===
As the major station based in Asheville, WLOS has traditionally focused its regional news coverage on western North Carolina, where it achieves higher ratings than its competitors. It was also initially the smallest of the three TV newsrooms in the region. After airing its main early evening newscasts at 5:30 and later 7 p.m., WLOS went head-to-head with the South Carolina stations (then-WFBC-TV and WSPA-TV) in 1979 and began airing its evening news at 6 p.m.

Even though the station&#x27;s focus is western North Carolina, management recognized the station needed a presence in the South Carolina part of the market if it was to lift itself from an overall third-place finish in the combined market. By the late 1970s, the station had a bureau in Greenville, which moved into a new building in 1984; that year, it also set up a news bureau in Spartanburg. The station expanded its news coverage with the addition of a new 5:30 p.m. newscast—in addition to its 6 p.m. report—in 1986, and a morning newscast debuted upon the end of &quot;Mr. Bill and Friends&quot; in 1988. AnchorMedia also invested in new equipment upon taking over. News programming slowly expanded: by 2008, the station had a two-hour morning newscast, 90 minutes of early evening news, and the 11 p.m. newscast on weeknights, and WMYA aired 6:30 and 10 p.m. newscasts produced by WLOS.

In 2022, WLOS debuted a weekly sports show during the football season, &quot;Saturday Sports Night&quot;, covering regional college football.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WLOS discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 13, on June 12, 2009. It had intended to do so on February 17, even after the federal government moved the deadline back four months, but general manager Jack Connors explained that the FCC would have also required the station&#x27;s analog translators, many of them serving mountainous areas shaded from Mount Pisgah by terrain, to be switched off at that time. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 56, which was among the high-band UHF channels (52–69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to VHF channel 13.

===Translators===
WLOS operates 11 translators across the mountains of western North Carolina and upstate South Carolina. These translators serve as low-power, limited-area repeaters that bring the network&#x27;s signal to towns in deep mountain valleys where the parent signal is blocked by the surrounding terrain.

<text>Heinrich Dreser (1 October 1860 – 21 December 1924) was a German chemist responsible for the aspirin and heroin projects at Bayer AG. He was also a key figure in creating the widely used modern drug codeine. Dreser was born in Darmstadt, Grand Duchy of Hesse.

Arthur Eichengrün made the claim, yet unproven, that credit for the discovery of aspirin were stolen from him by Dreser.

<doc id="1283725" wikidata="Q2714507" url="?curid=1283725" title="Orthant">
<text>In geometry, an orthant or hyperoctant is the analogue in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space of a quadrant in the plane or an octant in three dimensions.

In general an orthant in &quot;n&quot;-dimensions can be considered the intersection of &quot;n&quot; mutually orthogonal half-spaces. By independent selections of half-space signs, there are 2&quot;n&quot; orthants in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space.

More specifically, a closed orthant in R&quot;n&quot; is a subset defined by constraining each Cartesian coordinate to be nonnegative or nonpositive. Such a subset is defined by a system of inequalities:
:ε1&quot;x&quot;1 ≥ 0      ε2&quot;x&quot;2 ≥ 0     · · ·     ε&quot;n&quot;&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; ≥ 0,
where each ε&quot;i&quot; is +1 or −1.

Similarly, an open orthant in R&quot;n&quot; is a subset defined by a system of strict inequalities
:ε1&quot;x&quot;1 &gt; 0      ε2&quot;x&quot;2 &gt; 0     · · ·     ε&quot;n&quot;&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; &gt; 0,
where each ε&quot;i&quot; is +1 or −1.

By dimension:
*In one dimension, an orthant is a ray.
*In two dimensions, an orthant is a quadrant.
*In three dimensions, an orthant is an octant.

John Conway and Neil Sloane defined the term &quot;n&quot;-orthoplex from orthant complex as a regular polytope in &quot;n&quot;-dimensions with 2&quot;n&quot; simplex facets, one per orthant.

The nonnegative orthant is the generalization of the first quadrant to &quot;n&quot;-dimensions and is important in many constrained optimization problems.

==See also==
* Cross polytope (or orthoplex) – a family of regular polytopes in &quot;n&quot;-dimensions which can be constructed with one simplex facets in each orthant space.
* Measure polytope (or hypercube) – a family of regular polytopes in &quot;n&quot;-dimensions which can be constructed with one vertex in each orthant space.
* Orthotope – generalization of a rectangle in &quot;n&quot;-dimensions, with one vertex in each orthant.

<text>The Legionellales are an order of &quot;Pseudomonadota&quot; (&quot;Proteobacteria&quot;). Like all &quot;Pseudomonadota&quot;, they are Gram-negative. They comprise two families, typified by &quot;Legionella&quot; and &quot;Coxiella&quot;, both of which include notable pathogens. For example, Q fever is caused by &quot;Coxiella burnetii&quot; and &quot;Legionella pneumophila&quot; causes Legionnaires&#x27; disease and Pontiac fever.

Members of the order &quot;Legionellales&quot; can be molecularly distinguished from other &quot;Gammaproteobacteria&quot; by the presence of four conserved signature indels (CSIs) in the proteins tRNA-guanine(34) transglycosylase, lipoprotein-releasing system transmembrane protein lolE and tRNA (guanosine(37)-N1)-methyltransferase TrmD.

<text>Cardiff Metropolitan University (), is a public university located in Cardiff, Wales. Formerly known as the University of Wales Institute, Cardiff (UWIC; , ) which was established in 1996.

The university offers degree courses in a variety of disciplines. Study is available at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, full-time and part-time, and research opportunities are offered. the university has 11,500 students from over 140 countries studying on two campuses in Cardiff, and more than 10,000 at 17 partner institutions in 15 countries around the world.

In November 2021, Cardiff Met was awarded the title of UK and Ireland University of the Year 2021 by the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot;. In September 2020, Cardiff Met was named the &quot;Times&quot; and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Welsh University of the Year. In the same year, Cardiff Met was deemed to be the most financially sustainable university in Wales by the Wales Governance Centre.

In January 2023, Cara Aitchison announced that she would retire as Vice-Chancellor and President of the university, and in November 2023, the university announced that Rachael Langford would be the next Vice-Chancellor and President, taking up the role in February 2024.

==History==
===Predecessor institutions===
In 1865 the Cardiff School of Art opened in the Old Free Library Building, St Mary Street. The School of Art moved to the Technical Buildings in Dumfries Place in 1900, then The Friary in 1949, then to a new campus in Howard Gardens in 1965.

In 1940, Cardiff College of Food Technology and Commerce opened at Crwys Road. The Cardiff College of Food Technology and Commerce moved to a new Colchester Avenue Campus in 1966, home to management, business, leisure, hospitality, tourism and food students.

In 1950 Cardiff Teacher Training College opened at Heath Park. Llandaff Technical College opened in 1954 at Western Avenue, home to health sciences, design and engineering students. In 1962 the college moved to Cyncoed, now home to the Schools of Education and Sport.

===Merging of the colleges===
In 1976, the four colleges merged to form South Glamorgan Institute of Higher Education. The name changed to Cardiff Institute of Higher Education in 1990, in preparation for Incorporation. In 1992, the Institute joined the University of Wales as an autonomous body. The first Teaching Degree Awarding Powers were granted by the Privy Council in 1993. The institute was given the power to award its own degrees in August but placed the powers in abeyance, choosing instead to strengthen their links with the University of Wales. In 1996, it was granted University College status within the University of Wales and named the University of Wales Institute, Cardiff (UWIC).

In 2003, UWIC became a constituent institution of the University of Wales, and considered merging with the University of Glamorgan. 2004 saw the launch of the FE2HE-UWIC Consortium: a partnership between further and higher education institutions established with Barry, Bridgend, Coleg Glan Hafren and Ystrad Mynach further education colleges, with St David&#x27;s College joining in 2009. Tony Chapman became Senior Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive of the University of Wales.

In 2005 the university entered into and then ended merger talks with the University of Wales, Newport. A vote of no confidence was passed by the staff in the Vice Chancellor Tony Chapman. London School of Commerce became an Associate College in 2006.
In October 2010, the new building for the Cardiff School of Management opened in Llandaff with the closure of the Colchester Avenue campus. In June 2011, the new Learning Centre on the Llandaff campus was officially opened. Merger talks with Swansea Metropolitan and Trinity St David universities were discussed.

===Split from University of Wales===
UWIC formally ended its association with the University of Wales, and was renamed Cardiff Metropolitan University in November 2011. The university now awards all of its degrees in its own name. Despite this &#x27;withdrawal&#x27; from the University of Wales, the new Cardiff Metropolitan University retains close formal links with it. Until summer 2012 they shared the same Pro Vice Chancellor of Research. Cardiff Metropolitan University briefly continued to supply its staff for the University of Wales to use as moderators for their overseas franchised degrees.

From 2004 to 2007, Cardiff Metropolitan University&#x27;s Vice Chancellor, Tony Chapman, was the Senior Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive of the University of Wales, whilst also holding the post of Vice Chancellor at UWIC.

===Pressure to merge with other HE institutions===

In December 2003, UWIC withdrew from merger talks with the University of Glamorgan, stating that it was not in the &#x27;best interests of UWIC and the students&#x27;. In December 2004, UWIC announced merger talks with University of Wales, Newport, but withdrew from merger talks in July 2005 when the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales stated they indicated that any proposed merger must also include the University of Glamorgan.

On 4 July 2011, UWIC pulled out of merger talks with both Swansea Metropolitan University and the University of Wales Trinity Saint David, for a new University of Wales citing the fact that it was &#x27;dissatisfied with a lack of attention to good governance, due process and administration (in the University of Wales)&#x27;. This was despite the fact that its own Pro-Vice Chancellor for Research, Professor Robert Brown, was also one of the most senior figures in the University of Wales, serving as a member of the University of Wales Council. In December 2011 the newly established Cardiff Metropolitan University rejected the plans of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales for the future structure of Wales&#x27; universities which proposed merging it with the universities of Glamorgan and Newport to form the UK&#x27;s largest higher education institution.

Pressure on Cardiff Met to merge continued to mount throughout 2011 and 2012, however, in line with Leighton Andrews&#x27; controversial Higher Education agenda. This included a plan to create a new super-university of 45,000 students in the Welsh Valleys, involving the University of Glamorgan, the University of Wales, Newport, and Cardiff Metropolitan. Newport had already agreed to merger plans put forward by Glamorgan, although it was described as a &#x27;bilateral arrangement&#x27; with neither institution technically taking precedence. This merger plan left open the possibility of a third university becoming involved, which was recognised as a reference to Cardiff Met&#x27;s position.

Cardiff Metropolitan continued to oppose a merger with its neighbours, citing the lack of a business case, concerns that the new institution (which would be the largest campus university in Britain) would simply be too big to manage properly. In response to their efforts, Leighton Andrews (a strong supporter of the mergers on any terms) threatened to forcibly dissolve Cardiff Metropolitan and hand its assets over to the university formed by Glamorgan and Newport&#x27;s merger. , more time had been granted to consider a three-way merger, but Cardiff Metropolitan still demanded more evidence before committing to further talks. Cardiff Metropolitan has described the existing plans as high cost and high risk, and have threatened to refer the matter to spending watchdogs, including the Auditor General. However, Cardiff Metropolitan stressed that it retained an &#x27;open mind&#x27; on the subject of a merger, and has ruled out moving to the private sector.

On 6 November 2012, the threat of dissolution was removed when the Education Minister made a statement to the Senedd that he had taken the decision to cancel the previous consultation on the proposed dissolutions because of a request from the chairs of the University of Glamorgan and the University of Wales, Newport.

==Campuses==
Cardiff Met has two campus – one at Llandaff and the other Cyncoed.

===Llandaff===
Llandaff is the home of the Cardiff School of Sport &amp; Health Sciences (Llandaff), Cardiff School of Management, Cardiff School of Technologies and the Cardiff School of Art &amp; Design.
The campus is located approximately two miles from the city centre, surrounded by numerous parks, playing fields and the historic village of Llandaff.
This campus is also located near Cardiff Met&#x27;s Plas Gwyn residential campus.

===Cyncoed===
Cyncoed is home to the Cardiff School of Education &amp; Social Policy and the Cardiff School of Sport &amp; Health Sciences (Cyncoed).
It offers on-site accommodation and a new purpose-built Campus Centre. The campus offers sporting facilities, on-site shop, coffee bars and refectory. The campus also acts as the head office for the Students&#x27; and Athletics Union.

The Student I-Zone opened in October 2010, to provide information to students from one location.

==Organisation==
Cardiff Metropolitan University is made up of five academic schools:
* Cardiff School of Art &amp; Design
* School of Education &amp; Social Policy
* Cardiff School of Management
* Cardiff School of Sport and Health Sciences
* Cardiff School of Technologies

<doc id="1283733" wikidata="Q7401312" url="?curid=1283733" title="Saint Georges, Delaware">
<text>Saint Georges is an unincorporated town and former municipality situated on the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal in New Castle County, Delaware, United States, approximately midway between the Delaware River and Chesapeake Bay.

==History==
St. Georges was settled before 1730 at the head of the St. Georges Creek. A tavern was built in 1735 and King&#x27;s Highway was constructed through the settlement in 1762. St. Georges was incorporated as a town in 1825. After being divided by the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal and then bypassed by a newer bridge, the town asked to have their charter revoked by the state in 1940. The community has at least one civic association, the North Saint Georges Civic Association which represents the community to the New Castle County Council.

The Senator William V. Roth Jr. Bridge (Delaware Route 1) passes just west of the community. It is the only cable-stayed bridge in the Delaware Valley and one of the first in the nation. It opened in 1995 as a replacement to the still standing St. Georges Bridge, which carries U.S. Route 13 over the community of St. Georges and the canal. The St. Georges Bridge is in turn a replacement for a former lift bridge that sat in the middle of town. That bridge—built in 1923—was knocked down on January 10, 1939, by the 6,000-ton freighter &quot;Waukegan&quot;. The freighter lost control, hit the north tower of the bridge, and caused it to collapse. Two people died: the bridge tender and the bridge electrician. One other bridge spanned the C &amp; D Canal before the lift bridge. It was a small pedestrian swing bridge that crossed over the former Saint Georges Locks. It was destroyed when the locks were dismantled during the first widening and deepening (to sea level) of the canal.

Bloomfield, the W. Casperson House, Linden Hill, Ethel S. Roy House, St. Georges Cemetery Caretaker&#x27;s House, St. Georges Presbyterian Church, Starl House, Sutton House (St. Georges, Delaware), and the North Saint Georges Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The community is located in New Castle County District 12 and is represented to the county council by Councilman James W. (Bill) Bell.

==Demographics==
==Education==
Saint Georges is in the Colonial School District. It operates William Penn High School.

<text>A gran maestro was the unofficial head of state in the Italian city-states. The role could depend on holding a particular office, military power or a general subversion of the constitution.

The Scaliger family in Verona converted their control of the office of &quot;podestà&quot; into a permanent lordship as early as 1226. The Sforza dynasty rose from condottieri to be dukes of Milan in 1447. The Medici relied on financial power and control of the selection process for office to establish their own dominance in Florence, although it took them until 1532 to acquire the formal title of Duke of Florence and abolish all vestiges of the republic.

<text>Storer College was a historically Black college in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, that operated from 1867 to 1955. A national icon for Black Americans, in the town where the &#x27;end of American slavery began&#x27;, as Frederick Douglass famously put it, it was a unique institution whose focus changed several times. There is no one category of college into which it fits neatly. Sometimes white students studied alongside Black students, which at the time was prohibited by law at state-regulated schools in West Virginia and the other Southern states.

In the early twentieth century, Storer was at the center of the growing protest movement against Jim Crow treatment that would lead to the NAACP and the Civil Rights Movement. The first American meeting of the predecessor of the NAACP, the Niagara Movement, was held at Storer in 1906.

John Brown&#x27;s Fort, a symbol of the end of slavery in the United States, was located from 1909 until 1968 on the Storer campus, where it was once used as the college museum (the &quot;fort&quot; has since been moved back to the lower town). Although the college closed in 1955, much of the Storer campus is now preserved as part of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park.

==Location==
&quot;The locality is eminently healthful, and one of the most beautiful that can be imagined.&quot;

According to an article in the &quot;Journal of Negro Education&quot;:

==History==
===Founding===
Storer began in 1865 as a one-room elementary school, sponsored by New England Free Baptists and the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau. Its first class was 19 formerly enslaved children, described as &quot;poorly clad, ill-kept, and undisciplined&quot;, who desperately needed the basic skills of reading, writing, and arithmetic.

At a conference in 2015 honoring the 150th anniversary of Storer College, John Cuthbert, head of the West Virginia &amp; Regional History Center, observed:

Once slavery was ended in the United States and the education of blacks was no longer prohibited, there was a &quot;wild rush for the schools&quot;.

A $10,000 matching grant from John Storer, a philanthropist from Maine, led to the charter of &quot;a school which might eventually become a College, to be in located in one of the Southern States, at which youth could be educated without distinction of race or color&quot;. Though called a college from the beginning, it was a normal school until into the twentieth century, providing high school-level instruction to future primary school teachers. It also is not &quot;historically black&quot; in the usual sense. The student body was overwhelmingly black, and in the 1910 advertisement reproduced at right it describes itself as &quot;for Colored students&quot;, but there were some white students. It was also ahead of its time in that it accepted both male and female students, which then was unusual.

The Free Baptists called Storer their greatest success. The U.S. Congress turned over to it four buildings that had been used for housing at the former Harpers Ferry National Armory. The school gradually expanded its offerings, adding a traditional or &quot;collegiate&quot; high school, an industrial division, then junior college classes, and finally four-year programs. The College built additional buildings. Until 1891, when the state West Virginia Colored Institute opened, it was the only college in West Virginia that accepted non-white students.

===The choice of Harpers Ferry===
In 1865, as a representative of New England&#x27;s Freewill Baptist Home Mission Society, charged with coordinating their instructional efforts in the Shenandoah Valley and surrounding areas, Reverend Nathan Cook Brackett chose centrally-located Harpers Ferry as his base. The Federal Arsenal at Harpers Ferry, on low ground adjoining the rail line and the Potomac, was destroyed during the Civil War and was never rebuilt, and the lower town was in poor condition. However, a sturdy and almost vacant building on higher ground was available; it was known as Lockwood House for a Union general who had stayed there briefly. Brackett installed his family.

Under him were four different schools, in different communities. One was conducted by him and his family in Lockwood House, which was to become Storer College&#x27;s first building. They taught reading, writing, and arithmetic to the children of former slaves and sometimes to their parents. Parents and children sometimes took the same class together, &quot;but the rising generation so far outstripped their ancestors that the old folks became ashamed of themselves, and gave it up.&quot;

From this beginning as a one-room school for freedmen, Storer developed slowly into a normal school, an academic (college prep) school, then a two-year college, and finally a full-fledged, degree-granting four-year college open to all. Former slaves came to Storer as they were eager to learn to read and write, to help them make their way in a new world of free labor. Some wanted to learn new skills and leave the agricultural fields where most had worked.


The founding of the school was related to a larger national effort by Northern philanthropic organizations and the government&#x27;s Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau to set up schools in order to educate the millions of enslaved African Americans freed by the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. From Harpers Ferry, Reverend Brackett directed the efforts of dedicated missionary teachers, who provided a basic education to thousands of former slaves congregated in the relatively safe haven of the Shenandoah Valley by the end of the American Civil War.

===Charter===
Dedicated as they were, these few teachers could not begin to meet the educational needs of the freedmen in the area. Across the South, education of freedmen was an urgent priority within their communities. By 1867, some 16 teachers struggled to educate 2,500 students in the Shenandoah Valley. Reverend Brackett realized that he needed to train African-American teachers.

In 1867, Reverend Brackett&#x27;s school came to the notice of John Storer, a philanthropist, who like Brackett was from Maine. At the suggestion of Oren B. Cheney, founder and president of Bates College, a Free Will Baptist school in Maine, Storer offered a $10,000 grant to the Free Will Baptists for &quot;a school which might eventually become a College, to be in located in one of the Southern States, at which youth could be educated without distinction of race or color&quot;, if the Freewill Baptists matched his $10,000 donation. His heirs later added $1,000 for a library.
The money was raised, and by March 1868 Storer received its state charter, which was approved in the Legislature by a vote of 13–6, though the phrase &quot;without distinction of race or color&quot; was fiercely debated. At the same time the institution was authorized to operate as a normal school, training teachers for the &quot;colored schools&quot;. &quot;Storer College, Normal Department&quot; opened its doors in October of that year. It was sometimes referred to informally as Storer Normal School.

According to its Trustees, in 1870:

Brackett was principal of the school until 1896. He remained Storer&#x27;s Treasurer and member of the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees until his death in 1910.

===Armory buildings and land===
According to a bill signed by President Andrew Johnson on December 15, 1868, the U.S. Government donated to the new Storer College the buildings which became the core of its campus, including the building where Brackett had been teaching his classes. These were four sturdy but vacant buildings—Lockwood House, Brackett House, Morrell House, and the original Anthony Hall—built as housing for workers and managers at the Armory. The College also received the land these buildings were on, which became its campus.

The College was dedicated on December 22, 1869.

===The &quot;College&quot; of Storer College===
When founded and for most of its existence, Storer did not offer what in the 21st century would be deemed a college education or college credits. Numerous other colleges, such as Tougaloo College, New-York Central College, West Virginia Wesleyan College, and Oberlin College, also offered instruction at a pre-college level. They were running in essence college-preparatory schools; in the 19th century, in many areas there were no schools preparing students for college. Even in the 20th century, most &quot;junior colleges for Negroes&quot; delivered primarily high-school-level instruction.

At the time, credentials as understood today (2021)—college degrees, for example—were much less important, and the line between college and pre-college instruction was often blurry. Just as today with upper undergraduate and graduate students in the U.S., pre-college and college students might be in the same classroom, taking the same course at the same time, but at a different level of instruction. Medical schools, in the nineteenth century, did not require as prerequisite a college education as understood today (2021). Neither did teaching: normal schools to train teachers for public elementary schools offered high school level instruction. &quot;I studied at X College&quot; did not necessarily mean, then, that the person had received a college education. No one saw this as a problem, as a college education was much less important, and somewhat unusual. Having studied at the &quot;prep school&quot; gave some of the intellectual benefits and prestige of studying at the college.

Storer was the first school for blacks, ex-slaves or freeborn, in the new state of West Virginia, that was more than a one-room, one-teacher, &quot;ungraded&quot; operation (and there weren&#x27;t many of those either). There was nothing similar, at least nearby, in any neighboring state. While training elementary school teachers in the normal school, there were also lots of illiterate adult students for the student teachers to instruct. Storer College spent much of its early years teaching reading, writing, and arithmetic, as almost no one else in the state was providing this instruction to blacks. Storer&#x27;s Preparatory Division was preparing students for the Normal School, which required literacy. No one saw this as a problem; it was what the West Virginia Legislature expected when they chartered Storer College, described as &quot;a high school for negroes&quot; by a hostile newspaper. No one else in West Virginia was educating those students until the foundation in 1891 of the West Virginia Colored Institute, today West Virginia State University, and in 1895 of the Bluefield Colored Institute, today Bluefield State University. (They are in 2021 the universities in West Virginia with the lowest black enrollment.) They certainly were not welcome at the segregated state normal school, Shepherd College, founded in 1871 in nearby Shepherdstown, West Virginia.

In 1938 Storer began offering a curriculum that would lead to a four-year college degree.

===Storer College, Jefferson County, and West Virginia===
In 1867, that the charter of Storer should say &quot;without distinction of race or color&quot; was &quot;fiercely debated&quot; in the Legislature, and approval of the charter was delayed until March 1868.
In 1881 the Legislature directed that the state finance the education of 17 prospective &quot;colored&quot; teachers, justifying this number as being equivalent, relative to West Virginia&#x27;s colored population at the time, to the ratio of white prospective teachers supported by the state compared to its white population.

===Finances of the college===
The school charged only minimal tuition, $3 per quarter, or $20 for five years. Rooms were only $3 per quarter, so the students&#x27; main expense was for their board, estimated at $2–$3 per week.

By 1881, the school had already passed through &quot;severe financial embarrassments&quot;.

Support of the College was the largest single endeavor of the Free Baptists, to which they were &quot;thoroughly committed&quot;.

In 1867, in addition to chartering it, the West Virginia Legislature appropriated $10,000 (). This was the first appropriation in the state for the education of Negroes above the elementary level.

From 1882 to 1892, Storer received $630 from the State of West Virginia, to provide &quot;industrial-type training for Negroes&quot;. In 1903, President McDonald referred to the state&#x27;s &quot;small biennial appropriation&quot; for the same purpose.

In 1911–1912, the American Baptist Home Mission Society, which &quot;as a result of doctrinal conflicts&quot; absorbed the Free Baptists in 1911, contributed $1,350 to salaries, and in 1912–1913 was budgeted to contribute $2,750, and for 1913–1914 and 1914–1915, $3,000 each year. In addition, Storer was to receive $1,785 from the sale of Manning Bible School (Cairo, Illinois) property, 
In 1926, the Legislature appropriated $6,000, which did not even cover half the faculty and administrative salaries. The Free Will Baptist–Home Mission Society, which quashed a fundraising drive, saying they were overextended, contributed $3,000. The Women&#x27;s Baptist Home Mission Society contributed $3,000, to be used on programs that served women. In 1925 the income from these three main sources totaled $12,096, while expenditures totalled $49,291. &quot;Boarding fees, tuition, and income from the school&#x27;s farming enterprises, property investments, and donations made up the remainder.&quot;

In 1932, the West Virginia Legislature reduced its support from $17,500 to $12,000.

===Local hostility===
Raising $10,000 turned out to be easy compared to facing local resistance by whites to a &quot;colored school.&quot; The Freewill Baptists&#x27; other mission school, resembling that in Harpers Ferry, in Beaufort, North Carolina, was abandoned after one year due to &quot;lingering Confederate sympathizers&quot;. Storer&#x27;s predecessor in Jefferson County, a school staffed by &quot;Miss Mann&quot;, a niece of the educator Horace Mann, in neighboring Bolivar, only lasted one year because of &quot;militant race prejudice&quot;. The town of Harpers Ferry had already rejected a proposal to use Lockwood House &quot;for a school for colored children&quot;. Storer&#x27;s charter aroused intense and violent opposition, and passed by one vote.

Residents of Harpers Ferry tried everything from slander and vandalism to pulling political strings in their efforts to shut down the school. They petitioned the Legislature to have Storer&#x27;s charter revoked. One teacher wrote, &quot;it is unusual for me to go to the Post Office without being hooted at, and twice I have been stoned on the streets at noonday.&quot; Threats by the Ku Klux Klan in the first years caused the faculty and students to carry arms while walking outside. In 1923 the Klan marched past the college. At one point lady teachers required a military escort.

These efforts did not succeed in closing Storer, and eventually, local attitudes changed. In 1891, &quot;the inhabitants of Harper&#x27;s Ferry hold a true interest and even a pride in the college. Some of its old opponents are now numbered among its most devoted friends. And no person in the community is held in higher honor or greater esteem than Mr. Brackett, once of all men the most hated and despised.&quot; However, in 1896 the college ceased renting rooms in the summer to black vacationers, because of local opposition. It continued accommodating white vacationers. The decision was much criticized by students and alumni.

The citizens of Harpers Ferry did not like having John Brown&#x27;s Fort in their town or the black tourists it attracted, and were happy it was moved to Chicago. They were quite unhappy at its return and then move to the Storer campus.

In 1944 Storer&#x27;s first black president, Richard Ishmael McKinney, was welcomed with a burning cross on his lawn.

===Benevolent paternalism===
Some modern scholars view Storer as a reconstructed plantation. Students were taught that they should efface themselves. The school had at one point a Modern Minstrel Company, which performed &quot;Plantation Songs and Melodies” and renditions of numbers like “If the Man in the Moon Was a Coon&quot;. President Nathan Brackett said that the school’s “humble and illiterate” students &quot;generally show a desire to work and submit to wholesome discipline.” To instill moral character, students were obliged to “march in military columns” between classes, were not permitted to “jump, dance, or scuffle” inside campus buildlngs or go on “pleasure excursions, rides, or walks in mixed company.” Other rules deterred students from socializing in town or mingling with townspeople.

Students did most campus labor, cooking meals, cleaning buildings, maintaining the campus, and caring for the animals on the school farm.

===NAACP not permitted to post plaque on Fort===
Paternalism is particularly linked with Storer&#x27;s second president, Henry T. McDonald, who tried to smooth over the growing ideological divide between the college and the town. The biggest single such incident was McDonald&#x27;s full participation in a controversial ceremony, the 1931 dedication of the Heyward Shepherd monument. The monument was the project of the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the Sons of Confederate Veterans, and was intended to support their claim that the enslaved in the South did not desire freedom, and did not support John Brown. McDonald, in his capacity as the president of Storer, made introductory remarks. Two attacks on John Brown then followed; Heyward Shepherd allegedly showed that Brown was wrong and the slaves didn&#x27;t want freedom. In a dramatic moment, the Storer musical director then praised Brown. McDonald was much criticized in the black press. One newspaper called the college a failure, and asked African Americans to ostracize the college. The &quot;Afro-American&quot; called for his resignation.

In 1932, Max Berber, a founder of the NAACP, presided over the unveiling of a tablet honoring John Brown at the college and referred to Brown as an initiator of the civil rights group. W.E.B. Du Bois had prepared a new plaque in response to the Hayward Shepherd monument, but McDonald, backed by the trustees, refused to allow the NAACP to place this plaque on a wall of the Fort.

The plaque was not erected until 2006. Rather than attaching it to the Fort at its present location, as originally planned, by request from the black community the Park Service located it on the former Storer campus, at the Fort&#x27;s former location.

===Storer graduates===
In 1895, the 20 &quot;free schools&quot; in Jefferson County were all taught by Storer graduates. Storer graduates were also found &quot;in other important schools all over the state&quot;, and from Maryland in the northeast to Texas in the southwest.

=== An icon for African Americans ===
During the 88 years it existed, Storer had a great symbolic importance to American blacks.

Storer and Harpers Ferry were in fact a black destination. Many black tourists came to Harpers Ferry; there was a hotel catering to them, the Hilltop House, built and managed by a black Storer graduate, Thomas Lovett. In the summer, Storer rented dormitory rooms to tourists and summer boarders, and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ran excursion trains from Baltimore and Washington.

=== Frederick Douglass&#x27;s speech, 1881 ===
Storer College was a site of various important events in West Virginia and national African-American history. In 1881, the noted abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who had escaped slavery as a young man in the antebellum years and become a noted orator, and who was on Storer&#x27;s Board of Trustees, delivered his famous speech on abolitionist John Brown at Storer College. His intent was to raise funds for an endowed John Brown professorship, to be held by a black man. (It never materialized.) There was a &quot;large gathering of people&quot; from Maryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia, and some from as far as New England. They attended a ceremonial laying of the cornerstone for Anthony Hall.
===National League of Colored Women visit, 1896===
In July 1896, the first national convention of the National League of Colored Women, meeting in Washington, D.C., visited Harpers Ferry, the John Brown Fort, and the college. They passed a resolution condemning &quot;the authorities of Storer College for preventng those who have contributed for thesupport of Lincoln Hall from using the latter during the present summer, as has been the custom heretofore.&quot;

===Niagara Movement conference, 1906===

The Niagara Movement, predecessor of the NAACP, is closely linked to Storer. Formed by a group of leading African-American intellectuals, the Niagara Movement planned a campaign to eliminate discrimination based on race. The movement&#x27;s leader, W. E. B. Du Bois, a sociologist with a PhD, rejected the prevalent theory of &quot;accommodation&quot;, as opposed to social equality, promoted by Booker T. Washington, President of the Tuskegee Institute.

The program for its first meeting, celebrated in Fort Erie, Ontario, for fear of disruptions in Buffalo, New York, was typed on the back of Storer letterhead.

The Movement&#x27;s second conference, the first in the U.S., was held at Storer in 1906. Attendees walked to John Brown&#x27;s Fort, which shortly thereafter was moved to the campus.

The 1907 meeting would also have been held at Storer, but the school&#x27;s white administrators would not permit it, because of pressures placed on them.

The Niagara Movement published an annual &quot;Address to the World&quot;, demanding voting rights (the mass of African Americans in the South had been essentially disenfranchised by the turn of the century), educational and economic opportunities, justice in the courts, and recognition in unions and the military. Many conservative African-American and white leaders became alienated by their approach, which eroded potential political support. During the 1906 conference, Storer staff expressed discomfort with the group&#x27;s militancy, and dismay at their tendency to consider even progressive whites as the enemy.

By 1910, five years after it was formed, the Niagara Movement was dissolved. While it did not produce material gains in the civil rights arena, its leaders had announced their intention to pursue full civil rights, thereby laying a valuable foundation for the development of a more broad-based push for equality.

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was formed in New York City in 1910 with an interracial board, and many of the members of the failing Niagara Movement quickly joined it. The NAACP had many of the same goals of the Niagara Movement; it also pursued a concentrated program of litigation campaigns in the effort to overturn of barriers to voter registration and voting, end state and local jurisdictions&#x27; segregation of housing, gain integrated public transportation and other facilities, seek integrated public education, achieve fair jury trials for blacks, and similar goals.

=== John Brown&#x27;s Fort, 1909===
John Brown&#x27;s Fort, the firehouse at the former Harpers Ferry Armory, was moved to the Storer campus in 1909, where it housed the college museum. In 1968, after closure of the college and establishment of the Harpers Ferry National Historical Park, the National Park Service moved it back to as close to its original location as possible at the time.

=== Four-year college degrees ===
In 1938, under the leadership of school president Henry T. McDonald, Storer became a four-year college. The last new building was completed in 1939-1940. Enrollment peaked at around 400, as Storer and other colleges had struggled during the privations of the Great Depression. The number of students dipped lower with the high rate of participation by young men in World War II. The college had received some financial support from the state of West Virginia, as it helped educate blacks, who were limited to segregated schools and colleges.

Although the school granted four-year degrees, it never received regional accreditation; it never applied. As a result, it was forced to turn away some students. Those who wanted to be doctors, for example, were not admitted. The college was unable to fund the laboratories and other scientific equipment necessary for a pre-med degree.

===Closure of the college===

It is commonly said that Storer closed because state funding ended after the 1954 &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; ruling found segregated public schools to be unconstitutional. There is a kernel of truth to it, but it was but the last of a long series of financial problems. In the first place, Storer College charged no tuition. Its main funding came from the Freewill Baptists. The state of West Virginia helped off and on, but refused to fully fund Storer, or turn it into a state college, because it was religiously affiliated, and because the Constitution of West Virginia prohibited the joint study of black and white students in publicly-supported schools. Storer was a New England project, or a black project, but it was not a West Virginia project. From a West Virginian point of view, Storer&#x27;s remote location was terrible. The College Trustees chose to retain the religious affiliation and to keep the school open to all. State money then went to fund the new West Virginia Colored Institute (1891) and Bluefield Colored Institute (1895), which were more centrally located and served students that might have attended Storer.

Providing four-year college educations was much more expensive than training primary school teachers. In fact it was beyond the resources of the Freewill Baptists, whose support for the college depended on such things as children&#x27;s Sunday School contributions.

Storer never achieved regional accreditation, and its new (1936) three-year pre-med degrees were not accepted at medical schools. Accreditation required a $100,000 endowment, and Storer had only $20,000. The library and gymnasium were outdated. At the same time, Storer did not have the support of the local community. The hostility from the white community, most of whom wished Brown had never heard of Harper&#x27;s Ferry, and some of whom made no secret of what they thought of a &quot;nigger college&quot;, led to some management decisions that sapped the College&#x27;s support internally. The College had to sell land to meet expenses. With no state money coming ever again, or so they expected, there was no way to survive. So it closed in 1955.

The college&#x27;s former campus and buildings were returned to federal control, specifically to the National Park Service (NPS), authorized in a 1962 appropriation, as part of what was then Harpers Ferry National Monument and is now the Harpers Ferry National Historical Park. It is currently (2021) one of NPS&#x27;s four regional training centers.

In 1954, the NAACP achieved a victory with the US Supreme Court decision in the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; case, which declared racial segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional. &quot;The West Virginia Legislature withdrew its annual appropriation from Storer because of the Supreme Court ruling outlawing segregation in public schools, and the resultant policy of integration in state schools. The Legislature [described as &quot;unsympathetic&quot;] said the appropriation was intended to finance studies by Negro students at Storer but is now unnecessary because Negroes now are eligible to enroll at other state colleges. The enrollment at Storer has been exclusively Negro.&quot; The state appropriation was $20,000. In its final year, the College had 88 students.

Storer had been accumulating debt for a decade, and could not survive without the state appropriation. In June 1955, Storer College closed its doors forever.

==Education at Storer==
Understanding that former slaves needed to learn more than the three Rs to function in society, Storer founders intended to provide more than a basic education. According to the first college catalog, students were to &quot;receive counsel and sympathy, learn what constitutes correct living, and become qualified for the performance of the great work of life.&quot; In its early years, in the press to expand literacy among the freedmen and their children, Storer taught freedmen to read, write, spell, do sums, and to go back into their communities to teach others these lessons.

Storer believed that &quot;morality&quot; went hand in hand with education; for admission, students had to &quot;give satisfactory evidence of a good moral character.&quot;

Storer remained primarily a teachers college, but added courses in higher education as well as industrial training. Students graduated with a &quot;normal degree,&quot; for teaching elementary school students, or an academic degree, for those going on to college. Buildings were constructed through the 1930s, with Permelia Eastman Cook Hall, a handsome grey stone building, completed 1939-1940.

In 1911, the West Virginia Legislature struck Storer from its list of accredited normal programs, meaning its graduates could not receive teaching certificates, because &quot;the curriculum did not adequately include enough professional training.&quot;

In 1921 Storer was granted junior collegiate status, although it did not award Associate degrees until 1937, and in 1945, senior status. The state accredited its education programs.

=== Industrial education ===
Starting in the 1880s, Storer started offering vocational and industrial courses; in 1897 the trustees made industrial education a course of study; there were 137 students that year. This formalization of manual labor at Storer corresponded with a widespread movement in the South that was predicated upon white supremacists[&#x27;] notions of black inferiority. ...Manual labor made African Americans fit for citizenship by instilling Christian values and moral character.&quot; The school eventually required all normal students to take industrial courses, so that by 1904 it was training more tradespeople than teachers.

Henry T. McDonald, also white, in 1899 became Storer&#x27;s second president. He strongly advocated manual-labor education, overseeing major aspects of the school’s transition.

==Faculty==
The Storer College Alumni Association has published on its Web site a list of all the faculty and other employees.

In 1871 the faculty was the following:
* N. C. Brackett, Principal (arithmetic, philosophy, and political economy)
* A. H. Morrell (Bible history and vocal music)
* Lura E. Brackett, Preceptress (English grammar, algebra, and botany) (sister of N. C. Brackett)
* Louise Wood Brackett (Latin and drawing) (wife of N. C. Brackett)
* Lizzie Morell (instrumental music)

Plus various substitutes, assistants, and a matron.

Hamilton Hatter, an African American from Jefferson County, first studied at Storer, then received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Bates College in 1888 (where he ran a sawmill). He then joined the faculty of Storer, establishing the Industrial Department, teaching carpentry as well as Greek, Latin, and mathematics. Hatter left in 1896 to become the first principal of Bluefield Colored Institute. He was a trustee of Storer from 1891 until 1906.

The Bracketts&#x27; daughters, Mary Brackett Robertson and Celeste Brackett Newcomer, both taught at the school.

In 1899, the President, the first to be given that title, was Henry F. McDonald. At that time there were 7 full-time and 4 part-time teachers, no courses beyond the high school level, an outdated library, inadequate science labs and equipment, and buildings in desperate need of essential repairs.

During the 1911–1912 academic year, Storer had a faculty of 19: 6 male and 13 female, 10 white and 9 &quot;Negro&quot;.
In 1917, the College, &quot;now industrial and normal in character&quot;, had about 150 students, and &quot;the faculty is entirely white.&quot;

In 1931-32, of the 11 faculty members reported, 5 had a master&#x27;s degree, and 6 a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

Richard I. McKinney became Storer&#x27;s first African-American president in 1944, with the goal of making Storer &quot;a noteworthy four-year institution&quot;. He was the College&#x27;s first employee with a Ph.D. (from Yale). The community welcomed him with a burning cross on his front lawn. Under him, Storer hired additional black faculty; some white faculty had a problem with this. Tensions became worse because McKinney worked to strengthen the College&#x27;s ties to Africa, including inviting alumnus Nnamdi Azikiwe, President of Nigeria, as commencement speaker in 1947. Financial solvency was not achieved, and there were tensions with the paternalistic white Board of Directors. McKinney tendered his resignation in 1949, but it was not accepted until the following year, when &quot;the board was...eager to rid Storer of McKinney&quot;.

==Enrollment==
Over the first forty years of the college, enrollment averaged 176. However, 
it varied dramatically with the season. For example, in 1873–74, there were 80 fall term students, 167 in the winter term, and for the summer, 124.

The first 8 graduates of the Storer Normal School graduated in 1872. In 1874, a writer observed that the demand for these &quot;colored teachers...is far beyond the capacity of the college with its present means and endowments to supply.&quot; By 1877 there were 100 former students teaching, of which 37 were graduates, and many of the remainder returned termittently to complete their education. That year a semi-annual, week-long teachers&#x27; institute was inaugurated.

The first graduates of the Academic Department were in 1880.

In 1871 there were 203 enrollees. Counting those still students, Academic Department, 42 students; Normal Department, 174 students; Preparatory Division, 101 students. As of that date there had been 285 different students enrolled. The same year, the &quot;Spirit of Jefferson&quot; newspaper reported &quot;more than 150...of all ages and sexes, and...all shades and colors.&quot; In 1875, there were 285.

In 1881, a report of the Free-Will Baptists indicates that at Storer there were 200 enrolled students, 62 graduates, level unspecified, and the total number who had enrolled at some time was 800. The report also says that the College had &quot;sent out&quot; over 200 teachers and 25 preachers. In 1882–84 there were 63 enrolled in the three-year normal school training.

In its first 20 years, the school trained hundreds of teachers from West Virginia, Ohio, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.
In 1895 there were 250 graduates of the Normal Department.

In 1901 there were 49 male and 73 female students.

In 1931 there were 130 students, 52 at the junior college level and 78 at the high school level.

Over its 90-year history, about 7,000 students enrolled. The Storer College Alumni Association has a 70-page list on its web site. As of the later 19th century students came from 14 states and 4 foreign countries.

==Curriculum==
Storer&#x27;s first program was the normal program, preparing teachers. In 1872 Storer started its first academic, four-year department, the Seminary Course [high school]; it taught classics, including Latin, Greek, and Shakespeare, along with astronomy, algebra, geometry, and botany. This program, which graduated twenty-five students, languished after 1896. An industrial department teaching woodworking, printing, and blacksmithing was added in 1886. Domestic science became required for females in 1893, and girls were required to sew their own graduation gowns. A separate department of Biblical Literature emerged in 1895.

Starting in 1899, when Storer&#x27;s second president started, for graduation students had to complete these assigned readings:
* Political philosopher Edmund Burke, who supported the American Revolution.
* Abolitionist American writer Noah Webster.
* English Romantic poet William Wordsworth.
* American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.
* American writer Washington Irving.
* English novelist and abolitionist George Eliot (pseudonym of Mary Ann Evans).
* The abolitionist American poet John Greenleaf Whittier.
* Shakespeare.

==Student life==
From the outset and as late as 1887, students &quot;of any state of advancement&quot;, who could &quot;give satisfactory evidence of good moral character&quot;, were admitted on any day of the session, and placed by examination. According to Storer&#x27;s first catalogue (1869), students were to &quot;receive counsel and sympathy, learn what constitutes correct living, and become qualified for the great work of life&quot;. Every student was required to have a Bible and to attend chapel, Sunday school, 9 AM prayer, and daily 15-minute assemblies. Students were allowed to attend intermittently, depending on personal responsibility and finances. By 1889 a minimum age of thirteen was set, in 1909 raised to fourteen.

Students at Storer were subject to many other rules. Class attendance was mandatory, as was an hour&#x27;s study before class each morning. Students were not allowed to drop or change classes. Students could not &quot;loiter&quot; on campus, and they were forbidden from leaving the campus during the week, and on weekends were to avoid dances and &quot;walks in mixed company&quot;. Women students were not allowed out after dark, could not be seen alone in the company of a man, and required an escort when going to the train station.

==Buildings==

Storer&#x27;s facilities were described as &quot;bare bones&quot;. For example, there was no hot water in the men&#x27;s dormitory in 1947.

===Original buildings===
Buildings still standing in 2022 are marked in bold.

* Four Armory buildings. With the support of Senator and future President James Garfield, who had studied in a Free Will Baptist school, in 1869 Congress turned over to the War Department, who turned over to the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, and then to Storer, four surviving buildings at Camp Hill, all built by the federal government as housing for Armory employees. They were &quot;dilapidated&quot; after Civil War damage. Additional land was purchased.
** Lockwood House, described as &quot;one of the finest residences in Harpers Ferry&quot;, was built in 1847–48 as quarters for the Armory paymaster. It became a Clayton Hospital, a military hospital, in 1862, and later became the headquarters of Union General Henry Hayes Lockwood, who lived there only three months. Subsequently it was used by Major General Philip H. Sheridan. Nathan Brackett set up his first school in 1865, he personally teaching a roomful of illiterate freedmen to read. There was a hole in the roof from a shell and windows missing, and the second floor could not be used until it was repaired. In 1867 Brackett opened the &quot;Storer Normal School in this building. By 1869 the classroom and chapel had been relocated to Anthony House, and Lockwood became primarily a dormitory. In the summer rooms were rented out, to raise money. In 1883 a third floor with a girls&#x27; dormitory was added. in 1941 it became a faculty apartment building. However, it fell into disuse and when the College closed in 1955 was in &quot;considerable disrepair&quot;.
** The original Brackett House, built in 1858, was formerly the superintendent&#x27;s clerks&#x27; quarters. In 1880, it was occupied by principal Brackett, his family of 6, 3 servants, and 13 female students. A new girls&#x27; dormitory was built. After this building was destroyed by fire, a replacement building was buil in 1909–10. It was first called New Lincoln Hall and then renamed for Brackett in 1938. This building was demolished in 1962. In 1995 a Park Service building occupies the site.
** Morell House was built in 1858, and was formerly the paymaster&#x27;s clerk&#x27;s quarters. It is named for Alexander H. Morrell, who was a Free Will Baptist preacher sent to Harpers Ferry by the church to help in the education of freemen. In 1870, Reverend Morell and his wife had 20 to 27 girls boarding with them. In 1995 it held the office of the Superintendent of Harpers Ferry National Historic Park, and other administrative offices.
** The north wing of Anthony House, later Anthony Memorial Hall, was the Armory superintendent&#x27;s quarters. President Lincoln spent the night of October 2, 1862, at Anthony House; Lincoln was visiting General George McClellan, in Maryland. In 1870 the school and mission headquarters were moved here from Lockwood House. Deacon Lewis W. Anthony donated $5,000 () for a large new addition, containing the main library, music rooms, a lecture hall, and administrative offices, for which reason the building was dedicated to him. The building had a chapel (plus an &quot;old chapel&quot;), lecture rooms, library, and quarters for the principal&#x27;s family. On May 30, 1881, the day preceding the laying of the cornerstones of the two new annexes, Frederick Douglass gave his famous John Brown address. In 1882, a visitor noted that in the chapel, behind the pulpit, a large portrait of John Brown held the &quot;place of honor&quot;, accompanied by portraits of abolitionist senator Charles Sumner, Abraham Lincoln, and &quot;General Garfield&quot;. It was rehabilitated by the NPS in 1963, and houses the Mather Training Center.

===Additional buildings===
*The Bird-Brady House served as a private residence for teachers and families associated with the school. Originally occupied by white Baptists, the house is named after Elizabeth Bird and Mabel Brady, sisters who graduated from the college and worked there as administrators in the 1940s and 50s. From the 1940s on, African-Americans began to take a stronger leadership role in running the college. The building was bought by the National Park Service in 1962, but Bird and Brady continue to live there until at least 1970. Afterwards, the building was converted for use as office space as part of the NPS&#x27;s Harpers Ferry Center.
* Lincoln Hall, the boys&#x27; dormitory, was a frame building built in 1870–71. It contained 34 double rooms on 3 stories. In the summer rooms were rented to tourists and boarders, to raise money. It burned to the ground in 1909. It was replaced in 1909–10 with New Lincoln Hall, housing 100 students, renamed Brackett Hall in 1938. It was demolished in 1962, and an NPS building is on the site.
*In 1889 the school &quot;very much need[ed] a heating system&quot;. The school had no running water, and the town of Harper&#x27;s Ferry was &quot;too poor&quot; to put in a water works system. They have therefore no protection from fire. The Industrial Building was practically completed, and they were seeking $1,000 to buy equipment for it. A physics and chemistry laboratory was set up in the DeWolf Industrial Building, and they are raising money for a carpentry building.
*The Lewis W. Anthony Industrial Building was built in 1902 and was originally used for the college&#x27;s industrial training classes, but was converted to be its library in 1929, part of the school&#x27;s movement away from being a trade school towards a more academically-oriented program typical of a four-year liberal arts college. The building is now called the Anthony Library and serves as the library for the National Park Services&#x27;s Harpers Ferry Center.
* John Brown&#x27;s Fort, &quot;an important symbol of the struggle African Americans had faced to win their freedom&quot;, was moved to the campus in 1909, the 50th anniversary of John Brown&#x27;s raid, and remained there through the College&#x27;s closure in 1955. It &quot;was a tourist destination—almost a shrine—for African Americans in the late nineteenth century.&quot; It contained the College museum, with display cases, and pictures of Brown, Lincoln, Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, and Kate Field (who got it returned to Harpers Ferry, from Chicago). In 1968 the National Park Service moved it to its present location in lower Harpers Ferry.
* Lewis W. Anthony Industrial Arts Building, built in 1903, housed the blacksmith and carpenter&#x27;s shops, and laboratories. It became the college library in 1929. The NPS uses it as a library.
* A report of 1901 said that &quot;a laboratory for physics and chemistry has been fitted up in the DeWolf Industrial Building&quot;.
* Myrtle Hall, the girls&#x27; dormitory, was completed in 1879. It had 35 rooms for 60 women and several te achers. with cooking and laundry facilities in the basement. It was named for the Freewill Baptists&#x27; youth publication, &quot;The Myrtle&quot;. Renamed Mosher Hall (Mrs. Mosher edited &quot;The Myrtle&quot;) when it became the boys&#x27; dorm in the 20th century, it was torn down by the National Park Service in 1962.
* In 1940, Permelia Eastman Cook Hall opened. It houses a new physics laboratory and the home economics department. In 1995 it was used as a dormitory for visiting NPS personnel, but it is now used for offices, including those of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail.
* The Science Building, built 1947, and the DeWolf Industrial Building were also razed by the NPS.

==Legacy==
In 1962, Congress appropriated funds for the National Park Service to acquire the surviving buildings on campus, some occupied by squatters, as part of what is now known as Harpers Ferry National Historical Park. It had been established in 1944 as a National Monument, taking in much of the declining town.

As part of this change, in 1964, the movable physical assets of the college were transferred to the historically white Alderson-Broaddus College, a Baptist college, and used to establish scholarships for black students. The college&#x27;s endowment was merged with Virginia Union University, a historically black college.

Since 1964, Virginia Union University has considered, and treats, graduates of the college as alumni of VUU. VUU&#x27;s L. Douglas Wilder Library and Learning Resource Center holds Storer College&#x27;s former library collection and some of the college&#x27;s records. Other Storer College records are held at the library of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park, West Virginia University&#x27;s West Virginia and Regional History Center, and at Howard University&#x27;s Moorland–Spingarn Research Center.

The campus of the college is now maintained as a part of the Harpers Ferry National Historical Park. Since 1963, the three remaining college structures now house the National Park Service&#x27;s Stephen T. Mather Training Center and the Service&#x27;s library. The Training Center is one of four major training centers operated by and for the National Park Service. It is named for the Service&#x27;s first Director, Stephen Mather. The college buildings were completely remodeled.

Each August, the alumni of Storer College gather in Harpers Ferry for an annual reunion. At last count fewer than 70 alumni survive.

<doc id="1283751" wikidata="Q130654" url="?curid=1283751" title="Dutch colonial empire">
<text>The Dutch colonial empire () comprised overseas territories and trading posts under some form of Dutch control from the early 17th to late 20th centuries, including those initially administered by Dutch chartered companies—primarily the Dutch East India Company (1602–1799) and Dutch West India Company (1621–1792)—and subsequently governed by the Dutch Republic (1581–1795) and modern Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815–1975). 

Following the &quot;de facto&quot; independence of the Dutch Republic from the Spanish Empire in the late 16th century, various trading companies known as &quot;voorcompagnie&quot; led maritime expeditions overseas in search of commercial opportunities. By 1600, Dutch traders and mariners had penetrated the lucrative Asian spice trade but lacked the capital or manpower to secure or expand their ventures; this prompted the States General in 1602 to consolidate several trading enterprises into the semi-state-owned Dutch East India Company (, VOC), which was granted a monopoly over the Asian trade.

In contrast to Spanish and Portuguese rivals, Dutch activities abroad were initially commercial ventures driven by merchant enterprise and characterised by control of international maritime shipping routes through strategically placed outposts, rather than from expansive territorial ventures. By the mid-17th century, the VOC—along with the Dutch West India Company (Dutch: &quot;Geoctrooieerde Westindische Compagnie,&quot; GWC), which was founded in 1621 to advance interests in the Americas—had greatly expanded Dutch economic and territorial influence worldwide, exercising quasi-governmental powers to negotiate treaties, wage war, administer territory, and establish settlements.

At its height in 1652, the Dutch empire spanned colonies or outposts in eastern North America, the Caribbean, South America (Suriname and Brazil), western and southern Africa, mainland India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Japan, and Taiwan. While searching for new trade passages between Asia and Europe, Dutch navigators explored and charted distant regions such as Australia, New Zealand, and Tasmania, and parts of eastern North America. The Dutch also secured favorable trading relations with several Asian states, such as the Mughal Empire in India, from which they received half of all textiles and 80% of silks, and exclusive access to the Japanese market.

With the VOC and GWC controlling vital sea lanes and maintaining the largest merchant fleets in the world, the Dutch dominated global trade and commerce for much of the 17th century, experiencing a golden age of economic, scientific, and cultural achievement and progress. The wealth generated from overseas colonies and trading ventures, including the slave trade, fueled patronage of the arts, building projects, and domestic enterprises; port cities such as Rotterdam and Amsterdam experienced unprecedented growth and expansion.

A series of Anglo-Dutch wars between 1652 and 1784 challenged Dutch naval supremacy and resulted in the loss of multiple settlements and colonies; the rise of the British East India Company, which conquered the vital trading hub of Mughal Bengal in 1757, likewise weakened Dutch influence and access to foreign markets. By the end of the fourth and final Anglo-Dutch war (1780–1784), the majority of Dutch colonial possessions and trade monopolies were ceded or subsumed by the British Empire and French colonial empire; the Dutch East Indies and Dutch Guiana remained the only major imperial holdings, surviving until the advent of global decolonisation following World War II. 

With the independence of Dutch Guiana as Suriname in 1975, the last vestiges of the Dutch empire—the three West Indies islands of Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten around the Caribbean Sea—remain as autonomous constituent countries represented within the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

==History==

===Origins (1590s–1602)===

In the 1560s, the Eighty Years&#x27; War broke out in the Habsburg Netherlands. A coalition of rebel provinces united in the Union of Utrecht declared independence from the Spanish Empire with the 1581 Act of Abjuration, in 1588 establishing the &quot;de facto&quot; independent northern Dutch Republic (alias the United Provinces), whose sovereignty was recognised by the Treaty of Antwerp (1609). The eight decades of war came at a massive human cost, with an estimated 600,000 to 700,000 victims, of which 350,000 to 400,000 were civilians killed by disease and what would later be considered war crimes. The war was largely fought on the European continent, but war was also conducted against Phillip II&#x27;s overseas territories, including Spanish colonies and the Portuguese metropoles, colonies, trading posts and forts belonging at that time to the King of Spain and Portugal. The port of Lisbon in Portugal had since 1517 been the main European market for products from India, drawing merchants from across Europe to purchase exotic commodities. But as a result of Portugal&#x27;s incorporation in the Iberian Union with Spain by Philip II in 1580, all Portuguese territories were thereafter Spanish Habsburg branch territory, and thus all Portuguese markets were closed to the United Provinces. Thus, in 1595, the Dutch decided to set sail on their own to acquire products for themselves, making use of the &quot;secret&quot; knowledge of the Portuguese trade routes, which Cornelis de Houtman had managed to acquire in Lisbon.

The coastal provinces of Holland and Zeeland had been important hubs of the European maritime trade network for centuries prior to Spanish rule. Their geographical location provided convenient access to the markets of France, Scotland, Germany, England and the Baltic. By the 1580s, the Eighty Years&#x27; War led many financiers and traders to emigrate from Antwerp, a major city in Brabant and then one of Europe&#x27;s most important commercial centres, to Dutch cities, particularly Amsterdam. Efficient access to capital enabled the Dutch in the 1580s to extend their trade routes beyond northern Europe to new markets in the Mediterranean and the Levant. In the 1590s, Dutch ships began to trade with Brazil and the Dutch Gold Coast of Africa, towards the Indian Ocean, and the source of the lucrative spice trade. This brought the Dutch into direct competition with Portugal, which had dominated these trade routes for several decades, and had established colonial outposts on the coasts of Brazil, Africa and the Indian Ocean to facilitate them. The rivalry with Portugal, however, was not entirely economic: from 1580, after the death of the King of Portugal, Sebastian I, and much of the Portuguese nobility in the Battle of Alcácer Quibir, the Portuguese crown had been joined to that of Spain in an &quot;Iberian Union&quot; under the heir of Emperor Charles V, Philip II of Spain. By attacking Portuguese overseas possessions, the Dutch forced Spain to divert financial and military resources away from its attempt to quell Dutch independence. Thus began the several decade-long Dutch–Portuguese War.

In the 1590s, the &quot;voorcompagnieën&quot; (&quot;pioneer companies&quot;) emerged, which were given &quot;express instructions to focus on trade and engage in violence only in self-defense&quot;. The Dutch took inspiration from England&#x27;s many joint-stock companies and private investment, including Muscovy Company, Eastland Company, Levant Company, and East India Company.

In 1594, the &quot;Compagnie van Verre&quot; (&quot;Company of Far Lands&quot;) was founded in Amsterdam, with the aim of sending two fleets to the spice islands of Maluku. The first fleet sailed in 1596 and returned in 1597 with a cargo of pepper, which more than covered the costs of the voyage. The second voyage (1598–1599), returned its investors a 400% profit. The success of these voyages led to the founding of a number of companies competing for the trade. The competition was counterproductive to the companies&#x27; interests as it threatened to drive up the price of spices at their source in Indonesia whilst driving them down in Europe.

=== Establishment of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) (1602–1609) ===
As a result of the problems caused by inter-company rivalry, the Dutch East India Company (, VOC) was founded in 1602. The charter awarded to the company by the States-General granted it sole rights, for an initial period of 21 years, to Dutch trade and navigation east of the Cape of Good Hope and west of the Straits of Magellan. The directors of the company, the &quot;Heeren XVII&quot;, were given the legal authority to establish &quot;fortresses and strongholds&quot;, to sign treaties, to enlist both an army and a navy, and to wage defensive war. The company itself was founded as a joint stock company, similarly to its English rival that had been founded two years earlier, the English East India Company.

Shortly after the VOC was founded, the problem of justifying attacks on Spanish and Portuguese ships became more acute when in February 1603, the Portuguese carrack &quot;Santa Catarina&quot; was captured off the coast of Singapore by three VOC ships under the command of Jacob van Heemskerck. When Heemskerck returned to Amsterdam in 1604 with the enormous booty from the &quot;Santa Catarina&quot;, this caused a major controversy in the Dutch Republic about the legality, utility, and moral permissibility of this act. As a result, in September 1604 jurist Hugo Grotius wrote a treatise titled &quot;De Jure Praedae Commentarius&quot; (&quot;Commentary on the Law of Prize and Booty&quot;), later published in 1609 as &quot;Mare Liberum, sive de jure quod Batavis competit ad Indicana commercia dissertatio&quot; (&quot;The Freedom of the Seas, Or, The Right Which Belongs to the Dutch to Take Part in the East Indian Trade&quot;), in which the act of aggression was justified.

In the meantime, the States-General had already passed a resolution on 1 November 1603, authorising VOC ships &quot;to damage the enemies and inflict harm on their persons, ships and goods by all means possible, so that they may with reputation not only continue their trade, but also expand it and make it grow&quot;. This was a &quot;critical&quot; event according to several historical studies, with Borschberg (2013) stating it &quot;marked a major shift in policy of the VOC&quot; and &quot;set the cornerstone for the establishment of the Dutch colonial empire in Asia&quot;, because the resolution transformed the VOC &quot;into an instrument of war and colonial expansion that was directed against the Iberian powers in Asia and later, of course, also against local Asian rulers and polities.&quot; Pursuing their quest for alternative routes to Asia for trade, the Dutch were disrupting the Spanish-Portuguese trade, and they eventually ranged as far afield as the Philippines. The Dutch sought to dominate the commercial sea trade in Southeast Asia, going so far in pursuit of this goal as to engage in what other nations and powers considered to be little more than piratical activities.

During the negotiations for and implementation of the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce in the years 1608–1610, the Dutch sought to secure all sorts of commercially and strategically important positions in Southeast Asia, and the VOC rushed to conclude as many contracts as possible with local monarchs and polities in the so-called frontline regions: the Malay Peninsula (particularly Johor), Sumatra, the Banda Islands, the Moluccas, Timor and southern India.

=== Dutch conquest of the Banda Islands (1609–1621) ===

===Iberian–Dutch conflicts (until 1661) ===

The Dutch attacked most of Portugal&#x27;s far-flung trading network in and around Asia, including Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka), and Goa, as well as attacks upon her commercial interests in Japan, Africa (especially Mina), and South America. Even though the Portuguese had never been able to capture the entire island of Ceylon, they had been able to keep the coastal regions under their control for a considerable time before the coming of the Dutch in war. Portugal&#x27;s South American colony, Brazil, was partially conquered by the United Provinces.

In 1621, the Dutch West India Company (WIC) was set up and given a 25-year monopoly to those parts of the world not controlled by its East India counterpart: the Atlantic, the Americas and the west coast of Africa. The Dutch also established a trading post in Ayutthaya, modern day Thailand during the reign of King Naresuan, in 1604.

In the 17th century, the &quot;Grand Design&quot; of the West India Company involved attempting to corner the international trade in sugar by attacking Portuguese colonies in Brazil and Africa, seizing both the sugarcane plantations and the slave ports needed to resupply their labour. Although weakened by the Iberian Union with Spain, whose attention was focused elsewhere, the Portuguese were able to fight off the initial assault before the Battle of Matanzas Bay provided the WIC with the funds needed for a successful operation. Johan Maurits was appointed governor of &quot;New Holland&quot; and landed at Recife in January 1637. In a series of successful expeditions, he gradually extended the Dutch possessions from Sergipe on the south to Maranhão in the north. The WIC also succeeded in conquering Gorée, Elmina Castle, Saint Thomas, and Luanda on the west coast of Africa. Both regions were also used as bases for Dutch privateers plundering Portuguese and Spanish trade routes. The dissolution of the Iberian Union in 1640 and Maurits&#x27;s recall in 1643 led to increased resistance from the Portuguese colonists who still made up a majority of the Brazilian settlers. The Dutch were finally overcome during the 1650s but managed to receive 4 million reis (63 metric tons of gold) in exchange for extinguishing their claims over Brazil in the 1661 Treaty of the Hague.

=== Dutch colonisation of Asia ===
The war between Phillip II&#x27;s possessions and other countries led to a deterioration of the Portuguese Empire, as with the loss of Ormuz to England in 1622, but the Dutch Empire was the main beneficiary.

The VOC began immediately to prise away the string of coastal fortresses that, at the time, comprised the Portuguese Empire. The settlements were isolated, difficult to reinforce if attacked, and prone to being picked off one by one, but nevertheless, the Dutch only enjoyed mixed success in its attempts to do so. Amboina was captured from the Portuguese in 1605, but an attack on Malacca the following year narrowly failed in its objective to provide a more strategically located base in the East Indies with favourable monsoon winds. The Dutch found what they were looking for in Jakarta, conquered by Jan Pieterszoon Coen in 1619, later renamed Batavia after the putative Dutch ancestors the Batavians, and which would become the capital of the Dutch East Indies. Meanwhile, the Dutch continued to drive out the Portuguese from their bases in Asia. Malacca finally succumbed in 1641 (after a second attempt to capture it), Colombo in 1656, Ceylon in 1658, Nagapattinam in 1662, and Cranganore and Cochin in 1662.

Goa, the capital of the Portuguese Empire in the East, was unsuccessfully attacked by the Dutch in 1603 and 1610. Whilst the Dutch were unable in four attempts to capture Macau, from where Portugal monopolized the lucrative China-Japan trade, the Tokugawa shogunate&#x27;s increasing suspicion of the intentions of the Catholic Portuguese led to their expulsion in 1639. Under the subsequent &quot;sakoku&quot; policy, from 1639 till 1854 (215 years), the Dutch were the only European power allowed to operate in Japan, confined in 1639 to Hirado and then from 1641 at Dejima. In the mid-17th century, the Dutch also explored the western Australian coasts, naming many places.

The Dutch tried to use military force to make Ming China open up to Dutch trade but the Chinese defeated the Dutch in a war over the Penghu islands from 1623 to 1624, forcing the VOC to abandon Penghu for Taiwan. Then Chinese defeated the Dutch again at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay in 1633.

The Dutch colonised Mauritius in 1638, several decades after three ships out of the Dutch Second Fleet sent to the Spice Islands were blown off course in a storm and landed there in 1598. They named it in honour of Prince Maurice of Nassau, the Stadtholder of the Netherlands. The Dutch found the climate hostile and abandoned the island after several further decades. The Dutch established a colony at Tayouan (present-day Anping), in the south of Taiwan, an island then largely dominated by Portuguese traders and known as Formosa; and, in 1642 the Dutch took northern Formosa from the Spanish by force.

=== Dutch colonisation of the Americas ===

The Dutch colonisation of the Americas started with many mixed results. In the Atlantic, the West India Company concentrated on wresting from Portugal its grip on the sugar and slave trade, and on opportunistic attacks on the Spanish treasure fleets on their homeward bound voyage. Bahia on the north east coast of Brazil was captured in 1624 but only held for a year before it was recaptured by a joint Spanish-Portuguese expedition., In 1630, the Dutch occupied the Portuguese sugar-settlement of Pernambuco and over the next few years pushed inland, annexing the sugar plantations that surrounded it. In order to supply the plantations with the manpower they required, a successful expedition was launched from Brazil to capture the Portuguese slaving post of Elmina in 1637, and successfully captured the Portuguese settlements in Angola in 1641. In 1642, the Dutch captured the Portuguese possession of Axim in Africa. By 1650, the West India Company was firmly in control of both the sugar and slave trades, and had occupied the Caribbean islands of Sint Maarten, Curaçao, Aruba, and Bonaire in order to guarantee access to the islands&#x27; salt-pans.

Unlike in Asia, Dutch successes against the Portuguese in Brazil and Africa were short-lived. Years of settlement had left large Portuguese communities under the rule of the Dutch, who were by nature traders rather than colonisers. In 1645, the Portuguese community at Pernambuco rebelled against their Dutch masters, and by 1654, the Dutch had been ousted from Brazil. In the intervening years, a Portuguese expedition had been sent from Brazil to recapture Luanda in Angola, expelling the Dutch by 1648.

On the north-east coast of North America, the West India Company took over a settlement that had been established by the Company of New Netherland (1614–1618) at Fort Orange at Albany on the Hudson River, relocated from Fort Nassau which had been founded in 1614. The Dutch had been sending ships annually to the Hudson River to trade fur since Henry Hudson&#x27;s voyage of 1609. To protect its precarious position at Albany from the nearby English and French, the Company founded the fortified town of New Amsterdam in 1625, at the mouth of the Hudson, encouraging settlement of the surrounding areas of Long Island and New Jersey. The fur trade ultimately proved impossible for the company to monopolize due to the massive illegal private trade in furs, and the settlement of New Netherland was unprofitable. In 1655, the nearby colony of New Sweden on the Delaware River was forcibly absorbed into New Netherland after ships and soldiers were sent to capture it by the Dutch governor, Pieter Stuyvesant.

Since its inception, the Dutch East India Company had been in competition with its counterpart, the English East India Company, founded two years earlier, for the same goods and markets in the East. In 1619, the rivalry resulted in the Amboyna massacre, when several English Company men were executed by agents of the Dutch. The event remained a source of English resentment for several decades, and indeed was used as a cause célèbre as late as the Second Anglo-Dutch War in the 1660s; nevertheless, in the late 1620s the English Company shifted its focus from Indonesia to India.

In 1643, the Dutch West India Company established a settlement in the ruins of the Spanish settlement of Valdivia, in southern Chile. The purpose of the expedition was to gain a foothold on the west coast of the Americas, an area that was almost entirely under the control of Spain (the Pacific Ocean, at least most of it to the east of the Philippines, being at the time almost a &quot;Spanish lake&quot;), and to extract gold from nearby mines. Uncooperative indigenous peoples, who had forced the Spanish to leave Valdivia in 1604 contributed to get the expedition to leave after some months of occupation. This occupation triggered the return of the Spanish to Valdivia and the building of one of the largest defensive complexes of colonial America.

=== Dutch colonisation of Southern Africa ===

By the middle of the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company had overtaken Portugal as the dominant player in the spice and silk trade, and in 1652 founded a colony at the Cape of Good Hope on the southern African coast, as a victualing station for its ships on the route between Europe and Asia. Dutch immigration in the Cape rapidly swelled as prospective colonists were offered generous grants of land and tax exempt status in exchange for producing the food needed to resupply passing ships. The Cape authorities also imported a number of Europeans of other nationalities, namely Germans and French Huguenots, as well as thousands of slaves from the East Indies, to bolster the local Dutch workforce. Nevertheless, there was a degree of cultural assimilation between the various ethnic groups due to intermarriage and the universal adoption of the Dutch language, and cleavages were likelier to occur along social and racial lines.

The Dutch colony at the Cape of Good Hope expanded beyond the initial settlement and its borders were formally consolidated as the composite Dutch Cape Colony in 1778. At the time, the Dutch had subdued the indigenous Khoisan and San peoples in the Cape and seized their traditional territories. Dutch military expeditions further east were halted when they encountered the westward expansion of the Xhosa people. Hoping to avoid being drawn into a protracted dispute, the Dutch government and the Xhosa chieftains agreed to formally demarcate their respective areas of control and refrain from trespassing on each other&#x27;s borders. However, the Dutch proved unable to control their own settlers, who disregarded the agreement and crossed into Xhosa territory, sparking one of Southern Africa&#x27;s longest colonial conflicts: the Xhosa Wars.

=== Rivalry with Great Britain and France (1652–1795) ===
In 1651, the English parliament passed the first of the Navigation Acts which excluded Dutch shipping from the lucrative trade between England and its Caribbean colonies, and led directly to the outbreak of hostilities between the two countries the following year, the first of three Anglo-Dutch Wars that would last on and off for two decades and slowly erode Dutch naval power to England&#x27;s benefit.

In 1661, amidst the Qing conquest of China, Ming general Koxinga led a fleet to invade Formosa. The Dutch defense, led by governor Frederick Coyett, held out for nine months. However, after Koxinga defeated Dutch reinforcements from Java, Coyett surrendered Formosa. 

The Anglo-Dutch Wars were a series of three wars which took place between the English and the Dutch from 1652 to 1674. The causes included political disputes and increasing competition from merchant shipping. The English in the First Anglo-Dutch War (1652–54) had the naval advantage with larger numbers of more powerful &quot;ships of the line&quot; which were well suited to the naval tactics of the era. The English also captured numerous Dutch merchant ships. Holmes&#x27;s Bonfire was a raid on the Vlie estuary in the Netherlands, executed by the English Fleet during the Second Anglo-Dutch War on 19 and 20 August 1666. The attack, named after the commander of the landing force, Rear-Admiral Robert Holmes, was successful in destroying by fire a large Dutch merchant fleet of 140 ships. During the same action, the town of West-Terschelling was burnt down, which caused outrage in the Dutch Republic. 

The Second Anglo-Dutch War was precipitated in 1664, when English forces moved to capture New Netherland. Under the Treaty of Breda (1667), New Netherland was ceded to England in exchange for the English settlements in Suriname, which had been conquered by Dutch forces earlier that year. Though the Dutch would again take New Netherland in 1673, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, it was returned to England the following year, thereby ending Dutch rule in continental North America, but leaving behind a large Dutch community under English rule that persisted with its language, church and customs until the mid-18th century. In South America, the Dutch seized Cayenne from the French in 1658 and drove off a French attempt to retake it a year later. However, it was returned to France in 1664, since the colony proved to be unprofitable. It was recaptured by the Dutch in 1676, but was returned again a year later, this time permanently. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 saw the Dutch William of Orange ascend to the throne, and win the English, Scottish, and Irish crowns, ending eighty years of rivalry between the Netherlands and England, while the rivalry with France remained strong.

During the American Revolutionary War, Britain declared war on the Netherlands, the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, in which Britain seized the Dutch colony of Ceylon. Under the Peace of Paris (1783), Ceylon was returned to the Netherlands and Negapatnam ceded to Britain.

=== Napoleonic era (1795–1815) ===

In 1795, the French Revolutionary Army invaded the Dutch Republic and turned the nation into a satellite of France, named the Batavian Republic. Britain, which was at war with France, soon moved to occupy Dutch colonies in Asia, South Africa, and the Caribbean.

Under the terms of the Treaty of Amiens signed by Britain and France in 1802, the Cape Colony and the islands of the Dutch West Indies that the British had seized were returned to the Republic. Ceylon was not returned to the Dutch and was made a British Crown Colony. After the outbreak of hostilities between Britain and France again in 1803, the British retook the Cape Colony and the Dutch West Indies. The British also invaded and captured the island of Java in 1811.

In 1806, Napoleon dissolved the Batavian Republic and established a monarchy with his brother, Louis Bonaparte, on the throne as King of the Netherlands. Louis was removed from power by Napoleon in 1810, and the country was ruled directly from France until its liberation in 1813. The following year, the independent Netherlands signed the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 with Britain. All the colonies Britain had seized were returned to the Netherlands, with the exception of the Dutch Cape Colony, Dutch Ceylon, and part of Dutch Guyana.

=== Post-Napoleonic era (1815–1945) ===

After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in 1815, Europe&#x27;s borders were redrawn at the Congress of Vienna. For the first time since the declaration of independence from Spain in 1581, the Dutch were reunited with the Southern Netherlands in a constitutional monarchy, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. The union lasted just 15 years. In 1830, a revolution in the southern half of the country led to the &quot;de facto&quot; independence of the new state of Belgium.

The bankrupt Dutch East India Company was liquidated on 1 January 1800, and its territorial possessions were nationalized as the Dutch East Indies.
Anglo-Dutch rivalry in Southeast Asia continued to fester over the port of Singapore, which had been ceded to the British East India Company in 1819 by the sultan of Johore. The Dutch claimed that a treaty signed with the sultan&#x27;s predecessor the year earlier had granted them control of the region. However, the impossibility of removing the British from Singapore, which was becoming an increasingly important centre of trade, became apparent to the Dutch, and the disagreement was resolved with the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824. Under its terms, the Netherlands ceded Malacca and their bases in India to the British, and recognized the British claim to Singapore. In return, the British handed over Bencoolen and agreed not to sign treaties with rulers in the &quot;islands south of the Straits of Singapore&quot;. Thus the archipelago was divided into two spheres of influence: a British one, on the Malay Peninsula, and a Dutch one in the East Indies.

For most of the Dutch East Indies history, and that of the VOC before it, Dutch control over their territories was often tenuous, but was expanded over the course of the 19th century. Only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become the boundaries of modern-day Indonesia. Although highly populated and agriculturally productive Java was under Dutch domination for most of the 350 years of the combined VOC and Dutch East Indies era, many areas remained independent for much of this time including Aceh, Lombok, Bali, and Borneo.

In 1871, all of the Dutch possessions on the Dutch Gold Coast were sold to Britain. The Dutch West India Company was abolished in 1791, and its colonies in Suriname and the Caribbean brought under the direct rule of the state. The economies of the Dutch colonies in the Caribbean had been based on the smuggling of goods and slaves into Spanish America, but with the end of the slave trade in 1814 and the independence of the new nations of South and Central America from Spain, profitability rapidly declined. Dutch traders moved &quot;en masse&quot; from the islands to the United States or Latin America, leaving behind small populations with little income and which required subsidies from the Dutch government. The Antilles were combined under one administration with Suriname from 1828 to 1845.

Slavery was not abolished in the Dutch Caribbean colonies until 1863, long after those of Britain and France, though by this time only 6,500 slaves remained. In Suriname, slave holders demanded compensation from the Dutch government for freeing slaves, whilst in Sint Maarten, abolition of slavery in the French half in 1848 led slaves in the Dutch half to take their own freedom. In Suriname, after the abolition of slavery, Chinese workers were encouraged to immigrate as indentured labourers, as were Javanese, between 1890 and 1939.

=== Decolonization (1942–1975) ===

====Indonesia====

In January 1942, Japan invaded the Netherlands East Indies. The Dutch surrendered two months later in Java, with Indonesians initially welcoming the Japanese as liberators. The subsequent Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies during the remainder of World War II saw the fundamental dismantling of the Dutch colonial state&#x27;s economic, political and social structures, replacing it with a Japanese regime. In the decades before the war, the Dutch had been overwhelmingly successful in suppressing the small nationalist movement in Indonesia such that the Japanese occupation proved fundamental for Indonesian independence. However, the Indonesian Communist Party founded by Dutch socialist Henk Sneevliet in 1914, popular also with Dutch workers and sailors at the time, was in strategic alliance with Sarekat Islam (q.v.) as early as 1917 until the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence and was particularly important in the fight against Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies in the Second World War. The Japanese encouraged and backed Indonesian nationalism in which new indigenous institutions were created and nationalist leaders such as Sukarno were promoted. The internment of all Dutch citizens meant that Indonesians filled many leadership and administrative positions, although the top positions were still held by the Japanese.

Two days after the Japanese surrender in August 1945, Sukarno and fellow nationalist leader Hatta unilaterally declared Indonesian independence. A four-and-a-half-year struggle followed as the Dutch tried to re-establish their colony. Dutch forces eventually re-occupied most of the colonial territory and a guerrilla struggle ensued. The majority of Indonesians, and – ultimately – international opinion, favored independence, and in December 1949, the Netherlands formally recognized Indonesian sovereignty. Under the terms of the 1949 agreement, Western New Guinea remained under the auspices of the Dutch as Netherlands New Guinea, and its dispute will be resolved by a year. The new Indonesian government under President Sukarno pressured for the territory to come under Indonesian control as Indonesian nationalists initially intended. Following United States pressure, the Netherlands transferred it to Indonesia under the 1962 New York Agreement.

====Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles====
In 1954, under the &quot;Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands&quot;, the Netherlands, Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles (at the time including Aruba) became a composite state, known as the &quot;Tripartite Kingdom of the Netherlands&quot;. The former colonies were granted autonomy, save for certain matters including defense, foreign affairs and citizenship, which were the responsibility of the Realm. In 1969, unrest in Curaçao led to Dutch marines being sent to quell rioting. In 1973, negotiations started in Suriname for independence, and full independence was granted in 1975, marking the end of the Dutch colonial empire, with 60,000 emigrants taking the opportunity of moving to the Netherlands.

In 1986, Aruba was allowed to secede from the Netherlands Antilles federation, and was pressured by the Netherlands to move to independence within ten years. However, in 1994, it was agreed that its status as a Realm in its own right could continue. On 10 October 2010, the Netherlands Antilles were dissolved. Effective on that date, Curaçao and Sint Maarten acceded to the same country status within the Kingdom that Aruba already enjoyed. The islands of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba were granted a status similar to Dutch municipalities, and are now sometimes referred to as the Caribbean Netherlands.

== Legacy ==

Generally, the Dutch do not celebrate their imperial past, and colonial history is not featured prominently in Dutch schoolbooks. This perspective on their imperial past has only recently started to shift.

In a survey conducted by YouGov in March 2019, 50% of respondents in the Netherlands said they felt some level of pride in the Dutch colonial empire, while 6% felt ashamed.

===Dutch diaspora===

In some Dutch colonies, there are major ethnic groups of Dutch ancestry descending from emigrated Dutch settlers. In South Africa, the Boers and Cape Dutch are collectively known as the Afrikaners. The Burgher people of Sri Lanka and the Indo people of Indonesia as well as the Creoles of Suriname are mixed race people of Dutch descent.

In the U.S., there have been three American presidents of Dutch descent: Martin Van Buren, the first president who was not of British descent, and whose first language was Dutch, the 26th president Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd president, elected to four terms in office (1933 to 1945) and the only U.S. president to have served more than two terms.

===Dutch language===
====Dutch in Southeast Asia====
Despite the Dutch presence in Indonesia for almost 350 years, the Dutch language has no official status and the small minority that can speak the language fluently are either educated members of the oldest generation, or employed in the legal profession, as some legal codes are still available only in Dutch. The Indonesian language inherited many words from Dutch, both in words for everyday life, and as well in scientific or technological terminology. One scholar argues that 20% of Indonesian words can be traced back to Dutch words.

====Dutch in South Asia====
The century and half of Dutch rule in Ceylon (modern-day Sri Lanka) and southern India left few to no traces of the Dutch language.

====Dutch in the Americas====
In Suriname, Dutch is the official language. 82% of the population can speak Dutch fluently In Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, Dutch is the official language but a first language for only 7–8% of the population; though most of the population is fluent in Dutch, which is generally the language of education.

The population of the three northern Antilles, Sint Maarten, Saba, and Sint Eustatius, is predominantly English-speaking.

In New Jersey, an extinct dialect of Dutch, Jersey Dutch, was spoken by descendants of 17th-century Dutch settlers in Bergen and Passaic counties, was noted to still be spoken as late as 1921. U.S. President Martin Van Buren, raised in a Dutch-speaking enclave in New York, had Dutch as his native language.

====Dutch in Africa====
The greatest linguistic legacy of the Netherlands was in its colony in South Africa, which attracted large numbers of Dutch farmer (in Dutch, &quot;Boer&quot;) settlers, who spoke a simplified form of Dutch called &quot;Afrikaans&quot;, which is largely mutually intelligible with Dutch. After the colony passed into British hands, the settlers spread into the hinterland, taking their language with them. , there were 10 million people for whom Afrikaans is either a primary and secondary language, compared with over 22 million speakers of Dutch.

Other creole languages with Dutch linguistic roots are Papiamento still spoken in Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, and Sint Eustatius; Saramaccan and Sranan Tongo still spoken in Suriname; Berbice an extinct language in Guyana; Pecok spoken but in danger of extinction in Indonesia and the Netherlands; Albany Dutch spoken but in danger of extinction in the U.S.

Extinct Dutch-based creole languages include: Skepi (Guyana); Negerhollands (aka &quot;Negro Dutch&quot;), Jersey Dutch and Mohawk Dutch (U.S.), and Javindo (Java).

=== Placenames ===


Some towns of New York and areas of New York City, once part of the colony of New Netherland have names of Dutch origin, such as Brooklyn (after Breukelen), Flushing (after Vlissingen), the Bowery (after Bouwerij, construction site), Harlem (after Haarlem), Coney Island (from Conyne Eylandt, modern Dutch spelling Konijneneiland: Rabbit island) and Staten Island (meaning &quot;Island of the States&quot;). The last Director-General of the colony of New Netherland, Pieter Stuyvesant, has bequeathed his name to a street, a neighborhood and a few schools in New York City, and the town of Stuyvesant. Many of the towns and cities along the Hudson in upstate New York have placenames with Dutch origins (for example Yonkers, Hoboken, Haverstraw, Claverack, Staatsburg, Catskill, Kinderhook, Coeymans, Rensselaer, Watervliet). Nassau County, one of the four that make up Long Island, is also of Dutch origin. The Schuylkill river that flows into the Delaware at Philadelphia is also a Dutch name meaning hidden or skulking river.

Many towns and cities in Suriname share names with cities in the Netherlands, such as Alkmaar, Wageningen, and Groningen. The capital of Curaçao is named Willemstad and the capitals of both Saint Eustatius and Aruba are named Oranjestad. The first is named after the Dutch Prince Willem II van Oranje-Nassau (William of Orange-Nassau) and the two others after the first part of the current Dutch royal dynasty.

Many of South Africa&#x27;s major cities have Dutch names i.e. Johannesburg, Kaapstad, Vereeniging, Bloemfontein and Vanderbijlpark.

The country name &quot;New Zealand&quot; originated with Dutch cartographers, who called the islands &quot;Nova Zeelandia&quot;, after the Dutch province of Zeeland. British explorer James Cook subsequently anglicized the name to New Zealand.

The Australian island state Tasmania is named after Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, who made the first reported European sighting of the island on 24 November 1642. He first named the island Anthony van Diemen&#x27;s Land after his sponsor Anthony van Diemen, the Governor of the Dutch East Indies. The name was later shortened to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land by the British. It was officially renamed in honor of its first European discoverer on 1 January 1856. Arnhem Land is named after the Dutch ship named Arnhem. The captain of the Arnhem (Willem van Coolsteerdt) also named the large island, east of Arnhem Groote Eylandt, in modern Dutch spelling Groot Eiland: Large Island.
===Architecture===

In the Surinamese capital of Paramaribo, the Dutch Fort Zeelandia still stands today. The city itself also have retained most of its old street layout and architecture, which is part of the world&#x27;s UNESCO heritage. In the centre of Malacca, Malaysia, the Stadthuys Building and Christ Church still stand as a reminder of Dutch occupation. There are still archaeological remains of Fort Goede Hoop (modern Hartford, Connecticut) and Fort Orange (modern Albany, New York).

Dutch architecture is easy to see in Aruba, Curaçao, Bonaire, and Saint Eustatius. The Dutch style buildings are especially visible in Willemstad, with its steeply pitched gables, large windows and soaring finials.

Dutch architecture can also be found in Sri Lanka, especially in Galle where the Dutch fortification and canal have been retained intact, even to an extent the former tropical Villas of the VOC officials. Some of the most prominent example of these architecture is the former governor&#x27;s mansion in Galle, currently known as Amangalla Hotel and the Old Dutch Reformed Church. In the capital Colombo, many of the Dutch and Portuguese architecture around The Fort have been demolished during the British period, few of the remaining include Old Colombo Dutch Hospital and Wolvendaal Church.

During the period of Dutch colonisation in South Africa, a distinctive type of architecture, known as Cape Dutch architecture, was developed. These style of architecture can be found in historical towns such as Stellenbosch, Swellendam, Tulbagh, and Graaff-Reinet. In the former Dutch capital of Cape Town, nearly nothing from the VOC era have survived except the Castle of Good Hope.

Although the Dutch already started erecting buildings shortly after they arrived on the shores of Batavia, most Dutch-built constructions still standing today in Indonesia stem from the 19th and 20th centuries. Forts from the colonial era, used for defense purposes, still line a number of major coastal cities across the archipelago. The largest number of surviving Dutch buildings can be found on Java and Sumatra, particularly in cities such as Jakarta, Bandung, Semarang, Yogyakarta, Surabaya, Cirebon, Pasuruan, Bukittinggi, Sawahlunto, Medan, Padang, and Malang. There are also significant examples of 17–19th century Dutch architecture around Banda Neira, Nusa Laut, and Saparua, the former main spices islands, which due to limited economic development have retained many of its colonial elements. Another prominent example of Dutch colonial architecture is Fort Rotterdam in Makassar. The earlier Dutch construction mostly replicate the architecture style in the Homeland (such as Toko Merah). However these buildings were unsuitable to tropical climate and expensive to maintain. And as a result the Dutch officials begun to adapt to the tropical condition by applying native elements such as wide-open veranda, ventilation and indigenous high pitch roofing into their villas. &quot;In the beginning (of the Dutch presence), Dutch construction on Java was based on colonial architecture which was modified according to the tropical and local cultural conditions,&quot; Indonesian art and design professor Pamudji Suptandar wrote. This was dubbed &quot;arsitektur Indis&quot; (Indies architecture), which combines the existing traditional Hindu-Javanese style with European forms.

Many public buildings still standing and in use in Jakarta, such as the presidential palace, the finance ministry and the performing arts theater, were built in the 19th century in the classicist style. At the turn of the 20th century and partially due to the Dutch Ethical Policy, the number of Dutch people migrating to the colony grew with economic expansion. The increasing number of middle class population led to the development of Garden Suburbs in major city across the Indies, many of the houses were built in various style ranging from the Indies style, Neo-Renaissance to modern Art Deco. Some examples of these residential district include Menteng in Jakarta, Darmo in Surabaya, Polonia in Medan, Kotabaru in Yogyakarta, New Candi in Semarang and as well as most of North Bandung. Indonesia also became an experimental ground for Dutch Art Deco architectural movement such as Nieuwe Zakelijkheid, De Stijl, Nieuw Indische and Amsterdam School. Several famous architect such as Wolff Schoemaker and Henri Maclaine Pont also made an attempt to modernize indigenous architecture, resulting several unique design such as Pohsarang Church and Bandung Institute of Technology. The largest stock of these Art Deco building can be found in the city of Bandung, which &quot;architecturally&quot; can considered the most European city in Indonesia.

Since Indonesia&#x27;s independence, few governments have shown interest in the conservation of historical buildings. Many architecturally grand buildings have been torn down in the past decades to erect shopping centres or office buildings e.g. Hotel des Indes (Batavia), Harmony Society, Batavia. Presently, however, more Indonesians have become aware of the value of preserving their old buildings.

&quot;A decade ago, most people thought I was crazy when they learned of my efforts to save the old part of Jakarta. A few years later, the negative voices started to disappear, and now many people are starting to think with me: how are we going to save our city. In the past using the negative sentiment towards the colonial era was often used as an excuse to disregard protests against the demolition of historical buildings. An increasing number of people now see the old colonial buildings as part of their city&#x27;s overall heritage rather than focusing on its colonial aspect.&quot;, leading Indonesian architect and conservationist Budi Lim said.

===Infrastructure===

Beyond Indonesia&#x27;s art deco architecture also much of the country&#x27;s rail and road infrastructure as well as its major cities were built during the colonial period. Many of Indonesia&#x27;s main cities were mere rural townships before colonial industrialization and urban development. Examples on Java include the capital Jakarta and Bandung, outside Java examples include Ambon and Menado city. Most main railroads and rail stations on Java as well as the main road, called Daendels Great Post Road (Dutch: Grote Postweg) after the Governor General commissioning the work, connecting west to east Java were also built during the Dutch East Indies era.

Between 1800 and 1950, Dutch engineers created an infrastructure including of roads, of railways, many large bridges, modern irrigation systems covering 1.4 million hectares (5,400 sq mi) of rice fields, several international harbors, and 140 public drinking water systems. These Dutch constructed public works became the material base of the colonial and postcolonial Indonesian state.

===Agriculture===

Crops such like coffee, tea, cocoa, tobacco and rubber were all introduced by the Dutch. The Dutch were the first to start the spread of the coffee plant in Central and South America, and by the early 19th century Java was the third largest producer in the world. In 1778, the Dutch brought cacao from the Philippines to Indonesia and commenced mass production. Currently Indonesia is the world&#x27;s second largest producer of natural rubber, a crop that was introduced by the Dutch in the early 20th century. Tobacco was introduced from the Americas and in 1863, the first plantation was established by the Dutch. Today Indonesia is not only the oldest industrial producer of tobacco, but also the second largest consumer of tobacco.

===Scientific discoveries===
Java Man was discovered by Eugène Dubois in Indonesia in 1891. The Komodo dragon was firstly described by Peter Ouwens in Indonesia in 1912 after an airplane crash in 1911 and rumors about living dinosaurs on Komodo Island in 1910.

===Sport===
====Suriname====
Many Suriname-born football players and Dutch-born football players of Surinamese descent, like Gerald Vanenburg, Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard, Edgar Davids, Clarence Seedorf, Patrick Kluivert, Aron Winter, Georginio Wijnaldum, Virgil van Dijk and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink have turned out to play for the Dutch national team. In 1999, Humphrey Mijnals, who played for both Suriname and the Netherlands, was elected Surinamese footballer of the century. Another famous player is André Kamperveen, who captained Suriname in the 1940s and was the first Surinamese to play professionally in the Netherlands.

Suriname discourages dual citizenship and Surinamese-Dutch players who have picked up a Netherlands passport – which, crucially, offers legal work status in almost any European league – are barred from selection to the national team. In 2014, inspired by the success of teams with dual nationals, especially Algeria, SVB president John Krishnadath submitted a proposal to the national assembly to allow dual citizenship for athletes with the then-goal of reaching the 2018 FIFA World Cup finals. In order to support this project, a team with professional players of Surinamese origin was assembled and played an exhibition match on 26 December 2014 at the Andre Kamperveen Stadion. The project is managed by Nordin Wooter and David Endt, who have set up a presentation and sent invitations to 100 players of Surinamese origin, receiving 85 positive answers. Dean Gorré was named to coach this special selection. FIFA supported the project and granted insurance for the players and clubs despite the match being unofficial. In November 2019, it was announced that a so-called sports passport would allow Dutch professional footballers from the Surinamese diaspora to represent Suriname.

Suriname also has a national korfball team, with korfball being a Dutch sport. Vinkensport is also practised in Suriname, as are popular among the Dutch sports of volleyball and troefcall.

====South Africa====
Ajax Cape Town were a professional football team named and owned by Ajax Amsterdam, replicating their crest and colours.

The Dutch sport of korfball is administered by the South African Korfball Federation, who manage the South Africa national korfball team. The 2019 IKF World Korfball Championship was held in August 2019 in Durban, South Africa.

====Indonesia====
The Indonesian football league started around 1930 in the Dutch colonial era. The Indonesian men&#x27;s team was the first Asian team to qualify for the FIFA World Cup; in 1938 FIFA World Cup they played as the Dutch East Indies. Association football is now the most popular sport in Indonesia, in terms of annual attendance, participation and revenue and it is played on all levels, from children to middle-aged men.

The Indonesian Tennis Association was also founded during Dutch rule in 1935, and has a long history of fielding its national Fed Cup team and Davis Cup team, although the first participation&#x27;s in the 60s were not till after independence.

As in the Netherlands, volleyball remains a popular sport, with the Indonesian Volleyball Federation organising both the Men&#x27;s Pro Liga and women&#x27;s Pro Liga and administers the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s national teams.

The Dutch sport of korfball is also practised, and there is a national korfball team.

<text>An outport is the term given for a small coastal community in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Originally, the term was used for coastal communities on the island of Newfoundland, but the term has now been adopted for those on the mainland area of Labrador as well.

==History==
Outports are some of the oldest European settlements in Canada. John Cabot visited Newfoundland in 1497; news spread quickly that Cabot had caught cod by simply lowering and lifting a weighted basket. Gaspar Corte-Real of Portugal visited Newfoundland in 1500, and by 1506 the catch from the Grand Banks of Newfoundland encouraged the King of Portugal to impose a ten percent import tariff to protect local fishermen. The first recorded French fishing boat on the Grand Banks was in 1504, Basque whalers arrived in 1527, and Spanish fishermen followed by 1540.

Many fishing boats, also known as dories, would sail in April or May and return in September. The seasonal fresh catch of &quot;wet&quot; fish were initially returned to Europe to be densely salted and air-dried for preservation until later use, but drying fish in Newfoundland outports allowed each boat to bring back a more valuable cargo of already dried fish from each voyage. The westbound Atlantic crossing carried an expanded crew including a shore party. While the normal crew fished from boats, the shore party felled trees to construct a small wharf or fishing stage and platforms of brush and small boughs upon which the fish would be dried about three feet above the ground. The boats returned to the fishing stage where they threw their catch to be gutted and split by the shore party, who then lightly salted the split fish and arranged them to dry on the platforms. The drying fish were covered with sailcloth every night and during fog or rainy weather, and rearranged periodically for several weeks until they hardened and could be stacked like boards. The dried fish were then stored in sheds until the expanded crew and cargo were loaded for the eastbound Atlantic crossing.

During the fishing and drying season, members of the shore party were able to increase their profits for the voyage by trading with First Nations residents bringing furs to the outport. As Grand Banks fishing increased, the best outport locations might be secured for future use if part of the shore party would volunteer to winter-over in the outport and keep the fishing stage, drying platforms, storage sheds, and small boats in good repair. Surviving a winter in the outport was easier for men who found friendly Mi&#x27;kmaq to teach them to find and preserve the local berries to prevent scurvy. Some outport caretakers returned to Europe after wintering over, while others &quot;went native&quot; and remained in Newfoundland Jacques Cartier was offered furs by indigenous residents of Chaleur Bay in 1534, indicating previous experience with European fur traders; and Cartier found members of the Montagnais First Nation engaged in fishing for a French Captain Thiennot. On his return voyage in 1536, Cartier left one of his larger ships&#x27; boats at Renewse Harbor, Newfoundland, indicating the outport was already in use as a used boat exchange for fishing vessels needing boats for inshore fishing, but not wanting to transport them across the Atlantic.

Both the First Nations and Europeans considered these outport communities temporary facilities of the fish trade. European populated outports initially depended upon the good will of the local First Nation; and historians often consider the outports as First Nations settlements until well after colonization authorized by European monarchs. The pattern of small isolated settlements was reinforced by actions of the Parliament of England to make permanent settlement of Newfoundland illegal. Seventeenth century English fishermen and fish merchants wished to avoid competition from a local population gaining control of the most productive fishing locations as the New England colonies had done in the Gulf of Maine. The questionable legal status of Newfoundland&#x27;s clandestine settlements discouraged the type of infrastructure investments found in the Maritime Provinces.

On the island of Newfoundland, residents of the capital city of St. John&#x27;s are frequently referred to as &quot;townies&quot;, whereas those not from St. John&#x27;s are referred to as &quot;baymen&quot; or &quot;bay wops&quot;, that is those living beyond Conception Bay. This usage originates from the time before reliable land transportation on the island, when most travel was by boat and settlements were located on the coast.

The railway construction in the 1890s resulted in the creation of inland communities that relied on land-based natural resources. The outports began to see wholesale depopulation following cutbacks to ferry services and construction of roads throughout the island during and after the Second World War. Following Confederation in 1949, the government of premier Joey Smallwood pursued a policy of forced/encouraged resettlement of residents from outports to central inland communities where provision of schools, health care and other government services could be achieved more cheaply.

Farley Mowat was among the critics of the resettlement program who noted that it resulted in what was likened to a &quot;cultural genocide&quot; as rural Newfoundland society became decimated. The cod moratorium of 1992 was another blow to the outport communities, whose entire economies were based on the ocean and its resources. Throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s, outports have voluntarily agreed to depopulate as government required 100% agreement among residents for resettlement, prior to agreeing to close a community. In March 2013, Newfoundland &amp; Labrador Finance Minister Jerome Kennedy announced that households agreeing to resettle from some isolated communities will be given lump-sum payments of up to CAD $270,000.

Only a small proportion of the provincial population remains in outports along the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador. With no highway access, limited economic growth due to declines in the fishery, and ongoing depopulation as young people move to larger urban centres, the outport is an endangered phenomenon.

A 1969 CBC radio documentary by Canadian pianist Glenn Gould called &quot;The Latecomers&quot; profiled Newfoundland outports.

<text>The New Little Belt Bridge () is a suspension bridge that crosses the Little Belt strait between Jutland (Jylland) and the island of Funen (Fyn) in Denmark. The bridge is 1,700 metres long, the main span is 600 metres, the pylons reaching a height of 120 metres, and the maximum clearance from the sea is 44 metres.

The New Little Belt Bridge was built from 1965 to 1970 and was opened by King Frederik IX on 21 October 1970.

The bridge was constructed to alleviate congestion on the Old Little Belt Bridge due to the increasing car traffic between Jutland and Funen. It is a motorway on the E20 bridge with three-lane carriageways as opposed to the single lanes of the old bridge. The bridge has heating in the road deck, so it can be kept free of ice and snow in winter. Passing over Little Belt Bridge is toll-free.

==Cultural references==
The new Little Belt Bridge is seen at 0:12:11 in &quot;The Olsen Gang in Jutland&quot;, marking the Olsen Gang&#x27;s arrival to Jutland.

<text>An outport is any port considered secondary to a main port (including a provincial one as opposed to a capital one), and often (especially) a small port built to support the commercial operations of a large port. The Port of Tilbury from the Port of London is a good example. Avonmouth for Bristol and, on a smaller and now historical scale, Fordwich for Canterbury are others.

<text>Keewatinook (previously spelt &quot;Kewatinook&quot;) is a provincial electoral district in the Canadian province of Manitoba.

The riding existed previously under the name Rupertsland; however, starting with the 2011 general election, the riding was renamed &quot;Kewatinook&quot; which means &#x27;from the north&#x27; in Cree. Effective as of the 2019 election, the spelling was corrected to &quot;Keewatinook&quot;.
Currently the largest riding in the province, Keewatinook is a sprawling northern constituency occupying a large portion of eastern Manitoba. Its current area stretches from the Ontario border in the southeast to the Nunavut border in the north; it is also bordered by the ridings of Lac Du Bonnet to the south and Flin Flon, The Pas, and Thompson to the west.

, Ian Bushie is the MLA for this riding. 

== History ==
The division, originally named &quot;Rupertsland&quot;, was created in 1915 from territories that were added to the province of Manitoba four years earlier and has existed continuously since that time. The area had been part of the Grand Rapids and Churchill and Nelson electoral districts for the 1914 Manitoba general election.

Before 1966, elections in this riding were usually deferred until a later date than the rest of the province, due to the increased time it took to run elections in the region.

The riding&#x27;s was originally smaller than its current size until 1989, when it gained a significant amount of territory from the former riding of Churchill.

As part of the 2008 riding redistribution by the Manitoba Boundaries Commission, its name was changed to &quot;Kewatinook&quot; (Cree for &#x27;from the north&#x27;) beginning with the 2011 general election. Effective as of the 2019 election, the spelling was corrected to &quot;Keewatinook&quot;.

Prior to the 2016 election, the New Democratic Party represented the riding from 1969 to 2016, when Judy Klassen of the Liberal Party defeated longtime MLA Eric Robinson. The NDP would regain control of the seat in 2019, with Ian Bushie defeating Liberal Jason Harper.

== Demographics ==
Keewatinook&#x27;s population in 2006 was 15,560. In 1999, the average family income was $33,787 (the fourth-lowest in Manitoba), and the unemployment rate was 25%. Over 34% of the riding&#x27;s population have less than a Grade 9 education, the highest such rate in the province. Government services account for 21% of the riding&#x27;s industry, followed by education services at 17%.

Eighty-seven per cent of Keewatinook&#x27;s residents are Indigenous, the highest percentage in the province. Over half of the population list Cree as their mother tongue. In 1999, there was only a 1% immigrant population.

<text>Gordon Marshall (born 20 June 1952) is a British sociologist and former Director of the Leverhulme Trust in England.

== Education ==
Born in Falkirk, Gordon Marshall was educated at Falkirk High School, the University of Stirling (BA Sociology 1974) and Nuffield College, Oxford (DPhil 1978).

== Career ==
Prior to joining the Leverhulme Trust, Gordon Marshall was vice-chancellor of the University of Reading, 2003–2011. He oversaw major advances in its teaching and research profile and the merger with the former Henley Management College to form Henley Business School. His period of office was also characterised by significant investment in University facilities, including the Minghella Building for the performing arts, the replacement of many of the university&#x27;s halls of residence, and a new building for the Henley Business School. During his term of office, there was some controversy over the closure, on economic grounds, of the departments of Physics and Health and Social Care.

Between 2007 and 2011 he was also Chairman of the Higher Education Statistics Agency, and from 2013 to 2017 was Chair of the UK Data Service/Digital Information Strategic Advisory Committee.

Previous to this, Marshall was the chief executive of the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), from 2000 to 2002. The increasing impact of the ESRC&#x27;s work, and the regard in which it was held, became apparent at this time. Described as a team player who led quietly but with focus, it is no surprise that Marshall later insisted that any success under his direction was a collective effort and attributable to all staff at the council. However, under his leadership the ESRC achieved the highest proportionate increase in its income, and earned the highest increase of all the research councils in two successive spending reviews. This saw the budget rise from under £70 million to over £110 million; a growth of nearly one third of total income.

Like his predecessor Ron Amman, Marshall was a distinguished social science researcher, before being appointed to the ESRC. Prior appointments included a professorship in sociology at the University of Bath, lecturership and senior lecturership at the University of Essex, Morris Ginsberg Fellowship at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at Nuffield College, Oxford. He has also been a visiting professor at several European universities.

== Research ==
Marshall has made important contributions to interdisciplinary and cross-national comparative work in the social sciences. His main fields of research include social exclusion, equality of opportunity, distributive justice and the culture of economic enterprise, and he has written widely on these topics. He played an instrumental role in the Government Review of social classifications, both as a consultant and as a member of the steering group to the study, which was run jointly by the ESRC and the Office for National Statistics and which resulted in major changes to official classifications.

Marshall&#x27;s early research was focused on Max Weber and the origins of modern economies. His first book, based on his doctoral thesis, concerned Calvinism and the development of capitalism in seventeenth-century Scotland. In later publications he addressed the complexities of social mobility and social class which were central to the concerns of the so-called ‘Nuffield School’ of sociology. In his co-authored volume, &quot;Against the Odds? Social Class and Social Justice in Industrial Societies&quot;, published in 1997, Marshall and his colleagues took a cautious and nuanced view of the relationship between social class, social mobility and social justice through educational opportunities. Their research was rooted, in Nuffield style, in a range of social survey empirical data.

His single-authored volume &quot;Repositioning Class: Social Inequality in Industrial Societies&quot;, also published in 1997, brought together a number of his essays from the previous decade, in which he argues that public pronouncements about the death of social class were greatly exaggerated. As Marshall wrote in the preface to this volume, “Social class is as important to the understanding of late twentieth-century industrial societies as it was to their early capitalist counterparts and class analysis is probably now in a healthier state than at any previous time in its long sociological history”.

Marshall&#x27;s main contribution to Nuffield sociology was his connection of concepts of social justice with social mobility. He argued persuasively that political intervention is required to prevent class inequalities from impeding the advance of social justice.

During the 1990s Marshall also played an important part in the creation of the department of sociology at Oxford University, in the teeth of some stiff resistance, especially from among the political scientists who wanted to subsume the subject under their discipline.

== Awards and honours ==
He was an Official Fellow of Nuffield College at the University of Oxford from 1993 until 1999. Elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 2000 and of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters in 2001 and awarded a CBE in 2003 for his services to economic and social science.

Marshall has been awarded honorary degrees by the Universities of Aberdeen, Exeter, Reading and Stirling.

<text>Epirote Islands are those northern Ionian islands that are in proximity to the Epirus mainland.

These include:
*Kerkyra (Κέρκυρα) usually known as Corfu in English
*Paxi (Παξοί) (includes Antipaxos) also known as Paxos in English
*Lefkada (Λευκάδα) also known as Lefkas in English
*Ithaki (Ιθάκη) usually known as Ithaca (the island of Odysseus) in English

==Legend==

According to legend, the Epirote Islands were ruled by the descendants of Neoptolemus (or Pyrrhus), who came there, defeating the native Molossoi, after the events of the Trojan War. The island of Ithaki was also the legendary home of Odysseus, though he was exiled by Neoptolemus after the slaughter of Penelope&#x27;s suitors in the Odyssey.

==History==
At the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War in 431 BCE most of the islands, notably Kerkyra, took the side of Athens but Lefkada took the side of Sparta.

In the 4th century BCE under another king Neoptolemos of the same dynasty, Molossoi (or Molossians) became more urbanized inhabiting also the area of contemporary Zagoria, where significant archeological findings (kept in the Ioannina archeological museum) were excavated in the villages of Elafotopos and Vitsa by the Vikos gorge. Still herding the western highlands of the Pindos in Zagoria, Molossoi were in constant friction over grazing, with Macedonians on the other side of the range.

When, by the Treaty of Paris of November 5, 1815, the Ionian Islands became a protectorate of the United Kingdom, Corfu became the seat of the British high commissioner. The British commissioners, who were practically autocrats in spite of the retention of the native senate and assembly, introduced a strict method of government which brought about a decided improvement in the material prosperity of the islands, but by its very strictness displeased the natives. In 1864 it was, with the other Ionian Islands, ceded to the kingdom of Greece, in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants.

==The islands today==

Today all the islands are part of the Greek region of Ionian Islands. Kerkyra has a population of 97,000, Lefkada 21,000, Ithaki 3,000 and Paxi 2,000.

In recent decades the islands have lost population through emigration and the decline of their traditional industries, fishing and marginal agriculture. Today their major industry is tourism. Kerkyra in particular, with its magnificent harbour, splendid scenery and wealth of picturesque ruins and castles, is a favourite stopping place for cruise liners. British tourists in particular are attracted through having read Gerald Durrell&#x27;s evocative book &quot;My Family and Other Animals&quot; (1956), which describes his childhood on Kerkyra in the 1930s.

<text>Decree 900 (), also known as the Agrarian Reform Law, was a Guatemalan land-reform law passed on June 17, 1952, during the Guatemalan Revolution. The law was introduced by President Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán and passed by the Guatemalan Congress. It redistributed unused land greater than in area to local peasants, compensating landowners with government bonds. Land from at most 1,700 estates was redistributed to about 500,000 individuals—one-sixth of the country&#x27;s population. The goal of the legislation was to move Guatemala&#x27;s economy from pseudo-feudalism into capitalism. Although in force for only eighteen months, the law had a major effect on the Guatemalan land-reform movement.

Indigenous groups, deprived of land since the Spanish conquest, were major beneficiaries of the decree. In addition to raising agricultural output by increasing the cultivation of land, the reform is credited with helping many Guatemalans find dignity and autonomy. The expropriation of land led major landowners–including the United Fruit Company–to lobby the United States government to intervene by construing the Guatemalan government as communist. Decree 900 was thus a direct impetus for the 1954 coup d&#x27;état, which deposed Árbenz and instigated decades of civil war.

==Background==
When Árbenz was elected in 1951, Guatemala had a high GDP but extremely unequal distribution of land: 2% of the population controlled 72% of the arable land. Only 12% of this land was under cultivation. Much of the population without land was poor, and had associated health problems. Indigenous people had been treated as subordinate for hundreds of years, and had become increasingly impoverished and dependent on wages from plantation work. Indigenous people were also required to serve as migrant laborers through legal coercion, as Guatemala&#x27;s coffee industry expanded rapidly from the 1870s through the 1930s.

After Juan Jose Arévalo won the 1944 election, Guatemala created a reformist constitution in 1945. This constitution explicitly stated that the government should protect communal land and create policies that would lead to equitable distribution of wealth. Article 88 of the 1945 Guatemalan Constitution, which served as the legal basis for Decree 900, stipulates: &quot;It is a primary function of the State to develop agricultural activities and industry in general, toward the end that the fruits of labor shall preferentially benefit those who produce them and that the wealth shall reach the greatest number of inhabitants of the Republic.&quot; Article 90 recognizes the existence of private property, but suggests that rights to property could be waived in the social interest. This constitution marked the beginning of the Ten Years of Spring, also known as the Guatemalan Revolution: a period of democratization and liberal reforms.

Árbenz sought to transform Guatemala from a feudalist to a capitalist economy by distributing capital and creating infrastructure to increase production. The wish to transform Guatemala into a competitive capitalist nation led Árbenz to push for the construction of a national highway, a new port, a hydroelectric power plant—and for increased cultivation of unused lands.

==Legislation==
Árbenz began promoting agrarian reform soon after becoming president. He was aided politically by a renewed Communist Party of Guatemala (PGT), which believed that some amount of capitalist development necessarily preceded a communist revolution. Árbenz accepted help from the PGT and its leaders were among his personal friends; however, he rejected some of their proposals, including a mandate for the organization of producer cooperatives.

The proposed law gained widespread support among peoples&#x27; organizations and in the national press, but was opposed by the Asociación General de Agricultores (AGA), which represented the existing landowners.

Presented with a draft by the President, the Guatemalan Congress met on Saturdays and Sundays for five weeks. Congress introduced some changes to Árbenz&#x27;s version, most notably restoring the idea of cooperatives (although not to the degree proposed by the PGT). Decree 900—&quot;Ley de Reforma Agraria&quot;—was passed on 17 June 1952 at 1:45 AM and signed into law by Árbenz on the same day. It called for of farmland to be redistributed to 100,000 families. Specifically, it authorized the redistribution of all uncultivated land on estates larger than , and of land on estates sized from , on which less than two-thirds of the land was cultivated. It also specified total redistribution of the government owned &quot;fincas nacionales&quot;, which contributed a quarter of the nation&#x27;s coffee production.

Article 1 of the law reads:

The Agrarian Reform of the October Revolution intends to eliminate the feudal property structure in the countryside and develop relations of production that originate to develop the land to the form of operational and capitalist methods of production in agriculture and to prepare the way for the industrialization of Guatemala.

Proponents of the law stated that it was intended to “eliminate all feudal type property...especially work-servitude and the remnant of slavery”. Decree 900 specifically abolished slavery, unpaid labor, work as payment of rent, and relocation of indigenous workers.

===Mechanisms===
The law did not redistribute land automatically. It created a National Agrarian Department (DAN), and required people without land to file requests with Local Agrarian Committees (CALs). CALs would then make decisions about how to reappropriate the land of major owners. Landowners could dispute these decisions, with an appeals process going all the way up to the President. The committees were formed from local groups, and intended to foster the spirit of community control and local political power. As suggested by the PGT, the law also gave new landowners the option of choosing lifetime tenure instead of private ownership, with the goal of preventing large landowners from simply buying back the land. The &quot;Fincas Nationales&quot; were available only through the lifetime tenure option. According to José Manuel Fortuny, a PGT leader who helped draft the legislation:

We [the PGT] proposed the creation of peasant committees [CALs] in order to lay the groundwork for the eventual radicalization of the peasantry. We talked to Arbenz about this, and he agreed with us. What we wanted was to foster the control of the reform from below. This would give the peasants a strong sense of their common needs. And if, from the system of lifetime tenure, cooperatives developed, the seeds of a more collective society would have been sown.

Finally, the law established a system for using bonds to compensate people who lost acres to peasants. The property owners were paid in bonds which matured in 25 years; value of the land was based on claims made on the previous year&#x27;s tax returns.

===Land, literacy and credit===
Credit for those receiving land was mandated by additional legislation in 1953, which also established a National Agrarian Bank (BNA). The government dispensed $3,371,185 in loans during 1953; $3,049,092 (around 90%) had been paid back by July 1954—a historically unusual success in lending.

Beginning in 1954, land and credit were supplemented by literacy programs—the third major plank of the reform program.

==Effects on Guatemala==
===Land and farming===
By 1954, had been reappropriated and 100,000 families (about 500,000 people, one sixth of the population) had received land as well as bank credit and technical aid. The law affected about 1,700 estates of the country&#x27;s richest and most conservative people and groups

Production of corn, coffee, and bananas increased while the law was in effect in 1953 and 1954. High coffee prices bolstered the national economy and offset the flight of foreign capital. According to a report by the U.S. Embassy in 1954, &quot;A preliminary analysis of the President&#x27;s report left little doubt, as long as coffee prices are at their present high level, that the Guatemalan economy was basically prosperous.&quot;

Decree 900 led to the expropriation of of Árbenz&#x27;s own land and belonging to foreign minister Guillermo Toriello. Minister of Agriculture Nicolás Brol also had some of his land redistributed.

===Conflicts over implementation===
Various sources (including Árbenz and the government) reported conflicts over implementing the law. Decree 900 triggered domestic opposition from landowners and some elements within the military. The reforms were also opposed by the Catholic Church and the business class.

Landowners complained of unfair practices, but so did others who felt excluded or that they were getting a bad deal. Some peasants seized land without going through the legal channels, believing that the law provided them with a mandate. Sometimes the expropriators fought each other over who would get a certain piece of land. Other violent incidents among peasants were self-defense or retaliation against landowners who sought to disobey the law or intimidate them. In some places, peasants organized groups for self-defense and requested (usually without success) arms permits from the government. According to Neale Pearson, there were instances where &quot;peasants illegally occupied lands and a few in which they burned pastures or crops in order to have land declared uncultivated and subject to expropriation. But these cases were isolated and limited in number&quot;.

Sometimes legal councils had difficulty measuring land, or determining how much land on an estate was really unused.

Union representatives began to travel through the countryside, informing people of the new law. Landowners closed private roads going through their property in order to prevent peasants from becoming informed of the changes. The government announced that all road would become public. Some local police forces (and other government officials) initially sanctioned some landowner retaliation. These groups, too, responded to government pressure to implement the reforms.

===Changes in political power===
By 1954, more than 3000 CALs had been formed. These organizations, which controlled the distribution of land at a local level, represented a substantial increase in political power for ordinary people and people&#x27;s organizations such as unions. However, the law also increased the power of the President and of the new national council, the DAN.

In 1953, the Supreme Court ruled that the lack of judicial oversight for the reform was unconstitutional, and it blocked any further implementation. Congress, with Árbenz&#x27;s urging, voted to impeach four judges. This decision provoked anti-government demonstrations, in the course of which one person was killed.

Historian Douglas Trefzger has reported that the land reform disproportionately benefited Ladinos, relative to Indians. It seems that although the short-lived policies of Decree 900 had a positive effect on indigenous Guatemalans—particularly on their political consciousness—poverty and associated problems persisted.

The CNCG peasant league, founded in 1950 by activists and members of the teachers&#x27; union, grew rapidly during this time and by 1945 was the largest peoples&#x27; organization in the country. The second largest was the CGTG, a rural labor union.

Efforts were made to win military support for Decree 900. These included the provision of incentives for peasants to join the army, as well as attempts to foster ties between the armed forces and the DAN. Some conflicts did emerge around the country as military leaders and peasant organizers competed for local power. These were ameliorated by new appointments to military positions. But these changes in military structure further upset some officers and contributed to the desertions and defections that allowed the coup to succeed.

==International response and 1954 coup==
===Expropriation of United Fruit===
In 1953 Árbenz announced that under the Agrarian Reform Law—specifically, because of an order made by the DAN—Guatemala was expropriating approximately of uncultivated land from the United Fruit Company. United Fruit owned in Guatemala, 42% of the nation&#x27;s (arable) land. The company was compensated with $627,572 in bonds for the expropriation of their holdings, the amount United Fruit had claimed the land was worth for tax purposes. However, United Fruit proceeded to claim that its land was worth more. It had close ties to U.S. officials and lobbied the U.S. for intervention. The US State Department, on behalf of the United Fruit Company, claimed to Guatemala that the land was worth $15,854,849.

===United States opposition===
A report written by the U.S. State Department&#x27;s Office of Intelligence Research suggested that the reform itself would only affect 1,710 landowners, but expressed fear that the law would strengthen the position of communists in Guatemala. U.S. opposition to the Árbenz government certainly resulted from his reformist policies, but historians differ on the relative importance of expropriating United Fruit versus the apparent communist threat implied by land reform.

Because of the Agrarian Reform Law, the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company in August 1952 announced that it would no longer purchase Guatemalan chicle. Since Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company had been the sole buyer of the product, the Árbenz government suddenly had to provide a massive aid program for chicle harvesters.

After aborting a coup attempt called Operation PBFortune, the United States—through its Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)—renewed efforts to unseat Árbenz with Operation PBSuccess (1953–1954). It sought to develop relationships with members of Guatemalan military, and instituted an arms blockade that caused the military to fear a security crisis or even US invasion. The key agent for a possible coup was the exiled colonel Castillo Armas. The CIA also intensified propaganda campaigns to isolate Guatemala among Central American nations, and to convince the Guatemalan people that the Árbenz regime was on the brink of collapse.

===Military coup===
In June 1954, Árbenz Guzmán was overthrown by a multi-faceted coup operation involving a small army led by Carlos Castillo Armas, scattered right-wing violence in the countryside, a U.S. Navy blockade (called Operation Hardrock Baker), bombardment by CIA planes, and a sophisticated CIA strategy of psychological warfare intended to demoralize Árbenz and provoke military defections. Thus, although Armas&#x27;s ground invasion was quickly defeated, Árbenz resigned his post and Armas won control from the vacuum of power.

==Repeal==
Armas became president on 8 July. He quickly repealed Decree 900 and reversed 95% of the redistribution that had occurred. (All of the land formerly owned by United Fruit was restored.) Government documents pertaining to Decree 900 were also destroyed. Armas created a new Agrarian Commission and passed two new laws, which restored control over land policy to government officials. Some land changed hands as a result of these laws, but the scope of reform was substantially reduced. Armas also abolished government support for labor unions and denounced their members as &quot;communists&quot;.

A long period of civil war followed, with indigenous and poor Guatemalans fighting against landowners and the military. Peace accords reached in 1996 repudiate Armas&#x27;s policy, and those that followed called for a return to the idea of land as a social good.

<doc id="1283811" wikidata="Q7120510" url="?curid=1283811" title="Pennsylvania Railroad class S2">
<text>The Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s S2 class was a steam turbine locomotive designed and built in a collaborative effort by Baldwin Locomotive Works and Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company, as an attempt to prolong the dominance of the steam locomotive by adapting technology that had been widely accepted in the marine industry. One was built, #6200, delivered in September 1944. The S2 was the sole example of the 6-8-6 wheel arrangement in the Whyte notation, with a six-wheel leading truck keeping the locomotive stable at speed, eight powered and coupled driving wheels, and a six-wheel trailing truck supporting the large firebox. The S2 used a direct-drive steam turbine provided by the Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company, geared to the center pair of axles with the outer two axles connected by side rods; the fixed gear ratio was 18.5:1. Such design was to prevent energy loss and S2 achieved a mechanical efficiency of 97% which means only 3% of steam energy was lost within the propulsion equipment. The disadvantage of a direct-drive steam turbine was that the turbine could not operate at optimal speeds over the locomotive&#x27;s entire speed range. The S2 was the largest, heaviest and fastest direct-drive turbine locomotive design ever built.

==Design specification==
The locomotive was to be a 4-8-4, but wartime restrictions on light steel alloys increased weight until six-wheel leading and trailing trucks were needed; its construction was also delayed by World War II. Construction of the locomotive took place at the Baldwin plant in Eddystone. Two turbines were fitted, one for forward travel and a smaller one for reversing at speeds up to . Superheated steam at a rate of about 2,000 pounds per hour was directed onto the turbine blades through 4 nozzles; thousands of turbine blades transmitted steam energy to the transmission gear. The maximum rotation speed of the forward turbine is 9,000 rpm, developing 6,900 hp; the reverse turbine generates 1,500 hp at 8,300 rpm. A monitoring system ensured that the forward turbine could only be started when the reverse turbine was switched off. Weight of propulsion equipment was 39,000 lbs., or 5.65 lbs/hp. A large boiler with a Belpaire firebox and long combustion chamber was fitted. An automatic lubrication system was installed, connecting the transmission case, where the driving gear wheels were immersed in a lubricant reservoir filled with lubricating oil. Lubricant goes through all lubrication points, including roller bearings on all axles via the filtered pipes with the help of two steam pumps. A Worthington-pattern feedwater heater was fitted for increased efficiency. Twin air pumps for train braking were fitted below the running boards beside the smokebox front, and a large radiator assembly at the nose cooled the compressed air.

The turbine exhaust was piped through a set of four nozzles in the smokebox, providing an even draft for the fire and exiting through a unique quadruple stack. S2 had no smoke deflector when it was delivered from Baldwin to PRR in September 1944, but, soon after it began its service, PRR found out that the locomotive blew heavy smoke at lower speed during operation. So, a pair of small smoke deflectors was acquired and a thin semi-circular metal plate for smoke lifting was filled a few feet behind the smokestack. Apparently, these weren&#x27;t adequate, so a much-larger pair which look like the &quot;elephant ears&quot; used on New York Central class S1b 4-8-4 Niagara and Union Pacific FEF-3 4-8-4 was added at Altoona Works in December, 1946. Using a smoke deflector was never a tradition of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Prior to S2 #6200, there were only three K4s-installed smoke deflectors between 1939 and 1941, for an experimental purpose: PRR #5038, #3876 and #3878. Their smoke deflectors were all removed after the war, so the steam turbine #6200 was the only Pennsy locomotive with huge &quot;elephant ears&quot; after the war.

The tender of the PRR S2 #6200 was originally made for a class L1s locomotive with the designation 180-F-82. Later, it was assigned as 180-P-75 for class K4s No. 3768; the tender was rebuilt again and received the designation 180-P-85 for S2 6200 use. This large 16-wheel tender was similar to that used on the PRR&#x27;s other large passenger locomotives, the T1 and S1. In order to reduce the crew&#x27;s workload, a &quot;Fluid Pressure Control System&quot; () designed by Westinghouse engineer Harry C. May was installed on the locomotive. It controlled starting, running, reversing, power output, and speed, and limited speed in both directions of operation, all in one single control lever which was installed in front of the engineer&#x27;s seat.

The locomotive proved to be powerful and capable, with reserves of power at speed and reasonable fuel economy. The turbine drive was easy on the track and allowed more power at the rail. During a test run officially arranged by PRR on 30 March 1945, S2 #6200 towing a dynamometer car was able to pull a 17-car train over a distance of 48 kilometers (level track) at a speed of between Fort Wayne and Chicago. Engineer Mr. Flaya Cartwright and Fireman Mr. M.E. Brown were assigned to this official test run. E.S. Cox, a British locomotive engineer, once traveled on the footplate and reported that &quot;100mph was maintained and exceeded for 12 consecutive minutes&quot;. While economical at speed, the locomotive was highly-uneconomical at lower speed. The turbine used less steam than conventional locomotives above , but below that the locomotive used too much steam and fuel. The boiler normally operated at , but at low speed the pressure could drop as low as . The increased fuel usage at low speeds caused the firebox to run hotter, which sometimes caused stay bolts to break.

The locomotive&#x27;s problems, the rapid decline of PRR&#x27;s ridership since 1947 and the advantages of the emerging diesel locomotive ensured that #6200 would never be duplicated, but S2 still participated in the 1948 Chicago Railroad Fair with a T1 4-4-4-4 Duplex Steam Locomotive. In August 1949, the locomotive suffered severe turbine damage. Since the maintenance costs rose steadily, the S2 was finally stored in Crestline and Altoona. In 1952, she was finally retired and was scrapped the following year.

==Service history==
The S2 was assigned to the Fort Wayne Division and based at the Crestline enginehouse. It hauled various prestigious passenger trains serving the New York to Chicago corridor such as The Broadway Limited, The Liberty Limited, The Trail Blazer, The General, The Manhattan Limited and The Golden Arrow on the route between Chicago and Crestline, Ohio (283 miles/ 446 km). S2 also hauled troop trains and was seen towing express freight trains. PRR S2 #6200, as an experimental prototype of a direct-drive steam turbine locomotive, ran 103,000 miles in total before it was completely withdrawn from service in August, 1949 and would soon await the scrapper&#x27;s torch. The 6200 was eventually scrapped in Conway, Pennsylvania.

== In popular culture ==
The model train company Lionel made several models of the S2. The first ones, 671 and 2020, were released in 1946 and were discontinued in 1949. The 681 turbine&#x27;s first production run was in 1950 and 1951. It was similar to both of the original turbine models but the 681 has Lionel&#x27;s Magne-Traction feature which makes the wheels magnetic. In 1952, The Korean War caused a shortage of magnetic material, so the 671 was reissued as the 671rr (671 rerun). The 681 returned the next year. In 1954 and 1955, another turbine, numbered 682, was released. The 682 was basically a 681 but with valve gear on the wheels and a white stripe painted on both sides.

<text>Mackie is an American professional audio products brand. Founded in Seattle in 1988 by Greg Mackie, a manufacturer of affordable and versatile compact pro audio mixers, Mackie is the primary product line of LOUD Technologies.

==History==
Mackie Designs, Inc. was founded in Woodinville, Washington by Greg Mackie, an ex-Boeing worker who began making pro audio gear and guitar amps in his spare time. After founding the small line mixer manufacturer TAPCO, and later the home audio processor manufacturer AudioControl, Mackie founded Mackie Designs, Inc., designing and manufacturing affordable and versatile compact pro audio mixers under the Mackie brand in his three bedroom condominium in Edmonds, Washington. Mackie&#x27;s first product was the LM-1602 line mixer, priced at $399.
Following the moderate sales success of the LM-1602, the company moved to a true factory in 1991 to produce and release its follow-up model, the CR-1604. With the flexibility to be used as either a desktop or rackmount mixer (a new concept at the time) combined with solid performance and competitive price, the CR-1604 was purchased for use in a wide variety of markets and applications. The CR-1604 became a tremendous success, selling hundreds of thousands of units by 1996 and accounting for over 48% of Mackie&#x27;s overall revenues at that time, and in 2004, it was inducted into the TECnology Hall of Fame, an honor given to &quot;products and innovations that have had an enduring impact on the development of audio technology.&quot;

During this time, Mackie remained squarely in the mixer category, introducing 8-Bus mixing consoles for multitrack recording and live sound production in 1993. Mackie took advantage of the Seattle area&#x27;s plentiful electronic and engineering subcontractors and utilized automated assembly machines to achieve high productivity and quality with lower overall production costs. At the time, the company was growing more than 100 percent annually, forcing Mackie to relocate and expand manufacturing every year, and by 1994 Mackie had grown into a 30,000 square-foot factory to accommodate over 250 employees and US$35.5 million in annual revenues.

In 1995 Mackie celebrated the milestone of having sold its 100,000th mixer and moved into a 90,000 square-foot factory. The company completed an initial public stock offering, and introduced the Ultra-mix Universal Automation System for 8-bus consoles at the AES Convention later that year.

By 1996, Mackie was diversifying, adding veteran industry designer Cal Perkins to the team and diversifying into power amps, powered mixers, and active studio monitors. In 1999, benefiting from Mackie Designs&#x27; acquisition of Radio Cine Forniture S.p.A., Mackie introduced the SRM450 powered loudspeaker, and by 2001, speakers accounted for 55% of Mackie sales.

Having made a host of pro audio gear, Mackie launched its first ever microphone on January 16, 2020, the Mackie EM91C (E standing for element) which spurned a host of other microphones. The EM91C was unique in that it was Mackie&#x27;s first attempt at a microphone, and its low price point in comparison to its user reviews and build quality. Subsequently, Mackie went on to make the EM91CU, a USB version, the EM89D (a cardiod dynamic handheld microphone) and the EM99b (a dynamic broadcast microphone).

==Name change==
In 2003, company management renamed Mackie Designs, Inc. as LOUD Technologies, Inc. (now known as LOUD Audio) to avoid confusion between the parent company and the Mackie brand.

== Acquisition ==
On December 4, 2023, Mackie was purchased by Røde Microphones.

== Known VLZ Series Technical Problems ==
In 2020, a post by user &quot;LincolnG&quot; on Gearspace.com (formerly Gearslutz.com) initiated an online conversation that revealed a design flaw in the Mackie&#x27;s Onyx chip used in the VLZ Series mixers. Others contributing to the conversation shared their experiences anecdotally and it was subsequently tested, verified, and documented, by &quot;LincolnG&quot; that the VLZ Series mixers do in fact have a design flaw that affects the stereo imagining. In the intervening years several others have verified the findings of &quot;LincolnG&quot;.

<text>Southern Virginia University (SVU) is a private liberal arts college in Buena Vista, Virginia. The college, though not officially affiliated with a particular faith, embraces the values of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). It was founded in 1867 as a school for girls and is now a private four-year coeducational institution. The Carnegie Classification categorizes it as a very small baccalaureate-only college with an arts &amp; sciences focus.

== History ==
The school was founded as a for-profit institution in 1867 during Virginia&#x27;s post-Civil War era when Alice Scott Chandler established the Home School for Girls in Bowling Green, Virginia, later renamed the Bowling Green Female Seminary. In 1883, Edgar H. Rowe purchased the school and operated it with Mrs. Chandler as principal. Dr. Rowe moved the school to Buena Vista in 1900, and changed its name to Southern Seminary. It was located in the splendid Buena Vista Hotel, which had been built 10 years earlier to accommodate the large numbers of land speculators investigating the town&#x27;s iron ore deposits. The iron boom was short-lived, however, and Rowe purchased the hotel. The original hotel still serves as Main Hall, the university&#x27;s principal building, and holds a place of distinction on the National Register of Historic Places, on which it is listed as the Southern Seminary Main Building.

In 1919, Robert Lee Durham, former dean of Martha Washington College (which merged with Emory &amp; Henry College), bought a half-interest in Southern Seminary and became the resident head of the school. An educator, lawyer, engineer, author and inventor, Durham strengthened the school&#x27;s academic program. In 1922, Durham&#x27;s daughter, Margaret, married H. Russell Robey, who purchased Rowe&#x27;s remaining interest in the school and became its business manager and treasurer. Durham and Robey added college-level courses to the school&#x27;s curriculum, and the first class of the new junior college program graduated in 1925. The period of greatest physical growth of the school, by then called Southern Seminary and Junior College, occurred during the presidency of Margaret Durham Robey, who succeeded her father upon his retirement in 1942. Facilities for art, early childhood education and home economics were added.

In 1959, the Robeys turned over the ownership of the college to a board of trustees and the institution changed from proprietary to nonprofit status. In 1961, the school ceased offering high school courses, and the name of the institution was changed to Southern Seminary Junior College. The academic program was expanded to allow students to begin careers after their two years at the school or to transfer to four-year colleges. &quot;Sem&quot; became a nationally recognized competitor in intercollegiate riding, winning numerous state, regional and national equestrian competitions. To avoid confusion, the name was again changed to Southern Virginia College for Women, which was shortened to Southern Virginia College in 1994 when male students were admitted.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s enrollment began to slip and the college became financially unstable, which led to a loss of regional accreditation in 1996.

In the spring of that year, Southern Virginia College&#x27;s board of trustees transferred the school&#x27;s assets and liabilities to a new board, many of whom were members of the LDS Church. The main figure in this reorganization was Glade Knight. In 2000 the school was accepted into pre-accreditation status by the American Academy for Liberal Education (AALE), which is separate from accreditation bodies, and was renamed Southern Virginia University in April 2001. In 2003 it was granted full accreditation by the AALE. In June 2010 the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools awarded initial candidacy to SVU. Two years later, in June 2012, the university received full regional accreditation.

On August 9, 2017, Southern Virginia University officially changed its school colors from green to crimson. On June 11, 2020, Southern Virginia University removed the name of Durham from its main academic building in the wake of the George Floyd protests, citing Durham&#x27;s racist views. In the interim before a new name is chosen, that building has been temporarily titled the Academic Center.

== Campus ==
SVU&#x27;s campus consists of twelve main buildings, including Main Hall (the most visible building on campus, used for administrative offices), the Kimball Student Center, the Knight Sports Arena, the Stoddard Center, the Von Canon Library, Landrum Hall, Robey Hall (men&#x27;s residence hall), Craton Hall (women&#x27;s residence hall), The Lofts (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s residence hall), Walnut Avenue Apartments (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s residence), Academic Center (the main academic building), and Chandler Hall (theatre and music). The campus area also includes several homes that are used for additional student housing and office space.

== Academics ==
SVU is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. SVU offers seventeen different majors and eighteen different minors. Other programs include Health Pre-Professionals, Army ROTC and Teaching Licensure.

==Student life==

===Religious activity===
LDS Church principles and activities are fully integrated into life and education at SVU. An LDS Church Institute of Religion is operated on campus. Once each semester, SVU cancels classes for a service day on which the local LDS stake organizes an optional trip to the Washington D.C. Temple, where students perform service on the temple grounds and participate in temple ordinances. Students are not required to enroll in religious classes.

=== Code of Honor ===
SVU has a code of honor, intended to help students live by its core values, which includes the following guidelines:

* Honesty in academic and personal behavior
* Living a chaste and virtuous lifestyle
* Abstinence from alcohol and tobacco
* Respect for the rights and property of others
* Obedience to law and university policies
* Observation of university dress and grooming standards

An ecclesiastical endorsement to live the code of honor is part of the application process. This consists of students signing a compact in conjunction with their respective ecclesiastical leader.

=== Performing arts ===
SVU offers several performing arts sections to its students, including its premier choir Chamber Singers, a women&#x27;s choir (Bella Voce), Men&#x27;s Chorus, opera workshop, and a contemporary a cappella group Accolade (formerly The Fading Point). There is also a university Dance Company, which performs many different styles of dance at different functions throughout the year, including jazz, ballet, hip-hop, lyrical, modern, Irish and other ethnic styles. Music programs consist of an orchestra and flute choir. The theatre program has performed &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank, The Sound of Music, The Importance of Being Earnest, Seeking Higher Ground,&quot; and &quot;Beauty and the Beast,&quot; among many others. Another option for participation in theatre is the Shenanigans Comedy Troupe, an improv comedy group.

== Athletics ==
Southern Virginia athletic teams are the Knights. The university is a member of the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the USA South Athletic Conference for most of its sports since the 2021–22 academic year; while its men&#x27;s volleyball team competes in the Continental Volleyball Conference (CVC) and it’s men’s wrestling team competes in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC). The Knights previously competed in the Capital Athletic Conference (CAC; now known as the Coast to Coast Athletic Conference (C2C) since the 2020–21 school year) from 2013–14 to 2020–21; as well as a provisional NCAA D-III Independent during the 2012–13 school year. They also competed in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) and United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA) from 1998–99 to 2012–13.

Southern Virginia athletes compete in 30 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, rugby, soccer, swimming, tennis, track &amp; field, volleyball, and wrestling; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track &amp; field, volleyball, and wrestling; and co-ed sports include cheerleading, dance and eSports.

=== History ===
SVU began its athletic program in the fall of 1997, one year after it became a four-year liberal arts college. In 1998, the Knights joined both the NAIA and the USCAA. The 2012–13 school year was SVU&#x27;s first year as a provisional NCAA Division III member; it joined the Capital Athletic Conference, now known as the Coast to Coast Athletic Conference, on July 1, 2013, and became eligible for conference championships in 2014–15. After four successful provisional years, the Knights became a full NCAA Division III member on September 1, 2016. On December 11, 2019, Southern Virginia announced it would join the USA South Athletic Conference, effective beginning in the 2021–22 academic year. Southern Virginia University officially joined USA South on July 1, 2021.

<text>Viljo Gabriel Revell (25 January 1910 – 8 November 1964) was a Finnish architect of the functionalist school. In Finland he is best known for the design of the Lasipalatsi (&quot;Glass Palace&quot;) and Palace Hotel, both in Helsinki. Internationally, Revell is best known for designing the New City Hall of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
==Life and career==
Revell, originally spelt &quot;Rewell&quot;, was born in Vaasa in 1910, and graduated from Vaasan Lyseo in 1928. He graduated as an architect from the Helsinki University of Technology in 1937. He made his architectural breakthrough already the year he graduated when he, together with fellow students Heimo Riihimäki and Niilo Kokko, won the architectural competition for the design of the Lasipalatsi, which had originally been intended as a temporary building comprising shops, restaurant and cinema, but which became one of the landmarks of Finnish &quot;white functionalist&quot; architecture. His next major work was the so-called Teollisuuskeskus (Industrial Centre), comprising offices, hotel (Palace Hotel), roof-terrace restaurant and ground-floor shops, situated on Helsinki&#x27;s south harbour seafront. The building was also based on a competition winning proposal, made together with architect Keijo Petäjä, and was completed in 1952 in time for the Helsinki Olympic Games. 

Revell&#x27;s international breakthrough came with winning the 1956–58 architectural competition for the design of the Toronto City Hall, which he designed together with fellow Finnish architects Heikki Castrén, Bengt Lundsten, and Seppo Valjus. Upon announcement of the winner of the architectural competition, Mayor Nathan Phillips called the design &quot;breath-taking&quot;. Construction of the City Hall began in 1961, and was completed in 1965, the year following Revell&#x27;s premature death. Revell had also commissioned that English sculptor Henry Moore to create a sculpture in keeping with the design – Three Way Piece No.2: Archer was installed in the public square in 1966 under controversy due to its cost. 

Revell married Maire Myntti in 1941; they had three daughters born in 1942, 1943 and 1945. As he had excellent stereoscopic eyesight, he served as naval artillery fire control officer in World War II, and he was one of the survivors of the sinking of the Finnish Navy flagship, the coastal defence ship &quot;Ilmarinen&quot; in 1941. 

In 1943, at a time when post-war reconstruction was already an important topic of discussion, Revell, along with Alvar Aalto, Aarne Ervi and Kaj Englund, was one of the instigators of the Finnish Building Information File (in Finnish: &quot;rakennustietokortisto&quot;), the Finnish version of a building standards file, to assist in standardization of building practices and component sizes. The work was financed by the Finnish Association of Architects, under the name of the Standardization Institute. As part of the research the group had contacts with a similar organisation in Germany, run by architect Ernst Neufert. In June 1943, while the war was still going on, Aalto, Ervi and Revell, together with architects Jussi Paatela and Esko Suhonen, travelled to Germany at the invitation of Neufert to witness the German building standardization efforts, including the construction of government buildings designed by Albert Speer for the Nazi government.

<doc id="1283839" wikidata="Q7799136" url="?curid=1283839" title="Thunderegg">
<text>A thunderegg (or thunder egg) is a nodule-like rock, similar to a filled geode, that is formed within rhyolitic volcanic ash layers.
Thundereggs are rough spheres, most about the size of a baseball—though they can range from a little more than a centimeter (one half inch) to over a meter (three feet) across. They usually contain centres of chalcedony which may have been fractured followed by deposition of agate, jasper or opal, either uniquely or in combination. Also frequently encountered are quartz and gypsum crystals, as well as various other mineral growths and inclusions. Thundereggs usually look like ordinary rocks on the outside, but slicing them in half and polishing them may reveal intricate patterns and colours. A characteristic feature of thundereggs is that (like other agates) the individual beds they come from can vary in appearance, though they can maintain a certain specific identity within them.

Thunderegg is not synonymous with either geode or agate. A geode is a simple term for a rock with a hollow in it, often with crystal formation/growth. A thunderegg on the other hand is a specific geological structure. A thunderegg may be referred to as a geode if it has a hollow in it, but not all geodes are thundereggs because there are many different ways for a hollow to form. Similarly, a thunderegg is just one of the forms that agate can assume.

==Occurrence==
Thundereggs are found globally where conditions are optimal. In the US, Oregon is one of the most famous thunderegg locations. Germany is also an important center for thunderegg agates (especially sites like St Egidien and Gehlberg). Other places known for thundereggs include Ethiopia, Poland, Romania, Turkey, Mexico, Argentina, Canada, Mount Hay and Tamborine Mountain (Australia), and the Esterel massif (France).

==Formation==
Thundereggs are found in flows of rhyolite lava. They form in the lava from the action of water percolating through the porous rock carrying silica in solution. The deposits lined and filled the cavity, first with a darker matrix material, then an inner core of agate or chalcedony. The various colors come from differences in the minerals found in the soil and rock that the water has moved through.

==State rock designation==
After an initiative by the Springfield Thunderegg Rock Club, on March 29, 1965, the thunderegg was designated as the Oregon state rock by a joint resolution of the Oregon Legislative Assembly. While thundereggs can be collected all over Oregon, the largest deposits are found in Crook, Jefferson, Malheur, Wasco and Wheeler counties. The world&#x27;s largest thunderegg, a 1.75 ton specimen, is housed by the Rice Northwest Museum of Rocks and Minerals in Hillsboro, Oregon.

==Legend==
Native American legend reportedly considers the rocks to be the eggs of the thunderbirds which occupied Mount Hood and Mount Jefferson. Thunder Spirits on the mountains hurled the &quot;eggs&quot; at each other.

<text>Santa Ana College is a public community college in Santa Ana, California.

==History==
In 1915, Santa Ana Junior College opened its doors to 25 students as a department of Santa Ana High School. It was the second community college founded in Orange County, behind Fullerton College, and the fourth oldest in all of California. In 1932, a charter of Gamma Sigma Fraternity International was granted. Beta Alpha Chapter was at the school from 1932 to 1938 but anti-fraternity agitation and lack of communication with the organization in the east made the chapter dormant by 1938. The 1933 Long Beach earthquake damaged the Santa Ana High School building, prompting the campus move to North Main Street where it remained until 1947. A bond issue passed in 1945, paving the way for development of a 48-acre (194,000 m2) campus at its current location. Santa Ana College plays host to Middle College High School, a small alternative high school in the Santa Ana Unified School District in which students can earn their Associate of Arts degree at the same time as their high school diploma. In the late 1970s the college purchased the properties on Martha Lane south of the original campus and that land is now part of the parking lot. Recent years have witnessed the further development of and annexation of adjacent property to the original location.

For a short time, the college was known as Rancho Santiago College, but the name changed back to Santa Ana College in the late 1990s.

In 1985, a satellite campus, what is now called Santiago Canyon College, was established in Orange, California. Santiago Canyon has since grown in size to become a separate college from Santa Ana College, although both colleges are part of the Rancho Santiago Community College District.

==Academics==
The college has various programs lead to the awarding of associate degrees in Arts and Sciences, as well as vocational certificates.

Santa Ana College is also home to the Tessmann Planetarium which was renovated and now has a state-of-the art planetarium system. It is the largest, both in diameter (30 ft) and seating capacity planetarium in the County of Orange CA. It was completed and became operational in 1967.

Santa Ana College is also home to &quot;Around and About Orange County News&quot; and &quot;Noticiero Latino del Condado de Orange&quot; (NLCO), student-produced weekly news shows. NLCO became the first Spanish language college newscast produced by a community college.

The TV Department uses the college&#x27;s Digital Media Center to produce, shoot, and edit the college&#x27;s newscast.

The Journalism &amp; Media Studies Department writes, edits, and publishes the college&#x27;s nationally recognized online and printed news called &quot;el Don.&quot;

==Athletics==
Santa Ana College sponsors 18 sports programs. The 9 men&#x27;s sports programs are baseball, basketball, cross country, football, soccer, swimming, track and field, water polo and wrestling. The 9 women&#x27;s programs are basketball, beach volleyball, cross country, soccer, softball, swimming, track and field, volleyball and water polo.

<doc id="1283859" wikidata="Q7460733" url="?curid=1283859" title="ShadowHawk (character)">
<text>ShadowHawk is a superhero created by Jim Valentino for Image Comics.

He was first advertised in the &quot;Malibu Sun&quot; free promotional magazine in May 1992. His official Image Comics debut was in the second issue of &quot;Youngblood&quot; series (June 1992), written and illustrated by Rob Liefeld.

Originally, the name ShadowHawk was to be used for the Marvel character Starhawk while he had darkness powers, but Tom DeFalco convinced Valentino to use the name for a new character instead.

==Paul Johnstone==
===Fictional character biography===
Paul Johnstone grew up as a troubled youth in Harlem, New York City. He avoided a life of crime due in part to the encouragement of a man named Richard Woodroe, who was originally assigned as a caseworker to Paul when he was caught stealing, and eventually married his mother, becoming his stepfather.

Eventually, Paul became a lawyer and, beyond that, a district attorney. While his life was going so well, his half brother Hojo had taken his success in college, moved to Wall Street and developed a Coke and crack addiction. Using Hojo, some gangsters tried to leverage Paul into letting their men off, but Paul refused. Soon after he ended up the target of an assault intended to serve as an example to others who got in the way of these mobsters. This incident culminated in his attackers injecting him with HIV-infected blood.

After the encounter, Johnstone was left uncertain regarding whether he had been infected or not. The attack had been made public and word of his possible infection spread through Johnstone&#x27;s workplace, making it a very inhospitable environment to be in. Tensions between Johnstone and one of his co-workers led to an altercation between the two which landed Johnstone out of a job and in jail.

After he was released, Paul received medical confirmation that he was HIV positive and he descended into depression. While walking the streets to clear his head, Paul was threatened by a group of young gang members. He went berserk and attacked them, leading to his brutal mugging and return to the hospital. During this time he resolved that he would use the rest of his time to dispense justice to the individuals who preyed on innocent victims. One of his friends, a cop named Christina Reid (who had been kicked off the force that day for use of excessive force), was also in the hospital and came to visit him. She informed Paul that she and a man named Carlton Sun had been developing an exoskeleton suit of armor that could help aid him in accomplishing this task.

Johnstone decided to don the suit, christening himself &quot;ShadowHawk&quot; after his favorite superhero (a name that would eventually lure out the psychotic and racist villain Hawk&#x27;s Shadow, who believed he was the one entitled to bear the mantle of ShadowHawk), and was taught how to fight effectively with the help of Christine, promising to &quot;take back the night&quot;. Johnstone also kept the pills needed to slow his reaction to his HIV infection in small pouches on his belt so he could take them as needed.

Early on, ShadowHawk&#x27;s actions against criminals were brutal. He would catch violent criminals in the act and break their spines, leaving them to be discovered by police with no indication that he had attacked them other than hearsay from the criminals and very obvious severe injuries. This led to ShadowHawk garnering a reputation as an urban legend as well as being hunted by both criminals and law enforcement alike. Johnstone would also face various supervillains, including crime-boss Vendetta, her gang the Regulators (Blackjack, Vort-X, Arson, Hardedge and Scandal), the acidic mutant Liquifier, super-powered hitman Dedline and the racist ShadowHawk copycat Hawk&#x27;s Shadow. ShadowHawk also encounters other superheroes such as Spawn and The Savage Dragon. ShadowHawk would later become a member of the superhero group Brigade.

Later in his career (and as his lifespan shortened due to the progression of HIV to AIDS), Johnstone eventually grew to be less violent. He encounters Trencher and his dispatcher Phoebe; who agrees to assist him in his search for a cure to his infection or another way to extend his life. This led to encounters with the likes of Youngblood&#x27;s Chapel (another hero also infected with HIV), Bloodstrike and ShadowHawk team-up with each other in the hopes of finding a cure. He then teams up with the WildC.A.T.s (who offered a possible solution involving a robotic body to transplant Johnstone&#x27;s consciousness into – which would ultimately fail to work). ShadowHawk then visited the Others (Guardd, Klone, Racket, Rebound) in a similar attempt, where they attempt to exorcise the spirit of the virus from his body, which ultimately fails. He is then transported into an encounter with Supreme (in which a battle would ensue, leading to the discovery of ShadowHawk&#x27;s true identity to the world), then encounters Badrock and company in another attempt at changing his body&#x27;s structure in order to live longer, again leaving in failure, and finally meeting Spawn in his alleyways who, with the help of Trencher and Phoebe, convince him to accept his inevitable death from the virus. One of his few regrets was that he never got to join a super-group, as in his search for a cure, he had realized how useful and fun fighting in a group was.

In his final act as ShadowHawk, Johnstone would rescue his mother from being attacked by Hawk&#x27;s Shadow. The aftermath of the fight would leave Johnstone in a weakened state and unable to elude the pursuit of the police. He was remanded into custody and transported to a hospital where AIDS eventually took its toll and ended his life.

==Edward Collins==
In the wake of Paul Johnstone&#x27;s death, it was revealed that ShadowHawk is in fact a &quot;Spirit of Justice&quot; and the spirit has inhabited at least four people in the past. Three of the revealed ShadowHawks were human, the last one being a robot. The three human ShadowHawks dealt with villains such as big game huntress Trophy, the toxic mutant Glortch, the mutant crime-boss Joe the Blowfish and the street gang of super-villains the Junkyard Dogz (Hotspur, Rumble Doll, Fast Lucy, Guncrazy and Needle). One of the ShadowHawks included Paul Johnstone&#x27;s accomplice, Christina Reid. Like Johnstone, the New ShadowHawks become members of Brigade.

After the Spirit of Justice leaves the robot it becomes &quot;Justice&quot;, without human feelings and starts to kill people. The saga of the robot ShadowHawk was told in a crossover story called &quot;ShadowHunt&quot;, which ran through five Image titles in April 1996. At the end of &quot;New Man&quot; #4, the robot was destroyed.

===The new ShadowHawk===
After the robot is destroyed, Eddie Collins, a young high school student, makes his debut as the new ShadowHawk. Having just moved to New York with his recently widowed father James, an electrician, Eddie was walking down a street when the helmet literally fell into his hands. The helmet – called &quot;Nommo&quot; – contains the spirits of all people who were, at one time, inhabited by ShadowHawk, the Spirit of Justice. Eddie Collins tried to meditate with the Nommo on, meeting the spirit of Paul Johnstone, who tells Eddie that he is a reincarnation of a first dynasty Egyptian shaman, how he was the prior ShadowHawk and that Eddie is destined to start anew.

At first Eddie&#x27;s father orders him to stop, thinking it would kill him. But Eddie is faster, stronger and more agile now and finds new responsibility to the people of New York City. After saving some hostages, Eddie meets Captain Nieves and starts working with him.

===Jim Valentino&#x27;s ShadowHawk===
Blacklight, a 1960s &quot;hippie hero&quot; wakes up from a 30-year coma and learns his wife Dayglo was killed 10 years ago by a villain called Firepower. He is falsely told by a mysterious man that ShadowHawk is the son of Firepower. Blacklight later attacks ShadowHawk and is accidentally killed by him. After killing Blacklight, ShadowHawk faces a mercenary named ZAP. After ZAP is defeated, police propose that Eddie Collins go through the Police Academy to learn the difference between superhero and vigilante. Eddie is attacked by the man who hired ZAP and lied to Blacklight, named Nocturn.

Out on patrol, Nocturn, who knows Eddie Collins is ShadowHawk, attacks him. After a brutal fight, Hawk&#x27;s Shadow comes out of the shadows to face his &quot;returned&quot; arch-enemy. After being beaten nearly to death, ShadowHawk faces Hawk&#x27;s Shadow, who wants the helmet that gives ShadowHawk his powers. In the end, Paul Johnstone usurps Eddie&#x27;s body and beats Hawk&#x27;s Shadow to near death, but Eddie stops him before the kill.

Soon, Eddie meets the new Blacklight, who is investigating the origin of her new-found powers. The two team-up to bring a vicious monster down. Their target turns out to be the first Blacklight.

Eddie&#x27;s mentally unstable classmate, Philip Marko discovers he has the power of pyrokinesis. After killing ten people at the high school and his mother, ShadowHawk stops him.

A man-beast named Komodo kills Eddie&#x27;s best friend, Steven &quot;Skeeve&quot; Evans and defeats ShadowHawk. The helmet, the source of ShadowHawk&#x27;s power, is taken by Hawk&#x27;s Shadow, who steps in and kills Komodo. He is soon confronted by his father, the Silver Age ShadowHawk. With the help of the new Blacklight, and Astroman, Eddie goes after Hatfield (Hawk&#x27;s Shadow) and wins, taking back the helmet.

After hearing the stories of past ShadowHawks, Eddie Collins makes the decision that now he is going to be ShadowHawk on his terms and receives a new costume.

Steven Evans&#x27; younger brother blames Shadowhawk for his brothers death and seeks revenge, while Hawk&#x27;s Shadow&#x27;s brain is placed in Komodo&#x27;s body.

==Silver Age ShadowHawk==
The Silver Age ShadowHawk is a parody of the Jack Schiff-era Silver Age Batman comics. He works out of the Shadowcave which is in the basement of his house, has a Shadowcar and a Shadowdog. His wife and son are his crimefighting partners, Lady ShadowHawkette and Squirrel. Squirrel went on to become Hawk&#x27;s Shadow.

&quot;The ShadowHawk Special&quot; (December 1994) featured two Silver Age ShadowHawk stories. In &quot;The Hyena&#x27;s Revenge&quot; ShadowHawk and Squirrel hunt the Hyena, a villain based on the Joker. The second was &quot;The Phantom Gorillas from Dimension-Z!&quot; The Silver Age ShadowHawk also appeared with the Silver Age Knight Watchman in &quot;Big Bang Comics&quot; #2.

The story &quot;Rising&quot; in issue #11 of &quot;Jim Valentino&#x27;s ShadowHawk&quot; described Hatfield Sr and his family&#x27;s final fight against the Hyena and the death of Lady ShadowHawkette.

==&quot;ShadowHawk: Resurrection&quot;==
Image Comics published a new &quot;ShadowHawk&quot; ongoing series following the events of &quot;Image United&quot;. The series featured Paul Johnstone, the original ShadowHawk, as wearing the helmet once again 15 years after his death. The story was written by Dan Wickline, and the art by Tone Rodriguez and Jim Valentino. The series also featured covers by Erik Larsen and Frank Bravo. Variant covers for &quot;ShadowHawk: Resurrection&quot; took homage from older issues of &quot;ShadowHawk&quot; titles and other notable covers throughout comic history. Notably, #3 featured a variant that was styled after the glow-in-the-dark cover for &quot;ShadowHawk&quot; (1st series) issue #3, while issue #5 featured a variant cover that paid homage to the &quot;Death of Supergirl&quot; cover of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; #7.

==&quot;Bomb Queen VII&quot;==
In &quot;Bomb Queen VII: The End of Hope&quot;, released from December 2011 to May 2012, after being killed by Rebound 100 years prior, Bomb Queen awakens in a techno-dependent future protected by ShadowHawk, who now inhabits the closest members of the human race to ongoing crimes, regularly switching between bodies. As their battle continues, despite their moral opposition, Bomb Queen gradually begins to fall in love with him.

==Toys==
Two action figures of ShadowHawk have been released in the past by McFarlane Toys.

In 2009, Shocker Toys released two ShadowHawk figures as part of the first series of its &quot;Indie Spotlight&quot; line.

<text>Henry Ives Cobb (August 19, 1859 – March 27, 1931) was an architect from the United States. Based in Chicago in the last decades of the 19th century, he was known for his designs in the Richardsonian Romanesque and Victorian Gothic styles.

==Biography==
Cobb was born in Brookline, Massachusetts to Albert Adams and Mary Russell Candler Cobb. Cobb studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for one year then transferred to Harvard University where he graduated in 1881 with an engineering degree. After graduating, Cobb worked at the Boston architectural firm Peabody &amp; Stearns before moving to Chicago in 1882. 

In Chicago, Cobb partnered with Charles Sumner Frost and formed Cobb and Frost. They designed the Palmer Mansion (demolished) on Lake Shore Drive; the Chicago Varnish Company Building—listed on the National Register of Historic Places and as a Chicago Landmark; the Episcopal Church of the Atonement at 5749 North Kenmore Avenue—also on the National Register of Historic Places; the Chicago Federal Building (demolished); the Newberry Library; the Fisheries Building (demolished) at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition; and many pre-1900 buildings at Lake Forest College and the University of Chicago. Elsewhere, he designed the Sinclair Oil Building (today the Liberty Tower), a Perpendicular-style skyscraper in downtown Manhattan, that was converted to residences in 1980; the Olive Building in St. Louis and co-designed the King Edward Hotel in Toronto. Cobb moved to Washington, D.C., in 1897 to escape the Chicago grime, which damaged his cherished art collection. Cobb is responsible for The University of Chicago Yerkes Observatory in Williams Bay, WI, constructed from 1895 to 1897, with its Greco-Roman terra-cotta architectural detail.

==Family==
Henry Ives Cobb&#x27;s grandmother, Augusta Adams Cobb, controversially abandoned her husband, Henry Cobb, and five of her seven children in 1843, and married Brigham Young as a plural wife.

Cobb and wife Emma Martin Smith had 10 children, seven of whom survived into adulthood. The children were: architect and author Henry Ives Cobb, Jr. (1883–1974), Cleveland Cobb (1884–?), Leonore Cobb (1885–?), Candler Cobb (c. 1887–?), Elliot Cobb (1888–?), Priscilla Cobb (1890–91), Alice Cobb (1892–93), Boughton Cobb (1894–1974), Russell Cobb (1897–?), and Emerson Cobb, (1902–10).

<doc id="1283865" wikidata="Q2246553" url="?curid=1283865" title="Hyperbolic triangle">
<text>In hyperbolic geometry, a hyperbolic triangle is a triangle in the hyperbolic plane. It consists of three line segments called &quot;sides&quot; or &quot;edges&quot; and three points called &quot;angles&quot; or &quot;vertices&quot;.

Just as in the Euclidean case, three points of a hyperbolic space of an arbitrary dimension always lie on the same plane. Hence planar hyperbolic triangles also describe triangles possible in any higher dimension of hyperbolic spaces.
==Definition==
A hyperbolic triangle consists of three non-collinear points and the three segments between them.
==Properties==
Hyperbolic triangles have some properties that are analogous to those of triangles in Euclidean geometry:

*Each hyperbolic triangle has an inscribed circle but not every hyperbolic triangle has a circumscribed circle (see below). Its vertices can lie on a horocycle or hypercycle.
Hyperbolic triangles have some properties that are analogous to those of triangles in spherical or elliptic geometry:

*Two triangles with the same angle sum are equal in area.
*There is an upper bound for the area of triangles.
*There is an upper bound for radius of the inscribed circle.
*Two triangles are congruent if and only if they correspond under a finite product of line reflections.
*Two triangles with corresponding angles equal are congruent (i.e., all similar triangles are congruent).

Hyperbolic triangles have some properties that are the opposite of the properties of triangles in spherical or elliptic geometry:

*The angle sum of a triangle is less than 180°.
*The area of a triangle is proportional to the deficit of its angle sum from 180°.

Hyperbolic triangles also have some properties that are not found in other geometries:

*Some hyperbolic triangles have no circumscribed circle, this is the case when at least one of its vertices is an ideal point or when all of its vertices lie on a horocycle or on a one sided hypercycle.
*Hyperbolic triangles are thin, there is a maximum distance δ from a point on an edge to one of the other two edges. This principle gave rise to δ-hyperbolic space.

==Triangles with ideal vertices==

The definition of a triangle can be generalized, permitting vertices on the ideal boundary of the plane while keeping the sides within the plane. If a pair of sides is &quot;limiting parallel&quot; (i.e. the distance between them approaches zero as they tend to the ideal point, but they do not intersect), then they end at an ideal vertex represented as an &quot;omega point&quot;.

Such a pair of sides may also be said to form an angle of zero.

A triangle with a zero angle is impossible in Euclidean geometry for straight sides lying on distinct lines. However, such zero angles are possible with tangent circles.

A triangle with one ideal vertex is called an omega triangle.

Special Triangles with ideal vertices are:

===Triangle of parallelism===
A triangle where one vertex is an ideal point, one angle is right: the third angle is the angle of parallelism for the length of the side between the right and the third angle.

===Schweikart triangle===
The triangle where two vertices are ideal points and the remaining angle is right, one of the first hyperbolic triangles (1818) described by Ferdinand Karl Schweikart.

===Ideal triangle===

The triangle where all vertices are ideal points, an ideal triangle is the largest possible triangle in hyperbolic geometry because of the zero sum of the angles.

==Standardized Gaussian curvature==
The relations among the angles and sides are analogous to those of spherical trigonometry; the length scale for both spherical geometry and hyperbolic geometry can for example be defined as the length of a side of an equilateral triangle with fixed angles.

The length scale is most convenient if the lengths are measured in terms of the absolute length (a special unit of length analogous to a relations between distances in spherical geometry). This choice for this length scale makes formulas simpler.

In terms of the Poincaré half-plane model absolute length corresponds to the infinitesimal metric formula_1 and in the Poincaré disk model to formula_2.

In terms of the (constant and negative) Gaussian curvature of a hyperbolic plane, a unit of absolute length corresponds to a length of
:formula_3.

In a hyperbolic triangle the sum of the angles &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; (respectively opposite to the side with the corresponding letter) is strictly less than a straight angle. The difference between the measure of a straight angle and the sum of the measures of a triangle&#x27;s angles is called the defect of the triangle. The area of a hyperbolic triangle is equal to its defect multiplied by the square of :
:formula_4.

This theorem, first proven by Johann Heinrich Lambert, is related to Girard&#x27;s theorem in spherical geometry.

==Trigonometry==
In all the formulas stated below the sides , , and must be measured in absolute length, a unit so that the Gaussian curvature of the plane is −1. In other words, the quantity in the paragraph above is supposed to be equal to 1.

Trigonometric formulas for hyperbolic triangles depend on the hyperbolic functions sinh, cosh, and tanh.

===Trigonometry of right triangles===
If &quot;C&quot; is a right angle then:
*The sine of angle &quot;A&quot; is the hyperbolic sine of the side opposite the angle divided by the hyperbolic sine of the hypotenuse.
::formula_5

*The cosine of angle &quot;A&quot; is the hyperbolic tangent of the adjacent leg divided by the hyperbolic tangent of the hypotenuse.
::formula_6

*The tangent of angle &quot;A&quot; is the hyperbolic tangent of the opposite leg divided by the hyperbolic sine of the adjacent leg.
::formula_7.

*The hyperbolic cosine of the adjacent leg to angle A is the cosine of angle B divided by the sine of angle A.
::formula_8.

*The hyperbolic cosine of the hypotenuse is the product of the hyperbolic cosines of the legs.
::formula_9.

*The hyperbolic cosine of the hypotenuse is also the product of the cosines of the angles divided by the product of their sines.
::formula_10

====Relations between angles====
We also have the following equations:

:formula_11

:formula_12

:formula_13

:formula_14

:formula_15

====Area====
The area of a right angled triangle is:
:formula_16
also
:formula_17
The area for any other triangle is:
:formula_18

====Angle of parallelism====
The instance of an omega triangle with a right angle provides the configuration to examine the angle of parallelism in the triangle.

In this case angle &quot;B&quot; = 0, a = c = formula_19 and formula_20, resulting in formula_21.

====Equilateral triangle====
The trigonometry formulas of right triangles also give the relations between the sides &quot;s&quot; and the angles &quot;A&quot; of an equilateral triangle (a triangle where all sides have the same length and all angles are equal).

The relations are:

:formula_22

:formula_23

===General trigonometry===
Whether &quot;C&quot; is a right angle or not, the following relationships hold:
The hyperbolic law of cosines is as follows:
:formula_24

Its dual theorem is
:formula_25

There is also a &quot;law of sines&quot;:
:formula_26

and a four-parts formula:
:formula_27
which is derived in the same way as the analogous formula in spherical trigonometry.

<text>A Maxwell coil is a device for producing a large volume of almost constant (or constant-gradient) magnetic field. It is named in honour of the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell.

A Maxwell coil is an improvement of a Helmholtz coil: in operation it provides an even more uniform magnetic field (than a Helmholtz coil), but at the expense of more material and complexity.

== Description ==

A constant-field Maxwell coil set consists of three coils oriented on the surface of a virtual sphere. According to Maxwell&#x27;s original 1873 design: each of the outer coils should be of radius formula_1, and distance formula_2 from the plane of the central coil of radius formula_3. 

Maxwell specified the number of windings as 64 for the central coil and 49 for the outer coils. Though Maxwell did not specifically state that current for the coils came from the same source, his work was specifically describing the construction of a sensitive galvanometer designed to detect a single current source. It follows that the ampere-turns for each of the smaller coils must be exactly formula_4 of the turns of the larger.

== Gradient-field Maxwell coil ==
A gradient-field Maxwell coil has essentially the same geometry of the 3-coil configuration above, but the central coil is removed to leave only the smaller two coils, and the current in one of these is reversed. This produces a uniform-gradient magnetic field near the centre of the two coils. Maxwell describes the use of the 2-coil configuration for the generation of a uniform force on a small test coil. A Maxwell coil of this type is similar to a Helmholtz coil with the coil distance increased from coil radius formula_3 to formula_6 and the coils fed with opposite currents.

<text>Jennifer P. Dougherty (born April 13, 1961) was elected Frederick, Maryland&#x27;s first female mayor in 2001. Dougherty defeated 2-term incumbent Republican Mayor James S. Grimes.

Dougherty campaigned for re-election in 2005 but did not win the Democratic primary, losing to opponent Ron Young. Dougherty and Young both ran bitter, negative campaigns in which each attacked the other.

Dougherty was the Democratic nominee for Maryland&#x27;s 6th congressional district in 2008.

==Early life and education==
Dougherty graduated from Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School in Washington, D.C.. She later graduated from Mount Saint Mary&#x27;s University in 1983 with a BA in History, magna cum laude. While a student at The Mount, Dougherty was a 4-year varsity field hockey player. She is the only person in The Mount&#x27;s Athletic Hall of Fame honored for field hockey. Dougherty also wrote for The Mountain Echo, The Mount&#x27;s official campus-wide newspaper, for 4 years, serving as editor-in-chief in her senior year.

==Career==
Dougherty operated Jennifer&#x27;s Restaurant on West Patrick Street (opened 1987; closed 2008) and Dougherty&#x27;s Irish Shop (1999–2006). She also served on the Board of Directors of Heartly House, the Frederick County Chamber of Commerce President (1999), and the Rotary Club of Carroll Creek. More recently in December 2009, Dougherty and partner Bruce Rhoderick opened Magoo&#x27;s Pub and Eatery on West Second Street in Frederick.

==Congressional campaign==
On November 19, 2007, Dougherty filed to run for Maryland&#x27;s 6th congressional district. She won the primary and was the Democratic candidate for congress in 2008 against 8-term Republican Roscoe Bartlett. Bartlett defeated Dougherty in the general election.

==Subsequent mayoral campaigns==
Dougherty announced in 2009 that she would again seek the office of mayor of the City of Frederick, but lost in the primary to newcomer Jason Judd. Dougherty has remained visible in Frederick politics and has recently filed a bid for the 2017 mayoral election.

In 2013, Jennifer Dougherty announced that she was running for mayor of Frederick as an independent candidate. The election was held on November 5. Dougherty lost, garnering 19.43 percent of the vote to Democratic nominee Karen Young&#x27;s 31.59 percent and incumbent Republican Mayor Randy McClement&#x27;s 48.75 percent.

<text>Jacob Tonson, sometimes referred to as Jacob Tonson the Elder (12 November 1655 – 17 March 1736), was an eighteenth-century English bookseller and publisher.

Tonson published editions of John Dryden and John Milton, and is best known for having obtained a copyright on the plays of William Shakespeare by buying up the rights of the heirs of the publisher of the Fourth Folio after the Statute of Anne went into effect. He was also the founder of the famous Kit-Cat Club. His nephew, Jacob Tonson the Younger (1682–1735), was his business partner. The business was continued by the younger Tonson&#x27;s son, Jacob Tonson (1714–1767).

==History==
Scholars have not always been sure of Tonson&#x27;s birthdate, and it has in the past been listed as occurring in 1655 or 1656. But the register of christenings in the parish of St Andrew Holborn demonstrates that Tonson was born on 12 November 1655 and baptised on 18 November 1655. The register lists Tonson as the &quot;sonne of Jacob Tonson Shoemaker and of Elizabeth his wife neare Grayes Inn Lane.&quot; He is believed to have been related to Major Richard Tonson, who obtained a grant of land in county Cork from Charles II, and whose descendants became Barons Riversdale. His father&#x27;s will left him and his elder brother Richard, as well as three sisters, each £100, to be paid when they came of age. On 5 June 1670 Jacob was apprenticed to Thomas Basset, a stationer, for eight years. Having been admitted a freeman of the Company of Stationers on 20 December 1677, he began business on his own account, following his brother Richard, who had commenced in 1676, and had published, among other things, Thomas Otway&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlos, Prince of Spain&quot;. Richard Tonson had a shop within Gray&#x27;s Inn Gate; Jacob Tonson&#x27;s shop was for many years at the Judge&#x27;s Head in Chancery Lane, near Fleet Street.

It has been said that when Tonson bought the rights to &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; (1679), the first play of John Dryden&#x27;s that he published, he was obliged to borrow the purchase money (£20) from Abel Swalle, another bookseller. The names of both booksellers appear on the title-page, as was often the case at that time. Tonson was sufficiently well off to purchase plays by Otway and Nahum Tate. In 1681 the brothers Richard and Jacob joined in publishing Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Spanish Friar&quot;, and in 1683 Jacob obtained a valuable property by purchasing from Barbazon Ailmer, the assignee of Samuel Simmons, one half of his right in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. The other half was purchased at an advance in 1690. Tonson afterwards said he had made more by &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; than by any other poem.

In the earlier part of his life Tonson was much associated with Dryden. A step which did much to establish his position was the publication in 1684 of a volume of &quot;Miscellany Poems&quot;, under Dryden&#x27;s editorship. Other volumes followed in 1685, 1693, 1694, 1703, and 1708, and the collection, which was several times reprinted, is known as both as &quot;Dryden&#x27;s Miscellany&quot; and &quot;Tonson&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;. During the ensuing year Tonson continued to bring out pieces by Dryden, and on 6 October 1691 paid thirty guineas for all the author&#x27;s rights in the printing of the tragedy of &quot;Cleomenes&quot;. Joseph Addison&#x27;s &quot;Poem to his Majesty&quot; was published by Tonson in 1695, and there was some correspondence respecting a proposed joint translation of Herodotus by Boyle, Richard Blackmore, Addison, and others.

Dryden&#x27;s translation of Virgil, executed between 1693 and 1696, was published by Tonson in July 1697 by subscription. Serious financial differences arose between the poet and his publisher, and Dryden&#x27;s letters to Tonson (1695–1697) are full of complaints of meanness and sharp practice and of refusals to accept clipped or bad money. Tonson would pay nothing for notes; Dryden retorted, &quot;The notes and prefaces shall be short, because you shall get the more by saving paper.&quot; He added that all the trade were sharpers, Tonson not more than others. Dryden described Tonson thus, in lines written under his portrait, and afterwards printed in &quot;Faction Displayed&quot; (1705):

Subsequently the letters became more friendly, and on the publication of &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Feast&quot;, in late 1697, Dryden wrote to Tonson, &quot;I hope it has done you service, and will do more.&quot;

Dryden&#x27;s collection of translations from Boccaccio, Chaucer, and others, known as &quot;The Fables&quot;, was published by Tonson in November 1699; a second edition did not appear until 1713. There is an undated letter from Mrs. Aphra Behn to Tonson at Bayfordbury, thanking him warmly for what he had said on her behalf to Dryden. She begged hard for five pounds more than Tonson offered for some of her verses. In connection with Jeremy Collier&#x27;s attack on the stage, the Middlesex justices presented the playhouses in May 1698, and also William Congreve for writing the &quot;Double Dealer&quot;, Thomas d&#x27;Urfey for &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, and Tonson and Brisco, booksellers, for printing them. Tonson published Congreve&#x27;s reply to Collier, and at a later date &quot;The Faithful Friend&quot; and &quot;The Confederacy&quot; by his friend, Sir John Vanbrugh.

Before the end of the century Tonson had moved from the Judge&#x27;s Head to a shop in Gray&#x27;s Inn Gate, probably the one previously occupied by his brother Richard. It is not unlikely that Richard was dead, and that Jacob, who had no children, and seemingly never married, now took into partnership his 
nephew Jacob, whose son was afterwards to be his heir. It is not always easy to distinguish the uncle from the nephew in later years; the latter is sometimes referred to as Tonson Junior.

By 1700 Tonson&#x27;s position was well established, and about that time the Kit-Cat Club was founded, with Tonson as secretary. The meetings were first held at a mutton-pie shop in Shire Lane, kept by Christopher Cat, and may have begun with suppers given by Tonson to his literary friends. About 1703 Tonson purchased a house at Barn Elms, and built a room there for the club. In a poem on the club, attributed to Sir Richard Blackmore, we find:

Tonson was satirised in several skits, and it was falsely alleged that he had been expelled by the club, or had withdrawn from the society in scorn of being their jest any longer.

In 1703 Tonson went to the Dutch Republic to obtain paper and engravings for the fine edition of Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries&quot;, which was ultimately published under Samuel Clarke&#x27;s care in 1712. At Amsterdam and Rotterdam he met Addison, and assisted in some abortive negotiations for Addison&#x27;s employment as travelling companion to Lord Hertford, son of the Duke of Somerset. In 1705 Tonson published Addison&#x27;s &quot;Remarks on several Parts of Italy&quot;.

Verses by young Alexander Pope were circulating among the critics in 1705, and in April 1706 Tonson wrote to Pope proposing to publish a pastoral poem of his. Pope&#x27;s pastorals ultimately appeared in Tonson&#x27;s sixth &quot;Miscellany&quot; (May 1709). William Wycherley wrote that Tonson had long been gentleman-usher to the Muses: &quot;you will make Jacob&#x27;s ladder raise you to immortality.&quot;

Nicholas Rowe&#x27;s edition of Shakespeare, in six volumes, was published early in 1709 by Tonson, who had previously advertised for materials. Richard Steele dined at Tonson&#x27;s in 1708–1709, sometimes to get a bill discounted, sometimes to hear manuscripts read and advise upon them. There is a tradition that in earlier days Steele had had a daughter by a daughter of Tonson&#x27;s; if this is true, it must apparently have been a daughter of Richard Tonson, Jacob&#x27;s brother. In the autumn of 1710 Tonson moved to the Shakespeare&#x27;s Head, opposite Catherine Street in the Strand; his former shop at Gray&#x27;s Inn Gate was announced for sale in the &quot;Tatler&quot; for 14 October (No. 237); and it seems to have been taken by Thomas Osborne, stationer, the father of the afterwards well-known publisher, Thomas Osborne (died 1767). On 26 July 1711, after a long interval, Swift met Addison and Steele &quot;at young Jacob Tonson&#x27;s&quot;. &quot;The two Jacobs&quot;, says Jonathan Swift to Esther Johnson, &quot;think it I who have made the secretary take from them the printing of the Gazette, which they are going to lose... Jacob came to me t&#x27;other day to make his court; but I told him it was too late, and that it was not my doing.&quot; Accounts furnished to Steele by Tonson of the sale of the collective editions of the &quot;Tatler&quot; and &quot;Spectator&quot; have been preserved; from October 1712 Tonson&#x27;s name was joined with Samuel Buckley&#x27;s as publisher of the &quot;Spectator&quot;. In November 1712 Addison and Steele sold all their right and title in one half of the copies of the first seven volumes of the &quot;Spectator&quot; to Tonson the younger, for £575, and all rights in the other half for a similar sum to Buckley. Buckley in October 1714 reassigned his half-share in the &quot;Spectator&quot; to Tonson junior for £500.

Tonson published Addison&#x27;s tragedy, &quot;Cato&quot;, in April 1713; and, according to a concocted letter of Pope&#x27;s, the true reason why Steele brought the &quot;Guardian&quot; to an end in October was a quarrel with Tonson, its publisher; &quot;he stood engaged to his bookseller in articles of penalty for all the 
&quot;Guardians&quot;, and by desisting two days, and altering the title of the paper to that of the &quot;Englishman&quot;, was quit of the obligation, those papers being printed by Buckley.&quot; There are various reasons why this story is improbable; the truth seems to be that Steele was anxious to write on politics with a freer hand than was practicable in the &quot;Guardian&quot;. In the summer of 1714 we hear of Steele writing political pamphlets at Tonson&#x27;s, where there were three bottles of wine of Steele&#x27;s, and in October Tonson printed Steele&#x27;s &quot;Ladies&#x27; Library&quot;. Tonson appears in Rowe&#x27;s &quot;Dialogue between Tonson and Congreve, in imitation of Horace&quot;:

:Thou, Jacob Tonson, were, to my conceiving,
:The cheerfullest, best, honest fellow living.

In the same year Tonson, with Barnaby Bernard Lintot and William Taylor, was appointed one of the printers of the parliamentary votes. Next year he paid fifty guineas for the copyright of Addison&#x27;s comedy, &quot;The Drummer&quot;, and published Thomas Tickell&#x27;s translation of the first book of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, which gave offence to Pope. On 6 February 1718 Lintot entered into a partnership agreement with Tonson for the purchase of plays during eighteen months following that date.


In one of several amusing letters from Vanbrugh, now at Bayfordbury, Tonson, who was then in Paris, was congratulated upon his luck in South Sea stock, and there is other evidence that he made a large sum in connection with Law&#x27;s Mississippi scheme. &quot;He has got £40,000&quot; wrote Robert Arbuthnot; &quot;riches will make people forget their trade.&quot; In January 1720 Tonson obtained a grant to himself and his nephew of the office of stationer, bookseller, and printer to some of the principal public offices; and on 12 October 1722 he assigned the whole benefit of the grant to his nephew. The grant was afterwards renewed by Robert Walpole, in 1733, for a second term of forty years. The elder Tonson seems to have given up business about 1720. He had bought the Hazells estate at Ledbury, Herefordshire, and in 1721 he was sending presents of cider to the Dukes of Grafton and Newcastle, the latter of whom called Tonson &quot;my dear old friend,&quot; and asked him to give him his company in Sussex. Henceforth we may suppose, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that &quot;Tonson&quot; in contemporary allusions means the nephew.

Steele&#x27;s &quot;Conscious Lovers&quot; appeared in 1722, and Tonson assigned to Lintot half the copyright for £70. He had to apply to the court of chancery for an injunction to stop Robert Tooke and others printing a pirated edition of the play; the sum paid for the copyright was £40. In the same year Tonson published the Duke of Buckingham&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot;, and in 1725 Pope&#x27;s edition of Shakespeare.

Proposals were issued by Tonson in January 1729 for completing the subscription to the new edition of Rymer&#x27;s &quot;Fœdera&quot;, in seventeen folio volumes (of which fifteen were then printed), at fifty guineas the set. The work was finished in 1735. Tonson published a quarto edition of Waller&#x27;s works, edited by Fenton, in 1729, and an edition of Lord Lansdowne&#x27;s works in 1732. Pope was annoyed to find in 1731 that Tonson was to be one of the publishers of Lewis Theobald&#x27;s proposed edition of Shakespeare, in which he feared an attack on his own editorial work, but he professed to be satisfied with the assurances he received. In writing to the elder Tonson on this subject, Pope asked for any available information respecting the &quot;Man of Ross,&quot; and, in thanking 
him for the particulars received, explained his intention in singling out this man as the centre of a poem. Earlier in the year the elder Tonson was in town, and Pope, writing to Lord Oxford, said that if he would come to see him he would show him a phenomenon worth seeing, &quot;old Jacob Tonson, who is the perfect image and likeness of Bayle&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary&quot;; so full of matter, secret history, and wit and spirit, at almost fourscore.&quot; On 19 March Lord Oxford, Lord Bathurst, Pope, and Gay dined with old Tonson at Barnes and drank Swift&#x27;s health. In 1734 Samuel Gibbons was appointed stationer to the Prince of Wales in place of Jacob Tonson.

Jacob Tonson junior predeceased his uncle, dying on 25 November 1735, worth £100,000. His will, of great length, was written on 16 August and proved on 6 December 1735.

The elder Tonson&#x27;s death at Ledbury followed that of his nephew on 17 March 1735/6. The elder Tonson&#x27;s will was made on 2 December 1735 and proven in probate on 2 April 1736, when he was described as worth £40,000.

A painting of the elder Tonson by Godfrey Kneller is among the Kit-Cat portraits; it is best known through Faber&#x27;s engraving. Pope says that Tonson obtained portraits from Kneller without payment by flattering him and sending him presents of venison and wine. Dryden&#x27;s satirical account of his appearance has been quoted; Pope, in &quot;The Dunciad&quot; calls him &quot;left-legged Jacob&quot; and &quot;genial Jacob&quot;. John Dunton describes Tonson as &quot;a very good judge of persons and authors; and as there is nobody more competently qualified to give their opinion of another, so there is none who does it with a more severe exactness or with less partiality; for, to do Mr. Tonson justice, he speaks his mind upon all occasions, and will flatter nobody.&quot; No doubt this roughness of manner wore off as Tonson grew in prosperity.

== Jacob Tonson the younger ==
Jacob Tonson (died 1767) (Jacob Tonson the younger) was the great-nephew of the Jacob Tonson the elder and son of Jacob Tonson junior. He carried on the publishing business in the Strand. In 1747 he paid Warburton £500 for editing Shakespeare, and he was eulogised by Steevens [sic] in the advertisement prefixed to his edition of Shakespeare 1778: &quot;he never learned to consider the author as an under-agent to the bookseller . . . His manners were soft and his conversation delicate,&quot; but he reserved his acquaintance for a small number. Samuel Johnson spoke of him as &quot;the late amiable Mr. Tonson.&quot;

In 1750 he was High Sheriff of Surrey, and in 1759 he paid the fine for being excused serving the same office for the city of London and county of Middlesex. There is a story of his having twice helped Henry Fielding when that writer was unable to pay his taxes. Tonson died on 31 March 1767, without issue, in a house on the north side of the Strand, near Catherine Street, whither he had removed the business some years earlier. His will was made in 1763. In 1775 letters of administration of the goods of Jacob Tonson, left unadministered by Richard Tonson, were granted to William Baker, esq. (M.P. for Hertfordshire), and in 1823, Baker having failed to administer, letters of administration were granted to Joseph Rogers.

==Richard Tonson==
Richard Tonson (died 1772), the third Jacob Tonson&#x27;s brother, who took little part in the concerns of the business, lived at Water Oakley, near Windsor, where he built a room for the Kit-Cat portraits. His benevolence and hospitality made him popular, and in 1747 he was elected MP for Wallingford, and in 1768 MP for New Windsor. In some correspondence with the Duke of Newcastle in 1767, the duke spoke of his old friendship with Richard Tonson, &quot;the heir of one I honoured and loved, and have passed many most agreeable hours with.&quot; Richard Tonson died on 9 October 1772.

Besides the papers at Bayfordbury, there is a considerable collection of Tonson papers in the British Museum, some relating to business and some to private matters; but many of them are damaged or fragmentary.

<text>Chapman University is a private research university in Orange, California, United States. Encompassing eleven colleges, the university is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;. The school maintains its founding affiliations with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and the United Church of Christ, but is a secular university.

==History==


Founded in Woodland, California as Hesperian College, the school began classes on March 4, 1861. Its opening was timed to coincide with the hour of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s first inauguration. Hesperian admitted students regardless of sex or race. Throughout its first decades, the school was renamed and relocated several times. In 1896, Hesperian merged with Pierce Christian College to form the Berkeley Bible Seminary in Berkeley, California. The college was subsequently moved to San Francisco as the California Bible College. In 1920, the school was acquired by California Christian College, and moved to southern California, becoming the California School of Christianity, in Los Angeles. In 1923, the school was once again retitled the California Christian College. 

In 1934, the school became Chapman College after the chairman of its board of trustees (and primary benefactor), C. C. Chapman. In 1954, Chapman University permanently relocated to its present campus in the city of Orange, the former site of Orange High School. Chapman established a Residence Education Center Program to serve military personnel in 1958, which evolved into Brandman University and later University of Massachusetts Global. The college became Chapman University in 1991. In the same year, James L. Doti became president of the school, the Department of Education became the School of Education (now known as the Donna Ford Attallah College of Educational Studies), and what is now known as the Wilkinson College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences was established. The School of Film and Television, now the Dodge College of Film and Media Arts at Marion Knott Studios, opened in 1996. 

Between 2000 and 2010, Chapman University expanded to include the Rodgers Center for Holocaust Education, Leatherby Libraries, Fish Interfaith Center, the Erin J. Anderson Athletics Complex, the Schmid College of Science and Technology, and the Argyros School&#x27;s Economic Science Institute led by Vernon L. Smith. The Rinker Health Science Campus opened in Irvine, CA in 2013, becoming the home for the School of Pharmacy. Mathematician Daniele C. Struppa became President in 2016. In the same year, the Musco Center for the Arts opened. The 1,110-seat concert hall hosts professional and student performances, drawing over 30,000 visitors annually.

The Keck Center for Science and Engineering opened in 2018, with the Dale E. and Sarah Ann Fowler School of Engineering opening shortly after. Between 2018 and 2022, Chapman University earned a Carnegie Classification of R2: Doctoral University – High Research Activity, had its first Rhodes Scholar, Vidal Arroyo &#x27;19, and became nationally ranked by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. On September 29, 2023, it was announced that a $10m gift from the Argyros family would elevate the Argyros School to the Argyros College of Business and Economics.

In 2019, President Daniele C. Struppa refused to take down two The Birth of a Nation posters at the Dodge College of Film and Media Arts. Struppa outlined his reasons in an opinion piece called, &quot;Why I won&#x27;t take down the original &#x27;The Birth of a Nation&#x27; poster.&quot; Black students at Chapman voiced opposition to Struppa&#x27;s decision, and peaceful protests were organized on campus. Faculty members took a survey on their stance to remove the posters, and the posters were eventually taken down.

On December 10, 2024, it was announced that Matt Parlow was chosen serve as Chapman’s 14th president, effective September 2, 2025, following the planned retirement of President Struppa.

<doc id="1283893" wikidata="Q1306513" url="?curid=1283893" title="San Agustin Church (Manila)">
<text>The Archdiocesan Shrine of Our Lady of Consolation and Cincture, also known as the Church of Saint Augustine and Immaculate Conception Parish, is a Roman Catholic church under the auspices of the Order of Saint Augustine located inside the historic walled city of Intramuros in Manila, Philippines. Completed in 1607, it is the oldest stone church in the country.

In 1993, San Agustin Church was one of four Philippine churches constructed during the Spanish colonial period to be designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, under the collective title &quot;Baroque Churches of the Philippines&quot;. It was named a National Historical Landmark by the Philippine government in 1976.

==History==
San Agustin Church is located in General Luna St., Manila. The present structure is actually the third Augustinian church erected on the site. The first San Agustin Church was the first religious structure constructed by the Spaniards on the island of Luzon. Made of bamboo and nipa, it was completed in 1571, but destroyed by fire in December 1574 during the attempted invasion of Manila by the forces of Limahong. A second wooden structure built on the same site was destroyed in February 1583 by a fire that started when a candle ignited drapery on the funeral bier during services for Spanish Governor-General Gonzalo Ronquillo de Peñalosa.

The Augustinians decided to rebuild the church using stone, and to construct an adjacent monastery. Construction began in 1586, based on a design by Juan Macías. The structure was built using hewn adobe stones quarried from Meycauayan, Binangonan and San Mateo, Rizal. The work proceeded slowly due to the lack of funds and materials, as well as the relative scarcity of stone artisans. The monastery was operational by 1604, and the church was formally declared complete on January 19, 1607, and named Church of St. Paul of Manila. Macías, who had died before the completion of the church, was officially acknowledged by the Augustinians as the builder of the edifice.

San Agustin Church was sacked during the Battle of Manila, which occurred as part of the Seven Years&#x27; War. In 1854, the church was renovated under the supervision of Spanish architect Luciano Oliver. On June 3, 1863, the strongest earthquake at that time hit Manila leaving widespread destruction to the city, with San Agustin Church the only public building left undamaged. A series of strong earthquakes struck Manila again on July 18–20, 1880. This time, the tremors left a large crack in the east bell tower. The crack was eventually repaired, but the left tower was permanently removed with only the base remaining today. The church withstood the other major earthquakes that struck Manila before in 1645, 1699, 1754, 1796, 1825, 1852, 1863 and 1880 and served as a hospital for several of those injured during the earthquake in 1863.

On August 18, 1898, the church was the site where Spanish Governor-General Fermin Jaudenes prepared the terms for the surrender of Manila to the United States of America following the Spanish–American War.

On the night of August 13, 1932, a major fire inside Intramuros destroyed a portion of the adjacent San Agustin Monastery. The blaze also totally destroyed the Augustinian Provincial House across the road in Calle Real, as well as the ornate pedestrian bridge that once linked the Provincial House with the monastery.

===World War II===
During the Japanese occupation during the Second World War, San Agustin Church became a concentration camp. The Japanese troops removed the lower portion of the right front door of the church and placed sandbags on the resulting opening, turning the entrance into a makeshift machine gun post. In the final days of the Battle of Manila, hundreds of Intramuros residents and clergy were held hostage in the church by Japanese soldiers with many hostages killed during the three-week-long battle. It was the only one among seven churches of Intramuros to survive a leveling by combined American and Filipino ground forces in May 1945. While the church sustained damage to its roof, the adjacent monastery was completely destroyed. In the 1970s, the monastery was rebuilt as a museum under the design of architect Angel Nakpil. The church was renovated in 2013, with its colorful facade replaced by a sedate stone-colored one.

===Post-WWII era===
On September 4, 2000, the image of Our Lady of Consolation was canonically crowned with a decree of canonical coronation by Pope John Paul II. The Church launched its first pilgrim image of Our Lady of Consolation on May 1, 2023, to promote the devotion to Our Lady.

San Agustin Church and its adjacent convent, , served as the provincial house and headquarters of the Augustinian Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines of Spain ever since the province&#x27;s founding in 1575 until 1901, when it transferred to Madrid. It once again became the headquarters of the Province in 1927, during the tenure of Fr. Gaudencio Castrillo, until just after the Second World War.

San Agustin Church is currently administered by the Augustinian friars of the Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines.

On August 15 2024, the Manila City Council passed an ordinance formally declaring Nuestra Señora de la Consolación y Correa as the patroness of Intramuros, Manila.

== Architecture ==

San Agustin Church is patterned after some of the magnificent temples built by the Augustinians in Mexico. The present edifice was built in 1587, and completed, together with the monastery, in 1604. The atmosphere is medieval since &quot;both church and monastery symbolize the majesty and equilibrium of a Spanish golden era&quot;.

The massive structure of the church is highlighted by the symmetry and splendor of the interiors (painted by two Italians who succeeded in producing trompe-l&#x27;œil) – the profile of the mouldings, rosettes and sunken panels which appear as three-dimensional carvings, a baroque pulpit with the native pineapple as a motif, the grand pipe organ, the ante-choir with a 16th-century crucifix, the choir seats carved in molave with ivory inlays of the 17th century and the set of 16 huge chandeliers from Paris.

A 2022 online study conducted by home services website Angi found out that the church is the &quot;most beautiful building in the Philippines&quot;.

==Famous burials==

The church, as in its custom in its heyday, contained niches for burials of bones and remains. The following are notable burials within the premises of the church.
*Miguel López de Legazpi 
*Juan de Salcedo
*Guido de Lavezaris
*Juan Luna
*Blessed Pedro Zuñiga
*Francisco Alonso Liongson
*Benito Natividad
*Teodoro Agoncillo
*Chit Estella
*Maria Orosa
== Heritage threats ==
Although about away from San Agustin Church, the Binondo–Intramuros Bridge (which opened in 2022) is believed to have encroached on the buffer zone prescribed for church, which includes the walls of Intramuros and the immediate areas outside. However, the national government argues that the bridge will have no direct physical or visual impact to the San Agustin Church, owing to its remote distance and the number of taller structures between the bridge and the church.

So far, the World Heritage Convention (WHC) has identified several potential indirect and long-term impacts to the church. WHC noted that the church could be impacted by more ground vibration due to vehicular traffic, and air and noise pollution. Moreover, the bridge would have a direct visual impact on the overall setting and sense of place of the property, including Intramuros&#x27; fortified wall, as well as the Maestranza strip and Plaza México, the visual corridor of the Pasig River, and the underlying remains of . To mitigate the situation, it was recommended to the national government to reconsider the bridge&#x27;s and location, convert the surrounding roads of the church into pedestrian areas, conduct structural assessment of the church, and adapt the design of the bridge to the character of Intramuros.

San Agustin Church was collectively declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993, together with Paoay Church in Ilocos Norte, Santa Maria Church in Ilocos Sur, and Miag-ao Church in Iloilo. In April 2019, before the bridge construction, the National Commission for Culture and the Arts allayed fears that the three other churches will also be removed from the World Heritage Site list if San Agustin Church is delisted.

<text>Bartholomew Henry &quot;Bart&quot; Allen II is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. A speedster, he first appeared under the alias Impulse and later became the second [[Kid Flash]] and the fourth [[Flash (comics)|Flash]]. Created by Mark Waid and Mike Wieringo, Bart first made a cameo in &quot;The Flash&quot; (vol. 2) #91 in 1994 before his full debut in issue #92. He has since been featured as the lead character in &quot;Impulse&quot; (1995–2002) and &quot;The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive&quot; (2006–2007). Bart also appears in the series &quot;Young Justice&quot; and &quot;Teen Titans&quot; as a member of both superhero teams.

As first conceived by writers, Bart was born in the 30th century to Meloni Thawne and Don Allen, and is part of a complex family tree of superheroes and supervillains. His father, Don, is one of the Tornado Twins and his paternal grandfather is Barry Allen, the second Flash. His paternal grandmother, Iris West, is also the adoptive aunt of the third Flash, Wally West (Bart&#x27;s first cousin once removed). Additionally, Bart is the first cousin of XS, a Legionnaire and daughter of Dawn Allen. On his mother&#x27;s side, he is a descendant of supervillains Professor Zoom and Cobalt Blue as well as the half-brother of Owen Mercer, the second Captain Boomerang. In addition to these relatives, he had a supervillain clone known as Inertia.

For most of his superhero career, Bart was the teenage sidekick to Wally West. After West&#x27;s apparent death in the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; crossover event in 2006, Allen grew up and became the Flash. His tenure as the Flash was brief and concluded with his death in issue 13 of &quot;The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive&quot;. Allen was subsequently absent for nearly two years after his apparent death, but resurfaced—young again—as Kid Flash, in 2009&#x27;s &quot;Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds&quot;. During DC&#x27;s &quot;The New 52&quot; era, Bart Allen was reintroduced in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; as the alias of an amnesiac revolutionary from the future named Bar Torr; the character was later written out of comics, and his tenure erased from continuity by the subsequent DC Rebirth initiative. The original Bart Allen was brought back as part of DC Rebirth&#x27;s &quot;Wonder Comics Young Justice&quot; series.

Outside of comics, Bart has been portrayed by Kyle Gallner in the live-action television series &quot;Smallville&quot;. Jason Marsden voiced the character in the animated series &quot;Young Justice&quot;. Jordan Fisher portrays a variation of the character as the future son of Barry Allen and Iris West-Allen starting in the seventh season of The CW Arrowverse television series &quot;The Flash&quot; as a recurring character.

==Fictional character biography==
===Initial reference===
As depicted in a Legion of Super-Heroes story, Barry Allen&#x27;s children—the Tornado Twins—were arrested in A.D. 2995 by the government of Earth, which had fallen under the covert control of the Dominators. Following a one-day trial on trumped-up charges of treason, the Twins were executed. According to a &quot;Daily Planet&quot; news report, Don Allen is survived by his wife Carmen Johnson (whose real name was Meloni Thawne), his mother Iris West Allen, and his two-year-old son Barry Allen II. This timeline was wiped out by the events of &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot; miniseries.

===Impulse===

In post-&quot;Zero Hour&quot; continuity, Bart Allen is the son of Don Allen and Meloni Thawne (a descendant of Eobard Thawne). He is additionally the cousin of Jenni Ognats, also known as XS.

Due to his Speed Force abilities, Bart undergoes rapid aging, causing him to appear to be twelve when he is only two years old. He is raised in a virtual reality world and eventually brought to the past, where Wally West cures him. Because he spent most his childhood in a simulated world, Bart has no concept of danger and is prone to reckless behavior. He is placed into the custody of Max Mercury and moves to Manchester, Alabama.

Bart joins the Titans early in his career before becoming a founding member of Young Justice alongside Robin and Superboy. During this time, he develops the ability to generate energy clones.

Following Mercury&#x27;s disappearance, Bart is adopted by Jay Garrick, the first Flash, and his wife Joan. After Young Justice disbands, Bart joins some of his former teammates in the Teen Titans.

===Kid Flash===

Shortly after Bart joins the Teen Titans, he is shot in the knee by a Jericho-possessed Deathstroke and receives a prosthetic.

===&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;===
In &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Superboy-Prime attacks Superboy and the Teen Titans. After Prime escapes prison, Bart follows him, spends four years in an alternate universe, and temporarily gains amnesia. After returning to the main universe, Bart claims to have used all of his speed, leaving him powerless.

===&quot;The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive&quot; (2006–2009)===

Bart retains his powers, but keeps them secret. When his roommate Griffin Grey gains superpowers and becomes Griffin, Bart becomes the Flash, moves to Los Angeles, and begins studying forensics. During this time, he is considered for membership in the Justice League.

=== Death and return ===
In &quot;The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive&quot; #13, Bart is killed in battle with the Rogues. Writer Marc Guggenheim stated that Bart&#x27;s death was an editorial mandate.

In &quot;Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds&quot;, Brainiac 5 and the Legion of Super-Heroes resurrect Bart and Superboy to help them defeat Superboy-Prime and the Legion of Super-Villains.

===The Flash: Rebirth===
In &quot;The Flash: Rebirth&quot;, Bart discovers that Barry Allen was resurrected during his time in the Speed Force, having been killed years prior during &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. Barry is transformed into the Black Flash due to Professor Zoom altering the Speed Force. The JLA and JSA work together to contain Barry in a machine that will sever his connection to the Speed Force. However, Barry destroys the machine and escapes.

When Zoom attacks Jay and Iris. Bart and Jay rush to the scene and battle him. During the battle, Max Mercury suddenly returns from the Speed Force to assists them. Afterward, Iris West becomes the new Impulse.

===Blackest Night===
In &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Bart becomes a Black Lantern due to having previously died. However, he is freed when Barry Allen becomes a Blue Lantern and cures him.

===Return to Titans===
Sometime after &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Cyborg recruits Bart and Superboy to rescue Static, who has been kidnapped while visiting his hometown of Dakota. Bart battles the villain Holocaust and creates a vortex that sucks him into the Earth&#x27;s core.

At the behest of Tim Drake, Bart travels to Gotham City and saves Catwoman from members of the League of Assassins while she is sleeping in her apartment. After knocking out the would-be killers, Bart remarks to Tim over the radio that Selina is &quot;super-fine&quot;, and that this may be the best day of his life.

Shortly after settling back in Titans Tower, Bart reveals to Conner that during his brief stay in the future, he went through records concerning technology from the era. He also tells Conner that he is losing his memories of this future information due to the time stream being corrected, and that he is writing down everything he can remember.

===Flashpoint===
When Iris West Allen calls Barry home, she, Jay Garrick, Wally West, and Bart Allen are all troubled by the way that he has been isolating himself from everyone. Bart believes that Barry dislikes him and runs off until he is attacked by Hot Pursuit. Barry arrives too late, when Hot Pursuit discharges electricity at Bart with his baton and is engulfed in lightning. However, Hot Pursuit mistakenly believes that Bart is not one of the anomalies that are affecting the timeline, known as the &quot;Flashpoint&quot;.

The Earth is a changed alternate timeline, where Bart Allen wakes up in the 31st century in Brainiac&#x27;s stasis pod chamber and has lost his super-speed. After failing to avoid being re-captured by Brainiac, he is confronted by a female Hot Pursuit and with her help, pulls away from Brainiac. This Hot Pursuit reveals herself to be Patty Spivot, Barry Allen&#x27;s assistant. Bart must find a way to get his super-speed back before being erased from existence. Bart learns that Patty stole Hot Pursuit&#x27;s motorcycle and has taken his place. Bart allows himself to be recaptured by Brainiac and is placed into a stasis pod, destroying Brainiac&#x27;s security program from the inside. Patty holds of Brainiac and breaks an energy projector, which returns Bart&#x27;s super-speed to him. Bart then runs through time to the 21st century, and promises Patty he will return and rescue her. However, Bart&#x27;s body was transforming into Black Flash that had been controlled by the Speed Force, taking him to reduce the speedsters Max Mercury, Jay Garrick, and Wally West. Bart reversed from Black Flash and runs into Barry, when he realizes that the Speed Force is encased for him. Bart is to be absorbed into the living embodiment of the Speed Force&#x27;s light that gives Barry his power and tells him to save the world.

===DC Rebirth===

Prior to Bart Allen&#x27;s reappearance, the &quot;Titans Tomorrow&quot; alternate-future version of Bart Allen reappears in the 2018 crossover storyline “Super-Sons of Tomorrow”. A shattered figure of Bart Allen wearing his Impulse costume is also seen in the Flash Museum in the 25th century.

The original Bart Allen returns to the main DC universe after Wally West and Barry Allen break the Force Barrier. Once again wearing the Impulse costume, he emerges from the Speed Force and races through a city street triumphantly declaring that he is back.

Shortly afterward, he reunites with his former Young Justice and Teen Titans teammates Robin (Tim Drake) and Wonder Girl (Cassandra Sandsmark). Bart is the main driving force behind the revival of the Young Justice team; after being transported to Gemworld and reunited with Superboy (Kon-El), the team officially re-forms.

In &quot;The New Golden Age&quot;, Jay Garrick allows Judy Garrick to bunk in Bart&#x27;s room while he is away with Max Mercury. He later attended a party that was held by the Flash family.

==Powers and abilities==
Bart&#x27;s primary power is speed, along with abilities that are common to comics speedsters, such as creating whirlwinds, running on water, and vibrating through matter. The latter ability results in &quot;molecular taffy&quot; if Bart does not concentrate; he also possesses an aura, that prevents air friction while running. Bart does possess some abilities that other speedsters do not have. He has the ability to produce &quot;scouts&quot;, Speed Force avatars that he can send through the timestream, but has used it infrequently since the death of one avatar put him in a coma during the &quot;Our Worlds at War&quot; storyline that crossed over among the &quot;Impulse&quot;, &quot;Superboy&quot;, and &quot;Young Justice&quot; titles. After being forced to use it during the &quot;World Without Young Justice&quot; crossover event, he was able and willing to use them with ease, up until he became Kid Flash. He has been shown to move faster than light as Impulse, while now he has an artificial knee which limits his speed as Kid Flash. He now can only travel close to the speed of light.

Bart is resistant to the alterations in the time stream. His parents met only in post-&quot;Zero Hour&quot; continuity, but he arrived before the event. Bart has the ability to recall everything he has ever read, heard or watched (which includes speed-reading every book in the San Francisco Public Library), allowing him to spout encyclopedic information concerning the situation at hand as well as quotations from Mark Twain, of whose work he is fond. He has also displayed the ability to create powerful radio waves by rotating his arms at high speeds and using the resulting vibrations in conjunction with his teammate Static&#x27;s abilities.

After &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Bart&#x27;s connection to the Speed Force is more difficult to control because he now contains the Speed Force and, in essence, is the Speed Force. When he taps into the Speed Force, Bart appears to have electricity crackling around him, and the Speed Force inside him becomes so lethal that he initially wears the Flash suit while running to prevent it from killing him. After remembering his experiences on an alternate Earth during a fight with Griffin, he began to gain a measure of control over the Speed Force before it was released from his body just prior to his death.

==Flash legacy==
Since his first appearance in &quot;The Flash&quot; #91, Bart had been trained by several speed-endowed heroes such as Jay Garrick, Johnny Quick, and Max Mercury. Prior to his reluctance to don the red and yellow, Bart showed a lot of enthusiasm toward his role as the future Flash. However, Wally West had a number of apprehensions about Bart, as shown by Wally&#x27;s naming Jesse Quick as his successor and his refusal to deliver to Bart his invitation from Cyborg to join the latest incarnation of the Teen Titans. Bart took these acts in stride though, and, after Robin claimed that he will always live in the Flash&#x27;s shadow, Bart even says that &quot;the Flash will be in mine&quot;.

==Other versions==
Numerous versions of Bart have appeared throughout comics.

===Bar Torr===

Bar Torr, a character based on Bart Allen, appears in &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot. He is a reactionary from a dystopian planet Altros Prime in the far future who was sent to the 21st century as part of a witness protection program and sustained amnesia.

===Dark Tomorrow===
Following the death of Max Mercury and Helen Claiborne, Bart returns to the future to be with his mother, while his girlfriend Carol Bucklen came along. Carol begins studying the Speed Force to use it for the benefit of humanity. The corrupt President Thawne, Bart&#x27;s grandfather, takes their research and forms the Hyperguard, a group of soldiers with superhuman speed. The adult Carol managed to pull her younger self and Bart into the future. Bart ended up preventing Max&#x27;s and Helen&#x27;s death, thus preventing this reality from happening. This reality appeared in &quot;Impulse&quot; #73–75.

===Titans Tomorrow===
In an alternate timeline depicted in &quot;Titans Tomorrow&quot;, Bart assumes the mantle of the Flash after the current Flash is killed.

===Time and Tempest===
Another alternate future is showcased in &quot;The Ray&quot; (vol. 2) #25–26. Here Bart, Ray Terrill, and Triumph were &quot;three rich guys with superpowers&quot;. Bart was in love with Ray&#x27;s girlfriend, whom Ray treated like dirt. However, Bart realized that he did not have a chance with her either and ended up knocking Ray out and leaving him, not knowing that hitmen were on their way.

<text>The Mỹ Đình National Stadium () is a multi-purpose stadium in Nam Từ Liêm district, Hanoi, Vietnam. It has a capacity of 40.192 seats and is the centerpiece of Vietnam&#x27;s National Sports Complex. It was officially opened in September 2003 and was the main venue for the Southeast Asian Games later that year, hosting the opening and closing ceremony as well as the men&#x27;s football and athletics events.

The stadium is home to the Vietnam national football team, and hosts its home international matches.

Located 10 kilometres north-west of central Hanoi, the 40,192-seat stadium is the second biggest in the country in terms of capacity and was built at a cost of US$53 million. Arched roofs cover the grandstands on the east and west sides of the arena, providing shelter for half of the seats. The area provides training facilities for the teams with two football training grounds located next to the stadium. 

Since 2021, the stadium has attracted complaints mainly about the quality of the pitch, starting with its hosting of the Vietnam–Australia match in the third AFC qualification round of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. It has since come under further scrutiny after hosting Borussia Dortmund in an international friendly, of which the goalpost was broken mid-game, and Southeast Asian teams in the 2022 AFF Championship.

==History==
Ideas for a new national stadium in Vietnam were marked up in 1998 as the government conducted a prefeasibility study for a national sports complex. In July 2000, Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Văn Khải approved a project of a stadium at the heart of Vietnam&#x27;s National Sports Complex in preparation for hosting the 2003 Southeast Asian Games. Four firms, namely Hanoi International Group (HISG - China), Philipp Holzmann (Germany), Bouygues (France), and Lemna-Keystone (United States), participated in the bidding of the stadium&#x27;s construction. The process was controversial due to violations of technical and financial requirements in HISG and Holzmann&#x27;s bids, corruption allegations involving a French donation, and the intransparency in the panel&#x27;s decision making. In the end, HISG won the bid and signed a commitment contract on August 14, 2001.

Construction on the stadium started in 2002. During the development phase, the stadium was referred to as &quot;Sân vận động Trung tâm&quot; (&quot;central stadium&quot;). The stadium was architecturally complete in June 2003. In August 2003, the stadium was officially named &quot;Mỹ Đình National Stadium&quot;, taking after the name of the commune area the stadium is located within. It was inaugurated on September 2, 2003, to coincide with Vietnam&#x27;s National Day.

==Interior==
===Stands===
Mỹ Đình has 4 stands. The A &amp; B stands (or east and west stands, respectively) are covered each by an arched roof weighing 2,300 tonnes. These two stands have two tiers and are tall while the C &amp; D stands (or south and north stands) are single-tiered and tall. In total, the stadium has a capacity of 40,192 seats, including 450 VIP seats and 160 seats for journalists.

===Field===
The playing grass field has a size of 105m x 67m, surrounded by an 8-lane athletics track and other athletics facilities.

==Events==

It hosted the 2003 Southeast Asian Games (opening ceremony, football and athletics, closing ceremony), 2003 ASEAN Para Games.

The Hanoi football club was scheduled to play at the stadium, but later backed out of their agreement, citing the embarrassment of using an 40,000+ seat venue for games that routinely draw only slightly more than 5,000.

In July 2007, Mỹ Đình Stadium hosted the Group B of 2007 AFC Asian Cup along with Quân khu 7 Stadium (Ho Chi Minh City), quarter-final match (Japan vs Australia) and semi-final match (Japan vs Saudi Arabia).

* On 30 November 2022, the stadium held an international friendly match between Vietnam and Borussia Dortmund, which saw a shock host win of 2-1 after a controversial second goal in the last minutes of the match.
* 2023–24 AFC Champions League (Hanoi FC selected this stadium as its own Hàng Đẫy Stadium did not meet AFC&#x27;s criteria).

== Controversies ==

=== 2010 fireworks explosion ===
At approximately 11:40 local time on October 6, 2010, an explosion occurred at the stadium. The cause was confirmed to be the ignition of two firework containers due to negligence in the installation of their detonation position; this was a rehearsal for a programme commemorating the millennial anniversary of the establishment of Thăng Long (present-day Hanoi), which was scheduled to be held on October 10. The explosion killed four people and injured three.

=== Deteriorating pitch quality and equipment ===

==== 2021 and SEA Games 31 ====
Since the second half of 2021, criticism had been raised regarding the quality of the pitch and facilities at the stadium. In September 2021, the Vietnamese national team hosted Australia in the third round of the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers; Australian media and fans at the time compared the Mỹ Đình pitch to a &quot;cow pasture&quot;. According to the &quot;Lao Động&quot; newspaper, the stadium&#x27;s turf had not been renovated for nearly a decade. In addition, some areas of the stadium had fallen into disrepair due to lack of maintenance. At the request of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), the stadium was renovated by the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism ahead of hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers and the 2021 Southeast Asian Games. Ahead of the 2021 SEA Games, the Vietnamese government granted more than to the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism to repair the stadium alongside the wider National Sports Complex. However, the replacement of the turf was not carried out. Up until the third-place match and the final of the men&#x27;s football event at the 2021 SEA Games, the turf had been damaged due to the installation of the stage for the opening ceremony. 

==== Vietnam–Borussia Dortmund friendly match incident ====
On November 30, 2022, in a friendly match between Vietnam and Borussia Dortmund, in the 86th minute of the match, the crossbar of the Dortmund goal was knocked out, causing the match to be interrupted for 5 minutes. In addition, during the half-time break, the technical area of the two teams and the referee&#x27;s area were blown over many times by the wind. 

==== 2022 AFF Cup ====
Criticism of the stadium&#x27;s condition continued throughout 2022 and 2023. Ahead of the 2022 AFF Cup, the Vietnam Football Federation (VFF) signed a contract with the National Sports Complex to rent Mỹ Đình as the home stadium of the Vietnamese national team. The rental fee for each match of the Vietnamese national team is , the highest in the venue&#x27;s history. However, the stadium&#x27;s turf was described as old, faded, and poor, while not all of its seats had been replaced since their initial installation in 2003. According to the Hanoi Tax Department, the National Sports Complex owed in taxes as of 2023.

According to the Director General of the General Department of Physical Education and Sports, Đặng Hà Việt, maintenance and care work had been carried out regularly in the past month, but the city&#x27;s weather conditions had made the stadium&#x27;s pitch not as green as expected. Moreover, the AFC had assessed that the Mỹ Đình pitch is still in good condition for competition. However, the claim that the pitch&#x27;s deterioration was due to weather conditions was considered baseless, as the pitch was described to be of good quality when the Vietnamese national team hosted China in the third round of the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in early 2023.

On January 4, 2023, Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính commented on the condition of the stadium, questioning the claim that it was not being exploited. In an effort to address the deteriorating condition ahead of the Vietnam–Indonesia match on January 9, the Vietnamese Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism Nguyễn Văn Hùng on January 6 requested the Rector of Bắc Ninh University of Physical Education to organize a volunteer activity in which its students would clean up the stadium.

<text>Andrés Rivero Agüero (4 February 1905 – 8 November 1996) was a Cuban politician who served as the 12th Prime Minister of Cuba and was elected president of Cuba in the 1958 Cuban presidential election.

== Early life and education ==
Rivero was born to extremely poor parents in San Luis, Oriente Province (now Santiago de Cuba Province) on 4 February 1905. He taught himself to read when he was 16. Rivero managed to secure a high school education by his own efforts, and obtained a law degree from Havana University (1934).

==Political career==
Elected a city councilman in Santiago de Cuba, he quickly became a leader of the Liberal Party, and was befriended by Fulgencio Batista. During Batista&#x27;s first administration (1940–1944), Rivero served as Minister of Agriculture, and implemented Batista&#x27;s plan for resettling landless peasants in Oriente Province.

During General Batista&#x27;s exile in the United States from 1944–1952, Rivero practised law in Cuba and wrote political commentary for several periodicals. When Batista returned to run for President of Cuba in 1952, Rivero helped to organise Batista&#x27;s United Action Party. He supported Batista&#x27;s military coup on 10 March 1952, and thereafter served as Minister of Education (1952-1955) in Batista&#x27;s second administration (1952–1959). Elected a Senator from Pinar del Río Province in 1954, Rivero became Cuba&#x27;s prime minister (1957–1958), and participated in several reconciliation conferences as Batista&#x27;s representative.

Rivero resigned his premiership in 1958 to run for President of Cuba. He received the support of Batista&#x27;s Progressive Action Party, and three other pro-government parties. Rivero was declared the winner of the elections, which were speculated by many to have been rigged with the support of the United States government in an effort to repel the ongoing Cuban Revolution. After the election, Rivero entered into conversations with U.S. Ambassador Earl E. T. Smith, and with leading Cuban politicians, to resolve the crisis caused by the ongoing rebellion led by Fidel Castro. He apparently wished to convene a Constituent Assembly shortly after taking office, to bring about a restoration of constitutional rule. However, the success of the revolution frustrated Rivero&#x27;s plans, and he fled with General Batista into exile in the Dominican Republic on 1 January 1959.

==Later life==
Rivero eventually settled in the United States, living in extremely modest circumstances. He lived to be a great-grandfather. Rivero died in Miami, Florida in 1996.
