<text>Night sweats or nocturnal hyperhidrosis is the repeated occurrence of excessive sweating during sleep. The person may or may not also perspire excessively while awake.

One of the most common causes of night sweats in women over 40 is the hormonal changes related to menopause and perimenopause. This is a very common occurrence during the menopausal transition years. Over 80% of women experience hot flashes, which may include excessive sweating, during menopause.

Night sweats range from being relatively harmless to a sign of underlying disease. Night sweats may happen because the sleep environment is too warm, either because the bedroom is unusually hot or because there are too many covers on the bed. Night sweats have been associated with a long list of clinical conditions. However, there is very little evidence that supports clinical recommendations for this condition.

*Cancers
**Lymphoma

<text>Friedrich Julius Stahl (16 January 1802 – 10 August 1861) was a German constitutional lawyer, political philosopher and politician.

==Biography==
Born at Würzburg in the Prince-Bishopric of Würzburg, of Jewish parentage, as Julius Jolson, he was brought up strictly in the Jewish religion and was allowed to attend the Gymnasium. As a result of its influence, he at the age of 17 converted to Christianity and was baptized in the Lutheran Church at Erlangen on November 6, 1819. To his new faith, he clung with earnest devotion and persistence until his death. Having studied law at Würzburg, Heidelberg and Erlangen, Stahl, he on taking the degree of &quot;doctor juris&quot; established himself as &quot;Privatdozent&quot; in Munich, was appointed in 1832 ordinary professor of law at Würzburg and received in 1840.the chair of ecclesiastical law and polity at Berlin.

There, he immediately made his mark as an ecclesiastical lawyer, and hé was appointed a member of the first chamber of the general synod. Elected in 1850 a member of the short-lived Erfurt Parliament, he bitterly opposed the idea of German federation. Stahl early fell under the influence of Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling and, at the latter&#x27;s insistence, began in 1827 his great work &quot;Die Philosophie des Rechts nach geschichtlicher Ansicht&quot;, a historical view of the philosophy of law. The second definitive edition of that work, published in 1845, was entitled &quot;Rechts- und Staatslehre auf der Grundlage christlicher Weltanschauung&quot; (&quot;The Philosophy of Law and State on the Basis of the Christian Worldview&quot;). It is sometimes claimed that in that work he bases all law and political science upon Christian revelation, but that is a serious misunderstanding of his position. As he put it in Book 1 of that work, &quot;Christian revelation is indifferent to [the civil order]. This revelation provides regulations governing man’s behavior in relation to the existing order, but it does not give instructions about the formation of this order. No divine image of the civil order is given, because the way it is, is not of God&quot;. He advocated a confessional Christian state and the establishment of the Christian Church.

That position was further elucidated in his &quot;Der christliche Staat und sein Verhältniss zum Deismus und Judenthum&quot; (The Christian State and Its Relation to Deism and Judaism; 1847). As &quot;Oberkirchenrath&quot; (synodal councillor), Stahl used all his influence to weaken the Prussian Union of Churches, the compromise between the Calvinist and the Lutheran doctrines that is the essence of the Evangelical Church in Prussia) and to strengthen the influence of the Lutheran Church (&quot;Die Lutherische Kirche und die Union&quot;, 1859). Stahl advocated the formation of an episcopal constitution of the Lutherans similar to that of the Roman Catholics or the Anglicans.

The Prussian minister von Bunsen attacked Stahl, but King Frederick William IV supported Stahl in his ecclesiastical policy, and the Prussian Union would probably have been dissolved if the regency of Prince William (afterwards William I, German Emperor) had not come in 1858. Stahl&#x27;s influence fell under the new régime, and he remained remaining a member of the Prussian House of Lords (&quot;Herrenhaus&quot;), but he resigned his seat on the general synod.

While taking a cure, he unexpectedly died at Bad Brückenau.

== Academic work ==

In 1827 Stahl habilitated in Munich &quot;on the older Roman right of action&quot; and received a private lecturer position there. In the winter semester of 1827/28 he began lectures on Roman law and the philosophy of law. For unknown reasons, his father Valentin Stahl had lost most of his fortune; after the death of his parents (1829/1830), Julius Stahl had to look after his seven younger siblings. He applied in vain for a paid lecturer position.

In order to counteract the liberal &quot;Bayerisches Volksblatt&quot; published in Würzburg by Gottfried Eisenmann, the Bavarian government founded the official magazine &quot;Der Thron- und Volksfreund&quot; in 1830 and appointed Stahl as its editor. Even at this time, his thinking and his journalistic and political activities were anti-rationalistic and anti-revolutionary and fully corresponded to King Ludwig I&#x27;s monarchical principle . But the &quot;Volksfreund&quot; was no match for the &quot;Volksblatt&quot; and was discontinued after just a few months and only eight issues.

After several applications were rejected by Ludwig I, despite the support of Minister Eduard von Schenk, Stahl was finally appointed associate professor in Erlangen by decree of June 27, 1832. But before the beginning of the winter semester 1832/33 he was transferred to Würzburg and appointed full professor for legal philosophy, pandects and Bavarian state law, which he was not at all happy about: his subjects did not quite correspond to his wishes and he could not feel comfortable in the Catholic-dominated environment. Nonetheless, he twice turned down a call by the Hessian Minister Ludwig Hassenpflug to the University of Marburg because he felt committed to Bavaria. In 1834 Stahl returned to the University of Erlangen, where he taught canon law, constitutional law and philosophy of law, and in 1835 married Julie Kindler,  daughter of a glove manufacturer from Erlangen; the marriage remained childless. Under the influence of Christian Krafft and Erlangen theology, Stahl finally developed into a typical representative of Lutheran orthodoxy, and in 1837 the University of Erlangen elected him as its deputy to the second chamber of the Bavarian state parliament, where he advocated better equipment for the universities, organized a faction-like group to represent Protestant interests and, in the budget debate, was willing to compromise with the government on the matter, but defended the constitutional rights of the state parliament in principle until the chamber majority and eventually joined Minister Wallerstein. As a result, King Ludwig I dismissed the minister and reprimanded Stahl by withdrawing his professorship for constitutional law and transferring him to civil procedural law, which was alien to him. Stahl therefore rejected re-election to the state parliament, used the calm thus gained to work out his work on the church constitution and was now - although his Erlangen colleagues appointed him pro-rector in 1839.

In 1840 Stahl was appointed professor of legal philosophy, constitutional law and canon law in Berlin. At the request of Friedrich Wilhelm IV, he was to fight &quot;rationalist&quot; Hegelianism at the university. During his inaugural lecture on November 26, Stahl announced this intention and caused a scandal. Treitschke calls the reception &quot;vulgar&quot;.  In his diaries, Varnhagen van Ense describes the &quot;shuffling and hissing of the students&quot; as the &quot;first opposition to the new government.&quot; Stahl called out to the protesting students: &quot;Gentlemen, I am here to teach, you to listen, you may judge at home, but do not disturb the order and tranquility here!&quot;  As early as 1841, Stahl was in the adjudication board of the law faculty, in which he prepared expert opinions on constitutional and canonical cases. As a professor, he gathered conservative students around him and, when he was dean and rector, influenced the appointments to chairs in conservative interests. In a report by the law faculty, he spoke out against the admission of Jews as lecturers. Stahl also formulated the rejection of the invitation to a meeting of university teachers in September of the revolutionary year 1848 because he was against recognition by the Frankfurt central government. From the winter semester of 1850/51 he held public lectures on &quot;the current parties in state and church&quot;, to which high officials and officers, and even ministers, also came.

== Political activity ==
Although Stahl&#x27;s activity within the university was already politically significant, this was by no means enough for his political ambitions. After 1848 a petition by the associate professors and private lecturers at the University of Berlin demanded the dismissal of e.g. Stahls had also demanded, he left Berlin in a hurry, but soon returned to promote the founding of a conservative newspaper and the organization of the later Conservative Party together with Ernst Ludwig von Gerlach. Stahl was one of the shareholders and employees of the &quot;Neue Preußische Zeitung&quot; founded in mid-1848. His article &quot;The Banner of the Conservatives&quot;  printed in it on July 20, 1848 was an abridged version of his writing &quot;Das monarchisches Princip&quot; from 1845, but updated and specified: From Friedrich Wilhelm IV&#x27;s proclamation of March 18, he led a further development of the Prussian constitutional reality by the king. Other articles by Stahl followed at short intervals, until in September he began to concentrate on building a party organization. His &quot;Draft for a Conservative Party&quot;, written in February and March 1849, in which he outlined the guidelines for future Conservative policy, became the basis for the Conservative program that was eventually printed.

However, Stahl could not commit the entire Conservative Party to this program; so he became - again at the side of Ludwig von Gerlach - spokesman only for the extreme parliamentary right (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Gerlach-Stahl Group&quot;). Elected to the first chamber for the district of Oberbarnim in 1849, he nevertheless succeeded in winning over the &quot;high conservatives&quot; of the &quot;Kreuzzeitung Party&quot; to accept the program in principle, although they were striving to have it revised. Eventually, in 1854, Stahl became one of the members of the mansion appointed for life by the king, and thus the chief spokesman for the chivalric faction, to which he remained loyal to the end.

In the state house of the Erfurt union parliament in 1850 he acted against the plan for a Kleindeutsch solution to the national question under Prussian leadership because he did not want to have done anything against the Habsburgs, in whom he still saw a legitimate candidate for the imperial crown. The failure of Union policy as a result of the Olomouc punctuation was just fine with him; thus the understanding in the Holy Alliance with Austria and Russia was restored. Out of this spirit he also campaigned for Prussian neutrality in the Crimean War in 1854, as Bunsen and other partisans of England urged Frederick William IV to intervene. The king had promised in 1840: &quot;I will keep peace in my time&quot; and kept this now. Prussia had deliberately remained neutral, and Stahl justified this in a speech before the first chamber as &quot;the conclusion of a policy based on a higher principle&quot;.  In 1854 Stahl also became Prussian Crown Counsel and a member of the State Council.

In the ecclesiastical field, too, Stahl used his position as a member of the old Prussian Evangelical Higher Church Council (1852–1858) to loosen the union, to strengthen Lutheran confessionalism (New Lutheranism) and to renew the rule of the clergy over the lay world. He was a member of the Prussian General Synod in 1846 and (alongside August von Bethmann-Hollweg ) Vice-President of the German Evangelical Church Congress from 1848 to 1861 and a member of the Central Committee for the Inner Mission in Prussia.  It may be due to the influence of Catholicism during his time in Würzburg, when he was fascinated by the authoritarian elements of the hierarchical church constitution, that Stahl demanded that the validity of the Lutheran confession as the supreme norm of all church life be ensured with the help of a largely independent Episcopalian church organization.  The office of bishop was finally introduced in the EKD after 1945.

The political upheaval as a result of the king&#x27;s illness and the rebellion of Prince Regent Wilhelm and the fall of the Manteuffel ministry also ended Stahl&#x27;s work in the Oberkirchenrat and led to his resignation from the authority in 1858. However, he continued the political struggle against the Ministry of the Liberal Era in the Herrenhaus, but did not live to see its political turnaround.

== State doctrine ==
At the end of the 1820s, Stahl was in a difficult, crisis-ridden situation in Munich: not only materially - he had to earn a living for himself and his siblings - he was also in distress mentally, as he explained in December 1829 in the preface to the writes the first edition of the &quot;Philosophy of Law&quot;, which is so important to him that he adopts it in its entirety in later editions.  Dissatisfied with Hegel&#x27;s teaching, he felt the misery of philosophy in being unable to provide an ethical basis for the law he had to teach. Eventually he found that the history of the philosophy of law showed him the way in its development, and that Schelling&#x27;s thinking was confirmed and strengthened. However, Stahl did not see himself as a disciple of Schelling.

A second figure he could draw on was Savigny, the father of the historical school of law.  He recognized the right thing intuitively, but others needed a legal philosophy as a theoretical basis. This had been neglected, and Stahl wanted to set himself the task of justifying the views of the historical school of law theoretically, namely in terms of ethics,  without following the natural law doctrine of the Enlightenment.  Rather, he wanted to base himself on the traditional Christian views  - and above all with his work to give &quot;rationalism an eternal monument (i.e. gravestone).&quot;

Stahl begins the introduction to his main work with the succinct definition: &quot;Legal philosophy is the science of the just.&quot;  Since previous attempts cannot go unnoticed, the first volume of the genesis of legal philosophy is dedicated. &quot;The historical course, the real nature of people is the judgment on the motives of all philosophy, and thus on philosophy itself. Science, like the saint in the legend &quot;(Christophorus)&quot;, must seek the strongest lord...With every system, the question is not so much which institutions it declares to be just, what is just for it and where it gets its knowledge from.&quot; Beginning with the Greeks, through the Middle Ages and the theory of natural law, Stahl finally reaches the pragmatic (Machiavelli and Montesquieu) and speculative (Hegel and Schelling) to the &quot;writers of the counter-revolution&quot; and to historical legal philosophy.

The second volume of the &quot;Philosophy of Law&quot; was published in 1833, i.e. after the July Revolution of 1830. The experience of the revolution was formative for Stahl. He absolutely rejected the revolution and was convinced that everything could be done to prevent it, to prevent it. The revolution for Stahl already begins with rationalism, with the fact that man is no longer satisfied with knowing God about himself, but wants to set standards himself, using his reason. And if you let rationalism run its course, Stahl believed, it would inevitably lead to permanent revolution, because since God is supposed to have been overthrown, you are not satisfied with a constitution, nor with the overthrow of the monarch and the establishment of a republic. Rather, property will finally be abolished and all the foundations of order in society will be eliminated, including the freedom of the individual and human dignity - there will be &quot;hell on earth&quot;.

Like the revolution in a negative sense, religion shaped Stahl in a positive sense. He grew up religiously in the house of the head of a Jewish community. But this religiosity was soon no longer enough for him. Thiersch&#x27;s influence was decisive for him at high school. The Lutheran Protestant from the environment of the President of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences, Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, convinced him, and Stahl converted to Lutheranism. Later, as a professor in Würzburg, which was completely dominated by Catholicism, Stahl suffered from it and became insecure. It was only Krafft&#x27;s theology in Erlangen that strengthened him again and formed him into an orthodox Lutheran. Was he a pietist? Stahl denied this, as he understood Pietism as apolitical, whereas he was political.

In principle, Stahl professed to be a follower of the historical school of law, in that he did not accuse her and Savigny of errors, but only the lack of an ethical foundation through a legal philosophy that he himself tried to create. Namely by the fact that he saw what had grown historically as the result of God&#x27;s rule and based it on God&#x27;s will as the standard for the good. Law should have the divine commandments as a basis. On this basis, he explained that law should continue to be developed organically and historically in the spirit of God. State and church are institutions created by men, but they should serve a greater purpose. In the state, a &quot;moral kingdom&quot; was to be established, not identical with the eternal &quot;kingdom of God&quot;, but in time, in history, the preliminary stage to it. In 1837 Stahl wrote: &quot;Thus the state is the conductor of divine influences upon the outward condition of men. He should order it in God&#x27;s stead, promote it, punish violations of the order, but in doing so also prove the morally reasonable will of the human community, i.e. their obedience to establishing and administering God&#x27;s order.&quot; Based on his belief in the personal God as the supreme principle, Stahl also postulated a personality at the head of the state: the monarch. However, the monarch should not stand above the state, but serve it, complying with the constitution and laws and leading the state to fulfill the tasks set by God.

Stahl based his worldview not on logical necessity (like Hegel), but on the free personality of the revealed God. State and monarch are committed to something higher and have to work in that spirit. The foundation of Stahl&#x27;s philosophy, which was strongly influenced by Schelling but also by Hegel, is the belief in a personal God, in the ruler of history. Guided by him, the &quot;personality&quot; unfolds in the religious-moral area as an individual, as a believer in the church community and as a citizen in the civil order of the &quot;moral world&quot;, overarched by the state, the moral kingdom. The latter for Stahl was normatively determined by Christianity. For Stahl, the state was not a contractual structure, but rather the authority appointed by God; like the individual, the state as a personality strives towards morality. It is clear that this &quot;Christian state&quot; cannot know the Hegelian separation of state and society. Rather, the state is an association of a people under a rule (authority). This kingdom lives from monarchical authority, but is not a theocratic dictatorship. The monarch is &quot;bound&quot; as it has been throughout Lutheran political doctrine since its inception. Stahl&#x27;s ethicized legal concept brings authority and freedom, monarchical principle and ideal &quot;people&quot; into balance, at least verbally.

It follows from sovereignty that the prince is wholly and indivisibly entitled to exercise state power. Since responsibility is part of power, the prince also has the sole legislative initiative, the right to use the revenue and the right to convene the parliament of the people. In the event of constitutional conflicts between the chamber and the government, he has the absolute veto of final decision. But it is his duty to subordinate his interests to the state and to respect the rights of his subjects. The duty of the subjects is obedience and love for the legitimate authorities, devotion and sacrifice for the state. Their right is, first, the right to freedom of religion, teaching, and property; for the state as a highly imperfect institution, as the realm of the Fall of Man, can only stand negatively, only protectively, over everything that arises from within the individual. These living conditions could only be fulfilled in a higher unity, in that of God&#x27;s commandments, which worked directly in the souls of his creatures. However, the rights of the subjects were not exhausted with this negative status. Since they are free creatures, they must not only obey, but also agree. The ruler&#x27;s will must become their own free will. Stahl therefore demanded a people&#x27;s representative body that could approve laws and taxes or reject them, that would monitor proper financial management, the constitutional implementation of laws, and just administration of justice, and thus become the guardian and guarantor of human freedom. It must be a popular representation, so Stahl rejected feudal estates. But it should reflect the actual balance of power; hence Stahl was for universal but against equal suffrage and for a House of Lords. The representatives of the people have not just an advisory, but a decision-making voice and must be heard. Since it stands on a legal basis, it can resist, but only passively.

== Reception ==

=== Contemporary ===
There was already criticism from Stahl&#x27;s contemporaries: The historian and politician Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann criticized that Stahl only wanted to grant freedom in &quot;homeopathic droplet particles.&quot;  The liberal politician and political scientist Robert von Mohl counted Stahl among the opponents of the rule of law and advocates of a theocracy. Eduard Wippermann dedicated an appendix to Stahl in his work &quot;Die Altorientalischen Religionenstaaten,&quot; published in 1851&quot;,&quot; because he saw him as the representative of the doctrine of the &quot;Christian state&quot; who was the only one who &quot;scientifically processed these doctrines in a comprehensive system&quot;, and stated that it was easiest to govern in the religious state. The constitutional lawyer Rudolf Gneist also said ironically that Stahl&#x27;s personality and way of life was in &quot;sharp contrast&quot; to that of his &quot;party comrades&quot;.

=== Imperial Era ===
The conservative historian Heinrich von Treitschke certified Stahl that he had become &quot;completely Christian and German&quot;, called him a pioneer of national unity and the &quot;only great political mind among all thinkers of Jewish blood&quot;.  In the Wilhelmine Empire, legal positivism had prevailed and Stahl was largely forgotten,  at best found historical interest, for example with Erich Kaufmann, while Laband paid no attention to Stahl in his C&quot;onstitutional law of the German Reich&quot; in 1876.

=== Nazi Era ===
In National Socialist Germany, following Reich Minister of the Interior Hans Frank, e.g. Johannes Heckel (&quot;The intrusion of the Jewish spirit into German constitutional and canon law by Friedrich Julius Stahl&quot;)  and Edgar Tatarin-Tarnheyden (because of the &quot;atomization of state power&quot;) Stahl was considered the &quot;alien.&quot; To Carl Schmitt, Stahl was &quot;the boldest in&quot; a &quot;Jewish front&quot;, who paralyzed Prussia and was responsible for the downfall of the Hohenzollerns. On the other hand, writers in exile spoke positively or differently about Stahl&#x27;s teachings; the young Peter F. Drucker published a praising essay on Stahl in Tübingen in April 1933, shortly before he had to leave Germany.

=== Since 1945 ===
After 1945, Stahl&#x27;s doctrines, along with criticism, continued to appeal to Christian conservative politicians, historians such as Hans-Joachim Schoeps and Lutheran church representatives such as Otto Dibelius into the 1960s. In 1949 Fritz Fischer particularly emphasized the danger of the pseudo-liberal concessions in Stahl&#x27;s state theory; with the help of his constitutional compromise, the necessary parliamentary reform of the German system of government was prevented by the end of the First World War . His authoritarian views had decisively determined the thinking of the leading conservative Protestant leadership elites in Prussia-Germany in the state, in the church, in society and at the universities up to the First World War and beyond, thereby contributing to the downfall of the Weimar Republic with its consequences. &quot;The story of the &#x27;counter-revolution of science&#x27; was not with FJ Stahl, it was not finished in 1918.&quot; In 1963, Dieter Grosser recognized Stahl&#x27;s theory of the state as a significant contribution to overcoming the state-theoretical and constitutional-political problems of his time and also recognized its legal-philosophical foundations as having lasting academic value. In particular, he worked out the religious-ethical, legal and political structure of the &quot;moral realm of personal character&quot;, the central concept of Stahl&#x27;s legal and political philosophy, and attributed the tensions in Stahl&#x27;s system to the rooting of his thinking in the various &quot;reactive&quot; political ones, &quot;Currents of the Restoration,&quot; Schelling&#x27;s philosophy and Luther&#x27;s theology. In contrast, in 1967 Robert Adolf Kann firmly stated that Stahl merely systematized the conservative ideas of his time and adapted them to their needs. His ideas, which had already been outdated during his lifetime, essentially did not go beyond the medieval doctrine of the two swords.  Martin Greiffenhagen characterized Stahl in 1977 as a representative of an authoritarian, authoritarian-institutional understanding of the state and church. His views - like the doctrines of his predecessors, party comrades and successors - are &quot;refuted by their own history&quot;.  In summary, H.-J. Wiegand stated in 1980: &quot;Stahl is not dead; he left a legacy that haunts his heirs to this day.&quot;

Christian Wiegand examined Stahl&#x27;s work very thoroughly and critically in 1980 and accused him of not having understood Immanuel Kant&#x27;s critical epistemology and his transcendental philosophy,  but rather having fallen behind from a pre-critical point of view and therefore not having been able to understand the German understand idealism.  

Wiegand describes Stahl&#x27;s work as one of the &quot;most influential philosophical defense campaigns against the events of 1789&quot; alongside Burke and Taine. He runs a general reckoning against the &quot;system of the revolution&quot;.  According to Stahl&#x27;s own understanding, he means &quot;revolution is the specific political doctrine which, since 1789, has fulfilled the way of thinking of the peoples as a world-moving power and determined the institutions of public life&quot;.  And the &quot;deduction from the will of man&quot; is &quot;always revolutionary&quot;.

The goal of fighting &quot;the revolution&quot; determines everything Stahl does: his writing, his academic and his political activities. That is why he agitates, debates and polemicizes mercilessly and uncompromisingly. Wiegand repeatedly states that &quot;the only written word that is important for him [Stahl] is Rom. 13&quot;, with which he justifies the monarchical principle: &quot;In particular, the government has respect and authority from God. It is by the grace of God.&quot;

As recently as 2010, Federal Minister of Justice Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger stated critically that, according to Stahl, &quot;all government and the power of kings (is) from God and all obedience to the law and to the supreme state power on this divine basis and authority&quot; &quot;should be based&quot;, &quot;that the sham constitutionalism and sham parliamentarism above all of the empire was almost the prerequisite for the formation and consolidation of a historically blind, rigid, authoritarian state system of government in Germany with unlimited powers&quot; and this organic, conservative and romantic understanding of the state describes &quot;a state with its own full powers, whose scope for action is at best moral, but by no means are subject to a specified legal limitation. In plain language: This state is allowed to do everything if it wants to.&quot; She also states &quot;that the essential elements of Carl Schmitt&#x27;s state theory are entirely consistent with the state theory of the 19th century related to the monarchy or - to put it another way - entirely in line with the organic.&quot;

<doc id="1267784" wikidata="Q550211" url="?curid=1267784" title="Huchen">
<text>The huchen (&quot;Hucho hucho&quot;) (, from German), also known as Danube salmon or redfish (), is a large species of freshwater fish in the family Salmonidae native to the Danube basin in Central and Eastern Europe. It is the type species of genus &quot;Hucho&quot; (a.k.a. the taimens), being closely related (in the same subfamily) to salmon, trout, char and lenoks.

==Distribution ==
The huchen is endemic to the Danube basin in Europe where the remaining population is threatened primarily by river damming, resulting in habitat fragmentation and loss through river impoundment and disruption of the longitudinal continuity of rivers, cutting away fish from its spawning grounds, with overfishing and fisheries mismanagement as an additional issue in many areas. Damming and all these other problems are especially visible in the Balkans.

The upper reaches of the Danube basin, rivers and tributaries contain almost all of the recent population. This includes:
*In Austria: the Inn river, the upper Drava, with the lower Gail in Carinthia, the Pielach, in Styria the upper Mur.
*In Germany: middle and lower Inn, Isar (especially in Munich) 
In the Balkans huchen still appears in following river systems:
*In Slovenia: in the headwaters of Sava and its tributaries.
*In Croatia: in the upper and middle course of Kupa. 
*In Bosnia and Herzegovina: in the upper and middle Una, with the upper and middle Sana; the upper and middle Vrbas, with the lower and middle Vrbanja; the main channel of the Bosna lost its population due to degradation of its waters, its banks and riverbed, but its four main tributaries, the Krivaja, the Fojnička, the Lašva and the Željeznica, are still important habitats; one of the most important huchen habitats in the Balkans and Europe is the Drina, with its numerous tributaries, especially the Lim, the Tara and the Ćehotina, and smaller ones, the Bistrica, the Prača, and the Drinjača; 
* In Serbia: the Lim.
* In Montenegro: the Lim, with the Lake Plav, the Ćehotina, and the Tara.

Some of these habitats, especially in the Balkans, are endangered with planned, or already implemented plans for construction of new dams and hydroelectric power plants, such as on the Lim in Serbia, or like in case of the river Piva in Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose respective populations were completely wiped out since mid 20th century.

In some cases rehabilitation of parts of the habitat is attempted, through restoration of the river course. Such positive example is the part of the course of the river Inn, with some -long stretch around the Bavarian town of Mühldorf was rebuilt and renaturalized and the huchen has returned in recent years.

It has been introduced to other major river basins elsewhere on the continent and even North Africa, to rivers in Morocco, but these populations are not self-sustaining. Some evidence suggest that in historic times the huchen has also been found in the neighboring Dniester basin. 
Huchen sometimes successfully establish in accessible natural lakes, like glacial Lake Plav which is the source of the Lim river in Montenegro, one of the major huchen habitats in the Balkans. However, the species sometimes survives even when cut off from the rest of the population in big dam reservoirs on mountain rivers, such as reservoirs on the Drina in Bosnia, or Lake Czorsztyn in Poland, as long as competitive and/or allochthonous predator species are not introduced into the newly created lakes.

==Ecology ==

=== Appearance ===
The huchen reaches about in length and more than in weight. The average length is between . The huchen has a slender body that is nearly round in cross-section. On the reddish brown back are several dark patches in an X or crescent shape, but most distinctive feature is its head, which is larger than in other salmonides (longer and wider), with large elongated mouth. 

=== Diet ===
As the largest fish found within many European rivers, Huchen like many other salmonoids under an ontogenic change as they grow older. Smaller fish feed on the larvae of water insects or on insects dropped into the water. As they get older, larger individuals prey on other species of fish and small vertebrates. From a study in Slovakia, older angler caught individuals primarily seemed to prey on Spirlin &quot;Alburnoides bipunctatus,&quot; Chub &quot;Leuciscus cephalus&quot;, Brown trout &quot;Salmo trutta&quot;, and Barbel &quot;Barbus barbus.&quot; 

===Historical occurrence===
There is no international convention nor single agreed body concerned with verification of records and mandated with the task, however there are many modern and historical records for the largest huchen caught. Among these recorded is a fish weighing , caught in February 1985 in Spittal an der Drau in Austria,; also one weighing , which is stuffed and was probably grown on fish-farm in Austria for breeding.
Other storied examples of recorded specimens with existing photographs and media reports include , caught in January 1938 by Bosnian railway worker and angler Halil Sofradžija at the Dragojevića Rapids on the Drina river, near the town of Ustikolina in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This case was recorded on photograph and reportage was later published in prime Serbian daily Politika on 23 February 1938. Dževat Šarkinović, angler from Plav, caught Danube salmon weighing , long, in late spring of 1985 in lake Plav, and gave it to Hotel &quot;Plavsko jezero&quot; who presented it at &quot;International Fair of Hunting and Fishing&quot; in Novi Sad where it was noted as a &quot;world record&quot;. Today, this specimen stands as stuffed exhibit at the wall of hotel&#x27;s foyer in Plav. Another recorded trophy from the Drina include huchen caught by angler Remzija Krkalić from Foča in 1940, weighing .

==Reproduction==
This permanent freshwater salmonid spawns in April, once water reaches a temperature of . For spawning, the huchen migrates up the river and enters small and shallow affluents, where females excavate depressions in the gravel into which they deposit their eggs, then a male releases a cloud of sperm and the female then covers the eggs with sand. Larvae hatch 30 to 35 days after fertilization.

==Commercial breeding==

There is a considerable effort to produce huchen fry commercially and to reintroduce the species into the wild with moderate to good success. This requires catching the adults just before spawning and keeping them in special tanks. Fry are released in appropriate places once they have reached .

<text>Posto Santo is a parish in the municipality of Angra do Heroísmo on the island of Terceira in the Azores. The population in 2011 was 1,048, in an area of 20.37 km2. Posto Santo was elevated to parish status on 15 September 1980. It was previously part of the parish of Santa Luzia. The parish is relatively far from the ocean, and it lies at an elevation of forty-five metres. Its predominant economic activity is agriculture. It contains the localities Espigão, Grota do Medo, Lapinha, Piquinho and Posto Santo.

==History==
The name, &quot;Posto Santo&quot;, is literally translated as &quot;holy post&quot;, its origin developed from an outbreak of bubonic plague in 1599 that killed thousands on the island of Terceira. The parish of Posto Santo was spared and served as a refuge for many of the residents of Angra do Heroísmo. Since then, it has been known as Posto Santo.

Posto Santo should not be confused with Porto Santo which is an island close to Madeira Island.

<text>William Crozier Walsh (September 30, 1913 – January 27, 1975) was a film producer, screenwriter and comics writer who primarily worked on live-action films for Walt Disney Productions. He was born in New York City. For his work on &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, he shared Academy Award nominations for Best Picture with Walt Disney, and for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium with Don DaGradi. He also wrote the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strip for more than two decades. 

In 1970 an article in &quot;Variety&quot; listed him as the second most successful film producer of all time in terms of money-earning movies even though he was &quot;a guy no one&#x27;s ever heard of&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Walsh was born in 1913 to immigrant parents in New York. He was raised in Cincinnati by his aunt and uncle, Agnes and William Newman. He played football at Purcell and wrote sports for the &quot;Cincinnati Commercial Tribune&quot;. In 1934 he accepted a University of Cincinnati athletic scholarship.

===Early career===
While at UC, Walsh produced a freshman show that happened to be seen by Barbara Stanwyck and Frank Fay who were passing through town in a show, &quot;Tattle Tales&quot;. They hired Walsh at $12 a week to rewrite the show, which went to Broadway where it ran for five weeks. Walsh then followed Stanwyck and Fay to Hollywood. He worked as a press agent for 15 years at the Ettinger Company and started writing jokes as a sideline on the suggestion of client Edgar Buchanan.

===Disney comic strips===
He joined the Disney company in 1943 as a press agent and began writing the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strip as a sideline. &quot;Mickey Mouse was very dull and kind of stupid,&quot; Walsh later said. &quot;Donald Duck was the one I liked. He had complete licence. He had pizzaz.&quot; Due to Walsh&#x27;s lack of interest in Mickey as a character, and to his own taste for science fiction, mystery and horror, the stories he wrote for the strip quickly became very different from those of the previous decade. Walsh&#x27;s storylines could be darker and more violent than in the earlier strips, and introduced various bizarre characters. Notably, Walsh created Eega Beeva, an evolved man from the future who became one the strip&#x27;s protagonists from 1947 to 1950, effectively replacing Goofy as Mickey&#x27;s sidekick. Another recurring character created by Walsh is the bird Ellsworth who appeared as Mickey&#x27;s sidekick in the strip&#x27;s sunday pages where he became a major focus, sometimes stealing the show from Mickey. Walsh continued to write the daily strip for more than twenty years, partnering with artist Floyd Gottfredson on dozens of stories until 1955, when the strip changed formats to become a gag-a-day strip. Walsh continued writing the gag strip until 1964, when he passed it on to Roy Williams.

While at Disney, Walsh also wrote gags for the &quot;Panchito&quot; stories in the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; comic strip (1944–45), and created the &quot;Uncle Remus and His Tales of Br&#x27;er Rabbit&quot; Sunday strip (1945–46).

===Television===
In the late 1940s Disney put Walsh in charge of their television operations. He wrote and produced television specials, starting with &quot;One Hour in Wonderland&quot; (1950).

Walsh produced a number of huge successes, including &quot;Davy Crockett&quot; (1954–55) and &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; (1955-59). He also wrote the feature &quot;The Littlest Outlaw&quot; (1955) and produced a number of serials that aired as part of &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, including &quot;Spin and Marty&quot;, &quot;Corky and White Shadow&quot;, &quot;The Hardy Boys: The Mystery of the Applegate Treasure&quot;, &quot;Adventure in Dairyland&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Clint and Mac&quot;, and &quot;Walt Disney Presents: Annette&quot;.

He moved up to features in 1959.

===Features===
Walsh wrote and produced &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot; (1959) with Fred MacMurray, Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran. A fantasy comedy made for relatively little money it was a huge hit and became the most profitable Disney film of all time. The same team then made &quot;Toby Tyler&quot; (1959), a circus film that was well received critically though not as popular.

Walsh wrote and produced a series of comedies starring MacMurray and Kirk, all very popular: &quot;The Absent-Minded Professor&quot; (1961), a fantasy; &quot;Bon Voyage!&quot; (1962), an Americans-abroad family comedy, also with Corcoran; and &quot;Son of Flubber&quot; (1963), a sequel to &quot;Absent Minded Professor&quot;. He provided the story for &quot;The Misadventures of Merlin Jones&quot; (1964), a fantasy comedy with Kirk. Kirk called hinm &quot;the resident genius&quot; at the studio.

Walsh co-wrote the musical &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964) which became the most popular movie Disney ever released. He wrote it with Don DaGradi who would be Walsh&#x27;s most regular collaborator - Walsh normally worked with a co-writer, or supervised other writers.

Walsh wrote and produced &quot;That Darn Cat!&quot; (1965), &quot;Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N.&quot; (1966) and &quot;Blackbeard&#x27;s Ghost&quot; (1968).

===Post-Walt Disney===
After Walt Disney&#x27;s death in 1966 Walsh was part of the seven man committee who ran the company.

He wrote and produced &quot;The Love Bug&quot; which was a huge success.

In 1970 Walsh said &quot;I make movies for people between the ages of nine and fourteen. It&#x27;s a very intelligent and very honest audience... Also I don&#x27;t make personal statements; I make movies hoping they&#x27;ll make money so I&#x27;ll be able to make more movies. I&#x27;m a schlock hack and I glory in it. My folks had a tent show and if you tried to make personal statements for audiences in Kentucky and Tennessee they&#x27;d burn the tent down.&quot; He said he never wanted to direct because &quot;I have flat feet... you have to get up too early&quot; and &quot;you have to talk to actors.&quot;

He wrote and produced &quot;Scandalous John&quot; (1971) which he said was his favourite film even though it was the only one to have lost money. Far more popular was &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; (1971).

In 1971 Walsh said his main contributions to the films were &quot;fantasy... I have nutty ideas which any other studio would throw me the hell on the street for but which are very compatible here&quot;.

His later films included &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Athlete&quot; (1973), &quot;Herbie Rides Again&quot; (1974) and &quot;One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing&quot; (1975).

Walsh died of a heart attack in Los Angeles in 1975, and was interred in Glendale&#x27;s Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery.

<doc id="1267823" wikidata="Q1410851" url="?curid=1267823" title="Fibromatosis">
<text>The term fibromatosis refers to a group of soft tissue tumors which have certain characteristics in common, including absence of cytologic and clinical malignant features, a histology consistent with proliferation of well-differentiated fibroblasts, an infiltrative growth pattern, and aggressive clinical behavior with frequent local recurrence. It is classed by the World Health Organization as an intermediate soft tissue tumor related to the sarcoma family. Arthur Purdy Stout coined the term &quot;fibromatosis&quot; (in the name &quot;congenital generalized fibromatosis&quot;, describing myofibromatosis), in 1954.

==Diagnosis==
===Juvenile subtypes===
Subtypes of juvenile fibromatosis include:

* Infantile myofibromatosis: solitary tumors commonly occurring in the head and neck regions; multiple tumors occurring in the skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscles, and/or less commonly bones; or, rarely, tumors occurring in an internal organ(s).
* Aponeurotic fibroma
* Infantile digital fibromatosis
* Aggressive infantile fibromatosis
* Fibromatosis colli: benign sternocleidomastoid muscle tumor developing in infants within 8 weeks (average: 24 days) of delivery. It generally does not require resection and responds well to physiotherapy.
* Dermatofibrosis lenticularis (Buschke–Ollendorff syndrome)
* Fibromatosis hyalinica multiplex (juvenile hyaline fibromatosis)
* Lipofibromatosis

=== Adult subtypes ===

==== Superficial ====
* Palmar fibromatosis (Dupuytren&#x27;s contracture)
* Plantar fibromatosis (Ledderhose disease)
* Penile fibromatosis (Peyronie&#x27;s disease)
* Pachydermodactyly
* Knuckle pads
* Dermatofibroma
* Nodular fasciitis
* Elastofibroma
* Fibrous papule of the face

==== Deep ====
* Aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumors)
** Abdominal, intra-abdominal, extra-abdominal

==Treatment==
Treatment is mainly surgical; radiotherapy or chemotherapy is usually an indication of relapse. Head and neck desmoid fibromatosis is a serious condition due to local aggression, specific anatomical patterns and the high rate of relapse. For children surgery is particularly difficult, given the potential for growth disorders.

Treatment includes prompt radical excision with a wide margin and/or radiation. For aggressive fibromatosis, the consensus on treatment is observation for new tumors rather than immediate surgery. Despite their local infiltrative and aggressive behavior, mortality is minimal to nonexistent for peripheral tumors. In intra-abdominal fibromatosis associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), surgery is avoided if possible due to high rates of recurrence within the abdomen carrying significant morbidity and mortality. Conversely, for intra-abdominal fibromatosis without evidence of FAP extensive surgery may still be required for local symptoms, but the risk of recurrence is low.
==Terminology==
Other names include musculoaponeurotic fibromatosis, referring to the tendency of these tumors to be adjacent to and infiltrating deep skeletal muscle, aggressive fibromatosis and desmoid tumor. A clear difference should be made between intra-abdominal and extra-abdominal localizations. Fibromatosis is a different entity from neurofibromatosis.

<text>Reichenbach/O.L. (full German name: Reichenbach/Oberlausitz, Sorbian and Polish: &quot;Rychbach&quot;) is a town in the Görlitz district, in eastern Saxony, in eastern Germany. It is located 13 km west of Görlitz.

==History==
The settlement was first mentioned in 1238, when it was part of the Kingdom of Bohemia. In 1319 it passed to the Duchy of Jawor, the southwesternmost duchy of fragmented Piast-ruled Poland, and later on it was also ruled by Bohemian, Hungarian, Saxon and Polish monarchs. In 1815, it was annexed by Prussia. From 1816 to 1919, Reichenbach was part of the Province of Silesia, from 1919 to 1938 of the Province of Lower Silesia, again from 1938 to 1941 of the Province of Silesia and again from 1941 to 1945 of the Province of Lower Silesia. From 1945 to 1952 it was part of Saxony and from 1952 to 1990 of the Bezirk Dresden of East Germany. Schloss Krobnitz, an estate which belonged to Prussian Minister of War Albrecht von Roon, lies in Reichenbach.

==Broadcasting station==

There was a radio broadcasting station at the northern edge of Reichenbach since 1937. Originally built as a free-standing wooden tower, it was replaced after World War II with a steel construction, which was renewed in 1999. The Reichenbach transmitter broadcast the regional station MDR Info at 1188 kHz with an output of 3 kilowatts. The transmitter was taken out of operation in May 2013, and subsequently demolished.

<text>The Fightin&#x27; Texas Aggie Band (also known as the Noble Men of [[Kyle Field|Kyle]] or just the Aggie Band) is the official marching band of Texas A&amp;M University. Composed of over 400 men and women from the school&#x27;s Corps of Cadets, it is the largest military marching band in the United States. The band&#x27;s complex straight-line marching maneuvers are performed exclusively to traditional marches.

Since its inception in 1894, its members eat together, sleep in the same dormitories, and practice up to forty hours per week on top of a full academic schedule. The Aggie Band performs at all home football games, some away games, and university and Corps functions throughout the year. The band has also participated in inauguration parades for many United States presidents and Texas governors, major annual parades across the country, and the dedication ceremony for the George H. W. Bush Presidential Library.

==History==

===Early years===
The Aggie Band owes its existence to Joseph Holick (born in 1868 in Moravia). In 1885, Holick and his brother Louis boarded an empty boxcar bound for Orange, Texas, so that they could gain employment in a lumber mill. En route, the two stopped in Bryan, Texas, near the campus of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas. The 22-year-old Holick began to doubt his choice, stating, &quot;I was a small boy and couldn&#x27;t do lumbering work&quot;, and chose to remain in Bryan working under Raymond Blatherwick, owner of a prominent boot shop. Lawrence Sullivan Ross, the president of the nearby college and a former Governor of Texas, stopped into Blatherwick&#x27;s boot shop and noted how inconvenient it was for cadets to go to Bryan for their boots. Ross requested Holick be stationed at the new military college to perform cobbler duties.

Holick accepted the proposal and moved to work at Texas A&amp;M. Shortly after his arrival, the Commandant&#x27;s staff discovered his musical talents. They requested him to play the bugle for Corps functions and for US$65 a month, he was assigned to play &quot;Reveille&quot; and &quot;Taps&quot;. Because the new job paid much more than his previous one, Holick wanted to give the school &quot;more than just two tunes for its money and he asked the commandant for permission to start a cadet band&quot;. The commandant agreed and named Holick its first bandmaster. Under his tutelage and the leadership of subsequent bandmasters, the band grew from 13 members at its inception in 1894 to 75 bandsmen in 1924.

Early drum majors are credited with inspiring the band&#x27;s name. The first student drum major, H.A. &quot;California&quot; Morse, was asked to leave the college due to fighting. In addition, the early drum majors were chosen in physical combat; insomuch that the candidates were placed in a locked room, with the best fighter / the one emerging victorious, being named to the coveted position. This tradition of aggressiveness and physical combat was noted by band members, who then took to calling themselves the &quot;Fightin&#x27; &quot;Texas Aggie Band.

===Dunn years===

In 1924, Lieutenant Colonel Richard J. Dunn was appointed as bandmaster. As a former member of John Philip Sousa&#x27;s Marine Band and with 26 years of military band leadership experience, Dunn quickly instituted changes within the band. The first was to the position of bugler, whose duties had fallen to the bandmaster since 1894. When informed that he was expected to fill the role, Dunn told college officials, &quot;I have blown enough bugles. I am the Bandmaster. Someone else can blow the bugle calls.&quot; From then on, the Corps Bugler was chosen from the ranks of the Aggie Band.

Dunn also instituted uniform changes which added white canvas to the band uniform, resulting in a &quot;flash effect&quot; every other step. Dunn tried, to no avail, to rid the band of the Senior Boots, but this tradition was too well-established. Other additions included crossed white belts, later discarded in favor of a white Sam Browne belt, silver buckles, and the addition of a bugle rank to lead the band in its maneuvers. Changes in the drills included the &quot;Block T&quot;, the band&#x27;s signature, and such intricate designs which led to talk amongst fans about the band &quot;always winning halftime&quot;.

Under Dunn&#x27;s experience, the band instituted some traditions that the university uses to the present. In 1925, Marvin H. Mimms wrote the lyrics for an alma mater for the school. Dunn, who found the &quot;Aggie War Hymn&quot; &quot;inappropriate&quot; for social functions and solemn occasions, wrote its accompanying music and presented it to the student body titled &quot;Spirit of Aggieland&quot;. In 1926, the tradition of Elephant Walk began when two seniors in the band led a procession of seniors throughout the school grounds visiting all the important places on campus. All the seniors in one single file was &quot;quite a sight to behold&quot;, and one junior commented that they looked like a bunch of old elephants wandering around trying to find some place to die. The name stuck and the tradition continues to the present.

Beginning in 1939, the U.S. Army required all cadets to be in either infantry or field artillery units. Therefore, the band was split into two separate units at opposite ends of the campus dormitories and named Infantry and Artillery Bands. When the two units performed together, they formed the Combined Band. 1942 saw the band expand to 250 members, but the need for manpower for the war effort caused membership to plummet. By the end of the 1942–1943 school year, it dropped it to only 90 bandsmen. As &quot;a crusty old army man&quot;, Dunn understood the nation&#x27;s urgent need for troops, and he accepted the fact that the Aggie Band could only return after the war was over.

Along with conducting the Aggie Band, Dunn started his own orchestra with the newly built A&amp;M Consolidated High School on the Texas A&amp;M Campus, called the &quot;Little Symphony Orchestra&quot;. Dunn was also the founder of the famous A&amp;M Consolidated High School Tiger Band in 1947.

===Adams era===

Dunn once told then-cadet Edward Vergne Adams, &quot;One day I want you to direct this band.&quot; Adams thought the Colonel was joking, but &quot;went to music school after graduation just in case he wasn&#x27;t&quot;. After music school, he joined the army and put his musical skills to rest for the duration of the war, with one exception: while on regimental staff during the retreat ceremony at the end of the day, the assigned bugler had no experience and couldn&#x27;t play a single note, so Adams stepped out of formation, took the bugle from the bugler&#x27;s hands, blew the appropriate calls, handed the bugle back, and marched back into his spot in the formation.

This intolerance for incompetence served him well when he accepted the invitation of Dunn to be his replacement as director of the Aggie Band. Adams began his tenure with an undisciplined band devoid of experience and ravaged by years of war, but in his first year of leadership, the ranks of the band quickly swelled to 225 members. Infantry and field artillery associations were no longer required by the Army and Adams changed the units&#x27; names to the Maroon and White Bands.

Adams began to make the drills far more intricate and precise than they had been in the past by adding a countermarch, maneuvers from the &quot;Army Drill Manual&quot;, and established a 30-inch (76 cm) step, or six steps for every five yards (4.57m), as the band standard. Adams also added the criss-cross maneuver. First performed November 27, 1947 at the annual Thanksgiving Day game with the University of Texas, the criss-cross maneuver and its later variations (specifically the four-way cross) became the band&#x27;s most anticipated maneuver. Other band directors said it was impossible to do because it required two people to be in the same place at the same time (indeed, to this day computer programs that chart band formations say that this maneuver cannot be performed). To accomplish this, band members step between each other&#x27;s feet. In later years, people who did not know that the maneuver was first done in 1947 claimed that the drill was designed by a computer. Adams explained, &quot;It&#x27;s all a matter of mathematics. One man can take up only a certain amount of space at one time and moves in one direction at a predictable rate of speed.&quot;
The band&#x27;s reputation spread and other bands had begun to have some apprehension about performing in the same halftime as the Aggie Band. One Southwest Conference band director stated, &quot;I dread going against the Aggie Band... What is so humiliating is to see the Aggie Band do things band directors talk about as being impossible, and do them perfectly. It takes two weeks to recover from the trauma.&quot; In 1960, &quot;one band gave up without a fight&quot;: the Trinity Tiger Band opted to sit instead of perform and gave the Aggie Band the entire halftime to perform.

During Adams&#x27; tenure, the college acquired a new mascot, the first since the original Reveille died in 1944. Reveille II, like the original Reveille, was cared for and attended to by band members. During halftime performances, the young dog was allowed to be on the field with the band without her leash. During these breaks where she could get out and run, she had a tendency to &quot;do her business&quot; on Kyle Field&#x27;s playing surface. This didn&#x27;t bother the band members much, as Reveille stayed away from the band, but Adams discovered a gambling scheme whereby cadets were taking bets on what yard line the dog would defecate. He quickly ended the practice and turned the responsibility of caring for Reveille over to Company E-2, which has since been called the Mascot Company.

On October 7, 1967, the first meeting of the Aggie Band Association took place to support the band. The organization, composed of former members and supporters, continue to assist the band through fundraising, scholarships, instrument repair, and general welfare of the cadets in the band. In 1970, Adams acquired funds and built a new band hall which was named in his honor. 

===Modernization and expansion===
Colonel Joe T. Haney took over the band in 1973. He felt his obligation was, &quot;not to build up the band ... [but] to keep it at its already exceptional level&quot;. During Haney&#x27;s years, the band expanded to include a concert band, a symphonic band, the Aggieland Orchestra, and a Drum and Bugle Corps, and the names of the two subunits reverted to their earlier designations of Infantry and Artillery Bands.

This simple philosophy was tested as Texas A&amp;M transitioned from an all-male military college to a coeducational research university. The addition of women to the Corps presented some challenges, including one high-profile lawsuit and fierce resistance from former Corps and Band members. When women were finally admitted to the band under court order (Fall Semester, 1985); the first three women had to be housed in a separate dorm until accommodations could be made within the band dorms. Reporters were relentless and Haney finally called an open press conference with the three young ladies. The female cadets refused pictures unless their fish buddies (members of their freshman class in their unit) were included in the photos. With a band dropout rate of 33% the odds were against all of the female cadets succeeding, only Andrea Abat remained in the band through her senior year. Haney realized the separate living conditions were not conducive to good order and discipline and integrated the dorms, grouping females at one end of the dorm and designating one bathroom for exclusive female use.

Amidst these drastic changes, large proportions of the freshmen classes (some as high as 30%) contained all-state high school band members. As the band&#x27;s experience and musical talents grew, the quality of the music improved dramatically. Haney even rewrote the drills to include a portion where the band stopped moving and played to the audience. This innovation was well received and became a staple of the band&#x27;s repertoire. In 1975, at a televised game versus the University of Arkansas, the Aggie Band was repeatedly asked to play music during lulls in the game. By the fourth quarter, the Aggie Band had played on TV during every break and Colonel Haney, trying his best to be fair, told the cameraman that they really should let the Razorback Band play a little too. The cameraman called up to the broadcast booth to get guidance and then replied, &quot;The director doesn&#x27;t want to hear the Arkansas band, he wants to hear the Aggie Band.&quot;

The drills became even more complicated as Haney added formations and maneuvers never before seen. The excellence shown on the field belied its heavy dependence on precision. On October 24, 1981, the band suffered a serious misstep during the halftime show at Rice University when four members of a lead element turned early and, before anyone could make a correction, colliding band members ground the drill to a halt. With so many members doing exactly what the person in front of them does with mere inches of clearance, the cascade effect was unrecoverable and the band simply stopped and left the field. Although it was first rumored that the collision was intended to mock the Rice Marching Owl Band, and later that
Rice students were using whistles to throw off the band&#x27;s response to drum major whistle commands, all of the rumors proved to be unsubstantiated. Thereafter the band performed all drills in Houston without whistle commands.

The following weekend the band attempted their most complicated drill and performed flawlessly. Each subsequent week, the drills became more complicated. The &quot;Bryan-College Station Eagle&#x27;s&quot; editor opined, &quot;A&amp;M is probably the only school anywhere that throws in a free football game with its performance. One of these days, I fully expect the band to be invited to a bowl game—and to be told it can bring along its football team if it wants to.&quot;

===Into a new millennium===
Lieutenant Colonel Ray E. Toler, a Texas Christian University graduate, replaced Haney when he stepped down in 1989. As a veteran of many Air Force Bands and with a Grammy Award nomination under his belt, Toler was quick to realize the potential and traditions of the Aggie Band and quickly set about publicizing it. Under his direction, the Aggie Band began a weekly television show (the &quot;Texas Aggie Band Show&quot;) that showcased the band, the Corps of Cadets, and the daily life of a band member. As of 2007, the Aggie Band is the only university or college band with its own weekly television show. The Aggie Band was recognized nationally as the 2001 recipient of the Louis Sudler Trophy for collegiate marching bands, administered by the John Philip Sousa Foundation. During Toler&#x27;s leadership of the Aggie Band, its presence was personally requested by President-elect George W. Bush for his inauguration parade.

During Toler&#x27;s tenure, many of the drills were written by Colonel Jay Brewer who also served as the announcer for over 30 years until his retirement in 2020. In addition, many of the Aggie drills and music were written by Dr. Timothy Rhea, who succeeded Toler as Director of Bands in 2002. Rhea actively arranges and composes music, which has been published by TRN Music Publisher, RBC Music Publisher, and Arranger&#x27;s Publishing Company. In the 2012–2013 school year, members of the band were first allowed to join the Fish Drill Team. After the 2018–2019 school year, the Aggie Band ceased using the Adams Band Hall and Haney Drill Field, in preparation for its move to the new Music Activities Center (MAC). This facility considerably increases rehearsal space for the band and includes a turf drill field, which is not susceptible to the ruts and holes often created on Haney due to constant marching. The move to the MAC requires the Aggie Band to vacate its traditional dormitories – Dorms 9 and 11, the latter of which was custom-built for the band in 1939 – in favor of dormitories closer to the new facility. The Haney Drill Field was used by the Aggie Band for approximately 75 years. The Fish Drill Team still uses Haney Drill Field for most practices.

On December 6, 2018, a select contingent of the Aggie Band performed at the burial of U.S. President George H. W. Bush on the Texas A&amp;M campus. The band played the presidential salute &quot;Hail to the Chief&quot; and the &quot;Texas Aggie War Hymn&quot; as Bush&#x27;s casket was removed from the funeral train. Although a United States Air Force band performed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; as Bush&#x27;s casket arrived at the burial site, they did not play &quot;Hail to the Chief,&quot; making the Aggie Band&#x27;s performance the last time the late president was saluted with this piece.

==Directors and band staff==
The band is under the oversight of the director of bands at Texas A&amp;M University, currently Dr. Timothy Rhea, who coordinates the band.

==Cadet life==

The Aggie Band is unique among college bands; no other band eats and lives together as a military unit, even at the Service Academies and military colleges. Bandsmen wear their cadet uniforms to class, drill, meetings, and other functions on campus. As a requested component of football away games, they perform at more football games than any other band. As of 1993, the band performed at 125 of the last 131 football games, including a streak of 42 straight from 1981 to 1984. Demand is extremely high for the band and one person, upon finding out the Aggie Band would not be performing at the local football game versus A&amp;M, returned and requested a refund for 40 tickets.

The Aggie Band performs a new show each week during the football season and does not generally repeat drills from week to week. During the fall semester, the Aggie Band practices for 90 minutes every weekday morning and on Saturdays every week with a football game. In addition, some components of the band also practice on Sunday afternoons and planning of the drills takes place throughout the fall semester. All told, drills can take eight to nine hours per week on top of a full academic schedule and Corps/ROTC activities.

All seniors in the Corps of Cadets wear distinctive cavalry riding boots with their uniforms. These boots usually cost more than $1,800 and are generally made at Holick&#x27;s, formerly owned by the family of Joseph Holick, the first band director.

=== Organization ===
The members of the band are called BQs and, since the band&#x27;s inception, are part of the Corps of Cadets. The Aggie Band is a major unit in the Corps, comparable in size to a brigade or wing. Unique among Corps units, however, the band is divided into two battalions of three &quot;outfits&quot; each, the Infantry Band and the Artillery Band. All BQs are assigned to one of the six outfits. Each battalion is commanded by a Cadet Lieutenant Colonel and has its own command staff; each outfit is commanded by a Cadet Major. Outfits are further divided into platoons, squads, and fire teams, led by a Cadet Captain, Cadet Staff Sergeant, and Cadet Corporal, respectively. Due to its status as a Senior Military College, all cadets are required to take ROTC classes at least their first two years, though follow-on military service is not required.

From 1948, the Maroon and White Bands functioned as single outfits, with the band as a whole functioning as an independent battalion. When the Infantry and Artillery Bands were reestablished in 1976, they were divided into two outfits each: A-Company and B-Company in the Infantry Band, and A-Battery and B-Battery in the Artillery Band. C-Company and C-Battery existed briefly from 1983 to 1984, then were permanently reactivated in 2013.

===Leadership===
Unlike many bands, the drum majors are not in charge of the band as a whole. Like all major units of the Corps, it has its own commander, a Cadet Colonel. Due to necessity for military functions, the Band Commander is accorded the privilege of the first file in bugle rank (the lead rank of the band). During formal military ceremonies, the Band Commander carries a sabre instead of a bugle, as do all other unit commanders. The Infantry and Artillery Bands perform together for halftime shows, but are often split for minor performances such as local parades and functions where the entire band is not needed. Furthermore, the band is composed of three different ROTC programs and appoints commanders to manage and train the cadets within their respective ROTC affiliations.

On the field, the band is led by three drum majors and the twelve members of bugle rank. Each drum major carries a mace and directs the band based on its movements and whistle commands during a drill. The head drum major is a Cadet Lieutenant Colonel, while the two side drum majors, the Infantry Band Drum Major and the Artillery Band Drum Major, are Cadet Majors.

Bugle rank consists of the Band Commander and eleven other senior cadets who are well respected in the band and have impeccable marching abilities. Each bugle rank member carries a bugle with a banner, which are never played during a performance. Together, the drum majors and bugle rank lead the band through the maneuvers on the field. In addition to their primary functions within the band, the bugles and maces also serve a military ceremonial function and are used to salute commissioned officers, much as a rifleman would salute with a rifle or a commander would salute with a sabre.

===Composition===
The band has over 400 members, though as of 2019, a typical performance fields slightly over 300 bandsmen. Instrumentation consists of more than 60 trumpets, 40 trombones, 30 mellophones, 30 baritones, 25 bass horns, 40 drummers, and 90 assorted woodwinds, though the actual composition varies annually. There are no flutes in the Aggie Band, as their position while being played would hinder the intricate marching maneuvers. Piccolos are used instead. All members of the band must have high school marching experience, an audition during the spring semester leading into the first fall semester of attendance to include major scales and sight reading, and an individual interview with the band director. Prospective members are also encouraged to participate in the &quot;Spend the Night with the Corps&quot; program to better understand the rigors of life in the Corps of Cadets.

==Marching==

===Complex maneuvers===
The repertoire of the Aggie Band&#x27;s maneuvers is designed by the directors and drum majors and can include obliques, flanks, countermarches, and other Army marching maneuvers. The Band is generally led by the bugle rank with each person following the person in front of them, also known as follow-the-leader. Space between band members during countermarches is less than six inches (15 cm) and during other maneuvers even less. This space is insufficient for the bass horns and some members must turn their horns to complete the maneuver. According to an article in &quot;The Battalion&quot;, &quot;some of the Aggie band&#x27;s maneuvers are so complex that some drill-charting software says that the drills are impossible because they require multiple people to be in the same place at the same time.&quot; This is also discussed in a video by The Association of Former Students of Texas A&amp;M University.

The Fightin&#x27; Texas Aggie Band has performed at inauguration parades for many Presidents of the United States in Washington, D.C., including at the personal request of President-elect George H. W. Bush.
Other events in which the band has participated include inauguration parades for Governors of Texas, major annual parades across the country, and the dedication ceremony for the George H. W. Bush Presidential Library.

===Typical halftime drill===
The halftime drill always begins with the band running into place at the command of the drum major&#x27;s whistle. The announcer, an associate band director, then states, usually the crowd in unison with him says, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, now forming at the north end of Kyle Field, the nationally famous Fightin&#x27; Texas Aggie Band.&quot; A whoop and cheers come from the audience. The drum majors then march out in front of the band and the head drum major calls the band to attention and vocally gives directions to the band, referencing the composition of the Aggie War Hymn, by shouting, &quot;Recall! Step off on Hullabaloo!&quot; (Recall is a traditional Army bugle call – the first 34 notes, and intro of the Aggie War Hymn. &quot;Hullabaloo&quot; is the first word sung in the Aggie War Hymn.) These directions are not amplified in any way, but can be heard across the entire stadium. After another whoop, the drum majors signal for the horns to be lifted into playing position with two quick whistle blasts and the bugle rank does a flourish.

The drill then begins with the band playing the opening notes of the War Hymn and stepping off into the initial formation. At some point in the drill, the band converts from Spread formation to Block formation. With no cessation of the music until the band leaves the field, the drill continues and often stops with the band playing the last stanza in place in the center of the field before moving into the signature &quot;Block T&quot; or &quot;Block T&quot;. When done playing, the band runs off the field. Specific maneuvers in the drill can include:

* The Criss Cross: the band files split into two halves and march through each other at 90° angles
* The Four-way Cross: The band splits into four groups of three files and march through each other from each of the corners of the field (this maneuver is one of the more popular among fans, due to its difficulty)
* Minstrel Turns: band members pass through each other by stepping between each other&#x27;s feet.
* Spread-to-Block: the band moves from being 30 files wide (i.e., across the width of the football field) by 12 ranks deep (i.e., along the length of the football field) to 12 files wide by 30 ranks deep
* Block-to-Spread: the opposite of Spread-to-Block
* Continuous Countermarch: the bugle rank leads two successive countermarches following the back of the band through the maneuver
* Wheel Turns (also known as a Gate Turn): A turn of a block of the band where the people on the inside of the turn reduce their step size. This is only done during parades when going around corners.

==Music==
As a military marching band, the Aggie Band exclusively plays traditional marches. Among many other marches, its includes:

* &quot;Fightin&#x27; Texas Aggie War Hymn&quot;

* &quot;Spirit of Aggieland&quot;: The school&#x27;s alma mater
* &quot;The Noble Men of Kyle&quot;: The group&#x27;s signature march; also a nickname for the band
* &quot;Ballad of the Green Berets&quot;
* The main theme from the 1970 film &quot;Patton&quot;
* &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot;
* &quot;Strategic Air Command March&quot;

The Aggie Band frequently performs a number of standard military and circus marches:

* &quot;The Trombone King&quot; (King)
* &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; (Sousa)
* &quot;Bravura&quot; (Duble)
* &quot;National Emblem&quot; (Bagley)
* &quot;Them Basses&quot; (Huffine)
* &quot;Washington Post&quot; (Sousa)
* &quot;Armed Forces Medley&quot; (Traditional)

* &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot; (Sousa)
* &quot;Americans We&quot; (Fillmore)
* &quot;Pentland Hills&quot; (Howe)
* &quot;Klaxon&quot; (Fillmore)
Many non-military works are also commonly played by the band, arranged as marches by Dr. Rhea. These include movie themes (&quot;Theme from 1941&quot;, &quot;Parade of the Charioteers&quot;, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly), concert marches (&quot;The Sinfonians&quot;, &quot;Bird’s Battlin’ Brigade,&quot; Pomp and Circumstance Marches), and even symphonic and orchestral music (&quot;Cathedral Chorus&quot; from &quot;Russian Christmas Music&quot;, &quot;Great Gate of Kiev&quot;, &quot;March of the Toy Soldiers&quot; from &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;).

==Notable members==
*Henry Cisneros, 10th United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and former Mayor of San Antonio. Commander of the combined band (1967-1968)
*General Eric Smith, 36th assistant commandant of the Marine Corps and commander of the combined band (1986-1987)

<doc id="1267844" wikidata="Q3269492" url="?curid=1267844" title="Stanisław Herakliusz Lubomirski">
<text>Prince Stanisław Herakliusz Lubomirski a.k.a. &quot;Mirobulius Tassalinus&quot; (4 March 1642 – 17 January 1702) was a Polish noble, politician, patron of the arts and writer.

==Biography==
Lubomirski was the son of Marshal and Hetman Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski and Konstancja Ligęza. He was married to Zofia Opalińska, the daughter of Court Marshal Łukasz Opaliński, in 1669 and to Elżbieta Doenhoff in 1676.

He was Podstoli of the Crown from 1669, Court Marshal of the Crown from 1673, Grand Marshal of the Crown from 1676 and starost of Spisz.

Lubomirski fought in wars against Sweden and Hungary. He participated with his father in the siege of Toruń in 1658. He refused to join the rokosz of his father and try to mediate between the rokoszans and the king.

He was a proponent of the vivente rege elections and supporter of the politics of queen Ludwika Maria.

He performed numerous diplomatic missions to France, Italy and Spain. He was against the abdication of king Jan II Kazimierz in 1668. From 1667 he was frequently deputy for the Sejm.

Owing to his experience and authority, the Sejm session in 1670 was not broken like the two sessions before, which were aborted by a veto.

During the interregnum in 1673–1674 he supported the candidature of his friend, Jan Sobieski for the Polish throne.

In contrast to his father, he was free of private ambitions and always acted according to the interests of the Republic.

He was variously talented. He became famous outside of Poland as the author of literary and scientific works. He wrote poems, plays and philosophical, religious and historical tracts. He was the founder and benefactor of schools and churches. 
As Sejm Marshal he led the Election Sejm from 2 May to 19 June 1669 and the ordinary Sejm from 9 September to 31 October 1670 in Warsaw.

<text>The Aklan River is the longest river in the province of Aklan, Philippines, and third-longest river on Panay island (after the Panay River in Capiz and Jalaur River in Iloilo). Its drainage basin is the third largest in Panay. The river source is located in the Central Panay Mountain Range on Mount Baloy in the western portion of Capiz in the vicinity of Tapaz. It flows northwards to the mountainous western portion of Jamindan, then northeastward to the town of Libacao in Aklan province. The river traverses the municipalities of Madalag, Malinao, Banga, Lezo, Numancia, and Kalibo before emptying to its mouth into Sibuyan Sea. The name of the river is where the term Aklan came from, and is derived from the word &quot;akae&quot;, which means to boil or to froth. Because of the swiftness of the river current, the water of the Aklan river seems to boil or froth. &quot;Akean&quot; therefore means &quot;where there is boiling or frothing&quot;.

The two major tributaries of the river are the Timbaban River (Madalag River) and Dumarayray River. A portion of the river&#x27;s basin is protected in the Aklan River Watershed Forest Reserve. This reserve in the municipalities of Madalag and Libacao was formed in 1990 through &quot;Proclamation No. 600&quot;, for purposes to protect, maintain, or improve the water yield and provide restraining mechanism for inappropriate forest exploitation and disruptive land-use.

<doc id="1267853" wikidata="Q1663658" url="?curid=1267853" title="Inkarri">
<text>The Inkarri (or Inkari and sometimes Inkaríy) myth is one of the most famous legends of the Inca. When the Spanish conquistadores executed the last ruler of the Inca people, Atahualpa, he vowed (according to the legend) that he would come back one day to avenge his death. According to the legend, the Spaniards buried his body parts in several places around the kingdom: His head is said to rest under the Presidential Palace in Lima, while his arms are said to be under the Waqaypata (Square of tears) in Cusco and his legs in Ayacucho. Buried under the earth he will grow until the day that he will rise, take back his kingdom and restore harmony in the relationship between Pachamama (the earth) and her children.

Since it has been passed on orally for many generations, several different versions of the Inkarri myth exist. The name Inkarri probably evolved from the Spanish Inca-&quot;rey&quot; (Inca-king).

The mythical lost city of Paititi is said to have been founded by Inkarri.

==In popular culture==

The legend of Inkarri is the background story and the title of a novel by Ryan Miller.

A comprehensive analysis in French has been published on the web as &quot;Incarri, la prophétie du retour de l&#x27;Inca&quot;.

The legend of Inkarri is addressed as a character in the James Rollins novel &quot;Excavation&quot;.

<doc id="1267858" wikidata="Q673167" url="?curid=1267858" title="Valaam">
<text>Valaam (; ) is an archipelago in the northern portion of Lake Ladoga, lying within the Republic of Karelia, Russia. The total area of its more than 50 islands is 36 km2. The largest island is also called Valaam. Other named islands are: Skitsky (second by size), Lembos, Sviatoy, Bayonny, Moskovsky, Predtechensky, Nikonovsky, Divny, Emelyanov, Oboronny, Goly, Savvaty&#x27;s, Zosima&#x27;s, Skalisty, Lukovy, Ovsiany, Rzhanoi, Nikolsky.

It is best known as the site of the 14th century Valaam Monastery on Valaam Island and for its natural environment.

==Etymology==
In historical references, the island has also been referred to by the name Walamo, particularly in early European accounts and during the period of geographic exploration, including by figures such as Annie Margaret Clive Bayley. This alternative name may have been used in certain cultural contexts, particularly in relation to the region’s broader connections with surrounding areas.

==History==
In the 12th century, the islands were a part of the Novgorod Republic. In the 17th century, they were captured by Sweden during the Time of Troubles, but Russia reconquered them less than a century later. When the Grand Duchy of Finland was set up in the early 19th century as an autonomous part of the Russian Empire, Alexander I of Russia made Valaam a part of Finland. In 1917, Valaam became a part of newly independent Finland, but it was annexed by the USSR after the Winter War and Continuation War.

The island was visited repeatedly by emperors Alexander I, Alexander II, and other members of the imperial family. Other famous visitors include Tchaikovsky and Mendeleyev.

The island is permanently inhabited by monks and families. In 1999, there were about 600 residents on the main island; including army service personnel, restoration workers, guides and monks. There is a kindergarten, an arts and sports venue, a school, a small museum and a medical centre. The community on Valaam at the moment has no official administrative status.

During the summer, the main island can be reached by tour boats which leave St. Petersburg at night and arrive at the island the following morning.

The president of the Russian Federation has a dacha on one of the islands of Valaam, but its precise location is not publicly known.

==Geography==
The climate and natural history of the island are unique because of its position in Lake Ladoga. Spring begins at the end of March and a typical summer on Valaam consists of 30–35 sunny days, which is more than on the mainland. The average temperature in July is . The winter and snow arrive in early December. In the middle of February the ice road to the nearest city of Sortavala () is traversable. The average temperature of February is .

More than 480 species of plants grow on the island, many of which have been cultivated by monks. The island is covered by coniferous woods, about 65% of which are pine. Ten species of mammals and more than 120 avian species call the archipelago home.

<text>Strelna () is a municipal settlement in Petrodvortsovy District of the federal city of Saint Petersburg, Russia, about halfway between Saint Petersburg proper and Petergof, and overlooking the shore of the Gulf of Finland. Population: 

==History==
Strelna was first mentioned in Cadastral surveying of Vodskaya pyatina in 1500, as the &quot;village of Strelna on Retse Strelne on the Sea&quot; in the churchyard Kipen Koporsky County. After Treaty of Stolbovo these lands were part of Sweden, and in 1630 in Strelna appears as a baronial estate of Swedish politician Johan Skytte.

==Palace of Peter the Great==
In 1718, a temporary wooden palace was constructed in Strelna. It had been used by the Russian royalty as a sort of hunting lodge, and has been preserved to this day. A cornerstone was laid in June 1720, but next year it became apparent that the place was ill-adapted for installation of fountains, thus Peter decided to concentrate his attention on the nearby Peterhof. Disappointed, Michetti left Russia, and all works in Strelna were suspended.

On ascending the throne in 1741, Peter&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth intended to complete her father&#x27;s project. Her favourite architect Bartolomeo Rastrelli was asked to expand and aggrandize Michetti&#x27;s design. But Rastrelli&#x27;s attention was soon diverted to other palaces, in Peterhof and Tsarskoye Selo, so the Strelna palace stood unfinished until the end of the century.
==Family home of the Konstantinovichi branch of the Romanovs ==
In 1797, Strelna was granted to Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich (second son of Paul I) and his wife Grand Duchess Anna Feodorovna (aunt of Queen Victoria). Despite a great fire in 1803, the Konstantin Palace was completed by 1807. After Konstantin&#x27;s death, the palace passed to his nephew, and the Konstantinovichi branch of the Romanov dynasty retained its ownership until the Revolution.

==Vicissitudes in the 20th and 21st century==
After 1917 the palace fell into decay: it was handed over to a child labour commune, then to a secondary school. For a period during World War II, the Germans occupied Strelna and had a naval base there. Some Decima Flottiglia MAS men and attack boats were brought from Italy and based at Strelna along with German Army boats. Strelna Raid: Soviet commando frogmen attacked that base and destroyed 2 German army boats on 5 October 1943.

After the ravages of German occupation, only the palace walls were left standing; all interior decoration was gone. No effective restoration had been undertaken until 2001 when Vladimir Putin ordered the palace to be converted into a presidential residence for Saint Petersburg.
In preparation for the celebration of the 300th anniversary of the founding Saint Petersburg, the Russian government decided to restore the palace and its grounds as a state conference center and presidential residence. The general contractor of the reconstruction was the consortium &quot;16th Trust and Partners&quot;. Setl Group construction company, headed by Maxim Shubarev, also participated in the renovation works.

The renovated Konstantin Palace hosted more than 50 heads of state during the Saint Petersburg tercentenary celebrations in 2003. Three years later, on 15–17 July 2006, it hosted the 32nd G8 summit. During these summits, the world leaders were accommodated in 18 luxurious cottages by the sea-side. Each of the cottages is named after a historic Russian town. The early 19th-century stables were reconstructed into a four-star hotel for other visitors. The 2013 G20 summit was held at the palace 5–6 September 2013. The palace also held the qualifying draw for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, which took place in Russia. The palace hosted in 2021 the royal wedding between Grand Duke George Romanov and Victoria Bettarini, this been the first royal wedding to be held in the country in over a hundred years.
==Other landmarks==
Several other Romanov residences may be seen in the vicinity of the Konstantin Palace. The Baroque Znamenka, designed by Rastrelli, used to be a home to the Nikolaevichi branch of the Romanovs. The neoclassical Mikhailovka palace once belonged to the Mikhailovichi branch of the family.

Other landmarks in Strelna include a dacha of Mathilde Kschessinska and the ruined Maritime Monastery of St. Sergius, with numerous churches by Luigi Rusca. The monastery is noted as a burial place of the Zubov brothers and other Russian nobles. The imperial foreign minister Alexander Gorchakov was interred here in 1883.

The Konstantin Palace, the Trinity Monastery, Mikhailovka, and Znamenka are parts of the World Heritage Site Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments.

<doc id="1267865" wikidata="Q5682459" url="?curid=1267865" title="Haughmond Abbey">
<text>Haughmond Abbey ( ) is a ruined, medieval, Augustinian monastery a few miles from Shrewsbury, England. It was probably founded in the early 12th century and was closely associated with the FitzAlan family, who became Earls of Arundel, and some of their wealthier vassals and allies. It was a substantial, successful and wealthy house for most of its four centuries, although evidence of abuses appeared before its dissolution in 1539. The buildings fell into disrepair and the church was largely destroyed, although the remains of some of the domestic buildings remain impressive. The site is now in the care of English Heritage and is open to the public throughout the year and free entry.

==Origins==



The cartulary of the abbey begins with a statement of its foundation story, as understood at the time it was written down, probably in the Late Middle Ages 

R. W. Eyton, the assiduous Victorian historian of Shropshire, critically considered the cartulary evidence in his 1856 study of the Haughmond&#x27;s origins, pointing out that it was impossible for all the facts asserted to be true, as William FitzAlan is known to have been still a youth in 1138, when he became involved in the Anarchy of Stephen&#x27;s reign. Moreover, of the two bulls concerning the abbey issued by Alexander III in 1172, one does not mention the foundation at all, while the other does attribute it to William FitzAlan but does not give a date. Around the time of the dissolution, the traveller and antiquary Leland repeated the cartulary&#x27;s story of the foundation, with the slight variation of placing the date in 1101. A 13th century chronicle, written locally, gives the date as 1110. Eyton seized upon the earliest charter in the cartulary as giving a fairly secure date. In it, William FitzAlan grants to the community a fishery at Preston Boats, a member of the manor of Upton Magna, about 3 km south of the abbey on the River Severn – the first clear indication that the community existed. FitzAlan&#x27;s grant names the leader of the community as Prior Fulk. Augustinian communities were generally counted as priories, although large, entirely independent houses were called abbeys. The grant also mentions that the monastery was dedicated to Saint John the Evangelist and this was to persist throughout its history: a statue of St John with his emblem can be found carved into the arches of the chapter house and his image also appeared on the abbey&#x27;s great seal. The witnesses were William FitzAlan&#x27;s wife, Christiana, and his brother, Walter. The grant seems to date from the years around 1135, when Henry I died and a power contest broke out between Stephen and Empress Matilda.

However, it is not certain that William FitzAlan founded or was the first to endow the community. Leland repeats the persistent story that &quot;there was an hermitage and a chapell before the erectynge of the abbey&quot;. This suggests some value in considering the founding of the FitzAlan fortunes by William FitzAlan&#x27;s father, Alan fitz Flaad. He appeared in Henry I&#x27;s company at least as early as September 1101, when he witnessed important grants to Norwich Cathedral. Thereafter, he is heard of with the king at Canterbury in 1103, in the New Forest in 1104, He seems to have taken an interest in donations of his own to religious houses, as at some point he gave a manor to Norwich Cathedral, a gift the king promised &quot;to confirm when Alan comes to my court&quot; – evidently a regular occurrence. Only later does he appear as a witness to an order given to Richard de Belmeis I, the Bishop of London and the king&#x27;s viceroy in Shropshire, to deal with a disputed prebend at Morville, presumably a complication of the abolition of the collegiate church there in favour of Shrewsbury Abbey. Alan appears in this context among a group of Shropshire magnates, including Corbets and a Peverel, probably during Henry I&#x27;s 1114 military expedition into Wales. It seems to have been around this time that he acquired the abbey site, along with other large estates in Shropshire and Sussex. The estates had been granted by William the Conqueror to Rainald de Bailleul, the Sheriff of Shropshire, in consideration of his shrievalty, and were given to Alan after the death of Rainald&#x27;s son, Hugh. One of the most important was Upton Magna, in which Haughmond Abbey was located. Eyton places the handover earlier, around the time of a royal expedition to Shropshire in 1109. It is possible that Alan was the founder of the original priory, or even that it began before his time, as a small eremitic community, towards the end of the 11th century. Another possibility is that the community was established or nurtured by Alan&#x27;s widow, variously named as Adelina, Avelina or Evelyn, who seems to have survived him by many years.

Despite his reservations about the self-contradictory sources, Eyton concluded that the foundation date lay between 1130 and 1138 and that the founder of the abbey &quot;in all respects was the first William Fitz-Alan&quot;. However, William FitzAlan&#x27;s grant of the Preston Boats fish weir, around 1135, was clearly not a foundation grant: there was already a small but growing community when it was made. The Victoria County History account tends to give more weight than Eyton to the possibility of an earlier origin. Augustinian communities often began as small gatherings around a noted hermit before growing into established monasteries, or even small religious orders: the Abbey of Arrouaise in northern France, which had a Shropshire community at nearby Lilleshall Abbey, is an example. At Haughmond, the remains of a very modest early church were discovered beneath the floor of the later, more ambitious building, during the 1907 excavations: this may date back to the time of Prior Fulk or earlier. Despite these reservations and qualifications, the most recent account of William Fitz-Alan, in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, simply treats him as the founder of the abbey, and it was certainly he who placed it on a secure basis, even if he was not the originator.

==Early growth and confirmations==

William FitzAlan took the side of the Empress and was exiled from the region from 1138 until at least 1153. However, endowments continued in FitzAlan&#x27;s absence. The Empress gave Haughmond land and a mill in Walcot, Shropshire. The land grant at least is generally thought to date from Matilda&#x27;s time at Oxford in the summer of 1141, when she temporarily had the upper hand in the civil war. The abbey took the precaution of getting Stephen&#x27;s approval for these valuable gifts – assuming that Stephen&#x27;s grant of the same property actually was later, which is not absolutely certain. When Henry, Duke of Normandy, the future Henry II, appeared in England in 1153, he was induced to issue a charter at Leicester, confirming his mother&#x27;s grants. This strategy of obtaining triple grants during the Anarchy was followed also by Lilleshall Abbey.

An early benefactor of Haughmond was Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester, who donated the right to fish in the Dee and take 6000 salt fish free of tolls. Ranulf brought a number of Welsh magnates into the civil war, initially on the Angevin side. This brought gifts of some Welsh churches to the abbey, including that at Trefeglwys, in Arwystli, and at that at Nefyn, which was donated by Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd. In 1155, the year after Henry II took the throne, his supporter, William FitzAlan, finally regained his Shropshire estates. William then donated the church at Wroxeter to Haughmond. This was a portionary church – staffed by a number of canons, dividing the income, but not forming a structured college. FitzAlan stipulated that the abbot must maintain five secular clergy at Wroxeter and send five canons to participate in the celebration of the feasts of St Andrew, St George, and St Denis. He also declared he would increase the number of canons at Wroxeter, thus benefiting Wroxeter and Haughmond simultaneously. He declared this was &quot;so that they might have a full convent&quot;, implying that he intended the church to evolve into a college, probably as a family chantry. If that was his intention, it never materialised. Notably, the donation refers to &quot;Abbas de Haghmon&quot;, the Abbot of Haughmond, indicating that the house had grown in size and status.

As the wealth of the abbey increased, the rebuilding of the church and abbey was begun. Over the next twenty years it was constructed in a late Romanesque style, funded mainly by the FitzAlans and their vassals, especially the Lestrange family. However, there were royal donations, including assarts around the abbey site, which were granted by an early charter of Henry II. These signalled that the abbey was closely associated politically with the Angevin dynasty. This was reinforced by the appointment of Alured, the king&#x27;s former tutor, as abbot, probably in the 1160s. It was Alured who in 1172 obtained two bulls from Pope Alexander III, confirming the early grants, giving the abbey extra-parochial status, including the right to bury whoever willed it, and conferring on the canons the right to elect their own abbot. The king added still more charters when he was at Shrewsbury later in his reign, probably in 1176, updating the list of endowments conferred upon the abbey by that time.

==Endowments and benefactors==

The following is a list of notable properties donated to Haughmond Abbey in its first century, based on the account of the abbey in the &quot;Victoria County History&quot;.
Churches formed a significant part of the abbey&#x27;s wealth. Through appropriation, the abbey corporately took on the role of rector in the parish and thus received the tithes. It retained advowson of the church and any chapels, allowing it to appoint the vicars and curates; this would generate a substantial entry fine on each appointment. Churches provided a steady stream of income, with little cost and effort. Haughmond appropriated the churches listed above in the 12th century: Stoke, Shawbury (including its dependent chapels), Cheswardine, Ruyton XI Towns, Nefyn and Treseglwys. In addition it later appropriated the following churches:
The distribution maps available above show that the abbey&#x27;s assets were heavily concentrated, tending to form natural groups, in Shropshire. This was a major advantage that Haughmond had over nearby Lilleshall, which always suffered from the running costs associated with a widely dispersed property portfolio. The acquisition policy of the abbey tended to strengthen this advantage, deliberately buying or requesting grants of adjoining estates to increase local concentrations of land. Beyond Leebotwood, for example, the abbey built up a large composite of holdings. A grant by Henry II of meadow on the Long Mynd marked the beginning of the venture. More benefactors contributed, especially the powerful Robert Corbet of Caus Castle, and a substantial monastic estate took shape, known as the &quot;domain of &quot;Boveria&quot;”, from the Latin &quot;bos/bovis&quot;, an ox, and meaning roughly &quot;cattle shed&quot;. This land along the Wales–England border, was mostly waste when the canons arrived but quickly became excellent pasture, as the new name suggests. It fell in the Diocese of Hereford and it was Bishop Robert Foliot who gave the canons permission to turn their oratory at Stitt, in Ratlinghope manor, into church for the region. After it acquired Aston Abbots, in the early 13th century, the community built up another large group of holdings east of Oswestry at Hisland, Twyford and West Felton, and Great Ness. Wherever estates adjoined uncultivated areas, the community took to vigorous assarting. This had been specifically allowed by Henry II in some of his grants. To make administration easier, the estates were divided into 12 local bailiwicks. These were generally under lay management, but obedientiaries, canons with specific responsibilities for rent and tithe collection, were deputed by the abbots to keep in touch.

In addition to land and churches, the abbey increasingly exploited mills, which increased in number over the centuries. As Dissolution approached in 1538, profits from the abbey&#x27;s 21 grain and 5 fulling mills amounted to about 8% of its total income.

The concentration of property reflected the circumstances of the abbey&#x27;s foundation by a powerful territorial dynasty that maintained its interest in the Marches for at least two centuries. As William FitzAlan was always recognised as founder, a Henry II&#x27;s charter of about 1176 gave his successors custody of the abbey whenever the position of abbot was vacant. The first William FitzAlan was buried in Shrewsbury Abbey, but subsequent heads of the family were buried at Haughmond for over 150 years. Even after the FitzAlans acquired the prestigious earldom of Arundel in 1243, they continued to regard the abbey as theirs and to call the canons &quot;canonici mei&quot;. When Edmund FitzAlan, 9th Earl of Arundel was executed at Hereford in 1326, his body was buried there, despite his wish to be buried at Haughmond. Abbot Nicholas of Longnor protested and was able to have the body transferred to Haughmond.

Elias or Helias de Say was an important early benefactor, giving lands around Hodnet. His daughter, Isabella, was William FitzAlan&#x27;s second wife. The male line of the Clun de Says ended with Elias and Isabella passed the estates to the family of her second husband, Geoffrey de Vere, son of Aubrey de Vere I, Earl of Oxford. However, there was another branch of the family at Stokesay, to which they gave their name. The tombstone of a later family member, Olimpia de Say, is now displayed in the chapter house, having been discovered in the Cloister.

The FitzAlans also motivated their vassals and allies to follow their example in making grants. This was especially so of the Lestranges, and most especially of the Knockin branch of the family. Their interest and protection continued down the centuries, with repeated grants of land and loans. In 1342 Roger Lestrange, Baron Strange of Knockin, granted the church at Hanmer to fund a perpetual chantry at the abbey, although it was not until about 1426 that practical and legal difficulties were overcome to establish the chantry.

==Ranton Priory and other dependencies==
Ranton Priory in Staffordshire, founded in the mid-12th century by Robert Fitz-Noel and dedicated to the Virgin Mary, was the only monastery institutionally dependent on Haughmond for a time. Its foundation charter states that it is &quot;sub regula &amp; obedientia Hamanensis Ecclesiae&quot; – under the rule of the church of Haughmond – and the confirmation by Archbishop Baldwin of Forde (1184–90) reaffirmed that it followed the rule of Haughmond. It is possible that there was friction, as a charter from Archbishop Hubert Walter (1193-1205) seems very assertive in insisting that Ranton owes &quot;obedience and subjection&quot; to Haughmond. Relations seem to have been regulated by undated but probably later document, described as &quot;amicabilis compositio&quot; – a friendly agreement – between the two houses. This stated that the abbot was to visit Ranton at least annually. It gave the canons of Ranton full voting rights in elections for the abbot, although in elections for their own prior, they were to choose a canon from Ranton and another from Haughmond, with the abbot having the final say. They were free to regulate the membership of the priory, so long as all canons pledged obedience to the abbot.

At some point, probably in the late 12th century, for reasons unknown, the dependence of the priory on Haughmond was challenged by Great Bricett Priory in Suffolk, which sued for recognition as the mother house. Bricett also demanded that Haughmond give up its control of Wombridge Priory, which was still less explicable, as it had no control at all over Wombridge. Haughmond eventually got Bricett to drop its suit for a single payment of 40 shillings. However, the underlying tension resurfaced between Ranton, a fairly large house to be considered merely a cell, and Haughmond. After an appeal to the papacy, an enquiry set up by Bishop Roger Weseham gave Ranton full independence, although it was required to pay an annual pension of 100 shillings to Haughmond.

Although not dependent on Haughmond, there were other institutions under its spiritual influence. The canons of Owston Abbey in Leicestershire were ordered by its founder, Robert Grimbald, to live &quot;according to the order of the church of Haughmond&quot;. As Haughmond seems to have been an entirely normal Augustinian house, this must mean following its example in rigorously pursuing the Augustinian rule.

It seems also that Haughmond was intended to provide a chantry service at St John&#x27;s Hospital in Oswestry, which was founded by Reiner, Bishop of St Asaph (1186-1224). In return it was to receive the manor of Wilcot. It is unclear whether this arrangement was ever implemented before Reiner also gave control over the hospital to the Knights Hospitaller. This led a series of legal proceedings involving Haughmond and the Hospitallers. Ultimately Haughmond agreed to hold the hospital of the Hospitallers for a payment of 20 shillings annually to their Preceptory at Halston.

==The monastic life==
The Augustinian rule allowed for many different styles of religious life. Haughmond was certainly a community of Canons Regular but only a little is known about the precise interpretation of the rule that prevailed or how well it was followed. Generally, a financially solvent house was likely to have a better religious life, and Haughmond was generally well run. After the mid-14th century there were never more than 13 canons, although the size of the buildings suggests numbers were considerably greater in earlier centuries.

The chronicler Gervase of Canterbury noted that the Augustinians of Haughmond were &quot;Canonici Albi&quot;, that is, white canons. The so-called white habit was probably simply of undyed wool and may reinforce suggestions that Haughmond was an independent eremitic community before it was absorbed, with all such groups, into the Augustinian order. A local chronicle notes that Haughmond adopted the typical Augustinian black habit in 1234.

Augustinians were expected to observe strict protocols in contacts with outsiders, to travel only with their abbot&#x27;s permission and never to sleep alone. One of the problems at Lilleshall was that canons were often forced to undertake expeditions to the outlying estates, outside direct supervision of the abbot. This was much less prevalent at Haughmond, with its more concentrated estates, although it seems there was sometimes a need for canons to stay at Nefyn, where there was a canons&#x27; house in the early 14th century. There were also facilities, including chapels, for canons and abbots to stay on some of the granges, including Leebotwood and Beobridge. As the canons were all ordained priests, they could also officiate at chapels in the extra-parochial areas to the west, although secular clergy were appointed as soon as these communities became viable. Eyton traced in detail how the chapel at Knockin evolved, under the abbey&#x27;s control, into a parish church with a vicar. In the early years there were lay brothers to help in the work of the abbey, but they are never mentioned after 1190. There were, however, numerous paid officials and servants on the premises.

Arrangements for food and clothing altered over the years. Initially, canons were granted an annual allowance for clothing. In 1315, the Bishop of Lichfield, Walter Langton, prohibited this practice, so Abbot Richard de Brock earmarked the revenues of Cheswardine church and of Nagington and Hisland to be given to a chamberlain, who was to arrange supplies of clothing.

The diet at Haughmond seems to have been relatively varied and less austere than in most monastic institutions. In 1280 147 sheep and a calf were supplied to the abbey. Tithes of sea fish were exacted at Nefyn and the abbey had fisheries on the Dee and Severn, but it seems unlikely that fish were supplied fresh from the further fisheries. Ranulf of Chester&#x27;s grant allowed the canons to purchase annually 6000 salted herrings. These were bought at Chester on special terms. In the 12th century the abbey was granted half a swarm of bees in the woods at Hardwick: it may be that mead was made, although honey had a symbolic connection with the austere life because of its association with John the Baptist, to whom the abbey was dedicated.

Diet seems to have been improved in the early 14th century by the same process of earmarking revenues to it. In 1332 Abbot Nicholas of Longnor, as part of a more general package of reforms, issued an ordinance on the abbey&#x27;s culinary arrangements. This allocated the proceeds from the churches at Hunstanton and Ruyton XI Towns, together with those of the Dee and Severn fisheries, to the purchase of meat and fish. Longnor arranged for a new set of kitchens to be constructed:

Fuel, flour, peas, cheese, butter, and pottage were still to be provided from the general accounts. Longnor also ordained a piggery:

Two loads of flour were requisitioned annually for pastry. It is unclear to what extent the large quantities of meat actually formed part of the monastic diet, as there was also an infirmary on the premises and this must have absorbed some of the food supplies. The kitchener was ordered to render account to the abbot four times a year. A cellarer was responsible for the supply of both beer and bread, including that required at the abbey&#x27;s granges. the abbot ate from the same kitchens as the canons and could feed guests free of charge when on the premises, but he, the steward and the chaplain were to feed themselves when away from the abbey. Abbot Longnor established a substantial garden at the abbey and in later centuries a dovecote was installed there, providing another convenient source of meat.
In the absence of much documentary evidence, the abbey&#x27;s art may shed some light on the values held dear by the community. In the 14th century a number of figures were carved on the previously plain shafts of the arches at the processional entrance to the church and at the entrance to the chapter house. St Peter and St Paul flank the church entrance used by the canons to enter the church for the Canonical Hours. These were the saints most closely associated with the Papacy, from which both the order and the abbey took their authority. For the chapter house, Augustine of Hippo, eponym of the order, and St John the Evangelist, patron saint of the abbey, were obvious choices. The remaining saints were all illustrative of martyrdom, austerity or spiritual struggle. Thomas Becket, murdered on the orders of Henry II, one of Haughmond&#x27;s major benefactors, was a martyr whose cult at Canterbury was the focus for medieval England&#x27;s most important pilgrimage. Catherine of Alexandria, seen as a virgin martyr, is portrayed with her wheel of martyrdom, taking revenge on the Emperor Maxentius. John the Baptist, closely associated with asceticism and speaking truth to power, and a Biblical type for Becket, clutches the lamb and flag symbol of the Agnus Dei. He is accompanied by Margaret of Antioch, who is spearing a dragon, a female counterpart to St Michael. St Winifred, a third virgin martyr, whose relics were kept at nearby Shrewsbury Abbey, is shown with her persecutor Caradog sinking into the ground. Facing her, St Michael the Archangel, armed with spear and shield, treads down and impales a dragon, representing Satan.

==Intellectual life==

The abbey must have built up a collection of books large enough to need separate accommodation, as Abbot Richard Pontesbury complained in 1518 that the &quot;bybliotheca&quot; was in need of repair. A small number of the books have survived: a Bible; a volume of glossed Gospels; a work by Petrus Comestor, a French theologian; one by Hugh of Fouilloy, another French cleric; and a volume containing both the &quot;Sententiae&quot; of Isidore of Seville and &quot;De sapientia&quot; by Alcuin.

John Audelay was a noted 15th-century writer who resided at Haughmond. Audelay, a blind and deaf poet, was not an Augustinian canon but the first secular priest to serve in the Lestrange chantry. His accession date, 1426, is noted in a colophon of a manuscript of his work and he signs off several poems with a self-description: &quot;&quot; It is known that Audelay had some involvement in disturbances at the church of St Dunstan-in-the-East in London at Easter 1417, in which his employer, Richard le Strange, 7th Baron Strange (1381–1449), and his entourage assaulted Sir John Trussell, on the second occasion killing a by-stander. Formerly regarded as little more than samples of the contemporary Shropshire Middle English dialect, Audelay&#x27;s poems give considerable insight into the spiritual concerns of the age. Most reflect on the value of points of Christian doctrine or liturgy. His defence of the mass, for example, is clearly shaped by his own daily concerns as a chaplain. Pursuing his exposition, he brings in an example from the life of Augustine of Canterbury. The themes, which are strongly anti-Lollard, and the strategies of argument and exposition, are reminiscent of the work of his older contemporary, John Mirk, a canon of nearby Lilleshall. Like Mirk, Audelay seems very aware of the distinction between internal criticism, however trenchant, and heretical dissent. He drew a clear distinction between the work of conscientious priests and the conduct of worldly clerics. His strong emphasis on respect for the divine service may reflect his own sense of responsibility for the events of 1417. Occasionally he comments on topical concerns, as in a poem on Henry V&#x27;s wooing of Catherine of Valois or another on the succession of Henry VI.

In the 15th century the abbey contributed to the upkeep of an Augustinian house of study at Oxford, which later became St Mary&#x27;s College. The Holy Trinity Priory, Aldgate seems to have organised the collection of funds for the project, as it bound itself to repay 40 pounds sterling to Haughmond in the event of failure. However, Haughmond, like other Augustinian houses in the region, was not noted for its scholarship. The only Haughmond canon to achieve academic eminence was John Ludlow, who was a scholar at St Mary&#x27;s, and headed it as &quot;prior studentium&quot; in 1453 and 1453: he became abbot of Haughmond in 1464. The abbey was supposed to maintain at least one canon at university but was fined 20 shillings in 1511 by the general chapter of the Augustinians for failing to do so.

==Difficulties and abuses==
The abbey was subject to canonical visitation by the local ordinary, the Bishop of Lichfield. These were particularly zealous in the early 14th century, and criticised administrative and moral failings. For example, the obedientiaries who collected rents and tithes were instructed not to travel alone, and canons residing away from the abbey were ordered to be recalled. In 1354, the canons were criticised for their love of hunting. For most of the abbey&#x27;s history, however, the criticisms were few and infrequent, and it is likely that monastic discipline was generally reasonably good. More serious criticisms came late in the history of the abbey, during the time of two abbots: Richard Pontesbury and Christopher Hunt.

Pontesbury was abbot from 1488 to about 1521. His failings seem to have been mainly in management both of resources and people, revealed in visitations in 1518 and 1521. Because revenues were being misapplied, the buildings were in need of repair, particularly the infirmary, dormitory, chapter house, and library. Pontesbury seems to have complained about this to the bishop as if he himself were not responsible. Liturgical life was suffering because of lack of instruction for the novices. Worse still, canons were visiting Shrewsbury, a woman of ill-repute was frequenting the abbey, and there were boys in the dormitory.

Pontesbury was replaced, but in 1522, his successor, Christopher Hunt, was accused of fornication, as well as incompetence and negligence. He admitted the fornication but claimed he had already performed penance. Nevertheless, he was sent to Lilleshall Abbey to be disciplined, and it was said he was much improved on his return. However, Hunt managed to get the abbey into debt by £100, a considerable feat considering its excellent revenues and low running costs. Between 1527 and 1529, he disappeared from the scene and was replaced by Thomas Corveser, who had been his chaplain and one of his sternest critics. Corveser seems to have restored the abbey&#x27;s finances and reputation. He remained abbot until the dissolution.

==Dissolution and after==

Initially intended to assess the value of church properties, the Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1535 reckoned the net annual value of Haughmond at £259 13s. 7¼d. The annual income at dissolution was actually reckoned at more than £350, as the new estimate included the abbey site and the granges of Homebarn and Sundorne, missed in earlier calculations. There was a £200 threshold set by the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535, which left Haughmond and Lilleshall in being. However, the precedent and the storm of criticism unleashed by the dissolution of the majority of religious houses intimidated many of the more successful institutions into surrender. Haughmond took this step in 1539, the year before the Second Act of Dissolution. The commission to dissolve the abbey was issued from Woodstock Palace on 23 August 1539 and signed by Thomas Cromwell. A deed of surrender was drawn up on 19 September. The abbot, Thomas Corveser, the prior, John Colfox, and nine canons signed it by 16 October, acknowledging Henry VIII as supreme over the Church of England on earth. Each of them received a generous pension: the abbot £40 a year, the prior £8, and the canons either £5 6s. 8d. or £6 each. Two canons did not sign, William Rolfe who received a pension of £7, and Richard Doone, who received only 40 shillings.

In 1540 the abbey site was sold to Sir Edward Littleton, a religious conservative, of Pillaton Hall, Staffordshire. Only two years later, Littleton sold it to Sir Rowland Hill, a Protestant who became Lord Mayor of London in 1547, and soon after sold Haughmond to the Barker family. During this period the Abbot&#x27;s Hall and adjoining rooms were converted into a private residence, although the church and dormitory were already being plundered for building stone. Some of the other buildings around the little cloister continued as private accommodation, with the Little Cloister becoming a formal garden, up until the English Civil War. There was a fire during the Civil War and it left the hands of the wealthy, being turned over for use as a farm. A small cottage still stood in the area of the former abbots kitchen when the ruins were placed in the guardianship of the Office of Works in 1933.

The site was excavated in 1907 under the supervision of William Henry St John Hope and Harold Brakspear, who published their findings in &quot;The Archaeological Journal&quot;. More excavations took place between 1975 and 1979, directed by Jeffrey West for the Department of the Environment, in the north part of the cloister, the south transept and the south part of the choir of the abbey church, with the dual purpose of recovering the plan of the cloister walk and re-examining the early church identified by the 1907 excavation. Further work was undertaken by English Heritage in 2002 and is the most comprehensive analysis and survey of the earthworks to be undertaken to date.

Today English Heritage looks after the site. The site did have a small museum and shop, but this closed in 2017. The site is now free to enter and open all year round.

In 2023 the former ticket office and museum were refurbished by English Heritage and have now reopened to provide a small exhibition space and information point selling guidebooks. The site is now staffed by English Heritage volunteers.

==The ruins today==

The Haughmond Abbey buildings, like those at Lillsehall, show signs of Cistercian architectural influence. The standing remains are of white sandstone rubble construction with ashlar dressings. At the highest points, floors and lower walls were made by shaping the red sandstone that underlies the site. Most of the buildings were grouped around two cloisters. They include: the foundations and west cloister doorway of the late 12th- and early 14th-century church; the late 12th-century chapter house (which is still roofed); the west wall of the warming house and dorter; the walls of the frater and its undercroft; and the early 13th century infirmary, flanked by the abbot&#x27;s lodging to the east. Apart from a few walls, little else has survived from the western side of the site and, at the northern edge, the abbey church has completely disappeared – although the cruciform ground plan is still clearly visible.

The abbey site would have been enclosed by a perimeter ditch but this is no longer apparent. The precinct is still partly enclosed by a wall of undressed stone, around the south and west sides. The entrance to the abbey was about 130 metres north of the church, where the gatehouse has been traced. There would have been other buildings serving the community and its guests between the gatehouse and the church but these too remain only in bare outline. The remains of the artificial landscape created in the Middle Ages are discernible further to the north. A reservoir and three possible fish ponds can be identified, along with various other medieval features.

The public entrance to the abbey site is now on the south side, where the extant ruins are at their most impressive. Visitors are confronted by the elaborately decorated, five-sided bay window of the abbot&#x27;s private quarters. This is of very late date – probably the second half of the 15th century. The accommodation for the abbots became steadily more luxurious and more private throughout the history of the abbey. Beyond the window are remains of the 12th-century abbot&#x27;s rooms, which were on a far more modest scale. The large and impressive abbot&#x27;s hall, with its great west window of six lights, was built in the 14th century, partly over some of the 12th-century abbot&#x27;s buildings. Below the window doorways led to the service buildings: remains and traces of these mainly 12th-century structures are still visible beyond the western end of the hall. This southern end of the site was considerably modified but preserved after the dissolution, when it was used as a family residence.

From the western side of the ruins, the abbot&#x27;s hall window remains the dominant structure, but walls of the kitchen and dining areas and of the main cloister are easily made out beyond it. It is possible to walk through the entrance to the undercroft of the frater or refectory, below the great west refectory window, which would once have been an impressive structure when it was inserted in the 13th century. The refectory and its undercroft separated the little cloister to the south from the larger northern cloister. The undercroft was the main storage area for provisions, which were brought in through its western entrance from the abbey grounds. A sluice supplied by a stream is on the northern side of the undercroft. The undercroft linked via service steps to the frater above, and by a door to the kitchens, which lay along the western side of the little cloister. The large fireplaces in the west wall of the kitchen range are still very prominent. The frater, being on the upper floor, has gone, but the main cloister wall closest its entrance has two large, arched niches that contained the lavers for the canons&#x27; ceremonial ablution before meals. It is not clear how water was supplied to the lavers and all trace of the wash basins has disappeared.

The main cloister was a large, almost square, open area, not arcaded like the little cloister, but open to the sky. It gave access to the main theatres of communal life: the refectory, the chapter house, the canons&#x27; dorter and the church itself.

The chapter house is of exceptional quality and in a good state of preservation. It is fronted by three heavily decorated round arches of the late 13th century, the larger centre arch a doorway and the flanking arches originally windows. The shafts between were built with carved capitals, but a series of sculptures of saints was added to them in the 14th century. The chapter house was substantially remodelled in the 16th century, perhaps subsequent to the complaints about its condition under Abbot Pontesbury. There is no trace of the original seating, which would have allowed the canons to sit around the walls of the building. The chapter house was demolished after the dissolution, apart from the western arches and south side, with another building taking its place. This was fitted with an impressive moulded, wooden ceiling, probably moved from another part of the abbey. This remains in place. The parlour would have been next to the chapter house but nothing remains of it.

The church is the most completely ruined part of the site, with little in the way of upstanding walls. A single Norman architecture arched doorway, leading from the cloister into the nave of the church shows fine foliage moulding, with the sculptured figures of St Peter and Saint Paul either side of the opening. This is on the south side of the church&#x27;s western end – an austere choice, apparently unaltered. Lilleshall and most similar abbeys had their processional door near close to the transept and dorter, and many had night stairs for the convenience of the monks or canons. At Haughmond the canons had to cross the cloisters, in all weathers, and all times of day and night. There are traces of an early 12th-century church, found during excavations, close to the south transept. However, the easily discerned cruciform plan of the late 12th-century building provides the main framework. The natural upward slope to the east was used to create a symbolism of spiritual ascent, with steps leading from the nave to the choir, and more from the choir to the sanctuary and high altar – a rise of about four metres. The church was about 60 metres (almost exactly 200 feet) in length – about the same as at Lilleshall, which it seems to have resembled closely – and originally aisleless. However, an aisle and porch were added on the northern side in the 13th century. A chapel was added to the northern side of the presbytery in the 15th: this may have been the chapel of St Anne, where the canons served the Le Strange chantry around 1480. Burials of lay benefactors took place in the church and elsewhere on the site: the graves of Richard FitzAlan, 8th Earl of Arundel (died 1302) and his mother, Isabella Mortimer, Countess of Arundel (died c. 1292), both very important benefactors, are marked in the sanctuary area.

The remains of the canon&#x27;s dorter or dormitory are slight. It was probably a two-storey building, with the bottom floor used for storage – like the frater – and for a warming house. At the northern end, the dorter is backed by Longnor&#x27;s Garden, the area set out by the abbot for culinary and medicinal herbs, which contained a dovecote in the 15th century. The present guidebook suggests that the dorter was divided in the 15th century to provide quarters for the prior, the abbot&#x27;s deputy. However, the text of the 1459 agreement between Abbot Richard Burnell and the canons, covering the responsibilities of the prior, suggests that the prior&#x27;s quarters were under the dorter, with an entrance from the cloister, next to the parlour, and access to Longnor&#x27;s garden at the rear. They had been refurbished at considerable cost and effort by a former prior, William of Shrewsbury, then still living, and were to pass to his successors only after his death. At the southern end of the dorter, a doorway led to the reredorter, the communal washing and latrine block. Although the facilities themselves have gone, there is a very clear length of stone drain, still supplied by a diverted stream.

<text>Reichenbach im Vogtland is a town in the Vogtlandkreis district of Saxony in eastern Germany. With a population of 20,108, it is the second-largest town in the Vogtlandkreis after Plauen. It is located close to the A72 between Plauen (at c. 18 km) and Zwickau (at c. 19 km).

==History==
The town of Reichenbach im Vogtland dates back to a settlement of the Franks and owes its early growth to its privileged situation in a valley close to Mylau Castle. In 1212, it was officially named &quot;Richenbach&quot;, possibly because of the many wetland basins (German: &quot;Bächen&quot;) located in what is today the old town. Reichenbach was granted town privileges around 1240 and mentioned in a 1271 decree as &quot;civitatis richenbach&quot;, a town with autonomous rights to self-defence, trade, and municipal elections. Much of the Reichenbach history was lost in the town fires of 1720, 1773, and 1833. The foundations of the Ss. Peter and Paul parish church still date back to the 12th century.
The rise of industrialisation allowed the town to grow further, again promoted by its accessibility. Sewing and weaving were Reichenbach&#x27;s main trades, but in the 19th century the metal working industry settled in the city and in the early 20th century, there was a rise of the pulp and paper industry and printing works. Some of Reichenbach&#x27;s most remarkable structures date from this era, including its town hall (1837–1839), the railway station (1846), and world&#x27;s largest brick bridge, the Göltzsch Viaduct (1846–1851).

Reichenbach im Vogtland has had a rather insignificant role in World War II. The town was the cremation site of many prisoners of various nationalities, who died in the subcamp of the Flossenbürg concentration camp located in nearby Lengenfeld. On March 21, 1945, American bombings killed 161 citizens and destroyed or damaged many buildings. 
Against the orders of the National Socialists, Mayor Otto Schreiber capitulated the town on April 17 without a fight. The town was occupied by American troops, who handed over control to the Red Army on July 1. About 120 innocent youth aged 15 and 16 were taken in custody and transferred to the Soviet Union&#x27;s secret service (predecessor of the KGB), hoping all other citizens would be spared.

After Germany was split up, Reichenbach im Vogtland became part of East Germany. The population has since declined from nearly 35,000 to little over 20,000 today. As was the case with many former East German industrial cities, the 1991 German reunification caused many workers to lose their jobs and they started to move away. Many initiatives have since been deployed to rebuild the local economy. There are still many industrial buildings in Reichenbach with a high historic value, but with little appeal.

The administrative district of Reichenbach has grown since the early 20th century to include the quarters and villages of Brunn (1994), Cunsdorf (1924), Friesen (1994), Mylau (2016), Obermylau (2016), Oberreichenbach (1908), Rotschau (1996), and Schneidenbach (1999), and has had a collaborative relationship with Heinsdorfergrund since 2000. Schneidenbach joined on 1 January 1999, and Mylau on 1 January 2016.

<doc id="1267887" wikidata="Q33948" url="?curid=1267887" title="Masbateño language">
<text>Masbateño or Minasbate is a member of Central Philippine languages and of the Bisayan subgroup of the Austronesian language family spoken by more than 724,000 people in the province of Masbate and some parts of Sorsogon in the Philippines. Masbatenyo (sometimes written as &quot;Masbateño&quot;) is the name used by the speakers of the language and for themselves, although the term &quot;Minásbate&quot; is sometimes also used to distinguish the language from the people. It has 350,000 speakers , with 50,000 who speak it as their first language. About 250,000 speakers use it as their second language.

Masbatenyo is closely related to Capiznon, with 79% lexical similarity, and Hiligaynon, with 76% lexical similarity. Waray language is closely related and significantly similar to Masbatenyo as well. It is also closely related to Waray Sorsogon language, the language of Sorsogon. This is because Masbate was once part of Sorsogon Province and was governed from Sorsogon City until the 1920s. It has three major dialects: the western dialect centered around the town of Balud on the western coast which is close to Capiz, the southern dialect centered about the town of Cataingan in the southeastern part of Masbate, and the northern dialect covering the whole northern half of Masbate and centered on Masbate City.

== Etymology ==
There are several accounts on the origins of the word &quot;Masbate&quot;. One account says that it came from the words &#x27;to mix&#x27; and &#x27;to beat&#x27;. The other account says it came from &#x27;heard better&#x27; as in &#x27;Get down here and get closer so that we can hear better whatever you&#x27;re saying.&#x27; Another account further says that it came from the term that Cebuano migrants used to describe the place, , which means &#x27;a place where living condition is worse&#x27;.

According to a certain Fray Martin de Rada, Masbate took its name from or which means &#x27;having many gold mines&#x27;. Another claims that the name Masbate came from &quot;Masbad.&quot; The term &quot;Masbad&quot; possibly originated from &quot;Masbaranon,&quot; a barrio that used to be part of the jurisdiction of the Municipality of Placer but is now under the Municipality of Esperanza. This barrio used to be called &quot;Surosimbahan&quot; because it looks like a church. Its name was then changed &quot;Agoho&quot; from the tree called &quot;agoho.&quot; Then, for the third time, its name was changed to &quot;Masbaranon&quot; because of the supposed abundance of small fish called .

== Dialects ==
Wolfenden identified three major dialects of Masbatenyo: the western dialect centered around the town of Balud on the western coast which is close to Capiz, the southern dialect centered about the town of Cataingan in the southeastern part of Masbate and the northern dialect covering the whole northern half of Masbate and centered on Masbate City, the capital.

== Masbatenyo and its neighboring languages ==
Wolfenden reported that although Sorsogon (the southernmost province of Bicol) and Masbate are very much closer to Bicol Peninsula, Sorsoganon and Masbatenyo shared the same grammatical systems which are rather closer to those of Waray and Hiligaynon, the trade languages in the Visayas, rather than that of Bicol.

The presence of competing grammatical and lexical subsystems in the language is the most striking characteristic of Masbatenyo. This has probably been brought on by the influx of settlers from surrounding major language groups who mixed in elements of their language with and alongside of the Masbatenyo. This results to a number of semantic concepts that can be expressed by two to five alternate different words for a single concept.

This led Wolfenden to think that Masbatenyo is unique in the sense of its being a mixed-up language. Speakers of the language often thought that their language is just a mixture of its neighboring languages which are Bikol, Waray-Waray, Cebuano, Hiligaynon and Tagalog. There are still who refer to their own speech as &#x27;Bisaya&#x27;.

Masbatenyo shares different types of mutual intelligibility with its neighboring languages. Speakers of Masbatenyo can easily and conveniently converse with speakers of the neighboring languages using their own language. However, speakers of Cebuano, Waray or Hiligaynon would sometimes find it difficult to understand Masbatenyo because of its lexicon. Furthermore, Zorc considered Masbatenyo, together with Kinaray-a, Bulalakaw, Hiligayon, Waray, and Surigaonon, as &quot;linking dialects&quot; because they serve as &quot;centers of dialect complexes&quot;.

McFarland presented different views on the classification of the language spoken in Masbate. One view excluded Masbate and the southern part of Sorsogon from the Bikol area on the grounds that the language spoken in these areas was not Bikol. The other view considered the language as dialect of Bikol.

Other claim on the language of Masbate was that &#x27;the language and dialects of Masbate are basically Visayan, with the major influence being Cebuano.&#x27; Zorc made a subgrouping and reconstruction of the Bisayan dialects and included Masbatenyo in his work. He stated that while it is true that there are immigrants from the areas that speak Bikol, Cebuano and Hiligaynon languages, the &quot;native dialect&quot; throughout the island is Masbatenyo.

Zorc presented four types of intelligibility among the Bisayan languages and dialects: a) natural or primary intelligibility, where speakers of different dialects can communicate freely, even they never hear the other dialect before (e.g. Bulalakawnon and Ratagnon, Capiznon and Hiligaynon); b) learned or secondary intelligibility, where speakers can adjust to another dialect in a matter of time (e.g. Bulalakawnon and Aklanon); c) sesquilingualism, whereby a speaker is fluent in his native language (dialect), but can only understand (not speak) another (Waray and Cebuano, where speakers of both languages can understand both perfectly but speakers of Cebuano understand Waray poorly); and d) one-way intelligibility, whereby A understands B but B does not understand A.

Masbatenyo speakers in the town of Masbate belong to the fourth kind. The residents of the town can readily understand the speech of the outsiders but the outsiders cannot understand the speech of the local residents. Speakers can understand Sorsoganon, Capiznon, Hiligaynon, and Cebuano but the latter experience varying degrees of difficulty in understanding Masbatenyo.

Regarding the duration of the Bisayan occupancy of the Central Philippines, Zorc reported that there are no pre-Hispanic writings that would account for their existence in the area. Zorc stipulated that current speakers of many of the Bisayan languages and dialects could have given up their original languages long ago in favor of an intrusive or more prestigious language, or in favor of the language already spoken in the region that they invaded and conquered.

== Orthography ==
In 2016, researchers from the Dr. Emilio B. Espinosa Sr. Memorial State College of Agriculture and Technology (DEBESMSCAT) together with the members of newly established Minasbate Language Society, composed of various stakeholders from Masbate, developed a working orthography on the language based on the discussions in the 1st Minasbate Orthography Congress.

The Minasbate Working Orthography distinguishes between the native Minasbate orthography and the extended working orthography.

===Native Minasbaté Orthography===
# The following symbols are used in the native Minasbaté orthography:
#:Aa, Bb, Dd, Gg, Hh, Ii, Kk, Ll, Mm, Nn, NGng, Pp, Rr, Ss, Tt, Uu, Ww, Yy, ` (for glottal stop)
# Minasbaté has three phonemic vowels (V): Aa, Ii, Uu and 16 consonants (C): Bb, Dd, Gg, Hh, Kk, Ll, Mm, Nn, NGng, Pp, Rr, Ss, Tt, Ww, Yy, ` (for glottal stop).
# The glottal stop is a distinct consonant sound in Minasbaté and part of its alphabet. The grave accent ( ` ) will be used to represent the glottal stop.
#* The glottal stop may occur between a C and V, e.g , 
#* It may also occur in the final position of the word, e.g. , 
#* The glottal may also occur between two V, e.g. , , ,
#* The glottal stop is also the obligatory onset of the written syllable that begins with a vowel. It will be symbolized when the word begins with a vowel, e.g. , , 
# The syllable pattern of Minasbaté words is CV and CVC, e.g. &quot;= CV.CVC.&quot;
#* All Cs can occur in the beginning of a word (onset) or ending (coda). Examples: &#x27;thirsty,&#x27; &#x27;to catch&#x27;
#* All Vs are used to form a syllable nucleus. Examples:
# In writing stress or accent, the acute accent ( &#x27; ) above the V is used, e.g. , &#x27;alive&#x27;, , &#x27;big&#x27;, &#x27;noise&#x27;.
#* A stressed non-final syllable is usually lengthened. For example, in the case of &#x27;life&#x27; vs &#x27;alive&#x27;, the syllable in &#x27;life&#x27; is longer than the syllable in &#x27;alive&#x27;.
#* It is possible to have more than one stress in a word, e.g. , .
#* The stress is symbolized by the acute accent ( &#x27; ) if it falls on the last syllable, e.g. , . The stress may not be symbolized if it falls on the penultimate syllable, e.g. &#x27;night&#x27;, &#x27;eyebrow&#x27;.

===Extended Orthography===
The inclusion of borrowed terms in native Minasbaté vocabulary has resulted in the change in the structure of the language. There is a need to develop an extended orthography to accommodate these words.

# The extended orthography will consist of the following:
#: Aa &quot;ey&quot;, Bb &quot;bi&quot;, Cc &quot;si&quot;, Dd &quot;di&quot;, Ee &quot;I&quot;, Ff &quot;ef&quot;, Gg &quot;ji&quot;, Hh &quot;eych&quot;, Ii &quot;ay&quot;, Jj &quot;jey&quot;, Kk &quot;key&quot;, Ll &quot;el&quot;, Mm &quot;em&quot;, Nn &quot;en&quot;, Ññ &quot;enye&quot;, NGng &quot;en ji&quot;, Oo &quot;o&quot;, Pp &quot;pi&quot;, Qq &quot;kyu&quot;, Rr &quot;ar&quot;, Ss &quot;es&quot;, Tt &quot;ti&quot;, Uu &quot;yu&quot;, Vv &quot;vi&quot;, Ww &quot;dobol yu&quot;, Xx &quot;eks&quot;, Yy &quot;way&quot;, Zz &quot;zi&quot;, ` (for glottal stop)
# All Minasbaté words (native and borrowed) use &quot;a, i, e, o&quot; and &quot;u&quot;. The &quot;i&quot; and &quot;e&quot; are indistinct and alternate in written native words and so are/do &quot;o&quot; and &quot;u.&quot; The alternation rules are explained below. The &quot;i&quot; and &quot;e&quot; are distinct in borrowed words (e.g. vs. ).
# The use of the back vowels &quot;&quot;u&quot; and &quot;o&quot;:
#* If the word has only one back vowel sound that occurs in the ultimate position, &quot;o&quot; is used. Examples: , , , , , , , . Exceptions: 
#* If the word has more than two back vowels, &quot;u&quot; is used in the second or third to the last syllable and &quot;o&quot; is used in the final syllable. Examples: , , , , , , , , 
#* &quot;O&quot; in borrowed words is retained in writing. Example: , , 
# The use of front vowels &quot;i&quot; and &quot;e&quot;&quot;:
#* All Minasbaté words with an &quot;i&quot; sound will be written as &quot;i&quot;. Examples: , , , , , , , 
#* &quot;e&quot; in borrowed words will be retained in writing. Examples: , , , , , , ; &quot;i&quot; will be used to represent the front vowel (&quot;i&quot;) that is added in the original form of borrowed words. Examples: for , for sponsor&quot;, for smuggle&quot;
# The hyphen will be used in the following instances:
#* Reduplication of full words, e.g. &#x27;toy&#x27;, &#x27;little house&#x27;, &#x27;improvised stove&#x27;
#* Compound words, e.g. &#x27;conjunctivitis&#x27;, &#x27;very easy&#x27;, &#x27;indecisive&#x27;
#* Affixation of borrowed words that are proper names, e.g. 
#* Time expressions, e.g. , , 
# The hyphen will be used in the following instances:
#* Partial reduplication of the word, e.g. , not ; , not 
#* Affixation of native root words, e.g. , not ; , not 
#* Affixation of borrowed verbs and nouns, e.g. , not ; , not 
#* Linkers, , not .
# In writing borrowed words, the equivalent sounds in the native Minasbaté will be used to represent the borrowed sounds. The following symbols are used to represent the borrowed sounds:

8. Consonant clusters exist in both native and borrowed words in Minasbaté.
:* In representing the off-glides or the sequence of &quot;u&quot; and &quot;w,&quot; and &quot;i&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, the vowels are dropped and the &quot;w&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are used, e.g. instead of , instead of , instead of .

9. The apostrophe symbol ( &#x27; ) is used in contracted words. The particles and are often contracted to the immediately preceding word if it ends in either a glottal or vowel sound. The unstressed vowel can also be deleted in fast speech.

== Phonology ==
Masbatenyo has 19 segmental phonemes: 16 consonant sounds and three vowel sounds . Post-alveolar sounds are also present as a result of loanwords. has the mid front unrounded, lax vowel (written orthographically as &quot;e&quot;) as its variant; has the mid back rounded lax (written orthographically as &quot;o&quot;) as its variant. The sound only appears in loan words from English and Spanish and occurs in free variation with . Similarly, the sound is a variant of and its occurrence might have been brought by the interaction with the Tagalog language and the incorporation of Spanish and English loan words in Masbatenyo language.

The glottal stop is the conventional onset of the orthographically vowel-initial words, thus vowels cannot occur in initial position. They only occur in medial and final position.

There are two major syllable patterns in Masbatenyo, namely, open syllable /C(C)V, (C(C)VC)/ and closed syllable /CVC/. Most root words in Masbatenyo are disyllabic (they are composed of two syllables) and follows the CV(C).CV(C) pattern. There are monosyllabic words; however, most of them are functors that have no lexical meaning. Most of the disyllabic words contain an affix, reduplicated or compound.

Masbatenyo also has a suprasegmental phoneme, the stress, which is characterized by vowel length. The acoustic analysis of stress correlates using Praat showed that duration is the most consistent factor that characterizes stress. Stressed syllables are longer than their unstressed counterparts.

The diphthongs in Masbatenyo are: in &#x27;soup&#x27;, in &#x27;soot&#x27;, in &#x27;house&#x27;, and or in &#x27;pig&#x27;.

Consonant clusters are non-native to Masbatenyo phonology. Their occurrence in the language is brought by the entry of borrowed words from Spanish and English.

The form of a morpheme can change when they are combined to form words or phrases. Such changes are called mophophonemic changes. Among these changes are: vowel deletion; contraction of particles and , assimilation, metathesis, epenthesis and degemination.

== Grammar ==
=== Word formation ===
Masbatenyo provides support for the claim that root words are pre-categorial or neutral by themselves. Take the following examples: &#x27;big (size, abstract)&#x27; is a root which can express a property or state, as seen in: &#x27;His house is big&#x27;. But it can also be combined with certain affixes to form a process verb in: &#x27;His pet has grown already.&#x27; It can also combine with a determiner, , to form a noun in the context: &#x27;I didn&#x27;t see his child growing up.&#x27;

 is considered a verb when used in command form: &#x27;Run!&#x27; But it can be analyzed as a noun in forms such as . &#x27;His truck runs slowly.&#x27;

Masbatenyo employs the following operations in deriving new words:

# Affixation, the process to which an affix is attached to a root or an &#x27;intermediate stem; e.g. + &quot;m-&quot; &gt; &#x27;ugly&#x27;;
# Reduplication, the repetition of word or part of word to form a new word; e.g., + PWr reduplication &gt; &#x27;mini boat&#x27;;
# Stress shift, e.g., &#x27;pay&#x27; &gt; &#x27;paid&#x27;

However, the existence of bare root forms of modifiers (adjectives and adverbs) in Masbatenyo can also provide evidence that root forms also have lexical properties. Examples of this are &#x27;fresh (fish)&#x27; versus &#x27;rotten&#x27;, &#x27;raw&#x27; versus &#x27;cooked&#x27;.

=== Noun and noun phrases ===
Proper and common nouns are distinguishable from each other because they have their respective determiners; proper nouns are marked by , , and while common nouns are accompanied by , , and .

In Masbatenyo, there is a subgroup of common nouns that can be inflected as imitative. The imitative affix can be the reduplicative or the &#x27;imitative/diminutive&#x27;. The reduplicative affix – the reduplication of the whole word – is applicable to a stem that is disyllabic and has open penult (CV). Regardless of the original position of the stress, the stress of the reduplicated form is always in the penult, such as in &#x27;man&#x27; &gt; &#x27;toy&#x27;

The is attached to a stem that has more than two syllables. It also attaches to a stem that has a close penult (CVC). The stress does not shift after reduplication. An example of this is &#x27;boat&#x27; &gt; &#x27;mini-boat&#x27;

Temporal nouns can also be reduplicated and affixed with . The meaning, however, is no longer imitative. It means &#x27;every …&#x27; as illustrated in &#x27;day&#x27; &gt; &#x27;everyday&#x27;.

Nouns can also be derived from other word classes by adding nominalizing morphemes or voice affixes.

Masbatenyo employs three types of possession strategies:
# possessive clauses ( and and oblique phrases )
# lexical noun phrases ( and constructions)
# genitive case pronouns (personal and demonstrative pronouns)

=== Verbs ===
Masbatenyo verbs, like verbs in other Philippine languages, are marked for their voice, aspect and modality. Further, as Nolasco observed in Philippine languages, voice and tense/aspect/mode often interact and it is sometimes difficult to tease them apart.

==== Aspect ====
Masbatenyo is marked for aspect to show the condition of the action; whether it has begun or not, and whether it is viewed as a process or in a static state. What is important to the speakers is not a temporal relation of the activity to the moment of speaking, but the internal stages of the activity. It is not marked for tense since its action is not correlated with time.

Masbatenyo has the five aspects: infinitive or neutral, perfective, imperfective, prospective and recent perfective.

==== Mode ====
Mode describes the speakers&#x27; attitude toward a situation, including the speakers&#x27; belief in its reality, or likelihood (Payne 1997). It describes the view of the speaker as to how the action is done. The term mode, mood and modality are often used interchangeably. There are at least six types of mode that occur in Masbatenyo:
# indicative
# imperative
# aptative/abilitative
# reciprocal/social
# causative
# distributive

=== Modifiers ===
In Masbatenyo, the so-called &quot;adjectives&quot; and &quot;adverbs&quot; are similar morphologically; hence, there exists no persuasive reasons for separating the modifiers of verbs and non-verbs.

Modifiers can either occur in their root forms or they can be inflected by affixes. The first type belongs to a class of unaffixed form of statives. These forms denote that the properties they exhibit are not derived from a process or those that are possessed innately by the thing being described. Examples are &#x27;fresh (fish)&#x27; versus &#x27;rotten&#x27;, &#x27;raw&#x27; versus &#x27;cooked&#x27;.

Affixed forms of the statives are classified according to the affix that attaches to their root forms. There are three types of affixed forms in Masbaenyo:

; &quot;m-&quot; type
: The subtype inflected for by the &quot;m-&quot; replacive affix expresses the state or attribute of the referent or entity being described, e.g., &#x27;dark&#x27;.
; &quot;hi-/ha-&quot; type
: The second subtype, which is inflected for by the &quot;hi-/ha-,&quot; is used to describe measurements (depth, height, length), e.g., &#x27;far&#x27;; &#x27;high&#x27;.
; those with voice affix.
: The third subtype is affixed with voice affix.
Masbatenyo modifiers are inflected by means of affixes for four degrees of intensity: basic, comparative, superlative, and intensive.

* &#x27;Chai is a kind child.&#x27; (Basic)
* &#x27;Benj is more beautiful.&#x27; (Comparative)
* &#x27;Karl is the fastest.&#x27; (Superlative)

In Masbatenyo, intensive degree is expressed by the affix &quot;ka-&quot; accompanied by the non-obligatory particle attached to bare forms (roots), e.g. &#x27;Tinne&#x27;s voice is so beautiful.&#x27;

Intensive degree may also be expressed by reduplication. &quot;ka-&quot; intensification also co-occurs with the C&quot;uru&quot; intensification. &#x27;This rice cake is very sweet.&#x27;

Adverbial properties in Masbatenyo are rather expressed by clitic particles such as &#x27;already&#x27;, &#x27;still&#x27;, &#x27;really&#x27;, &#x27;reportedly&#x27;, etc.

=== Pronouns ===
In Philippine-type languages, pronouns replace the full noun phrases in a clause. Pronouns, however, do not take the place of nouns in most expressions (e.g. &gt; , not ), but do so in oblique phrases (e.g. &#x27;to the child&#x27; &gt; &#x27;to him/her&#x27;).

There are five important types of pronouns in Philippine languages: personal pronouns, interrogative pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, reflexive pronouns and indefinite pronouns.

Personal pronouns refer to entities already mentioned in the discourse or known to the hearer. They are classified according to person, case and number.

Demonstrative pronouns or deictics refer to entities in relation to distance, and space and also refer to their location on a timeline. In discourse, demonstratives are also used to track reference across clauses. They sometimes take the place of third personal pronouns.

Interrogative pronouns are those that take place of the nouns in questions. Interrogatives are used when a concept is being questioned and to elicit information so that an item can be identified. The interrogative pronouns are &#x27;who&#x27;, &#x27;what&#x27;, &#x27;how&#x27;, &#x27;when&#x27;, &#x27;how much&#x27;, &#x27;where&#x27;, and &#x27;where&#x27;.

 &#x27;why&#x27; differs from the rest of interrogative words since it does not replace a noun phrase but an entire clause. It consists of the interrogative pronoun and the reason particle .

Reflexive pronouns are special words which refer to the same referent in a construction. It is made up of the word plus the relevant pronoun, as in the phrase or .

Indefinite pronouns refer to entities, persons, places or times which cannot be clearly established. The indefinite pronouns can either be expressed in two ways:
# by the same form as the interrogatives plus the particle 
# by the use of the connectors &#x27;even, including&#x27;, &#x27;even though&#x27; or &#x27;if&#x27; plus interrogative word

 is a general pro-form that can be used to replace any noun, verb, modifier, or even whole clauses. Wolfenden refers to as the universal substitute. is also used to track an antecedent in a previous sentence.

=== Numeral terms ===
Masbatenyo has native terms for numbers. However, in the domain of money and time, Spanish terms are used. Numerals typically go with nouns to specify the number of items talked about. They can also modify verbs and other predicates to indicate degree and quantity of action.

==== Basic mathematical operations ====
The following are basic mathematical operations in Masbateño:
*one plus one equals two (1 + 1 = 2) – 
*two times two equals four (2 x 2 = 4) – 
*eight minus five equals three (8 – 5 = 3) – 
*nine divided by three equals three (9 ÷ 3 = 3) – 

==== Advanced algebraic operations ====
The following are advanced algebraic operations in Masbateño:
*x raised to the power of y, or in symbols, (x^y). In Minasbate, .
*square root of x, or in symbols, sqrt(x). In Minasbate, .
*x over y, or in symbols, x/y. In Minasbate, .
*one and a half plus two and one-fourth equals three and three-fourths, or in symbols, 1 1/2 + 2 1/4 = 3 3/4. In Minasbate, .

===Animals===
=== Adjectives/Modifiers ===
=== Common phrases ===

Since 2007, Roselle Park High School serves students in ninth through twelfth grades. The school has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Elementary and Secondary Schools since 1928.

As of the 2023–24 school year, the school had an enrollment of 641 students and 47.6 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 13.5:1. There were 224 students (34.9% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 82 (12.8% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.

==Awards, recognition and rankings==
The school was the 191st-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 339 schools statewide in the &quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine&#x27;s September 2014 cover story on the state&#x27;s &quot;Top Public High Schools&quot;, using a new ranking methodology.

Schooldigger.com ranked the school tied for 104th out of 381 public high schools statewide in its 2011 rankings (an increase of 92 positions from the 2010 ranking) which were based on the combined percentage of students classified as proficient or above proficient on the mathematics (88.3%) and language arts literacy (94.5%) components of the High School Proficiency Assessment (HSPA).

==History==
Upon the incorporation of the Borough of Roselle Park in 1901, the municipal school district assumed control of Livingston School, which had been constructed in the late 19th century. As the borough population grew, it was decided to construct a new school building at the corner of West Grant Avenue and Locust Street. Ground breaking for the new school, to house students from kindergarten through grade 12, was held on August 8, 1908, and the building opened to students in September 1909. The building contained 11 classrooms, three recitation rooms, rooms for domestic science and manual training, a laboratory, a library, a gymnasium, an assembly hall, and offices. The original building remains in use as the Robert Gordon Elementary School.

In 1919, the high school moved to a new building formerly occupied by the Hercules Munitions Company and located at the corner of West Clay Avenue and Locust Street. However, industrial arts and physical education classes continued to meet in the previous school building. During this time, students from the surrounding municipalities of Garwood, Kenilworth, and Springfield attended Roselle Park High School on a tuition basis.

On April 30, 1931, the cornerstone was laid for a new building for the high school to be located on West Grant Avenue adjacent to the Robert Gordon School that was to be constructed at a cost of $350,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). This building remains in use as the Roselle Park Middle School.

In January 1961, Roselle Park voters rejected a proposal for the construction of a new high school that would have cost $2.5 million to build (equivalent to $ million in ). The current high school building opened to students in September 1963. In 1993, a new wing was constructed, adding three additional classrooms.

==Athletics==
The Roselle Park High School Panthers compete in the Union County Interscholastic Athletic Conference, which is comprised of public and private high schools in Union County and was established after a reorganization of sports leagues in Northern New Jersey by the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA). Prior to the NJSIAA&#x27;s 2009 realignment, the school had participated in the Mountain Valley Conference, which included public and private high schools in Essex County, Somerset County and Union County. With 434 students in grades 10-12, the school was classified by the NJSIAA for the 2019–20 school year as Group I for most athletic competition purposes, which included schools with an enrollment of 75 to 476 students in that grade range. The football team competes in Division A of the Big Central Football Conference, which includes 60 public and private high schools in Hunterdon, Middlesex, Somerset, Union and Warren counties, which are broken down into 10 divisions by size and location. The school was classified by the NJSIAA as Group I North for football for 2024–2026, which included schools with 254 to 474 students. The school&#x27;s Athletic Director is James Foy.

<text>The Football Federation of Belarus (BFF; ; ), also known as Belarusian Football Federation, is the governing body of football, beach soccer and futsal in Belarus. It organizes the Belarusian Premier League, Belarusian national football team and the Belarus women&#x27;s national football team. It is based in Minsk.

==History==
The Belarusian Football Federation was founded in 1989. In 1992, the FIFA Federation won the right to participate in the World Cup. In 1993, it joined UEFA, which allowed the national team to participate in the European Championships, and Belarusian clubs to participate in the European Cups.

In June 2021, UEFA suspended the Belarusian Football Federation from holding any events and competitions under its auspices. The UEFA national teams and clubs did not play in UEFA tournaments, and previously scheduled UEFA Mini Football Champions League 2021 and UEFA Congress 2021 will be moved to other countries. Previously, the 2021 UEFA European Under-19 Championship, which was planned to be held in Belarus, was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, FIFA and UEFA, the European governing body for football, temporarily suspended Belarusian national and club teams from international competitions, which was later reversed, and UEFA banned Belarus from hosting international competitions.

<doc id="1267900" wikidata="Q13586526" url="?curid=1267900" title="Lift hill">
<text>A lift hill, or chain hill, is an upward-sloping section of track on a roller coaster on which the roller coaster train is mechanically lifted to an elevated point or peak in the track. Upon reaching the peak, the train is then propelled from the peak by gravity and is usually allowed to coast throughout the rest of the roller coaster ride&#x27;s circuit on its own momentum, including most or all of the remaining uphill sections. The initial upward-sloping section of a roller coaster track is usually a lift hill, as the train typically begins a ride with little speed, though some coasters have raised stations that permit an initial drop without a lift hill. Although uncommon, some tracks also contain multiple lift hills.

Lift hills usually propel the train to the top of the ride via one of two methods: a chain lift involving a long, continuous chain which trains hook on to and are carried to the top; or a drive tire system in which multiple motorized tires (known as friction wheels) push the train upwards. A typical chain lift consists of a heavy piece of metal called a chain dog, which is mounted onto the underside of one of the cars which make up the train. This is in place to line up with the chain on the lift hill.

The chain travels through a steel trough, and is normally powered by one or more motors which are positioned under the lift hill. Chain dogs underneath each train are engaged by the chain and the train is pulled up the lift. Anti-rollback dogs engage a rack (ratcheted track) alongside the chain to prevent the train from descending the lift hill. At the crest of the lift, the chain wraps around a gear wheel where it begins its return to the bottom of the lift; the train is continually pulled along until gravity takes over and it accelerates downhill. The spring-loaded chain and anti-rollback dogs will disengage themselves as this occurs.

==Intamin cable lift== 

The Intamin cable lift is a type of lift mechanism that was first used on Millennium Force at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio. This type of lift has also been used for Kings Dominion&#x27;s Pantherian, Holiday Park&#x27;s Expedition GeForce, Walibi Holland&#x27;s Goliath, Djurs Sommerland&#x27;s Piraten (Europe&#x27;s only &quot;Mega-Lite&quot;-model coaster by Intamin), Tokyo Dome City&#x27;s Thunder Dolphin, Hersheypark&#x27;s Skyrush, Flying Aces at Ferrari World, and Altair at Cinecittà World. Currently, there are only two wooden roller coasters that utilize a cable lift hill: El Toro at Six Flags Great Adventure and T Express at Everland.

The cable lift utilizes a cable that is attached to a catch car that moves up and down the lift hill in a separate channel between the track rails. On several coasters the catch car rolls into the station and latches to the front cars of the train to carry it up the lift hill. This requires the lift hill to be positioned directly in front of the station. El Toro was the first coaster to incorporate a turn between the station and the cable lift hill and was the first (and so far only) of this type to engage the catch car while the train is moving. Once the train engages the catch car, the speed is increased and the train is quickly pulled to top of the lift. Because a cable is much lighter than a chain, cable lifts are much faster than chain lifts. A cable also requires far less maintenance than a chain. Another advantage to park guests is that a cable lift is very quiet, partly because the main drive winch is located directly beneath the top of the lift, a location which will normally be relatively far from guest-accessible areas.

==Ferris wheel lift==
The Ferris wheel lift is a type of lift based on the rotating circular design of a ferris wheel. Created by Premier Rides, it existed on &#x27;Round About&#x27; (formerly Maximum RPM) which operated at Freestyle Music Park in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina prior to being dismantled and moved to a park in Vietnam only to never operate and was later dismantled again. It uses a Ferris Wheel like motion to lift the cars to the top, as on a Ferris Wheel. The cars are then released onto the track.

==Elevator lift== 
The elevator lift is typically used on a single car or a short, double-car train. The vehicle moves into position on a piece of track that is then lifted vertically, along with the vehicle, operating very similar to a passenger elevator. Several of these systems use a single shaft and a second piece of track in the opposite position serves as the counterweight. With the single shaft the rail may curve to the left or right as the two tracks pass each other at the halfway point. The first coaster to use an elevator system with a counterweight was Batflyer at Lightwater Valley. It is believed that those same designers then founded Caripro, which then constructed nine vertical lift suspended coasters between 1997 and 2001. The Mack Rides-built Matterhorn Blitz at Europa Park was the first to use a two-track system with a single shaft.

== Friction wheel lift ==
A friction wheel lift is a type of lift mechanism in which two wheels are placed in either a horizontal or a vertical position. These are commonly used for brake runs, lifts, storage and more. The train has a small vertical lip, where the two friction wheels meet at each side. The wheels pull the train up slowly, while making a jet-like noise. An anti-rollback system is not needed, as the wheels are tight against the lip.

==Tilt lift/thrill lift section==
A tilt lift is a new way to elevate coasters. The tilt lift is essentially an elevator lift, but the elevator lift rotates 90 degrees so that the train is now vertical, with the nose of the train facing the ground. This design has not been made yet; the only places where this occurs are in the video games &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot;, &quot;Thrillville Off the Rails&quot; and &quot;Coaster Crazy&quot;. However, there are coaster designs that use the tilting aspect of this lift already. The first operating tilt coaster in the world is Gravity Max at Lihpao Land in Taiwan. The coaster was built by Vekoma. In this coaster, after going up a chain hill, the train is held on a horizontal section of track, which then tilts forwards, to become a vertical section, which then leads into a vertical drop accelerated by gravity. The Chinese company Golden Horse has made several unofficial recreations, each featuring a less than vertical drop and significantly different track elements.

==Anti-rollback device==

The familiar &quot;click-clack&quot; sound that occurs as a roller coaster train ascends the lift hill is not caused by the chain itself. The cause for this noise is actually a safety device used on lift hills—the anti-rollback device. The anti-rollback device is a standard safety feature, typically consisting of a continuous, saw-toothed, section of metal, forming a linear ratchet.

Roller coaster trains are fitted with anti-rollback &quot;dogs&quot;, essentially heavy-duty pieces of metal that fall and rest in each groove of the anti-rollback device on the track as the trains ascend the lift-hill. This makes the &quot;clicking&quot; sound and allows the train to go upwards only, effectively preventing the train from rolling back down the hill should it ever encounter a power failure or broken chain.

This feature was derived from the similar feature originally used on the Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway in Pennsylvania, starting in 1846. Under the power of a stationary steam engine, railway cars were drawn up two uphill planes that had two slightly different early forms of this anti-rollback device. The entire concept of the modern roller coaster was also initially inspired by this railroad.

<text>Conquest of Space is a 1955 American Technicolor science fiction film from Paramount Pictures, produced by George Pal, directed by Byron Haskin, that stars Walter Brooke, Eric Fleming, and Mickey Shaughnessy.

The story concerns the first interplanetary flight to Mars, carrying a crew of five, and launched from Earth orbit near &quot;The Wheel&quot;, mankind&#x27;s first space station. On their long journey they encounter various dangers, both from within and without, that nearly destroy the mission.


==Plot==
Humankind has achieved space flight capability and built &quot;The Wheel&quot; space station in orbit above Earth. It is commanded by its designer, Colonel Samuel T. Merritt. His son, Captain Barney Merritt, having been aboard for a year, wants to return to Earth.

A giant spaceship has been built in a nearby orbit, and an Earth inspector arrives aboard the station with new orders: Merritt Sr. is being promoted to general and will command the new spaceship, now being sent to Mars instead of the Moon. As General Merritt considers his crew of three enlisted men and one officer, his close friend, Sgt. Mahoney volunteers. The general turns him down for being 20 years too old. Hearing that Mars is the new destination, Barney Merritt volunteers to be the second officer.

Right after the crew watches a TV broadcast from their family and friends, the mission blasts off. The general&#x27;s undiagnosed and growing space fatigue is beginning to seriously affect his judgement: reading his Bible frequently, he has doubts about the righteousness of the mission. After launch, Sgt. Mahoney is discovered to be a stowaway, having hidden in a crew spacesuit. Their piloting radar antenna later fails, and two crewmen go outside to make repairs. They manage to get it working just as their monitors show a glowing planetoid coming at them. The general fires the engines, barely managing to avoid a collision, but the planetoid&#x27;s fast-orbiting debris punctures Sgt. Fodor&#x27;s spacesuit, killing him instantly. After a religious service in space, Fodor&#x27;s body is cast adrift into the void.

Eight months later, the general is becoming increasingly mentally unbalanced, focusing on Sgt. Fodor&#x27;s loss as &quot;God&#x27;s judgement&quot;. On the Mars landing approach, he attempts to crash their spaceship, now convinced the mission violates the laws of God. Barney wrests control away from his father, landing the large flying wing glider-rocket safely. Later, as the crew takes their first steps on Mars, they look up and see water pouring down from the now vertical return rocket. Barney quickly discovers the leak is sabotage caused by his father, who threatens his son with a .45 semiautomatic. The two struggle and the pistol discharges, killing the general. Sgt. Mahoney, who observed only the last stages of the struggle, wants Barney confined under arrest with the threat of court martial, but cooler heads prevail; Barney becomes the ranking officer.

Mars proves to be inhospitable, and they struggle to survive with their decreased water supply. Earth&#x27;s correct orbital position for a return trip is one year away. While glumly celebrating their first Christmas on Mars, a sudden snowstorm blows in, allowing them to replenish their water supply. As their launch window arrives, they hear low rumbling sounds, then see rocks falling, and feel the ground shake violently. The ground level shifts during this violent marsquake. Their spaceship is now leaning at a precarious angle and cannot make an emergency blast off. To right the spaceship, the crew uses the rocket engines&#x27; powerful thrust to shift the ground under the landing legs. The attempt works and they blast off, the spaceship rising just as the Martian surface completely collapses.

Once in space, Barney and Mahoney reconcile. Impressed with Barney&#x27;s heroism and leadership while on Mars, Mahoney concludes that pursuing Barney&#x27;s court martial for his father&#x27;s death would only impugn the general&#x27;s reputation, tarnishing what previously had been a spotless military career. Better is the fiction that &quot;the man who conquered space&quot; died in the line of duty, sacrificing himself to save his crew.

==Cast==
==Production==
The science and technology portrayed in &quot;Conquest of Space&quot; were intended to be as realistic as possible in depicting the first voyage to Mars. The film&#x27;s theatrical release poster tagline reads: &quot;See how it will happen ... in your lifetime!&quot;

The title &quot;Conquest of Space&quot; is from the 1949 nonfiction book &quot;The Conquest of Space&quot;, written by Willy Ley and illustrated by Chesley Bonestell. George Pal had hired Bonestell to be a technical adviser on &quot;Destination Moon&quot;. This was a huge hit and Pal used Bonestell again on &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot;.

In May 1952 Pal announced he would make a film out of &quot;Conquest of Space&quot;. George Pal bought the book&#x27;s film rights at the suggestion of Ley. Universal said they had a similar project, &quot;Space Island&quot;.

In June 1952 it was reported that Barré Lyndon, who wrote &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; for Pal, was working on a script. In January 1953 Philip Yordan was working on the script. The following month Byron Haskin was named as director and Wernher von Braun would be a technical adviser. James Hanlon did the final script.

Bonestell, noted for his photorealistic paintings showing views from outer space, worked on the film&#x27;s space matte paintings. The production design of &quot;Conquest of Space&quot; was closely modeled on the technical concepts of Wernher von Braun and Bonestell&#x27;s space paintings, which originally appeared in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine and were reprinted in the 1952 Viking Press book &quot;Across the Space Frontier&quot;, edited by Cornelius Ryan.

The film also incorporated concepts from von Braun&#x27;s 1952 book &quot;The Mars Project&quot;, as well as material appearing in the April 30, 1954, issue of &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine, &quot;Can we get to Mars?&quot; by von Braun, with Cornelius Ryan. This would later be incorporated into the 1956 Viking Press book &quot;The Exploration of Mars&quot; by Willy Ley, Wernher von Braun, and Chesley Bonestell. All of these books mainly feature text that is straight popular science, with no fictional characters or story line. In addition, according to director Byron Haskin, &quot;We had Wernher von Braun on the set all the time...as a technical advisor&quot;.

Although the budget was $1.5 million, George Pal and Paramount decided not to use stars. Walter Brooke turned down a five-year contract to appear in a soap opera to make the movie. Eric Fleming was pulled out of the cast of &quot;My Three Angels&quot; on Broadway to appear in the film.
Filming started 16 November 1954.

==Reception==

===Critical response upon release===
Judgments on the quality of the film&#x27;s special effects have varied. Upon the film&#x27;s release, reviewer Oscar A. Godbout in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the effects, but was disparaging of the storyline, noting &quot;... as plots go...it is not offensive&quot;.

===Later critiques===
Film authority Roy Kinnard says, “In examining the plethora of 1950s science-fiction movies which deal with the theme of man&#x27;s journeying to other worlds in order to advance his own knowledge, George Pal’s production of &quot;Conquest of Space&quot; stands head and shoulders above the others... [I]n a ... genre overburdened with cheap and shoddy productions that are all too deserving of scorn, &quot;Conquest of Space&quot; rises above the tide of mediocrity. ... [T]he special visual effects in &quot;Conquest&quot; ... are outstanding for their time ... and they are the well-tailored work of one of Hollywood’s most gifted craftsmen, John P. Fulton. Besides the massive, graceful spacecraft shown in this film, it was Fulton who was responsible for parting the Red Sea in the 1956 version of &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;. ... It is true that the blue screen mattes in &quot;Conquest&quot; are crude [from our perspective] ... but this is hardly a technical flaw unique to this picture. Many productions of the 50s had difficulty with blue screen work, even multi-million-dollar spectaculars like &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;”. Furthermore, science fiction film authority Thomas Kent Miller states, &quot;Blue screen was used extensively in this epic [&quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;], and the blue line fringes are always quite evident throughout the movie. In fact, Fulton’s remarkable and iconic Parting of the Red Sea sequence is a great hodgepodge of intersecting blue fringe lines&quot;.

British film critic John Baxter, in his 1970 volume, &quot;Science Fiction in the Cinema&quot;, states, “&quot;Conquest of Space&quot; ... gave [George] Pal and [Byron] Haskin an excuse to show realistic take-offs, space maneuverings, and a landing on Mars ... achieved with some flair. Drama in the shape of a religious maniac at the helm detracts little from the essential narrative, and some of the detail is clever, such as the space burial with the suited corpse sliding slowly on a long fall into the sun&quot;.

Modern audiences are apt to notice the presence of matte lines. Reviewer Glenn Erickson said that &quot;the ambitious special effects were some of the first to garner jeers for their lack of realism&quot;. Erickson correctly assesses the film as &quot;a flop that seriously hindered George Pal&#x27;s career as a producer&quot;. Paul Brenner said, &quot;Pal pulls out all stops in the special effects department, creating &#x27;The Wheel&#x27;, rocket launches into space, and a breathtaking near-collision with an asteroid&quot;. &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; said &quot;The special effects are quite ambitious but clumsily executed, in particular the matte work&quot;. Paul Corupe said that often &quot;the overall image on screen that inspires awe: the Martian landscape, the general&#x27;s high-tech office, and the vastness of the cosmos. The film&#x27;s budget is certainly up on screen for your entertainment, but it&#x27;s just spectacle for spectacle&#x27;s sake&quot;. He, too, complains of matte lines, but acknowledges, &quot;the composites are convincing enough for the time the film was made&quot;. Corupe described it as the &quot;first big flop in Pal&#x27;s career. It was a major setback that saw him abandon science fiction filmmaking for five years, including a planned sequel to &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot;&quot; &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; remarks &quot;A truly awful film, &quot;Conquest of Space&quot; is probably George Pal&#x27;s worst production&quot;.

Academy Award winner Dennis Muren offers a memory of 1955: “[M]y pal Bruce and I hurried into the Hawaii Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard to see a new color movie, &quot;Conquest of Space&quot;. We were eight years old. ... ‘Reeling’ by on the giant screen, we saw a giant circular space station in orbit one hundred [sic] miles up, seemingly in orbit above me over Hollywood. Wow! And that was just the beginning. Awesome rocket ships of various shapes flew about. ... Finally, the movie ended with a skillful . . . and joyful liftoff from the desolate red surface of Mars. ...”

The film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes currently rates the film at 50% (&quot;Rotten&quot;).

===Possible impact on Kubrick and &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;===

Approximately ten years following the 1955 release of &quot;Conquest of Space&quot;, the film director Stanley Kubrick began planning his next film project following his critical and popular hit &quot;Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb&quot;. The follow-up would become 1968&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. While Kubrick planned his space epic, he made a point of viewing virtually all science-fiction movies to understand what the genre had done before, and also to learn what tropes to avoid.

Principally, Kubrick was on the lookout for particular and specific images and themes that referenced or reflected the infinity of space—its inherent magic and beauty—in other words, its ability to spark a sense of wonder. Of the myriad early science-fiction productions that Kubrick must have viewed, most were certainly earthbound B movies that shied away from the sorts of expensive special visual effects and matte paintings that would ordinarily inspire awe or wonder in casual audiences. Kubrick’s goal was to create a space tale that was thought-provoking and that included numerous images that were truly awesome (in the proper sense of the word); thus, it was his intention “to pull out all the stops”.

According to genre film authority James Roman in his &quot;Bigger than Blockbusters: Movies that Defined America&quot;: “Articulating his vision about the infiniteness of space, Kubrick use[d] America’s Apollo space program as a means to embark from. [The program’s] goal was to land humans on the Moon and return them safely to earth. . . . [W]hile the American space program [clearly] influenced Kubrick&#x27;s work, it did not provide him with the material he needed to visualize space travel and with the technology of the future. A 1955 film, George Pal’s &quot;Conquest of Space&quot; provided Kubrick with a sense of direction in his . . . pursuit of this imagery. [For example,] in Pal’s film there is [the center-piece] rotating wheel or earth station that Kubrick adapts to 2001, and he creates a poetic image of it floating and rotating in space . . . .” The goal of this exercise of viewing dozens of earlier science-fiction movies had little to do with plot elements; Kubrick simply ignored &quot;Conquest of Space&quot;&#x27;s highly-criticized story line and character development and instead focused on the film&#x27;s remarkable design. He sought high-quality, well-crafted images that would stimulate himself and his creative staff to reach higher to find the look and design of his own film.

Furthermore, the genre film authority Roy Kinnard also suggests strongly in his 1979 &quot; Fantastic Films &quot; article, “Conquest of Space: A New Look at an Old Classic”, that the visually arousing design of Kubrick’s 2001 was influenced by &quot;Conquest of Space&quot;. He says, “...the most interesting aspect of &quot;Conquest&quot; [is] its startling parallels with Stanley Kubrick’s epic 1968 production. It is a well-known fact that before he began work on &quot;2001&quot;, Kubrick watched virtually every science fiction film ever made, and it is not unreasonable to assume that he not only saw &quot;Conquest&quot;, but also found quite a bit of inspiration in it.” Then Kinnard points out a number of similarities between the two films (illustrated with photo stills from the movies)—some obvious and others not so obvious. For example, the same space station wheel in both pictures noted by Roman (above) as well as a number of set pieces.

Regarding Kinnard’s expression “quite a bit of inspiration”, insofar as the film’s two-minute title sequence was designed by Paramount’s consummate special visual effects professionals to stimulate our senses, especially sight and hearing, by concentrating evocative imagery of space and nebulae within the titles so as to induce an impression of “the infiniteness of space,” it may be that that sequence in part satisfied and fulfilled Kubrick’s requirements. It may be that a description of the scene may help some people visualize its expansiveness and expressiveness. Many things happen at the same time during the titles, which are cataloged here in footnote No.36.

Additionally, the frontispiece illustration to the introduction of Douglas Brodie’s 2015 &quot;Fantastic Planets, Forbidden Zones, and Lost Continents&quot; shows a photo still of an astronaut floating in space from &quot;Conquest&quot; juxtaposed with an equivalent image from &quot;2001&quot; and bears the caption: “The highest form of flattery: As in other genres, science fiction filmmakers often include homages to earlier works. An ultra-realistic image of likely future travel from George Pal’s &quot;Conquest of Space&quot; (1955) would be almost precisely referenced in Stanley Kubrick’s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968).”

<doc id="1267911" wikidata="Q5030064" url="?curid=1267911" title="Canadian Geographic">
<text>Canadian Geographic is a magazine published by the Royal Canadian Geographical Society, (RCGS) based in Ottawa, Ontario.

==History and profile==
After the Society was founded in 1929, the magazine was established the next year in May 1930 under the name &quot;Canadian Geographical Journal&quot;. The Society&#x27;s objective was to produce a popular magazine primarily focusing on Canadian geography. The first editor was Charles Camsell, since 1915 a fellow of the British Royal Geographical Society, as well as a geologist who had been responsible for mapping large parts of Northern Ontario, Manitoba and the Yukon. Originally published out of Montreal, Quebec, the magazine is now headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario. The magazine adopted its current title in 1978.

Typically the magazine contains articles on physical, historical, political and environmental geography, illustrated with photographs, illustrations and maps. Controversial subjects such as acid rain, clear-cut logging, vanishing wetlands, the pollution of the Great Lakes and energy sources of Canadians have also been covered in print and online. The magazine&#x27;s website contains substantial extracts from current articles and supplementary information not published in the print edition, and a digital edition is also produced for each issue.

In addition to the &quot;Canadian Geographic&quot; title, the RCGS also publishes &quot;Géographica&quot;, its French companion, and &quot;Canadian Geographic Travel&quot;, which concentrates on travel topics.

==Canadian Environment Awards==
In 2002, the magazine established the Canadian Environment Awards program in partnership with the government and private companies. This award was replaced by the 3M Environmental Innovation Award in 2009.

==Controversy==
In 2015, the magazine was criticized for allowing its editorial policy to be influenced by its sponsors. In a 2012 issue about the Calgary Stampede, journalist Jesse Brown wrote about improper treatment of horses by the Stampede. The article he filed was later edited to remove any reference to &quot;horse culls&quot;. The magazine also distributed free educational resource material to schools across the country that discussed the Alberta Oil Sands. While &quot;Canadian Geographic&quot; maintained that the material was independent of influence, it was later revealed that some of the content came from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, an industrial lobby group.

In March 2018, in light of the American magazine &quot;National Geographic&quot;, performing a public &quot;mea culpa&quot; for its history of racist depictions, the editorship of &quot;Canadian Geographic&quot; publicly announced that it would be performing a similar historical review of its published content to see if it has had similar problems.

<doc id="1267916" wikidata="Q358738" url="?curid=1267916" title="Shuttle roller coaster">
<text>A shuttle roller coaster is any roller coaster that ultimately does not make a complete circuit, but rather reverses at some point throughout its course and traverses the same track backwards. These are sometimes referred to as boomerang roller coasters, due to the ubiquity of Vekoma&#x27;s Boomerang coaster model.

== Early history ==

The first shuttle coasters were in fact the first roller coasters ever built. Inspired by the so-called &quot;Russian Mountains,&quot; these wheeled cars built on tracks found popularity in the early 19th century in Paris.

In 1884, Switchback Railway opened at Coney Island, and consisted of a car that traveled on two tracks between two towers. It was the first roller coaster designed as an amusement ride in America. The next shuttle roller coaster to be built was Backety-Back Scenic Railway, built in 1909.

== First launched shuttle coasters ==

The first two launched shuttle coaster designs were introduced in 1977 by competitors Arrow Development and Anton Schwarzkopf. Arrow built and opened three that year including Black Widow (now defunct) at Riverside Park, Screamin&#x27; Demon (also defunct) at Kings Island, and Zoomerang at Circus World (now located to Fun Spot Amusement Park &amp; Zoo). Arrow&#x27;s models used an electric motor to launch the train. Anton Schwarzkopf went with a different design using a dropped weight as a launch mechanism. This design was known as the Shuttle Loop. The first three built by that company were King Kobra at Kings Dominion (now located at Hopi Hari in Brazil), White Lightnin&#x27; at Carowinds (now located at Gold Reef City in South Africa), and Tidal Wave at California&#x27;s Great America.

Schwarzkopf later upgraded its launch mechanism to a flywheel design. The first two roller coasters based on this new design were both released in 1978 - Montezooma&#x27;s Revenge at Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm and Greezed Lightnin&#x27; at Six Flags AstroWorld, currently in storage in Plainview, Texas for Cliff&#x27;s Amusement Park in New Mexico. The first flywheel launched roller coaster that opened in Europe was Sirocco at Walibi Wavre in 1982.

In 1982, Schwarzkopf debuted variant model &quot;Wiener Loop&quot; at Wiener Prater. Wiener loop use tire propelled launch, pulls to the top and dropping forward through the station, turn right and pass the vertical loop that cross the station, and turn left traveled up opposite side hill, through the curve and loop, into the station.

==Japanese shuttle coasters ==

In 1979, Meisho Amusement Machines debuted &quot;Loop Coaster&quot; at Tojoko Land. Afterwards, Meisho debuted an improved model named &quot;Loop the Loop.&quot; It was installed at a few amusement parks in Japan, along with a variation on the model, Moonsault Scramble. Meisho&#x27;s model used a catch car lift, which pulled the train to the top of a spike before dropping it backward through the station into a single vertical loop. The train would then travel up another spike, fall back down, traverse the loop again (this time facing forwards), and enter the station.

In 1980, Senyo Kogyo debuted &quot;Atomic Coaster&quot; at Mitsui Greenland, and this model was also installed at other amusement parks in Japan. Senyo&#x27;s model used a chain lift, pulling the train onto a plateau and dropping it back downwards, similar to the Shuttle Loops built by Arrow. The train went through the station, into a loop, and up a spike, before traversing the layout forwards and entering the station.

== Vekoma&#x27;s Boomerang ==

In 1984, Vekoma debuted its &quot;Boomerang&quot; shuttle coaster, which features a lift hill rather than a launched train. In addition to the original Boomerang, Vekoma also designed the &quot;Invertigo&quot; and the &quot;Giant Inverted Boomerang&quot;. As of 2018, 55 Boomerangs and its variants are currently in operation around the world.

== Linear motor launched shuttle coasters ==

In 1996, Premier Rides debuted the first coasters ever to use linear induction motors, and in 1997 opened Batman &amp; Robin: The Chiller at Six Flags Great Adventure, a pair of dueling launched shuttle coasters.

Intamin introduced its reverse freefall coaster in 1997. In these models, the train is accelerated out of the station along a long, level track using linear synchronous motors, rises straight up a vertical tower, then free falls back down to return to the station. Only two reverse freefall coasters were built: Tower of Terror II at Dreamworld, and at Six Flags Magic Mountain, both of which first broke the 300 foot and 400 foot barriers. Tower of Terror II, however, was discontinued in 2019.
In 1998, Intamin introduced its first impulse coaster, Linear Gale at Korakuen Amusement Park in Japan, which featured inverted trains traversing two vertical towers. In 2000, Intamin introduced Superman Ultimate Escape with a spiral tower and one vertical tower. Intamin introduced Wicked Twister in 2002, a variation with two spiral towers. With each pass through the station the train accelerates faster and travels further up the towers.

== Modern shuttle coasters ==
The first modern wooden shuttle coaster, Switchback, opened at ZDT&#x27;s Amusement Park in 2015. Manufactured by The Gravity Group, the ride utilizes a traditional lift hill like most wooden coasters but ends on a tower before traversing the course backwards and returning to the station via a switch track. 

Vekoma introduced their Super Boomerang model in 2023, which utilizes a vertical lift and rotating platform to drop riders through four inversions and ten airtime moments.

<doc id="1267921" wikidata="Q5283922" url="?curid=1267921" title="Diversi-Dial">
<text>Diversi-Dial, or DDial was an online chat server that was popular during the mid-1980s. It was a specialized type of bulletin board system that allowed all callers to send lines of text to each other in real-time, often operating at 300 baud. In some ways, it was a sociological forerunner to IRC, and was a cheap, local alternative to CompuServe chat, which was expensive and billed by the minute. At its peak, at least 35 major DDial systems existed across the United States, many of them in large cities. During the evening when telephone rates were low, the biggest DDial systems would link together using Telenet or PC Pursuit connections, forming regional chat networks.

==History==
Diversi-Dial was written by Bill Basham, a computer hobbyist who ran a company known as Diversified Software Research in Farmington Hills, Michigan. The software was written while he was a resident of Rockford, Illinois. Bill Basham ran a copy of the system himself in Rockford at the time. Kim Kirkpatrick, &quot;Hubcap&quot; also in Rockford, ran DDial#2 and a lot of early testing was done between Bill and Kim. Another early Rockford site was owned by Dale Wishop (GOD) named &quot;Heaven and Hell - The World that GOD Rulz Over!&quot;. The phone company had to run miles of new cable just to accommodate the additional phone lines. When &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; shutdown, Dale sold some of his 1200 baud Applecat modems to Scott and Terri Johnson (Megabucks and Spender), and DDial #12 “Spenderz Never Inn” started up in its place, running on two Apple //e computers and 12 phone lines. All of Bill&#x27;s software followed the same naming scheme as &quot;Diversi-[something]&quot;.

==Organization==
Customers typically paid the local DDial owner a flat rate of about $5 to $20 per month. Open access to anonymous visitors (called &quot;nons&quot;, &quot;r0s&quot; &quot;JAMFs&quot; or &quot;m0es&quot;) was an effective hook to draw in paid registrations. Nons typically had a five-minute connect time limit unless they were &quot;validated&quot; by an assistant sysop, and were shut out of the system during peak usage hours.

A typical DDial system ran on a small cluster of Apple II computers, with seven connections per computer. In 1989, a DDial-like clone, Synergy Teleconferencing System AKA STS was developed for the IBM PC, but by this time it was outpaced by alternatives like GEnie. By the mid-1990s, DDials had been bypassed by the Internet and IRC, although Chicago&#x27;s &quot;God&#x27;s Country&quot;, kept an incredibly loyal following between 1985–87 and 1989–1998. Many of its users are still close to this day.

Many client software programs existed for BBS connections back then, but one in particular for the Commodore 64 was optimized just for DDial, call Eagleterm 6a. Written by Jungle Jim (Jj), aka Jim Sanders, and released as freeware and saw widespread use among Ddialers. EagleTerm6a took full advantage of Commodore 64 pulse dial modem technology, heavily optimized to find the max pulse speed of the user&#x27;s local phone connection, and rapid fire re-dial back in to beat the other callers when reconnecting, easily beating the newer tone dial modems just coming to market. During peak times, the DDial system was jam packed with callers far exceeding the number of available lines, and a super fast dialer was a plus. Later versions of Eagleterm6a were protected against reverse engineering (not de-compilable using unBlitz.)

==Major DDials== 
One DDial owner went on to become the founder and CEO of Honesty.com, the first web-based third-party Internet application corporation, focused on E-Commerce sites such as eBay, Amazon.com, and Yahoo! Auctions, by utilizing the knowledge gleaned from having run a social and community based computer system for a decade prior to initial popularity of the Web.

&quot;Point Zer0&quot; was the other long-term Chicago-area Ddial, along with Jokertown. Other Chicago-area Ddials of Note included God&#x27;s Country, Kaleidoscope, General Modem (DDial #13), Tangled Web, Twilight Zone, Spinnaker&#x27;s Pub, The Bunker (DDial #4), Cloud Nine (DDial #38), Black Magic and others. At one period of time, the Chicago area hosted over 10 DDial or clone systems, possibly due to its relative proximity to the Rockford origins of Basham&#x27;s DD #1.

&quot;ENTchat&quot;, an Internet-based DDial look-alike, was somewhat active in the mid- to late 1990s but also went offline.

In 2006, The Late Night BBS went online, utilizing the original DDial software running on an Apple IIe, but was accessible from the Internet via telnet. The system provided an authentic 1980s ddial experience, including the traditional 300 bit/s connection speed. Late Night BBS has since gone offline.

As of 2012, there are only two known DDial stations in operation:
* The Savage Frontier, DDial Station #28, has been modified to run under emulation and is therefore Internet accessible. This system served the Philadelphia metropolitan area in the 1980s and 1990s, at times under other names.
* RMAC (aka Rover&#x27;s Multiuser Active Conference), DDial Station #34, runs on original Apple IIe hardware with modems and has been constructed in an Internet-accessible manner. This system served the Dallas / Fort Worth metroplex in the late 1980s. Today, the system uses authentic DDial software with TASC/Paradise mods, and can be reached via telnet at rmac.d-dial.com.

Retro-Dial, a Linux-based chat server with the look and feel of DDial, currently has multiple stations in operation which are usually linked with each other as well as The Savage Frontier. The home station for Retro-Dial can be reached via telnet at carriersync.com.

In late June, 2013, several members of Rockford, IL area DDials held a spontaneous reunion online, connected to each other via RMAC DDial #34.

<text>The Sonogashira reaction is a cross-coupling reaction used in organic synthesis to form carbon–carbon bonds. It employs a palladium catalyst as well as copper co-catalyst to form a carbon–carbon bond between a terminal alkyne and an aryl or vinyl halide.

:* R1: aryl or vinyl
:* R2: arbitrary
:* X: I, Br, Cl or OTf
The Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction has been employed in a wide variety of areas, due to its usefulness in the formation of carbon–carbon bonds. The reaction can be carried out under mild conditions, such as at room temperature, in aqueous media, and with a mild base, which has allowed for the use of the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction in the synthesis of complex molecules. Its applications include pharmaceuticals, natural products, organic materials, and nanomaterials. Specific examples include its use in the synthesis of tazarotene, which is a treatment for psoriasis and acne, and in the preparation of SIB-1508Y, also known as Altinicline, a nicotinic receptor agonist.

==History==

The alkynylation reaction of aryl halides using aromatic acetylenes was reported in 1975 in three independent contributions by Cassar, Dieck and Heck as well as Sonogashira, Tohda and Hagihara. All of the reactions employ palladium catalysts to afford the same reaction products. However, the protocols of Cassar and Heck are performed solely by the use of palladium and require harsh reaction conditions (i.e. high reaction temperatures). The use of copper-cocatalyst in addition to palladium complexes in Sonogashira&#x27;s procedure enabled the reactions to be carried under mild reaction conditions in excellent yields. A rapid development of the Pd/Cu systems followed and enabled myriad synthetic applications, while Cassar-Heck conditions were left, maybe unjustly, all but forgotten. The reaction&#x27;s remarkable utility can be evidenced by the amount of research still being done on understanding and optimizing its synthetic capabilities as well as employing the procedures to prepare various compounds of synthetic, medicinal or material/industrial importance. Among the cross-coupling reactions it follows in the number of publications right after Suzuki and Heck reaction and a search for the term &quot;Sonogashira&quot; in SciFinder provides over 1500 references for journal publications between 2007 and 2010.

The Sonogashira reaction has become so well known that often all reactions that use modern organometallic catalyst to couple alkyne motifs are termed some variant of &quot;Sonogashira reaction&quot;, despite the fact that these reactions are not carried out under true Sonogashira reaction conditions.

==Mechanism==

The reaction mechanism is not clearly understood, but the textbook mechanism revolves around a palladium cycle which is in agreement with the &quot;classical&quot; cross-coupling mechanism, and a copper cycle, which is less well known.

===The palladium cycle===
* Palladium precatalyst species are activated under reaction conditions to form a reactive Pd0 compound, A. The exact identity of the catalytic species depends strongly upon reaction conditions. With simple phosphines, such as PPh3 (n=2), and in case of bulky phosphines (i.e., ) it was demonstrated that monoligated species (n=1) are formed. Furthermore, some results point to the formation of anionic palladium species, [L2Pd0Cl]− , which could be the real catalysts in the presence of anions and halides.
* The active Pd0 catalyst is involved in the oxidative addition step with the aryl or vinyl halide substrate to produce PdII species B. Similar to the above discussion, its structure depends on the employed ligands. This step is believed to be the rate-limiting step of the reaction.
* Complex B reacts with copper acetylide, complex F, in a transmetallation step, yielding complex C and regenerating the copper catalyst.
* The structure of complex C depends on the properties of the ligands. For the facile reductive elimination to occur, the substrate motifs need to be in close vicinity, i.e. cis-orientation, so there can be trans-cis isomerisation involved. In reductive elimination the product tolane is expelled from the complex and the active Pd catalytic species is regenerated.

===The copper cycle===
* The copper cycle is not entirely well described. It is suggested that the presence of a base results in the formation of a π-alkyne complex E. This increases the acidity of the terminal proton and leads to the formation of copper acetylide, complex F, upon deprotonation.
* Acetylide F is then involved in the transmetallation reaction with palladium intermediate B.

===The mechanism of a copper-free Sonogashira variant===
Although beneficial for the effectiveness of the reaction, the use of copper salts in &quot;classical&quot; Sonogashira reaction is accompanied with several drawbacks, such as the application of environmentally unfriendly reagents, the formation of undesirable alkyne homocoupling (Glaser side products), and the necessity of strict oxygen exclusion in the reaction mixture. Thus, with the aim of excluding copper from the reaction, a lot of effort was undertaken in the developments of Cu-free Sonogashira reaction. Along the development of new reaction conditions, many experimental and computational studies focused on elucidation of reaction mechanism. Until recently, the exact mechanism by which the Cu-free reaction occurs was under debate, with critical mechanistic questions unanswered. It was shown in 2018 by Košmrlj et al. that the reaction proceeds along the two interconnected Pd0/PdII catalytic cycles.

* Similar to the original mechanism, the Pd0 cycle begins with the oxidative addition of the aryl halide or triflate to the Pd0 catalyst, forming complex B and activating aryl halide substrate for the reaction.
* Acetylene is activated in the second, PdII mediated cycle. Phenylacetylene was proven to form Pd monoacetylide complex D as well as Pd bisacetylide complex F under mild reaction conditions.
* Both activated species, namely complexes B and F, are involved in the transmetallation step, forming complex C and regenerating D.
* The resulting products of reductive elimination, disubstituted alkyne product as well as regenerated Pd0 catalytic species, complete the Pd0 catalytic cycle.

It was demonstrated that amines are competitive to the phosphines and can also participate as ligands L in the described reaction species. Depending on the rate of the competition between amine and phosphines, a dynamic and complex interplay is expected when using different coordinative bases.

==Reaction conditions==
The Sonogashira reaction is typically run under mild conditions. The cross-coupling is carried out at room temperature with a base, typically an amine, such as diethylamine, that also acts as the solvent. The reaction medium must be basic to neutralize the hydrogen halide produced as the byproduct of this coupling reaction, so alkylamine compounds such as triethylamine and diethylamine are sometimes used as solvents, but also DMF or ether can be used as solvent. Other bases such as potassium carbonate or cesium carbonate are occasionally used. In addition, deaerated conditions are formally needed for Sonogashira coupling reactions because the palladium(0) complexes are unstable in the air, and oxygen promotes the formation of homocoupled acetylenes. Recently, development of air-stable organopalladium catalysts enable this reaction to be conducted in the ambient atmosphere. In addition, R.M Al-Zoubi and co-workers successfully developed a method with high regioselectivity for 1,2,3-trihaloarene derivatives in good to high yields under ambient conditions.

===Catalysts===

Typically, two catalysts are needed for this reaction: a zerovalent palladium complex and a copper(I) halide salt. Common examples of palladium catalysts include those containing phosphine ligands such as . Another commonly used palladium source is [, but complexes containing bidentate phosphine ligands, such as , , and  have also been used. The drawback to such catalysts is the need for high loadings of palladium (up to 5 mol %), along with a larger amount of a copper co-catalyst. 
PdII complexes are in fact pre-catalysts since they must be reduced to Pd0 before catalysis can begin. PdII complexes generally exhibit greater stability than Pd0 complexes and can be stored under normal laboratory conditions for months. PdII catalysts are reduced to Pd0 in the reaction mixture by an amine, a phosphine ligand, or another reactant in the mixture allowing the reaction to proceed. For instance, oxidation of triphenylphosphine to triphenylphosphine oxide can lead to the formation of Pd0 &quot;in situ&quot; when is used.

Copper(I) salts, such as CuI, react with the terminal alkyne and produce a copper(I) acetylide, which acts as an activated species for the coupling reactions. Cu(I) is a co-catalyst in the reaction, and is used to increase the rate of the reaction.

===Aryl halides and pseudohalides===
The choice of aryl halide or pseudohalide substrate (sp2-carbon) is one of the factors that mainly influence the reactivity of the Sonogashira catalytic system. The reactivity of halides is higher towards iodine, and vinyl halides are more reactive than analogous aryl halides. The coupling of aryl iodides proceeds at room temperature, while aryl bromides require heating.

This difference in reactivity can be exploited to selectively couple an aryl iodide but not an aryl bromide, by performing the reaction at room temperature. An example is the symmetrical Sonogashira coupling of two equivalents of 1-bromo-4-iodobenzene with trimethylsilylacetylene (with the trimethylsilyl group removed &quot;in-situ&quot;) to form bis(4-bromophenyl)acetylene.
Aryl triflates can also be employed instead of aryl halides.

====Arenediazonium precursors====
Arenediazonium salts have been reported as an alternative to aryl halides for the Sonogashira coupling reaction. Gold(I) chloride has been used as co-catalyst combined with palladium(II) chloride in the coupling of arenediazonium salts with terminal alkynes, a process carried out in the presence of bis-2,6-diisopropylphenyl dihydroimidazolium chloride (IPr NHC) (5 mol%) to &quot;in situ&quot; generate a NHC–palladium complex, and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyridine (DBMP) as base in acetonitrile as solvent at room temperature. This coupling can be carried out starting from anilines by formation of the diazonium salt followed by &quot;in situ&quot;
Sonogashira coupling, where anilines are transformed into diazonium salt and furtherly converted into alkyne by coupling with phenylacetylene.

===Alkynes===
Various aromatic alkynes can be employed to yield desired disubstituted products with satisfactory yields. Aliphatic alkynes are generally less reactive.

===Bases===
Due to the crucial role of base, specific amines must be added in excess or as solvent for the reaction to proceed. It has been discovered that secondary amines such as piperidine, morpholine, or diisopropylamine in particular can react efficiently and reversibly with &quot;trans&quot;– complexes by substituting one ligand. The equilibrium constant of this reaction is dependent on R, X, a factor for basicity, and the amine&#x27;s steric hindrance. The result is competition between the amine and the alkyne group for this ligand exchange, which is why the amine is generally added in excess to promote preferential substitution.

===Protecting groups===
Trimethylsilylacetylene is a commonly used reagent in Sonogashira couplings. Being a liquid it is a more convenient reagent than the gaseous acetylene, and the trimethylsilyl group prevents addition onto the other end of the acetylene group. The trimethylsilyl group can then be removed using TBAF, yielding a monosubstituted acetylene. It may also be removed using DBU in situ, allowing the monosubstituted acetylene to react further with another aryl halide to form diphenylacetylene and derivatives.

==Reaction variations==
===Copper-free Sonogashira coupling===
While a copper co-catalyst is added to the reaction to increase reactivity, the presence of copper can result in the formation of alkyne dimers. This leads to what is known as the Glaser coupling reaction, which is an undesired formation of homocoupling products of acetylene derivatives upon oxidation. As a result, when running a Sonogashira reaction with a copper co-catalyst, it is necessary to run the reaction in an inert atmosphere to avoid the unwanted dimerization. Copper-free variations to the Sonogashira reaction have been developed to avoid the formation of the homocoupling products. There are other cases when the use of copper should be avoided, such as coupling reactions involving substrates which potential copper ligands, for instance free-base porphyrins.

===Inverse Sonogashira coupling===
In an inverse Sonogashira coupling the reactants are an aryl or vinyl compound and an alkynyl halide.

===Catalyst variations===
====Silver co-catalysis====
In some cases stoichiometric amounts of silver oxide can be used in place of CuI for copper-free Sonogashira couplings.

====Nickel catalysts====
Recently, a nickel-catalyzed Sonogashira coupling has been developed which allows for the coupling of non-activated alkyl halides to acetylene without the use of palladium, although a copper co-catalyst is still needed. It has also been reported that gold can be used as a heterogeneous catalyst, which was demonstrated in the coupling of phenylacetylene and iodobenzene with an Au/CeO2 catalyst. In this case, catalysis occurs heterogeneously on the Au nanoparticles, with Au(0) as the active site. Selectivity to the desirable cross coupling product was also found to be enhanced by supports such as CeO2 and La2O3. Additionally, iron-catalyzed Sonogashira couplings have been investigated as relatively cheap and non-toxic alternatives to palladium. Here, FeCl3 is proposed to act as the transition-metal catalyst and Cs2CO3 as the base, thus theoretically proceeding through a palladium-free and copper-free mechanism.
While the copper-free mechanism has been shown to be viable, attempts to incorporate the various transition metals mentioned above as less expensive alternatives to palladium catalysts have shown a poor track record of success due to contamination of the reagents with trace amounts of palladium, suggesting that these theorized pathways are extremely unlikely, if not impossible, to achieve.

Studies have shown that organic and inorganic starting materials can also contain enough (ppb level) palladium for the coupling.

====Gold and palladium co-catalysis====
A highly efficient gold and palladium combined methodology for the Sonogashira coupling of a wide array of electronically and structurally diverse aryl and heteroaryl halides has been reported.
The orthogonal reactivity of the two metals shows high selectivity and extreme functional group tolerance in Sonogashira coupling. A brief mechanistic study reveals that the gold-acetylide intermediate enters into palladium catalytic cycle at the transmetalation step.

====Dendrimeric palladium complexes====

The issues dealing with recovery of the often expensive catalyst after product formation poses a serious drawback for large-scale applications of homogeneous catalysis. Structures known as metallodendrimers combine the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, as they are soluble and well defined on the molecular level, and yet they can be recovered by precipitation, ultrafiltration, or ultracentrifugation. Some recent examples can be found about the use of dendritic palladium complex catalysts for the copper-free Sonogashira reaction. Thus, several generations of bidentate phosphine palladium(II) polyamino dendritic catalysts have been used solubilized in triethylamine for the coupling of aryl iodides and bromides at 25-120 °C, and of aryl chlorides, but in very low yields.

The dendrimeric catalysts could usually be recovered by simple precipitation and filtration and reused up to five times, with diminished activity produced by dendrimer decomposition and not by palladium leaching being observed. These dendrimeric catalysts showed a negative dendritic effect; that is, the catalyst efficiency decreases as the dendrimer generation increases. A recyclable polymeric phosphine ligand is obtained from ring-opening metathesis polymerization of a norbornene derivative, and has been used in the copper co-catalyzed Sonogashira reaction of methyl &quot;p&quot;-iodobenzoate and phenylacetylene using as a palladium source. Despite recovery by filtration, polymer catalytic activity decreased by approximately 4-8% in each recycle experiment.

====Nitrogen ligands====
Pyridines and pyrimidines have shown good complexation properties for palladium and have been employed in the formation of catalysts suitable for Sonogashira couplings. The dipyrimidyl-palladium complex shown below has been employed in the copper-free coupling of iodo-, bromo-, and chlorobenzene with phenylacetylene using N-butylamine as base in THF solvent at 65 °C. Furthermore, all structural features of this complex have been characterized by extensive X-ray analysis, verifying the observed reactivity.

More recently, the dipyridylpalladium complex has been obtained and has been used in the copper-free Sonogashira coupling reaction of aryl iodides and bromides in &quot;N&quot;-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) using tetra-n-butylammonium acetate (TBAA) as base at room temperature. This complex has also been used for the coupling of aryl iodides and bromides in refluxing water as solvent and in the presence of air, using pyrrolidine as base and TBAB as additive, although its efficiency was higher in &quot;N&quot;-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) as solvent.

====&quot;N&quot;-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) palladium complexes====

&quot;N&quot;-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have become one of the most important ligands in transition-metal catalysis. The success of normal NHCs is greatly attributed to their superior σ-donating capabilities as compared to phosphines, which is even greater in abnormal NHC counterparts. Employed as ligands in palladium complexes, NHCs contributed greatly to the stabilization and activation of precatalysts and have therefore found application in many areas of organometallic homogeneous catalysis, including Sonogashira couplings.

Interesting examples of abnormal NHCs are based on the mesoionic 1,2,3-triazol-5-ylidene structure. 
An efficient, cationic palladium catalyst of PEPPSI type, i.e., &quot;i&quot;PEPPSI (i&quot;nternal&quot; pyridine-enhanced precatalyst preparation stabilization and initiation) was demonstrated to efficiently catalyse the copper-free Sonogashira reaction in water as the only solvent, under aerobic conditions, in the absence of copper, amines, phosphines and other additives.

====Metal oxide catalysts====
Recent developments in heterogeneous catalysis enabled the use of metal oxide materials such as cuprous oxide nanocatalysts in flow processing technologies, which can enable the economical production of active pharmaceutical ingredients and various other fine chemicals.

==Applications in synthesis==
Sonogashira couplings are employed in a wide array of synthetic reactions, primarily due to their success in facilitating the following challenging transformations:

===Alkynylation reactions===

The coupling of a terminal alkyne and an aromatic ring is the pivotal reaction when talking about applications of the copper-promoted or copper-free Sonogashira reaction. The list of cases where the typical Sonogashira reaction using aryl halides has been employed is large, and choosing illustrative examples is difficult. A recent use of this methodology is shown below for the coupling of iodinated phenylalanine with a terminal alkyne derived from &quot;d&quot;-biotin using an &quot;in situ&quot; generated Pd0 species as catalyst, which allowed the preparation of alkyne-linked phenylalanine derivative for bioanalytical applications. There are also examples of the coupling partners both being attached to allyl resins, with the Pd0 catalyst effecting cleavage of the substrates and subsequent Sonogashira
coupling in solution.

===Natural products===

Many metabolites found in nature contain alkyne or enyne moieties, and therefore, the Sonogashira reaction has found frequent utility in their syntheses. Several of the most recent and promising applications of this coupling methodology toward the total synthesis of natural products exclusively employed the typical copper-cocatalyzed reaction.

An example of the coupling of an aryl iodide to an aryl acetylene can be seen in the reaction of an iodinated alcohol and tris(isopropyl)silylacetylene, which gave an alkyne, an intermediate in the total synthesis of the benzindenoazepine alkaloid bulgaramine.


There are other recent examples of the use of aryl iodides for the preparation of intermediates under typical Sonogashira conditions, which, after cyclization, yield natural products such as benzylisoquinoline or indole alkaloids An example is the synthesis of the benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (+)-(&quot;S&quot;)-laudanosine and (–)-(&quot;S&quot;)-xylopinine. The synthesis of these natural products involved the use of Sonogashira cross-coupling to build the carbon backbone of each molecule.

====Enynes and enediynes====

The 1,3-enyne moiety is an important structural unit for biologically active and natural compounds. It can be derived from vinylic systems and terminal acetylenes by using a configuration-retention stereospecific procedure such as the Sonogashira reaction. Vinyl iodides are the most reactive vinyl halides to Pd0 oxidative addition, and their use is therefore most frequent for Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions due to the usually milder conditions employed. Some examples include:

*The coupling of 2-iodoprop-2-en-1-ol with a wide range of acetylenes.
*The preparation of alk-2-ynylbuta-1,3-dienes from the cross-coupling of a diiodide and phenylacetylene, as shown below.

====Pharmaceuticals====
The versatility of the Sonogashira reaction makes it a widely used reaction in the synthesis of a variety of compounds. One such pharmaceutical application is in the synthesis of SIB-1508Y, which is more commonly known as Altinicline. Altinicline is a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist that has shown potential in the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Tourette&#x27;s syndrome, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). As of 2008, Altinicline has undergone Phase II clinical trials.

The Sonogashira cross coupling reaction can be used in the synthesis of imidazopyridine derivatives.

<doc id="1267942" wikidata="Q234230" url="?curid=1267942" title="Princess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia">
<text>Princess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia (;  – 26 February 1970) was the only daughter and eldest child of Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich and Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia. She was the first grandchild of Tsar Alexander III and the only biological niece of Tsar Nicholas II. Irina was married to the wealthiest man in Imperial Russia, Prince Felix Felixovich Yusupov. Her husband was one of the men who in 1916 murdered Grigori Rasputin, &quot;holy healer&quot; to Irina&#x27;s hemophiliac cousin, Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich.

==Early life==
Before her marriage on , Irina, the eldest child and only daughter in a family of seven children, was considered one of the most elegant women in Imperial Russia. Her family had spent long periods living in the south of France beginning in about 1906 because of her father&#x27;s political disagreements with the Tsar.

Irina&#x27;s father, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich, was carrying on an affair with a woman in the south of France and often asked her mother for a divorce, which she refused to grant him. Her mother, Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna, enjoyed extramarital affairs as well. Irina&#x27;s parents tried to hide their unhappy marriage from their seven children, and Irina had a happy childhood. Irina was often called Irène, the French version of her name, or Irene, the English version. Her mother sometimes nicknamed her &quot;Baby Rina.&quot; The Romanovs, heavily influenced by the French and English, spoke French better than Russian and often used the foreign versions of their first names to refer to each other. 

== Marriage ==
Her husband-to-be, Felix Yusupov, was a man from a very wealthy family who enjoyed dressing in women&#x27;s clothing and had sexual relationships with both men and women, scandalizing society, but he was also genuinely religious and willing to help others even when his own financial circumstances were reduced. At one point, in a fit of enthusiasm, he planned to give all his riches to the poor in imitation of his mentor, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna. &quot;Felix&#x27;s ideas are absolutely revolutionary,&quot; a disapproving Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna once said. He was persuaded not to do so by his mother, Zenaida, who said he had a duty to marry and continue the family line because he was her only surviving son. The future murderer of Rasputin also had a horror of the bloodshed and violence of war.

Felix, being bisexual, was not certain if he was &quot;fit for marriage.&quot; Still, he was drawn to Irina and her icon-like beauty when he first encountered her. &quot;One day when I was out riding I met a very beautiful girl accompanied by an elderly lady. Our eyes met and she made such an impression on me that I reined in my horse to gaze at her as she walked on,&quot; he wrote in his memoirs. One day in 1910, he was paid a visit by Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich and Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna and was happy to discover the girl he had seen on the riding trail was their only daughter, Irina. &quot;This time I had plenty of time to admire the wondrous beauty of the girl who was eventually to become my wife and lifelong companion. She had beautiful features, clear-cut as a cameo, and looked very like her father.&quot; He renewed his acquaintance with Irina in 1913 and was even more drawn to her. &quot;She was very shy and reserved, which added a certain mystery to her charm... Little by little, Irina became less timid. At first her eyes were more eloquent than her conversation but, as she became more expansive, I learned to admire the keenness of her intelligence and her sound judgment. I concealed nothing in my past life from her, and, far from being perturbed by what I told her, she showed great tolerance and comprehension.&quot; Yusupov wrote that Irina, perhaps because she had grown up with so many brothers, showed none of the artifice or lack of honesty that had put him off relations with other women.

Although Irina was understanding about Yusupov&#x27;s wild past, her parents were not. When her parents and maternal grandmother Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna heard the rumours about Felix, they wanted to call off the wedding. Most of the stories that they heard had originated from Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia, Irina&#x27;s first cousin once removed, who had been one of Felix&#x27;s friends and, it has been speculated, might have been involved in a romantic relationship with Felix. Dmitri told Felix he was also interested in marrying Irina, but Irina said she preferred Felix. Felix was able to persuade Irina&#x27;s reluctant family to relent and allow the ceremony to go forward.

However, neither he nor Irina appeared to have objected to the morganatic terms of the marriage: &quot;All members of the dynasty who married someone not of royal blood were obliged to sign a document renouncing their rights to the throne. Although Irina was very distant in the line of succession, she had to comply with this regulation before marrying me; but it did not seem to worry her very much.&quot; It was the society wedding of the year and the last such occasion in Russian society before World War I. Irina wore a 20th-century dress rather than the traditional court dress in which other Romanov brides had married, as she was a princess of the Imperial House, not a Grand Duchess. She wore a diamond and rock-crystal tiara that had been commissioned from Cartier and a lace veil that had belonged to Marie Antoinette. Guests at the wedding commented on what an attractive couple Felix and Irina made: &quot;What an amazing couple–they were so attractive. What bearing! What breeding!&quot; said one guest.

Irina was given away by her uncle, Nicholas II, and his wedding present to her was a bag of 29 uncut diamonds, ranging from three to seven carats. Irina and Felix also received a large assortment of precious gems from other wedding guests. They later managed to take many of these gems out of the country following the Russian Revolution of 1917 to use them to provide a living in exile.

==World War I==
The Yusupovs were on their honeymoon in Europe and the Middle East when World War I broke out. They were briefly detained in Berlin after the outbreak of hostilities. Irina asked her first cousin, Crown Princess Cecilie of Prussia to intervene with her father-in-law, Kaiser Wilhelm II, who refused to permit them to leave, but offered them a choice of three country estates to live in for the duration of the war. Felix&#x27;s father appealed to the Spanish ambassador and won permission for them to return to Russia via neutral Denmark to Finland and from there to Petrograd. Upon leaving they were belittled by the German people who called them &quot;Russian pigs&quot; and other names.

Felix converted a wing of his Moika Palace into a hospital for wounded soldiers but avoided entering military service himself by taking advantage of a law exempting only-sons from serving in the war. He entered the Cadet Corps and took an officer&#x27;s training course but had no intention of joining a regiment. Irina&#x27;s first cousin, Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna, to whom she had been close when they were girls, was disdainful of Felix: &quot;Felix is a &#x27;downright civilian,&#x27; dressed all in brown, walked to and fro about the room, searching in some bookcases with magazines and virtually doing nothing; an utterly unpleasant impression he makes—a man idling in such times,&quot; Olga wrote to her father, Tsar Nicholas II, on 5 March 1915 after paying a visit to the Yusupovs.

Felix and Irina&#x27;s only daughter, Princess Irina Felixovna Yusupova, nicknamed &quot;Bebé&quot;, was born on 21 March 1915. &quot;I shall never forget my happiness when I heard the child&#x27;s first cry,&quot; her father wrote. Irina liked her name and wanted to pass it on to her first child. Her mother Xenia was so worried over the delivery that Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna said it was almost like Xenia was giving birth instead of Irina.

==Killing of Rasputin==

Both Felix and Irina were aware of salacious rumors regarding Rasputin and his association with the worsening political situation that brought rioting, protests and violence. Yusupov and his co-conspirators, Vladimir Purishkevich and Dmitri Pavlovich, decided that Rasputin was destroying the country and must be killed. Felix started paying visits to Rasputin in an attempt to gain his trust. It has been speculated that Felix told the healer that he needed assistance to overcome his homosexual impulses and enjoy a satisfactory marriage to Irina or, alternatively, that it was Irina who needed Rasputin&#x27;s &quot;cure.&quot;

On the night of the murder, 16/17 December 1916, Rasputin was invited to Felix&#x27;s apartment at the Moika Palace. He was told that Irina would be in residence and Rasputin would have an opportunity to meet her. Rasputin had often expressed interest in meeting the beautiful 21-year-old princess. Irina, however, was on a visit to the Crimea. Irina had been aware that Felix had talked about eliminating Rasputin and it was originally intended that she participate in the murder. &quot;You too must take part in it,&quot; Felix wrote to her before the murder. &quot;Dm(itri) Pavl(ovich) knows all about it and is helping. It will all take place in the middle of December, when Dm(itri) comes back.&quot; In late November 1916, Irina wrote to Felix: &quot;Thanks for your insane letter. I didn&#x27;t understand the half of it. I see that you&#x27;re planning to do something wild. Please take care and do not get mixed up in any shady business. The dirtiest thing is that you have decided to do it all without me. I don&#x27;t see how I can take part in it now, since it&#x27;s all arranged... In a word, be careful. I see from your letter that you&#x27;re in a state of wild enthusiasm and ready to climb a wall... I&#x27;ll be in Petrograd on the 12th or 13th, so don&#x27;t dare do anything without me, or else I won&#x27;t come at all.&quot;

Felix responded on 27 November 1916: &quot;Your presence by the middle of December is essential. The plan I&#x27;m writing you about has been worked out in detail and is three-quarters done, and only the finale is left, and for that your arrival is awaited. It (the murder) is the only way of saving a situation that is almost hopeless... You will serve as the lure... Of course, not a word to anyone.&quot; A frightened Irina suddenly backed out of the plan on 3 December 1916: &quot;I know that if I come, I shall certainly get sick... You don&#x27;t know how things are with me. I want to cry all the time. My mood is terrible. I&#x27;ve never had one like it before... I don&#x27;t know myself what&#x27;s happening to me. Don&#x27;t drag me to Petrograd. Come down here instead. Forgive me, my dear one, for writing such things to you. But I can&#x27;t go on any more, I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s the matter with me. Neurasthenia, I think. Don&#x27;t be angry with me, please don&#x27;t be angry. I love you terribly. I can&#x27;t live without you. May the Lord protect you.&quot;

Again, on 9 December 1916, she warned Felix, reporting a foreboding conversation she had had with their 21-month-old daughter: &quot;Something unbelievable&#x27;s been going on with Baby. A couple of nights ago she didn&#x27;t sleep well and kept repeating, &quot;War, nanny, war!&quot; The next day she was asked, &quot;War or peace?&quot; And Baby answered, &quot;War!&quot; The next day I said, &quot;Say, &#x27;peace.&#x27; &quot; And she looked right at me and answered, &quot;War!&quot; It&#x27;s very strange.&quot;
Irina&#x27;s pleas were in vain. Her husband and his co-conspirators went forward with the plan without her. After the killing, Nicolas exiled both Yusupov and Dmitri Pavlovich. Felix was exiled to Rakitnoye, a remote country estate in the Rakityansky District that had been owned by the family since 1729. Dmitri was exiled to the Persian front with the army. Sixteen members of the family signed a letter asking the Tsar to reconsider his decision due to Dmitri&#x27;s weak health, but Nicholas II refused to consider the petition. &quot;Nobody has the right to kill on his own private judgment,&quot; wrote Nicholas II. &quot;I know that there are many others besides Dmitri Pavlovich whose consciences give them no rest, because they are compromised. I am astonished that you should have applied to me.&quot; Irina&#x27;s father, &quot;Sandro&quot;, visited the couple at Rakitnoye in February 1917 and found their mood &quot;buoyant, but militant.&quot;

Felix still hoped that Nicholas and the Russian government would respond to Rasputin&#x27;s death by taking steps to address the increasing political unrest. Felix refused to permit Irina to leave Rakitnoye to join her mother in Petrograd because he felt it was too dangerous. The Tsar abdicated on 2 March, OS, and he and his family were arrested by the Bolsheviks. They were eventually murdered at Yekaterinburg on 17 July 1918. His decision to exile Felix and Dmitri meant that they were among the few members of the Romanov family to escape execution during the Bolshevik Revolution that followed.

==Exile==

Following the abdication of the Tsar, the Yusupovs returned to the Moika Palace before going to Crimea. They later returned to the Palace to retrieve jewellery and two paintings by Rembrandt, the sale proceeds of which helped sustain the family in exile. In Crimea, the family boarded a British warship, , which took them from Yalta to Malta. Felix enjoyed boasting about killing Rasputin while he was on the ship. One of the British officers noted that Irina &quot;appeared shy and retiring at first, but it was only necessary to take a little notice of her pretty, small daughter to break through her reserve and discover that she was also very charming and spoke fluent English&quot;. From there, they traveled to Italy and by train to Paris. In Italy, lacking a visa, Felix bribed the officials with diamonds. In Paris, they stayed a few days in Hôtel de Vendôme before they went on to London.

In 1920, they returned to Paris and bought a house on the Rue Gutenberg in Boulogne-sur-Seine, where they lived most of their lives. Early in the year a disagreement between Dmitri Pavlovich and Felix brought to light Felix&#x27;s feelings towards his role in the murder of Rasputin. &quot;You talked about it, you almost boast about it, that you did it with your own hand&quot; said a distraught Dmitri in a letter trying to end his friendship with Felix. In 1924, they founded a short-lived couture house called Irfé, which took its name from the first two letters of the names Irina and Felix. Irina modeled some of the dresses. Irfé was later relaunched by Olga Sorokina in 2008. The Yusupovs became renowned in the Russian &quot;émigré&quot; community for their financial generosity. This philanthropy and their continued high living and poor financial management extinguished what remained of the family fortune. Their daughter was largely raised (and spoiled) by her paternal grandparents until she was nine. Her unstable upbringing caused her to become &quot;capricious,&quot; according to Felix. Felix and Irina, raised mainly by nannies themselves, were ill-suited to take on the day-to-day burdens of child-rearing. Irina&#x27;s daughter adored her father but had a more distant relationship with her mother.

Later the family lived from the proceeds of a lawsuit they won against MGM for making a 1932 movie called &quot;Rasputin and the Empress&quot;. The lecherous Rasputin seduces the Tsar&#x27;s only niece, called &quot;Princess Natasha&quot;, in the film. Irina was the Czar&#x27;s only niece by blood, but not his only niece, as he had three nieces from his wife&#x27;s siblings. In 1934, the Yusupovs won a large judgment against the movie studio. Felix also sued CBS in a New York court in 1965 for televising a play based upon the Rasputin killing. The claim was that some events were fictionalized, and under a New York statute, Felix&#x27;s commercial rights in his story had been misappropriated. The last reported judicial opinion in the case was a ruling by New York&#x27;s second highest court that the case could not be resolved upon briefs and affidavits but must go to trial. According to an obituary of CBS&#x27;s lawyer, CBS eventually won the case.

Felix also wrote his memoirs and continued to be both celebrated and infamous as the man who murdered Rasputin. For the rest of his life, he was haunted by the killing and suffered from nightmares. However, he also had a reputation as a faith healer.

Irina and Felix, close to one another as they were distant from their daughter, enjoyed a happy and successful marriage for more than 50 years. When Felix died in 1967, Irina was stricken by grief and died three years later.

<doc id="1267947" wikidata="Q366363" url="?curid=1267947" title="Paul Dudley White">
<text>Paul Dudley White (June 6, 1886 – October 31, 1973) was an American physician and cardiologist. He was considered one of the leading cardiologists of his day, and a prominent advocate of preventive medicine.

==Early life and education==

White was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, the son of Herbert Warren White and Elizabeth Abigail Dudley. White&#x27;s interest in medicine was sparked early in life, when he accompanied his father, a family practitioner, on rounds and house calls in a horse and buggy. A 1903 graduate of the Roxbury Latin School, his undergraduate education at Harvard College encompassed history and forestry as well as pre-medical courses. He graduated with a B.A. with honors in 1908 and went on to Harvard Medical School, from which he received his M.D. in 1911.

He then began his long association with the Massachusetts General Hospital through an internship in pediatrics and internal medicine. During that time he co-authored his first scientific paper, on the coagulation of blood, with Roger I. Lee. The Lee-White coagulation time is still used today as a method of measuring the speed of blood coagulation. In 1913, White was offered a Harvard traveling fellowship to study cardiovascular physiology with the eminent cardiologist, Thomas Lewis, in London. This experience, perhaps coupled with the earlier death of his sister from rheumatic heart disease and his father&#x27;s death from coronary artery disease at age seventy-one, was to shape the rest of his medical career.

==World War I==

In World War I, White served as a medical officer with the British Expeditionary Force in 1916 and the American Expeditionary Force from 1917 to 1919. He returned to the Massachusetts General Hospital and worked as a resident in 1919, and a year later became Chief of the Medical Out-Patient Department.

==Academic career==

White was appointed to the Harvard faculty as a clinical instructor in 1921 and quickly rose through the academic ranks to become assistant professor in 1933, clinical professor in 1946, and emeritus professor in 1949. He continued on the faculty of Harvard until 1956, although he had resigned his position as Chief of the Cardiac Service at the Massachusetts General Hospital in 1948 to devote time to the development of the National Heart Institute, following adoption of the National Heart Act, which was signed into law by President Truman in 1948.

White was recognized as a superb teacher and compassionate bedside physician. He published twelve books and more than 700 scientific articles. His most noted textbook, &quot;Heart Disease&quot;, was first published in 1931 and became a classic in the field. His interest in the electrophysiology of the heart would eventually pair him with Drs. Louis Wolff and John Parkinson, who together described the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, a condition of uncontrolled rapid heartbeat. In 1935 he described the electrocardiographic changes of pulmonary embolism.

===Advocacy work===

White is viewed by most medical authorities as the founder of preventive cardiology. Appointed as President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s physician following his heart attack in 1955, White very publicly prescribed cycling for his famous patient, giving the bicycle industry a welcome boost. White was a staunch advocate of exercise, diet, and weight control in the prevention of heart disease. In 1924, he was one of the founders of the American Heart Association and became the organization&#x27;s president in 1941. In the 1950s, White collaborated with Ancel Keys in developing the diet-heart hypothesis. White authored the Foreword to Ancel Keys&#x27;s 1959 book &quot;Eat Well and Stay Well&quot;.

He was a moving force in the creation of the International Association of Cardiology, and later the International Cardiology Foundation. In 1949, he was named executive director of the National Advisory Heart Council. He was the chief consultant to the National Heart Institute from 1948 to 1955 and was a major impetus in the Framingham Heart Study, which was the first major epidemiologic work to identify risk factors in coronary artery disease. He influential in establishing the National Institutes of Health.

White received many international honors and was instrumental in establishing cardiology organizations throughout the world, even in the People&#x27;s Republic of China which he was one of the first American physicians to visit. He also established a connection with Alexander Filipovich Samoilov, a Soviet physiologist who shared White&#x27;s interest in the electrophysiology of the heart. White was one of the founders of the International Society of Cardiology in 1946, helped to organize its first World Congress of Cardiology four years later in Paris, and presided over the second World Congress in Washington in 1954.

White was a staunch advocate of the belief that lifestyle affected coronary artery disease. He was one of the first authorities to recognize that coronary artery disease could occur in young men, writing several papers on the subject. In keeping with his beliefs, he was a vigorous walker and bicycle rider and walked, on one occasion, from Washington National Airport to the White House to consult with President Eisenhower. Reportedly, his positive approach inspired Lyndon B. Johnson to return to the Senate in 1955 after his heart attack and later to become Vice President.

In his later years, White continued to travel and to speak about heart disease and, increasingly, about his concern for world peace.

== Awards ==
White was elected an Associate Fellow of the National Academy of Kinesiology (née American Academy of Physical Education) in 1961, and delivered the academy&#x27;s R. Tait McKenzie Memorial Lecture the year before at their 1960 meeting in Miami Beach, Florida. His presentation was titled, &quot;Health and Sickness in Middle Age&quot;.
Also in 1961, NYU awarded White the prestigious University Medal. 
Three years later, on September 14, 1964, President Johnson presented White with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

==Personal life==
On June 28, 1924, White married Ina Helen Reid, a social worker whom he met while giving a lecture at the Smith College Training School for Social Work. They later adopted two children.
White spent many summers at Camp Becket in Becket, MA, where the dining hall is named after him.

==Death and memorials==
White died in Boston following a second stroke. He was to have received the Herrick Award from the American Heart Association, but died before that honor could be bestowed. A memorial service was held in the Harvard Memorial Church the next month; there, J. Willis Hurst, M.D., a former student of White&#x27;s, delivered a eulogy entitled &quot;I&#x27;m Not Through Yet&quot;.

The United States Postal Service honored White with a 3¢ Great Americans series postage stamp on September 15, 1986. A 17-mile section of the Charles River Bike Path around the Charles River in Boston bears his name.

<doc id="1267954" wikidata="Q2583132" url="?curid=1267954" title="The Spamhaus Project">
<text>The Spamhaus Project is an international organisation based in the Principality of Andorra, founded in 1998 by Steve Linford to track email spammers and spam-related activity. The name &quot;spamhaus&quot;, a pseudo-German expression, was coined by Linford to refer to an internet service provider, or other firm, which spams or knowingly provides service to spammers. 

==Anti-spam lists==
The Spamhaus Project is responsible for compiling several widely used anti-spam lists. Many internet service providers and email servers use the lists to reduce the amount of spam that reaches their users. In 2006, the Spamhaus services protected 650 million email users, including the European Parliament, US Army, the White House and Microsoft, from billions of spam emails a day.

Spamhaus distributes the lists in the form of DNS-based blocklists (DNSBLs). The lists are offered as a free public service to low-volume mail server operators on the internet. Commercial spam filtering services and other sites performing large scale usage must instead sign up for a commercial account through Spamhaus Technology its partner for distribution. Spamhaus outlines the way its DNSBL technology works in a document called &quot;Understanding DNSBL Filtering.&quot;

The Spamhaus Blocklist (SBL) targets &quot;verified spam sources (including spammers, spam gangs and spam support services).&quot; Its goal is to list IP addresses belonging to, known spammers, spam operations, and spam-support services. The SBL&#x27;s listings are partially based on the ROKSO index of known spammers.

The Exploits Blocklist (XBL) targets &quot;illegal 3rd party exploits, including open proxies, worms/viruses with built-in spam engines, virus-infected PCs &amp; servers and other types of trojan-horse exploits.&quot; That is to say it is a list of known open proxies and exploited computers being used to send spam and viruses. The XBL includes information gathered by Spamhaus as well as by other contributing DNSBL operations such as the Composite Blocking List (CBL).

The Policy Blocklist (PBL) is similar to a Dialup Users List. It lists not only dynamic IP addresses but also static addresses that should not be sending email directly to third-party servers. Examples of such are an ISP&#x27;s core routers, corporate users required by policy to send their email via company servers, and unassigned IP addresses. Much of the data is provided to Spamhaus by the organizations that control the IP address space, typically ISPs.

The Domain Blocklist (DBL) was released in March 2010 and is a list of domain names, which is both a domain URI blocklist and RHSBL. It lists spam domains including spam payload URLs, spam sources and senders (&quot;right-hand side&quot;), known spammers and spam gangs, and phish, virus and malware-related sites. It later added a zone of &quot;abused URL shorteners&quot;, a common way spammers insert links into spam emails.

The Combined Spam Sources (CSS) is an automatically produced dataset of IP addresses that are involved in sending low-reputation email. Listings can be based on HELO greetings without an A record, generic looking rDNS or use of fake domains, which could indicate spambots or server misconfiguration. CSS is part of SBL.

The ZEN Blocklist is a combined list, which includes all the Spamhaus IP-based DNS Blocklists.

The Botnet Controller List (BCL) was released in June 2012 and is a list of IP addresses. It lists IP addresses of which Spamhaus personnel believe to be operated by cybercriminals for the exclusive purpose of hosting botnet Command&amp;Control infrastructure. Such infrastructure is commonly used by cybercriminals to control malware infected computers.

The Spamhaus DROP (&quot;Don&#x27;t Route Or Peer&quot;) lists are JSON files delineating CIDR blocks and ASNs that have been stolen or are otherwise &quot;totally controlled by spammers or 100% spam hosting operations&quot;. As a small subset of the SBL, it does not include address ranges registered to ISPs and sublet to spammers, but only those network blocks wholly used by spammers. It is intended to be incorporated in firewalls and routing equipment to drop all network traffic to and from the listed blocks. The DROP webpage FAQ states the data is free for all to download and use. In 2012 Spamhaus Technology offered a BGP feed of the same data.

The Spamhaus Register of known spam operations (ROKSO) is a database of spammers and spam operations who have been terminated from three or more ISPs due to spamming. It contains publicly sourced information about these persons and their domains, addresses and aliases.

ROKSO is no longer available to the public. However, there is a special version available to law enforcement agencies, containing data on hundreds of spam gangs, with evidence, logs and information on illegal activities of these gangs. 

==Companies==
The Spamhaus Group consists of a number of independent companies which focus on different aspects of Spamhaus anti-spam technology or provide services based around it. At the core is the Spamhaus Project SLU, a not-for-profit company based in Andorra which tracks spam sources and cyber threats such as phishing, malware and botnets and publishes free DNSBLs. Commercial services are managed by a British data delivery company Spamhaus Technology Ltd., based in London UK which manages data distribution services for large scale spam filter systems.

==Awards==
* National Cyber Forensics Training Alliance 2008 Cyber Crime Fighter Award 
* Internet Service Providers Association&#x27;s Internet Hero of 2003 Award
* Greatest Contribution to anti-spam in the last 10 years presented to Spamhaus by Virus Bulletin Magazine.

==Conflicts==

===e360 lawsuit===
In September 2006, David Linhardt, the owner-operator of American bulk-emailing company &quot;e360 Insight LLC&quot;, filed a lawsuit in Illinois USA against Spamhaus in the UK for blacklisting his bulk mailings. Spamhaus being a British organisation with no ties to Illinois or the U.S. had the case moved from the state court to the U.S. Federal District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and asked to have the case dismissed for obvious lack of jurisdiction. The Illinois court however, presided over by Judge Charles Kocoras, ignored the request for dismissal and proceeded with the case against British-based Spamhaus without considering the jurisdiction issue, prompting British MP Derek Wyatt to call for the judge to be suspended from office. Not having had its objection to jurisdiction examined, Spamhaus refused to participate in the U.S. case any further and withdrew its counsel. Judge Kocoras however, angry at Spamhaus having ‘walked out’ of his court, deemed British-based Spamhaus to have &quot;technically accepted jurisdiction&quot; by having initially responded at all, and awarded e360 a Default Judgement totalling US$11,715,000 in damages. Spamhaus subsequently announced that it would ignore the judgement because default judgements issued by U.S. courts without a trial &quot;have no validity in the U.K. and cannot be enforced under the British legal system&quot;.

Following the default ruling in its favour, e360 filed a motion to attempt to force ICANN to remove the domain records of Spamhaus until the default judgement had been satisfied. This raised international issues regarding ICANN&#x27;s unusual position as an American organization with worldwide responsibility for domain names, and ICANN protested that they had neither the ability nor the authority to remove the domain records of Spamhaus, which is a UK-based company. On 20 October 2006, Judge Kocoras issued a ruling denying e360&#x27;s motion against ICANN, stating in his opinion that &quot;there has been no indication that ICANN [is] not [an] independent entit[y] [from Spamhaus], thus preventing a conclusion that [it] is acting in concert&quot; with Spamhaus and that the court had no authority over ICANN in this matter. The court further ruled that removing Spamhaus&#x27;s domain name registration was a remedy that was &quot;too broad to be warranted in this case&quot;, because it would &quot;cut off all lawful online activities of Spamhaus via its existing domain name, not just those that are in contravention&quot; of the default judgment. Kocoras concluded, &quot;[w]hile we will not condone or tolerate noncompliance with a valid order of this court [i.e., Spamhaus&#x27; refusal to satisfy the default judgement] neither will we impose a sanction that does not correspond to the gravity of the offending conduct&quot;.

In 2007, Chicago law firm Jenner &amp; Block LLP took up Spamhaus&#x27;s case &quot;pro bono publico&quot; and successfully appealed the default ruling. The U.S. federal Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit vacated the damages award and remanded the matter back to the district court for a more extensive inquiry to determine damages.

Following the successful Appeal by Jenner &amp; Block LLP in 2010 Judge Kocoras reduced the $11.7 million damages award to $27,002—$1 for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage, $1 for claims of defamation, and $27,000 for &quot;existing contracts&quot;.

Both parties appealed, but e360&#x27;s case for increasing the damages was sharply criticized by Judge Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit: &quot;I have never seen such an incompetent presentation of a damages case,&quot; Posner said. &quot;It&#x27;s not only incompetent, it&#x27;s grotesque. You&#x27;ve got damages jumping around from $11 million to $130 million to $122 million to $33 million. In fact, the damages are probably zero.&quot; and for a second time the Court of Appeals vacated the damages award.

Finally, on 2 September 2011 the Illinois court reduced the damages award to just $3 (three dollars) total, and ordered the plaintiff e360 to pay to Spamhaus the costs of the appeal for the defence.

In the course of these proceedings, in January 2008 e360 Insight LLC filed for bankruptcy and closed down, citing astronomical legal bills associated with this court case as the reason for its demise.

===Spamhaus versus nic.at===
In June 2007, Spamhaus requested the national domain registry of Austria, nic.at, to suspend a number of domains, claiming they were registered anonymously by phishing gangs for illegal bank phishing purposes. The registry nic.at rejected the request and argued that they would break Austrian law by suspending domains, even though the domains were used for criminal purposes, and demanded proof that the domains were registered under false identities. For some time the domains continued to phish holders of accounts at European banks. Finally, Spamhaus put the mail server of nic.at on their SBL spam blacklist under the SBL&#x27;s policy &quot;Knowingly Providing a Spam Support Service for Profit&quot; for several days which caused interference of mail traffic at nic.at. All of the phishing domains in question have been since deleted or suspended by their DNS providers.

===Blocking of Google Docs IPs===
In August 2010, Spamhaus added some Google-controlled IP addresses used by Google Docs to its SBL spam list, due to Google Docs being a large source of uncontrolled spam. Google quickly fixed the problem and Spamhaus removed the listing. Though initially wrongly reported by some press to be IPs used by Gmail, later it was clarified that only Google Docs was blocked.

===CyberBunker dispute and DDoS attack===
In March 2013, CyberBunker, an internet provider named after its former headquarters in a surplus NATO bunker in the Netherlands that &quot;offers anonymous hosting of anything except child porn and anything related to terrorism&quot; was added to the Spamhaus blacklist used by email providers to weed out spam. Shortly afterwards, beginning on March 18, Spamhaus was the target of a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack exploiting a long-known vulnerability in the Domain Name System (DNS) which permits origination of massive quantities of messages at devices owned by others using IP address spoofing. Devices exploited in the attack may be as simple as a cable converter box connected to the internet. The attack was of a previously unreported scale (peaking at 300 Gbit/s; an average large-scale attack might reach 50 Gbit/s, and the largest previous publicly reported attack was 100 Gbit/s) was launched against Spamhaus&#x27;s DNS servers; the effects of the attack had lasted for over a week. Steve Linford, chief executive for Spamhaus, said that they had withstood the attack, using the assistance of other internet companies such as Google to absorb the excess traffic. Linford also claimed that the attack was being investigated by five different national cyber-police-forces around the world, later confirmed in news reports as being the FBI, Europol, the British National Crime Agency (NCA), the Dutch Police National High Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU), and the Spanish National Police. Spamhaus also hired Cloudflare, a DDoS mitigation company, to assist them by distributing their internet services across Cloudflare&#x27;s worldwide network, after which the focus of the attack was redirected to the companies that provide Cloudflare&#x27;s network connections.

Spamhaus alleged that CyberBunker, in cooperation with &quot;criminal gangs&quot; from Eastern Europe and Russia, was behind the attack; CyberBunker did not respond to the BBC&#x27;s request for comment on the allegation; however, Sven Olaf Kamphuis, the owner of CyberBunker, posted to his Facebook account on 23 March &quot;Yo anons, we could use a little help in shutting down illegal slander and blackmail censorship project &#x27;spamhaus.org,&#x27; which thinks it can dictate its views on what should and should not be on the Internet.&quot; According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; Kamphuis also claimed to be the spokesman of the attackers, and said in a message &quot;We are aware that this is one of the largest DDoS attacks the world had publicly seen&quot;, and that CyberBunker was retaliating against Spamhaus for &quot;abusing their influence&quot;. &quot;The NYT&quot; added that security researcher Dan Kaminsky said &quot;You can’t stop a DNS flood ... The only way to deal with this problem is to find the people doing it and arrest them&quot;.

The attack was attributed by network engineers to an anonymous group unhappy with Spamhaus, later identified by the victims of the attack as Stophaus, a loosely organized group of &quot;bulletproof spam and malware hosters&quot;.

On 26 April 2013, the owner of CyberBunker, Sven Olaf Kamphuis, was arrested in Spain for his part in the attack on Spamhaus. He was held in jail for 55 days pending extradition to the Netherlands, was released pending trial, and was ultimately found guilty and sentenced to 240 days in jail, with the remaining days suspended.

The arrest of ‘Narko’: The British National Cyber Crime Unit revealed that a London schoolboy had been secretly arrested as part of a suspected organised crime gang responsible for the DDoS attacks. A briefing document giving details of the schoolboy&#x27;s alleged involvement states: &quot;The suspect was found with his computer systems open and logged on to various virtual systems and forums. The subject has a significant amount of money flowing through his bank account. Financial investigators are in the process of restraining monies.&quot;

===&quot;Ames v. The Spamhaus Project Ltd&quot;===
In 2014, Spamhaus was sued by California-based entrepreneurs Craig Ames and Rob McGee, who were involved with a bulk email marketing services business, initially through a US corporation called Blackstar Media LLC, and later as employees of Blackstar Marketing, a subsidiary of the English company Adconion Media Group Limited, which bought Blackstar Media in April 2011. Although an initial motion by Spamhaus to strike out the claims failed, they ultimately prevailed when the claimants dropped their case and paid Spamhaus&#x27; legal costs.

=== Legal Conflict with Netirons LLC, Fiber Grid, and Sonjara Oü (2022) ===
In 2018, The Spamhaus Project was sued by Netirons LLC, Fiber Grid, and Sonjara Oü, three internet service providers operating in Europe and the United States. These companies accused Spamhaus of defamatory practices and unfair business disruption. Spamhaus had unilaterally blacklisted their domain &quot;webexxpurts&quot; and multiple IP addresses, effectively cutting them off from key online services and damaging their business reputation.

A French court ruled in July 2018 that Spamhaus’s actions constituted an &quot;obviously unlawful disturbance.&quot; The court ordered Spamhaus to remove the defamatory content and pay damages. Despite multiple legal appeals between 2019 and 2021, Spamhaus was repeatedly found in violation of the ruling, leading to increasing financial penalties.

In 2022, the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal reaffirmed the previous decisions, rejecting Spamhaus’s attempts to evade accountability by disputing the court’s jurisdiction. The case highlighted the dangers of private entities unilaterally branding companies as malicious actors without due process. The ruling reinforced that organizations like Spamhaus do not have the unchecked power to blacklist businesses arbitrarily and harm their operations without legal consequences.

* Honorary Member, to certain international referees and chairmen (typically 40 years of service)
* Emeritus Member, to certain referees and chairmen (typically 30 years of service)
* Association Medal of Honour, to certain referees and chairmen (typically 20 years of service)

* In 1992, the FIFA awarded the Belgian Football Association the FIFA Fair Play Award.

== Charity ==
In the summer of 1986, when the national men&#x27;s A-selection reached the semifinals of the World Cup in Mexico, the football team started the project Casa Hogar under impulse of RBFA delegation responsible Michel D&#x27;Hooghe. This is a home for street children in the industrial Mexican city Toluca, to which the football players donated part of their tournament bonuses. During 25 years, the RBFA stayed committed with this project and helped 500 children to meals and education.

<text>A Drägerman or Drägerwoman, also spelled Draegerman or Draegerwoman, is a common name for a rescue worker in mines.

The name originates from Alexander Bernhard Dräger, a German scientist who invented the combination of a gas mask and an oxygen inhalator as a breathing apparatus for underground rescue workers.

In 1937, Warner Bros. released the film &quot;Draegerman Courage&quot; about Drägerman rescuing people trapped in a mine.

According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 109,278. Population has grown % since 1990, equivalent to an annual growth rate of .

Nearest landfall, from north end of Ponson island to southern Leyte, is about . From Consuelo port to Danao is as the crow flies. From south of Pacijan to Bohol is about .

Sometimes known as the &quot;&quot;Lost Horizon&quot; of the south&quot;, within recent years Camotes has seen increased visitors and tourism and a growing expatriate community. Apart from natural attractions on land, there is also a score of dive sites around the islands.

==Geography==
Camotes Islands comprises three major islands and one minor islet, divided between four municipalities. On Poro Island are the municipalities of Poro and Tudela. Pacijan Island&#x27;s sole municipality is San Francisco. Ponson Island&#x27;s sole municipality is Pilar. Tulang Island is an islet and part of San Francisco. The main islands of Pacijan and Poro are connected by a causeway. Ponson lies about northeast of Poro, across the Kawit Strait. Tulang is located a short distance north of Pacijan.

The Camotes are low-lying with several hills, some used for telecommunications relay stations. The highest point is Altavista, above sea level, on Poro. Pacijan has a large lake, Lake Danao, which at is the largest freshwater lake in the province.

===Demographics===
===Languages===

Cebuano is the primary language, then English and Filipino. School children are taught all three languages.

Porohanon or Camotes Visayan is spoken in the town of Poro only, and is one of the most endangered languages in the Visayas. The language is classified as distinct from Sebwano (Bisaya) by the Komisyon ng Wikang Filipino and is vital to the culture and arts of the Porohanon people.

The dialect is very similar to the language spoken in the rest of Camotes Islands and throughout the province of Cebu, Northern Mindanao and other parts of the Visayas. Porohanon is distinguished by the way the locals substitute the /y/ sound for /z/. Example: &quot;maayong buntag&quot; (good morning) in Cebuano would be changed to &quot;maazong buntag&quot; in Porohanon, &quot;na-a diha&quot; (in Cebuano), &quot;ara dira&quot; (in Porohanon)

==Transport==

==Environment==

===Climate===

Tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification category &quot;Am&quot;), with rainfall more or less evenly distributed throughout the year – Coronas climate type IV.

===Biota===

By Presidential Proclamation 2152 of 1981, the islands of Ponson, Poro and Pacihan were declared Mangrove swamp forest reserves.

Exemplars of the rare, critically endangered tree species Cebu Cinnamon (&quot;Cinnamomum cebuense&quot;) have been discovered on the Camotes Islands.

Palm trees are the dominant plant on the islands. There are also numerous native varieties of fruit including banana, mango and pineapple.

==History==

===Protohistory===

Little is known of the islands&#x27; early history. The twentieth century saw a number of archaeological studies, but nothing of major significance emerged.

An early visitor was Carl Guthe, who led an expedition from the University of Michigan which spent three years 1923–1925 investigating and exploring many sites across the archipelago. He conducted an archaeological dig in a cave site on Tulang. Located on the southeastern coast of the island, the cave measures about . Guthe reported it to contain bone fragments and teeth of about 60 individuals. Associated grave goods included earthenware pottery, shell bracelets, bronze and iron artefacts (iron tang, bronze chisel, iron blade), glass and stone beads, hammerstone and pestle. Filed teeth were also recovered from this site.

Otley Beyer (Philippine&#x27;s &quot;Father of Anthropology&quot;) never visited, although he is reported to have described Camotes as a &quot;basket of interesting archaeological finds.&quot;

In the early 1970s, residents unearthed a variety of artefacts dating back to the 16th century. An excavation at Mactang, a &quot;purok&quot; within Esperanza, Poro, revealed spears, daggers, swords, crosses, iron pendants and a skull pierced with an arrowhead. This heavily disturbed and looted site located along the shoreline of sitio Mactang was excavated by Bailen and Cabanilla of UP Diliman in the early 1990s and explored by Bersales and USC in 2001. Porcelain and earthenware sherds are strewn on the surface of what would otherwise have been a 13th- or 14th-century CE burial site.

In one barangay, Bailen and Cabanilla found a complex of caves which they believed had been inhabited by primitive people. Cabanilla asked municipal officials to preserve the site and wait while their project proposal would be approved. They planned to conduct a digging and leave whatever artefacts would be found in the caves. Meaning, they would transform the place into an onsite museum that should attract students, archaeologists. etc.

A few months later, Cabanilla returned to Camotes, having secured project funding from a foreign institution. To his surprise and dismay, despite earlier assurances of its safekeeping, he found the caves already mined of stone which had been sold to a sinter plant in Leyte by the mayor. Only one cave remained, but Cabanilla lost the drive and returned to Manila, his project scuttled.

Because of that, even the plan to set up a town museum for the artifacts dug during the survey was abandoned.

===Spanish conquistadores===
The islands were first mentioned by Antonio Pigafetta, one of the survivors on Ferdinand Magellan&#x27;s fateful voyage, as they waited off the islands for several days before going on to Cebu in the first week of April 1521: 

Writing in 1582, Miguel de Loarca stated:

He also wrote:
:&quot;&quot;todos son de vna manera tienen tambien gallinas y puercos y algunas cabras frisoles y vnas Rayçes como batatas de sancto domingo qe llaman camotes&quot;
:All are provided with fowls, swine, a few goats, beans, and a kind of root resembling the potatoes of Sancto Domingo, called by the natives &quot;camotes&quot;.&quot; This remark is itself remarkable in that &quot;camote&quot; is the Hispanicized form of the Nahuatl (indigenous Mexican) word for &quot;sweet potato&quot;, indicating a prior visit by a Spanish ship from Mexico.
Camotes Islands were previously a part of the Leyte province before being transferred to Cebu province during the American period.

===Modern times===

In 1942 Japanese forces occupied Camotes Islands. In 1945 Japanese soldiers massacred almost all of the inhabitants in Pilar which led to a war crimes trial after the war. The liberation of the islands happened soon after the massacre when Philippine and American soldiers landed and fought the remaining Japanese soldiers in the Battle of Camotes Islands.

==Economy==

The predominant industries on the Camotes Islands are farming (including corn, rice, pigs, chicken and cattle), fishing and tourism.

There are about 22 tourist resorts catering to both domestic and international visitors with many public and private beaches.

Also in the Camotes Islands you can find tourist spots such as Buho Rock, Greenlake Park, Mt. Calvary (Kalbaryo), Lake Danao and the vast mangrove swamp along the sides of the road from Pacijan (San Francisco) to Poro. There are many caves such as Bukilat Cave, Timubo Cave and Guadalupe Cave which has a fresh-water underground lake. There are also two waterfalls, one in Poro and one in Tudela. There is diving and snorkeling opportunities at some of the resorts.

The major employers are CELCO (Camotes Electric Cooperative), Camotes Hillside Academy and Kinoshita Pearl Farm. There is a small hospital. Fiesta Mall, the first mall on the island opened in 2015. A new integrated casino resort with condos is scheduled to open in December, 2016. Tourism in the key economic development for the future of the island with a focus on the white sand beaches, safe and clean environment.

There are two colleges on the island: Cebu Technology University (Camotes) and Mount Moriah College.

It was the first album by the band to feature Marc Ford on lead guitar, replacing Jeff Cease, who was fired the year before, and the first to feature keyboardist Eddie Harsch.

== Release ==
It was a record for an album to feature four album rock number-one hits (previously set by Tom Petty in 1989, with three). The album itself reached the top spot of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, propelled by the success of these singles.

A box set featuring the remixed album along with previously unreleased songs and live tracks was released in late 2023.

==Reception==
In 2005, &quot;The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion&quot; was ranked number 477 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

<doc id="1267992" wikidata="Q474219" url="?curid=1267992" title="Amos A. Lawrence">
<text>Amos Adams Lawrence (July 31, 1814August 22, 1886) was an American businessman, philanthropist, and social activist. He was a key figure in the United States abolitionist movement in the years leading up to the Civil War and the growth of the Episcopal Church in Massachusetts. He was instrumental in the establishment of the University of Kansas and Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin.

==Early life==
Lawrence was born in Boston, Massachusetts on July 31, 1814. His father, Amos Lawrence, was a merchant, philanthropist, and member of the prominent Lawrence family.

He was educated at Groton Academy and was graduated at Harvard College in 1835.

==Career==
Following his graduation from Harvard, Lawrence entered business for himself as a commission merchant and eventually became owner of Ipswich Mills, the largest producer of knit goods in the country.

In 1858 and 1860, he was a candidate for governor of Massachusetts.

===Philanthropy===
Lawrence financed the founding of the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas, which was named after him.

In 1847, he founded a college that is today Lawrence University on of land that he had purchased in 1844 in the Fox River Valley. Some of the land he purchased became Appleton, Wisconsin, named for his father-in-law.

His farm outside of Boston became the campus for Boston College. From 1857 to 1862 he was treasurer of Harvard College, and from 1879 to 1885 an overseer. Lawrence also contributed large sums of money to Harvard, the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Lawrence Academy, and the Groton School.

===Abolitionism and the Civil War===
Lawrence credited the Anthony Burns affair in the spring of 1854 with radicalizing him and other cotton merchants on the issue of slavery: &quot;[W]e went to bed one night old fashioned, conservative, Compromise Union Whigs &amp; waked up stark mad Abolitionists.&quot;

Lawrence contributed large amounts of capital to the Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Company and funds for the colonization of free negroes in Liberia. He donated guns, specifically Sharps rifles, which were shipped to Jayhawkers and abolitionists in Kansas as &quot;books&quot; and &quot;primers.&quot; During the bloodshed in Kansas, Lawrence wrote frequently to President Franklin Pierce, the husband of Lawrence&#x27;s cousin Jane, on behalf of the free-state settlers.

He also provided funds for the activism and legal defense of John Brown, though he deplored Brown&#x27;s fanaticism and urged against violent resistance to the federal government. When Brown was arrested at Harpers Ferry, Lawrence appealed to the Governor of Virginia to secure a lawful trial.

In 1862, he raised a battalion of cavalry which became the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry, of which Charles Russell Lowell was colonel.

==Personal life==
In 1842, Lawrence married Sarah Elizabeth Appleton, daughter of U.S. Representative William Appleton and Mary Ann (née Cutler) Appleton. They had the following children:

* Maryanne Appleton Lawrence (1843-1882), m. Robert Amory (1842-1910)
* Amory Appleton Lawrence (1848–1912)
* William Lawrence (1850–1941), who became the Bishop of Massachusetts.
* Susan Mason Lawrence (1852–1923)
* Harriet Lawrence Hemenway (1858-1960), who became a co-founder of the Massachusetts Audubon Society.

===Descendants===
Through his son William, Lawrence was the grandfather of William Appleton Lawrence (1889–1968), who was elected third Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Western Massachusetts, and Frederic Cunningham Lawrence (1899–1989), a suffragan bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts.

==Death and legacy==
He died at his summer resort in Nahant, Massachusetts, in 1886.

===Legacy===
Lawrence is credited with founding an Episcopal church in Boston, Massachusetts, which prompted many Boston Brahmins to convert from Unitarianism. His son, William Lawrence, became the long-time Bishop of the Episcopal Church in Massachusetts.

His alma mater, Groton Academy was later renamed after him. Today, it is the Lawrence Academy at Groton.

<text>East Is East is a 1999 British comedy-drama film written by Ayub Khan-Din and directed by Damien O&#x27;Donnell. It is set in Salford, Lancashire (now in Greater Manchester), in 1971, in a mixed-ethnicity British household headed by Pakistani father George (Om Puri) and an English mother, Ella (Linda Bassett).

&quot;East Is East&quot; is based on Khan-Din&#x27;s 1996 play of the same name, which opened at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in October 1996 and Royal Court Theatre in November 1996. The title derives from the 1889 Rudyard Kipling poem &quot;The Ballad of East and West&quot;, of which the opening line reads: &quot;Oh East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet&quot;.

The film was critically acclaimed, winning the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film at the BAFTA Awards. It was also a major box office success, grossing worldwide and earning over ten times its £1.9 million () budget.

==Plot==
In 1971, George Khan is a Pakistani Muslim who has lived in Britain since 1937. He has a wife in Pakistan. He and his second wife Ella, a British Roman Catholic woman of Irish descent, have been married for twenty-five years and have seven children; Nazir, Abdul, Tariq, Maneer, Saleem, Meenah (the only daughter) and Sajid. George and Ella run a popular fish and chip shop.

While George is obsessed with the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War (primarily out of concern for his first family living near the conflict zone) and arranging marriages for his children, the children themselves, born and brought up in Britain, increasingly see themselves as British and reject Pakistani dress, food, religion and culture. After George disowns Nazir for running out on his arranged marriage, he immediately begins making plans to have another two of his children married to maintain his image.

On a trip to Bradford, George is introduced to Mr. Shah, a fellow Pakistani Muslim who wishes to marry off his two unattractive daughters. George arranges in secret for his second and third sons, Abdul and Tariq, to marry them, despite Ella&#x27;s misgivings, a conversation that the youngest child, Sajid, overhears. During a quarrel, Sajid reveals the arranged marriages to his brothers; Tariq, the most rebellious son who is in a relationship with Stella Moorhouse (whose grandfather is a supporter of Enoch Powell and repatriation), flies into a rage and defiles the wedding garments George had bought. The most obedient son, Maneer, is caught by George trying to tidy the mess up and beaten when he refuses to tell George who was responsible; Ella intervenes and is also beaten. Tariq travels to Eccles and tracks down Nazir, now a hat designer and in a homosexual relationship, who returns to confront George for his actions. However, upon seeing Ella&#x27;s and Maneer&#x27;s bruises, he becomes frightened his appearance will anger George further and make the situation worse for his siblings and his mother. Ella urges him to go, so he obeys her wish and flees before George catches sight of him. Tariq and George get in a heated argument over the arranged marriages. Whilst Tariq insists that he is British, George refutes this, stating that the Islamic community is more accepting. Tariq reluctantly agrees to go along with the marriage, but defiantly states that he will follow his father&#x27;s example of also having a British second wife.

Mr. and Mrs. Shah arrive with their daughters to meet George&#x27;s family. Ella maintains her composure despite Mrs. Shah&#x27;s condescending and rude attitude, but things come to a head when a scuffle ensues over a sculpture of a vulva that Saleem had made as a project for art college, and he accidentally drops it into Mrs. Shah&#x27;s lap. Angered, Mrs. Shah insults George&#x27;s entire family and is ejected from the house by Ella along with her husband and daughters. Enraged, George attacks Ella but is stopped by Abdul and the other children long enough for him to see how his actions have turned his entire family against him, and leaves the household in shame to seek solace in his shop.

In the aftermath, George and Ella make amends over tea while the kids play in the street.

<doc id="1268013" wikidata="Q17089491" url="?curid=1268013" title="Web Services Discovery">
<text>Web Services Discovery provides access to software systems over the Internet using standard protocols. In the most basic scenario there is a &quot;Web Service Provider&quot; that publishes a service and a &quot;Web Service Consumer&quot; that uses this service. Web Service Discovery is the process of finding suitable web services for a given task.

Publishing a web service involves creating a software artifact and making it accessible to potential consumers. Web service providers augment a service endpoint interface with an interface description using the Web Services Description Language (WSDL) so that a consumer can use the service.

Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) is an XML-based registry for business internet services. A provider can explicitly register a service with a &quot;Web Services Registry&quot; such as UDDI or publish additional documents intended to facilitate discovery such as Web Services Inspection Language (WSIL) documents. The service users or consumers can search web services manually or automatically. The implementation of UDDI servers and WSIL engines should provide simple search APIs or web-based GUI to help find Web services.

Web services may also be discovered using multicast mechanisms like WS-Discovery, thus reducing the need for centralized registries in smaller networks.

==Universal Description Discovery and Integration==
Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI, pronounced ) is a platform-independent, Extensible Markup Language protocol that includes a (XML-based) registry by which businesses worldwide can list themselves on the Internet, and a mechanism to register and locate web service applications. UDDI is an open industry initiative, sponsored by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), for enabling businesses to publish service listings and discover each other, and to define how the services or software applications interact over the Internet.

UDDI was originally proposed as a core Web service standard. It is designed to be interrogated by SOAP messages and to provide access to Web Services Description Language (WSDL) documents describing the protocol bindings and message formats required to interact with the web services listed in its directory.

==History of UDDI==
UDDI was written in August 2000, at a time when the authors had a vision of a world in which consumers of web services would be linked up with providers through a public or private dynamic brokerage system. In this vision, anyone needing a service, such as credit card authentication, would go to their service broker and select a service supporting the desired SOAP (or other) service interface, and meeting other criteria. In such a world, the publicly operated UDDI node or broker would be critical for everyone. For the consumer, public or open brokers would only return services listed for public discovery by others, while for a service producer, getting a good placement in the brokerage—by relying on metadata of authoritative index categories—would be critical for effective placement.

UDDI was included in the Web Services Interoperability (WS-I) standard as a central pillar of web services infrastructure, and the UDDI specifications supported a publicly accessible Universal Business Registry in which a naming system was built around the UDDI-driven service broker.

UDDI has not been as widely adopted as its designers had hoped. IBM, Microsoft, and SAP announced they were closing their public UDDI nodes in January 2006. The group defining UDDI, the OASIS Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) Specification Technical Committee voted to complete its work in late 2007 and has been closed.
In September 2010, Microsoft announced they were removing UDDI services from future versions of the Windows Server operating system. Instead, this capability would be moved to BizTalk Server. In 2013, Microsoft further announced the deprecation of UDDI Services in BizTalk Server. In 2016, Microsoft removed UDDI Services from BizTalk Server.

UDDI systems are most commonly found inside companies, where they are used to dynamically bind client systems to implementations. However, much of the search metadata permitted in UDDI is not used for this relatively simple role.

==Structure of UDDI==
A UDDI business registration consists of three components:
* White Pages — address, contact, and known identifiers;
* Yellow Pages — industrial categorizations based on standard taxonomies;
* Green Pages — technical information about services exposed by the business.

===White Pages===
White pages give information about the business supplying the service. This includes the name of the business and a description of the business - potentially in multiple languages. Using this information, it is possible to find a service about which some information is already known (for example, locating a service based on the provider&#x27;s name).

Contact information for the business is also provided - for example the businesses address and phone number; and other information such as the Dun &amp; Bradstreet.

===Yellow Pages===

Yellow pages provide a classification of the service or business, based on standard taxonomies. These include the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC), the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), or the United Nations Standard Products and Services Code (UNSPSC) and geographic taxonomies.

Because a single business may provide a number of services, there may be several Yellow Pages (each describing a service) associated with one White Page (giving general information about the business).

===Green Pages===
Green pages are used to describe how to access a Web Service, with information on the service bindings. Some of the information is related to the Web Service - such as the address of the service and the parameters, and references to specifications of interfaces. Other information is not related directly to the Web Service - this includes e-mail, FTP, CORBA and telephone details for the service. Because a Web Service may have multiple bindings (as defined in its WSDL description), a service may have multiple Green Pages, as each binding will need to be accessed differently.

==UDDI nodes and registry==
UDDI nodes are servers which support the UDDI specification and belong to a UDDI registry while UDDI registries are collections of one or more nodes.

SOAP is an XML-based protocol to exchange messages between a requester and a provider of a Web Service.
The provider publishes the WSDL to UDDI and the requester can join to it using SOAP.

== Federated discovery ==
The current UDDI search mechanism can only focus on a single search criterion, such as business name, business location, business category, service type by name, business identifier, or discovery URL. In fact, in a business solution, it is very normal to search multiple UDDI registries or WSIL documents and then aggregate the returned result by using filtering and ranking techniques. IBM modularized this federated Web Services Discovery engine in 2001. The released technology from IBM is Business Explorer for Web Services (BE4WS).

<text>A roller coaster train is a vehicle made up of two or more carts connected by specialized joints which transports passengers around a roller coaster&#x27;s circuit. Roller coasters usually have various safety features, including specialized wheels and restraints. It is called a train because the cars follow one another around the track, the same reason as for a railroad train. Individual cars vary in design and can carry from one to eight or more passengers each.

== Operation ==
Many roller coasters operate more than one train, sometimes several, simultaneously. Typically they operate two trains at a time, with one train loading and unloading while the other train runs the course. On the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roller Coaster at Walt Disney World, for example, there are five trains, but only four operate at a time (the trains are rotated out on a regular basis for safety reasons).

Roller coaster trains have wheels that run on the sides (side friction or guide wheels) and underneath the track (upstop, underfriction, or underlocking wheels) as well as on top of it (road or running wheels); these lock the train to the tracks and prevent it from jumping the track. The side wheels can be mounted on the outside or inside of the train, depending on the manufacturer (although outside-mounted wheels are more common). The wheels are sometimes located between the cars, as well as at the front and rear of the entire train.

===Restraints===

Roller coaster trains also have restraints that keep the passengers in their seats. There are two major types of restraints: lap bar and over-the-shoulder. (Most modern over-the-shoulder restraints come into contact with riders at the lap; however, older so-called &quot;horsecollar&quot; ones actually restrain riders by the shoulders). Restraints always use two locking mechanisms, one on each side, for redundancy. If one fails, the restraint will remain locked. Most modern roller coasters also have seat belts that may act as secondary safety devices. On over-the-shoulder restraints, this seatbelt is mostly cosmetic as the restraint locks on its own.

Lap bars were first used in 1907 with the Coney Island coaster Drop the Dip. Lap bar restraints consist of a padded bar mounted to the floor or side of the train that swings backwards into the rider&#x27;s lap. These restraints are usually found on roller coasters that lack inversions. Some inverting roller coasters, notably ones created by Anton Schwarzkopf safely operate without the need for shoulder restraints. Historically, inverting roller coasters with lap bars could only perform vertical loops, as the higher centripetal force (and low lateral force) exerted while traversing a simple clothoid loop helps to keep riders safely in the train. However, with modern advances in engineering, more roller coasters with complicated inversions are able to run without over-the-shoulder restraints. For example, most of Premier Rides&#x27; LIM-launched roller coasters (the vast majority of which have multiple inverting elements) operate with only lap bars. Lap bar restraints, like buzz bars give the rider much greater freedom of movement than over-the-shoulder restraints, enhancing the feeling of danger for some.
Over-the-shoulder restraints, the most common type, consist of a roughly U-shaped padded bar mounted to the top of each seat that swings downward. Roller coasters that have inversions usually have this type of restraint. Additionally, almost all inverted and floorless roller coasters have this type of restraint, since it is difficult to mount a lap bar restraint. One disadvantage of over-the-shoulder restraints is that they can provide discomfort to the rider (known among coaster enthusiasts as headbanging), especially on rougher roller coasters. It is recommended that earrings should be removed before riding roller coasters with over-the-shoulder restraints. Some rides, such as Maverick at Cedar Point, require that guests must remove earrings before riding.

However, there are some operating roller coasters that do not have either restraint systems. Rollo Coaster at Idlewild and Soakzone is a good example of this. Usually roller coasters with little to no air-time (being lifted out of your seat) do not have restraints. Until early 2006, The Rollercoaster at Blackpool Pleasure Beach in the UK also operated without any restraints, although seatbelts were added to the ride in the 2007 season. During 2008, trains from the Big Dipper Rollercoaster were installed on the ride. &quot;The Rollercoaster&quot; now operates with lap bars, although the original train is still stored on the transfer track in the station.

<text>Maximus Inc. is an American government services company, with operations in countries including the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Maximus provides administration and other services for Medicaid, Medicare, health care reform, welfare-to-work, and student loan servicing, among other government programs. The company is based in Tysons, Virginia, has 39,600 employees and a reported annual revenue of $5.3 billion in fiscal year 2024.

== History ==
Maximus was founded in 1975 by David V. Mastran, initially operating as a consulting firm for the federal government, including information technology services.

The history of Maximus follows the trajectory of significant government policy changes.

The government service reform policies in the &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s which were enacted by the Reagan administration and continued in the Bush and Clinton administrations, led to the US government increasing private-sector contracting of administration program functions operated under the control of government. In 1988, Maximus was awarded its first contract for social welfare from Los Angeles County, and began shifting focus towards business process outsourcing and providing state-based consulting services.

Passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 under President Clinton granting states greater latitude in administering social welfare programs, and the Balanced Budget Amendment of 1997 amending certain eligibility, enrollment, and beneficiary protections in Medicaid further increased government use of public / private partnerships for the administration of certain program functions.

In 1997, the company went public, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MMS.

The G.W. Bush Administration saw reauthorization and expansion of PRWORA, cementing the government&#x27;s use of private sector contracting of administrative functions associated with Federally funded, state administered, entitlement programs.

In 2006,Richard Montoni, former chief financial officer for Maximus, was named CEO. From 2008 to 2010, Maximus engaged in a number of divestitures that included its Security Solutions, Justice Solutions, Education Systems, Asset Solutions and Enterprise resource planning (ERP) divisions, focusing the firm on providing health and human services core program solutions.

Passage in 2010 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) during the Obama Administration further expanded the use of private sector contracting of government administrative functions associated with the ACA, Medicaid, and Medicare, in conjunction with other human services related programs.

From 2010 to 2013, Maximus acquired Denver-based Policy Studies Incorporated (PSI) to increase its capacity to serve government clients in the US and expanded into clinical assessment services with the acquisition of Ascend. From a global perspective, Maximus acquired UK based Health Management Ltd. On April 6, 2015, the company completed the $300 million acquisition of Falls-Church-based technology contractor, Acentia, expanding the Maximus federal technology business.

In 2018, after twelve years as CEO, Richard Montoni announced his retirement and the company appointed President Bruce Caswell to the position of chief executive officer. Caswell articulated a strategic plan focusing the company&#x27;s activities on helping governments advance digitally-enabled customer service, modernizing technology capabilities and expansion of clinical services delivery. In November 2018, Maximus acquired U.S. Federal citizen engagement center assets from another government contractor (GDIT) for $400 million in cash. 

In September 2020, Maximus hired Dr. Arvenita Washington Cherry as Senior Director of DE&amp;I to lead diversity and inclusion activities in its workforce.

In 2021, Maximus completed three additional transactions. Maximus and Navient announced the two companies signed a definitive agreement to transfer the loan servicing for 5.6 million U.S. Department of Education-owned student loan accounts through a contract novation, creating a new operating entity, Aidvantage. Maximus acquired Attain, a technology integration company, and Veterans Evaluation Services (VES), a clinical assessments company. In January 2025, the Department of Veterans Affairs re-awarded VES, a Maximus company, contracts through 2026 for domestic regions 1 – 4 which collectively span the continental U.S. to continue providing medical disability exams services through the Veterans Benefit Administration.

In May 2022, Maximus relocated its headquarters to Tysons, Virginia in new office space that was reported to incorporate &quot;many of the post-pandemic office designs that architects and companies are emphasizing.&quot;

In September 2022, after a 3-year long competitive procurement process, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) awarded Maximus a 10 year contract that extended its existing role as lead operator of citizen contact centers, including 1-800-MEDICARE. In December 2023, US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra announced it would be recompeting this contract for the express purpose of inserting a labor harmony agreement. In November 2024, CMS decided to halt efforts to rebid its contract with Maximus. Some observers, including 17 state attorneys general, noted that there was little precedent for ending an ongoing contract and introducing new labor harmony provisions. Sen. Bill Cassidy, the incoming chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, stated, &#x27;The Maximus contract should never have ended in the first place,&#x27; and expressed concerns that the administration&#x27;s actions were aimed at promoting unionization among call-center employees.

== Structure ==
Maximus’ operations are divided into three segments: U.S. Services, U.S. Federal Services, and outside the U.S.

* U.S. Services: business process services (BPS), appeals and assessments, and consulting work for U.S. state and local governments. This work has included supporting programs associated with Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Refugee Support Services, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
* U.S. Federal Services: end-to-end solutions, appeals and assessments, system and application development, IT modernization, and maintenance services
* Outside the U.S.: business process services (BPS) for international governments and commercial clients. This includes health and disability assessments, program administration for employment services, wellbeing solutions, and other services related to work-support programs.

==Services==
Maximus is one of the largest providers of government services. The company provides business process management, technology integration and implementation, and consulting services in policy and program areas that include Health and Wellness, Welfare and Safety Net, Citizen Services, and Federal/National Agencies.

=== Health and Wellness ===
Maximus provides services for government health programs including Medicaid and workers&#x27; compensation independent medical review, the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Medicare and health insurance exchanges as required under the Affordable Care Act. Maximus serves on the Enroll America advisory council.

In September 2012, the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services awarded Maximus Health Services a two-year, $76.8 million contract to help the state with its Medicaid program. That same month, Maximus announced a $23.5 million contract with the State of Oklahoma to operate a customer relationship management system for SoonerCare, the state&#x27;s Medicaid program, and Insure Oklahoma, a program that provides employers with subsidies to help buy private market health insurance for their low- to moderate-income employees.

Maximus is also the largest provider of privatized health insurance appeals to Medicare. In 2012 it expanded its growing Federal operations, bringing 500 local jobs to upstate New York and Pennsylvania, including more than 325 jobs in Pittsford, NY and more than 125 jobs to Scranton, PA.

The company offers services in the health insurance exchange marketplace and in July 2012, the Minnesota Department of Commerce awarded Maximus a two-year, $41 million contract to create the state&#x27;s new health insurance exchange. In February 2013, Connecticut awarded Maximus a $15 million contract to run the customer contact center operations for the state&#x27;s health insurance exchange, Access Health CT.

=== COVID-19 Response ===

In March 2020, Maximus began working with government agencies in the United States at the federal, state, and local level to assist with the COVID-19 pandemic response. This work initially included providing testing results and conducting contact tracing, in states such as Arizona and Indiana. In September 2020, Maximus announced the creation of Maximus Public Health to establish citizen engagement centers and support “efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 and toward the purchasing and distribution of vaccines.&quot;

In 2021, Maximus shifted its focus to vaccine distribution. The company worked directly with states, like Colorado, to provide information to residents and schedule vaccine appointments. In May 2021, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) announced it had selected Maximus to “support a national hotline program&quot; for vaccine distribution.

=== Welfare and Safety Net ===
National governments, state agencies, and local governments administer and deliver programs that address complex social challenges like poverty and health equity. Maximus supports agencies in this area, offering services such as welfare-to-work programs, including Ticket to Work, as well as support for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and Refugee Support Services.

In 2012, the company launched its first welfare-to-work program in Canada and expanded its Australia operations with a five-year contract to help people with disabilities find employment.

Maximus also provides child support enforcement and other child support services. In 2009, the company won a five-year contract to collect and enforce child-support collections in Shelby County, Tennessee. Maximus launched Project NOW (Negotiating Outstanding Warrants), an initiative that collected more than $35,000 to help nearly 100 parents in Shelby County get back on track after missing child support payments.

Maximus provides support for the UK’s Department of Work and Pensions. In 2011, Maximus was recognized as the top performing provider for welfare-to-work services under the United Kingdom&#x27;s Flexible New Deal programme, helping job seekers into long-term sustained employment. Following the Flexible New Deal, the United Kingdom government unveiled a replacement program, called the Work Programme, that created welfare reform changes. Maximus serves as a contractor in three regions under the UK&#x27;s Work Programme initiative. Its subsidiary, Centre for Health and Disability Assessments Ltd., runs Work Capability Assessments with a contract which began in 2014 and runs until July 2021.

In 2012, the company launched its first welfare-to-work program in Canada and expanded its Australia operations with a five-year contract to help people with disabilities find employment.

The Maximus Foundation helped fund the work of four high school students at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Virginia, to develop Atheia, a new technology to assist those with vision problems.

== Controversies ==

November 1997- The &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; reported that Maximus &quot;gets minimal results&quot; when it was hired by the State of Connecticut to manage a child care program for recipients of welfare. According to the Record-Journal, Maximus &quot;hired too few people, installed an inadequate phone system and fell weeks or months behind in making payments to day care providers.&quot; The Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS) asked Maximus to meet improvement goals and by December, DSS Commissioner Joyce A. Thomas noted improvements on several fronts commenting, &quot;The good news for Connecticut&#x27;s child care providers and the families we all serve is that the situation is rapidly improving. Maximus has come a long way, and we are confident that current efforts are paving the way to long-term improvements.&quot;

December 1998- The &quot;Sarasota Herald Tribune&quot; reported that the State of Florida had paid Maximus $4.5 Million for a Child Support Recovery contract. Maximus was only able to collect $162,000. &quot;On average taxpayers paid Maximus $25 for every 3 cents collected.&quot;

1999 - Then-mayor of New York, Rudy Giuliani held his first meetings in May 1999 introducing the city&#x27;s welfare reform programs which would require adult welfare recipients to either work or train for work. Mid-June was set as the deadline for the competition for the contracts. However, the Giuliani administration began to consult with Maximus executives on how the company could &quot;reshape, consolidate and run&quot; the programs, as early as January 1999. Starting in January, Maximus was awarded contracts worth $500 million, which represented the &quot;largest share&quot; to assess and train as many as 200,000 welfare recipients and to provide job placement. New York city&#x27;s comptroller said that this gave Maximus an &quot;unfair advantage&quot;.

October 2000- Six state lawmakers in Wisconsin called for the termination of Maximus&#x27; W-2 contract, saying the firm has &quot;broken faith with the state and poor people the agency serves in Milwaukee County.&quot;

June 2001- The &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; reported that two Maximus employees filed discrimination complaints against the company. The employees stated that Maximus is so lacking in diversity that the companies minority employees referred to it as &quot;White Castle&quot;.

2004 In 2004, British Columbia became the first province in Canada to outsource a large quantity of its health administration serviceswhich included Medical Services Plan and PharmaCareto the private sector, when BC Health signed the ten-year $324-million contract with Maximus. A campaign was launched in the province to protect private and personal health information. Concerns included the risk of disclosure of confidential date accessed under the Homeland Security Act.

July 2007- Maximus settled a lawsuit brought against it by the United States government for involvement in falsifying Medicaid claims for $30.5 million. Maximus did not admit or deny the government&#x27;s allegations in the legal case.

October 2010- The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that 146 medical workers, including doctors, nurses and pharmacists were allowed to keep working despite failing drug tests. Maximus was awarded a $2.5 Million a year contract to run California&#x27;s confidential &quot;diversion programs&quot;. Maximus contracted the work out to a subcontractor who in turn subcontracted the work to another company. The drug testing company was using the wrong standard of drug test from December 2009 to August 2010, resulting in medical workers who tested positive for drugs to continue working.

June 2011- A Maximus manager on the MassHealth project and had access to the personal information of enrollees in the MassHealth program, who had passed the Massachusetts-required CORI background check, was revealed to have pleaded no contest to a Florida felony by Boston-based Fox25. A subsequent review by Maximus found “no reason to believe that anyone’s personal information was used inappropriately” and terminated the employee.

September 2011- Maximus Inc. was sued by U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for disability discrimination for failure to promote a female employee because it regarded her as disabled. Maximus settled the lawsuit in August 2012.

June 2012- Through an internal privacy audit, Maximus discovered that a worker in Canada illegally viewed personal health records of 43 Canadians. The worker involved was immediately suspended and later fired.

January 2013- A Maximus employee based in Boston MA was indicted for allegedly stealing more than $490,000 from the Massachusetts Medicaid program. The theft had occurred over a period of nine years. She was convicted in December 2013.

February 2013 In his February 2013 report, the British Columbia auditor general said that Maximus 10-year contract with BC Health lacked adequate monitoring and had not brought the &quot;expected benefits&quot; it had promised. Major deadlines were not met and no penalties were laid. Desktop and laptops were not replaced as often as agreed upon. Even after almost a decade, privacy issues had not been dealt with adequately. BC Health relies solely on the company to self-report breaches. Subcontractors were not given security audits. As well, auditing does not “provide assurance that data access and storage are limited to Canada and that the data can be segregated from the service provider’s parent companies.”

April 2021 An investigation by NPR and The Marshall Project found that many U.S. states were involved in the following practice, using Maximus as enabler and facilitator: 
&quot;Social Security pays benefits to children who have significant disabilities, when their parents are disabled, or if a parent has died. When the check goes to a minor, someone is designated as the representative payee, trusted to use that money in the best interest of the child. States routinely take that money to cover the cost of foster care, even though there are already state and federal sources to pay for it and even though other impoverished children and youth who don&#x27;t get Social Security checks aren&#x27;t responsible for paying for their foster care.&quot; Maximus was found to be among the consulting companies that were hired by states—including Alaska, California, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, New York, Maryland, and South Carolina—to locate foster children eligible to receive disability and other checks from Social Security and register them, for the sole purpose of generating revenue for the states. Even after these foster children aged out of the foster care program, they were not able to get the Social Security funds to which they were entitled. Law professor Daniel L. Hatcher criticized the practice in his book &quot;The Poverty Industry.&quot;

March 2022 A report by the Student Borrower Protection Center and the Communications Workers of America noted consumer complaints filed against Aidvantage in relation to federal student loans, and accused Maximus, its parent company, of mismanagement.

In 2022 and 2023 Maximus workers were involved in actions to demonstrate against labor conditions and for improved pay, following employee layoffs.

<doc id="1268035" wikidata="Q7258927" url="?curid=1268035" title="Puget Sound Energy">
<text>Puget Sound Energy, Inc. (PSE) is an energy utility company based in the U.S. state of Washington that provides electrical power and natural gas to the Puget Sound region. The utility serves electricity to more than 1.2 million customers in Island, King, Kitsap, Kittitas, Pierce, Skagit, Thurston, and Whatcom counties, and provides natural gas to 877,000 customers in King, Kittitas, Lewis, Pierce, Snohomish and Thurston counties. The company&#x27;s electric and natural gas service area spans .

== Facilities ==

PSE&#x27;s electric supplies include utility-owned resources as well as those under long-term contract, for a total capacity of 5,044 megawatts (MW), of which 3,597 MW is PSE-owned generating capacity.

PSE owns coal, hydroelectric, natural gas and wind power-generating facilities, with more than 3,500 MW of capacity. In 2018, PSE&#x27;s generation was 36% coal, 32% hydroelectric, 20% natural gas, and 10% wind derived. Less than one percent originated from other energy efficiency programs.

Coal accounted for 36% of PSE&#x27;s electricity fuel mix in 2018. PSE&#x27;s partial ownership of Eastern Montana&#x27;s Colstrip Generating Station represents the single largest power-generating facility PSE owns, approximately 700 MW of generating capacity. In 2010, the Colstrip Generating station was the 8th largest greenhouse gas emitter among power plants in the United States. In 2019, the Washington Clean Energy Transformation Act mandated that all power utilities remove coal from their generation mix, including &quot;coal by wire&quot; from out of state. As of May 2024, PSE has proactively removed coal from its portfolio by choosing not to purchase energy generated from the Colstrip plant. It intends to sell its 25% stake in the Colstrip plant, but plans to do so have repeatedly fallen through.

Hydroelectricity generated 31% of PSE&#x27;s power supply in 2016. The company operates three hydroelectric facilities:

* The Baker River Hydroelectric Project on the Baker River, generating 170 MW of electricity.
* Snoqualmie Falls Hydroelectric Plant, two power plants on the Snoqualmie River in King County, generating 44 MW.
* The Electron Hydroelectric Project on the Puyallup River in Pierce County generates 22 MW of electricity.

Natural gas-fired power generation accounted for 22% of the utility&#x27;s electricity fuel mix in 2016. The company operates these natural gas-fired facilities:

* The Sumas Generating Station in Whatcom County is a cogeneration natural gas-fired plant capable of generating 125 MW of electricity.
* The Ferndale Generating Station in Whatcom County is a combined-cycle natural gas-fired plant capable of generating 270 MW of electricity.
* The Encogen Generating Station in Whatcom County is a combined-cycle natural gas-fired plant capable of generating 167 MW of electricity.
* The Goldendale Generating Station in Klickitat County is a combined-cycle natural gas-fired plant capable of generating 277 MW of electricity.
* The Mint Farm Generating Station in Cowlitz County is a combined-cycle natural-gas-fired plant capable of generating 310 MW of electricity.
* The Fredonia Generating Station in Skagit County is a simple-cycle natural gas-fired plant capable of generating 316 MW of electricity.
* The Frederickson Generating Station in Pierce County is a simple-cycle natural gas-fired plant capable of generating 147 MW of electricity. 
* The Frederickson 1 Generating Station in Pierce County is a combined-cycle natural gas-fired plant capable of generating 275 MW of electricity. PSE owns a 50% share, or 137 MW. 
* The Whitehorn Generating Station in Whatcom County is a simple-cycle natural gas-fired plant capable of generating 147 MW of electricity.

Wind power and other generation sources, such as biomass and landfill gas, account for 1% of the utility&#x27;s electricity fuel mix. PSE owns and operates these wind-power facilities:

* The Hopkins Ridge Wind Facility in southeast Washington&#x27;s Columbia County began commercial production in 2005. Hopkins Ridge&#x27;s 87 wind turbines have the capacity to generate 157 MW of electricity.
* The Wild Horse Wind and Solar Facility in central Washington&#x27;s Kittitas County began production in 2006 and was expanded to include 22 turbines in 2009. Wild Horse&#x27;s 149 wind turbines have the capacity to generate 273 MW of electricity.
* In 2012, the first phase of the Lower Snake River Wind Project began in Southeast Washington&#x27;s Garfield County. Lower Snaker River Phase 1&#x27;s 149 turbines have the capacity to generate 343 MW of electricity.

Coal-fired power is a major contributor to PSe&#x27;s fuel mix at 36% of PSE&#x27;s 2018 electricity generation sources, the largest share in 2018. The company owns a stake of the Colstrip Unit 3 coal power plant in eastern Montana.

A net metering program allows residential and business customers to return extra renewable energy solar power to the grid. An additional approximately 1% per year of generation comes from—or actually is reduced by—state mandated I-937 energy efficiency programs, adding an average 25 additional &quot;Negawatts&quot; generation capacity per year.

For its natural gas service to customers, PSE purchases a portfolio of natural gas supplies originating in western Canada and the U.S. Rocky Mountain states.

== History ==

PSE was formed in 1997 when two of its largest ancestral companies – Puget Sound Power &amp; Light Company and Washington Energy Company – merged. Puget Sound Power and Light was itself preceded by several companies that were founded in the 1870s and 1880s and built the region&#x27;s first hydroelectric plant at Snoqualmie Falls in 1898. Puget Sound Power had attempted a merger with Washington Water Power in 1952, but it was blocked by a superior court judge.

In October 2007, the company announced that it would be sold to foreign investors led by Macquarie Group, an Australian funds manager, and three Canadian pension funds. Groups in three northwestern counties—Island, Jefferson, and Skagit—filed ballot measures for the November 2008 election to establish public utility districts in response to the planned buyout. The measure was approved in Jefferson County, which formed a public utility district in 2013 and paid PSE $103 million for its assets in the county.

The sale to Macquarie and the pension funds, conducted through a leveraged private equity buyout, was approved in 2009. Puget Holdings, the U.S. title of this group of long-term infrastructure investors, merged with Puget Energy, PSE&#x27;s parent company to form the current business structure. Puget Energy is a holding company incorporated in the State of Washington. All of its operations are conducted through its utility subsidiary, PSE, which is regulated by Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission.

In 2018, Macquarie sold its ownership stake in PSE. PSE&#x27;s current owners are Alberta Investment Management Corporation, British Columbia Investment Management Corporation, OMERS, and PGGM.

The PSE began construction on the controversial Energize Eastside power line project in 2020.

=== Clean Energy Transformation Act ===
In 2019, Governor Jay Inslee signed the Clean Energy Transformation Act into law, requiring that all utilities phase out coal power by 2025, be carbon neutral by 2030 and be carbon free by 2045. All investor owned utilities, including PSE, are required to create a Clean Energy Implementation Plan (CEIP) every four years starting in 2022. In PSE&#x27;s first CEIP, they set a goal to achieve 63% renewable energy by 2025.

== Rates and emissions ==
Puget Sound Energy rates show a typical residential electrical bill (at 1000 kWh per month) of $102.56 and typical a gas bill (at 68 therms per month) of $86. In 2018, PSE reported total carbon-dioxide-equivalent emissions of 10,512,364 metric tons due to electricity operations and 4,989,403 metric tons due to natural gas operations, which equate to 9 and 6 metric tons per customer respectively. PSE figures emissions of 0.169 metric tons per user according to EPA GHG MRR Subpart DD.

<doc id="1268041" wikidata="Q653747" url="?curid=1268041" title="Three Snakes and One Charm">
<text>Three Snakes and One Charm is the fourth studio album by American rock band the Black Crowes. It was released on July 23, 1996, and is their final release on American Recordings.

== Background ==
During the &quot;Amorica or Bust&quot; tour of 1995, many of the relationships within the Black Crowes had soured, including that of brothers Chris and Rich Robinson. &quot;We just fucking hated each other,&quot; Rich noted in the September 1996 issue of &quot;Acoustic Guitar&quot; magazine. &quot;It&#x27;s just a normal phase bands go through. There was a lot of emotional baggage, and everyone got on each other&#x27;s nerves. We almost broke up a few times, but finally we all let go and moved on.&quot;

Chris echoed his brother&#x27;s sentiment in the March 1996 issue of &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine. &quot;Everyone goes through changes,&quot; he stated. &quot;The trick is trying to remember that and keep it together, and having respect for everyone and not judging people because you&#x27;re all goin&#x27; through changes. Perseverance is the thing. You have to get your ego in place.&quot;

With this new attitude in place, the band began planning what would be their fourth studio album. Their previous album, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Amorica&quot;, was very much a studio recording, with a great deal of overdubs and other musical flourishes. This was a distinct change from the band&#x27;s sophomore effort, 1992&#x27;s &quot;The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion&quot;, which was recorded in eight days with little to no overdubs. A great deal of this was attributed to producer Jack Joseph Puig, who manned the board for &quot;Amorica&quot;. &quot;The eight day album was coming off of 15 months of touring and we were still just flying,&quot; then-bassist Johnny Colt told RockNet in 1995. &quot;This time we took some time off beforehand and tried to slow down...We consciously tried to take more time. I&#x27;m not even saying we really needed it, but we wanted to try it. We have worked ourselves into a position to afford to spend a little bit more time and try to make a different step.&quot;

Chris Robinson recalled the &quot;Amorica&quot; process: &quot;It was hard to make because we were depressed and in an angry, confused place. Most of it was personal shit.&quot;

Rather than make another studio record like &quot;Amorica&quot;, the band opted for a different approach in the latter months of 1995. &quot;Chris suggested that rather than book a hotel for six months, it&#x27;d be cooler if we rented a house for everyone to stay in,&quot; Rich Robinson noted in 1996. &quot;So Chris moved into the house, and I brought my little board over to work on the demos. It sounded so cool that I brought my big board over, and the rest of my shit, and we rented a Neve sidecar for 10 extra channels. And we just did it.&quot;

==Writing and production==
As pre-production for &quot;Three Snakes and One Charm&quot; began, several songs were written with Chris and Rich Robinson on different sides of the United States. Rich would write and record music in Atlanta, and send his results to Chris in Los Angeles. &quot;The long-distance writing was just something we did to get the process more concrete,&quot; Rich told &quot;Acoustic Guitar&quot; magazine in 1996. &quot;I had a lot of bits and pieces that I&#x27;d written on tour and I needed to hear what Chris would do with them.&quot;

Once the basic ideas were recorded to tape, the band assembled in the house in Atlanta (dubbed Chateau de la Crowe by the band) to begin the &quot;Three Snakes&quot; sessions. Keyboardist Eddie Harsch recalls: &quot;When we got to Atlanta, Chris and Rich put us in a room and played us the demos. The record was basically written. Twelve songs with vocals, dogs barking in the background, everything. We just looked at each other, like, &#x27;What do you want us to do? It&#x27;s all here.&#x27;&quot; There proved to be a great deal more to do, with the band spending several weeks refining their original demos. Plus, a few other songs were written on the spot, including &quot;Under a Mountain&quot; and &quot;Better When You&#x27;re Not Alone.&quot; In total, the band recorded 26 songs during the sessions.

It was during the recording of &quot;Three Snakes&quot; that the band decided to introduce new elements into the music, the most noticeable being a horn section on &quot;(Only) Halfway to Everywhere&quot; and &quot;Let Me Share The Ride.&quot; &quot;That was the Dirty Dozen Brass Band,&quot; Rich commented in 1996. &quot;They opened for us last year (1995) through the whole American leg of (our) tour. Chris just said, &#x27;Fuck it. We&#x27;ve never had horns that we like. Let&#x27;s go for it.&#x27;&quot;

The band attributed the sonic textures of &quot;Three Snakes&quot; to the nuances of recording in a house. &quot;It&#x27;s a totally different vibe doing it in a house, much more conducive to being creative,&quot; Rich Robinson commented in 1996. Other members of the band credited the more communal atmosphere of Chateau de la Crowe with making the album a success. &quot;We lived and breathed together all day long,&quot; remembers then-bassist Johnny Colt. &quot;It was a caravan of people; people upstairs watching crazy art films, people cutting tracks and eating food. There were dogs running everywhere. And (producer) Jack (Joseph Puig) was pulling his hair out over the whole thing of course.&quot;

Guitarist Marc Ford concurred with Colt&#x27;s sentiment, adding that the atmosphere created by recording in a house fostered his musical relationship with Rich Robinson. &quot;It just keeps flowering,&quot; he noted in 1996. &quot;Rich used to insist he was a rhythm player, and I told him to stick his toe as a lead player in the water a little bit, and now we&#x27;re playing with each other, listening to each other. You can do all that sound-weaving.&quot;

With the bulk of the recording process done, the band returned to Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles to put on the finishing touches and begin the mastering process.

==Promotion and release==
The Black Crowes began the supporting tour for &quot;Three Snakes and One Charm&quot; on July 5, 1996, in Burbank, California, where the album was given its world premiere. The album would see its official release on July 23, 1996, several weeks into a world tour that would go straight through the end of the year and into the next, expanding their in-concert repertoire to more than 90 songs. As a means of promotion, the band performed several radio and television broadcasts to showcase the new album. The most noteworthy of these appearances came when the band appeared on the television program &quot;VH1 Storytellers&quot; in the Summer of 1996. The show was relatively new at the time, with each episode capturing artists performing in front of a (mostly small and intimate) live audience, telling stories about their music, writing experiences and memories. The Black Crowes&#x27; installment was the fifth in the series, which saw 87 episodes over its original run.

&quot;Three Snakes&quot; garnered generally positive reviews upon its release. Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave album three stars on &quot;AllMusic&quot;, stating the album was &quot;a winning album, mainly because the Black Crowes&#x27; musicianship continues to deepen -- the musical fusions and eclecticism are seamless.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine also gave the album three stars, noting that it &quot;works best when it forsakes album-oriented pretension for singular clarity, from the oblique Beatles references on &#x27;Nebakanezer&#x27; and &#x27;Bring On, Bring On&#x27; to the Sly Stone-cum-Al Green funk of &#x27;(Only) Halfway to Everywhere&#x27; and the warm acoustic resignation of &#x27;Better When You&#x27;re Not Alone.&#x27;&quot;

The album&#x27;s cover logo resembles a 45 rpm record insert. A limited box set edition of the album was also made available, comprising seven 7-inch vinyl EPs, a 45 rpm custom adapter in shape of the album&#x27;s cover logo, and a one-sided poster of the band.

<doc id="1268058" wikidata="Q16973996" url="?curid=1268058" title="Melberger Award">
<text>The Melberger Award was given annually to the most outstanding U.S. college football player in Division III of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The award was named after Clifford Melberger, a captain of the 1960 Bucknell University football team, and is presented by Diversified Information Technologies, which Mr. Melberger leads as president.

The Melberger had been one of two awards given to Division III football players, the other being the better-known Gagliardi Trophy. The focus of the two awards has historically been slightly different. The Gagliardi factors in community service, academics, and athletics; the Melberger is, at least theoretically, presented to the best athlete. In recent years the Melberger has fallen into disfavor due to poor publicity and coordination by the firm which now sponsors the award. From the period 2002–2004, the award was given not to the nation&#x27;s most outstanding Division III football players, but to the player in the local region who could attend (at their own cost) the awards ceremony in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. This resulted in the award being given to players who would often struggle to make an all-region team, let alone be named the best player in the country. Prior to 2002, the Melberger Award was funded and supported by the Downtown Wilkes-Barre Touchdown Club. The award was last given in 2011.

<text>Les Chenaux (, meaning &quot;the channels&quot; in French) is a regional county municipality in central Quebec, Canada, in the Mauricie region. The seat is in Saint-Luc-de-Vincennes. It is located adjacent on the east of Trois-Rivières on the Saint Lawrence River. It has a land area of and a population of 17,865 inhabitants in the Canada 2011 Census. Its largest community is the parish of Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel.

Les Chenaux is one of the few regional county municipalities in Quebec that does not constitute its own census division; instead, it is grouped with Trois-Rivières as the single census division of Francheville.
==Geography==
The &quot;Les Chenaux&quot; RCM is an area east of Trois-Rivières, located between the villages of Champlain and Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade on north shore of St. Lawrence River. The MRC is approximately 40 km in length to about 20 kilometers in depth. The territory is crossed by three rivers flowing from north to south: Champlain River, Batiscan River and Sainte-Anne River.

==History==
The RCM was created in 2002, when the area was realigned to make way for the amalgamations of nearby Trois-Rivières and Shawinigan. All of the municipalities, except for Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel (which came from Centre-de-la-Mauricie RCM), used to belong to the former Francheville Regional County Municipality. This RCM was dissolved when six of its municipalities amalgamated with the city of Trois-Rivières, and Saint-Étienne-des-Grès was added to the Maskinongé RCM. The remaining municipalities were grouped into a new regional county called Les Chenaux.

==Subdivisions==
There are 10 subdivisions within the RCM:

;Municipalities (6)
* Batiscan
* Champlain
* Saint-Luc-de-Vincennes
* Saint-Prosper-de-Champlain
* Saint-Stanislas
* Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade

;Parishes (4)
* Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel
* Saint-Maurice
* Saint-Narcisse
* Sainte-Geneviève-de-Batiscan

<doc id="1268073" wikidata="Q26323090" url="?curid=1268073" title="Brazilian advisory rating system">
<text>The Brazilian Advisory Rating (, abbreviated ClassInd) is a content rating system in Brazil for the classification of movies, games and television programs. The ClassInd rating system is controlled by the Advisory Rating Coordination (&quot;Coordenação de Classificação Indicativa&quot;) of the Department of Justice Policies (&quot;Departamento de Políticas de Justiça&quot;). It is established on the National Secretariat of Justice (&quot;Secretaria Nacional de Justiça&quot;) of the Ministry of Justice.

==Staff==
The staff consists of about 10 people, including raters and the administrative staff, having passed public service exams, with various academic backgrounds. These content rating analysts undergo continuous training, and never affix a rating individually. All works are watched by at least two analysts separately and if there is no consensus, the analysis group is broadened.

==Analyses and criteria==
The criteria that guide the public policy of the content rating are supported under 3 broad themes—sex, drugs, and violence—content considered inappropriate to the upbringing of children and adolescents. The analysis is made counterbalancing the frequency, relevance, context, intensity and importance to the plot of scenes, dialogues and images containing violence, drug use and sex/nudity. This margin of subjectivity ensures flexibilities that are critical to the process and the rating result. The analyses consist of three steps: factual description, thematic description and age grading. When the process is finished, it is subjected to the coordination, and finally to the director of the department, who makes the order for publication on the Brazilian Official Journal, along with small content descriptors. The criteria for rating the works were developed taking into account national and international studies and public hearings in all regions across Brazil, including public debates, both face-to-face and online.

Aiming to provide an instrument for the choice of the family, the Practical Guide was created, which claims to bring transparency and objectivity to the public policy of the content rating, showing detailed analysis criteria, subdivided by age groups. They can serve broadcasters, producers and distributors of movies and games and also families and society in general.

The objectivity of the analysis departs from moral considerations and moralistic views. The Ministry of Justice specifically cited that sexual orientation does not aggravate the rating and that, in fact, showing material of respect and encouragement to diversity can attenuate the rating. They also specified that their job is to give an advisory rating for parents, therefore, they do not have any legal right to ban, demand cuts or refuse to rate any work.

==Works==

===Films and television programs===
People under the minimum age indicated by the rating can watch the movie if accompanied by an adult guardian or if they are carrying a consent form, except for 18-rated movies on the cinemas. Movies rated 18 are legally restricted to persons aged 16 and over, and those aged 16 and 17 should be accompanied by an adult guardian. Films for cinema and DVD/Blu-ray releases are previously rated by the ClassInd. TV programs are rated by their own broadcasters and therefore the rating can be accepted or denied if considered inappropriate. Ratings assigned by the broadcaster mirror those assigned by DEJUS, but are preceded by the letter &quot;A&quot;.

===Video games===
The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) system was &quot;de facto&quot; adopted by some Brazilian distributors, consequence of working with North American publishers, and was not translated from English or adapted to the Brazilian culture, being inappropriate for the Brazilian market and leaving most consumers uninformed. It was introduced by Senator José Gregori, that the growing game market in Brazil needed bigger control over the countless games sold in the country every day.

Since 2001, games are rated in Brazil by the Department of Justice, Rating, Titles and Qualification, part of the Ministry of Justice.

The ClassInd rating system is the same for games, films and television programs. Rating is mandatory for all games released in Brazil. However, after becoming a member of the International Age Rating Coalition in 2013, it became easier for digitally distributed games to receive a ClassInd rating.

==Rating ranges==

NOTE: There are also operational descriptions of attenuating and aggravating elements, such as scene composition, relevance, frequency, motivation, among others, that can interfere on the final rating.

==Former ratings==
==Content descriptors==
Information on the rating system includes content descriptors which are a summary of the main rating indicators inserted in the work rated. The list of descriptors explains the rating system and also informs parents and guardians about the type of content that the work contains. 
For instance, a work rated as &quot;10 years old&quot; and with the descriptor &quot;Violence&quot; will contain light violent scenes, while a work rated as &quot;16 years old&quot; and the same descriptor will show stronger violent scenes. 
Below is a list of the fifteen terms used in the rating system:

# &quot;Violência&quot; (Violence); 
# &quot;Violência Extrema&quot; (Extreme Violence); 
# &quot;Conteúdo Sexual&quot; (Sexual Content); 
# &quot;Nudez&quot; (Nudity); 
# &quot;Sexo&quot; (Sex); 
# &quot;Sexo Explícito&quot; (Explicit Sex); 
# &quot;Drogas&quot; (Drugs); 
# &quot;Drogas Lícitas&quot; (Legal Drugs); 
# &quot;Drogas Ilícitas&quot; (Illegal Drugs); 
# &quot;Linguagem Imprópria&quot; (Inappropriate Language); 
# &quot;Atos Criminosos&quot; (Criminal Acts); 
# &quot;Conteúdo Impactante&quot; (Shocking Content);
#&quot;Temas Sensíveis&quot; (Sensitive Themes); 
#&quot;Procedimentos Médicos&quot; (Medical Procedures); 
#&quot;Medo&quot; (Fear). 

== Requesting a rating ==
In order to request a Qualification Rating, one will have to provide a documentation (in a Portuguese-language form) which explains why a media (game/TV show, etc.) is recommended or not to a certain rating. A preview of that media is also compulsory to avoid mistakes during media verification.

The document will have to be sent to the Department of Justice, Rating, Titles and Qualification. There&#x27;s no fee to get the rating and the process from the documents reception to the official rating can take about 20 days.

<doc id="1268078" wikidata="Q630248" url="?curid=1268078" title="Bulgarian Football Union">
<text>The Bulgarian Football Union ( BFS) is the governing body of association football in Bulgaria, and a member of UEFA since 1954. It organizes a football league, Bulgarian Parva Liga, and fields its Bulgaria national football team in UEFA and FIFA-authorised competitions.

== History ==
A legal entity that it claims descent from was founded in 1923 as the football department of the Bulgarian National Sports Federation, which existed until the Soviet invasion of 1944. The football governing body was then known as the Central Football Committee until 1948, the Republican Section for Football from 1948 until 1962 and the Bulgarian Football Federation from 1962 until 1985. On 27 June 1985, the organization was renamed the Bulgarian Football Union, the name that it carries today.

=== Resentment against Mihaylov (2015–2024) ===
Borislav Mihaylov became president of the union in 2004. The results of the national team and leading clubs in the country gradually started to decline in the following years, particularly after UEFA Euro 2004 and fans wanted Mihaylov to leave. On 15 October 2019, after long resentments because of the bad results of the national team and lowering of club level football, coupled with a scandal with the national team in the match against England, which involved racist chants from a group of Bulgarian fans aimed at English players. Following this incident, the sports minister announced that they will not work with the BFU until Mihaylov is in charge. After the England game, Mihaylov resigned. Mihail Kasabov become an interim president, but due to the Covid 19 pandemic, there was not a regular vote for Mihaylov to resign. 

In 2021, to the surprise of many, Mihaylov announced he withdraws his resignation and will be joining the elections for a 5th mandate in 2021. At this point Dimitar Berbatov become a huge opposition of Mihaylov and also joined the elections. On 12 October 2021, Mihaylov won the elections despite the fact few voting violations were noted. In March 2023 the city count dropped lawsuits against Congressional decisions and Mihaylov was confirmed as the president, despite the fact that a few football clubs were kicked out from the vote, because they showed support for Berbatov. 

In October 2023, football fans started a stronger resentment, having banners against Mihaylov on every match. As an answer, BFU started to punish clubs almost every match. The football fans announced they will have a big resentment, uniting ultras from every big football club in the country for the match against Hungary on 16 November 2023. In response to that, BFU and UEFA announced on 6 November that the match will be moved from National stadium to Hristo Botev Stadium in Plovdiv and will be behind closed doors. This decision was taken even harder, as for the first time, a football union didn&#x27;t want their own fans on the stadium. The resentment was forseen to move in Plovdiv outside the stadium. The Hungarians were also not happy with the decision for playing under closed doors and the fans announced they will still go for the match and join the protest against BFU.

On March 17th 2024 Georgi Ivanov was elected president. The election was held amid a lot of controversy in regards to the legitimacy of the outcome.

<text>The gwyniad (&quot;Coregonus pennantii&quot;) is a freshwater whitefish native to Bala Lake () in northern Wales.

The population is threatened by deteriorating water quality and by the ruffe, a fish introduced to the lake in the 1980s and now eating the eggs and fry of gwyniad. As a conservation measure, eggs of gwyniad were transferred to Llyn Arenig Fawr, a nearby reservoir, between 2003 and 2007.

The taxonomy of the genus &quot;Coregonus&quot; is disputed; some authorities assign the gwyniad to the common whitefish (&quot;Coregonus lavaretus&quot;), and a morphological review in 2012 was unable to find any solid evidence for recognizing the gwyniad as a separate species. FishBase and the IUCN list it as a distinct species, &quot;C. pennantii&quot;.

<doc id="1268096" wikidata="Q477444" url="?curid=1268096" title="1857 Fort Tejon earthquake">
<text>The 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake occurred at about 8:20 a.m. (Pacific time) on January 9 in central and Southern California. One of the largest recorded earthquakes in the United States, with an estimated moment magnitude of 7.9, it ruptured the southern part of the San Andreas Fault for a length of about 225 miles (350 km), between Parkfield and Wrightwood. 

Although the epicenter or starting location of the earthquake was near Parkfield, the event is referred to as the Fort Tejon earthquake, because that was the location of the greatest damage. Fort Tejon is just north of the junction of the San Andreas and Garlock Faults, where the Tehachapi, San Emigdio, and Sierra Pelona Transverse Ranges come together.

The earthquake is the most recent large event to occur along that portion of the San Andreas Fault, and is estimated to have had a maximum perceived intensity of IX (&quot;Violent&quot;) on the Modified Mercalli scale (MMI) near Fort Tejon in the Tehachapi Mountains, and along the San Andreas Fault from Mil Potrero (near Pine Mountain Club) in the San Emigdio Mountains to Lake Hughes in the Sierra Pelona Mountains. Accounts of the events&#x27; effects varied widely, including the time of the main shock as well as foreshocks that occurred at several locations earlier in the morning.

==Tectonic setting==
The 1857 earthquake ruptured about of the southern part of the San Andreas Fault, the structure that accommodates most of the displacement along the transform boundary between the North American plate and the Pacific plate. The Pacific plate is moving north relative to the Sierra Nevada-Great Valley Block of the North American plate at about per year. The displacement rate along the various sections that ruptured is per year along the Parkfield, Cholame, Carrizo and Big Bend sections and and per year along the Mojave north and Mojave south sections. Paleoseismic studies have found evidence for many prehistoric earthquakes in the last 3,000 years on this part of the San Andreas Fault.

==Earthquake==
The earthquake ruptured a substantial portion of the southern San Andreas fault, but not the entire length. Thomas H. Jordan, director of the Southern California Earthquake Center, stated that the slip likely stopped in the area near Cajon Pass, perhaps because the tectonic stresses on that part of the fault had been released several decades earlier during the 1812 Wrightwood earthquake. The average slip along the fault was , and a maximum offset of was recorded in the Carrizo Plain area in southeastern San Luis Obispo County. With an estimated magnitude of 7.9, this was the last &quot;Big One&quot; in Southern California. The extreme southernmost portion of the San Andreas fault, which terminates near Bombay Beach at the Salton Sea, last ruptured in 1680.

Surface faulting may have extended beyond the boundaries of the regularly acknowledged slip length. Researchers recorded first and second-hand accounts of the ground crack, which was understood to be recent surface faulting and not just the topography of the existing rift. On the extreme northern end of the rupture zone, the surface cracking extended north of Cholame into San Benito County. On the southern end, the population centers were not as close to the fault, and early observers were probably limited to the stretch of the fault between Fort Tejon and Elizabeth Lake, as that was close to the Stockton – Los Angeles Road, the primary inland north−south route then.

Evidence of uprooted and displaced trees south of Elizabeth Lake indicates surface faulting along a mole track (an &quot;array of en echelon primary Riedel shears with linking compressional rolls and minor thrusts&quot;) that ran directly under three Jeffrey Pines. Two of the three trees examined were tilted in their lower extremity, while the upper portions remained relatively untilted. Tree ring dating confirmed that the trees had originated 10 and 25 years before 1857 and also that the rings began to grow twice as thick on the side in the direction of the tilt. This is a frequently noted compensation of tree tilt. Seismologist Kerry Sieh determined that fault slip and the associated ground disturbance were the source of the mole track and subsequent tree tilt.

===Foreshocks===
Various accounts of the event indicate the presence of foreshocks between one and nine hours before the main event, and based on the (uncertain) distribution of those shocks, it is assumed that the beginning of the fault rupture (the epicenter) was in the area between Parkfield and Cholame, about northwest.

The lack of standardized timekeeping during this period of California&#x27;s history contributed to some of the inaccurate reports of when the pre-shocks occurred. Local solar time was being used in 1857 and San Francisco would have been the locality with the most accurate time kept as it was a center of commerce and other activity. Standard time was not followed until the 1880s, with the Pacific Time Zone being aligned with the 120th meridian. The differences in local times were substantial, with San Francisco at 122.43 W and San Diego at 117.10 W, the difference between the two would be around 22 minutes (4 minutes per degree). At least one individual reported foreshock times that varied by as much as half an hour when speaking to two different newspapers.

The firsthand reports were most abundant for the shocks felt at 1, 2, and 4 hours before the main shock which were later labeled the predawn, dawn, and sunrise shocks. The predawn event shook residents of San Francisco (MMI II – III), San Jose (MMI IV), and Santa Cruz (MMI IV). The dawn shock was felt in those locales plus Fort Tejon and possibly the Carrizo Plain. The sunrise shock was felt in San Francisco (MMI III), Monterey (MMI IV), and Visalia (MMI II – III). Sacramento and Los Angeles did not report any of these events.

Several mid-twentieth-century earthquakes had similar felt reports to the dawn and sunrise shocks, and with close inspection, Sieh theorizes that both events were local to coastal central California, probably between Point Conception and Monterey. Also, during that period, no central California earthquake with a magnitude of less than five had a felt area as large as the two foreshocks, while events larger than magnitude six have had &quot;somewhat larger&quot; felt areas, so it could be said that the foreshocks most likely were between magnitude five and six.

Parkfield earthquakes occurred with exceptionally regular intervals (between 20 and 30 years) between 1857 and 1966. Sieh studied four of these events (1901, 1922, 1934, and 1966) and found that they helped to determine the southeast boundary for the origination of the dawn foreshock. The coverage and intensities of felt reports for that earthquake show a solid resemblance to the Parkfield events. Only one of the four Parkfield events was not felt further southeast than the dawn shock, so Sieh concluded that if the San Andreas was the source of the event, then it was reasonable to assume that the Parkfield to Cholame stretch of the fault was responsible for producing the dawn felt intensities, though the San Andreas is not the only possible source for the dawn event. For example, the November 22, 1952, magnitude six Bryson earthquake &quot;nearly duplicates&quot; the felt reports. That event may have occurred west of the San Andreas on the Nacimiento fault, though the highest felt reports were along the Rinconada fault around southwest of the San Andreas.

===Damage===
Most of the adobe buildings at Fort Tejon were badly damaged and several people were injured there. More buildings were destroyed along a twenty-mile stretch between Fort Tejon and southeast to Elizabeth Lake, a sag pond that was formed directly on the San Andreas fault. Streams and springs experienced disturbances in San Diego and Santa Barbara Counties, while the Kern River, Kern Lake, and Los Angeles River all spilled over their banks. Farther north in Santa Clara County the flow of well water was affected. Ground cracks from liquefaction of swampy ground were observed near the Pueblo de Los Angeles and in the Oxnard Plain, and ground fissures were reported near the Los Angeles, Santa Ana, and Santa Clara Rivers.

Central and southern California were thinly populated at the time and this likely helped limit the damage from the earthquake, but the lack of people present also reduced the number of perspectives to use in determining intensity estimates. Areas with the highest population density like San Francisco, Stockton, and Los Angeles provided enough information about the effects of the earthquake to provide the best estimates of intensity. At downtown Los Angeles, with a maximum perceived intensity of VI, some homes and buildings were cracked, but no major damage was reported. In Ventura (MM VII) the roof of Mission San Buenaventura collapsed and the bell tower was damaged, and farther north, the front wall of the old adobe Mission Santa Cruz chapel collapsed. One of the two deaths reported included a woman who was killed by a collapsing adobe house in nearby Gorman, and an elderly man may have collapsed and died in the Los Angeles area as a result of the earthquake.&lt;ref name=&quot;Agnew_p1722/23&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftershocks===
The main shock was followed by a series of aftershocks that continued for at least 3.75 years, although the total number of large aftershocks was less than would be expected for an earthquake of this size. The four largest aftershocks all had magnitudes greater than 6, although there are large uncertainties in both location and magnitude due to the limited number of data points available. On the night of January 9 there was a large aftershock with an estimated magnitude of about 6.25, with a possible epicenter near the Garlock Fault. The largest aftershock occurred on the afternoon of January 16 with an estimated magnitude of about 6.7, a possible offshore location, and high felt intensities in Southern California communities. Santa Barbara and San Bernardino reported an MM intensity of V and Los Angeles reported V and VI. Two significant events occurred in the San Bernardino area on December 15–16, 1858, with the latter having an estimated magnitude of about 6. The last recorded major aftershock occurred on April 16, 1860, with an estimated magnitude of about 6.3, with an epicenter close to the Parkfield section of the San Andreas Fault.

==Future threat==
Scientists and public service officials have speculated on the threat of another very large earthquake occurring in southern California and what type and scale of damage might result. The portion of the fault that ruptured in 1857 has settled into a period of dormancy and this has given rise to suggestions that future slip along that zone may be characterized by a very large 1857-type event followed by another period of inactivity. The communities of Frazier Park, Palmdale, and Wrightwood are all located very close to the San Andreas fault, though much of the Los Angeles area could be affected even at a greater distance from the rupture area if a similar event were to reoccur there. Swaminathan Krishnan, assistant professor of civil engineering and geophysics at the California Institute of Technology, said that if a similar rupture from Parkfield to Wrightwood were to happen again, it would severely affect the Los Angeles area, with the San Fernando Valley being particularly hard hit.

The Los Angeles Aqueduct and California Aqueduct, two of the principal water transfer infrastructure systems supplying Greater Los Angeles, both cross the San Andreas fault within the main damage zone of the Fort Tejon earthquake, in the Tehachapi and Sierra Pelona Mountains.

<text>Susan Cabot (born Harriet Pearl Shapiro; July 9, 1927 – December 10, 1986) was an American film, stage, and television actress. She rose to prominence for her roles in a variety of Western films, including &quot;Tomahawk&quot; (1951), &quot;The Duel at Silver Creek&quot; (1952), and &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (1953).

After severing her contract with Universal Pictures in the mid-1950s, Cabot returned to performing in theater in New York. She subsequently returned to Hollywood in the later part of the decade, and appeared in a series of films by director Roger Corman, such as &quot;Sorority Girl&quot; (1957), &quot;War of the Satellites&quot;, and &quot;Machine-Gun Kelly&quot; (both 1958). She made her final film appearance in Corman&#x27;s horror feature, &quot;The Wasp Woman&quot; (1959).

Cabot spent the following two decades largely in seclusion, though she did appear in off-Broadway theatre in the early 1960s, and made a 1970 television appearance on the series &quot;Bracken&#x27;s World&quot;. By the 1980s, Cabot was suffering from severe mental illness, including depression, suicidal thoughts, and irrational phobias.

On December 10, 1986, Cabot&#x27;s only child, 22-year-old Timothy Roman, bludgeoned her to death in their Los Angeles home with a weightlifting bar after Cabot purportedly awoke in a panicked state and attacked him. Roman, who had dwarfism and suffered pituitary gland problems, pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter, and was sentenced to three years&#x27; probation for his matricide.

==Biography==
===1927–1946: Early life===
Cabot was born Harriet Pearl Shapiro on July 9, 1927, to a Jewish family in Boston, Massachusetts. She led an early life filled with turmoil; after her father abandoned their family, Cabot&#x27;s mother Elizabeth was institutionalized, leaving Cabot orphaned. She was subsequently raised in eight different foster homes, spending the majority of her early life in the New York City borough of the Bronx. It was posthumously revealed that, while in foster care, Cabot suffered emotional and sexual abuse, which triggered intense post-traumatic stress disorder.

Cabot attended high school in Manhattan, and found employment as an illustrator of children&#x27;s books. She supplemented her income by working as a singer, performing at the Village Barn club in Manhattan. She married her first husband, the artist Martin Sacker, on July 30, 1944, in Washington, DC, while still a minor. Sacker was a childhood friend, and the marriage presented Cabot with an opportunity to leave foster care.

===1947–1959: Acting career===
Cabot made her film debut in Twentieth Century Fox&#x27;s film noir &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; (1947), which was filmed in New York, playing a bit part as a restaurant patron. She was subsequently spotted performing at the Village Barn by a talent scout for Columbia Pictures, who cast her in &quot;On the Isle of Samoa&quot; (1950). This role led to further Hollywood roles, with Cabot signing a contract with Universal Pictures. Her first film with the studio was the 1951 Western &quot;Tomahawk&quot;. The same year, Cabot divorced her husband, Sacker, and was subsequently romantically linked with King Hussein of Jordan for several years.

Based on her performances in the &quot;On the Isle of Samoa&quot; and &quot;Tomahawk&quot;, Cabot appeared as a lead in a series of roles in similar Western and Arabian-themed films, such as &quot;The Battle at Apache Pass&quot; and &quot;The Duel at Silver Creek&quot;, and &quot;Son of Ali Baba&quot; (all 1952). In 1953, she starred in a further two Westerns: &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; and &quot;Ride Clear of Diablo&quot;.

Dissatisfied with her film offers, Cabot asked to be released from her contract in 1954. She returned to New York, and resumed her stage career with a role in a Leonard Kantor–directed, Washington DC–based production of Harold Robbins&#x27; &quot;A Stone for Danny Fisher&quot;. Cabot studied acting with Sanford Meisner in New York, and continued to pursue a stage career, appearing in a short-lived run of the musical &quot;Shangri-La&quot; in Boston in 1959.

Cabot returned to Los Angeles and resumed a film career in the latter part of the 1950s, appearing in a series of films for Roger Corman: &quot;Carnival Rock&quot;, &quot;Sorority Girl&quot;, &quot;The Viking Women and the Sea Serpent&quot; (all 1957), &quot;War of the Satellites&quot;, and &quot;Machine-Gun Kelly&quot; (both 1958). The same year, she had a lead role in the Western &quot;Fort Massacre&quot;, opposite Joel McCrea. Cabot&#x27;s final film role was in Corman&#x27;s horror film &quot;The Wasp Woman&quot; (1959). Speaking on her work with Corman, Cabot recalled it as &quot;Totally mad. It was like a European movie,&quot; though she stated that Corman was &quot;some kind of maverick... he&#x27;s very bright and fast-thinking.&quot;

===1960–1986: Seclusion and later life===
A declassified government memo in 2018 revealed that Cabot was invited by the CIA to a party with King Hussein of Jordan, who was in Los Angeles on a trip and desired female company. While she did not necessarily wish to accomplish the CIA goal of &quot;go to bed with him&quot;, she went to the party and evidently found him charming. Cabot soon had a seven-year affair with King Hussein of Jordan (which the CIA was aware of) and their only child, Timothy Scott, was born out of wedlock in 1964. She received $1500 in monthly support from Hussein. In 1968, she married her second husband Michael Roman with whom she raised Timothy, before again divorcing in 1983.

In the last years of her life, Cabot suffered from depression and suicidal thoughts, and was prey to a wide range of irrational, powerful fears. She was under a licensed psychologist&#x27;s care, but the psychologist found her so troubled and ill that the sessions became &quot;emotionally draining.&quot; Cabot became increasingly unable to care for herself; the interior of her home was littered with spoiled food and old newspapers. In late 1986, Cabot&#x27;s mental health deteriorated significantly. Despite the squalor of the home&#x27;s interior, Cabot still maintained an &quot;adequate&quot; income despite having retired from acting, largely due to real estate investments and her fascination with vintage cars, which she regularly acquired, restored, and resold.

==Death==
On December 10, 1986, Cabot&#x27;s 22-year-old son, Timothy Scott Roman, bludgeoned her to death in her home in the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles, with a weightlifting bar. He was charged with second-degree murder.

At trial, Roman testified that his mother had awakened him while screaming, not recognizing him, and calling for her mother, Elizabeth. When he attempted to call emergency services, she attacked him with a barbell bar and a scalpel. Roman seized the bar from her and beat her repeatedly on the head.

He then hid the bar and scalpel, and told police that a man in a ninja mask had killed his mother (believing no one would believe his story about her mental illness). Roman&#x27;s defense attorneys claimed their client&#x27;s aggressive reaction to his mother&#x27;s attack was due to the drugs he took to counteract his dwarfism and pituitary gland problems because the drugs were linked to Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) prion contamination.

At the close of the trial, prosecutors changed the charge to involuntary manslaughter, as no evidence had been presented at trial to support premeditation (which was required for a murder conviction). Superior Court Judge Darlene E. Schempp deliberated 10 minutes, and then convicted Roman of involuntary manslaughter. Roman, who had already spent years in jail, was sentenced to three years&#x27; probation on November 28, 1989, and ordered to seek psychiatric counseling. He was given credit for the time he had already served in jail awaiting trial.

<text>Matthew Stephen Leinart (born May 11, 1983) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for seven seasons. He played college football for the USC Trojans, where he won the Heisman Trophy and led his team to an undefeated season as a junior. Selected tenth overall by the Arizona Cardinals in the 2006 NFL draft, Leinart primarily served as Kurt Warner&#x27;s backup for four seasons. He spent his final three seasons in a backup role for the Houston Texans and the Oakland Raiders. Leinart was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2017.

==Early life==
Leinart was born in Santa Ana, California with strabismus (commonly known as &quot;crossed eyes&quot;); his left eye was not aligned correctly with his right. He underwent surgery when he was three years old and was fitted with special glasses to correct the problem, but the eyewear combined with Leinart&#x27;s already-overweight frame made him an easy target for other children&#x27;s ridicule. &quot;I used to get made fun of for being cross-eyed. It&#x27;s just a terrible thing because kids are so cruel to the fat kid, to the kid with the glasses. So I turned to sports,&quot; he would later say.

Leinart attended Mater Dei High School and was a letterman in football and basketball. As a junior, he led his team to a California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Division I co-championship and was named the Serra League&#x27;s Offensive Most Valuable Player. Wearing number 7, he was chosen as the Gatorade California high school football player of the year.

As one of the nation&#x27;s top college football recruits, Leinart committed to USC under coach Paul Hackett, noting that a major factor was offensive coordinator Hue Jackson. However, after Hackett and most of his staff were fired in 2000, Leinart considered other programs such as Georgia Tech and Arizona State, and visited Oklahoma and Michigan before USC eventually hired Pete Carroll.

==College career==

===2001–2003 seasons===
Leinart attended the University of Southern California, where he played for coach Pete Carroll&#x27;s USC Trojans football team from 2001 to 2005. He redshirted in 2001. As a freshman the next year, he understudied senior quarterback Carson Palmer, who went on to win the Heisman Trophy and was drafted first overall by the Cincinnati Bengals in the 2003 NFL draft. Leinart appeared in only a few plays in 2002 but did not throw any passes. As a sophomore in 2003, Leinart competed with redshirt junior Matt Cassel, who was Palmer&#x27;s backup the previous season, and Purdue transfer Brandon Hance for the vacant starting quarterback position. Going into the season, Carroll and his coaching staff selected Leinart, not because he had set himself significantly ahead of the pack in practice, but because they had to pick one of the three as the starting quarterback.

When the coaching staff told Leinart he would be the starter, he replied, &quot;You&#x27;re never going to regret this.&quot; There was some thought in the press that Leinart would merely hold the starting position until highly touted true freshman John David Booty, who had bypassed his senior year in high school to attend USC, could learn the offense.

Leinart&#x27;s first career pass was a touchdown against Auburn in a 23–0 victory in the season opener. He won the first three games of his career before the then-#3 Trojans suffered a 34–31 triple-overtime defeat to California on September 27 that dropped the Trojans to #10. Leinart and the Trojans bounced back the next week against Arizona State. Leinart injured his knee in the second quarter and was not expected to play again that day, but he returned to the game and finished 13-of-23 for 289 yards in a 37–17 victory.

Leinart and the Trojans won their final eight games and finished the regular season 11–1 and ranked No. 1 in the AP and coaches&#x27; polls. However, USC was left out of the BCS championship game after finishing third in the BCS behind Oklahoma and LSU. The Trojans went to the Rose Bowl and played the University of Michigan. Leinart was named the Rose Bowl MVP after he went 23-of-34 for 327 yards, throwing three touchdowns and catching a touchdown of his own from wide receiver Mike Williams. In 13 starts, Leinart was 255 for 402 for 3,556 yards, 38 touchdowns, and nine interceptions. He finished sixth in the Heisman voting. He was the Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year.

In recognition of his Rose Bowl accomplishments, Leinart was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame in 2019.

===2004 season===
The Trojans started Leinart&#x27;s junior season (2004) with victories in their first three games. On September 25, the Trojans played Stanford. After Stanford took a 28–17 halftime lead, Leinart sparked the offense with a 51-yard pass to Steve Smith and scored on a one-yard sneak to cut the Cardinal lead to four points. Leinart and the Trojans were able to take the lead on a LenDale White rushing touchdown and held on for the victory, 31–28. Leinart completed 24 of 30 passes. 
Leinart finished the final regular season game against UCLA, but was held without a touchdown pass for the first time in 25 starts. Nonetheless, Leinart was invited to New York for the Heisman ceremony, along with teammate Reggie Bush, Oklahoma&#x27;s freshman running back sensation Adrian Peterson, quarterback and incumbent Heisman winner Jason White, and Utah&#x27;s quarterback Alex Smith. In what many had considered one of the more competitive Heisman races, Leinart became the sixth USC player to claim the Heisman Trophy.

In 2004, USC went wire-to-wire at No. 1 in the polls and earned a bid to the BCS title game at the Orange Bowl against Oklahoma, which was also 12–0. A dream matchup on paper (including White vs. Leinart, which was to be the first time two Heisman winners would play against each other), the Orange Bowl turned out to be a rout, as Leinart threw for five touchdown passes on 18-for-35 passing and 332 yards to lead the Trojans to a 55–19 victory. Leinart received Orange Bowl MVP honors and the Trojans claimed their first BCS National Championship and second straight No. 1 finish in the AP, extending their winning streak to 22 games. This victory and BCS championship were later vacated as a result of the Reggie Bush scandal (though the AP national championship still stands). He won Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year for the second consecutive season but shared it with Reggie Bush.

===2005 season===
Against Notre Dame, Leinart threw for a career-high 400 yards. After an incomplete pass and a sack led to a fourth-and-nine situation with 1:36 left—at the Trojans&#x27; own 26-yard line, Leinart called an audible &quot;slant and go&quot; route at the line of scrimmage and threw deep against the Irish&#x27;s man-to-man coverage, where Dwayne Jarrett caught the ball and raced to the Irish&#x27; 13-yard line, a 61-yard gain. Leinart moved the ball to the goal line as time dwindled and scored on a quarterback sneak that gave the Trojans a 34–31 lead with three seconds to go, giving the Trojans their 28th straight victory and one of the most memorable and dramatic finishes in the history of the Notre Dame–USC rivalry.

The 2005 Trojans again had a perfect 12–0 regular season. Leinart was again invited to New York for the Heisman ceremony along with teammate Reggie Bush and Texas quarterback Vince Young. As a former Heisman winner, Leinart cast his first-place vote for Bush, and ended up third in the voting behind Bush and runner-up Young.

The Trojans advanced to the Rose Bowl to face Vince Young and #2 Texas in the BCS title game. The title game was considered another &quot;dream matchup&quot;. Leinart completed 29 of 40 passes for a touchdown and 365 yards, but was overshadowed by Young, who piled up 467 yards of total offense and rushed for three touchdowns, including a score with 19 seconds remaining and two-point conversion to put the Longhorns ahead, 41–38. The Trojans lost for the first time in 35 games, and Leinart for just the second time in his 39 career starts. After graduation, Leinart&#x27;s #11 jersey was retired at USC.

Leinart finished his college career with 807 completions on 1,245 attempts (64.8% completion percentage) for 10,693 yards, 99 touchdowns, and 23 interceptions. At the time of his departure, he was USC&#x27;s all-time leader in career touchdown passes and completion percentage, and was second at USC behind Carson Palmer in completions and yardage. He averaged nearly 8.6 yards per attempt, and averaged only one interception every 54 attempts. He was 37–2 as a starter.

==Professional career==
===Pre-draft===
Projected to be the first overall pick of the 2005 NFL draft, Leinart&#x27;s draft stock decreased after he chose to return to USC for his senior season. Nonetheless, he remained one of the top prospects in the 2006 NFL draft. Scouts considered Leinart to be the archetypal NFL quarterback in size at and , although his arm strength drew concerns.

===Arizona Cardinals===
Leinart was selected tenth overall in the first round of the 2006 NFL draft by the Arizona Cardinals. Leinart was the draft&#x27;s second-highest selected quarterback after Vince Young, who defeated Leinart&#x27;s team in the Rose Bowl.

Leinart spent four seasons with the Cardinals, primarily as a backup for veteran Kurt Warner.

In his first season, after a contentious negotiation making him the last member of the draft to sign a contract, Leinart agreed to a six-year, $51 million contract on August 14. Leinart played in the second quarter of the exhibition game against the New England Patriots on August 19.

Cardinals head coach Dennis Green held a press conference after a poor performance by Warner in Week 3 and announced Leinart would start. He made his debut in the fourth game of the season, throwing two touchdown passes.

In Week 6 against the 5–0 Chicago Bears, Leinart threw two touchdown passes in the first half, but the Bears came back in the second half to win 24–23.

In a November 26 game against the Minnesota Vikings, Leinart set a then-NFL rookie record with 405 passing yards, but only produced a quarterback rating of 74.0 as the team ultimately lost. He suffered a sprained left shoulder (throwing arm) in the Week 16 win over the San Francisco 49ers. In 11 starts, Leinart threw for 2,547 yards, 11 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. He finished the season with a 4–7 record.

Leinart opened the 2007 season on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; against the San Francisco 49ers as the starting quarterback. After a sequence of drives, the offense stalled, which led new head coach Ken Whisenhunt to begin inserting Warner as a situational quarterback. On October 7, 2007, Leinart suffered a fractured left collarbone after being sacked by St. Louis Rams linebacker Will Witherspoon. Three days later, he was placed on injured reserve, ending his season. In his first two NFL seasons, Leinart had suffered two season-ending injuries, both due to being sacked. With Warner at the helm for the remainder of the season, the Cardinals mounted a late-season surge and won five of their final eight games.

In Leinart&#x27;s second season with Arizona, he started five games, completed 53.6% of his passes (60/112), and threw for 647 yards, 5.8 yards per attempt, two touchdowns, and four interceptions. His passer rating was 61.9. He averaged 129 yards and 0.4 touchdowns per start. In the 2008 offseason, after he recovered from the injury, Leinart was handed his starting job back. Still, his hold on the job was tenuous after another strong training camp performance by Warner. Finally, after Leinart threw three interceptions within a matter of minutes versus the Oakland Raiders in the third preseason game, Warner was named the opening-day starter. Leinart picked up only a limited number of snaps in mop-up duty behind Warner. Warner started 16 games and took the Cardinals to their first ever Super Bowl, cementing his status as starter and Leinart&#x27;s status as a backup. For the 2008 season, he completed 15 of 29 passing attempts (51.7%), one touchdown, one interception, and an 80.2 passer rating. In 2009, Leinart continued his role as back-up for Warner, who started all but one regular season game.

In 2010, Leinart was named the presumptive starter after Warner&#x27;s retirement. However, due to poor play, the starting job in training camp was given to Derek Anderson. The Cardinals released Leinart on September 4, two days after the final preseason game, in favor of Anderson and rookies Max Hall and John Skelton.

===Houston Texans===
On September 6, 2010, the NFL announced that Leinart signed a one-year contract to back up Matt Schaub with the Houston Texans. Since Schaub played all 16 games, Leinart did not play during the 2010 season. During the 2011 offseason, despite speculation that he would sign with the Seattle Seahawks, who were coached by Leinart&#x27;s college coach Pete Carroll, and compete for a starting job, Leinart ultimately agreed to return to Houston as a backup for the 2011 season. In Week 10, Schaub injured his right foot and the Texans named Leinart their starter. Leinart started for the first time in Week 12 against the Jacksonville Jaguars; however, during the first half he fractured his collarbone and was replaced by rookie quarterback T. J. Yates. At this point in his career, Leinart already suffered three season-ending injuries (2006, 2007, 2011) within his last eight starts.

On March 12, 2012, Leinart was released by the Texans.

===Oakland Raiders===
Leinart signed with the Oakland Raiders on May 1, 2012, as a backup to his former college teammate and fellow Heisman winner Carson Palmer. After Palmer suffered an injury in Week 16, Leinart and Terrelle Pryor split first-team reps. Pryor ended up getting the start in Week 17 and Leinart was not re-signed by the Raiders the following offseason.

===Buffalo Bills===
After injuries to quarterbacks EJ Manuel (knee surgery) and Kevin Kolb (concussion), the Bills decided to sign Leinart on August 25, 2013. Leinart and Thad Lewis (who was brought in on the same day through a trade) would compete for the fourth-string quarterback job behind undrafted rookie Jeff Tuel. Lewis won the competition, and Leinart was released by the team on August 30, 2013.

==NFL career statistics==
==Personal life==
Leinart has a son with Brynn Cameron, a former USC women&#x27;s basketball player. The couple split before their son&#x27;s birth.

His mother was Linda (née Primak) and his father is Bob Leinart.

In May 2018, Leinart married &quot;Make It or Break It&quot; and &quot;The Mentalist&quot; actress Josie Loren at the Basilica of St. Lawrence in Asheville, North Carolina. In January 2020, Loren gave birth to Leinart&#x27;s second son. In May 2021, Loren had his third son.

As of January 2023, Leinart is an analyst on Big Noon Kickoff for Fox Sports 1.

<doc id="1268109" wikidata="Q837001" url="?curid=1268109" title="Northrop HL-10">
<text>The Northrop HL-10 is one of five US heavyweight lifting body designs flown at NASA&#x27;s Flight Research Center (FRC—later Dryden Flight Research Center) in Edwards, California, from July 1966 to November 1975 to study and validate the concept of safely maneuvering and landing a low lift-over-drag vehicle designed for reentry from space. It was a NASA design and was built to evaluate &quot;inverted airfoil&quot; lifting body and delta planform. It currently is on display at the entrance to the Armstrong Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base.

==Development==
Northrop Corporation built the HL-10 and Northrop M2-F2, the first two of the fleet of &quot;heavy&quot; lifting bodies flown by the NASA Flight Research Center. The contract for construction of the HL-10 and the M2-F2 was $1.8 million. &quot;HL&quot; stands for horizontal landing, and &quot;10&quot; refers to the tenth design studied by engineers at NASA&#x27;s Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia. Main gear was a modified T-38 system retracted manually, and lowered by nitrogen pressure. Nose gear was a modified T-39 unit, retracted manually and lowered with nitrogen pressure. Pilot Ejection System was a modified F-106 system. Silver zinc batteries provided electrical power for the control system, flight instruments, radios, cockpit heat, and stability augmentation system. To assist in pre-landing flare, four throttleable hydrogen peroxide rockets provided up to 400 lbf (1.8 kN) of thrust.

==Operational history==

After delivery to NASA in January 1966, the HL-10 made its first flight on December 22, 1966, with research pilot Bruce Peterson in the cockpit. Although the XLR-11 rocket engine (same type used in the Bell X-1) was installed, the first 11 drops from the B-52 launch aircraft were unpowered glide flights to assess handling qualities, stability, and control. In the end, the HL-10 was judged to be the best handling of the three original heavy-weight lifting bodies (M2-F2/F3, HL-10, X-24A).

The HL-10 was flown 37 times during the lifting body research program and logged the highest altitude and fastest speed in the lifting body program. On February 18, 1970, Air Force test pilot Peter Hoag piloted the HL-10 to Mach 1.86 (). Nine days later, NASA pilot William H. &quot;Bill&quot; Dana flew the vehicle to , which became the highest altitude reached in the program.

During a typical lifting body flight, the B-52—with the research vehicle attached to the pylon mount on the right wing between the fuselage and inboard engine pod—flew to a height of about and a launch speed of about .

Moments after being dropped, the XLR-11 was lit by the pilot. Speed and altitude increased until the engine was shut down by choice or fuel exhaustion, depending upon the individual mission profile. The lifting bodies normally carried enough fuel for about 100 seconds of powered flight and routinely reached from and speeds above Mach 1.

Following engine shutdown, the pilot maneuvered the vehicle through a simulated return-from-space corridor into a pre-planned approach for a landing on one of the lakebed runways on Rogers Dry Lake at Edwards. A circular approach was used to lose altitude during the landing phase. On the final approach leg, the pilot increased his rate of descent to build up energy. At about altitude, a &quot;flare out&quot; maneuver dropped air speed to about for the landing.

Unusual and valuable lessons were learned through the successful flight testing of the HL-10. During the early phases of the Space Shuttle development program, lifting bodies patterned on the HL-10 shape were one of three major types of proposals. These were later rejected as it proved difficult to fit cylindrical fuel tanks into the always-curving fuselage, and from then on most designs focused on more conventional delta wing craft.

*HL-10 pilots
**John A. Manke — 10 flights, 7 powered flights
**William H. Dana — 9 flights, 8 powered flights
**Jerauld R. Gentry — 9 flights, 2 powered flights
**Peter C. Hoag — 8 flights, 7 powered flights
**Bruce Peterson — 1 flight, 0 powered flights

===Unrealized space flight===
According to the book &quot;Wingless Flight&quot;, by project engineer R. Dale Reed, the HL-10 was considered to fly into space in the early to mid-1970s. Following the cancellation of the Apollo moon project, Reed realized that there would be substantial Apollo hardware left over, including several flight-rated command service modules (CSM) and Saturn V rockets.

The proposal was to add an ablative heat shield, reaction controls, and other additional subsystems needed for crewed spaceflight to the HL-10. The now space-rated vehicle would have then been launched in the space for the Lunar Module on a Saturn V launch vehicle with an Apollo CSM. Once in Earth orbit, it was planned that a robotic extraction arm would remove the HL-10 from the rocket&#x27;s third stage and place it adjacent to the crewed Apollo CSM spacecraft. One of the astronauts would then spacewalk from the Apollo and board the lifting body to perform a pre-reentry check on its systems.

It was planned that there would be two flights in this program. In the first, the lifting body pilot would return to the Apollo and send the HL-10 back to earth uncrewed. If this flight was successful, the second launch would be involve a piloted landing at Edwards AFB. Reportedly, Wernher von Braun was enthusiastic about the mission, offering to prepare two Saturn Vs and Apollo Command Service Modules. However, he was overridden by the Flight Research Center director, and nothing came of the proposal. Launching a Saturn V to low Earth orbit with a light payload would not be an efficient use of capability, and the Apollo program was ended mainly on cost grounds.

==Fictional references==
In the pilot movie, and an episode of &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; series, titled &quot;The Deadly Replay&quot;, the HL-10 serial number 804 is identified as the aircraft flown by Col. Steve Austin when he crashed, leading to his transformation into a bionic man, and the HL-10 is also featured in this episode. Other episodes and Martin Caidin&#x27;s original novel, &quot;Cyborg&quot;, contradict this, however, by identifying Austin&#x27;s aircraft as a fictional cousin of the HL-10, the M3-F5. Further confusion is added by the fact that both the HL-10 and the M2-F2 are featured in the opening credits of the television show.

<doc id="1268112" wikidata="Q1912316" url="?curid=1268112" title="Royal Bahraini Air Force">
<text>The Royal Bahraini Air Force (, abbreviated as RBAF, formerly known as Bahrain Amiri Air Force) is the aerial warfare branch of the Bahrain Defence Force (BDF). Originally formed as the BDF Air Wing in 1976, it became an independent service branch in 1987. The RBAF was involved in combat operations during the Gulf War and the Saudi-led intervention in the Yemeni civil war.

Bahrain has developed a well-equipped air force and was the second country in the Gulf Cooperation Council after Saudi Arabia to acquire advanced fighters, namely the F-16C/D in 1989, which have been the RBAF&#x27;s main combat aircraft since then. Bahrain was the first country in the Gulf to use the F-16. In the early 2010s Bahrain decided to replace its older F-5E and F-5F fighters with more modern planes, as well as to modernize its existing F-16 fleet. It ordered 16 new planes of the F-16 Block 70 variant, which it expects to acquire in 2024.

== History ==
=== Founding and early expansion ===

The Bahrain Defence Force, which itself was formed in 1968, just before the country became independent from United Kingdom in 1971, first organized an air wing in May 1976 at Riffa Air Base, which received its first aircraft, four Bo 105 helicopters, in February 1977. This occurred after Bahrain sent the air wing&#x27;s future members to receive training from allied countries in 1974. The small force grew gradually, receiving 12 Augusta Bell Twin Huey helicopters in 1978, and in the mid-1980s the air wing became the new Bahrain Amiri Air Force (BAAF). In the early years the Bahraini Air Force participated in training with other countries and helped recover U.S. Navy sailors after the USS &quot;Stark&quot; incident during the Iran-Iraq War. Because of regional conflicts like the Iran-Iraq War and the Gulf War, during the 1980s and 1990s Bahrain expanded its military with the assistance of the United States, including its Air Force.

In 1985 Bahrain acquired its first fighter jets, the F-5, and established the 6th Fighter Squadron at Muharraq Air Base. After Bahraini air crews became familiar with the F-5, they underwent training to prepare to use the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The first Bahraini F-16s, the F-16C/D variants, were acquired in 1990. This made Bahrain the first Gulf country to use the F-16. Before this, the country considered several American and European advanced fighter aircraft, including the F-15 Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F/A-18 Hornet, Mirage 2000, and Tornado. Bahraini pilots were trained on F-16 operations at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida in 1989, and the first F-16 formally was handed over to the BAAF in March of that year. The first four F-16s were sent to Bahrain, flown by Bahraini pilots, in May 1990. 
Around this time the construction of Isa Air Base was complete, which is where the Bahraini F-16s have been based. Both the F-16 and the F-5 were operated by Bahrain in the Gulf War, during which the BAAF carried out air strikes against Iraq. The new Bahraini F-16s were flown by the 1st Tactical Fighter Squadron in Operation Desert Storm, operating alongside coalition forces, which included 200 American aircraft based out of the Isa Air Base, along with the BAAF. The operations lasted from 25 January 1991 until the end of the war, with an average of six sorties per day. 

A second batch of ten F-16s commenced delivery in 2000 under the Peace Crown II program. The new aircraft represented a further increase in the air force&#x27;s combat capabilities, as they were equipped to carry the AMRAAM missile, first used by the USAF in 1992. Air-to-air armament had been limited to the short-range AIM-9M Sidewinder missile and internal cannon through the Gulf War. After the war, the country began to acquire more advanced weapons, including the AIM-7M Sparrow radar-guided air-to-air missile and LANTIRN navigation and targeting pod for air-to-ground weapons that would also be acquired such as the GBU-10/12 laser guided bombs and AGM-65D/G Maverick air-to-ground missiles.

In 1994 the 8th Helicopter Squadron was established with Bell AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters, followed by the 9th Helicopter Squadron in 1997, for the purpose of providing close air support to the Royal Bahraini Army. In 1999 the Air Defense Wing, equipped with the Hawk missile system, was brought under the control of the Air Force. 

===21st century===
In July 2000, Bahrain signed a deal with BAE Systems to establish a pilot academy based around the Hawk Trainer, similar to the NFTC in Canada. Subsequently, orders were placed for Slingsby T67 Firefly and BAE Hawk trainers. The first trainers were delivered in October 2006.

After Bahrain became a monarchy on 14 February 2002, the BAAF was renamed the Royal Bahraini Air Force.

Upgrade of the helicopter force has included new utility transports, and on 19 June 2007, Bahrain signed a letter of offer and acceptance for nine UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters to be purchased as part of the Foreign Military Sales program through the United States Army. These are designated for use in a variety of roles, including combat search and rescue. They were the international launch customer for the UH-60M variant of the venerable S-70 helicopter family. Deliveries commenced on 1 December 2009

A single Sikorsky S-92 VVIP helicopter was purchased by the Air Force in 2007 and placed in service with the Bahrain Royal Flight.

Bahrain would again engage in combat operations as part of the Saudi Arabia-led Operation Decisive Storm, operating from bases in Saudi Arabia against Houthi rebel forces in Yemen during March and April 2015. Initially, fifteen F-16 aircraft were deployed as the RBAF contribution to combat forces in the operation. Bahrain&#x27;s forces remained in Saudi Arabia in assistance of the coalition through 2015. An RBAF F-16 was lost when it crashed after a technical problem in December 2015. The Bahraini Air Force ended its participation in the operation in Yemen in February 2016.

In 2018, Lockheed Martin was awarded a $1.1 billion contract to produce 16 F-16 Viper Block 70 fighter aircraft for Bahrain, the U.S. Department of Defense said in a release.

Work under the $1,124,545,002 fixed-price-incentive-firm contract is expected to be complete by 30 September 2023, the Friday, 22 June release said.

In October, the government of Bahrain announced that it had finalized a $3.8 billion deal with Lockheed for the F-16 purchase. Bahrain Royal Air Force commander Major General Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah Al Khalifa said the Gulf state hoped the first planes will be delivered in 2021.

The sale of F-16 Vipers and related equipment to Bahrain was first approved by the U.S. State Department in 2016 during the Obama administration but it was delayed over human rights concerns. President Donald Trump dropped the human rights conditions last year.

The State Department then approved the sale of 19 aircraft worth $2.78 billion, and another $1.1 billion to upgrade Bahrain&#x27;s existing fleet of 20 F-16s to the Viper configuration in September 2017. The proposed sales also include additional equipment and support. Hamid said in October that the purchase of the other three aircraft was still a possibility.

=== Incidents and accidents ===
* 27 September 2003: F-16C Block 40 Fighting Falcon (s/n RBAF 204; c/n AC-12) crashed in the Persian Gulf, north of Bahrain. This was the first F-16 loss for Bahrain and attributed to the pilot becoming disoriented during maneuvers.
* 30 December 2015: An F-16 Fighting Falcon crashed in Jizan Province, Saudi Arabia while supporting the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. The pilot was recovered safely and the crash was attributed to technical issues.

== Future ==
Bahrain is planning to recapitalize its fighter fleet. Replacement of the F-5 fleet is to be accomplished with additional F-16 orders in the near term, while longer-term plans call for a more capable aircraft to be acquired to add to or replace the F-16 fleet. Bahrain is considering buying the Eurofighter Typhoon, the JAS 39 Gripen, the Dassault Rafale, or the F-35 Lightning II. The British government is in early talks with Bahrain over a potential order for the Eurofighter Typhoon fighter. In September 2016 it was announced that the sale of up to 19 further F-16s had been submitted to the US Congress for approval, however the White House later advised that it would not complete the approval unless it showed progress on human rights issues arising from the Bahraini protests of 2011. In September 2017, the United States Defense Security Cooperation Agency approved the sale of up to 22 F-16 Block 70/72 aircraft, as well as the sale of 20 upgrade kits to upgrade Bahrain&#x27;s existing F-16 fleet to the F-16V Viper variant, the most advanced variant of the F-16, featuring the AN/APG-83 active electronically scanned array radar, a new mission computer developed by Raytheon, modern cockpit displays and other electronics upgrades. In October 2017, Bahraini officials announced that Bahrain had signed a deal worth $3.8 billion with Lockheed Martin for upgraded F-16s, as well as upgrade kits for the Air Force&#x27;s existing F-16 fleet.

Bahrain has confirmed its order for 12 Bell AH-1Z Viper, six months after the US Department of State approved the deal, worth an estimated $912 million, under the Foreign Military Sales process. The attack helicopters will be delivered from the second half of 2022.

Helicopters Enhance Training Proficiency of Royal Bahrain Air Force. Bell Textron Inc., a Textron Inc. (NYSE: TXT) company, announced the delivery of 3 Bell 505 helicopters to the Royal Bahrain Air Force. Bell delivered the aircraft during an inspection and acceptance event in February 2023 at Bell&#x27;s Mirabel facility

In March 2023, Bahrain has requested the purchase of 24 surplus Bell AH-1W Super Cobra attack helicopters from the US, via a Foreign Military Sales deal worth an estimated million.

<doc id="1268114" wikidata="Q2705955" url="?curid=1268114" title="Powan">
<text>The powan (Coregonus clupeoides) is a kind of freshwater whitefish endemic to two lochs in Scotland, Loch Lomond and Loch Eck. It has been successfully introduced in two other sites, Loch Sloy and the Carron Valley Reservoir.

Powan populations are relatively healthy, but may have been negatively impacted by the introduced ruffe, which eats powan eggs and fry. As a conservation action, an attempt to establish populations in four additional lochs has been undertaken.

The taxonomic status of the British whitefish populations, including powan, is a matter of debate. Currently the Scottish powan, along with the Welsh gwyniad known from a single lake, and four similar populations in England known as schelly, are generally considered belonging to the widespread Eurasian common whitefish (&quot;Coregonus lavaretus&quot;). This accords with the close genetic similarity among these units, and the absence of clear morphological differences between them. FishBase and the IUCN continue to recognize the Scottish powan as a distinct species, &quot;Coregonus clupeoides&quot;.

==Ecology==
This fish is benthopelagic, feeding on the lakebed on insect larvae and crustaceans. In Loch Lomond, this fish exhibits a pattern of daily migration to feeding sites and of seasonal migration to breeding grounds. Before the breeding season, the mature males begin to congregate in deep water near the spawning beds; these are shallow areas of gravel and pebbles washed by waves. In late December and January they move into the shallows where they are joined by the ripe females, and spawning is completed by early February, after which the fish disperse to other parts of the loch. The eggs are eaten by brown trout (&quot;Salmo trutta&quot;), common roach (&quot;Rutilus rutilus&quot;), other powan and &quot;Phryganea&quot; larvae, and the adult powan are heavily predated by the northern pike (&quot;Esox lucius&quot;) at breeding time.

<doc id="1268119" wikidata="Q1950774" url="?curid=1268119" title="Mount Victoria (Auckland)">
<text>Takarunga / Mount Victoria is the highest volcano on Auckland&#x27;s North Shore, rising to 66 metres in elevation. Its age is currently unknown. Its lava flows now line much of Devonport&#x27;s waterfront. Takarunga was the location of an important pā used by Tāmaki Māori peoples. In the late 19th century, a gun fort was built on top of the hill, in order to defend the city of Auckland. As a designated tūpuna maunga, the mountain has been governed by the Tūpuna Maunga Authority, along with thirteen other cones throughout Auckland, since 2014.

==Geography==
The hill provides panoramic views of Auckland&#x27;s Waitematā Harbour and the inner Hauraki Gulf. Over the years the peak and upper slopes have housed a signal station for shipping, artillery emplacements, farmland, and various concrete army bunkers, some from as early as the 1870s. One bunker now serves as the venue for the Devonport Folk Music Club.

The slopes of Takarunga / Mount Victoria are also home to Devonport Primary School, Takarunga Playcentre, a tennis court, a cemetery, a water reservoir which maintains supply to the area, and a scenic lookout. The old Signalman&#x27;s House is now home to the Michael King Writers Centre which provides writers-in-residence programmes, hosting for visiting writers, residential workshops for experienced writers, and a series of workshops for young poets and emerging writers. The writer-in-residence programmes are supported by Creative New Zealand and the University of Auckland.

== History ==
An important pā once occupied its slopes; some of its earthworks can still be seen. In the 18th century, Takarunga was seasonally occupied by Waiohua paramount chief Kiwi Tāmaki, during the seasons for bird catching and preservation. The traditional name, Takarunga, literally means &quot;The Hill Standing Above&quot;, and contrasts with Mount Cambria, a now-quarried hill known by the name Takararo, or &quot;The Hill Standing Below&quot;. A scoria mound known as Duders Hill, on Takarunga / Mount Victoria&#x27;s southern slopes was mostly quarried away.
French navigator Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville climbed the hill in 1827, and it was given the name Mount Victoria, referring to Queen Victoria, by early settlers. 

In 1841 a signal station was constructed on the peak, to better facilitate traffic to the Port of Auckland, and in 1880 the hill became a public reserve. In 1885, a gun fort was constructed on the peak, which was in use until after World War II.

=== Treaty settlement ===
In the 2014 Treaty of Waitangi settlement between the Crown and the &quot;Ngā Mana Whenua o Tāmaki Makaurau&quot; collective of 13 Auckland iwi and hapū (also known as the Tāmaki Collective), ownership of the 14 Tūpuna Maunga of &quot;Tāmaki Makaurau&quot; / Auckland, was vested to the collective, including the volcano officially named Takarunga / Mount Victoria. The legislation specified that the land be held in trust &quot;for the common benefit of Ngā Mana Whenua o Tāmaki Makaurau and the other people of Auckland&quot;. The Tūpuna Maunga o Tāmaki Makaurau Authority or Tūpuna Maunga Authority (TMA) is the co-governance organisation established to administer the 14 Tūpuna Maunga. Auckland Council manages the Tūpuna Maunga under the direction of the TMA.

<text>Speed golf (also known as extreme golf, fast golf&quot;, &quot;fitness golf and hit and run golf) is a variant of golf which scores both on strokes played and the time taken to complete the round.

==Rules==
One stroke is scored equally to one minute, so that shooting 90 on a golf course in 59 minutes and 30 seconds would result in an overall speed golf score of 149:30.

Rules and etiquette are generally the same for speed golf and regular golf with minor exceptions.
* In the interest of time, a golfer is allowed to putt with the flagstick left in the hole. Note: As of January 1, 2019, a golfer is allowed to putt with the flagstick left in the hole in regular golf, also.
* Unless otherwise told by a tournament committee, speed golfers are expected to rake bunkers, fix ball marks and conform to normal golf course dress code, although most speed golfers will wear running shoes instead of golf shoes.
* In the case of a lost ball or one that is hit out of bounds, players are permitted to play it like a lateral hazard because it was thought to be too severe of a penalty to have to also be penalized the additional time to run back to where the original shot was played.

Aside from the normal 14-club maximum, there is no rule about how many clubs a player is allowed to bring. However, players typically carry 4–7 clubs.

The sport was believed to have been started in 1979 in California when former American record holder in the mile (3:47.69 in 1982) Steve Scott ran around a golf course in 29 minutes and 33 seconds shooting a 95 with only a 3-iron.

After hearing about Scott, former ironman triathlete and teaching pro Jay Larson became the person who many considered the top speed golfer of the 1990s. Larson once shot a 75 in 39 minutes and 9 seconds on a 6,500 course with a slope rating of 125 (using the old rules of speed golf where the player could have a caddy in a cart riding out in front of them carrying their clubs and calling out distances as they approached the ball).

Towards the end of the 1990s, in an effort to help promote the sport, Oregonians and speed golfers Tim Scott (a former teaching pro turned school teacher), Christopher Smith, and Jim Kosciolek (a Chicago-based lawyer) founded a company called Speed Golf International.

The sport is now played in North America, Europe and Japan, and major tournaments are telecast by channels such as ESPN, CBS, and The Golf Channel.

==Tournaments==
The oldest known speed golf tournament is the Bob-n-Broc&#x27;, which has been held each September in Minneapolis since 1998.

Throughout the 2000s, there were various competitions held throughout the United States, many of which were held at Bandon Dunes in Bandon, Oregon.

==Guinness world record==
The lowest score in competition was shot by Mitch Williamson of Orange in New South Wales shot a score of 77 in 31 minutes, giving him a Speedgolf score of 108 at the Yarra Bend Golf Club in Melbourne hosted the Australian Speedgolf Open on 29 August 2016. This was not an official Guinness World record because Guinness was not onsite to validate it as a world record.

The official Guinness record was shot by professional Christopher Smith at the Chicago Speedgolf Classic at Jackson Park Golf Course on October 16, 2005. Smith shot 65 in just 44:06 while carrying six clubs for a speed golf score of 109:06.

==Related sports==
Speed golf is sometimes contrasted with Cross-country BigBall, in which players use soccer balls and baseball bats to reach a goal. Because the course and goals are chosen by the participants, Cross-country BigBall etiquette varies depending on whether the theater is a wooded or residential area. Both sports require substantial physical stamina.

Speed disc golf is similar in concept and rules to speed golf.

The biathlon (skiing and shooting a rifle) is also sometimes compared to speed golf.

<text>The Croatian Football Federation (, HNS) is the national governing body of football in Croatia. It was originally formed in 1912 and is based in the capital city of Zagreb. The organisation is a member of both FIFA and UEFA, and is responsible for overseeing all aspects of the game of football in Croatia. Marijan Kustić has served as president of the federation since 2021.

The HNS sanctions all competitive football matches in Croatia, beginning with the HNL down to 3. NL, as well as the Croatian Cup, while low-tiered leagues are sanctioned by inter-county and county associations. It is also responsible for appointing the management of the men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and youth national football teams. As of 2009, the HNS had 118,316 registered players (650 of them professionals) and a total of 1,732 registered association football and futsal clubs.

==History==

===Early years (1912–1945)===
The organisation traces its roots to the Croatian Sports Federation (&quot;Hrvatski športski savez&quot;), which was founded on 8 October 1909 in Zagreb, at the time when Croatia was part of Austria-Hungary. The federation organised all sports in the country and its first president was Hinko Würth, the chairman of HAŠK football club. Present-day HNS considers its foundation date to be 13 June 1912, when the football section of the Croatian Sports Federation was established, with Milovan Zoričić as its first president.

After World War I and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, representatives from Građanski, HAŠK, Hajduk Split and Concordia football clubs met in Zagreb on 14 April 1919 and founded the Football Association of Yugoslavia (&quot;Jugoslavenski nogometni savez&quot;), as a successor of the Croatian Sports Federation&#x27;s football section, and appointed Hinko Würth as its president. The organization then became the chief governing body of football in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and launched the Yugoslav First League, the first country-wide national competition held initially in a cup format. Five other regional sub-federations were also created (based in Belgrade, Ljubljana, Sarajevo, Split and Subotica), each organizing their own regional tournament with winners qualifying for the national championship.

In 1929, following disagreements between the Zagreb and Belgrade sub-federations, the Football Association of Yugoslavia was dissolved. It was then re-established in May 1930 in Belgrade, this time with the Serbian-language name &quot;Fudbalski savez Jugoslavije&quot;. The Belgrade-based association then continued organizing the national league until 1939, when the Banovina of Croatia was created as an administrative region within Kingdom of Yugoslavia. On 6 August 1939 the Croatian Football Federation (&quot;Hrvatski nogometni savez&quot; or HNS) was established as a football governing body in the newly created province, and Croatian and Slovenian clubs soon began leaving the Yugoslav League to join the HNS-run Croatian-Slovenian Football League in protest of the alleged centralization of sports around Belgrade. The split was eventually rectified with the promise of an increase in the number of Croatian and Slovenian clubs in the league, and because of this a shortened ten-round league was played in the 1939–40 Yugoslav First League season. In 1940 HNS also played a part in organizing the first ever Croatia national football team matches which played four international friendlies between April and December 1940. However the federation was not yet recognized by FIFA as Croatia was at the time still a province of Yugoslavia.

In April 1941 Kingdom of Yugoslavia was invaded by Axis Powers and was effectively dissolved. However, the Croatian Football Federation continued to run a competition called the Croatian national football league in the territory of Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a fascist puppet state which enjoyed relative peace during World War II, and which included most of present-day countries of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 17 July 1941 HNS was admitted to FIFA as the top level federation of NDH, and the national team representing NDH played fourteen international matches in the period from 1941 to 1944.

===HNS in Yugoslavia (1945–1990)===

Following the end of World War II, Croatia became a part of SFR Yugoslavia and the Belgrade-based Football Association of Yugoslavia took over as the main football-governing body in the country. Also, the new communist government issued a decree in 1945 which effectively dissolved all football clubs which were active during the war as a form of punishment for their participation in the fascist-run football championship. Among others, Zagreb-based powerhouses Concordia, HAŠK and Građanski all ceased to exist, their property was nationalised, and several other clubs, most notably Dinamo Zagreb, were formed to take their place. On the other hand, Hajduk Split was spared as their players had escaped from their Italian-occupied home city of Split during World War II and joined Yugoslav Partisans in 1944. For this reason, Hajduk Split is the only major Croatian club which can claim continuity since its foundation in 1911.

In the period from 1945 to 1990 the Belgrade-based Yugoslav Football Federation was in charge of football in the entire country, while Zagreb was turned into its major regional hub and administrative branch. In this period Croatian clubs competed within the Yugoslav league system and Croatian players were eligible for the Yugoslavia national football team. In the following decades Dinamo Zagreb and Hajduk Split became two of the Yugoslav Big Four (along with Belgrade-based Partizan and Red Star), a quartet of clubs which significantly dominated football in communist Yugoslavia. Dinamo and Hajduk won a combined total of 11 Yugoslav First League titles and 16 Yugoslav Cup. In addition, Croatian club Rijeka won 2 Yugoslav Cup titles. Dinamo Zagreb also won the 1966–67 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, which made them the first Yugoslav side to win a continental competition, and were the only Yugoslav club with European silverware until Red Star&#x27;s 1990–91 European Cup win 24 years later.

===Modern era (1990–present)===
When the breakup of Yugoslavia began to unfold in the early 1990s, the political situation was reflected on football pitches. On 13 May 1990 an infamous riot occurred at Maksimir in Zagreb and interrupted the Dinamo Zagreb – Red Star league fixture. On 3 June 1990 the pre-scheduled Yugoslavia–Netherlands friendly was held at the same stadium, and some 20,000 Croatian fans booed the Yugoslav national anthem and cheered for the Dutch team instead. On 26 September 1990 Hajduk Split fans staged a violent pitch invasion at Poljud during a league fixture against Partizan. On 17 October 1990 the first match of the newly established Croatia national football team was held, a friendly against the United States, and following the end of the 1990–91 season Croatian clubs decided to abandon Yugoslav competitions.

After Croatia had officially declared independence on 8 October 1991, the Croatian Football Federation sought international recognition, and was finally re-admitted to FIFA on 3 July 1992 and to UEFA on 17 June 1993.

In February 1992 the inaugural season of the Croatian top league Prva HNL kicked off, and in March 1992 the first edition of the Croatian Cup was launched.

In late 2010, the Federation held an election for its President, with Vlatko Marković opposed by Igor Štimac. Marković won by a single vote, and the assembly was marred with controversies. Štimac later appealed, calling for another meeting of the Federation. His supporters organized a new assembly and elected him the new President despite the opposing faction&#x27;s boycott, leading to an impasse.

In July 2012, the Federation held an election for its President, with Davor Šuker as the only candidate. All 46 delegates voted in favour of Suker&#x27;s candidature.

==Presidents==
;Notes
* The first three presidents 1912–1919 were heads of football sections within the Croatian Sports Federation, the top sports governing body in Croatia, which was at the time a province within Austria-Hungary. Following World War I and the formation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia the organisation was re-established in Zagreb in 1919 as the Football Association of Yugoslavia and designed as a national-level governing body. Its seat was moved to Yugoslavia&#x27;s capital Belgrade ten years later in 1929. Although city-level subfederations continued to exist in the 1920s and 1930s there was no separate regional organisation which would govern the sport in Croatia between 1919 and 1939, hence the 20-year gap. 
* In 1939 the Banovina of Croatia was created as an autonomous province within Yugoslavia, and a new provincial federation carrying the present-day football federation&#x27;s name was established. Ivo Kraljević headed this body between 1939 and 1941. 
* Following the April 1941 invasion of Yugoslavia the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), an Axis-allied puppet state which included most of the territories of present-day Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, was established. The Zagreb-based football federation thus began to govern football in the entire territory of NDH and continued to organize national-level league championship during World War II. During this period NDH was admitted to FIFA and organised 14 international friendlies involving Croatia. Presidents between 1941 and 1945 headed the HNS during this era.
* After 1945 and the establishment of the communist SFR Yugoslavia, the HNS again became one of its regional federations, charged with governing football in SR Croatia, which became one of Yugoslavia&#x27;s six federal republics. Presidents from 1945–1990 headed the HNS in this period.
* After Croatia proclaimed independence in 1991 and the breakup of Yugoslavia the HNS became the top football governing body of the newly independent nations. The country was internationally recognized by early 1992, and HNS was admitted to FIFA (again) in July 1992 and to UEFA in June 1993.

<text>Agudat Yisrael (; Ashkenazi Hebrew: &quot;Agudas Yisroel&quot;) is a Haredi Jewish political party in Israel. It began as a political party representing Haredi Jews in Poland, originating in the Agudath Israel movement in Upper Silesia. It later became the party of many Haredim in Israel. It was the umbrella party for many, though not all, Haredi Jews in Israel until the 1980s, as it had been during the British Mandate of Palestine.

Since the 1980s it has become a predominantly Hasidic party, though it often combines with the Degel HaTorah non-Hasidic Ashkenazi Haredi party for elections and coalition-forming (although not with the Sephardi and Mizrahi Haredi party Shas). When so combined, they are known together as United Torah Judaism.

==History==

When political Zionism began to emerge in the 1890s, and recruit supporters in Europe and America, it was opposed by many Orthodox Jews, who believed the Jewish state would emerge from divine intervention. World Agudath Israel was founded in Kattowitz, German Empire (now Katowice, Poland), in 1912, to provide an umbrella organization for observant Jews who opposed the Zionist movement.

In Palestine, Agudat Yisrael was established as a branch of this movement, to provide opposition to the organised Zionist Jewish community (the &quot;New Yishuv&quot;, as opposed to the traditionalist, religious &quot;Old Yishuv&quot;). One of its most authoritative spokesmen against the formation of a Jewish State, the Dutch poet Jacob Israël de Haan, was assassinated by the Haganah in 1924. In 1933, it entered into an agreement with the Jewish Agency in Palestine, according to which Agudat Yisrael would receive 6.5% of the immigration permits. It was led at the time by Rabbi Moshe Blau (brother of the head of Neturei Karta Rav Amram). In the wake of the Holocaust, anti-Zionist rabbis who led Agudat Israel recognised the great utility of a Jewish state, and it became non-Zionist, rather than anti-Zionist. It did not actively participate in the creation of Israel, but it ceased its opposition to it. Eventually, on the eve of the Israeli Declaration of Independence (1948), Agudat Yisrael yielded to pressure from the Zionist movement, and since that time, it has been a participant in most Israeli governments. Over time, the movement realized that its more active participation in politics would come with benefits, and it agreed to become a coalition partner of several Israeli governments. However, its original reservations about a secular government influenced its decision to refuse cabinet positions.

Agudat Yisrael originally had a mixed Hasidic and &quot;Litvish&quot; (Lithuanian-style Haredi) membership. However, in the 1980s, Rabbi Elazar Shach, leader of Israel&#x27;s Litvish community and their pre-eminent rosh yeshiva (&quot;yeshiva dean&quot;), split from the party. He created the new Degel HaTorah (&quot;Flag of the Torah&quot;) party. Most of the Litvish community left Agudah to join Degel HaTorah, leaving Agudah with primarily Hasidic members. Rabbi Shach had earlier assisted Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef in splitting from Agudah to create a Sephardic Haredi party known as Shas. Agudat Yisrael and Degel HaTorah have not always agreed with each other about policy matters; however, over the years, the two parties have co-operated and united as a voting bloc to win the maximum number of seats in the Knesset, since many extra votes can be wasted if certain thresholds are not attained under Israel&#x27;s proportional representation parliamentary system. The two parties chose to function and be listed under the name of United Torah Judaism (UTJ, Hebrew &quot;Yahadut HaTorah&quot;).

When both parties joined the government coalition of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in 2004, the UTJ union was broken due to rivalries. For the 2006 Israel legislative election, Agudat Yisrael and Degel HaTorah once again put their differences aside, and officially revived their United Torah Judaism alliance to win the maximum number of seats in the 17th Knesset.

Though Agudat Yisrael has never elected more than ten members in the Knesset, it has often played crucial roles in the formation of Israel&#x27;s coalition governments because Israel&#x27;s system of proportional representation allows small parties to wield the balance of power between the larger parties. This political leverage has been used to obtain funding for yeshivas and community institutions, to obtain a de facto exemption for Haredi Yeshiva students from military service, and to pass legislation regarding the observance of the Shabbat and kashrut dietary regulations, sometimes to the consternation of secular Israelis.

==Religious and political leadership==

Political power is vested in the Hasidic Rebbes of Ger, Belz, Vizhnitz, and Boston.

In addition, policy decisions of Agudat Yisrael are ratified by its Council of Torah Sages, which includes several other prominent Hasidic leaders and scholars, many being the leading rabbis from the main constituent groups. When participating in government coalitions, the party generally refrains from accepting actual cabinet posts. Its positions on Israeli foreign policy and the Palestinian question have been flexible in the past, since the party formally rejects political secular Zionism and does not view such issues ideologically. Therefore, it has been able to participate in both Likud- and Labor-led coalitions. In more recent years, it has become more sympathetic to the settler movement in the West Bank, and thus more security-conscious on military issues affecting Israel&#x27;s survival. Agudat Yisrael supported Ariel Sharon&#x27;s unilateral disengagement plan of 2005.

In 1948, Rabbi Yehuda Meir Abramowicz was appointed as General Secretary.

Rabbi Meir Porush, as well as Yaakov Litzman, and Yisrael Eichler, from the Hasidic courts of Ger and Belz, respectively, have represented the party in Israel&#x27;s Knesset. Another long-time Agudat MK is Rabbi Shmuel Halpert, a member of the court of Vizhnitz.

<doc id="1268163" wikidata="Q633565" url="?curid=1268163" title="Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica">
<text>Saint Mary is a parish located in the northeast section of Jamaica. With a population of 114,227 it is one of Jamaica&#x27;s smallest parishes, located in the county of Middlesex. Its chief town and capital is Port Maria, located on the coast. 

The parish is the birthplace of established dancehall reggae artists, including Capleton, Lady Saw, Ninjaman, Ini Kamoze, Sizzla, and Tanya Stephens. Other notable residents of St. Mary parish include author Colin Simpson, who is the great-great grandson of abolitionist James Phillippo, Jamaican writer and community activist Erna Brodber, and music producer Chris Blackwell, who is credited with discovering reggae icon Bob Marley.

==History==
There are a few traces of Taíno/Arawak presence in the parish. Saint Mary was also one of the first sections of the island to be occupied by the Spaniards. Puerto Santa Maria was the second town the Spaniards built on the island. In 1655, after the English captured Jamaica from the Spanish, the north coastal town of Santa Maria became known as Port Maria.

One of St. Mary’s most famous early residents was Sir Henry Morgan, who had a home on the hill overlooking Port Maria. The property offered a commanding view of the St. Mary harbour and provided Morgan with a strategic vantage point and featured a secret escape tunnel to Port Maria. Morgan’s home was later purchased by Sir Noël Coward and is located beside Fort Haldane.

Fort Haldane was built in 1759 to protect the strategic harbour of Port Maria from Spanish raids. It was also used as a garrison to keep the enslaved and working classes of St. Mary under control. It was named after General George Haldane, then Governor of Jamaica. The fort’s cannons were strategically positioned on a hill facing seaward over Port Maria for protection. Fort Haldane served a pivotal role in the famous Tacky&#x27;s rebellion, one of Jamaica&#x27;s bloodiest rebellions against slavery in 1760. On Easter Sunday, a runaway slave known as Tacky and a small group of slaves from neighboring plantations murdered their masters and marched to Port Maria where they killed the guards at Fort Haldane and stole several barrels of gunpowder and firearms. They fought alongside hundreds of other slaves for five months but their rebellion was ultimately quashed by the British colonial authorities and the skilled Jamaican Maroons from Scott&#x27;s Hall. A Maroon officer from Scott&#x27;s Hall, Davy the Maroon, shot Tacky dead following a fierce gunbattle.

Descendants of the Maroons carried on their struggle after the abolition of slavery and they joined with Reverend James Phillippo in his quest to establish one of his Free Villages in St. Mary. Phillippo built the first church in Oracabessa and led a defiant protest against the local landowner’s refusal to sell land to former slaves. The Maroons joined Phillippo in a show of force that led to the landowner’s capitulation and the sale of enough land to build homes for the local population. St. Mary&#x27;s present size was determined in 1867, when the parish of Metcalfe was merged with St Mary.

One of the largest landowners in Saint Mary at the turn of the 20th Century was Blanche Blackwell, mother of Chris Blackwell. Blanche sold plots of land from Oracabessa to Port Maria to her coterie of friends, including playwright Noël Coward, U.S. Ambassador Ruth Bryan Owen, and James Bond author Ian Fleming. Noël Coward&#x27;s Firefly Estate is designated as a National Historic site, and overlooks St. Mary Harbour.

The first James Bond film, &quot;Dr. No&quot; was filmed in part in Saint Mary Parish, including in the Oracabessa river.

In the 1990s, the Island Outpost Corporation developed one of St. Mary&#x27;s best-known tourist attractions, the James Bond Beach and the facility includes a concert pavilion as well as a large bar/restaurant.

St. Mary is home to the Oracabessa Bay Fish Sanctuary, which was established in 2011 to protect the marine ecosystem in Oracabessa Bay. The eastern perimeter of the Oracabessa Bay Fish Sanctuary is located on the edge of the Cayman Trough with walls that begin at 60 ft. and drop down to over 150 ft. These walls are covered in a large variety of hard and soft corals. The walls contain many overhangs and ledges and are home to lobsters, king crab, green and spotted moray eels, and a host of other marine creatures. Beyond the boundaries of the Oracabessa Bay Fish Sanctuary, the Cayman Trough plunges to depths of over 25,000 ft and is renowned for deep-water sport fishing including marlin and tuna.

==Geography==

St. Mary is located at latitude 18°09&#x27;N, longitude 77°03&#x27;W. It is bordered by Portland in the east, St. Ann in the west, and parts of St. Catherine and St. Andrew in the south.

The parish covers an area of 610 km2, making it Jamaica&#x27;s fifth smallest parish. The terrain is mountainous, rising up to almost at the highest point, but there are no distinctive mountain ranges. The climate is varied, like most parishes on the island. The eastern section of the parish has shale rock and an intricate surface draining pattern, while the western section is limestone with predominantly underground rivers.

There are three main rivers in Saint Mary, the Rio Nuevo, Wag Water River and White River.

==Commerce==
The parish has a good variety of agricultural resources. The principal products are bananas, sugar, citrus, pimento, cocoa, coconuts, coffee, vegetables, breadfruit and annatto. Pastoralism is also practised. In recent years, however, agriculture has been on the decline, which may be due to the problems that Jamaican banana export has been facing.

St. Mary&#x27;s parish, had once been listed as one of the poorest in Jamaica, but over the past 10 years there have been substantial improvements in the economy due to the influx of investments in infrastructure, including a new international airport (Ian Fleming International Airport), a new highway, and development of luxury resorts such as Goldeneye and Golden Clouds. The new intercoastal highway constructed in 2005 has benefitted the parish and has brought a significant increase to tourism-related activities.

The parish boasts what is thought by some to be one of the best secondary level schools in the nation, St Mary High School, from which several outstanding people have come. They occupy several reputable positions in varying sectors both at home and overseas.

Essential services includes banking and postal services. There are hospitals located in Port Maria and Annotto Bay, as well as public health clinics in Highgate, Oracabessa and Boscobel.

==Tourism==

Tourism has become an increasingly important source of income for parishioners of St. Mary. Some of the most well known resorts in St. Mary include Couples Sans Souci, Couples Tower Isle, Beaches Boscobel, Goldeneye and Golden Clouds. Ian Fleming International Airport provides private jet service for these luxurious properties as well as emergency airlift and general passenger service. Two of the most popular beaches in St. Mary are James Bond Beach and Reggae Beach.

<text>Yudhishthira (Sanskrit: युधिष्ठिर, , IAST: &quot;Yudhiṣṭhira&quot;) also known as Dharmaraja, was the king of Indraprastha and later the King of Kuru Kingdom in the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. He is the eldest among the five Pandavas, and is also one of the central characters of the epic.

Yudhishthira was the son of Kunti, the first wife of King Pandu, fathered by the god Yama due to Pandu&#x27;s inability to have children. Yudhishthira held a belief in &quot;dharma&quot; (morals and virtues) and was chosen to be the crown prince of Kuru. But after the Lakshagriha incident, he was presumed to be dead and his cousin Duryodhana was appointed as the new heir. The kingdom was split in half due to a succession dispute between Yudhishthira and Duryodhana. Yudhishthira received the barren half, which he later transformed into the magnificent city of Indraprastha.

Yudhishthira and his brothers had a polyandrous marriage with Draupadi, the princess of Panchala, who became the empress of the Indraprastha. After Yudhishthira performed the Rajasuya Yagna, he was invited to play a game of dice by his jealous cousin, Duryodhana and his uncle, Shakuni. Shakuni, a master at the game, represented Duryodhana against Yudhishthira and manipulated him into gambling his kingdom, wealth, the freedom of his brothers, Draupadi, and even himself. After the game, the Pandavas and Draupadi were sent into exile for thirteen years, with the last year requiring them to go incognito. During his exile, Yudhisthira was tested by his divine father Yama. For the last year of the exile known as Agyaata Vaasa, Yudhishthira disguised himself as Kanka and served the King of Matsya Kingdom.

Yudhishthira was the leader of the successful Pandava faction in the Kurukshetra War and defeated many venerable warriors such as Shalya. He then ruled the Kuru Kingdom for 36 years until announcing his retirement. At the end of the epic, he was the only one among his brothers to ascend to heaven while retaining his mortal body.

==Etymology and historicity==

The word &quot;Yudhiṣṭhira&quot; is an &quot;aluk&quot; compound (meaning it preserves the case ending of its first part). It means &quot;one who is steady in battle&quot;. It is composed of the words, &quot;yudhi&quot; (masculine locative singular) meaning &quot;in battle&quot;—from &quot;yudh&quot; (युध्) meaning &#x27;battle, fighting&#x27;—and &quot;sthira&quot; (स्थिर) meaning &#x27;steady&#x27;. His other names are:

* Bharata-vanshī (भरतवंशी) – descendant of Bharata
* Ajātashatru (अजातशत्रु) – one who is born without enemies
* Dharmanandana (धर्मनन्दन) or Dharmaputra (धर्मपुत्र) – The son of Dharma (Righteousness) or Yama Dharma Raja
* Dharmarāja (धर्मराज) or Dharmarāya or Dharmaja – Lord of Dharma.
* Pānduputra (पांडुपुत्र) – Son of Pandu.
* Pāndavāgrajah (पाण्डवाग्रजः) – Eldest of Pandavas.
* Jyeshthakaunteya (ज्येष्ठकौन्तेय) – Eldest son of Kunti.
* Sārvabhauma (सार्वभौम) / Samrāt Chakravarti (सम्राट् चक्रवर्ती) – Emperor of the complete planet Earth.
* Kanka (कङ्क) – another name for Yudhisthira given by Draupadi for the 13th year in exile.

According to Buddhist sources, by the late and post-Vedic periods, Kuru had become a minor state ruled by a chieftain called Koravya and belonging to the () .

==Birth and upbringing==
Once a Brahmin rishi, Kindama and his wife were enjoying nature in the forest when Yudhishthira&#x27;s father Pandu accidentally shot at them, mistaking them for deer. Before dying, Kindama cursed the king to die when he engages in intercourse with any woman. Due to this curse, Pandu was unable to become a father. As an additional penance for the murder, Pandu abdicated the throne of Hastinapura, and his blind brother Dhritarashtra took over the reins of the kingdom.

After knowing the curse of Pandu, Kunti told him that he could be the father of the child and told her boon of sage Durvasa. Then Pandu requested Kunti to apply her boon and suggested to call Dharma to get a truthful, knowledgeable and justice knowing son who can rule Hastinapur. On the full moon of May (Sanskrit: Jyeshth masa) first and the eldest of the Pandavas, Yudhishthira was born. Yudhishthira&#x27;s four younger brothers were Bhima (born by invoking Vayu); Arjuna (born by invoking Indra); and the twins Nakula and Sahadeva (born by invoking Aśvins). 

Yudhishthira was trained in religion, science, administration and military arts by the Kuru preceptors, Kripa and Drona. Specifically, he became a master in using the javelin and war chariot. It is said that his javelin was so strong that it could penetrate a stone wall as though it were a piece of paper. His chariot always flew at a 4 finger distance above the ground due to his piety.

== Marriage and children ==
After Yudhishthira and his brothers completed their studies, they returned to Hastinapur. Duryodhana along with Shakuni planned to kill them and sent Yudhishthira, his siblings, and his mother to a palace made of wax called Lakshagriha.

One night, Shakuni&#x27;s man, Purochana, set it on fire. However, the princes and their mother survived. They were heartbroken and decided to hide from Hastinapura. Later, Arjuna attended Draupadi&#x27;s swayamvar and won her hand in marriage. But due to Kunti&#x27;s misunderstanding, Draupadi became the common wife of all the Pandavas. Later at Indraprastha, Draupadi bore Yudhishthira a son, Prativindhya and a daughter, Suthanu. Suthanu was later married to Asvabhanu, Krishna and Satyabhama&#x27;s eldest son. Although Yudhishthira had another wife named Devika, Draupadi was his chief consort as well as the empress.

Yudhishthira was married to Devika in a self-choice marriage ceremony, arranged by her father Govasena, who was the king of Sivi Kingdom. They had a son, Yaudheya. According to Puranas, Yaudheya was also the name of the son of Prativindhya. The Bhagavata Purana, as well as Vishnu Purana, also mention Pauravi as one of the wives of Yudhishthira. A son named Devaka was born to this couple.

==Ruling the Indraprastha==
===Division of Hastinapura===
When the Pandavas returned to Hastinapura after hiding, there was conflict between Yudhishthira and Duryodhana regarding as the crown prince of Hastinapura. Yudhishthira was originally made the crown prince of Hastinapura, but after the event of Lakshagriha, people thought that he was dead, and Duryodhana was made the new crown prince of Hastinapura. On Bhishma&#x27;s advice, Dhritarashtra gave half of the kingdom to Pandavas to rule. However the land was under the control of Takshaka. Pandavas defeated Takshaka and with the help of Mayasura, they built a magnificent city named Indraprastha.

===Rajasuya yajna===
Some years after his coronation at Indraprastha, Yudhishthira set out to perform the Rajasuya yagna. Arjuna, Bhima, Nakula, and Sahadeva led armies across the four corners of the world to obtain tributes from all kingdoms for Yudhishthira&#x27;s sacrifice. The non-compliant Magadha king, Jarasandha was defeated by Bhima and Krishna. At his sacrifice, Yudhishthira chose Krishna as his honored guest. At the yajna, many kings were present there, including Duryodhana and Shishupala. Shishupala was beheaded by Krishna for his evil deeds. An annoyed and jealous Duryodhana returned to Hastinapura.

==The game of dice==

Yudhishthira was challenged to play a game of dice in Hastinapura by his cousin, Duryodhana. Duryodhana invited him because he was jealous of Yudhishthira&#x27;s wealth and power that he witnessed at the Rajasuya. Shakuni used the dice made from the bones of his father, which always ensured that he got the number he wanted and Yudhisthira was allowed to bet whatever he had he was proud of and had right over. After losing his brothers and his empire, he bet himself and also his wife which lead to the Vastraharan. Later, he lost his kingdom in the game again and was forced into exile for 13 years, which included one year in anonymity.

== Exile ==
===Obtaining the Akshaya Patra===

Some time after going to the forests, Yudhishthira became troubled upon realising that he was unable to feed the Brahmanas who followed him to the forests. On the advice of his priest, Sage Dhaumya, Yudhishthira stood in river and appeased Surya, the Sun god, by reciting his 108 names. The god gifted a copper plate, the Akshaya Patra, to Yudhishthira, saying that any food cooked in that vessel would be inexhaustible, until Draupadi finished her daily meal. He also blessed Yudhishthira that the latter would regain his kingdom fourteen years later.

===Tale of Nala &amp; Damayanti===
Sage Vyasa imparts the Pratismriti to Yudhishthira and tells him to pass it down to Arjuna. On Vyasa&#x27;s advice, Yudhishthira permits Arjuna to perform penance in the Himalayas and obtain celestial weapons from the gods. During Arjuna&#x27;s absence, Sage Brihadashva consoles Yudhishthira by narrating the story of Nala and Damayanti. Brihadashva advises Yudhishthira not give in to misery despite the wretched conditions he lives in. At the end of the story, Yudhishthira received a mantra from the sage, which makes him a master of gambling.

===Yudhishthira &amp; Nahusha===

One day, while Bhima was roaming the forests, he was captured by a giant serpent, who suppressed the Pandava&#x27;s might with his gaze. Meanwhile, a worried Yudhishthira searched for Bhima and found him at the mercy of the snake. To Yudhishthira&#x27;s shock, the snake introduces itself to be the ancient King Nahusha, the father of Yayati, and the legendary ancestor of the Pandavas.

Nahusha posed questions on spirituality to Yudhishthira and was satisfied with his answers. In turn, he also clarified Yudhishthira&#x27;s doubts on some spiritual topics. Nahusha then narrated his story to Yudhishthira, on how he used to rule Svarga in the days of yore, how he became intoxicated with hubris, and how he turned into a snake due to the curse of the sages, Bhrigu and Agastya. Nahusha used his own story to warn Yudhishthira about the consequences of being arrogant.

Agastya and Bhrigu had prophesized that Yudhishthira would rescue Nahusha from his curse. After conversing with Yudhishthira, Nahusha regained his original form and returned to Svarga.

===Yudhishthira &amp; Sage Markandeya===

The ever-youthful sage, Markandeya, once visited Yudhishthira. He narrated many stories to Yudhishthira, including the characteristics of the Yugas, the story of King Shibi, and the story of Savitri and Satyavan. He also narrated the story of Rama to Yudhishthira, and discoursed on spiritual philosophy.

===Yaksha Prashna===

During their exile, the four other Pandavas happened upon a lake, which was haunted by a Yaksha. The Yaksha challenged the brothers to answer his moral questions before drinking the water; the four Pandavas laughed and drank the water anyway. As a result, they choked on the water and died. Yudhishthira went in last, answered many questions put forth to him by the Yaksha. After the Yaksha was satisfied with the answers, he offered Yudhishthira the choice to bring back one of his brother, and Yudhishthira chose Nakula. When the Yaksha questioned him on his reasoning, Yudhishthira replied that he is still alive as Kunti&#x27;s lineage, but there are no one alive as Madri&#x27;s lineage, so he chose Nakula. The Yaksha was impressed again, and revived all of the Pandavas siblings.

The Yaksha asked for any other wish as he was impressed and told him he could ask for wealth, strength, power, anything he wished. Yudhishthira said he already got the strength, wealth and power when all his four brothers were revived and said he could not ask for any other wish. Yudhishthira replied, &quot;It is enough that I have beheld thee with my senses, eternal God of gods as thou art! O father, whatever boon thou wilt confer on me I shall surely accept gladly! May I, O lord, always conquer covetousness and folly and anger, and may my mind be ever devoted to charity, truth, and ascetic austerities!&quot; 

This story is often cited as an example of Yudhishthira&#x27;s upright principles. The Yaksha later identified himself as Yudhishthira&#x27;s father, Dharma, and pointed them to the kingdom of Matsya to spend their last year of exile in anoymity.

=== Ajñātavāsa (Incognito) ===
Along with his brothers, Yudhishthira spent his last year of exile in the kingdom of Matsya. He disguised himself as a Brahmin named Kanka (among themselves Pandavas codenamed him Jaya) and advised the game of dice to the king.

Following the death of Kichaka by Bhima, Matsya was invaded by King Susharma of Trigarta, in retaliation to the raidings his kingdom had suffered by Kichaka, and in cooperation with Duryodhana of Hastinapur. When Susharma&#x27;s army closed the kingdom, Kanka volunteered to follow King Virata to face the invader, and took along his three brothers, Vallabha (Bhima), Granthika (Nakula), and Tantripala (Sahadeva), with him and while disguised. On the battlefield, the brothers proved valiance, defending King Virata before finally defeating King Susharma.

While Yudhishthira and King Virata were away battling Susharma, the city was marched upon by the host from Hastinapur. Prince Uttar and Brihannala (Arjuna), who were left in defense of the city, rallied to defend the kingdom, where Arjuna revealed his identity and fended off the invasion. When King Virata returned from his battle, the identities of all Pandavas were revealed, and Yudhishthira congratulated the marriage between Princess Uttarā and Abhimanyu, as Arjuna has suggested.

==Kurukshetra war==

When the period of exile was completed, Duryodhana refused to return Yudhishthira&#x27;s kingdom. Yudhishthira made numerous diplomatic efforts to retrieve his kingdom peacefully but in vain. Left with no other option, Yudhishthira wages war.

The flag of Yudhishthira&#x27;s chariot bore the image of a golden moon with planets around it. Two large and beautiful kettle-drums, called Nanda and Upananda, were tied to it. Before the war started, Yudhishthira stepped down from his chariot to take blessings from his grandsire Bhishma, teachers Drona and Kripa and uncle Shalya, who all were in his opposite side in the war showing his respect towards his elders. He also asked the willing Kauravas to join his side. On his request one of Dhritarashtra sons, Yuyutsu joined the war on the side of Pandavas.

Yudhishthira was described to be an excellent javelin-fighter and to have surpassed everyone as a car-warrior. Yudhishthira defeated many warriors in the war, like Duryodhana. Yudhishthira’s javelin originally belonged to Ishana which he would use to kill Shalya during the war. Yudhishthira also wielded a bow called Mahendra.

On the 14th day of the war, while Arjuna was busy searching for Jayadratha, Drona attempted to capture Yudhishthira but Arjuna would foil Drona&#x27;s plans. Yudhishthira and Drona engaged in a fierce duel where Yudhishthira was ultimately defeated by Drona. Yudhishthira would later assist his nephew Ghatotkacha in slaying the asura Alambusha. 

Yudhishthira would later defeat Duryodhana twice and the latter had to be rescued by Drona. Drona and Yudhishthira would engage in an archery duel which would end up as a stalemate. Yudhishthira would later be defeated by Kritavarma. 

On the 15th day, Yudhishthira was approached by Drona, in the latter&#x27; inquiry on the death of his son Ashwatthama whom he heard to have died at Bhima&#x27;s hand. Torn between his duty to cripple Drona and upholding his morals, Yudhishthira opted to half truth where he confirmed the death of Ashwatthama the elephant, but omitted the contextual part that it was an elephant and not his son. This was effective in the former purpose of crippling Drona, but also caused his own chariot to finally fall down to the ground, instead of slightly levitating as it had been before this incident. Yudhishthira was one of 5 individuals who witnessed Drona&#x27;s spirit leaving his body. 

On the 17th day, he injured Duryodhana badly and was about to kill him but decided to spare him on Bhima&#x27;s advice who reminded him of his vow to kill Duryodhana. Yudhishthira would be defeated by both Karna and Ashwatthama. 

Worried for Yudhishthira&#x27;s safety, Arjuna retreats from the battlefield to search for him, only to find him taking refuge in camp. Furious at Arjuna for not killing Karna yet, Yudhishthira insults him by suggesting Arjuna should hand over the Gandiva to another warrior if he does not think he is able to slay Karna. Arjuna, enraged from Yudhishthira&#x27;s insult, attempted to kill him with his sword but was stopped from doing so due to Krishna&#x27;s intervention. Filled with regret, Arjuna attempted to commit suicide but was dissuaded from doing so by Krishna. The brothers would reconcile their differences and embrace each other. 

On the last day of the war, Yudhishthira was highly energetic for the day, and engaged in a fierce duel against the Kauravas&#x27; final supreme commander, Shalya. With Bhima&#x27;s assistance, Yudhishthira managed to slay his uncle.

With the battlefield cleared of the Kauravas but no sight of Duryodhana, Yudhishthira received a report that his nemesis went into hiding in a nearby swamp. The Pandavas brothers and Krishna thus went to the swamp, and taunted Duryodhana off his refuge. Yudhishthira proposed a final challenge to Duryodhana, to a battle against any of the Pandavas under any weapon of Duryodhana&#x27;s desire. Yudhishthira also promised Duryodhana that should he win, he would reign as the next King of Hastinapura.

With Duryodhana choosing Bhima, the other Pandavas brothers, Krishna and Balarama witnessed the mace duel between the mace fighters. When Bhima finally defeated Duryodhana and started insulting his nemesis, Yudhishthira became sufficiently displeased with his brother&#x27;s disrespect and ordered Bhima off the battleground. Ultimately, Yudhishthira heard out Duryodhana&#x27;s final conversation and lamentation, before leaving the fallen Kauravas&#x27; overlord on his deathbed.

===Yudhishthira&#x27;s curse===

After he was made aware that Karna was his elder brother, Yudhishthira cursed all women with not being able to hide any secrets. Had Yudhishthira&#x27;s mother Kunti not kept that fact a secret, the war might have been averted, with millions spared.

==Reign after the war==
After getting victory in the war, Yudhishthira was crowned as the Emperor of Hastinapura and reigned for 36 years.

Fifty days after the war, Yudhishthira and the royal families visited Bhishma, who had been lying on the bed of arrows since his defeat. Bhishma bestowed the new king with &quot;Anushasana&quot;, teaching the new king in series of dharma and royal conducts, before the elder guardian surrendered his life by his own will. Yudhishthira then cremated the former protector of Hastinapur in a great ceremony.

Later, he performed the Ashvamedha on Krishna and Vyasa&#x27;s insistence. In this sacrifice, a horse was released to wander for a year, and Yudhishthira&#x27;s brother Arjuna led the Pandava army, following the horse. The kings of all the countries where the horse wandered were asked to submit to Yudhishthira&#x27;s rule or face war. All paid tribute, once again establishing Yudhishthira as the undisputed Emperor of Bharatavarsha.

During his reign, Yudhisthira duly consulted with and reported to Dhritarashtra on governances. After 15 years, the former king, his consort Gandhari, Queen Mother Kunti, and Prime Minister Vidura decided to retire to the forest, where they pass away years later. These events greatly saddened Yudhishthira and the Pandavas brothers.

==Retirement and ascent to heaven==

Upon the onset of the &quot;Kali Yuga&quot; and the departure of Krishna, Yudhishthira and his brothers retired, leaving the throne to their only descendant to survive the war of Kurukshetra, Arjuna&#x27;s grandson, Parikshit. Giving up all their belongings and ties, the Pandavas, accompanied by a dog, made their final journey of pilgrimage to the Himalayas. During their pilgrimage, each one starting with Draupadi, fell down dead upon the mountains. Yudhishthira cites Draupadi&#x27;s partiality for Arjuna, Sahadeva&#x27;s pride in his wisdom, Nakula&#x27;s vanity in his beauty, Arjuna&#x27;s boastfulness of his archery, and Bhima&#x27;s negligence of the needs of others while eating as the reasons for their fall. Finally, it was Yudhishthira who was able to reach the top, with the dog accompanying him.
On reaching the top, Indra congratulates him and promises Yudhishthira immortality and godhood upon his ascent to Heaven. However, Indra asks him to abandon the dog before entering Heaven. But Yudhishthira refused to do so, citing the dog&#x27;s unflinching devotion as a reason. Indra retorts that he has abandoned his brothers and wife to reach the top of the Himalayas, but Yudhishthira said he could not prevent their deaths, but to abandon a poor creature was a great sin. It turns out that the dog was his father Yama in disguise. Yama congratulates his son and commends him on his unwavering principles. Yudhishthira proceeds to Heaven upon a celestial vehicle with Narada as his guide, who informs him that he is the first mortal to enter Heaven in a physical form.

Upon his arrival, Yudhishthira finds Duryodhana and his Kaurava cousins in heaven but not his brothers and Draupadi. Furious, Yudhishthira demands that Narada take him to where he might find his family. Narada brings Yudhishthira to Hell where he encounters Karna, his brothers, Draupadi, Dhrishtadyumna, and the Upapandavas. Yudhishthira, enraged, decides that he would rather live in Hell with his family than in Heaven with his cousins. Indra then appears and lifts the illusion, informing Yudhishthira of his deception. Indra reveals that Yudhishthira has been shown a glimpse of Hell due to deceiving Drona with his white lie. Yama congratulates his son on passing his third and final test, the first being the Yaksha Prashna, and the second being his refusal to abandon the dog. Yudhishthira would then bathe in the Heavenly Ganga, casting off his mortal form and was reunited with his family in Svarga. 

==Assessment==
Yudhishthira was master in javelin-fighting and chariot racing, alongside being a skilled archer. Yudhishthira was a polyglot, knowing unusual languages. After being exiled by Duryodhana, Yudhishthira became adept at controlling the dice after learning a mantra from Sage Brihadashwa. He was a hero known for his honesty, justice, sagacity, tolerance, good behavior and discernment.

Yudhishthira could burn down anyone into ashes when he sees someone with his wrath and anger. That&#x27;s why he used to be calm and composed most of the time.
He closed his eyes and came out of the gambling hall even when he lost everything. Otherwise the entire Kuru court and all the one who were present would be burnt into ashes.

Dhritarashtra said to Sanjaya &quot;The son of Kunti and Pandu, Yudhishthira, is virtuous and brave and eschews deeds that bring on shame. Endued with great energy, he hath been wronged by Duryodhana. If he were not high-minded, they would in wrath burn the Dhritarashtras. I do not so much dread Arjuna or Bhima or Krishna or the twin brothers as I dread the wrath of the king, O Suta, when his wrath is excited. His austerities are great; he is devoted to &quot;Brahmacharya&quot; practices. His heart&#x27;s wishes will certainly be fulfilled. When I think of his wrath, O Sanjaya, and consider how just it is, I am filled with alarm.&quot;

<text>The Johnny Rockets Group Inc., commonly known simply as Johnny Rockets, is an American restaurant franchise whose themed decor is based upon 1950s diner-style restaurants. As of April 2024, the company operates 90 locations in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Washington, D.C., Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Washington. Décor includes Coca-Cola advertising, featuring nearly life-size cardboard illustrations of women in World War II armed services uniforms (Women Airforce Service Pilots), individual jukebox stations, chrome accents and red vinyl seats.

The menu, presentation, counter seating and grilling area are based on an original restaurant from 1947 (still operating today), The Apple Pan in West Los Angeles. Hamburgers are grilled-to-order in full view of the customers and are served wrapped in paper in metal baskets. One location in Hawaii is called &quot;Rock &#x27;n Fun&quot; and also has an arcade.

==History==

Johnny Rockets was founded on June 6, 1986, by Ronn Teitelbaum of Los Angeles, California, and &quot;crafted as a &#x27;nongimmicky&#x27; recreation of the 1940s-vintage malt shops of his childhood&quot;. The first restaurant was established as a 20-stool counter operation on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles. This location permanently closed on October 26, 2015. Teitelbaum died from brain cancer on September 11, 2000, at age 61.
In February 2007, it was announced that RedZone Capital, the private equity firm of Daniel Snyder, was set to acquire the chain. Snyder announced plans to expand the chain both within the United States and worldwide, including the launch of smaller outlets known as Johnny Rockets Express. Snyder recruited industry veteran Lee Sanders from Buffalo Wild Wings, formerly with Dunkin Brands, General Mills, and Pepsico, to serve as president and CEO, and board member. Sanders ran the business for almost four years.

A sit-down restaurant owned by Six Flags Great Escape (RedZone was the largest shareholder at the time), Trappers Adirondack Grill, was converted to a Johnny Rockets in June 2008. A few years later Six Flags New England would also get a Johnny Rocket&#x27;s near the Superman: Ride Of Steel.

==Controversy==
North Carolina&#x27;s Reverend Paul Scott labeled Flav&#x27;s performance &quot;a coon act on a modern-day minstrel show.&quot;

Flav&#x27;s friend and fellow Public Enemy member Chuck D accused VH1 of &quot;Flavsploitation&quot; in a journal entry regarding the March 27 episode, which showed a tense conflict between Flav, three of his children and their mother.

&quot;Peeps will let the Bridgette thing perhaps slide, but not the wild statements and what seems like a disrespect conflict on camera with his children and their mother. Last week, it was that same part of his family who went on Wendy Williams&#x27; program and launched the worst on-air diatribe ever directed at a father by his children.&quot;

Flav responded by saying,

&quot;I want &quot;Strange Love&quot; to be a mirror for them. I want them to see themselves, because they did disrespect me also. But that&#x27;s their mother. When children grow up without both parents, there&#x27;s an imbalance — and what you see on the show with my kids is an imbalance…But I love my kids.&quot;

<doc id="1268172" wikidata="Q7099635" url="?curid=1268172" title="Orange Grove affair">
<text>The Orange Grove affair was a political scandal in Australia concerning the dealings of the New South Wales state Australian Labor Party government with multinational corporation The Westfield Group. It resulted from a court decision in 2004 to force the closure of the Orange Grove shopping centre after a zoning dispute, with the loss of approximately 200 jobs. Westfield, which owned a nearby shopping centre, had challenged the legitimacy of the Orange Grove centre, which was operating on land not zoned for this purpose.

When the courts ruled in Westfield&#x27;s favour, Liverpool City Council sought State Government approval for a retrospective rezoning, to validate its earlier decision to approve the shopping centre. The State Government declined to intervene, despite a planning report suggesting that course of action, and the retail component of the Orange Grove centre was forced to close. The bulky goods component of the centre remained open, as the centre was legally zoned for bulky goods sales.

However, the State Opposition subsequently unearthed information about a meeting between Premier Bob Carr&#x27;s chief of staff and a prominent Westfield employee, sparking allegations that interference from Westfield had played a role in the government&#x27;s decision not to intervene. As a result, a parliamentary inquiry was commissioned, and the Independent Commission Against Corruption announced an investigation. The investigation concluded in 2005, with no findings of corruption against any person. However, the Commission recommended that the NSW Government strengthen guidelines for public servants dealing with corruption allegations by lobbyists.

==Background==

In March 2002, Frank Mosca, an architect working on behalf of Sydney businessman Nabil Gazal, applied to change an existing development consent for a property in a light industrial area on Orange Grove Road in the Sydney suburb of Warwick Farm, just north of central Liverpool to change the permitted use of the site from &quot;bulky goods/ warehousing&quot; to &quot;warehouse clearance outlet&quot;. This was intended to permit the building of an &quot;outlet mall&quot;, mainly consisting of retailing, although described as &quot;factory outlets&quot;, even though the area was zoned under its Local Environment Plan (LEP) for industrial uses, in which retailing was generally forbidden, except for a limited range of &quot;bulky goods&quot; or goods produced on the premises. The zoning was consistent with a long-standing policy of discouraging retailing away from established centres with good transport connections, currently embodied as a draft State Environmental Planning Policy: &quot;Integration of Land Use and Transport&quot; (SEPP 66). The Orange Grove site had poor bus connections only and none on Sundays.

In due course Council officers advised that a new development application was required, and this was submitted on 5 June. On 13 June the Council wrote to Mosca clearly stating what retailing activities could be carried out on the site according to the LEP. Mr Mosca submitted a Statement of Environmental Effects in July, which argued that &quot;warehouse clearance outlets&quot; were not specifically prohibited by the LEP, and therefore Council could consent to them. The development application was eventually advertised for public comment in November and no comments having been received it was decided that under council rules it could be approved at officer level, without reference to a Council committee. Immediately following the end of the comment period on 15 December, an officer of Liverpool City Council approved the development application, apparently satisfied that &quot;warehouse clearance outlets&quot; were not forbidden by the LEP. Prior to the approval, the Orange Centre commenced trading in November, with Craig Knowles, the local member and state Planning Minister, attending the official opening.

==Legal action==
On 17 June 2003, the Westfield Group, which operates a 3-level, similarly large shopping centre 1 kilometre southward of the Orange Grove site, within the Liverpool central business district, commenced legal action in the Land and Environment Court arguing that a retail outlet operating out of an industrial zone was contrary to the council&#x27;s LEP. On 8 December, the Liverpool City Council decided to amend the LEP to introduce a new definition for &quot;outlet centre&quot; and retrospectively rezone the Orange Centre site. On 16 January 2004, the court ruled in favour of Westfield and ordered the closure of the centre&#x27;s retail activities, with a deadline ultimately extended to 30 June. This verdict was subsequently upheld by the Court of Appeal on 31 March.

While the dispute had been ongoing, the Carr government had sacked the strife-torn Liverpool council, after a series of incidents of economic mismanagement, and on 16 March, it appointed Gabrielle Kibble, the daughter of former Governor-General John Kerr, as administrator. On 14 April, Kibble forwarded an application for a retrospective rezoning as an amendment to the Liverpool Local Environment Plan (LEP) to the Minister Assisting the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning (Planning Administration), Diane Beamer, as required by planning legislation.

==Consideration of retrospective amendment to LEP==
On 15 April 2004, Mark Ryan, Director of Corporate Affairs, Westfield, phoned Premier Carr&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Graeme Wedderburn and suggested that the original Liverpool Council planning decision for the centre had been approved corruptly. Next day Wedderburn discussed the allegation with Carr and with Minister Beamer&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Michael Meagher. He later phoned Beamer directly and told her to &quot;be wary of things that come out of Liverpool. There had been some allegations from Westfield.&quot; On 19 April, Ryan met Wedderburn and gave more details of his claims about Liverpool City Council, but conceded that he had no hard evidence. Wedderburn told Beamer, at a meeting on 20 April, &quot;You should be very careful, you should take great care not to be influenced, subject to any undue influence, not to be inappropriately lobbied in making this plan, in making decisions here&quot;, according to Meagher. Nevertheless, according to evidence subsequently presented at ICAC, Wedderburn made no suggestion as to what Beamer&#x27;s decision on the proposed variation to the LEP should be. During ICAC&#x27;s subsequent investigations, it focused on whether these corruption allegation affected Bealmer&#x27;s subsequent decision not to amend the LEP.

On 16 June, the Department of Infrastructure, Planning and Natural Resources, advised Beamer to approve Liverpool City Council&#x27;s proposed variation to its LEP that would have retrospectively validated the planning approval for the shopping centre. The Department&#x27;s head, Jennifer Westacott, contradicted this recommendation in a memorandum signed on 25 June. Beamer&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Michael Meagher, later told the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC),&quot;…what we had was something I’d never seen before. It was highly unusual, and it was, I suppose confusing in a way too.&quot;

As the date for the centre&#x27;s closure, set for mid-2004, drew closer, both sides increased the pressure. Westfield declared that an A$150 million redevelopment of its own centre was under threat if Orange Grove was allowed to continue operating, and suggested that Orange Grove could cause the loss of up to A$18 million a year from the local economy. After further discussions with Westacott and a further memorandum, Beamer declined to approve the proposed variation on the grounds that the shopping centre tended to undermine the viability of the Liverpool shopping centre, on 8 July 2004.

==Corruption allegations==
On 10 July 2004, Gazal, Orange Grove&#x27;s owner, signed a statutory declaration alleging that he had been told by Labor member Joe Tripodi on 22 May that the retrospective approval would be denied by Beamer. Furthermore, he alleged that Tripodi had told him that Carr had directly instructed Beamer to reject the proposal after having contact with Westfield. In addition, Samir Bargshoon, a contract cleaner and friend of Gazal, signed a statutory declaration alleging that he had heard, on the same day, Tripodi say that Beamer had told him that Carr had instructed her not to sign the rezoning of the Liverpool designer outlets. Gazal&#x27;s solicitor, Joseph D’Agostino, also signed a statutory declaration containing an allegation that Tripodi had indicated that the planning issue was being handled &quot;at a higher level then (sic) himself.&quot; Mosca, the shopping centre&#x27;s architect signed a statutory declaration alleging that Tripodi had said, in relation to the rezoning, &quot;Carr rang Beamer and asked her to screw it over&quot;.

Gazal&#x27;s allegations received substantial media attention, and led to both the state opposition and the Sydney tabloid The Daily Telegraph becoming involved. It subsequently emerged that the Department of Infrastructure, Planning and Natural Resources submission to Minister Beamer had supported the rezoning of the centre, due to the number of jobs that would be lost if it were to close. Then Opposition Leader, John Brogden, tabled a draft press release in parliament that would have announced Beamer&#x27;s decision to support Kibble&#x27;s proposal.

It also emerged that Mark Ryan, a senior Westfield lobbyist, had telephoned Graeme Wedderburn, the Premier&#x27;s chief of staff, on 15 April 2003, two days after Kibble had publicly supported the rezoning. Wedderburn had then met Ryan and Craig Marshall, another Westfield executive, on 19 April. Though Wedderburn strongly defended his actions, he also publicly admitted that Orange Grove had been the focus of these meetings. Premier Carr, Wedderburn and Beamer all faced questions from the media over alleged links between the two events.

==ICAC investigation==
ICAC investigated these matters, holding public hearings from December 2004 to 23 March 2005 and reporting in August. It found that the original decision by Liverpool Council on the planning application was not corrupt. It found that Ryan&#x27;s claims of corruption in the original decision were possibly &quot;mischievous&quot;, but not corrupt. It did not consider that there was anything corrupt in the behaviour of Premier Carr, Wedderburn or Meagher. It scrutinised Westacott&#x27;s advocacy but found no suggestion of impropriety. It concluded that Wedderburn&#x27;s expression of concern about possible corruption in relation to the original decision by Liverpool Council had no significant effect on Minister Beamer&#x27;s decision to reject the revised LEP, which could be justified on legitimate planning grounds.

In relation to Tripodi, ICAC suggested that Tripodi might have been &quot;content to be enlisted as the Gazcorp troubleshooter to perform a task which, in his opinion, was not difficult at all but which would raise his standing in the eyes of those who enlisted him&quot;, but when he lost confidence that Beamer would approve the proposed amendment of the LEP, he attempted on 22 May &quot;to distance himself from this unfortunate result by ascribing to higher powers or to those with influence beyond his control the true cause of the likely rejection of the LEP amendment&quot;.

ICAC found no evidence of corruption, but recommended that the NSW Government improve its guidelines on dealing with lobbyists. It also recommended that the Government adopt better protocols for ministers and their staff for dealing with allegations of corruption in relation to external parties. It noted that current guidelines were based on public service guidelines, and instructed ministerial staff to &quot;report unethical behaviour or suspected corrupt to senior management&quot;, without explaining who &quot;senior management&quot; were. Finally, it recommended that the Government finalise State Environmental Planning Policy 66 - Integration of Land Use and Transport.

<text>The Cyprus Football Association (CFA) () is the governing body of football in Cyprus and is based in Nicosia. It organises Cyprus&#x27;s football championships, whose top league is the Cypriot First Division. It also organises the Cypriot Cup, the Cypriot Super Cup and the Cypriot national football team. Cyprus Football Association is also responsible for organising futsal competitions, including the Cypriot Futsal league, the Cypriot Futsal Cup and the Cypriot Futsal Super Cup.

== History ==
Organised football was introduced to Cyprus early in the 20th century by the British. Initially played in the island&#x27;s schools, it proved hugely popular and a number of clubs were duly formed. As football became established, the clubs were united in agreeing that an official body was needed to regulate the sport. On 23 September 1934, the Cyprus Football Association was founded by the following eight clubs: AEL Limassol, Anorthosis Famagusta, APOEL, Aris Limassol, EPA Larnaca, Olympiakos Nicosia, Lefkoşa Türk Spor Kulübü and Trust. After Cyprus Football Association&#x27;s establishment, football began to be played on an official basis with the CFA organising various championships for its member clubs. 

Cyprus Football Association became a member of FIFA in 1948 and of UEFA in 1962.

In 2007, Cyprus Football Association moved to its new headquarters in Nicosia. The opening ceremony was attended by UEFA president Michel Platini, and the president of Cyprus, Tassos Papadopoulos.

<doc id="1268181" wikidata="Q1978476" url="?curid=1268181" title="Nakula">
<text>Nakula () was the fourth of the five Pandava brothers in the ancient Indian epic, the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. He and his twin brother Sahadeva were the sons of Madri, one of the wives of the Pandava patriarch Pandu, and Ashvini Kumaras, the divine twin physicians of the gods, whom she invoked to beget her sons due to Pandu&#x27;s inability to progenate. Nakula is described as the most handsome man of his lineage, and was renowned for his beauty, skill in swordsmanship and horse keeping.

He shared the common wife, Draupadi, with his four brothers. He was also married to Karenumati of Chedi Kingdom. He had two sons Shatanika and Niramitra from his two wives respectively. During the Rajasuya of his eldest brother Yudhishthira, he conquered the kings of the Sivis, the Rohitakas and other dynasties. After Yudhishthira lost all his possessions to his cousin Duryodhana in a dice game, the Pandavas and Draupadi were exiled for thirteen years. During the Pandavas&#x27; year of incognito exile, he disguised as a horse trainer named Granthika, and worked in the kingdom of Virata. Nakula was a skilled warrior who fought in the Kurukshetra War between the Pandavas and their cousins Kauravas. After the war, Yudhishthira appointed Nakula as the king of northern Madra. At the end of the epic, during the Pandavas&#x27; journey to the Himalayas to enter heaven, Nakula was the third to fall, following Draupadi and Sahadeva, due to his excessive pride in his beauty.

==Etymology and other names==
In Sanskrit, the word &quot;nakula&quot; means &quot;mongoose&quot; or &quot;mongoose-colored.&quot;

Nakula and his brother Sahadeva are both also referred to in the epic as Āśvineya, Aśvinīsuta and Aśvisuta because they are the sons of the Ashvins and as Mādravatīputra, Mādravatīsuta, Mādreya, Mādrinandana, Mādrinandanaka, Mādrīputra, Mādrīsuta, Mādrītanūja because they are the sons of Mādrī.

==Birth and early years==
Due to Pandu&#x27;s inability to bear children (because of the curse of Rishi Kindama), Kunti had to use the boon given by Sage Durvasa to give birth to her three children. She shared the boon with Pandu&#x27;s second wife, Madri, who invoked the Ashvini Kumaras to beget Nakula and Sahadeva, as twins. Madri committed self immolation, called Sati when her husband died and entrusted her children&#x27;s care to Kunti. Despite different divine paternal parentage these five children, first three of Kunti – Yudhisthira, Bhima and Arjuna- and latter two of Madri – Nakula and Sahadeva, were called Pandavas, or sons of Pandu. Nakula was known to be the most handsome person in the Kuru lineage.

In his childhood, Nakula mastered his skills in fencing and knife throwing under his father Pandu and a hermit named Suka at the Satasringa ashram. Later, Pandu lost his life when he attempted to make love with his wife, Madri. She committed suicide. Thus, Nakula along with his brothers moved to Hastinapura where he was brought up by Kunti. Kunti loved him as much as her own sons.

Nakula greatly improved his archery and swordplay skills under the tutelage of Drona. Nakula turned out to be an accomplished wielder of the sword. Along with the other Pandava brothers, Nakula was trained in religion, science, administration, and military arts by the Kuru preceptors Kripacharya and Dronacharya. He was particularly skilled at horse-riding.

==Skills==
* &quot;Horse-keeping&quot;: Nakula&#x27;s deep understanding of horse breeding and training is documented in the Mahabharata after the death of Narakasura by Krishna. In a conversation with Virata, Nakula claimed to know the art of treating all illnesses of horses. He was also a highly skilled charioteer.
* &quot;Ayurveda&quot;: Being a son of the physicians, Ashvini Kumaras, Nakula was also believed to be an expert in Ayurveda.
* &quot;Swordsman&quot;: Nakula was a brilliant swordsman and he showed his skills of a sword while killing the sons of Karna on the 18th day of Kurukshetra war.

==Marriage and Children==
When the Pandavas and their mother, Kunti were in hiding after the event of Lakshagriha, Arjuna won Draupadi&#x27;s hand in marriage. Nakula married her along with his brothers and had a son, Shatanika who was killed by Ashwatthama in the Kurukshetra War.

He also married Karenumati, the daughter of Shishupala, who bore him one son, Niramitra.

==Rajasuya conquests==

Nakula was sent west by Yudhisthira to subjugate kingdoms for the Rajasuya sacrifice, after crowning as the Emperor of Indraprastha. Nakula set forth to the kingdom once dominated by Vasudeva with a huge army. He first attacked the prosperous mountainous country of Rohitaka. He defeated the Mattamyurakas of the land in a fierce encounter. In another battle with the sage Akrosha, Nakula subjugated the regions of Sairishaka and Mahetta. He also defeated many tribes and small dynasties, including the Dasarnas, the Sivis, the Trigartas, the Amvashtas, the Malavas, the five tribes of the Karnatas, the Madhyamakeyas, the Vattadhanas and the Utsava-sanketas.

==Exile==
Yudhishthira&#x27;s loss in the game of dice meant that all Pandavas had to live in exile for 13 years. Once in exile, Jatasura, disguised as a Brahmin, kidnapped Nakula along with Draupadi, Sahadeva and Yudhishthira. Bhima rescued them eventually and in the fight that ensued, Nakula killed Kshemankara, Mahamaha, and Suratha. In the 13th year, Nakula disguised himself as an ostler and assumed the name of &quot;Granthika&quot; (between themselves, the Pandavas called him &quot;Jayasena&quot;) at the Kingdom of Virata. He worked as a horse-trainer who looked after horses in the royal stable.

==Role in the Kurukshetra War==
Nakula desired Drupada to be the general of the Pandava army, but Yudhishthira and Arjuna opted for Dhristadyumna.

As a warrior, Nakula slew prominent war-heroes on the enemy side. The flag of Nakula&#x27;s chariot bore the image of a red deer with a golden back. His conch, which was blown among others at the start of the war, was named Sughosha.

On the 1st day of the war, Nakula defeated Dussasana, sparing his life so that Bhima could fulfill his oath.

On the 11th day, Nakula defeated Shalya, destroying his chariot.

On the 13th day, his advance into Dronacharya&#x27;s formation was repulsed by Jayadratha.

On the night of the 14th day, he vanquished Shakuni.

On the 15th day, he was defeated by Duryodhana in a one-on-one duel.

On the 16th day, he was defeated and spared by Karna.
On the 18th day, he killed Karna&#x27;s sons Chitrasena, Satyasena and Sushena.

==Later life and death==
After the war, Yudhishthira appointed Nakula as the King of Northern Madra and Sahadeva as King of southern Madra.

Upon the onset of Kali Yuga and the departure of Krishna, the Pandavas retired. Giving up all their belongings and ties, the Pandavas and Draupadi, along with a dog, made their final journey of pilgrimage to the Himalayas.

Except Yudhishthira, all of the Pandavas grew weak and died before reaching heaven. Nakula was the third one to fall after Draupadi and Sahadeva. When Bhima asked Yudhishthira why Nakula fell, Yudhishthira replied that Nakula took pride in his beauty and believed that there was nobody equal to him in looks. Nakula is seen among the Ashvins, alongside Sahadeva, when Yudhisthira ascended to Svarga.

<doc id="1268183" wikidata="Q7235085" url="?curid=1268183" title="Potomac State College of West Virginia University">
<text>WVU Potomac State College is a public college in Keyser, West Virginia. It is part of the West Virginia University system. Potomac State College is located approximately 90 miles (140 km) east of West Virginia University&#x27;s campus in Morgantown, West Virginia. 

The college, with an enrollment of 1,193 in fall 2020, offers associate of arts, associate of applied science, and Bachelor of Applied Science degrees along with the Regents bachelor&#x27;s degree.  In 2018, Potomac State College began offering West Virginia University’s Bachelor of Science in Nursing program on the Keyser campus with the first cohort of students graduating in spring 2021.

In addition to academic buildings, the campus includes two residence halls, a conference center, a performing arts center, a recreation center, a gymnasium and athletic fields. The college owns three farms totaling 800 plus acres, supporting the only agricultural program in the region.

== History ==
At the urging of Mineral County member of the West Virginia House of Delegates, Francis M. Reynolds, Potomac State College was created in 1901 as the Keyser Preparatory Branch of West Virginia University, by an act of the West Virginia Legislature. 

After receiving an appropriation of $20,000 from the legislature for the construction of buildings, Colonel Thomas Beall Davis, a local businessman, donated 16 acres of land as a site for the new school. That location, formerly Fort Fuller (also known as Fort Kelly), was a critical fortress in maintaining open roads leading to the South Branch Potomac and Shenandoah Valleys and in retaining Union control of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) during the American Civil War. 

Once construction was completed on the multi-purpose building that would house offices, classrooms, a library, recitation halls and a gymnasium, the College opened its doors to 80 students in Fall 1902 as the West Virginia Preparatory School. Lloyd F. Friend was appointed principal and teacher and was joined by four other teachers.

In spring 1917, fire broke out in the multi-purpose building destroying most of the structure. Operations were moved to Davis Hall, named in honor of Thomas B. Davis, which was completed in 1916.  

With appropriations from the WV Legislature, a new Administration Building was completed in 1919.  That same year, the college purchased 129 acres of land adjacent to its property for its agriculture program. 

After decades as a regional campus of West Virginia University, Potomac State College became an integrated division of the university on July 1, 2005. Many non-academic services at Potomac State have now come under the control of its main campus.

== Campus buildings ==

Reynolds Hall, completed in 1925, is named after WV Senator E. B. Reynolds, the son of Francis M. Reynolds. In addition to securing funds for a women’s residence hall and gymnasium, E. B. Reynolds was also instrumental in Potomac State becoming part of West Virginia University. Reylonds Hall was a residence hall all until 2023, the building then was converted into offices. 

Lough Gymnasium was completed in 1928 in honor of Coach Dana G. Lough. At the request of Joseph W. Stayman, who served as principal from 1912 to 1936, the WV Legislature renamed the institution the Potomac State School of West Virginia in 1935. 

Mary F. Shipper Library was constructed in 1961. On October 16, 1976, the library was dedicated to Mary Fravel Shipper, long-time Library Director (1937-1973) . It’s the third library to exist in the colleges history. The first was in 1901 and was located in the Administration Building which burnt down in April 1917. A new Administration Building was completed in 1919 with the library being located on the first floor. The library was then moved to its current building in 1961. 

Science Hall, completed in 1951, houses laboratories and classrooms for the sciences. By an act of the WV Legislature, the school was renamed Potomac State College in 1953. Memorial Hall, a residence hall completed in 1957, was named in memory of the 41 former Potomac State students who lost their lives during World War II.

Friend Hall, a residence hall completed in 1962, was named in honor of Lloyd L. Friend who served as the first principal of the West Virginia Preparatory School. Academy Hall, which houses classrooms and offices, was completed in 1968.  It was so named to recognize the college&#x27;s academic heritage. 

Golden Park, the college’s baseball field, was completed in 2002 and was named after the Golden Family, whose son, Bryan, was a catcher on the Catamount&#x27;s baseball team. University Place, completed in 2007, houses students, offices, two dining facilities, study/social lounges, and a movie theater. The Indoor Riding Arena, sometimes referred to as the Equine Facility was completed in 2008. The facility houses the College’s American Quarter Horse herd and is used as a classroom and for equine and livestock competitions. 

Catamount Place, which previously served as Potomac Valley Hospital, was totally renovated to become a residence hall, opening its doors to students in January 2013 and closing its doors in 2023. 

The Recreation Center, located in the J. Edward Kelley Complex(named for Keyser, WV, native and Medal of Honor recipient J. Edward Kelley) It was formerly used as the National Guard Armory until its closer in 2015. The J. Edward Kelley Complex opened its doors in January 2017.

Davis Conference Center a historic building on campus that once contained the college cafeteria many years ago serves as a conference center for the college and the local communities. The conference center was renovated in 2023. Church-McKee Arts Center contains a large auditorium and classrooms. 

Starcher Agriculture Complex, named after former professor Don Starcher. Starcher worked at the college for 24 plus years. The complex includes the Ag Tech building, greenhouse, and a high tunnel.

==College farms==
The college has three farms totaling more than 800 acres.

Gustafson Farm sometimes referred to as the Upper Farm is named after former Professor Oscar Gustafson who worked at Potomac State from 1956 until his retirement in 1988. The farm is 368 acres, and serves as a mixed-use production farm and teaching lab. The farm houses the college’s goat operation. In 2023 the college had swine on the farm.

Malone Farm, named after former Agriculture professor Kenneth M. Malone. The farm houses the college’s cattle operation.

<text>Tank, Infantry, Black Prince (A43) is the name that was assigned to an experimental development of the Churchill tank with a larger, wider hull and a QF 17-pounder (76.2 mm) gun. It was named after Edward, the Black Prince, son of Edward III and heir to the English throne.

==Development==
As a development from the Churchill, the Black Prince was a continuation of the line of Infantry tanks, that is slower, heavier tanks intended to operate in close support of infantry. It also was able to work closely with other tanks. The parallel development in British tank design were the Cruiser tanks, which were intended for more mobile operations. A43 was the General Staff Specification number issued in 1943, for an interim tank that would eventually be superseded by a &quot;Universal tank&quot; that would replace both Infantry and Cruiser tanks.

The cruiser line led to the Cromwell and its 17 pounder-armed Challenger variant, eventually followed by the Comet equipped with the 77 mm gun firing similar ammunition to the 17 pounder. These tanks entered service during the war. While not as heavily protected as the Churchill, the Comet showed the way British tank development was going. This led to the last of the cruiser line and the first of the Universal tanks (now more widely known as main battle tanks), the very successful Centurion.

A larger gun than that carried by a conventional Churchill required a larger turret on a wider turret ring and consequently a widening of the tank hull. The Black Prince weighed around ten tons more than the Churchill so the suspension was modified and the tracks widened by 10 inches to carry the extra load. However, the Churchill&#x27;s engine was retained, leading to the tank being underpowered and slow, with maximum speeds on roads and cross country. This was so slow that the tank&#x27;s tactical usefulness would have been limited. Consideration was given to the use of the Rolls-Royce Meteor engine; this would have increased the available power to , but the idea never left the drawing–board. Likewise, plans to fit the Black Prince with the turret from the Centurion were never carried out.

By the time the Black Prince prototypes had appeared in May 1945, the 17-pounder armed Sherman Firefly had proved itself in combat, the Comet tank was in service and the introduction of Centurion was imminent. All these tanks carried the QF 17-pounder or an equivalent; all had better mobility than the Black Prince and the Centurion had frontal armour of comparable effectiveness. The Black Prince had become redundant and the project was abandoned.

The Black Prince marked the end of the development of the A22F Churchill Mk VII, and the end of the Infantry tank concept in British tank design.

==Survivors==

The only intact Black Prince is held by The Tank Museum in Bovington, UK; it is the fourth of the six prototypes that were built. It has recently been restored to running condition. A Black Prince hull was recovered from Salisbury Plain in the 1980s as part of the Tony Budge Collection, and is now held by the Rex and Rod Cadman Collection.

<doc id="1268189" wikidata="Q1897031" url="?curid=1268189" title="No Limit (2 Unlimited song)">
<text>&quot;No Limit&quot; is a song by Belgian/Dutch Eurodance group 2 Unlimited, released in January 1993 by Byte Records, ZYX Music and PWL. It was their fifth single in total and the first to be released from their second album, &quot;No Limits!&quot; (1993). Co-written by the group&#x27;s Ray Slijngaard and Anita Dels, the song became one of their most commercially successful singles, especially in Europe, reaching the number-one spot in 35 countries and the top 10 in several others. 

Like previous releases, the UK version of the single removed all of the raps from Slijngaard, leaving just Dels&#x27; vocals. One word from the rap was kept, the word &#x27;Techno&#x27; (from the line &quot;&quot;I&#x27;m making techno and I am proud&quot;) which was looped and repeated during the middle of the song, turning the line into &quot;Techno! Techno! Techno! Techno!&quot;&quot; and giving the song an extra vocal hook. Its accompanying music video was directed by Nick Burgess-Jones, depictng the group inside of a giant pinball machine. It received heavy rotation on MTV Europe.

==Composition==
&quot;No Limit&quot; started as an idea to do a high-speed techno track and was written in one evening by Dels and Slijngaard. Dels told in an interview, &quot;When we made &#x27;No Limit&#x27;, we were working on the LP. We&#x27;d done everything but one bit, and we didn&#x27;t know what to do — Ray and I made up the title quickly and then wrote the song in one evening. We didn&#x27;t expect anything, and we were surprised when the producer wanted to release it as the first single.&quot; 

Producer Phil Wilde explained to &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in 1994, &quot;Like most techno, 2 Unlimited&#x27;s material floats somewhere between 125 and 148bpm; &#x27;No Limit&#x27; came in at 144.&quot; Wilde programmed the rhythm with hand claps every four beat. He had the groove and went searching in his sound library, starting jamming with sounds. He explained in the same interview, &quot;For &#x27;No Limits&#x27; we started jamming with sounds. Then I got the sound which we used for the main melody in that song...it&#x27;s mostly a combination of sounds. It&#x27;s so important to have a good sound, and not so easy to fine one. On &#x27;No Limits&#x27;, the sound came, then the melody. We already had the bass and the drums, and the sample for the lead sound in the end was just a sample. But I&#x27;m not going to tell you what it was.&quot; 

==Chart performance==
&quot;No Limit&quot; peaked at number one in 35 countries. In Europe, it went to number-one in Austria (3 weeks), Flemish Belgium (6 weeks), Denmark (2 weeks), Finland (2 weeks), France (5), Ireland, the Netherlands (6 weeks), Norway (7 weeks), Portugal (1 week), Spain (3 weeks), Sweden (4 weeks), Switzerland (5 weeks), and the United Kingdom, as well as on the Eurochart Hot 100. In the UK, the single reached number-one in its third week on the UK Singles Chart, on 7 February 1993, after entering at number four and then climbing to number two. It stayed at the top of the chart for five consecutive weeks. Additionally, it also entered the top 10 in Germany (2), Greece (2), Iceland (4), and Italy (8). In Germany, the song was held off the top spot by Ace of Base&#x27;s &quot;All That She Wants&quot;, while in Greece, it peaked at number two, behind Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;I Feel You&quot;. &quot;No Limit&quot; debuted on the Eurochart Hot 100 at number 13 on 6 February after charting in Ireland, Sweden and the UK. It peaked at number one six weeks later, on 13 March, and stayed at the top for nine consecutive weeks. In the same period, it also topped the European Dance Radio Chart. Elsewhere, the song peaked at number two on the &quot;RPM&quot; Dance/Urban chart in Canada, number 16 in Zimbabwe and number 21 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart. In Oceania, it reached numbers seven and 50 in Australia and New Zealand, respectively.

The song was awarded with a gold record in Australia (35,000), Austria (25,000), France (352,000) and Germany (500,000), a silver record in the UK (532,000), and a platinum record in the Netherlands (75,000) and Switzerland (50,000).

In 2003, &quot;No Limit 2.3&quot; peaked at number 41 on the German Top 100 singles chart.

==Critical reception==
Larry Flick from &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote, &quot;After several weeks at the top of Britain&#x27;s pop charts, European rave duo is ready tackle the U.S. radio market with a bright ditty that melds techno, hi-NRG, and rap elements. The hook is irresistible, and the pace is heart-racing. Will please fans of last year&#x27;s hit, &#x27;Twilight Zone&#x27;, while reeling in newcomers.&quot; Tony Parsons from &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; named it a &quot;high-speed anthem&quot;. Per Reinholdt from Danish &quot;Gaffa&quot; called it a &quot;dance-powerhit&quot;, noting its &quot;inciting up-tempo&quot; and a rhythm and theme &quot;with the same temper as a dressed beeswarm&quot;. He also named the song a &quot;piece of pop art&quot;. In a &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; review, the sound of &#x27;No Limit&#x27; was compared to &quot;the sound giant dinosaurs might make stomping on cities&quot;. A reviewer from &quot;Irish Independent&quot; described it as &quot;a humungous global hit&quot;. 

In his weekly UK chart commentary, James Masterton wrote, &quot;Of all the techno-rave dance acts, 2 Unlimited are the most successful, notching up 5 hits in a row with all making the 20. &#x27;No Limit&#x27; being the latest and most frantic&quot;. The Stud Brothers of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; praised it as &quot;magnificently kitsch&quot;. Alan Jones from &quot;Music Week&quot; viewed it as &quot;obvious pop fare&quot;. James Hamilton from the &quot;Record Mirror&quot; Dance Update named it &quot;madly catchy&quot; and a &quot;tuneful techno pop galloper&quot;. Johnny Lee from &quot;Smash Hits&quot; called it a &quot;stormtrooper&quot;, adding that it has &quot;a keyboard that sounds like it&#x27;s being played by a robot with boxing gloves.&quot; Australian student newspaper &quot;Woroni&quot; complimented the song as &quot;tremendously exciting and highly recommended&quot;, naming it an &quot;obvious highlight&quot; of the &quot;No Limits!&quot; album. 

==Impact and legacy==
&quot;NME&quot; ranked &quot;No Limit&quot; number one in their list of &quot;Top Five Euro-Hits of All Time&quot; in December 1993. &quot;NME&quot; editor Paul Moody wrote, &quot;The ultimate piece of pop existentialism as Anita and Ray suggest the whole world is one huge playground of hedonistic excess. All to a video set within a huge pinball machine. Sublime.&quot; The song was ranked number 65 in &quot;BuzzFeed&quot;″s list of &quot;The 101 Greatest Dance Songs of the &#x27;90s&quot; in 2017. Stopera and Galindo said that &quot;this is possibly the most aggressive beat from the &#x27;90s. It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re strumming a GIANT rubber band.&quot; Tom Ewing of Freaky Trigger felt the track&#x27;s &quot;echoey hi-hat hits and the union of steam-hammer bass and rubber-ball synths&quot; carry the industrial, &quot;piston-powered aggression&quot; of Belgian rave music. He also noted the presence of a cowbell in the back of the track. In 2015, Graham Clark from &quot;The Yorkshire Times&quot; stated that &quot;the track at the time sounded unlike anything else but you can hear how it has influenced so many of today&#x27;s electronic dance music tracks&quot;.

==Music video==
The accompanying music video for &quot;No Limit&quot; was directed by Nick Burgess-Jones and filmed in London. It features group members Anita Dels and Ray Slijngaard performing inside what appears to be a giant pinball machine, wearing leather apparel. &quot;No Limit&quot; received heavy rotation on MTV Europe in March 1993. Burgess-Jones also directed the videos for 2 Unlimited&#x27;s next two singles, &quot;Tribal Dance&quot; and &quot;Faces&quot;.

<doc id="1268192" wikidata="Q369042" url="?curid=1268192" title="Pastoral epistles">
<text>The pastoral epistles are a group of three books of the canonical New Testament: the First Epistle to Timothy (1 Timothy), the Second Epistle to Timothy (2 Timothy), and the Epistle to Titus. They are presented as letters from Paul the Apostle to Timothy and to Titus. However, many scholars believe they were written after Paul&#x27;s death. They are generally discussed as a group and are given the title pastoral because they are addressed to individuals with pastoral oversight of churches and discuss issues of Christian living, doctrine and leadership. The term &quot;pastorals&quot; was popularized in 1703 by D. N. Berdot and in 1726 by Paul Anton. Alternate nomenclature for the cluster of three letters has been proposed: &quot;Corpus Pastorale,&quot; meant to highlight the intentional forgery of the letters as a three-part corpus, and &quot;Letters to Timothy and Titus,&quot; meant to emphasize the individuality of the letters.

==1 Timothy==
1 Timothy consists mainly of counsels to Timothy regarding the forms of worship and organization of the church, and the responsibilities resting on its several members, including &quot;epískopoi&quot; (, traditionally translated as &quot;bishops&quot;) and &quot;diákonoi&quot; (); and secondly of exhortation to faithfulness in maintaining the truth amid surrounding errors (4:1ff), presented as a prophecy of erring teachers &quot;to come&quot;. The epistle&#x27;s &quot;irregular character, abrupt connexions and loose transitions&quot; (Moffatt 1911), have led critics to discern later interpolations, such as the epistle-concluding 6:20–21, read as a reference to Marcion of Sinope, and lines that appear to be marginal glosses that have been copied into the body of the text.

==2 Timothy==
The author (who identifies himself as Paul the Apostle) entreats Timothy to come to him before winter, and to bring Mark with him (cf. Phil. 2:22). He was anticipating that &quot;the time of his departure was at hand&quot; (4:6), and he exhorts his &quot;son Timothy&quot; to all diligence and steadfastness in the face of false teachings, with advice about combating them with reference to the teachings of the past, and to patience under persecution (1:6–15), and to a faithful discharge of all the duties of his office (4:1–5), with all the solemnity of one who was about to appear before the Judge of the living and the dead.

==Titus==
This short letter is addressed to Titus, a Christian worker in Crete, and is traditionally divided into three chapters. It includes advice on the character and conduct required of Church leaders (chapter 1), a structure and hierarchy for Christian teaching within the church (chapter 2), and the kind of godly conduct and moral action required of Christians in response to God&#x27;s grace and gift of the Holy Spirit (chapter 3). It includes the line quoted by the author from a Cretan source: &quot;Cretans are always liars, wicked beasts, and lazy gluttons&quot; ().

==Text==
Two papyri contain parts of the Pastoral Epistles: 𝔓32 and 𝔓61. Pao considers Codex Sinaiticus to be “one of the most reliable witnesses for the [Pastoral Epistles], though it contains a series of unintentional omissions (1 Tim 2:6 [τό]; 3:8 [σεμνούς]; 4:8 [πρός]; Titus 1:13 [ἐν]).”

==Authorship==
The letters are written in Paul&#x27;s name and have traditionally been accepted as authentic. 
Since the 1700s, however, scholars have increasingly come to see them as the work of someone writing after Paul&#x27;s death.

===Critical view: rejecting Pauline authorship===
On the basis of their language, content, and other factors, the pastoral epistles are considered by skeptical scholars as having been not written by Paul, but written after his death. (The Second Epistle to Timothy, however, is sometimes thought to be more likely than the other two to have been written by Paul.) Beginning with Friedrich Schleiermacher in a letter published in 1807, biblical textual critics and scholars examining the texts fail to find their vocabulary and literary style similar to Paul&#x27;s unquestionably authentic letters, fail to fit the life situation of Paul in the epistles into Paul&#x27;s reconstructed biography, and identify principles of the emerged Christian church rather than those of the apostolic generation.

As an example of qualitative style arguments, in the First Epistle to Timothy the task of preserving the tradition is entrusted to ordained presbyters; the clear sense of &quot;presbýteros&quot; () as an indication of an office is a sense that to these scholars seems alien to Paul and the apostolic generation. Examples of other offices include the twelve apostles in &quot;Acts&quot; and the appointment of seven deacons, thus establishing the office of the diaconate. &quot;Presbýteros&quot; is sometimes translated as &quot;elder&quot;; via Ecclesiastical Latin it is also the Greek root for the English word &quot;priest&quot;. (The office of presbyter is also mentioned in James chapter 5.)

A second example would be gender roles depicted in the letters. The pastoral letters proscribe certain roles for women in a manner that appears to deviate from Paul&#x27;s more egalitarian teaching that in Christ there is neither male nor female. Separate male and female roles, however, were not foreign to the authentic Pauline epistles; the First Letter to the Corinthians (14:34–35) commands silence from women during church services, stating that &quot;it is a shame for women to speak in the church&quot;. Father Jerome Murphy-O&#x27;Connor, O.P., in the &quot;New Jerome Biblical Commentary&quot;, &quot;agrees with many other commentators on this passage over the last hundred years in recognising it to be an interpolation by a later editor of 1 Corinthians of a passage from 1 Timothy 2:11–15 that states a similar &#x27;women should be silent in churches. This made 1 Corinthians more widely acceptable to church leaders in later times. If verses before or after 1 Corinthians 14:34–35 are read, it is fairly clear that verses 34 and 35 seem out of place.

Similarly, biblical scholars since Schleiermacher in 1807 have noted that the pastoral epistles seem to argue against a version of Gnosticism that is more developed than would be compatible with Paul&#x27;s time.

The pastoral epistles are omitted in some early bible manuscripts, including the fourth century Codex Vaticanus (one of the oldest mostly complete bible manuscripts in existence) and the second or third century Chester Beatty Papyrus 46 (the oldest mostly complete copy of the Pauline epistles).

Luke Timothy Johnson asserts &quot;the impossibility of &quot;demonstrating&quot; the authenticity of the Pastoral Letters&quot;. However, he thinks that &quot;the grounds for declaring them inauthentic are so flawed as to seriously diminish the validity of the scholarly &#x27;majority opinion.&#x27;&quot;

So some scholars refer to the anonymous author as &quot;the Pastor&quot;.

===Traditional view: Saint Paul===
Among the Apostolic Fathers, &quot;a strong case can be made for Ignatius&#x27; use of ... 1 and 2 Timothy&quot;. Similarly for Polycarp. The unidentified author of the Muratorian fragment (c. 170) lists the Pastorals as Pauline, while excluding others e.g. to the Laodiceans. Origen refers to the &quot;fourteen epistles of Paul&quot; without specifically naming Titus or Timothy. However it is believed that Origen wrote a commentary on at least the epistle to Titus.

Biblical scholars such as Stanley Porter or Ray Van Neste who ascribe the books to Paul find their placement fits within his life and work and see the linguistic differences as complementary to differences in the recipients. While other Pauline epistles have fledgling congregations as the audience, the recipients of record in the Pastoral Epistles are Paul&#x27;s close companions, evangelists whom he has extensively worked with and trained. In this view, linguistic differences are to be expected, if one is to ascribe Pauline authorship to them.

==Date==
It is highly probable that 1 and 2 Timothy were known and used by Polycarp in his epistle to the Philippians. Polycarp is known to have died around 155–167, so this would seem to set an upper limit for the dating of the pastoral epistles. Irenaeus explicitly references the epistles to Timothy in his anti-Gnostic treatise &quot;Against Heresies&quot;, written c. 180. Proposals by scholars for the date of their composition have ranged from the 1st century to well into the second.

The later dates are usually based on the hypothesis that the Pastorals are responding to specific 2nd-century developments, such as Marcionism and Gnosticism. Several scholars have argued that the pastoral epistles attack Marcionism in particular. If Marcion is taken to have started his ministry in earnest only after his excommunication from the Roman church in 144 CE, then this would suggest that the pastoral epistles were written after 144. Furthermore, the fact that Marcion&#x27;s canon did not include the pastoral epistles is another piece of evidence for which any model must account.

On the other hand, according to Raymond E. Brown (&quot;An Introduction to the New Testament&quot;, 1997), the majority of scholars who accept a post-Pauline date of composition for the Pastorals favour the period 80–100. Scholars supporting a date in this mid range can draw on the description in 2 Timothy 1:5 of Timothy&#x27;s Christian mother and grandmother who passed on their faith, as alluding to the original audience being third generation Christians.
