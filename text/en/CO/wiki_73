<text>John James &#x27;Sean&#x27; Kelly (born 24 May 1956) is an Irish former professional road bicycle racer, one of the most successful road cyclists of the 1980s, and one of the finest Classics riders of all time. From becoming a professional in 1977 until his retirement in 1994, he won 193 professional races, including nine Monument Classics, Paris–Nice a record seven years consecutively and the first UCI Road World Cup in 1989. Kelly won one Grand Tour, the 1988 Vuelta a España, and four green jerseys in the Tour de France. He achieved multiple victories in the Giro di Lombardia, Milan–San Remo, Paris–Roubaix and Liège–Bastogne–Liège, as well as three runners-up placings in the only Monument he failed to win, the Tour of Flanders. Other victories include the Grand Prix des Nations and stage races, the Critérium International, Tour de Suisse, Tour of the Basque Country and Volta a Catalunya.

Kelly twice won bronze medals (1982, 1989) in the Road World Championships Elite Men&#x27;s Road Race and finished fifth in 1987, the year compatriot Stephen Roche won gold. When the FICP rankings became established in March 1984, Kelly was the first cyclist to be ranked World No.1, a position he held for a record five consecutive years. In the 1984 season, Kelly achieved 33 victories.

==Early life and amateur career==

Kelly is the second son of Jack (John) and Nellie Kelly, a farming family in Curraghduff, County Waterford. He was born at Belleville Maternity Home in Waterford City on 24 May 1956. He was named John James Kelly after his father and was referred to as &quot;Sean&quot; to avoid confusion at home. Seán is the Irish form of John.

For eight years he was educated at Crehana National School, County Waterford, to which he travelled with his older brother Joe. The journey from home in Curraghduff to Crehana School was approximately a-mile-and-a-half. Together, both he and Sean cycled to and from school. Joe later recollects: &quot;I suppose we were like most young fellows at that age – walking was too dull.&quot; Official records from his days at Crehana National School confirm Kelly&#x27;s satisfactory attendance. At school, he was exceedingly shy, unsure of himself and felt intellectually outclassed by other pupils in his class. As a result, Kelly retreated into almost total silence. His education ended aged only 13 when he left school to help on the farm at home after his father went to a hospital in Waterford with an ulcer. At 16, he began work as a bricklayer.

In September 1969, a delegation from the newly formed Carrick Wheelers Road Club visited the Christian Brothers Secondary School, where Joe was a student. In Joe&#x27;s classroom, the representatives from the cycling club encouraged the pupils to join a recently formed schoolboy cycling league. Joe was fascinated. He joined the schoolboy league, began winning races, and joined the Carrick Wheelers Road Club as a new member. In the Kelly household, the pattern was for Joe to do something, and Sean would follow in his footsteps. And so it was, from humble beginnings, Sean soon joined Joe. On Tuesday, 4 August 1970, aged 14, Sean competed in his first race at Kennedy Terrace, Carrickbeg, County Tipperary, part of Carrick-on-Suir. The race was an eight-mile (12.87 km) handicap, which meant the weaker riders started first and the best last. Kelly set off three minutes before the backmarkers, which included his brother Joe. He was still three minutes ahead of the pursuers when the course turned for home after four miles (6.43 km) and more than three minutes in the lead when he crossed the finish line. In July 1972, aged 16, he won the National Junior Road Championships at Banbridge, County Down.

Kelly won the National Junior Road Championships again in 1973. He took a senior cycling license in 1974, passing up the opportunity to bid for a third consecutive National Junior Road title. In 1974, aged only 17, two months short of his eighteenth birthday, Kelly won the Shay Elliott Memorial Race. That season he participated in the Tour of Ireland and the Tour of Scotland and achieved ten victories as a senior competitor while still eligible to race as a junior. In 1975, Kelly successfully defended his title, winning the Shay Elliott Memorial Race for the second time. He won three stages of the 1975 Tour of Ireland and the mountains jersey. Kelly won stage 7 of the 1975 Tour of Britain, beating Swede Bernt Johansson and Polish rider Jan Trybala in a three-way sprint. Johansson became Olympic Road Race Champion in Montreal a year later. Kelly&#x27;s exploits at the 1975 Tour of Britain caught the eye of a Londoner, John Morris, who had connections with amateur Velo Club Metz in Metz, France. Morris informed Metz of Kelly&#x27;s potential. In August 1975, Alain Steinhoff, a member of the Metz club, travelled to the World Championships in Belgium, where Kelly was competing in the amateur road race. Steinhoff offered Kelly a place on the amateur team V. C Metz-Woippy. Kelly assured Steinhoff that he would consider the offer and promised to contact the club sometime during the following winter. Club Metz heard nothing from Kelly during the winter because his focus of attention shifted to competing in the Rapport Toer stage race in South Africa as preparation for the 1976 Olympic Games.

In late September 1975, Kelly and two other Irish riders, Pat and Kieron McQuaid went to South Africa to participate in the Rapport Toer stage race in preparation for the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, Canada. Because of an international ban on athletes competing in South Africa, as a consequence of a protest against apartheid, the three Irish cyclists and two Scottish, John Curran and Henry Wilbraham, competed as a British team under false names. The squad were called &quot;Mum for Men&quot; and managed by Tommy Shardelow. When the Irish Cycling Federation received news of their escapades in South Africa, Kelly and the McQuaids incurred a seven-month suspension from racing, reduced after an appeal to six months. Kelly and the McQuaids returned to competitive racing at the end of April 1976.

After resuming racing, Kelly won the Tour of the North in Ulster, Ireland and the Cinturón a Mallorca in Mallorca, Spain. He also won one stage at the 1976 Tour of Britain and one at the 1976 Tour of Ireland. On 29 May 1976, Kelly, Pat and Kieron McQuaid, as a consequence of their participation in the Rapport Toer in South Africa, were barred from the 1976 Olympic Games by the International Olympic Committee. It&#x27;s misinformation that the ban from the Olympics was for life.

 With the dream of competing at the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal now shattered, Kelly suddenly required an alternative plan for the rest of the summer to fill the gut-wrenching void. He cast his mind back to Velo Club Metz&#x27;s interest in August 1975 and penned a short letter to them asking what they could offer. He received a swift reply, offering free accommodation, £25 per week and free replacements for cycling equipment impaired during races. Kelly accepted the proposition and travelled to Metz in mid-June 1976. Soon after arriving, his motivation grew when he learned Velo Club Metz had an arrangement that a rider would pocket four francs a kilometre for every race won. During the five months he spent with Velo Club Metz, Kelly was victorious in eighteen of the twenty-five races he started, including his most prestigious win, the Piccolo Giro di Lombardia in Italy.

Kelly&#x27;s time with Velo Club Metz proved lucrative as he returned home to Ireland £800 richer. The money earned made cycling with Metz worthwhile. He told club officials he would return to V.C Metz-Woippy for the 1977 season. Not long after returning home, Kelly contacted Pat McQuaid, asking if he&#x27;d be interested in going to Metz with him. McQuaid immediately agreed to go. In early November 1976, Velo Club Metz flew Kelly and McQuaid to London. Metz sent a delegate to meet them there. With the assistance of the club representative and Londoner John Morris, proposals were accepted, which would cover the two Irish amateurs in Metz for the 1977 season. The bonus scheme offered was substantially better than what Kelly had acquired in his first season with Metz.

During Kelly&#x27;s stint with Velo Club Metz in the 1976 season, an impressive stage win at the Tour de Haute-Marne in Northeastern France caught the attention of Jean-Pierre Douçot. Douçot, a former amateur cyclist, was a mechanic and talent scout in eastern France. Jean-Pierre informed Jean de Gribaldy, a directeur sportif from Besançon who was putting together a French squad for the Belgian professional team, , of Kelly&#x27;s potential. Later, Kelly&#x27;s win at the end of the season on 2 October 1976 in the Piccolo Giro di Lombardia left an indelible impression, which convinced de Gribaldy to act upon Douçot&#x27;s earlier recommendation.

On 9 December 1976, a private jet was flown from Dole Airport, near Besançon and landed at Dublin Airport. Onboard was directeur sportif Jean de Gribaldy, pilot Bernard Dagot and a youthful French amateur cyclist, Noël Converset. Dagot, Chief Air Traffic Controller at Dole Airport, spoke fluent English and his linguistic skills earned him the role of an interpreter. Converset, Kelly&#x27;s teammate at Metz, was taken to Ireland to identify Kelly and assist in the recruitment process. The three Frenchmen hired a taxi in Dublin to take them to Carrick-on-Suir. Upon arrival in Carrick-on-Suir, they were given directions to Kelly&#x27;s home in rural Curraghduff. Arriving unexpectedly, Jack and Nellie Kelly greeted them. Sean, who wasn&#x27;t at home, was out driving a tractor. The trio decided to drive out the Dungarvan road in the hope that they would discover Kelly on his trip back home in the tractor. Soon they encountered a tractor, driven by a young man, travelling towards them. De Gribaldy asked Converset, &quot;Is that Kelly?&quot; to which the uncertain Converset hesitantly answered. De Gribaldy ordered the driver to bring the taxi to a halt. Dagot emerged from the taxi hailing the tractor and asked the driver, &quot;Are you Sean Kelly?&quot; to which the response was, &quot;Yes, I am Sean Kelly.&quot; Both parties agreed to go to Kelly&#x27;s home in Curraghduff for negotiations. De Gribaldy offered Kelly an annual salary of £4000, which Kelly declined. Kelly consulted Pat McQuaid and Ireland&#x27;s cycling team manager John Lackey for advice. A week later, de Gribaldy telephoned Kelly, at home in Ireland from Besançon. Kelly successfully negotiated a deal, asking for £6000 in the process, which Gribaldy agreed to. Kelly now had a professional contract with Flandria. Pat&#x27;s brother Oliver replaced Kelly at Velo Club Metz.

Kelly travelled to France in late January 1977 and lived for two years at 18, Place de la Révolution (formerly, Place du Marché) in Besançon, de Gribaldy&#x27;s home town. The apartment was above a bike shop owned by de Gribaldy. He shared with four teammates, Noël Converset, Marcel Tinazzi, René Bittinger and Dominique Sanders.

==Professional career==
===Early years===
Flandria were a Belgian cycling team sponsored by a Belgian company Flandria, which manufactured bicycles, mopeds and scooters. Guillaume Driessens was the directeur sportif of the Flandria team, one of the world&#x27;s best, with riders such as Freddy Maertens, Marc Demeyer and Michel Pollentier among their ranks. Flandria required a French squad to expand its commercial interests in France, so they hired Jean de Gribaldy to assemble and direct a new team. The French squad competed predominantly in smaller French races. The Belgian team based in Belgium contained the strongest and most experienced riders. Good performances meant promotion from de Gribaldy&#x27;s French squad to the Belgian team.

On 7 February 1977, Kelly participated in his first race as a professional competitor, the first stage of the six-day stage race Étoile de Bessèges. He made an impressive debut, finishing tenth in the opening stage and third in the final overall general classification. On 19 February 1977, in the first stage of the Tour Méditerranéen, Kelly was denied his first professional victory. Without the benefit of a photo-finish, the judge at the finish line deemed Jan Raas the winner in a sprint finish, with Kelly given second place. Several years later, a photographer who had captured a photo at the finish line that day met Kelly in southern France, showing him the image which provided emphatic evidence that Kelly was the winner of the stage.

On 6 March 1977, in a six-man sprint finish, Kelly recorded his first win as a professional, the pro-am Grand Prix de Lugano in Switzerland. Kelly&#x27;s early impressive displays caught the attention of Guillaume Driessens and the Belgian Flandria squad, resulting in Kelly being promoted and selected to compete with their team at the 1977 Paris–Nice as a domestique for Freddy Maertens. Maertens won the opening prologue and defended his leader&#x27;s jersey throughout the entire race winning overall.

On 19 March 1977, Kelly participated in his first Monument Classic, the Milan–San Remo. On 11 May 1977, competing with the French squad, Kelly won the first stage of the Tour de Romandie in Switzerland and finished tenth overall in the final general classification. On 25 May 1977, Kelly won the French one-day race Circuit de l&#x27;Indre, outsprinting Eddy Merckx into second place. In October 1977, Kelly recorded his fourth win of the season, outsprinting Frenchman Serge Périn in the fourth stage of the Étoile des Espoirs.

Kelly stayed with de Gribaldy for 1978. In 1978, he started in the Tour de France, in which he also won a stage. Michel Pollentier was disqualified from the 1978 Tour de France after cheating a drugs test on the afternoon that he took the race lead. He left the team at the end of the season and started his own, with a new backer, Splendor. Both Maertens and Pollentier wanted Kelly. Pollentier and Splendor offered Kelly more and made him a team leader. Kelly and Pollentier often shared hotel rooms. But Splendor was new and logistic problems became obvious. The bikes were in poor state – enough that Splendor decided not to ride Paris–Roubaix – and the manager, Robert Lauwers, was replaced. Kelly rose above it and rode for himself.

===Stage successes===

By now Kelly had a reputation as a sprinter who could not win stage races, although he did finish fourth in the 1980 Vuelta a España. De Gribaldy employed him as unambiguous team leader, someone he believed could win stage races and not just stages. To this end, de Gribaldy encouraged Kelly to lose weight, convincing the latter that he could target the overall win at Paris–Nice: Kelly won the &quot;Race to the Sun&quot; and four of its stages. On the last of those, a time-trial to the Col d&#x27;Èze, he beat Gilbert Duclos-Lassalle and pushed him out of the lead. Years later Kelly admitted that his countryman Roche&#x27;s emergence during his neo-pro season in 1981, during which he had also won Paris–Nice, was one of the factors which motivated him to adjust his focus to becoming more of an all-round rider. However, the spring classics season proved a disappointment, with Kelly&#x27;s best result being a 12th place in Paris–Roubaix after suffering multiple punctures. Despite that, that season he went on to win another of objectives set by de Gribaldy: the points classification of the Tour de France, where he took five second places on flat stages before winning a reduced bunch sprint in Pau after climbing the Col d&#x27;Aubisque. His points total was nearly three times that of the points classification runner-up, the yellow jersey winner Bernard Hinault. He won bronze in the 1982 Road World Championships Elite Men&#x27;s Road Race in Goodwood, West Sussex, England, the first world medal for an Irish rider since Shay Elliott&#x27;s silver in 1962. At the end of the year, Kelly married his girlfriend, Linda Grant, the daughter of a local cycling club official. Carrick-on-Suir named the town square &quot;Sean Kelly Square&quot; in tribute to his achievements in the 1982 Tour de France and his bronze medal at the 1982 World Championships. The following year, 1983, Kelly won Paris–Nice for the second time, the first of three Critérium International victories, his first Tour de Suisse and the points classification in the Tour de France for the second consecutive year. Kelly wore the yellow jersey in the 1983 Tour de France for one day, during the mountainous stage 10 from Pau to Bagnères-de-Luchon, which included the Pyrenean climbs, the Aubisque, Tourmalet, Aspin and Peyresourde. It was the only time he would wear the &quot;&quot;maillot jaune&quot;&quot; () at the Tour.

Kelly confirmed his potential in autumn 1983. A leading group of 18 entered Como in the Giro di Lombardia after a battle over the Intelvi and Schignano passes. Kelly won the sprint to take his first Monument by the narrowest margin, less than half a wheel separating the first four, against cycling greats including Francesco Moser, Adri van der Poel, Hennie Kuiper and World Champion Greg LeMond.

Kelly dominated the following spring. He won Paris–Nice for the third successive time beating Roche as well as the Tour de France winner, Bernard Hinault who was returning after a knee injury. Kelly finished second in Milan–San Remo and the Tour of Flanders, but was unbeatable in Paris–Roubaix and Liège–Bastogne–Liège. The day after Paris–Roubaix, the French daily sports paper, L&#x27;Équipe, pictured Kelly cycling the cobbles with mud on his face and had the heading &quot;Insatiable Kelly!&quot; referring to his appetite for winning that spring. He won all three stages in the Critérium International: the bunch sprint on stage 1, a solo victory in the mountain stage and beating Roche in the final time trial. Kelly achieved 33 victories in 1984. He was becoming a contender in the Grand Tours, as seen by finishing fifth in the Tour de France. This may have caused him to lose his grip on the points classification in that year&#x27;s Tour. Kelly was wearing it as the Tour was finishing on the Champs-Élysées but lost it in the bunch finish to the Belgian, Frank Hoste, who finished ahead of Kelly gaining points to take the jersey off Kelly&#x27;s shoulders.

He won Paris–Nice in 1985, again beating Roche. He also took three stage wins at the Vuelta a España, but suffered a frustrating spring classics season, taking a third place at Paris–Roubaix and fourth at Liège–Bastogne–Liège, but losing out on wins through poor tactical decisions, such as at Milan–San Remo where he and rival Eric Vanderaerden marked each other out of contention. He won the points classification for the third time and finished fourth overall in the 1985 Tour de France, where his rivalry with Vanderaerden boiled over at the finish of the sixth stage in Reims: the latter veered to prevent Kelly from coming past in the final sprint, leading Kelly to push Vanderarden, and the Belgian pulling the Irishman&#x27;s jersey in response. The race saw him battle for the last step on the GC podium with Stephen Roche: although Roche finished the Tour in third position overall, the duo&#x27;s performances saw interest in the race expanding gradually in the Irish press. Kelly won the first Nissan International Classic beating Adri van der Poel. At the end of the season, he won the Giro di Lombardia.

He won Milan–San Remo in 1986 after winning Paris–Nice. In Milan–San Remo, Kelly was being marked closely by Vanderaerden in the closing stages of the race. Mario Beccia attacked on the race&#x27;s final climb of the Poggio di San Remo and was followed by Greg LeMond. In order to shake Vanderaerden, Kelly feigned a mechanical problem before sprinting away to join the lead group, and drove hard on the front to prevent Niki Rüttimann, LeMond&#x27;s team-mate, who had followed Kelly, from linking up with the front group: Kelly won the three-up sprint at the finish. He also took stage wins at the Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana, Critérium International and Three Days of De Panne. He finished second in the Tour of Flanders and won Paris–Roubaix again. According to his autobiography &quot;Hunger&quot;, Kelly gave his support to Van der Poel in the latter&#x27;s bid to win Flanders in exchange for the Dutchman&#x27;s help in the French cobbled Classic. In Flanders, Kelly rode on the front of the leading four man group in the closing stages of the race, which also included Van der Poel, Jean-Philippe Vandenbrande and Steve Bauer: regarding the final sprint, Kelly wrote that &quot;I started my sprint early, and I knew Van der Poel was probably in my wheel as well, but I certainly gave it 100 percent.&quot; After Flanders, he flew to Spain to race the Tour of the Basque Country, which he won, before flying north to compete in Paris–Roubaix. Roles were reversed as Kelly followed Van der Poel in latching onto an attack from Ferdi Van Den Haute on a late cobbled &quot;secteur&quot; to form another four-man group along with Rudy Dhaenens. Van Den Haute attacked again a kilometre from the race finish – which was located away from Roubaix Velodrome for the first time since 1943 – and once again Van der Poel led Kelly out in the sprint, enabling the latter to cross the line first. To date, Kelly is one of only four riders to win the double of Milan–San Remo and Paris–Roubaix in the same year, along with Cyrille van Hauwaert in 1908, John Degenkolb in 2015 and Mathieu van der Poel in 2023. Kelly was engaged in an intense racing schedule, even by contemporary standards, having competed 34 times from the beginning of the season to 1986. He later explained this as partly due to the influence of Jean de Gribaldy, who reasoned that he might as well race if he was going to have to train on his bike if he didn&#x27;t compete, and because of new sponsor Kas, a Spanish soft drink manufacturer, who were primarily concerned with success in Spain, and uninterested in winning the Classics, meaning Kelly had to compete in both types of races. He finished on a podium in a Grand Tour for the first time when he finished third in the 1986 Vuelta a España, winning two stages along the way. As a result of serious injuries sustained in a crash during the final stage of the 1986 Tour de Suisse, in which he went over a wall on a descent, Kelly missed the 1986 Tour de France. He returned to Ireland and won the Nissan Classic again. His second win in the Nissan came after a duel with Steve Bauer, who took the yellow jersey after Kelly crashed numerous times. Kelly went into the final stage three seconds behind Bauer and took the jersey when he finished third on the stage and won bonus seconds. Kelly took more than 30 victories in total across the 1986 season.

Kelly won Paris–Nice in 1987 on the last day after Roche, the leader, punctured. Later, leading the Vuelta a España with three days to go, he retired with an extremely painful saddle sore. His bad luck continued in the Tour de France, retiring after fracturing his collarbone in a crash. After the 1987 Road World Championships Elite Men&#x27;s Road Race, in which he finished fifth behind Roche, Kelly returned to Ireland to win the Nissan Classic for the third consecutive time.

Kelly won his seventh consecutive Paris–Nice in the spring of 1988, a record. He won Gent–Wevelgem several weeks later.

===Grand Tour success===

Kelly returned in April to the 1988 Vuelta a España which started on the rugged mountainous island of Tenerife where his team struggled in the second stage, losing the influential rider Thomas Wegmüller to dysentery and losing further time in the time-trial around Las Palmas. However, on the Spanish mainland, Kelly concentrated on winning sprint time bonuses, battling with sprinter Manuel Jorge Domínguez, the teammate of leader, Laudelino Cubino.

After regaining a minute in four days, the race reached the mountains where Kelly relied on help from Robert Millar of team to stay within two minutes of Cubino after the mountain trial to Alto Oviedo. He then finished fourth behind stage-winner Fabio Parra and Anselmo Fuerte on stage 13 to the ski-station at Cerler, cutting a minute and a half into Cubino&#x27;s lead. From this stage, Fuerte had moved into second overall and later took the jersey from Cubino on the 16th stage to Albacete when the leader got caught on the wrong side of a split caused by cross-winds.

Kelly maintained the gap between himself and Fuerte and started the time trial on the second last day 21 seconds behind. Confident that he could overhaul the leader, he &quot;put it in a big gear and gave it everything.&quot; He took the leader&#x27;s &quot;maillot amarillo&quot; (yellow jersey), beating Fuerte by almost two minutes. The following day Kelly won his only Grand Tour, over West German Raimund Dietzen and also won the points competition. After his Vuelta win Kelly returned to Carrick-on-Suir where a parade was held in his honour.

===Twilight of his career===
Kelly finished 46th overall in the 1988 Tour de France, just over an hour behind winner, Spaniard Pedro Delgado, and later admitted he was no longer a contender for overall victory. He finished third behind the German, Rolf Gölz, in the 1988 Nissan Classic. In 1989, Kelly switched to the Dutch team and stayed there for three years until the end of the 1991 season. He achieved his first major victory with PDM in 1989, winning the Liège–Bastogne–Liège for the second time. The same year he won the points classification in the Tour de France for the fourth time and the inaugural UCI Road World Cup championship. He won bronze in the sprint finish at the rainy 1989 Road World Championships Elite Men&#x27;s Road Race in Chambéry, France behind Dimitri Konyshev and winner Greg LeMond.

Kelly won the Tour de Suisse in 1990 for the second time. In March 1991, while competing in the Paris–Nice, he broke his right collarbone. During the 1991 Tour de France, the entire PDM team, including Kelly, abandoned the race, citing illness, which later became known as the &quot;Intralipid Affair.&quot; In August 1991, Kelly abandoned his racing schedule to participate in the Tour of Galicia after his brother Joe was tragically killed in the Comeragh 100 near Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary. He came back to win his fourth Nissan Classic by four seconds over Sean Yates and went on to win the Giro di Lombardia at the end of the season.

Kelly won the Giro di Lombardia for a third time in 1991 but started 1992 regarded as past his prime. He moved to in 1992 and prepared for Milan–San Remo. Race favourite Moreno Argentin attacked from the leading group on the final climb, the Poggio. He broke clear after several attempts and reached the top eight seconds before the rest. It seemed he was on his way to a solo victory as the peloton descended the Poggio, where Maurizio Fondriest led, marked by Argentin&#x27;s teammate Rolf Sørensen. Kelly was behind these two in third position. Kelly attacked with three kilometres of descending left. Sorensen could not hold his acceleration and Kelly got away. He caught Argentin with a kilometre to go. Both stalled, the chasers closing fast, Argentin gesturing to Kelly to take the front. Kelly stayed on Argentin&#x27;s wheel. The two moved again, preparing for a sprint; Kelly launched himself and in the final 200m came past Argentin to win his final Classic.

Kelly&#x27;s first appearance and sole participation in the Giro d&#x27;Italia was in 1992. His team, Lotus–Festina, was offered a wild card entry under the condition that Kelly was included in their starting team. He pulled out of the race after stage 16 from Palazzolo sull’Oglio to Sondrio, later admitting his intention of not completing the Giro and his agreement with his directeur sportif that he would withdraw at some stage.

In 1992, Kelly travelled to Colombia for the Clásico RCN, where he won the second stage. His former PDM teammate, Martin Earley, pushed him into second place at the 1994 Irish National Road Championships.

Kelly&#x27;s last year as a professional was 1994, when he rode for Catavana. He returned to Carrick-on-Suir at the end of the season to ride the annual Hamper race. That was Kelly&#x27;s last race as a professional. Eddy Merckx, Laurent Fignon, Bernard Hinault, Roger De Vlaeminck, Claude Criquielion, Stephen Roche, Martin Earley, Acácio da Silva and Paul Kimmage were among 1,200 cyclists present. The President of Ireland, Mary Robinson, attended a civic presentation to Kelly the day before the race. Kelly won in a sprint against Roche. Kelly won this race again six years later.

==Legacy and riding style==

Kelly&#x27;s career spanned the eras of several legends of the Tour de France, from Eddy Merckx through to Miguel Induráin. His first Tour was also the first for Bernard Hinault and the two battled in the sprint of stage 15. Greg LeMond and Laurent Fignon emerged in the early eighties and challenged Kelly in the Classics as well as in the Tour, and Kelly witnessed the rise of Miguel Induráin and the early career of Lance Armstrong. Kelly&#x27;s career coincided with Stephen Roche as well as Classics specialists including Francesco Moser, Claude Criquielion, Moreno Argentin and Eric Vanderaerden. Evidence of Kelly&#x27;s dominance can be seen from his three victories in the season-long Super Prestige Pernod International competition (predecessor to the World Cup). Kelly competed throughout the season, from Paris–Nice in March to the Giro di Lombardia in October, winning both in 1983 and 1985.

While some sprinters remain sheltered in the peloton until the final few hundred metres, Kelly could instigate breaks and climb well, proving this by winning the Vuelta a España in 1988, as well as winning a stage of Paris–Nice on the climb of Mont Ventoux. His victories in Paris–Roubaix (1984, 1986) showed his ability in poor weather and on pavé sections, while he could stay with the climbing specialists in the mountains in the Tour de France. He was also a formidable descender, clocking a career top race speed of 124 km/h (77 mi/h), while descending from Col de Joux Plane to Morzine on stage 19 of the Tour in 1984. He finished fourth in the Tour in 1985 and won the points classification in 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1989, the first to win four times, a feat he repeated in the Vuelta a España. Kelly won five stages in the Tour de France and 16 in the Vuelta a España.

Kelly was also an outstanding time trialist. In the inaugural 1985 Nissan Classic, Kelly, wearing a skinsuit, racing a Vitus Plus Carbone road bike with drop handlebars and a rear Mavic disc wheel, produced a magnificent performance in the stage 3a, 21 km (13.04 mi) individual time trial from Carrick-on-Suir to Clonmel. His winning time of 24:09 was 49 seconds quicker than second-placed Stephen Roche. Kelly&#x27;s winning average speed of 52.173 km/h (32.419 mi/h) was faster than any individual had ever accomplished in a time trial, further than 20 km. It took another four years to surpass this record when American Greg LeMond averaged 54.545 km/h (33.893 mi/h) in the historical 24.5 km (15.22 mi) individual time trial from Versailles to Paris at the 1989 Tour de France.

==Doping==
Kelly failed drug tests twice during his career. After the 1984 edition of Paris–Brussels, in which he had finished third, cycling authorities stated that a urine sample supplied by Kelly had tested positive for pemoline (Stimul), a result which was repeated with the testing of a B sample. The Royal Belgian Cycling League sentenced Kelly to a three-month suspended ban and a fine. Kelly denied taking any banned substances: in an interview at the time with David Walsh, he claimed that there were &quot;irregularities at the testing centre that day ... the medical control at Paris-Brussels was very badly organised and lots of people were in the room who had no right to be there ... in all this confusion something must have gone wrong&quot;. In his autobiography &quot;Hunger&quot;, Kelly stated that Irish Cycling Federation official Karl McCarthy, who acted as a witness on Kelly&#x27;s behalf at the second test as he was unable to attend due to racing commitments, told him that the B sample was &quot;tiny&quot; and below the amount required for the test. In his book &quot;Massacre à la chaîne: Révélations sur 30 ans de tricheries (Chain massacre: Revelations on 30 years of cheating)&quot;, Kelly&#x27;s former soigneur Willy Voet claimed that Kelly had been ill with bronchitis in the week before the race and had taken ephedrine to treat it: to avoid a positive test, Voet wrote that Kelly had carried a container in his shorts filled with urine supplied by one of the team&#x27;s mechanics to doping control, and that the Stimul detected in the sample had been taken by the mechanic to help him stay awake while driving the team&#x27;s truck.

Kelly&#x27;s second positive test occurred at the 1988 Tour of the Basque Country, where he tested positive for codeine. Having finished fourth in the overall classification, he received a ten-minute penalty that dropped him down the order. Kelly explained this as being the result of a worsening cough he had developed during the race: he said that between the end of the final stage and attending doping control he took a swig from a bottle of cough medicine, to which he attributed the presence of codeine in his urine sample.

==Post-cycling career==
Kelly is a commentator for the English-language services of Eurosport where he has been described as the Rolls-Royce of commentators. He is known for giving great insight into races and typically commentates on all the big races including the Tour de France, Giro d&#x27;Italia and the Vuelta a España.

He has established and is involved in the Sean Kelly Cycling Academy in Belgium. In 2006 he launched Ireland&#x27;s first professional team, the team, composed of young Irish and Belgian riders based at the Sean Kelly Cycling Academy in Merchtem, Belgium. He has a cycling clothing company which supplies clubs and companies, and which also organises corporate cycling events in Ireland and throughout Europe. He rides long-distance charity cycling tours with Blazing Saddles, a charity raising money for the blind and partially sighted. Such tours have included a journey across America by bike in 2000. He also participates in charity cycling endurance events in Scotland (notably with the Braveheart Cycling Fund), England, France and Ireland. Sean Kelly regularly cycles with SportActive cycling holidays in Mallorca.

The inaugural Sean Kelly Tour of Waterford was held on 19 August 2007. Kelly was one of the 910 participants. The second was on 24 August 2008. Kelly was one of the 2,048. The 2009 Tour went ahead on 30 August 2009. It attracted over 3,400 participants. On 29 August 2010, 3708 cyclists took part in the Tour. In 2011 the attendance ballooned to over 8,000 over the two days and events. This ran annually until 2017. In 2018, the organisers of The Sean Kelly Tour of Waterford completed a review and decided not to run the event and to look at other cycling initiatives in and around Waterford.

==Coverage==
Kelly is the subject of several books, including &quot;KELLY A Biography of Sean Kelly&quot; by David Walsh in 1986 and &quot;SEAN KELLY a man for all seasons&quot; by Sean Kelly and David Walsh in 1991.

Sean Kelly published his autobiography &quot;Hunger&quot; in 2013.

==Awards==
In December 1986, Sean Kelly won the RTÉ Sports Person of the Year Award. In December 2005, he received the Mick Doyle Golden Memory Award at the Canon Hayes National Sports Awards in Aherlow, County Tipperary. In November 2013, at Dublin City University, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Philosophy in recognition of his contribution to Irish sport. In November 2019, he received a lifetime achievement award at the Cycling Weekly Awards in London.

<text>Intermittent claudication, also known as vascular claudication, is a symptom that describes muscle pain on mild exertion (ache, cramp, numbness or sense of fatigue), classically in the calf muscle, which occurs during exercise, such as walking, and is relieved by a short period of rest. It is classically associated with early-stage peripheral artery disease, and can progress to critical limb ischemia unless treated or risk factors are modified and maintained.

Claudication derives .

==Signs and symptoms==
One of the hallmarks of arterial claudication is that it occurs intermittently. It disappears after a very brief rest and the patient can start walking again until the pain recurs.
The following signs are general signs of atherosclerosis of the lower extremity arteries:
* cyanosis
* atrophic changes like loss of hair, shiny skin
* decreased temperature
* decreased pulse
* redness when limb is returned to a &quot;dependent&quot; position (part of Buerger&#x27;s test)

The six &quot;P&quot;s of ischemia
* Pain
* Pallor (increased)
* Pulse (decreased)
* Perishing cold
* Paraesthesia
* Paralysis

==Causes==
Most commonly, intermittent (or vascular or arterial) claudication is due to peripheral arterial disease which implies significant atherosclerotic blockages resulting in arterial insufficiency. Other uncommon causes are coarctation of the aorta, Trousseau disease and Buerger&#x27;s disease (thromboangiitis obliterans), in which vasculitis occurs.

Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon functional vasospasm. It is distinct from neurogenic claudication, which is associated with lumbar spinal stenosis. It is strongly associated with smoking, hypertension, and diabetes.

==Diagnosis==
Intermittent claudication is a symptom and is by definition diagnosed by a patient reporting a history of leg pain with walking relieved by rest. However, as other conditions such as sciatica can mimic intermittent claudication, testing is often performed to confirm the diagnosis of peripheral artery disease. 

Magnetic resonance angiography and duplex ultrasonography appear to be slightly more cost-effective in diagnosing peripheral artery disease among people with intermittent claudication than projectional angiography.

==Treatment==
Exercise can improve symptoms, as can revascularization. Both together may be better than one intervention of its own. 

Supervised exercise improves maximum walking distance and pain-free walking distance more than home based exercise. Although when monitoring is included in home based exercise programmes similar changes in pain-free walking distance are observed in both supervised and home based exercise. 

In people with stable leg pain, exercise, such as strength training, pole-striding and upper or lower limb exercises, compared to usual care or placebo improves maximum walking time, pain-free walking distance and maximum walking distance. Alternative exercise modes, such as cycling, strength training and upper-arm ergometry compared to supervised walking programmes showed no difference in maximum walking distance or pain-free walking distance for people with intermittent claudication. 

Pharmacological options exist, as well. Medicines that control lipid profile, diabetes, and hypertension may increase blood flow to the affected muscles and allow for increased activity levels. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, adrenergic agents such as alpha-1 blockers and beta-blockers and alpha-2 agonists, antiplatelet agents (aspirin and clopidogrel), naftidrofuryl, pentoxifylline, and cilostazol (selective PDE3 inhibitor) are used for the treatment of intermittent claudication. However, medications will not remove the blockages from the body. Instead, they simply improve blood flow to the affected area.

Catheter-based intervention is also an option. Atherectomy, stenting, and angioplasty to remove or push aside the arterial blockages are the most common procedures for catheter-based intervention. These procedures can be performed by interventional radiologists, interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons, and thoracic surgeons, among others.

Surgery is the last resort; vascular surgeons can perform either endarterectomies on arterial blockages or perform an arterial bypass. However, open surgery poses a host of risks not present with catheter-based interventions.

==Epidemiology==
Atherosclerosis affects up to 10% of the Western population older than 65 years and for intermittent claudication this number is around 5%. Intermittent claudication most commonly manifests in men older than 50 years.

One in five of the middle-aged (65–75 years) population of the United Kingdom have evidence of peripheral arterial disease on clinical examination, although only a quarter of them have symptoms. The most common symptom is muscle pain in the lower limbs on exercise—intermittent claudication.

<text>Lesya Ukrainka (, ; born Larysa Petrivna Kosach, ; – ) was one of Ukrainian literature&#x27;s foremost writers, best known for her poems and plays. She was also an active political, civil, and feminist activist.

Among her best-known works are the collections of poems &quot;On the Wings of Songs&quot; (1893), &quot;Thoughts and Dreams&quot; (1899), &quot;Echos&quot; (1902), the epic poem &quot;Ancient Fairy Tale&quot; (1893), &quot;One Word&quot; (1903), plays &quot;Princess&quot; (1913), &quot;Cassandra&quot; (1903–1907), &quot;In the Catacombs&quot; (1905), and &quot;Forest Song&quot; (1911).

==Biography==

Lesya Ukrainka was born in 1871 in the town of Novohrad-Volynskyi (now Zviahel) of Ukraine. She was the second child of Ukrainian writer and publisher Olha Drahomanova-Kosach, better known under her pen-name Olena Pchilka. Ukrainka&#x27;s father was Petro Kosach (from the Kosača noble family), head of the district assembly of conciliators, who came from the northern part of Chernihiv province. After completing high school in Chernihiv Gymnasium, Kosach studied mathematics at the University of Petersburg. Two years later, her father moved to Saint Vladimir Imperial University of Kiev (now - Kyiv University) and graduated with a law degree. In 1868 he married Olha Drahomanova, who was the sister of his friend Mykhailo Drahomanov, a well-known Ukrainian scientist, historian, philosopher, folklorist, and public figure. Her father was devoted to the advancement of Ukrainian culture and financially supported Ukrainian publishing ventures. Lesya Ukrainka had three younger sisters, Olha, Oksana, and Isydora, and a younger brother, Mykola. Ukrainka was very close with her uncle Drahomanov, her spiritual mentor and teacher, as well as her elder brother Mykhailo, known under the pen name Mykhailo Obachny, whom she called &quot;Mysholosie&quot; after their parents&#x27; joint nickname for both of them.

Lesya inherited her father&#x27;s physical features, eyes, height, and build. Like her father, she was highly principled, and they both held the dignity of the individual in high regard. Despite their many similarities, Lesya and her father were different in that her father had a gift for mathematics, but no gift for languages; conversely, Lesya had no gift for mathematics, but she knew English, German, French, Italian, Greek, Latin, Polish, Russian, Bulgarian, and her native Ukrainian.

Lesya&#x27;s mother, a poet, wrote poetry and short stories for children in Ukrainian. She was also active in the women&#x27;s movement and published a feminist almanac. Ukrainka&#x27;s mother played a significant role in her upbringing. The Ukrainian language was the only language used in the household, and to enforce this practice, the children were educated by Ukrainian tutors at home, to avoid schools that taught Russian as the primary language. Ukrainka learned how to read at the age of four, and she and her brother Mykhailo could read foreign languages well enough to read literature in the original.

By the time she was eight, Ukrainka wrote her first poem, &quot;Hope,&quot; which was composed in reaction to the arrest and exile of her aunt, Olena Kosach, for taking part in a political movement against the tsarist autocracy. In 1879, her entire family moved to Lutsk. That same year her father started building houses for the family in the nearby village of Kolodiazhne. It was at this time that her uncle, Mykhailo Drahomanov, encouraged her to study Ukrainian folk songs, folk stories, and history, as well to peruse the Bible for its inspired poetry and eternal themes. She also was influenced by the well-known composer Mykola Lysenko, as well as the famous Ukrainian dramatist and poet Mykhailo Starytsky.

At age thirteen, her first published poem, &quot;Lily of the Valley,&quot; appeared in the magazine &quot;Zorya&quot; in Lviv. It was here that she first used her pseudonym, which was suggested by her mother because, in the Russian Empire, publications in the Ukrainian language were forbidden. Ukrainka&#x27;s first collection of poetry had to be published secretly in western Ukraine and snuck into Kyiv under her pseudonym. At this time, Ukrainka was well on her way of becoming a pianist, but due to tuberculosis of the bone, she did not attend any outside educational establishment. The writing was to be the main focus of her life.

Since the beginning of the 90s, the poet had been communicating with the Poltava region. From the summer of 1893 to the middle of 1906, Lesya lived almost every summer in Hadiach and near the city, in the Green Grove. The writing of many works is marked by this place; in particular, the legend &quot;Robert Bruce, King of Scotland&quot; was written here. It was here that Lesya befriended the teacher A. S. Makarova, with whom she later corresponded, the latter left memories of the poet.

The poems and plays of Ukrainka are associated with her belief in her country&#x27;s freedom and independence. Between 1895 and 1897, she became a member of the Literary and Artistic Society in Kyiv, which was banned in 1905 because of its relations with revolutionary activists. In 1888, when Ukrainka was seventeen, she and her brother organized a literary circle called Pleyada (The Pleiades), which they founded to promote the development of Ukrainian literature and translation of foreign classics into Ukrainian. The organization was based on the French school of poesy, the Pleiade. Their gatherings took place in different homes and were joined by Mykola Lysenko, Petro Kosach, Kostiantyn Mykhalchuk, Mykhailo Starytsky, and others. One of the works they translated was Nikolai Gogol&#x27;s &quot;Evenings on a Farm Near Dykanka&quot;.

Taras Shevchenko and Ivan Franko were the main inspiration of her early poetry, which was associated with the poet&#x27;s loneliness, social isolation and adoration of the Ukrainian nation&#x27;s freedom. Her first collection of poetry, &quot;Na krylakh pisen&quot;&#x27; (&quot;On the Wings of Songs&quot;), was published in 1893. Since Ukrainian publications were banned by the Russian Empire, this book was published in Western Ukraine, which was part of Austria-Hungary at the time, and smuggled into Kyiv.

Ukrainka&#x27;s illness made it necessary for her to travel to places where the climate was dry, and, as a result, she spent extended periods of time in Germany, Austria, Italy, Bulgaria, Crimea, the Caucasus, and Egypt. She loved experiencing other cultures, which was evident in many of her literary works, such as &quot;The Ancient History of Oriental Peoples,&quot; originally written for her younger siblings. The book was published in Lviv, and Ivan Franko was involved in its publication. It included her early poems, such as &quot;Seven Strings,&quot; &quot;The Starry Sky,&quot; &quot;Tears-Pearls,&quot; &quot;The Journey to the Sea,&quot; &quot;Crimean Memories,&quot; and &quot;In the Children&#x27;s Circle.&quot;

Ukrainka also wrote epic poems, prose dramas, prose, several articles of literary criticism, and several sociopolitical essays. She was best known for her plays &quot;Boyarynya&quot; (1914; &quot;The Noblewoman&quot;), a psychological tragedy centered on the Ukrainian family in the 17th century, which refers directly to Ukrainian history, and &quot;Lisova pisnya&quot; (1912; &quot;The Forest Song&quot;), the characters of which include mythological beings from Ukrainian folklore.

In 1897, while being treated in Yalta, Ukrainka met , an official from Minsk who was also receiving treatment for tuberculosis. The two fell in love, and her feelings for Merzhynsky were responsible for her showing a different side of herself. Examples include &quot;Your Letters Always Smell of Withered Roses,&quot; &quot;To Leave Everything and Fly to You,&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;d Like to Wind around You Like Ivy,&quot; which were unpublished in her lifetime. Miaržynski died with Ukrainka at his bedside on 3 March 1901. She wrote the entire dramatic poem &quot;Oderzhyma&quot; (&quot;The Possessed&quot;) in one night on his deathbed.

Lesya Ukrainka actively opposed Russian tsarism and was a member of Ukrainian Marxist organizations. In 1901, she gave the Austro-Marxist Mykola Hankevich a Ukrainian translation of The Communist Manifesto made by &quot;her comrades from Kyiv&quot;. She was briefly arrested in 1907 by tsarist police and remained under surveillance thereafter.

In 1907, Lesya Ukrainka married Klyment Kvitka, a court official, who was an amateur ethnographer and musicologist. They settled first in Crimea, then moved to Georgia.

Ukrainka died on 1 August 1913 at a health resort in Surami, Georgia.

=== Sexuality ===

Lesya Ukrainka&#x27;s sexuality has been described as &quot;spark[ing] debate among literary scholars for decades&quot; by author Maryna Kulakova, particularly her relationship with Olha Kobylianska. The two began corresponding through writing in 1891, and after a 1901 meeting in Chernivtsi, began writing intimate passages to one another. Lesya Ukrainka grew closer to Kobylianska after Miaržynski&#x27;s death, while Kobylianska was dealing with a rejection by Osyp Makovei, who was uninterested in marriage.

The correspondence between Lesya Ukrainka and Olha Kobylianska led the two to develop a gender-neutral language, referring to one another as &quot;someone&quot; () in order to express feelings of love. This language has been compared to Anne Lister&#x27;s diaries by professor Anna Dżabagina. Dżabagina additionally notes that the usage of this coded language was for political reasons; Lesya Ukrainka, who lived in the Russian Empire, was less likely to overtly express her sexuality than Kobylianska, who lived in Austro-Hungarian Empire. The former&#x27;s letters were nonetheless explicit in noting her desire for physical contact, and she wrote on one occasion that she

The relationship between Kobylianska and Lesya Ukrainka has been referred to as a &quot;lesbian phantasy&quot; by literary scholar Solomiya Pavlychko. Increased attention to the relationship between the two women has sparked homophobic backlash from certain sectors of Ukrainian academia, as well as what Dżabagina refers to as &quot;straightwashing&quot;. Oksana Zabuzhko, for example, has claimed that the correspondence was simply the literary conventions of the time, and that any intimate character is a result of reinterpretation by modern, &quot;unprepared&quot; readers.

== Creative activity ==
=== Poetry ===
Larysa Kosach began to write poetry at the age of nine: the poem &quot;Hope&quot; [&quot;Надія&quot;] was written under the influence of the news about the fate of her aunt Olena Antonivna Kosach (married to Teslenko-Prykhodko), who had been exiled for participating in the revolutionary movement. In 1884 the poems &quot;Lily of the Valley&quot; [&quot;Конвалія&quot;] and &quot;Sappho&quot; [&quot;Сапфо&quot;] were first published in Lviv magazine &quot;Zorya&quot;. That was the first time Larysa Kosach was published under her pen name, Lesya Ukrainka. In the following reprints, Lesya added a dedication to her brother to the poem &quot;Sappho&quot;: &quot;Dearest Shura Sudovshchikova, remember.&quot; In 1885 a collection of her translations from Mykola Gogol (made together with Mykhailo) was published in Lviv.

Lesya Ukrainka&#x27;s literary activity revived in the mid-1890s, when the Kosachs moved to Kyiv, and she became a co-founder of the Pleiades literary circle, surrounded by the Lysenko and Starytsky families. At the request of the Pleiades, in 1889 she compiled her famous List of World Literature for translation. In 1892, Heinrich Heine&#x27;s Book of Songs was published in Lviv, translated by Lesya Ukrainka (together with M. Slavinsky). The first collection of her original poems &quot;On the Wings of Songs&quot; appeared in Lviv (1893), the second edition in Kyiv (1904), the second collection &quot;Thoughts and Dreams&quot; (1899), the third &quot;Reviews&quot; (1902) – in Chernivtsi.

After that, Lesya Ukrainka worked for a decade and created more than a hundred poems, half of which were never published during her lifetime.

Lesya Ukrainka entered the canon of Ukrainian literature primarily as a poet of courage and struggle. Her thematically rich lyrics are somewhat conditionally (due to the relationship of motives) divided into personal, landscape, and civic. The main themes of her early lyrical poetry: the beauty of nature, love for her native land, personal experiences, the purpose of the poet and the role of the poetic word, social and social motives. In the first works the influences of Taras Shevchenko, Panteleimon Kulish, Mykhailo Starytsky, and Heine are noticeable, the clear influences of Olena Pchilka and Mykhailo Drahomanov (pseudonym – Ukrainian) on the choice of motives are visible.

And the poetry &quot;Contra spem spero!&quot; (1890) characterizes the ancient understanding of valor (arete), brilliant mastery of mythological illusions, self-creation of a woman warrior. It is this aspect of creativity for many years determinate in the tone of scientific &quot;forestry&quot;. These are the main motives of the poems &quot;To Comrades&quot;, &quot;Comrades in Memory&quot;, &quot;Sinner&quot;, &quot;Slavus – Sclavus&quot;, &quot;Fiat nox&quot;, &quot;Epilogue&quot; and many others. The motif of freedom takes on a variety of colors: from disobedience to the traditional understanding of the empire to the individual choice of modus vivendi, which means discovering the truth and serving it. Betrayal on any level is identified with tragedy, with the act of Medea. The lyrics of thirst and hidden triumph associated with the inability to realize their love, exposes the scheme of chivalrous love. The lyrical heroine is a knight who sings to her lady of the heart. The eroticism of such poems as &quot;I would like to embrace you like an ivy&quot;, &quot;Your letters always smell of withered roses&quot; are mystical praises in honor of the divine mistress.

=== Drama ===
In the second half of the 1890s, Kosach turned to drama. Her first drama, &quot;The Blue Rose&quot; (1896), from the life of the Ukrainian intelligentsia, expands on the theme of Ukrainian drama, which until then had portrayed mostly the peasantry. The drama testified to Lesya Ukrainka&#x27;s entry into the modern world — first of all, the world of the symbol — and her rather free &quot;feeling.&quot; To cover the topic of human norm and abnormality, the writer thoroughly prepared and studied the issues, consulted with a psychiatrist Oleksandr Drahomanov. The philosophical discourse of drama, imposing on Hauptmann&#x27;s work, presents not only madness as a form of freedom, but also a certain longing for the body.

=== Prose ===
Fiction has a special place in Lesya Ukrainka&#x27;s literary heritage. The first stories from rural life (&quot;Such is her fate&quot;, &quot;Holy evening!&quot;, &quot;Spring songs&quot;) are connected in content and language with folk songs. In the genre of fairy tales written &quot;Three Pearls&quot;, &quot;Four tales of green noise&quot;, &quot;Lily&quot;, &quot;Trouble will teach&quot;, &quot;Butterfly&quot;. The stories &quot;Pity&quot; and &quot;Friendship&quot; are marked by sharp drama. The Ukrainian woman&#x27;s death story &quot;Ekbal Hanem&quot;, intended to depict the psychology of an Arab woman, remained unfinished.

== Legacy ==
There are many monuments to Lesya Ukrainka in Ukraine and many other former Soviet Republics. Particularly in Kyiv, there is a main monument at the boulevard that bears her name and a smaller monument in the Mariinskyi Park (next to Mariinskyi Palace). There is also a bust in Qaradağ raion of Azerbaijan. One of the main Kyiv theaters, the Lesya Ukrainka National Academic Theater is colloquially referred to simply as &quot;Lesya Ukrainka Theater&quot;.

Under initiatives of local Ukrainian diasporas, there are several memorial societies and monuments to her throughout Canada and the United States, most notably a monument on the campus of the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. There is also a bust of Ukrainka in Soyuzivka in New York State.

Each summer since 1975, Ukrainians in Toronto gather at the Lesya Ukrainka monument in High Park to celebrate her life and work.

A monument to Lesya Ukrainka stands in the Ukrainian Section of the Cleveland Cultural Gardens, erected under the auspices of the United Ukrainian Organizations and the Ukrainian community. The statue was designed by Mykhailo Chereshniovsky (1911- 94) and was commissioned by the Ukrainian National Women’s League of North America on the initiative of Mykhailyna Stawnycha, president of the UNWLA Branch 33 in Cleveland (and by the leadership of Kateryna Mural of Branch 30, who continuously headed the monument committee).The statue was unveiled on September 2, 1961 in the presence of the sister of Lesya Ukrainka, Isydora Kosach-Borysova.

Ukrainian composers Tamara Maliukova Sidorenko (1919–2005) and Yudif Grigorevna Rozhavskaya (1923–1982) set several of Ukrainka&#x27;s poems to music.

The National Bank of Ukraine released a ₴200 banknote depicting Lesya Ukrainka.

According to image consultant Oleh Pokalchuk, Ukrainka&#x27;s hairstyle inspired the over-the-head braid of Yulia Tymoshenko.

According to Google Trends, Lesya Ukrainka was in 2020 the third in the ranking of Ukrainian women search queries in Google Search in Ukraine (the top two was Tina Karol and Olya Polyakova).

On 16 November 2022 Pushkin Avenue in Dnipro was renamed Lesya Ukrainka Avenue.

<text>Book of the Civilized Man (, also known as Liber Urbani, Urbanus Magnus, or Civilized Man), by Daniel of Beccles, is believed to be the first English courtesy book (or book of manners), dating probably from the beginning of the 13th century. The book is significant because in the later Middle Ages dozens of such courtesy books were produced. Because this appears to be the first in English history, it represented a new awakening to etiquette and decorum in English court society, which occurred in the 13th century. As a general rule, a book of etiquette is a mark of a dynamic rather than a stable society, one in which there is an influx of &quot;new&quot; men, who have not been indoctrinated with the correct decorum from an early age and who are avid to catch up in a hurry.

==The poem==
&quot;Civilized Man&quot; is a 3000-line Latin verse poem that gives proper advice on a wide range of social situations that the typical medieval person might have encountered in day-to-day life.

Examples include:
*If you wish to belch, remember to look up to the ceiling.
*Do not attack your enemy while he is squatting to defecate.
*If there is something you do not want people to know, do not tell it to your wife.
*Say thank you to your host.
*Don&#x27;t mount your horse in the hall.
*If visitors had already eaten, give them drink anyway.
*Loosen your reins when riding over a bridge.
*Receive gifts from great men with gratitude.
*If you are a judge, be just.
*Eating at the table of the rich, speak little.
*The book ends with &quot;Old King Henry first gave to the uncourtly the teaching written in this book.&quot;

==The poet==
Historians believe that Daniel of Beccles may have been a member of Henry II&#x27;s court. John Bale (16th century) wrote that he had seen a document showing Daniel in Henry&#x27;s court for over 30 years. This, the fact that a Henry is mentioned in the text, and some of the manuscripts can be dated to the early 13th century, make it very probable the poem dates from that period. There a reference to a Daniel of Beccles in the &quot;Seventh Regnal Year of King John&quot; (circa 1206) secretly being given the patronage (advowson) of the church of Endgate in Beccles by the Abbot of Bury St Edmund&#x27;s.

==Three themes==
There are three major recurrent themes in the poem: social hierarchy, self-control and sexual morality.

The first theme is the emphasis on social hierarchy and how to behave around those of higher or lower status (lords and servants). The poem takes the general tone of addressing the reader as someone who is a &quot;householder&quot;. This can be seen in the opening lines of the poem &quot;Reader, if you wish to be adorned with good manners, if you wish to be respected and lead a civilized life as a noble householder...&quot;. In other words, it addresses a very minor upper percentage of the general population who own households and have servants, the class that from the 16th century might be identified as &quot;country gentry&quot;.

The second recurrent theme is self-control, in general holding oneself inward when it comes to speaking, eating and bodily emissions. When it comes to speaking, &quot;Be careful to whom, what, why and when you speak&quot;. He suggests it is better to keep your thoughts to yourself. When it comes to eating, he suggests small bites, not overeating, not playing with food, no using fingers to clean bowls. Also, guests and servants should not urinate in the dining hall, but the host may.

The third recurrent theme is sexual morality. The &quot;Civilized Man&quot; was clearly written for men. It offers advice on prostitutes: &quot;If you are overcome with erotic desire when you are young and your penis drives you to go to a prostitute, do not go to a common whore; empty your testicles quickly and depart quickly.&quot; He offers advice on how to pick a wife, which includes looking at her property value and personal traits. Following a tradition inherited from antiquity, Daniel describes women as lustful and untrustworthy. The poem describes a woman lying in bed with her husband, with her thoughts on to her secret lover: &quot;The lascivious woman throws herself around the neck of her lover, her fingers give him those secret touches that she denies to her husband in bed; one wicked act with her lover pleases the lascivious adulteress more than a hundred with her husband; women&#x27;s minds always burn for the forbidden.&quot; He says she is always ready to fornicate &quot;with a cook or a half-wit, a peasant or a ploughman, or a chaplain... what she longs for is a thick, leaping, robust piece of equipment, long, smooth and stiff... such are the things that charm and delight women&quot;. Despite this he says &quot;Whatever your wife does, do not damage your marriage&quot; and he goes on to say &quot;if you are jealous, do not whisper a word about it... when you are jealous, learn to look up at the ceiling.&quot; The message is clearly in the same theme of holding inward and avoiding any embarrassments at all cost.

Daniel&#x27;s advice comes to a climax in what is perhaps the most difficult situation of all: the wife of one&#x27;s lord makes a sexual proposition. It is a combination of the three problems: hierarchical relationships, control of bodily emissions, and sexual morality. Daniel&#x27;s solution is to pretend to be ill.

<doc id="1298502" wikidata="Q311046" url="?curid=1298502" title="Aron Winter">
<text>Aron Winter (born 1 March 1967) is a Dutch football manager and former player who most recently managed Suriname. A midfielder, he played for Ajax and Sparta Rotterdam in the Netherlands, and for Italian sides Lazio and Inter Milan. Born in Suriname, he played for the Netherlands national team.

==Club career==

===Ajax===
Winter began his career with amateur club VV Unicum in Lelystad, moved on to SV Lelystad, and the same year joined Ajax at the age of 19. His first game for Ajax was a match against FC Utrecht on 6 April 1986, which Ajax won 3–0. Winter won two KNVB Cups (1987 and 1988), the Eredivisie title (1990), the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup (1987) and the UEFA Cup (1992).

===Lazio===
In 1992, he moved to the Roman team Lazio, playing his first match against Sampdoria on 6 September, which Lazio tied 3–3.

===Inter Milan===
In 1996, Winter joined Inter Milan, with whom he won the UEFA Cup in 1998. He had also played in the previous year&#x27;s final, with the game going to penalties. However, Winter missed his penalty as Inter lost to Schalke.

===Ajax return and Sparta Rotterdam loan===
Winter left Inter for his former club Ajax in 1999. In 2001, he was loaned out to Sparta Rotterdam. He played 32 games for Sparta Rotterdam and scored one goal before returning to Ajax to finish his career, and where he chose to retire in 2003.

==International career==
Winter was a member of the Netherlands national team that won the 1988 European Football Championship, but made no appearances during the final tournament.

He played in 1990 Italy World Cup where the Netherlands lost in 1/8 finals game against Germany. In the 1994 FIFA World Cup, he scored a goal against Brazil in the quarter-finals, making him the only player of Indian descent ever to score in a World Cup.

He was also selected for the Netherlands national team for Euro 96, as well as the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France.

Winter placed in Rijkaard&#x27;s Euro 2000 squad.

Having represented his national team 84 times, scoring 6 goals, Winter is currently the twelfth most capped player for the Netherlands national team.

==Style of play==
Normally a central or holding midfielder, Winter was a hard-working and physical, yet elegant and classy team player of both quantity and quality. Owing to his development in the Ajax youth system, which was heavily influenced by the Dutch &quot;total football&quot; tactical philosophy, Winter was a versatile and well–rounded midfielder, who was capable of assisting his team both defensively and offensively, as well as creatively, courtesy of his physical, technical, and tactical qualities. Among his range of skills, he possessed significant stamina, acceleration, physicality, a good positional sense, intelligence, vision, passing, technique, and excellent striking ability from distance, as well as an ability to make late runs into the penalty box. Beyond his playing ability, he was known for his strong character, personality, consistency, composed playing style, correct behaviour, and leadership qualities, which made him a respected figure among his clubs&#x27; fans and teammates. In Italy, his best role was considered to be that of a left–sided central, offensive–minded box-to-box midfielder, known as the &quot;mezzala&quot; role in Italian football jargon, although he was also capable of playing on the right in a three–player midfield in a 4–3–3, a role in which he was often used during his time at Lazio. He would often start matches out wide before moving into the centre of the pitch. Moreover, he was also deployed on either the right or left flank, as a wide midfielder, wing-back, or full-back, in particular during his time with Inter; however these were not his favoured positions, and Italian pundits did not consider him to be as well–suited to these roles due to his less convincing performances. Winter was also occasionally used to great effect as a centre-back under manager Guus Hiddink with the Netherlands national team, with Elko Born of &quot;Bleacher Report&quot; even ranking him as the eight–best Dutch central defender of all time in 2014.

==Managerial career==
After three years as assistant coach for the Ajax first academy team, Winter signed a three-year contract with Canadian side Toronto FC on 6 January 2011. Winter brought former colleague Bob de Klerk from Ajax to be his assistant coach, while Paul Mariner was also brought in the same day as Director of Player Development. After a disappointing season opener against Vancouver Whitecaps that ended in a 4–2 away defeat on 19 March, Winter won his first game as Toronto&#x27;s head coach the following week against Portland Timbers 2–0 in Toronto.

Winter won his first trophy with Toronto in early July as Toronto defeated Vancouver 3–2 on aggregate to capture its third consecutive Canadian Championship, thereby earning a berth in the 2011–12 CONCACAF Champions League. Winter then guided Toronto to the Champions League semifinals, the first time a Canadian club had progressed that far in the competition. Toronto eventually lost 7–3 on aggregate to Santos Laguna.

However, Toronto began the 2012 MLS season with nine straight losses, the worst start to a season in the history of the MLS. Toronto won its tenth match 1–0 versus Philadelphia on 26 May 2012, but it was not enough to save Winter&#x27;s job, as the club announced on 7 June 2012 that he would be replaced by the director of player development, Paul Mariner.

On 6 September 2022, Winter was announced as the interim coach for Suriname. Winter succeeds Stanley Menzo, who was at the helm of the team for seven months before leaving to work at Beijing Guoan. Winter is set to coach Natio in a friendly against Nicaragua and a potential second opponent.

==Personal life==
Winter was born in Paramaribo, Suriname. His cousin Ricardo Winter was also a former football player/manager who headed the Suriname national football team.

<doc id="1298503" wikidata="Q2889700" url="?curid=1298503" title="Battle of Pozières">
<text>The Battle of Pozières (23 July – 3 September 1916) took place in northern France around the village of Pozières, during the Battle of the Somme. The costly fighting ended with the British in possession of the plateau north and east of the village, in a position to menace the German bastion of Thiepval from the rear. The Australian official historian Charles Bean wrote that Pozières ridge &quot;is more densely sown with Australian sacrifice than any other place on earth&quot;.

== Prelude ==
The village of Pozières, on the Albert–Bapaume road, lies atop a ridge approximately in the centre of what was the British sector of the Somme battlefield. Close by the village is the highest point on the battlefield. Pozières was an important German defensive position; the fortified village was an outpost to the second defensive trench system, which had become known to the British as the O.G. (Old German) lines. This German second line extended from beyond Mouquet Farm in the north, ran behind Pozières to the east, then south towards the Bazentin ridge and the villages of Bazentin le Petit and Longueval. On 14 July, during the Battle of Bazentin Ridge, this southern section of the German second line was captured by the British Fourth Army of Lieutenant General Sir Henry Rawlinson. The possibility of &quot;rolling up&quot; the German second line by turning north now presented itself if Pozières could be captured.

The British Commander-in-Chief, General Sir Douglas Haig, lacked the artillery ammunition immediately to execute another broad-front attack after 14 July. Believing that Pozières and Thiepval would become untenable for the Germans as the British continued their eastward advance, Haig ordered Rawlinson to concentrate on the centre between High Wood and Delville Wood as well as the villages of Guillemont and Ginchy. The plan was to maintain the pressure and take Pozières by a &quot;steady, methodical, step-by-step advance&quot;. Between 13 and 17 July, the Fourth Army made four small attacks against Pozières which were costly failures. In this period the village was subjected to a heavy bombardment and was reduced to rubble. On two occasions the attacking infantry got into the trench that looped around the south and western edge of the village, known as &quot;Pozières trench&quot; but were driven out both times. Attempts to get east of the village by advancing up the O.G. Lines also failed.

== Battle ==

=== Capture of Pozières ===

Rawlinson planned to deliver another attack on a broad front on 18 July, involving six divisions between the Albert–Bapaume road in the north and Guillemont in the south. Haig decided to transfer responsibility for Pozières to the Reserve Army of Lieutenant General Hubert Gough which had been holding the line north of the road since shortly after the opening of the offensive on 1 July. The attack was postponed until the night of To Gough&#x27;s army were attached the three Australian divisions of I Anzac Corps, which had begun moving from the Armentières sector. The Australian 1st Division reached Albert on 18 July and despite the postponement of the offensive, Gough, who had a reputation as a &quot;thruster&quot;, told the division&#x27;s commander, Major General Harold Walker, &quot;I want you to go in and attack Pozières tomorrow night&quot;. Walker, an experienced English officer who had led the division since Gallipoli, would have none of it and insisted he would attack only after adequate preparation. Consequently, the attack on Pozières once more fell in line with the Fourth Army&#x27;s attack on the night of 

The plan called for the Australian 1st Division to attack Pozières from the south, advancing in three stages half an hour apart, while north of the Albert–Bapaume road, the 48th (South Midland) Division (X Corps), would attack the German trenches west of the village. The village and surrounding area was defended by elements of the 117th Division. Early on 22 July the Australian 9th Battalion attempted to improve its position by advancing up the O.G. Lines towards the road but was repulsed. The preparation for the attack involved a thorough bombardment of the village and the O.G. Lines lasting several days. The bombardment included phosgene and tear gas. The infantry were scheduled to attack at on 23 July, with the Australian 1st and 3rd Brigades. The infantry crept into no man&#x27;s land, close behind the bombardment and when it lifted the German trenches were rushed. The first stage took the Pozières trench that ringed the village to the south.

The second stage saw the Australians advance to the edge of the village, amongst what remained of the back gardens of the houses lining the Albert–Bapaume road. The third stage brought the line to the Albert–Bapaume road. The few survivors from the German garrison retreated to the northern edge of the village or into the O.G. Lines to the east. It was also intended that the O.G. Lines would be captured as far as the road but here the Australians failed, partly due to strong resistance from the German defenders in deep dugouts and machine gun nests and partly due to the confusion of a night attack on featureless terrain. The weeks of bombardment had reduced the ridge to a field of craters and it was virtually impossible to distinguish where a trench line had run. The failure to take the O.G. Lines made the eastern end of Pozières vulnerable and so the Australians formed a flank short of their objectives. On the western edge of the village, the Australians captured a German bunker known as &quot;Gibraltar&quot;. During 23 July, some Australians went prospecting across the road, captured a number of Germans and with minimal effort occupied more of the village. That night the 8th Battalion of the Australian 2nd Brigade, which had been in reserve, moved up and secured the rest of the village. The attack of the 48th Division on the German trenches west of Pozières achieved some success but the main attack by the Fourth Army between Pozières and Guillemont was a costly failure.

=== Defence of Pozières ===
Success on the Somme came at a cost which at times seemed to surpass the cost of failure, and for the Australians, Pozières was such a case. As a consequence of being the sole British gain on 23 July, Pozières became a focus of attention for the Germans. As a critical element of their defensive system, the German command ordered that it be retaken at all costs. Three attempts were made on 23 July but each was broken up by the British artillery or swept away by machine gun fire. Communication was as difficult for the Germans as it was for the British, and it was not until 24 July that they discovered that Pozières had been captured. With British activity now declining elsewhere on its front, the German IV Corps opposite Pozières, was able to concentrate most of its artillery against the village and its approaches. Initially the bombardment was methodical and relentless. The western approach to the village, which led from Casualty Corner near the head of Sausage Valley, received such a concentration of shellfire that it was thereafter known as &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Road&quot;. The German bombardment intensified on 25 July, in preparation for another counter-attack.

The German IX Corps relieved IV Corps and the commander cancelled the planned counter-attack, choosing to concentrate on the defence of the O.G. Lines, which were the next objective of the British. The bombardment reached a climax on 26 July and by the Australians, believing an attack was imminent, appealed for a counter-barrage. The artillery of I Anzac Corps, II Corps and the guns of the two neighbouring British corps replied. This in turn led the Germans to believe the Australians were preparing to attack and so they increased their fire yet again. It was not until midnight that the shelling subsided. At its peak, the German bombardment of Pozières was the equal of anything yet experienced on the Western Front and far surpassed the worst shelling previously endured by an Australian division. The Australian 1st Division suffered on its first tour of Pozières. When the survivors were relieved on 27 July, one observer said

=== The O.G. Lines ===
On 24 July, once Pozières had been secured, General Gough pushed for immediate moves against the O.G. Lines (Old German Lines) north and east of the village. The first task was to capture the lines up to the Albert–Bapaume road; the original objectives which had not been captured. Attacking in the dark, only the Australian 5th Battalion found either of the O.G. trenches and it was counter-attacked by the German 18th Reserve Division. Simultaneously on the Australian&#x27;s right, the British 1st Division made an attempt to capture Munster Alley, the section of the Switch Line where it intersected the O.G. Lines. A bomb fight developed but only a small section of trench was held.

Before it was withdrawn, the 1st Australian Division had attempted to prepare a jumping-off line for the assault on the O.G. Lines. The 2nd Australian Division took over the sector on 27 July and General Gough, eager for progress, pressed for an immediate attack. The division&#x27;s commander, General Gordon Legge, lacked the experience and confidence of Walker and succumbed to pressure from Gough. On the night of in conditions far less favourable than those experienced by the 1st Division on the night of the 2nd Division was expected to attack. The remorseless German bombardment made preparation virtually impossible. The dust raised by the shelling prevented the Australian artillery observers from directing their field guns on wire cutting. An attack by the 23rd Division on Munster Alley dragged in the 5th Australian Brigade and the bomb fight saw the British and Australian infantry expend over The main attack went ahead, scheduled to start at on 29 July but the 7th Australian Brigade was late in reaching its start line and its movement was detected by the German defenders; when the attack commenced, the Australians were met by a hail of machine gun fire. South of the road the 5th Brigade remained pinned down, unable to even get started. On their left, north of the road, the 7th Brigade encountered uncut wire. On the northern flank some minor progress was made by the 6th Brigade but everywhere else the attack was a failure. Including the attack and the preceding day of preparation the 2nd Division lost over the 7th Brigade had to be withdrawn to reserve, so great were its losses.

General Haig was disparaging of the division&#x27;s failure, telling Lieutenant General William Birdwood, the I Anzac Corps commander, &quot;You&#x27;re not fighting Bashi-Bazouks now&quot;. Legge and the I Anzac staff resolved to do the job properly. To avoid the confusion of a night advance, the plan was to attack at just before dark at which time the crest of the ridge and the mound of the Pozières windmill would still be discernible. A dusk attack meant assembling by day which was only possible in the protection of trenches. A system of approach and assembly trenches had to be dug at night. Whenever the Germans detected digging parties, they mistook them for troops assembling to attack and called down a barrage. Originally the attack was to be made at dusk on 2 August but the trenches were as yet incomplete, the digging either being disrupted or the completed trenches demolished by shellfire. The attack was first postponed to 3 August and then to 4 August when the trenches were finally deemed ready. This careful planning and preparation delivered success and both O.G. Lines were captured. South of and astride the Albert–Bapaume Road the O.G. Lines had been so thoroughly obliterated by shelling that the Australians ended up advancing beyond their objectives. From their vantage in the O.G. Lines on the eastern edge of the Pozières ridge, the Australians now looked over green countryside, the village of Courcelette close by and the woods around Bapaume distant. The German commander ordered &quot;At any price Hill 160 Pozières ridge must be recovered&quot;.

=== Final counter-attack ===
By 5 August the 2nd Australian Division was exhausted and were to be relieved by the 4th Australian Division. While the relief was underway on the night of the Australians were subjected to an extreme bombardment, because the salient they occupied could be shelled by the Germans from all directions, including from Thiepval which lay to the rear. On the morning of 6 August, a German counter-attack tried to approach the O.G. Lines but was met by machine gun fire and forced to dig in. The bombardment continued through the day, by the end of which most of the 2nd Division had been relieved. From its twelve days in the line, the division had suffered At on 7 August, shortly before dawn, the Germans launched their final counter-attack. On a front of they overran the thinly occupied O.G. Lines, catching most of the Australians in shelters in the old German dugouts and advanced towards Pozières. For the Australians, the crisis had arrived. At this moment, Lieutenant Albert Jacka, who had won the Victoria Cross at Gallipoli, emerged from a dugout where he and seven men of his platoon had been isolated and charged the German line from the rear. His example inspired other Australians scattered across the plateau to join the action and a fierce, hand-to-hand fight developed. Jacka was badly wounded but as support arrived from the flanks, the Australians gained the advantage and most of the surviving Germans were captured. No more attempts to retake Pozières were made.

== Aftermath ==

===Analysis===
Since taking over the Pozières sector, Gough had planned to drive a wedge behind (east of) the German fortress of Thiepval. Having secured Pozières and the neighbouring section of the O.G. Lines, the Reserve Army attacked northwards along the ridge towards the German strong point of Mouquet Farm which protected the rear of Thiepval. I Anzac Corps would carry the advance along the ridge and II Corps would keep in line on the left, systematically reducing the Thiepval salient. Initially the task fell to the 4th Australian Division, which had already suffered 1,000 casualties resisting the final German counter-attack. When the Australian ordeal on Pozières ridge was over in September, they were replaced by the Canadian Corps who held the sector for the remainder of the battle. The O.G. Lines east of the village became the Canadian start line for the Battle of Flers–Courcelette.

After the battle it became apparent that General Birdwood had lost much of his Gallipoli popularity through his failure to oppose Gough&#x27;s impetuous desire for &quot;quick results&quot; and his &quot;lack of thought&quot; at Pozières. Soon after, Australian troops rejected his appeal to vote in favour in the 1916 Australian conscription referendum largely because of their reluctance to see additional men subjected to the horrors of piecemeal attacks. The Australians had suffered as many casualties in the Battle of Pozières in six weeks as they had in eight months during the Gallipoli campaign. Wilfrid Miles, the official historian, praised the initiative shown by small units of men in clearing the Germans from positions in the village but attributed much of the casualties to Australian inexperience and their &quot;reckless daring&quot;.

===Casualties===

<text>Lugano Airport is a regional airport located west of the Swiss city of Lugano, approximately north of Milan, in the municipalities of Agno, Bioggio and Muzzano. It lies closer to the village of Agno than to Lugano itself, and is sometimes known as Lugano-Agno. Around 200,000 passengers use the airport each year, using some 2,400 flights. There are also limited freight operations, a flying club and flight school. The headquarters of Darwin Airline were located at the airport prior to its bankruptcy.

The airport is situated on land owned by the city of Lugano, whilst management is the responsibility of Lugano Airport SA, whose shares are owned by the canton of Ticino (12.5%) and the city (87.5%). The company has 73 employees, and an annual turnover of 10 million Swiss francs.

==History==
The current location of the airport dates back to 1938, when it opened as a grass field. The first paved runway was laid in 1960, and originally had a length of and a width of . Initially managed by private sector companies, the airport was taken over by the Azienda comunale dei trasporti della Città di Lugano, Lugano&#x27;s municipal transport company, in 1974.

In the early 1980s, the airline Crossair decided to invest in the airport, establishing connections between Lugano and various European cities. In 1985, the runway was extended by , and in 1989 a new control tower became operational.

After the demise of Adria Airways in September 2019, which operated the route to Zürich Airport on behalf of Swiss International Air Lines, Lugano lost its sole year-round scheduled service as Swiss will refer its passengers to train services in the future without resuming the flights.

In April 2020, the company behind the airport serving Lugano, Switzerland opted to put itself into liquidation after the COVID-19 pandemic destroyed air traffic at the location.

==Facilities==
===Terminal===
The airport has a single passenger terminal building, with airline ticket and check-in desks, airport security and customs facilities. There is an air side departure lounge with duty-free shop, bar and snack bar. Boarding of aircraft is generally on foot across the apron, although sometimes buses are used when the aircraft is not parked directly next to the terminal building.

An adjacent building to the terminal building houses the ground side airport restaurant and flying club, with outdoor seating under an awning between the two buildings. Other ground side catering and shopping outlets are situated around an adjacent open courtyard.

===Runway===
The airport has a single, bidirectional runway with an asphalt surface, identified as 01/19. The runway is long, wide, and above mean sea level. There is no parallel taxiway, and aircraft arrivals and departures often involve backtracking on the runway.

The airport&#x27;s instrument approach procedure is quite challenging because of its steep angle of descent of 6.65°, more than double the standard approach angle of 3° and steeper than London City&#x27;s 5.5°. This is due to its geographic location in the mouth of a valley.

==Airlines and destinations==

The following airline offers seasonal flights at Lugano Airport:

==Statistics==
==Ground transportation==
===Road===
The airport is some from Lugano city centre by road, and a similar distance from the nearest junctions on the A2 motorway. It has both long and short term parking, a taxi rank, and a selection of car hire companies.

===Train===
A shuttle bus connects the airport with Lugano railway station and city centre, meeting most scheduled flights. Agno railway station is a sign-posted ten-minute walk from the airport, and trains connect to Lugano and Ponte Tresa every 15 minutes on weekdays or 30 minutes at weekends.

<doc id="1298531" wikidata="Q908860" url="?curid=1298531" title="Hacilar">
<text>Hacilar is an early human settlement in southwestern Turkey, 23 km south of present-day Burdur. It has been dated back 7040 BC at its earliest stage of development. Archaeological remains indicate that the site was abandoned and reoccupied on more than one occasion in its history.

== Archaeological History ==

Hacilar lived and died in prehistory. What remained of Hacilar became a mound on the plain and remained so until 1956. It was in this year that a local teacher showed the mound to British archaeologist James Mellaart. In 1957 the excavation of Hacilar began under Mellaart&#x27;s direction and continued until 1960. The artifacts recovered during this excavation are currently on display at the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations in Ankara.

Ceramics from Hacilar show similarities with those of the Halaf culture from about the same period. There are also similarities in their figurines.

=== Stratigraphy ===
Up to 11 stratigraphic levels have been identified. The oldest strata belong to aceramic Neolithic, and are dated to the 8th millennium BC.

To the 6th millennium BC, nine levels are assigned, the oldest with ceramics, that were almost entirely undecorated.

Level VI is dating back to 5600 BC, and there were many activities at this time. Nine buildings were found, grouped around a square. Livelihood mainly consisted of agriculture. Spelt, wheat, barley, peas and vetch were cultivated. Villagers engaged in the breeding of animals; bones of cattle, pigs, sheep, goats and dogs were found. The pottery is simple, although some specimens represent animals.

Numerous nude female figures, made of clay, are quite remarkable, and possibly represent some divinity.

At level II (c. 5300 BC), the village was fortified and had a small temple.

The settlement of level I, dating after 5000 BC, differs significantly from the previous layers, so it is believed that there were newcomers who settled here. The site is now heavily fortified. The pottery is of high quality and is generally painted in red on a cream background.

== Architecture ==
Housing in Hacilar consisted of grouped units surrounding an inner courtyard. Each dwelling was built on a foundation of stone to protect against water damage. Walls were made of wood and daub or mud-brick that was mortared with lime. Wooden poles were located within each unit to support a flat roof. It is generally believed that these houses had an upper story made of wood.

The interiors were finished smooth with plaster and were rarely painted. Over time changes were made to the housing units; Querns, braziers and mortars appeared in the floors. Recesses in walls were also put to good use as cupboards. The kitchen was separated from the living rooms and the upper levels were used for granaries and/or workshops.

As Mellaart describes: &#x27;The walls and floors were carefully plastered, laid on a pebble base. The plaster was frequently stained red and burnished or decorated with elementary geometric designs in red on cream.&#x27; In Hacilar houses no doorways were found. It seems possible that the entry was from the roof only.

<doc id="1298534" wikidata="Q17577" url="?curid=1298534" title="Joseph Gallieni">
<text>Joseph Simon Gallieni (24 April 1849 – 27 May 1916) was a French military officer, active for most of his career as a military commander and administrator in the French colonies where he wrote several books on colonial affairs.

He was recalled from retirement at the beginning of the First World War. As Military Governor of Paris he played an important role in the First Battle of the Marne, when Maunoury&#x27;s Sixth Army, which was under his command, attacked the German west flank. A small portion of its strength was rushed to the front in commandeered Paris taxicabs.

From October 1915 he served as Minister of War, resigning from that post in March 1916 after criticizing the performance of the French Commander-in-Chief, Joseph Joffre (formerly his subordinate, earlier in their careers), during the German attack on Verdun. He died later that year and was made Marshal of France posthumously in 1921.

== Early life and career ==

Gallieni was born in 1849 at Saint-Béat, in the department of Haute-Garonne, in the central Pyrenees. He was of Corsican and Italian descent. His father, born in Pogliano Milanese, had risen from the ranks to be a captain.

As a student, he was educated, hard-working, and studious at the Prytanée Militaire in La Flèche, and then the École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr. He was also gifted and outstanding in mathematics and languages. He later became a second lieutenant in the 3rd Marine Infantry Regiment before serving in the Franco-Prussian War.

Gallieni fought at Sedan and was taken prisoner at Bazeilles, scene of the stand of the colonial marines. He learned German while a prisoner there, and later kept a notebook in German, English and Italian called &quot;Erinnerungen of my life di ragazzo&quot; (&quot;Memories of my life from boyhood [onwards]&quot;).

== Colonial Service ==
He was promoted to lieutenant in 1873. His colonial career began in 1876 in Senegal. He was promoted to captain in 1878. He led an expedition to the upper Niger. He also served in Reunion and Martinique. In 1886, he had risen to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and was later appointed governor of the French Sudan, during which time he successfully quelled a rebellion by Sudanese insurgents under Mahmadu Lamine. He was outstanding at colonial penetration without open hostilities in West Africa in 1880 and 1886–8.

In 1888 he was appointed to the War College. In 1892-6 he served as a colonel in French Indochina commanding the second military division of the territory in Tonkin. In 1894 he led successful French action against the nationalist leader Đề Thám, but further military action was overruled by colonial administrators after Đề Thám was accorded a local fiefdom.

In 1896 he was promoted to General and made Governor of Madagascar, then a new French possession. He stayed in Madagascar with one brief interruption until 1905; his future commander Joseph Joffre served under him there. In August 1896 Gallieni reorganised French forces, captured and executed several rebel leaders. Early in 1897 he abolished the Malagasy monarchy and exiled Queen Ranavalona III to Reunion. Gallieni practised the &quot;tache d’huile&quot; (the &quot;oil spot&quot; method, which continues to influence counterinsurgency theory to this day) and &quot;politique des races&quot; (literally, racial policy; i.e., eliminating the racial hierarchy that had prevailed and suppressing tribes that resisted French rule). Initially military, his role became more administrative, building roads, a railway, markets, medical services and schools.

In 1905 Gallieni defended the &quot;code de l’indigenat&quot; (the right of French officials to mete out summary punishment, including corporal punishment and confiscation of property, to individuals and to entire villages), as it administered punishment more arbitrarily and swiftly than would be possible under due legal process.

== Return to France ==
In 1905 Gallieni was appointed Military Governor of Lyon and commandant of the Army of the Alps (XIV Corps). Also in 1906 he became a member of the &quot;Conseil Superieur de la Guerre&quot; (the Superior War Council, a body of senior generals chaired by the President).

General Victor-Constant Michel (&quot;Generalissimo&quot;, i.e. Commander-in-Chief designate of the northeast front, and vice-president of the Superior War Council), was critical of the tactical doctrine of &quot;offensive à outrance&quot; (taking the offense to the limit). He also wanted to thrust into Belgium in the event of war, and to increase the size of the army by attaching a regiment of reservists to each regular regiment to form demi-brigades. Along with Yvon Dubail and Pol Durand, Gallieni was one of those who told War Minister Messimy that Michel must be removed.

Following Michel&#x27;s removal Gallieni, who was the preferred choice of Prime Minister Caillaux, declined the job of Army Chief of Staff. This was partly because of scruples after having forced Michel out, partly because of age—he was two and a half years away from retirement—and partly because the Metropolitan Army might resent a colonial soldier getting the job (&quot;une question de bouton&quot;). His former subordinate Joffre was appointed instead.

== Pre-World War I ==
Gallieni commanded Fifth Army until his retirement, and protested that it was not strong enough to advance into Belgium, and that Maubeuge should be fortified more strongly. His successor Lanrezac shared his concerns. After tours of the area Gallieni had failed to persuade the authorities to modernise Maubeuge.

Like a number of officers with colonial experience, Gallieni wanted the French army to give up the &quot;pantalon rouge&quot; (red trousers worn by French soldiers, allegedly as a boost to morale) and adopt a less conspicuous uniform. This was vetoed on the grounds that dull uniforms might be confused with those of the enemy and might turn the army into a citizen militia like the Boers.

At the 1911 manoeuvres Gallieni used air reconnaissance to capture a colonel of the Supreme War Council and his staff. He expressed reservations about the limited offensive strategy. His views on fortifications, artillery, and use of information obtained from aviation and intelligence were seen as unusual views for a colonial soldier.

In the same year, Gallieni was considered the logical choice for supreme commander of the French Army, but because of advanced age and poor health, he declined in favour of Joffre.

His date of retirement is given as February or April 1914. His wife died in early summer 1914.

Before the war he wrote of Joffre in his diary, &quot;When I was riding I passed him in the &quot;bois&quot; [woods] today—on foot as usual—how fat and heavy he is; he will hardly last out his three years.&quot; He warned Joffre, correctly as it would turn out, that the Germans would come west of the Meuse in strength (i.e. make an enveloping move deep into Belgium, rather than a shallow incursion through the south-east corner of Belgium and down through the Ardennes).

== First World War ==
=== The Marne ===
Gallieni was designated as Joffre&#x27;s successor &quot;in case of emergency&quot; on 31 July. Joffre refused to have him at his headquarters, saying &quot;He is difficult to place. I have always been under his orders. &quot;Il m’a toujours fait mousser&quot; [He always riled me].&quot; On 14 August, as the Lorraine offensive was beginning, Gallieni visited Joffre at the insistence of War Minister Adolphe Messimy, who felt intimidated by Joffre. Messimy imagined that Joffre would be more likely to listen to his former superior, but he was quickly palmed off onto the staff officer General Belin and his deputy Berthelot.

==== Military Governor of Paris ====
As a condition of becoming Military governor of Paris, Gallieni demanded three active corps to defend the city. War Minister Messimy ordered Joffre to provide them on 25 August but Joffre, regarding this as interference with strategy, ignored the order. Gallieni learned from Messimy that 61st and 62nd Infantry Divisions, formerly the Paris Garrison, were being ordered north for Maunoury’s planned offensive against the German west flank near Amiens, leaving Gallieni with only territorial troops. Already in poor health, Gallieni was appointed on 26 August, not yet knowing that he did not have the resources he had demanded. However, on that day Viviani formed a new government (&quot;Union sacrée&quot;), and on 27 August the new War Minister Millerand (who had replaced Messimy largely because of the poor state of the Paris defences) visited Joffre, who promised to provide the three corps if Maunoury&#x27;s attack should fail.

On 28 August the &quot;Zone of Armies&quot; was extended to cover the Paris suburbs. From 10am to 10:15am Gallieni held his one and only Council of Defence, at which his military and civil cabinets, standing up and without discussion, were made to sign the order placing Paris in a state of defence. He sacked two generals in his first two days.

On 2 September, the anniversary of the Battle of Sedan, the government left Paris for Bordeaux, with the evacuation continuing through the night of 2/3 September. Paris was made a &quot;camp militaire retranché&quot;. Before departing, Millerand ordered Gallieni to defend Paris &quot;à outrance,&quot; repeating the order when Gallieni explained that it meant destroying buildings and bridges. Gallieni later recorded that he had been certain that he was remaining behind to die. That day Gallieni told Joffre that without the three corps it would be &quot;absolutely impossible to resist.&quot; Joffre placed Maunoury&#x27;s Sixth Army, which was retreating down from the Amiens area, under Gallieni&#x27;s direct command as the &quot;Armies of Paris.&quot; Gallieni at once drove out to inspect his new command—he was horrified by the sight of the refugees—and to visit Maunoury. Gallieni had four territorial divisions and the 185th Territorial Brigade. He soon received a Marine Artillery Brigade (mostly Breton reservist sailors) and the 84th Territorial Division. Sixth Army was soon augmented by IV Corps from Third Army. Maunoury had an active division of VII Corps, a 5,000 strong native Moroccan brigade, and four reserve divisions: 61st and 62nd under Ebener, and 55th and 56th which had fought in Lorraine. Joffre also added Drude&#x27;s 45th Division of Zouaves from Algeria, who made a huge impression marching through Paris, and IV Corps from Third Army. The Prefect of Police had resigned &quot;on grounds of health&quot; on being ordered to remain at his post. Gallieni stayed up with his staff all night drawing up plans for Sixth Army to give battle between the Oise and Pontoise. Joffre had Millerand place Gallieni under his own command on 2 September.

Gallieni believed that Joffre&#x27;s strategy of retreating behind the Seine was &quot;divorced from reality&quot; as the Germans would not allow his forces enough time to rally. He spent the night of 2/3 September at his new HQ at Lycee Victor-Duruy, expecting a German attack the next day. On the morning of 3 September he learned that von Kluck was marching southeast across Paris, offering his flank to a French counterattack. The first public proclamation on the morning of 3 September promised to defend Paris &quot;to the last extremity.&quot; That morning Gallieni set engineers and civilian labourers to work cutting down woods and trees, and preparing bridges and buildings for demolition to clear lines of sight for guns. For three days concrete was poured and barbed wire strung up. Even the Eiffel Tower was prepared for demolition. Paris had 2,924 guns, ranging from 155mm to 75mm. Hospitals and fire departments put on alert. Gas for three months of electricity was stockpiled, along with bread for 43 days, salt for 20 days and meat for 12 days. Pigeons were brought under state control for carrying messages. Lt-Col Dreyfus rejoined the artillery. Civilian &quot;paniquards&quot; were encouraged to leave and reconnaissance patrols were set up.

==== Planning the counterattack ====
On the night of 3–4 September Joffre sent a handwritten note to Gallieni, wanting Maunoury&#x27;s Sixth Army to push east along the north bank of the Marne, although not specifying a date. This was in line with his modification of &quot;Instruction General No 4&quot; (2 September), envisaging a giant pocket from Paris to Verdun, of which he enclosed copies to Gallieni.

Gallieni decided that it was &quot;vital to act quickly&quot; so as not to leave Paris uncovered. At 09:10 on 4 September, based on the previous day&#x27;s reports of Paris aviators, which he had passed on to Joffre, and on his own authority, he sent orders to Maunoury to be ready to move his army that afternoon (now reinforced with Drude&#x27;s 45th Infantry Division) and to be ready to come to Paris for a conference. Having first informed President Poincare in Bordeaux—in Tuchman&#x27;s view, to force Joffre&#x27;s hand—at 9:45am he had the first of a series of telephone calls, conducted through aides, as Joffre would not come to the phone, and Gallieni refused to speak to anyone else. Gallieni would later write that &quot;the real Battle of the Marne was fought on the telephone.&quot; He proposed, depending on how much further the Germans were to be allowed to advance, to attack north of the Marne on 6 September or south of the Marne on 7 September.

Joffre&#x27;s reply, saying he preferred the southern option (which would take a day longer as it forced Sixth Army to cross to south of the Marne, but would allow Sixth Army and the BEF to not be separated by the river), arrived too late to reach Gallieni. To ensure British cooperation Gallieni, accompanied by Maunoury, left Paris at 1pm to drive to BEF GHQ at Melun, driving past lines of southbound cars leaving Paris. He had already received advice from the liaison officer Victor Huguet that BEF Commander-in-Chief Sir John French, influenced by BEF Chief of Staff Murray and concerned about his supply lines along the lower Seine, was unlikely to join in any offensive. They arrived at 3pm and with some difficulty located Murray, who had no idea when Sir John, who was out visiting British I Corps, was to return and was unwilling to make any decision in his absence. In a three-hour meeting, the French generals proposed that Sixth Army was to move that afternoon, then on 5 September was to strike German IV Reserve Corps on the west flank. A provisional agreement was drawn up, with copies kept by Maunoury, Gallieni, and Lt-Col Brecard to take to GQG for Joffre&#x27;s approval. The French came away with the impression that the British would not cooperate and that Murray had &quot;une grande repugnance&quot; for them, but he did in fact pass the plans along to Sir John. While this was going on, Wilson (BEF Sub Chief of Staff) was negotiating separate plans with Franchet d’Esperey (Fifth Army, on the British right), which envisaged Sixth Army attacking &quot;north&quot; of the Marne.

In the absence of news from Franchet d&#x27;Esperey, Joffre ordered Major Gamelin to draft orders for Maunoury to attack south of the Marne on 7 September. That evening Gallieni, who returned to Paris find Joffre&#x27;s message from earlier in the day and a message from Wilson, insisted on speaking to Joffre personally on the telephone, informing him that it was too late to cancel the movement of Maunoury&#x27;s Army. Joffre agreed to bring forward the Allied offensive to 6 September and to have Sixth Army attack north of the Marne instead, later writing that he had done so reluctantly as Maunoury would probably make contact with the Germans on 5 September, but that an extra day would have left the Germans in a more &quot;disadvantageous&quot; position. Tuchman argues that he may simply have been swayed by the dominant personality of Gallieni, his former superior. At 8:30pm Gallieni ordered the attack by Maunoury&#x27;s Army, which was in fact already under way. At 10pm Joffre issued &quot;General Order No 6&quot;, ordering a General Allied Offensive.

==== Taxicab Army and the Battle of the Ourcq ====
On 5 September Gallieni informed Maunoury that there was to be no retreat and issued secret orders for the destruction of important parts of Paris, including the Pont Neuf and the Pont Alexandre III.

On 7 September Gallieni, concerned that with Maunoury&#x27;s Sixth Army fighting out in the open, Paris was now vulnerable, telegraphed the government in Bordeaux to discuss the possible evacuation of the civilian population from the Paris suburbs, and ordered prefects and the police to find &quot;emergency locations&quot; for them. That day Gallieni was ordered not to communicate directly with the government. This left Joffre &quot;all-powerful&quot; (in Gallieni&#x27;s description), as he had sacked so many generals and Gallieni was his only serious rival. The same day, frustrated at the slowness at which the British were advancing into the gap between the German First and Second Armies, Gallieni sent Lartigue&#x27;s 8th Infantry Division to the BEF&#x27;s &quot;right&quot; flank to keep contact between the BEF and Franchet d’Esperey&#x27;s Fifth Army (the French and British generals of 1914 were extremely concerned at the prospect of armies being encircled and besieged, after what had happened to the French Armies at Sedan and Metz in 1870). Joffre, concerned that Gallieni might arouse Sir John&#x27;s &quot;touchiness,&quot; sent a telegram to Lord Kitchener (British War Secretary) thanking him for Sir John&#x27;s efforts.

It was Gallieni&#x27;s decision to send 103rd and 104th Infantry Regiments (5 battalions, part of Trentinian&#x27;s 7th Infantry Division, itself part of IV Corps; most of 7th Infantry Division, including artillery, had been sent to the front by rail and truck the previous night) to the front on the night of 7/8 September, in taxicabs commandeered the previous evening. The division&#x27;s attack failed completely so the taxicab troops had even less impact than sometimes supposed. Although &quot;great publicity for Gallieni; militarily it was insignificant&quot; in Herwig&#x27;s view. Upon seeing the &quot;taxicab army&quot; ferrying troops to the front, Gallieni made one of the most oft-quoted remarks of the First World War: &quot;Eh bien, voilà au moins qui n&#x27;est pas banal!&quot; (&quot;Well, here at least is something out of the ordinary!&quot;).

Learning of Gallieni&#x27;s contingency plans to evacuate Paris the previous day, Joffre telegraphed Millerand (8 September) demanding that he cancel Gallieni&#x27;s &quot;dangerous&quot; message, and insisting that Gallieni was under his orders and had no business communicating directly with the government. On 8 September Gallieni ordered Maunoury, under heavy pressure from von Kluck, to hold his ground. Joffre gave permission for Maunoury to pull back his left if necessary. The Germans, concerned at the gap between their First and Second Armies, began to pull back on 9 September, giving the Allies a strategic victory in the Battle of the Marne.

=== After the Marne ===
When the German warships &quot;Goeben&quot; and &quot;Breslau&quot; went to Constantinople, Gallieni proposed attacking the Turkish straits.

By early December 1914 some of Gallieni&#x27;s supporters were suggesting that he be appointed Commander-in-Chief in Joffre&#x27;s place, or be made Minister of War, or both.

Gallieni was an early supporter of some kind of expeditionary force to the Balkans. Early in 1915 Gallieni supported the proposal of Franchet d’Esperey and Aristide Briand (Justice Minister) for an expedition to Salonika, which he hoped would detach first Turkey then Austria-Hungary, leaving Germany &quot;doomed.&quot; President Poincare came out in favour of such a scheme, over Joffre&#x27;s opposition, on 7 January 1915.

=== Minister of War ===
==== Appointment ====
With Viviani’s government in trouble following the resignation of Delcasse as Foreign Minister, the unsuccessful autumn offensive and the entry of Bulgaria into the war, he asked Joffre, who had told him that nine out of ten generals would make poor ministers of war, whether Gallieni would be a good replacement for Millerand as Minister of War. Joffre replied &quot;perhaps,&quot; then after a pause for thought &quot;maybe.&quot; Although Gallieni agreed, in the event other French leaders refused to join Viviani&#x27;s government so Briand formed a new government on 29 October 1915, with Viviani as vice-president of the Council of Ministers (Deputy PM) and Gallieni as War Minister.

Since July 1915 Joffre had been demanding that he be appointed commander-in-chief over &quot;all&quot; French forces, including those at the Dardanelles and Salonika. By November 1915 President Poincare was persuaded, and Briand, initially reluctant because of the difficulty of defending Gallieni&#x27;s inclusion in his new ministry, agreed and on his first day in office asked Poincare to help him persuade Gallieni to accept Joffre&#x27;s enhanced role. Gallieni agreed and wrote to Joffre—having first shown the letter to Briand—assuring him that &quot;you can count on me.&quot; Briand had the two men meet and shake hands.

At the meeting of the Superior Council of Defence (24 November 1915) Joffre had Briand address the demarcation of his own and Gallieni&#x27;s authority, and objected to the Council discussing operational matters, threatening to resign if they attempted to interfere with his &quot;liberty.&quot; Joffre met with Poincare and Briand both before and after the meeting to discuss the issue. Gallieni complained bitterly in his diary about the politicians’ unwillingness to stand up to Joffre. On 1 December Poincare and Briand met with Gallieni. They rejected the proposal prepared by his staff to vest authority in the Minister of War, Briand objecting that he would be obliged to answer questions in the Chamber about operational matters. Gallieni agreed that Joffre be commander-in-chief, with de Castelnau—who was soon sidelined—as his chief of staff, and under the War Minister&#x27;s orders. A Presidential Decree of 2 December 1915 made Joffre &quot;Commander-in-Chief of the French Armies&quot; (&quot;generalissimo&quot;) over all theatres apart from North Africa. After considerable discussion this was approved by the Chamber of Deputies by 406–67 on 9 December.

==== Policies ====
Gallieni cleared out soldiers from cushy jobs—three Paris theatres had been directed by Army officers. He authorised the renewed use of black African troops—50,000 in total—on the Western Front. He introduced &quot;foyers du soldat&quot;—waiting rooms for soldiers in transit at railway stations.

Although Gallieni supported the Salonika expedition, he shared Joffre&#x27;s low opinion of Sarrail’s military abilities. On 12 November Gallieni ordered Sarrail to retreat to Salonika with as much of the Serb Army as he could gather. After Sarrail lobbied politicians for reinforcements Gallieni wrote back to 19 November telling him that he was not going to receive the four corps he wanted, although on 20 November he sent Sarrail (whom he thought &quot;indecisive and not up to the task&quot;) a telegram giving him a free choice as to whether to assist the latest Serb attack and when to fall back on Salonika.

With evacuation of the Gallipoli bridgeheads under discussion, Gallieni was willing to divert troops there from Salonika for one last attempt. On 9–11 December Gallieni took part in the Anglo-French talks in Paris (along with Grey (British Foreign Secretary), Kitchener (British War Secretary), Joffre and Briand) at which it was decided to maintain an Allied presence in Salonika, although it was unclear for how long. He later ordered Joffre to send an extra French division, although not the two Sarrail demanded.

==== Resignation ====
Gallieni made an effort to unite soldiers and politicians, and to establish a working relationship in which he concentrated on supplying resources (not dissimilar to the role to which Kitchener was restricted in the UK from the end of 1915). However, Gallieni had prostate cancer, with pain making him less tolerant of criticism at a time when political disquiet was growing after the failure of the Second Battle of Champagne, especially the failed attack on Hartmannswillerkopf and its subsequent total loss.

In Clayton&#x27;s view, Gallieni may well have been sceptical of Joffre&#x27;s plans for a massive Anglo-French offensive on the Somme, to be accompanied by Italian and Russian offensives, as floated at the Chantilly meeting in 6–8 December 1915. There was also friction over Gallieni&#x27;s assertion of his right to appoint generals, Joffre&#x27;s practice of communicating directly with the British generals rather than going through the War Ministry, and Gallieni&#x27;s maintaining contacts with generals whom Joffre had replaced.

In autumn 1915 Lt-Colonel Driant, a member of the Chamber of Deputies and commander of a &quot;chasseurs&quot; brigade, complained to Gallieni of how Joffre had been removing guns and garrisons from Verdun and even preparing some forts for demolition. Joffre was furious and disputed Gallieni&#x27;s right to comment. Driant, who had served at Verdun, was a member of the Army Commission of the Chamber of Deputies. The Council of Ministers discussed his reports and President Poincare asked Gallieni to investigate. Gallieni wrote to Joffre (16 or 18 December 1915) expressing concern at the state of trenches at Verdun and elsewhere on the front—in fact matters were already being taken in hand at Verdun.

The political atmosphere was poisonous after the opening of the German attack at Verdun (21 February). Rumours circulated in Paris that Joffre had ordered the abandonment of Verdun at the end of February 1916 when the Germans first attacked. Gallieni demanded to see all paperwork from the period, but Joffre had made no such order in writing, merely despatching de Castelnau to assess the situation. Gallieni launched an angry report at the Council of Ministers on 7 March—read in his usual precise way—criticising Joffre&#x27;s conduct of operations over the last eighteen months and demanding ministerial control, then resigned. Gallieni was falsely suspected of wanting to launch a military takeover of the government. Poincare wrote that Gallieni was trying to force Joffre&#x27;s resignation, although it is unclear whether he was specifically trying to do so. Briand knew that publication of the report would damage morale and might bring down the government. Gallieni was persuaded to remain in office until a replacement had been designated and approved.

Rocques was appointed as his successor after it had been ensured that Joffre had no objections. This would be the last attempt to assert ministerial control over the army until Clemenceau became Prime Minister late in 1917.

== Later life ==
The strain of high office had broken Gallieni&#x27;s already fragile health. Suffering from prostate cancer, he underwent two surgeries at the Versailles clinic and died on May 27, 1916.

Gallieni&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot; were published posthumously in 1920.

He was posthumously made Marshal of France, in 1921. He was buried in Saint-Raphaël. Camp Gallieni in Kati was named after him.
There is also a Camp Galieni in Abidjan that serves as the Ivorian Arms forces Headquarters 

== Assessments ==
Clayton describes him as a dry precise man, a secular republican (views which influenced his colonial policy) but one who kept aloof from politics. Herwig describes him as &quot;formidable&quot; and &quot;France’s most distinguished soldier&quot; whose &quot;physical appearance alone commanded respect&quot;: he was of straight bearing and always wore full dress uniform.

By the time Gallieni complained about Joffre&#x27;s handling of Verdun, there was already public debate, much of it politically motivated, about which of them had &quot;won&quot; the First Battle of the Marne in 1914. Churchill commends him for seeing the opportunity to outflank the German Army, using Manoury&#x27;s Sixth Army, and for persuading the defeatist Joffre. &quot;He is not thinking only of the local situation around Paris. He thinks for France and he behaves with the spontaneous confidence of genius in action.&quot;. In his memoirs Gallieni claimed credit for that victory, and historians such as Georges Blond, Basil Liddell Hart, and Henri Isselin credited him with being the guiding intelligence, a claim disputed by Captain Lyet in his book &quot;Joffre et Gallieni a la Marne&quot; in 1938. Ian Senior describes &quot;Gallieni&#x27;s claims&quot; as &quot;absolute nonsense&quot; and Lyet&#x27;s book as &quot;an excellent analysis which convincingly refutes&quot; them. Joffre himself once remarked: &quot;Je ne sais pas qui l&#x27;a gagnée, mais je sais bien qui l&#x27;aurait perdue.&quot; (I do not know who won it [the battle], but I know well who would have lost it.&quot;). Doughty writes of the Marne: &quot;Gallieni’s role was important, but the key concept and decisions lay with Joffre&quot;. At the end of the war Clemenenceau said, &quot;Without Galliéni, victory would have been impossible.&quot;

== Ethnology ==

From the beginning of his colonial career he became interested in ethnology. He amassed a large collection of objects from French Sudan and Madagascar, which he donated to the Museum de Toulouse.

<text>Psychology Today is an American media organization with a focus on psychology and human behavior.

The publication began as a bimonthly magazine, which first appeared in 1967. The print magazine&#x27;s reported circulation is 275,000 as of 2023. The &quot;Psychology Today&quot; website features therapist and health professional directories and hundreds of blogs written by a wide variety of psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, medical doctors, marriage and family therapists, anthropologists, sociologists, and science journalists.

&quot;Psychology Today&quot; is among the oldest media outlets with a focus on behavioral science. Its mission is to cover all aspects of human behavior so as to help people better manage their own health and wellness, adjust their mindset, and manage a range of mental health and relationship concerns.

&quot;Psychology Today&quot; content and its therapist directory are found in 20 countries worldwide. &quot;Psychology Today&quot;&#x27;s therapist directory is the most widely used and allows users to sort therapists by location, insurance, types of therapy, price, and other characteristics. It also has a Spanish-language website.

==History==
===20th century===
&quot;Psychology Today&quot; was founded in 1967 by Nicolas Charney. The goal of the publication is to make psychology literature accessible to the general public.

&quot;Psychology Today&quot; features reportage and information that looks inward at the workings of the brain and bonds between people. It draws on research reports and interviews with experts on topics, including human motivation, personality development, intelligence, child development, parenting practices, schizophrenia, sexuality, leadership, addiction, anxiety, politics, and human and animal behavior.

Contributors have included Irving Janis, Martin Seligman, Peter Drucker, Abraham Maslow, and others.

In 1976, &quot;Psychology Today&quot; sold 1,026,872 copies. In 1981, its circulation increased to 1,171,362 copies in 1981. In 1986, it decreased to 862,193.

From 1983 to 1987, &quot;Psychology Today&quot; was owned and managed by the American Psychological Association. The magazine has won several awards from the Society of Publication Designers.

===21st century===
From June 2010 to June 2011, &quot;Psychology Today&quot; ranked among the top 10 selling consumer magazines at newsstands. 

The &quot;Psychology Today&quot; website, which includes archived articles since 1992, features a continuous stream of blogs by laboratory researchers, clinical practitioners, and writers with a broad range of expertise. Daily reports of the findings of new research on human behavior accompany accounts of common concerns and explorations of the impact of current events on mental health. 

The website includes a directory of psychologists, psychiatrists, and other mental health professionals in the U.S. and globally. In June 2021, &quot;The New York Times&quot; recommended the website as a source for finding therapists.

&quot;Psychology Today&quot; is currently owned by Sussex Publishers.

<doc id="1298541" wikidata="Q181248" url="?curid=1298541" title="A Christmas Carol (1938 film)">
<text>A Christmas Carol is a 1938 American drama film adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27;s 1843 novella of the same name, starring Reginald Owen as Ebenezer Scrooge, an elderly miser who learns the error of his ways on Christmas Eve after visitations by three spirits. The film was directed by Edwin L. Marin from a script by Hugo Butler.

==Plot==
On Christmas Eve in 19th-century London, Fred Scrooge is sliding on ice on a sidewalk. He meets Peter and Tim Cratchit, sons of his maternal uncle Ebenezer&#x27;s clerk, Bob Cratchit. When Fred reveals who he is, the boys take off in terror.

Fred soon arrives at the counting-house of the miserly Ebenezer. After declining an invitation from his nephew to dine with him on Christmas, Scrooge rudely dismisses two gentlemen collecting money for charity. That night, Scrooge reluctantly allows Bob to have Christmas off but orders him to come into work early the day after. Later, though, Bob accidentally knocks off Scrooge&#x27;s hat with a snowball. Scrooge fires him and withholds a week&#x27;s salary to compensate for the ruined hat, also demanding a shilling to make up the difference. Bob spends the last of his wages on food for his family&#x27;s Christmas dinner.

In his house, Scrooge is confronted by the ghost of his deceased business partner, Jacob Marley, who warns Scrooge to repent his wicked ways, or he will be condemned in the afterlife as Marley was. He tells Scrooge he will be haunted by three spirits.

At 1 a.m, Scrooge is visited by the youthful Ghost of Christmas Past, who takes him back in time to his early life. Scrooge is shown his unhappiness when he was left to spend the holidays alone at school, and his joy when his sister, Fan, came to take him home for Christmas. The spirit reminds Scrooge that Fan, dead for some years, is the mother of his nephew. Scrooge is shown his early career in business and money lending as an employee under Fezziwig.

At two o&#x27;clock, Scrooge meets the merry Ghost of Christmas Present, who shows Scrooge how others keep Christmas. At a church service, Fred and his fiancée, Bess, are seen as happy and in love. The couple must wait to marry because of Fred&#x27;s financial circumstances, and the spirit observes that perhaps they will not marry at all, and their love may end. Scrooge is then shown the Cratchit home. Despite wearing a cheery manner for his family&#x27;s sake, Bob is deeply troubled by the loss of his job, though he confides in no one except his daughter Martha. The spirit hints that Bob&#x27;s youngest son, Tim, will die of a crippling illness by the same time next year if things do not change.

At 3 a.m., the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come arrives, appearing as a silent, cloaked figure. The spirit shows Scrooge what will happen if he does not change. Scrooge discovers Tiny Tim is dead and his family mourns for him, while he himself dies alone and forgotten. Scrooge promises to repent and returns home to awake in his own bed on Christmas Day.

Scrooge is a changed man. He asks a boy in the street to buy the large turkey in the butcher shop&#x27;s window for him, meaning to take it to the Cratchits. Running into the two men who petitioned him for charity on Christmas Eve, Scrooge gives them a large donation. He visits Fred and makes him his new partner, then goes to the Cratchit house where he gives everyone gifts and rehires Bob with an increase in his wages.

==Production==

Made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and originally intended to star Lionel Barrymore (who played the role of Scrooge annually on radio but was forced to drop out of the film because of his arthritis, though he narrated its trailer), the movie starred Reginald Owen as Scrooge and the married couple Gene and Kathleen Lockhart as the Cratchits. Terry Kilburn costarred as Tiny Tim and a young June Lockhart (Gene and Kathleen&#x27;s daughter) made her screen debut as one of the Cratchit daughters. Leo G. Carroll played Marley&#x27;s Ghost. The characters of Fred (Scrooge&#x27;s nephew) and Elizabeth, his fiancée (his wife in the novelette), were greatly expanded in order to work in a romantic angle to the story that Dickens did not intend. The couple was played by Barry MacKay and Lynne Carver. Ann Rutherford, better known as Polly Benedict in the MGM Andy Hardy film series and as Carreen O&#x27;Hara in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, was a young and attractive Ghost of Christmas Past, rather than the somewhat unusual creation that Dickens described.

The music for the film was composed by Franz Waxman, in contrast to most MGM films of the period, whose scores were composed by Herbert Stothart.

While Gene Lockhart&#x27;s performance as Bob Cratchit is admired, he is often criticized for looking too &quot;well-fed&quot; for the role. In this production, unlike Dickens&#x27; original story, Scrooge actually fires Cratchit rather than just threatening to do so.

==Theatrical release==
Originally intended as a 1939 release, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; was rushed into production in October 1938 and was finished in a matter of weeks. It opened in December at New York City&#x27;s Radio City Music Hall where it did moderately well. One of many adaptations of the work, it was frequently revived in theaters by MGM.

==Television broadcast==
The film was shown on local television stations in the United States throughout the 1960s and 1970s, and was a staple of Chicago&#x27;s WGN television&#x27;s &quot;Family Classics&quot;. It ran in syndication throughout the United States from the 1960s to the 1990s on various local networks until the advent of cable television. Since the late 1990s, it has been broadcast on Turner Classic Movies, airing several times during December.

The film originally telecast in the 1960s included several additional scenes that have been cut out of the 69-minute version. Scrooge&#x27;s fiancée, who eventually leaves him because of his miserly ways, was completely dropped from the shortened version, as were the two starving children &quot;Want&quot; and &quot;Ignorance&quot;, who hid within the folds of the Ghost of Christmas Present&#x27;s robe. Also gone were the thieves who ransack Scrooge&#x27;s belongings after he &quot;dies&quot; in the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come segment. The much superior full version may no longer be in existence.

==Home media==
In 1988, MGM/UA Home Video and Turner Entertainment released &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; on VHS celebrating its 50th anniversary, for the first time in a colorized version. In an interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; in 1988 promoting the film&#x27;s release on home video, actress June Lockhart admitted that, despite being an MGM production, it was &quot;a &#x27;B&#x27; picture&quot;. The colorized version was released once again on VHS by Warner Home Video in 2000. In November 2005, the black and white version was released on DVD in a &quot;Classic Holiday Collection&quot; box set including &quot;Boys Town&quot; and &quot;Christmas in Connecticut&quot;, two other MGM titles with a holiday/family theme; it was also released as an individual title. Since its first DVD release, it has seen multiple releases in various Christmas movie collection box sets. A Blu-ray version was released in November 2014.

<text>Edwin Eugene Lockhart (July 18, 1891 – March 31, 1957) was a Canadian-American character actor, playwright, singer and lyricist. He appeared in over 300 films, and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Regis in &quot;Algiers&quot; (1938), the American remake of &quot;Pepe le Moko&quot;.

==Early life==
Lockhart was born in London, Ontario, Canada, and made his professional debut at the age of six when he appeared with the Kilties Band of Canada. He later appeared in sketches with Beatrice Lillie.

Lockhart was raised Catholic and educated in Canadian schools and at the London Oratory School in London, England. He played football for the Toronto Argonauts.

==Stage==

Lockhart had a long stage career; he also wrote professionally and taught acting and stage technique at the Juilliard School of Music in New York City. He also wrote theatrical sketches, radio shows, special stage material, song lyrics and articles for stage and radio magazines.

He made his Broadway debut in 1916, in the musical &quot; The Riviera Girl&quot;. 

He was a member of the traveling play &quot;The Pierrot Players&quot; (for which he wrote the book and lyrics). This play introduced the song, &quot;The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise&quot;, for which Lockhart wrote the lyrics along with Canadian composer Ernest Seitz. (The song was subsequently made popular by Les Paul and Mary Ford in the 1950s.) He wrote and directed the Broadway musical revue &quot;Bunk of 1926&quot;. He sang in &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; for the San Francisco Opera Association. On Broadway, Lockhart originated the roles of Uncle Sid in Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s only comedy, &quot;Ah, Wilderness!&quot; (1933), and Fortesque in Arthur Schwartz&#x27;s &quot;Virginia&quot; (1937). 

In 1949, he took over from Lee J. Cobb as Willy Loman, during the original run of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;.

==Film==

Lockhart made his film debut in &quot;Smilin&#x27; Through&quot; (1922) as the Rector, but he made few additional appearances during the silent era. His sound debut was in the film &quot;By Your Leave&quot; (1934), where he played the playboy &quot;Skeets&quot;. Lockhart subsequently appeared in more than 300 motion pictures. He often played villains, including a role as the treacherous informant Regis in &quot;Algiers&quot; (1938), the American remake of &quot;Pepe le Moko&quot;, which gained him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He played the suspicious Georges de la Trémouille, the Dauphin&#x27;s chief counselor, in &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1948), starring Ingrid Bergman. 

He also had a great succession of &quot;good guy&quot; supporting roles including Bob Cratchit in &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1938) and Judge Harper in &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; (1947).

Upon the arrival of Orson Welles in Hollywood in 1940, Lockhart wrote a short poem satirizing Welles entitled &quot;Little Orson Annie&quot;. The poem was a parody of the 1885 poem &quot;Little Orphant Annie&quot; by James Whitcomb Riley.

Lockhart played a bumbling sheriff in &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; (1940), opposite Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell. He appeared in the movie &quot;The Sea Wolf&quot; (1941), adapted from the novel by Jack London, as a ship&#x27;s doctor. He played the Starkeeper in &quot;Carousel&quot; (1956). His last film role was that of the Equity Board President in the film &quot;Jeanne Eagels&quot; (1957).

==Personal life==

Lockhart was married to actress Kathleen Lockhart from June 12, 1924, until his death. They had one child together, actress June Lockhart, through whom he is the grandfather of actress Anne Lockhart.

Lockhart became an American citizen in 1939.

==Death==
Lockhart died March 31, 1957, from a coronary thrombosis at the age of 65 in St. John&#x27;s Hospital, Santa Monica, California.

==Legacy==
Lockhart has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame—one for motion pictures, at 6307 Hollywood Boulevard, and one for television at 6681 Hollywood Boulevard. Both were dedicated February 8, 1960.

<text>Adolph Gottlieb (March 14, 1903 – March 4, 1974) was an American abstract expressionist painter who also made sculpture and became a print maker.

==Early life and education==
Gottlieb, one of the &quot;first generation&quot; of Abstract Expressionists, was born in New York City in 1903 to Jewish parents. From 1920 to 1921 he studied at the Art Students League of New York, after which, having determined to become an artist he left high school at the age of 17 and worked his passage to Europe on a merchant ship. He traveled in France and Germany for a year. He lived in Paris for six months during which time he visited the Louvre Museum every day and audited classes at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière. He spent the next year traveling in Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia and other parts of Central Europe, visiting museums and art galleries. When he returned, he was one of the most traveled New York Artists. After his return to New York, he studied at the Art Students League of New York, Parsons School of Design, Cooper Union and Educational Alliance.

==1920s and 1930s==
Gottlieb had his first solo exhibition at the Dudensing Galleries in New York City in 1930. During the 1920s and early 1930s he formed lifelong friendships with other artists such as Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko, David Smith, Milton Avery and John Graham. In 1935 he and a group of artists including Ben-Zion, Joseph Solman, Ilya Bolotowsky, Ralph Rosenborg, Louis Harris, Mark Rothko and Louis Schanker, known as &quot;The Ten&quot;, exhibited their works together until 1940.

During that period Gottlieb made a living with a variety of part-time jobs and worked on the Federal Art Project in 1936. From September 1937 to June 1938, Gottlieb lived in the Arizona desert, outside of Tucson. In those nine months, he radically changed his approach to painting. He moved from an expressionist-realist style to an approach that combined elements of surrealism and formalist abstraction, using objects and scenes from the local environment as symbols to remove temporality from his work. He transitioned from this into more Surrealist works like the &quot;Sea Chest&quot;, which displays mysterious incongruities on an otherwise normal landscape. 

Here he conveys to the viewer the expansiveness he must have felt looking at Arizona desert sky, although he distills this expansiveness into a more basic abstract form: &quot;I think the emotional feeling I had was that it was like being at sea …Then there&#x27;s the tremendous clarity – out in Arizona there&#x27;s a tremendous clarity of light and at night the clouds seem very close.&quot; When these Arizona works were exhibited in New York after Gottlieb&#x27;s return they created a break with Gottlieb&#x27;s former circle of colleagues, several of whom condemned his new work for being &quot;too abstract&quot;.

==1940s–1950s==
Gottlieb and a small circle of friends valued the work of the Surrealist artist they saw exhibited in New York in the 1930s. They also exchanged copies of the magazine &quot;Cahiers d&#x27;art&quot; and were quite familiar with current ideas about automatic writing and subconscious imagery. Gottlieb painted a few works in a Surrealist style in 1940 and 1941. The results of his experiments manifested themselves in his series &quot;Pictographs&quot; which spanned from 1941 to 1950. In his painting &quot;Voyager&#x27;s Return&quot; , he juxtaposes these images in compartmentalized spaces. His images appear similar to those of indigenous populations of North America and the Ancient Near East. If he found out one of his symbols was not original, he no longer used it.

In 1941, disappointed with the art around him, he developed the approach he called Pictographs. Gottlieb&#x27;s pictographs, which he created from 1941 to 1954, are one of the first coherent bodies of mature painting by an American of his generation. 

Gottlieb spoke of his painting concerns in a 1947 statement:

In May 1942, his first &quot;pictograph&quot; was displayed at the second annual exhibition of the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors, located at the Wildenstein Galleries in New York In his pictographs, he introduced a new way of approaching abstraction that included imagery drawn from his subconscious but which notably departed from the idea of narrative. To meet this goal Gottlieb presented images inserted into sections of a loosely drawn grid. Each image existed independently of the others, yet their arrangement on the same plane, along with relationships of color, texture and shape, allow the viewer to associate with them. Meaning, then, is intensely personal – another innovation of Gottlieb&#x27;s pictograph paintings based on Surrealist biomorphism. For Gottlieb, biomorphism was a way to freely express his unconscious mind, in which he had become fascinated via John Graham, Sigmund Freud and Surrealism. Gottlieb also incorporated automatism – the painterly technique for Freudian free-association – was the method Gottlieb used to generate biomorphic shapes, which were forms spontaneously conceived in his unconscious . These biomorphic shapes were separated by the all over grid pattern, which served as the overall structure of the &quot;pictograph&quot; series.

Gottlieb once said, &quot;If I made a wriggly line or a serpentine line it was because I wanted a serpentine line. Afterwards it would suggest a snake but when I made it, it did not suggest anything. It was purely shape... &quot;. These lines and shapes that Gottlieb used were easily interpreted to mean different things by different people.

By 1950 Gottlieb observed that the &quot;all-over painting&quot; approach had become a cliché for American abstract painting. He began his new series of Imaginary Landscapes in which he retained his usage of a &#x27;pseudo-language&#x27; but added the new element of space. He was not painting landscapes in the traditional sense, rather he modified that genre to match his own style of painting. Imaginary Landscapes are horizontal canvasses divided into two registers, one very active below a more contemplative upper one, set up a different approach to abstraction at mid-century. In 1955 Gottlieb remarked:
I frequently hear the question, &quot;What do these images mean?&quot; This is simply the wrong question. Visual images do not have to conform to either verbal thinking or optical facts. A better question would be &quot;Do these images convey any emotional truth?&quot;

Late in 1956 Gottlieb formulated the image that has become known as the &quot;Burst&quot; and spent most of the next two years working on this approach. He simplifies his representation down to two disc shapes and winding masses. His paintings are variations with these elements arranged in different ways. This series, unlike the Imaginary Landscape series, suggests a basic landscape with a sun and a ground. On another level, the shapes are so rudimentary; they are not limited to this one interpretation. 

He was a masterful colorist as well and in the Burst series his use of color is particularly crucial. He is considered one of the first color field painters and is one of the forerunners of Lyrical Abstraction.

==1960s–1970s==
By 1960 Gottlieb&#x27;s efforts on his &quot;Burst&quot; series, allowed him to greatly simplify his use of imagery. He created &quot;Burst&quot; and &quot;Imaginary Landscape&quot; type paintings for the remainder of his career but, unlike some of his colleagues, he did not limit himself to one or two images.Discussion of Gottlieb&#x27;s art is usually limited to mentions of &quot;Bursts&quot; or &quot;Imaginary Landscapes&quot;, which detracts from the broad range of ideas this artist examined. Gottlieb summarized his aims in a 1967 interview:

But to me everything is nature, including any feelings that I have – or dreams. Everything is part of nature. Even painting has become part of nature. To clarify further: I don&#x27;t have an ideological approach or a doctrinaire approach to my work. I just paint from my personal feelings, and my reflexes and instincts. I have to trust these.

A representative painting from this period is included in The Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany, NY.

In 1967 while Gottlieb was preparing for the Whitney and Guggenheim Museum exhibition he began to make small models for sculptures out of cut and painted cardboard that, he said, made him feel like &quot;a young sculptor, just beginning&quot;. These small sculptures evolved into larger works in cut, welded and painted steel and aluminum. His foray into sculpture lasted only about a year and a half, but in that brief time he created a body of work that challenged the delineation between painting and sculpture. In ways similar to his friend the sculptor David Smith, Gottlieb&#x27;s background as a painter made it impossible for him to visualize objects without color. Once he accepted this, He was compelled to use all the tools he had developed in his long painting career – touch, visual balance, surface quality and more – to make his sculptures, like his paintings, become &quot;a vehicle for the expression of feeling… I feel a necessity for making the particular colors that I use, or the particular shapes, carry the burden of everything that I want to express, and all has to be concentrated within these few elements.&quot; In all Gottlieb created 42 sculptures, including three large, outdoor pieces that are currently in the collections of The National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, The Storm King Art Center in New Windsor, NY, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

Gottlieb remained active throughout the 1960s. In 1963 he became the first American artist to be awarded the Gran Premio of the São Paulo Bienal in Brazil. In 1965, he received the American Academy of Achievement&#x27;s Golden Plate Award. In 1968, the Guggenheim Museum and the Whitney Museum in New York collaborated on a retrospective exhibition of his art that filled both museums. This remains, to date, the only collaborative project between these two major institutions.

==Career highlights==
Gottlieb had 56 solo exhibitions and was included in over 200 group exhibitions. His works of art are in the collections of more than 140 major museums around the world. Gottlieb was accomplished as a painter, draughtsman, printmaker and sculptor. He designed and oversaw construction of a 1500 square-foot stained glass façade for the Milton Steinberg Center in New York City in 1954, and he designed a suite of 18 stained glass windows for the Kingsway Jewish Center in Brooklyn. He was the first of his generation to have his art collected by the Museum of Modern Art, New York (1946) and the Guggenheim Museum (1948). 

Gottlieb&#x27;s work is included in the permanent holdings of numerous museum institutions in the US, for instance, his work &quot;Altar&quot; from 1947, is included in the permanent collections of the Pérez Art Museum Miami, Florida.

==Death and legacy==

A stroke in 1970 left Gottlieb paralyzed except for his right arm and hand. He continued to paint and to exhibit his art until his death in March 1974. His funeral service was held on March 6, 1974, at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, and he was buried at Mt. Pleasant Cemetery, Hawthorne, NY. He was voted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1972.

Gottlieb advocated for artists&#x27; professional status throughout his life. He helped to organize &quot;Forum 49” and other artist-led events and symposia in New York and Provincetown in the 1940s and 1950s. In 1950 he was the primary organizer of the protest against the Metropolitan Museum of Art that resulted in him and his colleagues gaining recognition as &quot;The Irascibles&quot;. Following directions in his Will, the Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation was formed in 1976, offering grants to visual artists.

<text>William Henry Ferris (July 20, 1874 – August 23, 1941) was an American author, minister, and scholar.

==Early life==
He was born in New Haven, Connecticut, the son of David H. and Sarah Ann Jefferson Ferris. His grandparents were free at the time of his father&#x27;s birth. His father joined the Union Army voluntarily at the age of 17. His mother&#x27;s father escaped from captivity on plantation and later purchased the freedom of his wife and children.

==Education and career==
A graduate of Yale University (1895) with a BA degree, Ferris subsequently took on the role of writer and lecturer. He was a Harvard Divinity School student from 1897 to 1899, graduating from Harvard with an MA in journalism in 1900. After teaching at Tallahassee State College, Florida Baptist College (1900–01), he worked for a number of newspapers from 1902 to 1903. He continued teaching during the years 1903–1905 at Henderson Normal School and Kittrell College in North Carolina. Ferris became pastor of Christ Congregational Church from 1904 to 1905. In 1908 he wrote a book entitled &quot;Typical Negro Traits&quot;. From 1910 to 1912, he was given charge of the &quot;colored&quot; missions of the A.M.E. Zion Church of Lowell and Salem, Massachusetts, as a lecturer at white churches. He went on to write &quot;The African Abroad; or his Evolution in Western Civilization: Tracing his development under Caucasian Milieus&quot; in 1913.

Ferris held positions as Assistant President General of the UNIA-ACL and Associate Editor of the &quot;Negro World&quot;.

==Activism==
He was a participant in the March 5, 1897, meeting to celebrate the memory of Frederick Douglass which founded the American Negro Academy led by Alexander Crummell. Over the coming decades, Ferris remained active among the scholars, editors, and activists of this first major African American learned society, refuting racist scholarship, promoting black claims to individual, social, and political equality, and studying the history and sociology of African American life. Ferris worked with William Monroe Trotter and the Boston Guardian, W. E. B. Du Bois and the Niagara Movement, and John Edward Bruce and the Negro Society for Historical Research.

At the suggestion of Trotter, Ferris came to Washington in January 1903 and spoke in opposition to the more conservative approach to black rights of Booker T. Washington in front of the Bethel Literary and Historical Society on January 6, 1903. As a reply, Richard W. Thompson spoke in front of the Second Baptist Lyceum on January 25 in support of Washington. In 1999, Jacqueline M. Moore argued that Thompson&#x27;s paper failed to hold his ground against Ferris, who was present at the talk.

The Second Baptist Lyceum met again on February 3 to hear a paper by Jesse Lawson in favor of Washington. In support of Washington were Robert H. Terrell, Bishop Alexander Walters, Dr. William Bruce Evans, J. H. Ewing, and Thompson, and those against were Ferris, Armond W. Scott, Lafayette M. Hershaw, T. M. Dent, Shelby James Davidson, and Mrs. Ida D. Bailey. Terrell, Evans, Lawson, and Thompson all owed positions or favors to Washington&#x27;s influence. John C. Dancy, George H. White, Mrs. Anna Evans Murray wife of Daniel Murray, Reuben S. Smith, Kelly Miller, Prof. Lewis Baxter Moore, and John P. Green were neutral. This controversy continued into the summer where important meetings in Louisville and Boston saw heated argument which even led to blows and Trotter&#x27;s and Granville Martin&#x27;s imprisonment.

In 1922, he was working on a volume entitled &quot;The African in Western Lands&quot;.

The &quot;African Times and Orient Review&quot; published an article by Ferris in which he praised an article previously contained in the same journal by Marcus Garvey.

<text>Joseph Hector &quot;Toe&quot; Blake (August 21, 1912 – May 17, 1995) was a Canadian ice hockey player and coach in the National Hockey League (NHL). Blake played in the NHL from 1935 to 1948 with the Montreal Maroons and Montreal Canadiens. He led the NHL in scoring in 1939, while also winning the Hart Trophy for most valuable player, and served as captain of the Canadiens from 1940 to his retirement. He won the Stanley Cup three times as a player: in 1935 with the Maroons, and in 1944 and 1946 with the Canadiens. While with the Canadiens Blake played on a line with Elmer Lach and Maurice Richard which was dubbed the Punch line, as all three were highly-skilled players. In 2017 Blake was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history. He was also known as &quot;The Old Lamplighter&quot; due to his skill for putting the puck in the net. 

Blake retired as a player in 1951, and soon after turned to coaching. After several years in lower leagues he was named the Canadiens&#x27; coach in 1955, and would remain in that role until his retirement in 1968. As coach of the Canadiens he won the Stanley Cup a further eight times, and helped Montreal become one of the most dominant teams in NHL history.

==Early life==
Blake was one of 13 children to Wilmer and Arzélie Blake (11 survived childhood). Wilmer (born 1874) was originally from Massachusetts and had moved to Canada around 1896, and was of English and Irish ancestry. Arzélie was born in Buckingham, Quebec in 1877; her family, the Filions, had arrived in Quebec in the 17th century. Wilmer and Arzélie married in 1898, and shortly after moved to Sudbury, Ontario for work. Soon after Blake&#x27;s birth the family moved to Coniston, as the mine Wilmer had been working at was slowly closing.

==Playing career==

Blake played junior and senior hockey in the Sudbury area and was part of the 1932 Memorial Cup champions, the Sudbury Cub Wolves. He played for the Hamilton Tigers of the Ontario Hockey Association during the 1934–35 season before he signed with the Montreal Maroons of the National Hockey League on February 22, 1935; he made his NHL debut two days later on February 24, against the Chicago Black Hawks. Blake played eight games with the Maroons in the 1934–35 season, but was held scoreless; he did not play in any of the team&#x27;s playoff games, but when the Maroons won the Stanley Cup, Blake&#x27;s name was added to the trophy. Blake then played for the Canadiens until his retirement in 1948. He won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player in 1938–39; that same year he was also the league scoring champion with 47 points. For the last eight seasons, he was team captain, and led the Canadiens to Stanley Cups in 1944 and 1946. In the latter year, in which he incurred only one minor penalty, he became the first Canadien ever to win the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for sportsmanship, which only Mats Näslund has replicated since as of 2022 (in 1987–88).

While playing with the Canadiens, he was part of a trio called the &quot;Punch Line,&quot; with Elmer Lach at centre and Maurice Richard at right wing. He scored the Stanley Cup-clinching goal in the 1944 Stanley Cup Finals at 9:12 of the first overtime of game four, helping the Canadiens complete a four-game sweep of the Chicago Blackhawks. The following season, the Punch Line became the second set of linemates ever to finish first, second, and third in NHL scoring in one season (Lach had 80 points, Richard 73, and Blake 67). They followed the Boston Bruins&#x27; Kraut Line of 1939–40, and would be followed by the Detroit Red Wings&#x27; Production Line in 1949–50.

During a loss to the New York Rangers on January 11, 1948, Blake collided with Rangers&#x27; skater Bill Juzda, awkwardly hit the boards and suffered a double fracture of his ankle, ending his NHL career. In 1998, he was ranked number 66 on &quot;The Hockey News&quot;’ list of the NHL&#x27;s 100 greatest players of all time to date. At the time of his retirement from the NHL Blake was second all-time in career scoring with 527 points, 21 points behind Bill Cowley for the all-time record. He had the all-time record for career points in the playoffs with 62 points in 58 games.

==Coaching career==
After eight years coaching several of the Canadiens&#x27; minor-league affiliates, he was named head coach of the Canadiens on June 8, 1955, replacing Dick Irvin. Blake was fluently bilingual in English and French, and Canadiens management also felt that Richard&#x27;s former linemate was better suited to control the star&#x27;s explosive temper (which had led to a riot the past spring).

Blake coached the Canadiens for thirteen years, winning the Stanley Cup eight times — the most titles for any coach in the team&#x27;s history, the most with one team, and second-most league-wide behind Scotty Bowman, who won nine Stanley Cups in total (five Cups with the Canadiens, one with the Pittsburgh Penguins, and three with the Detroit Red Wings.) His 500 regular-season wins are still the most in Canadiens history. Notably, he won championships in each of his first five seasons as a head coach, this streak being an NHL record that stands to this day. The only other person to have performed a similar feat in his first five seasons as a coach or manager of any particular team in North American professional sports is Casey Stengel of the New York Yankees, although unlike Blake&#x27;s case the Yankees were not the first team Stengel managed.

Blake retired after the Habs clinched the Cup in game four of the 1968 Finals, ending 33 consecutive years at ice level with the Canadiens organization.

Blake turned down Jacques Plante&#x27;s request to wear a mask during games for fear that it would impair his vision. However, after a shot from Rangers player Andy Bathgate broke Plante&#x27;s nose in a game on November 1, 1959, Blake finally relented.

==Personal life==
Born in what is now the ghost town of Victoria Mines, Blake was raised playing outdoor hockey in the town of Coniston near the city of Sudbury in Northern Ontario.

His nickname came from a childhood experience: his younger sister had difficulty pronouncing his name, rendering it as something like &quot;Hec-toe&quot;. Thus, the nickname &quot;Toe&quot; arose, and ultimately replaced the nickname he had been given as a scorer, the Old Lamplighter, because he often activated the light behind the goal.

After retiring from the Canadiens, Blake and his family resided permanently in Montreal. In 1952, he opened Toe Blake&#x27;s Tavern, at the corner of Guy Street and Saint Catherine Street in Montreal, just a few blocks from the Montreal Forum. The tavern closed in 1983.

Blake suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in his final years. When respected writer Red Fisher visited him in the nursing home in 1989, Blake could not recognize his old friend. Blake died on May 17, 1995, at the age of 82.

He was the uncle of Mike Blake.

===Legacy===
Blake was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1966 in the player category, and was made a Member of the Order of Canada in 1982. A park located next to his Montreal West home is named in his honour.

In 2011, the community centre in Blake&#x27;s hometown of Coniston, Ontario, was renamed the &quot;Toe Blake Memorial Arena&quot; in his honour.

<doc id="1298606" wikidata="Q382198" url="?curid=1298606" title="Terry Kilburn">
<text>Terence E. Kilburn (born 25 November 1926), known for his acting work prior to 1953 as Terry Kilburn, is an English-American actor. Born in London, he moved to Hollywood in the U.S. at the age of 10, and is best known for his roles as a child actor during the Golden Age of Hollywood, in films such as &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1938) and &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; (1939) in the late 1930s and the early 1940s.

==Early life==
Kilburn was born in 1926 in West Ham, Essex, in Greater London to working-class parents Tom and Alice Kilburn.

He did some unpaid acting as a young child, and an agent encouraged him to go to Hollywood. Kilburn and his mother immigrated to the U.S. in 1937, and his father arrived the following year. A talent scout for MGM discovered him rehearsing for Eddie Cantor&#x27;s radio show, and he was cast in the British-set film &quot;Lord Jeff&quot; (1938).

==Career==
===Hollywood and Broadway===
Known for his innocent, dreamy, doe-eyed look, Kilburn achieved fame at the age of 11 portraying Tiny Tim in the 1938 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film version of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, and also as four generations of the Colley family in &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; (1939).

As a child actor, Kilburn also played leading roles in two films which starred Freddie Bartholomew: &quot;Lord Jeff&quot; (1938) and &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot; (1940). He was featured in &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1939) with Basil Rathbone. In addition to &quot;Lord Jeff&quot; (1938), Kilburn worked alongside Mickey Rooney in &quot;Andy Hardy Gets Spring Fever&quot; (1939), &quot;A Yank at Eton&quot; (1942), and &quot;National Velvet&quot; (1944). In 1946 he was Joe, the horse&#x27;s groom, in &quot;Black Beauty&quot;. In his early 20s, in 1947 and 1948, he was in four back-to-back Bulldog Drummond films, as Seymour, a reporter; and in 1950 he had small roles in two seagoing films.

After high school, Kilburn concentrated on stage work, and studied drama at UCLA. He made his Broadway debut, credited as Terrance Kilburn, portraying Eugene Marchbanks in a 1952 revival of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Candida&quot;. He thereafter remained committed to live performances, as both actor and director.

After 1952, Kilburn was credited on screen as Terence Kilburn. His final feature film role was a small part in &quot;Lolita&quot; (1962). Between 1951 and 1969, he was also in nearly a dozen teleplays, television movies, and television series episodes.

===After Hollywood===
From 1970 to 1994, Kilburn was artistic director of Oakland University&#x27;s Meadow Brook Theatre in Rochester, Michigan. Meadow Brook Theatre is Michigan&#x27;s only LORT theatre. It presents classic plays, comedies, and musicals, and is known for its annual production of Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, adapted by Kilburn&#x27;s partner, Charles Nolte.

==Personal life==
Since 1994 Kilburn has resided in Minneapolis, Minnesota. His partner of over 50 years, actor Charles Nolte, died in January 2010.

<doc id="1298622" wikidata="Q3986139" url="?curid=1298622" title="The Bugs Bunny Show">
<text>The Bugs Bunny Show is a long-running American animated anthology television series hosted by Bugs Bunny that was mainly composed of theatrical &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons released by Warner Bros. between 1948 and 1969. The show originally debuted as a primetime half-hour program on ABC in 1960, featuring three theatrical &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoons with new linking sequences produced by the Warner Bros. Cartoons staff.

After two seasons, &quot;The Bugs Bunny Show&quot; moved to Saturday mornings, where it aired in various formats for nearly four decades. The show&#x27;s title and length changed regularly over the years, as did the network: both ABC and CBS broadcast versions of &quot;The Bugs Bunny Show&quot;. In 2000, the series, by then known as &quot;The Bugs Bunny &amp; Tweety Show&quot;, was canceled after the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; libraries became the exclusive property of the Cartoon Network family of cable TV networks in the United States. 

In Canada, reruns of &quot;The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show&quot; were aired on the channels Teletoon and Teletoon&#x27;s sister channel, Teletoon Retro (until 2015 when Teletoon Retro signed off). Prior to Teletoon and Teletoon Retro, CBC Television (1960–1975) and Global Television Network (1978–1982, 1990–2000) aired the show. In Australia, episodes of the show were divided between three networks, with most episodes aired on Nine Network, and some episodes divided between Network Ten, and Seven Network since its debut. In Poland, the show aired on TVP1 from 1979 till 1980 and again from 1991 till 1992. In Asia, the program was aired in Japan and South Korea in the early 1960s and also aired on ABS-CBN and RPN in the Philippines, it was also aired on TPI (now MNCTV) from mid 1990s to early 2000s and RCTI during 2000s in Indonesia as well.

==Broadcast and format history==

===&quot;The Bugs Bunny Show&quot; in prime time, 1960-1962===
The original &quot;Bugs Bunny Show&quot; debuted on ABC prime time in the United States on October 11, 1960, airing on Tuesdays at 7:30 PM ET, under the sponsorship of General Foods (Post cereals, Tang, etc.). Newly-produced linking segments were done for each episode by the Warner Bros. animation staff. Chuck Jones and Friz Freleng produced, directed and created the storyboards for the earliest of these, with Robert McKimson later taking over the direction while Jones and Freleng continued producing and writing. The wraparounds were produced in color, although the original broadcasts of the show were in black-and-white. A total of 52 episodes were made.

Rather than display the full Warner Bros. logo and opening title/credits sequence of each cartoon shown in each episode (as shown in the original theatrical versions and could take up to 20 seconds), new title cards were created to begin each cartoon and displayed for only about five seconds over a newly composed musical cue; the card omitted the Warner Bros. logo and any detailed credits of the animators, simply featuring the title of the cartoon in bold letters on a plain background, the main character of the cartoon standing off to one side and the copyright notice of the cartoon rendered in a smaller font at the bottom, before cutting directly to the opening scene of the cartoon. These cuts were sometimes awkward depending on how the original opening sequence was animated. A general credits line was shown at the end of each full episode: &quot;Stories, Animation, layouts, and backgrounds: Members of Motion Picture Screen Cartoonists Local 839.&quot; (The &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons syndicated to local stations as a package, beginning in the 1950s, generally retained the original opening title sequences as shown in theaters. The current revival of the show on MeTV also uses the original theatrical title cards.)

The show&#x27;s theme song was &quot;This Is It&quot;, written by Mack David and Jerry Livingston (&quot;Overture/curtain, lights/this is it/the night of nights...&quot;). The opening title sequence, animated by Freleng unit animator Gerry Chiniquy, features Bugs and Daffy Duck performing the song in unison. For the final chorus, a lineup of &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters joins Bugs and Daffy onstage (Porky Pig, however, is absent from the procession, although Porky had a spin-off show based on the original &quot;Bugs Bunny Show&quot; 4 years later titled &quot;The Porky Pig Show&quot; which aired on ABC from 1964 to 1967).

&quot;The Bugs Bunny Show&quot; proved beneficial to the Warner Bros. cartoon staff, as it allowed the studio to remain open despite the shrinking market for theatrical animated shorts. The final first-run episode of the original &quot;Bugs Bunny Show&quot; aired on August 7, 1962, and the Warner Bros. animation studio closed the following spring.

===The move to Saturday mornings, 1962–1985===
ABC began re-running &quot;The Bugs Bunny Show&quot; on Saturday mornings in August 1962 until September 1967, when it was moved to Sunday mornings for the remainder of its run. The series was rerun in color beginning in 1965 and remained on ABC until September 1968. At this point, the series switched to CBS, where it was combined with &quot;The Road Runner Show&quot; (which had aired on CBS since 1966) to create &quot;The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour&quot;. The standard &quot;Bugs Bunny Show&quot; opening and the announcer&#x27;s introduction of Bugs Bunny (&quot;that Oscar-winning rabbit!&quot;) were directly followed by the rabbit&#x27;s saying, &quot;...and also starring my fast feathered friend, the Road Runner&quot;, after which &quot;The Road Runner Show&#x27;s&quot; theme was played. &quot;The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour&quot; combined re-edited bridging sequences from both shows to link the seven cartoons featured in each episode. The bridging sequences would be edited further in later versions of the &quot;Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour&quot;.

In 1971, &quot;The Road Runner Show&quot; moved to ABC and a reconstituted half-hour &quot;Bugs Bunny Show&quot; aired on CBS, featuring re-edited versions of the bridging sequences and a different grouping of cartoons. In 1973, &quot;The Bugs Bunny Show&quot; returned to ABC for two seasons, only for CBS to re-acquire both shows and bring back &quot;The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour&quot; in 1975. In 1976, Sylvester and Tweety were featured in their own &quot;Sylvester and Tweety Show&quot; for one year, necessitating the removal of most of the Tweety and/or Sylvester cartoons on &quot;Bugs Bunny/Road Runner&quot; that season. Also that year, a weekly half-hour prime-time edition of &quot;The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Show&quot; briefly aired on CBS&#x27; Tuesday night schedule, from April through June.

&quot;The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour&quot; became &quot;The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Show&quot; in November 1977, after CBS added another half-hour to the runtime. In 1981, a companion &quot;Sylvester &amp; Tweety, Daffy and Speedy Show&quot; was added to the CBS schedule, which included a number of later cartoons produced by a reestablished Warner Bros. Cartoons studio from 1967 to 1969. The following year, this new companion series was canceled and its cartoons were incorporated into &quot;The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Show&quot;, which was broadcast as two separate hour-long programs on Saturday mornings (for the second program, the show&#x27;s opening titles were re-animated). In 1983, CBS returned the show to 90 minutes and the bridging sequences were dropped. The following year, the &quot;This Is It&quot; opening was jettisoned altogether; a new title sequence (created from clips of the cartoons) and new theme song (&quot;It&#x27;s Cartoon Gold&quot;), composed by Steve Zuckerman with lyrics by John Klawitter, introduced the show.

===Final Saturday morning years, 1985–2000===
CBS gave up the rights to broadcast the Warner Bros. cartoons following the 1984–1985 season, and as a result, the show moved back to ABC, where it became &quot;The Bugs Bunny/Looney Tunes Comedy Hour&quot;. Cartoons featuring Tweety or Speedy Gonzales were not broadcast on ABC during the 1985–86 season, the latter presumably due to objections toward Mexican stereotypes. The following year, however, Tweety cartoons were added to the program, which was reduced to a half-hour and renamed &quot;The Bugs Bunny &amp; Tweety Show&quot;. Beginning with its third season, &quot;The Bugs Bunny &amp; Tweety Show&quot; was expanded to a full hour and the original &quot;This Is It&quot; theme was reintroduced with similar animation as the original, accompanied by the introductory sequence introduced in 1982. Another version of the &quot;This Is It&quot; opening sequence was done in 1992, with different character animations.

Though the program did not qualify for the educational/informational designation, it nonetheless remained on Saturday mornings after the new designation debuted in 1996, one of the few non-E/I programs to survive the rules changes. The previous year, ABC was bought by The Walt Disney Company, and &quot;The Bugs Bunny &amp; Tweety Show&quot; was the only non-Disney cartoon to remain on the lineup, due to their contract not being up yet, and was in the first few years of the Disney&#x27;s One Saturday Morning block starting in 1997 (with the Disney logo omitted from the blocks bumpers during the show). The program was often paired with ABC&#x27;s in-house &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot; shorts during this time.

The hour-long &quot;Bugs Bunny &amp; Tweety Show&quot; remained on the air until 1999, when it was again reduced to a half-hour. In 2000, Warner Bros. made the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies film library exclusive to Cartoon Network, which Time Warner owned as part of the purchase of Turner Broadcasting in 1996. As a result, &quot;The Bugs Bunny Show&quot; ended its nearly four-decade-long network run, one of the longest runs in the history of United States network television. Outside cartoons in the public domain, Warner Bros. cartoons would not return to American broadcast television until the 2021 debut of &quot;Toon In with Me&quot; on MeTV, along with a companion Saturday morning block.

==Legacy==
This show is credited for keeping the Warner Bros. cartoons made during the Golden Age of American animation a part of the American consciousness. The show ran for almost four decades, helping inspire animators, comedians, historians, and others who watched Saturday morning television.

The &quot;This Is It&quot; song&#x27;s fame is such that it has been used elsewhere, such as in the Canadian province of Ontario where it was used in a TV commercial promoting the various performing arts tourist attractions, where artists of various disciplines sing separate lines of the song. 

When Warner Bros. released their video series &quot;Golden Jubilee&quot; in 1985, featuring the classic cartoons, the opening sequence shows Taz maniacally riding a motorcycle down a city street chased by a police car. He makes a sharp turn into a theater, where the rest of the Looney Tune Characters are performing to the &quot;Bugs Bunny Show&quot; tune.

Beginning in January 2021, the original &quot;This Is It&quot; opening sequence was included in &quot;Bugs Bunny and Friends&quot;, part of MeTV&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Morning Cartoons&quot; block.

In the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The Opera&quot;, as Jerry and Elaine are waiting outside the opera house, Jerry starts singing &quot;This is it&quot; to pass the time to which Elaine laments to him by saying, &quot;You know, it is so sad that all of your knowledge of high culture comes from Bugs Bunny cartoons.&quot;

== Animated sequences produced for the show ==

A series of short animated scenes were produced for the show, featured &quot;linking&quot; moments during the main theater setting of the show. Some of these scenes included:
* The opening teaser showed Bugs and Daffy performing a duet about the start of the cartoon show; as they sing it, in the background crossing the stage are some of co-stars&#x27; regulars: Tweety; Speedy Gonzales; Pepé Le Pew; Sylvester the Cat; the Road Runner; Hippety Hopper; Yosemite Sam; Elmer Fudd; Wile E. Coyote; Foghorn Leghorn.
* A frustrated Daffy bickering on stage with Bugs. Daffy declares, &quot;&quot;Last&quot; week you said you were going to introduce me &quot;next&quot; week!&quot; Bugs replies, &quot;Right...but this isn&#x27;t next week, is it?&quot; Daffy trips himself up and replies, &quot;You&#x27;re doggone tootin&#x27; is isn&#x27;t! This is &quot;this&quot; week! And next week is uhhh...ummm...sheesh!&quot;
* A barking sheepdog wanders into the theater, saying &quot;Which way did he go? Where&#x27;s the little bunny I saw on TV last week?&quot; Daffy, at this time, has dressed up in a rabbit costume and is on stage pretending to be Bugs. The sheepdog pounces upon Daffy and exclaims, &quot;At last, at last! I have caught a bunny rabbit!&quot;
* Bugs entertains the audience by playing a guitar. An angry Yosemite Sam barges in the theater shouting, &quot;Can&#x27;t ya see I&#x27;m tryin&#x27; to sleep?!?&quot;, snatches the guitar from Bugs, and snaps all of its strings but one.
* Bugs demonstrates some cartoon physics, including slow-motion, fast-speed and &quot;vibrating to a stop.&quot;

The show&#x27;s title sequences and some of these linking material scenes from the original &quot;Bugs Bunny Show&quot; are included as bonus features on each volume of the &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection&quot; DVD collection (with the exception of Volume 6). As the original color negatives were cut up by CBS and ABC to create later versions of the show, the linking sequences are presented on DVD using a combination of footage from both what&#x27;s left of the color negatives (some of which were used in later incarnations, thus helping to preserve them) and the black-and-white ABC broadcast prints prepared in the early 1960s.

On the &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 2&quot;, the opening to the &quot;Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Show&quot; (with the announcer calling it the &quot;Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour&quot;) and two openings to the &quot;Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show&quot; (the 1988 opening and the 1992 opening) were released as special features.

In 2009, an episode of the &quot;Bugs Bunny Show&quot; in color was released on the Saturday Morning Cartoons 1960s Volume 2 set. Saturday Morning Cartoons 1970s Volume 2 includes an episode of the &quot;Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Show&quot;.

<doc id="1298629" wikidata="Q2038409" url="?curid=1298629" title="Indexation">
<text>Indexation is a technique to adjust income payments by means of a price index, in order to maintain the purchasing power of the public after inflation, while deindexation is the unwinding of indexation. It is often used to make sure regular payments, such as pension payments keep pace with inflation, so that they have the same value in real terms over time.

==Overview==
From a macroeconomics standpoint there are four main categories of indexation:

# wage indexation,
# financial instruments rate indexation,
# tax rate indexation, and
# exchange rate indexation.

The first three are indexed to inflation. The last one is typically indexed to a foreign currency, mainly the US dollar. Any of these different types of indexation can be reversed (deindexation).

Applying a cost-of-living escalation COLA clause to a stream of periodic payments protects the real value of those payments and effectively transfers the risk of inflation from the payee to the payor, who must pay more each year to reflect the increases in prices. Thus, inflation indexation is often applied to pension payments, rents and other situations which are not subject to regular re-pricing in the market.

COLA is not CPI, which is an aggregate indicator. Using CPI as a COLA salary adjustment for taxable income fails to recognize that increases are generally taxed at the highest marginal tax rate whereas an individual&#x27;s rising costs are paid with after-tax dollars - dollars commensurate with an individual&#x27;s average after-tax level. Indexing tax brackets does not address this fundamental issue but it does effectively eliminate &quot;bracket-creep&quot;.
Indexation has been very important in high-inflation environments, and was known as monetary correction &quot;&quot; in Brazil from 1964 to 1994. Some countries have cut back significantly in the use of indexation and cost-of-living escalation clauses, first by applying only partial protection for price increases and eventually eliminating such protection altogether when inflation is brought down to single digits.

Protecting one of the parties from the risk of inflation means that the price risk must be shifted to another party. For example, if state pensions are adjusted for inflation, the price risk is passed from the pensioners to the taxpayers.

==Wages==
When a government decides to index wages of government employees to inflation it is to transfer the risk of inflation away from government workers onto the government. Such a policy is to attempt to reduce inflationary expectation and in turn inflation when it is rising rapidly. Research by economists is ambivalent on the success of such policies. Some have deemed it a success including Friedman (1974), Gray (1976), and Fischer (1977). Others have considered it less successful as they observed that indexation breeds inflation inertia (a reduction in the government and the central bank&#x27;s effort in fighting inflation leading to inflation rate remaining higher than targeted). This perspective is supported by Bonomo and Garcia (1994).

The economists diverging opinions on the merit of indexation often depend on what data they looked at. A given country over a specific time series may have been successful conducting indexation. While another country at another time may have been less successful. Some economists believe there are appropriate times for indexation (when inflation is really high) and times for deindexation (when inflation has moderated after indexation, but remains still too high vs the central bank&#x27;s inflation target).

In recent years Brazil, Chile, Israel, and Mexico have implemented successful inflation fighting campaigns by implementing the deindexation of wages (Lefort and Schmidt-Hebbel, 2002).

==Debt==
The indexation of government debt to inflation is related to transferring the inflation risk from depositors to the government in an attempt to reduce inflation. Some governments have ultimately subjected their short-term debt instruments to deindexation so their central bank could regain control of short-term interest rates from a monetary policy standpoint and be in a better position to fight inflation. Another objective of indexation, for certain governments with already low inflation rate, is to reduce their borrowing cost by paying lower interest rates to depositors in exchange for assuming inflation risk. Both the UK and the US have issued inflation indexed government bonds to reduce their borrowing costs. When governments such as the UK and the US issue both inflation indexed bonds and regular nominal bonds, it gives them precise information on inflation expectation by observing the difference in yields between the two types of bonds. Robert Shiller has done extensive research on all mentioned aspects of government bond indexation.

==Tax rate==
The indexation of tax rate is to avoid an increase in effective and marginal tax rates due to inflation pushing taxpayers taxable income into higher tax brackets even though their pre tax purchasing power has not changed. Tax codes of various countries can be very complicated. As a result, certain types of taxes may be partially or entirely subject to deindexation even though the main tax rate structure is not. This is the case in the US where the standard tax rate is indexed to inflation. But, its parallel Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) code is not. As a result, a rising share of the taxpayers’ population is anticipated to become liable under the AMT which was originally implemented to tax only the very rich.(On January 2, 2013, President Barack Obama signed the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which indexes to inflation the income thresholds for being subject to the tax.[1]) In Canada, a recent reduction in tax rate was in part countered by a partial deindexation of certain credits (the credits were adjusted upward by the inflation rate – 3%).

==Currency==
The indexation of currency or exchange rate often refers to a country pegging its currency to the US dollar. In other words, such a country&#x27;s central bank would buy or sell dollars so as to maintain a stable exchange rate with the dollar. Such a policy has been adopted by several Asian countries including China. If not for the mentioned pegging, the currencies of these countries would rise against the dollar as a result of the US chronic current account deficit with such countries. But, the Asian countries have a vested economic interest in keeping US demand for their exports high. That&#x27;s where the pegging of their currency to the US dollar comes in. Often the pegging conducted by central banks is pretty discrete and not disclosed in any formal policy statement. The pegging also can be pretty elastic. A central bank will maintain an exchange rate within a deemed acceptable range instead of at a specific level. Over time, the acceptable range may broaden or narrow depending on such a country&#x27;s economy overall reliance on exports to fuel growth. Thus, it is challenging to clearly observe the deindexation of a currency.

<doc id="1298631" wikidata="Q187450" url="?curid=1298631" title="Philippe Senderos">
<text>Philippe Sylvain Senderos (; born 14 February 1985) is a Swiss retired professional footballer who played as a defender.

Senderos began his career at Servette, before moving to England as a teenager with Arsenal. He made 116 appearances over seven seasons with the North London club, and won the FA Cup in 2005. Following loans to Milan and Everton, he then moved to Fulham on a free transfer in 2010, where he played for four seasons. Senderos then had brief spells at clubs in Spain, England, Scotland, Switzerland and the United States.

A full Swiss international from 2005 to 2016, Senderos won 57 caps and scored 5 goals. He was included in the Swiss squads for three FIFA World Cups and at UEFA Euro 2008.

==Club career==

===Servette===
Senderos came up through the youth team set up at Swiss club Servette. After a few appearances in his first season, he soon became a regular player in the first team. On 27 July 2002, Senderos scored a brace (and his first goal) in a 2–0 win over Luzern. Senderos signed for Arsenal in December 2002, though he remained working at Servette until the following summer. Shortly after joining Arsenal, Senderos&#x27; father and agent said Senderos rejected a move to Real Madrid in favour of joining Arsenal. Senderos himself claimed he made the right decision joining the Gunners.

===Arsenal===
Shortly after joining Arsenal, Senderos&#x27; start did not come as planned after he suffered a recurrence of a back problem for six weeks and another injury on a fractured bone in his foot, leaving him out for the rest of the season. During the season, Arsenal went undefeated and won the league.

Senderos was an unused substitute when Arsenal won the Community Shield against Manchester United ahead of the 2004–05 season. He made his debut as a starter in a 2–1 win against Manchester City in the third round of the League Cup on 27 October 2004, and played his first Premier League match on 1 January 2005 as an 82nd-minute substitute for the injured Sol Campbell. Profiting from Campbell&#x27;s injury, Senderos finished his first Premier League season with 13 appearances. Despite Campbell&#x27;s recovery, Senderos played the 2005 FA Cup final in his place, and won his first piece of silverware as Arsenal triumphed on penalties after a 0–0 draw with Manchester United.

After the season, Senderos committed his long-term future by signing an improved five-year deal. In the 2005 FA Community Shield, he was beaten by Didier Drogba for both goals as Arsenal lost 2–1 to Chelsea. During the 2005–06 season, he scored his first Arsenal goal in a 2–1 loss to West Bromwich Albion on 15 October, and again in a 7–0 win over Middlesbrough on 14 January. He played in Arsenal&#x27;s run to the final of the UEFA Champions League in 2005–06, but was an unused substitute in the final, which Arsenal lost to Barcelona.

On 29 November 2006, Senderos was sent off for the first time in his career, in the 66th minute of Arsenal&#x27;s 2–1 loss at Fulham for two bookings for offences on Luís Boa Morte. Later in the season, on 3 February 2007, he was sent off for the second time, a straight red card for a foul in the penalty box on Middlesbrough striker Yakubu.

Senderos received his third red card on 2 September 2007 after denying Nwankwo Kanu of Portsmouth a clear goalscoring opportunity, although Arsenal went on to win 3–1. In his last full season at the club (2007–08), Senderos added 2 more goals from 17 Premier League appearances: in a 3–2 win against Sunderland on 7 October and the fourth minute of a 2–0 win over Blackburn Rovers on 11 February.

====Loan to AC Milan====
Senderos eventually fell out of favour with Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger. On 27 August 2008, he joined Italian club AC Milan on a season-long loan. Senderos described joining Milan as a &quot;dream come true&quot;. He quickly incurred an injury and struggled to make the first team ahead of centre-backs Paolo Maldini and Kakha Kaladze, but finally made his first full appearance for the &quot;Rossoneri&quot; in a UEFA Cup group stage match against Braga, and came on as a substitute for his first Serie A appearance, against Fiorentina, approximately halfway through the season. Despite wanting his move at Milan to be permanent, Senderos returned to Arsenal after 14 Serie A appearances.

====Loan to Everton====
Senderos made only two appearances for Arsenal in 2009–10, both in the League Cup, and on 25 January 2010, he joined Everton on loan for the remainder of the season, where he wore the number 23, vacated by the departure of Lucas Neill. He made his first appearance for the club in a 1–0 win away against Wigan Athletic. He returned to Arsenal at the end of the season having made only three appearances, two in the Premier League and one in the UEFA Europa League.

===Fulham and Valencia===

On 8 June 2010, Senderos signed a three-year deal with Fulham on a free transfer. On 9 August, while training, Senderos tore his Achilles tendon, keeping him out for six months. He underwent surgery and was expected to be out for 6 months. He finally made his debut for Fulham on 30 April 2011 against Sunderland. On 21 April 2012, he scored his first Premier League goal since joining Fulham as they defeated Wigan Athletic 2–1 at Craven Cottage.

On 1 March 2013, Senderos signed a one-year contract extension, keeping him at the West London club until June 2014. On 21 October 2013, he scored a goal in a 4–1 win over Crystal Palace.

On 31 January 2014, Senderos joined Valencia from Fulham with just hours remaining before the transfer window was due to close. He made his Valencia debut on 8 February 2014, playing 81 minutes in the 5–0 home win over Real Betis in a La Liga match, and scored his first goal (a header) on 13 March in the 3–0 away victory over Bulgarian champions Ludogorets Razgrad in the first leg of the round of 16 of the UEFA Europa League.

===Aston Villa===

On 5 June 2014, Senderos joined Aston Villa on a two-year contract. He was signed by Paul Lambert, who said in the run-up to the 2014 FIFA World Cup, &quot;This will be Philippe&#x27;s third World Cup finals and there aren&#x27;t too many players who compete at that level over that stretch of time. He&#x27;ll be a great addition to the group.&quot; He made his Premier League debut for Villa in a 1–0 win at Stoke City on 16 August, playing the full 90 minutes.

On 3 September 2015, it was announced Senderos had been omitted from Aston Villa&#x27;s 25-man squad for the first half of the 2015–16 Premier League season. The following 27 January 2016, he left the club by mutual consent.

===Grasshoppers and Rangers===
On 29 January 2016, just days after being released by Aston Villa, Senderos returned to his native Switzerland to sign for Grasshoppers on a six-month contract.

After being released by Grasshoppers, Senderos signed for Scottish Premiership team Rangers on a one-year deal on 31 August 2016, following a lengthy trial period. Upon signing, he said it was a &quot;no-brainer&quot; to join such a big club. Senderos was sent off on his debut for Rangers, a 5–1 defeat at Celtic in the Old Firm match on 10 September. Senderos was released in May 2017.

===Houston Dynamo and Chiasso===
On 7 August 2017, the Houston Dynamo of Major League Soccer (MLS) announced they had signed Senderos. Senderos made just two appearances in the regular season for a Dynamo squad that finished fourth in the Western Conference. However, injuries to first choice defenders A. J. DeLaGarza and Leonardo opened the door for Senderos to play for Houston in the postseason. Senderos was given the captain&#x27;s armband by manager Wilmer Cabrera in the second leg of Houston&#x27;s semi-final matchup away to the Portland Timbers, which Houston won 2–1 to advance to the Western Conference Finals.

Senderos scored in a 4–0 over Atlanta United in the 2018 season opener. However, he picked up a hamstring injury the next week that made him miss 10 games. On 3 July, Senderos scored in the 96th minute to give the Dynamo a 2–2 draw with LAFC. During the next game Senderos got a brace to lead Houston to a 3–0 win over Minnesota United. He would appear in every game of the 2018 U.S. Open Cup as he helped the Dynamo win their first such title in club history. He picked up a hamstring injury in the final that forced him to miss the rest of the season. His contract expired at the end of the 2018 season and the Dynamo decided to not re-sign him.

On 10 September 2019, Senderos signed with Swiss Challenge League side Chiasso. He made his debut for Chiasso on 9 November in a 4–1 win over FC Wil. On 16 December, he announced his retirement from football.

==International career==
Senderos is a former youth international and has played at all levels of football from the under-15s upward for Switzerland, though he was also eligible to play for Spain or Serbia through his parents. He was captain of the Swiss under-17 squad that won the 2002 UEFA European Under-17 Championship.

Senderos made his full international debut on 26 March 2005 in Switzerland&#x27;s 0–0 draw against France in Paris. On his fifth cap, away to Cyprus on 7 September 2005, he scored his first international goal by opening a 3–1 win. On 12 November 2005, he opened the scoring in Switzerland&#x27;s win over Turkey in the play-offs. After playing in Switzerland&#x27;s successful qualifying campaign, he was named in their 2006 FIFA World Cup squad. He started alongside Patrick Müller in all three of Switzerland&#x27;s group matches, and scored the first goal of the 2–0 win in the third match, against South Korea. He broke his nose and suffered shoulder ligament damage in the match, which ruled him out of the remainder of Switzerland&#x27;s World Cup campaign.

Senderos captained Switzerland for the first time on 6 February 2008, a 2–1 friendly defeat away to England in which he was substituted after 55 minutes for Stéphane Grichting. Senderos was also part of the Swiss squad at the UEFA Euro 2008 finals, appearing in all three group matches as the team failed to qualify for the knockout stages.

Senderos scored a brace in a 3–0 win away against Luxembourg in a 2010 World Cup qualifier on 10 October 2009, and was selected in the Swiss final squad for the 2010 World Cup. In the first match, where Switzerland shocked Spain 1–0, he was substituted in the 36th minute after injuring his ankle seriously in an accidental collision with teammate Stephan Lichtsteiner. Swiss head coach Ottmar Hitzfeld said after the match, &quot;He has a sprained ankle, possibly a ruptured ligament. If that is the case, it would be very difficult to replace him.&quot;

Senderos was also chosen in the Swiss squad for the 2014 World Cup, his third World Cup. He made his first appearance in the second match, against France on 20 June 2014, replacing the injured Steve von Bergen after nine minutes, as Switzerland lost 5–2.

Senderos was omitted from the Switzerland squad for Euro 2016.

==Personal life==
Philippe Senderos is a son of Serbian Orthodox (Zorica Novković) mother and Spanish Catholic (Julián Senderos) father. His brother Julien was a professional basketball player until 2011. On 20 July 2009, Senderos married Sara, an English woman of Iranian descent. Senderos speaks seven languages: English, French, Serbian, Spanish, German, Italian and Persian.

In 2012, Senderos was the victim of issued fake news from Turkey and Iran claiming that he had converted to Islam; he responded &quot;That&#x27;s not true. And I don&#x27;t know where these rumours could have come from. I did a photo once [the one used by the websites] but that&#x27;s all&quot;.

<doc id="1298633" wikidata="Q5374724" url="?curid=1298633" title="Empty Souls">
<text>&quot;Empty Souls&quot; is a song by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers. It was released in January 2005 by record label Epic as the second and final single taken from their seventh studio album, &quot;Lifeblood&quot;. The song debuted and peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart and reached number 18 in Ireland.

==Content==
&quot;Empty Souls&quot; is said to be the political response from the band in relation to the September 11 attacks.

The single edit features a lyric that was changed from the album version. The chorus line on the album version runs &quot;collapsing like the Twin Towers&quot;, but for the single it was changed to &quot;collapsing like dying flowers&quot;. The backing vocals can still be heard to sing the original line, although this may have been kept in by mistake.

The music video for the song sees the band separated throughout, only to meet up at the end after treks through various parts of Berlin, Germany.

==Release==
&quot;Empty Souls&quot; was released on 10 January 2005 by record label Epic as the second and final single from the band&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Lifeblood&quot;. The single reached number two on the UK Singles Chart, missing out on becoming the 1,000th number one in UK chart history to the latest in a series of Elvis number-one single re-issues making the top of the charts at the time.

The DVD version of the single features two new songs which are both sung entirely by the band&#x27;s bassist, Nicky Wire. The music for &quot;Dying Breeds&quot; is also entirely written by him, and the music for &quot;Failure Bound&quot; is the track &quot;No Jubilees&quot; played backwards. The video for &quot;Dying Breeds&quot; was directed by Wire&#x27;s brother Patrick Jones, who made similar short videos for album tracks such as &quot;1985&quot;.

<text>is a Japanese multinational food and biotechnology corporation which produces seasonings, interlayer insulating materials for semiconductor packages for use in personal computers, cooking oils, frozen foods, beverages, sweeteners, amino acids, and pharmaceuticals. is the trade name for the company&#x27;s original monosodium glutamate (MSG) product, the first of its kind, since 1909. The corporation&#x27;s head office is located in Chūō, Tokyo. Ajinomoto operates in 34 countries worldwide and employs an estimated 34,615 people. Its yearly revenue in 2023 is around ¥1.44 trillion JPY or $9.1 billion USD.

==History==
===1907–1944: Origins and expansion===

Ajinomoto Co., Inc. was created in 1908 as a subsidiary of Suzuki Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., which was founded in May 1907 by Saburosuke Suzuki II and Kikunae Ikeda. Ajinomoto was created to let Ikeda, a professor at Tokyo Imperial University, sell monosodium glutamate (MSG) seasoning made from wheat that he invented and patented. He created the seasoning after discovering that MSG was the source of a flavor that he called umami. In April 1909, Ajinomoto presented Ikeda&#x27;s seasoning under the brand name &quot;AJI-NO-MOTO&quot; at a new product exhibition event in Tokyo, and began selling the product the next month. Ajinomoto primarily marketed the seasoning to housewives by using their trademark, a housewife in an apron, in newspaper advertisements, on signboards, and on-ground stamps.

Output gradually increased from 4.7 tons in 1910 to 23.3 tons in 1913, with sales reaching 400,000 yen. In 1914 Ajinomoto built a new factory in Kawasaki to expand its production of flavoring. Japan&#x27;s improved economy after World War I resulted in output hitting 84.6 tons and sales reaching 1,563,000 yen in 1918. Despite rising sales, Ajinomoto experienced a deficit during its first ten years due to altering its methods of production and lowering its prices to get its product into ordinary households, among other reasons. Because of rising Japanese exports after World War I, Ajinomoto opened offices in New York and Shanghai in 1917 and 1918, respectively. In 1918 Ajinomoto exported 20.5 tons of its seasoning, accounting for a quarter of its total sales. The company opened new offices in Singapore and Hong Kong in 1927 and in Taiwan in 1929 to distribute its product throughout Southeast Asia. Between 1920 and 1929, revenue from the seasoning&#x27;s sales rose from 2,799 thousand yen to 10,543 thousand yen, largely due to increased exports of the product to foreign markets.

To lower the cost of mass production, the seasoning&#x27;s wheat was replaced with soybeans, as the price of the latter at the time was lower than the former&#x27;s. In the United States, the seasoning, labeled by the FDA as a &quot;Vegetable Protein Derivative&quot;, sold poorly on the consumer market, but Ajinomoto expanded their operations in the United States in 1931 due to mass orders of the seasoning by H.J. Heinz, Co. and Campbell Soup Co. Between 1931 and 1937, seasoning production increased from 1,077 tons to 3,750 tons, with revenue rising from 13 million yen to 27 million yen. Due to Japan&#x27;s increasing isolationism in the late 1930s, the production of AJI-NO-MOTO decreased from 3,750 tons in 1937 to 2,339 tons in 1940. By 1942, production of the seasoning was reduced to 1,000 tons before completely stopping by 1944 due to World War II.

===1945–1979: Post-war Japan and diversification===
After World War II, Ajinomoto was slow to resume production of its seasoning as it lacked sufficient funds to continue production and its factory had been destroyed. In April 1946, the company changed its name to Ajinomoto Co., Ltd. In 1947 production of the seasoning resumed, in addition to the production of new food products such as nucleic acid-based seasonings and processed foods. In May 1949 Ajinomoto was listed on the Japanese stock exchange. By 1950, exports accounted for 95% of the company&#x27;s revenue, with exports to Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States increasing in subsequent years. In Europe, AJI-NO-MOTO was used as a seasoning by many processed food manufacturers, including Maggi and C.H. Knorr AG. In 1950, sales in Japan resumed after the lifting of postwar sales controls, surpassing pre-war sales by 1953.

In the 1960s, Ajinomoto began to diversify its production by securing alliances with international food companies, including the Kellogg Company in 1962, CPC International Inc. in 1963, and Best Foods Company Ltd. in 1964. Because of these partnerships, Ajinomoto began selling Kellogg&#x27;s corn flakes and Knorr soup in Japan and created its own brand of mayonnaise. During this time period, Ajinomoto modified AJI-NO-MOTO&#x27;s recipe by using amino acids from sugar cane instead of soybeans, which allowed the seasoning to be produced locally in the countries it was exported to, which reduced shipping costs for the company. Domestic production first began in Thailand in 1962, followed by the Philippines, Malaysia, Peru, Indonesia, and Brazil in subsequent years. By 1979, nearly half of all AJI-NO-MOTO was being produced outside of Japan.

In the 1970s, Ajinomoto diversified further by launching a flavored seasoning called HON-DASHI in 1970 and producing frozen foods in 1972. In 1973 Ajinomoto and General Foods Inc. launched Ajinomoto General Foods Inc., a joint venture between the two companies that would sell instant coffee. In 1978, Ajinomoto launched a brand of Chinese seasonings under the brand name &quot;Cook Do&quot;. In Asian and Latin American markets, Ajinomoto created new products for consumers, while the company primarily delivered its products to processed food manufacturers in Europe and the United States.

During this era, the company also expanded into other product markets. In 1956, the company began supplying crystalline amino acids for pharmaceutical use, contributing to the world&#x27;s first release of amino acids infusion. In the 1960s and 1970s, the company developed feed-use amino acids, pharmaceuticals such as enteral nutrients, and specialty chemicals like surfactants.

===1980–2009: Expansion globally===
As the Japanese economy worsened in the 1980s, Ajinomoto sought to outsource more of its production overseas, which increased the number of employees the company employed overseas from 4,000 in 1979 to more than 11,000 in 1996. Starting in 1980, Ajinomoto began to refocus its diversification efforts from food products to its amino acid business. Following the US FDA&#x27;s re-approval of aspartame in 1981, Ajinomoto began producing the sweetener at its Tokai factory in 1982. In 1987, Ajinomoto began researching drug development in the fields of clinical nutrition, anti-cancer drugs, infectious diseases, and cardiovascular drugs. Through this research, the company developed ELENTAL for use in clinical nutrition, LIVACT to fight liver disease, and Lentinan in collaboration with the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research. Ajinomoto later released JINO as a cosmetic and amino acid for athletes, followed by Amino Vital, a supplement to JINO released in 1995. In 2000, Ajinomoto acquired NutraSweet and Euro-Aspartame from Monsanto.

In April 2002 Ajinomoto reorganized itself into food, amino acid, and medicine divisions, and owned subsidiaries for frozen foods, fats, and oils. In February 2003, Ajinomoto and Unilever completed a joint venture agreement in six countries and regions of Asia. Because of this, Ajinomoto launched the brand VONO to replace its use of the Knorr brand, and in the process established its own brand identity. In July 2003, Ajinomoto bought the French company Orsan from the UK-based Tate and Lyle Group, renaming Orsan to AJI-NO-MOTO Foods, Europe. In November 2005, AJI-NO-MOTO Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. was liquidated, and its assets and functions were merged into AJI-NO-MOTO Pharmaceuticals, Europe. In January 2006, Ajinomoto bought the cooking sauce and condiments manufacturer Amoy Food from the French dairy company Groupe Danone. In 2009, the company released &quot;Ajinomoto&quot; to commemorate the 100th anniversary of its foundation.

===Since 2010: Expansion and restructuring===

In 2010, due to a rise in foreign competition, Ajinomoto began restructuring to focus on several of its products while divesting others. The company divested its Calpis beverage unit in Japan in 2012, the Ajinomoto Sweetener Company (France) in October 2015, and Amoy Food (China) in November 2018. Ajinomoto decided to focus on its food and biomedical divisions, and acquired the contract manufacturing organization Althea Technologies (USA) in 2013, the frozen food company Windsor Quality Holdings, Inc. (USA) in November 2014, and the frozen food company Lavelli・Terrell・Smile (France) in November 2017. In April 2016, Ajinomoto merged its pharmaceutical division with Eisai, launching in Japan. In October 2017, Ajinomoto introduced a &quot;Global Brand Logo&quot; for use throughout the Ajinomoto group. In December 2017, Ajinomoto announced it had begun construction to expand its Kawasaki Plant, along with the construction of a new R&amp;D building. In October 2018, Ajinomoto Althea (USA) and OmniChem (Belgium) merged to form Ajinomoto Bio-Pharma Services.

In April 2020, the Ajinomoto Group Nutrient Profiling System for Product, which has been developed as a method to scientifically estimate the nutritive value of products such as powdered soup and frozen foods, was introduced globally to about 500 kinds of group products in seven countries. In August, Ajinomoto announced its participation in the international environment initiative RE100 for renewable energy.

In November 2020, &quot;AJISWEET RA&quot;, produced in Japan cooperating with Morita Kagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd., was newly launched to the USA as stevia sweetener reducing bitterness and off-flavors. In December, Ajinomoto Group made a wholly owned supplement company in Ireland by a share purchase agreement with Nualtra Limited in order to enter Europe&#x27;s oral nutritional supplements market.

In December 2020, Ajinomoto was included by CDP in its &quot;Climate Change A List for 2020&quot; for the first time, as one of the most outstanding companies in terms of climate change-related initiatives and information disclosure for its climate impact. in 2021, Ajinomoto joined WIPO GREEN as an official partner in an effort to address climate change.

In February 2021, Ajinomoto Animal Nutrition Group Inc. transferred all of its 100% equity stake in Ajinomoto Animal Nutrition Europe S.A., a European feed-use amino acid company, to METabolic EXplorer, a French operating company with strengths in R&amp;D of fermentation technologies.

On the Tokyo Nutrition Summit 2021, held on December 7–8, 2021, Ajinomoto announced its Nutrition Commitment, a specific goal for improving nutrition, and registered it on the commitment registration website (Global Nutrition Report) on October 26.

Ajinomoto Co., Inc. has planned and resolved the MediumTerm ASV Management 2030 Roadmap at its Board of Directors Meeting of February 28, 2023.

In May 2023, Ajinomoto signed a letter of intent for a strategic alliance with Solar Foods, a company that developed Solein, a microbial protein feeding on CO2 as a nutrient source, and obtained a marketing license in Singapore.

In November 2023, Ajinomoto acquired US-based Forge Biologics for $620 million.

In February 2024, Ajinomoto was selected by CDP, an international environmental not-for-profit charity, for its &quot;Climate Change A-List&quot; for fiscal 2023. This is the fourth consecutive year that Ajinomoto has been selected for the A-list.

=== Food products ===
In 1909, Ajinomoto Co. Inc. released its umami seasoning AJI-NO-MOTO, made from molasses and tapioca starch derived from sugarcane. In Asia and Latin America, the product was primarily sold to consumers, while in North America and Europe it was mostly sold to processed food manufacturers. In 1970, Ajinomoto launched the bonito flavored seasoning HON-DASHI in Japan, and later adapted the product to other markets with local flavors. In 1978 Ajinomoto released Cook Do, a series of Chinese cuisine seasoning products, and later added other cuisine seasoning flavors to the Cook Do product line. The company entered the frozen food business in 1972, and currently sells a variety of frozen food products, including dumplings, noodles, and cooked rice. In 1982, Ajinomoto Co., Inc. entered the sweetener business by producing aspartame. In 1984 it released a low-calorie consumer sweetener PAL SWEET. By 2021, Ajinomoto was ranked 6th overall and 1st in Asia on FoodTalks&#x27; Top 50 Global Sweetener Companies list. Ajinomoto Co., Inc. is the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of aspartame, sold under the trade name Aminosweet. Ajinomoto also sells soup, mayonnaise, porridge, pasta sauce, and instant noodles under the &quot;VONO&quot; brand name. Through Ajinomoto AGF Corporation, Ajinomoto sells instant coffee, regular coffee, bottled coffee, stick coffee, and canned coffee, and is the top coffee brand in Thailand with a 70% market share.

Ajinomoto&#x27;s Yum Yum brand of instant noodles in 2019 held a 20–21% share of Thailand&#x27;s 17 billion baht instant noodle market.

=== Animal nutrition ===
The Ajinomoto Group started an animal nutrition business in 1965 and subsequently established an international production and supply system for amino acids to be used in animal feed. Ajinomoto developed a lysine formula called AjiPro-L for lactating dairy cows, which allows the lysine to reach the intestine without decomposing in the stomach.

=== Chemicals and semiconductors ===
Ajinomoto has developed mild cleansing agents such as Amisoft and Amilite, and humectant emollients such as Eldew and Amihop. It also manufactures for companies such as Daiichi Sankyo Healthcare Co., Ltd. to develop products like the moisturizing detergent Minon.

Ajinomoto developed its resin functional materials business using technology obtained through the production of MSG.

Ajinomoto developed the Ajinomoto build-up film (ABF) substrate for insulating materials in semiconductor packages in high-performance CPUs. It was developed from the basic research on applications of amino acid chemistry to epoxy resins and their composites. ABF holds 90% of the market for this product. The project is started in 1996 under the directory of Shigeo Nakamura.

=== Healthcare ===
The Ajinomoto Group&#x27;s healthcare business is based on using the fermentation technology of amino acids. In 1956, Ajinomoto began producing the world&#x27;s first amino acid infusion, enteral nutrition products, and crystalline amino acids that could be used as raw materials in pharmaceutical products. Currently, Ajinomoto manufactures around twenty kinds of amino acids at various factories overseas, including plants in Japan, the United States, Europe, and India. In 1995, Ajinomoto began selling an amino acid supplement called Amino Vital for professional sports athletes. In 2011, Ajinomoto began offering an &quot;Amino Index&quot; health checkup, which statistically analyzes the difference in amino acid concentrations between healthy individuals and adults suffering from cancer and other serious diseases to aid the early detection of cancer and other diseases. In addition to glutamates as a seasoning, the company also produces other amino acids such as L-Leucine, L-Tyrosine, Glycine, and L-Phenylalanine, which it markets as dietary supplements under the brand name AjiPure.

==Corporate structure==
===Representative directors===
* Taro Fujie, President &amp; CEO
* Hiroshi Shiragami, Representative Executive Officer &amp; Executive Vice President, Chief Innovation Officer (CIO)

===Divisions and global locations===
Ajinomoto currently operates separate divisions for North America, Latin America, and Asia, with Europe, the Middle East, and Africa being combined into the EMEA division. Ajinomoto also owns dozens of subsidiaries globally for its food, biochemical, and healthcare businesses.


==Brand identity==
==Controversies==
===Lysine price fixing===
In 1986, the Ajinomoto Group produced lysine at its Iowa factory of Heartland Lysine Co. U.S.A., followed by production in its Pathum Thani factory in Ajinomoto, Thailand in 1986, and Bio Italia, BioPro in Italy in 1992, gradually upgrading its worldwide production bases. In the United States, competitors increased their own lysine production, which resulted in lower prices due to an overabundance of lysine on the market. To raise prices again, several companies including Ajinomoto price fixed lysine in the 1990s. Along with Kyowa Hakko Kogyo and Sewon America, Inc., Ajinomoto admitted to price fixing and settled with the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division in September 1996. Each firm and an executive from each pleaded guilty as part of a plea bargain to aid in further investigation. Their cooperation led to Archer Daniels Midland settling charges with the US government in October 1996 for $100 million, a record antitrust fine at the time. Cartels were able to raise lysine prices 70% within the first six months of cooperating.

===MSG===
In 1996, the FDA commissioned the Federation of American Society for Experimental Biology (FASEB) to study the effects of MSG, who concluded that MSG is safe for most people. At the time, Ajinomoto also noted the possibility that asthma patients and carriers with symptoms of Chinese restaurant syndrome symptoms may be affected, but ultimately, the safety of this group was also confirmed by subsequent test results in the United States and Australia.

In 2020, Ajinomoto along with other activists launched the #RedefineCRS campaign to combat the myth that MSG is harmful to people&#x27;s health, which highlights both the underlying xenophobic biases against Asian cuisine and scientific evidence that the myth is false.

The FDA Food Code 2022 removed MSG from the table of common chemical hazards and associated food and control measures in retail establishments.

Low-sodium salt substitutes are considered to be formulations where sodium is reduced – usually by partial or full replacement of NaCl with other chloride and non-chloride salts such as KCl, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride or potassium lactate. Monosodium glutamate (MSG) was also considered a low-sodium salt substitute.

===Indonesian pork incident===
In early 2001, Ajinomoto was involved in an incident in Indonesia, a predominantly Muslim country, when it was revealed that a pork-based enzyme had been used in its MSG production. According to Islamic dietary laws, pork is a &quot;haram&quot; (forbidden) meat, and is regarded as unclean. Immediately after the incident, the Food and Drug Administration of the Indonesian government stepped up to announce that Ajinomoto&#x27;s end product did not contain pig-derived substances. Additionally, Ajinomoto also announced that its products were derived from soybeans.

===Aspartame===
In 2008, Ajinomoto sued British supermarket chain Asda, part of Walmart, for a malicious falsehood action concerning its aspartame product when the chemical was listed as excluded from the chain&#x27;s product line along with other &quot;nasties&quot;. In July 2009, a British court found the case in Asda&#x27;s favor. In June 2010, an appeal court reversed the decision, allowing Ajinomoto to pursue a case against Asda to protect the reputation of its aspartame. At that time, Asda said that it would continue to use the term &quot;no nasties&quot; on its own-label products, but the suit was settled out of court in 2011 after Asda removed references to aspartame from its packaging.

===Animal Testing===
In 2023, Ajinomoto was the subject of a protest from Peta UK and Siouxsie Sioux regarding the company&#x27;s use of animals for testing.

<text>Samuel Berger, (January 1, 1900 – July 24, 1992) was a Canadian owner of the Canadian Football League&#x27;s Ottawa Rough Riders and Montreal Alouettes and president of the CFL.

==Life==
A lawyer by profession, he was an early football fan who became involved with the Ottawa Rough Riders team as its legal advisor, president, and as an owner. He served three, three-year terms as the club&#x27;s president during which time the team made it to the Grey Cup seven times, winning the championship on four occasions.

He loved football, and played for Ottawa Collegiate Institute’s team. After high school, he worked as a reporter for the Ottawa Citizen, Ottawa Journal and Toronto Star. In 1925 he started at Osgoode Hall Law School and two years later started his own law firm in Ottawa.

Active in the Ottawa community, Berger twice ran for mayor of the city, losing to Charlotte Whitton in the 1960 and 1962 elections.

==CFL==
===Ottawa Rough Riders===
Highlights of his Rough Rider career include:
* 1930 hired by the Rough Riders as legal adviser.
* late 1930s founded real estate company, Ottawa Commercial Realties Ltd. when he was the Rough Riders’ vice-president. Without Sam Berger, the Grey Cup might have remained tucked away for years in the basement of an east Ottawa apartment; discovered it stored in a locker underneath The Strathcona apartments on Laurier Avenue East, a building he owned and lived in at the time.
* 1940 became Rough Riders’ president. 
* Second World War service as an RCAF officer in London.
* 1955 He and several colleagues bought Rough Riders.

===Montreal Alouettes===
In 1969 Sam Berger sold his shares in the Ottawa club and donated the proceeds to charitable causes. He then purchased the troubled Montreal Alouettes franchise and in the ensuing twelve years built it into a powerhouse that made six Grey Cup appearances and won it three times.

He retired in 1976 as the active owner of Alouettes, handing over the presidency to his eldest son, David. On March 6, 1981, Berger sold the Alouettes to Vancouver businessman Nelson Skalbania.

===CFL Administration===
He was President of the Canadian Football League in 1964 and 1971 and as an attorney and owner played a key role in putting together the League&#x27;s first television contract.

==Honours==
In 1986, Sam Berger was made a Member of the Order of Canada, one of Canada&#x27;s highest civilian honours, for &quot;his commitments to the sport and to the City of Montreal&quot;. In 1993 he was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame.

<text>Rajaraja I (Middle Tamil: &quot;Rājarāja Cōḻaṉ&quot;; Classical Sanskrit: &quot;Rājarāja Śōḷa&quot;; 3 November 947 – January/February 1014), also known as Rajaraja the Great, was a Chola emperor who reigned from 985 CE to 1014 CE. He is known for his conquests of southern India and parts of Sri Lanka, and increasing Chola influence across the Indian Ocean. Rajaraja&#x27;s birth name was Arulmozhi Varman. 

Rajaraja&#x27;s empire encompassed vast territories, including regions of the Pandya country, the Chera country, and northern Sri Lanka. He also extended his influence over strategic islands such as Lakshadweep, Thiladhunmadulu atoll, and parts of the Maldives in the Indian Ocean. His conquests weren&#x27;t limited to the south; he also launched successful campaigns against the Western Gangas and the Western Chalukyas, extending Chola authority as far as the Tungabhadra River. In the east, Rajaraja faced fierce opposition from the Telugu Chola king Jata Choda Bhima over control of Vengi. This region held significant strategic importance due to its access to resources and trade routes. The conflict between the two rulers intensified as they vied for dominance in the region, resulting in significant battles and shifting allegiances.

Rajaraja I also left a significant mark through his architectural and cultural achievements. He commissioned the construction of the Rajarajeshwaram Temple in the Chola capital of Thanjavur, which is revered as one of the most prominent examples of medieval South Indian architectural style. Additionally, during his reign, important Tamil literary works by poets such as Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar were gathered and compiled into a single collection known as the Thirumurai. This earned him the title of &#x27;Thirumurai Kanda Cholar,&#x27; meaning The One Who Found Thirumurai. He initiated a project of land survey and assessment in 1000 CE which led to the reorganisation of Tamil country into individual units known as &quot;valanadus&quot;. Rajaraja died in 1014 CE, and was succeeded by his son Rajendra Chola I.

== Early life ==
Rajaraja was the son of Chola King Parantaka II, also known as Sundara Chola, and Queen Vanavan Mahadevi. As recorded in the Thiruvalangadu copper-plate inscription, his birth name was Arun Mozhi Varman, meaning “The Word of Sun Clan.” He was born around 947 CE during the Tamil month of Aipassi, under the Sadhayam star. The Government of Tamil Nadu recognizes his birthdate as 3 November 947. Rajaraja had an elder brother, Aditha II, and an elder sister, Kundavai.

Rajaraja&#x27;s accession marked the end of a period of competing claims to the Chola throne, following his great-grandfather Parantaka I’s reign. After Parantaka I, his elder son Gandaraditya became king. However, upon Gandaraditya&#x27;s death, his son Madhurantakan was still a minor, so the throne passed to Parantaka I’s younger son, Arinjaya. Arinjaya soon died, and his son Parantaka II (Sundara Chola) succeeded him. It was decided that Sundara Chola would be succeeded by Madhurantakan, likely due to Sundara&#x27;s preference. However, according to the Thiruvalangadu inscription of Rajaraja’s son, Rajendra I, the succession plan may have been made by Rajaraja himself.

Aditha II died under mysterious circumstances, with inscriptions suggesting he may have been assassinated. Shortly afterward, Sundara Chola also passed away, enabling Madhurantakan to assume the throne with the title Uttama Chola. Following Uttama Chola’s death, Rajaraja ascended the throne in mid-985. He was known as Arulmoḷi Varman until this point, after which he adopted the regnal name Rajaraja, meaning “King among Kings.”

== Military conquests ==

When Rajaraja came into power, he inherited a kingdom that was only centered around the Thanjavur-Tiruchirappalli region, which was the heart of traditional Chola territory. However, this kingdom was not very large, and it was still recovering from attacks by the Rashtrakutas in previous years. Rajaraja changed this by transforming the kingdom into a well-organized empire with a powerful army and navy. Under his rule, the northern kingdom of Vengi became closely allied with the Cholas, and their influence expanded along the eastern coast all the way up to Kalinga in the north. 

In the Thanjavur inscriptions, various regiments are noted. These regiments were organized into units of elephants, cavalry, and infantry. Each of these units operated independently and had the authority to give gifts or construct temples as they saw fit.

=== Against Kandalur Salai ===
Rajaraja&#x27;s earliest inscriptions commemorate a significant triumph at Kandalur Salai, located in present-day Kerala, around 988 CE. He is acclaimed as &quot;Kāndalūr śālai Kalam-arutta,&quot; which translates to &#x27;the one who destroyed Kandalur Salai.&#x27;.

He is hailed as &quot;Kāndalūr śālai Kalam-arutta,&quot; meaning &#x27;the one who destroyed Kandalur Salai.&#x27; Originally, this area was under the control of the Ay chief, who served as a vassal to the Pandya king of Madurai. However, it remains uncertain whether warriors from the Chera or Pandya dynasties were involved in this conflict. The Thiruvalangadu inscription suggests that Rajaraja&#x27;s general captured Vizhinjam (Viḷinam), which could have been part of the Kandalur Salai campaign. It appears that this engagement involved the Chola navy, or possibly a joint operation involving both the navy and the army.

=== Conquest of Kerala and the Pandyas ===

Rajaraja&#x27;s inscriptions begin to appear in Kanyakumari district in the 990s and in Thiruvananthapuram district in the early 1000s. The Chola subjugation of Kerala can be dated to the early years of the 11th century. The Senur inscription dated to 1005 CE, attributed to Rajaraja, records his military achievements. It mentions the destruction of the Pandya capital, Madurai, as well as the conquest of several regions. These include defeating the formidable rulers of Kollam (Venad), Kolla-desham (Mushika), and Kodungallur (the Chera Perumals of Makotai).Certain triumphs in the region of Malainadu were possibly achieved by Prince Rajendra Chola I on behalf of his father, Rajaraja Chola.

Following his victory over the Pandyas, Rajaraja assumed the title of Pandya Kulashani, which translates to &#x27;Thunderbolt to the Race of the Pandyas.&#x27; As a result of his conquest, the territory of the Pandyas became recognized as &quot;Rajaraja Mandalam&quot; or &quot;Rajaraja Pandinadu.&quot; When recounting Rajaraja&#x27;s military expedition in Trisanku Kastha (the southern region), the Thiruvalangadu Grant of Rajendra I mentions the capture of a certain royal figure named Amarabhujanga. However, the specific identity of this individual—whether he was a prince of the Pandya dynasty, a general serving the Pandya king, or a prince of the Kongu Chera dynasty—remains a matter of debate and has not been conclusively resolved. According to the &quot;Kongu Desa Rajakkal,&quot; a historical record of the Kongu Nadu region, it is suggested that this general eventually changed his loyalty to Rajaraja. He is said to have participated in the ritual of &quot;kanakabhisheka,&quot; where gold is poured over the Chola king, symbolizing an act of royal anointment or coronation.

Once Rajaraja had consolidated his authority in the southern regions, he took on the title of Mummudi Chola. This title, which means &quot;three Crowned,&quot; symbolized his power over three important Tamil kingdoms: the Cholas, the Pandyas, and the Cheras.

=== Conquest of Sri Lanka ===

During the reign of King Mahinda V, the Sinhalese kingdom of Anuradhapura experienced a significant military revolt around the year 982 AD, primarily as a consequence of the monarch&#x27;s economic policies. The armed forces of the Anuradhapura capital predominantly consisted of Tamil mercenaries recruited from coastal regions. By 882 CE, tensions escalated into a full-fledged uprising led by these mercenaries, resulting in a protracted civil conflict. The ensuing turmoil compelled the vulnerable Sinhala ruler to seek refuge in the Rohana principality, thereby plunging the capital city of Anuradhapura into an extended period of civil unrest lasting approximately eleven years, marked by widespread disorder and lawlessness.
The disruption of central governance exacerbated the financial strain on the kingdom, particularly in meeting the obligations to the Tamil mercenaries. Consequently, the mercenaries, feeling aggrieved and disillusioned, turned their allegiance towards the Chola empire. This strategic shift left Anuradhapura vulnerable to the incursions of the Chola forces, who exploited the internal strife to mount invasions in the year 993. These events, documented in historical sources, underscore the intricate interplay of economic policies, military dynamics, and regional power struggles during this period in the history of Anuradhapura.
In 993 CE, Rajaraja achieved the conquest of Anuradhapura, known as Pihiti rata in local context, situated in Sri Lanka. This territory was subsequently designated as Ila-mandalam in Chola historical records. The military campaign led to the sacking of Anuradhapura by the Chola army, resulting in the acquisition of the northern portion of Sri Lanka by the Chola empire. As part of their administrative efforts, the Cholas established a provincial capital at the strategic military outpost of Polonnaruwa, renaming it Jananathamangalam in honor of Rajaraja&#x27;s title.

Under Chola administration, the official Tali Kumaran oversaw the construction of a significant Shiva temple known as Rajarajeshwara, meaning &quot;Lord of Rajaraja,&quot; within the town of Mahatirtha, now recognized as modern-day Mantota. Consequently, Mahatirtha was renamed Rajarajapura in commemoration of the Chola monarch&#x27;s conquest and establishment of authority in the region.

To commemorate their victory, the Chola administrator Tali Kumaran supervised the construction of a notable Shiva temple named Rajarajeshwara, signifying &quot;Lord of Rajaraja,&quot; within the precincts of Mahatirtha. Presently acknowledged as modern Mantota, this temple assumed a pivotal role as a representation of Chola hegemony and religious fervor. The transformation of Mahatirtha into Rajarajapura, in homage to the Chola sovereign, further underscores the symbolic and cultural import of the Chola conquest of Anuradhapura and their subsequent governance in the northern expanse of Sri Lanka.

The Thiruvalangadu Plates directly compare Raja Raja&#x27;s campaign to the invasion of Lanka by the legendary hero Rama:
In 1017 CE, Rajaraja&#x27;s successor, Rajendra I, finalized the Chola conquest of Sri Lanka. The Chola reign over Sri Lanka persisted until 1070, the occupation ended in Chola withdrawal after a further series of indecisive clashes.

=== Chalukyan conflict ===
In 998 CE, Rajaraja annexed Gangapadi, Nolambapadi, and Tadigaipadi (present-day Karnataka). During this campaign, Raja Chola subdued the Nolambas, who were previously vassals of the Ganga dynasty. These territories were initially under the suzerainty of the Rashtrakutas, who had been defeated by the Western Chalukyas in 973 CE. Consequently, the Cholas found themselves in direct conflict with the Chalukyas. An inscription of Irivabedanga Satyashraya from Dharwar describes him as a vassal of the Western Chalukyas and acknowledges the Chola onslaught.

An inscription attributed to Irivabedanga Satyashraya from Dharwar acknowledges his allegiance to the Western Chalukyas and highlights the Chola incursion. He accuses Rajendra Chola of leading a massive force of 955,000 soldiers and causing havoc in Donuwara, blurring the ethical boundaries of warfare prescribed by the Dharmasastras. Historians such as James Heitzman and Wolfgang Schenkluhn interpret this confrontation as indicative of personal animosity between the rulers of the Chola and Chalukya kingdoms, akin to historical conflicts between the Chalukyas of Badami and the Pallavas of Kanchi.

By the year 1004 CE, Rajaraja had successfully conquered the Gangavadi province. He established control over the western part of Gangavadi, ruled by the Changalvas, and over Kodagu, governed by the Kongalvas, who were then made vassals of the Chola Empire. Panchavan Maraya, a Chola general, played a significant role in defeating the Changalvas in the battle of Ponnasoge and was duly rewarded with the territory of Arkalgud Yelusuvira-7000 and the esteemed title of Kshatriyasikhamani. Similarly, in recognition of the valor displayed by Manya, a Kongalva leader, the estate of Malambi (Coorg) was granted to them, along with the title of Kshatriyasikhamani.

Meanwhile, the Vengi kingdom was under the rule of Jata Choda Bhima, a member of the Eastern Chalukyas Dynasty. However, Rajaraja emerged victorious in battle against Bhima, and Saktivarman was appointed as a viceroy under the Chola Dynasty. Despite a brief period of Bhima&#x27;s recapture of Kanchi in 1001 CE, Rajaraja swiftly restored Saktivarman to power, even expelling and eliminating an Andhra king named Bhima. Notably, Rajaraja cemented an alliance between the Chola Dynasty and the Eastern Chalukya kingdom by arranging the marriage of his daughter, Kundavai, to the next viceroy of Vengi, Vimaladitya. This strategic union ensured the future succession of Rajaraja&#x27;s descendants to the throne of the eastern Chalukya kingdom.

=== Hoysala conflicts ===
There were hostile encounters between the Cholas and the Hoysalas, a group who were vassals of the Western Chalukyas. An inscription from the Gopalakrishna temple at Narasipur, dated to 1006, records that Rajaraja&#x27;s general Aprameya killed Hoysala generals and a minister identified as Naganna. Additionally, a similar inscription in Channapatna describes Rajaraja defeating the Hoysalas.

=== Kalinga conquest ===

The invasion of the kingdom of Kalinga occurred after the conquest of Vengi. This conquest marked the northern boundary of the Chola Empire at that time and established their control over the entirety of South and South-East India.

=== Conquest of Kuda-malai-nadu ===
In multiple historical accounts, there are mentions of King Rajaraja&#x27;s conquest of a place called &quot;Kuda-malai-nadu&quot; around the year 1000 CE. In certain inscriptions found in Karnataka, the term &quot;Kudagu-malai-nadu&quot; is used instead of &quot;Kuda-malai-nadu.&quot; Scholars generally believe that this region corresponds to Coorg (Kudagu).

The king&#x27;s conquest of Malainadu is described in the Vikrama Chola Ula, where it is said that he achieved it in just one day, crossing 18 mountain passes. According to the Kulottunga Chola Ula, King Rajaraja was depicted as beheading 18 people and burning down Udagai. Additionally, the Kalingathupparani references the establishment of Chadaya Nalvizha in Udiyar Mandalam, the seizure of Udagai, and the plundering of several elephants from the area. The Tiruppalanam inscription from 999 CE records the king&#x27;s offering of an idol obtained as spoils from Malainadu.

=== Naval expedition ===
Cholas developed a powerful navy which enabled them to conquer Sri Lanka and the Maldives.

One of the last conquests of Rajaraja was the naval conquest of the islands of Maldives (&quot;the Ancient Islands of the Sea Numbering 1200&quot;). The naval campaign was a demonstration of the Chola naval power in the Indian Ocean.
The Cholas controlled the area around Bay of Bengal with Nagapattinam as the main port. The Chola Navy also played a major role in the invasion of Sri Lanka. The success of Rajaraja allowed his son Rajendra Chola to lead the Chola invasion of Srivijaya, carrying out naval raids in South-East Asia and briefly occupying Kadaram.

Rajaraja I and Rajendra I are described as the greatest Chola rulers because of these conquests.

== Personal life ==

Rajaraja married several women, including the following: Vanathi aka Thiripuvāna Mādēviyār, Dantisakti Vitanki aka Lokamadevi, Panchavan Madeviyar, Chola Mahadevi, Trailokya Mahadevi, Lata Mahadevi, Prithvi Mahadevi, Meenavan Mahadevi, Viranarayani and Villavan Mahadevi. He had at least three daughters and two sons. The older son, Rajendra, was born to Thiripuvāna Mādēviyār. The younger son was named Araiyan Rajarajan, and the identiey of his mother is unknown. He had his first daughter Kundavai with Lokamadev who eventually married Chalukya prince Vimaladithan. Rajaraja had two other daughters. Rajaraja died in 1014 CE in the Tamil month of Maka and was succeeded by Rajendra Chola I.

== Administration ==
Before the reign of Rajaraja I, portions of the Chola territory were ruled by hereditary lords and princes who were in a loose alliance with the Chola rulers. Rajaraja initiated a project of land survey and assessment in 1000 CE which led to the reorganization of the empire into units known as valanadus. From the reign of Rajaraja I until the reign of Vikrama Chola in 1133 CE, the hereditary lords and local princes were either replaced or turned into dependent officials. This led to the king exercising closer control over the different parts of the empire. Rajaraja strengthened the local self-governments and installed a system of audit and control by which the village assemblies and other public bodies were held to account while retaining their autonomy. To promote trade, he sent the first Chola mission to China. Furthermore, his elder sister Kundavai assisted him in the administration and management of temples.

== Officials ==

Rajendra Chola I was appointed as a co-regent towards the end of Rajaraja&#x27;s reign. He held the position of supreme commander over the northern and northwestern territories. Under Raja Chola&#x27;s rule, there was a notable expansion of the administrative system, resulting in a greater number of offices and officials documented in Chola records compared to previous eras. Villavan Muvendavelan, one of the top officials of Rajaraja figures in many of his inscriptions. The names of other officials found in the inscriptions are the Bana prince Narasimhavarman, a general Senapathi Krishnan Raman, the Samanta chief Vallavaraiyan Vandiyadevan, the revenue official Irayiravan Pallavarayan and Kuruvan Ulagalandan, who organised the country-wide land surveys.

== Religious policy ==
Rajaraja was a follower of Shaivism denomination of Hinduism but he also dedicated several temples to Vishnu.

The Chudamani Vihara, a Buddhist monastery, was constructed in the 11th century CE in Nagapattinam. It was named Chudamani or Chulamani Vihara after King Sri Mara&#x27;s father. The monastery was built by the Sailendra king of Srivijaya, Sri Mara Vijayattungavarman, with the support of Rajaraja I. According to the small Leyden grant, this Vihara was known as Rajaraja-perumpalli during the reign of Kulottunga I. Rajaraja dedicated the proceeds of the revenue from the village of Anaimangalam towards the upkeep of this Vihara.

Rajaraja called himself &quot;Shivapada Shekhara&quot; (IAST: Śivapāda Śekhara), literally, &quot;the one who places his crown at the feet of Shiva&quot;.

== Arts and architecture ==

Rajaraja embarked on a mission to recover the hymns after hearing short excerpts of &quot;Thevaram&quot; in his court. He sought the help of Nambi Andar Nambi. It is believed that by divine intervention Nambi found the presence of scripts, in the form of cadijam leaves half eaten by white ants in a chamber inside the second precinct in Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram. The &quot;brahmanas&quot; (Dikshitars) in the temple opposed the mission, but Rajaraja intervened by consecrating the images of the saint-poets through the streets of Chidambaram. Rajaraja thus became known as &quot;Tirumurai Kanda Cholan&quot; meaning one who saved the &quot;Tirumurai&quot;. In his work &quot;Nambiyandar Nambi Puranam&quot; alias &quot;Tirumurai Kanda Puranam&quot;, Nambi identifies his patron as &quot;Rasarasamannan-Abhayakula-sekharan&quot;, that is &quot;king Rajaraja, the best of the race of Abhaya&quot;. At that time, Shiva temples only had images of god forms, but after the advent of Rajaraja, the images of the Nayanar saints were also placed inside the temple. Nambi organized the hymns of three saint poets—Sambandar, Appar, and Sundarar—as the first seven books. He included Manickavasagar&#x27;s Tirukovayar and Tiruvacakam as the 8th book, and the hymns of nine other saints as the 9th book. The Tirumandiram of Tirumular was designated as the 10th book, while 40 hymns by 12 other poets constituted the 11th book. Additionally, Nambi added Tirutotanar Tiruvanthathi, the sacred anthathi of the labors of the 63 nayanar saints, along with his own hymns as the 12th book. The initial seven books were later recognized as Tevaram. With the addition of Sekkizhar&#x27;s Periya Puranam (1135) as the twelfth book, the entire Saiva canon became known as Tirumurai, the holy scripture. Consequently, Saiva literature now encompasses approximately 600 years of religious, philosophical, and literary development.

There are no existing contemporary portraits or statues of Rajaraja. The bronze figure purportedly depicting him at the Thanjavur temple is spurious and of recent origin.

=== Brihadisvara Temple ===


During 1010 CE, Rajaraja built the Brihadisvara Temple in Thanjavur and dedicated it to Lord Shiva. The temple, also known as &quot;Periya Kovil&quot;, &quot;RajaRajeswara Temple&quot; and &quot;Rajarajeswaram&quot;, and the capital were centres of both religious and economic activity. The temple, which turned 1000 years old in 2010, is one of the largest temples in India and is an example of Dravidian architecture of the Chola period. Along with Gangaikonda Cholapuram temple and Airavatesvara temple, Brihadisvara is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the &quot;Great Living Chola Temples&quot;.

The temple tower, called the vimanam, stands at a remarkable height of 216 feet (66 meters), making it the tallest in the world. At the very top sits the Kumbam, a bulbous structure, which is carved entirely from a single rock and weighs approximately 80 tons. At the entrance stands a sizable statue of Nandi, the sacred bull, carved from a single rock, measuring about 16 feet in length and 13 feet in height. The entire temple structure is crafted from granite, obtained from sources located approximately 60 kilometers to the west of the temple. This temple is widely renowned as one of the premier tourist attractions in Tamil Nadu.

== Coins ==

Prior to Rajaraja&#x27;s reign, Chola coins featured the tiger emblem on the obverse, along with the fish and bow emblems representing the Pandya and Chera Dynasties, while the reverse side displayed the name of the King. However, a new type of coin emerged during Rajaraja&#x27;s rule. These new coins showcased the figure of the standing king on the obverse side, while the reverse side depicted a seated goddess. The coins spread across much of southern India and were copied by Sri Lankan kings.

== Inscriptions ==
Due to Rajaraja&#x27;s desire to record his military achievements, he recorded the important events of his life in stone. An inscription in Tamil from Mulbagal in Karnataka shows his accomplishments as early as the 19th year. An excerpt from such a &quot;Meikeerthi&quot;, an inscription recording great accomplishments, follows:


Rajaraja recorded all the grants made to the Thanjavur temple and his achievements. He also preserved the records of his predecessors. An inscription of his reign found at Tirumalavadi records an order of the king to the effect that the central shrine of the Vaidyanatha temple at the place should be rebuilt and that, before pulling down the walls, the inscriptions engraved on them should be copied in a book. The records were subsequently re-engraved on the walls from the book after the rebuilding was finished.

Another inscription from the Gramardhanathesvara temple in the southern area of Arcot, dating back to the seventh year of the king, mentions the fifteenth year of his predecessor, Uttama Choladeva. Uttama Choladeva is described in the inscription as the son of Sembiyan-Madeviyar.

==Reception==
Floyd C. Gale wrote that &quot;too many [trick endings] are more than enough&quot;, but that there were &quot;several superlative items&quot;, citing the &quot;Venture to the Moon&quot; and &quot;The Other Side of the Sky&quot; story headings. He described the paperback edition as &quot;A double dozen of Clarke&#x27;s best short-shorts, all tricky&quot;. Damon Knight, although dismissing the vignettes as &quot;without exception remarkably trivial,&quot; reported that the other stories &quot;include some of Clarke&#x27;s best work.&quot;

<text>was a Japanese Catholic physician, author, and survivor of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki. His subsequent life of prayer and service earned him the affectionate title &quot;saint of Urakami&quot;. His cause for canonization was opened after his death and he has been titled a Servant of God.

==Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Takashi (meaning &quot;nobility&quot;) Nagai had a difficult birth that endangered his and his mother&#x27;s life. His family was highly educated. His father, Noboru Nagai, was trained in Western medicine; his paternal grandfather, Fumitaka Nagai, was a practitioner of traditional herbal medicine; and his mother, Tsune, was the descendant of an old family of samurai.

Nagai was born in Matsue and grew up in the rural area of Mitoya, raised according to the teachings of Confucius and the Shinto religion. In 1920, he commenced his secondary studies at Matsue High School boarding at his cousins&#x27; home close by. He became increasingly interested with the surrounding atheism but was curious about Christianity.

=== Life in Nagasaki ===
In April 1928, he joined the Nagasaki Medical College where he joined the Araragi, a poetry group founded by Mokichi Saito and the university basketball team (he measured 1.71 m and weighed 70 kg).

In 1930 his mother died from a brain hemorrhage, which lead him to ponder the works of philosopher and scientist Blaise Pascal. He began to read the &quot;Pensées,&quot; which influenced his later conversion to Catholicism, and boarded with the Moriyama family, who for seven generations had been the hereditary leaders of a group of Kakure Kirishitans in Urakami. Takashi learned that the construction of the nearby Immaculate Conception Cathedral in Nagasaki was financed by poor Christian farmers and fishermen.

He graduated in 1932 and was supposed to deliver an address at the ceremony. However, five days before the event, he became intoxicated at a farewell party and returned home completely soaked with water from the rain. He slept without drying himself and found the next morning that he had contracted a disease of the right ear (signs of meningitis), which made him depressed and partially deaf. He could not practice medicine and agreed to turn to radiology research.

On 24 December, Sadakichi Moriyama invited Nagai to participate in a midnight Mass. In the cathedral, Takashi was impressed by the people in prayer, their singing, their faith and the sermon. He would later say: &quot;I felt somebody close to me whom I did not still know.&quot;

The next night, Sadakichi&#x27;s daughter Midori was struck down by acute appendicitis. Nagai made a quick diagnosis, telephoned the surgeon at the hospital and carried Midori there on his back through the snow. The operation was successful and Midori survived.

Upon his return from Manchuria, he continued his reading of the Catholic catechism, the Bible, and the &quot;Pensées&quot;. He met with a priest, Fr Matsusaburo Moriyama, whose father had been deported to Tsuwano (Shimane Prefecture) for his faith, along with many other Christian villagers in Urakami, by the Government of Meiji Japan from the 1860s to the 1870s (Urakami Yoban Kuzure). Eventually, Nagai&#x27;s spiritual progress took a decisive turn when he thought about Pascal&#x27;s words:&quot;There is enough light for those who only desire to see, and enough obscurity for those who have a contrary disposition.&quot;

=== Conversion to Catholicism ===
On 9 June 1934, Nagai received baptism in the Catholic faith. He chose the Christian first name Paul.

Takashi received the sacrament of confirmation in December 1934. Midori was president of the association of the women of the Urakami district. Takashi became a member of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul (SSVDP), discovered its founder, Frédéric Ozanam, and his writings, and visited his patients and the poor, to whom he brought assistance, comfort and food. From 1931 to 1936, Father Maximilian Kolbe lived in a suburb of Nagasaki, where he started a monastery. Takashi met Kolbe through involvement with his parish St. Vincent de Paul Society in Nagasaki.

=== Military service ===
In January 1933, Takashi began his military service with the of Hiroshima. In Manchuria, Nagai cared for the wounded and served in the sanitary service as a medic. He was strongly shaken in his faith in Japanese culture when he saw for himself the exactions of the Japanese soldiers and their brutality towards the Chinese civilian population. While serving in Manchuria, Nagai had received a Catholic Catechism as a gift from his to-be wife Midori. The book immediately raised concerns with his commanding sergeant, who had it examined for &quot;subversive ideas.&quot; Though his sergeant found the Catechism to make no sense to him, he determined that it was not &quot;particularly socialist,&quot; returning the book to Nagai.

On 7 July 1937,  the same day as the birth of his first daughter Ikuko, the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out and he was mobilized as a surgeon in the service in the Medical Corps of the 5th Division. He was affected by the harsh winter in China, and the distress of the civilians and soldiers, both Chinese and Japanese. On 4 February 1939, he received news of the death of his father and that of his daughter Ikuko. He remained in China until 1940. Upon his return, he continued his studies at the college.

=== World War II ===
After the Japanese declaration of war on the United States on 8 December 1941, Nagai had a somber presentiment: His city could be destroyed during this war.

He obtained his doctorate in 1944. On 26 April 1945, an air raid on Nagasaki left numerous victims. The hospital was overwhelmed. Takashi spent his days and nights serving the wounded in his radiology department. In June 1945, he was diagnosed with leukemia and given a life expectancy of three years. This disease was probably due to his exposure to X-rays during radiological examinations which he performed by direct observation, since films were not available during the war period. He spoke to Midori about his disease, and she said to Nagai, &quot;Whether you live or die, it is for God&#x27;s glory.&quot;

In the evening of 6 August, Nagai learned that an atomic bomb had been dropped by the Americans on Hiroshima. With Midori, he decided to take their children away to Matsuyama, 6 km away in the countryside, accompanied by Midori&#x27;s mother.

=== Relief activities ===
On 9 August 1945, at 11:02 am, the second atomic bomb struck Nagasaki. At the time of the atomic bombing, Dr. Nagai was working in the radiology department of Nagasaki Medical College Hospital. He received a serious injury that severed his right temporal artery but joined the rest of the surviving medical staff in dedicating themselves to treating the atomic bomb victims. He wrote a 100-page medical report about his observations detailing the &quot;concentric circles of death&quot; around the epicentre of the blast.

On 11 August, he found his house destroyed and his wife dead. Months later, Nagai was found to be seriously affected by his head wound. He was confined to bed for a month, with death for a time seeming close as he began suffering from Cheyne–Stokes respiration. According to Nagai, when he drank water taken from Lourdes in Honkawachi, where Fr. Kolbe had founded a monastery, he heard a voice urge him to ask an intercession from the priest.

=== Postwar years ===
He returned to the district of Urakami (the epicenter of the bomb) on 15 October 1945 and built a small hut (about six tatami) from pieces of his old house. He remained there with his two surviving children (Makoto and Kayano), his mother-in-law, and two other relatives.

In 1947, the local Society of Saint Vincent de Paul (SSVDP) built a simple two-tatami teahouse-like structure for him. Nagai named it &quot;Nyokodo&quot; (如己堂, Nyoko-dō to, literally &quot;As-Yourself Hall&quot;, after Jesus&#x27; words, &quot;Love your neighbor as yourself.&quot; He styled it as a hermitage and spent his remaining years in prayer and contemplation.

For six months, he observed mourning for Midori and let his beard and hair grow. On 23 November 1945, a mass was celebrated, in front of the ruins of the cathedral, for the victims of the bomb. Takashi gave a speech filled with faith, comparing the victims to a sacred offering to obtain peace.

In the following years, Nagai resumed teaching and began to write books. The first of these, &quot;The Bells of Nagasaki&quot;, was completed by the first anniversary of the bombing. Although he failed to find a publisher at first, eventually it became a best seller and the basis for a top box-office movie in Japan. In July 1946, he collapsed on a station platform. Now disabled, he was henceforth confined to bed.

In 1948, he used 50,000 yen paid by the &quot;Kyushu Times&quot; to plant 1,000 three-year-old &quot;sakura&quot; (cherry) trees in the district of Urakami to transform this devastated land into a &quot;Hill of Flowers&quot;. Although some have been replaced, these cherry trees are still called &quot;Nagai Senbonzakura&quot; (&quot;1,000 cherry trees of Nagai&quot;); their flowers decorate the houses of Urakami in spring. By 2010, the numbers of these cherry trees were reduced to only about 20 due to aging and other causes.

On 3 December 1949, he was made freeman of the city of Nagasaki. He received a visit from Helen Keller in October 1948. He was visited, in 1949, by Emperor Hirohito and by Cardinal Norman Gilroy of Australia, a papal emissary.

=== Death ===
On 1 May 1951, he asked to be transported to the college hospital in Nagasaki so that the medical students could observe the last moments of a man preparing to die from leukemia. He prolonged the day of hospitalization to wait for the statue of Our Lady, a gift from the Italian Catholic Medical Association.

Until the evening, his condition seemed stable. However, around 9:40pm, Nagai complained of dizziness and became unconscious. After two injections of cardiotonics, he regained his consciousness and prayed: &quot;Jesus, Mary, Joseph, into your hands, I entrust my soul.&quot;

Then he took the cross from the hand of his son Makoto, who rushed into the room, and shortly after he shouted the words &quot;Please pray!&quot; Nagai breathed his last at 9:50 pm. He died at the age of 43. On the following day, his body underwent an autopsy at the hospital according to his will. His spleen had swelled to 3,410g (normal weight: 94g), and his liver weighed 5,035g (normal weight: 1,400g).

On May 3, his funeral Mass was celebrated by Bishop Paul Aijirō Yamaguchi in front of the cathedral. On May 14, an official ceremony took place in memory of Nagai. An estimated 20,000 people attended. The city of Nagasaki observed one minute of silence while the bells of all the religious buildings rang. His remains were interred in the Sakamoto International Cemetery.

== Personal life ==
In 1934, Nagai proposed to Midori Moriyama. They married in August and had four children: a boy, Makoto (誠, born 3 April 1935 – 4 April 2001), and three daughters, Ikuko (郁子, born 7 July 1937 – 1939), Sasano who died shortly after her birth, and Kayano (佳也乃, born 18 August 1941 – 2 February 2008).

==Legacy==
His &quot;Nyokodo&quot;, with the addition of a library, became a museum in 1952: the Nagasaki City Nagai Takashi Memorial Museum. After undergoing restoration in 2000, it is managed today by Tokusaburo Nagai, the grandson of Takashi Nagai and son of Makoto Nagai.

The Dr. Takashi Nagai Memorial Museum is in Unnan, Shimane Prefecture, where he spent his childhood.

His name was added to the Monument to the X-ray and Radium Martyrs of All Nations erected in Hamburg, Germany.

In 1991 in Nagasaki, the Takashi Nagai Peace Award was founded., with the purpose of annually awarding individuals and/or organizations, both domestic and overseas, for their contributions to world peace through the improvements and developments of medicare for hibakusha and related social welfare.

On April 1, 2003, for the succession of Nagai&#x27;s spirit and a center to offer medical care for domestic and overseas &quot;hibakusha&quot;, the Nagai Takashi Memorial International Hibakusha Medical Center was founded at Nagasaki University Hospital.

Shunichi Yamashita, the director of the center, who was appointed as an adviser to Fukushima Prefecture on radiation exposure after the Fukushima nuclear accident, wrote:&quot;I myself [am] just a younger alumnus of the same university, I found Nagai Takashi Memorial International Hibakusha Medical Center at Nagasaki University Hospital. Furthermore, by founding the Takashi Nagai Memorial Nagasaki Peace Award as an international activity of Nagasaki Association for Hibakushas&#x27; Medical Care, I am making an effort in order to honor the doctor for a long time succeeding the last wishes of those who [know] the doctor like the late Soshino Hisamatsu, the director of [the] nursing service department.&quot;

In Korea in 2004, the Most Rev. Paul Ri Moun-hi, then Archbishop of Daegu, founded the Korean Association of &quot;Love Your Neighbor as Yourself&quot;.

Nagai&#x27;s cause for canonization was opened after his death, granting him the title Servant of God.

==Thought==

===Use of nuclear power===
Although Nagai opposed the use of nuclear weapons, he hoped atomic energy might be used for peaceful purposes. At the end of the &quot;Atomic Bomb Rescue and Relief Report&quot;, he writes:
&quot;We should utilize the principle of the atomic bomb. Go forward in the research of atomic energy contributing to the progress of civilization. A misfortune will then be transformed to good fortune. The world civilization will change with the utilization of atomic energy. If a new and fortunate world can be made, the souls of so many victims will rest in peace.&quot;

==Works==
Nagai left behind a voluminous output of essays, memoirs, drawings, and calligraphy on themes including God, war, death, medicine, and orphanhood. These enjoyed a large readership during the American occupation of Japan (1945–52) as spiritual chronicles of the atomic bomb experience. His books have been translated into various languages, including Chinese, Korean, French, and German. Four of his literary works are currently available in English: &quot;We of Nagasaki&quot;, a compilation of atomic-bomb victim testimonies edited by Nagai; &quot;The Bells of Nagasaki&quot; (trans. William Johnston); &quot;Leaving My Beloved Children Behind&quot; (trans. Maurice M. Tatsuoka and Tsuneyoshi Takai); and &quot;Thoughts from Nykodo&quot; (trans. Gabriele di Comite). His works were republished in new Japanese editions by Paulist Press.

Much of Nagai&#x27;s writing is spiritual, consisting of Christian reflections on the experience (or, just as often, imagined future experience) of himself and the people around him, especially his children, in the aftermath of the war. His intensely personal meditations are often addressed to his children or to God, and he works out his own spiritual issues on the page as he writes in a visceral and uncensored prose. Nagai&#x27;s more technical writings, in the &quot;Atomic Bomb Rescue and Relief Report&quot; (&quot;Nagasaki Idai Genshi Bakudan Kyuugo Houkoku&quot;), were discovered in 1970.

==Media==
In July 1949 a song titled &quot;Nagasaki no Kane&quot; (&quot;The Bells of Nagasaki&quot;) was released by Columbia Records. It was sung by Ichiro Fujiyama with lyrics by Hachiro Sato. Yuji Koseki was the composer for the song.

Nagai&#x27;s &quot;The Bells of Nagasaki&quot; was used as the basis for a film of the same name produced by Shochiku movie studios and directed by Hideo Ōba. It was released on 23 September 1950. &quot;Leaving These Children Behind&quot; was filmed by Keisuke Kinoshita in 1983.

The British film production company Pixel Revolution Films released the film &quot;All That Remains&quot; based on the life of Nagai in 2016. The film is directed by Ian and Dominic Higgins and stars Leo Ashizawa as Dr. Nagai and Yuna Shin as his wife, Midori.

<text>Harry Morris Warner (born Hirsz Mojżesz Wonsal; December 12, 1881 – July 25, 1958) was an American studio executive, one of the founders of Warner Bros., and a major contributor to the development of the film industry. Along with his three younger brothers (Albert, Sam and Jack), Warner played a crucial role in the film business and establishing Warner Bros., serving as the company president until 1956.

== Early life ==
Warner was born Hirsz Mojżesz &quot;Wonsal&quot; or &quot;Wonskolaser&quot; to a family of Ashkenazi Jews from the village of Krasnosielc, Poland, and (then part of Congress Poland in the Russian Empire). He was the son of Benjamin Wonsal, a shoemaker born in Krasnosielc, and Pearl Leah Eichelbaum. His given name was Mojżesz (Moses), however, he was called Hirsz (Anglicized to Hirsch) in the United States. In October 1889, he came to Baltimore, Maryland with his mother and siblings on the steamship &quot;Hermann&quot; from Bremen, Germany. Their father had preceded them, immigrating to Baltimore in 1888 to pursue his trade in shoes and shoe repair. At that time that he changed the family name to Warner which was used thereafter. As in many Jewish immigrant families, some of the children gradually acquired anglicized versions of their Yiddish-sounding names. Hirsz became Harry, and his middle name Morris was likely a version of Mojżesz.

In Baltimore, the money Benjamin Warner earned in the shoe repair business was not enough to provide for his growing household. He and Pearl had another daughter, Fannie, not long after they arrived. Benjamin moved the family to Canada, inspired by a friend&#x27;s advice that he could make an excellent living bartering tin wares with trappers in exchange for furs. Sons Jacob and David Warner were born in London, Ontario. After two arduous years living in Canada, the Warners returned to Baltimore. Two more children, Sadie and Milton, were added to the household there. In 1896, the family moved to Youngstown, Ohio, following the lead of Harry, who had established a shoe repair shop in the heart of the emerging industrial town. Benjamin worked with Harry in the shoe repair shop until he secured a loan to open a meat counter and grocery store in the city&#x27;s downtown area.

In 1899, Harry opened a bicycle shop in Youngstown, Ohio with his brother, Abraham. Eventually, Harry and Abe also opened a bowling alley together. The bowling alley failed and closed shortly after it opened. Harry eventually accepted an offer to become a salesman for a local meat franchise, and sold meat in Ohio and Pennsylvania. However, by his nineteenth birthday, Harry was reduced to living in his parents&#x27; crowded household.

== Business career in films ==
In 1903, Harry&#x27;s brothers, Abe and Sam, began to exhibit &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; at carnivals across Ohio and Pennsylvania. In 1905, Harry sold his bicycle shop and joined his brothers in their fledgling film business. With the money Harry made from selling the bicycle shop, the three brothers were able to purchase a building in New Castle, Pennsylvania. They used the building to establish their first theater, the Cascade. The Cascade was so successful that the brothers were able to purchase a second theater in New Castle. The makeshift theatre, called the Bijou, was furnished with chairs borrowed from a local undertaker.

In 1907, the Warners expanded the business further and purchased fifteen theaters in Pennsylvania. Harry, Sam, and Albert formed a new film exchange company, The Duquesne Amusement Supply Company, and rented an office in the Bakewell building in downtown Pittsburgh. Harry sent Sam to New York to purchase, and ship, films for their Pittsburgh exchange company, while he and Albert remained in Pittsburgh to run the business. In 1909, the brothers sold the Cascade Theater and established a second film exchange company in Norfolk, Virginia. Harry agreed to let younger brother Jack be a part of the company, sending him to Norfolk to serve as Sam&#x27;s assistant. A serious problem threatened the Warners&#x27; film company with the advent of Thomas Edison&#x27;s Motion Picture Patents Company (also known as the Edison Trust), which charged distributors exorbitant fees. In 1910, the Warners sold the family business to the General Film Company for &quot;$10,000 in cash, $12,000 in preferred stock, and payments over a four-year period for a total of $52,000&quot;.

After they sold their business, Harry and his three brothers joined forces with independent filmmaker Carl Laemmle&#x27;s Independent Motion Picture Company, and began distributing films from his Pittsburgh film exchange division. In 1912, the brothers earned a $1,500 profit with the film &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot;. In the wake of their success, Harry and the brothers broke with Laemmle and established their own film production company. They named their new company Warner Features. Once Warner Features was established, Harry acquired an office in New York with his brother Albert, sending Sam and Jack to run the new corporation&#x27;s film exchange divisions in San Francisco and Los Angeles. In 1917, Harry won more capital for the studio when he was able to negotiate a deal with Ambassador James W. Gerard to make Gerard&#x27;s book &quot;My Four Years In Germany&quot; into a film.

In 1918, after the success of &quot;My Four Years in Germany&quot;, the brothers were able to establish a studio near Hollywood, California. In the new Hollywood studio, Sam became co-head of production along with his younger brother, Jack. They were convinced that they would have to make movies themselves if they were to ever generate a profit. Between the years 1919 and 1920, the studio did not turn a profit. During that time, banker Motley Flint, who was unlike most bankers at the time, not anti-semitic, helped the brothers pay off their debts. The four brothers then decided to move their studio from Culver City, California, to the Sunset Boulevard section of Hollywood.

Warner decided to focus on making only dramas for the studio during that time. The studio rebounded in 1921 with the success of the studio&#x27;s film &quot;Why Girls Leave Home&quot;; The film&#x27;s director, Harry Rapf, became the studio&#x27;s new head producer. On April 4, 1923, following the success of the studio&#x27;s film &quot;The Gold Diggers&quot;, Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was officially established, with help from a loan given to Harry by Montly Flint. Harry became company president, with Albert as treasurer and Jack and Sam as co-heads of production. Harry and his family moved to Hollywood.

=== Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. ===
The studio discovered a trained German Shepherd named Rin Tin Tin in 1923. The canine made his starring debut in &quot;Where the North Begins&quot;, a film about an abandoned pup who is raised by wolves and befriends a fur trapper. According to a biographer, Jack Warner&#x27;s initial doubts about the project were quelled when he met Rin Tin Tin, &quot;who seemed to display more intelligence than some of the Warner comics.&quot; The trained dog proved to be the studio&#x27;s most important commercial asset until the introduction of sound. Prolific screenwriter Darryl F. Zanuck produced several scripts for Rin Tin Tin vehicles and, during one year, wrote more than half of the studio&#x27;s features. Between 1928 and 1933, Zanuck was the studio&#x27;s executive producer, a position whose responsibilities included the day-to-day production of films; while Warner&#x27;s younger brother Jack and Zanuck were able to develop a close friendship, Warner never really accepted Zanuck as a friend.

After establishing Warner Bros., the studio had unfortunately overdrawn $1 million (the amount which Warner had borrowed from Flint) and Warner decided to pay off the debt by expanding the studio&#x27;s operations further. In the process, Warner acquired forty theaters in Pennsylvania. In 1924, Warner Bros. producee two more successful films, &quot;The Marriage Circle&quot; and &quot;Beau Brummell&quot;. In 1924, after Rapf left the studio to accept an offer at MGM, Ernst Lubitsch, the successful director of &quot;The Marriage Circle&quot;, was also given the title of head producer; Lubitsch added additional success to the studio&#x27;s profits. The film &quot;Beau Brummel&quot; also made John Barrymore a top star at the studio as well. Although the studio now had success, the brothers were still unable to compete with The Big Three (Paramount, Universal, and First National).

In 1925, Harry and a large group of independent film-makers assembled in
Milwaukee, Wisconsin to challenge the monopoly the Big Three had over the film industry. Harry and the other independent film-makers at the Milwaukee convention agreed to spend $500,000 in newspaper advertisements; this action would help benefit Warner Bros. profits. With help from a loan supplied by Goldman, Sachs head banker Waddill Catchings, Warner would find a way to successfully respond to the growing concern the Big Three Studios further induced to Warner Bros., and expanded the company&#x27;s operations further by purchasing the Brooklyn theater company Vitagraph. Because of that, Warner Pictures now owned theaters in the New York area. Around the time, Warner purchased a home in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Hancock Park, where he stayed until 1929.

In the later part of 1925, Harry&#x27;s younger brother Sam had also acquired a radio station, KFWB. After acquiring his radio station, Sam decided to make an attempt to use synchronized sound in future Warner Bros. Pictures. Harry had initial reservations about the idea; when Sam first made this suggestion, Harry wanted to focus on background music before delving into people talking on screen. Harry responded, &quot;We could ultimately develop sound to the point where people ask for talking pictures&quot; The company also began acquiring theaters. Eventually, Warner Bros. came to own and operate some 250 theaters. By February 1926, however, the brothers&#x27; radio business had failed, and the studio was facing a net loss of $333,413.00.

After a long period of refusing to accept the usage of sound in the company&#x27;s films, Warner agreed to use synchronized sound in Warner Bros. shorts, as long as it was only used for background music, Harry then made a visit to Western Electric&#x27;s Bell Laboratories in New York, (which younger brother Sam had visited earlier) and was impressed. One problem that occurred for the Warners, though, was the fact that the high-ups at Western Electric were perceived as anti-Semitic. Sam, though, was able to convince the high-ups to sign with the studio after his wife Lina wore a gold cross at a dinner he attended with Western Electric brass. After that, Harry signed a partnership agreement with Western Electric to use Bell Laboratories to test the sound-on-film process.

=== Godfather of Talkies ===
The success of Warner Bros.&#x27; early talkie films (&quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, &quot;The Lights of New York&quot;, &quot;The Singing Fool&quot; and &quot;The Terror&quot;) catapulted the studio into the ranks of the major studios. Flush with cash, the Warners abandoned their old location in the Poverty Row section of Hollywood and acquired a big studio in Burbank, California. As a result of this success, Warner was able to acquire the Stanley Company of America (founded by Jules E. Mastbaum), which controlled most of the first-run theaters on the East Coast. The purchase gave them a share in rival First National Pictures, of which Stanley owned one-third. After the transaction Warner was soon able to acquire William Fox’s one third remaining share in First National and now was officially the majority stockholder of the company. After the success of the studio&#x27;s 1929 First National film &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;, Harry Warner agreed to make Michael Curtiz a major director at the Burbank studio as well.

After purchasing a string of music publishers, Warner diversified the company by establishing a music subsidiary-Warner Bros. Music- and buying out additional radio companies, acquiring foreign sound patents, and adding a lithograph company as well; he even was able to produce a Broadway musical &quot;Fifty Million Frenchmen&quot;. By the time the 1st Academy Awards took place, Warner was recognized as the second most powerful figure in the movie industry, just behind MGM head Nicholas Schenck. In the wake of the success of &quot;Gold Diggers of Broadway&quot;, journalists had dubbed Warner &quot;the godfather of the talking screen.&quot; The studio&#x27;s net profit was now over $14,000,000.00. During that time, Warner soon also grew tired of the Hollywood atmosphere and acquired a twenty-two acre ranch in Mount Vernon, New York. Once Warner returned to New York, he and Albert were able to work together once again.

=== The Great Depression ===
After Albert&#x27;s advice, Jack and Harry Warner acquired the rights to three Paramount stars (William Powell, Kay Francis, and Ruth Chatterton) for salaries doubled from their previous ones. The move proved to be a success, and stockholders maintained confidence in the Warners. The first year of the Great Depression, 1930, did not badly damage the studio and Warner was even able to acquire more theaters for the studio in Atlantic City, New Jersey. During that time, Warner was engaged in a lawsuit with a Boston stockholder who accused him of trying use money from the studio&#x27;s profitable businesses to try to purchase his vast 300 shares of stock and The company however suffered a minor financial blow during the year after Motley Flint, the longtime banker for the studio, and by now also a close friend of the Warners, was murdered by an angry investor.

In the latter part of 1929, much to Harry&#x27;s dismay, younger brother Jack hired sixty-one-year-old actor George Arliss to star in the studio&#x27;s film &quot;Disraeli&quot;. To Warner&#x27;s surprise, the film Disraeli was a success at the box office, Arliss won the Academy Award for Best Actor, and Warner was convinced to make him a top star for the studio as well. During the Depression era, the studio also produced a series of gangster films; Warner Bros. soon became known as &quot;gangster studio.&quot; The studio&#x27;s first gangster film &quot;Little Caesar&quot; was a great success at the box office. After Little Caesar, the studio agreed to cast Edward Robinson in a wave of gangster pictures. The studio&#x27;s second gangster film, &quot;The Public Enemy&quot;, also arguably made James Cagney the studio&#x27;s new top star, and the Warners were now further convinced to make more gangster films as well. Another gangster film the studio released during the Depression era was the critically acclaimed &quot;I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang&quot;. The film made Paul Muni a top studio star, and also got audiences in the United States to question the country’s legal system.

However, they would begin to feel the effects of the Depression in 1931. As ticket prices became unaffordable, the studio would lose money. By the end of 1931, the studio suffered a net loss of reportedly $8,000,000.00, During that time, Warner rented the Teddington Studios in southwest London. Hoping to fight off the financial problems the Depression gave the studio, Warner Bros was now focused on making films for the London market and Irving Asher was appointed as the Teddington Studio&#x27;s head producer. Unfortunately, the Teddington studio could not bring in additional profit for the Warners, and the Burbank studio lost $14,000,000 in 1932 as well. In 1934, Warner officially bought out the struggling Teddington Studio.

However, relief would come for the studio after Franklin Roosevelt became US president in 1933 and the New Deal revived the US Economy. Moviegoers returned and during the year the studio was able to make a very profitable picture, &quot;42nd Street&quot;, revived the studio&#x27;s musical films business. However, in 1933, a blow happened as the studio&#x27;s longtime head producer Darryl F. Zanuck quit over disagreements with Harry Warner, which included Warner being strongly against allowing Zanuck’s film &quot;Baby Face&quot; to step outside the Hays Code boundaries; and refusing to restore Zanuck’s salary, which had been reduced as a result of the financial woes the studio temporarily faced from President Roosevelt&#x27;s bank holiday - let alone raise it in the wake of the New Deal&#x27;s economic rebound. After Zanuck&#x27;s resignation, studio director Hal B. Wallis became the studio&#x27;s executive producer, and Harry who along with his brother Jack, was a notable &quot;penny-pincher&quot; finally agreed to bring salaries back up to industry expectations again.

In 1933, the studio was able to bring newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s Cosmopolitan films into the Warner Bros. fold. Hearst had previously been signed with MGM, but he ended his ties with the company after a dispute with the company&#x27;s head producer Irving Thalberg over the treatment of Marion Davies; Davies was a longtime mistress of Hearst, and was now struggling to draw box office success. Through the studio&#x27;s partnership with Hearst, Harry&#x27;s younger brother Jack was able to sign Davies to a studio contract as well. However, Hearst&#x27;s company and Davies&#x27; films could not increase the studio&#x27;s net profits.

In 1934, the studio had a net loss of over $2,500,000; $500,000 of the loss was the result of physical damage to the Warner Bros. Burbank studio which occurred after a massive fire broke out in the studio around the end of 1934 destroying twenty years&#x27; worth of early Warner Bros. films. The next year, Hearst&#x27;s film adaption of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; failed at the box office and the studio&#x27;s net loss increased. During that time, Warner was indicted, along with six other Hollywood studio figures who owned movie theaters, of conspiracy to violate the Sherman Antitrust Act through an attempt to gain a monopoly over theaters in the St. Louis area. In 1935, Warner, along with executives at RKO and Paramount, were put on trial for this charge. After a mistrial, Warner sold the company&#x27;s movie theaters, at least for a short time, and the case was never reopened. One problem that remained for Warner, however, was that the studio&#x27;s projectionist labor union had fallen under Mafia control.

In 1935, the studio&#x27;s revived musicals also had a major blow after director Busby Berkeley was arrested after killing three people while driving drunk one night. During the studio&#x27;s union crisis, Warner received a threatening phone call from a union member saying that he would seize Warner&#x27;s daughter Betty and adopted daughter Lita within forty-eight hours. Warner then agreed to accept the union&#x27;s demands, and the kidnapping threat ended. However, in 1935 Harry got some relief as the studio rebounded with a year-end net profit of $674,158.00. Around that time, a depressed Warner—seeing that the newly recovered business no longer needed loans to pay off debts—decided to go to California and acquired of ranch land just northwest of Hollywood in Calabasas, California. He later moved to a 1,100-acre ranch in the San Fernando Valley.

During 1936, the studio&#x27;s film &quot;The Story of Louis Pasteur&quot; was a success at the box office. In addition to the film&#x27;s box office success, Paul Muni won the Oscar for Best Actor in March 1937 for his performance as the title role. The studio&#x27;s film &quot;The Life of Emile Zola&quot; (1937), also starring Muni, gave the studio its first Oscar for Best Picture.

== World War II ==
Warner occupied a central place in the Hollywood-Washington wartime propaganda effort during the Second World War, and by the end of 1942, served as a frequent, anti-Axis spokesman for the movie industry. Despite his conservative viewpoint and longtime affiliation with the Republican Party, Warner was also a close friend of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and supported him during the early 1930s. During Roosevelt&#x27;s fight for the Democratic nomination in early 1932, the Warners made an effort to make his name known throughout the state of California. After Roosevelt was nominated, the three brothers asked their friends to contribute to his campaign. Jack Warner even staged a &quot;Motion Picture and Electrical Parade Sports Pageant&quot; at L.A. Stadium in Roosevelt&#x27;s honor in 1932. During Roosevelt&#x27;s 1932 campaign, Warner and the studio also contributed $10,000.00 to the Democratic National Committee. In the wake of Nazi Germany&#x27;s rise to power, Warner became a key proponent of US intervention in Europe.

Prior to the beginning of the war in Europe, Warner had produced a series of film shorts which glorified America&#x27;s fight against Germany during World War I; Warner later received an honorary award for producing the shorts. By the fall of 1938, Warner had gradually helped block the distribution of Warner Bros. films in Nazi Germany and its ally Italy. Prior to the war&#x27;s beginning in Europe, Warner supervised the production of two anti-German feature films, &quot;The Life of Emile Zola&quot; (1937) and &quot;Confessions of a Nazi Spy&quot; (1939). He spent large sums of money to get many of his relatives and employees out of Germany when the war officially began in the latter part of 1939. Before the U.S. officially entered World War II, Warner supervised the production of three more anti-German films: &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; (1940), which portrayed Spain&#x27;s King Phillip II as an equivalent to Adolf Hitler; &quot;Sergeant York&quot; (1941), and &quot;You&#x27;re in the Army Now&quot; (1941).

After America&#x27;s entry into the war, Warner decided to focus on making just war films. During the duration of the war these included &quot;Casablanca&quot;, &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;, &quot;This Is the Army,&quot; and the controversial film &quot;Mission to Moscow&quot;. At the premieres of &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot; (in Los Angeles, New York, and London), audiences for the film purchased a total of $15,600,000.00 in war bonds for the governments of England and the United States. By the middle of 1943, however, it became clear that audiences were tired of war films. Despite the growing pressure to abandon the topic, Warner continued to produce them, losing money in the process. Eventually, in honor of studio contributions to the war cause, the United States Government would name a Liberty Ship after the brothers&#x27; father, Benjamin Warner, and Warner would be given the honor of christening the ship. By the time the war ended, $20,000,000.00 worth of war bonds would be purchased through the studio, the Red Cross collected 5,200 pints of plasma from studio employees, and 763 studio employees, including Warner&#x27;s son-in-law Milton Sperling and nephew Jack Warner Jr., served in the U.S. armed forces.

After a dispute over ownership of &quot;Casablanca&quot;&#x27;s Oscar for Best Picture, head producer Hal B. Wallis broke with Warner and resigned from the studio. After &quot;Casablanca&quot;, Humphrey Bogart became arguably the studio&#x27;s top star. In 1943, Olivia de Havilland (whom Warner was now loaning to different companies) sued Jack Warner for breach of contract. De Havilland cited that the government laws only required employee contracts to reach a maximum of seven years; When de Havilland won her case many of the studio&#x27;s longtime actors were freed of their contracts. To help retain them, Harry decided to eliminate the studio&#x27;s suspension policy.

== Postwar era ==
In 1947, Warner, who was by now exhausted from all his years of arguing with his brother Jack, decided to spend more time at his San Fernando Valley ranch and to expand his interest in horse racing. Along with brother Jack, in 1938, Harry Warner became one of the founders of Hollywood Park Racetrack. In partnership with Mervyn Le Roy, he created the W-L Ranch Co. Thoroughbred racing stable. In 1947, the Warner-LeRoy stable was able to acquire a valuable racehorse named &quot;Stepfather.&quot; Warner had a bitter rivalry with his brother Jack over the years, particularly due to Jack&#x27;s longtime infidelities (as Jack had been engaged in affairs with a wide range of various women since Warner Bros. Inc. was established in 1923) and waste of the Burbank studio&#x27;s money. In the 1930s Harry, like most of his relatives, also refused to accept Jack&#x27;s second wife, actress Ann Paige - with whom Jack had an affair while still married to his first wife Irma Solomon - as a member of the Warner clan. When Jack and Ann officially got married in January 1936, Harry and the rest of the Warner family refused to attend the ceremony. In a letter Harry sent to Jack on his wedding day to Ann, Harry said &quot;the only thing that could come from this day was that our parents didn&#x27;t live to see this.&quot;

Throughout the early years of the studio&#x27;s existence, various people, including Warner&#x27;s younger brother Sam, were buffers between Harry and Jack. The last person to serve as a buffer between the two, father Benjamin Warner, died on November 5, 1935. After Benjamin&#x27;s death, Jack and Harry were now barely on speaking terms, and were merely just business partners to one another. Jack&#x27;s marriage to Ann was also arguably a huge turning point in the two brothers&#x27; fragile relationship as well; Harry&#x27;s arguments with Jack were now practically on a daily basis.

By the early 1950s, the brothers&#x27; long-simmering feud had risen to new heights, as Jack began spending a lot of his time in France, occasionally ignored managing the studio in favor of vacationing, gambling, and socializing with royalty, and spent studio money lavishly on 3-D films. On one occasion during that time, studio employees claimed they saw Harry Warner who was very furious at his brother Jack chase him through the studio with a lead pipe, shouting &quot;I&#x27;ll get you for this, you son of a b_&quot;.

The studio prospered post-war time, and by 1946, company payroll had reached $600,000 a week for studio employees, and the studio&#x27;s net profit would reach $19,424,650.00 by the end of the year as well. During that time, Warner hired his son-in-law, Milton Sperling, to head an independent film production company for the studio. In 1947, Harry also tried to move Warner Bros. headquarters from the longtime New York building to the Burbank area, but was unsuccessful. By the end of 1947, the studio had a record net profit of $22,000,000.00, although the following year, the studio profits would decrease by 50%.

During that time, the studio was a party to the &quot;United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.&quot; antitrust case. The suit, brought by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, claimed that the five integrated studio-theater chain combinations restrained competition. The Supreme Court heard the case in 1948, and ruled for the government. As a result, Warner and four other major studios were forced to separate production from exhibition. In early 1953, the brothers finally fulfilled their end of the bargain and sold their theater chain to Fabian Enterprises. In 1948, Bette Davis, now fed up with Jack Warner, was a big problem for Harry after she and a number of her colleagues, departed from the studio after finishing the film &quot;Beyond the Forest&quot;. By 1949, the studio&#x27;s net profit had fallen to $10,000,000.00, and the studio would soon suffer more losses with the rise of television.

In 1949, Warner, seeing the threat of television grow, decided to shift his focus towards television production. However, the Federal Communications Commission would not allow Warner to do so. After an unsuccessful attempt to convince other movie studio bosses to switch their focus to television, he abandoned his television efforts. As the threat of television grew in the early 1950s, Warner&#x27;s younger brother, Jack, decided to try a new approach to help regain profits for the studio. In the wake of United Artists&#x27; successful 3-D film &quot;Bwana Devil&quot;, Jack decided to expand into 3-D films with the studio&#x27;s film &quot;House of Wax&quot; (1953). While the film proved successful for the studio, 3-D films soon lost their appeal among moviegoers. After the downfall of 3-D films, Warner decided to use CinemaScope in future Warner Bros. films. One of the studio&#x27;s first CinemaScope films, &quot;The High and Mighty&quot;, brought the studio some profit.

In 1954, Warner and his brother Jack were finally able to engage in the new television medium, providing ABC with a weekly show, &quot;Warner Bros. Presents&quot;. &quot;Warner Bros. Presents&quot; was not a success. In 1955, the studio was able to debut a very successful western television drama, &quot;Cheyenne&quot; The studio then followed up with a series of Western dramas such as &quot;Maverick&quot;, &quot;Bronco&quot; and &quot;Colt .45&quot;. The studio&#x27;s television westerns, indeed, helped compensate for the net losses that the studio was now given at the box office Within a few years, Warner, who was accustomed to dealing with actors in a high-handed manner, provoked hostility among emerging television stars like James Garner, who filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. over a contract dispute. Jack Warner was angered by the perceived ingratitude of television actors who seemed to show more independence than film actors, and this deepened his contempt for the new medium. Through this success, Warner began to be known as the &quot;Strategic Generalissimo&quot; by his employees.

By 1956, the studio&#x27;s profits had dropped to new lows. Warner and Jack&#x27;s tumultuous relationship worsened when Warner learned of Jack&#x27;s decision to sell the Warner Bros.&#x27; pre-1949 films to Associated Artists Productions for the modest sum of $21 million. &quot;This is our heritage, what we worked all our lives to create, and now it is gone,&quot; Warner exclaimed, upon hearing of the deal. Shortly after doing this, Jack took a long vacation in southern France. The brothers&#x27; fragile relationship had reached a new low.

== Retirement ==
In May 1956, the brothers announced they were putting Warner Bros. on the market. Jack, however, had secretly organized a syndicate, headed by Boston banker Serge Semenenko, which purchased 90% (800,000 shares) of the company&#x27;s stock; At first Harry rejected Semenenko&#x27;s earlier offer to purchase his stock in February 1956, but later accepted the offer after Semenenko increased his bid and agreed to make Simon Fabian—the head of Fabian Enterprises who had also become a friend of the Warners—president of Warner Bros. After the three brothers sold their stock, Jack (through his under-the-table deal with Sememenko) joined Semenenko&#x27;s syndicate and bought back all his stock, which consisted of 200,000 shares. The deal was completed in July 1956. Jack, who was now the company&#x27;s largest stockholder, named himself president.

Warner found out about Jack&#x27;s dealing while reading an article in &quot;Variety&quot; on May 31, 1956 and collapsed after reading the news. The next day, he checked into Cedars of Lebanon Hospital and doctors told him he had a suffered a minor heart attack the previous day. While at the hospital, Warner had a stroke that impaired his walking ability and forced him to use a cane for the rest of his life. Six days after his stroke, he left the hospital and decided to sell 42 of his thoroughbred racehorses. The subterfuge proved too much for Warner and he and his family never spoke to Jack again; when Jack made a surprise appearance at Harry&#x27;s San Fernando ranch, to attend Harry&#x27;s 1957 wedding anniversary to Rea Levinson, nobody in the Warner family attending the event spoke to Jack. All Warner was now dedicated to doing was raising horses.

Shortly after that when Jack was away one day, Warner made one last visit to the studio to take out of his old studio account. He gave $3 million to his wife Rea, and $1.5 million each to his two daughters Doris and Betty. In the meantime, he sold a large portion of the remaining studio stock he had to Semenenko and made sure he never came near the Burbank studio ever again.

== Personal life ==
On August 23, 1907, Warner married his girlfriend, Rea Levinson. It has been reported by family members that Harry dedicated a huge chunk of his life to make Rea happy. Harry and Rea had three children: Lewis Ethan (b. October 10, 1908), Doris (b. September 13, 1913), and Betty Leah (b. May 4, 1920). Harry and his family were also very faithful to Jewish customs and traditions.

On April 5, 1931, Warner&#x27;s son Lewis, whom he appointed as head of Warner Bros. Music, died after he had an infected, impacted wisdom tooth extracted, which led to sepsis and then double pneumonia. After Lewis&#x27; death, Warner, who was now left without a recognized heir to his empire, descended into an extreme state of depression. In 1932, the Warners donated a theater in Lewis&#x27; honor to Worcester Academy, Lewis&#x27; alma mater. Warner also felt his brother Sam&#x27;s widow, actress Lina Basquette, was a tramp and not worthy of raising a child with the last name Warner. While Jack didn&#x27;t mind that Lina was Catholic, Harry and the rest of the Warner family did. They refused to have any part in Lina&#x27;s life, and did not acknowledge her as being a member of the Warner clan.

In 1930, Basquette went broke and Warner decided to file for guardianship over Sam and Lina&#x27;s daughter, Lita. On March 19, 1930, Warner and his wife Rea became the legal guardians of Lita through a $300,000 settlement in Lita&#x27;s trust fund. Basquette was never financially able to take care of or regain custody of Lita and in 1931, she tried to commit suicide by poison. After her suicide attempt, Basquette only saw her daughter on two occasions in the next twenty years. In 1947, Basquette filed for a large share of Sam&#x27;s estate, which was by now worth $15,000,000 in stocks alone. Basquette claimed that the Warner brothers reorganized Sam&#x27;s will under New York statutes, while Sam died while living in California, where, at the time of Sam&#x27;s death in 1927, laws gave widows a larger share in their husband&#x27;s wills. The lawsuit eventually ended when Basquette settled for a $100,000 trust fund from Harry&#x27;s fortune.

Warner&#x27;s daughter, Doris, was married to director Mervyn LeRoy on January 3, 1934. Warner, with no male heir to his studio after Lewis died, made LeRoy his new heir to the Warner Bros. studio. Harry two grandchildren, Warner Lewis LeRoy (1935-2001) and Linda LeRoy Janklow (b. 1939) (married to Morton L. Janklow) through Doris, his daughter. On one occasion, in the late 1930s, Doris read a copy of Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; and became interested making a film adaption of the book for the studio as well; Doris then offered Mitchell $50,000 for the book&#x27;s screen rights. However, Uncle Jack refused to allow the deal to take place, after seeing how expensive the film&#x27;s budget would have been for the studio. The couple divorced on August 12, 1945, and Warner was left without an heir again. Two months after her divorce from LeRoy, Doris and director Charles Vidor got married. They had three sons, Michael, Brian and Quentin. Doris and Charles were married until his death in 1959.

In 1936, Betty Warner began an affair with one of Darryl F. Zanuck&#x27;s assistants Milton Sperling. They married on July 13, 1939. Betty Warner and Milton Sperling had four children, Susan (b. December 4, 1941), Karen (b. April 8, 1945), and Cass (b. March 8, 1948), and Matthew. The two remained married for twenty-four years. In 1964, Betty married Stanley Sheinbaum. His granddaughter, Cass Warner Sperling, and her husband, actor Wings Hauser are the parents of actor Cole Hauser.

== Death ==
Warner died on July 25, 1958, from a cerebral occlusion. Some people close to Harry, however, believed he died of a broken heart; Harry&#x27;s wife Rea even stated, after Harry&#x27;s funeral took place, that &quot;he didn&#x27;t die, Jack killed him.&quot; He left an estate valued at $6,000,000 with 50% bequeathed to his wife and 25% to each of his daughters, Doris and Betty (married to producer Milton Sperling). For his contributions to the motion picture industry, Harry Warner has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6441 Hollywood Boulevard.

== Legacy ==
In 2004, Slippery Rock University in Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania dedicated a film institute to him. The university also hosts an annual Harry Warner film festival.

== In popular culture ==
* In an episode of &quot;Millionaire Hot Seat&quot; in Australia, contestant Barry Soraghan had a question for $1 million, which was about the Warner Brothers and which one of them had died on the eve of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;. Harry Warner was incorrectly identified as the Warner brother who died on the eve of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (Sam was the correct answer).

<text>A swap body, exchangeable container or interchangeable unit, is one of the types of standard freight containers for road and rail transport.

Based on and very similar to the more widespread shipping containers (ISO containers), swap bodies normally have the same external dimensions for the bottom corner fittings as ISO shipping containers so that they can be placed on the same kinds of trucks, trailers and railroad cars designed for shipping containers. However, ISO containers inner dimensions (2.33 m wide) are just a few centimetres too short to accommodate European-pool pallets () without leaving much empty space. To optimise the carriage of pallets, wide bodies are often scaled to the maximum width allowed for standard road trucks and railroad cars and to a different length without leaving empty space.

On the other hand, swap bodies do not have upper corner fittings, are not stackable and must be lifted by the bottom frame. Thus, they require special handling when transported by rail and are unsuitable for ship-based overseas transportation.
Swap bodies take advantage of the large number of trailers used to carry standard ISO containers. The design of swap bodies and roller containers is optimized to minimize empty weight, saving on trucking fuel cost (less dead weight to be transported) and the cost of building reloading terminals.

Due to security concerns, an increasing number of swap bodies have a hard surface instead of curtains and tarpaulins.

Swap bodies are typically more expensive than equivalent payload ISO containers. This is because the ISO containers used in Europe are typically manufactured in China, whereas swap bodies are made in Europe (central Europe and the UK). This extra cost is offset by the lighter weight of the body and increased cargo capacity, resulting in fuel savings during transport.

Many swap bodies are fitted with four up-folding legs under their frame. These legs make it possible to change, or &quot;swap&quot;, their body from one carriage to another, or to leave the swap body at a destination, without using extra equipment such as a crane or hoist.

Special swap bodies may have more doors or sliding panels than ordinary hard boxes for trucks, railroad cars, or sea containers. This feature makes unloading and loading faster and easier.

Many swap bodies are fitted with keyhole tracks. These secure a range of extras such as shoring bars and cargo nets to extend its uses in various applications. Recently a second flooring using folding shelves has been used to aid postal companies.

Special steel frames or racks are available in certain container ships and container marshalling yards to hoist swap bodies from topside.

All swap bodies are subject to extensive non-destructive (in most cases) testing, some in-house others not, regulated by certifying authorities.

Basic standardization is set with Euronorms EN 283, EN 284 and EN 452 for construction and design, as well as EN 13044 for marking and identification. The panel responsible for developing standards is CEN/TC 119. The outcome of this panel has not yet provided any contribution to automation, as handling the swap bodies is a traditional haulage business with truck drivers involved.

Swap bodies in Europe are all manufactured to a DIN standard of DIN EN 283. In the United States there are no standard sizes. Demountable Concepts, Inc., however maintains compliance will all applicable cargo securement standards for its swap bodies.

<doc id="1298644" wikidata="Q4724171" url="?curid=1298644" title="Algernon Sidney Buford">
<text>Algernon Sidney Buford (January 2, 1826 – May 6, 1911) was a Virginian businessman, politician, and lawyer best known for his 22-year presidency of the Richmond and Danville Railroad, during which he was responsible for growing the line from 140 miles in length to 3,000 miles in length. Born in North Carolina to parents of Virginia stock, Buford grew up in Pittsylvania County, Virginia and attended the University of Virginia from 1846 to 1848, graduating with a Bachelor of Law. For the next decade, he practiced law in Pittsylvania and Danville and became the owner and editor of the &quot;Danville Register&quot;. These occupations were interrupted by a year&#x27;s service in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1853.

When the Civil War broke out in Spring 1861, Buford enlisted in the Confederate States Army and was assigned to the Army of Northern Virginia, in which he served until Fall 1861. At that point, the residents of Pittsylvania County again elected him to the House of Delegates. During the war, Virginia Governor John Letcher brevetted Buford a lieutenant colonel in the Virginia militia. In this position, Buford watched over sick and injured Confederate troops at &quot;Buford&#x27;s Home&quot; and forwarded important military supplies to soldiers on the front lines. After Appomattox in April 1865, Buford resigned from the legislature and returned to Danville. He was elected President of the Richmond and Danville Railroad on September 13, 1865, and consequently moved back to Richmond in early 1866.

Over the next two decades, Buford guided the railroad through its best years. In 1866, the R&amp;D had 154 miles of track and $284,790 in profit. By 1886, it had grown to 2,670 miles of track and $1,767,662 in profit. Adjusting for deflation in the late 19th century, Buford delivered a 1,050% growth in profit over 20 years. In the course of those years, however, the controlling interests in the company became contrary to Buford&#x27;s established policies of management and he tendered his resignation in late 1886.

For the next few years of his life, Buford devoted himself to the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical Society and served as its president for four years. In 1893, he ran for governor of Virginia but was defeated by Charles T. O&#x27;Ferrall. He was also involved with the direction of the Merchants National Bank of Richmond. In 1911, Algernon S. Buford died at his home in Richmond and was buried at Hollywood Cemetery.

== Early life (1826–1865) ==

Buford was a graduate of the University of Virginia, and came to Chatham, Virginia, to enter the practice of law. His choice was understandable, since several illustrious attorneys had established practices in the town, including Whitmell Pugh Tunstall, who had been the creator and first president of the Richmond and Danville Railroad.

Buford was related to Tunstall. He was Tunstall&#x27;s nephew-in-law and in manner of speaking, his brother-in-law as well. He married Emily Winifred Townes, daughter of George Townes and Eliza Barker Tunstall. Eliza was the older sister of Whitmell P. Tunstall, and had reared him after the death of their mother.

Buford represented Pittsylvania County in the Virginia House of Delegates during 1853 and 1854.

During the American Civil War, in 1863, Buford was in charge of the Virginia Depot, on 13th street, south of Cary Street, (Shockoe Slip), in Richmond. After the war, he became known as Col. Buford.

== President of the Richmond and Danville Railroad (1865–1887) ==

Over the next two decades, Buford guided the railroad through its best years. In 1866, the R&amp;D had 154 miles of track, $672,714 in earnings, $284,790 in profit, 25 locomotives, and 285 total cars. By 1886, it had grown to 2,670 miles of track, $3,981,355 in earnings, $1,767,662 in profit, 126 locomotives, and 2,551 total cars. Adjusting for deflation in the late 19th century (i.e., converting 1866 USD to 1886 USD), the 1866 earnings decrease to $397,705 and profit decreases to $168,366. When the 1886 numbers are taken as percentages of the 1866 numbers, the growth rates in earnings and profit are given: 1,001% growth in earnings and 1,050% growth in profit.

With the support of Virginia Governor Francis H. Pierpont, on September 13, 1865, Colonel Buford became president of the Richmond and Danville Railroad (R&amp;D). Damage from the war, including the bridge across the James River between Manchester and Richmond was repaired.

Over the next 20 years, as R&amp;D President, Col. Buford extended the trackage to three thousand miles. The R&amp;D&#x27;s early acquisitions included the Piedmont Railroad in 1866, and the North Carolina Railroad in 1871.

In 1872, the R&amp;D extended aid to the Atlanta and Richmond Air Line Railway to help it complete its road between Charlotte and Atlanta. The line was to become a key link in the &quot;Piedmont Air Line&quot;, a system of railroads across the southeast.

In 1878, the R&amp;D acquired the Charlotte, Columbia and Augusta Railroad.

In 1880, the Richmond and West Point Terminal Railway and Warehouse Company was chartered to acquire railroads which the R&amp;D could not acquire directly due to a limitation in its charter. One of these was the former Richmond and York River Railroad. The Terminal Company quickly purchased over of existing railroads and acquired the franchises for a number of projected lines including the Georgia Pacific Railway and the Rabun Gap Short Line Railway.

In 1881, the R&amp;D leased the Piedmont Air Line system, by then renamed Atlanta and Charlotte Air Line Railway, forming the Richmond and Danville Railroad System.

In 1885, the R&amp;D bought the Lawrenceville-to-Suwanee line in Georgia from the Lawrenceville Branch Railroad. This line was sold to the Atlanta and Charlotte Air Line Railway in 1908, and was abandoned in 1920.

The R&amp;D leased the North Eastern Railroad (Georgia) in 1886. In 1887, the Terminal Company gained control of the East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railway.

In 1888, the Terminal Company purchased the entire capital stock of the Georgia Company, which held a controlling interest in the Central Railroad and Banking Company. In 1889, the Georgia Pacific Railway was completed and began operation from Atlanta to Greenville, Mississippi. It had been leased to the R&amp;D in January of that year.

In 1890, the Terminal Company acquired a controlling interest in the Alabama Great Southern Railroad.

By 1890, the R&amp;D System covered of track in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Texas. However, the R&amp;D System had become financially unstable during all the growth. In 1892, the R&amp;D and subsidiaries entered receivership.

Reorganized by J.P. Morgan and his New York banking firm of Drexel, Morgan and Company, they emerged in 1894 as the Southern Railway Company, which controlled over of line at its inception. In 1980, Southern Railway Company later became part of Norfolk Southern Railway.

== After the R&amp;D (1887–1911) ==
After his retirement from the presidency of the Richmond and Danville, Buford remained active in Richmond society. On the night of May 6, 1911, Colonel Buford died at his residence at 20 West Franklin Street in Richmond. His funeral was held on May 8 at Broad Street Methodist Church, which he had attended for many years. He was buried in Hollywood Cemetery.

Buford married three times. His first marriage was to Emily Whitmell Townes (1830–1859) of Pittsylvania in December 1854, with whom he had three daughters: Elizabeth T. &quot;Lizzie&quot; (1856–1859), Susan A. (1857–1859), and Emily Townes (1859–1938), married Col. Clement E. Manly (1853–1928) of North Carolina. Emily died in November 1859 and Buford remarried to Kate Aubrey Wortham (1843–1875) of Richmond in December 1869. They had two daughters: Catherine &quot;Kate&quot; Thomas (1871–1963), married Walter T. L. Livingston (1871–1930); and Elizabeth &quot;Lizzie&quot; Gilmer (1873–1880). After Kate&#x27;s death in 1875, Buford remarried for the third and final time to Mary Cameron Strother (née Ross, 1848–1916), the widow of Robert Q. Strother (1844–1873), in May 1879. They had three children: Algernon Sidney Jr. (1880–1951), married Elisabeth Lanier Dunn (1884–1980); Mary Ross (1883–1962), married Frederick E. Nolting (1872–1955); and William Erskine (1887–1954), married Sarah Sergeant Oppenheimer (1894–1972).

== Legacy ==

Bon Air, Virginia, was developed as a resort community of Richmond located west on the Richmond and Danville Railroad.

Col. Buford personally (as well as through the Richmond and Danville Railroad) was much involved in the development of the community, originally known as Brown&#x27;s Summit, later renamed Grand Summit, and eventually renamed again Bon Air), derived from the French expression for &quot;good air&quot;. In 1877, he was among the first investors and officers in the Bon Air Land and Improvement Company. Other R&amp;D officials involved in the development of Bon Air were General Thomas M. Logan, Col. Andrew Talcott, and Talcott&#x27;s son, Thomas Mann Randolph Talcott. Among Bon Air&#x27;s residents of the period was druggist Polk Miller, who founded Sergeant&#x27;s Pet Care Products and became a notable musician.

Buford is memorialized by the naming of the thoroughfare Buford Road in Bon Air, Virginia.

Buford, Georgia, a town (and later a city) on a portion for the Richmond and Danville Railroad system was named for him.

<text>Georges Alphonse Fleury Izambard (; 11 December 1848 in Paris – February 1931) was a French school teacher, best known as the teacher and benefactor of poet Arthur Rimbaud. He taught at the Collège de Charleville in Charleville, where his nickname was &quot;Zanzibar&quot;.

On 4 May 1870, Rimbaud&#x27;s mother wrote to Izambard to complain about him giving Rimbaud Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Les Misérables&quot; to read. In May 1871, Rimbaud sent an important letter to Izambard. In this letter, (which includes the poem &quot;Le Cœur supplicié&quot;), he affirms that he wants to be a poet, and that he is working to become a &quot;voyant&quot;:

:&quot;Je veux être poète, et je travaille à me rendre voyant : vous ne comprendrez pas du tout, et je ne saurais presque vous expliquer. Il s&#x27;agit d&#x27;arriver à l&#x27;inconnu par le dérèglement de tous les sens. Les souffrances sont énormes, mais il faut être fort, être né poète, et je me suis reconnu poète. Ce n&#x27;est pas du tout ma faute. C&#x27;est faux de dire : Je pense : on devrait dire : On me pense. − Pardon du jeu de mots. − Je est un autre. Tant pis pour le bois qui se trouve violon, et nargue aux inconscients, qui ergotent sur ce qu&#x27;ils ignorent tout à fait !&quot;

Translated: 
:I wish to be a poet, and I am working to make myself into a seer: you will not understand at all, and I would not nearly know how to explain it to you. It&#x27;s a question of coming to the unknown through the disordering of all the senses. The suffering is enormous, but one must be strong, be born a poet, and I have come to terms with my destiny as a poet. It&#x27;s not at all my fault. It&#x27;s wrong to say &quot;I think&quot;; one ought to say &quot;I am being thought&quot; - Forgive the play on words - I is another. Too bad for the wood which finds itself a violin, and brush off the oblivious, who quibble over things they know nothing about!

<text>Mohamed Mounir (; born October 10, 1954) is an Egyptian singer and actor, with a musical career spanning more than four decades. He incorporates various genres into his music, including classical Egyptian music, Nubian music, Blues, Jazz and Reggae. His lyrics are noted both for their philosophical content and for their passionate social and political commentary. He is affectionately known by his fans as &quot;El King&quot; in reference to his album and play &quot;El Malek Howwa El Malek&quot; (The King is The King). Mounir&#x27;s family is from Nubia, Southern Aswan, Egypt.

In April 2021, he appeared in the opening musical sequence as a singer for the Pharaohs&#x27; Golden Parade on an Egyptian funerary boat on the lake in front of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization.

==Early life==
Born into a Nubian family in Aswan, Mounir spent most of his early childhood in the village of Manshyat Al Nubia, where he shared his father&#x27;s interests in both music and politics. As a teenager, he and his family were forced to relocate to Cairo when his village was lost in the floods that followed the construction of the Aswan Dam. It was here that he studied photography at the Faculty of Applied Arts at Helwan University. During this period, he would often sing for friends and family at social gatherings. His singing voice was noticed by the lyricist Abdel-Rehim Mansour, who would go on to introduce Mounir to the renowned folk singer Ahmed Mounib.

==Musical career==
Following his college graduation, he was called up for military service in 1974, during which he continued his professional musical career by performing in various concerts. He performed his first such concert in 1975. Although the public were initially critical of Mounir for performing in casual attire at a time where many Egyptian singers were expected to wear suits, they eventually warmed to his laidback image.

After completing his military service, Mounir released his 1977 debut solo album &quot;Alemony Eneeki&quot; on the Sonar record label. Mounir went on to release five more consecutive official albums and featured on one soundtrack album under the Sonar label. To date, Mounir has released a total 22 official albums and featured on six soundtrack albums under a number of different record labels.

Mounir&#x27;s single &quot;Maddad&quot; from this album caused controversy, as its lyrics could be interpreted as a call for intercession from Muhammad. Among Muslims there are differing views as to whether Muhammad can provide intercession between God&#x27;s and his believers. This resulted in the music video being banned from Egyptian television for a time. Mounir responded by saying &quot;It is this fight against rigid thought that makes something out of you&quot;.

On his 2003 follow-up album &quot;Ahmar Shafayef&quot; (Red Lipstick), he returned to his more familiar style of mainly secular lyrics. In the summer of 2003, following the release of this album, Mounir toured Austria, Germany and Switzerland alongside the Austrian pop musician Hubert von Goisern, and later that year the two musicians performed at a concert in Asyut.

In May 2004, he held a large concert at the pyramids of Giza, during which he was physically attacked by a drunken fan. Despite sustaining minor injuries, he continued his performance until the end of the concert.

He continued recording albums infused with social commentary with the release of his 2005 album &quot;Embareh Kan Omry Eshren&quot; (&quot;Yesterday I Was Twenty&quot;) and his album &quot;Ta&#x27;m El Beyout&quot; (&quot;Taste of Homes&quot;), released in 2008. &quot;Ta&#x27;m El Beyout&quot; was noted for its creativity, but initially did not perform as well as expected in terms of album sales. In 2012, Mounir released his album &quot;Ya Ahl El Arab we Tarab&quot;.

In 2008, Mounir postponed his New Year&#x27;s Eve concert at Cairo Opera House in solidarity with the Palestinians suffering the effects of the Gaza War. He issued the statement: &quot;Delaying the concert is a message sent to the whole world, so that it would move forward and help the people in Gaza.&quot;

He headlined the Liverpool Arabic Arts Festival 2010 on July 9, at the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall. He is the predecessor to recent musical groups like Black Theama

In February 2021, Mounir announced that he would be playing at concerts in Jerusalem, Haifa, Ramallah and Gaza City, to be the first Egyptian musician to perform in Israel, as he mentioned: &quot;I will be a peace delegate, like Sadat&quot;. However, he later declared that he would only tour the Palestinian cities of Ramallah and Gaza.

==Acting career==
As well as his career as a popular singer, Mounir also has an active acting career. He has appeared in 12 movies, 4 television series and 3 plays. His movie career began in 1982, when he acted in Youssef Chahine&#x27;s film &quot;″Hadouta Masreia&quot; (&quot;An Egyptian Story&quot;), also being featured on the soundtrack album. In 1997 he played the role of the bard in another movie by Youssef Chahine, the French-Egyptian historical drama &quot;Al Maseer&quot; (&quot;Destiny&quot;), which was screened out of competition at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival.

Mounir played the part of the blind poetry professor &quot;Bashir&quot; in the controversial 2005 film &quot;Dunia&quot;, which centers around the title character Dunia, a belly dancer and poet played by Egyptian actress Hanan Tork. When the film was shown at the 2005 Cairo International Film Festival, it left the audience split between those supporting the film&#x27;s calls for women&#x27;s rights and its message against female genital mutilation, and those disapproving of either the title character&#x27;s desire to express herself through dance, or of the scenes shot in Cairo&#x27;s slums, judged as tarnishing Egypt&#x27;s international image.

<doc id="1298665" wikidata="Q3495362" url="?curid=1298665" title="Tales from the White Hart">
<text>Tales from the White Hart is a collection of short stories by science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, in the &quot;club tales&quot; style.

Thirteen of the fifteen stories originally appeared across a number of different publications; some had no connection to the White Hart in their original version. &quot;Silence Please&quot; was the title of two distinct stories; the version in the book has a different plot from the original magazine version. &quot;Moving Spirit&quot; and &quot;The Defenestration of Ermintrude Inch&quot; were first published in this book and hence presumably were written specifically for it. &quot;The Defenestration of Ermintrude Inch&quot; rounds off the cycle of stories and explicitly mentions their book publication.

The White Hart is a pub (modelled on the White Horse, New Fetter Lane, just north of Fleet Street, once the weekly rendezvous of science fiction fans in London till the mid 50s, when they moved to the Globe pub in Hatton Garden) where a character named Harry Purvis tells a series of tall tales. Incidental characters inhabiting the White Hart include science fiction writers Samuel Youd (also known as John Christopher), John Wyndham (John Beynon), and Clarke himself in addition to the narrative voice as his pseudonym Charles Willis.

The style and nature of the stories was inspired by the Jorkens stories of the writer Lord Dunsany, whom Clarke admired and with whom he corresponded, a fact humorously acknowledged by Clarke in his introduction to the first Jorkens omnibus volume.

According to Clarke&#x27;s preface to the book, the book was his third collection of short stories, which were written between 1953 and 1956 in such diverse spots as New York, Miami, Colombo, London and Sydney.

One additional story from the White Hart &#x27;universe&#x27;, &quot;Let There Be Light&quot;, is reprinted in &quot;Tales of Ten Worlds&quot;.

Clarke and Stephen Baxter collaborated on one final White Hart story, &quot;Time, Gentlemen, Please&quot; for a 2007 limited edition from PS Publishing, issued for the book&#x27;s 50th anniversary. (&quot;Let There Be Light&quot; does not appear in that edition.)

==Contents==

<doc id="1298666" wikidata="Q149507" url="?curid=1298666" title="Charles Vidor">
<text>Charles Vidor (born Károly Vidor; July 27, 1899June 4, 1959) was a Hungarian film director. Among his film successes are &quot;The Bridge&quot; (1929), &quot;Double Door &quot;(1934), &quot;The Tuttles of Tahiti&quot; (1942), &quot;The Desperadoes&quot; (1943), &quot;Cover Girl&quot; (1944), &quot;Together Again&quot; (1944), &quot;A Song to Remember&quot; (1945), &quot;Over 21&quot; (1945), &quot;Gilda&quot; (1946), &quot;The Loves of Carmen&quot; (1948), &quot;Rhapsody&quot; (1954), &quot;Love Me or Leave Me&quot; (1955), &quot;The Swan&quot; (1956), &quot;The Joker Is Wild&quot; (1957), and &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; (1957).

==Life and career==
Born Károly Vidor in Budapest, Hungary, he served in the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I. He first came to prominence during the final years of the silent film era, working with Alex Korda among others. Contrary to common belief, he is not related to fellow director King Vidor (1894–1982).

===Early Hollywood career===
In 1922, Vidor emigrated to the United States. He worked as a basso for the English Grand Opera Company. He was a chorus boy in &quot;Love Song&quot; and worked on Hudson Bay as a longshoreman.

Vidor went to Hollywood where he worked as Korda&#x27;s assistant. He attracted acclaim for a low budget short he made in his spare time with his own money, &quot;The Bridge&quot; (1929). This led to a contract at Universal Pictures to work in the editorial department.

He did some uncredited directing on MGM&#x27;s &quot;The Mask of Fu Manchu&quot; (1932). His first credited feature as director was &quot;Sensation Hunters&quot; (1933) for Monogram Pictures. Vidor followed it with &quot;Double Door&quot; (1934) at Paramount.

===RKO===
Vidor accepted a contract to work at RKO Pictures. While there he directed &quot;Strangers All&quot; (1935), &quot;His Family Tree&quot; (1935), &quot;The Arizonian&quot; (1935), and &quot;Muss &#x27;Em Up&quot; (1936).

===Paramount===
Vidor went back to Paramount where he directed &quot;A Doctor&#x27;s Diary&quot; (1937), &quot;The Great Gambini&quot; (1937), and &quot;She&#x27;s No Lady&quot; (1937).

===Columbia Pictures===
Vidor signed with Columbia Pictures where he directed &quot;Romance of the Redwoods&quot; (1939), &quot;Blind Alley&quot; (1939) and &quot;Those High Grey Walls&quot; (1939). These were lower budgeted productions but they were well received. &quot;I enjoyed those little pictures&quot;, he said later.

Frank Capra got Vidor in to do some second unit work on &quot;Mr Smith Goes to Washington&quot; (1939), which was running behind schedule. Vidor directed the scenes in Smith&#x27;s home town. &quot;I had more money to spend than I was ever given to make a feature picture&quot;, he later said.

Vidor was loaned out to Edward Small to direct &quot;My Son, My Son!&quot; (1940). Back at Columbia, he began to be assigned to more prestigious films like &quot;The Lady in Question&quot; (1940). He took over from James Whale on &quot;They Dare Not Love&quot; (1941) and did &quot;Ladies in Retirement&quot; (1941).

Vidor was loaned to Paramount to direct &quot;New York Town&quot; (1941) and RKO for &quot;The Tuttles of Tahiti&quot; (1942).

Back at Columbia, Vidor directed the studio&#x27;s first Technicolor movie, &quot;The Desperadoes&quot; (1943). He followed it with the Rita Hayworth–Gene Kelly musical, &quot;Cover Girl&quot; (1944) which was a huge success. On June 11, 1944 Vidor signed a seven-year contract with Columbia.

Vidor did &quot;Together Again&quot; (1944) then made a biopic of Chopin, &quot;A Song to Remember&quot; (1945), which was another big hit, and made a star of Cornel Wilde.

After &quot;Over 21&quot; (1946) with Irene Dunne, Vidor directed another classic film with &quot;Gilda&quot; (1946) starring Hayworth and Glenn Ford.

===Clashes with Harry Cohn===
Vidor was Columbia&#x27;s leading director but he was fighting with head of production Harry Cohn – for instance, Cohn wanted Vidor to direct &quot;Johnny O&#x27;Clock&quot; but Vidor refused.

He started directing &quot;The Guilt of Janet Ames&quot; (1947), but fought with Cohn and was replaced during filming by Henry Levin.

In 1946 Vidor sued Columbia, seeking to be released from his contract and $78,000 in damages. The case went to trial, where Vidor argued that he had been treated badly by Cohn, who swore at him. (Cohn admitted the swearing but said this was his way of expressing himself.) He also said Cohn would not loan him $25,000 to buy a new house and that Cohn made him cry twice by yelling at him. The judge ruled against Vidor, ordering him back to work. Vidor began directing Ford and William Holden in &quot;The Man from Colorado&quot; (1949) but clashed with Cohn once more over the shooting schedule and was fired during filming for being too slow, being replaced by Levin.

The matter settled and Vidor was reunited with Hayworth and Ford for the expensive &quot;The Loves of Carmen&quot; (1948). Columbia exercised their option under Vidor&#x27;s contract.

In 1948 Vidor announced he had purchased rights to &quot;Sirocco&quot;, a French Foreign Legion tale based on the novel &quot;Coup de Grace&quot; he wanted to make with Rita Hayworth and Humphrey Bogart. He was also preparing to do the film version of &quot;Born Yesterday&quot; and did a few days uncredited work on &quot;Under Cover Man&quot;.

In August 1949 Vidor was assigned the musical &quot;The Petty Girl&quot; (1950). He refused to do it, Columbia put him on suspension, and Vidor told Columbia that he considered his contract with them at an end. (He was replaced on &quot;The Petty Girl&quot; by Levin). In September Columbia sued Vidor to stop him walking out on the contract.

In October 1949 Vidor bought himself out of his contract for $75,000 at $15,000 a year for five years. Louis B. Mayer had acted as intermediary &quot;for the good of the industry&quot;. Vidor&#x27;s career had two years to run, at $3,000 a week then $3,500 a week.

===MGM===
In December 1949 Vidor signed a contract with MGM to direct &quot;The Running of the Tide&quot; which was never made.

Vidor was one of several directors on MGM&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Big Country&quot; (1951).

Vidor went to Paramount with a project he had developed himself, &quot;Thunder in the East&quot; (filmed 1951, released 1952), which starred Alan Ladd.

Sam Goldwyn used him on &quot;Hans Christian Andersen&quot; (1952) which was a huge success. After filming Vidor optioned the novel &quot;SPQR&quot; and announced he would film it independently but it was not made.

At MGM Vidor did a musical with Elizabeth Taylor, &quot;Rhapsody&quot; (1954) and a biopic of Ruth Etting, &quot;Love Me or Leave Me&quot; (1955), a big success. Vidor directed Grace Kelly&#x27;s last movie, &quot;The Swan&quot; (1956).

In 1956 he announced he had formed his own company, Aurora, to make &quot;The Life of Nijinsky&quot;.

===Final years===
Vidor went into partnership with Frank Sinatra and Joe E. Lewis to make a biopic of the latter, &quot;The Joker Is Wild&quot; (1957). Sinatra and Vidor were going to reunite on &quot;Kings Go Forth&quot; but then
David O. Selznick hired Vidor to make the troubled &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; (1957), replacing John Huston.

Vidor&#x27;s last film was an attempt to repeat the success of &quot;A Song to Remember&quot;, another biopic of a composer, in this case Liszt: &quot;Song Without End&quot; (1960) (originally titled &quot;A Magic Flame&quot;). He died of a heart attack three weeks into filming.

==Personal life==
He was married four times:
* Frances Varone 1924–1931
* the actress Karen Morley 1932–1943 (separated 1940)
* the actress Evelyn Keyes 1944–1945
* Doris Warner, daughter of Warner Bros. President Harry Warner, 1945–1959 (until his death)
He had three sons – Quentin, Brian and Michael.

==Death==
Charles Vidor died at the age of 58 in Vienna, Austria, from a heart attack, reportedly &quot;in flagrante delicto&quot; with a bit player from the film he was directing at the time. He was in the midst of making &quot;Song Without End&quot;, and was replaced as director by George Cukor. He was entombed at Home of Peace Cemetery in the same mausoleum as Harry Warner.

== Recognition ==
Vidor has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6676 Hollywood Boulevard for his contribution to motion pictures.

<doc id="1298667" wikidata="Q919954" url="?curid=1298667" title="Doug Collins (basketball)">
<text>Paul Douglas Collins (born July 28, 1951) is an American basketball executive, former player, coach and television analyst in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played in the NBA from 1973 to 1981 for the Philadelphia 76ers, earning four NBA All-Star selections. He then became an NBA coach in 1986, and had stints coaching the Chicago Bulls, Detroit Pistons, Washington Wizards and Philadelphia 76ers. Collins also served as an analyst for various NBA-related broadcast shows. He is a recipient of the Curt Gowdy Media Award.
In April 2024, Collins was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame class of 2024 by the Contributors Committee.

==Early life==

Collins was born in Christopher, Illinois. He grew up in Benton, Illinois, where his next-door neighbor was future film star John Malkovich. Collins enjoyed a successful high school basketball career at Benton Consolidated High School under coach Rich Herrin.

== College career ==
Collins went on to play for Illinois State University in Normal, Illinois, coached from 1970 by Will Robinson, the first black head coach in NCAA Division I.

==Professional career==

=== Philadelphia 76ers (1973–1981) ===
Collins was drafted first overall in the 1973 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers. He played eight seasons for Philadelphia, and was an NBA All-Star four times. In the 1976–77 season, he joined Julius Erving leading the Sixers to the NBA Finals, where they lost to the Portland Trail Blazers.

A series of injuries to his feet and left knee beginning in 1979 would end Collins&#x27; career in 1981. In all, he played 415 NBA games, scoring 7,427 points (17.9 per game).

==Coaching career==
After his retirement, Collins turned to coaching. He joined Bob Weinhauer&#x27;s staff at Penn as an assistant coach and later followed Weinhauer to Arizona State for the same job. He resigned from Arizona State on July 7, 1984, to become a CBS television commentator.

=== Chicago Bulls (1986–1989) ===
In May 1986, Collins was named head coach of the Chicago Bulls; the team featured a young Michael Jordan who was entering his third season. Despite having Jordan, the Bulls were coming off a 30–52 season and had fired their past two coaches after one season each.

Collins immediately helped the Bulls turn their fortunes around, showing an improvement of 10 games in each of his first two seasons, coaching Chicago to a 50–32 record in his second year. In his third year as coach, he brought Chicago to their first Eastern Conference finals appearance in 15 years; however, they were unable to get past their Central Division rival, the &quot;Bad Boys&quot; Detroit Pistons. Despite the Bulls&#x27; success and his popularity in Chicago, Collins was fired in the summer of 1989.

=== Detroit Pistons (1995–1998) ===
Collins was named the head coach of the Detroit Pistons in 1995. His results on arrival in Detroit were similar to those in Chicago, as the Pistons had a second-year star who drew comparisons to Michael Jordan, Grant Hill. In his first season, he was able to improve the team&#x27;s previous season&#x27;s record by 18 games and lead them back to the playoffs, though they would be swept by the Orlando Magic.

A fast start in his second season pushed Hill to the top of MVP consideration and Collins was named the Eastern Conference All-Star team&#x27;s coach. The highlight of the year for Collins came on April 13, when the Pistons defeated the defending champion Bulls to end Detroit&#x27;s 19-game losing streak against Chicago. (Incidentally Collins ended a Chicago losing streak against the Pistons in the 80&#x27;s.) The Pistons finished 54–28 and lost in the first round of playoffs to the Atlanta Hawks, 3–2 in the best-of-five series.

Collins served as Pistons&#x27; head coach until February 2, 1998, when he was fired and replaced by Alvin Gentry. Collins then became a television broadcaster, working for many years at various networks, such as NBC on the &quot;NBA on NBC&quot; and TNT on the &quot;NBA on TNT&quot;.

=== Washington Wizards (2001–2003) ===
Collins worked as a broadcaster for about three years before being hired to coach the Washington Wizards for the start of the 2001–02 NBA season. In Washington, Collins was reunited with Michael Jordan and Charles Oakley. Once again, in his first season with his new team, Collins improved the team&#x27;s previous season&#x27;s record by 18 games. Though his .451 winning percentage through two seasons was better than the Wizards&#x27; .308 record the previous two seasons (and subsequent .305 record the following season), Collins was fired at the conclusion of the 2002–03 season.

=== Philadelphia 76ers (2010–2013) ===

On May 21, 2010, Collins was hired as head coach of the Philadelphia 76ers. While the 76ers initially started out poorly with a record of 3–13, the team showed great improvement as the season went on, and clinched the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference for the playoffs. Under Collins, the team increased its win total by 14 games over the previous season. They lost to the eventual Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat in the first round, but were able to avoid a sweep that had been predicted. Collins finished second in Coach of the Year voting that season.

In the lockout-shortened 2011–2012 season, Collins led the Sixers to an improved record, but Philadelphia was only able to take the eighth seed in the playoffs. Against the top seeded Chicago Bulls, Collins led the Sixers to their first playoff series victory since 2003. It was the fifth time in NBA history that an eighth seed defeated a first seed in a playoff series. They took the next series against the Boston Celtics to seven games, but lost.

Collins resigned as 76ers coach on April 18, 2013, citing a need to spend more time with his five grandchildren. It was announced that he would stay with the team as an adviser.

==National team career==
Collins represented the United States at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany. Those basketball games are remembered mainly for the controversial gold medal basketball game between the United States and the Soviet Union, in which Collins played a key part. He made the two go-ahead free throws that should had won the game. But the final three seconds of the game after the free throws were replayed due to a timing error, which let USSR to make the decisive shot. The game-altering event let to the US team boycotting the medal ceremony altogether and mutually decidinf to never accept their medals.

In 2008, he was part of NBC Sports&#x27; TV coverage of basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, which notably saw his son, Chris serve as the court coach and scout for the 2008 &quot;Redeem Team&quot;. When the American team won, he was invited to join the team on the Gold Medal ceremony. He was part of the cast for Netflix&#x27;s &quot;The Redeem Team&quot; in 2022.

==Broadcasting career==
Collins started doing work for CBS in the mid-1980s, calling mostly playoff games. He also was the lead color analyst for the local broadcasts of the 76ers&#x27; games during the 1985–86 season. In-between his various coaching stints he has done broadcasting work for CBS, NBC, TNT, TBS, and ABC/ESPN. He also called games for the New York Knicks during the 2003–04 season on MSG Network on a part-time basis, paired with Marv Albert.

After being fired by the Wizards, Collins returned to announcing games for TNT. In addition, he served as an analyst for NBC Sports&#x27; TV coverage of basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. He also was a basketball analyst for NBC during the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.

During this time, Collins&#x27;s name surfaced several times regarding head coaching vacancies. In 2005, he was a candidate for the Milwaukee Bucks job but was passed over for Terry Stotts. Collins was approached by the team again in 2008 to serve as their GM and coach but turned them down again. In May 2008, Collins was in negotiations to coach the Chicago Bulls, nearly 20 years after he was fired from the team. However, Collins withdrew his name when he and owner Jerry Reinsdorf &quot;agreed it wasn&#x27;t the best to keep going this way,&quot; in light of their close personal friendship.

==Executive career==

=== Chicago Bulls (2017–present) ===
On September 19, 2017, the Chicago Bulls announced that Collins had joined the team as senior advisor of basketball operations.

==Personal life==

Collins and his wife Kathy have two children. They reside in the Delaware Valley. Their son Chris, a former Duke University basketball player, is the head basketball coach at Northwestern University and their daughter Kelly, who played basketball at Lehigh University, is a school teacher in Pennsylvania.

==Awards and honors==

Illinois State University&#x27;s basketball court is named after Collins (Doug Collins Court at Redbird Arena). A statue depicting Collins and his ISU coach, Will Robinson, was unveiled on September 19, 2009, outside the north entrance of Redbird Arena.

Collins was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State&#x27;s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois on June 19, 2021.

<doc id="1298668" wikidata="Q2271197" url="?curid=1298668" title="Echovirus">
<text>Echovirus is a polyphyletic group of viruses associated with enteric disease in humans. The name is derived from &quot;enteric cytopathic human orphan virus&quot;. These viruses were originally not associated with disease, but many have since been identified as disease-causing agents. The term &quot;echovirus&quot; was used in the scientific names of numerous species, but all echoviruses are now recognized as strains of various species, most of which are in the family &quot;Picornaviridae&quot;.

==List of echoviruses==
Thirty-four echoviruses are known:

* Human echoviruses 1–7, 9, 11–21, 24–27, and 29–33 are strains of the species &quot;Enterovirus B&quot; of the genus &quot;Enterovirus&quot;.
* Human echovirus 8 was shown to be identical to Human echovirus 1 and was abolished as a species.
* Human echovirus 10 was reclassified as a strain of the species &quot;Reovirus type 1&quot;, currently named &quot;Mammalian orthoreovirus&quot; of the genus &quot;Orthoreovirus&quot;, which belongs to the family &quot;Reoviridae&quot;. As such, Human echovirus 10 is the only echovirus that does not belong to the family &quot;Picornaviridae&quot;.
* Human echoviruses 22 and 23 are strains of the species &quot;Parechovirus A&quot; of the genus &quot;Parechovirus&quot;.
* Human echovirus 28 was reclassified as the species &quot;Human rhinovirus 1A&quot;, which was later merged with other rhinovirus strains into the currently named species &quot;Rhinovirus A&quot; of the genus &quot;Enterovirus&quot;.
* Human echovirus 34 was abolished as a species and reclassified as a strain of &quot;Human coxsackievirus A24&quot;, which is now classified as a strain of the species &quot;Enterovirus C&quot; of the genus &quot;Enterovirus&quot;.

==Symptoms==
When one is infected with echovirus, symptoms are rare but can occur. When symptoms occur, they often include a cough, rash, and influenza-like symptoms. Rare symptoms include viral meningitis, which affects the brain and spinal cord.

==Treatment==
Echovirus infection mostly clears up on its own. Doctors may give an immune-system treatment called IVIG, which can help those with weak immune systems. No medicines are known to help against the virus.

<text>Timeline is a science fiction novel by American writer Michael Crichton, his twelfth under his own name and twenty-second overall, published in November 1999. It tells the story of a group of history students who travel to 14th-century France to rescue their professor. The book follows in Crichton&#x27;s long history of combining science, technical details, and action in his books, this time addressing quantum and multiverse theory.

The novel spawned Timeline Computer Entertainment, a computer game developer that created the &quot;Timeline&quot; PC game published by Eidos Interactive in 2000. Additionally, a film based on the book was released in 2003.

==Plot==
In northern Arizona near Corazón Canyon, a married couple driving through the desert encounter an elderly man. They take him to a hospital in Gallup, New Mexico. Hospital staff learn that he works for the company ITC. After he dies, an MRI scan reveals inexplicable abnormalities in his blood vessels.

In the Dordogne region of southwest France, Professor Edward Johnston leads a group of archaeologists and historians as they study a site that includes the fourteenth-century towns of Castelgard and La Roque. Suspicious of the detailed knowledge of the site shown by their funds provider ITC, Johnston travels to New Mexico to investigate. During his absence, the researchers discover the lens to Johnston&#x27;s eyeglasses in the ruins, and a written message from him that is determined to be over 600 years old. Four of the researchers—graduate students Chris Hughes and Kate Erickson, assistant professor André Marek, and technology specialist David Stern—are flown to ITC&#x27;s research headquarters in Black Rock, New Mexico.

During the flight, ITC vice president John Gordon informs them that Johnston traveled to the year 1357 using their undisclosed quantum technology. The historians decide to venture into the past to rescue Johnston. Stern chooses to stay behind because the time period is extremely dangerous.

Chris, Kate, Marek and two ITC guards travel to 1357. After arriving, they are attacked by knights chasing a boy. The ITC guards are killed, and one activates a grenade before being fatally wounded and initiates his return, causing the present-day transit pad to be damaged by the explosion. Stern and the ITC employees struggle to repair it so the team can return home.

Kate and Marek find Johnston at a monastery, but he is soon taken captive by the soldiers of Lord Oliver de Vannes, an English knight and resident lord of Castelgard, who thinks that Johnston knows the secret passageway to the otherwise impregnable castle of La Roque, which Oliver controls. Oliver&#x27;s enemy, French commander Arnaut de Cervole, plans to attack Oliver&#x27;s domain, and Oliver wants the secret to defend it.

Separated from the others, Chris follows the boy and inadvertently identifies himself as a nobleman. The &quot;boy&quot; leads Chris to the castle of Castelgard, and is revealed to be Lady Claire d&#x27;Eltham in disguise. She is being pressured to marry Sir Guy de Malegant. Chris and Marek (who has since found Chris) are challenged to a joust by Guy: Chris&#x27;s apparent nobility and him accompanying Lady Claire have turned him into the enemy of Guy. The two survive the challenge thanks to Marek&#x27;s knowledge of medieval combat.

Oliver orders the historians&#x27; imprisonment. They escape Castelgard and are pursued by Sir Robert de Kere, Oliver&#x27;s advisor. Meanwhile, Oliver relocates to La Roque, taking Johnston with him. To rescue Johnston, the historians search for clues to the location of the secret passage to La Roque. After gathering information at the monastery, they find a clue in a water mill, but get captured and interrogated by Arnaut. After escaping Arnaut&#x27;s forces, Chris and Kate find the entrance to the passage at a decrepit chapel while Marek gains entry into La Roque by posing as Johnston&#x27;s assistant. Marek learns that Johnston is helping Oliver build an incendiary weapon to use against Arnaut&#x27;s forces, believing that Oliver will lose the siege anyway as he historically does.

The historians have learned that another person from the present is helping Oliver&#x27;s forces. The person is revealed to be de Kere, who is really Rob Deckard, an ITC employee driven insane from errors in the process of teleporting to another time that built up in his body over multiple trips, much like the elderly man the couple in Arizona found. Deckard plans to prevent the historians&#x27; return to the present and kill them.

Chris and Kate use the passage to enter La Roque. Arnaut begins the siege of La Roque, and enters the castle by apparently using the passage. During the battle, Kate is chased by Guy and sends him falling to his death. Marek and Chris free Johnston from a dungeon. Arnaut swordfights with Oliver, who ends up being trapped in a pit of putrid water. As the historians flee, Chris is attacked by Deckard, but kills him by setting him on fire with Johnston&#x27;s incendiary weapon.

Stern and the ITC employees repair the transit pad just in time for the historians&#x27; return. Marek, who always wanted to live in the Middle Ages, decides to stay behind, while Chris, Kate, and Johnston return to the present.

The historians and Gordon confront ITC president Robert Doniger, who had little concern for the travelers&#x27; safety and intends to exploit the quantum technology for corporate gain. Gordon renders him unconscious and sends him to 1348 Europe, during the Black Death.

Chris and Kate are later implied to become a couple, and Kate becomes pregnant. While examining a site in England, the researchers find the graves of Marek and Lady Claire, whom he married. Despite knowing that Marek had a happy life, they miss him.

== Style ==

=== Point of view ===

The novel is written in the third-person-omniscient point of view.

== Characters ==

=== Andre Marek ===

Andre Marek is a Dutch researcher who works with Professor Johnston in Dordogne. Marek has always had a fascination with medieval times that is so intense that he has taught himself to joust, to fight with a sword, and to shoot a longbow. He also learned to speak and understand medieval languages such as Occitan and Middle English. Therefore, when Marek gets the chance to go to that era, via ITC&#x27;s invention, he jumps at it.

Marek proves himself very brave in the medieval world. He fights multiple soldiers, not hesitating to take their lives; bravely stands up to medieval warlords and Archpriests; and is very convincing in the role of a knight. No one - not even knights who oppose him - have a doubt about his being one, fully entitled to be called &quot;Sir Andre&quot;. Ultimately, Marek realizes that he was meant to live in this period. For this reason, he chooses to remain behind. When Professor Johnston, Kate, and Chris return to their own world, they find Marek&#x27;s grave and discover that he lived a happy life in that alternate universe.

=== Kate Erickson ===

Kate Erickson began her college career as an architecture student but found it boring and switched her major to history. Kate now works the Dordogne site from the perspective of architecture, examining the ruins to see how they were built and to make recommendations for restoration.

Kate is part of Marek&#x27;s team that travels to the 14th century to save Professor Johnston. Kate repeatedly demonstrates her bravery and uses her climbing skills to outwit the soldiers of the period. Kate is also something of a romantic and falls in love with Chris during the adventure.

=== Chris Hughes ===

Chris Hughes is a student of Professor Johnston&#x27;s. Chris’ specialty at the archeological site at Dordogne is the mill; he is trying to determine whether or not the mill was fortified, a feature that was fairly new at the time. When Johnston disappears and Marek asks Chris to be part of the team that rescues him, Chris jumps at the chance.

Chris is something of a weakling who often finds himself getting in difficult situations, usually over women. When he goes to the past, he finds himself lying to a pretty girl to impress her, and his lie causes him to end up having to joust with her potential husband. As time passes, however, Chris proves himself to be much braver than he appears. In fact, he single-handedly kills de Kere, the one man crazy enough to kill Chris&#x27; entire team.

=== Professor Edward Johnston ===

Professor Edward Johnston is a college professor who is in charge of the archeological site at Dordogne, in France. Johnston is an inspiration to and supportive of his students, and they admire him. When Johnston goes missing after traveling to New Mexico to confront ITC&#x27;s CEO, his team rallies to find a way to save him.

Johnston has traveled to the past through a separate universe. He has been found by the local people and for this reason has created a new persona for himself, as a Magister who has come to help the local monastery&#x27;s abbot look for important information in their archives. In this capacity, Johnston quickly becomes something of a local legend. This causes Sir Oliver to request his help in defeating Arnaut. Johnston plays along until the moment comes when he can return home.

=== David Stern ===

David Stern is a physicist who takes a job with the Dordogne River Valley archeological site just to be close to where his girlfriend is attending school. When Doniger calls Marek and asks him to pick his three best people to return to New Mexico, Marek chooses Stern to be part of the team. When the science behind the ability to transmit people to other universes is discussed, Stern probably understands it better than anyone else and, therefore, is also the only one who recognizes that it is dangerous and chooses not to go. However, by not going, Stern becomes a key part of the team by assuring their survival via his innovations to rebuild the water walls that provide buffer for the re-building team. Stern saves their lives.

==Reception==
&quot;Cahners Business Information&quot; says the book will &quot;grab teens&#x27; attention from the very first page&quot;, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; calls &quot;Timeline&quot; &quot;exhilarating entertainment.&quot; The novel has also grasped the attention of scholars of medievalism, since Crichton praises Norman Cantor&#x27;s &quot;Inventing the Middle Ages&quot; (1989) as a central influence on his characterization of academic research on the medieval past. Crichton&#x27;s narrative seems to support Cantor&#x27;s notion that the work of academic medievalists amounts to little more than subjective reinventions of the medieval era.

==Film adaptation==

Paramount Pictures produced a feature film adaptation, with a budget of $80 million, released on November 26, 2003. The adaptation was written by Jeff Maguire and George Nolfi, and directed by Richard Donner, and stars Paul Walker as Chris, Gerard Butler as Marek, Billy Connolly as Professor Johnston, and Frances O&#x27;Connor as Kate. The film was poorly received by critics and audiences.

<text>Kemnath () is a small town in the district of Tirschenreuth, in Bavaria, Germany. It is situated near the Fichtel Mountains, 24 km southeast of Bayreuth. 

==History==
Kemnath was first referenced in historical documents on 6 July 1008 by the Holy Roman Emperor Henry II when he donated &quot;Keminata&quot; to the Diocese of Bamberg. In 2008, Kemnath celebrated its 1000th anniversary with a series of special events throughout the town culminating in a major celebration in August 2008.

==Geography==
The town is in the foothills of the Fichtel Mountains of northeast Bavaria and is approximately 55 km from the Czech border at Mähring. It is located in a valley formed by three streams, the Mühlbach, Flötzbach, and Schirnitzbach. The Steinwald Nature Park abuts the edge of the town as well and stretches from Kemnath to the Czech border.

The town&#x27;s motto is &quot;das Tor zur Oberpfalz,&quot; which translates into English as &quot;The Door to the Upper Palatinate.&quot;

==Economy==
The two largest employers in Kemnath are the Ponnath Meat Processing plant and a Siemens Healthineers production facility.

<doc id="1298699" wikidata="Q6972332" url="?curid=1298699" title="National Do Not Call List">
<text>The National Do Not Call List (DNCL) () is a list administered by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) that enables residents of Canada to decide whether or not to receive telemarketing calls. It was first announced by the Government of Canada on 13 December 2004.

The DNCL has been labelled a &quot;disaster&quot; and over a decade after the law&#x27;s creation, many telemarketers are either unaware or do not follow the rules imposed by the DNCL.

The DNCL continues to receive heavy criticism, the latest being from Senator Percy Downe who referred to it as &quot;totally useless&quot;, due to the costly but totally ineffective enforcement, the large number of exempt groups and the ability for anyone from anywhere in the world to purchase sets of phone numbers for relatively low fees, and then abuse the Do Not Call List as a calling list.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://globaltv.com Global News&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Senator Downe cited multiple examples of constituents, whom he had personally added to the list, receiving a sudden increase in telemarketing calls three months later.

On 20 April 2009, the CRTC announced that telephone and fax numbers on the list would be listed on the DNCL for five years, extended from the three years at the list&#x27;s inception. Numbers are now on the list indefinitely.

==Overview==
Legislation entitled &quot;Bill C-37, An Act to amend the Telecommunications Act&quot;, introduced in the House of Commons, was given first reading on 13 December 2004. It addressed telemarketing calls in Canada and would allow people to sign up to prevent certain telemarketers from contacting them. It received royal assent on 25 November 2005 and came into force on 30 June 2006.

The legislation gives the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) authority to establish a national do not call list, to establish procedures to administer the Act and to levy penalties for violations.

Starting 30 September 2008, residents of Canada were able to register their telephone numbers on the list online, or by telephone, fax or teletype.

==Exemptions==
The Do Not Call List exempts Canadian registered charities, political parties, riding associations, candidates, pollsters and newspapers of general circulation for the purpose of soliciting subscriptions. Telemarketing calls from organizations with whom residents have an existing business relationship are also exempt. Telemarketers may also still call if a resident gave them permission in a written form or verbally. This law also does not extend its protections to non-Canadian phone numbers.

Paragraph 41.7(4) of The Telecommunications Act requires that every exempted telemarketer &quot;shall maintain their own do not call list and shall ensure that no telecommunication is made on their behalf to any person who has requested that they receive no telecommunication...&quot;. Unlike the DNCL Rules, the Act itself makes no provision for a grace period or expiry, so all do not call requests must be honoured immediately and permanently.

In letters dated 27 June 2008, to the Canadian Marketing Association (CMA) and the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA), CRTC Chairman Konrad von Finckenstein personally ruled that do not call requests from third parties, such as iOptOut.ca, are to be considered &quot;...as valid requests and must be honoured.&quot; Due to its overwhelming popularity, iOptOut.ca is currently being upgraded and improved.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://ioptout.ca&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 November 2008, the CRTC declined a request from telecommunications provider Rogers Wireless to permit Canadian wireless customers to block unsolicited SMS text messages through the DNCL.

The privacy benefits the list will achieve remain uncertain. A working group of the CRTC held hearings concerning the planned implementation of the list. It submitted recommendations on 26 July 2006.

On 3 July 2007, the CRTC announced it would be issuing a request for proposals to suppliers willing to provide this service. On 21 December 2007, the CRTC announced that it had picked Bell Canada to operate the National Do Not Call List for five years. It is funded from subscription fees paid by telemarketers, rather than relying on fees by end citizens. It became operational on 30 September 2008.

==Criticism==
Michael Geist, professor of law at the University of Ottawa, has criticized the changes adopted in the amended Act. He observed that the legislation contained too many exemptions which would not result in a significant decrease in calls for subscribers of the DNCL. Geist expressed particular concern about the extent and duration of the existing business relationship exception. In a 2009 article for the &quot;Toronto Star,&quot; Geist labelled the CRTC&#x27;s do-not-call list a &quot;disaster&quot; and recommended that parliament return to the original version of Bill C-37 by eliminating all exemptions. He further recommended cross-border cooperation to resolve jurisdictional issues and immediate tough enforcement to send a strong signal to violators.

In November 2008, it was reported that the CRTC had received thousands of complaints from individuals about the implementation of the Do Not Call List. People reported that they had actually experienced a notable increase in the number of calls since registering for the list, and were starting to get calls at cellular phone numbers that had never received telemarketing calls before.

However, a VoxPop study found that 80% of those registered on the DNCL had noticed a reduction in calls, while 13% had seen an increase. The study concluded that the most likely explanation for the increase was due to timing of the launch of the DNCL with the Great Recession which was affecting American and other foreign companies harder than Canadian, and where unscrupulous telemarketers that did not care about Canadian laws were using random dialers to find new business.

In January 2009, numerous media and consumer advocacy organizations reported that anyone can use false information pretending to be a telemarketer and download a set of numbers from the list for a $50 fee. It took their reporter ten minutes to do so. It has been proposed that list may be being downloaded and used as a telemarketing list overseas, where there&#x27;s little that can be done as the CRTC has no jurisdiction outside of Canada. Konrad von Finckenstein, Chair of the CRTC, responded to these allegations on 16 June 2009, labeling them an urban myth, and stating that the Government had looked into the claims and that there was &quot;no evidence to substantiate them&quot;.

===Technological shortcomings===

A notable shortcoming of the Canadian implementation of the do-not-call list is that the list of numbers is given to telemarketers in plain text, in the form of a simple spreadsheet or CSV file without any protection or traceability. Technologies for securing personal data are readily available, as shown by Australia&#x27;s Do Not Call Register, which &quot;is a secure database where you can list your numbers to avoid receiving unsolicited telemarketing calls and marketing faxes.&quot; In contrast to the CRTC&#x27;s uncontrolled distribution of telephone number lists, the Australian system consists of a &quot;List Washing Service&quot;, precisely as proposed by the minority opinion which was disregarded by the CRTC.

On 3 July 2007, in Telecom Decision CRTC 2007-47,
the CRTC disregarded the non-consensus report from the DNCL Operations Working Group, which had strongly recommended against allowing telemarketers to download unmarked, untraceable copies of the do-not-call list. With the aim of protecting the confidentiality of cell and unlisted numbers, the non-consensus report had instead advocated a Query/Response methodology, wherein telemarketers would be able to query only the do-not-call status of numbers they already had in their possession. Although the CRTC had rejected the Query/Response methodology, citing grounds of operational cost and complexity, a one-number-at-a-time Query/Response turned out to be so operationally simple and inexpensive that it is provided by the CRTC, free of charge, without restriction, to anyone who cares to use it. Other jurisdictions such as the USA provide similar Query/Response functions to checklists of small sets of numbers simultaneously, also free of charge. Jurisdictions such as Australia protect subscriber privacy, precisely as envisioned by the minority report, by keeping the list in the form of a secure database, and providing only a &quot;List Washing Service&quot;.

The CRTC&#x27;s decision to expire registrations is regarded by citizens&#x27; rights groups as a technical shortcoming that adds unnecessary operational cost and complexity to the system, as well as limiting registrants&#x27; freedom to express their wishes. On 17 June 2008, the USA made registrations permanent until the number is disconnected or reassigned, citing &quot;...benefits to the public and to consumer privacy interests...&quot;.

Another possibility to prevent using the plain text list as a list of people to call is to provide honeypot numbers, unique to each telemarketer. If a telemarketer, or anyone he has given the list to, then calls one of the honeypot numbers, stiff penalties can be applied to the telemarketer. If the originating number of a violating call is either foreign or disguised, the CRTC could apply the penalties to the telco which delivered the call to the subscriber&#x27;s line since that telco acted as an agent of the telemarketer by delivering the call.. There is no indication from the CRTC whether honeypots have been implemented as part of the DNCL.

<doc id="1298705" wikidata="Q1192317" url="?curid=1298705" title="Jirga">
<text>A jirga (, &quot;jərga&quot;) is an assembly of leaders that makes decisions by consensus according to Pashtunwali, the Pashtun social code. It is conducted in order to settle disputes among the Pashtuns, but also by members of other ethnic groups who are influenced by them in present-day Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Historically, a &quot;loya jirga&quot; or a &quot;great council&quot; has been convened in order to elect a new head of state, approve a new constitution or resolve critical issues. &quot;Loya jirgas&quot; have reportedly been organized since the rise to power of the Hotak dynasty in the early 18th century. In July 1747, Pashtun chiefs assembled in Kandahar to elect a new king, choosing the 25-year-old Ahmad Shah Durrani, who is credited with founding the modern state of Afghanistan.

From 11 to 14 October 2024, the Pashtun National Jirga was held in Khyber to discuss the critical issues faced by the Pashtuns in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;jirga&quot; is cognate to Middle Mongol noun, (originally meaning rank and order), referring to a large assembly of men forming a very broad circle, initially intended for laying siege around games or animals to be hunted for food or sport. Pashtun elders also typically sit in a circle when debating and hearing a given dispute during a tribal jirga.

In Pashto, a grand jirga is known as &quot;loya jirga&quot; (, &quot;lōya jərga&quot;). A mini-jirga is called &quot;jirgagai&quot; (, &quot;jərgagəy&quot;).

== Origin and historicity ==
The institution, which is centuries old, is a similar idea to the Islamic &quot;shura&quot; (&quot;consultative assembly&quot;).

It is thought that the ancient Indo-Iranian tribes, also known as Arya or Aryans, practiced a sort of jirga system with two types of councils – &#x27; and &#x27;. The &#x27; (summit) comprised elders and tribal chiefs. The king also joined sessions of the &#x27;. was a sort of rural council. In present-day India, they are still referred to as &quot;Samiti&quot; and &quot;Sabha&quot;.

In Afghan society, the jirga is still maintained and favored, mostly by tribal leaders to solve internal or external disputes with other tribes. In some cases it functions like a town hall meeting. When the Afghans took power they tried to legitimize their hold with such a jirga. While in the beginning only Pashtuns were allowed to participate in the &quot;jirgas&quot;, later other ethnic groups like Tajiks and Hazaras were allowed to participate as well. The member of the &quot;jirgas&quot; were mostly members of the royal family, religious leaders and tribal leaders of the Afghans. King Amanullah Khan institutionalized the jirga. From Amanullah until the reign of Mohammed Zahir Shah (1933–1973) and Mohammed Daoud Khan (1973–1978) the jirga was recognized as a common meeting of regional Pashtun leaders. The meetings do not have scheduled occurrences, but rather are called for when issues or disputes arise. There is no time limit for a jirga to conclude, and the meetings often take time because decisions can only be made as a group and arguments can drag out for days. Various issues can be addressed such as major disaster, foreign policy, declaration of war, the legitimacy of leaders, and the introduction of new ideas and laws.

== Functioning methodology ==
The community council meaning is often found in circumstances involving a dispute between two individuals; a jirga may be part of the dispute resolution mechanism in such cases. The disputants would usually begin by finding a mediator, choosing someone such as a senior religious leader, a local notable, or a mediation specialist (a &quot;khan&quot; or &quot;məshər&quot;). In tribal Pashtun society, the maliks serve as &quot;de facto&quot; arbiters in local conflicts, interlocutors in state policy-making, tax-collectors, heads of village and town councils and delegates to provincial and national jirgas as well as delegates to Parliament. The mediator hears from each of the two sides and then he forms a Jirga of community elders, taking care to include the supporters of both sides. The jirga then considers the case and, after it discusses the matter, it comes to a decision about how to handle it, which the mediator then announces. The jirga&#x27;s conclusion is binding.

==Afghanistan==
===1709 &quot;loya jirga&quot;===
A &quot;loya jirga&quot; was gathered by Mirwais Hotak in Shari Safa near Kandahar in 1709.

===1747 &quot;loya jirga&quot;===
A jirga at Kandahar was attended by Afghan representatives who appointed Ahmad Shah Durrani as their new leader.

===1928 &quot;loya jirga&quot;===
In September 1928, a jirga was called by King Amanullah at Paghman near Kabul, the third &quot;loya jirga&quot; of his reign (1919–1929) to discuss reforms, during which King Amanullah asked Queen Soraya to remove her veil in order to gain support for his modernizing policies. However, this was too much for the delegates, some of whom instigated a revolt. Resistance against Amanullah&#x27;s reforms eventually led to the Afghan Civil War (1928–1929).

===2002 &quot;loya jirga&quot;===

In June–July 2002, Hamid Karzai elected to oversee a &quot;loya jirga&quot;. This was only possible because in the fall of 2001, Karzai was able to successfully lead one of the largest tribes in southern Afghanistan in a revolt against the rule of the Taliban. The &quot;loya jirga&quot; was organized by the interim administration of Hamid Karzai, with about 1,600 delegates, some of the delegates were selected during elections which were held in various regions of the country, and other delegates were selected by members of various political, cultural, and religious groups. It was held in a large tent on the grounds of the Kabul Polytechnic on June 11 and it was scheduled to last about a week. It formed a new Transitional Administration that took office shortly thereafter.

More than 1,000 of the participants were elected in a two-stage procedure. Each district elected 20 members, who then elected one person who would represent the entire district in a secret vote. At least one member was allocated to each of the country&#x27;s 362 districts, with an additional seat being allocated for every 22,000 people. No one was barred from the meeting with the exception of people who were accused of engaging in terrorism, people who were suspected of being involved in the illegal drug trade, people who committed human rights abuses, people who committed war crimes, people who committed pillage, and people who committed theft of public property. Additionally, nomads, refugees, intellectuals, representatives of cultural institutions, representatives of social organizations, and religious scholars were all in attendance. Of the remaining seats, a total of 160 seats were allocated to women.

===2003 &quot;loya jirga&quot;===

On 14 December 2003, a 502-delegate &quot;loya jirga&quot; was convened in Kabul to consider the proposed Afghan Constitution. Originally planned to last ten days, the assembly endorsed the charter by January 4, 2004.

===Other historical jirgas===
Some other historical jirgas in the history of Afghanistan are:
* September 1930 – A jirga of 286 called by Mohammed Nadir Shah to confirm his accession to the throne.
* 1941 – Called by Mohammed Zahir Shah to approve neutrality in World War II.
* July 26, 1949 – Afghanistan-Pakistan relations rapidly deteriorated over a dispute, officially declared that it did not recognize the 1893 Durand Line border any longer between the two countries.
* September 1964 – A meeting of 452 called by Mohammed Zahir Shah to approve a new constitution.
* July 1974 – A meeting with Pakistan over the Durand Line.
* January 1977 – Approved the new constitution of Mohammed Daoud Khan establishing one-party rule in the Republic of Afghanistan.
* April 1985 – To ratify the new constitution of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.
* May 1990 – To ratify a new constitution of the Republic of Afghanistan under Mohammad Najibullah, amendments includes providing for multiple political parties.
* September 2001 – Four different &quot;loya jirga&quot; movements anticipating the end of Taliban rule. Little communication took place between each of them.
** The first was based in Rome around Mohammed Zahir Shah, and it reflected the interests of moderate Pashtuns from Afghanistan. The Rome initiative called for fair elections, support for Islam as the foundation of the Afghan state, and respect for human rights.
** The second was based in Cyprus and led by Homayoun Jarir, a member of the Islamic Party of his father-in-law, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. Critics of the Cyprus initiative suspected that it served the interests of Iran. The members of the Cyprus initiative, however, considered themselves closer to the Afghan people and regard the Rome group as too close to the long-isolated nobility.
** The most significant was based in Germany, which resulted in the Bonn Agreement (Afghanistan). This agreement was made under United Nations auspices, established the Afghan Interim Authority and paved the way for the later jirgas that established the Constitution of Afghanistan.
* 2006 – Afghan president Hamid Karzai said that he and the Pakistani president will jointly lead a &quot;loya jirga&quot; to end a dispute over border attacks.
* December 2009 – after his disputed re-election, President Hamid Karzai announced to move ahead with a plan for a &quot;loya jirga&quot; to discuss the Taliban insurgency. The Taliban was invited to take part in this jirga, but they declined.
* June 2010 – at Kabul, in which around 1,600 delegates of all ethnic groups attended for a peace talks with the Taliban.
* 17 November 2013 – at Kabul, in which around 2,500 Afghan elders approved the presence of a limited number of US forces beyond 2014.
* April 29 – May 3, 2019 – at the Bagh-e Bala Palace in Kabul, held to agree a common approach to peace talks with the Taliban, amid negotiations between the Taliban and the United States. The jirga was chaired by Abdul Rasul Sayyaf and over 3,200 delegates attended. The Taliban refused to attend.
* 7–9 August 2020 – held to decide the fate of 400 Taliban prisoners accused of serious crimes, who were supposed to be freed as part of the Afghan peace process.

==Pakistan==
===1947 Bannu jirga===

On June 21, 1947, in Bannu, a &quot;loya jirga&quot; was held consisting of Bacha Khan, his brother Chief Minister Dr Khan Sahib, the Khudai Khidmatgars, members of the Provincial Assembly, Mirzali Khan (Faqir of Ipi), and other tribal chiefs, just seven weeks before the Partition of India. The &quot;loya jirga&quot; declared the Bannu Resolution, which demanded that the Pashtuns be given a choice to have an independent state of Pashtunistan composing all Pashtun territories of British India, instead of being made to join either India or Pakistan. However, the British Raj refused to comply with the demand of this resolution, in response to which the Khudai Khidmatgars boycotted the 1947 North-West Frontier Province referendum for merging the province into Pakistan.

===2006 &quot;loya jirga&quot; for Balochistan===
In April 2006, former Balochistan Chief Minister Taj Muhammad Jamali offered to arrange a meeting between President Pervez Musharraf and a &quot;loya jirga&quot; for peace in Balochistan. A &quot;loya jirga&quot; was held at Kalat in September 2006 to announce that a case would be filed in the International Court of Justice regarding the sovereignty and rights of the Baloch people.

=== Quasi-legal function ===
The jirga was also used as a court in cases of criminal conduct, but this usage is being replaced by formal courts in some settled areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan, elsewhere it is still used as courts in tribal regions.

The jirga holds the prestige of a court in the tribal areas of Pakistan. Although a political agent appointed by the national government maintains law and order through the Frontier Crimes Regulation (FCR), the actual power lies in the jirga. The political agent maintains law and order in his tribal region with the help of jirgas. The jirga can award capital punishment, such as stoning to death in case of adultery, or expulsion from the community.

In the recent military operations against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Pakistan&#x27;s restive southern tribal agencies bordering Afghanistan, jirgas played a key role of moderator between the government and the militants. The tradition of jirga has also been adopted by Muslims in the Kashmir valley of Indian-administered Kashmir.

=== Alternative Dispute Resolution Act 2017 ===
As per 2017 political dispensation in Government, unofficial Jirga and Panchayats are very popular among masses, so formal recognition of the same will help make the system more transparent and responsible, while left leaning political dispensations in opposition expressed their apprehension that weaker sections will suffer while feudalism will benefit. The Alternative Dispute Resolution Act, 2017 of Pakistan makes provision for selection of neutral observing arbitrator from Government approved panel agreed by parties. If a dispute is resolved amicably the court will formalize judgement, and if not parties can choose to opt-in further formal judicial administration for their grievances. &quot;Basit Mahmood criticizes&quot; the bill&#x27;s provisions allowing the government to appoint &quot;neutrals&quot; to each jirga not being sufficient since the so-called &quot;neutrals&quot;, who must approve their verdicts would most likely be consisting of retired judges and religious scholars of conservative nature and that will put principle of neutrality upside down and with a substantially effect on the lives of women across the Pakistan. &quot;Basit Mahmood also criticizes United Kingdom&#x27;s donor agency Department for International Development for funding of misogyny protecting ADR tribunals.&quot;

=== Contested justice and human rights violations ===
In a January 2019 on petition from National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW) judgement Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled that, beyond permissible limits of the law to the extent of acting as arbitration, mediation, negotiation or reconciliation forums between parties involved in a civil dispute who willingly consent to the same; rest of practices and attempts by Jirgas to adjudicate on civil or criminal matters is not lawful, and that unlawful practices of Jirgas are violate Articles 4, 8, 10-A, 25 and 175(3) of the Constitution of Pakistan, and also that &quot;operation of jirgas/ panchayats, etc violates Pakistan&#x27;s international commitments under the UDHR, ICCPR and CEDAW, which place a responsibility on the state of Pakistan to ensure that everyone has access to courts or tribunals, (and all people) are treated equally before the law and in all stages of procedure in courts and tribunals&quot;.

According to correspondent I.A. Rehman, In January 2019 Pakistani government law officials from provinces and federal confirmed governments-made commitments to Supreme Court of Pakistan to not to allow Panchayat and Jirga platforms for illegal practices of violating fundamental constitutional rights of women by honour killings, wani, swara, karo kari, and that the governments are committed to CEDAW

=== Instances of jirga judicial overreach ===
In January 2018, Basit Mahmood criticized 2017 Pakistan act for Alternative Dispute Resolution saying that it creates scope for a parallel justice system which eventually can undermine states&#x27; authority. As per Dilawar Wazir&#x27;s June 2020 news report in Pakistani news daily &quot;Dawn&quot; and subsequent editorial, district administration in Pakistan&#x27;s tribal area was struggling to see one Ahmadzai Wazir tribe avoids to implement its jirga ruling of raising a parallel armed force (&quot;lashkar&quot;) of around 2,400 people to demolish houses of left-leaning political opponents. To make the tribal jirga to submit to a financial compromise, the district administration had to call in elite security force, and make victim submit to demand of 1 million rupees plus four rams as reparation from victim and his clan.

As per a June 2020 &quot;Tribune Pakistan&quot; report, a jirga (a type of quasi kangaroo court) attempted ruling to give up a 13-year-old minor girl in marriage to a 41-year-old married man as Swara (punishment) for her brother&#x27;s alleged disliked relation with his cousin, the Jirga&#x27;s attempt was foiled by a close relative of the boy with help of police.

In another 2020 June incident in Sindh Pakistan, police struggled to clamp down on a jirga which declared two sisters to be ignoble &#x27;Karis&#x27; fined father of the girls for one million rupees plus ordered killing of the sisters (an outlawed but prevalent practice of declaring &#x27;Kari&#x27;s-literal black spot on honour of the family or community – subjectable to severe punishments including honour killing many times for alleged compromising on expectations of modesty and chastity out of suspicions).

=== Historic jirgas and women ===
The Sindh High Court imposed a ban on the holding of jirgas in April 2004 because of the sometimes inhumane sentences which were imposed on people, especially on women and men who married of their own free will. The ban, however, has been ignored.

An all-female jirga or a Khwaindo jirga (a &quot;sister&#x27;s council&quot;) was held in Pakistan, and it had a total of 25 members. It was headed by Tabassum Adnan which helped 11 women get justice as of 2013.

===2022 Pashtun National Jirga===

On 11–14 March 2022, the Pashtun National Jirga, or Bannu Jirga, was held at Mirakhel in Bannu, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in order to defend the rights of the Pashtuns in the country. The critical issues which were faced by the Pashtuns were discussed during the jirga in a bid to suggest solutions to them. The Bannu Jirga endorsed the declarations of two earlier Pashtun Jirgas, one of which was organized on 10 March 2020 at Bacha Khan Markaz, Peshawar by Asfandyar Wali Khan of the Awami National Party (ANP), while the other was hosted on 7 August 2021 in Hashtnagar, Charsadda by Afzal Khamosh of the Mazdoor Kisan Party (MKP).

Mahmood Khan Achakzai, Nawab Ayaz Jogezai, Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal, Abdul Qahar Wadan, Obaidullah Babat, Nasrullah Zayrai and Arfa Siddiq of the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PMAP), Manzoor Pashteen, Mir Kalam and Wranga Loni of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), Mohsin Dawar, Latif Afridi, Afrasiab Khattak, Bushra Gohar and Jamila Gilani of the National Democratic Movement (NDM), Khadim Hussain and Maulana Khanzeb of the Awami National Party (ANP), Afzal Khamosh of the Mazdoor Kisan Party (MKP), Farhatullah Babar and Ahmad Kundi of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Sardar Yaqoob Nasar of the Pakistan Muslim League (PMLN), Muhammad Khan Sherani of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), Chief of Waziristan Gul Alam Wazir, historian Parvesh Shaheen, and numerous other Pashtun, Baloch and Hazara leaders were part of the Bannu Jirga. The resolutions were also endorsed by several Afghan political leaders, including Hamid Karzai, Haneef Atmar and Amrullah Saleh.

====Demands====

Some of the most important demands of the Pashtun National Jirga, 11–14 March 2022, were:
*This jirga should be an independent entity, and a committee of cooperation should be established to implement its decisions and objectives
*A public inquiry should be set up to investigate the deaths of Usman Kakar, Arif Wazir, Arman Loni, and all the Pashtuns murdered extrajudicially in fake encounters by the police forces in Pakistan
*Ali Wazir, Hanif Pashteen, Owais Abdal, Qazi Tahir and other political prisoners should all be released
*All missing persons should be presented before courts, and internally displaced persons (IDPs) be resettled in their area and homes and be fully compensated for their losses
*A truth and reconciliation commission should be set up to look into the extent of damages done to the Pashtuns in Pakistan
*If the Pakistani courts refuse to attend these inquiries, a mechanism should be set up to investigate these damages through international courts
*The draconian laws under the Action (in Aid of Civil Power) Regulation must be immediately abolished in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, all the safety, security and administrative powers be entrusted to the civil administration, and intelligence agencies must stop interfering in politics
*The Pashtun region is rich in natural resources including water and natural gas, but the Pashtuns are kept deprived in Pakistan; control over these resources needs to be regained
*The diversion of the Indus River from its natural course by the Ghazi-Barotha canal was a transgression against international principles and the fundamental right to life of the people along the banks; the Indus should be rerouted to its original watercourse, and the Indus Water Apportionment Accord of 1991 should be revised to grant the Pashtun region a status of owner and stakeholder
*The jirga called for an immediate end to the occupation of the forests, mountains, lands and natural resources of the Pashtun region by the Pakistani military and government agencies
*A united Pashtun province consisting of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, South Pashtunkhwa (in Balochistan), Attock and Mianwali should be established
*Pashto should be proclaimed the Pashtun region&#x27;s national, official and educational language, while speakers of the region&#x27;s other languages should also have access to education in their native tongues
*The jirga rejected the fake results of the 2017 Census of Pakistan and said that an independent, transparent and inclusive mechanism should be made for a new census under international principles
*A &quot;loya jirga&quot; should be organized in Afghanistan to form an inclusive government through a general election, and a mechanism should be put in place so that Afghan governments and their powers are not forcefully seized in the future
*The jirga vehemently rejected the Pakistani-built barbed barrier along the Durand Line, and demanded that all historical trade routes along the line be ensured for trade and free movement of people without any paperwork

<text>Fritz Feld (October 15, 1900 – November 18, 1993) was a German-American film character actor who appeared in over 140 films in 72 years, both silent and sound. His trademark was to slap his mouth with the palm of his hand to create a &quot;pop&quot; sound.

==Early life and career==

Born to a Jewish family in Berlin, Germany, Feld began his acting career in Germany in 1917, making his screen debut in &quot;Der Golem und die Tänzerin&quot; (&quot;The Golem and the Dancing Girl&quot;). His early career in the United States included touring with Morris Gest&#x27;s production of &quot;The Miracle&quot; in the mid-1920s. Feld filmed the sound sequences of the Cecil B. DeMille film &quot;The Godless Girl&quot; (1929), released by Pathé, without DeMille&#x27;s supervision, since DeMille had already broken his contract with Pathé, and signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

He developed a characterization that came to define him. His trademark was to slap his mouth with the palm of his hand to create a &quot;pop!&quot; sound that indicated both his superiority and his annoyance. The first use of the &quot;pop&quot; sound was in &quot;If You Knew Susie&quot; (1948).

Feld often played the part of a maître d&#x27;hôtel, but also a variety of aristocrats and eccentrics. In the 1938 screwball comedy &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;, he played the role of Dr. Lehman. In 1939, he appeared with the Marx Brothers in &quot;At The Circus&quot; in the small role of French orchestra conductor Jardinet. He appeared in nine films with Jerry Lewis between 1954 and 1970, in addition to working with Lewis and Dean Martin on their television program, &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;.

In his later years, Feld appeared in several Walt Disney films and also played an uncharacteristically dramatic role in &quot;Barfly&quot;. He also portrayed one of the Harmonia Gardens waiters in the movie &quot;Hello Dolly!&quot; (1969). In addition to films, he acted in numerous television series in guest roles, including the recurring role of Zumdish, the manager of the intergalactic Celestial Department Store on &quot;Lost In Space&quot;, in two season-two episodes, &quot;The Android Machine&quot; and &quot;The Toymaker&quot;. Zumdish returned in the season-three episode &quot;Two Weeks In Space&quot;. In one 1967 episode of &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, &quot;The Napoleon&#x27;s Tomb Affair&quot;, Feld played a banker, a beatnik, a diplomat, and a waiter.

Feld made his final film appearance in 1989.

==Personal life==

Feld was married to Virginia Christine who was 20 years his junior and famous for her role as &quot;Mrs. Olson&quot; in television commercials for Folgers coffee, from 1940 until his death in 1993 in a convalescent home in Los Angeles, California; Christine died in 1996. The couple is interred at the Jewish Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in the Hollywood Hills section of Los Angeles. The couple had a child, Steven Anatol Feld, born in 1945 (#176621 in the Fales/Feilchenfeld/Field genealogy).

Feld bears number 17662 in the genealogy of the descendants of Wolf Fales Felichenfeld (born 1745). Rudi bears number 17661. They were the sons of Heinrich Feilchenfeld (born May 1, 1867 in Berlin) who bears number 1766. &lt;ref Descendants of Wolf Fales ed. Arthur Field #1774311&gt;

Fritz Feld was a strong enough amateur chess player that 1948 U.S. champion Herman Steiner and international master George Koltanowski would come to his home some evenings in the 1940s, with the three of them playing chess until 6:00 the following morning, as mentioned in &quot;The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories&quot; (Denker &amp; Parr, 1995).

<text>NWS is an Australian television station based in Adelaide, Australia. It is owned-and-operated by the Nine Network. The station callsign, &quot;NWS&quot;, is an initialism of The NeWs South Australia.

==History==

===Origins===

NWS-9 was the first television broadcaster in Adelaide, beginning on 5 September 1959 from their Tynte Street studios. It was owned by Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Limited (a subsidiary of his holding company News Corporation) through &quot;Southern Television Corporation Ltd&quot; who also owned city newspaper &quot;The News&quot;. Popular programs produced in its early days included the live variety shows &quot;Adelaide Tonight&quot; and &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot; (on-location specials), science show &quot;The Curiosity Show&quot;, &quot;The Country and Western Hour&quot;, and children&#x27;s shows &quot;Channel Niners&quot;, &quot;C&#x27;mon Kids&quot;, &quot;Here&#x27;s Humphrey&quot; and &quot;Pick Your Face&quot;. NWS also broadcast SANFL game matches from 1989 to 1992, earlier it had produced the first ever colour broadcast of that league&#x27;s Grand Final in 1973.

In early 1980, NBN Limited became NWS&#x27;s owner for A$19 million. In 1981, Hadjoin Pty. Ltd., a subsidiary of Kevin Parry&#x27;s Esplanade Limited (later Parry Corporation), purchased 19.88% of NBN Limited for $6.7 million.

Following this, Parry then attempted to buy the Wansey family&#x27;s stake in NBN, but was blocked by the Supreme Court of New South Wales, after which Parry revealed that he wanted to take over NBN (and thus NWS). Parry and the Lamb family then formed a deal – NBN would transfer NWS to the Lambs in exchange for their share of NBN which went to the Parrys. This ended NBN Limited&#x27;s ownership of NWS.

===Recent history===
The Lamb family sold NWS to Southern Cross Broadcasting for $96 million in 1999, leading to redundancies among almost half of the station&#x27;s staff.

On 30 May 2007, Southern Cross announced its sale of NWS-9 to WIN Corporation for $105 million. WIN took control on 1 July 2007.

It was reported on 3 June 2013 that Nine Entertainment Co. would immediately purchase Nine Adelaide (NWS) from WIN Corporation as part of a deal to secure international cricket television rights. Nine officially gained control of NWS on 1 July 2013. This move saw Nine Adelaide join Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne as Nine Network owned-and-operated metropolitan stations leaving only Perth which was purchased only months later in September.

Managing Director of Nine Adelaide, Sean O&#x27;Brien, announced in late 2014 that within two years, the station would move from their Tynte Street location of over fifty years to new studios in the CBD.

The final broadcast from the Tynte Street studios was on 18 September 2015, followed a day later by the first transmission from the new street-level studios on Pirie Street.

==News==
&quot;9News Adelaide&quot; is presented from the studios of NWS Adelaide by Kate Collins and Brenton Ragless on weeknights with Will McDonald presenting on weekends. Sport is presented mostly in the studio by Tom Rehn on weekdays and by Corey Norris on weekends, with the weather presented by Jessica Braithwaite on weeknights and Chelsea Carey on the weekend.

===News history===
John Doherty was the station&#x27;s first news presenter.

Between 1988 and 2007, the weeknight bulletin was presented by Rob Kelvin and the late Kevin Crease. They were one of the longest serving news duos in Australia.

Throughout the 1990s, Deanna Williams was the main fill-in presenter and state political reporter. Following her resignation in March 2002, either Kelvin or Crease would fill in for McGuinness on weekends, but in 2005 the situation arose where all three presenters were unavailable – leaving weekend sports presenter Mark Bickley to read the news.

Also during this time, the weekend bulletins consistently rated higher than its rival &quot;Seven News Adelaide&quot; in its timeslot, however, the weeknight bulletins continue to languish in second position behind Seven.

In late 2008, NWS-9 launched its own local version of the Nine Network&#x27;s flagship current affairs program, &quot;A Current Affair&quot;, hosted by Adelaide journalist Kate Collins. It was axed only one year later.

On 26 November 2009, one day after the axing of the local A Current Affair was announced, Kelly Nestor announced live on air that her contract as Kelvin&#x27;s weeknight co-anchor would not be renewed and she would finish on 18 December 2009.

On 22 February 2010, it was announced that senior reporter Michael Smyth would be joining Rob Kelvin at the newsdesk.

On 31 October 2010, Rob Kelvin announced that he would retire from the newsdesk after 32 years on the air. He would present his last bulletin on 31 December 2010 after 27 years anchoring the news. However, News Director, Tony Agars announced that Kelvin would continue to present the occasional special report and fill-in a few times a year when required. Kate Collins replaced Kelvin, joining Smyth at the news desk.

In October 2011, it was announced that Michael Smyth and Georgina McGuinness would not have their contracts renewed. From the end of November 2011 until December 2013, Kate Collins presented the bulletin solo on weeknights and Will McDonald replaced McGuinness as presenter for weekend bulletins at the end of December 2011.

Despite the national dominance of Nine News for many years, the Adelaide bulletin has failed to match the same ratings success seen in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, and remains the lowest-rating news program in its market, formerly trailing rival Seven News Adelaide by around 100,000 viewers. This is reflected in the frequent position changes that have taken place at NWS over the years since it last won the local ratings in 2007.

<text>John Greaves (1602 – 8 October 1652) was an English mathematician, astronomer and antiquarian.

Educated at Balliol College, Oxford, he was elected a Fellow of Merton College in 1624. He studied Persian and Arabic, acquired a number of old books and manuscripts for archbishop William Laud (some still in Merton College Library), and wrote a treatise (in Latin) on the Persian language. He travelled in Italy and the Levant from 1636 to 1640 and made a survey of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

He was Gresham Professor of Geometry at Gresham College, London, and Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford University, and collected astrolabes and astronomical measuring devices (now in the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford). He was particularly interested in the study of weights and measures, and wrote a treatise on the Roman foot and denarius, and was a keen numismatist. In 1645 he attempted a reform of the Julian calendar, which was not adopted.

During the English Civil War he supported Charles I, who stayed at Merton College while in Oxford, but lost his academic positions at Oxford in 1647 through the animosity of Nathaniel Brent, Warden of Merton College and a Parliamentarian.

==Biography==
===Early life===
He was born in Colemore, near Alresford, Hampshire. He was the eldest son of John Greaves, rector of Colemore, and Sarah Greaves. His brothers were Nicholas Greaves, Thomas Greaves and Sir Edward Greaves, physician to Charles II.
His father ran a school for sons of the neighbouring gentry, where Greaves began his education. Aged 15, he went to Balliol College, Oxford between 1617–1621, gaining a B.A. degree. In 1624 he was the first of five newly elected Fellows of Merton College, becoming M.A. in 1628. He began to study astronomy and oriental languages, and especially the works of the ancient eastern astronomers. In 1630 Greaves was chosen Gresham Professor of Geometry at Gresham College, London. Through his predecessor, Peter Turner, he later met archbishop William Laud, the chancellor of Oxford University and Visitor (patron) of Merton College. Laud was keen to make English editions of Greek and Arabic authors, and Greaves&#x27; later travels abroad involved collecting manuscripts and books for presentation to his new patron.

===Travels in Italy===
Greaves enrolled at University of Leyden in 1633, where he became friends with Jacob Golius, professor of Arabic at Leyden. He enrolled at the University of Padua in 1635 along with George Ent, meeting the Dane Johan Rode (John Rhodius), an expert on ancient weights and measures, who also made a commentary on Celsus. A brief return to England was followed by a second European journey; in 1636 he sailed via Livorno (Leghorn) to Rome, dining with Ent on 5 October at the English College, Rome; he also met William Harvey, who was entertained at the college on the 12th, Gasparo Berti, Lucas Holstenius and Athanasius Kircher.

Probably in the same month he met and consulted with the Earl of Arundel&#x27;s art-collecting agent, William Petty (who dined at the college on 14 October), on the Earl&#x27;s attempted acquisition of the Obelisk of Domitian, then still lying broken in the Circus of Maxentius. Though &quot;now it is broken into 5 stones&quot;, he measured these and including a sketch of the obelisk as hypothetically repaired in his almanac-notebook (Bodleian Library Savile MS 49,1). Though Arundel paid a 60 crown deposit for the obelisk, pope Urban VIII vetoed its export and it was erected by his successor Innocent X above Bernini&#x27;s &quot;Fountain of the Four Rivers&quot; in the Piazza Navona.

Greaves toured the Catacombs and made drawings of the Pantheon and Pyramid of Cestius. During his stay in Rome he instituted inquiries into the ancient weights and measures that are among the early classics of metrology.

===Travels in the Levant===

In 1637 he made a journey to the Levant, one intention being to fix the latitude of Alexandria where Ptolemy had made his astronomical observations. He sailed from England to Livorno in the company of Edward Pococke; after a brief visit to Rome, he arrived in Istanbul (Constantinople) around April 1638. There he made the acquaintance of the English ambassador Sir Peter Wyche. He procured various manuscripts there, including a copy of Ptolemy&#x27;s Almagest (&quot;the fairest work I ever saw&quot;). Greaves ended up owning two copies of the Almagest. He was going to have visited the many monastic libraries at Mount Athos, in order to make a catalogue of their MSS and unprinted books. Athos was normally open only to members of the Orthodox church, but thanks to a special dispensation from the Patriarch of Constantinople Cyril Lucaris, Greaves would have had access; but the execution of the patriarch by strangulation in June 1638 for treason against Sultan Murad IV prevented his journey.

Instead, Greaves continued on to Alexandria, where he collected a number of Arabic, Persian and Greek manuscripts. He was an inveterate note-taker, making countless observations in notebooks and on blank pages of other books he bought; he also visited Cairo twice, and made a more accurate survey of the pyramids of Egypt than any traveller who had preceded him. He returned to England in 1640.

===Calendar reform===
On the death of John Bainbridge in 1643, Greaves was appointed as Savilian professor of astronomy and senior reader of the Linacre lecture at Oxford, but he was deprived of his Gresham professorship for having neglected its duties. In 1645 he essayed a reformation of the Julian calendar; but although his plan of omitting the bissextile day (29 February) for the next 40 years was approved by the king, the matter was dropped owing to the turbulent times. The Gregorian calendar was not adopted in Britain until 1752.

===Ejection from Oxford===
In 1642 Greaves had been elected subwarden of Merton College. Merton was the only Oxford college to side with the Parliamentarians in the English Civil War, through an earlier dispute in 1638 between Nathaniel Brent, the Warden of Merton, and Greaves&#x27; patron William Laud. Brent had been a witness for the prosecution at Laud&#x27;s 1644 trial. After Laud was executed on 10 January 1645, Greaves drew up a petition for Brent&#x27;s removal from office; Brent was deposed by Charles I on 27 January.

However, in 1647 a Parliamentary commission (or visitation) was set up &quot;for the correction of offences, abuses, and disorders&quot; in the University of Oxford. Nathaniel Brent was the president of the visitors. After Thomas Fairfax had captured Oxford for the Parliamentarians in 1648 and Brent had returned from London, Greaves was accused of sequestrating the college&#x27;s plate and funds for king Charles. Despite a deposition from his brother Thomas, Greaves had lost both his Merton fellowship and his Savilian chair by 9 November 1648. Many of his books and MSS disappeared after his rooms were rifled by soldiers, although his friend John Selden managed to recover some of them. However, Greaves was not actually deprived of the professorship until August 1649.

He was succeeded as Savilian Professor of Astronomy in that year by Seth Ward, who ensured that Greaves was paid the arrears (£500) of his salary; Greaves was unlikely to have got his money, since the Savilian professors were paid from the income of lands held in Kent and Essex, which were under control of Parliament (rather than the king). Ward also gave over a considerable amount of his own salary to Greaves.

===Later life and death===
But Greaves&#x27; private fortune more than sufficed for all his wants until his death; he retired to London, married and occupied his leisure writing and editing books and manuscripts. He died in London aged 50, and was buried in the church of St Benet Sherehog, which was destroyed during the Great Fire of London.

His brother Nicholas Greaves was his executor. He left his cabinet containing his coin collection to Sir John Marsham, and his astronomical instruments to the university, for the use of the Savilian professors. Two of his astrolabes (inscribed by his brother Nicholas) are in the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford. (see External links)

==Greaves&#x27; astronomical instruments==

Greaves had entrusted his will to his friend and fellow-traveller in the Levant, the scholar of Arabic Edward Pococke. The will had originally stipulated that Greaves&#x27; collection of astronomical instruments (astrolabes, quadrants, telescopes etc.) was to be left to Oxford university. But by 1649 Greaves (who was staying at Sir John Marsham&#x27;s house in Rochester, Kent) had become increasingly exasperated with the academic situation at Oxford since the civil war. He wrote to Pococke asking to him to send the will to blot out his gift of his instruments to the university (which had cost him more than a hundred pounds), because he &quot;so far despaired of any future encouragement to learning and ingenuity in Oxford.&quot; Greaves repeated his request a few months later, asking Pococke to open the will and strike the words out himself. Pococke seems to have eventually complied with Greaves&#x27; wishes, since after Greaves&#x27; death in 1652 his executor and brother Nicholas Greaves kept hold of his late brother&#x27;s collection.

However, when the Commonwealth ended with the resignation of Richard Cromwell in 1659, Nicholas Greaves (in accordance with his late brother&#x27;s original intent) presented the instruments - suitably inscribed - for the use of the Savilian Professors of Astronomy. They were kept in the professor&#x27;s room at the top of the Eastern Tower of the Oxford Schools, now the Bodleian Library. A list of them appears in the 1697 Catalogue&#x27; of Bodleian manuscripts In 1710 the collection was held in the Museum Savilianum.

The instruments had disappeared by the 1920s when R. T. Gunther, the first curator of the Oxford Museum of the History of Science, made inquiries into their whereabouts. Gunther listed them in his &quot;Early Science in Oxford, Vol. 2: Astronomy&quot; as &quot;not extant&quot;. But in 1936 during the refurbishment of the University Radcliffe Observatory, he was alerted by the Savilian professor of Astronomy, H. H. Plaskett, to a chance discovery of &quot;certain old metal bars and plates behind some cases.&quot; These turned out to be part of the missing Savilian collection, including a mural quadrant, and an astrolabe of Queen Elizabeth I which Greaves took on his 1637-40 expedition to the Middle East. Gunther wrote two articles in &quot;The Observatory&quot; on his findings, one shorter preliminary report with a fuller appreciation a few months later.

The inscriptions on four of the instruments (including Elizabeth I&#x27;s astrolabe) read:

:1659 Acad. Oxon. in usum praecipue Prof. Savilianorum:
:Ex dono Nic Greaves S.T.D.
:In memoriam Tho. Bainbridge M.D. Jo Greaves A.M.  N. fra: olim Astronomiae Prof. Savil.

Greaves&#x27; other, smaller astrolabe didn&#x27;t surface until 1971, when it was discovered by Gunther&#x27;s son A. E. Gunther at his mother&#x27;s house. The cataloguer of the OMHS attributes this to an oversight on Gunther&#x27;s part. The inscription around the edge of the limb reads: &#x27;1659 . Acad. Oxon. Ex dono Nic Greaves. S.T.D.&#x27; It doesn&#x27;t appear in Gunther&#x27;s 1932 magnum opus, &quot;Astrolabes of the World&quot;.

==Works==

Besides his papers in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; of the Royal Society, the principal works of Greaves are:

* &quot;Pyramidographia, or a Description of the Pyramids in Ægypt&quot; (1646)

<text>Randolph Neumann (born July 21, 1948), raised in Cliffside Park, New Jersey, is a former professional boxer who has been a referee for the New York State Athletic Commission since 1982. He has been the &quot;third man&quot; in many championship matches that have taken place in Madison Square Garden in New York City .

==Boxer==
As a boxer, he compiled a professional record of 31 wins (11 by way of knockout) and 7 losses in 38 contests. In his career, he faced the likes of Jimmy Young, Chuck Wepner, and Jerry Quarry. He was ranked as high as the #9 contender worldwide at the Heavyweight division. However, after graduating from Fairleigh Dickinson University in Teaneck, New Jersey with a degree in business in 1975, he decided to retire from boxing. He once won the New Jersey State Heavyweight title by beating Chuck Wepner. The pair fought for that title three times, with Wepner winning twice.

Though he came back for one more bout as a Cruiserweight against Ibar Arrington on April 15, 1977, he retired from prizefighting for good to focus on acting, writing, and a business career.

==Retirement==
Neumann was elected to the board of directors by the members of the International Boxing Federation at their annual convention, held in Montreal in May 2015. While there, he attended his first board meeting at which time he was elected Treasurer of the organization. Although he no longer referees fights (which he did for 31 years), he now supervises championship fights around the world. From 1983 to 2014, he refereed 339 fights, including many world title ones.

Today he is the president of Randy Neumann Wealth Management, located in Upper Saddle River, New Jersey.

==Referee==
In 1982, he telephoned John Condon (president of Madison Square Garden Boxing) and expressed interest in being a referee. After Condon put in a good word with the New York State Athletic Commission, they started using him as a ringside judge. Before long, he had his first assignment as a referee in a four-round bout at the Felt Forum (a part of Madison Square Garden).

Neumann is now a widely respected figure within the boxing community and has worked in the ring for 50+ title fights involving champions including Mike Tyson, Wladimir Klitschko, Meldrick Taylor, Buddy McGirt, Chris Byrd, Evander Holyfield, John Ruiz, and many others.

==Writer==
Neumann wrote an article about a fight that he had against Chuck Wepner in Madison Square Garden that was published in the July 1974 issue of Sport magazine. He wrote 13 columns about boxing for the sports section of the New York Times. He wrote stories of boxing The New York Post, The New York News Magazine, Forbes, Signature, Harper&#x27;s, New Jersey Monthly and other magazines. In 1988 he began writing a financial column for the Hudson Dispatch. Over the years he has syndicated the column in several newspapers. 
He wrote another book titled &quot;Fighting for your Financial Future - Round Two&quot;.

<text>Kenneth George Hall (22 February 1901 – 8 February 1994) was an Australian film producer and director, considered one of the most important figures in the history of the Australian film industry. He was the first Australian to win an Academy Award.

==Early years==
Kenneth George Hall was born in Paddington, a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, in 1901, the third child of Charles and Florence Hall. He was educated at North Sydney Boys&#x27; High School.

At age 15, with the help of his father, he gained a cadetship at the Sydney &quot;Evening News&quot;, where he became friends with a young Kenneth Slessor, then a cadet for another paper. Two years later, he became a publicist for Union Theatres, initially working as an assistant to Gayne Dexter. He had a six-month stint as manager for the Lyceum Theatre then returned to publicity, working his way up to national publicity director, &quot;the highest post in film publicity in Australia&quot; at that time.

In 1924, Hall joined the American distribution company First National Pictures as a publicist, and visited Hollywood the following year.

==Directing career==

===Early years: 1928–1930===

Hall began making films in 1928 when at First National he was assigned to recut and shoot additional sequences for a German movie about the Battle of Cocos, &quot;Our Emden&quot;. The resulting film, &quot;The Exploits of the Emden&quot;, was a local hit.

Hall moved back to Union Theatres, running publicity for the State Theatre in Sydney, and working on the campaign against the proposed entertainment tax from Stanley Bruce&#x27;s government. He eventually became assistant to Stuart F. Doyle, managing director of the company.

===Formation of Cinesound: 1931–1934===

Doyle established Cinesound Productions to make local films and assigned Hall to direct a number of shorts including &quot;Thar She Blows!&quot; (1931), about the whaling industry, and &quot;That&#x27;s Cricket&quot; (1931). He then gave Hall the job of directing a film adaptation of the popular play &quot;On Our Selection&quot;, adapted by Bert Bailey from the writings of Steele Rudd about the adventures of a fictional Australian farming family, the Rudds, and the perennial father-and-son duo, &#x27;Dad and Dave&#x27;. Hall persuaded Bailey to reprise his stage performance as Dad Rudd. The result was a massively popular film, which was among the top four most popular films in Australian cinemas in 1932, earning £46,000 in Australia and New Zealand by the end of 1933.

Hall and Cinesound decided to follow it with another adaptation of a play written by Bailey, &quot;The Squatter&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1933). It was a melodrama set in the Australian bush, and starred a discovery of Hall&#x27;s, Jocelyn Howarth, who later had a Hollywood career as &quot;Constance Worth&quot;. It was successful at the box office. During this time he made a short documentary &quot;Ghosts of Port Arthur&quot; (1933).

Hall&#x27;s third feature was &quot;The Silence of Dean Maitland&quot; (1934), another melodrama based on a play (which had been based on a novel). It starred English stage star John Longden. The film encountered censorship issues but was highly popular. &quot;Dean Maitland&quot; was released on a double bill with &quot;Cinesound Varieties&quot; (1934), a short film directed by Hall featuring several musical acts.

Hall&#x27;s fourth feature, &quot;Strike Me Lucky&quot; (1934), was a vehicle for stage comedian Roy &quot;Mo&quot; Rene, one of the most popular performers in Australia. It was Hall&#x27;s first feature that was a film original, and not based on other material. However the film was not well received and Hall later said it was the only one of his movies not to go into profit.

===Middle career: 1935–1937===
Needing a sure-fire hit, Hall then persuaded Bert Bailey to reprise his role as Dad Rudd in &quot;Grandad Rudd&quot; (1935), based on a play co-written by Bailey. It was popular, although not as big a hit as &quot;On Our Selection&quot;.

Hall intended to follow this movie with a version of &quot;Robbery Under Arms&quot; but decided not to proceed because of uncertainty arising from a ban the NSW government had on films about bushrangers. Cinesound ceased production for several months in 1935 to enable Hall to travel to Hollywood and research production methods.

Hall returned to Australia with new filmmaking equipment and an American screenwriter Edmond Seward, who was to take over Cinesound&#x27;s story department. Seward wrote &quot;Thoroughbred&quot; (1936), a horse racing drama based on the life of Phar Lap. It starred imported Hollywood actor Helen Twelvetrees and was a success.

Seward also wrote Hall&#x27;s next film, &quot;Orphan of the Wilderness&quot; (1936), the story of a boxing kangaroo. It was meant to be a 50-minute movie in the vein of &quot;Cinesound Varieties&quot; but Hall decided to expand it to feature length.

Hall returned to comedy with &quot;It Isn&#x27;t Done&quot; (1937), based on an idea by its star, Cecil Kellaway. It was the first movie Hall made from a script by Frank Harvey, who would write most of his subsequent films. It was also the film debut of Shirley Ann Richards.

Richards was the female lead in Hall&#x27;s next film, &quot;Tall Timbers&quot; (1937), an adventure tale set in logging country, based on a story by Frank Hurley.

===Comic series: 1938–1940===
Hall made two films with comic George Wallace: &quot;Let George Do It&quot; (1938) and &quot;Gone to the Dogs&quot;. In between these two, he made a third Rudd film, &quot;Dad and Dave Come to Town&quot; (1938), which featured a performance from a young Peter Finch. Hall gave Finch a bigger role in &quot;Mr Chedworth Steps Out&quot; (1939), a vehicle for Cecil Kellaway. Hall produced and co-wrote, but did not direct, &quot;Come Up Smiling&quot; (1939), a vehicle for Will Mahoney. He made a fourth and final Rudd, &quot;Dad Rudd, M.P.&quot; (1940), which introduced Grant Taylor.

==World War II==
Film production at Cinesound ground to a halt with the advent of World War II, although Hall kept busy during this period producing and directing newsreels, documentaries and short subjects, including &quot;Road to Victory&quot; (1941) and &quot;Anzacs in Overalls&quot; (1941).

Hall also did shorts with dramatised segments, such as &quot;Another Threshold&quot; (1942), and short features, &quot;100,000 Cobbers&quot; (1942) and &quot;South West Pacific&quot; (1943).

===&quot;Kokoda Front Line&quot; (1942)===
His most notable newsreel was the Oscar-winning &quot;Kokoda Front Line&quot; (1942) – the first time an Australian film/documentary was awarded an Oscar.

==Post-war career==
===&quot;Smithy&quot; (1946)===
After the war Hall returned to feature film production, enjoying a big success with &quot;Smithy&quot;, a film biography of Australia&#x27;s most famous aviator, Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, which he produced, co-wrote and directed. This film was financed by Columbia Pictures, who went on to offer its star, Ron Randell, a long-term contract in Hollywood.

However, attempts by Hall to make further feature films (particularly an adaptation of the novel &quot;Robbery Under Arms&quot;, which he later described as &quot;the film I wanted to make more than any other&quot;) were not successful, partly because the Greater Union cinema chain, who had backed all of Cinesound&#x27;s films in the 1930s, were no longer enthusiastic about investing in local production. He was also stymied by the fact that the Australian government refused to allow money over a certain amount to be raised for films. In particular, an attempt to raise £160,000 to make two films in collaboration with Ealing Studios, including a version of &quot;Robbery Under Arms&quot;, was refused government permission.

His short subjects included &quot;Can John Braund Cure Cancer?&quot; (1948), &quot;Fighting Blood&quot; (1951), and &quot;Overland Adventure&quot; (1956).

His last documentary was &quot;The Kurnell Story&quot; (1957).

==Television==
In 1956, Hall became the first general manager for Channel Nine in Sydney, where he remained until 1966. There he instigated the practice of showing feature films uncut; previously in Australia they had been cut to fit the television schedules.

==Later years==
On 1 January 1972, Hall was awarded the Order of the British Empire for his services to the &quot;Australian motion picture industry.&quot; The Australian Film Institute recognised his ability to convey the unique Australian character on film, and his important contribution to the development of the Australian film industry, with a Raymond Longford Award for &quot;Lifetime Achievement&quot; in 1976. In 1985, he was inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame. He was a freemason.

Hall was vocal in his criticism of the Australian New Wave, remarking in 1979, &quot;the market for Australian films is flooded with mediocre to weak product. Too many of these films cannot stand up to the competition and will drown.&quot; He supported the production of local commercial films, his motto being &quot;Give the audience what they want.&quot;

Hall suffered a stroke in 1993. He died in Sydney on 8 February 1994. He wrote an autobiography, &quot;Directed by Ken G. Hall&quot; (1977), later updated as &quot;Australian Film: The Inside Story&quot; (1980). His wife since 1925, Irene Addison, had died in 1972. Hall never remarried.

==Legacy==
In 1995, the Australian National Film and Sound Archive (Screensound) inaugurated the annual Ken G. Hall Award, which is presented by the Archive each year to a person, organisation or group that has made an outstanding contribution to Australian film preservation. Past winners of the Award are Alan Rydge and Rupert Murdoch (1995), Peter Weir (1996), Kodak Australasia Pty Ltd (1997), Joan Long AM (1999), Anthony Buckley (2000), Murray Forrest (2001), Judy Adamson (2002), Tom Nurse (2003) and archivist and historian Graham Shirley (2004).

Stage 3 at Fox Studios in Sydney is named after him.

<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Takahashi. It was published in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from 1983 to 1987, and collected in 18 bound volumes. The manga became digitally available in English through the Apple&#x27;s iTunes App Store in 2011. It was licensed in North America in 2020 by Manga Planet.

The series tells the story of a young Akita Inu pup called Gin (Japanese for &quot;silver&quot;) who leaves his master, a young boy named Daisuke, to join a pack of wild dogs. The pack is gathering strong dogs from all over Japan to fight a giant, monstrous, bloodthirsty and deranged Kodiak bear named Akakabuto (Japanese for &quot;red helmet&quot;) and his entire army of bears. The story begins from the point of view of the humans, but swings to the dogs afterwards. Takahashi was reportedly inspired by a news article about hunting dogs that had been abandoned by their owners and had begun living as wild animals.

&quot;Silver Fang: The Shooting Star Gin&quot; was adapted as a 21-episode anime television series by Toei Animation. In western countries, the anime was released as a set of four VHS tapes, and censored for violent images to make the anime more suitable for younger audiences. This led to the removal of several plot-critical scenes, including all footage from the episodes preceding the series finale as well as the deaths of certain characters. Due to limitations of sound-editing at the time this resulted in the background music of certain scenes to be lost.

It received the 1987 Shogakukan Manga Award for best series.

A sequel manga by Takahashi, titled &quot;Weed&quot;, was published from 1999 to 2009, with four other series following since.

===Anime===
The TV series was produced by TV Asahi and Toei Animation, with Tomoharu Katsumata serving as series director, Mitsuru Majima and Kenji Terada writing the scripts, Jōji Yanase designing the characters, and Gorō Oumi composing the music. It was broadcast every Monday from 19:30 to 20:00 (Japan Standard Time) on TV Asahi affiliate stations from April 7 to September 22, 1986, for a total of 21 episodes. The anime adaptation ended with the Akakabuto arc, and the Hakkenshi arc was not produced. In addition, the development of the last half of the story is simplified, with some dogs lacking any lines and their appearances reduced compared to the original manga. Takayuki Miyauchi performed both the opening and ending themes, &quot;Nagareboshi Gin&quot; and &quot;TOMORROW&quot;.

<text>Tremadog (formerly Tremadoc) is a village in the community of Porthmadog, in Gwynedd, north west Wales; about north of Porthmadog town centre. It was a planned settlement, founded by William Madocks, who bought the land in 1798. The centre of Tremadog was complete by 1811 and remains substantially unaltered. Tremadog hosted an unofficial National Eisteddfod event in 1872.

==Planning==



By mid-1805, Madocks had already built some houses on the site of Tremadog, for he wrote to the Post-Master at Caernarfon informing him that letters addressed to Pentre-Gwaelod should be delivered to the new houses he had built on Traeth Mawr, near Tan-yr-Allt. Pentre-Gwaelod translates as Bottom Village, but Madocks had grander plans, for aldermen and a mayor had been appointed, and he corrected the word &quot;village&quot; in a letter written soon afterward to read &quot;borough&quot;. He planned it himself, perhaps with some help from architectural friends and architectural books, but his letters reveal that a master plan was never produced, as he held the ideas for the settlement in his mind.

Tremadog is a good example of a planned town, with an array of Georgian architecture built in the classical tradition of the 18th century. It is located immediately below the high ground of Snowdonia and on the edge of the modern Snowdonia National Park.

Tremadog was built on flat land reclaimed from Traeth Mawr, the estuary of the Afon Glaslyn, and to enhance its appearance Madocks placed the Market Square, the centre of his project, just in front of a great crag of rock, the former edge of the estuary. It towers some over the Town Hall, and the coaching inn, giving a theatrical effect to the area. He hoped to attract more buildings that fitted his overall plan, but this plan failed and he eventually funded most of them himself. The main streets were named Dublin Street and London Street, as Madocks wanted Tremadog to be a stopping-off point on the main route from London to Porth Dinllaen on the Llŷn Peninsula, which was intended to be the chief port for ferries to Dublin. However, this plan failed when Holyhead supplanted Porth Dinllaen as the main ferry port. He was keen that everything should enhance the village&#x27;s appearance — his main interest. Unlike some contemporary town planners, he was less interested in the moral reform of the inhabitants: he felt that people had the right to work, educate their children, pray, drink, gamble, save or waste money as they saw fit; and that the town should give its residents opportunities to get on with their own lives, providing that they were congenial neighbours.

Tremadog Town Hall is located in the Market Square. Five round arches supported the front of the building, and the ground floor was used as a market hall. The dancing room had a fireplace at both ends, a minstrels&#x27; gallery on the back wall, and five large sash windows at the front, overlooking the square. It was reached by stairs from the tap room in the adjacent public house so that people attending a dance did not have to pass through the market area. The roof was in a similar style to many of Madocks&#x27; buildings, with a shallow pitch of slates, and wide eaves, while a flight of steps ran across the front of the building, creating a plinth on which it stood. There were six medallions and five keystones on the front of the building, with representations of theatrical figures.

During August, the market space became a theatre. The house to the east of the town hall was quite shallow, allowing a stage to be built behind it, connected to the market space by a proscenium arch. Madocks wrote several stirring prologues and a play for the theatre, and there are rumours that the playwright and poet Sheridan acted in a production of his play &quot;The Rivals&quot; there, although it was probably his son Tom, who was a contemporary of Madocks.

==Church and chapel==
Madocks believed that &quot;in education and religion all ought to have fair play&quot;, and this was reflected in the provision of a Gothic revival style church for the Anglicans and a classical chapel for the Methodists. His approach did not find favour with the Bishop of Bangor, but he defended his decision by telling the Bishop that the church would be built on rock, while the chapel would be built on sand. This was true geologically, but was also a reference to the parable of the Wise and the Foolish Builders in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke.

The church was built on a rocky outcrop, which had once been an island in the estuary, and was one of the first churches to be built in Gothic revival style in Wales. The tower supported a spire, built in brick which was rendered with Parkers Roman Cement. It deceived the antiquarian Richard Fenton, who described it as yellow freestone in his book of travels published soon after 1813. The entrance to the churchyard is spanned by a decorative arch of Coade stone, a ceramic material manufactured in Lambeth, London, which is in Gothic horror style, with representations of boars, dragons, frogs, grimacing cherubs, owls, shrouded figures and squirrels, while the tops of the towers are surrounded by elephants&#x27; heads. Madocks wanted it to become a parish church, but it was only ever a chapel of ease, as Tremadog was part of the parish of Ynyscynhaearn. The population of the parish as a whole in 1841 was 1,888. Although he provided a churchyard, no burials took place, but it was one of the few buildings in the region where services were regularly conducted in the English language.

The church was fitted with box pews, cast iron windows with coloured glass, and a blue ceiling with stars painted on it. There was a crypt, the precise location of which is unknown, in which Madocks hoped to be buried, but he died in Paris and was buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery. He is commemorated by a brass plaque, which also commemorates the wedding of Mary Madocks to Martin Williams there in 1811. John Williams, originally a gardener from Anglesey, who worked tirelessly to complete Madocks&#x27; plans when he was so often away, was buried in the vault when he died in 1850, as were his wife and their only son, W T Massey Williams.

Music was supplied by a small barrel organ, but it was not adequate and was moved to Ynyscynhaearn, where it is still in the gallery. A replacement was bought from Bates of Ludgate Hill in 1857. In 1898, the chancel floor was raised, and the windows were replaced. A new roof was fitted in the 1950s, and the ceiling was removed, while the spire was repaired with cement in the 1970s. The building ceased to be used for worship in 1995 and was eventually bought by Cyfeillion Cadw Tremadog, a trust dedicated to the repair and refurbishment of the historic buildings of Tremadog, in 2005. The fabric was repaired, and modern facilities installed. An upper floor was fitted, and the building was subsequently used as offices by Cartrefi Cymru (&quot;Homes of Wales&quot;), a charity which assists disabled people living in the community. Repair of the coadestone arch, requiring the manufacture of several replacement parts, was completed in 2007.

In December 2017, Ffestiniog Travel moved into the church.

Capel Peniel, which was built by the Methodists, and was one of the first buildings to be completed in the settlement, was quite unlike most Welsh chapels. On the outside, it looked like a Greek temple, while inside the pulpit was on the end wall rather than the more traditional long side wall. Methodists had begun a Sunday School in a house in 1805, and in 1808 Madocks gave them the land on a 99-year lease, subject to a peppercorn rent. It was completed in two and a half years — 18 months before the church — and the first service was led by Thomas Charles from Bala. Since Madocks and his family were there, he conducted the service in English, and the two men became friends, with Charles often visiting Tan-yr-Allt, where Madocks lived.

The front facade, with a large circular window, was not completed until 1849, and the work was supervised by John Williams, Madocks&#x27; agent, who continued to serve the community long after Madocks&#x27; death in 1828. As the congregation grew, galleries were built in 1840 and 1880, and extensive plasterwork was added between 1908 and 1910. The chapel is one of only five grade I listed nonconformist chapels in Wales, and it was hoped to refurbish it for the bicentenary in 2010.

==Governance==
There is a separate electoral ward called Porthmadog-Tremadog. The total ward population of Tremadog at the 2011 census was 1,257.

==Industry==
In the early 1800s, there was a thriving woollen industry, supplying garments to South Carolina and other southern states of America, the West Indies, South America, and Russia, but it was a cottage industry. One of Madocks&#x27; first projects was to build a factory where wool could be processed on an industrial scale. Although there were a few sites in Wales where the fulling of cloth was powered by water, this was one of the first woollen mills where water power was used for carding and spinning. The building was located close to his home at Tan-yr-Allt, because the high ground behind it provided a good head of water. It had a characteristic shallow-pitched slate roof, and Madocks instructed that the walls should be yellow, and the windows painted dark green. Nearby were a corn mill and a fulling mill. The water was provided by building a dam across a small valley, to form Llyn Cwm Bach, with sluices channelling the water to feed the mill and the factory.

Although Madocks initially employed a Mr Fanshawe to manage the factory, he was not happy with his performance, and soon the project was being managed by John Williams, Madocks&#x27; assistant. The building was advertised for sale in 1810, and from 1835 was used as a tannery. It still stands but has a temporary roof. In the 1990s, the Tremadog Buildings Preservation Trust obtained permission for its repair and conversion but failed to acquire the site.

==Houses==
Most of the houses of Tremadog were of a similar plan, and in common with townhouses of the period, opened directly onto the square. They had a central doorway, with a parlour or a shop on each side, and there were two bedrooms on the upper floor. Shops were not a common feature of Welsh villages at the time, but the Mayor opened a general store, which was supplied from London, and Madocks instructed his assistant to look out for a shoemaker, a tailor, a butcher and a weaver. At the back of the houses, there was a lean-to scullery, running across the full width of the buildings. For the two inns, the nature of the reclaimed land prevented the digging of a dry cellar, and in this case, half of the scullery was replaced by a structure with a stone vaulted roof, which helped to regulate the internal temperature. Evidence of this can be seen in the bar of the Golden Fleece Inn in the village centre.

Ty Pâb was the end of the first phase of the building on the road leading to the church, originally called London Road, but subsequently renamed Church Street. Arches on the side of the building mark the planned location of a cross street, which was never built.

===Tŷ Nanney, Tan-yr-Allt and Wern Manor===
The ordinary houses were supplemented by several gentlemen&#x27;s villas. Tŷ Nanney is a good example in the village itself, and is a Grade II* listed building. Tan-yr-Allt, Madocks&#x27; home, is situated to the north-east of the village centre. It is listed at Grade II* and stands in gardens and a small park which are designated Grade II on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales. Wern Manor, to the west, is also a Grade II* listed house with a Grade II listed garden, designed by Thomas Mawson at the very end of the 19th century.

==Education==
&#x27;Ysgol y Gorlan&#x27;, a primary school, is the only school in Tremadog. It is a state school which caters for 120 pupils between the ages of three and eleven. Most of the leavers go to &#x27;Ysgol Eifionydd&#x27;, the nearest secondary school, in Porthmadog.

==Canal==
Madocks enlarged a drainage ditch to the river Glaslyn to form a canal which was opened in about 1815. It was used for 35 years to carry copper ore from a local mine, before being replaced by a tramline.

==Tourism==
Tremadog is an increasingly popular tourist destination. The area&#x27;s long, quiet roads attract motorcyclists, and Tremadog also has a good quality rock climbing &quot;crag&quot; (another has been closed because of rock instability) which attracts climbers from all over the UK. There have been issues with access to the crags, with local farmers and the Nature Conservancy Council trying to prevent climbing, but one section, Craig Bwlch y Moch, has been owned by the British Mountaineering Council since 1979. Deteriorating conditions led to annual events to tidy up the climbs between 2007 and 2010, and negotiations with the Forestry Commission resulted in invasive sycamore trees being removed in 2009. A further event was held in April 2012, but a climber was injured in May 2012 when huge blocks of rock were dislodged during a climb.

Tremadog also boasts one of the country&#x27;s most iconic chapels. Peniel, a Calvinist Methodist chapel, was finished in 1810 and then expanded after Construction work, with its eye-catching and unusual columns, finishing in 1849, its temple front loosely based on St. Paul&#x27;s Church, Covent Garden, in London.

The design of the building went on to influence how other chapels in Wales during the period were built, but the site was forced to close in 2015 as its dwindling congregation was unable to keep it open. It is set to be rejuvenated, funds pending.

Below these crags is a café, campsite and bunkhouse, which provides a base for climbers.

==Famous residents==

<text>Alboraya () or Alboraia () is a town and municipality of the province of Valencia, Spain. It is situated very close to the city of Valencia.

Originally a farming community, Alboraya has grown in recent decades following the development of the metropolitan area of Valencia. Better transport connections, including two stations on the Valencia metro system (Alboraya-Palmaret and Alboraya-Peris Aragó). The population increased from 11,267 in 1986, to an estimated 24,741 in 2020. Of these, 58.84% declared themselves to be Valencian speakers.

In 1994, 45.8% worked in the service sector, 33% in industry, 16.7% in agriculture, and 3.60% in construction.

In the May 2011 elections, the People&#x27;s Party (PP) lost their absolute majority, as they fell from 11 to 8 council seats. The remaining seats were won by the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) (5), Unión Popular de Alboraya (3), Coalició Compromís (3) and Ciudadanos por Alboraya (Citizens for Alboraya) (2). Subsequently, a coalition of everyone but the PP was formed, with Miguel Chavarria becoming the first PSOE Mayor since 1999.

Traditional crops are based on irrigated, intensive farming. Especially important are the tiger nuts (, ), which are used to produce horchata, a popular refreshment.

== Geography ==
The town still contains large, open, irrigated fields which are farmed intensively but these areas are shrinking due to urban pressure. The designation of the city of Valencia as host city for the 2007 America&#x27;s Cup sparked major land development. Seventy-five percent of the competing teams located their bases of operation in Alboraya.

The municipality is divided into eight parts: Calvet, Desamparados, Mar, Masamardá, Masquefa, Miracle, Savoy and Vera.

Alboraya is connected to the rest of the Valencian metropolitan area by Line 3 of the Valencia Metro with two stations, Alboraya and Palmaret, Line 70 of the Municipal Transport Company of Valencia, EMT, and Patacona provides buses on Line 31 of the EMT bus company.

The council offers the people a local bus service, which runs through the villages of Alboraya, linking the village with Port Saplaya and Patacona seven days a week, with a frequency of one bus every hour.

=== Neighbouring towns ===

Alquería Muslim King James I of Aragon gave land to the bishop of Huesca, Canyelles Vidal. Teresa Gil de Vidaura, managed the property through a land swap with the bishop which strengthened the patrimony of James of Jericho, and his son King James II of Aragon. In 1331, it passed into the hands of Gilberto Zanoguera [1], who founded the lordship of Alboraya. During the 15th century, it was held by the Crown. At the end, is the outback of Rafelterras.

In its place is the deserted Rafelterras. The church was built in the 15th century and dedicated to Santa Maria. Along the Carraixet ravine a chapel was constructed dedicated to Our Lady of Desamparados (the Virgin of the Helpless), its first building dates from 1414 and was ordered built by the General Council of Valencia the year 1400. It included a consecrated cemetery where the executed and disadvantaged were buried. The current building is new.

The main activity is agriculture, and the most important crop is the plug, which has become popular in the Alboraya horchata.

Alboraya still retains the flavour typical of people in an important part of the town. The coastline is nearly four miles long, with two residential neighborhoods separated by the mouth of the Barranco del Carraixet: Port Saplaya and Patacona. The first has a marina that offers the possibility of having mooring a boat at ones front door. It is a residential complex and walk characterized by the warm ochres, blue and pale pink, traditionally used in the painting of houses. The second has housing in the space occupied by a former paper mill. Both areas have excellent beaches.

Some of its monuments include The Parish Church of Our Lady of the Assumption (18th century) with the home abbey formed in a block. The people of Alboraya have other shrines such as the Chapel of the Holy Christ of Souls in Mas Vilanova, the shrine of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the house of the Rector, the Hermitage of Santa Barbara (recently restored ) in the neighborhood of the same name, the Chapel of San Cristobal near the industrial estate, and at the mouth of the Barranco del Carraixet the Chapel of the Peixets (Miracle of the fish). All of them are part of an important historical and artistic heritage, rich in sculptures, paintings, retables, and pottery.

<text>Mildred Dorothy Dunnock (January 25, 1901 – July 5, 1991) was an American stage and screen actress. She was nominated twice for an Academy Award for her works in &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; (1951) and &quot;Baby Doll&quot; (1956).

==Early life==
Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Dunnock graduated from Western High School. She developed an interest in theater while she was a student at Goucher College where she was a member of Alpha Phi sorority and the Agora dramatic society. After graduating, she taught English at Friends School of Baltimore and helped with productions of plays there. 

While teaching school in New York, she earned her Master of Arts degree at Columbia University and acted in a play while she was there. She also studied at the Actors Studio under Lee Strasberg, Robert Lewis and Elia Kazan.

==Career==
After roles in Broadway productions of &quot;Life Begins&quot; (1932) and &quot;The Hill Between&quot; (1938), Dunnock won praise for her performance as a Welsh school teacher in &quot;The Corn is Green&quot; in 1940 — a role that she performed while she was a full-time teacher at Brearley School. The 1945 film version marked her screen debut. During the 1940s she performed mainly on stage, in such dramas as &quot;Another Part of the Forest&quot; (1946) and &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; (1949) and in the musical &quot;Lute Song&quot; (1946). She also performed in regional theatrical productions, including those of the Long Wharf Theatre and the Yale Repertory Theatre.

In 1947, she became a founding member of the Actors Studio.

Dunnock reprised her role as Linda Loman, Willy&#x27;s wife, in the 1951 film version of Death of a Salesman. She originated the role of Big Mama on Broadway in Tennessee Williams&#x27; play &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;, although she lost the film role to Judith Anderson. Several of her films include &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot; (1955), &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; (1956), &quot;Baby Doll&quot; (1956), &quot;Peyton Place&quot; (1957), &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Story&quot; (1959), &quot;Butterfield 8&quot; (1960), &quot;Something Wild&quot; (1961) and &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; (1962). She was the woman in the wheelchair pushed down a flight of stairs to her death by the psychotic villain Tommy Udo (Richard Widmark) in &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; (1947). She also appeared in guest roles on numerous TV series such as &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; and &quot;Ponds Theater&quot;, and, later in her career, several television movies.

Dunnock was twice nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, for &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; in 1951, and for &quot;Baby Doll&quot; in 1956. She was also nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Baby Doll&quot;, as well as &quot;Viva Zapata!&quot; in 1952 and &quot;Peyton Place&quot; in 1957.

In 1960 she appeared in the play &quot;The Crystal Heart&quot; at the East 74th Street Theater with Virginia Vestoff (in her first professional appearance), with top seats selling for $4.96 ($ in current dollar terms).

In 1966, she played Linda Loman for the third time in the television film adaptation of &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, alongside her original Broadway co-star, Lee J. Cobb. This earned Dunnock a nomination for an Emmy Award in 1967, in the category of Outstanding Single Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Drama.

Her final film was &quot;The Pick-up Artist&quot; (1987), which starred Robert Downey Jr. and Molly Ringwald.

Dunnock has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contribution to motion pictures, at 6613 Hollywood Boulevard. She is also a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame, which she was inducted into in 1983.

==Personal life and death==
Dunnock was married to Keith Urmy, an executive at Chemical Bank in Manhattan, from 1933 until her death. The couple had one child. In 1991, at age 90, Dunnock died from natural causes in Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts, although at that time she was a resident of nearby West Tisbury.
