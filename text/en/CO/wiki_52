<text>Alexander Parkes (29 December 1813 29 June 1890) was a metallurgist and inventor from Birmingham, England. He created Parkesine, the first man-made plastic.

==Biography==
The son of a manufacturer of brass locks, Parkes was apprenticed to Messenger and Sons, brass founders of Birmingham, before going to work for George and Henry Elkington, who patented the electroplating process. Parkes was put in charge of the casting department, and his attention soon began to focus on electroplating. Parkes took out his first patent (No. 8905) in 1841 on a process for electroplating delicate works of art. His improved method for electroplating fine and fragile objects, such as flowers, was granted a patent in 1843. The process involved electroplating an object previously dipped in a solution of phosphorus contained in bisulphide of carbon, and then in nitrate of silver. A spider&#x27;s web, silver-plated according to this method, was presented to Prince Albert when he visited the Elkington works in 1844.

In total Parkes held at least 66 patents on processes and products, mostly related to electroplating and to development of plastics.

*In 1846, he patented the cold cure process for vulcanizing rubber, called by Thomas Hancock &quot;one of the most valuable and extraordinary discoveries of the age&quot;.
*He pioneered the addition of small quantities of phosphorus to metals and alloys, and developed phosphor-bronze (patent 12325 of 1848, taken out jointly with his brother Henry Parkes).
*In 1850, he developed and patented the Parkes process for economically desilvering lead, also patenting refinements to the process in 1851 and 1852.
*In 1856, he patented Parkesine the first thermoplastic a celluloid based on nitrocellulose treated with a variety of solvents. This material, exhibited at the 1862 London International Exhibition, anticipated many of the modern aesthetic and utility uses of plastics.
*In 1866, he set up The Parkesine Company at Hackney Wick, London, for bulk low-cost production. It was not commercially successful, however, for Parkesine was expensive to produce, prone to cracking and highly flammable. The business closed in 1868.
*Parkes&#x27; material was developed later in improved form as Xylonite by his associate Daniel Spill, who brought a patent infringement lawsuit ultimately unsuccessful against John Wesley Hyatt, developer of celluloid in the US. In 1870, however, the judge ruled that Parkes was the true inventor, owing to his original experiments.

==Personal and family details==
Alexander Parkes was born at Suffolk Street, Birmingham, the fourth son of James Mears Parkes and his wife Kerenhappuch Childs. Samuel Harrison, described by Sir Josiah Mason as the inventor of the split-ring (or key-ring) and widely credited with the invention of the steel pen, was his great-uncle. Parkes was twice married. By his first marriage, to Jane Henshall Moore (1817–50), he had four sons and two daughters (the cricketer Howard Parkes was a grandson), and by his second marriage, to Mary Ann Roderick (1835–1919), four sons and seven daughters. The elder surviving son of his second marriage, Alexander Parkes junior, sometime President of the Association of Certified and Corporate Accountants, presented many original specimens of Parkesine to the Science Museum in 1937, the core of the museum&#x27;s Parkesine collection.

Parkes&#x27; younger brother Henry (1824–1909), a trained chemist, who was married to Fanny Roderick (1837–97), a sister of Alexander&#x27;s second wife, assisted him in many of his experiments during a collaboration lasting more than fifty years.

It is believed that the Parkes family descends from the Rev. Michael Parkes, Vicar of Penkridge, Staffordshire (died 1617), and had close connections with the metal-working towns of Wednesbury and Wolverhampton in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.

==Legacy==

Parkes is remembered in several locations:

*The Plastics Historical Society placed a blue plaque on his home in Dulwich, London, in 2002; 
*The Birmingham Civic Society erected a blue plaque commemorating him in 2004 on the original Elkington Silver Electroplating Works (the old Science Museum), Newhall Street, Birmingham;
* There is also a plaque on the wall of the site of the Parkesine Works.

In September 2005, Parkes was posthumously inducted into the American Plastics Academy&#x27;s Hall of Fame. He is buried in West Norwood Cemetery, London, although his memorial was removed in the 1970s.

<text>Cape Terawhiti is the southwesternmost point of the North Island of New Zealand.

The cape is located to the west of Wellington, the capital city of New Zealand. Ohau Point, located on the northern tip of Cape Terawhiti and, along with Perano Head on Arapaoa Island in the Marlborough Sounds, marks the narrowest part of Cook Strait.

It is also the closest point in the North Island to the South Island, with West Head, at the mouth of the Tory Channel being only away (this point in the South Island lies to the northwest of Cape Terawhiti).

Cape Terawhiti, from which historic Terawhiti Station gets its name, came into being through a misconception of Captain Cook’s Tahitian interpreter, Tupaea. When, in 1769, Cook asked what the land in the east was, the local Maori replied simply, &#x27;the east&#x27;. In fact Te Ra-whiti (The Rising Sun) is the general Maori term for the East Coast of the North Island. Omere is said to be the original name of Cape Terawhiti.

At the southern end of Cape Terawhiti is Oteranga Bay, the termination point for the inter-island Cook Strait power cable. The proper name for the bay is Oterongo.

The &quot;Maria&quot;, on its way from Lyttelton Harbour to Wellington, foundered at Cape Terawhiti on 23 July 1851, with the loss of 26 lives and 2 survivors. One of those drowned was the early Canterbury settler William Deans. Gold was found near Cape Terawhiti in 1862 and was mined for several years.

<doc id="1287110" wikidata="Q4460120" url="?curid=1287110" title="Tom Goes to the Mayor">
<text>Tom Goes to the Mayor is an American adult animated sitcom created by Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim for Cartoon Network&#x27;s late night programming block, Adult Swim. It premiered on November 14, 2004 and ended on September 25, 2006 with a total of 30 episodes.

==History==
&quot;Tom Goes to the Mayor&quot; began as a web cartoon on timanderic.com. It was popular enough to get a web sequel, in which David Cross guest stars. Bob Odenkirk noticed the show&#x27;s potential, and began producing it for Adult Swim.

Adult Swim has described &quot;Tom Goes to the Mayor&quot; as &quot;one of the most polarizing shows&quot; they have ever had, indicating that viewers &quot;either love it or hate it.&quot;

==Overview==
Tom Peters (Tim Heidecker) has just moved to Jefferton, an unpleasant, rundown town filled with strip malls and buffets. Episodes usually focus on Tom going to the mayor (Eric Wareheim), hence the title of the show, with various ideas for business and civic endeavors, and the Mayor tweaks those ideas and causes them to backfire in horrible and destructive ways, leaving Tom to answer for them.

The show features a crude but distinctive limited animation style made by taking photos of the cast with different facial expressions and body language. The photos are then filtered using the &quot;photocopy&quot; image filter in Adobe Photoshop, resulting in the show&#x27;s unique monochromatic blue and white images resembling Ditto machine copies. There are some live-action scenes, usually on a television set within the show.

Many characters, segments, and content from &quot;Tom Goes to the Mayor&quot; have resurfaced in &quot;Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!&quot;, including the Channel 5 Married News Team, the Cinco Company, Gibbons, and even a live-action version of &quot;Tom Goes to the Mayor&quot; used as an opening for the episode &quot;Pepperoni&quot;.

==Characters==

* Tom Peters (Tim Heidecker) – Tom Peters (né Pickle) is a good-natured 32-year-old entrepreneur whose ideas are often turned into disasters due to continuous inept interference from the mayor. Tom comes across as weak-willed, timid and lacking in self-esteem, never calling out the mayor on his irrational behavior and allowing himself to be used and manipulated by everyone he comes into contact with. He is often taunted by his stepchildren (from wife Joy&#x27;s previous marriage), not to mention the rants he receives from Joy. Tom has no apparent job (besides &quot;local entrepreneur&quot;) and drives a Maluch that has severe emission problems. A common running gag on the show is that despite Tom&#x27;s name being very simple, it is nearly always misspelled when written out, such as &quot;Tom Petres&quot;, &quot;Thom P. Tiers&quot; and &quot;Taumpy Tearrs.&quot; Another running gag to the show is Tom mispronouncing words; for example, when presenting his résumé to the Mayor, he pronounces it as &quot;resume&quot;. He also never uses profanity and instead uses phrases like &quot;shirt&quot;, &quot;crickets&quot;, etc. – even going so far as to refer to a dam as a &quot;darn&quot;. His first wife was a woman named Pat, who is now married to her husband Cal.
* The Mayor (Eric Wareheim) – The Mayor is a superficially friendly yet childish and sadistic man who often spends his working days watching the TV in his office. He often uses a condescending tone when speaking to Tom. He usually gains control of Tom&#x27;s suggestions for the community and twists them into embarrassing and bizarre situations. According to the Adult Swim website, he has served Jefferton for the past twelve years, due to family connections, low voter turnout, and a strange local law which gives the mayor thirteen-year terms of office. However, it is worth noting that the Mayor has been in office since the Pioneer Island Theme Park burned down &quot;20 years ago.&quot; The Mayor is married and has three sons. Throughout the series, the Mayor has displayed traits such as stupidity, insanity, selfishness and even wickedness.
* Joy Peters (Stephanie Courtney (voice), Michael Q. Schmidt (live action)) – Tom&#x27;s obese, slovenly, greedy and mean wife. She is very domineering and arrogant towards Tom and is a selfish and uncaring mother to her sons. Although her master bed is large, she makes Tom sleep on a cot off to the side. She is often seen hogging their computer—which she uses to chat with strange men—to the point where it impedes Tom&#x27;s business schemes. Joy is gluttonous and often seen messily gobbling food.
* Tom&#x27;s stepsons – Brandon, Brendon and Brindon are Joy&#x27;s idiotic, destructive and deformed-looking children from her first marriage, who became Tom&#x27;s stepsons. Renamed after a re-birthing process.
* Jan Skylar (Tim Heidecker) &amp; Wayne Skylar (Eric Wareheim) – &quot;the &quot;only&quot; married news team in the tri-county area&quot; are newscasters on Channel 5. After the series finished Jan and Wayne Skylar became recurring characters on &quot;Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!&quot; and &quot;Check It Out! with Dr. Steve Brule&quot;.
* The City Council (Craig Anton &amp; Ron Lynch) – Jefferton&#x27;s city council, who often meet at Gulliver&#x27;s Buffet. They try to be the voice of reason when the mayor presents them with insane and nonsensical plans, but they don&#x27;t put up much of a fight due to their overall unenthusiasm.
* Gibbons (Brian Posehn) – Tom&#x27;s old &quot;friend&quot; from junior college, who suffers from a height disorder and speaks in monotone. Despite claiming to be friends, Tom will often uncharacteristically lose his patience with Gibbons and start to bully him.
* Renee the Receptionist (Stephanie Courtney) – The Mayor&#x27;s bored receptionist.
* Bob Odenkirk often appears as various characters in many episodes, sometimes appearing in live-action instead of sketched.

<text>City Island, Daytona Beach, Florida, United States, is an island in the Halifax River (a section of the Intracoastal Waterway) between mainland Florida and the barrier islands/outer banks. Buildings on the island include the Daytona Tortugas&#x27; Jackie Robinson Ballpark, the city&#x27;s courthouse, and the main branch of the Volusia County Library.

==Geology==

The bedrock of City Island is part of the Anastasia Formation of interbedded sands and coquinoid limestones (known as Coquina), created during the late Pleistocene Epoch. On top of the bedrock are layers of river sediments, built up and deposited by the Halifax River. Channel dredgings in the last 100 years were also deposited on City Island.

City Island is an urbanized area, resembling any small Florida city. The animal life on the island are typical of such an environment: squirrels, rabbits, abundant Green and Brown Anole lizards, occasional raccoons and skunk, as well as a large population of doves and pigeons.

The real diversity of wildlife on and around City Island are birds, especially aquatic species. There are many varieties of duck; mallards, clue-winged teal, and cormorants. American white ibis are common, as are brown pelicans, snowy egrets, great blue herons, great white egrets, and several types of gull. An occasional bald eagle or red-shouldered hawk can be seen overhead.

<text>Negative FX was a hardcore punk band from Boston, formed in 1981. Though the band lasted only a short time, playing a total of five shows (six flyers exist), the band was well known for their involvement in the local straight edge scene of the early 1980s. Along with members of the bands DYS and SS Decontrol (SSD), Negative FX was part of the &quot;Boston Crew&quot;, a group of social friends who traveled around the country with SSD and other Boston hardcore bands.

Negative FX played fast and unmelodic hardcore punk that often featured shouted gang vocals on the songs&#x27; choruses, which was influential in the development of thrashcore. The band members consisted of Patrick Raftery on guitar, Rich Collins on bass, Dave Bass on drums, and high-profile vocalist Jack Kelly, who frequently went by the name of &quot;Choke&quot;. Kelly went on to form the bands Last Rights and Slapshot.

Negative FX released only one self-titled album, which was recorded in April and November 1982 at Radiobeat Studios in Kenmore Square, but was not released until 1984 on Taang! Records. It was rereleased on blue, red, clear and amber vinyl (all limited to approximately 500) by Taang! in 1989. In 2002, Belgian label Reflex/Wolfpack Records reissued the album under the name &quot;Discography &amp; Live&quot; with the addition of a live version of &quot;Might Makes Right&quot;, on black (limited to 1400), pink (limited to 100) and yellow (limited to 100) vinyl. Distortions Records issued the &quot;Government War Plans EP&quot; in 2003, consisting of early demos.

Successful punk rock band NOFX&#x27;s name is a reference to this band. Eric Melvin had listened to Negative FX&#x27;s one studio album, and when trying to come up with a name for his new band with Fat Mike, he suggested the name &quot;NO-FX&quot;. Fat Mike agreed on the name (later dropping the hyphen), noting that &quot;it was the best one so far&quot;.

<doc id="1287116" wikidata="Q519898" url="?curid=1287116" title="Mancur Olson">
<text>Mancur Lloyd Olson Jr. (; January 22, 1932 – February 19, 1998) was an American economist and political scientist who taught at the University of Maryland, College Park. His most influential contributions were to new institutional economics, and focused on the role played by private property, taxation, public goods, collective action, and contract rights in economic development.

==Early life and education==
Olson was born on January 22, 1932, in Grand Forks, North Dakota, to a family of Norwegian immigrants. He grew up on a farm near Buxton, North Dakota, next to the state border with Climax, Minnesota. Olson claimed that his given name, Mancur, was common throughout Scandinavian-immigrant communities in North America and was a variation of the Arabic name Mansoor.

Olson graduated from North Dakota State University in 1954, and was a Rhodes Scholar at University College, Oxford from 1954 to 1956, before earning a PhD in economics from Harvard in 1963. He also served in the U.S. Air Force for two years from 1961 to 1963.

==Career==
While serving in the U.S. Air Force, Olson became a lecturer in the Economics Department of the United States Air Force Academy from 1961 to 1963. He then became an assistant professor at Princeton University in 1963. Afterwards, he served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare for two years in Washington, D.C. In 1969, he joined the economics department of the University of Maryland, College Park, where he remained until his death.

==Family life and death==
Olson married his wife, Alison, in 1959, and the couple had three children. At the time of his death, he was a resident of College Park, Maryland.

On February 19, 1998, Olson, then 66 years of age, suddenly collapsed outside his office after returning from lunch. He never regained consciousness and died on the same day. He and his infant son are buried in the cemetery of his childhood church, Grue Norwegian Lutheran, near his family’s farm and hometown of Buxton, Traill County, North Dakota. The cause of death was later determined to be a heart attack.

==Legacy==

===Academic work===
In his first book, &quot;The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups&quot; (1965), he theorized that what stimulates people to act in groups is incentive; members of large groups do not act in accordance with a common interest unless motivated by personal gain (economic, social, etc.). While small groups can act on shared objectives, large groups will not work towards shared objectives unless their individual members are sufficiently motivated.

In 1982, he expanded the scope of his earlier work in an attempt to explain &quot;The Rise and Decline of Nations&quot; (1982). He argues that groups such as cotton farmers, steel producers, and labor unions have an incentive to form lobby groups and influence policies in their favor. These policies will tend to be protectionist, which will hurt economic growth; but because the benefits of such policies are concentrated, and their costs are diffused throughout the whole population, there will be little public resistance to them. As distributional coalitions accumulate, nations burdened by them will fall into economic decline. His work influenced the formulation of the Calmfors–Driffill hypothesis of collective bargaining.

In his final book, &quot;Power and Prosperity&quot; (2000), Olson distinguished between the economic effects of different types of government, in particular, tyranny, anarchy, and democracy. Olson argued that under anarchy, a &quot;roving bandit&quot; only has the incentive to steal and destroy, whilst a &quot;stationary bandit&quot;—a tyrant—has an incentive to encourage some degree of economic success as he expects to remain in power long enough to benefit from that success. A stationary bandit thereby begins to take on the governmental function of protecting citizens and their property against roving bandits. In the move from roving to stationary bandits, Olson sees the seeds of civilization, paving the way, eventually for democracy, which by giving power to those who align with the wishes of the population, improves incentives for good government. Olson&#x27;s work on the roving vs. stationary bandits is influential in analysis of the political and economic order structured in warlord states and societies.

===Policy work===
To help bring his ideas to the attention of policymakers, Olson founded the Center for Institutional Reform in the Informal Sector (&quot;IRIS Center&quot;), funded by USAID (United States Agency for International Development). Based at the University of Maryland, the Center sought to supply an intellectual foundation for legal and economic reform projects carried out by USAID in formerly communist states that were attempting to make the transition to market-driven democratic governments governed by the rule of law. It was particularly active in East and Central Europe and the former Soviet Union.

The Center also became actively involved in projects in South America, Africa, and Asia, where it became a proponent of judicial independence. It sponsored the first conference on corruption in francophone Africa in the 1990s, when it was a very sensitive subject. The IRIS Center continued to operate after Olson&#x27;s death, but was eventually folded into other programs at the University of Maryland.

To honor Olson&#x27;s many contributions, the American Political Science Association established the Olson Award for the best PhD dissertation in Political Economy. In 2013 the University of Maryland announced the creation of a new endowed professorship—the Mancur Olson Professor of Economics. Maryland Professor of Economics Peter Murrell was the first Mancur Olson Professor.

<text>Marco Camenisch (born 21 January 1952) is a Swiss anarchist and environmental activist.

== Biography ==
===Early life===
Camenisch was born on January 21, 1952, in Campocologno, Switzerland and raised in a middle-class home in canton Graubünden.

===Activism===
In the late 1970s, Camenisch was involved in local opposition to the nuclear power industry. In Switzerland, as in other countries, the movement against nuclear power plants utilized tactics of direct action: cutting down electrical pylons, sabotage against power stations, and actions against leaders of the nuclear industry.

On Christmas eve of 1979, Camenisch with René Moser sabotaged a power station belonging to NOK (Nordostschweizer Kraftwerke) at Bad Ragaz, St. Gallen with explosives, destroying two transformers and a power pole. The pair were arrested for the sabotage in January 1980 and after spending a year free on bail, the court of Canton in Chur and Graubünden sentenced Camenisch to 10 years in prison.

===Escape===

In December 1981, he escaped from Regensdorf prison near Zürich, along with 5 other prisoners. During the melée a prison guard was shot and killed, and another was seriously injured. Camenisch claimed he hadn&#x27;t been part of the group which committed the shootings. After the escape he spent 10 years in hiding. 

In 1989, Swiss federal police and media claimed he was responsible for the killing of Swiss border police officer Kurt Moser at Brusio.

=== Arrest in Italy ===

On November 5, 1991, Camenisch was stopped by Carabinieri on Cinquale di Montignoso road, along with fellow anarchist Giancarlo Sergianpietri. Camenisch produced a handgun and opened fire, wounding one of the soldiers. In the ensuing shootout, he was wounded in one leg and arrested. Two guns and six rudimentary bombs were found at his place. He was taken to Pisa hospital, where he remained for six months, and later at San Vittore prison infirmary in Milan. The Italian Court of Massa Carrara sentenced him to 12 years for assault and sabotage of electrical pylons. He served 9 of those years while in solitary confinement in a maximum-security prison.

=== Extradition to Switzerland ===
In April 2002, Camenisch was extradited to Switzerland and transferred to a prison in Pfäffikon near Zürich. In January 2003, after a hunger strike against the conditions of imprisonment he was suffering, he was transferred to a prison in Chur with better conditions. In 2002 the Swiss government transferred him back to Pfäffikon. In July 2004 he was sentenced to seventeen years in prison for the murder of Kurt Moser.

In November 2006 the Federal Supreme Court nullified this sentence on the basis that the sum of the two prison terms would exceed the maximum of twenty years set by Swiss law. On 13 March the sentence was therefore reduced to eight years.

Camenisch has maintained his political beliefs during his time in prison, and he has remained a political activist.

He was freed from prison on 10 March 2017, after 26 years.

<doc id="1287120" wikidata="Q3058576" url="?curid=1287120" title="Council of Ministers (Spain)">
<text>The Council of Ministers () is the main collective decision-making body of the Government of Spain, and it is exclusively composed of the Prime Minister, the deputy prime ministers and the ministers (22 as of 2024). Junior or deputy ministers such as the Secretaries of State are not members of the Council (although according to the Constitution they could be, if the Government Act included them, a constitutional provision that until today has not been used). The Monarch may also chair the Council when needed on the invitation of the Prime Minister.

The ministers are proposed by the Prime Minister and formally appointed by the King. There is no requirement for the Prime Minister nor the ministers to be MPs. The ministers are the heads of a ministerial department and receive the title of &quot;Minister&quot;. In addition to the ministers that are the head of a department, there may be ministers without portfolio, who are entrusted responsibility for certain government functions.

The Council is the main collective decision-making body of the government and the only one constitutionally recognized but ministers can also meet through other government bodies such as the Government Delegated Committees. The Delegated Committees are created by the Council and composed by ministers and secretaries of state which deal with minor issues that may affect more than one ministry.

The Secretary of the Council of Ministers is the Minister of the Presidency. It is regulated by Article 98 of the Spanish Constitution and by article 5 of the Government Act of 1997.

==History==

===Origins, 15th-18th century===
From the beginnings of the modern state and the centralization of power in the monarchs, the government was exercised by them through people of trust. The monarchs trusted them certain subjects and with which they made daily dispatches to deal with these matters. Over time, these trusted people who, on numerous occasions, received the title of ministers, were in conflict with the powers of other ministers and, to resolve these, they made collective meetings between various ministers and the monarchs. The Spanish monarchy has ruled most of its history —depending on the greater or lesser desire of the monarch to delegate its power— through Councils —Council of Castile, Council of the Indies, Council of Aragon, etc.— whose main tasks were those of to administer justice in the name of the monarchs and to advise the Sovereign in his work of government and with these the polysynodial regime was established.

With Charles I this regime reached its peak, especially with the creation of the Council of State in 1526, a council that dealt with the great problems of the monarchy and were their secretaries who had more power, i.e. the called Secretaries of State. The secretariat of the Council of State was unique between 1526 and 1567, double between 1567 and 1706 and unique again since this last year. Exceptionally, between 1630 and 1661 there was a third secretary in charge «of Spain, the Indies and adjacent islands, the coast of Barbary and everything indifferent».

Philip II ruled until 1567 with a single secretary and with two since that date, although he balanced the power between his two Secretaries of State and the other advisors and private secretaries. With the subsequent monarchs —Philip III, Philip IV and Charles II— the figure of the favourite () appeared, a kind of prime minister. It is at this time when the position of secretary of the Dispatch appears.

With Philip V and, by French influence, the Council of Dispatch was created with a few members. This members had the task of advise the monarch in his task of government and that displaced the Council of State in this task. During his reign many of the Secretaries of State and of the Dispatch appeared.

=== The Supreme State Board ===

The institution of the Council of Ministers as a collective body of government does not appear with such a name until its creation by King Ferdinand VII in 1823, however, prior to this, it is worth mentioning the Supreme State Board. The Supreme State Board was a collective body of government created by King Charles III on the advice of the Count of Floridablanca, which was attended by the Secretaries of State and the Dispatch and anyone they considered necessary to address the issues presented to them.

This Board was not properly a Council of Ministers because, as we have said, not only ministers but other authorities, such as the Councilors of State, could attend and, in addition, this body was limited by the Reserved Instruction, an articulated text that included the matters that could be discussed by the Board. The Board, created in 1787, did not have a long journey or developed the work for which Floridablanca promoted its creation and, only a few months later, the first criticisms appeared accusing the Count of Floridablanca of wanting to assume all the ministries powers through this body, to appoint the high officials of the Kingdom and thus gather in his person all the power.

The Royal Decree of 8 July 1787, which created the Board, it said:

With the fall of Floridablanca in 1792 and the arrival to the power of Aranda, this one influenced in the King Carlos IV to suppress the Supreme State Board and to return to the previous system with the Council of State like central organ of the Administration.

Briefly, with the return of King Ferdinand VII to the throne of Spain and the abolition of the Constitution of Cadiz, the king recovered the old Supreme Board by Royal Decree of 2 November 1815.

=== The Council of Ministers ===
After the experience during the Trienio Liberal, the Council of Ministers was officially created by King Fernando VII, who ordered by Royal Decree of 19 November 1823 that his Secretaries of State (&quot;Secretarios de Estado y del Despacho&quot;) should gather to form a body, which was to be called the Council of Ministers. In the meetings of this Council all matters of common interest would be discussed, and every Secretary would report about affairs under his responsibility and receive instructions from the King. The Secretary of State (or First Secretary of State) would act as Chief Minister and preside over the meetings when the King was absent.

The first meeting of the Council was on 22 November and to it were summoned the Minister of Justice, the Minister of War and the Minister of the Treasury and Navy.

This Council was directly and permanently submitted to the monarch, as it appears in the historical texts that show that between 28 December 1825 and 19 September 1826 it was suspended by direct orders of Ferdinand VII, while it was strengthened the Council of State. From the beginning of the Council of Ministers there were constant conflicts between the Secretaries of Dispatch of the Council and the secretaries of the Council of State because in many occasions the first one had to respond before the latter, a situation that shortly after ceased to re-establish the king, on the proposal of the Council of Ministers, the merely consultative structure originally held by the Council of State.

To understand the motives that the monarch had to create the Council, it is necessary to resort to the royal decree of December 1823 that establishes the &quot;bases on which the new Council of Ministers must walk,&quot; and these are:

The purpose, then, was to dismantle any trace of the constitutional period of the Liberal Triennium.

At the time of its creation, the Council of Ministers was composed of the five ministers —six when the Interior Minister was added— in addition to a secretary who, in the absence of this, it assumed the functions of secretary of the Council the Minister of Grace and Justice.

They used to meet once a week; later, it was extended to twice —Tuesdays and Saturdays— although depending on the circumstances, the hours could vary, as happened at the time of the uprising of Jorge Bessières that met daily or when the monarch pleased. Extraordinary meetings and the continual excuses of the ministers not to attend were also common, although the general norm was habitual attendance, as was not the case in other institutions of the monarchy. Likewise, various authorities that were called to issue reports or defend the files that were being processed could go to the Council, generally in the area of the Treasury and international relations. They were described in the minutes as &quot;assistants&quot;.

The place designed for its meetings and the most usual in its beginnings was the headquarters of the First Secretary of State, although with time it was the headquarters of the Secretariat of the Navy that assumed that role. It was also common that the Council met where the monarch was, as in the Royal Palaces of Aranjuez, San Lorenzo or La Granja.

After the death of King Ferdinand VII and during the regency of María Christina, in an attempt to win the support of the Liberals, the Queen Regent appointed Secretary of State to Martinez de la Rosa, who due to the tradition already created, received the title of President of the Council of Ministers with the approval of the Royal Statute and with this title, he has been considered the first real Prime Minister of Spain. It was precisely this statute, which for the first time constitutionalized the body of the Council of Ministers but without specifying their formation and powers.

Although the Royal Statute affirmed that the monarch freely appoints and separates the ministers, the parliamentary practice obliged the sovereign to elect the ministers among the members of the Cortes Generales who had the confidence of these ministers, in clear imitation of the European systems in which the Government should have the confidence of the Crown and Parliament. In the same way, the prerogatives that were granted to the monarch were actually exercised by his ministers.

In the first Council&#x27;s meetings of Martinez de la Rosa and Mendizábal the Queen Regent did not usually attend —although she was always informed of everything— and they met once or twice a week and with the ordinary assistance of the ministers —although during the premiership of Mendizábal many times the Councils were reduced to two members by the notable absences— in addition to the Secretary of the Council of Ministers, with Martinez de la Rosa to the Council also attended the members of the Government, senior administrative positions and military chiefs, mainly because of the War.

With the regency of General Espartero the political situation did not improve. The difficulties to form stable governments were insurmountable and the personality of Espartero —who wanted to exercise power himself— did not help much, in fact, all the ministers of prime minister Joaquín María López resigned at the same time because they had demanded that Espartero respected the principle of that the Monarch reign but does not rule and they said «that such healthy principles can not be realized, [ministers] believe in the obligation to resign their positions in the hands of Your Highness confident that their resignation will be admitted, which is based on the essential conditions of the representative government (...)». Espartero quickly appointed Álvaro Gómez Becerra as Prime Minister, something that did not please the Congress that ratified his support for the previous government.

After this situation began the uprisings against General Espartero and, in Barcelona, General Serrano proclaimed himself universal minister, ceased Espartero and appointed Joaquín María López as prime minister, who took this opportunity to lift the minority of Queen Isabella II. This measure was later ratified by the Cortes Generales.

With Narváez as Prime Minister and a council formed by six ministers, they prepared a reform project that would later be transferred to the Cortes for debate and that led to the Constitution of 1845. The typical political instability of the time soon appeared, with governments of less than 20 days to maximum of 9 months mainly for palace intrigues. With Narváez back in government —his third government— in October 1847, the ephemeral governments ended until 1851. His Council of Ministers carried out important reforms in the Administration and the Treasury, but the most important was to confront and dominate the events of 1848. The revolutions of this year affected Spain in a limited way thanks to the iron hand of the Council, coming to call it a &quot;necessary dictatorship&quot; since the government ruled with the Cortes dissolved and the constitutional guarantees suspended.

In the winter of 1851, Juan Bravo Murillo became President of the Council of Ministers, forming a council with a remarkable technical training devoted in depth to the art of government and administration, moving away from the military rather than political government of General Narváez. This Council carried out an important economic sanitation; prepared a new administration reform; and normalized relations with the Holy See through the Concordat of 1851. But, undoubtedly, the task with more resonance was the preparation of a draft constitutional reform, however this suffered the rejection of progressive deputies, most of the moderates and the Queen Mother herself, who still had great influence on her daughter. All this ended up causing the resignation of the government in December 1852.

With the fall of the Bravo Murillo government, political instability and ephemeral governments returned, lasting until the fall of the First Republic in 1874.

=== The Restoration ===

After the dethronement of Isabella II, the debates on the form of State, the regency of Serrano (1869-1871), the brief reign of Amadeo I (1871-1873), the republican experience (1873-1873) and the Serrano dictatorship (1874), a military coup took place and the Bourbon restoration started with Alfonso XII, son of Queen Isabella II, as King of Spain.

During this period the Constitution of 1876 was approved, a constitution sufficiently flexible so that all the ideologies coexisted under it and could make the necessary changes in favor of one or another ideology without altering the system. This constitution gave sovereignty to both the Monarch and the Cortes, returning to the principle that the Government should have the confidence of both the Crown and Parliament. Thanks to this flexibility, a two-party system is installed in Spain, which derives from the so-called between Cánovas and Sagasta agreed at El Pardo Palace, through which the liberal and conservative parties took turns in power. For politicians of the time, the need for stability allowed not necessarily attend the will of the electoral body, but ensure the proper functioning of constitutional bodies.

The new Constitution grants the Monarch the executive power delegating into his ministers and, although it is not mentioned explicitly in the constitution, the figure of the President of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister) acquires greater relevance and power, placing himself in the center as the true guiding center of the country&#x27;s administrative action. It is at this time when a true civil government is established, with small lapses of prime ministers of a military nature.

It is also not a period free of controversy, since a system like this was only possible with the help of the Ministry of the Interior which is traditionally in charge of supervising the electoral processes and which, at that time, was the one in charge to put in agreement to the political forces to agree the result of the elections. Nevertheless, this system gave the necessary stability to the country between 1875 and 1903. However, this system soon entered into a crisis with the internal fights between parties, the incipient dissolution of these and the appearance of new ones, such as the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party in 1879.

With the ascension to the throne of the young Alfonso XIII, there was a radical change in Spanish politics. The personality of the monarch to have a central role in decision-making was reflected in the first Council of Ministers, in which, the king read article 54.8 of the Constitution and as a comment he said to his ministers: «As you have just heard, the Constitution gives me the concession of honors, titles and greatness; that is why I warn you that the use of this right is completely reserved for me». To this the Duke of Veragua replied, that the same Constitution affirmed that those decisions should be countersigned by the ministers, a position that Prime Minister Sagasta did not defend and implying that the monarch&#x27;s argument prevailed. This reflects the characteristics that Spanish politics took, with a monarch with a personal power supported by the Armed Forces and the distribution of royal favors, as well as the cowardice of politicians to curb the king&#x27;s desire for power and his authoritarian personality.

The crisis of the system was evident, and in the next 21 years until the coup d&#x27;état of Primo de Rivera there were 33 governments, at an average of 8 months per government.

=== Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera ===

On 13 September 1923, the coup d&#x27;état of Primo de Rivera was held, ending with the approval of King Alfonso XIII and his appointment as head of government. With the arrival of Primo de Rivera to power a Military Directorate was established chaired over by him under the title of President of the Military Directorate —with full executive and legislative powers— and the office of President of the Council of Ministers and the own Council of Ministers were suppressed.

In December 1925, the Military Directory disappeared and a Civil Directory was constituted, recovering the positions of President of the Council of Ministers and Ministers of the Crown, as well as recovering the figure of the Vice President of the Council of Ministers, which had only been exercised by Joaquín María Ferrer between 1840 and 1841.

The most relevant of this period of civil government was the draft Constitution of 1929, which granted the monarch the ability to assist the Council of Ministers whenever he wished and chair over it should he attend; it had to approve the appointments and substitutions of the dismissals of the ministers of the Crown, although it was granted to the king the capacity to appoint ministers without portfolio.

This project did not prosper and Primo de Rivera ended up resigning and being replaced by another military, Lieutenant General Berenguer Fusté as Prime Minister, appointed as temporary until new elections were held to return the constitutional course to the country, but the local elections of 1931 eventually end up with the monarchy and the Second Republic was established.

=== Second Republic ===
With the arrival of the second republic and the approval of the Constitution of 1931, a parallel is established between the Government and the Council of Ministers, when it says in its article 86 that &quot;the President of the Council of Ministers and the Ministers constitute the Government&quot; and the figure of the President emphasizes that «he directs and represents the general policy of the Government» while the ministers «are responsible for the top direction and management of the public services assigned to the different ministerial departments». With this Constitution it can be affirmed that the Prime Minister ceases to be primus inter pares. As in the monarchical era, it was the head of the State who freely appointed the president of the Council, but now it was the President of the Council of Ministers who appointed his ministers, with the exception of Article 88 that empowered the President of the Republic to appoint ministers without portfolio, something that also included the draft Constitution of 1929.

The Constitution at no time established the mechanism of parliamentary confidence, since it was the President of the Republic who appointed the Prime Minister freely, although they did respond jointly to their actions before the Congress and, if the parliament expressly denied them confidence, the head of the State was forced to cease them. Likewise, Congress could censure the government or individually the ministers forcing them to resign if approved by an absolute majority.

Therefore, the Council of Ministers in the Republican era continued to maintain the double confidence of the monarchical tradition, and must have the confidence of the Cortes and the President of the Republic.

The Council of Ministers had the legislative initiative that it shared with the Cortes, it had regulatory power and it could legislate by delegation of Congress. In addition, the Council of Ministers in exceptional cases could give authority to the President of the Republic to legislate on legislative matters, this provisional legislation being that Congress could later reject it.

=== Dictatorship of Francisco Franco ===
On 18 July 1936 a part of the Republican army took up arms against the constitutional regime. On 24 July, the National Defense Board was created in Burgos, which assumed &quot;all the Powers of the State and legitimately represents the country before foreign powers.&quot; This body was organized in a collective way and took decisions jointly by decree. It was not until August of that year that Francisco Franco becames part of the Board.
In September 1936, Franco assumed all the power of the State, by means of a Decree of the Board of 29 September 1936.

After almost two years of war and the Republican side practically defeated, a true government was formed on the rebel side, with Franco at the head, with a Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Francisco Gómez-Jordana Sousa, as well as ten other ministers. This government was regulated by the Laws of the Central State Administration of 30 January 1938 and the Law of 8 August 1939 that restructured the Government.The first of the laws changes the name of the head of the Government to that of the President of the Government —a name that is maintained today— that was linked to the head of the State. This law does not mention the Council of Ministers, although in practice it was in force even though all the dispositions and resolutions of the head of the State had to be submitted to the deliberation of the latter. The second of the laws does mention the Council of Ministers to indicate that the head of the State could dictate resolutions without the prior deliberation of the Council in cases of urgency.

This Council of Ministers did not possess military authority, which was exercised directly by the dictator through the National Defense Board and the High Military Command. During this time, the Council behaved like a technical-administrative organ at the service of the dictator, which does not debate or decide big political questions.

However, after 1945, the Council of Ministers took greater relevance, especially after the departure from the government of the Falangist José Luis de Arrese. Between this date and 1950, the Franco regime suffered a clear international isolation which ended after the interested aid of the United States. Since then, Spain has entered the WHO and UNESCO, and signed agreements with the Holy See. Among all this, financial aid from the United States continued to arrive. With the new government of 1951, which included, among others, the opening and former ambassador in the Holy See, Joaquín Ruiz-Giménez or his right hand, Luis Carrero Blanco.

This new government transformed the Council of Ministers into a more political than technical-administrative body, due mainly to the good international situation for the regime and the economic boom of the country. From 1957 the so-called technocracy came to power by displacing the Falangists; they developed the Stabilization Plan of 1959 and carried out more advanced legislation in social matters, such as the 1958 labor agreements.

A before and after is marked after the approval of the Legal System and the State Administration Act (LRJAE) of 1957 that develops the principle of Unity of Administration and places the Council of Ministers as the supreme and central body of the Administration, regulating the Government under the name of Council of Ministers and equipping it with Delegated Committees of the Government to deal with minor issues between ministries. At that time the Secretary of the Council of Ministers was the Minister-Under Secretary of the Presidency.

In 1967, Franco brought to the Cortes the Organic Act of the State (LOE) that separated the figure of the head of State from that of the head of government, who led and on whom the Council of Ministers depended, and defined this Council as &quot;the body that determines the national policy, ensures the application of laws, exercises regulatory power and assists permanently the Head of State in political and administrative affairs&quot;, giving full regulatory authority to the government. The peculiarity of this law was that the President of the Government was appointed by the Head of State on the proposal of three candidates of the Council of the Kingdom (the private council of the dictator).

From this time the Council of Ministers had the most autonomy, mainly due to the poor health of the dictator. Six years after approving the LOE, Franco appointed Carrero Blanco as President of the Government, who appointed his own Cabinet. Carrero Blanco was assassinated soon after, and with Arias Navarro as Prime Minister, the more the dictator&#x27;s health worsened, the more power and influence the Council of Ministers had.

In short, throughout Franco&#x27;s dictatorship, he made use of the Council of Ministers as a legitimizing body and to avoid his own political wear. That is why he submitted to the Council even decisions in which only he was competent, such as pardons.

=== Current constitution ===
With the approval of the democratic Constitution of 1978, the figure of the Government was separated from the concept of the Council of Ministers, lasting until the approval of the Government Act of 1997. The Constitution, in its article 98.1 establishes that the Government consists of the «President, of the Vice Presidents where appropriate, of the Ministers and of the other members established by law.» This tagline «and of the other members that the law establishes» refers to the possibility of including the Secretaries of State in the government. This separates the concepts of Government from the concept of the Council of Ministers (that, as its name indicates, is the meeting only of the ministers). However the Government Act of 1997 did not use the powers granted by the Constitution to include the Secretaries of State. It only considers the Prime Minister and the ministers as members of the government, therefore reuniting the Government and Council of Ministers.

The current constitutional system is presidential; highlighting the Prime Minister as the preeminent head of government and the center of parliamentary confidence above all the other members of the Council. The President is the only member of Government who can propose a vote of confidence to Parliament, or present an appeal of unconstitutionality, among other powers. If the premier dies or ceases, the government ceases with him. This signals a return to the principles established in the Constitution of the Second Republic since the prime minister is not a simple &quot;primus inter pares&quot; (first among equals).

The parliamentary system obliges the government to have the confidence of the parliament at all times. If Congress censures the government on its own initiative then a prospective replacement candidate for Prime Minister must be nominated at the same time. If the censure motion carries, the replacement candidate is deemed to have the confidence of the Congress and automatically becomes the new Prime Minister. This constructive vote of no confidence was established by articles 113 and 114 of the Constitution; there have been four attempts, and the first successful vote was on 1 June 2018 when Mariano Rajoy was voted out in favour of Pedro Sánchez.

Regarding the election of the Prime Minister, unlike previous periods, the monarch does not appoint the head of the government. The role of the monarch is to nominate a candidate that the Congress of Deputies must approve or reject. If the candidate is approved, the monarch can appoint him. In the same way, it is the Premier who proposes to the monarch the appointment or cessation of the ministers. Since 1987, it is the Prime Minister by Royal Decree who decides how many ministries the Government has.

This does not mean that the ministers are mere hierarchical subordinates, because the Constitution itself in Article 98.2, when establishing the directive function of the premier, establishes that the president directs the government «notwithstanding the competence and direct responsibility of these [ministers] in their management».

== Meetings of the council ==

The Council of Ministers, as a general rule, meets weekly every Tuesday morning. Its meetings, from which minutes will be drawn up, may be deliberative and/or decision-making. The minutes will include, exclusively, the circumstances related to the time and place of its celebration, the list of attendees, the resolutions adopted and the reports presented. Therefore, the deliberations that the different members of the Government maintain, since these by law are of a secret nature, can not be collected.

The meetings of the Council are convened and chaired by the Prime Minister, though, in his absence, Deputy Prime Ministers take the responsibility to chair over the cabinet and it is the Premier who establishes the topics to be discussed. Also on exceptional occasions, the cabinet can be chaired by the King of Spain: in that event the meeting is solely consultative.

== Location of council meetings ==

Meetings of the Council of Ministers are held at the Council Building in Madrid. It is located at the Moncloa Palace complex, which includes the official residence of the Prime Minister and the headquarters of the government.

However, the Council of Ministers can meet in any city in the country. Some examples are the Council&#x27;s meetings in Barcelona in 1976 and 2018, the Council&#x27;s meeting in Palma de Mallorca in 1983, or the Council&#x27;s meetings in Seville in 1976, 2010 and 2018.

== Collaboration and support bodies ==
According to the Government Act of 1997, there are two bodies with the mission of collaborate or give support to the Council of Ministers. These are the General Commission of Secretaries of State and Undersecretaries and the Government Secretariat.

=== General Commission ===
The General Commission of Secretaries of State and Undersecretaries is an auxiliary body of the Council of Ministers composed by all the secretaries of state and undersecretaries of the different ministries. The General Commission has as purpose to study the matters that must to be dealt in the Council of Ministers.

The chairman of the Commission is the Deputy Prime Minister or the Minister of the Presidency if the first can not be present. The secretary of the Commission is the Under Secretary of the Presidency. The Solicitor General of the State shall also attend and those senior positions with the rank of Secretary of State or Under Secretary who are summoned by the President of the Commission by reason of the matter in question.

=== Government Secretariat ===
The Government Secretariat is the support body of the Council of Ministers, the Government Delegated Committees and the General Commission of Secretaries of State and Undersecretaries.

The Government Secretariat is responsible for assisting the Minister-Secretary of the Council of Ministers; conduct the calls of the members of the bodies it attends; collaborate with the Technical Secretariats of the Government Delegated Committees; guard the records and minutes of meetings; to collaborate in the technical quality of the norms approved by the Government and to ensure the correct publication of the dispositions and norms emanating from the Government that should be inserted in the Official State Gazette.

This body is part of the Ministry of the Presidency and currently is the General Technical Secretariat of the Ministry.

==Current council==


== Cabinet and Council ==

Although in the English-speaking countries the terms Cabinet and Council of Ministers may mean the same, in Spain they are not the same. The Council of Ministers is the main body of the executive power while the Cabinet is an auxiliary body of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, composed by the Moncloa Chief of Staff and several civil servants and advisers.

<text>Joseph Bolitho Johns ( February 1826 – 13 August 1900), better known as Moondyne Joe, was an English convict and Western Australia&#x27;s best-known bushranger. Born into poor and relatively difficult circumstances, he became something of a petty criminal robber with a strong sense of self-determination. He is remembered as a person who had escaped multiple times from prison.

== Biography ==
=== Childhood ===
Some say he was born in Cornwall but an online ANU source quotes him as being born in Wales, around 1826-27, and raised as a Protestant. He was baptised in the Parish Church at Wendron, married at Johnston Memorial Congregational church at Fremantle, and buried in the Anglican section of Fremantle Cemetery. Despite claims that he was Roman Catholic, there is no evidence for this and would be incredibly unusual in Cornwall. He was the third of three children of blacksmith Thomas Johns (1799–1833) and his wife Mary Bolitho (1804–1860). Joe was a tall man with black hair and hazel-coloured eyes, and it is likely that he contracted smallpox in his youth as, later, records describe him as &quot;pockmarked&quot;. His father died some time in 1833, and Johns and his brother took work as copper miners. In 1841 the family was living at Porkellis, Cornwall, but by 1848 Johns had migrated to Wales, taking work as an iron ore miner, probably at the Clydach Iron Works.

=== Prison ===
On 15 November 1848, Johns and an associate using the name William Cross, the pseudonym for the convict John Williams, were arrested near Chepstow for &quot;stealing from the house of Richard Price, three loaves of bread, one piece of bacon, several cheeses, and other goods&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Welshman 30/03/1849&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Arraigned at the Brecon Assizes on charges of burglary and stealing, the pair pleaded not guilty. On 23 March, they were tried at the Lent Assizes before Sir William Erle. Newspaper reports of the trial suggest that the pair gave an unexpectedly spirited defence, but Johns was abrasive and &quot;contravened the conventions of court procedure&quot;. The men were convicted and sentenced to ten years&#x27; penal servitude. W. J. Edgar (1990) observes that in several other cases brought before the same judge that day, guilty pleas to very similar charges resulted in sentences ranging from three weeks to three months.

Johns and Williams were to spend the next seven months working on a government work party in the local area, before being transferred to Millbank Prison. On 1 January 1850, they were transferred to Pentonville Prison to serve their mandatory six months of solitary confinement. The pair were transferred to Dartmoor Prison on 21 October 1851, but shortly afterwards Johns was transferred to the Woolwich prison hulk &quot;Justitia&quot;, probably for disciplinary reasons. When the &quot;Justitia&quot; was destroyed by fire, he was transferred to the &quot;Defence&quot;. About a year later, he boarded the prison ship &quot;Pyrenees&quot; for transportation to what was then the British penal colony of Western Australia to serve out the remainder of his sentence. In turn, Williams was transported to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land in March 1852.

=== Australia bound ===
&quot;Pyrenees&quot; sailed for Western Australia on 2 February 1853, and arrived in Fremantle on 30 April. In reward for good behaviour, Johns was issued with a ticket of leave on arrival, and on 10 March 1855 he received a conditional pardon. He then settled in the Avon Valley, one of the most rugged and inaccessible places in the Darling Range. The Aboriginal name for the area was &quot;Moondyne&quot;. Johns made a living by partly fencing the springs in the area, and trapping escaped stock and horses. Often a reward was offered for the return of such animals.

In August 1861, Johns caught an unbranded stallion and branded it with his own mark. This was effectively horse stealing, and when the police heard of this they arrested him at their first opportunity. The horse was taken as evidence, and Johns was placed in the Toodyay lockup. Sometime during the night, Johns broke out of his cell, and stole the horse once more, taking also the local magistrate&#x27;s brand-new saddle and bridle. He was caught the next day but, while on the run, he had killed the horse and cut his brand out of the hide, thus destroying the evidence. Consequently, he received only a three-year sentence for jail-breaking, whereas a typical sentence for horse stealing was more than ten years.

While Johns was serving his sentence, there was a rash of convict escapes and attempted escapes, but Johns remained well behaved. His good behaviour earned him a remission on his sentence, and he was released on a ticket of leave in February 1864. He then found work on Henry Martin&#x27;s farm in Kelmscott. In January 1865, a steer named &quot;Bright&quot; belonging to William Wallace was killed, and Johns was accused of the deed. He was arrested on 29 March, found guilty on 5 July, and sentenced to ten years&#x27; penal servitude. Johns was to protest his innocence of this crime for the rest of his life. He was determined not to serve what he felt was an unjust sentence and, in early November, he and another prisoner absconded from a work party. They were on the run for nearly a month, during which time they committed a number of small robberies. It was during this time that Johns first adopted the nickname &quot;Moondyne Joe&quot;. They were finally caught east of York by a party of policemen that included Tommy Windich, an Aboriginal tracker. For absconding and for being in possession of a firearm, Johns was sentenced to twelve months in irons, and transferred to Fremantle Prison.

=== Escape ===
In April 1866, Johns sent a petition to the Chief Justice, and received four years off his sentence. This was apparently unsatisfactory to him for, in July, he received a further six months in irons for trying to cut the lock out of his door. Early in August, he succeeded in escaping again. After cutting off his irons, he met up with three other escapees, and together they roamed the bush around Perth, committing a number of robberies and narrowly escaping capture on a number of occasions. Near the end of the month, one of the gang was captured by police. Realising that the gang could not elude the police forever, Johns formulated a plan to escape the colony by travelling overland to the colony of South Australia. This would be a long and arduous journey through extremely arid land, and the gang would have to be very well equipped if it were to stand any chance of success. On 5 September, Johns equipped his company by committing the biggest robbery of his career, stealing supplies and equipment from the Toodyay store of an old enemy, James Everett. The gang then started travelling east along the explorer Charles Hunt&#x27;s established route. Their tracks were discovered by police on 26 September, about east of York. A team of police then set out after them, and they were captured on 29 September 1866 at Boodalin Soak, about north-west of the present-day site of the town of Westonia, approximately north-east of Perth.

=== Hard labour ===
As punishment for escaping and for the robberies committed while on the run, Johns received five years&#x27; hard labour on top of his remaining sentence. Extraordinary measures were taken to ensure that Johns did not escape again. He was sent to Fremantle Prison, and kept in the yard with his neck chained to the iron bar of a window, while a special &quot;escape-proof&quot; cell was made for him. The stone-walled cell was lined with jarrah sleepers and over one thousand nails, and was almost air-proof and light-proof. Johns was kept in the cell on a bread and water diet, with only one to two hours of exercise a day. In early 1867, due to his diminishing health, Johns was set to work breaking stone in the open air but, rather than permit him to leave the prison, the acting comptroller-general ordered that the stone be brought in and dumped in a corner of the prison yard, where Johns worked under the constant supervision of a warder. Governor John Hampton was so confident of the arrangements, he was heard to say to Johns: &quot;If you get out again, I&#x27;ll forgive you&quot;. However, the rock broken by Johns was not removed regularly, and eventually a pile grew up until it obscured the guard&#x27;s view of him below the waist. Partially hidden behind the pile of rocks, he occasionally swung his sledgehammer at the limestone wall of the prison.

On 7 March 1867, Johns escaped through a hole he had made in the prison wall. Despite an extensive manhunt, no sign of him was found, and he would not be recaptured for nearly two years. He did not return to any of his old haunts, and he committed no crimes, so the authorities received very little information about him. Also, many convicts were encouraged by Johns&#x27; audacious escape, and a number of escapes were attempted in the following months, so that he was quickly forgotten.

On 25 February 1869, Johns tried to steal some wine from the cellars at Houghton Winery. By chance, the owner had been helping with a police search, and afterwards invited a group of police back to the vineyard for refreshments. When the owner entered the cellar, Johns assumed that he was discovered, and made a dash for the door into the arms of the police. He was returned to prison, sentenced to an additional 12 months, half to be in separate confinement, for absconding. On 22 March 1869, he was sentenced to an additional four years in irons for breaking and entering. Johns made at least one more attempt to escape, attempting in February 1871 to create a key for his cell in the carpenter&#x27;s workshop, but was unsuccessful. Eventually, in April 1871, Comptroller General Wakeford heard from Johns of Hampton&#x27;s promise. After verifying with Superintendent Lefroy that those words were spoken, Wakeford informed the current governor, Frederick Weld, who agreed that further punishment would be unfair. Johns was given a ticket of leave in May 1871.

=== Later life ===
The remainder of Johns&#x27; life consisted of periods of good behaviour punctuated by occasional minor misdemeanors and brief jail terms. In January 1879, he married a widow named Louisa Hearn, and they spent some time prospecting for gold near Southern Cross. In 1881, while exploring the countryside around Karridale, he discovered Moondyne Cave.

=== Final years and death ===
In 1893, Johns&#x27; wife Louisa died at the age of 40, and the death affected him greatly. Years after, he began acting strangely, and was eventually found to be mentally ill. He died of senile dementia in the Fremantle Lunatic Asylum (now the Fremantle Arts Centre building) on 13 August 1900, and was buried in Fremantle Cemetery. His tombstone bears the word &quot;rhyddid&quot;, meaning &quot;freedom&quot; in Welsh.

==Cultural references==

===Literature and film===
While Moondyne Joe was bushranging in 1869, an Irish political prisoner named John Boyle O&#x27;Reilly was working in a convict road party near Bunbury. Although it is very unlikely that O&#x27;Reilly knew Moondyne Joe, he must have heard many stories of his exploits. In March 1869, O&#x27;Reilly escaped and was rescued by an American ship. After his arrival in the United States, he wrote a novel about convict life called &quot;Moondyne: An Australian Tale&quot;, whose central character was called Moondyne Joe. The book is presented as fiction, and neither the character nor the plot bears much resemblance to the life of Joseph Johns.

In 1913, O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s novel was made into a movie entitled &quot;Moondyne&quot;. Directed by W. J. Lincoln, it starred George Bryant, Godfrey Cass and Roy Redgrave.

Randolph Stow wrote a humorous children&#x27;s book, &quot;Midnite: The Story of a Wild Colonial Boy&quot;, in 1967 which told the story of an Australian bushranger based on the life and exploits of Moondyne Joe and a Queensland bushranger Captain Starlight.

In 2002, Cygnet Books published &quot;The Legend of Moondyne Joe&quot;, a work of juvenile fiction written by Mark Greenwood and illustrated by Frané Lessac. The book won the award in the Children&#x27;s Books category at the 2002 Western Australian Premier&#x27;s Book Awards.

In 2012, Fremantle Press published a postmodern interpretation of Moondyne Joe&#x27;s life, &quot;The Ballad of Moondyne Joe&quot;, including poems and prose by John Kinsella and Niall Lucy.
===In song and verse===



In 1982 a musical/play was written by Roy Abbott and Roger Montgomery of the Mucky Duck Bush Band and performed by Mucky Duck and friends at various venues.

=== Memorials ===
A railway siding on the Eastern Goldfields Railway in Johns&#x27; area of operations in the Avon Valley has been named &quot;Moondyne&quot;, most likely after the man rather than the area.

=== Festivals ===
On the first Sunday of May, the township of Toodyay celebrates the life and times of Moondyne Joe by holding the Moondyne Festival. This festival takes place in the main street with street theatre, market stalls, demonstrations and the entire town is generally transported back to earlier years.

<doc id="1287130" wikidata="Q16195497" url="?curid=1287130" title="Johnny Dawes">
<text>Johnny Dawes (born 9 May 1964) is a British rock climber and author, known for his dynamic climbing style and bold traditional climbing routes. This included the first ascent of &quot;Indian Face&quot;, the first-ever route at the E9-grade. His influence on British climbing was at its peak in the mid to late-1980s.

==Climbing career==
Dawes&#x27; climbing career splits into an initial period pre-1986 where he focused on gritstone in the Peak District, which was suited to his unique climbing style (e.g. &quot;Gaia&quot;, and &quot;End of the Affair&quot;). From 1986, Dawes focused on Wales and on a diverse range of rock, from the slab climbing routes in the slate quarries of Llanberis (e.g. &quot;The Quarryman&quot;, &quot;The Very Big and the Very Small&quot;, and &quot;Dawes of Perception&quot;), to the face routes on the quartzite cliffs of Gogarth North Stack (e.g. &quot;Conan the Librarian&quot;, and &quot;Hardback Thesaurus&quot;), and the rhyolite mountain crags of Clogwyn Du&#x27;r Arddu (e.g. &quot;Indian Face&quot;). Dawes is remembered for intimidating traditional climbing routes, in the legacy of Pete Livesey, Ron Fawcett and John Redhead, and less for sport climbing routes, unlike his contemporaries Jerry Moffatt and Ben Moon.

Dawes came to prominence outside of the rock climbing world with his 4 October 1986 ascent of &quot;Indian Face&quot;, the first E9-graded traditional rock route in Britain, and at the time, considered to be the hardest and most dangerous traditional route in the world. The guidebook described it as &quot;A pitch of such appalling difficulty as to be almost beyond the realms of human comprehension&quot;. In a 2011 interview, Dawes said: &quot;As you set off it&#x27;s best to consider yourself already dead. You just do it&quot;. The climb, and rare repeats, are the subject of a 2006 documentary, &quot;Johnny Dawes and the Story of Indian Face&quot;.

In 1993, Dawes was a member of an expedition funded by the Mount Everest Foundation to attempt the first ascent of &quot;The Shark&#x27;s Fin&quot; on Meru Peak in Gangotri Himalaya, India; a dropped boot led to a forced descent from 6,000 meters to avoid frostbite. An autobiographical account of his climbing, &quot;Full of Myself&quot;, was published in 2011.

===Style===
Dawes had a uniquely dynamic technique, leaping between very small holds, and also for his levels of balance and foot-control that enable him to climb extreme-grade routes without using his hands. Welsh climber George Smith said: &quot;His climbing seemed choreographed rather than constructed in a gym. If there&#x27;s perfect pitch for movement, he has it&quot;. Aspects of his unique technique was captured in the 1986 climbing film, &quot;Stone Monkey&quot;, considered one of the best-ever films in the genre, as well as the 2015 climbing series, &quot;No Handed Climbing&quot;, and other &quot;no-hands&quot;, and &quot;no-feet&quot; videos.

His unorthodox climbing style, coupled with his reputation for a keen intellect and an artistic or bohemian bent, made Dawes an enigmatic and mercurial character in British climbing. His writing has been called &quot;quirky, convoluted, and often obscure&quot;, and a tendency to &quot;speak in riddles&quot; earned him the titles of &quot;nutty professor&quot;, and of &quot;mad genius&quot; from some commentators. His approach also made it difficult to secure commercial sponsorship, with Dawes saying in a 2019 interview, &quot;I wasn’t supported by the climbing industry because I didn&#x27;t fit the commercial template&quot;.

==Legacy==
Dawes is widely considered a legend of British rock climbing, and one of the most influential figures in British rock climbing history. Over a career spanning the early-1980s to the early-1990s, he pushed the technical level of traditional climbing with routes that were unprecedented both in terms of difficulty, and the style in which they were climbed. In 2012, &quot;The Guardian&quot; called Dawes a &quot;defining figure&quot; and wrote that: &quot;His climbs were rated among the very hardest in the world, test pieces of both balance and nerve, some with a reputation for terrible danger&quot;. Some of his routes are still so intimidating that they are rarely repeated, and several feature in climbing films focused on Dawes (e.g. &quot; 80s Birth of Extreme&quot;) and his routes (e.g. &quot;Hard Grit&quot;, &quot;Quarrymen&quot;).

==Personal life==
Dawes was born in 1964 in Birmingham, into a wealthy family, whose parents were part of the 1960s British motor racing scene. His education at the Uppingham School was a difficult one, with Dawes suffering from periods of depression and bullying.

Dawes rejected the career path of his contemporaries into third-level education and then a likely London-based career, choosing instead to obsess on climbing, telling &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;I was in a shut-off state, to a certain extent. When I was doing something dangerous it would wake me up&quot;.

In 2011, Dawes was diagnosed with hypothyroidism, which he called &quot;depressing and heavy&quot;; by 2018, treatment enabled him to climb at .

<doc id="1287132" wikidata="Q7717795" url="?curid=1287132" title="The Big Snooze">
<text>The Big Snooze is a 1946 Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon planned by Bob Clampett and finished by Arthur Davis, who were both uncredited as directors. It features Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd, voiced by Mel Blanc and Arthur Q. Bryan.

Its title was inspired by the 1939 book &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, and its 1946 film adaptation, also a Warner release.

==Plot==
Bugs and Elmer are in the midst of their usual hunting-chasing scenario. After Bugs tricks Elmer into running through a hollow log and off a cliff three times, Elmer angrily quits because he feels that the writers never let him catch the rabbit. He tears up his Warner Bros. cartoon contract and walks off the set to devote his life to fishing, stunning Bugs, who piteously asks him to reconsider.

During a relaxing fishing trip, Elmer falls asleep. Bugs observes Elmer&#x27;s nap, remarks that the dream he notices Elmer is having — that of a classic log and saw, representing snoring — is &quot;a heavenly dream&quot;. Then, Bugs decides he had &quot;better look into this&quot;, and downs a sleeping pill. He dreams he is inside Elmer&#x27;s dream, in a boat crooning &quot;Someone&#x27;s Rocking My Dreamboat&quot;. He decides to use Nightmare Paint to disrupt the &quot;serene scene&quot;.

Within Elmer&#x27;s dreamland, Bugs creates unsettling situations: Elmer appears nearly nude, wearing only his derby hat and a strategically placed &quot;loincloth&quot; consisting of a laurel wreath. Next, in a musical parody of &quot;The Campbells Are Coming&quot;, and a visual parody of the Pink Elephants on Parade sequence from the Disney film &quot;Dumbo&quot; (1941), Bugs creates a situation where &quot;miwwions and biwwions of wabbits&quot; are dancing over Elmer while Bugs&#x27; voice is heard singing, &quot;The rabbits are coming. Hooray! Hooray!&quot; When Elmer asks where they are all coming from, Bugs replies, &quot;From me, Doc,&quot; and is shown literally multiplying them from an adding machine.

Looking for another way to torment Elmer, Bugs consults the book &quot;A Thousand and One Arabian Nightmares&quot;, exclaiming, &quot;Oh, no! It&#x27;s too gruesome!&quot; before peeking over the book to cheerfully tell the audience, &quot;But I&#x27;ll do it!&quot; Elmer realizes what Bugs has in mind, pleading, &quot;No, no! No, not that! Not that, please!&quot; as Bugs ties him to railroad tracks, just as &quot;the Super Chief&quot; (Bugs in an Indian chief&#x27;s war bonnet, leading a conga line of baby rabbits) crosses over Elmer&#x27;s head.
Elmer chases Bugs through a surreal landscape, and Bugs inquires, &quot;What&#x27;s the matter doc, ya cold? Here, I&#x27;ll fix dat.&quot; Before Elmer can react, Bugs dresses him in drag, (dress, wig, lipstick) transforming the inept hunter into a woman with an hourglass figure who resembles Rita Hayworth. Bugs inspects his handiwork, then lifts the backdrop to reveal a trio of literal wolves in Zoot suits, lounging by the sign at Hollywood and Vine, who catcall at Elmer.

As Bugs and Elmer fall off a cliff, Bugs drinks some &quot;Hare Tonic (Stops Falling Hare)&quot; and screeches to a halt in mid-air, while the dream Elmer continues to careen toward earth, finally crash-landing into the real Elmer&#x27;s snoozing body. He wakes up with a start, exclaiming, &quot;Ooh, what a howwible nightmare!&quot;

Elmer dashes back to the cartoon&#x27;s original background, pieces his Warner contract back together, and agrees to continue. The chase through the log begins anew. Bugs faces the audience in a closeup, finishing with the catchphrase from the &quot;Beulah&quot; character on the radio show Fibber McGee and Molly, &quot;Ah &quot;

==Reception==
Animation historian Jerry Beck writes, &quot;In &quot;The Big Snooze&quot;, Clampett, who has drawn up imaginary worlds several times before, outdoes himself with the imagery in Elmer&#x27;s nightmare. The abstract rabbits foreshadow the minimalism of United Productions of America (UPA) cartoons, and the surreal landscape combining clouds, yellow skies, and musical notes is the closest we&#x27;ll come to visualizing a Looney Tunes acid trip.&quot;

==Notes==
Contrary to popular belief, &quot;The Big Snooze&quot; was left unfinished upon Bob Clampett&#x27;s departure. According to historian Milton Gray, Arthur Davis completed the short but didn&#x27;t understand Clampett&#x27;s humor, so he had to finish what he had and scrapped the rest. Clampett would not see the completed film decades later and admitted to Gray that some things in the short were done very different from his original intention.

== History ==

=== StarLauro Cruises ===
In 1988 Gianluigi Aponte, founder of Mediterranean Shipping Company cargo shipping company, decided to enter the cruise industry and purchased the &quot;Achille Lauro&quot; from Flotta Lauro Line. He retained &quot;Lauro&quot; in the company name in honour of his mentor, naming the new cruise line StarLauro Cruises. The original Lauro Lines () was originally founded in Naples, Italy by Achille Lauro in the 1940s.

In 1990 Mediterranean Shipping Co. purchased the &quot;Monterey&quot; to sail for their StarLauro Cruises brand. The ship retained her original name that she had had since sailing with Matson Lines. Both the &quot;Monterey&quot; and &quot;Achille Lauro&quot; would sail under the StarLauro Cruises banner into the early 1990s. In November 1994 the &quot;Achille Lauro&quot; caught fire off the coast of Somalia while &quot;en route&quot; to South Africa, with 979 passengers and crew aboard, two of whom died during the evacuation.

StarLauro line went on to acquire the &quot;Enrico C&quot; from Costa Cruises, renaming the ship &quot;Symphony,&quot; and the former &quot;Cunard Princess&quot;, renaming the ship &quot;Rhapsody&quot; to the fleet.

=== MSC Cruises ===
In 1995, StarLauro Cruises was rebranded as MSC Cruises, with the livery changed from the blue funnel star logo to a white funnel with the MSC logo.

In 1997 MSC purchased the &quot;Atlantic&quot; from Premier Cruise Lines, and renamed the ship &quot;Melody&quot;.

In the early 2000s, MSC initiated a rapid expansion program, and placed its first new build orders with Chantiers de l&#x27;Atlantique shipyard, for 65,000-ton ships. Based on a similar design to the French yard&#x27;s platform for Festival Cruises, the two-ship order started the aggressive expansion of the cruise line. The line&#x27;s first new build, the &quot;MSC Lirica&quot;, debuted in 2003. The &quot;Lirica&quot; also became the first MSC ship to be christened by Sophia Loren, a tradition that has continued for all but one of the company&#x27;s new builds. The &quot;Lirica&quot; was followed by sister ship MSC &quot;Opera&quot; in 2004.

In 2004, MSC Cruises acquired the fairly newly built &quot;European Vision&quot; and &quot;European Stars&quot; from the bankrupt Festival Cruises, renaming the ships and .

In 2006 the first of the four Muscia Class debuted, also built at STX France. The &quot;MSC Musica&quot; was followed by the , , and the final, slightly modified, in 2010.

In 2015, MSC Cruises announced that the four &quot;Mistral&quot; class ships had undergone renovation under the Renaissance Programme.

In July 2018, the company announced that it would build a second cruise terminal at PortMiami for its &quot;World&quot;-class cruise ships as an expansion of its North American program. It was scheduled to be completed in October 2022.

In October 2018, MSC announced an order for four luxury ships of 64,000 gross tons each. These ultra-luxury vessels were to be based on the cruise line&#x27;s luxury concept, the MSC Yacht Club.

In January 2019, MSC Cruises unveiled the world&#x27;s first virtual personal cruise assistant — ZOE, an artificial intelligence device designed by Harman International. It is currently featured on &quot;MSC Bellissima&quot; and &quot;MSC Grandiosa&quot;, and will be featured on future new builds upon their delivery.

In mid-2020, MSC Cruises suspended most (or all) of their operations for over six months during the COVID-19 pandemic. On 7 January 2021, MSC announced it would restart cruises with the &quot;MSC Grandiosa&quot; and &quot;MSC Magnifica&quot; in the Mediterranean. Passengers were initially limited to residents of the Schengen Area.

In June 2021, MSC announced a new luxury subsidiary brand named Explora Journeys, with four vessels planned, beginning with the &quot;Explora I&quot;.

In March 2022, MSC Cruises signed a multi-year deal with Formula One to become their official cruise partner. They were the title sponsor of the 2023 Belgian Grand Prix.

In January 2023, MSC Cruises announced a new multi-year partnership agreement with the New York Knicks. The deal gets MSC promotion during Knicks home games, including LED signage, virtual-on-court signage, and the opportunity to serve as the presenting partner during in-game t-shirt tosses.

In August 2024, &quot;Shipping Italy&quot; reported rumors that MSC was in talks with Meyer Turku to build a class of four ships with a gross tonnage of 270,000, which would make it bigger than any other cruise ship at the time.

== Ocean Cay MSC Marine Reserve ==
In December 2015, MSC Cruises signed a 100-year lease for the private island of Ocean Cay in the Bahamas to develop the land for an exclusive island experience. The site had previously been used to mine white Aragonite sand for decades. After the original owners abandoned the 95 acre island, the land had to be restored to remove all of the old mining equipment, with MSC Cruises committing $200 million for the project, involving restoration and conversion of the island into a private resort.

The restoration required the work of many scientists to bring the area back into a functioning marine habitat. Once the Bahamian government granted the site marine reserve status, the project was officially named the Ocean Cay MSC Marine Reserve and was set to open in mid-November 2019. However, weather delays pushed the date to 5 December 2019.

<text>Lilian Helen Bowes Lyon (23 December 1895 – 25 July 1949) was a British poet.

==Biography==

Born 23 December 1895 at Ridley Hall, Northumberland. She was the youngest daughter of the Honourable Francis Bowes-Lyon, son of the 13th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. Her mother was Lady Anne Lindsay, daughter of the 25th Earl of Crawford. Lilian was a first cousin of Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, who later became Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

During the First World War, Bowes Lyon helped at Glamis Castle (owned by her uncle) which became a convalescence home for soldiers. Her brother Charles Bowes Lyon was killed in the war on 23 October 1914, inspiring her poem &quot;Battlefield&quot; which was later published in &quot;Bright Feather Fading&quot;.

After the Great War, Bowes Lyon studied for a time at the University of Oxford and then moved to London. She was independently wealthy. In 1929, she met the writer William Plomer CBE and through him, Laurens van der Post. She published two novels, &quot;The Buried Stream&quot; (1929) and &quot;Under the Spreading Tree&quot; (1931) but thereafter focused on poetry. Bowes Lyon published six individual collections with Jonathan Cape and a &quot;Collected Poems&quot; in 1948. Her &quot;Collected Poems&quot; contains an introduction by C. Day-Lewis, who noted the influences of Emily Dickinson, Hopkins and Christina Rossetti. Her verse appeared in many periodicals and anthologies including &quot;The Adelphi&quot;, &quot;Country Life&quot;, &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, &quot;The Listener&quot;, &quot;The London Mercury&quot;, &quot;The Lyric&quot; (USA), &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;Orion&quot;, &quot;Punch&quot;, &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;Time and Tide&quot; and &quot;Poetry&quot; (USA).

During the Second World War, Bowes Lyon moved to the East End of London, where she used the Tilbury Docks unofficial air raid shelter and assisted with nursing the injured.

She had several amputations due to thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger&#x27;s disease), losing toes, a foot, her lower legs and eventually both her legs below her hips. She returned to her home in Kensington and continued to write poetry despite the thromboangiitis obliterans beginning to affect her hands. These poems, found amongst William Plomer’s papers at University of Durham, were published in &quot;Uncollected Poems&quot; by Tragara Press.

She died on 25 July 1949.

<text>Shahid Rafique Malik (; born 24 November 1967) is a British technology and media industry chairman and former politician. A member of the Labour Party, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Dewsbury from 2005 to 2010.

The son of the mayor of Burnley, Malik studied business at Durham University. Prior to his election to parliament, Malik worked in the urban development, communities and education sectors. Elected at the 2005 general election, Malik and Sadiq Khan were the first British-born Muslims to be elected to parliament.

In 2007, Malik became Britain&#x27;s first Muslim government minister. Initially responsible for the Department for International Development from 2007 to 2008, he subsequently served at the Ministry of Justice from 2008 to 2009 and Department for Communities and Local Government from 2009 to 2010. In his last ministerial role, he led the British government&#x27;s efforts in fighting extremism; overseeing race, faith, and community cohesion; developing the Thames Gateway; and managing the Fire and Rescue Service. He lost his seat at the 2010 general election.

==Early life==
Malik was born in Burnley, Lancashire, in 1967. His father Rafique Malik was a district councillor between 1976 and 2006 and a mayor of Burnley, having emigrated from Pakistan in the 1960s. He attended Barden High School and Burnley Sixth Form Centre before studying Business Studies at the South Bank Polytechnic in London and later attending Durham University. Malik is one of seven siblings.

==Pre-parliamentary career==
After graduating, Malik initially worked with the East Lancashire Training and Enterprise Council in a business development capacity and later served as chief executive of the Pakistan Muslim Centre in Sheffield and the Haringey Regeneration Agency. He was national chair of the voluntary sector body Urban Forum from 1999 to 2002. He served as a commissioner for racial equality from 1998 to 2002 and an equality commissioner for Northern Ireland from 1999 to 2002. He also served as an independent governor of Sheffield Hallam University from 1995 to 2001 and as vice-chair of the United Nations body, UNESCO UK, from 2000 to 2003.

In 2000, Malik was elected as the first non-white member of the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party. He was re-elected each year until 2005 when he stood down after being elected as an MP. Malik sought selection in several seats including Leeds Central and Tottenham. In 2002 he had hoped to be selected in his home town of Burnley where Peter Pike had indicated he was standing down. However, the National Executive Committee decided that the Constituency Labour Party should have an all-women shortlist. He then stood for selection in Brent East after Labour lost the 2003 by-election but was left off the shortlist despite having gained the most nominations in the selection process.

In June 2001, Malik was arrested and allegedly beaten by police during racially motivated riots in Burnley. He said he had been trying to stop the violence and told the BBC he had been arrested by &quot;very hyped-up&quot; police. &quot;The riot shields were smashed in my face, causing four to five stitches above the eye, a black eye, lacerations to the arm, bruises on the back of the head, on the body and on the legs.&quot; On leaving Burnley General Hospital Malik said: &quot;No recriminations. This incident should not stereotype all police officers&quot;. No charges were brought by Lancashire Police and Malik was offered an apology. In April 2003, Malik won a public apology and &quot;substantial&quot; libel damages after being wrongly accused of throwing bricks during the riots in the &quot;Lancashire Evening Telegraph&quot; on 17 January 2002. Malik&#x27;s lawyer told the High Court in London: &quot;At the time referred to in the article, he was acting as a mediator and peacemaker in a volatile situation following disturbances in Burnley.&quot;

==Parliamentary career==

=== 2005 general election ===
In 2004 Malik was selected as the Labour candidate in Dewsbury for the 2005 general election. Labour saw a 6% drop in its vote nationally in 2005, and despite a 4.2% swing to the Conservatives in Dewsbury, Malik comfortably retained the seat for Labour with a majority of 4,615 ahead of Sayeeda Warsi. Upon his election, Malik was one of the first British-born Muslims to become an MP.

At the 2005 &quot;House Magazine&quot; Awards, he was awarded the best Maiden Speech among the one hundred plus new MPs elected in 2005. In February 2006, he was runner-up in the Channel Four News awards in the &#x27;Rising Star&#x27; category. Upon election, Malik was appointed to the Home Affairs Select Committee. He also served on the Environmental Audit Select Committee until the cabinet reshuffle of May 2006 when he was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the then Minister of State for Schools Jim Knight. He served as an international monitor for the Palestinian Presidential elections in 2005 and Parliamentary elections in January 2006.

===Race and community cohesion issues===
Soon after his election to the House of Commons in 2005, Malik became one of the public faces of Muslim leadership in the UK and a leading voice in the battle with Islamic extremism in Britain. In the government reshuffle of 9 June 2009, Malik was given ministerial responsibility for issues of race, faith and community cohesion. In 2008, he was made an honorary Doctor of the University of Bradford for his contributions as Member of Parliament and, in particular, in recognition of the distinctive role he has played in working towards community cohesion and in striving for racial harmony.

===Terrorism and extremism===
Just two months after Malik was elected to the House of Commons, it was revealed that the leader of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, Mohammad Sidique Khan, came from his Dewsbury constituency. Malik described the bombings as &quot;the most profound challenge yet faced by the British Muslim community&quot;. He said: &quot;Condemnation is not enough and British Muslims must, and I believe are prepared to, confront the voices of evil head on.&quot;

Later Malik confronted the issue in an article for &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper. He wrote: &quot;Yes, foreign policy causes anger among many British Muslims but this does not in itself cause terrorism. Unquestionably, the lethal ingredient is a twisted, perverted interpretation of Islam whereby you can legitimately kill yourself and other innocent people, and you will go to Heaven.&quot; He concluded that: &quot;For British Muslims the fight against extremism is not just for the very soul of Islam but for the freedoms we enjoy as Britons.&quot;

Malik found controversy in February 2007 when he wrote, again in &quot;The Times&quot;, that the Muslim Council of Britain should &quot;stop whingeing and show leadership.&quot; Referring to their decision not to play a part in Holocaust Memorial Day, Malik wrote: &quot;Its flawed moral leadership places the MCB alongside the likes of the BNP leader, Nick Griffin, as nonattendees.&quot;

===Muslim veil row===
In October 2006 Malik garnered national attention when he spoke out in support of the decision to suspend, and later sack, a Muslim teaching assistant from Dewsbury for refusing to remove her veil in the classroom. Aishah Azmi, 24, was asked to remove her niqab veil after pupils found it hard to understand her during English language lessons. The school said she could wear the veil outside the classroom. Malik said: &quot;In schools the top priority has got to be the education of our children... I believe the education authority has bent over backwards to be accommodating and has been extremely reasonable and sensible in the decision it has come to.” &quot;There is no religious obligation whatsoever for Muslim women to cover themselves up in front of primary school children.&quot;

In June 2009 Malik spoke out against comments made by Nicolas Sarkozy after the French President declared the burqa was &quot;not welcome&quot; in France. Sarkozy said: &quot;The burqa is not a sign of religion, it is a sign of subservience.&quot; Malik responded publicly by saying: &quot;It is not the job of government to dictate what people should or should not wear in our society – that is a matter of personal choice.&quot;

&quot;There are no laws stating what clothes or attire are acceptable and so whether one chooses to wear a veil or burqa, a miniskirt or goth outfit is entirely at the individual&#x27;s discretion.&quot;

===Parliamentary cleaners&#x27; rights===
Malik placed an early day motion (EDM 434, 2005), which attracted 178 MPs signatures and led to the first picket and strike in the Houses of Parliament and eventually to improved pay and conditions for the cleaners of Parliament. EDM 434 stated: That this House values the cleaners who maintain high standards of service to Parliament; believes the parliamentary cleaners should be treated with respect and that it is wrong that, despite the widespread concern over their pay and conditions of employment, their pay has only increased from the national minimum wage of £4.85 per hour to £5 per hour; is concerned that the parliamentary cleaners only enjoy 12 days&#x27; paid holiday and have no company sick pay or pension; believes the time has come to end this sorry state of affairs; and urges the parliamentary authorities to reach agreement with the two contractors on making available the necessary resources to ensure that cleaners earn the London living wage.

=== 2010 general election ===
At the 2010 general election Malik lost his seat in the House of Commons to Simon Reevell of the Conservative Party. There had been significant boundary changes in his constituency which he felt had counted against him. Malik commented that the changes &quot;brought in 26,000 extra Tories&quot; from rural areas, including Denby Dale and Kirkburton. In his speech on election night, Malik also accused the independent candidate, Khizar Iqbal, of being &quot;brought forward not to win but to make sure that I lost&quot;. Iqbal had been supported by anti-sleaze campaigner Martin Bell.

==Ministerial career (2007–2010)==

===International Development minister===
Malik&#x27;s first and longest ministerial role was as International Development minister where his roles included: conflict, humanitarian affairs and security; globally development programmes apart from Sub-Saharan Africa; UK civil society; Asian and Inter-American Development Banks; Caribbean Development Bank; Asia, MENA, South America and Europe development; and aid effectiveness. Malik was responsible for the UK&#x27;s largest global aid programmes including in India, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh as well as the Middle East and North Africa, the rest of Asia, South America and Europe. He was also the UK&#x27;s Aid Effectiveness Minister working to ensure that the impact of aid was maximised, and gave evidence to the Parliament&#x27;s International Development Committee on the issue.

In his role as the UK Minister responsible for Humanitarian Affairs, Conflict and Security Operations he had responsibility for overseeing the response to humanitarian emergencies both natural and man-made. For example, it covered disasters such as Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh Cyclone Nargis in Burma; and the Pakistan earthquake, as well as man-made challenges, which meant supporting the work in Afghanistan, Iraq as well as for example UNRWA, UNDP, UNICEF, WHO etc.

Some of the individual initiative&#x27;s in countries were in partnership with other countries and were relatively sizeable for example he signed a £90m maternal and new born health programme in Pakistan which was designed to save the lives of an estimated 30,000 women and some 350,000 children.

Malik was involved in the transition of Nepal out of civil war into an inclusive democracy. In this role he acted as an honest broker engaging with the Maoists leader Chairman Prachanda and the seven party alliance including PM Koirala. Other troubled areas that Malik engaged with included Darfur. In addition, Malik&#x27;s focused his efforts on the Far East with visits and support to Vietnam and Indonesia.

He signed the UK&#x27;s first ten-year partnership agreement in the Middle East with the government of Yemen. He also served as an observer to both Palestinian Parliamentary and Presidential elections.

In terms of UK civil society he was responsible for the distribution of £120 million per year to small NGOs as well as large ones such as the CAFOD, Red Cross, Oxfam, Action Aid, Christian Aid and Islamic Relief etc. He launched the UK&#x27;s Youth volunteering schemes and others that linked the UK with the developing world and co-chaired the DFID/Trade Union Congress International Development Forum.

===Communities and Local Government minister===

As Communities and Local Government minister, Malik&#x27;s role included covering: preventing extremism; community cohesion and faith; race migration; the Thames Gateway; Olympics legacy; and Fire and Rescue Services. 

Malik was responsible for ensuring the £9 billion Olympic legacy investment had a beneficial impact on the regeneration of East London for the next twenty years. He also oversaw work with major businesses such as Land Securities PLC and helped initiate the dredging of the Dubai Ports World&#x27;s £1.8 billion UK investment. He dealt with local authorities and private sector organisations to develop the Thames Gateway project and was responsible for the appointments of board members on the Olympic Park Legacy Company. He also chaired the Thames Gateway Strategic Partnership which was made up of the council leaders, CEOs and other agencies involved in the project.

Malik founded an award which was to be presented by the Prime Minister of the day known as the Heroes of the Holocaust award. The award was given (sometimes posthumously) to British non-Jews who had risked their lives or given their lives to save Jews and other persecuted groups from the Nazis. Gordon Brown was the first Prime Minister to present the Award which consists of a silver medallion inscribed with the words &quot;In the Service of Humanity&quot;.

===Libel claim===
On 6 October 2006 Malik launched a libel case against both &quot;The Dewsbury Press&quot; editor Danny Lockwood and former Conservative councillor Jonathan Scott over a letter by Mr Scott criticising Labour&#x27;s tactics following Scott&#x27;s defeat at the Kirklees council elections in May 2006. Malik believing the material amounted to an accusation of racism. The defending newspaper suggested the case was attack on freedom of speech and a petition was presented to the Prime Minister protesting against Malik&#x27;s legal action. The petition was dismissed.

In a trial at the High Court, despite the country&#x27;s most senior Libel Judge, Lord Justice Eady, ruling in favour of Mr Malik giving him victory on three of the four defences that the Press newspaper, Lockwood and Scott had put forward against Mr Malik&#x27;s defamation claim, the case ended in a mistrial due to the jury&#x27;s inability to arrive at a majority of at least 10 out of 12 on the fourth defence. A retrial was averted after an agreed statement was published vindicating Malik. In the statement, Scott stated &quot;I am happy to make clear that my letter was never intended to accuse Malik of orchestrating gangs of thugs or playing the race card. This was an interpretation some people placed upon my letter and subsequent article, an interpretation with which I disagreed&quot;. Lockwood said, &quot;We want to make it clear that we never accused Shahid of any impropriety whatsoever during the elections&quot;. Malik said, &quot;I am very pleased that after a discussion with Danny Lockwood, he has been able to give me the assurances I required&quot;.

===Problems at US airports===
On 25 October 2007, while on Government business, Malik was stopped and searched by United States airport security staff at Dulles Airport in Washington D.C. Malik said of the incident: &quot;The abusive attitude I endured last November I forgot about and I forgave, but I really do believe that British ministers and parliamentarians should be afforded the same respect and dignity at USA airports that we would bestow upon our colleagues in the Senate and Congress. Obviously, there was no malice involved but it has to be said that the USA system does not inspire confidence.&quot;

===BBC Gaza War Appeal===
Malik criticised the BBC&#x27;s decision not to broadcast an appeal by the Disaster and Emergencies Committee to help raise millions of pounds for people in need of food, medicines and shelter following Israel&#x27;s three-week assault on the Palestinian territory. Malik warned that the Corporation&#x27;s decision would be seen around the world as &#x27;one which inflicts still further misery on the beleaguered and suffering people of Gaza&#x27;.

===Tackling extremism===
Malik said the £45million-a-year &quot;Prevent&quot; strategy would work in deprived white areas rather than concentrating on Muslim youths. Former Government adviser Paul Richards criticised the move, saying: &quot;There is a real danger that if ministers relax the focus on Muslim youth, then it dilutes efforts to tackle terrorism&quot;. Former Shadow Home Secretary David Davis accused Malik of having &quot;watered down the policy&quot;. Malik said Prevent, which includes measures like helping mosques to spot the early signs of extremism in vulnerable youngsters, was too focused on the Muslim community. He added: &quot;You speak to any Muslim on the street anywhere in this country and they will say they are as opposed as you and I are to extremism, to terrorism ... But the frustration is that they are constantly linked with terrorism as a community as a whole&quot;. He went on: &quot;It is not just about the Muslim, it is actually about everybody in our society having a role to play and we cannot dismiss or underestimate the threat from the far right&quot;.

===MPs&#x27; expenses===
Malik claimed £185,421 in parliamentary expenses for 2006, the highest amount claimed by any MP. Some £163,000 of this was used for staff and office etc. while the rest some £22,110 was claimed for personal use as part of his &#x27;staying away from main house&#x27; allowance (ACA). 183 other MPs claimed exactly the same amount and in 2007/08 he again claimed the maximum personal ACA allowance as did 142 other MPs. Following Thomas Legg&#x27;s audit of MPs expenses spending limits on eligible items were retrospectively lowered thus meaning that 468 MPs being were forced to make repayments. Malik repaid £1,300. The investigation further ordered that Malik apologise in writing to the House &quot;for breaching the rules of the House when he was a Member of Parliament and for his failure while still a member to respond sufficiently promptly to the Commissioner&#x27;s investigation&quot;. It noted Malik had failed &quot;to recognise his personal responsibility&quot; to respond thus making the situation &quot;more serious.&quot; A spokesman for Malik said the claim had previously been &quot;approved twice by the parliamentary authorities and subsequently audited as eligible.&quot;

On 15 May 2009, Malik stepped down as justice minister in order to allow the Prime Minister&#x27;s independent adviser on ministerial interests, Philip Mawer, to investigate accusations in The Daily Telegraph that he had breached the Ministerial Code by accepting preferential rent on his office and home. However, the inquiry concluded that he was in fact paying the market rent and Mawer cleared him of any breach. On 9 June, Malik rejoined the government as Communities and Local Government minister. After a further inquiry by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Malik also was cleared of parliamentary rules. On receiving the news Malik said: &quot;I have now been cleared of breaching the ministerial code of conduct by the ministerial standards adviser Sir Philip Mawer, cleared of any abuse of expenses by a parliamentary review conducted by the Department of Resources, and now finally cleared of abusing office expenses by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards John Lyon. Today&#x27;s outcome represents the end of a 12-month nightmare and I would like to thank all those family, friends and constituents who have stood by me and kept the faith – we have today all been vindicated.&quot;

===Racist hate material===
Malik and his staff regularly had to intercept abusive and racist communications sent to his offices in Westminster and Dewsbury. In June 2008 Malik acted against YouTube after supporters of the far-right posted a 39-second video clip warning him not to &quot;mess with the big boys&quot;, cutting from a still of the BNP leader, Nick Griffin, to a shot of Malik covered in blood. The video was removed from the site following a further complaint from the Equality and Human Rights Commission.

In December 2009, a 55-year-old man from Woodley, Berkshire pleaded guilty under the Malicious Communications Act of 1988, of sending an indecent or grossly offensive email to Malik for the purpose of causing distress or anxiety. He was fined £200.

===Anthrax terror alert===
In December 2009 an envelope containing suspicious white powder was sent to Malik&#x27;s office at the House of Commons, triggering an anti-terrorist investigation. Comments written on the envelope suggested it had been sent by a supporter of the far-right. The substance was later found to be harmless.

==Personal life and family==
Although over a hundred MPs employed family members in their offices, Malik was found to be the only MP to have employed his father, who was paid between £13,566 to £25,195 per year from the taxpayer-funded MP&#x27;s Staffing Allowance fund. Failure to initially disclose this information was later referenced in Malik&#x27;s use of expenses investigation.

<doc id="1287137" wikidata="Q849186" url="?curid=1287137" title="Brazilian literature">
<text>Brazilian literature is the literature written in the Portuguese language by Brazilians or in Brazil, including works written prior to the country&#x27;s independence in 1822. Throughout its early years, literature from Brazil followed the literary trends of Portugal, gradually shifting to a different and authentic writing style in the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, in the search for truly Brazilian themes and use of Brazilian forms.

Portuguese is a Romance language and the sole official language of Brazil. Lyrically, the poet Olavo Bilac, named it &quot; &quot;(...) desconhecida e obscura./ Tuba de alto clangor, lira singela,/ Que tens o trom e o silvo da procela,/ E o arrolo da saudade e da ternura!&quot; &quot;, which roughly translates as &quot;(...) unknown and obscure,/ Tuba of high blare, delicate lyre,/ That holds the frill and the hiss of the tempest/ And the singing of the saudade and of the tenderness!&quot;

Brazil&#x27;s most significant literary award is the Camões Prize, which it shares with the rest of the Portuguese-speaking world. As of 2016, Brazil has eleven recipients of the prize. Brazil also holds its own literary academy, the Brazilian Academy of Letters, a non-profit cultural organization pointed in perpetuating the care of the national language and literature.

Brazilian literature has been very prolific. Having as birth the letter of Pero Vaz de Caminha, the document that marks the discovery of Brazil, the country&#x27;s literature has encompassed several significant writers. Major figures include novelists Machado de Assis, Guimarães Rosa, Jorge Amado, Clarice Lispector and Graciliano Ramos; poets such as João Cabral de Melo Neto, Mário de Andrade, Carlos Drummond de Andrade, Vinicius de Moraes, Ferreira Gullar and Manuel Bandeira; dramatists like Nelson Rodrigues and Augusto Boal, and literary critics and theorists as Antonio Candido and Otto Maria Carpeaux, among others.

==Colonial period==

One of the first extant documents that might be considered Brazilian literature is the &quot;Carta de Pero Vaz de Caminha&quot; (Pero Vaz de Caminha&#x27;s letter). It is written by Pero Vaz de Caminha to Manuel I of Portugal, which contains a description of what Brazil looked like in 1500. Journals of voyagers and descriptive treatises on &quot;Portuguese America&quot; dominated the literary production for the next two centuries, including well-known accounts by Jean de Léry and Hans Staden, whose story of his encounter with the Tupi Indians on the coast of São Paulo was extraordinarily influential for European conceptions of the New World.

A few more explicitly literary examples survive from this period, such as Basílio da Gama&#x27;s epic poem celebrating the conquest of the Guarany Missions by the Portuguese, and the work of Gregório de Matos, a 17th-century lawyer from Salvador who produced a sizable amount of satirical, religious, and secular poetry. Matos drew heavily from Baroque influences such as the Spanish poets Luis de Góngora and Francisco de Quevedo.

Neoclassicism was widespread in Brazil during the mid-18th century, following the Italian style. Literature was often produced by members of temporary or semi-permanent academies and most of the content was in the pastoral genre. The most important literary centre in colonial Brazil was the prosperous Minas Gerais region, known for its gold mines, where a thriving proto-nationalist movement had begun. The most important poets were Cláudio Manuel da Costa, Tomás António Gonzaga, Alvarenga Peixoto and Manuel Inácio da Silva Alvarenga, all of them involved in an uprising against the colonial power. Gonzaga and Costa were exiled to Africa as a consequence.

==Romanticism==
Neoclassicism lasted for an unnaturally long time, stifling innovation and restricting literary creation. It was only in 1836 that Romanticism began influencing Brazilian poetry on a large scale, principally through the efforts of the expatriate poet Gonçalves de Magalhães. A number of young poets, such as Casimiro de Abreu, began experimenting with the new style soon afterward. This period produced some of the first standard works of Brazilian literature.

The key features of the literature of the newborn country are exaggerated affect, nationalism, celebration of nature and the initial introduction of colloquial language. Romantic literature soon became very popular. Novelists like Joaquim Manuel de Macedo, Manuel Antônio de Almeida and José de Alencar published their works in serial form in the newspapers and became national celebrities.

Around 1850, a transition began, centered on Álvares de Azevedo. Azevedo&#x27;s short story collection &quot;Noite na Taverna&quot; () and his poetry, collected posthumously in &quot;Lira dos Vinte Anos&quot; (), became influential. Azevedo was largely influenced by the poetry of Lord Byron and Alfred de Musset. This second Romantic generation was obsessed with morbidity and death.

At the same time, poets such as Castro Alves, who wrote of the horrors of slavery (&quot;Navio Negreiro&quot;), began writing works with a specific progressive social agenda. The two trends coincided in one of the most important accomplishments of the Romantic era: the establishment of a Brazilian national identity based on Indian ancestry and the rich nature of the country. These traits first appeared in Gonçalves Dias&#x27; narrative poem &quot;I-Juca-Pirama&quot;, but soon became widespread. The consolidation of this subgenre (&quot;Indianism&quot;) is found in two famous novels by José de Alencar: &quot;The Guarani&quot;, about a family of Portuguese colonists who took Indians as servants but were later slain by an enemy tribe, and &quot;Iracema&quot;, about a Portuguese shipwrecked man who lives among the Indians and marries a beautiful Indian woman. &quot;Iracema&quot; is especially lyrical, opening with five paragraphs of pure free-style prose poetry describing the title character.

==Realism==

The decline of Romanticism, along with a series of social transformations, occurred in the middle of the 19th century. A new form of prose writing emerged, including analysis of the indigenous people and description of the environment, in the &quot;regionalist&quot; authors (such as Franklin Távora and João Simões Lopes Neto). Under the influence of Naturalism and of writers like Émile Zola, Aluísio Azevedo wrote &quot;O Cortiço&quot;, with characters that represent all social classes and categories of the time. Brazilian Realism was not very original at first, but it took on extraordinary importance because of Machado de Assis and Euclides da Cunha.

===Machado de Assis===
Usually appointed as the greatest Brazilian writer of all times, Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis (1839–1908) is also the most important writer of Brazilian Realism. Born in Rio de Janeiro City (by the time, imperial capital of Brazil), he was the natural son of a half-black wallpainter and a Portuguese woman, whose only education, besides literacy classes, was the extensive reading of borrowed books.

Working as typesetter at a publishing house, he was soon acquainted with most of the world&#x27;s literature and became fluent in English and French. In his early career he wrote several best-selling novels (including &quot;A Mão e a Luva&quot; and &quot;Ressurreição&quot;) which, despite their overzealous Romanticism, already show his vivacious humour and some of his pessimism towards the conventions of society.

After being introduced to Realism, Machado de Assis changed his style and his themes, producing some of the most remarkable prose ever written in Portuguese. The style served as the medium for his corrosive humour and his intense pessimism, which was very far from the plain conceptions of his contemporaries.

Machado&#x27;s most crucial works include:
* &quot;Memórias Póstumas de Brás Cubas&quot; (&quot;The Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas&quot;), the fictional autobiography of a recently deceased man, written by himself &quot;from beyond&quot;. It is entirely anti-Romantic and ridicules the society of Rio de Janeiro of the time. This book contains one of the most pitiless sentences about love ever written: &quot;Marcela amou-me durante quinze meses e onze contos de réis; nada menos&quot;. (Marcela loved me for fifteen months and eleven thousand réis; nothing less.)
* &quot;Dom Casmurro&quot; purports to be the autobiography of a lonely man who has left his wife and his only son after enjoying years of happy conjugal life. The novel is famous in the Portuguese-speaking world for its analysis of a (possible, but never proven or admitted) case of adultery.
* &quot;Quincas Borba&quot;
* &quot;O Alienista&quot;, the short story about a psychiatrist who founds a hospital for the mentally ill in a small town and later engages in profound investigations on the nature and the cure of mental illness, greatly upsetting the town&#x27;s lifestyle.

Machado was also a minor poet, writing mostly casual poetry of extraordinary correctness and beauty. His reputation as a novelist has kept his poetry in print, and recent criticism has regarded it better than that of many of his contemporaries.

== Pre-Modernism ==

The period between 1895 and 1922 is called Pre-Modernism by Brazilian scholars because, though there is no clear predominance of any style, there are some early manifestations of Modernism. The Pre-Modern era is curious, as the French school of Symbolism did not catch on and most authors of Realism still maintained their earlier styles and their reputations (including Machado de Assis and poet Olavo Bilac). Some authors of this time were Monteiro Lobato, Lima Barreto, Simões Lopes Neto and Augusto dos Anjos.

===Euclides da Cunha===
A writer highly influenced by determinism, Cunha was always tormented by his family problems (he was killed by his wife&#x27;s lover) and had to face political opposition because of his opinions. As a freelance journalist working for &quot;O Estado de S. Paulo&quot; he covered the Canudos War—a popular revolt with some egalitarian and Christian-fundamentalist traits that took place in Bahia in 1895-97. His stories, together with some essays he wrote about the people and the geography of the Brazilian Northeast, were published in a thick volume called &quot;Os Sertões&quot; (&quot;Rebellion in the Backlands&quot;).

In his work, Cunha put forward the revolutionary thesis that the Brazilian state was a violent and foreign entity, rejected (but often tolerated) by the vast majority of the illiterate and dispossessed population, some of whom preserved beliefs and behaviours that had not changed in a thousand years or more. He discovered, for instance, that Sebastianism was then present in the Brazilian North-East and that many medieval Portuguese rhymes, folk-tales and traditions were still kept by the coarse people of the &quot;sertões&quot;. This population did not accept secularism, the Republican government and, especially, justice or peace.

His trilogy Os Sertões is composed of three parts titled &quot;The Land&quot;, &quot;The Man&quot; and &quot;The fight&quot;. Such organization of the book reinforces the idea that the environment where a man was born, the social aspects of his residence and the man&#x27;s culture may define what he will become. This principle is known as determinism, a way of thought that deeply influenced Brazilian literature during the mid- and late 19th century and the early 20th century.

== Modernism ==
Modernism began in Brazil with the Week of Modern Art, in 1922. The &quot;1922 Generation&quot; was a nickname for the writers Mário de Andrade (&quot;Paulicéia Desvairada&quot;, &quot;Macunaíma&quot;), Oswald de Andrade (&quot;Memórias Sentimentais de João Miramar&quot;), Manuel Bandeira, Cassiano Ricardo and others, all of whom combined nationalist tendencies with interest in European modernism. Some new movements such as surrealism were already important in Europe, and began to take hold in Brazil during this period.

=== Mário de Andrade ===
Mário de Andrade was born in São Paulo. He worked as a professor and was one of the organizers of the Week of Modern Art. He researched Brazilian folklore and folk music and used it in his books, avoiding the European style. His Brazilian anti-hero is Macunaíma, a product of ethnical and cultural mixture. Andrade&#x27;s interest in folklore and his use of colloquial language were extremely influential.

=== Oswald de Andrade ===
Oswald de Andrade, another participant in the Week of Modern Art in 1922, worked as a journalist in São Paulo. Born into a wealthy family, he travelled to Europe several times. Of the 1922 generation, Oswald de Andrade best represents the rebellious characteristics of the modernist movement. He is the author of the &quot;Manifesto Antropófago (Cannibal Manifesto)&quot; (1927), in which he says it is necessary that Brazil, like a cannibal, eat foreign culture and, in digestion, create its own culture.

===30s generation===
After the modernist critique there was a generation of writers which actually &quot;regressed&quot; in terms of &quot;modernist&quot; ideas of experimentation, and which instead focused on social criticism. In literary criticism however they are mostly regarded as a development within modernism and grouped within the term &quot;Geração de 30&quot;(30s generation).

Jorge Amado, one of best-known of modern Brazilian writers, tried with his novels to approximate his works to a proletarian literature, he himself was a member of the communist party which defended Socialist realism at the time.

Rachel de Queiroz, and José Lins do Rego were other important writers of this generation.

== Post-Modernism ==
What defined Brazilian modernism were two main traits: experiments in language and an enhanced social consciousness, or a mix between the two - as was the case with Oswald de Andrade, who was briefly attracted towards the communist movement. The reaction to modernism, then, assumed the form of a mix between its most salient trait, the use of more formal literary language (as was the case of the so-called &quot;generation of 1945&quot;, whose twin hallmarks were, firstly, the highly physical poetry of João Cabral de Melo Neto, who opposed Carlos Drummond de Andrade&#x27;s poetic modernism, and secondly the sonnets - on both the Italian and English model - of the early Vinicius de Moraes), followed by varying doses, according to the author considered, of subjectivism, political conservatism and militant Catholicism.

Two writers from that &quot;school&quot; that were published after the 1950s are without a doubt already inside the canon of Brazilian literature: Clarice Lispector, whose existentialist novels and short stories are filled with stream-of-consciousness and epiphanies, and João Guimarães Rosa, whose experimental language has changed the face of Brazilian literature forever. His novel &quot;Grande Sertão: Veredas&quot; has been compared to James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; or Alfred Döblin&#x27;s &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot; and featured in the Bokklubben World Library list of 100 best novels of all time. João Guimarães Rosa is considered by many to be the greatest Brazilian writer.

Following the wake of conservative subjectivism inaugurated by the militantly Catholic novelists-cum-polemicists Octavio de Faria, Lúcio Cardoso, Cornélio Penna and Gustavo Corção, Nelson Rodrigues made his career as a playwright and sports journalist. His plays and short stories - the latter mostly originally published as newspaper &quot;feuilletons&quot; - chronicled the social mores of the 1950s and 1960s; adultery and sexual pathologies in general being a major fixation of his. His sports writing describes the evolution of football into the national passion of Brazil. He was heavily critical of the young leftists who opposed the military dictatorship after the 1964 coup; for that he was penned as right-wing and conservative. For a time heavily pro-dictatorship, he had to suffer the tragic fate of having one of his sons being tortured and incarcerated for belonging to an underground guerrilla organization.

== Contemporary ==
Contemporary Brazilian literature is, on the whole, very much focused on city life and all its aspects: loneliness, violence, political issues and media control. Writers like Rubem Fonseca, Sérgio Sant&#x27;Anna have written important books with these themes in the 1970s, breaking new ground in Brazilian literature, up until then mostly having dealt with rural life.

New trends since the 1980s have included works by authors such as Caio Fernando Abreu, João Gilberto Noll, Milton Hatoum, Bernardo Carvalho, João Almino, Adriana Lisboa, Cristovão Tezza and Paulo Coelho.

Poets such as Ferreira Gullar and Manoel de Barros are noted within literary circles in Brazil, the former had been nominated for the Nobel Prize.

In recent years, &quot;marginal literature&quot; has risen to prominence with authors and poets such as Sérgio Vaz and Ferréz making appearances at important events like Festa Literária Internacional de Paraty, Flipside and Bienal do Livro de São Paulo. Other poets such as Adélia Prado, Elisa Lucinda, Luis Alexandre Ribeiro Branco, are among the contemporary poets.

<text>MSC Armonia is a &quot;Lirica&quot;-class cruise ship owned and operated by MSC Cruises. Originally built in 2001 for, the now defunct, Festival Cruises as MS &quot;European Vision&quot;, she has been operating for MSC Cruises since 2004. At 58,600 gross tons, she can accommodate 2,065 passengers in 783 cabins and 760 crew members.

== History ==
===As &quot;European Vision&quot; ===
As &quot;European Vision&quot;, she was chartered for the 27th G8 summit (20–22 July 2001) in Genoa, Italy as a secure location to house world leaders. Terrorism fears were high leading up to the 11 September attacks on the World Trade Centre. Al Qaeda was believed to be considering Genoa as a target. Although the ship was protected by a phalanx of anti-terrorism units including helicopters and missile launchers, U.S. President George W. Bush stayed at a dockside hotel instead.

=== As &quot;MSC Armonia&quot; ===
&quot;MSC Armonia&quot; has cruised around the Mediterranean Sea and the Eastern Atlantic. On 10 April 2018, &quot;MSC Armonia&quot; struck a dock at the port in Roatán. Damage to the ship was minor. After repairs were made to the ship, Honduran Port State Control authorities cleared the ship to continue her journey to Belize. No injuries to the passengers and crew on board were reported. The ships&#x27; homeport was in Havana until December 2018. She was re-located to Miami, offering cruises to Cuba and, later, to the Caribbean. In November 2020, she was moved to Tampa, Florida as homeport for the first time and sailed to the Caribbean.

====COVID-19 pandemic====
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the CDC reported as early as 22 April 2020, that at least one person who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, was symptomatic while on board.

The COVID-19 pandemic forced fleet redeployments and &quot;MSC Armonia&quot; was moved to Miami and continued sailing from there through 2021.

On 15 December 2023, a passenger fell overboard and was never found.

<doc id="1287143" wikidata="Q12129064" url="?curid=1287143" title="The Mouse-Merized Cat">
<text>The Mouse-Merized Cat is a 1946 Warner Bros. cartoon in the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series, directed by Robert McKimson. It is a sequel to 1945&#x27;s &quot;Tale of Two Mice&quot;, with the Abbott and Costello characterizations (&quot;Babbit and Catstello&quot;) cast as mice. A 1942 cartoon, &quot;A Tale of Two Kitties&quot;, cast Abbott and Costello as cats and introduced Tweety Bird. They are voiced by Tedd Pierce and Mel Blanc respectively. This cartoon marks the final appearances for Babbit and Catstello during the Golden age of American animation.

==Plot==
The cartoon opens in outer space, and moves in slowly on the planet Earth, the United States, and a fictional state called &quot;Mouseachewsetts.&quot; The camera continues to move closer, to an overhead view of Fluger&#x27;s Delicatessen, wedged in between two skyscrapers. The camera pans the interior of the deli, finally coming to Catstello waiting patiently at the entrance of a mouse hole. He addresses the camera and audience: &quot;I thought you&#x27;d never get here.&quot; He alerts Babbit that the people/audience are here, but Babbit is angry. Catstello failed to gather food as directed, because he fears the cat.

After much resistance, Babbit hypnotizes Catstello and turns him, in turn, into Bing Crosby (voiced by Richard Bickenbach), Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Durante, Rochester (which is removed from Cartoon Network in the United States) and a chicken. Satisfied that his hypnotic powers work, Babbit then hypnotizes Catstello into believing he is a dog. He sends Catstello out to chase the cat away.

At first, Catstello&#x27;s barking frightens the cat, who hides under a trash bin. But Catstello picks up the bin, and the cat is shocked to see Catstello, rather than a dog. Catstello comes out of his trance and flees back into the mouse hole, where Babbit hypnotizes him again. Catstello runs out barking to confront the cat, but the cat, with a hypnosis book, undoes Babbit&#x27;s spell and Catstello flees back to Babbit. Then a battle begins between Babbit and the cat for control of Catstello. Like a ball in a tennis match, Catstello bounces back and forth several times between the hypnotic powers of Babbit and the cat.

Finally, Catstello produces two hand mirrors that reflect the hypnotic beams at Babbit and the cat. Then Catstello, hypnosis book in hand, turns the cat into a bronco and Babbit into a cowboy. They ride off together out of the deli, leaving Catstello happily eating cheese, reading the book &quot;Live Alone and Like It&quot;, and remarking &quot;Oh — I&#x27;m a baaaaad boy!&quot; (The book was written by Marjorie Hillis, the editor of Vogue, around 1936 for unmarried women.)

<doc id="1287154" wikidata="Q1195736" url="?curid=1287154" title="Share (P2P)">
<text>is the name for a closed-source P2P application being developed in Japan by ファイル倉庫, a pseudonym translating as &#x27;file warehouse.&#x27; &quot;Share&quot; was developed to be the successor to Winny. Like Winny, &quot;Share&quot; functions using a distributed data store referred to as a cache with each computer acting as a node in the network. Netagent published a survey in June 2018 suggesting that Share was the third most popular p2p network in Japan after Winny and Perfect Dark (P2P) with approximately 10,000 nodes connecting each day over Golden Week, down from 30,000 in 2015.

==Background==
Share&#x27;s logo refers to the Laughing Man, which is a fictional character from the anime series &quot;Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex&quot;, as an anonymous hacker. 

&quot;Share&quot; uses encryption to hide the identity of who is transferring or what they are transferring. It is non-centralized so it cannot be easily shut down and it supports multiple source &quot;swarm&quot; downloading. All files are transferred encrypted so they must be decrypted upon download completion. In the meantime they are stored in encrypted form in a &quot;Cache&quot; folder. This folder is also used to allow recently downloaded files to be shared among the network based on priorities.

&quot;Share&quot; also features a plugin system. The plugins and PDK are readily available through the &quot;Share&quot; network. The PDK is written in Delphi.

Unlike &quot;Winny&quot;, &quot;Share&quot; allows users to specify up to 255 Cluster Keywords, though only 5 can be active at once (&quot;Winny&quot; only allowed 3 cluster words, and its system was more confusing). These are used to connect to nodes that have also specified the same Cluster Keywords. This allows users to maintain connections with nodes that are sharing files they might be interested in, while disconnecting from nodes that share content they are not concerned about.

Users can specify auto-download triggers and auto-block filters. The network also appears to have some sort of a &quot;forgery warning&quot; system to warn people about possible falsified data/files.

Like &quot;Winny&quot;, &quot;Share&quot; uses « Trip IDs » to verify the identity of a person sharing a file. A « Trip ID » is a sort of encrypted key that identifies a person who they say they are. This allows users to decide whether or not they trust a person based on their previous sharing experience with them.

When a new version of &quot;Share&quot; becomes available, users are given a notice in the &quot;Share&quot; statusbar. When this happens, users can search for the new version on the &quot;Share&quot; network, and download it from a reliable source based on Trip.

==Criticism==
&quot;Share&quot; is highly popular in Japan, but in the West, some concerns have been raised.
* In Japan, high speed Internet is more readily available than in most of Western Europe and North America. For this reason the minimum upload and download limits are set to 50 kB/s. Also, the cache system can use around 4 GB of free space at any given time to store cached downloads. This might be inconvenient for people with small hard drives.
* As a closed source product, &quot;Share&quot; partially relies on security through obscurity.
* Like many other P2P applications, &quot;Share&quot; downloads files in blocks. However, &quot;Share&quot; can only export partially downloaded files in sequential manner. For example, if a file has 100 blocks and block 51 is missing, &quot;Share&quot; will not be able to export block 52-100 even if they are already downloaded. Plugin developers have tried to overcome this limitation.

==Download==
&quot;Share&quot; can be downloaded from the Share P2P and P2P ファイル共有ソフトノード登録所 websites.

==Language localizations==
Unlike &quot;Winny&quot;, &quot;Share&quot; includes an option for language localisation changes (labeling of buttons, etc.). The locale.txt file contains the information for a particular language and resides in the &quot;Share&quot; directory.
* An English localization for A82
* An English localization for EX2 (TCP version)
* An English localization for NT5 (UDP version)
* More English localizations for Locate/Hint/Readme/Info
* Spanish localization for EX2 

==Legal issues==
On 9 May 2008, three Japanese people aged 21 to 41 were arrested in Kyoto, Japan for illegally uploading copyrighted files with &quot;Share&quot;. These were the first &quot;Share&quot;-related cases in Japan. Nevertheless, a research showed that there was no significant drop of on-line &quot;Share&quot; users after these arrests.

On 27 November 2008, another male &quot;Share&quot; user was arrested in Japan for illegally uploading Japanese TV drama with &quot;Share&quot;.

On 12 February 2009, two male &quot;Share&quot; users became the first to be arrested on charges of uploading Child pornography with &quot;Share&quot;.

On 30 September 2009, multiple Japanese media reported that two men were arrested for uploading Nintendo DS game software which include Square Enix&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Quest IX&quot;. They are the first users arrested for uploading DS games.

On 30 November 2009, 10 Japanese men and 1 woman were arrested for sharing anime, music, movies, and games. Not all were the original uploaders.

On 31 March 2010, 62-year-old Seiji Sato was spotted by a new p2p surveillance software for sharing &quot;Avatar&quot; and other movies.

On 14 January 2011, 18 people were arrested for sharing movies, anime, music, games and software.

<doc id="1287160" wikidata="Q1282201" url="?curid=1287160" title="Stepfather">
<text>A stepfather or stepdad is a biologically unrelated male parent married to one&#x27;s preexisting parent.

A stepfather-in-law is a stepfather of one&#x27;s spouse. Children from his spouse&#x27;s previous unions are known as his stepchildren.

==In fiction==
Though less common in literature than stereotypical evil stepmothers, there are also cases of evil &quot;stepfathers&quot;, such as in the fairy tales &quot;The Gold-Bearded Man&quot; (in a plot usually featuring a cruel father) and &quot;The Little Bull-Calf&quot;. One type of such tale features a defeated villain who insists on marrying the hero&#x27;s mother and makes her help him trick the hero and so defeat him. Such tales include &quot;The Prince and the Princess in the Forest&quot; and &quot;The Blue Belt&quot;, although the tales of this type can also feature a different female relation, such as the stepsister in &quot;The Three Princes and their Beasts&quot;.

In media, evil stepfathers include Claudius in &quot;Hamlet&quot; (though his role as uncle is more emphasized), Walter Parks Thatcher in &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (though this is debatable), Murdstone in Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, the King from the movie &quot;Radio Flyer&quot;, and Gozaburo Kaiba (who adopted Seto and Mokuba Kaiba) from &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;. &quot;The Stepfather&quot; depicts an evil father who has murdered his family and subsequent families. 

In his opera &quot;La Cenerentola&quot;, Gioacchino Rossini inverted the tale of &quot;Cinderella&quot; to have her oppressed by her stepfather. His motive is made explicit, in that providing a dowry to Cenerentola would cut into what he can give to his own daughters. An analogous male figure may also appear as a wicked uncle; like the stepmother, the father&#x27;s brother may covet the child&#x27;s inheritance for his own children, and so maltreat his nephews or nieces.

<doc id="1287177" wikidata="Q6152444" url="?curid=1287177" title="Jane Kenyon">
<text>Jane Kenyon (May 23, 1947 – April 22, 1995) was an American poet and translator. Her work is often characterized as simple, spare, and emotionally resonant. Kenyon was the second wife of poet, editor, and critic Donald Hall who made her the subject of many of his poems.

==Life==
Kenyon was born in 1947 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, to Ruele and Pauline, she grew up in the Midwest. She earned a B.A. from the University of Michigan in 1970 and an M.A. in 1972. She won a Hopwood Award at Michigan. As a university student Kenyon met poet Donald Hall; though he was some nineteen years her senior, she married him in 1972, and they moved to his ancestral home in Wilmot, New Hampshire. Kenyon was New Hampshire&#x27;s poet laureate when she died on April 22, 1995, from leukemia.

==Career==
Four collections of Kenyon&#x27;s poems were published during her lifetime: &quot;From Room to Room&quot; (1978), &quot;The Boat of Quiet Hours&quot; (1986), &quot;Let Evening Come&quot; (1990) and &quot;Constance&quot; (1993); apart from the former being published through Alice James Books, all of her writing was released through Graywolf Press. She spent some years translating the poems of Anna Akhmatova from Russian into English, and she championed translation as an important art that every poet should try.

Kenyon&#x27;s poems are filled with rural images: light streaming through a hayloft, shorn winter fields. She wrote frequently about wrestling with depression, which plagued her throughout her adult life. Kenyon&#x27;s poem &quot;Having it out with Melancholy&quot; describes this struggle and the brief moments of happiness she felt when taking an MAOI, Nardil. However, two visits to India in the early 1990s led to a crisis of faith, as Hall (in introductions to her books and in his own memoirs), Alice Mattison, and her biographer John Timmerman have described.

Kenyon was also a contributor to &quot;&quot;.

Prior to her death, she was editing the collection &quot;Otherwise: New and Selected Poems&quot;. Kenyon&#x27;s papers, including manuscripts, personal journals, and notebooks are held at the University of New Hampshire Library Special Collections and Archives.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Let Evening Come&quot; was featured in the 2005 film &quot;In Her Shoes&quot;, in a scene where the character played by Cameron Diaz reads the poem (as well as &quot;One Art&quot; by Elizabeth Bishop) to a blind nursing home resident.

&quot;Having it out with Melancholy&quot; has been read by Amanda Palmer on Brain Pickings.

==Awards==
*1994 PEN/Voelcker Award for Poetry

<doc id="1287178" wikidata="Q1703300" url="?curid=1287178" title="Jonathan Schell">
<text>Jonathan Edward Schell (August 21, 1943 – March 25, 2014) was an American reporter and writer whose work primarily dealt with American foreign policy from the Vietnam War to the War on Terror, as well as the threat posed by nuclear weapons and support for nuclear disarmament.

==Life and career==
===Early life and education===
Schell was born in New York City on August 21, 1943, to Orville Hickock Schell Jr., a lawyer who chaired Americas Watch, and Marjorie Bertha. His siblings included a sister, Suzanne, and a brother, Orville Schell, a former Dean of the University of California, Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism and, the Arthur Ross Director of the Center on U.S.–China Relations at Asia Society in New York. He studied at Dalton School in New York and graduated from The Putney School in Vermont. In 1965 he graduated from Harvard University with a degree in Far Eastern history. He then spent a year learning Japanese at the International Christian University in Tokyo.

===Early career: Vietnam, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;===
After completing his studies in Tokyo, Schell flew to Saigon in January 1967, as American involvement in the Vietnam War continued to escalate. He managed to acquire a press pass by claiming to be a correspondent for &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;, and would later recount how the correspondents reporting on the war &quot;took [him] under their wing&quot;. He was a witness to Operation Cedar Falls, writing particularly on the destruction of Bến Súc. His reportage was published first in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and then as a book, &quot;The Village of Ben Suc&quot;, with Alfred A. Knopf.

His second book, &quot;The Military Half: An Account of Destruction in Quang Ngai and Quang Tin&quot;, published in 1968, also drew a graphic picture of the devastating effects of American bombings and ground operations on Quảng Ngãi Province and Quảng Tín Province in South Vietnam.
From 1967 until 1987, Schell was a staff writer at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, where he served as the principal writer of the magazine&#x27;s Notes and Comment section. He wrote essays for the magazine on the presidency of Richard Nixon, including the Watergate scandal that led to the president&#x27;s resignation in 1974, that formed the basis to his book, &quot;The Time of Illusion&quot;. The Notes and Comments section was awarded the George Polk Award for Commentary in 1979.

In 1977, William Shawn, the longtime editor-in-chief of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, designated Schell as his chosen successor to replace him but he was forced to rescind that plan as it proved immediately unpopular with the magazine&#x27;s staff. Shawn revisited the same plan in 1982 but again withdrew Schell&#x27;s name from consideration in the face of a staff revolt. Ultimately, upon a change of ownership of the magazine in 1987, Shawn was removed and replaced as editor-in-chief with Robert Gottlieb.

In the early 1980s, Schell wrote a series of articles in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, subsequently published in 1982 as &quot;The Fate of the Earth&quot;, which were instrumental in raising public awareness about the dangers of the nuclear arms race and became an essential part of the Nuclear Freeze campaign. The book received the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Book Prize, and was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and the National Book Critics Circle Award. He became an advocate for disarmament and a world free of nuclear weapons.

===Later career: &quot;The Nation&quot;, teaching===
In 1987, Schell was a fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, and in 2002 he served as a fellow at the Kennedy School&#x27;s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. He was a visiting lecturer at Yale Law School in 2003, and a fellow at the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization in 2005. He taught at several other universities, including Princeton, Emory, New York University, The New School, and Wesleyan University. At the time of his death he was a visiting lecturer at Yale College.

He was a columnist for &quot;Newsday&quot; from 1990 until 1996. From 1998 to his death in 2014, he was a senior fellow at The Nation Institute and the peace and disarmament correspondent for &quot;The Nation&quot; magazine. In addition, he wrote for &quot;TomDispatch&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, and &quot;The Atlantic&quot;.

In 2002 and 2003, Schell was a persistent critic of the invasion of Iraq. He later commented, &quot;There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a rush to find the people who were right about Iraq and install them in the mainstream media.&quot;

Jonathan Schell died at age 70, on March 25, 2014, at his home in Brooklyn, with a cancer caused by an underlying blood condition that may have been caused by Agent Orange. His last years were spent in research on climate change for an unwritten book he titled &quot;The Human Shadow.&quot;

==Reception and legacy==
In 1967, John Mecklin wrote in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; that &quot;The Village of Ben Suc&quot;, Jonathan Schell&#x27;s first book, was &quot;written with a skill that many a veteran war reporter will envy, eloquently sensitive, subtly clothed in an aura of detachment, understated, extraordinarily persuasive.&quot;

Reviewing &quot;The Military Half: An Account of Destruction in Quang Ngai and Quang Tin&quot;, journalist and historian Jonathan Mirsky wrote in &quot;The Nation&quot;: &quot;I know no book which has made me angrier and more ashamed.&quot;

On its publication in 1982, &quot;The Fate of the Earth&quot; was described by Kai Erikson in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; as &quot;a work of enormous force&quot; and &quot;an event of profound historical moment... [I]n the end, it accomplishes what no other work has managed to do in the 37 years of the nuclear age. It compels usand compel is the right wordto confront head on the nuclear peril in which we all find ourselves.&quot; The book also reflected on the end of love, politics and art, and the annihilation of humans as a species. CBS News journalist Walter Cronkite called the book &quot;one of the most important works of recent years&quot;, praise that helped to solidify the book&#x27;s commercial success.

In an &#x27;Author&#x27;s Note&#x27; to his collection of five short stories entitled &quot;Einstein&#x27;s Monsters&quot; (1987), the Anglo-American writer Martin Amis said this about Schell&#x27;s writings regarding nuclear weapons: &quot;And throughout I am grateful to Jonathan Schell, for ideas and imagery. I don&#x27;t know why he is our best writer on this subject. He is not the most stylish, perhaps, nor the most knowledgeable. But he is the most decorous and, I think, the most pertinent. He has moral accuracy; he is unerring.&quot;

Writing in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; magazine, however, David Greenberg called &quot;The Fate of the Earth&quot; an &quot;overwrought doomsday polemic.&quot; Two decades later, in &quot;Slate&quot;, Michael Kinsley characterized it as &quot;an overheated stew of the obvious and the idiotic&quot; and suggested it was &quot;the silliest book ever taken seriously by serious people.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that &quot;some reviewers found Schell&#x27;s book shrill and overstated.&quot;

Reviewing &quot;The Seventh Decade: The New Shape of Nuclear Danger&quot; in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; in 2007, Martin Walker characterized it as &quot;a passionate and cogently argued case for the complete abolition of nuclear weapons... There is little in Schell&#x27;s book that is new, but his careful assembly of the available evidence will scare the pants off most readers. And so it should.&quot;

In 2019, philosopher Akeel Bilgrami described Schell as &quot;one of the great public intellectuals of our time,&quot; and described &quot;The Fate of the Earth&quot; as a &quot;rightly celebrated classic&quot;.

<text>The Chen Sheng and Wu Guang uprising (), August 209 B.C.– January 208 B.C., was the first uprising against the Qin dynasty following the death of Qin Shi Huang. Led by Chen Sheng and Wu Guang, the uprising was unsuccessful.

== Name ==
It is also called the Dazexiang uprising () as the uprising started in Dazexiang (大泽乡), which translates into &quot;Big Swamp Village&quot;.

== History ==
Chen Sheng and Wu Guang were both army officers who were ordered to lead their bands of commoner soldiers north to participate in the defense of Yuyang (). However, they were stopped halfway in present-day Anhui province by flooding from a severe rainstorm. The harsh Qin laws mandated execution for those who showed up late for government jobs, regardless of the nature of the delay. Figuring that they would rather fight than accept execution, Chen and Wu organized a band of 900 villagers to rebel against the government. The current emperor, Huhai, had killed his brother Fusu, who was known for his benevolence, to take the throne, so they rose up in Fusu&#x27;s name.

There are two stories for this uprising. To convince people to support this uprising, Chen Sheng and Wu Guang wrote &quot;King Chen Sheng&quot; on a piece of silk, and placed it in the belly of a fish. A man in this army bought the fish and was surprised to find the message. They also imitated animal sounds to say &quot;Da Chu flourishes, King Chen Sheng&quot; to make people believe in them. 

With Chen&#x27;s men declaring him king of the former Kingdom of Chu, he and Wu became the centre of armed uprisings all over China. Over the course of just a few months, their strength grew to around ten thousand men, a force composed mostly of discontented peasants. However, in less than a year, their uprising faced serious trouble; their force was no match for the highly skilled battlefield tactics of the professional Qin soldiers and both Chen and Wu were assassinated by their own men.

While their insurrection was ultimately unsuccessful, Wu and Chen set up the example that was to be followed by Liu Bang and Xiang Yu. Their spirit can be summed up in Chen&#x27;s quote &quot;&quot; (traditional Chinese: , pinyin: ; &quot;Are kings and nobles given their high status by birth?&quot;), meaning that every human, regardless of birth, can become something great if he applies himself.

== Historical materials ==
There is a biography of Chen Sheng and Wu Guang, which is called &quot;aristocratic family of Chen Sheng&quot;, in Records of the Grand Historian. The main points of the passage are as follows. Chen Sheng was a tenant who was born in Henan province and Wu Guang was his townsman. When Chen Sheng was young, he used to plow with some peasants. One day, he felt tired, then he stopped working and went to a hill for a rest. 

At that time, he said to his companions &quot;If someone among us rises to power and position, please don&#x27;t forget us.&quot; (&quot;&quot;) 

His companions laughed at him and said &quot;You are a tenant, how can you be rich and powerful?&quot; (&quot;&quot;) 

Chen Sheng sighed and said &quot;How can a sparrow comprehend the ambition of a swan?&quot; (&quot;&quot;)

Later on, Chen Sheng became an army officer, and led the uprising with Wu Guang, his deputy. Wu Guang was a kind and influential man, but nothing more could be found about him from the history records.

<doc id="1287212" wikidata="Q17108994" url="?curid=1287212" title="Music of West Virginia">
<text>West Virginia&#x27;s folk heritage is a part of the Appalachian folk music tradition, and includes styles of fiddling, ballad singing, and other styles that draw on Ulster-Scots music.

West Virginia consists of a mostly rural region, although its few relatively urban centers are prominent spots of musical innovation. The Capitol Music Hall, in Wheeling, is the oldest performing place of its kind in the state, and has hosted a wide variety of acts, from national tours to the local Wheeling Symphony Orchestra.

Other music institutions in West Virginia include the Mountaineer Opera House in Milton. The West Virginia Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1939, as the &quot;Charleston Civic Orchestra&quot;, before becoming the &quot;Charleston Symphony Orchestra&quot; in 1943. The first conductor was William R. Wiant, followed by the prominent conductor Antonio Modarelli, of the Wheeling Symphony Orchestra.

The town of Glenville has long been home to the annual West Virginia State Folk Festival.

== Music history ==

West Virginia&#x27;s historical contributions to musical development include &quot;WWVA Jamboree&quot;, a radio show that began in 1933 and soon became a very prominent regional show, based out of the Capitol Music Hall in Wheeling. WWVA, the radio station that has long broadcast &quot;WWVA Jamboree&quot;, hosts the Jamboree in the Hills every July in St. Clairsville, Ohio, just across the border from Wheeling.

The town of Oak Hill was the site of country legend Hank Williams&#x27; death, which is commemorated by a plaque in front of the public library in Oak Hill.

Daniel Johnston, born in California, grew up in New Cumberland.

<doc id="1287219" wikidata="Q1751810" url="?curid=1287219" title="Arteritis">
<text>Arteritis is a vascular disorder characterized by inflammation of the walls of arteries, usually as a result of infection or autoimmune responses. Arteritis, a complex disorder, is still not entirely understood. Arteritis may be distinguished by its different types, based on the organ systems affected by the disease. A complication of arteritis is thrombosis, which can be fatal. Arteritis and phlebitis are forms of vasculitis.

==Signs and Symptoms==
Symptoms of general arteritis may include:
* Inflammation
* Fever
* Increased production of red blood cells (erythrocytes)
* Limping
* Reduced pulse

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis of arteritis is based on unusual medical symptoms. Similar symptoms may be caused by a number of other conditions, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome (both heritable disorders of connective tissue), tuberculosis, syphilis, spondyloarthropathies, Cogans&#x27; syndrome, Buerger&#x27;s, Behcet&#x27;s, and Kawasaki disease. Various imaging techniques may be used to diagnose and monitor disease progression. Imaging modalities may include direct angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, and ultrasonography.

Angiography is commonly used in the diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis, especially in the advanced stages of the disease, when arterial stenosis, occlusion, and aneurysms may be observed. However, angiography is a relatively invasive investigation, exposing patients to large doses of radiation, so is not recommended for routine, long-term monitoring of disease progression in patients with Takayasu arteritis.

Computed tomography angiography can determine the size of the aorta and its surrounding branches, and can identify vessel wall lesions in middle to late stages of arteritis. CTA can also show the blood flow within the blood vessels. Like angiography, CTA exposes patients to high dosages of radiation.

Magnetic resonance angiography is used to diagnose Takayasu arteritis in the early stages, showing changes such as the thickening of the vessel wall. Even small changes may be measured, making MRA a useful tool for monitoring disease progression without exposing patients to the radiation of direct angiography or CTA. MRA is an expensive investigation, and shows calcification of the aorta and distal branches less clearly than other imaging methods.

Ultrasonography is an ideal method of diagnosing patients in early stages of arteritis when inflammation in the vessel walls occurs. It can also show the blood flow within the blood vessels. Ultrasonography is a popular first-line investigation for diagnosis because it is relatively quick, cheap, noninvasive, and does not expose patients to radiation. It is also used for long-term monitoring of disease progression in Takayasu arteritis. Not all vascular lesions are visible on ultrasound, and the accuracy of the scan depends, to some extent, on the person reading the scan, as the results are observed in real time.

===Types===
Arteritis may be primary or secondary to some other disease process. The primary types are:
An example of a secondary arteritis is arteritis caused by infection with the fungal pathogen &quot;Candida albicans&quot;.

====Giant cell arteritis====
Giant cell arteritis contains two different types of arteritides that are almost indistinguishable from one another. It includes two types, temporal arteritis and Takayasu arteritis. Both types contain an occupancy of medium- and larger-sized arteries which are categorized based on the infiltration of the giant cells.

====Takayasu arteritis====

This type of arteritis is most common in females, with a median age of 25 years. Takayasu arteritis is more common in women of Asian descent who are in their reproductive years. However, over the past decades, its incidence in Africa, Europe, and North America has been increasing. Takayasu arteritis is an inflammatory disease that mainly affects the larger vessels such as the aorta and its surrounding branches. Research focused on Takayasu arteritis in the western parts of the world remains limited. An estimation suggests that, each year, the number of cases per million people is 2.6.

====Temporal arteritis====

Temporal arteritis, the second type of giant cell arteritis, is also a chronic, inflammatory disease involving mid- to large-sized arteries. Temporal arteritis has a higher incidence in people of Scandinavian descent. However, the incidence rate differs based on population, region and races. Temporal arteritis is not uncommon in North America. The incidence rate is around 0.017% for individuals over 50 years of age.

Symptoms of temporal arteritis are classified as specific and nonspecific.

Nonspecific symptoms:
* Headache
* Low grade fever
* Sweating
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Weight loss
* General malaise

Specific symptoms:
* Claudication of the jaw
* Engorged, tender vessels

Specific symptoms usually develop in the advanced stages of temporal arteritis. These symptoms can include damage to eyesight and sudden blindness in one or both eyes. 

Polyarteritis nodosa of unknown mechanism can cause testicular pain. It is often associated with aneurysms and Hepatitis B.

==Treatment==

===Medications===
The first-line treatment for arteritis is oral glucocorticoid (steroid) medication, such as prednisone, taken daily for a period of three months. After this initial phase, the medication may be reduced in dose or frequency, e.g. every other day, if possible. If the disease worsens with the new treatment schedule, a cytotoxic medication may be given, in addition to the glucocorticoid. Commonly used cytotoxic agents include azathioprine, methotrexate, or cyclophosphamide. The dose of glucocorticoid medication may be decreased if response to treatment is good. This medication may be reduced gradually once the disease becomes inactive, slowly tapering the dose (to allow the body time to adjust) until the medication may be stopped completely. Conversely, if the disease remains active, the medication will need to be increased. After six months, if the medication cannot be reduced in frequency to alternate days, or if in 12 months the medications cannot be stopped completely, then treatment is deemed to have failed.

Pulsed therapy is an alternative method of administering the medications above, using much higher doses over a short period of time (a pulse), to reduce the inflammation within the arteries. Methylprednisolone, a glucocorticoid, is often used for pulse therapy; cyclophosphamide is an alternative. This method has been shown to be successful for some patients. Immunosuppressive pulse therapy, such as with cyclophosphamide, has also demonstrated relief of symptoms associated with arteritis.

<text>Opopanax chironium, common name Hercules&#x27; all-heal, is a herb of the family Apiaceae.

==Description==
&quot;Opopanax chironium&quot; grows high. This perennial herb has a branching stem, thick and rough close to the base. Leaves are serrate, pinnate, with long petioles. It produces a large, flat, yellow inflorescence at the top of the branches.

==Distribution and habitat==
The plant thrives in warm climates like Iran, Italy, Greece and Turkey, but also grows in cooler climates. 

==Uses==
A gum resin (mostly gum) can be extracted from this plant by cutting at the base of a stem and sun-drying the juice that flows out. It has a strong unpleasant odor, unlike the perfumery&#x27;s opopanax which is aromatic.
The resin has been used in the treatment of spasms, and, before that, as an emmenagogue, in the treatment of asthma, chronic visceral infections, hysteria and hypochondria. Opopanax resin is most frequently sold in dried irregular pieces, though tear-shaped gems are not uncommon.

<doc id="1287224" wikidata="Q19742" url="?curid=1287224" title="Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon">
<text>The Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon, also known as the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon, the Tsangpo Canyon, the Brahmaputra Canyon or the Tsangpo Gorge (), is a canyon along the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet Autonomous Region, China. It is the deepest canyon in the world, and at is slightly longer than the Grand Canyon in the United States, making it one of the world&#x27;s largest. The Yarlung Tsangpo (Tibetan name for the upper course of the Brahmaputra) originates near Mount Kailash and runs east for about , draining a northern section of the Himalayas before it enters the gorge just downstream of Pei, Tibet, near the settlement of Zhibe. The canyon has a length of about as the gorge bends around Mount Namcha Barwa () and cuts its way through the eastern Himalayas. Its waters drop from about near Pei to about at the end of the Upper Gorge where the Po Tsangpo River enters. The river continues through the Lower Gorge to the Indian border at an elevation of . The river then enters Arunachal Pradesh and eventually becomes the Brahmaputra.

==Canyon depth==

As the canyon passes between the peaks of the Namcha Barwa (Namjabarwa) and Gyala Peri mountains, it reaches an average depth of about 5,000 m (16,000 feet) around Namcha Barwa. The canyon&#x27;s average depth &quot;overall&quot; is about 2,268 m (7,440 feet), the deepest depth reaches 6,009 m (19,714 feet). This is the greatest canyon depth on land. This part of the canyon is at . Namcha Barwa, 7,782 m (25,531 feet) high, is at , and Gyala Peri, at 7,234 m (23,733 feet), is at .

==Ecosystem==
The gorge has a unique ecosystem with species of animals and plants barely explored and affected by human influence. Its climate ranges from subtropical to Arctic, and it has several different vegetation zones: Lowland tropical forests, including the tropical rainforest and seasonal tropical forests; tropical montane and subtropical broad-leaved forest; subalpine temperate coniferous forest; subalpine cool coniferous forest; alpine shrubland and tundra. The highest temperature in Tibet is and is recorded near the border of India at about above sea level. The rare takin is one of the animals hunted by the local tribes.

The canyon is home of a South Tibetan cypress (&quot;Cupressus austrotibetica&quot;) that is tall and, upon its discovery in 2023, is believed to be the tallest tree in Asia.

==The &quot;Everest of Rivers&quot;==
Western interest in the Tsangpo began in the 19th century when British explorers and geographers speculated where Tibet&#x27;s east-flowing Tsangpo ended up, suspecting the Brahmaputra. Since British citizens were not allowed to enter Tibet they recruited Indian &quot;pundits&quot; to do the footwork. Kinthup from Sikkim entered the gorge near Gyala, but it proved to be impenetrable. In 1880 Kinthup was sent back to test the Brahmaputra theory by releasing 500 specially marked logs into the river at a prearranged time. His British boss Captain Henry Harman posted men on the Dihang-Brahmaputra to watch for their arrival. However, Kinthup was sold into slavery, escaped, and ended up employed at a monastery. On three leaves of absence he managed to craft the logs, send a letter from Lhasa with his new intended schedule, and send off the logs. Four years had passed. Unfortunately his note to alert the British got misdirected, his boss had left India, and nobody checked for the appearance of the logs.

In 1913, Frederick Marshman Bailey and Henry Morshead launched an expedition into the gorge that finally confirmed that the Tsangpo was indeed the upper Brahmaputra. Frank Kingdon-Ward started an expedition in 1924 in hopes of finding a major waterfall explaining the difference in altitude between the Tsangpo and the Brahmaputra. It turned out that the gorge has a series of relatively steep sections. Among them was a waterfall he named &quot;Rainbow Falls&quot;, not as big as he had hoped.

The area was closed after China invaded Tibet and disputed the location of the border in the Sino-Indian War. The Chinese government resumed issuing permits in the 1990s. Since then the gorge has also been visited by kayakers. It has been called the &quot;Everest of Rivers&quot; because of the extreme conditions. The first attempt was made in 1993 by a Japanese group who lost one member on the river. In October 1998 an expedition sponsored by the National Geographic Society attempted to kayak the entire gorge. Troubled by unanticipated high water levels, it ended in tragedy when Doug Gordon was lost. In January–February 2002 an international group with Scott Lindgren, Steve Fisher, Mike Abbott, Allan Ellard, Dustin Knapp, and Johnnie and Willie Kern completed the first full descent of the upper Tsangpo gorge section.

The largest waterfalls of the gorge (near Tsangpo Badong, Chinese: ) were visited in 1998, by a team consisting of Ken Storm, Hamid Sarder, Ian Baker and their Monpa guides. They estimated the height of the falls to be about . The falls and rest of the Pemako area are sacred to Tibetan Buddhists who had concealed them from outsiders including the Chinese authorities. In 2005 Chinese National Geography named them China&#x27;s most beautiful waterfalls.
There are two waterfalls in this section: Rainbow Falls (about high) at and Hidden Falls just downstream at (about high).

==Yarlung Tsangpo Hydroelectric and Water Diversion Project==
While the government of the PRC has declared the establishment of a &quot;Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon National Reservation&quot;, there have also been governmental plans and feasibility studies for a major dam to harness hydroelectric power and divert water to other areas in China. The size of the dam in the Tsongpo gorge would exceed that of Three Gorges Dam as it is anticipated that such a plant would generate 50,000 megawatts of electricity, more than twice the output of Three Gorges. It is feared that there will be displacement of local populations, destruction of ecosystems, and an impact for downstream people in India and Bangladesh. The project is criticized by India because of its potential negative impact upon the residents downstream.

In 1999, R.B. Cathcart suggested that a fabric dam—inflatable with freshwater or air—could block the Yarlung Tsangpo Canyon upstream of Namcha Barwa. Water would then be conveyed via a hard rock tunnel to a point downstream from that mountain.
Steel dams are more advantageous and economical in remote hilly terrain at high altitude for diverting the run off water of the river to power generating units.

<doc id="1287232" wikidata="Q1061075" url="?curid=1287232" title="Champagne gene">
<text>The champagne gene is a simple dominant allele responsible for a number of rare horse coat colors. The most distinctive traits of horses with the champagne gene are the hazel eyes and pinkish, freckled skin, which are bright blue and bright pink at birth, respectively. The coat color is also affected: any hairs that would have been red are gold, and any hairs that would have been black are chocolate brown. If a horse inherits the champagne gene from either or both parents, a coat that would otherwise be chestnut is instead gold champagne, with bay corresponding to amber champagne, seal brown to sable champagne, and black to classic champagne. A horse must have at least one champagne parent to inherit the champagne gene, for which there is now a DNA test.

Unlike the genes underlying tobiano, dominant white, frame overo spotting and the Leopard complex common to the Appaloosa, the champagne gene does not affect the location of pigment-producing cells in the skin. Nor does the champagne gene remove all pigment from the skin and hair, as in albinism. Instead, the champagne gene produces traits known as hypomelanism, or dilution. Champagne is not associated with any health defects. Other dilution genes in horses include the Cream gene, Dun gene, Pearl gene and Silver dapple gene. Horses affected by these genes can sometimes be confused with champagnes, but champagnes are genetically distinct. Champagnes are not palominos, buckskins, or grullos, nor does the word champagne indicate that a horse is a shiny or light shade of another coat color.

This gene and the associated coat colors are only known in American breeds, especially the American Cream Draft, Tennessee Walker, American Saddlebred and Missouri Fox Trotter

==Coat colors==


Champagne is a dominant trait, based on a mutation in the SLC36A1 gene. A horse with either one or two champagne genes will show the effects of the gene equally. However, if a horse is homozygous for a dominant gene, it will always pass the gene on to all of its offspring, while if the horse is heterozygous for the gene, the offspring will not always inherit the color. Horses with the champagne gene may also carry other coat color genes that affect their phenotype, or outward color.

Horses with the champagne gene have a lightened hair coat and specific eye and skin color traits. Black pigment in the coat, if present, is lightened to chocolate, while red pigment is lightened to gold. The precise champagne dilute coat color produced depends on the underlying base coat color. The effects of champagne plus additional coat color genes have their own distinct vocabulary and appearances;

It is difficult to distinguish between homozygous and heterozygous champagne, which is different from incomplete dominant dilutions such as the cream gene. However the 2008 study that mapped the gene and identified it as a dominant trait noted in passing that homozygotes may have less mottling or a slightly lighter hair color. The authors of this study noted that

The following are considered the most &quot;basic&quot; champagne coat colors:

Classic champagne is, as its name suggests, the coat color most associated with the champagne gene. It is produced by the action of champagne on a black coat. The body coat is chocolate, the mane and tail a darker shade. The legs may also be slightly darker. The overall effect has also been described as lilac, dark taupe, and even green. This color is most often misclassified as grullo, and in the past was sometimes called &quot;lilac dun.&quot;

Sable champagne is produced by the action of champagne on a seal brown coat. It is visually difficult to distinguish from classic champagne, and can be confirmed by a DNA test negative for the recessive black (&quot;a&quot;) allele at Agouti. 

Amber champagne is produced by the action of champagne on a bay coat. The coat is gold with chocolate points. Just as there are varying shades of bay, the gold body coat may vary in shade as well. The legs are often lighter than the mane and tail, and the colored points may be difficult to see. The mane and tail may also have &quot;frosting&quot; or light edges, a trait that also occurs in bay duns and some buckskins. Amber champagne can be confused with buckskin or bay dun.

Gold champagne is produced by the action of champagne on a chestnut coat. The coat is gold, and the mane and tail are typically ivory. In some cases, the mane and tail may be self-colored, matching the body coat. These gold champagnes are sometimes called &quot;dark gold&quot; and may be an all-over apricot shade. Dark gold champagnes can be confused with red dun, while those with paler manes and tails were historically called &quot;pumpkin-skinned palominos.&quot;

Apart from the unique shades, there are several qualities of the champagne coat that may be used to help identify them. Champagne coats often have an unusual sheen. This sheen makes champagnes difficult to photograph accurately, as the appearance of the coat depends on the lighting. Not all champagne horses have this sheen, and there are many extremely shiny non-champagne horses, so a &quot;sheen&quot; in and of itself does not indicate the champagne gene. The coat may also exhibit reverse dappling, though this is also an unreliable indicator.

===Skin, eyes, and hooves===
The color of the skin is the single most important visual identifier of champagne horses: in the adult horse, the skin is &quot;pink with abundant dark freckles, except under white markings.&quot; The freckles - not mottles, splotches, specks, or blotches - are dark and may have a purple cast, and are small and numerous. By comparison, mottling associated with the Leopard complex is large and blocky alternations between true black or charcoal-colored skin and pigmentless-pink skin. The skin of cremellos and perlinos is pigmented-pink, and exhibit a scant few tiny black specks. Homozygous pearls and pearl-cream combinations also exhibit some freckling of the skin, however this is muted in comparison to the freckles of champagne skin. The skin may exhibit an overall lavender tone. The color qualities of the skin are most evident around the eyes and muzzle, under the tail, and on the udder or sheath.

The eyes of an adult champagne horse are most often described as hazel or amber. In the newborn or very young foal, the eyes are bright blue to blue-green and the skin is bright pink. The champagne blue foal eye is creamier than other types of blue eye such as the bright, unpigmented blue seen on some pinto horses.

In the past, some breeders and horse owners had concerns that horses with light-colored skin and eyes were not healthy. However, the lightening of these parts of the horse due to the champagne gene is not known to be linked to any health or genetic defects. While horses with white markings may sunburn on exposed unpigmented skin, the freckled-pink skin of a champagne horse is said to tan instead. In addition, the color of the hoof has no bearing on its strength.

===Interaction with other coat color factors===
The presence of other coat color modifying alleles has no effect on whether or not a horse has the champagne trait. However, different traits may interact; they may suppress, enhance, obscure or cancel out various tell-tale clues to the genetic identity of a coat color. Coat colors involving multiple genes often have an unexpected appearance and unique terminology. This type of genetic interaction is called epistasis.

Horses with both the champagne gene and the cream gene are the most common combination. The cream gene is responsible for the palomino, buckskin and cremello coat colors, and is a dose-dependent or incomplete dominant, meaning that a horse with only one copy is visibly different from a horse with two copies of the gene. A single copy of the cream gene dilutes red pigment in the coat to gold or yellow, and has a slight effect on the skin and eye color. The black pigment is lightened little, if at all. Two copies of the cream gene dilute both red and black pigments in the hair to cream or ivory, dilute the skin to a rosy-pink and the eyes to pale blue. The cream gene and champagne gene have an additive or enhancing interaction. Horses with the champagne gene and a single cream gene typically have lighter yellowish or blue eyes and paler, more faintly freckled skin.
* Gold cream or Ivory champagne refers to an otherwise-chestnut coat affected by the champagne gene and a single copy of the cream gene. The mane, tail, and coat of gold creams are typically ivory and difficult to distinguish from cremello, other than by the skin and eyes.
* Amber cream, similarly, is an otherwise-bay coat affected by the champagne gene and a single copy of the cream gene. The mane and tail of a typical amber cream are a warm yellowish-brown and are often frosted. The legs may also be a light chocolate brown, but need not be. The body coat is a shade of ivory, usually darker than a gold cream. Their points are substantially darker than those of a perlino, and they have champagne skin and eye traits.
* Sable cream is a seal brown coat affected by champagne and a single copy of the cream gene. Sable creams may more closely resemble amber cream or classic cream. Most are several shades darker, with a cooler hue, than amber creams.
* Classic cream is a black coat affected by champagne and a single copy of the cream gene. Classic cream coats should resemble classic champagne shades, being only slightly lightened by the cream gene. Their coats may have a cooler hue.
* Double cream champagne is a coat of any color affected by champagne and both copies of the cream gene. Unlike the coat colors associated with only a single cream gene, double cream champagnes (respectively prefixed with &quot;gold,&quot; &quot;amber,&quot; etc.) retain no obvious champagne traits. Their skin is clear pink without freckling, and the eyes are pale blue. The terms &quot;cremello champagne&quot;, &quot;perlino champagne&quot; and so forth are also acceptable.

Horses with both the champagne gene and the dun gene are also well-recorded. The dun gene is responsible for flat, diluted coat colors and vivid primitive markings. Bay dun is thought to be the wildtype horse coat color. Dun does not affect skin or eye color, but dilutes red pigment to yellow and black pigment to slate gray. Champagne horses with the dun gene will have slightly further-diluted coats compared to non-dun champagnes, and will always exhibit striking primitive markings, such as a dorsal stripe and zebra-like stripes on the legs.
 Naming schemes are much the same as with champagne-cream combinations. Champagne-dun combinations retain their champagne eye and skin traits. The coats are distinguishable from non-champagne duns in that they are several shades lighter, black pigment is chocolate rather than slate, and they may exhibit a sheen. The coats are distinguishable from non-dun champagnes in the presence of primitive markings and a flatter tone.
* Gold dun refers to an otherwise-chestnut coat affected by both the champagne gene and dun gene. The mane and tail may be ivory or self-colored; the body coat ranges from a warm cream to apricot color with primitive markings a shade darker. The coat is substantially paler and more &quot;yellow&quot; than that of a chestnut dun, and flatter than that of a gold champagne.
* Amber dun refers to an otherwise-bay coat affected by both the champagne gene and dun gene. The mane and tail and primitive markings are warm chocolate brown with a buff tan-colored body. The legs may, or may not, be dark as well.
* Sable dun refers to an otherwise-seal brown coat affected by both the champagne gene and dun gene. The points are chocolate-colored and the coat is darker than the amber dun.
* Classic dun or Classic grulla refers to an otherwise-black coat affected by both the champagne gene and dun gene. The coat possesses more cool slate-gray tones than a classic champagne, while the points are warmer than a grulla.

The silver dapple gene in horses does not affect the eyes, skin, or red pigment. Chestnuts are unaffected, but in bay, seal brown, and black horses, the black pigment is diluted to a chocolate or silver. The mane and tail are most commonly affected. Champagne horses with the silver gene will retain their champagne skin and eye traits, but the black pigment will be further diluted. Silvers vary tremendously in shade and so defining a &quot;typical&quot; example is difficult.
* Amber silver refers to an otherwise-bay coat affected by both the champagne gene and silver gene. The interaction of these two genes - one diluting black to warm chocolate and red to gold, and the other diluting black further to silver - creates an unexpected phenotype. The more closely resembles colors in the red family, mostly deprived of black pigment. The mane and tail may be self-colored, and the coat is buttery and pale.
* Classic silver refers to an otherwise-black coat affected by both the champagne gene and silver gene. The darkest examples resemble classic champagnes with a silvery mane and tail. The palest are a very pale pewter. Some have warm chocolate tones, others do not.

The champagne gene, in combination with some white patterning genes, can also produce unexpected phenotypes. Horses with the leopard gene or Appaloosas exhibit starkly mottled skin around the muzzle, eyes, anus and sheath or udder. Most commonly, the mottling is blocky patches of normal, black skin and unpigmented pink. When a horse has both the leopard gene and the champagne gene, the champagne-associated skin is present only where the skin would be otherwise black.

In combination with gray, champagne produces very unusual coat behavior. Typically, gray horses are born a dark shade of their natural color, and begin to develop gray hairs around the eyes and muzzle. With each shed, the coat becomes lighter and lighter. Many older grays develop the &quot;fleabitten&quot; trait, in which small, interspersed flecks of red occur and often increase in density with age, even as the rest of the coat loses pigment. A few grays will also develop vitiligo in which the skin also progressively loses pigment. When a horse carries both gray and champagne, additional traits occur: Gray-champagnes are born with darker coats than the usual champagne foal, but still exhibiting the expected bright blue eyes and pink skin. The freckling that develops on the skin is also exceptionally dark and dense. Gray-champagnes appear more likely to experience vitiligo. The most unexpected quality of gray-champagnes is the intensity of the fleabitten trait. Flecks of champagne-colored hair are thickly interspersed in the unpigmented white hairs.

===Champagne mimics===
Many coat color modifying genes affect the skin and eyes as well as the coat color. Several of these may be confused with champagne. Today, when the visible cues are insufficient, horses can be DNA tested for the champagne gene, Cream gene, Pearl gene, and Silver dapple gene.

Palomino or Chestnut vs. Gold champagne: The most common confusion, as both of these genetically distinct coat colors feature a gold or yellow coat and ivory or cream mane and tail. As adults, the pinkish freckled skin and hazel eyes indicate gold champagne, while gray or black skin and light or dark brown eyes indicate palomino. At birth, palominos may have pink skin and blue or grey eyes, however these darken within days or weeks. Occasionally, chestnuts are also born with blue eyes and pink skin, and as gold champagnes often have chestnut-colored foal coats, the two can be difficult to distinguish. Again, the skin and eyes of the chestnut will darken quickly. In all cases, pedigrees can provide important information. Palominos will have a parent that is palomino, buckskin, smoky black, or blue-eyed cream. Champagnes will have a champagne parent.

Buckskin and Bay dun vs. Amber champagne: All three of these genetically distinct coat colors feature a lighter bronze or tan coat with darker points. As adults, the pinkish freckled skin and hazel eyes indicate amber champagne, while gray or black skin and light or dark brown eyes indicate buckskin or bay dun. Duns do not exhibit unusually colored skin, though buckskins, like palominos, may be born with blue eyes that darken within days or weeks. In the adult, the points of a buckskin or bay dun will be black, not chocolate as in the amber champagne. Bay dun horses also exhibit primitive markings, especially a dorsal stripe, though amber duns will also possess these marks. The eyes and skin remain the best identifying feature. Buckskins, like palominos, will a parent that is palomino, buckskin, smoky black, or blue-eyed cream. Bay duns will have a parent that is bay dun, red dun, or grullo. Champagnes will have a champagne parent.

Grullo vs. Classic champagne or Sable champagne: Classic and sable champagnes are difficult to distinguish without a DNA test. Grullos and classic champagnes are both dilutions of the black coat, and typically have black or dark points and dove-gray coats. However, Grullos, in absence of any other dilution factors, are not born with pink skin and blue eyes, while champagnes always have these traits. As adults, grullos will retain their dark brown eyes and black skin, while champagnes have pinkish freckled skin and hazel eyes. Grullos, like all duns, will possess primitive markings, and their coats are typically a cooler, slate shade, while classic and sable champagnes are chocolate-toned. The points and primitive markings on the grullo are black, while the points on classic and sable champagnes are brown. Grullos will have dun ancestry and champagnes will have champagne ancestry.

Red dun vs. Dark gold champagne: Some gold champagnes have darker bodies and self-colored manes and tails. These horses may resemble red duns, however red duns have distinct primitive markings and do not possess pinkish freckled skin or hazel eyes as adults, nor the bright pink skin and bright blue eyes of champagne foals.

Blue-eyed cream vs. Champagne: Blue-eyed cream is a collective term for any horse homozygous for the Cream gene (cremello, perlino, etc.). Blue-eyed creams, as their name suggests, have blue eyes from birth through adulthood and also have pink skin. Typically their blue eyes are quite pale, and are easy to distinguish from the sky blue eyes of champagne foals and the hazel eyes of adult champagnes. Their skin may have a scant few black flecks, but the abundant freckles of champagne skin are absent. The respective shades of pink skin and blue eyes are slightly different.
Leopard vs. Champagne: The Leopard complex is responsible for the spotted coat of the Appaloosa and other breeds. Even when a spotted hair coat is absent, other traits produced include mottled skin and a white sclera around the eye but generally the eye itself is dark brown. These mottles are alternations between unpigmented pink skin and pigmented skin, which is usually black (thus the mottles are black on a pink background). The mottles are substantially larger than the freckles of champagne skin, and leopard complex horses do not necessarily have light eyes.

Pearl vs. Champagne: In the homozygous state, or when combined with cream, the Pearl gene produces a diluted apricot to buff color, pale eyes and pale skin. Heterozygous pearls (one copy of the gene) often exhibit dark skin with some pinkish freckles, while homozygous pearls (two copies of the gene) have champagne-like skin. The freckles on homozygous pearls and pearl-creams are pale and muted.

==Prevalence==
Compared to the cream gene, which is widespread throughout many breeds on different continents, the champagne gene is rare and found almost exclusively among American horse breeds. Nearly all American Cream Draft horses are gold champagne. The champagne gene is also found in the Tennessee Walking Horse, American Saddlebred, Missouri Fox Trotter, Racking horse, Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horse, Spanish Mustang, American Quarter Horse, American Paint Horse, Appaloosa and Miniature horse breeds.

==History==
The champagne gene was located in 2008, but is not a new mutation. It is widespread among American horses, and has likely been present in the genepool for more than a century. The Palomino Horse Breeders Association (PHBA), which registers &quot;palomino&quot; horses based on appearance, includes allowances for freckle-skinned and hazel-eyed palominos. Furthermore, while the registry typically disallows horses with pink skin, it allows American Saddlebreds with skin of any color to be registered. The PHBA was incorporated in 1941. Further back, the foundation mare of the American Cream Draft horse breed, &quot;Old Granny&quot;, was born around 1905 in Iowa. Her cream-colored coat, pink skin and amber eyes are defining standards for the breed of her descendants, which are now known to be gold champagne.
The superficial similarities between gold champagne and palomino, and amber champagne and buckskin, may account for the relatively recent identification of champagne as a separate trait. Gold champagnes were sometimes called &quot;pumpkin-skinned palomino.&quot; Classic champagnes, which lack the primitive markings of true duns, were similarly called &quot;lilac duns.&quot; The mare that brought the champagne coat color family to the attention of modern researchers was a Tennessee Walking Horse named &quot;Champagne Lady Diane&quot; born in 1969. A classic champagne, Champagne Lady Diane was described as &quot;a genetic color accident&quot; after her hairs were sent to several universities, although current evidence suggests that the champagne gene predates Champagne Lady Diane.

It was not until many years after the name &quot;champagne&quot; was ascribed to Champagne Lady Diane that the term appeared in scientific literature. It was first studied and described by Sponenberg and Bowling in 1996. They studied the ratio of champagne-to-non-champagne offspring of champagne horses, and designated the causal mutation as the dominant &quot;Ch&quot; allele on the hypothetical &quot;Champagne&quot; locus.

==Inheritance and expression==
The champagne locus is on exon 2 of the SLC36A1 gene, which is on chromosome 14 (ECA14); a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) exchanges a C for a G at base 76 (c.188C&gt;G) resulting in a missense mutation. On a protein level, this SNP is predicted to result in the replacement of a threonine with arginine at amino acid 63 (T63R). &quot;SLC36A1&quot; is not associated with pigmentation phenotypes in other species, and its role in most tissues is poorly understood. &quot;SLC36A1&quot; is a member of a loosely united group of over 300 proteins responsible for active transport and facilitated diffusion called the Solute carrier family. Other members of this family include SLC45A2, which is responsible for pigmentation variations of many types in humans, as well as the cream coat color in horses; and SLC24A5, which is responsible for the &quot;Golden&quot; dilution in mice.

Dilution genes such as champagne and cream affect the nature or density of the pigments produced by melanocytes. On the other hand, genes in horses which produce white spotting, such as Frame and Sabino1, interrupt or limit the migration of melanocytes from the neural crest. In other words, the skin, eyes, and hair of horses with the champagne mutation do not lack melanocytes, melanosomes, or melanins, but rather exhibit hypomelanism. However, the specific role of &quot;SLC36A1&quot; in pigmentation and how the champagne coat colors are created on a molecular level is not known. The researchers who identified the mutation in 2008 suggested that melanosome pH may be affected, which in turn might affect the processing of tyrosine, a critical element of melanogenesis.

There are two alleles in this series: the recessive, wildtype allele &quot;ch&quot; and the dominant &quot;CH&quot;. The &quot;CH&quot; allele represents the T63R &quot;SLC36A1&quot; mutation.
* &quot;ch/ch&quot; recessive homozygotes are not affected by champagne and have no true champagne traits.
* &quot;CH/ch&quot; heterozygotes have one champagne allele, and one wildtype non-champagne allele. The skin is bright pink and the eyes bright blue at birth, darkening to freckled and hazel with age, respectively. Both red and black pigment in the hair are diluted.
* &quot;CH/CH&quot; homozygotes (homozygous champagnes) have no wildtype non-champagne alleles. Such horses are indistinguishable from heterozygotes, except that their freckles may slightly sparser and the coat slightly lighter.

The DNA test for champagne detects the c.188C&gt;G mutation on &quot;SLC36A1&quot;.

<text>Stéphane Chapuisat (born 28 June 1969) is a Swiss former professional footballer who played as a striker. He is regarded as one of the best strikers Borussia Dortmund ever had.

A prolific goalscorer for both club and country (for which he appeared more than 100 times), he spent most of his career with Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund. He represented Switzerland at the 1994 World Cup and two European Championships.

Chapuisat is currently the sporting director of BSC Young Boys.

==Club career==
Born in Lausanne, Chapuisat started his professional career with hometown club FC Lausanne-Sport, moving in January 1991 to Bundesliga&#x27;s Bayer Uerdingen and switching to powerhouse Borussia Dortmund in that summer.

Chapuisat scored 20 league goals in his first season, two short of &quot;Torjäger&quot; Fritz Walter of the eventual champions VfB Stuttgart. He stayed with Borussia until 1999, conquering back-to-back titles – although he played sparingly in 1995–96 due to injuries – and adding the following campaign&#x27;s UEFA Champions League, where he netted three in ten games during the victorious run.

Chapuisat then transferred to Grasshopper Club Zürich, playing there for three years and helped them winning the league title in 2001. In 2002, he moved to fellow Swiss Super League side BSC Young Boys, before rejoining Lausanne now in the second division, retiring at 37 with 106 goals in 228 Bundesliga matches to his credit; he was also voted Swiss Footballer of the Year four times (1992, 1993, 1994 and 2001).

In November 2003, to celebrate UEFA&#x27;s Jubilee, Chapuisat was selected as the Golden Player of Switzerland by the Swiss Football Association as their most outstanding player of the past 50 years.

==International career==
Chapuisat scored 21 goals in 103 caps for Switzerland, and played in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 1996 and Euro 2004.

In the 1994 World Cup, appearing in four complete contests as the nation reached the round-of-16, he scored in a 4–1 win over Romania on 22 June.

==Personal life==
Chapuisat&#x27;s father, Pierre-Albert, was also a professional footballer. A defender, he too represented Lausanne and the national team, going on to have a lengthy career as a manager.

<text>In the philosophy of mind, innatism is the view that the mind is born with already-formed ideas, knowledge, and beliefs. The opposing doctrine, that the mind is a &quot;tabula rasa&quot; (blank slate) at birth and all knowledge is gained from experience and the senses, is called empiricism. 

== Difference from nativism ==

&quot;Innatism&quot; and &quot;nativism&quot; are generally synonymous terms referring to the notion of preexisting ideas in the mind. However, more specifically, innatism refers to the philosophy of Descartes, who assumed that God or a similar being or process placed innate ideas and principles in the human mind. The innatist principles in this regard may overlap with similar concepts such as natural order and state of nature, in philosophy. 

Nativism represents an adaptation of this, grounded in the fields of genetics, cognitive psychology, and psycholinguistics. Nativists hold that innate beliefs are in some way genetically programmed in our mind—they are the phenotypes of certain genotypes that all humans share in common. Nativism is a modern view rooted in innatism. The advocates of nativism are mainly philosophers who also work in the field of cognitive psychology or psycholinguistics: most notably Noam Chomsky and Jerry Fodor (although the latter adopted a more critical attitude toward nativism in his later writings). The nativist&#x27;s general objection against empiricism is still the same as was raised by the rationalists; the human mind of a newborn child is not a &quot;tabula rasa&quot; but is equipped with an inborn structure.

== History ==
Although individual human beings vary in many ways (culturally, ethnically, linguistically, and so on), innate ideas are the same for everyone everywhere. For example, the philosopher René Descartes theorized that knowledge of God is innate in everybody. Philosophers such as Descartes and Plato were rationalists. Other philosophers, most notably the empiricists, were critical of innate ideas and denied they existed. 

The debate over innate ideas is central to the conflict between rationalists (who believe certain ideas exist independently of experience) and empiricists (who believe knowledge is derived from experience).

Many believe the German philosopher Immanuel Kant synthesized these two early modern traditions in his philosophical thought.

=== Plato ===
Plato argues that if there are certain concepts that we know to be true but did not learn from experience, then it must be because we have an innate knowledge of it and that this knowledge must have been gained before birth. In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Meno&quot;, he recalls a situation where his mentor Socrates questioned a slave boy about geometry. Though the slave boy had no previous experience with geometry, he was able to answer correctly. Plato reasoned that this was possible because Socrates&#x27; questions sparked the innate knowledge of math the boy had from birth.

=== Descartes ===
Descartes conveys the idea that innate knowledge or ideas is something inborn such as one would say, that a certain disease might be &#x27;innate&#x27; to signify that a person might be at risk of contracting such a disease. He suggests that something that is &#x27;innate&#x27; is effectively present from birth and while it may not reveal itself then, is more than likely to present itself later in life. Descartes’ comparison of innate knowledge to an innate disease, whose symptoms may show up only later in life, unless prohibited by a factor like age or puberty, suggests that if an event occurs prohibiting someone from exhibiting an innate behaviour or knowledge, it doesn&#x27;t mean the knowledge did not exist at all but rather it wasn&#x27;t expressed – they were not able to acquire that knowledge. In other words, innate beliefs, ideas and knowledge require experiences to be triggered or they may never be expressed. Experiences are not the source of knowledge as proposed by John Locke, but catalysts to the uncovering of knowledge.

=== Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz ===
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz suggested that we are born with certain innate ideas, the most identifiable of these being mathematical truisms. The idea that is evident to us without the necessity for empirical evidence. Leibniz argues that empiricism can show us show that concepts are true in the present; the observation of one apple and then another in one instance, and in that instance only, leads to the conclusion that one and another equals two. However, the suggestion that one and another will always equal two requires an innate idea, as that would be a suggestion of things unwitnessed.

Leibniz called such concepts as mathematical truisms &quot;necessary truths&quot;. Another example of such may be the phrase, &quot;What is, is&quot; or &quot;It is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be&quot;. Leibniz argues that such truisms are universally assented to (acknowledged by all to be true); this being the case, it must be due to their status as innate ideas. Often some ideas are acknowledged as necessarily true but are not universally assented to. Leibniz would suggest that this is simply because the person in question has not become aware of the innate idea, not because they do not possess it. Leibniz argues that empirical evidence can serve to bring to the surface certain principles that are already innately embedded in our minds. This is similar to needing to hear only the first few notes to recall the rest of the melody.

=== John Locke ===
The main antagonist to the concept of innate ideas is John Locke, a contemporary of Leibniz. Locke argued that the mind is in fact devoid of all knowledge or ideas at birth; it is a blank sheet or &quot;tabula rasa&quot;. He argued that all our ideas are constructed in the mind via a process of constant composition and decomposition of the input that we receive through our senses.

Locke, in &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot;, suggests that the concept of universal assent in fact proves nothing, except perhaps that everyone is in agreement; in short universal assent proves that there is universal assent and nothing else. Moreover, Locke goes on to suggest that in fact there &quot;is&quot; no universal assent. Even a phrase such as &quot;What is, is&quot; is not universally assented to; infants and severely mentally disabled adults do not generally acknowledge this truism. Locke also attacks the idea that an innate idea can be imprinted on the mind without the owner realizing it. For Locke, such reasoning would allow one to conclude the absurd: &quot;All the Truths a Man ever comes to know, will, by this account, be, every one of them, innate.&quot; To return to the musical analogy, we may not be able to recall the entire melody until we hear the first few notes, but we were aware of the fact that we knew the melody and that upon hearing the first few notes we would be able to recall the rest.

Locke ends his attack upon innate ideas by suggesting that the mind is a &quot;tabula rasa&quot; or &quot;blank slate&quot;, and that all ideas come from experience; all our knowledge is founded in sensory experience.

Essentially, the same knowledge thought to be &quot;a priori&quot; by Leibniz is, according to Locke, the result of empirical knowledge, which has a lost origin [been forgotten] in respect to the inquirer. However, the inquirer is not cognizant of this fact; thus, he experiences what he believes to be &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge.

# The theory of innate knowledge is excessive. Even innatists accept that most of our knowledge is learned through experience, but if that can be extended to account for all knowledge, we learn color through seeing it, so therefore, there is no need for a theory about an innate understanding of color.
# No ideas are universally held. Do we all possess the idea of God? Do we all believe in justice and beauty? Do we all understand the law of identity? If not, it may not be the case that we have acquired these ideas through impressions/experience/social interaction.
# Even if there are some universally agreed statements, it is just the ability of the human brain to organize learned ideas/words, that is, innate. An &quot;ability to organize&quot; is not the same as &quot;possessing propositional knowledge&quot; (e.g., a computer with no saved files has all the operations programmed in but has an empty memory).

== Contemporary approaches ==

=== Linguistics ===
In his &quot;Meno&quot;, Plato raises an important epistemological quandary: How is it that we have certain ideas that are not conclusively derivable from our environments? Noam Chomsky has taken this problem as a philosophical framework for the scientific inquiry into innatism. His linguistic theory, which derives from 18th century classical-liberal thinkers such as Wilhelm von Humboldt, attempts to explain in cognitive terms how we can develop knowledge of systems which are said, by supporters of innatism, to be too rich and complex to be derived from our environment. One such example is our linguistic faculty. Our linguistic systems contain a systemic complexity which supposedly could not be empirically derived: the environment seems too poor, variable and indeterminate, according to Chomsky, to explain the extraordinary ability to learn complex concepts possessed by very young children. Essentially, their accurate grammatical knowledge cannot have originated from their experiences as their experiences are not adequate. It follows that humans must be born with a universal innate grammar, which is determinate and has a highly organized directive component, and enables the language learner to ascertain and categorize language heard into a system. Chomsky states that the ability to learn how to properly construct sentences or know which sentences are grammatically incorrect is an ability gained from innate knowledge. Noam Chomsky cites as evidence for this theory, the apparent invariability, according to his views, of human languages at a fundamental level. In this way, linguistics may provide a window into the human mind, and establish scientific theories of innateness which otherwise would remain merely speculative.

One implication of Noam Chomsky&#x27;s innatism, if correct, is that at least a part of human knowledge consists in cognitive predispositions, which are triggered and developed by the environment, but not determined by it. Chomsky suggests that we can look at how a belief is acquired as an input-output situation. He supports the doctrine of innatism as he states that human beliefs gathered from sensory experience are much richer and complex than the experience itself. He asserts that the extra information gathered is from the mind itself as it cannot solely be from experiences. Humans derive excess amount of information from their environment so some of that information must be pre-determined.

<doc id="1287241" wikidata="Q367958" url="?curid=1287241" title="Busby (military headdress)">
<text>Busby is the English name for the Hungarian (&#x27;fur shako&#x27;) or , a military head-dress made of fur, originally worn by Hungarian hussars. In its original Hungarian form the busby was a cylindrical fur cap, having a bag of coloured cloth hanging from the top. This bag could be filled with sand and the end attached to the right shoulder as a defence against sabre cuts.

==History==
The popularity of the military headdress in its hussar form reached a height in the years immediately before World War I (1914–1918). It was widely worn in the Belgian (Guides and field artillery), British (hussars, yeomanry, and horse artillery), Dutch (cavalry and artillery), Italian (light cavalry) German (hussars), Russian (hussars), Serbian (Royal Guard) and Spanish (hussars and mounted &quot;cazadores&quot;) armies. Several armies have continued to use the headdress as a part of their full dress uniforms.

There were some variations in the materials of which cavalry busbies were made. Russian Cossacks of the Imperial Guard used black sheepskin, Guard Hussars dark brown long-haired fur, and line Hussars black lambswool. All but one of the twenty Prussian Hussar regiments wore sealskin busbies dyed in black, while their officers favoured dark brown otter-skin. The Brunswick Hussar Regiment No. 17 had the distinction of being issued busbies made of bearskin.

With the general conversion of British Light Dragoon regiments to hussars during the 19th century the cloth busby bag with its braided edgings became a useful means of regimental distinction. By 1900 busby bags of red, crimson, blue, white and French grey were being worn by different regiments.

Officers of the Royal Air Force were authorised to wear a distinctive form of busby as an optional part of their ceremonial uniforms from 1920 to 1939. This headdress was reintroduced only for the RAF Band in 1976 before being finally withdrawn in 2011.

==Etymology==
Possibly the name&#x27;s original sense of a &quot;busby wig&quot; came from association with Richard Busby, headmaster of Westminster School in the late seventeenth century; the phrase &quot;buzz wig&quot; may have supplied the derivation for busby. An alternative explanation is that the British hussar cap of the early 19th century was named after the hatter who supplied the officer&#x27;s version—W. Busby of the Strand London.

==Modern use by country==
===Canada===
The Canadian Forces dress instructions authorise the busby as a part of the full dress uniform for hussars, artillery and rifle regiments.

===Netherlands===
The historic busby is still worn by ceremonial detachments of the Dutch Hussars and Royal Gendarmerie () in full dress uniform.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom busbies are of two kinds: (a) the hussar busby, cylindrical in shape, with a bag and cap lines (cords to connect the cap to the tunic); this is worn by hussars and the Royal Horse Artillery; (b) the rifle busby, a folding cap of astrakhan (curly lambswool) formerly worn by rifle regiments, in shape somewhat resembling a Glengarry but taller. Both have straight plumes in the front of the headdress. The headdress is worn with full dress by the Waterloo Band of The Rifles, the Royal Horse Artillery and ceremonial detachments at regimental expense. In its hussar version it is now made of black nylon fur, although Bandmasters still retain the original animal fur. The busby should not be mistaken for the much taller bearskin cap, worn most notably by the five regiments of Foot Guards of the Household Division (Grenadier, Coldstream, Scots, Irish and Welsh Guards). Around 1900 the word &quot;busby&quot; was used colloquially to denote the tall bear and racoonskin &quot;caps&quot; worn by foot guards and fusiliers and the feather bonnets of Highland infantry. This usage is now obsolete.

<text>Karl Theodor Hartweg (18 June 1812 – 3 February 1871) was a German botanist. He collected numerous new species of plants in Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico and California in the United States, collecting for the London Horticultural Society. Many of the species he discovered were formally published, with attribution, by George Gordon, the Foreman of the London Horticultural Society Gardens and a specialist in the conifers which were well represented in Hartweg&#x27;s collections.

Many plants collected in Mexico by Hartweg from 1836 onward were identified and catalogued by George Bentham in &quot;Plantas Hartwegianas&quot;.

<doc id="1287254" wikidata="Q994133" url="?curid=1287254" title="Mana Island (New Zealand)">
<text>Mana Island is the smaller of two islands that lie off the southwest coast of the North Island of New Zealand (the larger is Kapiti Island). The name of the Island is an abbreviation of the Maori name &quot;Te Mana o Kupe&quot;, which means &quot;The Mana of Kupe&quot;.

Mana Island is a long, table, with cliffs along much of its coast and a plateau occupying much of the interior. It lies off the North Island coast in the Tasman Sea, west of the city of Porirua and south of the entrance to Porirua Harbour. In 2009, it was selected by the Global Restoration Network as one of New Zealand&#x27;s top 25 sites for ecological restoration. Although a wildlife sanctuary, and thus with no permanent human population, the island is officially defined as a suburb of Porirua City.

==History==
Mana was settled by Māori from the 14th century. In the early 1820s, the Ngāti Toa iwi, led by Te Rauparaha established bases on Mana.

European occupation began 1830s with a whaling station, and bush was cleared for an early sheep farm. A lighthouse was built to the north in 1863, but shipwrecks were caused due to confusion between this light and Pencarrow light at the entrance to Wellington Harbour, a new lighthouse was constructed on the summit of North Brother Island and the lighthouse was removed to Cape Egmont in Taranaki, where it still stands. It became Crown property in 1865 and was subsequently leased to J. F. E. Wright of Wellington.

=== The Vella family===
In 1886 Mariano Vella obtained a sublease of Mana from Wright. He knew little of farming, and arranged that Harry Harris of Pauatahanui would teach him sheep husbandry and farming practice. The Vella family lived in Station Road at Paremata, while Mariano sailed to and from the island on most days. At first he devoted his energy to stocking the island&#x27;s with sheep. The Mana Island lighthouse, built in 1864 and discontinued in 1877, had been shifted to Cape Egmont. Mariano Vella bought one remaining keeper&#x27;s cottage, dismantled it and rebuilt it close to an existing store shed on the eastern side of the island. In 1887 he built a small woolshed that still stands. At shearing time Mary and the children would come across to live at Mana. The life of the family was shattered when Mary died of a heart attack on 22 December 1889 at the age of 20.

Mariano Vella continued with his development of Mana. Wright had found it difficult to farm there profitably, but Vella, with his native skill in handling boats and his newly acquired experience of farming, was able to manage the island farm very effectively. In 1894 he visited Dalmatia and on 3 September that year married Elizabetta Caterina Tarabochia at Lussinpiccolo on the small island of Lussin (Lošinj) in the Adriatic Sea. The couple returned to New Zealand, and for the last part of their voyage travelled from Sydney to Auckland on the Wairarapa. The ship was wrecked on Great Barrier Island on 29 October 1894 with the loss of 121 lives; Mariano and Elizabetta reached the shore but all their possessions were lost.

The head-lease of Mana expired in December 1893 and when a 14-year lease was auctioned in 1894 Mariano Vella was the successful bidder, as he was again in 1908 and in 1922. He and Elizabetta (known in New Zealand as Elizabeth) raised a family of two girls, Mattea and Antonia (Anne), and two boys, Giovanni (Jack) and Mariano junior. Such was Mariano Vella&#x27;s success as a farmer that in 1909 he was able to retire. He and Elizabetta returned to her home on Lussin, on a visit that lasted six years. Mattea went with them and attended school there and in Gorizia, Italy, before the family came back to New Zealand in 1915. The family then moved to Plimmerton and lived in a large two-storeyed house close to the sea. Andrew and William, the two eldest sons, both farmed Mana for a time but eventually the management and the lease passed to Andrew who held it until his death in 1951. The lease was transferred from the Vella family to John Gault in 1953.

In June 1972 three scientists from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research visited the island and made an inventory of the fauna and flora on the island.

In 1973 the government purchased the lease from the Gault family in order to allow the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) to establish a branch of the Ruakura research station on the island. The intention was to use it to undertake research on imported exotic sheep breeds (which could be kept quarantined on the island) with the objective of improving the quality of the country&#x27;s sheep flock. More than $2 million dollars was invested in the construction of a research laboratory, a new woolshed, hay barns, a mating shed, equipment buildings, accommodation and diesel generators to provide electricity, while two windmills were installed to pump ground up the surface.

By 1976 the sheep population had grown to 2,500 when on 28 September of that year a suspected scrapie (a very contagious and debilitating condition) was detected. An estimated 280 sheep were slaughtered, burnt and buried. After another suspected outbreak of scrapie in 1979 all 2,000 of the sheep on the island were slaughtered and the facility abandoned. For the next five years a strict quarantine was imposed on the island by the Lands and Survey Department, who following the departure of the research staff had sole responsibility for the island. They established a cattle farm on the island in order to use bulls to keep the grass down in order to reduce the fire risk. Restrictions still remained in place as to who and what could both visit and be taken of the island.

Following a land-use study a proposal was made in 1986 by the Lands and Survey Department for the island to be reverted for conservation purposes to bush and forest. This was agreed to and the remaining livestock was removed. In 1987 the island was designated as a scientific reserve and its ownership transferred to the New Zealand Department of Conservation (DOC).

Ownership of the island, and nearby Kapiti Island, reverted to the Ngāti Toa iwi on 31 December 2024 under a Treaty of Waitangi settlement.

==Conservation==
In 1987 the first takahē were introduced to the island. Following a proposal by the Wellington branch of the Forest &amp; Bird Society a seven month long eradication program (which began in July 1989) removed all mice from the island. Following its completion the first tree planting began, with over 500,000 trees being planted so far by volunteers, with the peak year being 1996 when approximately 30,000 were planted. Subsequently, a wetland on the island was restored and several threatened bird, lizard and plant species translocated to Mana.

Five-minute bird counts made before and after mouse eradication showed an increase in 13 of the island&#x27;s 22 bird species, particularly amongst insect-eating passerine birds, with whom the mice were presumably competing for food.

A ranger from DOC lives on the island, which has its own native plant nursery, electric generator and boat shed. The DOC staff haul their boat out of the water up a ramp with a winch. Some structures on the island provide habitat for native animals; for example, little penguins roost under the old woolshed.

===Habitat restoration===
The restoration program has been characterised by a high level of community involvement, led by groups such as the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand, the Friends of Mana Island, tramping clubs and school children. This effort has resulted in it being selected as one of the top ecological restoration projects in Australasia by the Global Ecological Restoration Network.

Seedlings from a radius of the island are brought to the plant nursery where they are raised until ready for planting out. Although over half a million native plants have been established under a planting programme, two-thirds of island will remain in grass and coastal shrublands. Planting has been mostly in gullies and sheltered parts of the island, which experiences strong winds. The strategy has been to plant native shrubs in connecting corridors. This suits most bird life and allows for natural regeneration. The plantings have been mainly of hardy pioneer species best able to withstand the rigorous conditions. When there has been enough shelter established, the forest area will be inter-planted with a variety of less robust species to establish a typical Wellington coastal forest.

===Animals===
The island is a scientific reserve holding many native animals and plants that are rare on the mainland. Notable species on the island include the Cook Strait giant wētā, shore plover, North Island robin, takahē, Wellington green gecko, yellow-crowned parakeet, and brown teal. The most recent example is the critically endangered Wellington speargrass weevil from the Wellington South Coast in 2006.

The Department of Conservation and the Friends group also collaborated on a five-year program to establish the threatened tūturuatu / shore plover on the island. The birds, of which only about 200 remain in the wild, were sourced from a captive population at the Pūkaha / Mount Bruce National Wildlife Centre. A rat exterminated the population in 2011 and another attempt at reintroduction in 2020 failed after attacks by a kārearea/New Zealand falcon.

Mana Island was formerly home to translocated kākāpō. After the kākāpō recovery plan was established in 1995, one of the first actions was to move kākāpō to the island. The last two males found on Stewart Island were moved to the island. Both of the males released onto the island died, suggesting that the island may not be suitable for the kākāpō. However, the birds were also at an extremely light weight when moved to the island, which might have been a factor.

Planned projects include the transfer to the island of a wide range of other species, many of which are rare and endangered. Notable amongst these will be the tuatara, the little spotted kiwi, a subspecies of the carnivorous &quot;Powelliphanta&quot; snail, and a range of threatened plants endemic to the Wellington Region.

====Seabirds====
Recent projects have included the successful translocations to the island of diving-petrels, fairy prions and fluttering shearwater chicks, with the progeny of several transferees later successfully fledging – the first to do so on Mana Island for many centuries. These species are an important part of the restoration of the island because of their nutrient inflows (free fertiliser) and the habitats their burrows provide for reptiles and invertebrates. The seabird translocation techniques perfected on Mana Island are being used with rare and endangered species elsewhere in New Zealand, such as the Chatham Island taiko, Chatham petrel and Hutton&#x27;s shearwater.

Gannets formerly nested on Mana Island. From 1998, after mice were eliminated, conservationists have attempted to restart a colony, using a false colony of birds made of concrete, and installing sound systems that make gannet sounds, in the hope that real ones will be attracted to nest there. A male gannet, nicknamed Nigel, arrived in 2015 and over the next two years courted one of the concrete decoys. A second male gannet, nicknamed Norman, resided on Mana Island during 2017. In January 2018, three gannets settled on the island. In February 2018, Nigel died. The same combination of techniques is showing good results in a similar project at Young Nick&#x27;s Head, near Gisborne.

==Geology==
Mana Island is unusual compared to both Kapiti Island and the nearby mainland, in that it is topped by a plateau rather than rolling hills. The plateau slopes gently to the south-east, with deeply-incised valleys on the eastern half and cliffs on the north and west sides. There is no clear evidence to correlate the plateau with any equivalent feature on the mainland; continuity of features is unlikely owing to the earthquake faults that lie between the island and the mainland. It has been suggested that the plateau is the remains of a marine bench from which all overlying material has long since eroded.

<text>Psychological functions, as described by Carl Jung in his book &quot;Psychological Types&quot;, are particular mental processes within a person&#x27;s psyche that are present regardless of common circumstances. This is a concept that serves as one of the foundations for his theory on personality type. In his book, he noted four main psychological functions: &quot;thinking&quot;, &quot;feeling&quot;, &quot;sensation,&quot; and &quot;intuition&quot;. He introduced them with having either an internally focused (&quot;introverted&quot;) or externally focused (&quot;extraverted&quot;) tendency which he called &quot;attitude&quot;. He also categorizes the functions as either &quot;rational&quot; (thinking and feeling) or &quot;irrational&quot; (intuition and sensation).

== Psychological functions and attitudes ==

The four psychological functions may be subjugated to the control of consciousness, which can take two attitudes:
* Extraversion: &quot;a strong, if not exclusive, determination by the object.&quot; Consciously, in an extravert, the four basic cognitive functions follow the extraverted &#x27;general attitude of consciousness&#x27;: &quot;Now, when the orientation to the object and to objective facts is so predominant that the most frequent and essential decisions and actions are determined, not by subjective values but by objective relations, one speaks of an extraverted attitude. When this is habitual, one speaks of an extraverted type. If a man so thinks, feels, and acts, in a word so lives, as to correspond directly with objective conditions and their claims, whether in a good sense or ill, he is extraverted.&quot;
* Introversion: &quot;a turning inwards of the libido, whereby a negative relation of subject to object is expressed. Interest does not move towards the object, but recedes towards the subject.&quot; Consciously, in an introvert, the four basic cognitive functions follow the introverted &#x27;general attitude of consciousness&#x27;. &quot;Everyone whose attitude is introverted thinks, feels, and acts in a way that clearly demonstrates that the subject is the chief factor of motivation while the object at most receives only a secondary value.&quot;

The difference between extraversion and introversion comes from the source of the decisive factor in forming motivation and developing ideas, whether it is objective (i.e., the external environment) or subjective (experienced within the mind, or &quot;processes inherent in the psyche&quot;). When discussing function types, Jung ascribed movements of the libido in both directions for each function in each function type, with one direction being that final judge.

To summarize Jung&#x27;s views, as discussed in &quot;Psychological Types&quot; and maintained until his death, Jung posited that each individual follows a &quot;general attitude of consciousness&quot; where every conscious act is directed by the tendency to follow introversion for introverts and extraversion for extraverts. Jung&#x27;s definition of the general attitude was not to limit the individual from experiencing the opposing attitude but to offer &quot;decisive determination&quot;. The primary, or most developed, differentiated, and conscious function, is entirely positioned in the service of the conscious attitude of introversion or extraversion, but even if all other functions can be conscious and made to follow the general attitude, they are of less differentiation and are hence strongly affected by the opposing attitude of the unconscious. Later in the book, Jung describes the auxiliary function as being capable of some significant development or differentiation if it remains less differentiated from that of the primary. His views on the primary and auxiliary functions, both being of enough differentiation to be considered conscious and set aside with the primary as opposed to the most inferior two functions, can be noted as early as psychological Types.

The four basic psychological functions—thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuition—are &quot;basic functions&quot; that can be briefly defined as follows.

=== Thinking ===
According to Jung, thinking is &quot;that psychological function which, in accordance with its own laws, brings given presentations into conceptual connection&quot;. Jung said that the thinking function should be delegated solely to &#x27;active thinking&#x27; in contrast to &#x27;passive thinking&#x27;. According to him, active thinking uses concepts to connect information, which is considered judgement as a result. He writes that passive thinking &quot;lacks any sense of direction&quot;, since it is not in accordance with an aim. He refers to it as &#x27;intuitive thinking&#x27; instead.

Later, some interpreted Jung&#x27;s extraverted thinking and introverted thinking to mean something other than the function of thought as represented by extraverts and introverts respectively. In Adler and Hull&#x27;s translation of Jung&#x27;s &quot;Psychological Types&quot;, Jung states:

&quot;Apart from the qualities I have mentioned, the undeveloped functions possess the further peculiarity that, when the conscious attitude is introverted, they are extraverted and vice versa. One could therefore expect to find extraverted feelings in an introverted intellectual...&quot;

====Extraverted thinking ====
Extraverted thinking is a thinking function that is &quot;objective&quot; (being extraverted). Extraverted thinking often places information, such as facts in high order; it is a process that is concerned with organisation and hierarchy of phenomena.

&quot;In accordance with his definition, we must picture a man whose constant aim—in so far, of course, as he is a [p. 435] pure type—is to bring his total life activities into relation to intellectual conclusions, which in the last resort are always oriented by objective data, whether objective facts or generally valid ideas. This type of man gives the deciding voice—not merely for himself alone but also on behalf of his entourage—either to the actual objective reality or to its objectively oriented, intellectual formula. By this formula, good and evil are measured, and beauty and ugliness determined. All is right that corresponds with this formula; all is wrong that contradicts it; and everything that is neutral to it is purely accidental.&quot;

====Introverted thinking ====
Introverted thinking is the thinking function that is &quot;subjective&quot; (being introverted). The nature of introverted thinking means that it is primarily concerned with its &quot;subjective idea&quot; and insights gained by formulation over facts and objective data. Whereas extraverted thinking is most like Empiricism, introverted Thinking is most similar to Rationalism.

&quot;Just as Darwin might possibly represent the normal extraverted thinking type, we might point to Kant as a counter-example of the normal introverted thinking type. The former speaks with facts; the latter appeals to the subjective factor. Darwin ranges over the wide fields of objective facts, while Kant restricts himself to a critique of knowledge in general. But suppose a Cuvier be contrasted with a Nietzsche: the antithesis becomes even sharper.&quot;

&quot;The introverted thinking type is characterized by a priority of the thinking I have just described. Like his [p. 485] extraverted parallel, he is decisively influenced by ideas; these, however, have their origins not in the objective data but in the subjective foundation. Like the extravert, he too will follow his ideas, but in the reverse direction: inwardly, not outwardly. Intensity is his aim, not extensity. In these fundamental characters, he differs markedly, indeed quite unmistakably, from his extraverted parallel. Like every introverted type, he is almost completely lacking in that which distinguishes his counter type, namely, the intensive relatedness to the object.&quot;

===Feeling===
Jung defined feeling as &quot;primarily a process that takes place between the ego and a given content, a process, moreover, that imparts to the content a definite value in the sense of acceptance or rejection [...] Hence, feeling is also a kind of judging, differing, however, from an intellectual judgment in that it does not aim at establishing an intellectual connection but is solely concerned with the setting up of a subjective criterion of acceptance or rejection.&quot; Also, Jung made distinctions between feeling as a judging function and emotions (affect): &quot;Feeling is distinguished from affect by the fact that it gives rise to no perceptible physical innervation&#x27;s.&quot; Von Franz wrote that there are &quot;clichés&quot; with regard to the feeling function, which are that musicians and people with &quot;good eros&quot; are feeling types. She also wrote that another cliché was the notion that women are better at feeling &quot;just because they are women&quot;.
Later, some interpreted Jung&#x27;s extraverted feeling and introverted feeling to mean something other than the function of feeling as represented in extraverts and introverts respectively.

==== Extraverted feeling ====
Overall, extraverted feeling is concerned with phenomena being harmonious with their external environment. Jung writes of extraverted feelers as those where feeling &quot;loses its personal character—it becomes feeling per se; it almost seems as though the personality were wholly dissolved in the feeling of the moment. Now, since actual life situations constantly and successively alternate, in which the feeling-tones released are not only different but are actually mutually contrasting, the personality inevitably becomes dissipated in just so many different feelings.&quot;

==== Introverted feeling ====
Introverted feeling is &quot;very hard to elucidate since so little of it is openly displayed.&quot; Jung writes of feeling in introverted feelers: &quot;[Introverted feeling] is continually seeking an image which has no existence in reality but which it has seen in a kind of vision. It glides over all objects that do not fit in with its aim. It strives for inner intensity, for which the objects serve at most as a stimulus. The depth of this feeling can only be guessed—it can never be clearly grasped. It makes people silent and difficult to access; it shrinks back like a violet from the brute nature of the object in order to fill the depths of the subject. It comes out with negative judgments or assumes an air of profound indifference as a means of defense.&quot; Introverted feelings can therefore be thought of as subjective, personal feeling-values and primordial images, that the person protects and defends against the thoughts and judgements of others.

===Sensation===
Jung presented sensation as &quot;that psychological function that transmits a physical stimulus to perception. [...] not only to the outer stimuli but also to the inner, i.e., to changes in the internal organs. Primarily, therefore, sensation is sense-perception, i.e., perception transmitted via the sense organs and &#x27;bodily senses&#x27; (kinaesthetic, vaso-motor sensation, etc.).&quot; Also, since the process of conscious perception is a psychological phenomenon representing a physical phenomenon, and not the physical phenomenon itself, he adds: &quot;On the one hand, it is an element of presentation, since it transmits to the presenting function the perceived image of the outer object; on the other hand, it is an element of feeling, because through the perception of bodily changes it lends the character of affect to feeling.&quot;

==== Extraverted sensation ====
Extraverted sensation is the sensing function that perceives sensations from the external world in an objective manner. For example, since an extraverted sensor type&#x27;s source of reward gravitates around perceiving and feeling external phenomena, he often has a good sense of aesthetics—whether this be the taste of food or a new trend in clothing. Extraverted sensors may be more attuned to spatial awareness and physical reality. Note that a bodily sensation is still considered extraverted sensing, as the sensation is being perceived in objective reality. For example, drinking caffeine will objectively create a stimulating sensation in the person&#x27;s physiology. This is contrasted to the subjective sensor, who may be concerned with a subjective response to the same drink (e.g., nostalgia that is tied to that specific cup of coffee, or whether or not they prefer the flavor).

==== Introverted sensation ====
Introverted sensation is the sensing function that perceives phenomena in such a way as extraverted sensation does above, but in a subjective manner. Jung wrote that &quot;the subject perceives the same things as everybody else; he never stops at the purely objective effect but concerns himself with the subjective perception released by the objective stimulus. Subjective perception differs remarkably from the objective. It is either not found at all in the object or, at most, merely suggested by it[...] Subjective sensation apprehends the background of the physical world rather than its surface. The decisive thing is not the reality of the object but the reality of the subjective factor, i.e., the primordial images, which in their totality represent a psychic mirror world. It is a mirror, however, with the peculiar capacity of representing the present contents of consciousness not in their known and customary form but in a certain sense sub specie aeternitatis, somewhat as a million-year old consciousness might see them. Such a consciousness would see the becoming and the passing of things beside their present and momentary existence, and not only that, but at the same time it would also see that Other, which was before their becoming and will be after their passing hence.&quot;

Introverted sensation also perceives things in a very detailed manner, as per Emma Jung.

===Intuition ===
Intuition is also presented as a basic psychological function, as hunches and visions provide an alternative means of perception to sensation. &quot;It is that psychological function that transmits perceptions in an unconscious way. Everything, whether outer or inner objects or their associations, can be the object of this perception. Intuition has this peculiar quality: it is neither sensation nor feeling, nor intellectual conclusion, although it may appear in any of these forms.&quot;

==== Extraverted intuition ====

Extraverted intuition takes in intuitive information from the world around. Whereas introverted intuition refers to Jung&#x27;s idea of the collective unconscious, extraverted intuition is concerned with the collective conscious. People with high extraverted intuition are attuned to current events, media, trends, and developments. The collective unconscious sees the world in terms of primordial archetypes such as The Hero, The Sage, the outlaw, etc. The collective conscious used by the Extraverted Intuitive, however, sees archetypes reflected through the subcultures, celebrities, organizations, events, and ideas of their times.

==== Introverted intuition ====
Introverted intuition is the intuition that acts in an introverted and, thus, subjective manner. Jung wrote: &quot;Intuition, in the introverted attitude, is directed upon the inner object, a term we might justly apply to the elements of the unconscious. The relation of inner objects to consciousness is entirely analogous to that of outer objects, although theirs is a psychological and not a physical reality. Inner objects appear to the intuitive perception as subjective images of things, which, though not met with in external experience, really determine the contents of the unconscious, i.e., the collective unconscious, in the last resort. [...] Although this intuition may receive its impetus from outer objects, it is never arrested by external possibilities but stays with the factor that the outer object releases within. [...] 
Introverted intuition apprehends the images that arise a priori, i.e., the inherited foundations of the unconscious mind. These archetypes, whose innermost nature is inaccessible to experience, represent the precipitate of psychic functioning of the whole ancestral line, i.e., the heaped-up, or pooled, experiences of organic existence in general, a million times repeated and condensed into types. Hence, in these archetypes all experiences are represented, which since ancient times have happened on this planet. Their archetypal distinctness is more marked, the more frequently and intensely they have been experienced. The archetype would be—to borrow from Kant—the noumenon of the image which intuition perceives and, in perceiving, creates.&quot;

Jung differentiates between introverted intuition and introverted sensation by writing that introverted sensation is &#x27;confined&#x27; to the perception of events, while introverted intuition instead perceives &quot;the image that has really occasioned the innervation&quot;, repressing its actual qualities. He uses the example of &quot;a psychogenic attack of giddiness,&quot; writing that the sensation will perceive the qualities and sensations of the giddiness without paying attention to the image that caused it. Intuition, on the other hand, does perceive the image that caused it, perceiving it and its course in a very detailed manner rather than the giddiness itself, which is &quot;the image of a tottering man pierced through the heart by an arrow&quot;.

&quot;For intuition, therefore, the unconscious images attain the dignity of things or objects. But, because intuition excludes the cooperation of sensation, it obtains either no knowledge at all or, at best, a very inadequate awareness of the innervation disturbances or of the physical effects produced by the unconscious images. Accordingly, the images appear as though detached from the subject, as though existing in themselves without relation to the person.
Consequently, in the above-mentioned example, the introverted intuitive, when affected by the giddiness, would not imagine that the perceived image might also in some way refer to himself. Naturally, to one who is rationally orientated, such a thing seems almost unthinkable, but it is none the less a fact, and I have often experienced it in my dealings with this type.&quot;

== Myers-Briggs Type Indicator ==

Isabel Myers, an early pioneer of psychometrics, formalized these ideas and proposed that the mixture of types in an individual&#x27;s personality could be measured through responses to a personality test she devised along with her mother, Katharine Cook Briggs, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. In this model, four &quot;dichotomies&quot; are defined, each labelled by two letters (one for each of the opposites in question), as shown by the emboldened letters in the table. Individuals&#x27; personalities fall into sixteen different categories depending on which side of each dichotomy they belong to, labelled by the four applicable letters (for example, an &quot;ENTP&quot; type is someone whose preferences are extraversion, intuition, thinking and perceiving).

== Controversy over attitudes ==

Myers interpreted Jung as saying that the auxiliary, tertiary, and inferior functions are always in the opposite attitude of the dominant, though some views differ. In support of Myers&#x27; (and/or Briggs&#x27;) interpretation, in one sentence Jung seems to state that the &quot;three inferior&quot; functions of an (extreme) extravert are introverted. The &quot;most differentiated function is always employed in an extraverted way, whereas the inferior functions are introverted&quot;.

More recently, typologists such as John Beebe and Linda Berens have introduced theoretical systems in which all people possess eight functions—equivalent to the four functions as defined by Jung and Myers but in each of the two possible attitudes—with the four in the opposite attitude to that measured, known as the &quot;shadow functions&quot;, residing largely in the unconscious.

Furthermore, the evidence given by Myers for the orientation of the auxiliary function relies on the sentence from Jung:

&quot;For all the types met with in practice, the rule holds good that besides the conscious, primary function, there is a relatively unconscious, auxiliary function which is in every respect different from the nature of the primary function.&quot;

But the sentence justifying this interpretation is in fact a mistranslation. Thus rendering this interpretation obsolete. &quot;Unconscious&quot; being in fact &quot;conscious&quot; makes a significant difference, given the importance of these two notions in psychological types. The correct translation is: &quot;For all the types met with in practice, the rule holds good that besides the conscious, primary function, there is a relatively conscious, auxiliary function which is in every respect different from the nature of the primary function.&quot;

== Different models ==

The tables below give different theorists&#x27; ideas about personality types in terms of &quot;cognitive functions&quot;.

=== Carl Jung ===

Carl Jung developed the theory of cognitive processes in his book &quot;Psychological Types,&quot; in which he defined only four psychological functions, which can take introverted or extraverted attitudes, as well as a judging (rational) or perceiving (irrational) attitude determined by the primary function (judging if thinking or feeling, and perceiving if sensation or intuition). He used the terms dominant, auxiliary, and inferior, in which there is one dominant function, two auxiliary functions, and one inferior function. Each individual follows a &quot;general attitude of consciousness&quot; in which the function is conscious. The more conscious a function is, the higher the tendency and potential it has to develop. The less differentiation is hence strongly affected by the opposing attitude of the unconscious and manifest in &quot;happening&quot; to the person and not under conscious control. Therefore, there is a significant difference between Jung and the MBTI regarding the orientation of the functions.

The following table is a summarized model of Jung&#x27;s conception of personality types based on the four functions of introversion, and extraversion.


=== Myers-Briggs Type Indicator ===
The third edition of the &quot;MBTI Manual&quot; lists the types function order according to the table below:

=== John Beebe ===

Though John Beebe has not published a type table, the format that Isabel Myers devised can also be applied to his theory. Beebe describes the different cognitive functions&#x27; role in the overall personality in terms of various mythic archetypes. John Beebe&#x27;s model is based on Jung&#x27;s theory of the collective unconscious, which is not part of the current scientific consensus and may be unfalsifiable.

=== Linda Berens ===

The layout of Linda Berens&#x27;s type table is unique, and her terminology differs from that of Beebe; however, the ordering of cognitive processes in her and Beebe&#x27;s models are the same.

=== Lenore Thomson ===

Lenore Thomson offers yet another model of cognitive functions. In her book, &quot;Personality Type: An Owners Manual&quot;, Thomson advances the hypothesis of a modular relationship between the cognitive functions paralleling left-right brain lateralization. In this approach, the judging functions are in the front-left and back-right brains, and the perception functions are in the back-left and front-right brains. The extraverted functions are in the front of the brain, while the introverted functions are in the back of the brain. The order of the cognitive functions are then determined not by an archetypal hierarchy (as supposed by Beebe) but by an innate brain lateralization preference.

<text>Margaret Ann Farrow (; November 28, 1934 – March 8, 2022) was an American Republican politician from Wisconsin. She was the 42nd lieutenant governor of Wisconsin and the first woman to hold that office. She previously served twelve years in the Wisconsin Senate and two years in the Wisconsin State Assembly. Later in life, she also served as a member of the University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.

Her son, Paul Farrow, also served in the state legislature and is county executive of Waukesha County, Wisconsin.

==Early and personal life==
Farrow was born and raised in Kenosha, Wisconsin. She was the daughter of William Nemitz, who worked at Snap-On Tool Corporation, and Margaret (née Horan) who was a corporate executive assistant. She attended St. Catherine&#x27;s High School in Racine. She then attended Rosary College in River Forest, Illinois, for one year before receiving her B.A. from Marquette University. Farrow was married and had five children.

==Career==

===Elected office (1971–2003)===
Farrow served on the Elm Grove, Wisconsin Board of Appeals from 1971 to 1974 and the Village Board from 1976 to 1987, spending the last five years of her tenure as president. After her time with the Village Board, Farrow was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly, and later the Wisconsin State Senate, from a district comprising most of Waukesha County, Wisconsin. The first female lieutenant governor of Wisconsin, Farrow was appointed to the position after then-Lieutenant Governor Scott McCallum was elevated to the office of governor upon the departure of Gov. Tommy Thompson to join the administration of George W. Bush in January 2001.

As Lieutenant Governor, she served as chair of the Governor&#x27;s Work-Based Learning Board, co-chair of the Governor&#x27;s Task Force on Invasive Species, and chair of the Wisconsin&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Council. Farrow authored and served as vice chair of the SAVE Commission and was appointed by Governor Tommy Thompson to serve on the Governor&#x27;s Blue-Ribbon Commission on State-Local Partnerships for the 21st Century. Farrow also served on the Governor&#x27;s Blue Ribbon Task Force on Passenger Rail.

McCallum and Farrow ran for a full four-year term in 2002, but their Republican ticket lost the race to Democrat Jim Doyle.

===Post-Lieutenant Governor===
Farrow was publicly touted by Mark Neumann as the best candidate to take on Democrat Russ Feingold in 2004. Without putting her name forward for consideration, she won a straw poll at the 2003 Republican State Convention. During the 2008 campaign, she was a member of the &quot;Palin Truth Squad&quot; for the McCain Campaign.

She was chair of the board of directors of WisconsinEye Public Affairs Network, Inc., which produces the Wisconsin equivalent of C-SPAN. In 2010, WCAN (Waukesha County Action Network), the advocacy organization Farrow had created, combined with the Waukesha County Chamber of Commerce to create the Waukesha County Business Alliance, a county-wide chamber of commerce representing over 1,100 member businesses in southeastern Wisconsin. Farrow also served on the Board of Directors as well as the Policy Board of the Waukesha County Business Alliance.

In 2013, she became the inaugural winner of the annual Margaret Thatcher Award, which honored her contributions, courage, and leadership as one of &quot;Wisconsin&#x27;s Iron Ladies&quot;.

Farrow later resided in Pewaukee, Wisconsin with her husband. Her son Paul Farrow was elected Waukesha County Executive in 2015 and previously served in both chambers of the Wisconsin Legislature. In 2013, she was appointed by Governor Scott Walker to serve on the University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents. On December 7, 2017, she announced her immediate retirement from the UW System Board of Regents, stepping down before her term expired in 2020.

Farrow died on March 8, 2022, at the age of 87 at her home in Pewaukee, Wisconsin.

<doc id="1287267" wikidata="Q74963" url="?curid=1287267" title="Teres minor muscle">
<text>The teres minor (Latin &quot;teres&quot; meaning &#x27;rounded&#x27;) is a narrow, elongated muscle of the rotator cuff. The muscle originates from the lateral border and adjacent posterior surface of the corresponding right or left scapula and inserts at both the greater tubercle of the humerus and the posterior surface of the joint capsule.

The primary function of the teres minor is to modulate the action of the deltoid, preventing the humeral head from sliding upward as the arm is abducted. It also functions to rotate the humerus laterally. The teres minor is innervated by the axillary nerve.

==Structure==
It arises from the dorsal surface of the axillary border of the scapula for the upper two-thirds of its extent, and from two aponeurotic laminae, one of which separates it from the infraspinatus muscle, the other from the teres major muscle.

Its fibers run obliquely upwards and laterally; the upper ones end in a tendon which is inserted into the lowest of the three impressions on the greater tubercle of the humerus; the lowest fibers are inserted directly into the humerus immediately below this impression.

A normal anatomical variant of this is a much smaller appearing muscle with an intact tendon. This is referred to as the teres minimis; some literature refer to it as teres micro.

===Relations===
The teres minor originates at the lateral border and adjacent posterior surface of the scapula. It inserts at the greater tubercle of the humerus. The tendon of this muscle passes across, and is united with, the posterior part of the capsule of the shoulder-joint.

===Innervation===
The muscle is innervated by the posterior branch of axillary nerve where it forms a pseudoganglion. A pseudoganglion has no nerve cells but nerve fibres are present. Damage to the fibers innervating the teres minor is clinically significant.

===Variation===
Sometimes a group of muscle fibres from teres minor may be fused with infraspinatus.

==Function==
The infraspinatus and teres minor attach to head of the humerus; as part of the rotator cuff they help hold the humeral head in the glenoid cavity of the scapula. They work in tandem with the posterior deltoid to externally (laterally) rotate the humerus, as well as adduction.
Teres Minor can produce only very small scapular plane adduction during maximal contraction (Hughes RE, An KN 1996) with adductor moment arm of approximately 0.2 cm at 45° of shoulder internal rotation and approximately 0.1 cm at 45° of shoulder external rotation.

==Clinical significance==
===Injury===
There are two types of rotator cuff injuries: acute tears and chronic tears. 

Acute tears occur as a result of a sudden movement. This might include throwing a powerful pitch, holding a fast moving rope during water sports, falling over onto an outstretched hand at speed, or making a sudden thrust with the paddle in kayaking. 

A chronic tear develops over a period of time. They usually occur at or near the tendon, as a result of the tendon rubbing against the underlying bone. The teres minor is typically normal following a rotator cuff tear.

===Imaging===
Atrophy of the teres minor muscle is often a consequence of a rotator cuff tear, but common isolated teres minor atrophies have also been found. A quadrangular space syndrome causes excessive and or chronically compression of the structures which pass through this anatomical tunnel. The axillary nerve and the posterior humeral circumflex artery pass through the space. People affected note shoulder pain and paresthesia down the arm first and foremost in abduction, extension, external rotation and overhead activity. Selective atrophy of the teres minor muscle has been seen and pulled together directly with compression of the corresponding axillary nerve branch or posterior humeral circumflex artery. Fibrous bands, cysts of the glenoid labrum, lipoma or dilated veins can occupy the quadrilateral space pathologically. Similar symptoms are common with anterior shoulder dislocation, humeral neck fracture, brachial plexus injury and thoracic outlet and inlet syndrome. It is important to include those pathologies for a complete as possible differential diagnosis.

Ultrasonography is a tool to detect a fatty degenerative atrophy of the teres minor and shows in affected muscles increased echogenicity and betimes a slight reduction in muscle bulk. MR imaging helps to consolidate the diagnosis of neurogenic muscle atrophy. Extracellular edema after traumatic events causing neural damage show an increased signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI sequences and normal intensity on T1-weighted sequences. Posterior humeral circumflex artery compression and reduced blood flow in stressful arm positions and or maneuvers can be diagnosed by a Doppler ultrasonography. The nerve should be detected adjacent to the vessel. In an elevated arm position the axillary neurovascular bundle can be seen at the posterior axillary fold just before it perforates the deltoideus, while the posterior course is well visible in the neutral position. For a detailed assessment of the artery, a MR angiography is required. The major task of an ultrasonographic examination is to rule out any space occupying mass. Additional electromyography is helpful to reveal any decelerated nerve conduction velocity, and thus denervation of the concerned muscle.

<text>Joseph Frye (March 19, 1712 – July 25, 1794) was a military leader from colonial Massachusetts.

==Life==

Born in Andover, Massachusetts, he obtained the rank of general in the Massachusetts militia after serving in King George&#x27;s War and the French and Indian War.

During the latter conflict, under the command of Edward Winslow, Frye helped build Fort Halifax in present-day Maine and then participated in the Battle of Fort Beauséjour and the Battle of Petitcodiac. He reported to have barely escaped with his life from a French-allied Native massacre of British forces after having surrendered Fort William Henry. He was commander at Fort Gaspareaux.

He was present on Lake George in August 1757 at the Siege of Fort William Henry. Then he returned to Nova Scotia and took command of Fort Cumberland. He served in the 2nd General Assembly of Nova Scotia in 1759–1760, representing Cumberland Township.

For services during that conflict, the Massachusetts General Court in 1762 granted him a township on the Saco River which had once been the Sokokis Abenaki village of Pequawket. In 1777, the plantation was incorporated as Fryeburg, Maine, named in his honor.

Frye is best known for the role he played expanding the colonial frontier into lands formerly held by both the French and Abenakis. He is regarded as the successor of John Lovewell, and also an enemy of Molly Ockett, leader and sage among dispossessed Algonquian peoples.

Frye served in the early stages of the American Revolutionary War, first as a major general of Massachusetts militia, and then briefly as a brigadier general in the Continental Army. He resigned on 23 April 1776, because his age made him ill-suited for active duty.

==Family and legacy==

Joseph Frye married Mehitable sometime before the birth of Joseph Jr on 17 July 1733. Samuel followed in 1735, and then Mehitable in April 1738, who died young, and was replaced by another Mehitable in May 1739, who died within the month. Mehitable Frye was born in April 1741. In the interim, Joseph Jr died and was replaced by another in July 1743. Tabitha followed in 1744, and next Hannah in 1748. Richard was born in 1751 to the Captain, and then Nathaniel in 1753. In the meantime, Samuel had expired and was replaced by another in 1758, this one born to the Colonel.

== Legacy ==

He is the namesake of Frye Island, Maine, and the aforementioned Fryeburg, Maine.

<doc id="1287270" wikidata="Q2997367" url="?curid=1287270" title="Corinne Wood">
<text>Corinne Gieseke Wood (née Gieseke; May 28, 1954 – May 18, 2021) was an American politician who served as the 44th lieutenant governor of Illinois from 1999 to 2003. She previously served as a Republican member of the Illinois House of Representatives from 1997 to 1999. She was the first woman to become Illinois&#x27; lieutenant governor.

== Early life ==
Corinne Gieseke was born on May 28, 1954, in Barrington, Illinois. Gieseke graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a Bachelor of Science from the University of Illinois and a Juris Doctor from Loyola University. After graduation, Gieseke was named general counsel to the Illinois Commissioner of Banks and Trusts, later joining the Chicago law firm Hopkins &amp; Sutter.

== Illinois House of Representatives ==
Wood was elected as state representative to the 59th district in 1996.

While in the House, Wood served on the Aging, Appropriations-Education, Financial Institutions, and Labor &amp; Commerce committees, as well as the Legislative Research Unit.

=== 1998 Illinois gubernatorial election ===

In March, Ryan and Wood won their Republican primary elections, with Wood unopposed for lieutenant governor. In November, the Ryan/Wood ticket won the general election with 51% of the vote. Wood was sworn in as lieutenant governor on January 11, 1999.

== Lieutenant Governor of Illinois ==
As Lieutenant Governor, Wood was a frequent advocate across Illinois on several prominent issues, including rural affairs, economic development, and women&#x27;s health. In December 1999, Wood gained national prominence for leading an internet campaign against Abercrombie &amp; Fitch for sexually provocative pictures in the catalog, pushing for a boycott and letter-writing campaign.

She also launched a statewide campaign to increase funding for breast cancer research through the &quot;A Check for a Cure&quot; Illinois tax return check-off when she first entered office.

=== 2002 gubernatorial campaign ===

In 2002, Wood sought the Republican nomination for governor of Illinois. Her fellow GOP contenders were attorney general Jim Ryan and state senator Patrick O&#x27;Malley. She ultimately lost the primary, finishing third with around 27% of the vote.

== Personal life ==
Corinne was married to Paul Wood. They had three children.

=== Death ===
Corinne battled breast cancer in the late 1990s and announced that she was resuming treatment in January 2006. She died after a 15-year battle with the disease on May 18, 2021, aged 66.

<doc id="1287278" wikidata="Q1606510" url="?curid=1287278" title="Tanausis">
<text>Tanausis was a legendary king of the Goths, according to Jordanes&#x27;s &quot;Getica&quot; (5.47). The 19th-century scholar Alfred von Gutschmid assigned his reign to 1323 BC – 1290 BC.

According to the &quot;Getica&quot;, he was the Gothic king who halted the advance of the Egyptian armies of the Egyptian king Sesostris (whom Jordanes calls &quot;Vesosis&quot;). At a battle on the banks of the river Phasis, Tanausis routed the Egyptian king who had already conquered the Ethiopians and the Scythians. 

Some historians have said that the War of Vesosis and Tanausis may not have happened and is combination of transcription errors or fantasy. 

The &quot;Getica&quot; states that Tanausis then pursued the Egyptians all the way back to the banks of the Nile, where the mighty river and the fortifications dissuaded him from slaying Sesotris &quot;in his own land&quot;. The territory Tanausis had conquered in Asia was then bestowed upon his close friend Sornus, king of the Medes. Some of Tanausis&#x27; followers remained in the conquered lands, and Jordanes cites Pompeius Trogus as saying these were the origin of the Parthians, stating that in the Scythian language &quot;Parthi&quot; means &quot;deserter&quot; (5.48).

Following his death, Jordanes writes that the Goths worshipped Tanausis as a god.

The story also appears in the earlier history of Justin, who also based his work on Pompeius Trogus. However, the opponents are described as Sesosis of Egypt and Tanaus, king of Scythia. Jordanes considered the Goths to be Scyths, and often did not distinguish them. Comparisons have also been made to a statement by Isidore of Seville to the effect that the river Tanais (now the Don) had been named for one &quot;Tanus&quot;, an ancestral king of Scythia.

<text>The Bell [[Witch]] or Bell Witch Haunting is a legend from Southern United States folklore, centered on the 19th-century Bell family of northwest Robertson County, Tennessee. Farmer John Bell Sr. resided with his family along the Red River in an area currently near the town of Adams. According to legend, from 1817 to 1821, his family and the local area came under attack by a mostly invisible entity that was able to speak, affect the physical environment, and shapeshift. Some accounts record the spirit also to have been clairvoyant and capable of crossing long distances with superhuman speed (or of being in more than one place at a time).

In 1894, newspaper editor Martin V. Ingram published his &quot;Authenticated History of the Bell Witch&quot;. The book is widely regarded as the first full-length record of the legend and a primary source for subsequent treatments. The individuals recorded in the work were known historical personalities. In modern times, some skeptics have regarded Ingram&#x27;s efforts as a work of historical fiction or fraud. Other researchers consider Ingram&#x27;s work a nascent folklore study and an accurate reflection of belief in the region during the 19th century.

While not a fundamental element of the original recorded legend, the Bell Witch Cave in the 20th century became a source of continuing interest, belief, and generation of lore. Contemporary artistic interpretations such as in film and music have expanded the reach of the legend beyond the regional confines of the Southern United States.

==Legend synopsis==

In his book &quot;An Authenticated History of the Bell Witch&quot;, author Martin V. Ingram published that the poltergeist&#x27;s name was Kate, after the entity claimed at one point to be &quot;Old Kate Batts&#x27; witch,&quot; and continued to respond favorably to the name. The physical activity centered on the Bells&#x27; youngest daughter, Betsy, and her father, and Kate expressed particular displeasure when Betsy became engaged to a local named Joshua Gardner.

The haunting began sometime in 1817 when John Bell witnessed the apparition of a strange creature resembling a dog with the head of a rabbit. Bell fired at the animal but it disappeared. John&#x27;s son Drew Bell approached an unknown bird perched on a fence that flew off and was of &quot;extraordinary size.&quot; The daughter Betsy observed a girl in a green dress swinging from the limb of an oak tree. Dean, a slave belonging to the Bell family, reported being followed by a large black dog on evenings he visited his wife. Activity moved to the Bell household with knocking heard along the door and walls. The family heard sounds of gnawing on the beds, invisible dogs fighting, and chains along the floor. About this time John Bell began experiencing paralysis in his mouth. The phenomena grew in intensity as sheets were pulled from beds when the children slept. Soon the entity pulled hair and scratched the children with particular emphasis on Betsy who was slapped, pinched and stuck with pins.

The Bells turned to family friend James Johnston for help. After retiring for the evening at the Bell home, Johnston was awakened that night by the same phenomena. That morning he told John Bell it was a &quot;spirit, just like in the Bible.&quot; Soon word of the haunting spread with some traveling great distances to see the witch. The apparition began to speak out loud and was asked, &quot;Who are you and what do you want?&quot; and the voice answered feebly, &quot;I am a spirit; I was once very happy but have been disturbed.&quot; The spirit offered diverse explanations of why it had appeared, tying its origin to the disturbance of a Native American burial mound located on the property, and sent Drew Bell and Bennett Porter on an unproductive search for buried treasure. With the emergence of full conversations, the spirit repeated word for word two sermons given 13 miles apart at the same time. The entity was well acquainted with Biblical text and appeared to enjoy religious arguments. As another amusement, the witch shared gossip about activities in other households, and at times appeared to leave for brief moments to visit homes after an inquiry.

John Johnston, a son of James, devised a test for the witch, something no one outside his family would know, asking the entity what his Dutch step-grandmother in North Carolina would say to the slaves if she thought they did something wrong. The witch replied with his grandmother&#x27;s accent, &quot;Hut tut, what has happened now?&quot; In another account, an Englishman stopped to visit and offered to investigate. On remarking on his family overseas, the witch suddenly began to mimic his English parents. Again in the early morning, the witch woke him to voices of his parents worried as they had heard his voice as well. The Englishman quickly left that morning and later wrote to the Bell family that the entity had visited his family in England. He apologized for his skepticism.

At times, the spirit displayed a form of kindness, especially towards Lucy, John Bell&#x27;s wife, &quot;the most perfect woman to walk the earth.&quot; The witch would give Lucy fresh fruit and sing hymns to her, and showed John Bell Jr. a measure of respect.

Referring to John Bell Sr. as &quot;Old Jack,&quot; the witch claimed she intended to kill him and signaled this intention through curses, threats, and afflictions. The story climaxes with the Bell patriarch being poisoned by the witch. Afterward the entity interrupted the mourners by singing drinking songs. In 1821, as a result of the witch&#x27;s entreatment, Betsy Bell called off her engagement to Joshua Gardner. Subsequently, the entity told the family it was going to leave, but return in seven years in 1828. The witch returned on time to Lucy and her sons Richard and Joel with similar activities as before, but they chose not to encourage it, and the witch appeared to leave again.

Several accounts say that during his military career, Andrew Jackson was intrigued with the story and his men were frightened away after traveling to investigate. In an independent oral tradition recorded in the vicinity of Panola County, Mississippi, the witch was the ghost of an unpleasant overseer John Bell murdered in North Carolina. In this tradition, the spirit falls in love with the central character &#x27;Mary&#x27;, leading to her death. This account is reminiscent of vampire lore. The supernatural powers attributed to the Tennessee spirit have also been compared to that of jinn in mythology.

In the manuscript attributed to Richard Williams Bell, he wrote that the spirit remained a mystery:

==Early written records==

===Long-Bell Expedition, 1820===

Military officer John R. Bell joined the Stephen Harriman Long expedition in 1820 to explore the central Great Plains. Due to lack of provisions, Long and Bell led divided parties after they reached the Rocky Mountains and rejoined in Fort Smith, Arkansas. Bell kept a detailed journal of his travel. His return trip, on October 19, 1820, crossed the Red River at Port Royal, Tennessee. Later that day, Bell stopped at the Murphey residence in Robertson County to eat dinner. During the stay, Bell was told of a young woman accompanied by a voice. The voice wished for the woman to marry a local man, and thousands had traveled to hear it. The journal&#x27;s connection to the Bell Witch legend was discussed by local historian David Britton during a television broadcast produced for the Discovery Channel in November, 2020.

===&quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;===

The publications &quot;New England Farmer&quot; of Boston and the &quot;Green Mountain Freeman&quot; of Vermont in January and February 1856 published an article regarding the Bell Witch legend and the publications ascribed the origin of the text to the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;. The &quot;Farmer&quot; was a weekly agricultural journal. The &quot;Freeman&quot; was affiliated with the abolitionist Liberty Party. The unidentified author described the apparition as the &#x27;Tennessee Ghost&#x27; or &#x27;Bell Ghost,&#x27; and stated the event occurred 30 years or more from the time the article was written. There are three human characters in the account, Mr. Bell, his daughter Betsey Bell, and Joshua Gardner. The author stated that the voice, which spoke freely about the house from all directions, would not manifest itself until the lights were extinguished at night. The phenomenon attracted wide interest. The author claimed to have become well acquainted with Mr. Gardner. When the ghost was asked how long it would remain, it replied, &quot;until Joshua Gardner and Betsey Bell get married.&quot; The author goes on to state that Betsey Bell had fallen in love with Joshua Gardner and had discovered the skill of ventriloquism. The author states that Ms. Bell then used her skill to attempt to convince Joshua Gardner to marry her. When they did not marry, the apparition disappeared.

M. V. Ingram, in his &quot;An Authenticated History Of The Bell Witch&quot;, wrote that a &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; article regarding the Bell Witch had been retracted:

===Clinard and Burgess Trial, 1868===

In September 1868, an article was published entitled &quot;Witchcraft and Murder: Hobgoblins and Old Gray Horses the Incentive to Crime.&quot; Tom Clinard and Dick Burgess were arrested for the murder of Mr. Smith. The article reported that Smith claimed the powers of witchcraft while working near Adam&#x27;s Station, chopping wood on a farm with the defendants. The article stated that Smith claimed to use these occult powers on Clinard and Burgess, leading to the conflict between them. The identity of the decedent was reported variously as James or Charles Smith. The jury of State vs. Clinard and Burgess returned a not guilty verdict.

Ingram published an interview with Lucinda E. Rawls, of Clarksville, Tennessee, daughter of Alexander Gooch and Theny Thorn, both reported as close friends of Betsy Bell. Rawls testified that the Bell Witch was a frequent topic of conversation during her lifetime and pointed to a murder of a man for witchcraft as evidence for this claim.

Ingram appended a date of 1875 or 1876 to the bloodshed, but connected the Rawls recollection with the death of Smith:

===Haunted House, 1880===

On April 24, 1880, an article was published regarding a &#x27;haunted house&#x27; in Springfield, Tennessee where knocking underneath the floor was heard. The fourth night of knockings began at 10:30 p.m. and ended at 4:00a.m. with the home surrounded by 10-12 persons working in an effort to discover the origin of the sound. In a follow-up report from April 26, 1880, the writer reported that several hundred people had visited the home attempting to witness the phenomenon with many camped out overnight despite the homeowners asking them to leave. On Wednesday night, April 28, 1880, the family were reported to have left the home for the night and a smaller group of investigators around the home heard knocking from fifty yards away. During the events, the journalist took the opportunity to mention the Bell Witch legend:

It is an actual fact that several hundred intelligent people of Springfield and vicinity have been so excited over the noise as to go night after night to listen to it ... About thirty years ago Robertson county had a sensation similar to this known as the &quot;Bell Witch,&quot; and people came from all parts of the country, even as far as New York, to hear or see her.

The Springfield floor knocking occurred at the residence of John W. Nuckolls, a prominent physician. Nuckolls was recently married to Laura Hopkins Jones, a union opposed by her family. The phenomenon created a domestic disturbance between the couple, as a local carpenter, Gill Walling, accused Laura Nuckolls of creating the noise with an iron ball attached to a rubber belt hidden under her clothes. Robertson County historian Yolanda Reid states, &quot;they came to the conclusion that the wife was tying it into the bottom of her skirt to make the sounds, nobody ever proved it.&quot; The couple separated in May, 1880. That August, John Nuckolls retrieved his infant child from his wife, running through town with his estranged wife following in anguish. Afterward the child was returned to Laura Nuckolls who was living with her father, Asa Hopkins. John Nuckolls, in February 1882, confronted Laura&#x27;s father, over his desire to see the child, and threatened his father-in-law&#x27;s life. During the argument, the subject of &#x27;ghosts&#x27; between the men was reported by an eyewitness as Nuckolls attempted to shoot Hopkins but was restrained. The next day, as a result of this confrontation, Nuckoll&#x27;s brother-in-law, S. B. Hopkins, traveled from Nashville and shot John W. Nuckolls with a double-barreled shotgun, causing his death. The circumstances of the shooting were contested and S. B. Hopkins was acquitted of murder.

The journal &quot;Studies in Philology&quot;, in 1919, published a study of witchcraft in North Carolina by folklorist Tom Peete Cross. Cross cites a column from the &quot;Nashville Banner&quot; where it mentions the paper had sent a reporter to Robertson County in the 1880s, John C. Cooke, to investigate reports of the possible reemergence of the Bell Witch phenomenon.

===Nashville Centennial Exposition===

A several page account of the Bell Witch legend was included in a sketch of Robertson County and was reportedly written for Nashville&#x27;s Centennial Exposition in 1880. The sketch was published in 1900 by the Tennessee Historical Society. The author of the sketch is unknown and the article is undated. Dates in the sketch end at 1880. The writer stated the source of the first portion of the narrative from &quot;F. R. Miles, William Pride, W. J. Gooch, Ben. B. Batts, and many others.&quot; The author identified the burial disturbance as skull bones previously located in a &quot;mound nearby on the river bluff.&quot; The return of the remains did not placate the spirit. The witch could speak in several languages and would &quot;set the dogs&quot; on unsuspecting victims. In the Centennial account, the Bell entity did not explicitly poison John Bell.

At one time a vial of poison was found in the flue of the chimney, and being taken down, Dr. George B. Hopson gave one drop to a cat, causing its death in seven seconds. The witch claimed to have put the poison there for the purpose of killing Mr. Bell. Being asked how it was going to administer the poison, it said by pouring it into the dinner pot. It is remarkable that, although he enjoyed good health up to the time of this event, Mr. Bell died within [ ] days after the vial was found, being in a stupor at the time of his death. From this time the people visited the house less frequently, although the witch would now and then be heard.

In the Ingram account, attributed to Richard Williams Bell, John Bell was already suffering from an unknown affliction and bedridden for some time. John Bell&#x27;s son, John Bell Jr., found the vial in the cupboard after his father did not wake. The family called for Dr. Hopson, while the Bell Witch exclaimed she had fed the poison to John Bell. Alex Gunn and John Bell Jr. tested the poison on the cat with a straw, which &quot;died very quick.&quot; John Bell died the next day on December 20, 1820.

The Centennial sketch stated the witch could appear as a rabbit, bear or black dog, and imitate various animal sounds. The voice claimed it was one of seven spirits with three names given for itself: Three Waters, Tynaperty, and Black Dog. The Ingram account also described a family of spirits that demonstrated during a short period of time. The members of the &#x27;witch family&#x27; had the names of Blackdog, Mathematics, Cypocryphy, and Jerusalem. Blackdog was described as the apparent leader of the group.

===Goodspeed&#x27;s &quot;History of Tennessee&quot;===

Goodspeed Brothers&#x27; 1886 &quot;History of Tennessee&quot;, recorded a short account of the legend that identified the spirit as female and stated that interest in the phenomenon was widespread in the region at the time.

A remarkable occurrence, which attracted widespread interest, was connected with the family of John Bell, who settled near what is now Adams Station about 1804. So great was the excitement that people came from hundreds of miles around to witness the manifestations of what was popularly known as the &quot;Bell Witch.&quot; This witch was supposed to be some spiritual being having the voice and attributes of a woman. It was invisible to the eye, yet it would hold conversation and even shake hands with certain individuals. The freaks it performed were wonderful, and seemingly designed to annoy the family. It would take the sugar from the bowls, spill the milk, take the quilts from the beds, slap and pinch the children, and then laugh at the discomfiture of its victims. At first it was supposed to be a good spirit, but its subsequent acts, together with the curses with which it supplemented its remarks, proved the contrary. A volume might be written concerning the performances of this wonderful being, as they are now described by contemporaries and their descendants. That all this actually occurred will not be disputed, nor will a rational explanation be attempted. It is merely introduced as an example of superstition, strong in the minds of all but a few in those times, and not yet wholly extinct.

===Accounts from 1890===

The week of January 20, 1890 hundreds of persons were reported to have visited a house 2.5 miles east of Hopkinsville, Kentucky as word spread of coal mysteriously falling from the ceiling in the family room. The house was occupied by a prominent minister of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, W. G. L. Quaite, his wife, step-daughter Belle Hall, as well as an unnamed sixteen-year-old female servant. Mrs. Quaite was injured as a piece struck her on top of the head and she required medical attention. An earlier report suggested the servant girl as a potential suspect, while stating the superstitious were invoking a connection to the &quot;Bell Witches of Robertson County&quot; from decades earlier. The frequency of the coal drops declined by the end of the week. Reverend Quaite attributed supernatural agency to the activity and was praying in the evening in an effort to solve the mystery.

An article was published on February 3, 1890, describing a series of events from Adam&#x27;s Station, Tennessee. At dusk, January 27, 1890, Mr. Hollaway reported watching two unknown women arrive at his home and dismount from their horses as he was feeding cattle. When he arrived at the house, the horses and women were gone. Mr. Hollaway&#x27;s wife reported seeing the women in the yard as well. That week, Mr. Rowland attempted to place a sack of corn on his horse&#x27;s back and it fell off. He again attempted to place the sack of corn on the horse&#x27;s back several more times, but each time the sack fell off. Joe Johnson arrived and held on to the sack as Mr. Rowland mounted his horse. They witnessed the sack floating away for 20 yards where it settled down at the fence. When the men went to retrieve the sack, a voice was heard, &quot;You won&#x27;t touch this sack anymore.&quot;

A follow-up report was published on February 18, 1890, with the title, &quot;A Weird Witch: More Tales of a Mulhattanish Flavor from Adams Station.&quot; In the late 19th century, Joseph Mulhattan was a known hoaxer of newspaper articles. The article was republished a few days later with the subtitle &quot;More Tales of a Fishy Flavor.&quot; In the account, the entity was referred to only as the witch. The article reports that Mr. Johnson was visiting Buck Smith and was discussing a recent visitation of the ghost at his home. They heard a knocking at the door, and when they opened the door, the knocking began at another door. They sat down and the dog began to fight with something invisible. Two minutes later, the door flew open and fire spread across the room blown by a cyclonic wind with the coals disappearing as they tried to put it out. That evening Mr. Johnson started home on his horse and something jumped on the back grabbing his shoulder as he tried to restrain the horse. He felt it jump off as he neared his home and move in the leaves into the woods.

Mr. Winters reported taking a peculiar bird while hunting with great difficulty. After he returned home, he opened the game-bag to discover the bird had disappeared and in place was a rabbit which then also disappeared. While burning vegetation outdoors, Mr. Rowland described a visit at 9 p.m. of a half-clothed black man with one eye in his forehead that directed Mr. Rowland to follow him and dig at a large rock. The figure then disappeared. Mr. Rowland dug that night until exhaustion. He received help the next morning from Bill Burgess and Mr. Johnson and discovered something described as a &quot;kettle turned bottom upward.&quot; They were unable to remove it as the soil began moving back into the hole faster than the men could remove the soil. The report concludes by saying that many people were visiting to see the witch.

==Martin Van Buren Ingram==

===Biography===

Born near Guthrie, Kentucky, June 20, 1832, Martin Van Buren Ingram took over responsibility of the family farm at the age of 17. A member of Hawkins&#x27; Nashville Battalion during the Civil War, he was discharged for disability after the Battle of Shiloh. Ingram began his editing and publishing career in April 1866 with the &quot;Robertson Register&quot; with no previous experience. October 1868, Ingram moved the paper to Clarksville and began issuing the &quot;Clarksville Tobacco Leaf&quot; in February 1869. Ingram continued an ownership association with the &quot;Leaf&quot; until about 1881. The consequences of poor health, family tragedy and fire limited his continuing interest in the newspaper industry.

On the occasion of Ingram&#x27;s death in October 1909, editor of the &quot;Clarksville Leaf Chronicle&quot;, W. W. Barksdale, wrote of his friend and colleague:

===&quot;An Authenticated History of the Famous Bell Witch&quot;===

The week of January 24, 1890, Ingram was suffering from a &quot;severe case of la grippe.&quot; In February 1890, Ingram resigned as editor of the &quot;Clarksville Chronicle&quot;. A month later, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; was purchased by the &quot;Leaf&quot;, and Ingram joined the new editorial staff. On July 13, 1892, a report in the &quot;Leaf-Chronicle&quot; was published of Ingram&#x27;s travels to Adams Station and Cedar Hill with John Allen Gunn, &quot;for the purpose of viewing the grounds where historic and most intensely thrilling events were enacted seventy-five years ago,&quot; and interviewing individuals, who &quot;were then living and familiar with the wonderful phenomena that awakened such a widespread sensation.&quot; In the report, Mahala Darden, age 85, related memory of Lafayette&#x27;s visit to Clarksville in 1825. A follow-up report was published July 19, 1892, recording a visit to Nancy Ayers, daughter of John Johnston. Ingram left the editorial position with the &quot;Leaf-Chronicle&quot; the same month.

Ingram subsequently traveled to Chicago in October 1893, while editor of the &quot;Progress-Democrat&quot;, in an attempt to publish his manuscript, &quot;An Authenticated History of the Famous Bell Witch. The Wonder of the 19th Century, and Unexplained Phenomenon of the Christian Era. The Mysterious Talking Goblin that Terrorized the West End of Robertson County, Tennessee, Tormenting John Bell to His Death. The Story of Betsy Bell, Her Lover and the Haunting Sphinx.&quot; Ingram left the &quot;Progress-Democrat&quot; to complete his book in February 1894. At the end of March, it was announced publisher W. P. Titus of Clarksville would print the work. The publisher reported a delay in printing after the witch visited one night in early May. Titus stated the witch demonstrated with maniacal singing, laughter, prayers, moaning, clapping, and rattling of the roof. The phenomena caused the printers to evacuate. By July 1894, the book was in print and a review from the newspaper in nearby Hopkinsville presented the work as a factual account.

In the introduction to the book, Ingram published a letter dated July 1, 1891, from former TN State Representative James Allen Bell of Adairville, Kentucky. J. A. Bell, a son of Richard Williams Bell and a grandson of John Bell Sr., explained that his father had met with his brother John Bell Jr. before his death and they agreed no material he had collected should be released until the last immediate family member of John Bell Sr. had died. The last immediate member of the family and youngest child of John Bell Sr., Joel Egbert Bell died in 1890 at the age of 76.

J. Allen Bell expressed the belief that his father&#x27;s manuscript was written when he was 35 years old in 1846. He stated his father gave him the manuscript and family notes shortly before his death in 1857. Richard Williams Bell was roughly 6 to 10 years of age during the initial manifestations of the Bell Witch phenomenon and 17 at the occurrence of the spirit&#x27;s return in 1828. The reported contributions of Richard Williams Bell, approximately 90 pages in length, are recorded in Chapter 8 of Ingram&#x27;s work, entitled &quot;Our Family Trouble&quot;.

According to Brian Dunning no one has ever seen this diary, and there is no evidence that it ever existed: &quot;Conveniently, every person with firsthand knowledge of the Bell Witch hauntings was already dead when Ingram started his book; in fact, every person with secondhand knowledge was even dead.&quot; Dunning also concluded that Ingram was guilty of falsifying another statement, that the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; had published a story in 1849 accusing the Bells&#x27; daughter Elizabeth of creating the witch, an article which was not found at the time. Joe Nickell argues the chapter includes the use of Masonic themes and anachronism which impacts credibility. Jim Brooks, a native of Adams, writes in his work &quot;Bell Witch Stories You Never Heard,&quot; that Bell family descendants report that Ingram did not return the manuscript to the family. Brooks explores the possibility that Ingram would have had an enhanced opportunity to modify the story by not returning the papers.

Keith Cartwright of the University of North Florida compares Ingram&#x27;s work with &quot;Uncle Remus&quot; folklore as recorded by Joel Chandler Harris and also as an expression of the psychological shame of slavery and Native American removal. The slaves in the account are regarded as experts on the witch, with Uncle Zeke identifying the witch as, &quot;dat Injun spirit ... the Injuns was here fust, and we white fokes driv em out, all but dem whar wur dead and cudent go, an da&#x27;s here yit, in der spirit.&quot; The figure of &quot;progress&quot; Gen. Andrew Jackson was brought nearly to heel and the master, John Bell, was dead. The role of the trickster not played by the Br&#x27;er Rabbit but the witch-rabbit, the spirit&#x27;s common animal form. The displaced, blacks, widows, and girls, act as witnesses to a force polite society cannot comprehend. The witch, &quot;appears as a catch-all for every remainder of resistant agency.&quot;

Among those who were alive during the haunting, Ingram conducted interviews with Ibby Gunn, born in 1806, a daughter of Uncle Zeke and the sister-in-law of Dean, as well as Mahala Byrns Darden, born circa 1807, daughter of James Byrns. Ibby Gunn shared some experiences of Dean including the creation of a witch ball made of hair by her sister Kate for her husband Dean, the use of which appeared to anger the entity. Mahala Darden detailed what she understood family and friends were experiencing at the time of the haunting, expressed her great fear the witch would come to visit her home and also related the spirit sang &quot;Row me up some brandy, O&quot; at the conclusion of John Bell&#x27;s graveside service.

====Andrew Jackson====

The account of General Andrew Jackson&#x27;s visit is confined to Chapter 11 of Ingram&#x27;s work. The chapter is a letter from Thomas L. Yancey, an attorney in Clarksville, dated January 1894. Yancey explained that his grandfather, Whitmel Fort, was a witness to phenomena at the Bell homestead and Fort had related the story of Jackson&#x27;s visit which was undated in the letter. Yancey described his grandfather&#x27;s account as, &quot;quite amusing to me.&quot;

The Bell household was strained of resources from visitors and Jackson brought a wagon load of supplies with his men. Nearing the Bell homestead, the wagon stopped and appeared fastened to its position despite considerable effort by Jackson&#x27;s men to free it. Jackson exclaimed, &quot;By the eternal, boys, it is the witch.&quot; A metallic voice was heard in the vegetation, &quot;All right General, let the wagon move on, I will see you again tonight.&quot; The horses began moving again. Instead of camping out, the party stayed at the Bell home that evening. Among the Jackson party was a &#x27;witch layer&#x27; who boasted of his supernatural exploits. Tiring of the bravado, Jackson whispered, &quot;By the eternals, I do wish the thing would come, I want to see him run.&quot; The entity arrived and taunted the witch slayer to shoot her. The man&#x27;s gun would not fire. The witch countered, &quot;I&#x27;ll teach you a lesson,&quot; and appeared to beat the man and led him out the door by his nose. Jackson exclaimed, &quot;By the eternal, boys, I never saw so much fun in all my life. This beats fighting the British.&quot; The witch told Jackson she would uncover another rascal the next night. That morning Jackson&#x27;s men chose to leave for home as they were apprehensive as to who was next.

Paranormal investigator Benjamin Radford, as well as Brian Dunning, conclude that there is no evidence that Andrew Jackson visited the Bell family home. During the years in question, Jackson&#x27;s movements were well documented, and nowhere in history or his writings is there evidence of his knowledge of the Bell family. According to Dunning, &quot;The 1824 Presidential election was notoriously malicious, and it seems hard to believe that his opponent would have overlooked the opportunity to drag him through the mud for having lost a fight to a witch.&quot; Carl Lindahl, affiliated with the University of Houston, writes that the Andrew Jackson encounter is an example of how belief and history mix together in the formation of legend. Such legends, which may persist in a locale for generations, upon receiving a media treatment can spread far outside of the area where the legend originated.

==Legend in the 20th century==

A prophecy was reported by May 1903 that the witch could return on the centennial of the Bell family arrival in Tennessee. In response to an August 1903 article from Memphis, &quot;The Springfield Herald&quot; expressed that no one in the local area was concerned with a return of the Bell Witch and made a charge of plagiarism towards the Memphis paper. The &quot;Herald&quot; also stated the copyright for Ingram&#x27;s work had passed to his son Tolbert who was working at The Denver Times. By September, the local paper was again incredulous as the spirit was not reported to have returned in August.

Charles Bailey Bell, a grandson of John Bell Jr., and neurologist in Nashville, published a book entitled &quot;The Bell Witch: A Mysterious Spirit&quot; in 1934. In the work, he recounted stories he stated were told to him by his great aunt Betsy later in her life. This included another account of Andrew Jackson&#x27;s visit and of a boy trapped in the Bell Witch Cave and pulled out of the cave feet first by the witch. Bell also detailed a series of prophecies he stated were given to his ancestors in 1828 by the spirit, including a declaration the witch was set to return again in 1935, 107 years after her last visit to the Bell family.

In 1937, there were reports of quirky events. Louis Garrison, owner of the farm that included the Bell Witch Cave, heard unexplained noises coming from inside. Bell descendants described the sound of something rubbing against a house, a paper like object that flew out the door and reentered through a side door, and faint music heard from a piano. A group from the local Epworth League were reported to have attended a wiener roast in a rock quarry near the Bell Witch Cave on July 29, 1937. The group were joking about the legend when they saw a figure of a woman sitting on top of the cliff over the cave causing many to flee. According to the newspaper, a minister in the group later claimed to have investigated and discovered it was moonlight on a rock. The second report concluded with a weather report that the moon was barely noticeable that night. Jim Brooks published in 2015 that his mother was in attendance at the roast, and relates that the minister caught up to the youth on the road to town after discovering no explanation for the figure.

In November 1965, an article was published involving an antique oak rocking chair said to have been previously owned by attorney Charlie Willett, a Bell descendant. The rocking chair was acquired in Willett&#x27;s estate sale by Mrs. J. C. Adams, owner of an antique store on U.S. 41. A customer sat down in the chair, after learning it was not for sale, and while rocking in the chair asked Mrs. Adams if she believed in the supernatural. Two weeks later, the customer&#x27;s daughter visited the home of Mrs. Adams and said after her mother had left and visited the Bell cemetery a voice told her to &quot;stand up and look around, you will find something of much value.&quot; After some car trouble, the woman walked out into a field and found a black iron kettle turned over. She turned the kettle over and found a pearl buckle in the grass. The woman&#x27;s daughter reported a jeweler estimated the buckle to be 160 to 200 years old.

Attorney Charles Romaine Willett (1886-1963), son of Sarah Elizabeth Bell, began an interest in the newspaper business at the age of 16. After some time playing professional baseball and working at other newspapers, Willett became the first managing editor of the &quot;Nashville Tennessean&quot; in 1907 while teaching himself law. A mayor of Adams, and member of the State legislature, Charlie Willett was known for his reliability. Every Sunday, Willett would accompany his sweetheart, Miss Jerry Cullom Gardner, for ice cream in Clarksville and dinner at Richardson&#x27;s Restaurant on the return home. According to community lore, the couple never married so as not to tempt fate as they descended from the Bell and Gardner families respectively. Jim Brooks relates that a family member detailed familial obligations as the likely explanation. Brooks inquired what the couple thought about the rumor in the early 1960s. Jerry Gardner explained if Charlie Willet ever asked her to marry him, she would assent. When Brooks related this to Charlie Willett, he immediately smiled, pulled his thumbs through his suspenders and said, &quot;Oh, she said that, did she?&quot;

Bonnie Haneline, in 1977, recounted a time during her childhood in 1944 when she was exploring the cave. She left English class, playing &#x27;hooky,&#x27; and borrowed a lantern from Mrs. Garrison, the cave owner. She reported to have explored the cave with her friends for several years. While she was inside, her lantern blew out despite no breeze inside the cave. She managed to relight the lantern and it blew out again. Terrified, she crawled along the water path of the cave in the dark until she reached the entrance where she saw an opened can of pork and beans and marshmallows. Later that evening, she learned law enforcement discovered two escaped fugitives in the back of the cave. She credited the witch with helping her avoid them.

A visit in 1977 was reported of five soldiers from nearby Fort Campbell to the Bell Witch Cave. One of the soldiers was sitting on a rock and expressed skepticism of the legend when something invisible grabbed him around the chest.

In 1986, staff writer David Jarrard for &quot;The Tennessean&quot; and photographer Bill Wilson, the latter also a member of the National Speleological Society, were given permission to sleep in the cave over night. While in the first cave room they heard a noise from deeper in the cave Jarrard estimated at 30 yards. Subsequently, an &quot;unwavering groan&quot; repeated again with greater volume and accompanied by several loud thumps. When it began a third time, the men retreated to the gate entrance. They explored the wiring to the lights looking for a reason for the noises. They went back to the first cave room but heard a rumble near the entrance. Walking back to the entrance they discovered the rumble was noise from a jet. As they reached the gate, a loud, high pitched scream emanated from inside the cave. The journalists left and did not spend the night.

In 1987, H. C. Sanders, owner of a nearby gas station, reported 20 years earlier he ran out of gas at night near the Red River across from the Bell Witch Cave. He began to walk towards town when a rabbit came out of the woods and began to follow him. Sanders walked faster, but the rabbit kept pace even as he broke out into a run. After a mile, Sanders sat down on a log to catch his breath. The rabbit hopped up on the other side of the log looked at him and said, &quot;Hell of a race we had there, wasn&#x27;t it?&quot;

==Skeptical evaluation==

According to Ben Radford, the Bell Witch story is an important one for all paranormal researchers: &quot;It shows how easily legend and myth can be mistaken for fact and real events and how easily the lines are blurred&quot; when sources are not checked. Radford reminds readers that &quot;the burden of proof is not on skeptics to &quot;disprove&quot; anything but rather for the proponents to prove ... claims&quot;.

Brian Dunning wrote that there was no need to discuss the supposed paranormal activity until there was evidence that the story was true. &quot;Vague stories indicate that there was a witch in the area. All the significant facts of the story have been falsified, and the others come from a source of dubious credibility. Since no reliable documentation of any actual events exists, there is nothing worth looking into.&quot; Dunning concludes, &quot;I chalk up the Bell Witch as nothing more than one of many unsubstantiated folk legends, vastly embellished and popularized by an opportunistic author of historical fiction.&quot;

Joe Nickell has written that many of those who knew Betsy suspected her of fraud and the Bell Witch story &quot;sounds suspiciously like an example of &quot;the poltergeist-faking syndrome&quot; in which someone, typically a child, causes the mischief.&quot;

Amy Fluker, a researcher of the Mississippi version of the legend while affiliated with the University of Mississippi, has expressed the Bell Witch legend has other value. &quot;As a historian of collective memory, it matters very little to my research if hauntings are real or not. It does matter that people believe they are. As a result, they can help us understand the perspectives, in this case, of 19th and 20th century Americans.&quot;

==Bell Witch in culture==

===Film===

There have been several films based, at least in part, on the Bell Witch legend. Roger Clarke, former film critic for &quot;The Independent&quot;, argues the legend has also had a measurable influence on cinema such as in the &quot;Poltergeist&quot; film series, the found footage &quot;Paranormal Activity&quot; film series, &quot;The Witch&quot; released in 2015, the trope of burial ground disturbance in &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot;, and the apport of cherries to the children in &quot;Mama&quot; released in 2013.

===Television===

The American paranormal television series &quot;Ghost Adventures&quot; filmed an episode at the Bell Witch Cave.

Director Sid Zanforlin released a documentary episode on the legend and the town of Adams in 2014 for a series entitled &quot;Boogeymen: Monsters Among Us&quot; which aired on Destination America and also organized as a collection known as &quot;America&#x27;s Monsters&quot; entitled &quot;Forest Monsters: Mothman and the Bell Witch.&quot;

An American television series – &quot;Cursed: The Bell Witch&quot; – based on selected descendants of the Bell family trying to end a curse. The series premiered October 2015 on the A&amp;E Network.

In 2018, the Travel Channel series &quot;Haunted Live&quot; featured paranormal investigative team, the Tennessee Wraith Chasers visiting the town of Adams, Tennessee, where the descendants of the Bell family take them to the cabin.

Expedition X explored caves of Middle Tennessee and the legend in 2020.

<doc id="1287290" wikidata="Q6781565" url="?curid=1287290" title="Maryland v. Craig">
<text>Maryland v. Craig, 497 U.S. 836 (1990), was a U.S. Supreme Court case involving the Sixth Amendment. The Court ruled that the Sixth Amendment&#x27;s Confrontation Clause, which provides criminal defendants with the right to confront witnesses against them, did not bar the use of one-way closed-circuit television to present testimony by an alleged child sex abuse victim.

==Background==
Defendant Sandra A. Craig was charged with sexually abusing a minor child. At trial, the child was reportedly unable to testify in the physical presence of the defendant due to severe emotional trauma. The trial court set her up in a separate room with the judge, the prosecutor, and the defense attorney, so that the defendant and jury could only see her testify via the live television screen in the courtroom, and she could not see them. Craig was convicted, but the Maryland Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that her Sixth Amendment rights were violated by the use of the transmitted testimony, because the Confrontation Clause guaranteed face-to-face confrontation. The state of Maryland sought certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted the petition.

==Opinion of the Court==
In a 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court reversed the Maryland high court, reinstating the conviction. Justice O&#x27;Connor wrote for the majority, ruling that the Confrontation Clause merely embodies a &quot;preference&quot; for face-to-face, in person confrontation, which may be limited to satisfy sufficiently important interests. Because the child witness was cross-examined by the defendant&#x27;s attorney and her general demeanor was visible in the courtroom, the defendant had a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to test her credibility and the substance of her testimony before the jury.

&quot;Craig&quot; came shortly after the Court had invalidated the use of a screen to hide a similarly situated child witness/victim in &quot;Coy v. Iowa&quot; (1988). The Court in &quot;Coy&quot; had found &quot;no individualized findings (that the victims) needed special protection.&quot; Indeed, &quot;face-to-face presence may, unfortunately, upset the truthful rape victim or abused child; but by the same token it may confound and undo the false accuser, or reveal the child coached by a malevolent adult.&quot; In contrast, the Maryland statute in &quot;Craig&quot; provided for an exception when a child&#x27;s testimony would result in &quot;serious emotional distress.&quot; Furthermore, the use of one-way closed-circuit TV did not considerably obstruct the jury&#x27;s observation of the child&#x27;s testimony.

Justice O&#x27;Connor noted that the fundamental purpose of the Sixth Amendment was to prevent &quot;ex parte&quot; affidavits, citing &quot;Mattox v. United States&quot; 156 U.S. 237, 242 (1895). She further identified four primary guarantees embodied in the Confrontation Clause:
*The right of &quot;personal examination&quot;
*That a witness will testify under oath
*That a witness will submit to cross-examination
*That the jury may observe the demeanor of the witness in making his statement

The Court noted that hearsay exceptions demonstrated that no defendant had an absolute right to a face-to-face encounter with adversarial witnesses. While the Maryland exception did not provide face-to-face confrontation, the final three preserved guarantees were present. The State&#x27;s interest in the physical and psychological well-being of child abuse victims could outweigh the defendant&#x27;s right to face his accusers in court.

===Dissent===
Justice Scalia, in dissent, wrote that he was &quot;persuaded...that the Maryland procedure is virtually constitutional. Since it is not, however, actually constitutional I would affirm the judgment of the Maryland Court of Appeals reversing the judgment of conviction.&quot;

==Subsequent developments==
The continued validity of &quot;Craig&quot; was called into question after the Supreme Court case &quot;Crawford v. Washington&quot; (2004). In &quot;Crawford&quot;, the Court overruled &quot;Ohio v. Roberts&quot; (1980), which &quot;Craig&quot; relied in large part upon. However, &quot;Craig&quot; remains good law. During the COVID-19 pandemic, federal courts conducting criminal trials, relied upon &quot;Craig&quot; to have witnesses testify by &quot;Zoom or some other videoconferencing technology.&quot;

<doc id="1287314" wikidata="Q126033" url="?curid=1287314" title="2003 Catalan regional election">
<text>The 2003 Catalan regional election was held on Sunday, 16 November 2003, to elect the 7th Parliament of the autonomous community of Catalonia. All 135 seats in the Parliament were up for election.

This election marked a change for all Catalan political parties due to Catalan president Jordi Pujol&#x27;s decision not to seek a seventh term in office and to retire from active politics. The election results were a great disappointment for Pasqual Maragall&#x27;s Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia (PSC), which again saw Convergence and Union (CiU) winning a plurality of seats despite them winning the most votes by a margin of just 0.3%. Opinion polls earlier in the year had predicted a much larger victory for Maragall, but his lead over CiU had begun to narrow as the election grew nearer. Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) was perceived as the true victor of the election, doubling its 1999 figures and scoring its best result in its recent history up to that point, both in terms of seats (23 of 135) and votes (16.4%), up from 11 seats and 8.7%.

As Pujol&#x27;s successor Artur Mas did not win a majority large enough to renew his party pact with the People&#x27;s Party (PP), which had kept Pujol in power since 1995, an alliance between the PSC, ERC and ICV–EUiA resulted in a Catalan &quot;tripartite&quot; government. Thus, despite losing 10 seats and 150,000 votes compared to the 1999 election, Maragall became the first centre-left president of the Government of Catalonia, ending with 23 uninterrupted years of CiU rule.

==Overview==
===Electoral system===
The Parliament of Catalonia was the devolved, unicameral legislature of the autonomous community of Catalonia, having legislative power in regional matters as defined by the Spanish Constitution and the Catalan Statute of Autonomy, as well as the ability to vote confidence in or withdraw it from a regional president. Transitory Provision Fourth of the Statute established a specific electoral procedure for elections to the Parliament of Catalonia, of application for as long as a regional electoral law was not approved, to be supplemented by the provisions within the national electoral law. Voting for the Parliament was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over 18 years of age, registered in Catalonia and in full enjoyment of their political rights.

The 135 members of the Parliament of Catalonia were elected using the D&#x27;Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with an electoral threshold of three percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each constituency. Seats were allocated to constituencies, corresponding to the provinces of Barcelona, Girona, Lleida and Tarragona, with each being allocated a fixed number of seats:

In smaller constituencies, the use of the electoral method resulted in an effective threshold based on the district magnitude and the distribution of votes among candidacies.

===Election date===
The term of the Parliament of Catalonia expired four years after the date of its previous election, unless it was dissolved earlier. The regional president was required to call an election fifteen days prior to the date of expiry of parliament, with election day taking place within sixty days after the call. The previous election was held on 17 October 1999, which meant that the legislature&#x27;s term would have expired on 17 October 2003. The election was required to be called no later than 2 October 2003, with it taking place on the sixtieth day from the call, setting the latest possible election date for the Parliament on Monday, 1 December 2003.

The president had the prerogative to dissolve the Parliament of Catalonia and call a snap election, provided that no motion of no confidence was in process and that dissolution did not occur before one year had elapsed since a previous one under this procedure. In the event of an investiture process failing to elect a regional President within a two-month period from the first ballot, the Parliament was to be automatically dissolved and a fresh election called.

==Background==
In the 1999 election, and as a result of the Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia (PSC)&#x27;s growth, the Catalan nationalist Convergence and Union (CiU) had lost the vote share in a regional election for the first time ever, but clung on to retain the largest amount of seats due to the disproportionate allocation of seats in Girona, Lleida and Tarragona compared to Barcelona. Through to the support of the People&#x27;s Party (PP), Jordi Pujol had been able to be re-elected to a sixth term in office with a slim majority of 68 to the 67 seats commanded by the left-from-centre opposition.

Despite Pujol&#x27;s personal approval ratings remaining high until the end of his term, speculation on his possible retirement (which he confirmed on 1 April 2001), internal disputes between Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC) and Democratic Union of Catalonia (UDC) over the future of the alliance—which resulted in CiU being turned into a full-fledged party federation in order to ensure its continuity in the post-Pujol era—and a desire for change after 23 years in power had resulted in CiU trailing the PSC in opinion polls for the entire legislature, with a lead that was nearly into the double digits by mid-to-late 2002. From mid-2003, however, the Socialist lead had begun to narrow to the point that chances for a possible reenactment of the 1999 tight race remained high. The retirement of Pujol as CiU candidate paved the way for Artur Mas, the then chief minister (), to replace him as the culmination of a long successory process.

Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) had been in an almost continuous growth since the 1988 election, becoming a political force able to pierce through the dominant two-party system in Catalonia. Initiative for Catalonia Greens (ICV) and United and Alternative Left (EUiA) had run separately in the previous election, but ahead of the 2003 election joined within the ICV–EA coalition.

==Parliamentary composition==
The Parliament of Catalonia was officially dissolved on 23 September 2003, after the publication of the dissolution decree in the Official Journal of the Government of Catalonia. The table below shows the composition of the parliamentary groups in the chamber at the time of dissolution.

==Parties and candidates==
The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of at least one percent of the electorate in the constituencies for which they sought election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates.

Below is a list of the main parties and electoral alliances which contested the election:

==Opinion polls==
The tables below list opinion polling results in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party&#x27;s colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The &quot;Lead&quot; column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a poll.

===Graphical summary===
===Voting intention estimates===
The table below lists weighted voting intention estimates.

<text>Tu&#x27;i Malila (1777 – 16 May 1966) was a tortoise that Captain James Cook was traditionally said to have given to the royal family of Tonga. She was a female radiated tortoise (&quot;Astrochelys radiata&quot;) from Madagascar. Although believed to have been a male during its life, examination after the tortoise&#x27;s death suggested it was female.

The name means &quot;King Malila&quot; in the Tongan language.

==Life==
According to one story, Tu&#x27;i Malila was one of a pair of tortoises given by Captain Cook to the Tongan royal family upon his visit to Tonga in July 1777. The other tortoise reportedly died shortly after Cook&#x27;s visit. This story has been discounted on the basis that Cook made no mention of the event in his journal, although it has been suggested that the tortoise may have been the gift of a member of Cook&#x27;s crew instead.

According to other sources, George Tupou I obtained her from a vessel which called in Haʻapai in the first half of the 19th century.

The tortoise was taken to Muʻa, where it was kept in a compound named Malila, from which it took its name. Around 1921, Sālote Tupou III moved the tortoise to the Royal Palace. Despite being kicked by a horse and run over several times, the tortoise continued its life, although it was left blind and with a badly wounded right-hand side.

During Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Royal Tour of Tonga in 1953, Tu&#x27;i Malila was one of the first animals shown to the monarch on her official visit to the island nation. It appears while being fed by the royal children in the British Pathe colour newsreel of the visit.

The tortoise died on 16 May 1966, aged approximately 188 years old. Tu&#x27;i Malila was listed for some time in the Guinness Book of World Records as the oldest known tortoise. In 2006, a tortoise named Adwaita was claimed by an Indian zoo to be 255 years old at the age of its death, but this was never officially confirmed. In 2022, Jonathan, a tortoise living on the south Atlantic island of Saint Helena exceeded Tu&#x27;i Malila&#x27;s reported age and is still alive as of 2024.

A Reuters dispatch of the tortoise makes an appearance as an epigraph in Philip K. Dick&#x27;s &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;

<text>Johann Gottfried Köhler (15 December 1745 – 19 September 1801) was a German astronomer who discovered a number of nebulae, star clusters, and galaxies.

Köhler is best remembered for his discovery of Open Cluster M67, Elliptical Galaxy M59, and Elliptical Galaxy M60. The latter two were discovered on the same day, 11 April 1779.

He worked with the noted astronomer Johann Elert Bode, who refined and published Köhler&#x27;s proposal for the symbol of Uranus.

From 1784 he was the director of Mathematisch-Physikalischer Salon.

<doc id="1287319" wikidata="Q204840" url="?curid=1287319" title="Honeoye Lake">
<text>Honeoye Lake ( ) is one of the Finger Lakes located in Ontario County, New York. Most of the lake is within the town of Richmond but a smaller southwestern part is in the town of Canadice. The hamlet of Honeoye is just north of the lake.

The name Honeoye comes from the Seneca word &quot;ha-ne-a-yah&quot;, which means &quot;lying finger&quot;, or &quot;where the finger lies&quot;. The name comes from the local story of a Native American whose finger was bitten by a rattlesnake and who therefore cut off his finger with a tomahawk.

==Description==

Honeoye Lake is the second smallest of the Finger Lakes and is located to the west of the major lakes. To its west are other minor Finger Lakes: Canadice Lake, Hemlock Lake, and Conesus Lake. As with the other Finger Lakes, Honeoye Lake was created by the advance and subsequent melting of continental glaciation.

The lake&#x27;s surface is above sea level. The lake is long and narrow with a roughly north-south orientation, and a surface area of . It is also relatively shallow and warmer than the other Finger Lakes. Its outlet is Honeoye Creek, which flows northward. A major feeder stream, called Honeoye Inlet, enters the lake at the south end.

The hamlet of Honeoye in the Town of Richmond is located at its northern end. The Honeoye Lake Park Association administers a large tract of summer cottages and year-round dwellings known as the Times-Union Tract just south of the hamlet on the east side of the lake.

==Recreation==
The shore of the lake has a high density of recreation homes, many with docks for boats and other recreation vehicles. In warmer weather, fishing is considered exceptional in Honeoye Lake. Walleye, bass, perch and bluegill are some of the recreational and tournament fish that can be found. Popular recreational activities also include boating, tubing, water skiing, wake boarding, and other water sports.

The Ring of Fire tradition is annually celebrated Labor Day weekend by area residents. Flares are lit around the lakeshore to signify summer&#x27;s end and to recognize the wealth of the Finger Lakes harvest. In the winter, the water freezes quickly and maintains its solid surface throughout the season, at which time the lake is used for ice fishing, skating, and ice boating.

===Public places===
On the north end of the lake is Sandy Bottom Park, which includes a life guarded beach, two playgrounds, and multiple pavilions. There is also a boat launch that is available from May 15 to Labor Day.

Honeoye Lake Boat Launch State Park is available on the east side, towards the south end of the lake, and is open from May to November. Harriet Hollister Spencer State Recreation Area, located on Canadice Hill south of the lake, overlooks Honeoye Lake.

== Environmental Issues ==
In recent years the lake has suffered from water quality problems including shoreline erosion due to boating and blue-green algae blooms.

<text>Courtney Jason Alexander (born April 27, 1977) is an American former professional basketball player.

==Career==
After playing high school basketball at Masuk High School in Monroe, Connecticut Alexander moved to Durham, North Carolina, to play for C. E. Jordan High School to finish his high school career. A shooting guard, he played college basketball at University of Virginia and Fresno State, and he led the nation in scoring in the 1999–2000 season at Fresno State.

He was selected by the Orlando Magic with the 13th overall pick in the 2000 NBA draft; his rights were traded to the Dallas Mavericks on the same day. He played for the Mavericks before being traded during his rookie season to the Washington Wizards where he played until 2002. He was named to the All-Rookie 2nd Team. He was then traded in the offseason to the New Orleans Hornets. A highlight of his career was a 33-point effort for the Wizards against the Toronto Raptors on April 18, 2001 when Richard Hamilton was out with injuries.

He suffered a tear of his Achilles&#x27; tendon in 2003 while with the Hornets, and after rehabilitating his injury, he later signed with the Sacramento Kings but was released before ever playing a game for them due to an injury to the tendons in his left foot. On October 8, 2006, Alexander was signed by the Denver Nuggets after being out of the league for three seasons, but was waived on October 15.

Because of his 3-year hiatus and being waived in October 2006 by the Nuggets before ever playing a game for them, Alexander&#x27;s final NBA game was actually played on May 2, 2003, in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference First Round against the Philadelphia 76ers. In that game, he only recorded 2 points as the Hornets would lose the series 4 - 2 and being eliminated from the playoffs.

<doc id="1287324" wikidata="Q2298105" url="?curid=1287324" title="Silver dapple gene">
<text>The silver or silver dapple (&quot;Z&quot;) gene is a dilution gene that affects the black base coat color and is associated with Multiple Congenital Ocular Abnormalities. It will typically dilute a black mane and tail to a silvery gray or flaxen color, and a black body to a chocolaty brown, sometimes with dapples. It is responsible for a group of coat colors in horses called &quot;silver dapple&quot; in the west, or &quot;taffy&quot; in Australia. The most common colors in this category are &quot;black silver&quot; and &quot;bay silver&quot;, referring to the respective underlying coat color.

Mature black silvers typically have sooty white or silver manes and tails with a flat, non-fading, dark grey or grey-brown body coat. The body coat frequently exhibits dapples, rings of lighter-colored hair. 

Mature bay silvers retain their reddish bodies, though the presence of small amounts of silver often gives them a chocolate appearance. The mane and tail are usually a sooty silver, darker at the roots, and the legs are usually a flat, brownish-grey mottled with silver. The hair around the eyes and muzzle may also show signs of silvering.

Silver dapple foals can be difficult to identify, but commonly have a pale, wheat-colored body coat, white eyelashes, and hooves with tapering vertical stripes. These characteristics fade over time.

Red-based horses, such as chestnuts and chestnuts with other dilution factors (such as palominos, and cremello) may carry the silver dapple gene, and may pass it on to their offspring, but will not express the gene in their own body color.

==Silver mimics==

* Gray: While gray horses grow progressively lighter, silver dapples often darken with age. A silver dapple masked by gray (i.e. carries both genes and, because gray is a dominant gene, becomes white with age) may be identified by use of DNA testing.
* Liver chestnut: Silver dapples, especially bay silvers, are frequently misidentified as liver chestnuts or flaxen chestnuts. Flaxen manes and tails in chestnuts tend to have honey or red tones, while the pale manes and tails of silver dapples are soot-toned and darker at the roots. Liver chestnuts also lack the grey-brown dappling on the lower legs. The darkest liver chestnuts often have a kind of marbling on the lower legs, though this hair, too, should show red or yellow tones. Overall, chestnuts of all shades have red-yellow character to their coats, while silver bays recall grey-brown. Knowledge of the pedigree of the horse in question is often useful: two chestnut-based parents cannot produce a silver bay or silver black. DNA testing can be used in the most difficult cases.
* &quot;Sooty&quot; palomino: Dark palominos may be hard to distinguish from silver dapples, particularly if the mane or tail of a palomino contain streaks of silver. A true palomino, with a red-based coat, will exhibit yellow or gold tones; a silver horse, in contrast, is by definition black-based and exhibits gray, black or brown undertones. A sooty palomino, like other creme dilutes, may have brown eyes a shade lighter than average, but this is not true of silver dapples. When actual color is in question, pedigree information or a DNA test can help clarify matters.

==Prevalence==

Many breeds do not possess the silver dapple gene. The coat color is traditionally associated with the Rocky Mountain Horse and the Miniature Horse. Scandinavian breeds and their descendants such as the Icelandic horse, Nordland Pony, Shetland Pony, Welsh Mountain Pony, Welsh Pony, Swedish Warmblood and Finnhorse are also found in the silver dapple colors. American horse breeds known to have the silver gene include the Morgan, American Saddlebred, Missouri Foxtrotter, Tennessee Walking Horse, and the American Quarter Horse. European draft breeds such as the Comtois and Ardennais also occur in silver. Historically the color was found in the Dutch Groningen, but the breed was crossbred to produce the Dutch Warmblood and underwent subsequent genetic bottlenecking, so the gene may no longer be present.

==Inheritance and expression==

The silver dapple trait is caused by a missense mutation (labeled &quot;Z&quot;) in the &quot;PMEL17&quot; gene on horse chromosome 6. It is transmitted by autosomal dominant inheritance (simple dominance). &quot;PMEL17&quot; is active from quite early in embryonic development through to the mature cell&#x27;s melanosome and is involved with the production of the black pigment eumelanin.

Melanins, which provide color in the eyes, skin, and hair, are found in two types: eumelanin, which produces black to brown pigment, and phaeomelanin, which produces red to yellow pigment. Most horses can produce both types; the brown appearance of a bay horse&#x27;s coat is caused by alternating bands of eumelanin and phaeomelanin, for which the agouti gene is responsible. Eumelanin predominates in the legs, mane and tail of bay horses. By contrast, horses which lack a functional agouti gene cannot produce such alternating bands, and thus have wholly black coats with no visible phaeomelanin. Chestnut horses lack the ability to manufacture eumelanin altogether, and so have wholly red coats devoid of true black pigment.

While the role of &quot;PMEL17&quot; is not fully understood, the silver dapple gene exclusively produces dilution, or hypopigmentation, of eumelanin. The dilution changes black into various shades of platinum, silver and flat grey, though the original black-brown character of the color is usually preserved. The effects of the gene are more striking in the mane and tail. Horses with chestnut or chestnut-family coats - such as palomino, red roan, or red dun - are therefore unaffected by the gene and may silently carry it and pass it on to their offspring.

On the template of a black horse, which has a coat rich in eumelanin, the effect is that of complete conversion to varying shades of silver. Often the body remains quite dark while the mane and tail are strongly diluted. On the template of a bay horse, which has eumelanin largely restricted to the points, these points are converted to silver while the phaeomelanic body is mostly unaffected.

An undesirable effect associated with the gene is eye problems, notably multiple congenital ocular anomalies (MCOA). MCOA has multiple clinical signs including a bulbous bulging of the eye, cornea globosa, severe iridal hypoplasia, uveal cysts, cataracts, and in a few cases, retinal detachment. These conditions can be detected via ultrasound examination of the eye. In a 2013 study of Comtois horses and Rocky Mountain Horses, all animals carrying the mutated form of &quot;PMEL17&quot; had some eye disorder, though milder problems in animals heterozygous for the allele versus those who were homozygous. None of the control horses of these breeds who lacked the mutated form of &quot;PMEL17&quot; had any eye disorder.

Similar mutations in other species provide insight into the roles played by the &quot;PMEL17&quot; gene. Relatively few such mutations are known, which suggests that the gene is involved in processes critical to survival. Several of the mutations known are related to pigmentation: premature silvering in mice, diluted and white plumage in chickens, and the widely known merle dilution in dogs. The merle coat in dogs is associated with auditory and ophthalmologic disorders, such as deafness and microphthalmia. In Rocky Mountain Horses, the silver dapple color is sometimes associated with Anterior Segment Dysgenesis (ASD) which affects the structures in the face and the front of the eye. Most often, the syndrome presents as benign lesions, though homozygotes may have impaired vision. As ASD is found in non-silver representatives of the breed, it is thought to be physically close to the silver gene and to have come from a silver dapple, ASD-affected foundation ancestor, thus is an example of the Founder effect.

<text>Sachs &amp; Violens is an American comic book created by writer Peter David and co-developed with artist George Pérez. This four-issue miniseries was published from 1993 to 1994 by Marvel Comics&#x27;s Epic Comics imprint, in which creators retained the rights. The series was part of the imprint&#x27;s Heavy Hitters line, and featured a greater amount of violence and adult situations compared with mainstream comic books of the time, and as such was recommended for mature readers.

The titular duo later appeared as supporting characters in David&#x27;s other creator-owned series, &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;.

==Publication history ==
&quot;Sachs &amp; Violens&quot; is an American comic book four-issue miniseries published from November 1993 to July 1994 by Marvel Comics&#x27;s Epic Comics imprint, in which creators retained the rights. It was created by writer Peter David and co-developed with artist George Pérez. The series was part of the imprint&#x27;s Heavy Hitters line, which also
Included &quot;Lawdog&quot;, &quot;Terrarists&quot;, &quot;Brats Bizarre&quot; and &quot;Feud&quot;.

==Plot and characters ==
Juanita &quot;J.J.&quot; Sachs is a model who does softcore pornography photo shoots for her friend Ernie &quot;Violens&quot; Schultz, a former Vietnam War photojournalist. After her friend is viciously murdered in a snuff photo shoot, the two of them track down the people responsible and, in the process, become lovers and uncover an underworld of depravity, ending in a violent showdown in Mardi Gras.

Sachs and Violens appeared as supporting characters in Peter David&#x27;s other creator-owned title, &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;. They first appeared in the second volume of the series, which was published by IDW Publishing, in which they arrive in the series&#x27; setting of Bete Noire, a mysterious city of Biblical origin inhabited by various characters of dubious character and motives. They become allies of the series&#x27; titular heroine, Liandra, and continue to appear in the series&#x27; third volume, by the same publisher, which debuted in August 2009.

==Collected edition==
In December 2006, the miniseries was collected as &quot;Sachs and Violens&quot;, a 128-page trade paperback by DC Comics. In November 2016, the miniseries was again collected as &quot;Sachs and Violens&quot;, this time by IDW. 

==Merchandising==
In August 2009, Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab, a company that produces comic book-themed perfumes, debuted &quot;Sachs &amp; Violens&quot;, based on the titular comic book characters. Proceeds from sales of the scent went to the Hero Initiative, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping comic book creators in need of health, medical, and quality-of-life assistance.

<doc id="1287335" wikidata="Q7450332" url="?curid=1287335" title="Seneca River (New York)">
<text>The Seneca River flows through the Finger Lakes region of Upstate New York in the United States. The main tributary of the Oswego River – the second-largest river flowing into Lake Ontario – the Seneca drains in parts of fourteen New York counties. The Seneca flows generally east, and is wide and deep with a gentle gradient. Much of the river has been channelized to form part of the Erie Canal.

==Geography==
The Seneca River begins at Geneva in Seneca County, as the outflow of Seneca Lake, flowing east past Waterloo and Seneca Falls. Skirting the northern end of Cayuga Lake at the Montezuma Marsh, it turns north, receiving the Clyde River from the west, forming the Seneca–Cayuga county line, then the border of Cayuga and Wayne counties. The river passes under Interstate 90, flowing northeast past Weedsport, across the middle of Cayuga County into Cross Lake.

Below Cross Lake, the Seneca River enters Onondaga County. It turns sharply north then east, past Baldwinsville and Liverpool, along the northern edge of metro Syracuse where it receives the outflow of Onondaga Lake. The river then flows north to join the Oneida River at Three Rivers on the Onondaga–Oswego County line, forming the Oswego River. From the confluence, the Oswego flows a further north, emptying into Lake Ontario at the city of Oswego.

The Seneca River watershed drains a total of , or about two-thirds of the greater Oswego River basin. There are about of streams in the Seneca basin. The Seneca receives the outflow of seven of the eleven Finger Lakes: Canandaigua, Keuka, Seneca, Cayuga, Owasco, Skaneateles and Otisco. Canandaigua Lake flows via the Canandaigua Outlet and the Clyde River into the Seneca River. Keuka Lake empties into Seneca Lake via the Keuka Lake Outlet. Owasco and Skaneateles Lakes join the Seneca through their eponymous outlet streams, while Otisco Lake flows via Ninemile Creek into Onondaga Lake, which in turn empties into the Seneca.

==History==

===Native Americans===

The river is named for the Seneca people, whose traditional lands extended roughly between Lake Erie and Seneca Lake. The Onondaga inhabited the area in present-day Onondaga County, around Onondaga Lake and Syracuse, and the Cayuga inhabited the river valley and lakeshores in between. All three were part of the Iroquois League, which is believed to have been established between 1570 and 1600. For hundreds of years before the arrival of Europeans, the river was an important Native American trade route.

===Explorers and settlers===

The first Europeans to reach the Seneca River were likely Jesuit missionaries in the late 1600s, who established an outpost, St. Stephen, on the river shortly below its origin at Seneca Lake.

===Canalization===
In 1821, the Seneca Lock Navigation Company completed eight locks along the upper Seneca River above Cayuga Lake to allow navigation to Seneca Lake. By 1828, this had been replaced by a state-owned waterway, the Cayuga-Seneca Canal, which contains eleven locks in .

Construction of the Seneca reach of the Erie Canal began in the 1820s. The channel between Three Rivers and Cayuga Lake was widened and straightened to accommodate barges, and other reaches were bypassed via the construction of parallel canals. The canal path had to cross the Seneca River at several points, so locks were built to lower boats down to river level, where they were towed across aided by temporary wooden bridges. In 1849 work began to separate the canal from the river, to reduce the impact of flooding and sedimentation.

The Montezuma Marshes at the outlet of Cayuga Lake were a major obstacle to the Erie Canal path. The stone Seneca River Aqueduct (Richmond Aqueduct), which carried the canal over the Seneca and Clyde Rivers, opened in 1857 after eight years of construction. At it was the second-longest aqueduct on the Erie Canal system. Most of the aqueduct was dynamited in the 1910s to allow navigation on the Barge Canal.

Certain points on the Seneca River were an early center of development for industry. Seneca Falls is the location of the only significant natural drop on the river, which was utilized in the early days to power water mills. Where the river had no natural falls, mill dams were built, one of the earliest of which was at Baldwinsville. In 1915 a dam high was built at Seneca Falls to generate hydroelectricity.

==Ecology and environmental issues==
Below Onondaga Lake, the Seneca River is moderately polluted by industrial and domestic waste, including high levels of mercury, PCBs, dioxin and ammonia. The New York State Department of Health advises limited consumption of fish from the lower river.

Parts of the river are infested by non-native zebra mussels, which have depleted the level of dissolved oxygen, impacting fish populations. The population density of mussels in one particular section of the river below Cross Lake is considered among the highest in North America.

The river is home to a population of common snapping turtles. In July 2001, there was a recorded attack on a 43-year-old man, near Fobes Island, who sustained minor injuries to the calf of his leg. This has been the only recorded attack on humans in the river so far.

<doc id="1287337" wikidata="Q853311" url="?curid=1287337" title="Beyond-visual-range missile">
<text>A beyond-visual-range missile (BVR missile) is an air-to-air missile that is capable of engaging at ranges around or beyond. This range has been achieved using dual pulse rocket motors or booster rocket motor and ramjet sustainer motor. Medium-range, long-range, and very-long-range air-to-air missiles fall under the category of beyond-visual-range missiles. Older BVR missiles generally used the semi-active radar homing, and modern BVR missiles use the active radar homing guidance.

In addition to the range capability, the missile must also be capable of tracking its target at this range or of acquiring the target in flight. Systems in which a mid-course correction is transmitted to the missile have been used.

==History==
Early air-to-air missiles used semi-active radar homing guidance, that is the missile used the radiation produced by the launching aircraft to guide it to the target. The latest generation of BVR missiles use a combination of semi-active and active radar.

The first such missiles were relatively simple beam riding designs. The Sparrow 1 mounted on the US Navy&#x27;s Skyknight became the first operational BVR missile in 1954. These primitive BVR missiles were soon replaced by missiles using semi-active radar homing (SARH). This is where the launching aircraft&#x27;s radar is &quot;locked&quot; onto the target in a single target track (STT) mode, directing radar energy at the target that the missile seeker can &quot;see&quot; as it reflects off the target. The radar antenna must &quot;illuminate&quot; the target until impact. Missiles like the Raytheon AIM-7 Sparrow and Vympel R-27 &quot;(NATO designation AA-10 &#x27;Alamo&#x27;)&quot; home in on the reflected radiation, much as a laser-guided bomb homes in on the reflected laser radiation. Some of the longest-range missiles in use today still use this technology.

An AIM-7 variant called Sparrow II was the first attempt at producing a semi-active radar homing missile, however the first air-to-air missile to introduce a terminal active seeker operationally was the AIM-54 Phoenix carried by the F-14 Tomcat, which entered service in 1972. This relieved the launch platform of the need to illuminate the target until impact, putting it at risk. The Phoenix and its associated Tomcat radar, the AWG-9 was capable of multiple track and launch capability, which was unique to the Tomcat/Phoenix until the advent of AMRAAM in 1991.

Newer fire-and-forget type missiles like the Raytheon AIM-120 AMRAAM and the Russian R-77 (NATO reporting name AA-12 &quot;Adder&quot;) instead use an inertial navigation system (INS) combined with initial target information from the launching aircraft and updates from a one or two-way data link in order to launch beyond visual range, and then switch to a terminal homing mode, typically active radar guidance. These types of missiles have the advantage of not requiring the launching aircraft to illuminate the target with radar energy for the entire flight of the missile, and in fact do not require a radar lock to launch at all, only target tracking information. This gives the target less warning that a missile has been launched and also allows the launching aircraft to turn away once the missile is in its terminal homing phase or engage other aircraft. The very longest-range missiles like the Hughes (now Raytheon) AIM-54 Phoenix missile and Vympel manufactured R-33 (NATO designation AA-9 &quot;Amos&quot;) use this technique also.

Some variants of the Vympel R-27 use SARH for the initial guidance and then passive infra-red guidance for the final stage. This type of missile requires active guidance for a longer part of the flight than fire-and-forget missiles but will still guide to the target even if radar lock is broken in the crucial final seconds of the engagement and may be harder to spoof with chaff due to the dual-type guidance.

== Efficiency ==

The efficiency of BVR air-to-air missiles has been criticized. A 2005 paper by USAF officer Patrick Higby showed that BVR missiles fell short of expected performance, despite incurring great cost. Because such missiles required large radars, they made aircraft heavier and increased drag, increasing aircraft procurement and operating costs. Fighters with BVR tended to be less agile than previous ones. Fighter pilots have been reluctant to use BVR missiles at BVR range because of difficulty in distinguishing friends and foes. As a result, most BVR missiles are fired at visual range. Western airforces only scored 4 BVR kills out of 528 kills made during 1965–1982; most kills during that period were made with guns or WVR missiles (AIM-9 Sidewinder). 

The increased success rate of BVR combat during 1991 Gulf War may have significantly depended on other factors, such as assistance of AWACS, NCTR system of F-15Cs, as well as enemy incompetence. None of the Iraqi pilots took any evasive measures, either because of poor training or their radar warning receivers malfunctioned. One major issue with BVR is still unreliable IFF technology (Identification friend or foe). However, new generation engines such as ramjet, along with the latest sensors such as active radar, increase the hit probability of the latest BVR missiles, such as Meteor, and also increase the range.


In 2015, United States Naval Air Forces commander Vice Admiral Mike Shoemaker cited the sensor fusion of the fifth-generation jet fighter Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II as the way to &quot;bring that long-range ID capability and then share that information&quot; with other platforms.

<doc id="1287344" wikidata="Q310807" url="?curid=1287344" title="Archduke Albrecht, Duke of Teschen">
<text>Archduke Albrecht Friedrich Rudolf Dominik of Austria, [[Duchy of Teschen|Duke of Teschen]] (3 August 1817 – 18 February 1895), was an Austrian Habsburg general. He was the grandson of Emperor Leopold II and one of the chief military advisors of Emperor Francis Joseph I. As Inspector General for 36 years, he was an old-fashioned bureaucrat who largely controlled the Austro-Hungarian Army and delayed modernization. He was honored with the rank of field marshal in the armies of Austria-Hungary (1863) and Germany (1893).

According to historians John Keegan and Andrew Wheatcroft:
: He was a firm conservative in all matters, military and civil, and took to writing pamphlets lamenting the state of the Army’s morale as well as fighting a fierce rearguard action against all forms of innovation…. Much of the Austrian failure in the First World War can be traced back to his long period of power…. His power was that of the bureaucrat, not the fighting soldier, and his thirty years of command over the peacetime Habsburg Army made it a flabby instrument of war.

==Early life==
A grandson of the Emperor Leopold II, he was the eldest son of Archduke Charles of Austria, who defeated French Emperor Napoleon I at Aspern-Essling (1809), and Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg. He was the nephew of the Emperor Francis I, and cousin to Emperor Franz Joseph I&#x27;s father Archduke Franz Karl of Austria, and served under Franz Joseph.

Born in Vienna, from an early age he had a military disposition, which his father encouraged. Albrecht was subject to a mild form of epilepsy, according to report, but this did not visibly interfere with his military career.

He entered the Austrian army in 1837 with Feldmarshal Joseph Radetzky as his military governor. Having received a thorough military education, Albrecht was named a &quot;Generalmajor&quot; in 1840 and promoted to &quot;Feldmarschall-Leutnant&quot; in 1843.

==Military campaigns==
Promoted to &quot;General der Kavallerie&quot; in 1845, Albrecht was given command of Upper Austria, Lower Austria, and Salzburg. Upon the death of his father in 1847, he inherited the Palais Weilburg in Baden bei Wien, which became the family&#x27;s summer home. In the winter the family lived in Vienna in the Palais Erzherzog Albrecht (the modern Albertina museum).

As the commandant of Vienna, Albrecht was wounded in the street fighting on 13 March 1848 at the start of the revolutionary disturbances. He issued live ammunition to his soldiers and secured the inner city, but was unable to suppress the disorder in the outlying districts. With the fall of Metternich and the formation of a city guard led by students, Albrecht pulled his troops into barracks. Radicals resented his attempt to quell the revolution while some fellow officers thought he showed a lack of resolve. Unsatisfactory to both factions and under pressure from city authorities, Albrecht was replaced by Count Auersperg.

Albrecht was sent south to command a division under Radetzky, who faced a coalition of states of the Italian peninsula led by King Charles Albert of Sardinia. Albrecht personally supervised the crossing of the Ticino and by the handling of his division ensuring victory at Novara on 23 March 1849.

He became civil and military governor of Hungary in 1851, serving until his recall in 1860. When Albrecht&#x27;s wife, Archduchess Hildegard, went to Munich in March 1864 for the funeral of her brother, King Maximilian II, she became ill with a lung inflammation and pleurisy. She died in Vienna on 2 April 1864, two months short of her 38th birthday.

At the outbreak of the Seven Weeks&#x27; War in June 1866, Albrecht was named commander of the southern army facing the Italian forces of King Victor Emmanuel II. Albrecht was decisively victorious in the Battle of Custoza (24 June 1866), but failed to exploit his victory when he neglected to pursue the beaten Italian &quot;Army of the Mincio&quot;. Any advantages for the Austrians however were canceled out by the crushing defeat on 3 July at Königgrätz, where Ludwig von Benedek was surprised by the speed of Helmuth von Moltke&#x27;s concentric advance into Bohemia.

Albrecht was named &quot;Oberkommandeur&quot; (Commander-in-Chief) on 10 July 1866. Benedek&#x27;s defeat made any further action against Prussia impossible, however, and peace was shortly concluded with both Prussia and Italy. Besides the loss of Holstein to Prussia and Venetia to Italy in 1866, the war resulted in the transformation of the Austrian realm in 1867 as the Dual Monarchy – the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

==Inspector General==
Albrecht remained &quot;Oberkommandeur&quot; until 1869; when Kaiser Franz Josef I assumed the title that year, Albrecht became &quot;Generalinspekteur&quot; (Inspector General), the post he occupied until his death. In 1869 he published &quot;Über die Verantwortlichkeit im Kriege&quot; (&quot;On Responsibility in War&quot;). His reform of the Austro-Hungarian Army was based on the Prussian model: development of railways and manufacturing, adoption of short-service conscription, procurement of modern weapons and reform of the Austro-Hungarian General Staff. Albrecht&#x27;s program upgraded the army but he then froze it in place for the next three decades as it declined in quality. He fought liberals (including Crown Prince Rudolf) claiming their reforms would be too expensive and disruptive.

In public affairs, he was leader of the conservative Court Party, and opposed the ministry of Count Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust at every point, expressing the most inexorably reactionary views. As such he was an absolutist and opposed any liberal ideas and any weakening of the imperial power. He was somewhat more courteous to Beust&#x27;s successors, though he remained given to bombastic pronouncements that may not have reflected his actual sentiments. He was widely thought, for instance, to be antipathetic toward Prussia after 1866, yet he modeled his military reforms on those of Prussia and even attended a parade of the Prussian Royal Guard in Berlin at the invitation of Emperor William I. In December 1876 Albrecht advocated a preventive war against Italy on the grounds that of all Austria&#x27;s neighbors, Italy was the most hostile, could be beaten most easily, and be forced to pay compensation to Austria-Hungary, whose victory would establish it as a Great Power.

At the Congress of Berlin in 1878, the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Andrássy, in addition to the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, also obtained the right to station garrisons in the Sanjak of Novi Pazar, which remained under Ottoman administration. The Sanjak preserved the separation of Serbia and Montenegro, and the Austro-Hungarian garrisons there would open the way for a dash to Salonika, supported by Albrecht, that &quot;would bring the western half of the Balkans under permanent Austrian influence.&quot; &quot;High [Austro-Hungarian] military authorities desired [an ...] immediate major expedition with Salonika as its objective.&quot;
On 28 September 1878 the Finance Minister, Koloman von Zell, threatened to resign if the army, behind which stood the Archduke Albert, were allowed to advance to Salonika. In the session of the Hungarian Parliament of 5 November 1878 the Opposition proposed that the Foreign Minister should be impeached for violating the constitution by his policy during the Near East Crisis and by the occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The motion was lost by 179 to 95. By the Opposition rank and file the gravest accusations were raised against Andrassy.
Reputed to be the wealthiest of the Habsburgs, Albrecht owned some in Hungary. He also owned a fine collection of paintings and engravings, later the nucleus of the Albertina museum. His popularity was profound, for his generosity to the poor was genuine and unfeigned; he was widely known as &quot;Engelsherz&quot; (Angel&#x27;s-heart).

When Albrecht was made a &quot;Feldmarschall&quot; in March 1888, Crown Prince Rudolf was appointed his subordinate as &quot;Generalinspekteur der Infanterie&quot; (Inspector General of Infantry). The new Inspector found any move toward liberal reform blocked by the War Minister, &quot;Feldzeugmeister&quot; Ferdinand von Bauer, the Chief of the General Staff, &quot;Feldzeugmeister&quot; Friedrich von Beck-Rzikowsky – and by Albrecht himself. Senior officers deferred to Albrecht who, after all, had laboriously modernized the Army after the disaster of 1866. However, the anomalous situation in the military administration was undoubtedly only one of many factors that contributed to Rudolf&#x27;s suicide at Mayerling on 30 January 1889.

==Later life==

Having been made a &quot;Feldmarschall&quot; in his own army in 1863, Albrecht was the recipient of the equivalent rank of &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; in the Imperial German Army in 1893, Wilhelm II, German Emperor sending General Walther von Loë to deliver the baton to Albrecht.

Archduke Albrecht continued to serve as &quot;Generalinspekteur&quot; even into advanced age - a situation not uncommon in Austria-Hungary where many commanders retained posts and commissions into old age. By 1895, though still holding his office, he was partially blind and his horse had to be led by an adjutant.

When he died in Arco on 18 February 1895, Archduke Albrecht received a state funeral and was buried in tomb 128 of the Imperial Crypt in Vienna. His fortune and his title of Duke of Teschen were inherited by his nephew, Archduke Friedrich, who served as &quot;Oberkommandeur&quot; in 1914–17.

Today, an equestrian statue of Archduke Albrecht stands near the entrance to the Albertina museum, his former city residence in Vienna.

==Family and children==
On 1 May 1844 Albrecht married in Munich Princess Hildegard of Bavaria, daughter of King Ludwig I and Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen. Albrecht and Hildegard had 3 children:
*Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Teschen (15 July 1845, Vienna – 8 October 1927, Tübingen), married at Vienna on 18 January 1865 Duke Philipp of Württemberg (1838, Neuilly-sur-Seine – 1917, Stuttgart) and had five children:
**Albrecht, Duke of Württemberg (1865–1939), commander on the Western Front of the German Fourth Army, 1914–17, and Army Group Duke Albrecht, 1917–18; like his grandfather, he was made a German Field Marshal in 1916.
**Marie Amelie of Württemberg (1865–1883)
**Isabelle of Württemberg (1871–1904)
**Robert of Württemberg (1873-1947)
**Ulrich of Württemberg (1877–1944)
*Archduke Karl of Austria-Teschen (3 January 1847, Vienna – 19 July 1848), died of smallpox and buried in tomb 131 of the Imperial Crypt.
*Archduchess Mathilda of Austria-Teschen (25 January 1849, Vienna – 6 June 1867, Schloss Hetzendorf, near Vienna), buried in tomb 130 of the Imperial Crypt.

== Honours ==
Albrecht received the following decorations and awards:
==Namesake==
Albrecht&#x27;s name was given to a &quot;Panzerschiff&quot; (armorclad, later battleship) launched in 1872 as &quot;Erzherzog Albrecht&quot;. Renamed &quot;Feuerspeier&quot; in 1908, she was ceded to Italy in 1920 and renamed &quot;Buttafuoco&quot;. The old ironclad survived as a hulk until she was scrapped in 1947.

<text>The Oneida River is a river that forms a portion of the boundary between Oswego and Onondaga counties in central New York. The river flows from Oneida Lake&#x27;s outlet to its confluence with the Seneca River, where the two rivers combine to form the Oswego River that empties into Lake Ontario.

The river was known to the Onondaga people as &quot;Sah-eh&quot;, and was referred to during the colonial era as the Onondaga River.

The river is utilized for boating and shipping as part of the New York State Barge Canal.

<doc id="1287346" wikidata="Q1502114" url="?curid=1287346" title="Equine coat color genetics">
<text>Equine coat color genetics determine a horse&#x27;s coat color. Many colors are possible, but all variations are produced by changes in only a few genes. Bay is the most common color of horse, followed by black and chestnut. A change at the &quot;agouti&quot; locus is capable of turning bay to black, while a mutation at the &quot;extension&quot; locus can turn bay or black to chestnut. 

These three &quot;base&quot; colors can be affected by any number of dilution genes and patterning genes. The dilution genes include the wildtype dun gene, believed to be one of the oldest colors extant in horses and donkeys. The dun gene lightens some areas of the horse&#x27;s coat, while leaving a darker dorsal stripe, mane, tail, face, and legs. Depending on whether it acts on a bay, black, or chestnut base coat, the dun gene produces the colors known as bay dun, grullo, and red dun. 

Another common dilution gene is the cream gene, responsible for palomino, buckskin, and cremello horses. Less common dilutions include pearl, champagne, and silver dapple. Some of these genes also lighten eye color. 

Genes that affect the distribution of melanocytes create patterns of white spotting or speckling, such as in roan, pinto, leopard, white or white spotting, and even some white markings. Finally, the gray gene causes depigmentation of the hair shaft, slowly adding white hairs over the course of several years until the horse&#x27;s body hair is near or completely white. 

Some of these patterns have complex interactions. For example, a single horse may carry both dilution and white patterning genes, or carry genes for more than one spotting pattern. Horses with a gray gene can be born any color and their hair coat will lighten and change with age.

Most wild equids are dun, as were many horses and asses before domestication of the horse. Some were non-dun with primitive markings, and non-dun 1 is one of the oldest coat color mutations, and has been found in remains from 42,700 years ago, along with dun. Non-dun 2, the version of the dun gene that most domestic horses have, is thought to be much more recent, possibly from after domestication. Leopard complex patterns also predate domestication, having been found in horse remains from 20,000 years ago. The mutation responsible for black and grullo also predates domestication. The mutations causing chestnut, sabino 1, and tobiano appeared shortly after horse domestication, roughly 5000 years ago. Silver and cream dilutions appeared at least 2,600 years ago, and pearl appeared at least 1400 years ago. The gray mutation is also post-domestication but thought to be thousands of years old as well.

==Fundamental concepts==
===Terminology===
Heritable characteristics are transmitted, encoded, and used through a substance called DNA, which is stored in almost every cell in an organism. Proteins are molecules that do a variety of different things in organisms. The DNA instructions for how to make a protein are called a gene. A change to the sequence of DNA is called a mutation. Mutations are not inherently bad; genetic diversity itself ultimately comes from mutations. Mutations that happen within a gene create alternate forms of that gene, which are called alleles. Alleles of a gene are simply slightly different versions of the instructions on how to make that gene&#x27;s protein. The term &quot;allele&quot; is sometimes replaced with the word &quot;modifier&quot;, because different alleles tend to modify the horse&#x27;s appearance in some way. DNA is organized into storage structures called chromosomes. A chromosome is simply a very long piece of DNA, and a gene is a much shorter piece of it. With some rare exceptions, a gene is always found at the same place within a chromosome, which is called its locus. For the most part, chromosomes come in pairs, one chromosome from each parent. When both chromosomes have the same allele for a certain gene, that individual is said to be homozygous for that gene. When the two alleles are different, it is heterozygous. A horse homozygous for a certain allele will always pass it on to its offspring, while a horse that is heterozygous carries two different alleles and can pass on either one. A trait that is only expressed when the gene is homozygous for its allele is called recessive, and a trait that has the same effect no matter whether there is one copy or two is called dominant.

===Notation===
Often, the dominant allele is represented by an uppercase letter and the recessive allele by a lowercase letter. For instance, in silver dapple, this is &quot;Z&quot; for the dominant silver trait and &quot;z&quot; for the recessive non-silver trait. However, sometimes the alleles are distinguished by which is the &quot;normal&quot; or wild type allele and which is a more recent mutation. In our example &quot;z&quot; (non-silver) would be wild type and &quot;Z&quot; would be a mutation. Wild type alleles can be represented as + or n, so &quot;Zz&quot;, &quot;Zz+&quot;, Z/+, and Z/n are all valid ways to describe a horse heterozygous for silver. Wild type notation is mainly useful when there is no clear dominant/recessive relationship, such as with cream and frame overo, or when there are many alleles on the same gene, such as with &quot;MITF&quot;, which has four known alleles. Using &quot;n&quot; is also common in the results of genetic tests, where a negative result usually means none of the known mutations were found, but does not rule out undiscovered mutations.

===Melanin===
Genes affecting coat color generally do so by changing the process of producing melanin. Melanin is the pigment that colors the hairs and skin of mammals. There are two chemically distinct types of melanin: pheomelanin, which is a red to yellow color, and eumelanin, which is brown to black. Melanin is not a protein and therefore there is no gene that changes its structure directly, but there are many proteins involved in the production of melanin or the formation of melanocytes during embryonic development. Mutations that change the structure of proteins with a role in melanin production can result in slightly different variations of melanin. Some genes do not alter the structure of melanin but instead affect where and whether it is produced.

==Extension and agouti==
The genes &quot;extension&quot; and &quot;agouti&quot; together affect the placement of the two types of pigment, black eumelanin and &quot;red&quot; (coppery brown) pheomelanin.

The &quot;extension&quot; gene codes for a molecule called the Melanocortin 1 receptor, or &quot;MC1R&quot;. This receptor straddles the membrane of pigment cells, and when activated it signals the cell to produce black pigment instead of red. A recessive mutation to &quot;extension&quot; removes this functionality, causing the solid red color of chestnut horses. Extension does not affect skin color. The dominant, wildtype, allele of extension is called &quot;E&quot;, and the non-extension mutation is called &quot;e&quot;. &quot;Extension&quot; is epistatic to &quot;agouti&quot;, meaning that if a horse has two &quot;e&quot; alleles, it will be chestnut no matter what genotype it has at &quot;agouti&quot;.

The &quot;agouti&quot; gene codes for a molecule called the agouti-signaling protein, or &quot;ASIP.&quot; This molecule interacts with &quot;MC1R&quot;, the receptor coded by &quot;extension&quot;, to block the signal for black pigment production. The signal for black pigment comes from a melanocyte-stimulating hormone, which is present throughout the horse. &quot;ASIP&quot; is not present everywhere, which allows some areas to be black while others are red. &quot;ASIP&quot; can also be limited by the phase of hair growth, allowing the tips of the hairs to be black while the base is red. This can be observed in horses which have their winter coats clipped. When shaved close, the black tip is shorn off leaving the phaeomelanic bottom of the shaft. This produces a dull, orange-gold appearance on the body coat which is lost with the spring shed. This is not usually seen in dark bays, which have little red in the hair shaft. A mutation to &quot;agouti&quot; removes the ability to block the black signal, resulting in a fully black horse. The dominant, wildtype, allele of agouti is called &quot;A&quot;, and the non-agouti mutation is called &quot;a&quot;.

===Phenotypes===

===Extension===
&quot;Extension&quot; is found on equine chromosome 3 as part of a linkage group with roan, tobiano, and the KIT gene. Extension is also sometimes called &quot;red factor&quot; and can be identified through DNA testing. Horses with the genotype &quot;E/E&quot; are sometimes called &quot;homozygous black&quot;, however depending on the &quot;agouti&quot; genotype there is no guarantee that any offspring can be black coated, only that no offspring will be &quot;red&quot;.

A study that compared horse genotypes to their coat color phenotypes did find a statistically significant connection that suggested that lighter bay shades were heterozygous for the &quot;Extension&quot; mutation (&quot;E/e&quot;) and darker bay shades were homozygous.

Mutations that break protein function generally lead to recessively inherited lighter or redder coat colors in various mammals, while mutations that cause MC1R to be constantly active result in dominantly inherited black coats. In horses, both known mutations break the protein and therefore result in red coats.

Various mutations in the human &quot;MC1R&quot; gene result in red hair, blond hair, fair skin, and susceptibility to sunburnt skin and melanoma. Polymorphisms of &quot;MC1R&quot; also lead to light or red coats in mice, cattle, and dogs, among others. The &quot;Extension&quot; locus was first suggested to have a role in horse coat color determination in 1974 by Stefan Adalsteinsson. Researchers at Uppsala University, Sweden, identified a missense mutation in the &quot;MC1R&quot; gene that resulted in a loss-of-function of the MC1R protein. Without the ability to produce a functional MC1R protein, eumelanin production could not be initiated in the melanocyte, resulting in coats devoid of true black pigment. Since horses with only one copy of the defective gene were normal, the mutation was labeled &quot;e&quot;.

===Extension alleles===
There are three known alleles of &quot;extension&quot;, the wildtype &quot;E&quot;, and two recessive alleles &quot;e&quot; and &quot;ea&quot; which cause chestnut color. The &quot;E&quot; allele can also be called &quot;E+&quot; or &quot;EE&quot;, and the &quot;e&quot; allele may also be called &quot;Ee&quot;.

Of the two known mutations, the first to be discovered was &quot;e&quot;, and is a change of a single cytosine to thymine at base pair 901 which results in the serine in position 83 being changed to a phenylalanine. In 2000 &quot;ea&quot; was found, which is a change of a single guanine to adenine at base pair 903, resulting in aspartate being changed to asparagine at position 84 in the polypeptide. Visually there is no difference between the two.

===Agouti===
In many species, successive pulses of ASIP block contact between α-MSH and MC1R, resulting in alternating production of eumelanin and pheomelanin; hairs are banded light and dark as a result. In other species, &quot;ASIP&quot; is regulated such that it only occurs in certain parts of the body. The light undersides of most mammals are due to the carefully controlled action of ASIP. In mice, two mutations on &quot;Agouti&quot; are responsible for yellow coats and marked obesity, with other health defects. Additionally, the &quot;Agouti&quot; locus is the site of mutations in several species that result in black-and-tan pigmentations.

One genetics testing lab began offering a test for another allele &quot;At&quot;, thought to be responsible for seal brown, but it was later found to be inaccurate and is no longer offered.

==Dun==

&quot;Dun&quot; is one of several genes that control the saturation or intensity of pigment in the coat. &quot;Dun&quot; is unique in that it is simple dominant, affects eumelanin and pheomelanin equally, and does not affect the eyes or skin. Horses with the dominant &quot;D&quot; allele (&quot;D/D&quot; or &quot;D/d&quot; genotype) exhibit hypomelanism of the body coat, while &quot;d/d&quot; horses have otherwise intense, saturated coat colors. The mane, tail, head, legs, and primitive markings are not diluted. Zygosity for &quot;Dun&quot; can be determined with a DNA test.

The &quot;Dun&quot; locus is TBX3 on equine chromosome 8. The molecular cause behind the dun coat colors is not entirely understood, but the dilution effect comes from the placement of pigment in only part of the hair. The associated coat colors were assigned to the &quot;Dun&quot; locus in 1974 by Stefan Adalsteinsson, separate from &quot;Cream&quot;, with the presence of dun dilution indicated by the dominant &quot;D&quot; allele. The dominant &quot;D&quot; allele is relatively rare compared to the alternative &quot;d&quot; allele, and for this reason, the dominant allele is often treated as a mutation. However, the pervasive coat color among wild equids is dun, and researchers from Darwin to modern day consider dun to be the wildtype state.

An older non-dun mutation was found in 2015 and named non-dun 1. It creates primitive markings but does not dilute the base color, and is co-dominant with the more common non-dun 2 but recessive to dun.

===Dun phenotypes===
* D/D (&quot;+/+&quot;, &quot;D+/D+&quot;) wildtype, homozygous dominant. Visually, the horse may be bay dun, grullo, red dun, palomino dun, amber dun, gray, and so on. Such a horse will always pass on the &quot;D&quot; allele and will therefore always have dun offspring.
* D/d (&quot;+/d&quot;, &quot;D+/Dd&quot;) wildtype, heterozygous. Visually indistinguishable from the homozygous &quot;D&quot; horse.
* d/d (&quot;Dd/Dd&quot;) non-dun, homozygous recessive. The entire coat, barring the influence of other alleles, is a rich, saturated color. The primitive markings are no longer visible. The horse may be chestnut, bay, black, gray, palomino, and so on.

==Cream==
&quot;Cream&quot; is another one of the genes that control the saturation or dilution of pigment in the coat. &quot;Cream&quot; differs from &quot;Dun&quot; in that it affects the coat, skin, and eyes, and unlike &quot;Dun&quot;, is dosage dependent rather than simple dominant. Furthermore, the effects on eumelanin and pheomelanin are not equal. Horses with the homozygous recessive genotype (&quot;C/C&quot;) are not affected by cream. Heterozygotes (&quot;CCr/C&quot;) have one cream allele and one wildtype non-cream allele. Such horses, sometimes called &quot;single-dilutes&quot;, exhibit dilution red pigment in the coat, eyes, and skin to yellow or gold, while eumelanin is largely unaffected. Homozygotes (&quot;CCr/CCr&quot;) have two cream alleles, and are sometimes called &quot;double-dilutes.&quot; Homozygous creams exhibit strong dilution of both red and black pigment in the coat, eyes, and skin to ivory or cream. The skin is rosy-pink and the eyes are pale blue. Cream is now identifiable by DNA test.

The &quot;Cream&quot; locus is occupied by the Solute carrier family 45, member 2 (&quot;SLC45A2&quot;) gene, also called the &quot;Membrane associated transport protein&quot; or &quot;Matp&quot; gene. The &quot;Matp&quot; gene encodes a protein illustrated to have roles in melanogenesis in humans, mice, and medaka, though the specific action is not known.

Mutations in the human &quot;Matp&quot; gene result in several distinct forms of Oculocutaneous albinism, Type IV as well as normal variations in skin and hair color. Mice affected by a condition homologous to cream, called &quot;underwhite&quot;, exhibit irregularly shaped melanosomes, which are the organelles within melanocytes that directly produce pigment. The first descriptions of the dosage-dependent genetic control of the palomino coat color occurred early on in equine coat color inheritance research. However, the distinction between &quot;Dun&quot; and &quot;Cream&quot; remained poorly understood until Stefan Adalsteinsson wrote &quot;Inheritance of the palomino color in Icelandic horses&quot; in 1974. The mutation responsible, a single nucleotide polymorphism in Exon 2 resulting in an aspartic acid-to-asparagine substitution (N153D), was located and described in 2003 by a research team in France.

===Cream phenotypes===
* C/C homozygous wildtype. Visually, the horse may be any color other than the cream dilute shades of palomino, buckskin, smoky black, cremello, perlino, smoky cream, and so on. 
* CCr/C heterozygous. The colors most commonly associated with this genotype are palomino, buckskin, and smoky black, though the phenotype may vary depending on other factors. Any pheomelanin in the coat is diluted to yellow or gold, and the eyes and skin are often slightly lighter than unaffected horses.
* CCr/CCr homozygous. The colors most commonly associated with this genotype are cremello, perlino, and smoky cream. Regardless, the coat will be cream- or ivory-colored, and the skin a rosy-pink. The eyes are pale blue.

==Champagne==
&quot;Champagne&quot; is a gene that controls the saturation or dilution of pigment in the coat. Unlike &quot;Cream&quot;, &quot;Champagne&quot; is not strongly dosage-dependent, and affects both types of pigment equally. &quot;Champagne&quot; differs from &quot;Dun&quot; in that it affects the color of the coat, skin, and eyes, and in that the unaffected condition is the wildtype. Horses with the dominant &quot;CH&quot; allele (&quot;CH/CH&quot; or &quot;CH/ch&quot; genotype) exhibit hypomelanism of the body coat, such that phaeomelanin is diluted to gold and eumelanin is diluted to tan. Affected horses are born with blue eyes which darken to amber, green, or light brown, and bright pink skin which acquires darker freckling with maturity. The difference in phenotype between the homozygous (&quot;CH/CH&quot;) and heterozygous (&quot;CH/ch&quot;) horse may be subtle, in that the coat of the homozygote may be a shade lighter, with less mottling. Horses with the homozygous recessive genotype (&quot;ch/ch&quot;) are not affected by champagne. Champagne is now identifiable by DNA test.

The &quot;Champagne&quot; locus is occupied by the Solute carrier family 36, member 1 (&quot;SLC36A1&quot;) gene, which encodes the &quot;Proton-coupled amino acid transporter 1&quot; (&quot;PAT1&quot;) protein. This protein is one of many which is involved in active transport. The gene associated with the &quot;Cream&quot; coat colors is also a solute carrier, and orthologous genes in humans, mice, and other species are also linked to coat color phenotypes. The single nucleotide polymorphism responsible for the champagne phenotype is a missense mutation in exon 2, in which a C is replaced with a G, such that a threonine is replaced with arginine. This mutation was identified and described by an American research team in 2008.

===Champagne phenotypes===
* ch/ch (&quot;N/N&quot;) wildtype, homozygous recessive. Visually, the horse may be any color other than the champagne shades.
* CH/ch (&quot;CH/N&quot;) heterozygous. The colors most commonly associated with this genotype are gold champagne, amber champagne, and classic champagne, though the exact phenotype depends on a variety of factors. At birth, the skin is bright pink and the eyes bright blue, darkening to freckled and light brown or green, respectively, with age. Both red and black pigment in the hair are also diluted.
* CH/CH homozygous champagne. Homozygotes, which will never produce non-champagne offspring, are indistinguishable from heterozygotes except that their freckling may be sparser, and their coats a shade lighter.

<doc id="1287352" wikidata="Q3069060" url="?curid=1287352" title="Violin Sonata No. 35 (Mozart)">
<text>The Sonata in A for [[Violin]] and [[keyboard instrument|Keyboard]], K. 526, was written in Vienna in 1787 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It is placed in the Köchel catalogue between the string serenade &quot;Eine kleine Nachtmusik&quot; (K. 525) and the opera &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (K. 527).

There are three movements:

It is the last of Mozart&#x27;s substantial violin sonatas, with the only remaining work he wrote for this combination, the sonata in F, K. 547 of 1788 being more of a sonatina. It is also considered by several authors, including Alfred Einstein, to be part of his last series of three great violin sonatas which starts with the Regina Strinasacchi sonata in B K. 454 from 1784 (his annus mirabilis, the year also of the six great piano concertos 14 – 19 and the quintet for piano and winds) and continuing with the E violin sonata from December 1785. The first movement is a movement in sonata form in time, with more evenly divided contributions between the two instruments than in the earliest of his sonatas, an exposition divided between its two tonal groups (A and E major), and a compact but unwasteful development section.

The second movement has, for a classical period slow sonata form, an extended development—it is much more characteristic for slow movements in sonata form, especially middle slow movements, to have exceptionally brief middle sections before the return of the main material, and that is not the case here. The passage just before the recapitulation brings a sequence of enharmonic changes and, for the period, wide modulations. The finale is a rondo with a particularly agitated middle section.

<text>The Royal New Brunswick Regiment (RNBR) is a reserve infantry regiment of the Canadian Army based in New Brunswick. It was formed in 1954 by amalgamation of The Carleton and York Regiment, The New Brunswick Scottish and The North Shore (New Brunswick) Regiment as the New Brunswick Regiment. The &quot;Royal&quot; designation was added in 1956. The Royal New Brunswick Regiment is part of 37 Canadian Brigade Group, 5th Canadian Division. The RNBR holds 65 battle honours mostly by perpetuation of the regiments it was formed from.

== Creation ==
The regiment was formed in 1954 by the amalgamation of The Carleton and York Regiment, The New Brunswick Scottish and The North Shore (New Brunswick) Regiment. From 1954 to 2012, it consisted of two battalions with the former The Carleton and York Regiment and The New Brunswick Scottish forming the 1st Battalion and The North Shore Regiment forming the 2nd Battalion. However, in 2012, the 2nd Battalion was once again reorganised as a distinct regiment, The North Shore (New Brunswick) Regiment.

==Present structure==

<text>Plácido Enrique Polanco (; born October 10, 1975) is a Dominican-American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals, Philadelphia Phillies, Detroit Tigers and Miami Marlins. He was a second baseman, third baseman, and shortstop. He was twice voted to start in Major League Baseball All-Star Games: in 2007, and again in 2011. Polanco retired with the highest all-time career fielding percentage for second basemen at 99.27% and the highest all-time career fielding percentage for third basemen at 98.34% which still appear to be records.

On July 9, 2008, Polanco received his U.S. citizenship along with 99 other people in a ceremony at Comerica Park that preceded the Tigers–Indians game. He wore his Tigers uniform for the ceremony.

==Playing career==

=== St. Louis Cardinals ===
Polanco was drafted on June 2, 1994, by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 19th round of the 1994 MLB draft. In 1996, he led the Florida State League with 157 hits and 137 games played while playing with Single-A St. Petersburg. Polanco was promoted to the major leagues in 1998. His first major league hit was a single off Cincinnati Reds starting pitcher Brett Tomko on July 5, 1998. Earning the starting third base job in 2001, his low strikeout/walk ratio and extra base hits numbers established Polanco as a contact hitter.

===Philadelphia Phillies===

On July 29, 2002, Polanco, Mike Timlin, and Bud Smith were acquired by the Phillies for Scott Rolen, Doug Nickle, and cash. Polanco was shifted to second base as David Bell was signed from free agency to play third base. He began to develop power while playing for the Phillies as he hit 14 and 17 home runs in the following two years, compared with just nine in 2002.

===Detroit Tigers===

The Phillies traded him to the Detroit Tigers in a June 2005 in a trade for veteran right-hander Ugueth Urbina and infielder Ramón Martínez, allowing the Phillies to play Chase Utley every day at second base. Polanco finished the 2005 season batting .338 with the Tigers, and also having a career year with regards to OPS, finishing the season at .847. In addition, he led the majors in lowest strikeout percentage (5.0%) for the season.

Polanco was a key player in the 2006 American League Division Series and 2006 American League Championship Series (ALCS) for the Tigers, being named Most Valuable Player of the ALCS. However, he did not record a single hit in the 2006 World Series, in which the Tigers lost to the Cardinals in five games.

In 2007, Polanco set a new major-league record for second basemen by playing in his 144th consecutive errorless game on August 13, in a 7–2 loss to the Oakland Athletics. Curt Flood currently holds the record for consecutive errorless games with 226, but he played center field. Polanco appeared to have his streak snapped at 147 games when he was charged with an error in the first inning of the August 24 game vs. the New York Yankees. However, the next day, after conferring with the umpiring crew, the official scorer determined the error was instead charged to first baseman Marcus Thames. This extended the streak to 149 games. Polanco also broke the record for consecutive chances without an error by a second baseman on July 31. He passed Luis Castillo&#x27;s mark of 647. Polanco finished the 2007 season without making an error, thereby becoming the first everyday second baseman in MLB history to play an entire season without committing an error. This, in addition to contributing to 101 double plays, earned Polanco his first Gold Glove Award.

In addition to his fielding feats, Polanco batted a career-high .341 in 2007, and reached a career high in hits with 200. He also had the lowest strikeout percentage in the major leagues (5.1%). For his efforts, he was given the Silver Slugger Award at second base. He was voted by the fans to start in the 2007 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, his first one. At the end of the season, he was voted by the fans as the 2007 MLB &quot;This Year in Baseball Awards&quot; Defensive Player of the Year.

Polanco won another Gold Glove Award in 2009.

===Return to the Phillies===
After declaring free agency, Polanco signed a three-year contract for $18 million to return to the Phillies, with a mutual option for a fourth year. He was signed with the Phillies to replace Pedro Feliz at third base.

In 2011, Polanco was elected by fan balloting to be the starting third baseman in the All-Star game. He was unable to play in the All-Star game due to an injury, and Scott Rolen replaced him in the starting lineup. At the conclusion of the 2011 season, Polanco received his third Gold Glove, making him only the second baseball player in history to receive the award at more than one position. Darin Erstad had previously won Gold Gloves in the outfield and at first base.

On May 14, 2012, Polanco reached the 2,000 hit mark with an eighth-inning home run off David Carpenter of the Houston Astros.

On October 29, the Phillies elected to decline their half of a $5.5M mutual option, instead electing to pay Polanco a $1M buyout.

===Miami Marlins===

On December 20, 2012, the Miami Marlins and Polanco agreed to a one-year contract worth $2.75 million, making him the second-highest paid player on the team. The Marlins did not re-sign Polanco after the 2013 season and he was unable to find a contract in free agency for the 2014 season. In March 2015, he claimed to be &quot;90 percent&quot; retired but remained open to the possibility of returning to playing or launching a coaching career under the right circumstances.

===Retirement===
On August 14, 2016, Polanco officially retired with the Phillies.

Polanco was eligible to be elected into the Hall of Fame in 2019, but received only two votes, earning less than 5% of the vote and becoming ineligible for the 2020 ballot.

Polanco joined the Los Angeles Dodgers front office as a special assistant in player development in 2019.

===Career statistics===
In 1,927 games over 16 seasons, Polanco posted a .297 batting average (2142-for-7214) with 1009 runs, 348 doubles, 32 triples, 104 home runs, 723 RBI, 81 stolen bases, 429 walks, .343 on-base percentage, and .397 slugging percentage. Defensively, he finished his career with an overall .990 fielding percentage playing at second base, third base, and shortstop. In postseason play, in 38 games, he batted .248 (32-for-129) with 11 runs, 4 doubles, 13 RBI, 3 stolen bases, and 11 walks.

==Personal life==
Polanco and wife Lily have a daughter, Aide Rose, and a son, Ishmael. He is a close friend of former teammate Albert Pujols, who is godfather to Polanco&#x27;s son.

In July , while with the Tigers, Polanco became a naturalized American citizen, taking the oath of citizenship at Comerica Park.

<doc id="1287364" wikidata="Q16152252" url="?curid=1287364" title="Music of South Carolina">
<text>South Carolina is one of the Southern United States and has produced a number of renowned performers of jazz, rock, blues, R&amp;B, country, bluegrass and other popular styles.

==Official music==
South Carolina is noted for being the birthplace of beach music, an offshoot of early R&amp;B and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll that featured a shuffling beat which spawned the dance called The Shag. This Myrtle Beach-area dance is the official State Dance, although South Carolina has also contributed to two other famous dances, the Charleston in the 1920s, and the Big Apple in the 1930s.

South Carolina also has two official state songs: &quot;Carolina&quot;, composed in 1911 with words by Henry Timrod and music by Anne Custis Burgess, and &quot;South Carolina on My Mind&quot;, written in 1985 by Buzz Arledge and Hank Martin. The State also has an &quot;official music&quot;, Negro spirituals, sacred Christian songs originally developed in the 19th century.

==South Carolina musicians==
Perhaps the best known rock band to hail from South Carolina is Columbia&#x27;s Hootie &amp; the Blowfish, but other groups such as Spartanburg&#x27;s The Marshall Tucker Band, The Swinging Medallions, Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs, alternative metal band Crossfade from Columbia, Charleston&#x27;s indie Band of Horses, Southern rock band Needtobreathe, and Blue Dogs also hail from the Palmetto State.
Jazz saxophonist Chris Potter from Columbia has released 20 CDs as a leader and performed as a sideman on more than 150 other albums. He is the leader of the &quot;Chris Potter Underground&quot; and has regularly performed with many world-class jazz musicians including Dave Holland and Pat Metheny. In the December, 2014 issue of &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine, which featured the results of the annual readers poll, Potter was named the number one tenor saxophonist in the world.

Other prominent musicians and singers born and/or raised in the state include soul/jazz musicians James Brown, Brook Benton, Maxine Brown, Dizzy Gillespie, Chubby Checker, Eartha Kitt, Peabo Bryson, Arthur &quot;Guitar Boogie&quot; Smith, Cat Anderson, Tom Delaney, Freddie Green, Drink Small, Johnny Helms, Terry Rosen, Jabbo Smith, Bill Benford, Tommy Benford, Nick Ashford, Darius Rucker; and rock/country musicians John Phillips, Josh Turner, Bill Anderson, Edwin McCain, Duncan Sheik, Rob Thomas, Marcus King, Walter Hyatt, David Ball, and Esquerita.
==Country/bluegrass==
The state&#x27;s bluegrass scene has produced important bands such as The Hired Hands featuring pioneering three-finger banjo player Dewitt &quot;Snuffy&quot; Jenkins and old time fiddler Homer &quot;Pappy&quot; Sherrill. Other notable groups are The Hinson Girls, featuring four sisters from Lancaster, and Palmetto Blue, featuring two South Carolina Folk Heritage Award Recipients: Chris Boutwell (2014) and Ashley Carder (2012), along with vocalist and bassist Shellie Davis, banjoist Steve Willis, flatpicking guitarist Edward Dalton, and South Carolina junior fiddle champion Ella Thomas. Bluesmen Pink Anderson (namesake for Pink Floyd; buried in Spartanburg) and Reverend Gary Davis were both from Laurens, S.C. Charleston&#x27;s Roger Bellow, a South Carolina Folk Heritage Award Recipient and former host of the &quot;Vintage Country&quot; radio show on SCETV radio and WYLA-LP, leads the long-running country/swing band The Drifting Troubadours.

==Soul/R&amp;B==
The Beach music classic &quot;Stay&quot; by Lancaster&#x27;s Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs was #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1960. James Brown&#x27;s (buried in Aiken County) soul and funk song &quot;I Got You (I Feel Good)&quot; was #3 on the Hot 100 in 1965, and #1 on the Rhythm and Blues Singles. Greenville&#x27;s Peabo Bryson&#x27;s R&amp;B song &quot;A Whole New World&quot; from &quot;Aladdin&quot; was #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1993.

==Rock/pop==

Hootie &amp; The Blowfish&#x27;s roots rock song &quot;Only Wanna Be With You&quot;, was number one on the Mainstream Top 40 chart in 1995. Hootie&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Cracked Rear View&quot;, was the best-selling album of 1995, the seventh best-selling album of the 1990s, and is the 19th best-selling album in the United States. Their second album, &quot;Fairweather Johnson&quot;, went to number one on the Billboard 200 in 1996.

The Upstate band Needtobreathe had a number two album on the Billboard 200 with &quot;Hard Love&quot; in 2016. Indie folk singer Iron &amp; Wine had a number two placing on the Billboard 200 with &quot;Kiss Each Other Clean&quot; in 2011. Country star Darius Rucker has had two number two albums on the Billboard 200: &quot;Charleston, SC 1966&quot; in 2010 and &quot;True Believers&quot; in 2013, as well as nine number one songs on the Country Airplay chart from 2008 to 2020. Country singer Josh Turner from Florence County had a number two on the Billboard 200 with &quot;Your Man&quot; in 2006. Lee Brice from Sumter had two number five placings on the Billboard 200 with &quot;Hard 2 Love&quot; in 2012 and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; in 2014. Toro y Moi, a popular electronic artist (who had a number one album on the Dance Chart with &quot;Anything in Return&quot; in 2013), and rapper Lil Ru are both from Columbia.

Urban centers in the state including Greenville, Columbia, Myrtle Beach, and Charleston continue to have thriving rock and hip hop scenes.

==Prominent venues==
The region of Myrtle Beach has been home to the well-known &quot;Carolina Opry&quot;, a country music-based variety show, established in 1986 by singer, producer and entrepreneur, Calvin Gilmore, South Carolina&#x27;s official country music ambassador, who continues to produce and perform in the show today. The &quot;Carolina Opry&quot; was the first live family entertainment venue on the Grand Strand and helped turn Myrtle Beach into one of the major centers for country music on the East Coast. Local venues include the &quot;Dolly Parton&#x27;s Pirates Voyage&quot;, one of many attractions owned by Dolly Parton, the &quot;Alabama Theater&quot;, named for the band Alabama. Other artists tried their hand with their own theaters which did not last, such as Ronnie Milsap and the Gatlin Brothers. Myrtle Beach is also home to the South Carolina State Bluegrass Festival. The Carolina Country Music Fest has been held on the Myrtle Beach boardwalk since 2015.

Outside of Myrtle Beach, the town of West Columbia is notable as the home of Bill Wells of the Blue Ridge Mountain Grass; he is the owner of a local music shop, which hosts a weekly bluegrass show at the &quot;Pickin&#x27; Parlor&quot;.

Lesser known venues include the Radio Room in Greenville, Ground Zero in Spartanburg, the New Brookland Tavern in West Columbia and the House of Blues in North Myrtle Beach as well as the Pour House on James Island, and the Music Farm with locations in downtown Charleston and Columbia. The Five Points district in Columbia features a variety of bands each year at its St. Patrick&#x27;s Day festival.

Charleston&#x27;s WYLA FM (97.5 mHz) programs almost entirely local and in-state artists. The station broadcasts 24 hours per day from studios at the Charleston County Main Library, where they also host live performances.

<text>Triloki Nath Madan (born 12 August 1933, in Kashmir, India) is an anthropologist, with a Ph.D from the Australian National University (1960). He is currently Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the Institute of Economic Growth, Delhi University, and Distinguished Senior Fellow (Adjunct), Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, Delhi. Of the teaching positions he held earlier, those at Lucknow and Dharwar lasted longest. He taught for short periods at several universities in India and abroad.

Haksar was born on August 12, 1933 into a Kashmiri Pandit family in the Downtown neighborhood of Srinagar, in the Kashmir Valley of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, within British India.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland in 1989. In 1994, he was made Docteur Honoris Causa by the University of Paris X (Nanterre). In 1995, he occupied the Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan Chair in Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Hyderabad. 

He has held visiting appointments at a number of universities including Harvard where he was Visiting Professor of Anthropology and of the History of Religion in 1984-85. The Indian Sociological Society gave him the Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008. 

His most noted work is &quot;Family and Kinship among the Pandits of Rural Kashmir&quot; (1966, 1989) which presented an account of the social life of Kashmiri Pandits. His more recent publications include,&quot;Modern Myths, Locked Minds: Secularism and Fundamentalism in India&quot; (1997, 2009), &quot;Images of the World: Essays on Religion, Secularism, and Culture&quot; (2005), and &quot;Sociological Traditions: Methods and Perspectives in the Sociology of India&quot; (2011).

He was presented with a Festschrift titled &quot;Tradition, Pluralism and Identity: In Honour of T.N. Madan&quot;, edited by Veena Das, Dipankar Gupta and Patricia Uberoi. Currently he lives in Delhi.

He was married to Uma Chaturvedi, a non-Kashmiri. She died in December 2013. They have two children.

<text>The Bern Physiologus (Bern, Burgerbibliothek, &quot;Codex Bongarsianus&quot; 318) is a 9th-century illuminated copy of the Latin translation of the &quot;Physiologus&quot;. It was probably produced at Reims about 825–850. It is believed to be a copy of a 5th-century manuscript. Many of its miniatures are set, unframed, into the text block, which was a characteristic of late-antique manuscripts. It is one of the oldest extant illustrated copies of the &quot;Physiologus&quot;.

<text>Halfway to Sanity is the tenth studio album by the American punk rock band Ramones, and their last album to feature drummer Richie Ramone. It was produced by Daniel Rey and released on September 15, 1987, by Sire Records. Recording sessions began that April at Intergalactic Studios in New York City, with the band recording instruments before vocals in order to learn songs more quickly. It fared well on charts outside the United States, but peaked at No. 172 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

The band members disagreed on many things during the album&#x27;s production, and producer Rey described them as impatient. The band toured the world following the album&#x27;s release, but certain show dates were cancelled after Richie left the band due to financial conflicts with Johnny. The band hired Blondie drummer Clem Burke (who took the pseudonym &quot;Elvis Ramone&quot;) for two shows, until Marky Ramone returned.
Genres varied significantly throughout the album, with some songs showing the influence of hard rock, heavy metal music, and crossover thrash, while others showcased a bubblegum pop sound. Additionally, Joey is heard singing a duet with Blondie vocalist Debbie Harry on &quot;Go Lil&#x27; Camaro Go&quot;. Despite receiving mixed critical reviews, Stephen Thomas Erlewine later wrote that the album was the last time the band &quot;still sounded like they mattered.&quot;

==Background==
Prior to producing the album, Daniel Rey had opened for the Ramones in the late 1970s as a member of Shrapnel. He had worked with lead singer Joey Ramone and lead guitarist Johnny Ramone separately when writing songs for &quot;Too Tough to Die&quot;. &quot;I was producing a lot of young bands in my basement,&quot; Rey explained. &quot;Johnny heard one and said, &#x27;It&#x27;s better than our last record.&#x27; He knew that he could get me cheap and I was the only person who got along with Johnny and Joey at the same time.&quot; In his 2012 autobiography, &quot;Commando&quot;, Johnny Ramone stated that this period was a &quot;stressful time&quot; for the band. 

==Production==
Recording sessions for &quot;Halfway to Sanity&quot; began in early 1987 at Intergalactic Studios in New York City, described by Rey as &quot;a dingy place in midtown.&quot; Drums, guitars and bass guitar were all recorded earlier in the afternoon, while the vocal track was always recorded later in the evening. Rey explained that they did this because &quot;it was quicker to learn songs without any vocal, so they did.&quot; Joey, however, wanted to work out &quot;how to phrase his singing&quot; and was not a fan of this method of recording. Johnny stated that Dee Dee Ramone, while credited as bass player on the album, didn&#x27;t actually play on it, with producer Daniel Rey playing his parts instead.

On the band&#x27;s relationship with producer Daniel Rey, Johnny stated that no one involved with the album would listen to Rey nor let him make the decisions he needed to, adding that Joey and drummer Richie Ramone made it particularly difficult for Rey because they wanted to remix or change tracks. Richie did not get along with Rey, saying that the two would &quot;butt heads&quot; often due to the fact that he only liked writing songs with one other person. Richie has explained that this may have been the reason why he never co-wrote any songs on the album with Joey, saying that Rey &quot;always came with the package.&quot; Tour manager Monte Melnick, on the other hand, said Rey eventually befriended all the band members. In 2018, Richie stated that the rift between him and Rey occurred when Richie remixed five songs on the album on a request from Joey and although Johnny approved the work, he refused to credit him for it on the album. 

Richie added that Johnny, along with their manager Gary Kurfirst, made the album process difficult by keeping the band on a tight budget. He explained that he himself wanted the music to be more radio-friendly and promote it more so they might have a hit album, but Johnny and Kurfirst did not think it would make a difference. Richie would later recall: &quot;Why would you not want an album to be as successful as it could be? Gary Kurfirst seemed to want to keep the Ramones an underground band, I guess his thinking was, he&#x27;d profit more.&quot;

The band&#x27;s publicist Ida Langsam agreed that the band and their record company all felt the need to keep to a strict budget for recording, production and promotion of the Ramones&#x27; music. She pointed out that just because much of their album process was done &quot;cut-rate,&quot; it did not mean that their performance on the album was not done well. Rather they were trying to find people who could do things more cheaply, along with cheaper places to record, such as Intergalactic Studios, where they had also recorded their previous album, &quot;Animal Boy&quot;. Langsam went on to say that the Ramones were &quot;never afforded the respect a band of their caliber should have,&quot; insisting that other bands who were &quot;much less worthy&quot; were more respected. &quot;Everybody thought of them as the local band,&quot; she continued, &quot;everybody&#x27;s friends—&#x27;when are you going to break, when are you going to get big, when are you going to reach stardom?&#x27;&quot;

Rey claimed that the band was very impatient during the album process, and noted that members, especially Johnny and Joey, weren&#x27;t getting along. &quot;John was fast in the studio,&quot; recalls George Tabb, who was recording with his band the False Prophets at Intergalactic at the same time the Ramones recorded &quot;Halfway to Sanity&quot;. He called it humorous &quot;because John would be going, &#x27;Enough, enough, it sounds right.&#x27; And Joey, the artist, would go, &#x27;I gotta do my vocals, I gotta do my vocals,&#x27; and the drummer&#x27;s going, &#x27;But my drums!&#x27; Johnny was like, &#x27;Fuck it. It&#x27;s the Ramones. It is what it is and comes out like that.&#x27; And he was right. It was the Ramones. He was a good businessman about it.&quot;

In his book &quot;Commando&quot;, Johnny Ramone concluded that &quot;the tracks on this one aren&#x27;t the best. I always had a problem bringing songs into the band unless I was sure they were going to be very good. [...] The other guys brought in things that sucked, but they acted like they were great.&quot; However, he cited &quot;I Wanna Live&quot;, &quot;Weasel Face&quot;, &quot;Bop &#x27;til You Drop&quot; and &quot;Garden of Serenity&quot; as the album&#x27;s highlights and awarded the album a &quot;B−&quot; grade. 

This is the first Ramones album since &quot;Leave Home&quot;—and their last—to clock in at under 30 minutes.

==Musical style and lyrics==
The album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;I Wanna Live&quot;, features heavy feedback and a musical style closer to hard rock than punk. Described by author Dave Thompson as similar to contemporary &quot;romantic melodies,&quot; the song was written by Dee Dee, who quoted the lyrics &quot;As I load my pistol / Fine German steel&quot; years later in a photo session with Ken Hinchey and Mike Vought as he loaded a gun. The song runs 2 minutes 39 seconds and despite its brevity was called &quot;too long&quot; by music journalist Everett True. Both the next track, &quot;Bop &#x27;Til You Drop&quot;, and the fifth track, &quot;Go Lil&#x27; Camaro Go&quot;, were described by True as &quot;dire &#x27;fun,&#x27;&quot; saying it sounded &quot;as if they&#x27;ve been tossed off in a couple seconds—and probably were&quot; and that Joey sang with a &quot;drink-ravaged voice.&quot; Thompson wrote that &quot;Go Lil&#x27; Camaro Go&quot;, a duet with Blondie&#x27;s Debbie Harry, had a style similar to bubblegum pop. Track three, &quot;Garden of Serenity&quot;, incorporates elements used in crossover thrash. The next track is &quot;Weasel Face&quot;, written by Dee Dee and Johnny about, according to Johnny, a fan &quot;who had a real weasel face. He came to all our gigs in the South; he followed us around. I think he was from Mississippi.&quot; Side A concludes with Richie&#x27;s &quot;I Know Better&quot;, which, along with &quot;Go Lil&#x27; Camaro Go&quot;, was described by AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine as having a &quot;solid&quot; hook.

Joey wrote the opening track for Side B, &quot;Death of Me&quot;, as well as &quot;A Real Cool Time&quot;, which True said was a tribute to &quot;summer beach&quot; parties and &quot;New York Cat Clubs,&quot; and compared the melody line to the Who&#x27;s &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot;. The album&#x27;s longest song is track 11, &quot;Bye Bye Baby&quot;, at 4 minutes 33 seconds. It was described as a &quot;tear-jerking&quot; piece by True, and was influenced by &#x27;50s/early &#x27;60s girl group pop. He wrote that it features a &quot;beautiful chiming guitar sound&quot; that &quot;stands out like a sore thumb&quot; compared to the other songs on the album, because Joey &quot;sings instead of shouting.&quot; The song was deemed &quot;Phil Spector-ish&quot; in the WEG Publication&#x27;s &quot;Digital Audio and Compact Disc Review&quot;, who also described the album&#x27;s final track, &quot;Worm Man&quot;, as having a &quot;hardcore punk thrashing&quot; style. while True said the latter was similar to the work of Black Flag.

==Cover art and photography==
The photography for &quot;Halfway to Sanity&quot; was done by George DuBose, who had also done photography for the band&#x27;s previous three releases (&quot;Subterranean Jungle&quot;, &quot;Too Tough to Die&quot;, and &quot;Animal Boy&quot;). The front cover&#x27;s picture was taken in an old stairwell in Chinatown, where they had DuBose&#x27;s cousin and his cousin&#x27;s friend—who are credited as &quot;Husky Bros.&quot; on the &quot;Halfway to Sanity&quot; liner notes—block off the crowd while the photo session was in place. DuBose and other crew members set up red lighting and a fog machine. After DuBose&#x27;s camera went through three reels of film, Johnny insisted that was enough, to which DuBose replied that the record company was paying him a lot of money for the shoot, so they should make it worthwhile. The session, however, only lasted 10 to 15 minutes, and was done in a poorly lit area, which Johnny said was &quot;pretty good not to make us look old, and it was getting harder and harder.&quot; The back cover photograph features green tombstones in a Jewish cemetery. Dubose&#x27;s photos for the inner sleeve depict &quot;Peking ducks hanging in the window of a restaurant, with glaze dripping off their tails.&quot;

==Tour and personnel changes==
To promote the album, the band played a handful of gigs in South America in February 1987. During the spring and summer of 1987, they toured the United States. At a concert on August 12 in East Hampton, New York, Richie left the band due to financial conflicts with Johnny. Richie stated that he had asked to be given a small percentage of the merchandise income based on his tenure with the band and their use of his name and image, which he claimed Joey and Dee Dee was in favor of, but Johnny would refuse. Richie said that he never felt entitled to a large share as he was not a founding member, but that it was about being a part of the band rather than a hired hand and mentioned feeling left out on tours when the other members would go cash their merchandise checks. Joey would later state, &quot;I felt screwed. Me and Richie were friends. He was more than just the drummer. But he was out for himself. He said he would do the New York shows for $500 a night. I&#x27;m sure he felt he had us by the balls, as our album was coming out.&quot; Richie later said that he had heard a rumour that Johnny was going to fire him even if he played the shows and that convinced him not to come back to the band. DuBose also explained that Richie &quot;quit right before a gig and wasn&#x27;t very professional.&quot; 

Johnny began asking around to see if they could find a replacement drummer, at least for the remainder of the tour. Clem Burke of Blondie filled in for Richie for two shows, performing under the alias Elvis Ramone, on August 28 in Providence, Rhode Island and August 29 in Trenton, New Jersey. Johnny deemed the whole situation a &quot;disaster&quot; because of Burke&#x27;s drumming style, commenting that &quot;double-time on the hi-hat was totally alien to him.&quot; Burke was criticized for playing &quot;Durango 95&quot;&#x27;s fills incorrectly, and for misplaying the introduction on &quot;Do You Remember Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Radio?&quot;, forcing Johnny and Dee Dee to improvise on stage. He was also reportedly unable to maintain the faster tempo of the songs &quot;Freak of Nature&quot; and &quot;Gimme Gimme Shock Treatment&quot;.

Because of this, the band&#x27;s previous drummer, Marky Ramone (who had replaced original drummer Tommy Ramone), was asked to return. He had been fired after &quot;Subterranean Jungle&quot;, partially for his drumming style but mostly because of his alcoholism. Once he was sober, however, he began playing in Richie Stotts&#x27;s heavy metal band King Flux, as well as his own band, M-80. Richie&#x27;s response to Marky&#x27;s return was that it &quot;would never happen&quot; but it did. Marky had a meeting with John, rehearsed a couple of Ramones songs and said, &quot;Marc, it&#x27;s like you never left.&quot;

Within a week of Burke&#x27;s departure, Marky was touring with the band again. The first show Marky played was on September 4 in Oyster Bay, Long Island.

During a sold-out Paris concert, fans who were not able to get in to see the performance began to throw stones at the venue, and were consequently tear-gassed by police. It was also common to see moshing and stage diving at their shows, but the band members discouraged this type of behavior. &quot;They hated it and they tried to stop it as much as possible,&quot; artist and the band&#x27;s lighting director Arturo Vega recalled, &quot;but it would happen. Kids are really resourceful. Once the lawsuits started coming in, a lot of clubs tried to ban it, too. Sometimes the security made it difficult for them, you know. Once, we were in Tijuana—and of course in Tijuana, who cares! They were jumping from a balcony that was at least 20 feet (6 m) high. Jumping into the crowd. It was too much. It was great.&quot;

The band was banned from playing at Boston University on the grounds that they promoted &quot;rowdiness, destructiveness, and drug use.&quot; In response, the University&#x27;s Program Council organized an anti-censorship protest rally in Marsh Plaza. At the rally, Joey announced, &quot;We&#x27;re here to uphold the honor of the students and the Ramones,&quot; and pointed out that their performances never incited violence. The Ramones&#x27; 1988 tour would have roughly a hundred gigs in the United States, Finland, Japan, United Kingdom, and elsewhere. While touring in Puerto Rico, the band performed for around 2,000 surfers at the World Surfing Championships. These shows were dubbed the &quot;Ramones Non-Stop World Tour&quot; by fans.

==Reception==
===Critical===

&quot;Halfway to Sanity&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. When it was released in September 1987, the &quot;New York Post&quot; praised it as another well produced album by the Ramones, and &quot;Billboard&quot; said Sire should have released &quot;Go Lil&#x27; Camaro Go&quot; as a single. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau gave the album a &quot;C+&quot;, writing that, while he felt pained to say it, &quot;with Richie or whoever on the lam, Dee Dee moonlighting as a punk-rapper, Joey frequenting all-acoustic showcases, and Johnny Johnny, a great band has finally worn down into a day job for night people.&quot; However, in the United Kingdom, the album received virtually no attention from professional critics. Ramones fanzine writer Mark Bannister explained that critics there thought the album &quot;didn&#x27;t sound right without some more of Joey&#x27;s songs to balance out Dee Dee&#x27;s. There was no equilibrium.&quot; 

In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album one and a half stars out of five, calling it a &quot;much sharper record&quot; than its predecessor only because it did not overlook the band&#x27;s &quot;trashy pop roots.&quot; While he found the album to be &quot;inconsistent&quot;, he praised it as the last release where the band &quot;still sounded like they mattered.&quot; 

===Commercial===

The album entered the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 on October 10, 1987 at position 174, moving to its peak at 172 one week later, and spent its last week on the chart at No. 200 on October 24. It peaked at No. 78 on the UK Albums Chart the same day it entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, although it only ranked in the United Kingdom for one week. On the Netherlands MegaCharts, the album entered at its peak position of 68 on October 10, 1987, staying on the chart for a single week as well. Likewise, it only stayed on the on Swedish Sverigetopplistan chart for one week, peaking at No. 43 on September 14, 1987.

== Later use ==
Two of the tracks on &quot;Halfway to Sanity&quot;, &quot;Bop &#x27;Til You Drop&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Live&quot;, were featured on the band&#x27;s first compilation album release, &quot;Ramones Mania&quot;. Both &quot;Garden of Serenity&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Live&quot; were included on the &quot;Hey! Ho! Let&#x27;s Go: The Anthology&quot; greatest hits compilation, but no songs from the album were featured on &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. The 2006 video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Project 8&quot; featured &quot;I Wanna Live&quot; on the soundtrack, and the Polish metal band Behemoth covered &quot;I&#x27;m Not Jesus&quot; on their 2008 extended play &quot;Ezkaton&quot;.

<doc id="1287380" wikidata="Q7927142" url="?curid=1287380" title="Victoria Winters">
<text>Victoria &quot;Vicki&quot; Winters is a fictional character from the television Gothic soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; and its remakes of the same name. The role was originated by Alexandra Moltke on the ABC series from 1966 to 1968. After Moltke left to raise a family in 1968, actresses Betsy Durkin and Carolyn Groves briefly replaced her for only a handful of episodes, before Victoria was written out completely. Jaclyn Smith, who was married to &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; actor Roger Davis at the time, was offered the role when Moltke left the show, but she declined.

In the 1991 &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; series, which aired on NBC, actress Joanna Going assumed the part. The character was subsequently portrayed by Marley Shelton in the 2004 series. In the &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; film, Victoria is played by Bella Heathcote. A good-natured governess with a mysterious past, she is the &quot;de facto&quot; female lead in the various incarnations of the story.

==1966–1968==

===Arrival and early days===
Victoria was the prominent character on &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; for its first year of existence. For that year, each episode&#x27;s opening narration began with, &quot;My name is Victoria Winters...&quot;

She had been left at a foundling home in New York City, and thus, never knew her true parents—although monthly sums of money began to arrive mysteriously when she turned two. She received her surname from the season in which she arrived in New York. Evidently, Vicky attended some college before accepting the offer of a governess position in Collinsport, Maine. Upon her arrival in Collinsport, she met the brooding Burke Devlin (first played by Mitchell Ryan, later portrayed by Anthony George), with whom she would eventually become romantically involved. During the first episode, she also met a young waitress named Maggie Evans (Kathryn Leigh Scott) at the Collinsport Inn. Although Maggie derided Victoria for accepting the job at the Collinwood estate, the two women eventually became very good friends.

Victoria quickly became indispensable to Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (played by Joan Bennett), both as governess to Elizabeth&#x27;s troubled young nephew David Collins and companion to Elizabeth herself (although her initial quest to learn her true identity dismayed the family matriarch). For her own mysterious reasons, Elizabeth did not want Victoria to learn the truth. Victoria also became important as a family peacemaker, not to mention a stabilizing influence on Elizabeth&#x27;s daughter, the rebellious Carolyn Stoddard (Nancy Barrett) and on the troubled David (David Henesy), son of Elizabeth&#x27;s pompous and rather emotionally cold younger brother, Roger (Louis Edmonds). Slowly but surely, Victoria managed to form a bond with David. As she grew closer to Burke, she became embroiled in his old feud with the Collins family, all while she attempted to discover her origins. One early plotline involved Roger nearly dying in a car accident due to a bleed screw being removed from the hydraulic brake system of his car. Burke was a key suspect, but when Roger learned his own son David was the culprit, he dropped the investigation.

When fisherman Bill Malloy threatened to reveal Roger Collins&#x27;s guilt in the manslaughter trial which led to Burke Devlin&#x27;s wrongful conviction, he was murdered. Eventually, Victoria realized the killer was the disturbed caretaker Matthew Morgan (Thayer David). He kidnapped her and planned to kill her, but was frightened to death by the ghosts of Malloy, the Widows (women who had jumped from the cliffs after their husbands died), and Josette Collins. Josette would later become a key figure in Victoria&#x27;s life, as well as &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; history.

Shortly after Morgan&#x27;s death, David&#x27;s presumed-dead mother, Laura (Diana Millay) arrived, wanting to reunite with her son. Roger was reluctant, but Laura worked her charm on David, who was overjoyed to have a mother again. With the help of Josette&#x27;s ghost and others, a suspicious Victoria realized Laura was a phoenix who planned to take herself and David to fiery deaths. Vicky saved him just in time. David was safe, the threat was gone, and Burke had finally settled his vendetta against the Collins family. David truly loved and trusted Vicky now, where before he had been hostile and spiteful toward her. Things were better than they had been for Victoria in some time, but that was not to last.

===Enter Barnabas Collins===
Shortly after the ordeal with Laura Collins had ended, a mysterious man named Jason McGuire (Dennis Patrick) arrived in Collinsport and immediately convinced Elizabeth to let him stay at Collinwood. Victoria and the family were shocked (especially Carolyn) and put on the defensive when McGuire&#x27;s off-putting drifter friend Willie Loomis (played originally by James Hall for five episodes before John Karlen assumed, and became more well-known, in the role) joined him. Willie, a former small-time crook, soon proved too much even for Jason to put up with, and he ordered Willie to get out of town. Before leaving town, following a fight with Burke Devlin at the Blue Whale because he was harassing Maggie, Willie heard from David that the Collins family ancestors were buried with their personal jewels; Willie decided to help himself to the jewels by breaking into the Collins family mausoleum. In an effort to abscond with the jewels of Naomi Collins, he inadvertently discovered a secret room in the rear of the crypt. Inside was a single coffin wrapped in large, heavy chains. Willie removed the chains and opened the coffin. Rather than finding a cache of jewelry, however, Willie unwittingly freed Naomi’s son, Barnabas Collins (Jonathan Frid), who had been turned into a vampire 170 years before and was later chained in his coffin by his friend Ben Stokes (Thayer David) on the request of Barnabas’s father, Joshua Collins.

After being bitten by Barnabas, Willie then became his slave. Shortly after his release, Barnabas showed up at Collinwood and introduced himself, first to Elizabeth, then the rest of the family, as a &#x27;cousin&#x27; from England. Victoria was charmed, but was more concerned with Jason&#x27;s hold on Elizabeth especially when he forced her into marriage and, on her wedding day to Jason, Elizabeth could take no more and finally admitted the truth behind Jason’s hold on her: 18 years earlier, Elizabeth had killed her husband, Paul Stoddard, and that Jason, a friend of Paul’s, had buried his body in the Collinwood basement in a trunk, and that Jason had been blackmailing her with this information. Elizabeth also mentioned that she had confided this to Victoria and made her promise to keep this secret to herself. However, when Burke Devlin and Collinsport Sheriff George Patterson (Dana Elcar) went down to the basement to investigate, they dig up the trunk, and later showed both Elizabeth and Roger that Paul’s body was not in the trunk: it was in fact empty! Jason, apprehended by Patterson’s deputy after fleeing Collinwood, sheepishly revealed privately to Elizabeth that Paul had only been stunned when she hit him, that Jason later helped Stoddard disappear and lied to Elizabeth in order to get blackmail money in exchange for his silence. Elizabeth was furious that she had not only wasted 18 years of both never leaving Collinwood to guard this secret but also that Jason let her live with the guilt of believing that she killed Carolyn’s father. Though Elizabeth does not press charges against Jason, he was then ordered by Patterson to leave Collinsport for good. Before leaving town he meets with Willie to get him many jewels for Jason to sell but is angry when Willie brings him only one item. Not satisfied, Jason tries to rob the Old House, now Barnabas&#x27; property on Collinwood, but after greedily ignoring Willie’s frightening warnings about Barnabas, Jason, opening Barnabas’ coffin, meets his end, via strangulation, when the vampire’s hand reaches up to Jason’s throat. Barnabas and Willie later carry Jason’s body to the Collins family mausoleum where Barnabas orders Willie to bury it in the mausoleum’s secret room.

Victoria grows concerned about her friend Maggie, who becomes withdrawn and moody to everyone around her. Maggie was, in actuality, being enslaved by Barnabas due to her strong resemblance to his true love, Josette. Barnabas kidnaps Maggie and begins feeding off her blood. She is found with suspicious marks on her neck. He plans to make her his bride by thus controlling or hypnotizing her into being Josette, but with the help of the ghost of his little sister Sarah Collins, Maggie escapes. She is later institutionalized, and to protect her from the person who had kidnapped her, Maggie&#x27;s father, Sam Evans, Joe Haskell, and Doctor Dave Woodard decide to make everyone in Collinsport, including Barnabas, believe that Maggie is dead, and she is kept well-guarded afterwards for some months. Believing himself to be in the clear because of Maggie&#x27;s &#x27;death,&#x27; Barnabas eventually gives up on her and later tells Willie that he has chosen another girl to be his new Josette: Victoria Winters, and Barnabas begins to pursue her. Burke Devlin does not trust Barnabas and begins an investigation that ends only when Vicki begs him to stop. The men reach an uneasy truce, and Victoria and Burke become engaged before Devlin goes on an ill-fated plane trip to South America in 1967. Victoria believes that Burke has somehow survived when his body cannot be found. With Devlin gone, Barnabas begins to more actively pursue Victoria.

===Time travel=== 
During the second year of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, Victoria becomes unwittingly involved in Barnabas&#x27;s sinister plans. After a séance to contact Barnabas&#x27; sister, Sarah Collins, Victoria is magically transported to the past in 1795. A time paradox between the years 1795 and 1967 causes a rift in the timeband; a carriage overturns in 1795, exchanging Victoria with its occupant, Phyllis Wick, a governess hired by Naomi Collins. Victoria arrives at the Old Collins House and meets Collins ancestors who look just like the 20th Century Collins family she knows, but with different names, personalities, and relationships.

During this storyline, the origin of Barnabas&#x27;s transformation into a vampire is finally revealed. Victoria makes the mistake of describing the future to the denizens of the past; she is soon seized by the fanatical Reverend Trask and accused of witchcraft. Despite the best efforts of Peter Bradford, a law student and jailer who came to know Victoria and defended her at her trial, Victoria is sentenced to hang in 1796.

Although five months pass for Victoria in the past, Phyllis Wick experiences only five minutes in 1967. Realizing she is from the 18th century, the 20th century Collins family bombard her with questions, but Phyllis soon collapses in pain, clutching at her throat. At the exact moment of Victoria&#x27;s &quot;execution&quot; she once again changes places with Phyllis, who dies in her place. Due to Victoria&#x27;s very near-death experience, and as justice and revenge, a very angry Barnabas personally saw to it that Reverend Trask was sealed away in a very strong brick jail cell forever.

===Jeff Clark and Goodbye===
When Victoria returned to the present, a worried Barnabas believed that she may have learned his secret and bit her before she could tell anyone of her memories of 1795. He convinced her, under his spell, to elope with him, even though deep down Victoria still had feelings for Peter Bradford. On their way out of town, Victoria and Barnabas were involved in a car accident after seeing a man (Roger Davis) who resembled Peter. After the accident, the mysterious Dr. Eric Lang (Addison Powell) cured Barnabas of his vampirism, and Barnabas&#x27;s hold over Victoria&#x27;s mind was gone.

Now known as Jeff Clark, Peter worked for Lang and became involved with Victoria before learning his true identity. Peter/Jeff helped Lang build a Frankenstein-like creature, named Adam, who tried to kidnap Carolyn Stoddard and make her his monster bride. During this time, Roger&#x27;s new wife Cassandra (actually Angelique in disguise) created a Dream Curse that one person would pass on to another by telling them the dream. The dream would get worse for each person until finally Barnabas would be told. When Vicky had the dream, she did her best to keep it from Barnabas, but to stop her pain, Barnabas made her tell him. He then had the dream, woke up, and was bitten by a vampire bat, but survived.

After Dr. Lang was killed by a spell brought by Cassandra in an attempt to stop him from bringing Adam to life, Barnabas and his ally Dr. Julia Hoffman were forced to create a mate for Adam. That mate, Eve (Marie Wallace), had the life force of Peter&#x27;s evil lover from the 18th century. She made him realize his true identity and planned to reunite with him, but Adam strangled her. After finding out that he really was Peter Bradford, Jeff faded away into 1795. A despondent Victoria soon followed. Barnabas traveled back in time and rescued both Victoria and Peter from the machinations of the evil witch Angelique Bouchard before returning to the present. Victoria, however, remained behind in the year 1795 with Peter and was never seen again in the series.

Victoria was thought to have lived happily ever after, but in 1970, the ghost of Peter Bradford appeared and told antique store owner Phillip Todd that Victoria had been killed by the Leviathans, the same otherworldly creatures which were battling Barnabas Collins at that time. The ghost tried to convince Todd to destroy the Leviathan leader, Jeb Hawkes. Angelique found out about what was going on and told Peter Bradford to return to his grave, as she was going to take her own vengeance against Jeb and the Leviathans (which she did). Victoria&#x27;s inexplicable off-screen death came about when Dennis Patrick was unable to reprise the role of Paul Stoddard whose ghost would return to take revenge on Jeb. Another factor involved Alexandra Moltke&#x27;s decision not to return to the series when asked. Thus, Victoria was apparently killed off in a fit of pique. Most &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; fans tend to ignore this development as it makes little sense that Jeb existed at the same time Victoria and Jeff departed Collinsport.

Victoria&#x27;s position as governess went to Maggie Evans. Victoria was last mentioned in 1970 when the ghost of Gerard Stiles haunted Collinwood. Barnabas asked a possessed David to name the governess he had had before Maggie; David could not do so. David and Hallie Stokes then gave Daphne Harridge&#x27;s suddenly materialized ghost some of Victoria&#x27;s old clothes to wear.

==1991 revival==
In the NBC primetime revival of the series, Victoria Winters was played by Joanna Going. The first and only season consisted of a retelling of the early Barnabas and 1795 saga, with the main difference being that this time, Vicki, not Maggie, was the spitting-image of Josette. If the series had continued (as with the original), there were plans to reveal that Victoria was Elizabeth Collins Stoddard&#x27;s illegitimate daughter.

==Return to Collinwood==
In 2003 Dan Curtis Productions approved a full-cast audio drama. During the reading of Elizabeth Collins Stoddard&#x27;s will, the mystery surrounding Victoria Winters (which was never revealed in the TV series) is finally resolved. Carolyn learns that her mother had a child out of wedlock; Victoria is actually Carolyn&#x27;s older sister. In the late 1960s, Victoria was transported into the past and has not been seen since. In the will, Elizabeth implores Carolyn to find Victoria and bring her home.

==2004 pilot==
In the unaired WB pilot episode for a potential new series, Victoria Winters was played by Marley Shelton. For the first time, the character was depicted as a blonde. As with the 1991 series, Victoria was identical to Josette.

==2012 feature film==
In the Tim Burton-Johnny Depp big-screen adaptation of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, Victoria Winters is played by Bella Heathcote. As with the subsequent incarnations of the series, Vicky is the spitting-image of Josette. Also, the roles of Maggie Evans and Victoria Winters were combined for the film. When first meeting Vicki it is revealed that her real identity is Maggie Evans, but she changes it to Victoria Winters while on a train ride to Collinwood where, as in the original series, she has been employed as David&#x27;s governess. It is presumed that she changed her name because she didn&#x27;t want anyone to learn of her strange past to find her or send her back to the insane asylum.

Upon first meeting her, Barnabas instantly mistakes her for his lost Josette and instantly becomes smitten with her. He decides to become close to her and to try to make her fall in love with him. During the film it is shown that the ghost of Josette communicates with Victoria and is at a later point revealed that Victoria was Josette reincarnated.

By having Victoria being the reincarnation of Josette the film shows Victoria dealing with her past life regression issues until it finally becomes clear to her in the end. At the party scene when Barnabas and Victoria are outside Victoria unmasks to him about her childhood and they kiss. Angelique walks in and sees them and becomes furiously angry and jealous. A few scenes later, after saving David from a falling disco ball, Victoria sees what Barnabas truly is and becomes afraid and flees.

Late in the film Angelique places the same curse on Victoria as she had done to Josette, i.e. to jump off the cliff and kill herself. A little later at the cliff, Victoria is stopped just in time by Barnabas and she tells him to either make her into a vampire or she&#x27;ll jump. Barnabas refuses and she jumps, but he jumps after her and bites her. This turns her into a vampire before hitting the rocks and saves her from being killed. When Victoria reawakens, her modest new fangs show she now is also a vampire and she tells Barnabas to call her Josette. Barnabas concludes that his curse has ended as they kiss and the seawater hits them.

==Character development==
Dan Curtis first dreamed of a dark-haired girl riding a train to an estate, which was the inspiration for &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;. In &quot;Shadows on the Wall&quot;, the series&#x27; bible, Victoria was initially called Sheila March until the name was changed to suggest a more regal, older time. Her search for answers to her mysterious past, which was the driving force behind her accepting the governess position at Collinwood, would have originally led to the revelation that Victoria was the product of an affair between Paul Stoddard and an unknown woman. Elizabeth was to have discovered Victoria&#x27;s existence the night she thought she had killed Paul, and her guilt over his death prompted her to send money to the Foundling Home. However, these plans were eventually scrapped when the &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; production team decided that Victoria would be Elizabeth&#x27;s illegitimate daughter instead. This was due, in part, to Alexandra Moltke&#x27;s close resemblance to Joan Bennett. In 1987, Bennett recorded a special video for fans in which, in character as Elizabeth, revealed that Victoria was her daughter.

As the Adam/Eve storyline of 1968 began to wind down, Ron Sproat was in the stages of slanting the plot to reveal Victoria&#x27;s lineage when Moltke left the series due to her pregnancy. She was briefly replaced twice, but neither actress was (reportedly) accepted by the audience. Attempts were made to persuade Moltke to return, but, unhappy with her diminished role and content to be a stay-at-home mother to her new son, she declined. Any and all plans for the character were ultimately shelved, and Victoria was unceremoniously written out with an off-screen 18th-century death.

==Big Finish audio dramas==
Although Victoria herself has not yet appeared in any of the Big Finish audio plays to date, the character has been mentioned in passing. In &quot;House of Despair&quot;, Ed Griffin tells Quentin Collins that the people of Collinsport have not forgotten how &quot;that Winters girl&quot; inexplicably disappeared. In &quot;Curse of the Pharaoh&quot;, Carolyn recalls Victoria having once dated Frank Garner.

Victoria was heavily referenced throughout &quot;And Red All Over&quot;, which featured the return of Mitchell Ryan as Burke Devlin. In the audio play, Burke determines to do all he can to find Vicki and bring her home.

==Heiress of Collinwood==
Lara Parker&#x27;s 2016 &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; novel centers around the return of Victoria Winters from her time in the past to find Collinwood deserted. The story continues on from Parker&#x27;s previous book &quot;Wolf Moon Rising&quot;, and focuses on Vicki finally learning about her lineage.

==Music==

Robert Cobert composed &quot;Vicki&#x27;s Theme&quot; for the character and it was used primarily during the first year of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;. Cobert made a new arrangement of the song, which was retitled &quot;Missy&quot; and featured in &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot;. In 2011, the alternative rock group Cujo recorded &quot;Victoria Winters&quot;, a song about the character and referencing events from &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;.

<doc id="1287385" wikidata="Q184255" url="?curid=1287385" title="Million Dollar Baby">
<text>Million Dollar Baby is a 2004 American sports drama film. It is directed, co-produced, scored by and starring Clint Eastwood from a screenplay written by Paul Haggis, based on stories from the 2000 collection &quot;Rope Burns: Stories from the Corner&quot; by F.X. Toole, the pen name of fight manager and cutman Jerry Boyd. It also stars Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. The film follows Margaret &quot;Maggie&quot; Fitzgerald (Swank), an underdog amateur boxer who is helped by an underappreciated boxing trainer (Eastwood) to achieve her dream of becoming a professional.

&quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot; was theatrically released on December 15, 2004, by Warner Bros. Pictures. It received critical acclaim and grossed $216.8 million worldwide. The film garnered seven nominations at the 77th Academy Awards and won four: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress (for Swank), and Best Supporting Actor (for Freeman). It has since been cited as one of the best films of the 2000s, the 21st century and of all-time.

==Plot==
Margaret &quot;Maggie&quot; Fitzgerald, a waitress from the Ozarks, enters the Hit Pit, a rundown boxing gym in Los Angeles operated by Frankie Dunn. Frankie is a cantankerous Irish-American trainer estranged from his daughter. Maggie asks Frankie to train her, but he refuses because he does not want to train women and believes Maggie is too old. Eddie &quot;Scrap-Iron&quot; Dupris, Frankie&#x27;s friend and the gym&#x27;s handyman, allows her to train at the Hit Pit regardless. Frankie&#x27;s prize prospect, &quot;Big Willie&quot; Little, signs with rival manager Mickey Mack after becoming impatient with Frankie rejecting offers for a championship bout, so Maggie gets her chance.

With Frankie&#x27;s coaching, Maggie fights her way up in the women&#x27;s amateur boxing division. Since she has earned a reputation for quick knockouts, Frankie bribes managers to put their trainee fighters against her. Scrap, concerned when Frankie rejects several offers for big fights, arranges a meeting for Maggie with Mack, but out of loyalty to Frankie, she declines. Frankie bestows Maggie a Gaelic nickname embroidered on her boxing robe, &quot;Mo Cuishle&quot;, but does not tell her its meaning. The two travel to Europe as she continues to win. Maggie eventually saves enough of her winnings to buy her mother a house. Still, her mother berates Maggie for endangering her welfare checks, claiming everyone back home laughs at her.

Frankie is finally willing to arrange a title fight. He secures Maggie a $1 million match in Las Vegas against the WBA women&#x27;s welterweight champion, Billie &quot;The Blue Bear&quot; Osterman, a German ex-prostitute who has a reputation as a dirty fighter. Maggie begins to dominate the fight, but Billie knocks her out with an illegal sucker punch from behind after the bell rings to end the round. Maggie lands hard on her corner stool, breaking her neck and leaving her a ventilator-dependent quadriplegic.

Frankie goes through the five stages of grief, seeking multiple doctors&#x27; opinions in denial, lashing out in anger at Scrap, and trying to bargain with God through prayer. He later apologizes to Scrap and blames himself for Maggie&#x27;s injuries. Scrap tells him not to, as Maggie owes it to him for getting her shot at the world championship.

While in the hospital, Maggie looks forward to her family&#x27;s visit. They arrive late, having first toured Disneyland and Universal Studios Hollywood. Accompanied by an attorney, their sole concern is getting Maggie&#x27;s assets transferred to them. Disgusted, she orders them to leave and threatens to report their welfare fraud if they try to contact her again.

Maggie develops bedsores and undergoes an amputation for an infected leg. She asks Frankie to help her die, declaring that she has everything she wants out of life. A horrified Frankie refuses, so Maggie later bites her tongue in an attempt to bleed to death. Knowing the fatherly affection Frankie has developed for Maggie, Frankie&#x27;s priest warns him that he will never find himself again if he goes through with Maggie&#x27;s request. Frankie sneaks into the hospital one night, unaware that Scrap is watching from the shadows. Just before administering a fatal injection of adrenaline, he tells Maggie the meaning of &quot;mo cuishle&quot;: &quot;my darling, and my blood&quot;, then gives Maggie a final goodbye kiss. He leaves and retires from boxing altogether. Scrap writes to Frankie&#x27;s daughter, informing her of her father&#x27;s true character.

==Development and production==
After being fired from the television series &quot;Family Law&quot;, Paul Haggis wrote the script on spec, and it took four years to sell it. The film was stuck in development hell for years before it was shot. Several studios rejected the project even when Clint Eastwood signed on as actor and director. Even Warner Bros., Eastwood&#x27;s longtime home base, would not agree to a $30 million budget. Eastwood persuaded Lakeshore Entertainment&#x27;s Tom Rosenberg to put up half the budget (as well as handle foreign distribution), with Warner Bros. contributing the rest. Eastwood shot the film in less than 40 days between June and July 2004. Filming took place in Los Angeles and film sets at Warner Bros. Studios. The titular phrase &#x27;million dollar baby&#x27; was used as an insult during pre-fight publicity by Sonny Liston to Muhammad Ali, the latter of whom was an underdog at the time. Eastwood had his daughter Morgan Colette appear in a cameo as a girl who waves to Hilary Swank&#x27;s character at a gas station. 

Eastwood had confidence in Swank&#x27;s acting, but upon seeing Swank&#x27;s small physique, he had concerns, &quot;I just thought, &#x27;Yeah, this gal would be great. If we can get her trained up. If we can get a little bit more bulk on her, to make her look like a fighter&#x27;...She was like a feather. But what happened is, she had this great work ethic.&quot;

Consequently, to prepare for her role, Swank underwent extensive training in the ring and weight room, gaining 19 pounds of muscle, aided by professional trainer Grant L. Roberts. She trained for nearly five hours every day, winding up with a potentially life-threatening staphylococcus infection out of blisters on her foot. She did not tell Eastwood about the infection because she thought it would be out of character for Maggie.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot; initially had a limited release, opening in eight theaters in December 2004. In its later wide release opening, the film earned $12,265,482 in North America and quickly became a box-office hit both domestically and internationally. It grossed $216,763,646 in theaters; $100,492,203 in the United States, and $116,271,443 in other territories. The film played in theaters for six and a half months.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot; has an approval rating of 90% based on 269 reviews, with an average rating of 8.40/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Clint Eastwood&#x27;s assured direction—combined with knockout performances from Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman—help &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot; to transcend its clichés, and the result is deeply heartfelt and moving.&quot; On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 86 out of 100, based on reviews from 39 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four stars and stated that &quot;Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot; is a masterpiece, pure and simple,&quot; listing it as the best film of 2004. Michael Medved stated: &quot;My main objection to &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot; always centered on its misleading marketing, and effort by Warner Brothers to sell it as a movie about a female &quot;Rocky&quot;, with barely a hint of the pitch-dark substance that led Andrew Sarris of the &quot;New York Observer&quot;...to declare that &quot;no movie in my memory has depressed me more than &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot;.&quot;

In early 2005, the film sparked controversy when some disability rights activists protested the ending. The Disability Rights Education Fund released a statement about the film in February 2005 that included the following: &quot;Perhaps the most central stereotype fueling disability prejudice is the mistaken assumption inherent in the message of the movie that the quality of life of individuals with disabilities is unquestionably not worth living. This stereotype is contradicted by the personal experience of many thousands of people with significant disabilities in this country and around the world who view our own lives as ordinary and normal. It is further contradicted by plenty of hard data. Research overwhelmingly shows that people with disabilities find satisfaction in our lives to the same degree, or greater, than does the general public.&quot;

The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported that protests against the film by disability activists occurred in Chicago, Berkeley, and other cities, and that Clint Eastwood had lobbied for weakening provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Wesley J. Smith in &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; also criticized the film for its ending and for missed opportunities; Smith wrote &quot;The movie could have ended with Maggie triumphing once again, perhaps having obtained an education and becoming a teacher; or, opening a business managing boxers; or perhaps, receiving a standing ovation as an inspirational speaker.&quot;

Eastwood responded to the criticism by saying the film was about the American dream. In an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Eastwood distanced himself from the actions of characters in his films, noting, &quot;I&#x27;ve gone around in movies blowing people away with a .44 Magnum. But that doesn&#x27;t mean I think that&#x27;s a proper thing to do&quot;. Roger Ebert stated that &quot;a movie is not good or bad because of its content, but because of how it handles its content. &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot; is classical in the clean, clear, strong lines of its story and characters, and had an enormous emotional impact&quot;.

The Gaelic nickname for Swank&#x27;s character comes from the original phrase &quot;a chuisle mo chroí&quot;, meaning &quot;O pulse of my heart&quot;; one critic noted that the use of Gaelic in the film led to some interest in the language and the phrase.

<doc id="1287409" wikidata="Q4692327" url="?curid=1287409" title="Agha Shahid Ali">
<text>Agha Shahid Ali Qizilbash (4 February 1949 – 8 December 2001) was an Kashmiri-born American poet. Born into a Kashmiri Muslim family, Ali immigrated to the United States and became affiliated with the literary movement known as New Formalism in American poetry. His collections include &quot;A Walk Through the Yellow Pages&quot;, &quot;The Half-Inch Himalayas,&quot; &quot;A Nostalgist&#x27;s Map of America&quot;, &quot;The Country Without a Post Office&quot;, and &quot;Rooms Are Never Finished,&quot; the latter a finalist for the National Book Award in 2001.

The University of Utah Press awards the Agha Shahid Ali Poetry Prize annually in memory of this &quot;celebrated poet and beloved teacher.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Agha Shahid Ali was born on 4 February 1949, in New Delhi in the Union of India, into an illustrious Qizilbashi Agha family from Srinagar, Kashmir, tracing their roots back to Kandahar, Afghanistan. He grew up in Kashmir Valley, and left for the United States in 1976. Shahid&#x27;s father Agha Ashraf Ali was a renowned educationist. His grandmother Begum Zaffar Ali was the first woman matriculate of Kashmir. Shahid was educated at the Burn Hall School, later University of Kashmir and Hindu College, University of Delhi. He earned a PhD in English from Pennsylvania State University in 1984, and an M.F.A. from the University of Arizona in 1985. He held teaching positions at nine universities and colleges in India and the United States.

Shahid was born a Shia Muslim, but his upbringing was secular. Shahid and his brother Iqbal both studied at an Irish Catholic parochial school and, in an interview, he recalled that: &quot;There was never a hint of any kind of parochialism in the home.&quot;

==Literary work==
Ali expressed his love and concern for his people in &quot;In Memory of Begum Akhtar&quot; and &quot;The Country Without a Post Office,&quot; which was written with the Kashmir conflict as a backdrop. He was a translator of Urdu poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz (&quot;The Rebel&#x27;s Silhouette; Selected Poems&quot;), and editor for the Middle East and Central Asia segment of Jeffery Paine&#x27;s &quot;Poetry of Our World&quot;. He also compiled the volume &quot;Ravishing DisUnities: Real Ghazals in English.&quot; His last book was &quot;Call Me Ishmael Tonight&quot;, a collection of English ghazals, and his poems are featured in &quot;American Alphabets: 25 Contemporary Poets&quot; (2006) and other anthologies.

Ali taught at the MFA Program for Poets &amp; Writers at University of Massachusetts Amherst, at the MFA Writing Seminars at Bennington College as well as at creative writing programs at SUNY-Binghamton, University of Utah, Baruch College, Warren Wilson College, Hamilton College and New York University.

J&amp;K authorities have removed three poems – &quot;Postcard from Kashmir&quot;, &quot;In Arabic&quot; and &quot;The Last Saffron&quot; from the curriculum of University of Kashmir and two poems, &quot;I see Kashmir from New Delhi at Midnight&quot; and &quot;Call me Ishmael Tonight&quot; from the Cluster University. Education advisors in Delhi/Srinagar have maintained that such &quot;Resistance Literature&quot; sustains &quot;secessionist mindset, aspiration &amp; narrative&quot; among students.

== Personal life and death==
Ali never married and was gay. He died of brain cancer in December 2001 and was buried in Northampton, Massachusetts, in the vicinity of Amherst, a town sacred to his beloved poet Emily Dickinson.

== Bibliography ==
This list represents the published output of Ali, arranged in chronological order and sorted by the manner in which he contributed to the work in question.

==Influences==
Ali was deeply moved by the music of Begum Akhtar. The two had met through a friend of Akhtar&#x27;s when Ali was a teenager and her music became a lasting presence in his life. Features of her ghazal rendition—such as wit, wordplay and &quot;nakhra&quot; (affectation)—were present in Ali&#x27;s poetry as well. However, Amitav Ghosh suspects that the strongest connection between the two rose from the idea that &quot;sorrow has no finer mask than a studied lightness of manner&quot;—traces of which were seen in Ali&#x27;s and Akhtar&#x27;s demeanor in their respective lives.

== Awards ==

* Pushcart Prize
* Guggenheim Fellowship in 1996
*Bread Loaf Writers&#x27; Conference Fellowship
*Ingram-Merrill Foundation Fellowship

<doc id="1287414" wikidata="Q6472675" url="?curid=1287414" title="Lagrange Point (video game)">
<text>is a role-playing video game developed and published by Konami for the Family Computer. The game was released exclusively in Japan on April 26, 1991. The title of the game references Lagrangian points, the five positions in space where a body of negligible mass could be placed which would then maintain its position relative to two existing massive bodies.

&quot;Lagrange Point&quot; has the distinction of being one of only two games ever released with Konami&#x27;s Virtual ROM Controller VII (VRC7) sound generator integrated circuit, which allowed for a drastic improvement in the quality of the music and sound effects used in the game. The game was never localized for Western audiences, however, an unofficial English translation was released in 2014 by Aeon Genesis.

== Gameplay ==
== Plot ==
In the 22nd century, mankind has begun to emigrate into outer space. Three huge space colonies were constructed at a Lagrange point: the Isis Cluster; two artificial biospheres, named Land-1 and Land-2, and a satellite. In the year 0024 (55 years after the cluster was constructed), a biohazard outbreak occurred on Land 2. All attempts at contact were met with nothing but static. Now a research team led by their pilot, approaches Land-1.
Upon arrival, the team was attacked by a group of robots and the shuttle exploded due to the damage during the battle, knocking Gene out immediately after.

Gene then awakened in the medical centre of Isis City to find one of his team members fatally wounded. Said team member informs Gene that their goal was to find a researcher at Land-2&#x27;s Bio Research Lab, and Gene sets off to find him, wherever he is in Land-2.

<doc id="1287420" wikidata="Q877418" url="?curid=1287420" title="Six Memos for the Next Millennium">
<text>Six Memos for the Next Millennium () is a book based on a series of lectures written by Italo Calvino for the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures at Harvard, though Calvino died before delivering them. The lectures were written in Italian but were to be given in English in the fall of 1985. There have been two English translations, the first by Patrick Creagh, published in 1988, and the second by Geoffrey Brock, published in 2016.

The &quot;memos&quot; are lectures on certain literary qualities whose virtues Calvino wished to recommend to the then-approaching millennium. He intended to devote one lecture to each of six qualities: lightness, quickness, exactitude, visibility, multiplicity, and consistency. Though he completed the first five, he died before writing the last.

<text>mex (multiple exposure) is a windowing system created by Silicon Graphics, used on 68k-based IRIS systems and early IRIS 4D systems. Mex was originally loaded over a network through the utilization of GL1 routines kept on a remote host machine, usually a VAX. When the IRIS 1400 workstation and GL2-W (IRIX) were introduced, mex was allowed to run locally. Mex was used in IRIX from the GL2-W2.1.0 release to the 4D1-2.3 release.

With the introduction of 4D1-3.0 (IRIX 3.0), and the complete migration to MIPS processors, support for the GL / GL2 powered mex ended in the late 1980s, replaced by Sun Microsystems&#x27; NeWS and the 4Sight window manager.

<text>In agriculture, continuous harvest is the availability of a crop over an extended period during the growing season. Each crop has a harvest window during which it is ready for picking. Some are harvested by removing the whole plant, for example, cutting a head of lettuce. Others can be picked over varying periods: peas and corn may have a window of two weeks, cucumbers six or eight, tomatoes produce until the end of the season.

To provide a season-long continuous harvest of a crop with a shorter harvest window, succession planting techniques are used, including multiple plantings at different times, and planting of cultivars with different maturity dates. In this way, with effective timing, a new planting or variety of a crop is always coming into maturity as a previous one finishes.

<doc id="1287435" wikidata="Q1344963" url="?curid=1287435" title="World championship">
<text>A world championship is generally an international competition open to elite competitors from around the world, representing their nations, and winning such an event will be considered the highest or near highest achievement in the sport, game, or ability.

==How the championship title is assigned==

The title is usually awarded through a combination of specific contests or, less commonly, ranking systems (e.g. the ICC Test Championship), or a combination of the two (e.g. World Triathlon Championships in Triathlon). This determines a &#x27;world champion&#x27;, who or which is commonly considered the best nation, team, individual (or other entity) in the world in a particular field, although the vagaries of sport ensure that the competitor recognised at the best in an event is not always the &#x27;world champion&#x27; (see Underdog). This may also be known as a world cup competition, for example cycling (UCI World Championships and UCI World Cups). Often, the use of the term cup or championship in this sense is just a choice of words. Some sports have multiple champions because of multiple organizations, such as boxing, mixed martial arts and wrestling.

Certain competitive exercises do not have a world championship or a world cup as such, but may have one or several world champions. Professional boxing, for example, has several world champions at different weights, but each one of them is decided by a &quot;title match&quot;, not a tournament. In a title match system, the championship can only be won by directly defeating the incumbent, who in turn must continue to compete to retain their title or risk forfeiture.

Still other competitions, most commonly in professional sports, may or may not have a true world championship but may designate the winners of a domestic competition to be &quot;world champions&quot;. This is especially true of the &quot;Big Four&quot; major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada; world cups and championships exist in all four of the major sports, but the domestic U.S. and Canadian leagues are generally known as the world &quot;professional&quot; championships (due to the best players worldwide being in the league itself) (as with the Stanley Cup, ostensibly an independent championship for ice hockey but under the &quot;de facto&quot; control of the National Hockey League through two trustees who since no later than 1947 have been NHL loyalists) or the equivalent of a world &quot;club&quot; championship. In American football, although an IFAF World Championship exists, the United States is so far above and beyond the other nations it faces that the winner of the U.S.-based Super Bowl, a competition limited to the 32 teams in the National Football League, is commonly nicknamed as the world champion by the players, the press and fans alike; the NFL itself explicitly marketed the contest as a world championship in its first iterations. Winners of the Major League Baseball&#x27;s World Series are also commonly called world champions. Outside of the Big Four leagues, winners of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association, much like its men&#x27;s counterpart, commonly call themselves world champions, as with the winners of the National Lacrosse League and Drum Corps International.

On the other hand, association football (soccer) has more parity between national leagues and even continental tournaments has seen the birth of one true &quot;world championship&quot;. The first such tournament was the Football World Championship disputed from 1876 to 1904 between the winners of the FA Cup and Scottish Cup. After that, there have been many tournaments between teams from around the world, but it wasn&#x27;t until 1960 when the Intercontinental Cup was established, competed between the winners two greatest and most important continental championships: the UEFA Champions League from Europe and CONMEBOL Copa Libertadores from South America, the cup was endorsed by both UEFA and CONMEBOL but had no involvement from FIFA, the governing body for world football. As such, FIFA wanted to expand the tournament to include the champion from other continents - from the AFC Champions League (Asia and Australia), CAF Champions League (Africa), CONCACAF Champions League (North America and Caribbean) and OFC Champions League (Oceania) and created the FIFA Club World Cup. The first edition in 2000 ran concurrently with the 2000 Intercontinental Cup, and in 2004 the Intercontinental Cup was merged with the CCW, which has been ongoing since 2005 with yearly editions.

Finally, certain competitions do not have a world championship or world cup, but rather hold a series of events recognised as the elite level in their field (e.g. tennis and golf have a series of four Grand Slam events recognised as the pinnacle of the game, in addition to key team events, world tour finals and the Olympic Games, though each year ITF (International Tennis Federation) designates a World Champion based on performances throughout the year).

== History ==
There are some sports that already had a &#x27;world championship&#x27; in the 18th or 19th century, although it was variable how &#x27;world-wide&#x27; these competitions really were. The French player Clergé is considered to be the first international champion in real tennis, since 1740. In chess, international matches have been held for centuries, often resulting in certain players considered the best of all, with the first multiplayer tournament held in London in 1851, but Wilhelm Steinitz in 1886 was the first chess player generally recognized as the world chess champion.

Other sports with early &#x27;world championships&#x27; were English draughts (1840) and speed skating.

<text>John Karlen (born John Adam Karlewicz; May 28, 1933 – January 22, 2020) was an American character actor who played multiple roles on the ABC serial &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; on and off from 1967 to 1971.

In 1971, Karlen starred as the male lead in &quot;Daughters of Darkness&quot;. He played Harvey Lacey, husband of Mary Beth Lacey (played by Tyne Daly), on the CBS crime series &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; (1982–88). Karlen reprised the role of &quot;Willie Loomis&quot; for a series of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; audio dramas produced by Big Finish Productions.

==Life and career==
Karlen was born May 28, 1933, in Brooklyn, the son of Helen Agnes (née Balondowicz) and Adam Marion Karlewicz. He was of Polish descent. Karlen served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War.

He enrolled in the American Academy of Dramatic Arts on a scholarship. His first acting experiences were on early television productions such as &quot;From These Roots&quot; and &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot;. His stage career began in 1959 in &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot;.

He accumulated roles on both stage and television before winning one of his signature roles in 1967 in the daytime serial &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;. It was Karlen&#x27;s pivotal character of Willie Loomis who released vampire Barnabas Collins from his coffin, setting off the events of the series. Karlen would stay with the television series for 182 episodes, playing various characters through 1971. In addition to Willie, he played Carl Collins, a parallel-universe William H. Loomis, Desmond Collins and Kendrick Young. In the 1971 film &quot;Night of Dark Shadows&quot;, he played Alex Jenkins along with other cast members from the &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; TV show.

While not appearing on &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; in the late sixties, he appeared on &quot;Love Is a Many Splendored Thing&quot; as Jock Porter and &quot;Hidden Faces&quot; as Sharkey Primrose. He reunited with his &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; co-stars for the 1970 &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot; as Willie Loomis, and, in 1971, with &quot;Night of Dark Shadows&quot; as Alex Jenkins.

Karlen moved to a series of guest appearances on television productions, establishing himself in 1982 as Harvey Lacey, husband of Tyne Daly&#x27;s character Mary Beth Lacey on &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot;. He appeared in 110 episodes over six years. Karlen won an Emmy Award for his portrayal of Harvey Lacey in 1986; he received 2 further nominations, in 1985 and 1987.

His career included numerous movie roles, during which he reprised the &quot;Harvey Lacey&quot; character in four Cagney and Lacey television movies: &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey: The Return&quot; in 1994, &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey: Together Again&quot; and &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey: The View Through the Glass Ceiling&quot; in 1995, and &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey: True Convictions&quot; in 1996.

==Personal life and death==
In 1963, Karlen married acting teacher Betty Karlen but divorced in 1998.

Karlen died from heart failure in Burbank, California on January 22, 2020, at age 86.

<text>Koryazhma () is a town in the southeast of Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia, located on the left bank of the Vychegda River east of Kotlas, at the confluence of the Bolshaya Koryazhemka River. Population: 

==History==
In 1535, the Koryazhemsky Nikolaevsky Monastery was founded in the mouth of the Bolshaya Koryazhemka (hence the name). After the 1917 October Revolution the monastery was abolished, and the territories which previously belonged to the monastery were used for agriculture. In 1953, the construction of a big paper mill started, and in 1954 first brickstone houses were built. In 1957, the settlement around the paper mill was officially designated as the urban-type settlement of Koryazhma. The paper mill started operation in 1961. In 1975, the population of Koryazhma was 42 thousand. August 15, 1985, Koryazhma obtained the town rights and became the town of oblast significance.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the town of oblast significance of Koryazhma—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the town of oblast significance of Koryazhma is incorporated as Koryazhma Urban Okrug.

Even though Koryazhma is not a part of Kotlassky District (by which it is geographically surrounded), it serves as the administrative center of Koryazhemsky Selsoviet, one of the twelve selsoviets into which that district is divided.

==Economy==

===Industry===
Koryazhma is home of the Koryazhma Branch of the Ilim Group company, the largest chemical pulp and paper mills in Europe (previously Kotlas Pulp and Paper Mill).

===Transportation===
The Vychegda in Koryazhma is navigable, and in summer there is regular passenger navigation connecting Kotlas and Soyga (located approximately halfway between Koryazhma and Yarensk).

There is a railway station (Nizovka) on the line connecting Kotlas and Vorkuta.

Koryazhma is located on the road connecting Kotlas and Syktyvkar (via Shiroky Priluk). This portion of the road is paved. There is regular passenger bus traffic from Koryazhma to Kotlas, Veliky Ustyug, and Syktyvkar.

==Culture and recreation==
The only collection of historical buildings in Koryazhma is in the Koryazhemsky Nikolaevsky Monastery. The Church of the Holy Mandylion originates from 1746 and is one of the oldest stone churches in Arkhangelsk Oblast, and the Church of Saint Longin of Koryazhma, consecrated to the founder of the monastery, was built between 1907 and 1912. There is also the House of the Hegumen which forms a single ensemble with the Church of Saint Longin of Koryazhma. All these buildings are protected as cultural heritage of local importance. The Annunciation Cathedral, the oldest stone building of the monastery (1665), and the bell-tower, were demolished in 1933.

===Sports===
The local association football team is FC Khimik Koryazhma.

There is also a bandy team, Vychegda.

Yuen Woo-ping (; alias: Yuen Wo-ping; born 1945) is a Hong Kong martial arts choreographer and film director who worked in Hong Kong action cinema and later Hollywood films. He is one of the inductees on the Avenue of Stars in Hong Kong. Yuen is also a son of Yuen Siu-tien, a martial arts film actor. He attended the China Drama Academy for one year as a day student of Master Yu Jim-yuen as well.

==Life and career==
Yuen was born in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. With a support of Ng See-yuen, he achieved his first directing credit in 1978 on the seminal &quot;Snake in the Eagle&#x27;s Shadow&quot;, starring Jackie Chan, followed quickly by &quot;Drunken Master&quot;. The films were smash hits, launching Jackie Chan as a major film star, turning Seasonal Films into a major independent production company, and starting a trend towards comedy in martial arts films that continues to the following two decades.

Yuen went on to helm other star vehicles for such figures as Sammo Hung in &quot;Magnificent Butcher&quot; (1979), Yuen Biao in &quot;Dreadnaught&quot; (1981), Donnie Yen in &quot;Iron Monkey&quot; (1993), Jet Li in &quot;Tai Chi Master&quot; (1993), and Michelle Yeoh in &quot;Wing Chun&quot; (1994).

Yuen&#x27;s works, particularly his action choreography on &quot;Fist of Legend&quot; (1994), attracted the attention of the Wachowskis, who hired him as the martial arts choreographer on &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999). The success of this collaboration, plus his action choreography on the following year&#x27;s hit &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;, made him a highly sought after figure in Hollywood. He went on to work on the first two &quot;Matrix&quot; sequels, as well as &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1&quot; (2003) and &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 2&quot; (2004).

More recent action choreography duties in Hong Kong cinema have included &quot;Kung Fu Hustle&quot; (2004), starring Stephen Chow, and &quot;Fearless&quot; (2006), starring Jet Li.

Yuen also choreographed the action sequences in &quot;The Forbidden Kingdom&quot; (2008), a Hollywood martial arts–adventure film, which was the first film to star together two of the best-known names in the martial arts film genre, Jackie Chan and Jet Li. He worked as a fight choreography consultant on &quot;Ninja Assassin&quot; (2009).

In late 2010, Yuen released his first film as director since 1996, &quot;True Legend&quot;, starring Vincent Zhao, Jay Chou and David Carradine (in a minor role).

Yuen went on to work as stunt co-ordinator in two South Indian films, &quot;Enthiran&quot; (2010) and &quot;I&quot; (2014), both directed by S. Shankar.

In 2015, Yuen directed &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny&quot;, re-creating many of his signature action choreographies.

The annual and highly anticipated Hong Kong International Film Festival was held for its 45th edition in April 2021. Yuen is one of the six veteran Hong Kong filmmakers who contributed segments to the Johnnie To-produced anthology film &quot;&quot;. The other filmmakers who directed segments are Sammo Hung, Ann Hui On-wah, Patrick Tam, Tsui Hark and Ringo Lam. The short files were shot entirely on 35mm film with each of them touches on a nostalgic and moving story set across different time periods, with every one acting as an ode to the city.

<doc id="1287449" wikidata="Q6488571" url="?curid=1287449" title="Lara Parker">
<text>Mary Lamar Rickey (October 27, 1938 – October 12, 2023), better known as Lara Parker, was an American actress known for her role as Angelique on the ABC-TV serial &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, which aired from 1966 to 1971.

==Early life==
Parker was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, on October 27, 1938, and grew up in Memphis. Descendant of a prominent Southern family, she was a great-great-granddaughter of Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar II and a third-great-granddaughter of Augustus Baldwin Longstreet, an uncle of Confederate General James Longstreet. She began a philosophy A.B. at Vassar College before receiving her Bachelor of Arts degree from Rhodes College (then known as Southwestern Presbyterian) and a Master of Arts degree in speech and drama from the University of Iowa.

==Career==
Parker played the role of &quot;Laura Banner&quot; in the opening sequence of the pilot for the television series &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (1977), and the fashion model-witch &quot;Madelaine&quot; in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;The Trevi Collection&quot;. Her other television work includes appearances on &quot;Emergency&quot; &quot;One of Those Days&quot;(1975-S5Ep8), &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; (1976-S3Ep17: &quot;The Secret of Bigfoot Part 1&quot;), &quot;Police Woman&quot;, &quot;Kojak&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot;, &quot;Switch&quot;, &quot;Baretta&quot;, &quot;Galactica 1980&quot; (&quot;The Night The Cylons Landed&quot;, Parts I &amp; II), Barnaby Jones (1980-The Price of Anger), the CBS daytime serial &quot;Capitol&quot;, and the ABC daytime serial &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. She played secretary Wanda in the 1977 television miniseries &quot;&quot; and had a recurring role in the short-lived television series &quot;Jessica Novak&quot;.

Parker reprised the role of Angelique in &quot;Night of Dark Shadows&quot;, the second feature film based on &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;. She was joined by her &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; castmates Kate Jackson, David Selby, Grayson Hall, Nancy Barrett, John Karlen, and Thayer David. This film was more loosely based on the series than &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot; was, and it did not fare as well at the box office as the first film. She appeared opposite Robert De Niro in the 1970 Brian De Palma film &quot;Hi, Mom!&quot;, but her best known film role came in the Oscar-winning drama &quot;Save the Tiger&quot; (1973), starring Jack Lemmon, in which she played a sympathetic prostitute who is devastated when her client suffers a near fatal heart attack. In 1975, she played the wife of Peter Fonda&#x27;s character in &quot;Race with the Devil&quot;.

==Later work==
Parker made her Broadway debut in 1968 in &quot;Woman is My Idea&quot;, written and directed by Don C. Liljenquist. In 1969, she played the title role in an Off-Broadway production of Frank Wedekind&#x27;s &quot;Lulu&quot;. She also appeared in the off-Broadway production of &quot;A Gun Play&quot;.

In 1998, Parker published a novel, &quot;Angelique&#x27;s Descent&quot;. Its sequel, &quot;Dark Shadows: The Salem Branch&quot;, came out in July 2006, and &quot;Dark Shadows: Wolf Moon Rising&quot; was released in August 2013. Her fourth and final novel, &quot;Heiress of Collinwood&quot; was released in November 2016. She has recently reprised the role of Angelique for a new series of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; audio dramas. She was also the reader of the unabridged audiobook recordings of her first three novels: &quot;Angelique&#x27;s Descent&quot;, &quot;Dark Shadows: The Salem Branch&quot; and &quot;Dark Shadows: Wolf Moon Rising.&quot;. In 2012, she had a cameo role in Tim Burton&#x27;s movie version of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;. Later she was reunited with her &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; co-stars Jerry Lacy and Kathryn Leigh Scott in two feature films about &quot;Doctor Mabuse&quot; written and directed by Ansel Faraj. The 1st film &quot;Doctor Mabuse&quot; was released in 2013, followed by a 2014 sequel called &quot;Doctor Mabuse: Etiopomar&quot;. Her final film, &quot;The Great Nick D&quot; (shot in 2023), is co-written and co-directed by Ansel Faraj and Nathan Wilson and co-stars her &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; co-stars Kathryn Leigh Scott and David Selby.

==Education and post-acting career==
Lara attended Central High School in Memphis and won a scholarship to Vassar College. At Vassar, she began a major in philosophy, which she completed at Southwestern at Memphis (now Rhodes College), receiving her BA. She attended graduate school at the University of Iowa and completed all course work on a Masters in speech and drama. She was working on her thesis while beginning her acting career. After retiring from acting, Lara became a high school and English teacher and obtained her MFA in creative writing from Antioch University.

==Personal life and death==
Parker was married to Jim Hawkins, a building contractor. They had a daughter, Caitlin. Parker had two sons, Rick and Andy, both from her first marriage to artist Tom Parker: Rick was a successful record producer, Andy a contractor. Caitlin Hawkins is a set designer and stylist for videos and commercials.
Lara&#x27;s son Rick is married to singer Miranda Lee Richards.

On October 12, 2023, following a battle with cancer, Parker died in her sleep in Los Angeles at the age of 84.

<doc id="1287450" wikidata="Q6942004" url="?curid=1287450" title="Music of Arkansas">
<text>Arkansas is a Southern state of the United States. Arkansas&#x27;s musical heritage includes country music and various related styles like bluegrass and rockabilly.

==State songs==
Arkansas has four official state songs:

*State Anthem: &quot;Arkansas&quot; by Mrs. Eva Ware Barnett
*State Historical Song: &quot;The Arkansas Traveler&quot; by Colonel Sanford C. Faulkner
*State Song: &quot;Oh, Arkansas&quot; by Terry Rose and Gary Klaff
*State Song: &quot;Arkansas (You Run Deep In Me)&quot; by Wayland Holyfield

Two of the official state songs are because of a copyright dispute. &quot;Arkansas&quot; was published in 1916 by the Central Music Company, written by Eva Ware Barnett and Will M. Ramsey (though state law only credits Mrs. Barnett). It became the official song on January 12, 1917. Until either 1945 or 1949, &quot;Arkansas&quot; was the only official song in Arkansas. At that time, there was a copyright dispute and the state adopted &quot;The Arkansas Traveler&quot; as the official song, a situation that remained unchanged until 1963. In that year, the copyright dispute was resolved and &quot;Arkansas&quot; became official again, until 1987, when it was changed to the official state anthem. In that year, &quot;Arkansas (You Run Deep In Me)&quot; and &quot;Oh, Arkansas&quot; were officially designated state songs as well, and &quot;The Arkansas Traveler&quot; was designated the official state historical song.

==Arkansas politicians and music==
Two Arkansas politicians have been noted for mixing music with their campaigns for the presidency. Bill Clinton, attorney general and 50th and 52nd governor of the state and later president, played the saxophone, famously performing &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; during the 1992 presidential election. Mike Huckabee, 54th governor, plays the bass guitar, and his campaign in the 2008 presidential election has prominently featured cover song performances by his band Capitol Offense.

==Genres==

===Indigenous music===
===Classical===
Composer Florence Price was born in Little Rock in 1887.

The Arkansas Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1966. When the orchestra was founded, a local bank held the organization responsible for the debts of previous attempts at organizing an orchestra. Ten individual members assumed responsibility for the debt, and so the orchestra was formed, led by experienced conductor Vasilios Priakos. Today the Orchestra is conducted by Geoff Robson. They have an extensive outreach and education program. In February 2012, George Takei performed with the group in a Holocaust memorial.

===Country, bluegrass, and folk music===
Traditional folk instruments include the fiddle and banjo as well as guitar, mandolin, dulcimer and autoharp.

Located in the Ozark Mountains, the town of Mountain View bills itself as the &quot;Folk Music Capital of the World&quot;. There is an Arkansas Entertainers Hall of Fame, which includes musicians like Ronnie Dunn, Melvin Endsley, and Al Green.

Jimmy Driftwood and Beau Renfro.

Indie Folk group Little Chief is made up of former University of Arkansas student Matt Cooper and is based out of Fayetteville.

===Gospel===
Gospel music is very popular in Arkansas. Because of the racial tension extant since slavery in the Delta region, gospel music has had a tremendous influence in the lives of African Americans in Arkansas. While Blues is dominated by men, it is the women of Arkansas who have led the way in gospel music. Gospel composer, singer, pianist, arranger Roberta Martin was born in Helena. The Brockwell Gospel Music School in Brockwell, Arkansas in Izard County, has been offering a two-week summer course in Gospel music since 1947.

===Blues and R&amp;B===
Country blues singer and slide guitarist Casey Bill Weldon was born in Pine Bluff. Blues pianist Roosevelt Sykes was born in Elmar. Jump blues singer Jimmy Witherspoon was born in Gurdon. Electric blues and Chicago blues artist Willie &quot;Big Eyes&quot; Smith was born in Helena. Guitarist, singer, and songwriter Pat Hare, born in Cherry Valley, served as a sideman at Sun Records in Memphis. Billy Lee Riley, born in Pocahontas, and Sonny Burgess, born near Newport, also recorded for Sun.

West Memphis, just across the Mississippi river from Memphis, Tennessee, has its own thriving music scene. When Beale Street would shut down for the night, performers like B. B. King, Ike Turner, Junior Parker, and Elmore James came to 8th street in West Memphis. Wayne Jackson even said once that &quot;the Memphis sound was born over the river&quot;. Jackson was born and raised in West Memphis as was Chicago blues artist Junior Wells. The West Memphis R&amp;B scene was an integral part of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.

===Jazz===
Jazz artists born in Arkansas include pianist and bandleader Alphonse Trent from Fort Smith, trombonist Snub Mosley born in Little Rock, pianist and composer Walter Norris born in Little Rock, Joe Bishop born in Monticello, saxophonist Pharoah Sanders born in Little Rock, free jazz tenor saxophonist Kalaparusha Maurice McIntyre born in Clarksville, tenor saxophonist Red Holloway born in Helena, tenor saxophonist and bandleader Hayes Pillars born in North Little Rock, Oliver Lake born in Marianna, pianist Bob Dorough born in Cherry Hill, bassist James Leary born in Little Rock, pianist Art Porter, Sr. and saxophonist Art Porter, Jr. born in Little Rock, and Amina Claudine Myers born in Blackwell.

===Rock===
Sister Rosetta Tharpe from Cotton Plant was a gospel artist who achieved crossover success and became a rock and roll pioneer, influencing among many others fellow Arkansas native Johnny Cash from Kingsland. Sonny Burgess was another Arkansan who influenced the rock and roll industry as an artist for Sun Records in adjacent Memphis, Tennessee. Arkansas early rock and roll was typically rockabilly music influenced by Zydeco music and blues.

Arkansas garage rock and psychedelic music of the 1960s has been reexamined by Psych of the South with &quot;Lost Souls&quot;.

===Independent and local===
While Arkansas is known for its southern styles of music, there is a much younger style coming from the state as well. In the late 1990s, and early 2000s, there were many rock music groups, as well as pop rock groups. One of the best-known bands from this time would be multi-platinum-selling rock band Evanescence, which has origins in Little Rock.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Little Rock became the home of a thriving punk and metal music scene. The 1990s DIY scene was captured in the 2007 film &quot;Towncraft&quot;. As the trends have changed, post-hardcore and metalcore bands such as Norma Jean gained popularity. Doom Metal is represented by Pallbearer from Little Rock, while Rwake is known for southern sludge metal. American Princes from Little Rock show the indie rock side of Arkansas.

Young Freq is a rapper from Little Rock working with local independent label Roc Town Music Group, formed in 2013.

Tommy Riggs (Tom Payton) is an Arkansan singer, piano and keyboard player who had several bands while performing around the state in the 1960s and 1970s. He also was working as a radio DJ (as Tom Jones) at the time, on KCLA, during 1968 through 69 and as Tom Payton on KXLR in North Little Rock in 1964, and in 1966 at KAAY. During this period, he promoted himself as Tom Payton and the Kingpins, Tom Payton with The Playboys, and several other names. He recorded while he was Rock Robbins from KAAY on the Little Rock label MY Records in 1966. Two songs from the session were released on a 45 rpm record, &quot;My Little Girl&quot; and &quot;Good Lovin&#x27;&quot;.

Arkansas&#x27;s rock and roll scene is served by a free monthly magazine launched by Peter Read on December 8, 1980, called &quot;Night Flying&quot;.

<text>Interstate 180 (I-180) is a expressway in the US state of Wyoming between I-80 and downtown Cheyenne. 

It is unusual for being one of the few Interstate Highways that does not conform to Interstate Highway standards. There is also no control of access anywhere along its route. Other routes in Alaska and Puerto Rico are similar in nature, as they are funded by Interstate dollars but do not conform to Interstate Highway standards. The only grade separations are a diamond interchange at its southern end (at a junction with I-80) and a pair of bridges that run over 1st Street and the Union Pacific Railroad tracks. However, even the interchange with I-80 is a standard diamond with signalized intersections. There are five traffic signals along I-180. 

I-180 is cosigned with I-25 Business Loop (I-25 BL), US Highway 85 (US 85), and US 87 Business (US 87 Bus.), making it the only concurrency of an Interstate, Interstate business route, US Highway, and US Highway business route. It is also the only auxiliary Interstate Highway in Wyoming.

==Route description==

I-180 begins at a diamond interchange with I-80 in Cheyenne, heading north concurrently with I-25 BL/US 85/US 87 Bus. on the four-lane divided North Greeley Highway. South of this interchange, I-25 BL/US 85/US 87 Bus. continues along North Greeley Highway. From the southern terminus, I-180 passes over Deming Drive and passes local homes and businesses. The road curves northwesterly and intersects 5th Street at a traffic light. The highway passes under a pedestrian bridge at 7th Street before crossing 9th Street at a signalized intersection. Past 9th Street, the directions of I-180 split and pass over a large Union Pacific Railroad yard. After this bridge, I-180 reaches its northern terminus at an at-grade signalized intersection with I-80 BL/US 30. Past this intersection, I-25 BL/US 85/US 87 Bus. continues north on the one-way pairing of Warren Avenue northbound and Central Avenue southbound.

==History==

I-180 was conceived in November 1967, when Wyoming requested it for a new spur route into Cheyenne. The American Association of State Highway Officials added it to the Interstate Highway System in June 1970. The original plan was to have a freeway along the same corridor, with a full freeway-to-freeway interchange at I-80, but the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) rejected it in December 1970 due to high cost and access issues. Wyoming revised the proposal to the current configuration in February 1971, and it was approved by the FHWA that March. I-180 opened in June 1984, after six years of expressway upgrades.
