<text>&quot;Extract from Captain Stormfield&#x27;s Visit to Heaven&quot; is a short story written by American writer Mark Twain. It first appeared in print in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in December 1907 and January 1908, and was published in book form with some revisions in 1909. This was the last story published by Twain during his life.

==Description and plot outline==
The story follows Captain Elias Stormfield on his decades long cosmic journey to Heaven; his accidental misplacement after racing a comet; his short-lived interest in singing and playing the harp (generated by his preconceptions of heaven); and the general obsession of souls with the celebrities of Heaven such as Adam, Moses, and Elijah, who according to Twain become as distant to most people in Heaven as living celebrities are on Earth. Twain uses this story to show his view that the common conception of Heaven is ludicrous, and points out the incongruities of such beliefs with his characteristic adroit usage of hyperbole.

Much of the story&#x27;s description is given by the character Sandy McWilliams, a cranberry farmer who is very experienced in the ways of Heaven. Sandy gives Stormfield, a newcomer, the description in the form of a conversational question-and-answer session. The Heaven described by him is similar to the conventional Christian Heaven, but includes a larger version of all the locations on Earth, as well as of everywhere in the universe (which mention of, albeit as a backdrop, is the last science fiction element). All sentient life-forms travel to Heaven, often through interplanetary or interstellar space, and land at a particular gate (which are without number), which is reserved for people from that originating planet. Each newcomer must then give his name and planet of origin to a gatekeeper, who sends him in to Heaven. Once inside, the being spends eternity living as they think fit, usually according to its true (sometimes undiscovered) talent. According to one of the characters, a cobbler who &quot;has the soul of a poet in him won&#x27;t have to make shoes here,&quot; implying that he would instead turn to poetry and achieve perfection in it. On special occasions a procession of the greatest people in history is formed; on this particular occasion this includes Buddha, William Shakespeare, Homer, Muhammed, Daniel, Ezekiel, and Jeremiah plus several otherwise unknown people whose talents far exceeded those of the world&#x27;s pivotal figures, but who were never famous on Earth. 

As Stormfield proceeds through Heaven he learns that the conventional image of angels as winged, white-robed figures bearing haloes, harps, and palm leaves is a mere illusion generated for the benefit of humans, who mistake &quot;figurative language&quot; for accurate description (the wings are part of their uniforms, and not functionally wings); that all of Heaven&#x27;s denizens choose their ages, thus aligning themselves with the time of life at which they were most content; that anything desired is awarded to its seeker, if it does not violate any prohibition; that the prohibitions themselves are different from those envisioned on Earth; that each of the Earth-like regions of Heaven includes every human being who has ever lived on it; that families are not always together forever, because of decisions made by those who have died first; that white-skinned people are a minority in Heaven; that kings are not kings in Heaven (Charles II is a comedian while Henry VI has a religious book-stand), etc.

==Background==

Although not published until 1907 in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, followed by a slim book version with some revisions in 1909, the story was quite old. The original manuscript dated back perhaps as far as 1868, and an 1873 version has survived. The story was revised several times, and chapters 3 and 4 of the manuscript became the &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; story. Longer versions of the manuscript have subsequently been published, including one edited by Dixon Wector which appeared as part of &quot;Report from Paradise&quot; (1952), and in part 1 of &quot;Mark Twain&#x27;s Quarrel with Heaven: &quot;Captain Stormfield&#x27;s Visit to Heaven&quot; And Other Sketches&quot;&quot; (Ray B. Browne, ed., 1970). Twain claimed that the story in its early version was a satire of Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward&#x27;s &quot;The Gates Ajar&quot;, a very popular novel published in 1868.
==Cultural references==
The story mentions several public figures who were widely known at the time of first publication, but are not as well known today. These include Moody and Sankey, Charles Peace, Thomas De Witt Talmage and Prince Gortschakoff.

== Adaptations ==
=== Film versions ===
In the 1985 claymation movie &quot;The Adventures of Mark Twain&quot;, &quot;Extract from Captain Stormfield&#x27;s Visit to Heaven&quot; is one of the many adapted works, however the plot of the adaptation is very different to the original story. In it we are introduced to Stormfield as he is contacted by Mark Twain. While Stormfield is chasing &#x27;his own comet&#x27; Twain asks him where he is going to which Stormfield says he&#x27;s going to heaven. He then lands head-first into a cloud with a door marked &#x27;heaven&#x27; (which is more akin to the entrance of a Nightclub), and he is greeted by a blue, 3-headed, slug-like creature who asks him where he is from. When Stormfield says he is from San Francisco he is made fun of by the creature who mocks him for not understanding he meant what planet he was from. After some more misunderstandings the creature lets Stormfield into heaven but before he goes in he asks where his wreath, halo, hymnbook and palm branch are (all objects featured in stereotypical heaven descriptions) to which the creature tells him &quot;Oh, trust me, you won&#x27;t be conspicuous in this district without it&quot;. When he actually enters &#x27;heaven&#x27; he is shocked and appalled to find out that everyone else is also one of the slug creatures and they partake in irreligious, immoral and degenerate acts such as drinking, smoking, raving etc. Stormfield leaves and comes to the realization that &quot;A man has got to be in his own heaven to be happy&quot;. The slug creature agrees and tells him &quot;Did you imagine that the same heaven would suit all sorts of people?&quot;. Stormfield then jumps to another cloud where he is met by Saint Peter in front of the stereotypical Pearly Gates who gives him all the items Stormfield expected. When Stormfield tries to talk he is constantly shushed by both Peter and the gates themselves. The segment ends with Twain saying &quot;A harp, a hymnbook and wings? Good God, what a swindle. I&#x27;m led to consider a different path. Heaven for climate, hell for company.&quot;

<text>Otilio Warrington, known popularly as Bizcocho (born February 26, 1949) is a comedian, best known for his roles of &quot;Bizcocho&quot; and &quot;Cuca Gómez&quot;.

==Early years==
Warrington was born in the Barrio Obrero area of Santurce, Puerto Rico. When he was nine years old, his family moved to the Lloréns Torres public housing project. There he lived for the next 25 years. Warrington left school when he was a teenager and made a living by polishing shoes at a local barbershop. One of the barbershop&#x27;s regular customers was Tommy Muñiz, a television show producer. One day Warrington asked Muñiz for a job in television but was told to get some more education and come back to him after he graduated.

==Bizcocho==
Encouraged by Mr. Muñiz&#x27;s challenge, Warrington returned to school and graduated from Central High School of Santurce in mid-late 1960s; he then went back to Mr. Muñiz to take him up on his earlier offer. Tommy Muñiz kept his word and let Otilio assist in the TV show &quot;El Special de Corona&quot; (The Corona Special). Thus, Warrington became the &quot;first&quot; black Puerto Rican male comedian to be regularly featured on a local TV program. One of the show&#x27;s sections involved a group of &quot;wacky&quot; soldiers and included José Miguel Agrelot and Jacobo Morales. When Otilio joined the group, Morales baptized him as &quot;Soldier Bizcocho&quot; (Cake), a nickname that would remain with him for the rest of his life.

Muñiz saw potential in Otilio and paid for his college education; as a result Warrington attended the University of Puerto Rico graduating with an associate degree in Television Direction and Production. After graduation Otilio participated in many local TV programs such as: &quot;&quot;Ja ja ji ji jo jo con Agrelot&quot; and &quot;El Show del Mediodía&quot;&quot; (The Noon Show).

Warrington joined ASTRA productions in the 1970s and after working for different shows landed a spot in &quot; Cogiendo Impulso&quot;, which was transmitted on Channel 11; it was here that he developed the characters of &quot;Juancito&quot; and &quot;Pito&quot;. In (1979) he participated in the movie production of Jacobo Morales&#x27; &quot;Díos los Cría&quot; (And God raised them) alongside Norma Candal, Gladys Rodríguez, Esther Sandoval and Alicia Moreda.

==Cuca Gómez==
Later, in the early 1980&#x27;s, while working in the comedy &quot;Los Kakukomicos&quot;, Warrington developed the character of &quot;Cuca Gómez&quot;, a cross-dressing role that would help settle Warrington&#x27;s fame as a comedian. The plot involved a female cosmetologist who was involved in all kinds of hilarious and off-the-wall situations. &quot;Cuca Gómez&quot; became very popular in Puerto Rico and soon appeared in other TV shows as a special guest star. In 1985, Warrington was named &quot;Mr. Television&quot; by the Artistic Association of Puerto Rico.

==Music==
In 1986, Pijuán, a Puerto Rican musician, in conjunction with Bizcocho created an album called Bizcocho &amp; Pijuán &quot;El premio &#x27;Gordo&#x27; del Sabor&quot;, under Private Ranch Records.

==Later years==
In the 1990s, Warrington starred in his own TV show, &quot;Mi Familia&quot; (&quot;My Family&quot;), where he acted as &quot;Arcadio&quot;. He also worked in &quot;El Show de las 12&quot; (&quot;The 12 o&#x27;clock Show&quot;) acting as &quot;Don Ambrosio&quot; and &quot;Yeyito&quot;.

==Other shows==
Among the shows which Warrington has hosted are &quot;Friendo y Comiendo&quot; alongside Luis Antonio Cosme, &quot;Café con Leche&quot; alongside Lily García and Yan Ruíz and a television program transmitted through WAPA-TV called &quot;La Cocina Caliente de Luis y Bizcocho&quot; (&quot;Luis and Bizcocho&#x27;s Hot Kitchen&quot;), alongside Luisito Vigoreaux; &quot;Hola Gente&quot; alongside Alexandra Fuentes and Gerardo Ortiz; and together with Lily and Yan a morning show called &quot;¡Buenos Días!&quot; (Good Morning!)

==Health problems==
Warrington had gallbladder surgery during 2017, after it was discovered, during a visit to an emergency room, that he had stones inside that organ.

<doc id="1280566" wikidata="Q3576767" url="?curid=1280566" title="Roughing It">
<text>Roughing It is a book of semi-autobiographical travel literature by Mark Twain. It was written in 1870–71 and published in 1872, following his first travel book &quot;The Innocents Abroad&quot; (1869). &quot;Roughing It&quot; is dedicated to Twain&#x27;s mining companion Calvin H. Higbie, later a civil engineer who died in 1914.

The book follows the travels of young Mark Twain through the American West during the years 1861–1867. He joined his brother Orion Clemens, who had been appointed Secretary of the Nevada Territory, on a stagecoach journey west. Twain consulted his brother&#x27;s diary to refresh his memory and borrowed heavily from his imagination for many stories in the book.

&quot;Roughing It&quot; illustrates many of Twain&#x27;s early adventures, including a visit to Salt Lake City, gold and silver prospecting, real-estate speculation, a journey to the Kingdom of Hawaii, and his beginnings as a writer. This memoir provides examples of Twain&#x27;s rough-hewn humor, which became a staple of his writing in later books such as &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; (1884), &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; (1876), and &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot; (1889).

==In popular culture==
U.S. astronauts Frank Borman and Jim Lovell read &quot;Roughing It&quot; aloud to pass the time aboard NASA&#x27;s Gemini VII, a 14-day-long Earth orbital mission in December 1965.

In &quot;Lords of St. Thomas&quot;, a 2018 historical novel set in St. Thomas, Nevada, the main character &quot;Little&quot; Henry Lord is reading &quot;Roughing It&quot; when he learns that his father has fallen from the Hoover Dam.

==Adaptations==
Various sections of &quot;Roughing It&quot; were borrowed by television series such as &quot;Bonanza&quot;. In 1960, an hour-long adaptation was broadcast on NBC starring Andrew Prine and James Daly.

A four-hour 2002 mini-series adaptation was broadcast on Hallmark Channel. Directed by Charles Martin Smith, it starred James Garner as an elderly Samuel Clemens and Robin Dunne as a young Clemens.

&quot;Roughing It&quot; recounts midway through the book that a rich &quot;blind lead&quot; gold strike was discovered and claimed by a partnership of Twain, Calvin Higbie, and a mine foreman A.D. Allen, giving them well-founded hopes of being millionaires. To establish a claim, it was required that any or all of the claimants do a reasonable amount of work on the claimed strike within ten days. Due to chance happenings and failed communications between the three, the work requirement was left unfulfilled, and the forfeited but rich claim was quickly seized by others ten days after it was discovered. In the dedication of the book, Twain refers to Higbie as an &quot;Honest Man, a Genial Comrade, and a Steadfast Friend … dedicated in Memory of the Curious Time When We Two Were Millionaires for Ten Days&quot;. The prospecting story is also covered in a 1968 episode of the syndicated television anthology series &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, hosted by Robert Taylor. In the television dramatization, Tom Skerritt plays Twain, and Dabney Coleman was cast as Higbie.

<doc id="1280581" wikidata="Q1511686" url="?curid=1280581" title="Hamartia">
<text>The term hamartia derives from the Greek , from &quot;hamartánein&quot;, which means &quot;to miss the mark&quot; or &quot;to err&quot;. It is most often associated with Greek tragedy, although it is also used in Christian theology. The term is often said to depict the flaws or defects of a character and portraying these as the reason of a potential downfall. However, other critics point to the term&#x27;s derivation and say that it refers only to a tragic but random accident or mistake, with devastating consequences but with no judgment implied as to the character.

==Definition==
&quot;Hamartia&quot; as it pertains to dramatic literature was first used by Aristotle in his &quot;Poetics&quot;. In tragedy, &quot;hamartia&quot; is commonly understood to refer to the protagonist&#x27;s error that leads to a chain of actions which culminate in a reversal of events from felicity to disaster.

What qualifies as the error or flaw varies, and can include an error resulting from ignorance, an error of judgment, an inherent flaw in the character, or a wrongdoing. The spectrum of meanings has invited debate among critics and scholars and different interpretations among dramatists.

== In Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot; ==
Hamartia is first described in the subject of literary criticism by Aristotle in his &quot;Poetics&quot;. The source of &quot;hamartia&quot; is at the juncture between character and the character&#x27;s actions or behaviors as described by Aristotle.

In his introduction to the S. H. Butcher translation of &quot;Poetics&quot;, Francis Fergusson describes &quot;hamartia&quot; as the inner quality that initiates, as in Dante&#x27;s words, a &quot;movement of spirit&quot; within the protagonist to commit actions which drive the plot towards its tragic end, inspiring in the audience a build of pity and fear that leads to a purgation of those emotions, or catharsis.

Jules Brody, however, argues that &quot;it is the height of irony that the idea of the tragic flaw should have had its origin in the Aristotelian notion of &quot;hamartia&quot;. Whatever this problematic word may be taken to mean, it has nothing to do with such ideas as fault, vice, guilt, moral deficiency, or the like. &quot;Hamartia&quot; is a morally neutral non-normative term, derived from the verb hamartanein, meaning &#x27;to miss the mark&#x27;, &#x27;to fall short of an objective&#x27;. And by extension: to reach one destination rather than the intended one; to make a mistake, not in the sense of a moral failure, but in the nonjudgmental sense of taking one thing for another, taking something for its opposite. &quot;Hamartia&quot; may betoken an error of discernment due to ignorance, to the lack of an essential piece of information. Finally, &quot;hamartia&quot; may be viewed simply as an act which, for whatever reason, ends in failure rather than success.&quot;

In a Greek tragedy, for a story to be &quot;of adequate magnitude&quot; it involves characters of high rank, prestige, or good fortune. If the protagonist is too worthy of esteem, or too wicked, their change of fortune will not evoke the ideal proportion of pity and fear necessary for catharsis. Here Aristotle describes &quot;hamartia&quot; as the quality of a tragic hero that generates that optimal balance. 

== Tragic flaw, tragic error, and divine intervention ==
Aristotle mentions &quot;hamartia&quot; in &quot;Poetics&quot;. He argues that it is a powerful device to have a story begin with a rich and powerful hero, neither exceptionally virtuous nor villainous, who then falls into misfortune by a mistake or error (&quot;hamartia&quot;). Discussion among scholars centers mainly on the degree to which hamartia is defined as &quot;tragic flaw&quot; or &quot;tragic error&quot;.

===Critical argument for flaw===
Poetic justice describes an obligation of the dramatic poet, along with philosophers and priests, to see that their work promotes moral behavior. 18th-century French dramatic style honored that obligation with the use of &quot;hamartia&quot; as a vice to be punished &quot;Phèdre&quot;, Racine&#x27;s adaptation of Euripides&#x27; &quot;Hippolytus&quot;, is an example of French Neoclassical use of &quot;hamartia&quot; as a means of punishing vice. Jean Racine says in his Preface to &quot;Phèdre&quot;, as translated by R.C. Knight:

The play is a tragic story about a royal family. The main characters&#x27; respective vices—rage, lust and envy—lead them to their tragic downfall.

===Critical argument for error===
In her 1963 &quot;Modern Language Review&quot; article, &quot;The Tragic Flaw: Is it a Tragic Error?&quot;, Isabel Hyde traces the twentieth-century history of &quot;hamartia&quot; as tragic flaw, which she argues is an incorrect interpretation. Hyde draws upon the language in Butcher&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;Poetics&quot; regarding &quot;hamartia&quot; as both error and &quot;defect in character&quot;. Hyde points out a footnote in which Butcher qualifies his second definition by saying it is not a &quot;natural&quot; expression to describe a flaw in behavior. Hyde calls upon another description from A.C. Bradley&#x27;s &quot;Shakespearean Tragedy&quot; of 1904 which she contends is misleading:

Hyde goes on to elucidate interpretive pitfalls of treating &quot;hamartia&quot; as tragic flaw by tracing the tragic flaw argument through several examples from well-known tragedies including &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;.

Hyde observes that students often state &quot;thinking too much&quot; as Hamlet&#x27;s tragic flaw upon which his death in the story depends. That idea does not, however, offer explanation for the moments when Hamlet does act impulsively and violently. It also embarks down a trail of logic that suggests he ought to have murdered Claudius right away to avoid tragedy, which Hyde asserts is problematic.

In &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, she observes that the ideas of Oedipus&#x27; hasty behavior at the crossroads or his trust in his intellect as being the qualities upon which the change of fortune relies is incomplete. Instead, to focus on his ignorance of the true identity of his parents as the foundation of his downfall takes into account all of his decisions that lead to the tragic end. Rather than a flaw in character, error, in Oedipus&#x27; case based upon lack of information, is the more complete interpretation. 
In his 1978 &quot;Classical World&quot; article &quot;Hamartia, Atë, and Oedipus&quot;, Leon Golden compares scholarship that examines where to place &quot;hamartia&#x27;s&quot; definition along a spectrum connecting the moral, flaw, and the intellectual, error. His goal is to revisit the role, if any, Atë, or divine intervention, plays in &quot;hamartia&quot;. The Butcher translation of &quot;Poetics&quot; references &quot;hamartia&quot; as both a &quot;single great error&quot;, and &quot;a single great defect in character&quot;, prompting critics to raise arguments.

Mid-twentieth-century scholar Phillip W. Harsh sees &quot;hamartia&quot; as tragic flaw, observing that Oedipus assumes some moral ownership of his demise when he reacts excessively with rage and murder to the encounter at the crossroads. Van Braam, on the other hand, notes of Oedipus&#x27; &quot;hamartia&quot;, &quot;no specific sin attaching to him as an individual, but the universally human one of blindly following the light of one&#x27;s own intellect.&quot; He adds that a defining feature of tragedy is that the sufferer must be the agent of his own suffering by no conscious moral failing on his part in order to create a tragic irony.

O. Hey&#x27;s observations fall into this camp as well. He notes that the term refers to an action that is carried out in good moral faith by the protagonist, but as he has been deprived of key pieces of information, the action brings disastrous results. J.M. Bremer also conducted a thorough study of &quot;hamartia&quot; in Greek thought, focusing on its usage in Aristotle and Homer. His findings lead him, like Hyde, to cite &quot;hamartia&quot; as an intellectual error rather than a moral failing.

===Critical arguments on divine intervention===
J. M. Bremer and Dawe both conclude that the will of the gods may factor into Aristotelian &quot;hamartia&quot;. Golden disagrees. Bremer observes that the Messenger in &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; says, &quot;He was raging - one of the dark powers pointing the way, ...someone, something leading him on - he hurled at the twin doors and bending the bolts back out of their sockets, crashed through the chamber,&quot;. Bremer cites Sophocles&#x27; mention of Oedipus being possessed by &quot;dark powers&quot; as evidence of guidance from either divine or daemonic force.

Dawe&#x27;s argument centers around tragic dramatists&#x27; four areas from which a protagonist&#x27;s demise can originate. The first is fate, the second is wrath of an angry god, the third comes from a human enemy, and the last is the protagonist&#x27;s frailty or error. Dawe contends that the tragic &quot;dénouement&quot; can be the result of a divine plan as long as plot action begets plot action in accordance with Aristotle.

Golden cites Van Braam&#x27;s notion of Oedipus committing a tragic error by trusting his own intellect in spite of Tiresias&#x27; warning as the argument for human error over divine manipulation. Golden concludes that &quot;hamartia&quot; principally refers to a matter of intellect, although it may include elements of morality. What his study asserts is separate from &quot;hamartia&quot;, in a view that conflicts with Dawe&#x27;s and Bremer&#x27;s, is the concept of divine retribution.

== In Christian theology ==
&quot;Hamartia&quot; is also used in Christian theology because of its use in the Septuagint and New Testament. The Hebrew (&quot;chatá&quot;) and its Greek equivalent (&quot;àμaρtίa&quot;/&quot;hamartia&quot;) both mean &quot;missing the mark&quot; or &quot;off the mark&quot;.

There are four basic usages for &quot;hamartia&quot;: 

# &quot;Hamartia&quot; is sometimes used to mean acts of sin &quot;by omission or commission in thought and feeling or in speech and actions&quot; as in Romans 5:12, &quot;all have sinned&quot;.
# &quot;Hamartia&quot; is sometimes applied to the fall of man from original righteousness that resulted in humanity&#x27;s innate propensity for sin, that is original sin. For example, as in Romans 3:9, everyone is &quot;under the power of sin&quot;.
# A third application concerns the &quot;weakness of the flesh&quot; and the free will to resist sinful acts. &quot;The original inclination to sin in mankind comes from &quot;the weakness of the flesh&quot;.&quot;
# &quot;Hamartia&quot; is sometimes &quot;personified&quot;. For example, Romans 6:20 speaks of being enslaved to &quot;hamartia&quot; (sin).

<text>Józef Henryk Przytycki (, ; born 14 October 1953 in Warsaw, Poland), is a Polish mathematician specializing in the fields of knot theory and topology.

== Academic background ==
Przytycki received a Master of Science degree in mathematics from University of Warsaw in 1977 and a PhD in mathematics from Columbia University (1981) advised by Joan Birman. Przytycki then returned to Poland, where he became an assistant professor at the University of Warsaw. From 1986 to 1995 he held visiting positions at the University of British Columbia, the University of Toronto, Michigan State University, the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, the University of California, Riverside, Odense University, and the University of California, Berkeley.

In 1995 he joined the Mathematics Department at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., where he became a professor in 1999. According to the Mathematics Genealogy Project, he has supervised 16 PhD students (as of 2022).

== Research ==
Przytycki co-authored more than 100 research papers, 25 conference proceedings and 2 books.

In 1987, Przytycki and Pawel Traczyk published a paper that included a description of what is now called the HOMFLY(PT) polynomial. Postal delays prevented Przytycki and Traczyk from receiving full recognition alongside the other six discoverers. Przytycki also introduced skein modules in a paper published in 1991; see also his entry in the online Encyclopedia of Mathematics.

Przytycki has co-organized the conference Knots in Washington each semester since 1995. He also co-organized several international Knot Theory conferences in Europe, for example &quot;Knots in Poland&quot; (1995, 2003 and 2010), &quot;Knots in Hellas&quot; (1998 and 2016), and the &quot;Advanced School and Conference on Knot Theory and its Applications to Physics and Biology&quot;, Trieste, Italy (2009).

== Personal life ==
Józef Przytycki is married to computational biologist and mathematician Teresa Przytycka (born 1958). They have two sons.

<text>Runology is the study of the runic alphabets, runic inscriptions, and their history. Runology forms a specialized branch of Germanic linguistics.

==History==
Runology was initiated by Johannes Bureus (1568–1652), who was interested in the linguistics of the &quot;Geatish language&quot; (&quot;Götiska språket&quot;), i.e. Old Norse. However, he did not look at the runes as merely an alphabet, but rather something holy or magical.

The study of runes was continued by Olof Rudbeck the Elder (1630–1702) and presented in his collection &quot;Atlantica&quot;. The physicist Anders Celsius (1701–1744) further extended the science of runes and traveled around Sweden to examine the &quot;bautastenar&quot; (megaliths, today termed runestones). Another early treatise is the 1732 &quot;Runologia&quot; by Jón Ólafsson of Grunnavík.
The sundry runic scripts were well understood by the 19th century, when their analysis became an integral part of the Germanic philology and historical linguistics.
Wilhelm Grimm published his &quot;Über deutsche Runen&quot; in 1821, where among other things he dwelt upon the &quot;Marcomannic runes&quot; (chapter 18, pp. 149–159). In 1828, he published a supplement, titled &quot;Zur Literatur der Runen&quot;, where he discusses the &quot;Abecedarium Nordmannicum&quot;.

Sveriges runinskrifter was published from 1900. The dedicated journal &quot;Nytt om runer&quot; has been published by the &quot;Runic Archives&quot; of the Museum of Cultural History at the University of Oslo from 1985. The Rundata project, aiming at a machine-readable catalogue of runic inscriptions, was initiated in 1993.

<doc id="1280596" wikidata="Q7689442" url="?curid=1280596" title="Tax increment financing">
<text>Tax increment financing (TIF) is a public financing method that is used as a subsidy for redevelopment, infrastructure, and other community-improvement projects in many countries, including the United States. The original intent of a TIF program is to stimulate private investment in a blighted area that has been designated to be in need of economic revitalization. Similar or related value capture strategies are used around the world.

Through the use of TIF, municipalities typically divert future property tax revenue increases from a defined area or district toward an economic development project or public improvement project in the community. TIF subsidies are not appropriated directly from a city&#x27;s budget, but the city incurs loss through forgone tax revenue. The first TIF was used in California in 1952. By 2004, all U.S. states excepting Arizona had authorized the use of TIF. The first TIF in Canada was used in 2007.

==Use==
Tax increment financing subsidies, which are used for both publicly subsidized economic development and municipal projects, have provided the means for cities and counties to gain approval of redevelopment of blighted properties or public projects such as city halls, parks, libraries etc. The definition of blight has taken on a broad inclusion of nearly every type of land including farmland, which has given rise to much of the criticism. &quot;

To provide the needed subsidy, the urban renewal district, or TIF district, is often drawn around additional real estate beyond the project site to provide the needed borrowing capacity for the project or projects. The borrowing capacity is established by committing all normal yearly future real estate tax increases from every parcel in the TIF district (for 20–25 years, or more) along with the anticipated new tax revenue eventually coming from the project or projects themselves. If the projects are public improvements paying no real estate taxes, all of the repayment will come from the adjacent properties within the TIF district.

Although questioned, it is often presumed that even public improvements trigger gains in taxes above what would occur in the district without the investment. In many jurisdictions yearly property tax increases are restricted and cannot exceed what would otherwise have occurred.

The completion of a public or private project can at times result in an increase in the value of surrounding real estate, which generates additional tax revenue. Sales-tax revenue may also increase, and jobs may be added, although these factors and their multipliers usually do not influence the structure of TIF.

The routine yearly increases district-wide, along with any increase in site value from the public and private investment, generate an increase in tax revenues. This is the &quot;tax increment.&quot; Tax increment financing dedicates tax increments within a certain defined district to finance the debt that is issued to pay for the project. TIF was designed to channel funding toward improvements in distressed, underdeveloped, or underutilized parts of a jurisdiction where development might otherwise not occur. TIF creates funding for public or private projects by borrowing against the future increase in these property-tax revenues.

==History==
Tax increment financing was first used in California in 1952 and there are currently thousands of TIF districts operating in the US, from small and mid-sized cities to large urban areas. As of 2008, California had over four hundred TIF districts with an aggregate of over $10 billion per year in revenues, over $28 billion of long-term debt, and over $674 billion of assessed land valuation. The state of California discontinued the use of TIF financing due to lawsuits in 2011, and enacted the California Fiscal Emergency Proclamation 2010, thereby ending the diversion of property tax revenues from public funding, including the use of TIFs for the funding of the nearly 400 redevelopment agencies in the state. The RDAs appealed that decision, though they were eventually eliminated in February 2012 after the passage of the 2011 state budget.

However, in 2015, the California Community Revitalization and Investment Authority Act was made law, providing for the creation of Community Revitalization and Investment Authorities (CRIAs), funded by Tax-Increment Financing. The primary purposes of CRIAs are the development or preservation of affordable housing for low and moderate income households (a minimum of 25% of TIF funding must be placed in an affordable housing fund) and creation or upgrading of public infrastructure in economically disadvantaged areas as defined under the provisions of the law. Additionally, Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Districts (EIFDs) may be created and financed by TIFs in California.

With the exception of Arizona, every state and the District of Columbia has enabled legislation for tax increment financing. Some states, such as Illinois, have used TIF for decades, but others have only recently embraced TIF. The state of Maine has a program named TIF; however, this title refers to a process very different than in most states.

Since the 1970s, the following factors have led local governments (cities, townships, etc.) to consider tax increment financing: lobbying by developers, a reduction in federal funding for redevelopment-related activities (including spending increases), restrictions on municipal bonds (which are tax-exempt bonds), the transfer of urban policy to local governments, State-imposed caps on municipal property tax collections, and State-imposed limits on the amounts and types of city expenditures. Considering these factors, many local governments have chosen TIF as a way to strengthen their tax bases, attract private investment, and increase economic activity.

==Urban regeneration==
In a 2015 literature review on best practices in urban regeneration, cities across the United States are seeking ways to reverse trends of unemployment, declining population and disinvestment in their core downtown areas, as developers continue to expand into suburban areas. Re-investment in downtown core areas include mixed-use development and new or improved transit systems. With successful revitalization comes gentrification with higher property values and taxes, and the exodus of lower income earners.

== Unintended consequences ==
Like any economic tool, TIF comes with drawbacks. Organizations such as Municipal Officials for Redevelopment Reform (MORR) use to hold regular conferences on redevelopment abuse, as well as local organizations like Chicago&#x27;s 33 Ward Working Families.

*As efficient market theory predicts, and now empirical evidence from economic studies suggests cities that adopt TIF grow more slowly than those that do not. A literature review by David Merriman, a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago found TIF &quot;may be moving development from one part of the city to another, and changing the timing of the development, but there&#x27;s not more development than would have otherwise been made.&quot; 
*TIF increases the property taxes of the areas next to a TIF district by reducing the [Total Taxable Property Value]. Congressman Mike Quigley simplified the math and showed if a [Tax Rate] = [Revenue to be Raised] / [Total Taxable Property Value], then reducing the denominator, [Total Taxable Property Value], increases the [Tax Rate]. A property owner&#x27;s [Tax Bill] is typically [Tax Rate] x [Assessed Property Value], thus as a new TIF district reduces the [Total Taxable Property], the [Tax Rate] and [Tax Bill] increases for property owners near the TIF district. State Representative Keneth Nordtvedt of Montana paraphrased the scheme this way, &quot;All property taxes --- city, county, school, state --- are exempted on TIF districts’ incremental properties, and then districts put a monetarily equal fee on those properties. Though collected by county treasurer as a tax, that fee is given to TIF district development boards to spend. The adversely affected taxing jurisdictions like school districts, county government, even city government&#x27;s general fund, are then quietly directed by law to make themselves whole by raising their levies on properties outside of the TIF districts so as to compensate for revenues lost from the TIF district incremental properties.&quot;
*As investment in an area increases, it is not uncommon for real estate values to rise and for gentrification to occur. 
* Although generally sold to legislatures as a tool to redevelop blighted areas, some districts are drawn up where development would happen anyway, such as ideal development areas at the edges of cities. California has passed legislation designed to curb this abuse.
* The designation of urban areas as &quot;blighted,&quot; essential to most TIF implementation, can allow governmental condemnation of property through eminent domain laws. The famous Kelo v. City of New London United States Supreme Court case, where homes were condemned for a private development, arose over actions within a TIF district.
*The TIF process arguably leads to favoritism for politically connected developers, implementing attorneys, economic development officials, and others involved in the processes. However, most Urban Renewal Authorities require public notice and have competitive bidding requirements.
* In some cases, school districts within communities using TIF are experiencing larger increases in state aid than districts not in such communities. This may be creating an incentive for governments to &quot;over-TIF,&quot; consequently taking on riskier development projects. Local governments are under no obligation to recognize when TIF designation would adversely affect a school district&#x27;s financial condition, and consequently the quality of some schools can be compromised.
* Normal inflationary increases in property values can be captured with districts in poorly written TIFs, representing money that would have gone into the public coffers even without the financed improvements.
* Districts can be drawn excessively large thus capturing revenue from areas that would have appreciated in value regardless of TIF designation.
* Approval of districts can sometimes capture one entity&#x27;s future taxes without its &quot;official&quot; input, i.e. a school districts taxes will be frozen on action of a city.
* Capturing the full tax increment and directing it to repay the development bonds ignores the fact that the incremental increase in property value likely requires an increase in the provision of public services, which will now have to be funded from elsewhere, often from subsidies from less economically thriving areas. The use of tax increment financing to create a large residential development means that public services from schools to public safety will need to be expanded, yet if the full tax increment is captured to repay the development bonds, other money will have to be used. For example, a study in Saint Louis Missouri found low-income students lost 91 times more than wealthier students in the suburbs due to TIF, and students with disabilities as the second hardest hit group.

==Examples==
===Chicago===
The city of Chicago, in Cook County, Illinois, has a significant number of TIF districts and has become a prime location for examining the benefits and disadvantages of TIF districts. The city runs 131 districts with tax receipts totaling upwards of $500 million for 2006. Lori Healey, appointed commissioner of the city&#x27;s Planning and Development department in 2005 was instrumental in the process of approving TIF districts as first deputy commissioner.

The Chicago Reader, a Chicago alternative newspaper published weekly, has published articles regarding tax increment financing districts in and around Chicago. Written by staff writer Ben Joravsky, the articles are critical of tax increment financing districts as implemented in Chicago.

Cook County Clerk David Orr, in order to bring transparency to Chicago and Cook County tax increment financing districts, began to feature information regarding Chicago area districts on his office&#x27;s website. The information featured includes City of Chicago TIF revenue by year, maps of Chicago and Cook County suburban municipalities&#x27; TIF districts.

The Neighborhood Capital Budget Group of Chicago, Illinois, a non-profit organization, advocated for area resident participation in capital programs. The group also researched and analyzed the expansion of Chicago&#x27;s TIF districts.

In April 2009, the &quot;TIF Sunshine Ordinance&quot; introduced by Alderman Scott Waguespack and Alderman Manuel Flores (then 1st Ward Alderman) passed City Council. The ordinance made all TIF Redevelopment Agreements and attachments available on the city&#x27;s website in a searchable electronic format. The proposal intended to improve the overall transparency of TIF Agreements, thereby facilitating significantly increased public accountability.

According to an article published in the &quot;Journal of Property Tax Assessment &amp; Administration&quot; in 2009, the increase in the use of TIF in Chicago resulted in a &quot;substantial portion of Chicago&#x27;s property tax base and the land area&quot; being subsumed by these levy zones—&quot;26 percent of the city&#x27;s land area and almost a quarter of the total value of commercial property is in TIF districts&quot; by 2007. The study notes the difficulties in establishing how effective TIF are.

===Albuquerque===
Currently, the 2nd largest TIF project in America is located in Albuquerque, New Mexico: the $500 million Mesa del Sol development. Mesa del Sol is controversial in that the proposed development would be built upon a &quot;green field&quot; that presently generates little tax revenue and any increase in tax revenue would be diverted into a tax increment financing fund. This &quot;increment&quot; thus would leave governmental bodies without funding from the developed area that is necessary for the governmental bodies&#x27; operation.

===Detroit===
In July 2014, Detroit&#x27;s Downtown Development Authority announced TIF financing to build a new arena for the Detroit Red Wings. The total project cost, including additional private investments in retail and housing, is estimated at $650 million, of which $250 million will be financed using TIF capture to repay 30-year tax exempt bonds purchased by the Michigan Strategic Fund, the state&#x27;s economic development arm.

===California===
In an article published in 1998 by Public Policy Institute of California, Michael Dardia challenged the governing redevelopment agencies&#x27; (RDAs) assumption &quot;that redevelopment pays for itself through tax increment financing. The claim is that RDAs &quot;receive any increase in property tax revenues (above a two percent inflation factor) in project areas because their investment in area improvements is responsible for increasing property values.&quot; Dardia argued that property tax revenues channeled to tax increment financing results in revenues lost to &quot;other local jurisdictions—the county, schools, and special districts&quot; and if the RDAs &quot;are not largely responsible for the increase in property values, those jurisdictions are, in effect, subsidizing redevelopment, with no say in how the revenues are used.&quot;

By December 6, 2010, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger issued a fiscal emergency which was reaffirmed by Governor Jerry Brown in December 2011 to underscore &quot;the need for immediate legislative action to address California&#x27;s massive budget deficit.&quot; Governor Brown enacted measures to stabilize school funding by reducing or eliminating the diversion of property taxes from the public sector including, school districts, to RDAs. New legislation including Assembly Bill 26 and Assembly Bill 27 were passed, which led to the elimination of California&#x27;s nearly 400 redevelopment agencies thereby stopping the diversion of property tax revenues from public funding. The RDAs appealed the decision, however they were eventually eliminated. The state reintroduced the option of tax-increment financing for the funding of Community Revitalization and Investment Authorities (CRIAs) in 2015, the latter being authorities created by local governments to create or upgrade infrastructure and create or preserve affordable housing for low and moderate income households. Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Districts (EIFDs) in the state are also financed by a tax-increment bond and their purposes are largely similar, though the requirement for use and the projects covered are somewhat different.

====Alameda====
In 2009, SunCal Companies, an Irvine, California-based developer, introduced a ballot initiative that embodied a redevelopment plan for the former Naval Air Station Alameda and a financial plan based in part on roughly $200 million worth of tax increment financing to pay for public amenities. SunCal structured the initiative so that the provision of public amenities was contingent on receiving tax increment financing, and on the creation of a community facilities (Mello-Roos) district, which would levy a special (extra) tax on property owners within the development. Since Alameda City Council did not extend the Exclusive Negotiation Agreement with Suncal, this project will not move forward. In California, Community Redevelopment Law governs the use of tax increment financing by public agencies.

===Iowa===
In 2002 economists at Department of Economics Iowa State University, claimed that &quot;existing taxpayers, its householders, wage earners, and retirees are aggressively subsidizing business growth and population&quot; TIF designated zones in Iowa.

===Wisconsin===

TIFs were established in Wisconsin in 1975. In 2001 critics argued that TIF supported developers to develop in green spaces citing a 2000 &quot;1,000 Friends of Wisconsin&quot; report which stated that 45% of tax incremental financing districts were used to develop open space land.

===Denver===
From 1995 through 2005 Denver tax payers were able to leverage over $5 billion in private investment by committing to over half a billion dollars of TIF subsidies. At that time new TIF subsidized projects under consideration included the &quot;redevelopment of the old Gates Rubber Factory complex at I-25 and Broadway, and the realization of Denver&#x27;s ambitious plans for the downtown Union Station area.&quot; Denver&#x27;s urban landscape was transformed from 1995 through 2005 through TIF-subsidized projects such as &quot;the landmark resurrection&quot; of the Denver Dry Goods building, the Adams Mark hotel, Denver Pavilions, and REI flagship store, Broadway Marketplace shopping area and the demolition of the old Woolworth&#x27;s building, the relocation and expansion of Elitch&#x27;s into the Six Flags Elitch Gardens Amusement park, the redevelopment of Lowry Air Force Base and the redevelopment of the old Stapleton airport – &quot;the largest urban infill project in the nation.&quot;

By 2005 the City Denver had already &quot;mortgaged over $500 million in future tax revenue to pay off existing TIF subsidies to private developers&quot; and was preparing to &quot;increase that sum substantially with several new TIF projects in the next five years.&quot; In 2005 the &quot;diversions of tax revenue to pay for TIF subsidies [represented] an annual cost of almost $30 million to Denver taxpayers, and [were] rising rapidly.&quot; By 2007 TIF tax expenditures in the form of forgone tax revenue totaled nearly &quot;$30 million annually – equal to almost 7% of Denver&#x27;s entire annual General Fund revenues&quot; and at that time the amount was rapidly increasing. In a 2005 study it was revealed through wage surveys at TIF projects &quot;that jobs there pay substantially less than Denver average wages, and 14%-27% less even than average wages for comparable occupational categories.&quot;

In part 1 of a three part series researchers &quot;explained the history and mechanics of TIF, and analyzed the total cost of TIF to Denver taxpayers, including &quot;hidden&quot; costs from increased public service burdens that TIF projects do not pay for.&quot; In &quot;Who Profits from TIF Subsidies?&quot; researchers &quot;examined the types of businesses Denver attracts through TIF, and the profit rates of developers with whom Denver partners to bring TIF projects into existence, and the transparency of the TIF approval process.&quot; In part three of the study researchers examined &quot;quality and housing affordability at TIF-subsidized projects.&quot;

==Applications and administration==
Cities use TIF to finance public infrastructure, land acquisition, demolition, utilities and planning costs, and other improvements including sewer expansion and repair, curb and sidewalk work, storm drainage, traffic control, street construction and expansion, street lighting, water supply, landscaping, park improvements, environmental remediation, bridge construction and repair, and parking structures.

State enabling legislation gives local governments the authority to designate tax increment financing districts. The district usually lasts 20 years, or enough time to pay back the bonds issued to fund the improvements. While arrangements vary, it is common to have a city government assuming the administrative role, making decisions about how and where the tool is applied.

Most jurisdictions only allow bonds to be floated based upon a portion (usually capped at 50%) of the assumed increase in tax revenues. For example, if a $5,000,000 annual tax increment is expected in a development, which would cover the financing costs of a $50,000,000 bond, only a $25,000,000 bond would be typically allowed. If the project is moderately successful, this would mean that a good portion of the expected annual tax revenues (in this case over $2,000,000) would be dedicated to other public purposes other than paying off the bond.

==Community revitalization levy (CRL) in Canada==

By 2015 major Canadian cities had already implemented community revitalization levies (CRL)—the term used for TIFs in Canada.

===Alberta===
In April 2012, it was proposed that the Alberta government change regulations so that the Community Revitalization Levy (CRL) could be applied to remediation costs &quot;incurred by a private developer.&quot;

The Calgary Municipal Land Corporation (CMLC)—an arms-length a subsidiary of the City of Calgary, established in 2007, to revisit land use in the longtime deserted chunk of land in the east downtown core along the Bow River—used a CRL to develop Downtown East Village, Calgary making Calgary the first Canadian city to use the CRL. The CMLC &quot;committed approximately $CDN 357 million to East Village infrastructure and development&quot; and claims that it &quot;has attracted $CDN 2.4 billion of planned development that is expected to return $CDN 725 million of revenue to the CRL.&quot; The designated levy zone for the Rivers District CRL is wider than the East Village, making it financially sound since it collects taxes for twenty years on its anchor building, the 58-storey Bow tower, and from developments in nearby Victoria Park (Calgary).

In an interview with the &quot;Calgary Sun&quot; in February 2015, Michael Brown, CRL president and CEO said they were looking into a CRL for the development of the West Village similar to that used to finance the remediation of the East Village. In August CalgaryNEXT sports complex was proposed as a potential anchor to the levy zone. Local politicians expressed concern about the funding model, which proposed that the city would front between $440 and $690 million of the projected cost, most which would only be recouped over a long period of time. Mayor Naheed Nenshi commented that one of a number of challenges to the CalgaryNEXT proposal was the requirement of a community revitalization levy, along with the need for a land contribution from the city, &quot;and significant investments in infrastructure to make the West Village a complete and vibrant community.&quot; Edmonton, Alberta creating a CRL to revitalize the downtown with a massive development project including a new arena, park development and upgrades including sewers which total approximately $CDN 500 million. The city hopes to &quot;generate approximately $941 million in revenue in a medium-growth scenario.&quot;

===Ontario===
As of 2015, Toronto&#x27;s mayor John Tory plans on creating a levy zone to finance a C$2.7 billion SmartTrack surface rail line project spanning 53 kilometres.

<doc id="1280603" wikidata="Q141531" url="?curid=1280603" title="420 (dinghy)">
<text>The International 420 Dinghy is a sailing dinghy popular for racing and teaching. The hull is fiberglass with internal buoyancy tanks. The 420 has a bermuda rig, spinnaker and trapeze. It has a large sail-area-to-weight ratio, and is designed to plane easily. The 420 is an International class recognised by World Sailing. The name refers to the boat&#x27;s length of .

==History==
The International 420 was designed by Christian Maury in France in the year 1959. The class developed rapidly in France, being adopted nationally as a youth trainer for the larger Olympic class International 470. By the late 1960s the class was adopted by a few UK university sailing clubs for training and team racing.

===Construction===
The class adopted a policy of &quot;prudent evolution&quot; so as to allow development without making existing dinghies obsolete. The hull&#x27;s seaworthiness and stability at speed proved to be better than most of its contemporaries, and this together with its modest sail area make it fun to sail in heavy weather and thus an excellent youth trainer, qualities that led to its adoption for that role by the Royal Yachting Association in the mid-1970s. In addition, the international 420 is known for its inherent lightness. The floatability of the boat made for a safer training vessel.

With its trapeze and spinnaker it provides the capability for advanced sailing techniques for international standard sailors, while still remaining affordable and accessible to beginners. The International 420 maintains a large multinational class association. The combination of effective class management, the boat&#x27;s inherent sailing qualities, and prudent evolution have contributed to the class&#x27;s continuing success.

==Club 420==
The Club 420, or C420, is a derivative of the 420 and is not recognized by World Sailing or the International 420 Class Association. Designed by Vanguard boats in the 1970s, it has a heavier hull, reinforced for durability in institutional sailing, and a stiff, untapered mast. The boat is much more simple to sail, yet lacks the performance of the original dinghy due to its extra weight. The Club 420 is used extensively on the youth race circuit in the US, with over 5,000 boats in North America, but is not sailed in most other countries. It cannot be used at I420 class events.

==Z420==
The Z420 is a transformation of the Club 420. The Z420 hull is lighter and 40 percent stiffer than the C420. Whereas a C420 hull is composed of six pieces, the Z420 has only three molded components: the hull, the deck, and the mast partners. Unlike the C420, the Z420 does not include a spinnaker or trapeze in its rigging. Z420 boats are specially designed for college sailing and were used at the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association National Championships in 2014 for the first time.

==Events==
===420 World Championships===

Held every year since 1973 organized by the International 420 Class Association and recognised by World Sailing.
Three fleets current race separately which are the Male &amp; Mixed, Female and Open Under 17.

===420 Team Racing World Championship===
The boat has been used for team racing in both the ISAF Team Racing World Championship and the ISAF World Sailing Games however the class established its own team racing competition in 2015. Only the International 14 and Optimist (dinghy) class association hold a team racing based World Championships in addition to the two discipline led events.

===IYRU Women World Championships===

===World Sailing – Youth Sailing World Championships===
The class has been used extensively at the Youth Sailing World Championships which run by World Sailing this is different to the Class Worlds by way that equipment is supplied and entries are limited to one entry per nations but often from more nations.

<text>USS &quot;Plaice&quot; (SS-390), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the plaice, one of the various American flatfish; summer flounder. She participated in the Pacific War campaign of World War II, receiving six battle stars for her service. The United States later transferred her to Brazil in a joint cooperation program.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Plaice&quot; was laid down by the Portsmouth Navy Yard, Kittery, Maine, on 14 July 1943; launched on 15 November 1943, sponsored by Miss Eleanor Fazzi; and commissioned on 12 February 1944.

==Service history==

===United States Navy===

Following shakedown and training, &quot;Plaice&quot; got underway for the Panama Canal Zone on 15 April, and arrived Pearl Harbor on 13 May. She departed on her first war patrol in the Bonin Islands area on 3 June. &quot;Plaice&quot; torpedoed and sank &quot;Hyakufuku Maru&quot; on 30 June; &quot;Kogi Maru&quot; on 5 July; and &quot;Submarine Chaser No. 50&quot; on 18 July, before returning to Midway Island.

The submarine was off on her second war patrol on 17 August, this time in the Nansei Shoto area. In the early afternoon on 7 September, &quot;Plaice&quot; scored one torpedo hit on a &quot;Kongō Maru&quot;-class liner converted to an auxiliary cruiser. On 24 September, &quot;Plaice&quot; launched four torpedoes at a , briefly stopping its screws.

Three days later she sank &quot;Coast Defense Vessel No. 10.&quot;, and put three torpedoes into the side of a transport, which blossomed a bright orange flame. The patrol ended as &quot;Plaice&quot; drew into Midway on 7 October and got underway the following day for Pearl Harbor with .

&quot;Plaice&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 9 November for her third patrol in the Southwestern Japanese Empire off the coast of Shikoku and Kyūshū. On 9 December, she damaged . She patrolled the traffic lanes east of Van Diemen Strait and pulled into Guam 20 December without having sunk any ships on the patrol.

The undersea raider departed Guam on her fourth patrol in the Luzon Straits-Formosa areas. &quot;Plaice&quot; was part of a coordinated attack group which included , , , , and . This long patrol in the face of enemy antisubmarine measures resulted in but one contact worthy of torpedo fire, a convoy of a small freighter, a medium freighter and three escorts. Three attacks resulted in but one hit. On 23 March 1945, &quot;Plaice&quot; moored at Midway.

The fifth patrol originated from Midway on 26 April and took &quot;Plaice&quot; to the Kuril Islands-Okhotsk Sea area. The first enemy contact was made on 13 May, when the submarine trailed four sea trucks and four small luggers until she opened a surface engagement with her and 40 mm guns, sinking all four sea trucks and two luggers.

When all her larger ammunition had been expended, she drove the remaining two luggers toward the beach and damaged them by 20 mm and small arms fire. On 18 May, seven fishing boats came into view. The staccato of 20 mm and .50 caliber guns tore into two of the boats and damaged them visibly. &quot;Plaice&quot; ended her patrol at Pearl Harbor 13 June.

The sixth patrol - commencing on 18 July - took &quot;Plaice&quot; to the East China Sea area, but she made no enemy contacts. She picked up five survivors from an Army B-25 Mitchell, and transferred them to a Navy patrol bomber the following day. On 15 August, Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration and nine days later &quot;Plaice&quot; pulled into Midway.

After the war was over, &quot;Plaice&quot; operated in the Pacific until, by directive dated November 1947, she was placed out of commission, in reserve, at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. &quot;Plaice&quot; was reactivated 18 May 1963 in preparation for a five-year loan to Brazil on 7 September 1963 under the Military Assistance Program.

===Brazilian Navy===
&quot;Capitão-de-Fragata&quot; (Commander) Abílio Simões Machado of the Brazilian Navy took command of the submarine at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 7 September 1963. Commissioned in the Brazilian Navy as &quot;Bahia&quot; (S-12), she was the first &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine to undergo alterations at the Brazilian Navy Arsenal in Rio de Janeiro; her hydrodynamic shape was modified with the installation of a new conning tower and periscope guide. After the completion of the modifications, &quot;Bahia&quot;″s underwater speed increased by one knot and she was quieter when submerged.

&quot;Bahia&quot; took part in UNITAS naval exercises and assisted in surveillance in the South Atlantic Ocean during the Cold War. She logged 140,503 nautical miles (260,212 kilometers), spending 2,863 hours submerged and 836 days at sea. Her loan to Brazil was extended beyond its original five-year term at regular intervals.

&quot;Bahia&quot; was decommissioned on 19 January 1973. She was sold to the Technology Museum of São Paulo, which intended to tow her to Santos, Brazil, and convert her into a museum ship. However, these plans were not realized, and instead &quot;Bahia&quot; was scrapped following a ceremony on 27 March 1973.

==Awards==
&quot;Plaice&quot; received six battle stars for her World War II service.

<text>Jan Sigurd Baalsrud, MBE (13 December 1917 – 30 December 1988) was a commando in the Norwegian resistance trained by the British during World War II.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Jan Baalsrud was born in Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway and moved with his family to Kolbotn in the early 1930s. He lived there until the 1950s. He graduated as a cartographical instrument-maker in 1939.

=== World War II ===
During the German invasion of Norway in 1940, Baalsrud fought in Vestfold. He later escaped to Sweden, which was neutral, but he was convicted of espionage and expelled from the country.

In 1941, Baalsrud reached Great Britain after having travelled through the Soviet Union, Africa and the US. He joined the Norwegian Company Linge. In early 1943, he, three other commandos, and a boat crew of eight, all Norwegians, embarked on a mission to destroy a German airfield control tower at Bardufoss, and recruit for the Norwegian resistance movement.

This mission, Operation Martin, was compromised when Baalsrud and his fellow soldiers, seeking a Resistance contact, accidentally made contact with a civilian shopkeeper who had taken over the store run by their intended contact and had the same name. Fearing for his life and suspecting it was a test by the Germans, he reported them to the local police office, which notified the Germans.

The morning after their blunder, on 29 March, their fishing boat &quot;Brattholm&quot;  – containing around 100 kilograms of explosives intended to destroy the air control tower – was attacked by a German vessel. The Norwegians scuttled their boat by detonating the explosive using a time-delay fuse and fled in small boats, but they were promptly sunk by the Germans.

Baalsrud and others swam ashore in ice-cold Arctic waters. Baalsrud was the only commando to evade capture and, soaking wet and missing one sea boot, he escaped into a snow gully, where he shot and killed a German Gestapo officer with his pistol.

Kolker summarises what happened next as follows: 
What happened over those nine weeks remains one of the wildest, most unfathomable survival stories of World War II. Baalsrud&#x27;s feet froze solid. An avalanche buried him up to his neck. He wandered in a snowstorm for three days. He was entombed alive in snow for another four days and abandoned under open skies for five more. Alone for two more weeks in a cave, he used a knife to amputate several of his own frostbitten toes to stop the spread of gangrene. He spent the last several weeks tied on a stretcher, near death, as teams of Norwegian villagers dragged him up and down hills and snowy mountains.

He evaded capture for approximately two months, suffering from frostbite and snow blindness. His deteriorating physical condition forced him to rely on the assistance of Norwegian patriots.

It was during this time, that he hid in a wooden hut at Revdal, which he called Hotel Savoy. Baalsrud operated on his feet with a pocket knife, as he suspected he had gangrene in two toes, resulting from the frostbite. Fearing it would spread, he cut off his big toe and the infected bit of the index toe.

Not long after that, Baalsrud was left on a high plateau, on a stretcher in the snow, where he was supposed to be collected by the Norwegian resistance. Due to weather and German patrols in the town of Manndalen, Kåfjord, he was there for 27 days and was close to death for lack of food. It was during this time, while he lay behind a snow wall built around a rock to shelter him, that Baalsrud amputated nine of his toes to stop the spread of gangrene. This action saved the rest of his feet.

Fellow Norwegians transported Baalsrud by stretcher toward the border with Finland. He was put in the care of some Sami (the native people of northern Fenno-Scandinavia). While driving their reindeer on spring passage, they pulled him on a sled across Finland and into neutral Sweden. From Kilpisjärvi, in northern Finland, Baalsrud was collected by a Red Cross seaplane and flown to Boden.

Baalsrud spent seven months in a Swedish hospital in Boden before he was flown back to Britain in an RAF de Havilland Mosquito aircraft. He soon went to Scotland to help train other Norwegian patriots, who were going to enter Norway to continue the fight against the Germans.

After a long struggle to learn to walk without his toes, Baalsrud eventually was sent to Norway as an agent at his request. He was still in active service at the time of the war&#x27;s end, in 1945. That ended German occupation, and Baalsrud traveled to Oslo to reunite with his family, whom he had left five years before.

Baalsrud was appointed honorary Member of the Order of the British Empire by the British. He was awarded the St. Olav&#x27;s medal with Oak Branch by Norway. He was a Second Lieutenant (Fenrik).

=== Later years and death ===
After the war, Baalsrud contributed to the local scout and football associations. In addition, he was chairman of the Norwegian Disabled Veterans Union from 1957 to 1964. In 1962, he moved to Tenerife, Canary Islands, where he lived for most of the remainder of his life. He returned to Norway during his final years.

He lived there until his death on 30 December 1988, aged 71. His ashes are buried in Manndalen, in a grave shared with Aslak Aslaksen Fossvoll (1900–1943), one of the local men who helped him escape to Sweden.

==Legacy==

An annual remembrance march in Baalsrud&#x27;s honour takes place on 25 July in Troms, where the participants follow his escape route for nine days.

A street in Kolbotn, Norway is named Jan Baalsruds plass (Jan Baalsrud&#x27;s Place) in his honor.

In 2020, a bust in bronze created by sculptor Håkon Anton Fagerås on commission was unveiled.

She was born on October 6, 1969 in Onitsha, Anambra State, Nigeria. She is recognized as one of the pioneers of African animation and is often referred to as the &quot;mother of African Animation.&quot; With over 16 years of experience in the animation industry, Ebele has made significant contributions to the field and is an influential figure in both the animation and poetry film communities. She has lived in Germany since the year 2000

She is a fluent speaker of Igbo, English, and German.

==Career==
Before migrating to Germany in 200, Ebele Okoye was active in fine and media arts and constantly showed her works in both one-man and group exhibitions (see section). Upon graduation from the Animation school in 2004, Ebele briefly worked as a key animator in animation studios before venturing into independent animation production in 2006.

Earlier in 2009, she founded Shrinkfish Animation Studios in Abuja Nigeria, which aimed to operate with a remote working model. Though this model was ahead of its time, it inspired the development of her subsequent successful studio, Jolly Squid Ltd (Jolly Squid Media). This studio has thrived, particularly after the adoption of remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Between 2007 and 2013, Ebele contributed as a writer in some relevant publications and journals including (compiling the Nigerian Chapter for ) the book in the book “Animation: A World History”, by the Italian historian Giannalberto Bendazzi. Also, Ebele contributed to the early editions of the (now defunct) Journal &quot;Nigerian Brands, where she wrote animation-relevant articles.

In 2010, Ebele Okoye founded &quot;The Animation Club&quot; Africa, a networking platform on Facebook.

In 2013, she founded the Shrinkfish Media Lab (smedLAB) which was Nigeria&#x27;s pioneer animation course. After that, she went on to modify the course for further editions but the Ebola Epidemic that lasted till 2016 disrupted these plans.

In 2015, &quot;The Legacy of Rubies&quot; won the Africa Movie Academy Award for Best Animation. In her acceptance speech for the award in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, Okoye stated &quot;I did not make this film to chase awards,&quot; &quot;I made this film, to inspire every African animator who wants to make animation films.&quot; &quot;The Legacy of Rubies&quot; had its Canadian premiere at the Toronto Black Film Festival in 2016.

In 2016 she announced plans for a feature-length film, hinting that it might be &quot;like &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot; and &quot;Pocahontas&quot; put together.&quot; Later in 2023, Okoye published a social media article explaining why this film never came to fruition as it was marred by several life occurrences and announced that it is back to the slate for development

In 2019, Okoye began creating virtual reality (VR) art and animation in Oculus Quill

In 2021, Ebele introduced &quot;Motion to the Sound(MTTS)&quot;, a &quot;sustainable&quot; version of smedLAB, with special subprograms &quot;AniJolly Girls&quot; (targeting only women) and MTTS Quick Slice (targeting young people)

In 2022, Ebele founded Spunky Toonz, a branded animation and EdTech startup that creates audio-visual materials aimed at shaping healthy, communal, and ecology-friendly mindsets in preschoolers and young children.

Throughout her career so far, Ebele has produced animation films and led international co-productions, collaborating with diverse clients and partners, including Universal Music Group for whom she animated the Motown Hit &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot; by Martha and the Vandellas, Universal Pictures, Nickelodeon, Deutsche Welle Documentary, ZDF/ARTE, Robert Bosch Foundation, BMZ/GIZ, Focus Features, Deutsche Aidshilfe, and more.

Ebele&#x27;s work has earned her numerous awards and recognitions, including the Robert Bosch Foundation Promotional Prize for Animation (for &quot;Anna Blume&quot;, based on a 1919 poem by Kurt Schwitters,), DEFA Foundation Research Prize, Africa Movie Academy Awards (2x), the Redefreiheit of Amnesty International for &quot;Outstanding media work in human rights issues,&quot; and the Focus Features Africa First Short Film Programme, (for &quot;The Legacy of Rubies&quot;) among many others.

<doc id="1280630" wikidata="Q558522" url="?curid=1280630" title="M. F. Husain">
<text>Maqbool Fida Husain (17 September 1915 – 9 June 2011) was an Indian painter and film director who painted narrative paintings in a modified Cubist style. He was one of the founding members of Bombay Progressive Artists&#x27; Group. M.F. Husain is associated with Indian modernism in the 1940s. His early association with the Bombay Progressive Artists&#x27; Group used modern technique, and was inspired by the &quot;new&quot; India after the partition of 1947. His narrative paintings, executed in a modified Cubist style, can be caustic and funny as well as serious and sombre. His themes—sometimes treated in series—included topics as diverse as Gandhi, Mother Teresa, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the British Raj, and motifs of Indian urban and rural life. In September 2020, his painting titled “Voices”, auctioned for a record $2.5 million.

Husain&#x27;s later works have stirred controversy, which included nude portrayals of Hindu deities, and a nude portrayal of Bharat Mata. Right-wing organisations called for his arrest, and several lawsuits were filed against him for hurting religious sentiments. He remained in a self imposed exile from 2006 until his death in 2011, accepting Qatari citizenship in 2010.

In 1967, he received the National Film Award for Best Experimental Film for &quot;Through the Eyes of a Painter&quot;. In 2004, he directed &quot;&quot;, a film he worked on with his artist son Owais Husain, which was screened in the Marché du film section of the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.

==Biography==
Maqbool Fida Husain was born on 17 September 1915 in Pandharpur, Bombay Province (present-day Maharashtra) in a Suleymani Bohra family. He picked up taste in art through studying calligraphy while he stayed at a Madrasa in Baroda. Husain attended the Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art in Mumbai but couldn&#x27;t finish his schooling. Early in his career, Husain painted cinema posters in Mumbai. To earn additional income, he worked for a toy company designing and building toys. He often travelled to Gujarat to paint landscapes whenever he could afford to travel.

Husain developed his painting skills in the 1930s, painting billboards for the growing Bollywood film industry. This was a clique of young artists who wished to break with the nationalist traditions established by the Bengal school of art and to encourage an Indian avant-garde, engaged at an international level. In 1934, he sold his first painting for 10 rupees on the roadside. Husain&#x27;s father, who was an accountant, wanted him to get into business.

The artists cite &quot;The Partition&quot; of India and Pakistan 14 August 1947, with its resulting religious rioting and heavy loss of life as their reason for forming The Progressive Artist&#x27;s Group in Bombay in December 1947. The artists saw the Partition as a &quot;turning point&quot; for India, and their new style of art was urged on by, and was also a turning point for, (modern) Indian Art. Husain&#x27;s first solo art exhibition was in 1952 in Zürich. His first U.S. exhibit was at India House in New York City in 1964. his biography written by Akhilesh &quot;Maqbool&quot; is the most appreciated book published by Rajkamal Prakashan New Delhi.

Husain was a special invitee along with Pablo Picasso at the São Paulo Biennial, Brazil in 1971. He was nominated to the Rajya Sabha in 1986. He married Fazila Bibi (d. 1998) in 1941, they had six children: four sons (including artists Shamshad and Owais) and two daughters - Raisa, his muse and an actress and costume designer in his films and Aqueela, his muse.

===1990–2005===
Although he was raised in a Muslim household, Husain sought freedom to capture the essence of beauty in other religious cultures, for which he received a backlash. His paintings allegedly hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus, which beginning in the 1990s mounted a campaign of protest against him. The paintings in question were created in 1970, but did not become an issue until 1996, when they were printed in &quot;Vichar Mimansa&quot;, a Hindi monthly magazine, which published them in an article headlined &quot;M.F. Husain: A Painter or Butcher&quot;. In response, eight criminal complaints were filed against him. In 2004, Delhi High Court dismissed these complaints of &quot;promoting enmity between different groups ... by painting Hindu goddesses – Durga and Sarswati, that was later compromised by Hindu fundamentalist groups.&quot;
In 1998 Husain&#x27;s house was attacked by Hindu fundamentalist groups like Bajrang Dal and art works were vandalised. The leadership of another fundamentalist political party Shiv Sena endorsed the attack. Twenty-six Bajrang Dal activists were arrested by the police. Protests against Husain also led to the closure of an exhibition in England.

He has also produced and directed several films, including &quot;Gaja Gamini&quot; (2000) (with his muse Madhuri Dixit who was the subject of a series of his paintings which he signed &quot;Fida&quot;). The film was intended as a tribute to Ms. Dixit herself. In this film she can be seen portraying various forms and manifestations of womanhood including the muse of Kalidasa, the Mona Lisa, a rebel, and musical euphoria. He also appeared in a scene in film &quot;Mohabbat&quot;, which had Madhuri Dixit in lead role. In the film, the paintings that were supposedly done by Madhuri were actually Husain&#x27;s. He went on to make &quot;&quot; (with Tabu). The film was pulled out of cinemas a day after some Muslim organisations raised objections to one of the songs in it. The All-India Ulema Council complained that the Qawwali song &quot;Noor-un-Ala-Noor&quot; was blasphemous. It argued that the song contained words directly taken from the Quran. The council was supported by Muslim organisations like the Milli Council, All-India Muslim Council, Raza Academy, Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Hind and Jamat-e-Islami. Husain&#x27;s son stated that the words were a phrase referring to divine beauty that were being sung by the central character played by Tabu. He said there was no intention to offend. Following the wave of protests the enraged artist withdrew his movie from cinemas. The film was well received by the critics, however, and went on to win various awards.

===2006–2011===
In February 2006, Husain was charged with &quot;hurting sentiments of people&quot; because of his nude portraits of Hindu gods and goddesses. In addition, on 6 February 2006 issue, &quot;India Today&quot;, a national English weekly published an advertisement titled &quot;Art For Mission Kashmir&quot;. This advertisement contains a painting of {Bharatmata} (Mother India) as a nude woman posed across a map of India with the names of Indian States on various parts of her body. The exhibition was organised by Nafisa Ali of Action India – an (NGO) and Apparao Art Gallery. Organisations like VHP protested persistently against Husain displaying the painting on the websites and even in exhibitions in north Europe. As a result, Husain apologised and promised to withdraw the painting from an auction, though it later sold for Rs 80 lakh. The painting later appeared on Husain&#x27;s official website. Husain claims that the loss of his mother at the age of a year and a half is a possible reason for his pattern of paintings depicting a maternal Indian figure.

Husain became the best-paid painter in India, his highest-selling piece fetching $1.6 million at a 2008 Christie&#x27;s auction.

Hundreds of lawsuits in connection with Husain&#x27;s allegedly obscene art were outstanding as of 2007. A warrant was issued for his arrest after he did not appear at a hearing, though this warrant was later suspended.

Husain lived in self-imposed exile from 2006 until his death. He generally lived in Doha and summered in London. For the last years of his life Husain lived in Doha and London, staying away from India, but expressing a strong desire to return, despite fears of being prosecuted.

In 2008 Husain was commissioned to create 32 large-scale paintings of Indian history. He finished 8 before his death. In 2010, he was conferred Qatari citizenship, and surrendered his Indian passport; though he still held an Overseas Citizenship of India. In Qatar, he principally worked on two large projects, one on the history of Arab civilisation, commissioned by Qatar&#x27;s first lady, Mozah bint Nasser Al Missned, and one on the history of Indian civilisation. The works are to be housed in a museum in Doha.

At the age of 92 Husain was given the prestigious Raja Ravi Varma award by the government of Kerala. The announcement led to controversy in Kerala and some cultural organisations campaigned against the granting of the award and petitioned the Kerala courts. Social Activist, Rahul Easwar, went to Kerala High Court and it granted an interim order to stay the granting of the award until the petition had been disposed of.

In 2010, the Jordanian Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre named Husain as one of the 500 most influential Muslims.

Husain died, aged 95, on 9 June 2011, following a heart attack. He had been unwell for several months. He died at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London, and was buried in Brookwood Cemetery on 10 June 2011.

Other Indian artists expressed criticism. Satish Gujral publicly asked Husain whether he would dare to portray Islamic figures similarly. However Gujral stated that he deeply regretted the way Husain was treated and forced into an exile because of what Gujral termed &quot;the mob culture&quot;. And Harsh Goenka, a Mumbai-based industrialist, claims that forcing Husain into exile &quot;is, in a way, showing the weakness of the system, that we cannot protect the rights of the citizen&quot;.

Writing in &quot;The Pioneer&quot;, Chandan Mitra wrote, &quot;As long as such a law exists in the statutes, nobody can be faulted for approaching the courts against Husain&#x27;s objectionable paintings, nor can the judiciary be pilloried for ordering action against the artist for his persistent and deliberate refusal to appear before the court.&quot;

In response to the controversy, Husain&#x27;s admirers petitioned the government to grant Husain the Bharat Ratna, India&#x27;s highest award. According to Shashi Tharoor, who supported the petition, it praised Husain because his &quot;life and work are beginning to serve as an allegory for the changing modalities of the secular in modern India – and the challenges that the narrative of the nation holds for many of us. This is the opportune and crucial time to honour him for his dedication and courage to the cultural renaissance of his beloved country.&quot; Husain had such a vast amount of work that spanned over 10 decades producing roughly 40,000 paintings by the end of his lifetime.

On his part Husain stated that leading Hindu leaders have not spoken a word against his paintings, and they should have been the first ones to have raised their voice and only people with political intentions created controversy.

After Husain&#x27;s death, Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray said, &quot;He only slipped up on the depiction of Hindu gods and goddesses. Otherwise, he was happy and content in his field. If his demise is a loss for modern art, then so be it. May Allah give him peace!&quot;

<text>PS Audio is an American company specializing in high-fidelity audio components (also known as high-end audio) equipment for audiophiles and the sound recording industry. It currently produces audio amplifiers, preamplifiers, power related products, digital-to-analog converters, streaming audio, music management software and cables.

==Corporate history==
PS Audio was founded in 1973 and shipped its first products in 1974. It was started by audio designers Paul McGowan and Stan Warren (with whose initials the company was named). Warren left the company in the early 1980s to form Superphon. His position as audio designer and co-owner was assumed by Dr. Bob Odell, an audio designer who had created notable Harman Kardon designs. McGowan left the company in 1990 to join Arnie Nudell of Infinity Systems to build high-end speakers with Genesis Technologies.

PS Audio was purchased in 1990 by Steve Jeffery and Randall Patton, and operated independently until 1998. During this time, the company introduced its Ultra series of products, based on technology developed by the Ultra Analog Corporation, including the UltraLink DAC (&quot;Stereophile&quot; magazine product of the year) and Lambda transport. Jeffery and Patton later purchased Ultra Analog and Threshold Corporation.

In early 1997, PS Audio Inc. ceased operations due to financial problems. Shortly thereafter, Paul McGowan bought back the name &#x27;PS Audio&#x27;, and has been the CEO and principal designer for new products since then. In December 1997, he left Genesis Technologies to work full-time for PS Audio. In the first quarter of 2000, the new PS Audio International grew quickly, and Peter Rudy was added as president. In 2002, former owner Steve Jeffery became president. In 2009 he retired from the company and James H. Laib assumed the role of general manager. Laib became the company&#x27;s president in 2015.

As of July, 2019, PS Audio employs 51 people, nearly half of whom support its engineering team. Manufacturing takes place at PS Audio&#x27;s Boulder Colorado facility, and the company ships products worldwide.

==Historic products==

===Pre-1990s===
PS Audio&#x27;s first product was a standalone phono preamplifier, sold direct to consumers for $59.95. The small unit had a passive RIAA curve sandwiched between two 709C op amps running in class A mode and considered state of the art at the time for solid state. Later iterations of the phono preamplifier were introduced that moved away from the use of integrated IC op amps and moved to discrete high-voltage solid state amplification modules, retaining the passive RIAA curve. Models include the II and the III.

To augment the company&#x27;s standalone phono preamplifiers, standalone line stage preamplifiers were introduced next, known as Linear Control Centers or LCC. One of the innovative features of the LCC was a bypass switch that permitted the user to select the use of an internal amplification module or straight into the potentiometer for volume control. Originally labeled 0 dB (line stage in) or -20 dB (passive only) this feature remained with all future PS Audio line stages and preamplifiers, later becoming labeled Straightwire in or out.

With the advent of the III phono stage, the form factor moved from no faceplate to a small 8.5&quot; rack style faceplate enabling owners to combine the two chassis into one unit, thus forming the first PS Audio preamplifier with phono input. This series marked the end of the first era of modular chassis approach to preamplification.

Later preamplifier offering included the PS IV, the company&#x27;s first 17&quot; full chassis design and featured an external power supply for the first time in the American high-end audio industry. The IV featured a built in phono preamplifier with a novel switch on the bottom of the unit enabling users to select Moving Coil or Moving Magnet cartridges. Instead of adding in another circuit known as a head amp to increase the gain for Moving Coil cartridges, the IV took advantage of its passive RIAA curve design and simply increased the gain of the input amplification stage by an additional 30 dB. All future preamplifiers pre-1997 had this unique circuit that reduced the circuitry in the path of the phono cartridge.

During the same era (late 1970s) PS Audio introduced its first power amplifier, the Model One, a solid state design producing 70 watts per channel into 8 Ohms and 140 watts per channel into 4 Ohms. The design was a classic AB amplifier design featuring the company&#x27;s first full 19&quot; chassis design, large power supply, low feedback and minimalist design constraints. The Model One was later followed with the world&#x27;s first Audiophile integrated amplifier introduced by an American High-End company, the Elite. Based on the Model One architecture, the Elite integrated the Linear Control Center into a Model One amplifier chassis. The Model One was replaced by the Model II, moving back to a smaller modular chassis approach at 8.5&quot; with faceplate. The Model II produced 40 watts per channel into 8 Ohms, 70 watts per channel into 4 Ohms and had a Bridging switch enabling the user to bridge the internal stereo amplifiers into one mono amplifier, producing 160 watts into 4 Ohms. The Model II was followed by the IIC, featuring the same circuitry placed into a standard 19&quot; rack mount chassis. The IIC introduced a new concept to the Audiophile marketplace, use of a separate external power supply for an amplifier. Users could choose from two models of external power supply, one as standard and an upgrade to a larger High Current version. The concept of an external power supply was first introduced on the PS Audio IV preamplifier and later applied to power amplifiers like the IIC. The concept became known as the High Current Power Supply or HCPS and was popular because improvements to the sound quality were gained by moving to a larger power supply, both in the application of the preamplifier as well as power amplifiers. The model IIC is factory rated at 55 watts into 8 ohms and 200 watts bridged mode (400 watts into 4 ohms bridged). The IIC Plus is rated at 70 watts into 8 ohms. Amplifier successors to the IIC included the 250 Delta monoblock and the 100 Delta amplifier.

In the early 1980s and with the advent of the Compact Disc, PS was one of the first American high-end audio manufacturers to modify one of the few CD players of the day by replacing its internal audio amplification stage following the internal D to A player. The first and only modified CD player introduced by the company was the CD-1 based on the Philips Magnavox line of CD players. The company engineers chose the Magnavox unit because the belief at the time was it sounded better to its only rival in the marketplace, the Sony. Inside the CD 1 PS engineers added a discrete high voltage line stage and power supply, replacing the NE5532 op amps used as the output amplification stage of the Magnavox. This unit was a stopgap product designed to get the company &quot;in the game&quot; of this new format that would someday challenge vinyl, the company&#x27;s core products addressed. In the background, PS engineers were working to figure out a way to utilize the CD players digital output and create a standalone D to A converter. In late 1982, the company succeeded in releasing the first high-end standalone D to A converter known as the Digital Link. Other manufacturers such as Arcam and Theta were also on the same path and both companies released competing D to A processors within several months of the Digital Link&#x27;s introduction From this point onwards, the company has produced a succession of DACs with the same goal in mind - that of supplanting the built in DAC and line stage of CD players. Later advances in CD technology led the high-end audio industry to release a new category of product called a CD Transport that contained no DAC and meant to use as a pair which became known as a DAC and Transport combination.

===1990–1997===
From 1990 to 1997, co-founder McGowan left the company and joined Infinity founder Arnie Nudell to form Genesis Loudspeakers. During the 7-year period between 1990 and 1997 the company was owned and operated by Steve Jeffery, President and general manager and Randy Patton, VP of sales, marketing and product development.

Products during this era of the company took a somewhat different direction under the design guidance of Dr. Robert Odell and product development VP Randy Patton (Sumo). Preamplifiers built during this era included the 6.0 and 6.5 and were IC op amp based rather than discrete high-voltage designs of the past era. It was during this time period the company acquired a more modern look to the industrial design.

The biggest contributions to the company product legacy was the line of digital audio products engineered by the outside vendor Ultra Analog located in the Bay Area. Ultra Analog, headed by Dick Powers, was an engineering centric ODM/OEM producing some of the world&#x27;s first 24 bit DAC modules. These modules were hybrids potted in epoxy and were built around multiple Burr Brown 16 and 18 bit DAC chips. The first products from this partnership were the PS Audio Ultralink DAC, Reference Link DAC and A/D converter and Lambda transport. The Ultralink garnered Stereophile magazines product of the year. The Lambda transport was built around a Marantz CD mechanism. The Ultralink, Reference Link and Lambda transport were designed and built by Ultra Analog and marketed under the PS brand for nearly 5 years. PS Audio Inc. acquired Ultra Analog in 1994.

In 1995 PS Audio also acquired Hales loudspeakers and the Threshold Corporation. Following the two acquisitions Randy Patton purchased all shares of PS Audio from Steve Jeffery and owned 100% of the corporation. Steve Jeffery went on to be appointed President of the Wadia Corporation, a competing high-end audio DAC manufacturer.

Patton ran PS Audio and the Threshold Corporation until 1997 when the entity ceased operations and declared bankruptcy. Steve Jeffery, the primary creditor of the corporation, liquidated the remaining assets of the company and sold the name PS Audio back to McGowan, who restarted operations in 1998.

===1997–2014===
With the return of co-founder McGowan to PS Audio, the company returned to its roots of high-end audio by producing an entirely new category of product, the AC regenerator. McGowan reasoned that in order to return the company to viability in a very crowded and competitive market it was necessary to take a Blue Ocean Strategy and provide a product that solved a major problem in all high-end systems, the AC power feeding them.

Realizing that the (then) infantile power conditioning category consisted only of filters that cleaned power line noise and did not address the larger issues of voltage regulation and sine wave purity, a new type of product called a regenerator was created. The first regenerator prototype was large stereo power amplifier fed by a low distortion Hewlett-Packard sine wave oscillator. Each channel of the power amplifier produced 60 volts AC and when a load was placed across the two out of phase channels of the amplifier, the required 120 volts AC was achieved to power products. The research and prototype phase of the regenerator included various listening tests at different frequencies and 400 Hz was found to sound best (50 Hz and 60 Hz is standard) when equipment was powered by the amplifier. Further research negated the use of 400 Hz sine waves because many tube amplification systems were not filtered well enough at higher frequencies and the 400 Hz tone could be heard through the system. 60 Hz was the final design choice and the first product was launched. It was called a Power Plant and the model was the P300, producing up to 300 watts of regenerated, regulated AC power.

The P300 was designed to produce up to 300 watts of clean power to connected audio equipment. The P-300 had a digital sine wave stored in memory, which it passed through a digital-to-analog converter and then amplified to 117V (adjustable) at a frequency of 60 Hz (adjustable). Thus, connected equipment was provided with a precise 117V, 60 Hz power signal (in the US, other countries had units for their specific voltage and frequency) lacking noise from the utility company. The P-300 provided, in theory, perfect noise free power of the same specifications that the power company should be providing. Various additional &quot;waves&quot; known as &quot;multiwave&quot; were also provided.

The P-300 is a historically important product in high-end audio as it helped redefine and popularize the Power Conditioner product category and spawned imitation. This even though companies such as Accuphase followed with their own concept of power regeneration (though not additional waves, i.e., &quot;multiwave&quot; which PS audio claims provide additional benefits).

More powerful models of the P-300 were introduced including the P600, P1000, P1200 and P1000. The P-500 and P-1000 provided up to 500 and 1000 watts of &quot;clean&quot; power to connected equipment but with the penalty of generating a tremendous amount of heat in the process. Because Power Plants utilized a traditional analog class A/B stereo power amplifier they were only 50% efficient. This meant that for every watt delivered to the load, an identical watt of heat was generated, thus requiring massive heat sinks to dissipate the heat. On August 21, 2007, US patent 7259705 was issued to PS Audio for the design rights to a new efficient tracking power regenerator that improved efficiency from 50% to 85% based on the same principles of regeneration. That same year, PS Audio introduced the Power Plant Premier, the first of its new AC Regenerator products to utilize this tracking AC technology it patented. In 2010, the current generation of AC regenerators was launched and carry the model PerfectWave.

For high end cables, PS audio offered the &quot;Lab&quot; cable line which was replaced by the &quot;Lab II&quot; line, which was replaced by the &quot;XStream&quot; cable line. Currently the power cable line is the PerfectWave Power Cable line.

PS audio offered the PCA II preamplifier. This was discontinued and replaced with the GCP-200 preamplifier. Each had an optional phono stage and external power supply option.

For amplifiers, PS audio offered the HCA-2 &quot;digital&quot; amplifier. This was a switching amplifier (many would call this a Class D Amplifier) that provide about 150 watts per channel. A more conventional amplifier, the Classic 250, provided 250 Watts per channel. These amplifiers were discontinued and the follow-on amplifiers were all &quot;digital&quot; type amplifiers from the GCA line, which had flexibility in the number of channels or number of watts per channel desired.

===2014–present===
In recent years the company has grown dramatically in size, product range, and presence. The DirectStream DAC, launched in 2014, brought unique technologies to a DAC field crowded with similar chip-based solutions. Designer Ted Smith created a DAC based upon an FPGA (field-programmable gate array) which would allow owners to download and install no-cost firmware/OS upgrades which improve the unit&#x27;s performance over time, and ensure that it does not become obsolete. As of July, 2019, the company has offered nine OS upgrades; recent ones have been named after &quot;fourteeners&quot;, Colorado peaks which top 14,000 feet in height. The most recent of these is &quot;Snowmass&quot;, released in November, 2018. The DirectStream also converts all inputs to DSD for processing; in Snowmass, signals are converted to 20 x the nominal SACD rate (56.338Mhz) and then converted back down to quad rate DSD (11.2896 MHz), with the output stage being a passive low-pass filter. Thousands of DirectStream DACs have been sold, with many in use in recording studios and as reference components by reviewers.

Sprout, a compact integrated amplifier featuring a phono stage, Bluetooth, and a headphone amp, was introduced in a Kickstarter campaign in 2014; subsequently, thousands of units were sold. In 2018 a second generation unit, Sprout100, was introduced; the name reflected the increased power output of 100 watts/channel into 4 ohms. Other improvements included a fully asynchronous DAC that can handle 384/24 PCM or double rate DSD; dedicated subwoofer output; optional bass boost; high-quality, metal remote control; analog RCA inputs and outputs; and a TOSLINK optical input.

Since 2015, PS has released three amplification products designed by industry veteran Bascom H. King, under the line name of BHK Signature. During more than 40 years in audio, King has designed products for Infinity, Marantz, Conrad Johnson, Constellation, and Audeze, among many others, and the BHK Signature line represents the culmination of all his experience and knowledge. The BHK Signature Preamplifier input stage features two 12AU7 dual triode vacuum tubes, which act as a zero-feedback balanced input amplification pair. Volume is controlled by a combination of an input stepped attenuator, built around the highest quality passive components for coarse volume adjustments, after which the actual gain of the vacuum tube is controlled, for finer steps. The control is designed to have no sonic signature of its own. The unit&#x27;s output stage is a high-bias class-A MOSFET design that is unaffected by cable and power amplifier interface challenges. The BHK Pre also includes a headphone amp possessing extremely low/near zero output impedance, zero feedback, and featuring discrete MOSFET circuitry.

There are two amplifier models in the BHK Signature line: the Stereo 250 and Mono 300. Both utilize vacuum tube input stages and MOSFET outputs; the Stereo 250 produces 250 watts/per channel into an 8Ω loudspeaker, 500 watts/channel into 4Ω, and is stable into 2Ω. The Mono 300 produces 300 watts into 8Ω, 600 into 4Ω and more than 1,000 watts into 2Ω. The Mono 300 doubles the output current with half the impedance of the stereo model, by doubling every internal component of the 250 into one unit: double tubes, double power supplies, transistors, capacitors and resistors.

The high-value Stellar line was introduced in 2017, designed to bring PS Audio performance to lower-priced, full-sized components. The line was launched with three products: the Gain Cell DAC/preamp. the S300 stereo amp, and the M700 mono amps. The Gain Cell DAC is a moderately-priced combination DAC and preamp that also incorporates a high-performance headphone amp; the S300 produces 140 watts per channel into 8Ω; 300 watts per channel into 4Ω; and is stable into a 2Ω load. The M700 offers a measurable increase in performance that is immediately audible, is the least-expensive amplifier listed in Class A of Stereophile magazines Recommended Components list, and is also one of the most powerful. Its 350 watts into 8Ω, 700 watts into 4Ω, and stability into a 2Ω load ensure that the M700 can drive any loudspeaker. In March 2019, the Stellar P3 Power Plant was introduced, bringing PS Power Regenerator power technology to a lower price-point. A Stellar phono preamp will be introduced in Q3 of 2019, and a Stellar integrated amplifier will be released in 2020.

The Power Plant line of power regenerators has been periodically improved. Newer models consist of the P12, P15, and P20 Power Plants, differing primarily in their power-handling capacity and number of outlets. All three models utilize FPGA-based DSD sine wave generators. Both the P12 and P20 are listed in Stereophile&#x27;s Recommended Components list.

At Rocky Mountain Audio Fest in October 2018, PS exhibited the final prototype loudspeakers created by the late Arnie Nudell, founder of both Infinity Systems and Genesis Technologies and longtime friend of and mentor to PS Audio. These speakers featured several characteristic Nudell design features: dual servo-controlled, powered woofers; a cone mid-bass coupler; a ribbon linesource midrange; and a line array of spiral ribbon tweeters. While these design points do not necessarily reflect how future PS Audio loudspeakers will be designed, they do serve as a basis for experimentation and developments.

At Axpona in April, 2019, PS showed an initial prototype of the AN3 loudspeaker, intended to be the smallest of the AN line of speakers inspired by Arnie Nudell&#x27;s work. Development continues in the AN line, which will eventually consist of the AN3, the smallest; the AN2, larger and more elaborate; and the AN1, a full-scale assault upon the state of the art, along the lines of the legendary Infinity IRS V. Less-expensive speakers are intended to be introduced below the AN line: a Stellar line, also consisting of 3 models; and at least one Sprout loudspeaker, designed to be compatible with the Sprout 100 in both appearance and capabilities.

The company&#x27;s outreach has greatly increased in recent years, by way of co-founder/CEO Paul McGowan&#x27;s Daily Posts; his &quot;Ask Paul&quot; videos on YouTube; and Copper, a twice-monthly webzine devoted to music and audio that appears on the PS Audio website. PS Audio products have won many awards worldwide, including Editors&#x27; Choice awards from Stereophile and The Absolute Sound magazines; since 2017, PS has had more products on Stereophile&#x27;s Recommended Component lists than any other electronics manufacturer.

<text>Long-range surveillance (LRS) teams (pronounced &quot;lurse&quot;) were elite, specially-trained surveillance units of the United States Army employed for clandestine operation by Military Intelligence for gathering direct human intelligence information deep within enemy territory. Classic LRS employment is to infiltrate deep into enemy territory, construct hide and surveillance sites, and provide continuous surveillance/special reconnaissance of an intelligence target of key interest.

LRS teams allow 24-hour surveillance and analysis coverage unlike unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), manned aircraft, and most satellites. Assuming there is no mission compromise, these teams typically remain in position for up to six days, as determined by the availability of food and water.

As a result of an evaluation conducted using computer-modelling the U.S. Army&#x27;s senior leadership made the decision to deactivate all active-duty and National Guard LRS units. By the end of January 2017 the three active-duty LRS companies had ceased to exist, with its personnel being reassigned to other units. The seven National Guard LRS units followed suit in 2018.

==Mission==

Long Range Surveillance Units (LRSU) have four primary missions and five secondary missions as per Field Manual 3-55.93 Long Range Surveillance Unit Operations. The four primary missions are surveillance, zone and area reconnaissance, target acquisition, and target interdiction. Combat assessment/battle damage assessment is mentioned as not a standalone LRSU mission but inherent to all LRSUs. The five secondary missions are able to be completed if given the proper training and time to coordinate. The secondary missions include route reconnaissance, emplacement and recovery of sensors, pathfinder operations, personnel recovery and combat search and rescue, and chemical detection and radiological surveillance and monitoring operations.

LRS operations are characterized by the following:

# Clandestine LRS operations require operational security (OPSEC) and personnel security (PERSEC) measures and procedures before, during, and after mission employment. This is to protect the individual team members as well as maintain operational integrity of the LRS cell.
# Team members depend on stealth, cover, concealment, infantry, and Ranger skills.
# Team members avoid contact with enemy forces and local population.
# Teams are employed to obtain timely information.
# Teams have restricted mobility in the area of operations.
# Team members depend on communications, knowing the enemy&#x27;s order of battle, and equipment identification skills.
# The surveillance or reconnaissance area is small, has a specified route, or is a specific location or installation.
# Team equipment and supplies are limited to what can be man packed or cached.
# Teams require detailed intelligence preparation of the battlefield (IPB) and debriefing from the Intelligence Officer (G2) for employment.

== Organization ==

LRS units (LRSU) were infantry company-size elements that are assets within a battlefield surveillance brigade&#x27;s reconnaissance and surveillance squadron (R&amp;S squadron) designated as US Army cavalry but were functionally airborne infantry units. The LRSU was structured as an LRS company comprising three LRS detachments, a communications platoon, and a troop headquarters. Within the LRS company, the LRS detachments typically have designated specialties. Typically, there were three teams, also known as &quot;DETs.&quot; 1st DET typically specializes in mountainous terrain/warfare. 2nd DET specialized in airborne operations. 3rd DET was the dive detachment, specializing in water-borne operations such as scuba diving and infiltrating harbors and ports as well as employing the Zodiac.
LRS detachments were organized as five unsupported LRS teams.

== LRS team composition ==

As with LRRP units of the past each US Army LRS team was composed of six soldiers:

* Team leader (TL) staff sergeant (E-6) preferably Ranger qualified
* Assistant team leader (ATL) sergeant (E-5) preferably Ranger qualified
* Senior scout observer (SSO) specialist/corporal (E-4)
* Scout observer (SO) specialist/corporal (E-4)
* Radio telephone operator (RTO) specialist (E-4)
* Assistant radio telephone operator (ARTO) specialist (E-4)

All positions can be held by (E-1 up) to fill positions (upon meeting unit requirements)

== Reconnaissance and surveillance squadrons (R&amp;S squadrons) ==

From 2006 to 2015, United States Army long-range surveillance units were reorganized into newly formed battlefield surveillance brigades (BfSBs). These brigades contained a brigade headquarters and headquarters company (HHC), two Military Intelligence (MI) battalions, and a reconnaissance and surveillance (R&amp;S) squadron.

The BfSB’s R&amp;S squadron was composed of one LRS unit (i.e., Company C), which contains 15 LRS teams. Additionally, the R&amp;S squadron also had two cavalry troops (each containing two platoons) that conducted basic mounted and dismounted operations, and a headquarters and headquarters troop (HHT).

For a standard six-soldier LRS team, the primary method of insertion/infiltration behind enemy lines was at night by helicopter (night-time heliborne), while secondary methods included airborne and waterborne operations. In recent low-intensity conflicts, additional covert methods were added to enable enhanced operational capabilities.

== Contrast with reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) units ==

Although both are types of units in the United States Army, LRS units were not the same as RSTA units.

During the Army-wide transfer to brigade combat teams (BCTs), all combat divisions and separate brigades have transitioned to RSTA units. RSTA units have added light vehicle support in the form of Humvees (HMMWVs) and M3 Bradley Cavalry Fighting Vehicles (CFVs), due to being commissioned as Cavalry. RSTA squadrons also feature a company-sized dismounted reconnaissance troop, typically composed of infantry scouts, which conducts dismounted reconnaissance and surveillance operations.

LRS units, in contrast, did not utilize a larger vehicle support element. Most RSTA units are not Airborne-capable, whereas most LRS units were. Exceptions typically include the RSTA squadrons of airborne infantry BCTs, such as the 2nd BCT (Airborne), 11th Airborne Division; the 173rd Airborne BCT; and the four RSTA units in the 82nd Airborne Division).

== Equipment ==

LRS soldiers typically carried weapons that include the following: M4 carbine, M9 pistol, M249 squad automatic weapon (SAW/LMG), M203 grenade launcher, as well as mission-specific gear, including (but not limited to), optics, A/V recording devices, secure communications gear, etc.

== Training ==

LRS leaders typically graduated from the United States Army Reconnaissance and Surveillance Leaders Course (see link and course list below).

LRS soldiers were often graduates of other specialized military courses and training, including:

* U.S. Army Air Assault Course
* U.S. Army Jumpmaster Course
* U.S. Army Military Free Fall Parachutist Course
* U.S. Army Pathfinder Course
* U.S. Army Ranger Course
* U.S. Army Reconnaissance and Surveillance Leaders Course (RSLC)1,2
* U.S. Army Special Forces Combat Diver Qualification Course (SFCDQC)
* U.S. Army Special Forces Sniper Course (SFSC)3
* U.S. Army Special Forces Waterborne Infiltration Course (SFWIC)
* U.S. Army Special Operations Combat Medic (SOCM)
* U.S. Army Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE)
* U.S. Army Sniper Course

United States Army LRSUs have conducted training exercises and exchange programs with various U.S. allies. These exercises included deployments to England, Germany, France, Hungary, and Italy. Combined/Joint training exercises have involved units from Britain’s TA SAS, France&#x27;s 13e RDP, Belgium&#x27;s ESR, Italy&#x27;s 9th Parachute Assault Regiment, and Germany&#x27;s FSLK200.

The International Special Training Center (ISTC) trains NATO Special Operations Forces (SOFs) and similar units in advanced individual patrolling, battlefield medicine, close quarter battle (CQB), sniper, survival, planning, and recognition skills. Established in 1979, ISTC was originally named the International Long-Range Reconnaissance Patrol School (ILRRPS), and was formerly located in Weingarten, Germany before later moving to Pfullendorf, Germany.

<text>Allen Oldfather Whipple (September 2, 1881 – April 6, 1963) was an American surgeon who is known for the pancreatic cancer operation which bears his name (the Whipple procedure) as well as Whipple&#x27;s triad.

Whipple was born to missionary parents William Levi Whipple and Mary Louise Whipple (née Allen), in Urmia, West Azerbaijan, Iran. He attended Princeton University and received his M.D. from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (P&amp;S) in 1908, and was licensed to practice medicine in the state of New York on February 4, 1910 (NY License #10151). He became a professor of surgery at P&amp;S and Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center where he served from 1921 to 1946. He began work on the procedure for resection of the pancreas (pancreaticoduodenectomy) in 1935 and his original technique has since been modified greatly. In 1940, he shortened the procedure into a one-stage process. During his lifetime, Whipple performed 37 pancreaticoduodenectomies.

He also is known for developing the diagnostic triad for insulinoma known as Whipple&#x27;s triad.

He supervised the surgical residency of Virginia Apgar, later advising her to pursue her medical career in the field of anaesthesiology because he knew that surgery depended on advancements in this field to progress, and he saw in Apgar the &#x27;energy and ability&#x27; to make a significant contribution. Apgar later devised the Apgar Score also at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, by which the health of newborns is evaluated to this day.

Whipple was instrumental in founding the American Board of Surgery. He also was trustee of Princeton University and was a recipient of the 1958 Woodrow Wilson Award.

Though he is not related to George Hoyt Whipple — who named Whipple&#x27;s disease and discovered &quot;Tropheryma whipplei&quot; — the two were lifelong friends.

The Science Building at Wooster School in Danbury, Connecticut, is named after Whipple, who served as President of Wooster&#x27;s Board of Trustees when the school&#x27;s founder, Rev. Aaron Coburn, died. In the later years of his life he lived in Show Low, Arizona.

<doc id="1280667" wikidata="Q1900752" url="?curid=1280667" title="Raised pavement marker">
<text>A raised pavement marker is a safety device used on roads. These devices are usually made with plastic, ceramic, thermoplastic paint, glass or occasionally metal, and come in a variety of shapes and colors. Raised reflective markers, such as plastic, ceramic, or metal ones, include a lens or sheeting that enhances their visibility by retroreflecting automotive headlights, while glass road studs gather automotive headlights with a dome shape and reflect the lights with a reflective layer within. Some other names for specific types of raised pavement markers include convex vibration lines, Botts&#x27; dots, delineators, cat&#x27;s eyes, road studs, or road turtles. Sometimes they are simply referred to as &quot;reflectors&quot;.

==Convex vibration marking line==
The surface of this type of vibrating coating line is distributed and scattered with raised bumps. Some bumps are coated with high-refractive-index glass beads. When a speeding vehicle runs over the raised road lines, it produces a strong warning vibration to remind the car driver of deviation from the lane. Perpendicular to driving directions, these marking lines are used for settled mainline toll plaza, ramp entrances, mountainous areas, continuous sharp turns, downhill sections and the end of the highway (intersection of highway exit and the plane of the common roadway), gates and entrances of enterprises, institutions, and school. In the same direction of traffic driving direction, they are mainly settled in the median strip, edge lines, and dangerous sections of the road.

==Reflective raised pavement markers==

In the United States, Canada, Mexico, some countries of South America, Thailand and Australia, these plastic devices commonly have two angled edges facing drivers and containing one or more corner reflector strips. The marker is generally held in place using butyl pads, epoxy glue, or bitumen. In areas with little snowfall, reflective raised pavement markers are applied directly on top of the road surface. The device&#x27;s retroreflective surface enables the device to be clearly visible at long distances at night and in rainy weather. The devices come in multiple colors in accord with local traffic marking standards.

In 1965 San Diego Police Motorcycle Officer Kenneth Grant Maine, improved upon and applied for a patent on the white epoxy-resin reflective raised pavement marker. He then submitted it to the California Bureau of Highways, later called the California Department of Transportation and now known as Caltrans.

In areas where snowplowing is frequent, conventional markers are placed in a shallow groove cut in the pavement, or specially designed markers are used which include a protective metal casting that is embedded in recesses in the pavement, allowing the marker to protrude slightly above the pavement surface for increased visibility, much like a cat&#x27;s eye.
Lit LED in-pavement Raised Pavement Markings (RPMs), help improve road safety, as they are more generally visible than reflective RPM markings as they are internally lit and don&#x27;t require headlights to show up. The RPMs are usually raised for visibility, but in snowplow areas these types of RPMs can be installed flush-mounted within the pavement to avoid the snowplows.

There are a number of types, ranging from a single LED point source RPMs, with limited daytime visibilities, (road studs), to multi-LED linear type RPMs, visible in all full sunlight and nighttime applications.

Some lit RPMs can be visible and useful in both bright sunlight as well as nighttime applications, whilst others are only visible at nighttime or in low light applications.

One of the key differences between these types is that lit linear RPMs, being linear, each lit unit provides both positional and directional guidance to viewers. For single-point source viewer directional guidance, a number of these units must all be viewed at the same time. In severe weather, such as fog or snow whiteouts, this may not be possible. Therefore, as each linear visual aid provides both positional and directional guidance, this type is more helpful as in a wider variety of weather conditions and light conditions.

Some lit linear visual aids / RPMs, melt snow, without needing any additional heating elements, as such, these types or self-cleaning RPMs are more energy-efficient compared to those that need additional heating elements to melt snow so are NOT self-cleaning.

Linear visual aids can also be used for creating in-pavement signs and messages such as lit merge arrows. Point source RPMs could be used for such signage. However, because they are installed close together, and deep within the pavement compared to linear RPMs, such usage would tend to damage the road, especially in the case of asphalt roads. 

===Usage of color===
====In Europe====

In almost all European countries, such markers will include reflective lenses of some kind. Most appear white or gray during daylight; the colors discussed here are the color of light they reflect. Because of their inconspicuousness during the day, they are always used in conjunction with painted retro-reflective lines; they are never seen on their own.

*White markers — for lane markings. When used on dual carriageways, motorways or one-way roads, they may illuminate red on the reverse, to indicate drivers are traveling the wrong way.
*Yellow or amber markers — These are found next to the central reservation (US: median) on motorways and dual carriageways and, in the Republic of Ireland, are also used on hard shoulders.
*Red markers — These are found by the hard shoulder on motorways and at the edge of the running surface on other roads. They are also occasionally used to indicate a no-entry road and when travelling down the wrong way of the motorway/dual carriageway.
*Green markers — These are used where slip-roads (US: off-ramp) leave and join the main carriageway on dual carriageways. In some countries, they are also used across the entrances of minor roads or accesses onto major single carriageway roads or lay-bys.
*Blue markers — Are used to indicate the entrance to police reserved slip-roads (these do not lead anywhere, they are to allow police to park and monitor motorway traffic).

The exception to the above rules are:
*Fluorescent yellow markers — These are used to indicate temporary lanes during roadworks on major roads and are glued to the road surface; they are never embedded in it. Any painted markings will be removed from the road surface if they contradict the markers. They are fluorescent yellow in color, so they stand out in the day, but reflect white light at night. Where used, they are much more numerous and dense than standards markers, as they are not used in conjunction with painted lines. They also appear yellow on the edges but reflect red on the left side or amber on the right

====In North America====

*White markers — for lane markings or to mark the right pavement edge.
*Yellow or orange markers — These separate traffic moving in opposite directions, or mark the left pavement edge on one-way roadways.
*Blue markers — Usually placed near the center of the roadway, offset to one side to mark the location of fire hydrants on the shoulder or at the curb.
*Green markers — Usually used to indicate that emergency vehicles can open gates to enter a gated community.
*Red markers — Usually indicate areas that are closed to traffic.

Colors can also be combined, with a different color facing each direction:
*White and red or yellow and red — white or yellow for normal use in one direction, and red to indicate &quot;do not enter&quot; or &quot;wrong way&quot; in the other direction. Red-Clear Markers are primarily used to warn motorists they are going the wrong way; most people have never seen these because they show clear when approached in the correct direction, and only appear red to wrong-way drivers.
*White and black — white for marking lane restrictions (such as an HOV diamond) in one direction on a roadway that has &quot;reversible&quot; traffic flow, and black in the other direction when the markings do not apply.

The current trend for lane markings is to intersperse retroreflective paint lines with reflectors as seen on the majority of American highways.

This scheme only applies to the US and Canada. Mexico, on the other hand, generally follows European usage.

==== In Japan ====

If marked on the road, the color should match the purpose according to European counterparts. Also, fluorescent yellow markers are used to indicate temporary lanes during roadworks on major roads in Japan.

Two other markers are adopted for use in Japan, taken from North American usage:

* White and red or yellow and red — white or yellow for normal use in one direction, and red to indicate &quot;do not enter&quot; or &quot;wrong way&quot; in the other direction.
* White and black — white for marking lane restrictions in one direction on a roadway that has &quot;reversible&quot; traffic flow, and black in the other direction when the markings do not apply.

The design of the markers is diagonal.

==== In Thailand ====
In Thailand, raised marker colors generally follow European usage but road markings follow the MUTCD. However, Thailand also adopted three uses of marker colors, one different from European usage:

* Blue — Used to mark the location of fire hydrants
* White and red or yellow and red — white or yellow for normal use in one direction, and red to indicate &quot;do not enter&quot; or &quot;wrong way&quot; in the other direction.
* White and black — white for marking lane restrictions in one direction on a roadway that has &quot;reversible&quot; traffic flow, and black in the other direction when the markings do not apply.

Thailand&#x27;s raised markers use the American design.

====In the Commonwealth====
Countries formerly part of the British Empire are likely to retain a modified version of the British laws including the basic principles regarding road safety.

==== In Hong Kong ====
Hong Kong&#x27;s raised marker colors are identical to those used in the United Kingdom.

* White — For lane markings and central reservation (US: median) on motorways and dual carriageways
* Red, yellow or amber — Lines that should not be crossed. Red is used for the left side of a dual carriageway, while yellow or amber is used for the right side of a dual carriageway.
* Green — A line that may be crossed, such as a slip road or lay-by

==== In Australia ====

While Australian designs generally follow those in the US, the colors generally follow European usage. Differences from European usage include:
* Blue — Usually used to mark the location of fire hydrants, as in North America
* Yellow — In addition to marking the median of freeways, in Victoria single yellow reflectors are used with broken yellow lines to denote tram tracks on which motorized traffic can drive, and double yellow reflectors are used with solid yellow lines to denote tram tracks on which motorized traffic may not drive other than to cross.

==== In Latin America ====
For countries in Latin America, the colors of raised markers vary by country to country. For most countries, they tend to generally follow the European counterparts rather than North American counterparts, but in several countries of Latin America, such as Mexico, the usage of blue follows the North American counterpart.

===History===

Cat&#x27;s eyes made out of metal were the earliest form of retroreflective pavement markers, and are in use in the United Kingdom and other parts of the world. They were invented in the United Kingdom in 1933 by Percy Shaw and patented in 1934 (UK patents 436,290 and 457,536), and the United States in 1939 (US patent 2,146,359). On March 15, 1935, Shaw founded Reflecting Roadstuds Ltd, which became the first manufacturer of raised pavement markers.

The plastic markers now used widely throughout the United States and elsewhere appeared three decades later. They were originally invented by American engineer Sidney A. Heenan in the course of his employment with the Stimsonite Corporation in Niles, Illinois. Heenan filed an application for a patent on October 23, 1964. Patent No. 3,332,327 was subsequently granted on July 25, 1967.

Stimsonite went on to become the leading manufacturer of retroreflective raised pavement markers in the United States and was acquired in 1999 by Avery Dennison Corporation. For six years, Avery sold Stimsonite&#x27;s line under its Sun Country brand. In 2006, Avery sold its raised pavement marker division to Ennis Paint, one of the largest manufacturers worldwide of paint for pavement markings (particularly lane markings). The company (based in Ennis, Texas) changed its name to Ennis Traffic Safety Solutions and now markets the Stimsonite product line and descendants under the Stimsonite brand. Other manufacturers of retroreflective raised pavement markers sold in the United States under various designs include 3M, Apex Universal, Vialume, and Ray-O-Lite.

==Glass road studs==

Glass road studs have a very special shape: the upper half is a dome shape, and the lower half is a base covered with a reflective layer. They come in a variety of colors and sizes to meet the requirements of different applications. Currently they are widely adopted in Taiwan.

==Cat&#x27;s eyes==

Cat&#x27;s eyes, in their original form, consist of two pairs of retroreflective glass spheres set into a white rubber dome, mounted in a cast-iron housing. They generally come in a variety of colors. They have enjoyed widespread usage in the British Isles and elsewhere around the world.

==Botts&#x27; dots==
Nonreflective raised pavement markers (also known as Botts&#x27; dots) are usually round, are white or yellow, and are frequently used on highways and interstates in lieu of painted lines. They are glued to the road surface with epoxy and as such are not suitable in areas where snow plowing is conducted. They are usually made out of plastic or ceramic materials.

==Pedestrian crossing studs==

In the UK, the area in which pedestrians should cross at pelican crossings is marked out by a series of markers. Usually, these are painted as squares on the road but occasionally a metal stud is used. These are usually square and made from unpainted steel or aluminum.

==Delineator==

Delineators are tall pylons (similar to traffic cones or bollards) mounted on the road surface, or along the edge of a road, and are used to channelize traffic. These are a form of raised pavement marker but unlike most such markers, delineators are not supposed to be hit except by out-of-control or drifting vehicles. Unlike their smaller cousins, delineators are tall enough to impact not only a vehicle&#x27;s tires but the vehicle body itself. They usually contain one or more retroreflective strips. They can be round and open in the center or curved (45-degree sections) of plastic with a reflective strip. They are also used in low reflective markers in a &quot;T&quot; shape. They can also be used to indicate lane closures as in cases where the number of lanes is reduced.

Delineators are often used in snow-prone areas in lieu of raised pavement markings as the latter can be easily dislodged from the road surface by snowplows. In addition to marking the road edge, delineators are used to mark ramp gores, medians, and objects near the roadway such as fire hydrants. In such areas, the height of the delineators is established based on the typical amount of snowfall the area receives, ranging from 4 feet to more than 8 feet in height in areas with extreme snow depths. 

The name &quot;delineator&quot; is also used for reflective devices attached to other objects which are technically not pavement markers.

<text>Andreas Cellarius (–1665) was a Dutch–German cartographer and cosmographer best known for his 1660 &quot;Harmonia Macrocosmica&quot;, a major star atlas.

== Life ==
He was born in Neuhausen, and was educated in Heidelberg. The Protestant Cellarius may have left Heidelberg at the onset of the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1618 or in 1622, when the city came into Catholic hands. His activities are unclear at this time, but based on his later works, it is conjectured that he spent time in Poland where he may have worked as a military engineer.

In 1625, he married Catharina Eltemans in Amsterdam, where he worked as a schoolmaster at a Latin school. After a brief stay in The Hague, the family moved to Hoorn. From 1637 until his death, he was rector of the Latin School in Hoorn, where Pieter Anthoniszoon Overtwater was conrector.

The minor planet 12618 Cellarius is named in his honour.

<text>Christoph (Keller) Cellarius (22 November 1638 – 4 June 1707) was a German classical scholar from Schmalkalden who held positions in Weimar and Halle. Although the Ancient-Medieval-Modern division of history was used earlier by Italian Renaissance scholars Leonardo Bruni and Flavio Biondo, Cellarius&#x27; &quot;Universal History Divided into an Ancient, Medieval, and New Period&quot; helped popularize it. After him, this tripartite division became standard.

The library of the University of Applied Sciences in Schmalkalden bears his name, called the &quot;Cellarius Bibliothek&quot; in his honor.

<text>August Schrader (1807–1894) was a German-American inventor and mechanic. He is known for inventing the Schrader valve.

== Life ==
Schrader immigrated from Germany to the United States and opened a shop dealing in rubber products in Manhattan, New York City. His original shop was located at 115 John Street.

In 1845, he began supplying fittings and valves for rubber products made by the Goodyear Brothers, including air pillows and life preservers. He also made daguerreotype apparatus. Then he went into partnership with Christian Baecher, a brass turner and finisher.

After watching divers at work, Schrader sought to improve diving helmets. In 1849, he created a new copper helmet. Later, his interest in diving led to him to design an air pump.

Around 1890, after reports of English cyclists&#x27; success using pneumatic tires, August Schrader saw the need for a bicycle tire valve. By 1891 he had produced the Schrader valve, which was his most popular invention and is still used today on many bicycle tires and almost all automobile, truck, and motorcycle tires. August&#x27;s son, George, is generally credited with the experimental work that resulted in the valve&#x27;s creation.

In 1893, Schrader patented the tire valve cap.

As with the introduction of the bicycle, early automobiles had solid wheels similar to those on carriages, followed by solid hard rubber. In time, tubed pneumatic tires and Schrader valves were introduced to cars, trucks, and motorcycles. Most of these ultimately went tubeless, but retained Schrader valves. For comparison, the Schrader valve can be compared with the Presta and Dunlop valves.

<text>Sir Laurens Jan van der Post, (13 December 1906 – 15 December 1996) was a South African Afrikaner writer, farmer, soldier, educator, journalist, humanitarian, philosopher, explorer and conservationist. He was noted for his interest in Jungianism and the Kalahari Bushmen, his experiences during World War II, as well as his relationships with notable figures such as King Charles III and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. After his death, there was controversy over claims that he had exaggerated many aspects of his life, as well as his sexual abuse and impregnation of a 14-year-old girl.

==Biography==
===Early years and education===
Van der Post was born in the small town of Philippolis in the Orange River Colony, the post-Boer War British name for what had previously been the Afrikaner Orange Free State in what is today South Africa. His father, Christiaan Willem Hendrik van der Post (1856–1914), a Hollander from Leiden, had emigrated to South Africa with his parents and married Johanna Lubbe in 1889. The van der Posts had a total of 13 children, with Laurens being the 13th. The fifth son, Christiaan, was a lawyer and politician who fought in the Second Boer War against the British. After the Second Boer War, Christiaan senior was exiled with his family to Stellenbosch, where Laurens was conceived. They returned to Philippolis, in the Orange River Colony, where he was born in 1906.

He spent his early childhood years on the family farm, and acquired a taste for reading from his father&#x27;s extensive library, which included Homer and Shakespeare. His father died in August 1914. In 1918, van der Post went to school at Grey College in Bloemfontein. There, he wrote, it was a great shock to him that he was &quot;being educated into something which destroyed the sense of common humanity I shared with the black people&quot;. In 1925, he took his first job as a reporter in training at &quot;The Natal Advertiser&quot; in Durban, where his reporting included his own accomplishments playing on the Durban and Natal field hockey teams. In 1926, he and two other rebellious writers, Roy Campbell and William Plomer, published a satirical magazine called &quot;Voorslag&quot; (&quot;whip lash&quot;) which criticised imperialist systems; it lasted for three issues before being forced to shut down because of its controversial views. Later that year he took off for three months with Plomer and sailed to Tokyo and back on a Japanese freighter, the &quot;Canada Maru&quot;, an experience which produced books by both authors later in life.

In 1927, van der Post met Marjorie Edith Wendt (d. 1995), daughter of the founder and conductor of the Cape Town Orchestra. The couple traveled to England and on 8 March 1928, married at Bridport, Dorset. A son was born on 26 December, named Jan Laurens (later known as John). In 1929, van der Post returned to South Africa to work for the &quot;Cape Times&quot;, a newspaper in Cape Town, where &quot;For the time being Marjorie and I are living in the most dire poverty that exists,&quot; he wrote in his journal. He began to associate with bohemians and intellectuals who were opposed to James Hertzog (Prime Minister) and the white South African policy. In an article entitled &#x27;South Africa in the Melting Pot&#x27;, which clarified his views of the South Africa racial problem, he said &quot;The white South African has never consciously believed that the native should ever become his equal.&quot; However, he predicted that &quot;the process of leveling up and inter-mixture must accelerate continually ... the future civilization of South Africa is, I believe, neither black or white but brown.&quot;

===The Bloomsbury influence===
In 1931, van der Post returned to England. His friend, Plomer, had been published by the Hogarth Press, a business run by the married couple Leonard Woolf and the novelist Virginia Woolf. The Woolfs were members of the literary and artistic Bloomsbury group, and through Plomer&#x27;s introductions, van der Post also met figures such as Arthur Waley, J. M. Keynes and E. M. Forster.

In 1934, the Woolfs published van der Post&#x27;s first novel. Called &quot;In a Province&quot;, it portrayed the tragic consequences of a racially and ideologically divided South Africa. Later that year, he decided to become a dairy farmer and, possibly with the help of the independently wealthy poet Lilian Bowes Lyon, bought Colley Farm, near Tetbury, Gloucestershire, with Lilian as his neighbor. There he divided his time between the needs of the cows and occasional visits to London, where he was a correspondent for South African newspapers. He considered this a directionless phase in his life which mirrored Europe&#x27;s slow drift to war.

In 1936, he made five trips to South Africa and during one trip he met and fell in love with Ingaret Giffard (1902–1997), an English actress and author four years his senior. In 1938 he sent his family back to South Africa. When the Second World War began in 1939, he found himself torn between England and South Africa, his new love and his family; his career was at a dead end, and he was in depressed spirits, often drinking heavily.

===War service===
In May 1940, van der Post volunteered for the British Army and upon completion of officer training in January 1941 he was sent to East Africa in the Intelligence Corps as a captain. There he took up with General Wingate&#x27;s Gideon Force which was given the task of restoring the Emperor Haile Selassie to his throne in Abyssinia. His unit led 11,000 camels through difficult mountain terrain and he was remembered for being an excellent caretaker of the animals. In March, he came down with malaria and was sent to Palestine to recover.

In early 1942, as Japanese forces invaded South East Asia, van der Post was transferred to Allied forces in the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), because of his Dutch language skills. By his own statement, he was given command of Special Mission 43, the purpose of which was to organise the covert evacuation of as many Allied personnel as possible, after the surrender of Java.

On 20 April 1942, he surrendered to the Japanese. He was taken to prison camps first at Sukabumi and then to Bandung. Van der Post was known for his work in maintaining the morale of prisoners of many different nationalities. Along with others, he organised a &quot;camp university&quot; with courses from basic literacy to degree-standard ancient history, and he also organized a camp farm to supplement nutritional needs. He could speak some basic Japanese, which helped him greatly. Once, depressed, he wrote in his diary: &quot;It is one of the hardest things in this prison life: the strain caused by being continually in the power of people who are only half-sane and live in a twilight of reason and humanity.&quot; He wrote about his prison experiences in &quot;A Bar of Shadow&quot; (1954), &quot;The Seed and the Sower&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Night of the New Moon&quot; (1970). Japanese film director Nagisa Ōshima based his film &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence&quot; (1982) on &quot;The Seed and the Sower&quot;.

Following the surrender of Japan, while his fellow POWs were repatriated, van der Post chose to remain in Java, and on 15 September 1945, he joined Admiral Wilfrid Patterson on for the official surrender of the Japanese in Java to British forces representing the Allies.

Van der Post then spent two years helping to mediate between Indonesian nationalists and members of the Dutch Colonial Government. He had gained the trust of the nationalist leaders such as Mohammad Hatta and Sukarno and warned both British Prime Minister Clement Attlee and the Allied Supreme Commander in South East Asia, Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, whom he met in London in October 1945, that the country was on the verge of blowing up. Van der Post travelled to The Hague to repeat his warning directly to the Dutch cabinet. In November 1946, British forces withdrew and van der Post became military attaché to the British consulate in Batavia. By 1947, after he had returned to England, the Indonesian Revolution had begun. That same year, van der Post retired from the army and was made a CBE. The events of these early post-war years in Java are examined in his memoir &quot;The Admiral&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1996).

===Post-war life===
With the war over and his business with the army concluded, van der Post returned to South Africa in late 1947 to work at the &quot;Natal Daily News&quot;, but with the election of the National Party and the onset of apartheid he traveled back to London. He later published a critique of apartheid (&quot;The Dark Eye in Africa&quot;, 1955), basing many of his insights on his developing interest in psychology. In May 1949, he was commissioned by the Colonial Development Corporation (CDC) to &quot;assess the livestock capacities of the uninhabited Nyika and Mulanje plateaux of Nyasaland&quot; (now part of Malawi). Around this time he divorced Marjorie, and on 13 October 1949, married Ingaret Giffard.

He went on honeymoon with Ingaret to Switzerland, where his new wife introduced him to Carl Jung. Jung was to have probably a greater influence on him than anybody else, and he later said that he had never met anyone of Jung&#x27;s stature. He continued to work on a travel book about his Nyasaland adventures called &quot;Venture to the Interior&quot;, which became an immediate best-seller in the US and Europe upon its publication in 1952.

In 1950, Lord Reith (head of the CDC) asked van der Post to head an expedition to Bechuanaland (now Botswana), to see the potential of the remote Kalahari Desert for cattle ranching. There van der Post for the first time met the hunter-gatherer people known as the Bushmen or San people. He repeated the journey to the Kalahari in 1952. In 1953, he published his third book, &quot;The Face Beside the Fire&quot;, a semi-autobiographical novel about a psychologically &quot;lost&quot; artist in search of his soul and soul-mate, which clearly shows Jung&#x27;s influence on his thinking and writing.

&quot;Flamingo Feather&quot; (1955) was an anti-communist novel in the guise of a Buchanesque adventure story, about a Soviet plot to take over South Africa. It sold very well. Alfred Hitchcock planned to film the book, but lost support from South African authorities and gave up the idea. Penguin Books kept &quot;Flamingo Feather&quot; in print until the collapse of the Soviet Union.

In 1955, the BBC commissioned van der Post to return to the Kalahari in search of the Bushmen, a journey that became a six-part television documentary series in 1956. In 1958, his best-known book was published under the same title as the BBC series: &quot;The Lost World of the Kalahari&quot;. He followed this in 1961 by &quot;The Heart of the Hunter&quot;, derived from &quot;Specimens of Bushman Folklore&quot; (1910), collected by Wilhelm Bleek and Lucy Lloyd, and &quot;Mantis and His Hunter&quot;, collected by Dorothea Bleek.

Van der Post described the Bushmen as the original natives of southern Africa, outcast and persecuted by all other races and nationalities. He said they represented the &quot;lost soul&quot; of all mankind, a type of noble savage myth. This mythos of the Bushmen inspired the colonial government to create the Central Kalahari Game Reserve in 1961 to guarantee their survival, and the reserve became a part of settled law when Botswana was created in 1966.

===Later years===
Van der Post had become a respected television personality, had introduced the world to the Kalahari Bushmen, and was considered an authority on Bushman folklore and culture. &quot;I was compelled towards the Bushmen,&quot; he said, &quot;like someone who walks in his sleep, obedient to a dream of finding in the dark what the day has denied him.&quot; Over the next fifteen years, he had a steady stream of publications, including the two books drawn from his war experiences (see above), a travel book called &quot;A Journey into Russia&quot; (1964) describing a long trip through the Soviet Union, and two novels of adventure set on the fringes of the Kalahari desert, &quot;A Story Like the Wind&quot; (1972) and its sequel &quot;A Far-Off Place&quot; (1974). The latter books, about four young people, two of them San, caught up in violent events on the borders of 1970s Rhodesia, became popular as class readers in secondary schools. In 1972, there was a BBC television series about his 12-year friendship with Jung, who died in 1961, which was followed by the book &quot;Jung and the Story of Our Time&quot; (1976).

Ingaret and he moved to Aldeburgh, Suffolk, where they became involved with a circle of friends that included an introduction to then-Prince Charles, whom he then took on a safari to Kenya in 1977 and with whom he had a close and influential friendship for the rest of his life. Also in 1977, together with Ian Player, a South African conservationist, he created the first World Wilderness Congress in Johannesburg. In 1979, his Chelsea neighbor Margaret Thatcher became prime minister, and she called on his advice with matters dealing with southern Africa, particularly the Rhodesia settlement of 1979–80. In 1981, he was given a Knighthood. He was made godfather to Prince William.

In 1982, he fell and injured his back and used the hiatus from tennis and skiing to write an autobiography called &quot;Yet Being Someone Other&quot; (1982), which discussed his love of the sea and his journey to Japan with Plomer in 1926. (His affection for that country and its people, despite his wartime experiences, had first been explored in 1968 in his book &quot;Portrait of Japan&quot;.) By now, Ingaret was slipping into senility, and he spent much time with the sculptor Frances Baruch, an old friend (who made a bust of van der Post). In 1984, his son John (who had gone on to be an engineer in London) died, and van der Post spent time with his youngest daughter Lucia and her family.
In old age, Sir Laurens van der Post was involved with many projects, from the worldwide conservationist movement, to setting up a centre of Jungian studies in Cape Town. &quot;A Walk with a White Bushman&quot; (1986), the transcript of a series of interviews, gives a taste of his appeal as a conversationalist. In 1996, he tried to prevent the eviction of the Bushmen from their homeland in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, which had been set up for that purpose, but ironically it was his work in the 1950s to promote the land for cattle ranching that led to their eventual removal. In October 1996, he published &quot;The Admiral&#x27;s Baby&quot;, describing the events in Java at the end of the war. His 90th birthday celebration was spread over five days in Colorado, with a &quot;this is your life&quot;-type event with friends from every period of his life. A few days later, on 15 December 1996, after whispering in Afrikaans &quot;die sterre&quot; (the stars), he died. The funeral took place on 20 December in London, attended by Zulu chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Prince Charles, Margaret Thatcher, and many friends and family. His ashes were buried in a special memorial garden at Philippolis on 4 April 1998. Ingaret died five months after him on 5 May 1997.

Laurens van de Post Way, built on the former Joint Services School of Intelligence site in Ashford, Kent, is named after him.

==Posthumous controversy==
After van der Post’s death a number of writers questioned the accuracy of his claims about his life. His reputation as a &quot;modern sage&quot; and &quot;guru&quot; was questioned, and journalists published examples of embellishment of the truth in his memoirs and travel books. J. D. F. Jones, in his authorised biography &quot;Storyteller: The Lives of Laurens van der Post&quot; (2001), claimed that van der Post was &quot;a fraud, a fantasist, a liar, a serial adulterer and a paternalist. He falsified his Army record and inflated his own importance at every possible opportunity.&quot; A rebuttal was published by Christopher Booker (van der Post&#x27;s &quot;ODNB&quot; biographer and friend) in &quot;The Spectator&quot;.

While conducting research for van der Post’s biography with the permission of his daughter Lucia, Jones found documents confirming that van der Post in 1953 had fathered a daughter with a 14-year-old girl named Bonnie (actress and dancer Evadne Baker), who had been entrusted to his care by her parents for a sea voyage between South Africa and England. Van der Post never acknowledged the existence of the child, nor his relationship to her, but did pay Bonnie a yearly stipend. The child, Cari Mostert, publicly came out to support Jones&#x27;s biographical account in 1996, after Van Der Post&#x27;s death.

<doc id="1280751" wikidata="Q33153" url="?curid=1280751" title="Cuyonon language">
<text>Cuyonon is a regional Bisayan language spoken on the coast of Palawan and the Cuyo Islands in the Philippines. Cuyonon had been the lingua franca (language used for communication) of the province of Palawan until recently when migration flow into the region rapidly increased. Forty-three percent of the total population of Palawan during the late 1980s spoke and used Cuyonon as a language. Later studies showed a significant decrease in the number of speakers due to an increase of Tagalog-speaking immigrants from Luzon.

The Cuyonon language is classified by the Summer Institute of Linguistics as belonging to the Central Philippine, Western Bisayan, Kuyan subgroup. The largest number of speakers lives in the Cuyo Group of Islands, which is located between northern Palawan and Panay Island.

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===
=== Vowels ===

Unlike most Philippine languages, Cuyonon only includes one close vowel. The close vowel only occurs in loanwords from Spanish, either directly or through Tagalog.

==Simple greetings==
*Good afternoon – 
*Good evening/night – 
*How are you? – 
*I&#x27;m fine/good and you? – 
*I&#x27;m just fine, by the grace of God – 
*Thank you – 
*Where are you going? – 
*What are you doing? – 
*Oh, nothing in particular. – 
*Please come in. – 
*Long time no see. –

<doc id="1280758" wikidata="Q3526763" url="?curid=1280758" title="Heim theory">
<text>Heim theory, first proposed by German physicist Burkhard Heim publicly in 1957, is an attempt to develop a theory of everything in theoretical physics. The theory claims to bridge some of the disagreements between quantum mechanics and general relativity. The theory has received little attention in the scientific literature and is regarded as being outside mainstream science but has attracted some interest in popular and fringe media.

==Development==
Heim attempted to resolve incompatibilities between quantum theory and general relativity. To meet that goal, he developed a mathematical approach based on quantizing spacetime. Others have attempted to apply Heim theory to nonconventional space propulsion and faster than light concepts, as well as the origin of dark matter.&lt;ref name=&quot;hpcc-space.de/publications&quot;&gt;List of Publications. HPCC-Space GmbH. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heim claimed that his theory yields particle masses directly from fundamental physical constants and that the resulting masses are in agreement with experiment, but this claim has not been confirmed. Heim&#x27;s theory is formulated mathematically in six or more dimensions and uses Heim&#x27;s own version of difference equations.

== Forestry railway ==
Vișeu de Sus is the terminus of a forestry railway system that extends deep into the Vaser River valley approaching the Ukrainian border. Timber is cut on the hillsides at the head of the valley and brought down by rail for cutting in the sawmill at Vișeu. The waste wood is burned in the locomotive boilers. The nearest national railway (CFR standard gauge) passenger station is at Vișeu de Jos, 4 km away, on the line 409 from Salva to Sighetu Marmației. The passenger branch to Borșa (via Vișeu de Sus itself), although closed to passengers in 2009, remains mostly intact (as of 2014) for freight.

The railway serves also for public transport between Vișeu de Sus and Paltin (terminus station for public). Trains go every day during spring and summer (from 20 June to 18 September), the departure is at 9 am. The stations on the way from Vișeu de Sus are: Novat, Novat Delta, Glimboaca, Cozia, and Paltin.

Trains may be delayed or cancelled without prior warning due to bad weather or Mountain Rescue advice.

== History ==
The town of Viseu de Sus, according to most authors of monographs, is documented from February 2, 1365 (Ketwyssou). This first mention of Vișeu de Sus as a settlement appears in the diploma of the King Louis I of Hungary. According to other authors, the settlement was documented since 1549, under the name of &quot;Vișeul Nou&quot; (The New Vișeu) or &quot;Între Râuri&quot; (Between Rivers), being situated at the confluence of the two rivers – name met until the beginning of the 20th century.

In 1373, the border of Vișeu de Sus and Borșa is marked, and in 1385 there appears Vișeu de Jos. The year 1453 is the one in which John Hunyadi, the Voivode of Transylvania and the governor of Hungary, gives Vișeu de Sus to the three knezes Ștefan, Petru Mândru, and Nan (Nașcu) and their brothers.

The evolution of the town itself starts after the year 1770, when there is established forestry centers with workers in Vişeu and Borșa – &quot;țipțeri&quot; colonists – from Spiš, brought to Vișeu by order of Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor.

In 1743, in Vișeu de Sus there are settled miners from Saxony and establishes exploitation of ores. In 1773, in Vișeu there is established a logging exploitation center, colonized with &quot;sași&quot; (Transylvanian Saxons) from Spiš.

In 1775, in Vișeu there are settled German families from Austria (Salzburg and Tyrol). Between 1776 and 1794, the first colonists from Salzkammergut come. In 1778, 25 families from Gmunden settled in the village, mostly with many children. In 1780 the first construction by the newcomers were made such as: First mill in the east side of the city; the construction of the dam above Măcârlău begins, construction which would end in 1784, year when other families from Bavaria settle in Vișeu de Sus. Jews from Galicia also settled in Vișeu de Sus in the 18th century and worked primarily in the lumber industry.

In 1788, the elementary school of the treasury in Vișeu de Sus is established, and in 1790 the dam at Făina is built, as well as the first Roman Catholic parish in Vișeu. In 1798, the first general school is open. The work of the &quot;țipțeri&quot; is materialized also with the first timber factory (built in 1809), the state store (deposit) built in 1817. Between 1809 and 1810, the new neighborhood &quot;Țipțerai&quot; is formed and populated.

The population of German and Austrian origin rose drastically and permanently, based on documents. In the 1930 census of Romania there were registered 2.753 Germans, making up 24,84% of the total population. At the census of 1977, there are 3,430 Germans in Vișeu de Sus, making up 16.97% of the total population. In 1920, the Jewish population of Vișeu de Sus was 3,912, making up 34% of the population. 

The Zipser Germans were brought to Vișeu firstly as forestry workers. At 14, boys started their work in the forest. At Valea Vaserului, the Zipsers planted spruce. They took care of nurseries, deforested forests, sent rafts on the water to Sighet, Vișeu, and Borșa, they built rafts, roads, and wooden bridges. At easier works, women would help too. The hardest and dirtiest job was cutting down the forest and clearing the spruce trunks, and the most tempting for men was rafting.

Considering the long time the workers had to spend in the forest, an establishment in Valea Vaserului was a need. The settlement on Vaser represents the closest connection with the history and tradition of today&#x27;s Zipsers. In this area several stories originated, among them: (forest&#x27;s girl), (white human), (forest&#x27;s dwarf).

The stories of this ethnic group and the memories of the elders, as well as the documents, bear witness to a hard, primitive life of these people in the past. After 1868, Magyarization affected many Zipsers, some changed their names at the time with others of Magyar resonance.

The Jewish population was also engaged in the lumber industry. Between 1918 and 1939, Jewish-owned lumber mills employed hundreds of Jews and non-Jews.

In Vișeu de Sus, the exploitation of wood has an antiquity that is confused with the antiquity of the city. Even the legend says that more than a thousand years ago, a father and his son went to cut wood from the forest. Unhappiness caused a stick to hit his son dead. In memory of his son, the father built a church on this site. Houses were later built around the church and thus a human settlement took shape, which was called, at first, &quot;Între Râuri&quot; (&quot;Between Rivers&quot;), because it stretched between the rivers Vișeu and Vaser, and then it was called Vișeu de Sus.

With the arrival of German settlers, the exploitation of forests intensified. These occupations, which brought a certain income and a different social status to the residents, in addition to their occupations as animal breeders, are becoming more and more attractive.

The wood was cut from above with axes, on gutters with water downstream, gathered in dams at Măcârlău and Făina, and from here, formed into rafts, going on the Vaser and further to Tisza. Many of the &quot;țipțieri&quot; colonists practices were followed by Romanians. At the forest, they worked all week long, except on Saturdays when they went down the valley, and sometimes for those who lived further away, the work period was extended to 2–3 months. The &quot;Butinars&quot; (forestry workers) slept in cottages called &quot;finnish&quot;, they had the fire in the middle, and the beds were arranged radially so that they could warm up more easily and dry their clothes in the winter. Today, in Valea Vaserului, the wood is transported by narrow gauge railway.

=== World War II ===
The situation of the Jews of Vișeu de Sus declined in September 1940, when Hungary took control of the region and Jews were sent to concentration camps in Hungary. During April 1944, the remaining Jewish residents of Vișeu de Sus were sent to ghettos along with the Jews of the surrounding region. Approximately 8,000 Jews were held in a ghetto near Vișeu de Sus. All the Jews were deported from area ghettos to Auschwitz in May 1944. In 1947, there were 800 Jewish survivors living in Vișeu de Sus, but by 1972 the Jewish community ceased to exist.

In 2011, a museum dedicated to the Jews of Vișeu de Sus opened at the site of the former home of Alexander Elefant, a former Jewish resident and timber factory owner. The exhibition presents the history of the Jewish community in Vișeu de Sus up until World War II when they were forcibly deported and sent to Auschwitz.

== Geography ==
Vișeu de Sus is located in the northeastern part of Maramureș County, on the border with Ukraine. The town lies at the confluence of the rivers Vișeu and Vaser, at an altitude of above sea level, having the characteristics of a mountain city. It neighbors the communes of Moisei to the southeast, Vișeu de Jos to the west, and Poienile de sub Munte to the northwest. It also borders Maramureș Mountains Natural Park to the north, and Rodna Mountains National Park to the south-east. The town administers a surface area of , making it the second-largest town by area in Romania.

=== Relief ===
The relief is mountainous, made of a plateau surrounded by hills, with the altitude varying from to at &quot;Vârful lui Dan&quot; (Dan&#x27;s Peak). The relief has a major impact on the tourism in the zone, due to its views.

Vaser is the most attractive tourist route in the Maramureș Mountains, a defile, separating on the left a few crystalline shales: Prislopașul (1,201 m), Grebeni (1594 m), Novicioru (1,452 m). It shares its border with Ukraine at .

=== Hydrography and climate ===
The river Vișeu rises under the Prislop Pass, at an altitude of and flows in the river Tisza near the commune of Bistra at an altitude of around . The river is long, and has an inclination of 2–50 m/km. Its river basin is developed, mostly, in the mountain zone (67%), which ensures a high density of the hydrographic network and a specific drainage of the highest in the country. The river Valea Vinului flows into the Vișeu in Vișeu de Mijloc.

The river Vaser rises from the Maramureș Mountains, forming from the springs &quot;Boului&quot; and &quot;Munceii Albi&quot;. It is long, and it is Vișeu&#x27;s most important tributary, with a flow higher than itself.

=== Mineral waters ===
The special value of these natural riches is given by the great qualitative and quantitative diversity of mineralizations, as well as by the therapeutic (curative) qualities. Mineral waters, due to their complex chemical composition, are natural healing factors with a special therapeutic importance. Waters containing mineral substances and carbon dioxide are waters with a high therapeutic level. The mineral springs in the area resulted from an intense circulation of hydrothermal solutions in the eruptive rocks and in the mass of crystalline rocks and Eocene sedimentary rocks. In the Maramureș Mountains Natural Park, there had been identified 20.

Other mineral waters can be found in Vișeu de Sus and Valea Vinului. Mineral springs in Valea Vinului, especially the spring known as &#x27;Gulaci&#x27;, have a mineralization of 12.7 g/L and a concentration of 2,26 g/L CO2.

=== Fauna, flora, and funga ===
Vegetation is an important element of the natural environment, as well as a factor of tourist attraction. The variety of the relief and the climate are elements that have determined a rich and varied background in the Maramureș Mountains.

The flora and vegetation represent a great importance and interest in several points of view. In an economic point of view, we mention the importance of fodder, melliferous flowers, medicine, food, decoration, etc. Among the food species, we find: strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, elderflower, cherries and edible mushrooms. Among the medicinal plants, we find: &quot;Betula pendula&quot;, &quot;Crataegus monogyna&quot;, &quot;Betonica officinalis&quot; and &quot;Pinus mugo&quot;. Some are used for their flavored content, such as: &quot;Carum carvi&quot;, &quot;Funingirus communis&quot;, &quot;Mentha&quot; species and &quot;Oxalis acetosella&quot;.

==== Fauna of alpine hollows ====
Mammals are represented by characteristic species of alpine hollows – the black goat (&quot;Rupicapra rupicapra&quot;). Although it is specific to the alpine floor, it descends mainly in winter and enters the spruce in search of food. There are only a few specimens of black goats and mountain marmots in the Maramureș Mountains Natural Park, being repopulated since 1965. Birds in the alpine zone are represented by golden eagles, water pipits, accentors and northern pintails. There are reptiles too, most notable being: common European vipers and viviparous lizards, being present in zones with calcareous rocks. At meadows, there are common frogs. There once lived other birds, such as bearded vultures, cinereous vultures and griffon vultures.

==== Fauna of forest zones ====
The fauna of the softwood forest is represented by: bears, wolves and wild boars. Bird species include: black grouse, western capercaillies, Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers, red crossbills, coal tits, ring ouzels, etc. - which are characteristic species for coniferous forests.

==== Fauna of deciduous forests ====
Includes: red deer, foxes, several marten species, squirrels, stoats, least weasels, etc. Birds in the forests are represented by wood owls, Eurasian jays, stock doves, etc. Here we also find birds of prey: Eurasian sparrowhawks, northern goshawks, common buzzards, lesser spotted eagles. There can also be found: grey partridges, common pheasants and common quails.

<text>The College Historical Society (CHS) – popularly referred to as The Hist – is a debating society at Trinity College Dublin. It was established within the college in 1770 and was inspired by the club formed by the philosopher Edmund Burke during his own time in Trinity in 1747. It holds the Guinness World Record as the &quot;world&#x27;s oldest student society&quot;.

The society occupies rooms in the Graduates&#x27; Memorial Building at Trinity College. Former members have included a number of notable Irish men and women, from republican revolutionaries Theobald Wolfe Tone, Robert Emmet, and Henry Grattan, writers Bram Stoker, Oscar Wilde, and Samuel Beckett, to founding father of the Northern Irish state Edward Carson and first President of Ireland Douglas Hyde, and – in more recent times – Government Ministers like Mary Harney (who was the first female auditor of the society) and Brian Lenihan, and modern Irish authors, such as Sally Rooney and Naoise Dolan.

As of 2024, the College Historical Society were reigning champions of the European Universities Debating Championships (EUDC).

==History==
===Foundation===
The first meeting of the College Historical Society took place on Wednesday 21 March 1770 in the Senior Common Room in Trinity College. The society took into its care the minute book of Burke&#x27;s Club, founded 1747, from which the Hist has since drawn inspiration. Its other precursor was the Historical Club, founded in 1753, of which Henry Grattan was a member. James Reid became the first auditor of the Hist later in 1770. It was a time of great change in Ireland and the Western world, at the height of the Enlightenment and before the American War of Independence and the French Revolution. From its inception, it showed itself to be at the forefront of intellectual thought in Ireland, and many of its members later went into politics. In 1782, Lawrence Parsons was elected as an MP for Dublin University at 24, having served as auditor of the Hist just the previous year.

===Restrictions and expulsions===
Theobald Wolfe Tone, later leader of the United Irishmen, was elected auditor in 1785, and Thomas Addis Emmet was a member of the committee. The society was briefly expelled from the college in 1794, but readmitted on the condition that &quot;No question of modern politics shall be debated&quot;. In 1797, the poet Thomas Moore and the nationalist Robert Emmet were elected as members. Eight members of The Hist were expelled in 1798 in the run-up to the Rebellion, and a motion was later carried condemning the rebellion, against their former auditor.

Tension between the society and the college flourished in the early nineteenth century, with the auditor being called before the provost in 1810. In 1812 the provost, Dr Thomas Elrington, objected vehemently to the question ‘Was Brutus justifiable in putting Julius Caesar to death?’. After a number of members were removed at the request of the college board, the society left the college in 1815.

===Extern Society===
The society continued from 1815 as the Extern Historical Society. Among its members at this time were Isaac Butt, a president of the society who tried unsuccessfully in 1832 to have the society readmitted, Joseph Sheridan LeFanu, Thomas Davis (a president of the society) and John Blake Dillon and many other notables of the nationalist cause. In 1843, under auditor William Connor Magee, future Archbishop of York, the society re-formed within the college after a student petition, again on the condition that no subject of current politics was debated. This provision remains in the laws of the society as a nod to the past, but the college authorities have long since ceased to restrict the subjects of the society&#x27;s debates.

===19th century===
The society continued successfully after that with many lively debates, including the motion on June 10, 1857 ‘That the Reform Bill of Lord Grey was not framed in accordance with the wants of the country’, proposed by Isaac Butt and opposed by Edward Gibson. This era was considered by many to be the high point of the society, with many of its members moving to high political positions. It was common for the Members of Parliament for Dublin University to have served on the Committee of the Hist, such as Edward Gibson and David Plunkett, who were both auditors, and Edward Carson, who was the librarian. Bram Stoker, author of Dracula, became auditor in 1872. In 1877, Charles O&#x27;Connor (judge), the last Master of the Rolls in Ireland, became auditor. In 1864 the society collected money from its members to erect statues of Edmund Burke and Oliver Goldsmith at the Front Gate of the college.

The society moved to the Graduates&#x27; Memorial Building (GMB) in 1904, which it shares with the University Philosophical Society. The college board relaxed its rules, allowing such motions as ‘That the Gaelic League is deserving of the support of every Irishman’ in 1905 and 1906.

===20th and 21st centuries===

The society continued well through the twentieth century, although the First World War hit it badly, with 136 of its former members killed. Eoin O&#x27;Mahony was elected auditor in 1930 and faced impeachment when he raised a toast to Ireland instead of the King. Eoin O&#x27;Mahony offered Lord Carson the presidency of the society in 1931, although Carson declined due to ill health, recommending that the position be offered to former gold medallist and future President of Ireland Douglas Hyde, who was elected to the position. The current president is Prof. David McConnell, a former librarian and auditor of the society and a winner of The Irish Times Debating Competition, and now chairman of &quot;The Irish Times&quot; Trust and one of Europe&#x27;s foremost geneticists.

Son of W. B. Yeats, Michael Yeats became auditor in 1944, and in that capacity organised the inaugural meeting on &#x27;The small nations&#x27;; Taoiseach Éamon de Valera and Jan Masaryk, minister for foreign affairs in the Czechoslovakian government-in-exile in London, were his main speakers. Yeats had further involvement with the society in 1969 when it proposed admitting women members. The proposal passed by a single vote; having supported it, Yeats contended that had he stayed at home on the night of the vote the society would have remained all-male.

Women had been refused membership in the society until 1969. Soon after the change in the rules, the society debated the motion &#x27;That this House reveres the memory of Mrs Pankhurst&#x27; with Rosaleen Mills participating (the motion, however, was defeated). The first female auditor, future Tánaiste Mary Harney, was elected in 1976. the society has had eleven female auditors. The society&#x27;s Bicentennial Meeting in 1970 was addressed by US Senator Edward Kennedy, at which he called the society &quot;the greatest of the school of the orators&quot; .

To mark the society&#x27;s acknowledgement as the world&#x27;s oldest student society, by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, a successful attempt to break the record for longest debate was made in October 2023, breaking 27 hours.

==Chamber debating==
The main business of the society is the weekly debates held each Wednesday night during term time. The &quot;Weekly Debate&quot; is the second of the society&#x27;s weekly meetings.
The motions debated by the society have covered several controversial issues. In 2005, over 500 people attempted to gain access to a debate on abortion which was targeted by Youth Defence protesters and a debate on euthanasia was recorded for a documentary on the pro-euthanasia group Dignitas for the Canadian Discovery Channel.

Politicians such as David Ervine, Jeffrey Donaldson and John Hume have spoken in debates on Northern Ireland. In 2005, the then Minister for Justice, Michael McDowell unveiled proposals for reform of the legal profession at a society debate on the matter. The inaugural meeting of the 236th session, in 2006, was addressed by former President of Ireland Mary Robinson.

==Competitive debating==
Before the creation of a competitive debating structure, representatives of the society were invited to speak at similar societies internationally. As early as 1932 James Auchmuty and Garrett Gill travelled to Moorhead to speak at Minnesota State University.
The society&#x27;s best debaters compete nationally and internationally against other societies in competitions, most usually of the British Parliamentary debating style with the notable exception being the Irish Times public-speaking competition. Teams representing the society have won the overall team prize in the Irish Times Debating Competition more than any other institution.

It has also competed internationally, competing at foreign Inter-Varsities and at both the World Universities Debating Championship and European Universities Debating Championships (EUDC) - the society having hosted the former in 1992. As of 2021, the society held the European record for most wins at a single European Championships, a record set following the performance of two speakers in the 2021 championships in Madrid. In the 2023 edition of EUDC, a Hist team reached the grand final and became the first entirely female team from any Irish university to do so in over a decade (with the previous all female team having been a Hist team in 2011). In 2024, Martha McKinney-Perry and Andy Cullinan became the first Hist and second Trinity Team to have won the EUDC. 

The society hosts the Trinity Women&#x27;s Open, the Robert Emmett Invitational Summer Open, and the Dean Swift Intervarsity (Trinity IV), the largest Irish Inter-varsity each year. The society also fosters development and competition within Trinity College, running workshops and internal competitions: including its Rosaleen Mills Maiden Speaker Competition, the Wolfe Tone&#x27;s&#x27;s Public Speaking Competition, Mary Harney Women and Gender Minorities Competition, and Henry Grattan&#x27;s Historical Motion Competition.

It also plays a role in providing Secondary School Level Debating, for which the librarian of the society is primarily responsible. It jointly runs the Leinster Schools&#x27; Debating Competition with the Literary and Historical Society and its own Schools&#x27; Maces. The Hist Schools&#x27; Mace is open to all Leaving Cert cycle students, while the Girls&#x27; Mace is open to all female and gender minority Leaving Cert Cycle students.

==Controversy==
In September 2020, it was reported that the society had cancelled an invitation for the author and evolutionist Richard Dawkins to address the society. In announcing the cancellation, the then auditor of the society said she had been unaware Richard Dawkins held some controversial opinions, and that the society would be rescinding his invitation as we &quot;value our members comfort above all else&quot;.

<doc id="1280779" wikidata="Q11773731" url="?curid=1280779" title="Degenerative disc disease">
<text>Degenerative disc disease (DDD) is a medical condition typically brought on by the aging process in which there are anatomic changes and possibly a loss of function of one or more intervertebral discs of the spine. DDD can take place with or without symptoms, but is typically identified once symptoms arise. The root cause is thought to be loss of soluble proteins within the fluid contained in the disc with resultant reduction of the oncotic pressure, which in turn causes loss of fluid volume. Normal downward forces cause the affected disc to lose height, and the distance between vertebrae is reduced. The anulus fibrosus, the tough outer layers of a disc, also weakens. This loss of height causes laxity of the longitudinal ligaments, which may allow anterior, posterior, or lateral shifting of the vertebral bodies, causing facet joint malalignment and arthritis; scoliosis; cervical hyperlordosis; thoracic hyperkyphosis; lumbar hyperlordosis; narrowing of the space available for the spinal tract within the vertebra (spinal stenosis); or narrowing of the space through which a spinal nerve exits (vertebral foramen stenosis) with resultant inflammation and impingement of a spinal nerve, causing a radiculopathy.

DDD can cause mild to severe pain, either acute or chronic, near the involved disc, as well as neuropathic pain if an adjacent spinal nerve root is involved. Diagnosis is suspected when typical symptoms and physical findings are present; and confirmed by x-rays of the vertebral column. Occasionally the radiologic diagnosis of &quot;disc degeneration&quot; is made incidentally when a cervical x-ray, chest x-ray, or abdominal x-ray is taken for other reasons, and the abnormalities of the vertebral column are recognized. The diagnosis of DDD is not a radiologic diagnosis, since the interpreting radiologist is not aware whether there are symptoms present or not. Typical radiographic findings include disc space narrowing, displacement of vertebral bodies, fusion of adjacent vertebral bodies, and development of bone in adjacent soft tissue (osteophyte formation). An MRI is typically reserved for those with symptoms, signs, and x-ray findings suggesting the need for surgical intervention.

Treatment may include physical therapy for pain relief, ROM (range of motion), and appropriate muscle/strength training with emphasis on correcting abnormal posture, assisting the paravertebral (paraspinous) muscles in stabilizing the spine, and core muscle strengthening; stretching exercises; massage therapy; oral analgesia with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS); and topical analgesia with lidocaine, ice and heat. Immediate surgery may be indicated if the symptoms are severe or sudden in onset, or there is a sudden worsening of symptoms. Elective surgery may be indicated after six months of conservative therapy with unsatisfactory relief of symptoms.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Degenerative disc disease can result in lower back or upper neck pain. The amount of degeneration does not correlate well with the amount of pain patients experience. Many people experience no pain while others, with the same amount of damage have severe, chronic pain. Whether a patient experiences pain or not largely depends on the location of the affected disc and the amount of pressure that is being put on the spinal column and surrounding nerve roots.

Degenerative disc disease is one of the most common sources of back pain and affects approximately 30 million people every year. With symptomatic degenerative disc disease, the pain can vary depending on the location of the affected disc. A degenerated disc in the lower back can result in lower back pain, sometimes radiating to the hips, and pain in the buttocks, thighs, or legs. If pressure is being placed on the nerves by exposed nucleus pulposus, sporadic tingling or weakness through the knees and legs can occur.

A degenerated disc in the upper neck will often result in pain to the neck, arm, shoulders and hands; tingling in the fingers may also result if nerve impingement is occurring. Pain is most commonly felt or worsened by movements such as sitting, bending, lifting, and twisting.

After an injury, some discs become painful because of inflammation and the pain comes and goes. Some people have nerve endings that penetrate more deeply into the anulus fibrosus (outer layer of the disc) than others, making discs more likely to generate pain. The healing of trauma to the outer anulus fibrosus may also result in the innervation of the scar tissue and pain impulses from the disc, as these nerves become inflamed by nucleus pulposus material. Degenerative disc disease can lead to a chronic debilitating condition and can reduce a person&#x27;s quality of life. When pain from degenerative disc disease is severe, traditional nonoperative treatment may be ineffective.

== Cause ==
There is a disc between each of the vertebrae in the spine. A healthy, well-hydrated disc will contain a great deal of water in its center, known as the nucleus pulposus, which provides cushioning and flexibility for the spine. Much of the mechanical stress that is caused by everyday movements is transferred to the discs within the spine and the water content within them allows them to effectively absorb the shock. At birth, a typical human nucleus pulposus will contain about 80% water. However natural daily stresses and minor injuries can cause these discs to gradually lose water as the annulus fibrosus, or the tough outer fibrous material of a disc, weakens. Because degenerative disc disease is largely due to natural daily stresses, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Manual Physical Therapists have suggested it is not truly a &quot;disease&quot; process.

This water loss makes the discs more flexible and results in the gradual collapse and narrowing of the gap in the spinal column. As the space between vertebrae gets smaller, extra pressure can be placed on the discs causing tiny cracks or tears to appear in the annulus. If enough pressure is exerted, it is possible for the nucleus pulposus material to seep out through the tears in the annulus and can cause what is known as a herniated disc.

As the two vertebrae above and below the affected disc begin to collapse upon each other, the facet joints at the back of the spine are forced to shift which can affect their function.

Additionally, the body can react to the closing gap between vertebrae by creating bone spurs around the disc space in an attempt to stop excess motion. This can cause issues if the bone spurs start to grow into the spinal canal and put pressure on the spinal cord and surrounding nerve roots as it can cause pain and affect nerve function. This condition is called spinal stenosis.

For women, there is evidence that menopause and related estrogen-loss are associated with lumbar disc degeneration, usually occurring during the first 15 years of the climacteric. The potential role of sex hormones in the etiology of degenerative skeletal disorders is being discussed for both genders.

Mutations in several genes have been implicated in intervertebral disc degeneration. Probable candidate genes include type I collagen (sp1 site), type IX collagen, vitamin D receptor, aggrecan, asporin, MMP3, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6 polymorphisms. Mutation in genes – such as MMP2 and THBS2 – that encode for proteins and enzymes involved in the regulation of the extracellular matrix has been shown to contribute to lumbar disc herniation.

== Mechanisms ==

Degenerative discs typically show degenerative fibrocartilage and clusters of chondrocytes, suggestive of repair. Inflammation may or may not be present. Histologic examination of disc fragments resected for presumed DDD is routine to exclude malignancy.

Fibrocartilage replaces the gelatinous mucoid material of the nucleus pulposus as the disc changes with age. There may be splits in the anulus fibrosus, permitting herniation of elements of nucleus pulposus. There may also be shrinkage of the nucleus pulposus that produces prolapse or folding of the anulus fibrosus with secondary osteophyte formation at the margins of the adjacent vertebral body. The pathologic findings in DDD include protrusion, spondylolysis, and subluxation of vertebrae (spondylolisthesis) and spinal stenosis. It has been hypothesized that &quot;Cutibacterium acnes&quot; may play a role.

SASP (senescence-associated secretory phenotype) due to IL-1 (p16INK4a) senescence can be responsible for DDD. In DDD, SASP is secreted by nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus]] cells, resulting in extracellular matrix degradation and extracellular inflammation.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis of degenerative disc disease will usually consist of an analysis of a patient&#x27;s individual medical history and an MRI to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other causes.

== Treatment ==
Often, the symptoms of degenerative disc disease can be treated without surgery. One or a combination of treatments such as physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, traction, or epidural steroid injection can provide adequate relief of troubling symptoms.

Surgery may be recommended if the conservative treatment options do not provide relief within two to three months for cervical or 6 months for lumbar symptoms. If leg or back pain limits normal activity, if there is weakness or numbness in the legs, if it is difficult to walk or stand, or if medication or physical therapy are ineffective, surgery may be necessary, most often spinal fusion. There are many surgical options for the treatment of degenerative disc disease, including anterior and posterior approaches. The most common surgical treatments include:

Traditional approaches in treating patients with DDD-resultant herniated discs oftentimes include discectomy—which, in essence, is a spine-related surgical procedure involving the removal of damaged intervertebral discs (either whole removal, or partially-based). The former of these two discectomy techniques involved in open discectomy is known as Subtotal Discectomy (SD; or, aggressive discectomy) and the latter, Limited Discectomy (LD; or, conservative discectomy). However, with either technique, the probability of post-operative reherniation exists and at a considerably high maximum of 21%, prompting patients to potentially undergo recurrent disk surgery.

New treatments are emerging that are still in the beginning clinical trial phases. Glucosamine injections may offer pain relief for some without precluding the use of more aggressive treatment options. Adult stem cell or cell transplantation therapies for disc regeneration are in their infancy of development, but initial clinical trials have shown cell transplantation to be safe and initial observations suggest some beneficial effects for associated pain and disability. An optimal cell type, transplantation method, cell density, carrier, or patient indication remains to be determined. Investigation into mesenchymal stem cell therapy knife-less fusion of vertebrae in the United States began in 2006 and a DiscGenics nucleus pulposus progenitor cell transplantation clinical trial has started as of 2018 in the United States and Japan.

Researchers and surgeons have conducted clinical and basic science studies to uncover the regenerative capacity possessed by the large animal species involved (humans and quadrupeds) for potential therapies to treat the disease. Some therapies, carried out by research laboratories in New York, include introduction of biologically engineered, injectable riboflavin cross-linked high density collagen (HDC-laden) gels into disease spinal segments to induce regeneration, ultimately restoring functionality and structure to the two main inner and outer components of vertebral discs—anulus fibrosus and the nucleus pulposus.

==Other animals==
Degenerative disc disease can occur in other mammals besides humans. It is a common problem in several dog breeds, such as the Dachshund, and attempts to remove this disease from dog populations have led to several hybrid breeds, such as the Chiweenie.

<text>Paul Smith is probably best known as the founder and manager of Blast First, the British alternative record label that released artists such as Sonic Youth, the Butthole Surfers, Big Black and Dinosaur Jr. in the UK. He continued to manage the artists and work in the music industry when Blast First was bought by Mute Records. Now he runs the very small label &quot;Blast First Petite&quot; on which he develops and sometime releases stuff that was refused by Mute&#x27;s Blast First, including Rivulets and HTRK. He now has an exclusive contract with Pan Sonic.
In 2002 he produced a multimedia performance event at the Barbican to mark the release of Iain Sinclair&#x27;s book &quot;London Orbital&quot;. The event featured a diverse range of artists from the literary and music worlds including J. G. Ballard and Bill Drummond. 

Paul Smith also produced the final British tour of Ken Kesey, taking him on a bus tour around festivals in summer 1997. He is also known for King Mob, a record label of spoken word performances by famous counter-culture authors from the beat generation to Iain Sinclair and Stewart Home.

<text>The Fall of the Angels is a Miltonesque epic poem by John William Polidori concerned with the creation of the world.

It was published anonymously in 1821 only months before Polidori&#x27;s death. The only known contemporary review of the poem was a negative one, published on 5 May 1821. After Polidori&#x27;s death, a version of the poem with his name on the title page was published.

<doc id="1280789" wikidata="Q676709" url="?curid=1280789" title="Armagh Observatory">
<text>Armagh Observatory is an astronomical research institute in Armagh, Northern Ireland. Around 25 astronomers are based at the observatory, studying stellar astrophysics, the Sun, Solar System astronomy and Earth&#x27;s climate.

In 2018, Armagh Observatory was recognized for having 224 years of unbroken weather records.

==History==
The Observatory is located close to the centre of the city of Armagh, adjacent to the Armagh Planetarium in approximately of landscaped grounds known as the Armagh Astropark. It was founded in 1789 by The Most Rev. and Rt Hon. The 1st Baron Rokeby, Church of Ireland Lord Primate of All Ireland and Lord Archbishop of Armagh.

In 1795 through 1797 Solar observations were made at Armagh, including measurements of sunspots.

Ernst Julius Öpik (grandfather of Lembit Öpik MP) was based here for over 30 years and among his many contributions to astrophysics he wrote of the dangers of an asteroid impacting on the Earth.

One of the observatory&#x27;s directors, Thomas Romney Robinson invented the cup anemometer, a device for measuring wind speed.

A plan was announced in 1949 to establish an Armagh Planetarium. After many years work the Planetarium opened in 1968, its first director was Patrick Moore. It celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2018.

In 2018, the observatory was given an award by Centennial Weather Station Award from the World Meteorological Organisation for 224 years of unbroken weather recordings. The records go back to 1794 and are also made available on the internet in the early 21st century.

In modern times the Observatory along with the nearby Planetarium and 14-acre Astropark are noted tourist attraction and education centre. The gardens, historical telescopes, and various astronomically related devices such as sundials are among some of the exhibits for visitors.

==Facilities==
There are scale models of the Solar System and the Universe, two sundials and historic telescopes, as well as telescope domes and other outdoor exhibits. The Human Orrery, launched in 2004, is located close to the main Observatory building. The Observatory&#x27;s specialist library and archives, and collections of scientific instruments and artefacts associated with the development of modern astronomy, represent one of the leading collections of its kind in the British Isles.

== Instruments ==

A 2½ inch aperture refracting telescope by J &amp; E Troughton was installed in a dome in 1795. The telescope was manufactured in London, and is noted for its late 18th century brass metal work. It is also known the Troughton Equatorial Telescope, for having an equatorial mounting.

The observatory has an Earnshaw Regulator. It is an accurate type of clock invented in 1791 by Thomas Earnshaw. Earnshaw travelled with it to Armagh to set it up in the new Observatory.

In the early 1800s it was reported to have a mural circle instrument. Another instrument at the observatory is a sunshine recorder.

In the 1830s the observatory bought a 15-inch reflecting telescope from the Grubb Telescope Company. The telescope used a speculum metal mirror mounted on an equatorial mount with clockwork-drive.

In 1885, a ten-inch aperture refracting telescope was installed, also by Grubb. This was installed in the Robinson dome.

Meridian marks can be found in the vicinity of the observatory, these look like stone arches, but were used to mark the location of the north-south line for the astronomical instruments. There is also another one in the form of an iron obelisk. The first meridian mark was built in 1793, and is in Tullyard, and it was used with the transit instrument.

In 2005, two wide-angle cameras for a meteor detection systems were installed.

==Research==
The records of temperature take at Armagh Observatory between 1844 and 2004 were analyzed in 2006 research paper.

<doc id="1280793" wikidata="Q29031" url="?curid=1280793" title="Charles Oman">
<text>Sir Charles William Chadwick Oman, (12 January 1860 – 23 June 1946) was a British military historian. His reconstructions of medieval battles from the fragmentary and distorted accounts left by chroniclers were pioneering. 

==Early life==
Oman was born in Muzaffarpur district, India, the son of a British planter, and was educated at Winchester College and at the University of Oxford, where he studied under William Stubbs. Here, he was invited to become a founding member of the Stubbs Society, which was under Stubbs&#x27;s patronage.

==Career==
In 1881 he was elected to a Prize Fellowship at All Souls College, where he remained for the rest of his academic career. He was elected the Chichele Professor of Modern History at Oxford in 1905, in succession to Montagu Burrows. He was also elected to the FBA that year, and served as president of the Royal Historical Society (1917–1921), the Numismatic Society and the Royal Archaeological Institute.

Among his teaching activities at Oxford, he taught the special subject in military history with C. T. Atkinson of Exeter College that focused on the Peninsular War.

Oman&#x27;s academic career was interrupted by the First World War, during which he was employed by the government&#x27;s Press Bureau and the Foreign Office.

Oman was the Conservative Member of Parliament for the University of Oxford constituency from 1919 to 1935, and was knighted KBE in the 1920 civilian war honours list.

The parody history book &quot;1066 and All That&quot;, published in 1930, includes the dedication &quot;Absit Oman&quot;, a distortion of the Latin phrase &quot;Absit omen&quot;. It can be translated as &quot;may Oman be absent&quot;, reflecting the prominence of Oman among English historians at the time.

==Honours==
He became an honorary fellow of New College in 1936, and received the honorary degrees of DCL (Oxford, 1926) and LL.D (Edinburgh, 1911 and Cambridge, 1927). He was awarded the Medal of the Royal Numismatic Society in 1928. He died at Oxford aged 86.

==Children==
Two of Oman&#x27;s children became authors. His daughter Carola Oman CBE was a writer of history, biography, and fiction for adults and children, including a retelling of the Robin Hood legend and biographies of Admiral Lord Nelson and Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore. His son Charles C. Oman wrote several volumes on British silverware and similar houseware, worked as a Keeper of the Department of Metalwork in the Victoria and Albert Museum, and was active in the Folklore Society (and was in turn father to Julia Trevelyan Oman).

<doc id="1280800" wikidata="Q62991" url="?curid=1280800" title="Ernst Bernheim">
<text>Ernst Bernheim (19 February 1850 – 9 July 1942) was a German historian who is best known for an influential &quot;Lehrbuch der historischen Methode&quot; (1889) on historical method.

==Early life==
He was born in Hamburg as a son of merchant Louis Bernheim (later changed to Ludwig Bernheim, born 7 December 1815 in Fürstenberg) and Emma Simon (born 15 April 1834 in Kolberg) and from 1834 lived in Hamburg.

On 16 April 1884, he married Amalie (&quot;Emma&quot;) Henriette Jessen (born 18 September 1861 in Hamburg, died 9 July 1945 in Greifswald). They had a daughter and three sons.

==Career==
Ernst attended the Johanneum from Easter 1862 and graduated with the Abitur on 22 September 1868. From 1868 to 1872, he studied history in Berlin, Heidelberg, and Straßburg He graduated with the grades Dr. phil and Dr jur. in Straßburg (1873, supervised by Georg Waitz) and Dr habil in Göttingen (1874–75, supervised by Julius Weizsäcker). Thereafter, he taught history at the University of Göttingen and at the University of Bonn.

In 1883, he was called to the University of Greifswald, Institute for History, where he held the positions of an &quot;außerordentlicher Professor&quot; (&quot;Privatdozent&quot;) since 1883, and &quot;ordentlicher Professor&quot; since 1889. In 1899, he was elected rector of the university. His eremitation was in 1921.

==Nazi era==
His Jewish descent made Bernheim subject to repressions during the Nazi era. In 1933, he was forbidden to lecture, and an appeal to Adolf Hitler to regain that permission was not successful. On 4 December 1935, with the implementation of the Nuremberg Laws, Bernheim lost German citizenship. An appeal to Hitler to regain citizenship, which was backed by a number of scientists from the University of Greifswald was successful, and Bernheim was assigned &quot;temporary citizenship&quot; on 12 January 1938 and let him avoid deportation in 1940. Yet, just weeks before his death, the deaf-mute foster child of the family, Hetti Meyer, was deported to Theresienstadt and killed. Hetti was raised from her birth by Bernheim and his wife Emma, a special education teacher. From 1939 onwards, Nazi scientists systematically besmirched Bernheim&#x27;s scientific work, which was not appreciated again until postwar Germany.

Bernheim died on 3 March 1942 in Greifswald. His former colleagues managed to circumvent Nazi orders and to get his urn buried in the town&#x27;s graveyard on 23 July 1943, but an obituary was not permitted.

==Legacy==
A memorial plaque was attached to his Greifswald house, at 26 Arndtstraße. Furthermore, a street in Greifswald was named after him.

<doc id="1280806" wikidata="Q5295105" url="?curid=1280806" title="Donald S. Lopez Sr.">
<text>Donald Sewell Lopez Sr. (July 15, 1923 – March 3, 2008) was a United States Army Air Forces and United States Air Force fighter and test pilot and until his death the deputy director of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.

==Early life==
Lopez was born in Brooklyn, New York on July 15, 1923. He showed an interest in aviation at an early age. He often rode his bike to Floyd Bennett Field where he occasionally got free flights from a family friend. During his teenage years, his family moved to Tampa, Florida, inside the traffic pattern of Drew Army Air Field, so he could see Army Air Corps fighters flying overhead. That hardened his resolve to become a fighter pilot.

==Military career==
Lopez learned to fly in college, then volunteered for the Army Air Forces Aviation Cadet Program when the age limit was lowered to 18 in early 1942.

===World War II===
After earning his wings, he saw combat in China as a member of the 75th Fighter Squadron. The unit was part of the 23rd Fighter Group, successor to the famed Flying Tigers. He became an ace, credited with shooting down five Japanese fighters, four in a P-40 Warhawk and one in a P-51 Mustang, while flying 101 missions.

===Post war===
Lopez returned to Florida in 1945 and served as a fighter test pilot at Eglin Field, flying most of the early jet fighters. He served a brief tour of duty in the Korea War in August and September 1950 as an F-86 Sabre pilot with the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing. After Korea, he served two tours in the Pentagon, earned a B.S. and M.S. in aeronautical engineering, and was an associate professor of thermodynamics at the United States Air Force Academy, until his retirement from the Air Force in 1964.

==Personal life==
In 1948 he married Glindel Barron, sister of Florida State Senator Dempsey Barron. He and Glindel have two children, Joy Lopez and Donald S. Lopez Jr. (currently a professor of Buddhist studies at the University of Michigan), and one grandchild, Laura V. Lopez.

==Later life==
Following his retirement from the Air Force in 1964, he spent eight years as an engineer on the Apollo and Skylab programs with Bellcomm, Inc., a subsidiary of Bell Labs. In 1972, he joined the staff of the National Air and Space Museum. He was heavily involved in developing and running the National Air and Space Museum, during his later years.

His publications include two memoirs, &quot;Into the Teeth of the Tiger&quot; (Smithsonian, 1997, ), and &quot;Fighter Pilot&#x27;s Heaven: Flight Testing the Early Jets&quot; (Smithsonian, 2001, ).

Lopez died from a heart attack on March 3, 2008, at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, near to where his daughter lived. He is buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.

==Awards and decorations==
His awards and decorations include:

<doc id="1280808" wikidata="Q1340699" url="?curid=1280808" title="Victor Pinchuk">
<text>Victor Mykhailovych Pinchuk (; born 14 December 1960) is a Ukrainian businessman and oligarch. As of January 2016, &quot;Forbes magazine&quot; ranked him as 1,250th on the list of wealthiest people in the world, with a fortune of US$1.44 billion.

Pinchuk is the founder of EastOne Group LLC, an international investing, project funding and financial advisory company based in London, and of Interpipe Group, one of Ukraine&#x27;s leading pipe, wheel and steel producers. Pinchuk is the owner of four TV channels and a popular tabloid, &quot;Fakty i Kommentarii&quot;. He has been a member of the Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, for two consecutive terms from 1998 to 2006. He is married to Olena Pinchuk, the daughter of former Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma.

==Early life and education==
Pinchuk was born in 1960 in Kyiv to Jewish parents who moved to the industrial city of Dnipropetrovsk. in 1987, he graduated from Dnipropetrovsk Metallurgical Institute with a doctorate in industrial engineering. 

==Career==
In 1990, he founded the Interpipe Company on the basis of his patented innovations, which were adopted by leading metallurgical factories in the USSR.

Interpipe is a major producer of seamless pipes and railway wheels. In 2004, Pinchuk and Rinat Akhmetov, two of Ukraine&#x27;s richest men, acquired the Kryvorizhstal steel factory for about $800 million. Then-President Leonid Kuchma, who is Pinchuk&#x27;s father-in-law, authorized the state asset sale, which competitors complained was far below market rate. Later, the first Tymoshenko government reversed this sale, and held a nationally televised repeat auction that netted $4.8 billion. In 2006, Pinchuk founded an investment advisory company, EastOne. Its portfolio includes industrial assets such as production of pipes and tubes, rail car wheels, specialty steels and alloys, machinery, as well as media.

Pinchuk was a member of the Ukrainian Parliament between 1998 and 2006 for Labour Ukraine. He left politics after he came to the conclusion that Ukraine had reached a level of development when business and politics should be separated.

Pinchuk is a member of the Board of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, of the International Advisory Council of Brookings Institution and of the Corporate Advisory Board of the Global Business Coalition against HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria. Pinchuk holds a share of VS Energy International Ukraine together with Mikhail Spektor and Igor Kolomoisky.

In 2013, American steel makers filed a case with the United States Department of Commerce alleging that Interpipe Group was illegally dumping steel tubes into the American natural gas market. In November 2013, Fitch Ratings downgraded Interpipe because of the dumping accusations and a missed $106 million debt payment.

=== Accusations of corruption ===
On 4 March 2015, at the hearing on Special Control Commission of Privatization in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, oligarch Igor Kolomoisky accused Viktor Pinchuk of receiving a bribe of $5 million a month for the rights to manage Ukrnafta, 50 + 1% of which is owned by the state-owned company Naftogaz of Ukraine. According to Kolomoisky, the money was transferred to offshore companies, the &quot;ultimate owners of which were identified&quot; as Victor Pinchuk and Leonid Kuchma.

&quot;We paid this money, and besides that, we paid dividends to the state, all taxes and everything else. But for the right to receive our dividends, we were forced to pay another 5 million from our dividends to Pinchuk&quot;, - said Kolomoisky.

On 18 March 2015, National Anti-Corruption Bureau opened criminal proceedings. According to the investigation, the amount of the bribe to Viktor Pinchuk from 2003 to 2006 was allegedly $110 million.

In December 2015, Pinchuk brought a $2 billion civil action against fellow oligarch Ihor Kolomoyskyi and Gennadiy Bogolyubov in the High Court of Justice in London over the 2004 purchase of a Ukrainian mining company. Allegations made include murder and bribery. In January 2016, an undisclosed out of court settlement was reached just before the trial was due to start.

===Promoting Ukraine to join the European Union===
In 2004, Pinchuk created Yalta European Strategy, an international independent organization to promote Ukraine joining the European Union. Its annual summer meeting in Yalta was a Ukraine-EU forum for debate and policy recommendations development. Since the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation these meetings have been taking place in Kyiv. In September 2013, Pinchuk and Tony Blair introduced Hillary Clinton&#x27;s keynote address to the conference at Livadia Palace, with Bill Clinton in attendance. Stefan Fule, Paul Krugman, Alexei Kudrin, Shimon Peres, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Larry Summers and other political and business leaders have attended. In September 2015, Pinchuk donated $150,000 to the Donald J. Trump Foundation in exchange for a 20-minute video appearance by Donald Trump shown at the conference that year in Kyiv. Michael Cohen solicited Douglas Schoen for the donation from Pinchuk, which was the largest outside donation the Trump Foundation received that year.

In 2015, Pinchuk promoted closer ties between Ukraine and the EU. He was an active participant in the World Economic Forum at Davos.
In December 2016, Viktor Pinchuk published an article in the Wall Street Journal &quot;Ukraine Must Make Painful Compromises for Peace With Russia&quot;, in which he suggested that Ukraine temporarily abandon the prospect of EU membership, exclude NATO membership and make a compromise with Russia on the Crimea peninsula on purpose the achieving peace in Eastern Ukraine. The article drew criticism from Ukrainian political authorities of Ukraine. Then-President Petro Poroshenko canceled a visit to the Davos Ukrainian Lunch, which took place on January 19, 2017.

Former Vice-Prime-Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration of Ukraine Ivanna Klimpush-Tsintsadze said that the theses of Pinchuk&#x27;s &quot;peace plan&quot; had already been used by Russian propaganda.
Russia&#x27;s War Crimes House, formerly Russia House, is building 68, Promenade in Davos rented by Pinchuk, where he informs about Ukrainian civilian war deaths.

==Personal life and wealth==

Victor Pinchuk is married to Olena Pinchuk, the daughter of the second president of Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma. Olena Pinchuk runs the ANTIAIDS Foundation, which focuses on prevention and retroviral distribution and AIDS care in Ukraine. She and Pinchuk are friends of singer Elton John and former US President Bill Clinton, whose 65th birthday party Pinchuk attended in Los Angeles. Victor Pinchuk has three daughters and a son.

Pinchuk spent more than $6 million on his 50th birthday party in Courchevel, flying in Cirque du Soleil and chef Alain Ducasse.

Forbes ranked him No. 1,250 on the list of the wealthiest people in the world in 2016, with a fortune of US$1.44 billion. Pinchuk was listed as one of the &quot;2010 Time 100 – The World&#x27;s Most Influential People&quot; in &quot;Time Magazine&quot;. He was ranked No. 38 on ArtReview magazine&#x27;s 2013 Power 100 ranking of people in contemporary art.

==Philanthropy==
Pinchuk has supported philanthropic projects in Ukraine. In 2006, he consolidated these activities under the Victor Pinchuk Foundation, as of 2013 considered the largest private Ukrainian philanthropic foundation. The foundation is active in the fields of health, education, culture, international affairs, human rights and local communities.

The foundation&#x27;s projects include the largest private scholarship program in Ukraine &quot;Zavtra.UA&quot;, the scholarship program for Ukrainian students studying abroad &quot;WorldWideStudies&quot;, and the annual &quot;Ukrainian Lunch&quot; and &quot;Philanthropic Roundtable&quot; on the occasion of the World Economic Forum in Davos. The foundation supports and works with a variety of partners, including the network &quot;Yalta European Strategy&quot; created to promote Ukraine&#x27;s European integration, the Clinton Global Initiative, the Kyiv School of Economics, Tony Blair Faith Foundation, the Brookings Institution, the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the Israeli Presidential Conference &quot;Facing Tomorrow&quot;, and the legal clinics/legal aid projects of the Renaissance Foundation.

Its projects include giving $150,000 to the Trump Foundation as speaking fee in 2015, the creation of a network of modern neonatal centres throughout Ukraine (&quot;Cradles of Hope&quot;), cooperation programs with the Clinton Global Initiative, the Elton John AIDS Foundation and the ANTIAIDS Foundation of his wife Olena Pinchuk, the creation of the Kyiv School of Economics, a cooperation with the Aspen Institute, the opening of the first large scale contemporary art centre in Ukraine PinchukArtCentre, the production and promotion of a film with Steven Spielberg on the Holocaust in Ukraine, and support of local Jewish communities.

In June 2009, Pinchuk organized the Paul McCartney free concert on Independence Square in Kyiv in front of 500,000 people. As an initiative of the &quot;Pinchuk Art Center&quot;, in December 2009, Pinchuk announced a new $100,000 prize for artists under the age of 35. The &quot;Future Generation Art Prize&quot; is awarded every two years and is open to any young artist who applies online. Damien Hirst, Takashi Murakami, Andreas Gursky and Jeff Koons, artists whose work Pinchuk collects, serve as mentors to the finalists and the winner.

In February 2013, Pinchuk committed to giving half or more of his fortune during his lifetime and beyond to philanthropic causes, joining the Giving Pledge, a philanthropic initiative founded in 2010 by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.

Pinchuk has donated from $10 to $25 million to the Clinton Foundation between 1994 and 2005. In 2000, Pinchuk hired former Clinton pollster Douglas Schoen on a $40,000 per month retainer. In 2004, Schoen introduced Pinchuk to Hillary Clinton. Between September 2011 and November 2012, Schoen arranged nearly a dozen meetings between Pinchuk and senior State Department officials, including Melanne Verveer. Emails released by Judicial Watch and obtained through FOIA requests showed that Pinchuk had been invited to dine at Hillary Clinton&#x27;s home during her tenure at the State department, despite her spokesman&#x27;s previous denial that they had met during that time. In March 2017, former Trump aid Monica Crowley registered as a foreign agent for Pinchuk.

In November 2014 in Kyiv, Pinchuk was presented with the 2014 Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky Award for his work in fostering Ukrainian-Jewish relations.

In June 2022 Pinchuk and his wife donated over £10 million to charity to support Ukrainian soldiers and civilians needing prosthetics, medical treatment, rehabilitation and other humanitarian aid for Ukrainians in the Russo-Ukrainian War. This was through the sale of a Jeff Koons sculpture.

<text>Johann Jakob Brucker (; ; 22 January 1696 – 26 November 1770) was a German historian of philosophy.

==Life==

He was born at Augsburg. He was destined for the Lutheran Church, and graduated at the University of Jena in 1718. He returned to Augsburg in 1720, but became parish minister of Kaufbeuren in 1723.
In 1731 he was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences at Berlin, and was invited to return again to Augsburg as pastor and senior minister of the Church of St. Ulrich.

He died at Augsburg.

==Works==

His chief work, &quot;Historia Critica Philosophiae&quot; (&quot;Critical History of Philosophy&quot;), appeared at Leipzig (originally 5 volumes, 1742–1744). Its success was such that a new edition was published in six volumes (1766–1767; English translation by William Enfield, 1791). It is primarily by this work alone that Brucker is now known, and was the modern era&#x27;s first complete history of the different philosophical schools. It embodies an ample collection of materials, and contains valuable biographies. Schopenhauer in his advice to read the original writings of philosophers, praised Brucker. He wrote that &quot;Their real study demands all of a long and studious life, such as the stout-hearted Brucker formerly devoted to them in the industrious times of old (&quot;Parerga and Paralipomena&quot;, Volume 1, &quot;Fragments for the History of Philosophy,&quot; § 1).&quot;

He also wrote &quot;Tentamen Introductionis in Historiam Doctrinae de Ideis&quot;, afterwards completed and republished under the title of &quot;Historia Philosophicae Doctrinae de Ideis&quot; (Augsburg, 1723); &quot;Otium Vindelicum&quot; (1731); &quot;Kurze Fragen aus der philosophischen Historiae&quot; (7 volumes, Ulm, 1731–1736), a history of philosophy in question and answer, containing many details, especially in the department of literary history, which he omitted in his chief work; &quot;Pinacotheca Scriptorum nostra aetate literis illustrium&quot;, etc. (Augsburg, 1741–1755); &quot;Ehrentempel der deutschen Gelehrsamkeit&quot; (Augsburg, 1747–1749); &quot;Institutiones Historiae Philosophicae&quot; (Leipzig, 1747 and 1756; 3rd edition with a continuation by F. G. B. Born (1743–1807) of Leipzig, in 1790); &quot;Miscellanea Historiae Philosophicae Literariae Criticae olim sparsim edita&quot; (Augsburg, 1748); &quot;Erste Anfangsgründe der philosophischen Geschichte&quot; (Ulm, 1751). He superintended an edition of Martin Luther&#x27;s translation of the Old and New Testament, with a commentary extracted from the writings of the English theologians (Leipzig, 1758–1770, completed by V. A. Teller).

<text>An Alexanderson alternator is a rotating machine, developed by Ernst Alexanderson beginning in 1904, for the generation of high-frequency alternating current for use as a radio transmitter. It was one of the first devices capable of generating the continuous radio waves needed for transmission of amplitude modulated (AM) signals by radio. It was used from about 1910 in a few &quot;superpower&quot; longwave radiotelegraphy stations to transmit transoceanic message traffic by Morse code to similar stations all over the world.

Although superseded in the early 1920s by the development of vacuum-tube transmitters, the Alexanderson alternator continued to be used until World War II. It is on the list of IEEE Milestones as a key achievement in electrical engineering.

== History ==

=== Prior developments ===

After radio waves were discovered in 1887, the first generation of radio transmitters, the spark gap transmitters, produced strings of &quot;damped waves&quot;, pulses of radio waves which died out to zero quickly. By the 1890s it was realized that damped waves had disadvantages; their energy was spread over a broad frequency band so transmitters on different frequencies interfered with each other, and they could not be modulated with an audio signal to transmit sound. Efforts were made to invent transmitters that would produce &quot;continuous waves&quot;a sinusoidal alternating current at a single frequency.

In an 1891 lecture, Frederick Thomas Trouton pointed out that, if an electrical alternator were run at a great enough cycle speed (that is, if it turned fast enough and was built with a large enough number of magnetic poles on its armature) it would generate continuous waves at radio frequency. Starting with Elihu Thomson in 1889, a series of researchers built high frequency alternators, Nikola Tesla (1891, 15 kHz), Salomons and Pyke (1891, 9 kHz), Parsons and Ewing (1892, 14 kHz.), Siemens (5 kHz), B. G. Lamme (1902, 10 kHz), but none was able to reach the frequencies required for radio transmission, above 20 kHz.

=== Construction ===
In 1904, Reginald Fessenden contracted with General Electric for an alternator that generated a frequency of 100,000 hertz for continuous wave radio. The alternator was designed by Ernst Alexanderson. The Alexanderson alternator was extensively used for long-wave radio communications by shore stations, but was too large and heavy to be installed on most ships. In 1906 the first 50-kilowatt alternators were delivered. One went to Reginald Fessenden at Brant Rock, Massachusetts, another to John Hays Hammond, Jr. in Gloucester, Massachusetts and another to the American Marconi Company in New Brunswick, New Jersey.

Alexanderson would receive a patent in 1911 for his device. The Alexanderson alternator followed Fessenden&#x27;s rotary spark-gap transmitter as the second radio transmitter to be modulated to carry the human voice. Until the invention of vacuum-tube (valve) oscillators in 1913 such as the Armstrong oscillator, the Alexanderson alternator was an important high-power radio transmitter, and allowed amplitude modulation radio transmission of the human voice. The last remaining operable Alexanderson alternator is at the VLF transmitter Grimeton in Sweden and was in regular service until 1996. It continues to be operated for a few minutes on Alexanderson Day, which is either the last Sunday in June or first Sunday in July every year.

=== World War I and the formation of RCA ===

The outbreak of World War I forced European nations to temporarily abandon development of international radio communications networks, while the United States increased efforts to develop transoceanic radio. By the end of the war the Alexanderson alternator was operating to reliably provide transoceanic radio service. British Marconi offered General Electric $5,000 in business in exchange for exclusive rights to use the alternator, but just as the deal was about to go through, the American president Woodrow Wilson requested that GE decline the offer, which would have given the British (who were the leader in submarine communications cables) dominance over worldwide radio communications. GE complied with the request and joined with American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T), the United Fruit Company, the Western Electric Company and the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company to form the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), giving American companies control of American radio for the first time.

=== Stations ===
Thorn L. Mayes identified the production of ten pairs of 200 kW Alexanderson alternators, totaling twenty transmitters, in the period up to 1924:
=== U.S. military use during and after World War II ===

Beginning in 1941, seven of the twenty original 200 kW alternators were put into service by the U.S. Navy and Air Force:

During World War II the U.S. Navy recognized the need for reliable distant longwave (VLF) transmissions to the Pacific fleet. A new facility was constructed at Haiku in Hawaii, where two 200 KW Alexanderson alternators transferred from the mainland were installed. The Navy also operated an existing transmitter at Bolinas, California, again for Pacific ocean communication. Both Haiku alternators were sold for salvage in 1969, possibly to Kreger Company of California. 

In the late 1940s the Air Force assumed control of the Haiku and Marion, Massachusetts facilities. The Air Force found that longwave transmissions were more reliable than shortwave when sending weather information to Arctic researchers as well as bases in Greenland, Labrador, and Iceland. The two Marion transmitters were used until 1957. One was scrapped in 1961 and the other was reportedly handed over to the U.S. Bureau of Standards and stored in a Smithsonian Institution warehouse.

== Design ==

The Alexanderson alternator works similarly to an AC electric generator, but generates higher-frequency current, in the very low frequency (VLF) radio frequency range. The rotor has no conductive windings or electrical connections; it consists of a solid disc of high tensile strength magnetic steel, with narrow slots cut in its circumference to create a series of narrow &quot;teeth&quot; that function as magnetic poles. The space between the teeth is filled with nonmagnetic material, to give the rotor a smooth surface to decrease aerodynamic drag. The rotor is turned at a high speed by an electric motor through a speed–increaser gearbox.

The machine operates by variable reluctance (similar to an electric guitar pickup), changing the magnetic flux linking two coils. The periphery of the rotor is embraced by a circular iron stator with a C-shaped cross-section, divided into narrow poles, the same number as the rotor has, carrying two sets of coils. One set of coils is energized with direct current and produces a magnetic field in the air gap in the stator, which passes axially (sideways) through the rotor.

As the rotor turns, alternately either an iron section of the disk is in the gap between each pair of stator poles, allowing a high magnetic flux to cross the gap, or else a non-magnetic slot is in the stator gap, allowing less magnetic flux to pass. Thus the magnetic flux through the stator varies sinusoidally at a rapid rate. These changes in flux induce a radio-frequency voltage in a second set of coils on the stator.

The RF collector coils are all interconnected by an output transformer, whose secondary winding is connected to the antenna circuit. Modulation or telegraph keying of the radio frequency energy was done by a magnetic amplifier, which was also used for amplitude modulation and voice transmissions.

The frequency of the current generated by an Alexanderson alternator in hertz is the product of the number of rotor poles and the revolutions per second. Higher radio frequencies thus require more poles, a higher rotational speed, or both. Alexanderson alternators were used to produce radio waves in the very low frequency (VLF) range, for transcontinental wireless communication. A typical alternator with an output frequency of 100 kHz had 300 poles and rotated at 20,000 revolutions per minute (RPM) (333 revolutions per second). To produce high power, the clearance between the rotor and stator had to be kept to only 1 mm. The manufacture of precision machines rotating at such high speeds presented many new problems, and Alexanderson transmitters were bulky and very expensive.

=== Frequency control ===

The output frequency of the transmitter is proportional to the speed of the rotor. To keep the frequency constant, the speed of the electric motor turning it was controlled with a feedback loop. In one method, a sample of the output signal is applied to a high-Q tuned circuit, whose resonant frequency is slightly above the output frequency. The generator&#x27;s frequency falls on the &quot;skirt&quot; of the LC circuit&#x27;s impedance curve, where the impedance increases rapidly with frequency. The output of the LC circuit is rectified, and the resulting voltage is compared with a constant reference voltage to produce a feedback signal to control the motor speed. If the output frequency gets too high, the impedance presented by the LC circuit increases, and the amplitude of the RF signal getting through the LC circuit drops. The feedback signal to the motor drops, and the motor slows down. Thus the alternator output frequency is &quot;locked&quot; to the tuned circuit resonant frequency.

The sets were built to operate at wavelengths of 10,500 to 24,000 meters (28.57 to 12.5 kHz). This was accomplished by three design variables. The alternators were built with 1220, 976 or 772 poles. Three gearboxes were available with ratios of 2.675, 2.973 and 3.324 and the 900 RPM driving motor was operated at slips of 4% to 20%, giving speeds of 864 to 720 RPM. Transmitters installed in Europe, operating on 50 Hz power, had a wavelength range of 12,500 to 28,800 meters due to the lower speed of the driving motor.

== Performance advantages ==

A large Alexanderson alternator might produce 500 kW of output radio-frequency energy and would be water- or oil-cooled. One such machine had 600 pole pairs in the stator winding, and the rotor was driven at 2170 RPM, for an output frequency near 21.7 kHz. To obtain higher frequencies, higher rotor speeds were required, up to 20,000 RPM.

Along with the arc converter invented in 1903, the Alexanderson alternator was one of the first radio transmitters that generated continuous waves. In contrast, the earlier spark-gap transmitters generated a string of damped waves. These were electrically &quot;noisy&quot;; the energy of the transmitter was spread over a wide frequency range, so they interfered with other transmissions and operated inefficiently. With a continuous-wave transmitter, all of the energy was concentrated within a narrow frequency band, so for a given output power they could communicate over longer distances. In addition, continuous waves could be modulated with an audio signal to carry sound. The Alexanderson alternator was one of the first transmitters to be used for AM transmission.

The Alexanderson alternator produced &quot;purer&quot; continuous waves than the arc converter, whose nonsinusoidal output generated significant harmonics, so the alternator was preferred for long-distance telegraphy.

== Disadvantages ==
Because of the extremely high rotational speed compared to a conventional alternator, the Alexanderson alternator required continuous maintenance by skilled personnel. Efficient lubrication and oil or water cooling was essential for reliability which was difficult to achieve with the lubricants available at the time. In fact, early editions of the Royal Navy&#x27;s &quot;Admiralty Handbook of Wireless Telegraphy&quot; cover this in considerable detail, mostly as an explanation as to why the navy did not use that particular technology. However, the US Navy did.

Other major problems were that changing the operating frequency was a lengthy and complicated process, and unlike a spark transmitter, the carrier signal could not be switched on and off at will. The latter problem greatly complicated &quot;listening through&quot; (that is, stopping the transmission to listen for any answer). There was also the risk that it would allow enemy vessels to detect the presence of the ship.

Because of the limits of the number of poles and rotational speed of a machine, the Alexanderson alternator is capable of generating transmission frequencies up to around 600 kHz in the lower Medium wave band, with shortwave and higher frequencies being physically impossible.

<text>Nota Sports and Racing Cars is an automobile manufacturer in Australia that was established in 1952. Their best-selling car was the Nota Fang, with 105 cars built between 1968 and 1975. 
==History==
The company was founded by Guy Buckingham in 1952. He was an aircraft engineer and used his expertise to build triangulated spaceframed sportscars. Possibly Australia&#x27;s first space-framed cars. In 1958 the company built a series of all-enveloping aluminium streamlined sports cars. First called &quot;Streamliners&quot;, and later called &quot;Mazengarbs&quot;. Up to 1960 eleven of those were made. In the late 1950s the company produced Formula Junior cars in both front and mid-engined formats. Nota also made a series of specialist monoposto racing cars for the track and hill climbing events. In 1963 the company made a series of Mini powered sports cars. In 1964 they started production of the Nota Sapphire, an alloy bodied sports and coupe designs with Ford Fiat and Coventry Climax engines. In 1965 Nota started producing Formula Vee cars for Warwick Farm race track making 34 in the first year. In the 1960s the company formulated their &quot;Sportsman&quot;, a Lotus 7 lookalike, which they still build today and are now building in a mid-engined version for the modern day transverse engines which the major car manufacturers produce. In 1968 came the Nota Fang Chris Buckinghams first real design, a midengined sports car using a Cooper S engine power plant behind the driver but in front of the rear wheels, their most successful model with over 100 being made. Later the Fang was equipped with Lancia engines, then Toyota engines, finally being fitted with Toyota&#x27;s V6 Quad cam supercharged engines with over 400BHP. In 1973 Nota started with their Marauder range of cars using the same mechanicals as the Nota Fang. At the same time they were making the Nota Levanti front engine twin cam coupe. In 1975 the supply of Leyland 1275 GT engines started to run out so Nota contacted FIAT and both Marauders and Fangs were made with the 2-litre twin cam FIAT/Lancia engine.
Leyland were then approached and the P76 engine was fitted to the Marauders using a Nota made gearbox trans-axle with the gear box next to the driver and the engine behind.

In the late 1970s Nota had started on 4WD 351 V8 mid-engined Marauders, but in the 1980s Ford stopped export of the 351 engine to Australia. After a trip to England Chris Buckingham assembled a design team to design a Fang with Fl 3 litre V6 quad cam engine as well as a fully enclosed, similarly specified Chimera. In 2003 Nota developed the Nota Le Mans, powered by either a Suzuki GTi 1300 cc or 1100 cc motor cycle engine. For road use it could also use a Toyota 1800 cc VVTi 6-speed or the 3.5-litre V6 quad cam. By 2012 Nota had decided that due to the lack of front engine rear wheel drive 4 cylinder engine being available they would use an existing front-engined Nota clubman chassis and move the seats forward by 150mm and fit a transverse engine behind the driver. It looks just like their front-engined clubmans but with the advantage of a mid-engined design.

<text>The Country Party of New Zealand was a political party which appealed to rural voters. It was represented in Parliament from 1928 to 1938. Its policies were a mixture of rural advocacy and social credit theory.

==History==
The Country Party had its origins in the Auckland Farmers&#x27; Union, a branch of the New Zealand Farmers&#x27; Union which covered the old Auckland Province. Members of the branch increasingly came to believe that the Reform Party, which traditionally enjoyed much support in rural areas, was now putting the interests of farmers behind those of businesses in the city. The Auckland branch was also strongly influenced by the social credit theory of monetary reform, promoted by C. H. Douglas. Many farmers believed that the country&#x27;s financial system did not treat them fairly and that they were being exploited by big-city bankers and moneylenders.

The Auckland branch grew increasingly frustrated with the Farmers&#x27; Union leadership, which did not support having an independent rural party. Eventually, members of the Auckland branch established the Country Party without the Union&#x27;s backing. In 1928, the branch broke away from the Union altogether and gave its full backing to the Country Party.

In the 1925 elections, the Country Party fielded five candidates but won only 0.3% of the vote. In the 1928 elections it won the Bay of Islands seat. In Parliament, the Country Party tended to align itself with the growing Labour Party, primarily because both parties were distrustful of the financial and banking industries.

In the 1931 elections, the Country Party increased its share of the vote to 2.3%. In the 1935 elections, the party&#x27;s share of the vote dropped slightly, but it won two seats. Arthur Sexton was elected in the Franklin electorate.

In the 1938 elections, the Country Party lost both its seats, as Labour decided to contest them. Rushworth had retired, partly because of Labour&#x27;s intervention, and Sexton was defeated by the National Party. The party won only 0.23% of the vote and disappeared soon afterwards. Most rural voters who had supported it turned to the National Party, which incorporated the Reform Party. Later, however, the Social Credit Party would gain a certain amount of success in rural areas using much the same formula, and some see the Country Party as a forerunner to the more long-lived Social Credit.

== Country Party, 1969 == 
The Country Party was revived for the by Clifford Stanley Emeny of New Plymouth (1920–2000), a World War II air force veteran. The party put forward candidates in 15 seats, and they attracted 6,715 votes. Emeny stood in Stratford where he got 1130 votes, the largest vote for the party; and in Egmont, New Plymouth, Tauranga and Waimarino. The other seats contested were Ashburton, Hamilton West, Otago, Pahiatua, Raglan, Rangitikei, Rodney, Waikato, Waitomo and Wallace.

The Country Party had changed its name to the Liberal Reform Party in 1970. In the , Emeny stood as a Liberal Reform candidate.

<doc id="1280840" wikidata="Q869400" url="?curid=1280840" title="Melbourne Showgrounds">
<text>Melbourne Showgrounds is located in the inner north-western suburb of Ascot Vale, Victoria, Australia, next door to Flemington Racecourse. The largest and most flexible indoor/outdoor venue space in Melbourne the Showgrounds is the home of the annual Melbourne Royal Show, as well as major exhibitions, trade shows, and music concerts, including the Supanova Pop Culture Expo, the Caravan &amp; Camping Touring Supershow and MotoExpo.

The venue has also been the selected site for TV and film production and is the current filming location for MasterChef Australia.

It has previously been used for large music festivals – as of 2010, it plays host to Stereosonic until the Festivals end in 2015.

It also was used on the last show on The Police&#x27;s Synchronicity Tour, their last world tour, before they re-united briefly to play three concerts for the Amnesty International &quot;A Conspiracy of Hope Tour&quot; and reuniting in the studio.

==History==

===Establishment===
The site at Ascot Vale was given to the National Agricultural Society of Victoria (predecessor of the Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria) in 1882. The first Show held the next year and over the next few decades a number of pavilions were erected on the site. During both World War I and World War II the showgrounds were requisitioned for military purposes. The main arena played host to harness racing as well as the annual show; in fact, it was the main harness racecourse in metropolitan Melbourne for almost four decades until the early 1980s, when all major Victorian harness meetings were moved to Moonee Valley Racecourse. 
During the 1970s the first major attractions were built, such as the 1,800 feet long chairlift, with 112 chairs that covered the journey in 7 minutes. In 1977 the new Government Pavilion was completed, costing $1,800,000 and covering an area of 2,839 square metres. The iconic &quot;Pie in the Sky&quot; was also built the same year, and was heritage listed in 1999.

As well as hosting harness racing, the Melbourne Showground track was a semi regular host of speedway. During the 1980s and early 1990s the showground saw such Motorcycle speedway riders as World Champions Ivan Mauger, Hans Nielsen, Michael Lee, Shawn Moran, Simon Wigg and Tommy Knudsen, as well as Australian&#x27;s Phil Crump, Rod Hunter, Mark Fiora and Todd Wiltshire. During this time the showground hosted two annual speedway events, the &quot;Boxing Day Spectacular&quot;, and the &quot;Mr Melbourne&quot; title held in January. Winners of these events included Simon Wigg, Tommy Knudsen and Todd Wiltshire.

===Redevelopment===

By the early 2000s the Royal Melbourne Showgrounds had become dilapidated, especially when compared to other Australian venues such as the Sydney Showgrounds at Homebush. As a result, the State Government announced a redevelopment of the Royal Melbourne Showgrounds site, to be carried out as a joint venture partnership with the Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria and private sector investors, with demolition commencing in June 2002, and all work to be completed by the 2006 Royal Melbourne Show.

In March 2004 a list of the three short-listed consortia was announced, with the winning applicant revealed in December that year: PPP Solutions – a consortium of financier Babcock and Brown, Multiplex Constructions, Multiplex Facilities Management, Spotless Services and Daryl Jackson Architects. The contract with PPP Solutions was signed on 22 June 2005, and required the consortium to design, build, finance and maintain the showground facilities for a period of 25 years.

Costing $146 million, the government provided $101 million for the project, the Royal Agricultural Society $16 million, and the remaining $29 million will come from lease revenue and management fees. Two-thirds of the site was redeveloped as a venue for the Royal Melbourne Show, while &#x27;non-core&#x27; land along Epsom Road and Langs Road to be given over to other uses.

The works were completed as planned by the 2006 Royal Melbourne Show, and included the following new works:

* An 8,000-square metre Grand Pavilion,
* A new 10,000-square metre Exhibition Pavilion, which can house livestock,
* A new 4,300-seat outdoor arena, capable of holding two horse competition rings,
* A Grand Boulevard linking the grassy spaces and events areas, and
* The new headquarters for the Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria.

The following heritage buildings were also restored:

* Centenary Hall, an art-deco hall built in 1934 and now restored to its original condition,
* The heritage-listed Public Grandstand, built in 1915 with new seating,
* Pie in the Sky, the heritage-listed and popular meeting point which was built in 1977.

Before the redevelopment the main arena had a 15,000 capacity, with the new basic rectangle arena opened for the 2006 Royal Melbourne Show. Around the same time the rest of old arena was demolished.

In 2008 the development of the Epsom Road site was announced, with Coles Group building a $40 million neighbourhood shopping centre, featuring a Coles supermarket, 1st Choice Liquor superstore, 30 retail spaces ranging in size from 50 square metres to 600 square metres, and a not-for-profit child care centre able to accommodate up to 120 children. The heritage listed Woodfull Pavilion was also incorporated into the development, which opened in August 2009.

==Film and television productions==
The showgrounds have also been used to film numerous television productions including commercials.

<doc id="1280843" wikidata="Q779220" url="?curid=1280843" title="Hilbert's syzygy theorem">
<text>In mathematics, Hilbert&#x27;s syzygy theorem is one of the three fundamental theorems about polynomial rings over fields, first proved by David Hilbert in 1890, that were introduced for solving important open questions in invariant theory, and are at the basis of modern algebraic geometry. The two other theorems are Hilbert&#x27;s basis theorem, which asserts that all ideals of polynomial rings over a field are finitely generated, and Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz, which establishes a bijective correspondence between affine algebraic varieties and prime ideals of polynomial rings.

Hilbert&#x27;s syzygy theorem concerns the &quot;relations&quot;, or syzygies in Hilbert&#x27;s terminology, between the generators of an ideal, or, more generally, a module. As the relations form a module, one may consider the relations between the relations; the theorem asserts that, if one continues in this way, starting with a module over a polynomial ring in indeterminates over a field, one eventually finds a zero module of relations, after at most steps.

Hilbert&#x27;s syzygy theorem is now considered to be an early result of homological algebra. It is the starting point of the use of homological methods in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.

==History==
The syzygy theorem first appeared in Hilbert&#x27;s seminal paper &quot;Über die Theorie der algebraischen Formen&quot; (1890). The paper is split into five parts: part I proves Hilbert&#x27;s basis theorem over a field, while part II proves it over the integers. Part III contains the syzygy theorem (Theorem III), which is used in part IV to discuss the Hilbert polynomial. The last part, part V, proves finite generation of certain rings of invariants. Incidentally part III also contains a special case of the Hilbert–Burch theorem.

==Syzygies (relations)==

Originally, Hilbert defined syzygies for ideals in polynomial rings, but the concept generalizes trivially to (left) modules over any ring.

Given a generating set formula_1 of a module over a ring , a relation or first syzygy between the generators is a -tuple formula_2 of elements of such that
:formula_3
Let formula_4 be a free module with basis formula_5 The -tuple formula_2 may be identified with the element 
:formula_7
and the relations form the kernel formula_8 of the linear map formula_9 defined by formula_10 In other words, one has an exact sequence
:formula_11

This first syzygy module formula_8 depends on the choice of a generating set, but, if formula_13 is the module that is obtained with another generating set, there exist two free modules formula_14 and formula_15 such that 
:formula_16
where formula_17 denote the direct sum of modules.

The &quot;second syzygy&quot; module is the module of the relations between generators of the first syzygy module. By continuing in this way, one may define the &quot;th syzygy module&quot; for every positive integer .

If the th syzygy module is free for some , then by taking a basis as a generating set, the next syzygy module (and every subsequent one) is the zero module. If one does not take a basis as a generating set, then all subsequent syzygy modules are free.

Let be the smallest integer, if any, such that the th syzygy module of a module is free or projective. The above property of invariance, up to the sum direct with free modules, implies that does not depend on the choice of generating sets. The projective dimension of is this integer, if it exists, or if not. This is equivalent with the existence of an exact sequence
:formula_18
where the modules formula_19 are free and formula_20 is projective. It can be shown that one may always choose the generating sets for formula_20 being free, that is for the above exact sequence to be a free resolution.

== Statement ==
Hilbert&#x27;s syzygy theorem states that, if is a finitely generated module over a polynomial ring formula_22 in indeterminates over a field , then the th syzygy module of is always a free module.

In modern language, this implies that the projective dimension of is at most , and thus that there exists a free resolution 
:formula_23
of length .

This upper bound on the projective dimension is sharp, that is, there are modules of projective dimension exactly . The standard example is the field , which may be considered as a formula_22-module by setting formula_25 for every and every . For this module, the th syzygy module is free, but not the th one (for a proof, see , below).

The theorem is also true for modules that are not finitely generated. As the global dimension of a ring is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all modules, Hilbert&#x27;s syzygy theorem may be restated as: &quot;the global dimension of formula_22 is &quot;.

=== Low dimension ===

In the case of zero indeterminates, Hilbert&#x27;s syzygy theorem is simply the fact that every finitely generated vector space has a basis.

In the case of a single indeterminate, Hilbert&#x27;s syzygy theorem is an instance of the theorem asserting that over a principal ideal ring, every submodule of a free module is itself free.

== Koszul complex ==

The Koszul complex, also called &quot;complex of exterior algebra&quot;, allows, in some cases, an explicit description of all syzygy modules.

Let formula_1 be a generating system of an ideal in a polynomial ring formula_28, and let formula_29 be a free module of basis formula_30 The exterior algebra of formula_29 is the direct sum
:formula_32
where formula_33 is the free module, which has, as a basis, the exterior products
:formula_34
such that formula_35 In particular, one has formula_36 (because of the definition of the empty product), the two definitions of formula_29 coincide, and formula_38 for . For every positive , one may define a linear map formula_39 by

:formula_40
where the hat means that the factor is omitted. A straightforward computation shows that the composition of two consecutive such maps is zero, and thus that one has a complex
:formula_41

This is the &quot;Koszul complex&quot;. In general the Koszul complex is not an exact sequence, but &quot;it is an exact sequence if one works with a polynomial ring&quot; formula_28 &quot;and an ideal generated by a regular sequence of homogeneous polynomials.&quot;

In particular, the sequence formula_43 is regular, and the Koszul complex is thus a projective resolution of formula_44formula_45 In this case, the th syzygy module is free of dimension one (generated by the product of all formula_46); the th syzygy module is thus the quotient of a free module of dimension by the submodule generated by formula_47 This quotient may not be a projective module, as otherwise, there would exist polynomials formula_48 such that formula_49 which is impossible (substituting 0 for the formula_50 in the latter equality provides ). This proves that the projective dimension of formula_51 is exactly .

The same proof applies for proving that the projective dimension of formula_52 is exactly if the formula_53 form a regular sequence of homogeneous polynomials.

==Computation==
At Hilbert&#x27;s time, there was no method available for computing syzygies. It was only known that an algorithm may be deduced from any upper bound of the degree of the generators of the module of syzygies. In fact, the coefficients of the syzygies are unknown polynomials. If the degree of these polynomials is bounded, the number of their monomials is also bounded. Expressing that one has a syzygy provides a system of linear equations whose unknowns are the coefficients of these monomials. Therefore, any algorithm for linear systems implies an algorithm for syzygies, as soon as a bound of the degrees is known.

The first bound for syzygies (as well as for the ideal membership problem) was given in 1926 by Grete Hermann: Let a submodule of a free module of dimension over formula_54 if the coefficients over a basis of of a generating system of have a total degree at most , then there is a constant such that the degrees occurring in a generating system of the first syzygy module is at most formula_55 The same bound applies for testing the membership to of an element of .

On the other hand, there are examples where a double exponential degree necessarily occurs. However such examples are extremely rare, and this sets the question of an algorithm that is efficient when the output is not too large. At the present time, the best algorithms for computing syzygies are Gröbner basis algorithms. They allow the computation of the first syzygy module, and also, with almost no extra cost, all syzygies modules.

==Syzygies and regularity==
One might wonder which ring-theoretic property of formula_56 causes the Hilbert syzygy theorem to hold. It turns out that 
this is regularity, which is an algebraic formulation of the fact that affine -space is a variety without singularities. In fact the following generalization holds: Let formula_57 be a Noetherian ring. Then formula_57 has finite global dimension if and only if formula_57 is regular and the Krull dimension of formula_57 is finite; in that case the global dimension of formula_57 is equal to the Krull dimension. This result may be proven using Serre&#x27;s theorem on regular local rings.

<doc id="1280844" wikidata="Q5047790" url="?curid=1280844" title="Casa Bonita">
<text>Casa Bonita ( in Spanish) is a Mexican restaurant in Lakewood, Colorado, located within the Lamar Station Plaza. It first opened in 1974, and was originally part of a chain of Mexican entertainment restaurants that started in Oklahoma City. The restaurant attracted a cult following among Coloradans since its opening, and is considered by many to be an iconic establishment of Lakewood and the greater Denver metropolitan area.

In 2019, &quot;The Denver Post&quot; published a feature on the restaurant and described the decor, saying, &quot;Its pink exterior conceals a vast network of nooks and crannies inside. While the main, multilevel dining room is decorated with plastic palm trees and strings of lights, different facades and themed rooms invoke regional Mexican architectural styles, including the resort of Puerto Vallarta.&quot; The centerpiece is a indoor waterfall with cliff divers, an imitation of the cliffs of Acapulco. The building is crowned with a gold dome and a statue of Cuauhtémoc, the last Aztec emperor of Mexico. It was designated a historic landmark of the city in March 2015.

Casa Bonita temporarily closed in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and its owner filed for bankruptcy in April 2021. Later that year, it was acquired by &quot;South Park&quot; creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who gave the restaurant a significant renovation. The restaurant held a soft relaunch beginning June 23, 2023, now billing itself as &quot;The Greatest Restaurant in the World!&quot;

==History==
Founder Bill Waugh opened the first Casa Bonita restaurant in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in 1968. By the mid-1970s, the chain had expanded to locations in adjacent states and was known for its &quot;all you can eat&quot; beef or chicken plates and offering sopapillas—small squares of fried bread served with honey—with every meal.

In 1982, Casa Bonita&#x27;s parent company, which also owned Taco Bueno fast food restaurants, was sold to Unigate (later Uniq plc). In 1992, Unigate sold the restaurants to CKE Restaurants, owner of Carl&#x27;s Jr. In 1997, the two remaining Casa Bonita restaurants, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Lakewood, Colorado, were spun off by CKE as part of Star Buffet. The Tulsa location closed in September 2005, then reopened for two years as Casa Viva, and closed again in December 2007. It was reopened by Star Buffet under the original name in late July 2008 but closed again in 2011, leaving the Lakewood location as the last Casa Bonita. The Lakewood Historical Society chose to designate the restaurant as a city landmark in March 2015.

In March 2020, Casa Bonita closed temporarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which Colorado Governor Jared Polis had placed a ban on in-person dining during the two-month span between March 17 and May 26. In March, several employees reported that their most recent paychecks had bounced due to insufficient funds in the Casa Bonita payroll account. The restaurant&#x27;s website disappeared during the summer of 2020 sometime between July 7 and July 30.

On April 6, 2021, Summit Family Restaurants, Casa Bonita&#x27;s owner, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Arizona. On September 23, 2021, &quot;South Park&quot; creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone reached an agreement to purchase the restaurant for $3.1 million. A group named &quot;Save Casa Bonita&quot; filed an objection to Parker and Stone&#x27;s purchase, pointing out that they had in fact made an offer first. Their objection was later withdrawn, and the sale was completed by November 19.

Parker and Stone spent $40 million renovating the restaurant and hired Chef Dana Rodriguez to update the menu. Arthur Bradford chronicled the experience in &quot;¡Casa Bonita Mi Amor!&quot; (2024), a makeover documentary.

The restaurant had a soft opening on May 26, 2023. Casa Bonita began taking reservations for weekends beginning June 23, 2023.

==Location==

The Lakewood location was built in 1973 and opened in March 1974, on Colfax Avenue west of Denver, along U.S. Route 40/I-70 Business. Similar in architecture to the Tulsa location (both were previously large retail store locations) features strolling mariachis, flame jugglers (no longer allowed in 2019 for violating fire code), and a waterfall with cliff divers. The website Roadside America mentions that the restaurant has &quot;Wild West shootouts, brawling pirates, [and] a dancing gorilla&quot; that &quot;can be viewed while you eat&quot;. It also has a small puppet theater, a &quot;haunted tunnel&quot; (Black Bart&#x27;s Cave), an arcade with a large skee-ball room, and a magic theater. Since 2023, as a nod to its new owners, the restaurant has references to &quot;South Park&quot;, such as a prop of Eric Cartman having food in his iconic table and a ManBearPig meet-and-greet. The restaurant is and can seat up to 1,100 patrons.

==Defunct locations==
===Oklahoma City, Oklahoma===
The first Casa Bonita was opened in the summer of 1968 in Oklahoma City, at a time when Mexican food was considered a novelty in the area. The restaurant was located along U.S. Route 66 at the intersection of NW 39th and Portland. On opening, it featured themed rooms, including the Garden Room and El Pokey, a room themed as a Mexican jail. The Oklahoma City location closed in 1993. After housing other businesses, the building was demolished in 2015.

===Tulsa, Oklahoma===
The Tulsa location opened in 1971 near the intersection of 21st and Sheridan. The interior was designed to create the outdoor nighttime atmosphere of a Mexican village. Its various themed dining areas, with seating for over 500, included a village square with fountain, a 2-level lantern-lit cave, a tropical garden with waterfall and stream, and a room resembling an aristocratic dining hall with a porch along with strolling mariachis. The Tulsa location also included a puppet and magic show theater, a video arcade, a working carousel, and a gift shop.

It closed on September 30, 2005, due to a reported inability to reach suitable lease terms with the property owner. It was reopened, as Casa Viva, in May 2006 and then closed again in December 2007. In late July 2008, the restaurant, having been sold back to its previous owner group, reopened under the original Casa Bonita name. In February 2011, the restaurant failed to reopen after lengthy snowstorms hit Tulsa, and a sign on the door said it was closed for business.

=== Little Rock, Arkansas ===
The Little Rock location opened in 1969 at the corner of University Avenue and Asher Avenue (at the time U.S. Highway 67/70), just south of the University of Arkansas-Little Rock campus. This location had many of the same features as its sister locations including a Garden Room, an El Pokey (a room themed as a Mexican jail), a fully functioning video arcade, and a gift shop. In its heyday, the Little Rock location was reported to have been the highest volume Mexican restaurant in the United States with annual sales of up to $2,500,000. That distinction would later go to the Denver location which would go on to post nearly $8,000,000 in sales on an annual basis.

The restaurant closed and rebranded under the ownership of the Waugh family as &quot;Casa Viva&quot; on August 2, 1993, after a reported $250,000 was spent in renovations. It would revert to the original Casa Bonita branding in 1995, until closing permanently in 2005.

=== Fort Worth, Texas ===
*Hulen Mall, Fort Worth, Texas (1982–1985)

==Employee relations==
In the summer of 2023, Stone and Parker amended the employee compensation system at Casa Bonita, removing the need for wait staff to earn tips, instead paying every employee $30 per hour, much higher than the Colorado minimum wage, $13.65. This came on the heels of a nationwide campaign to eliminate tipping in food service, owing to &quot;tipping fatigue&quot; on the part of customers who came to oppose the practice.

Just days before its much-anticipated reopening, Casa Bonita rescinded its original employment contracts and asked staff to sign new agreements that may amount to smaller wages. Casa Bonita initially advertised salaries ranging from $14.27 to $15.27 for servers and bartenders, in addition to tips, and employees signed contracts earlier in the spring agreeing to the wages. In the days before public opening, the restaurant called employees to a meeting at which they were told to sign new contracts within a day or quit. 

Casa Bonita employees, with help from the worker center, Restaurant Opportunities Centers (ROC) United, sent a petition to management, demanding more transparency and better communication on a number of issues. 

In October 2024, employees at Casa Bonita announced their intention to form a union with Actors’ Equity and IATSE. Employees cited unsafe work conditions and pay as the primary reasons for unionization. 

==In popular culture==
The &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Casa Bonita&quot; prominently features the Colorado branch of the restaurant. Other episodes that mention it briefly are: &quot;Quest for Ratings&quot; (where a clock is labeled as showing the time at Casa Bonita), &quot;You Have 0 Friends&quot;, &quot;201&quot; (where the restaurant is reportedly destroyed), &quot;Let Go, Let Gov&quot;, and &quot;South ParQ Vaccination Special&quot;. Additionally, the building that houses South Park Studios was named after the restaurant. In August 2021, the show&#x27;s creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, announced they would purchase Casa Bonita. The renovations of the restaurant are documented in the 2024 film &quot;¡Casa Bonita Mi Amor!&quot;. In one of downloadable content packs to the video game &quot;South Park: The Fractured But Whole&quot;, the restaurant plays a central role in the story.

In 2009, rock band The Fray held the release party for their eponymous second album at Casa Bonita.

In the reboot of &quot;Roseanne&quot;, Casa Bonita is featured as the workplace of Becky Connor in Episode 4.

The music video for Collapsing Scenery&#x27;s &quot;Resort Beyond the Last Resort&quot;, directed by Kansas Bowling and starring Boyd Rice, was partially filmed at Casa Bonita.

Punk rock band SPELLS performed their song &quot;A Huevo&quot; at Casa Bonita.

In 2018, the Denver Broncos announced their draft picks at Casa Bonita with the help of the resident magician.

For several years, artist Andrew Novick has hosted a Casa Bonita-themed art show at Denver&#x27;s NEXT Gallery. Novick has been to the restaurant more than 300 times and has given tours of it. He says of the restaurant, &quot;every time I go there, I have a sense of wonder all over again because it&#x27;s so big and there&#x27;s so many things in there—like the waterfall—and you feel like you&#x27;re outside, and the sounds and lights and everything in there. It&#x27;s just ... it&#x27;s unmatched.&quot;

<doc id="1280848" wikidata="Q5095977" url="?curid=1280848" title="Chicheley Hall">
<text>Chicheley Hall, Chicheley, Buckinghamshire, England, is a country house built in the first quarter of the 18th century. The client was Sir John Chester, the main architect was Francis Smith of Warwick and the architectural style is Baroque. Later owners included David Beatty, 2nd Earl Beatty and the Royal Society. Chicheley Hall is a Grade I listed building.

==History==
===Earlier buildings===
A manor house on the site belonged to the Pagnell family of Newport Pagnell, but was donated by them to the church. Cardinal Wolsey gave the manor to Christ Church, Oxford, but it subsequently reverted to the Crown after Wolsey&#x27;s fall and was acquired by a wool merchant, Anthony Cave, in 1545, who built a manor house in the form of a hollow square. On his death the house was left to his daughter Judith, who had married her cousin William Chester, son of Sir William Chester. Their only son Anthony was High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire for 1602 and created a baronet in 1620.

The house then descended in the Chester family to the time of the English Civil War, when it was shelled by Parliamentary forces and eventually demolished. The present Chicheley Hall was built in the early 1700s on the same site. All that remains of the old manor house is one Jacobean over-mantel with termini caryatids, and some panelling in the new Chicheley Hall.

===Building the current hall: 1719-1724===
The present hall was built between 1719 and 1723, with the interior fittings completed in 1725. The house was often attributed to the architect Thomas Archer, but more recent research suggests Francis Smith, who is thought to have designed it for Sir John Chester, 4th Baronet.

After John Chester&#x27;s death the house descended to Charles Bagot Chester, the 7th Baronet, a drunk and gambler, who jumped out of a second floor window in a drunken fit. Before dying of his injuries he bequeathed all of his estates, including Chicheley, to a distant relative and school friend, Charles Bagot, on condition he adopted the name of Chester. Charles&#x27; son Charles Bagot Chester, a gambler, rake and Member of Parliament, rented out the hall for many years. After his death the estate descended to the unmarried Charles Anthony Chester and from 1883 was again rented out to a series of tenants for the next 70 years.

===20th century===
In 1911, the Hall was rented by Sir George Farrar, a Randlord who made his fortune in gold in South Africa, and his wife Ella. Their daughter Gwen was a noted cellist.

During the Second World War, Chicheley Hall was used by the Special Operations Executive as its Special Training School No. 46. From 1942 until 1943, it was used for training Czechoslovaks for SOE parachute missions. The hall was later used as a base to train Polish agents, and then became a FANY wireless telegraphy school. Fortunately, the fine interior was protected by hardboard.

The house was purchased from the Chester family in 1952 by David Beatty, 2nd Earl Beatty. Beatty, son of Admiral Lord Beatty, began a large restoration programme and finally employed the renowned interior decorator Felix Harboard, famed for his work at Luttrellstown Castle near Dublin. Harboard&#x27;s classical colour schemes accentuating moulding and panelling perfectly suit the house. Chicheley Hall remained the home of the 2nd Earl&#x27;s fourth wife, Diane, after his death. She remarried, to Sir John Nutting, and was later the chairman of the Georgian Group. Together, they ran the house as a venue for weddings and conferences, and as a filming location. The house represented Bletchley Park in the 2001 film &quot;Enigma&quot;.

===21st century===
In 2007, Chicheley Hall was offered for sale, with a guide price of £9 million. It was bought by the Royal Society for £6.5 million, funded in part by the Norwegian philanthropist Fred Kavli. The Royal Society spent £12 million renovating the house, and adapting it to become the Kavli Royal Society International Centre, a venue for science seminars and conferences. Outside of these scientific events the hall may be hired for corporate and social events.

Chicheley Hall was operated by De Vere Venues until June 2020, when it closed &#x27;permanently&#x27; following (initially) a temporary closure due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Later that year, it was again listed for sale. Writing in &quot;Country Life&quot;, Penny Churchill noted that the Royal Society had restored the mansion and converted the stable block to a hotel with 48 bedrooms and a conference centre. The hall was sold in March 2021 to Pyrrho Investments.

==Architecture and description==
The principal, south, facade of the house is of nine bays and three storeys above a raised basement; the central section of three bays projects. Massive fluted Corinthian pilasters flank the central three bays. These are repeated at each termination of the facade and again divide the second from the third bay of each wing that flanks the central projection. The facade is symmetrical, however the curve-topped windows of the central projection are taller than the flat-topped windows of the wings, thus uniformity at roof level is achieved by an upward curve to the central section from the wings. These motifs, examples of baroque architecture are exceedingly rare in Britain, where baroque was fashionable for a very brief period at the end of the 17th century and beginning of the 18th. The brickwork, from bricks made on site, is described by Nikolaus Pevsner and Elizabeth Williamson, in their 2003 &quot;Buckinghamshire&quot; volume of the Pevsner Buildings of England, as &quot;among the finest of any house of this date&quot;.

The main door opens to a fine panelled Great Hall, in the manner of William Kent with a classical double-height ceiling depicting Herse and her sisters sacrificing to Flora. Through an arcade of marble columns, oak staircases lead to the upper floors. The most remarkable room is the library on the upper floor, with all shelving and books concealed behind what appears to be panelling, thus disguising the room&#x27;s true use.

The house is surrounded by a park of , including a lake, canal, and of gardens, laid out by George London and Henry Wise. An avenue of lime trees leads to the house, past an octagonal dovecote. The River Ouse lies to the east.

===Listing designations===
Chicheley Hall is a Grade I listed building. The stable block, the service wing, and the dovecote are listed Grade II*. A garden house to the north-west of the hall, and a summerhouse to the north-east are listed Grade II, as are three sets of gates, with attached walls and gate piers.

<text>The Small Münsterländer (also SM or Kleiner Münsterländer) is a versatile hunting-pointing-retrieving dog breed that reached its current form in the area around Münster, Germany. The Large Münsterländer is from the same area, but was developed from different breeding stock and is not related as the names would suggest. Small Münsterländers bear a resemblance to both spaniels and setters but are more versatile while hunting on land and water. The Small Münsterländer is recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale under Group 7, Section 1.2, Continental Pointing Dogs of Spaniel type, by the American Kennel Club as a Foundation Stock Service breed, and by The Kennel Club and the United Kennel Club as a gun dog. It is related to the Epagneul Français and the Drentsche Patrijshond.

== Description ==

=== Appearance ===

Males should stand between , and females should stand between at the withers. The weight ranges between with the males being the larger of the two. Strong and harmonious build of medium size, showing balanced proportions with a lot of quality and elegance. In upright posture the dog displays flowing outlines with a horizontally carried, well flagged tail. The dog should appear to be strong in the hindquarters and balanced with a distinguished, not too blocky head. Its front legs are well feathered, the hind legs with breeches. The coat should be medium length, glossy, dense, and straight or slightly wavy. The dog&#x27;s movement should be athletic, graceful and far reaching.

The coloration of the dog is large patches of brown on a ticked or solid white background.

=== Temperament ===
Small Münsterländers are extremely intelligent, trainable, and attentive but require gentle and patient training. Coupled with their intelligence, if they determine an owner to be inconsistent or indecisive, the owner might find that the dog will challenge the owner. For training, both voice and hand signals are used, and a Small Münsterländer will routinely look back to check in with the hunter for silent signals at intervals when on hold or pointing. They have a very strong prey drive and enjoy rewarding their owner with productive hunts. They thrive with hunting or comparable challenging exercise for an hour or more every day. They are strong swimmers, especially when compared to other short-haired hunting breeds.

Lack of regular and sufficient exercise and mental challenge will likely result in unwanted behavior, which is common in highly intelligent, driven breeds. The Small Münsterländer is a happy, affectionate family pet when in the house, while remaining a keenly focused, even driven, hunter-pointer-retriever when in the field. They are not suited to life in a kennel because of their sociable nature and need to interact with people – they need to live in the home of their family. Small Münsterländers will pick an individual person to bond most closely with, typically the one who hunts with the dog, but will revel in the company of the rest of the family as well. When raised with other pets in the household, such as cats, they can coexist happily though they may enjoy a game of chase and point. Unfamiliar small animals outdoors will not be tolerated in the same way.

===Health===
Due to the breed organizations, responsible kennels, and owners having a strong commitment to the health of the breed, breed programs are overwhelmingly very selective in breeding dogs that are OFA/Penn Hip, CERF, and temperament clear. As a result, instances of congenital diseases and conditions are extremely low and any dog clearly showing physical or behavioral abnormalities shall be disqualified from the breeding program. The breed is robustly healthy with rare issues save dry skin in colder climates and water in its ears after swimming.

==History==

Originally a dog bred exclusively for noble families and to work with their families&#x27; falconers before guns were used in bird and small game hunting, ancestors of the Small Münsterländer (formerly the Kleiner Münsterländer Vorstehhund) had to work in upland areas to flush prey for the falcon, then allow the falcon to keep the prey until the falconer could retrieve it while the dog pointed at the catch. To this day the Small Münsterländer has excellent close searching and pointing drive. All privileges and immunities of the German nobility as a legally defined class were abolished on August 11, 1919, with the promulgation of the Weimar Constitution, recognising all Germans as equal before the laws of their country. With wider availability of guns and land use for commoners, hunting became more popular, and the breed was further developed as a retriever that worked equally well in the field and water. The breed is considered to be uniquely effective in working as a team with the huntsman in all phases of the hunt, akin to the close cooperation between a sheep herder and Border Collie. It is an elite hunter within the versatile hunting dog arena and is trained to retrieve, hunt, and track the following: woodcock, rail, grouse, dove, partridge, chukar, quail, pheasant, duck, goose, rabbit, deer and fox. The Small Münsterländer is not a far-ranging dog, usually hunting close in heavier cover and ranging 100-150 yards in light cover, all in an effort to maintain the hunting partnership with its owner.

The Small Münsterländer is one of the four oldest versatile breeds and the longhaired versatile hunting dogs evolved from the Small Münsterländer and Flat-Coated Retriever. The Small Münsterländer is thought to be well over 500 years old, originating from the Munster region of Germany but not related to the Large Münsterländer, and documentation of ancestors around the 13th and 14th centuries. By the 1800s the breed had fallen into obscurity. Small Munsterlanders were little known, kept by a few families on farms around Munster. For a half century the few dogs that were bred were primarily companions, and used when hunting to feed the family rather than for sport. It developed a local reputation as the dog to have when a hunter&#x27;s success or failure determined whether his family would have enough to eat. At the end of the 19th century, a concerted effort was made to re-establish the breed from the remaining lines in the Munster region. The fortunate outcome of the companion phase in the Small Münsterländer history was its excellent in-home personality. Cultural and wildlife use changes slowly put an end to the &quot;bread hunting&quot; and was replaced by recreational hunting. With the advance in firearms, falconry too became outmoded. At the turn of the century, Edmund Lons, brother of the famous hunting and nature poet Hermann Lons, discovered Small Münsterländers in two towns in Lower Saxony. Lons obtained dogs from two lines. One line consisted of fine boned, agile, lively and intelligent dogs, well known for their &quot;track sound&quot; on the trail. Dogs of the other line were slow in search, of strong build, and excellent in their use of nose. The background and breeding of these dogs could be traced for several generations.

==International popularity==

The Small Münsterländer is a rare breed in the United States, numbering around 2000, and demand from hunters outstrips the number of available dogs, so breeders typically give preference to hunters. They are especially hard to come by for non-hunters there and regardless are required to have their dog tested in the field and adhere to maintaining an updated health profile. They are more numerous in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and the Czech Republic and are bred, trained and tested to high standards to maintain the superior versatility.

Due to very low prevalence and high standards of the breed organizations, kennels and owners having a strong commitment to the health of the breed, breed programs are overwhelmingly very selective in breeding dogs and are required to maintain OFA/Penn Hip, CERF and temperament clear. As a result, instances of congenital diseases and conditions are extremely low.

In the United Kingdom, the breed is rarer still. Recognized by The Kennel Club as an imported breed in 2006, they are still to be established in the hunting community.

<text>The FIS Nordic World Ski Championships is a biennial Nordic skiing event organized by the International Ski Federation (FIS). The World Championships was started in 1925 for men and opened for women&#x27;s participation in 1954. World Championship events include Nordic skiing&#x27;s three disciplines: cross-country skiing, ski jumping, and Nordic combined (the latter being a combination sport consisting of both cross-country and ski jumping). The Winter Olympics from 1924 to 1980 were also the Nordic World Ski Championships (except in the Nordic combined events). This meant that the Olympic champions were also World champions and received an additional medal from the International Ski Federation (FIS). Since 1985, the World Championships have been held in odd-numbered years.

==History==
The first Nordic Skiing World Championships were held in Chamonix in 1924, as part of the first Winter Olympics, which were only later recognized as such. The competitions took place annually until 1939. From 1925 to 1927, the FIS referred to the events as &quot;Rendezvous races&quot;, while in the years after that until 1935 they were held as &quot;FIS races&quot;. Since 1937, the competitions have had the official title of &quot;FIS Nordic World Ski Championships&quot;. Until the 1980 Winter Olympics, the Olympic champions were also World champions, except in Nordic combined events.

The 1940 Nordic World Ski Championships were canceled due to the war, but this was also criticized at the time. The Italian winter sports resort of Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo organized the 1941 Nordic World Ski Championships. However, the FIS subsequently declared these invalid at a congress in Pau in 1946, so that the medals awarded lost their official status and were no longer counted.

With the 1984 Winter Olympics, the rule that the Olympic winners were also World champions was finally abandoned. Since 1985, the Nordic World Ski Championships have taken place in odd-numbered years, independently of the Winter Olympics, in order to avoid an overlap with the Olympics. 

The 1980 and 1984 World Championships consisted of a total of only three events; women&#x27;s 20 km cross-country (1980), ski-jumping team event and Nordic combined team event (both 1984). These events were not held in the 1980 Winter Olympics and 1984 Winter Olympics and therefore got their own World Championships.

<text>Charles Pratt and Company was an oil company that was formed in 1867 by Charles Pratt and Henry H. Rogers in Brooklyn, New York. It became part of John D. Rockefeller&#x27;s Standard Oil organization in 1874.

==History==
Pratt, born in Watertown, Massachusetts, had come to New York around 1850-1851, where he worked for a company specializing in paints and whale-oil products. Pratt became a pioneer of the natural oil industry, and established his kerosene refinery Astral Oil Works in Brooklyn. Pratt&#x27;s product later gave rise to the slogan, &quot;&quot;The holy lamps of Tibet are primed with Astral Oil&quot;.&quot;

In the mid-1860s, Pratt met two aspiring young men, Charles Ellis and Henry H. Rogers in western Pennsylvania. Pratt had bought whale-oil from Charles Ellis in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, the young men&#x27;s hometown. He purchased the entire future output of their small venture, Wamsutta Oil Refinery, at McClintocksville, near Oil City at a fixed price.

Ellis and Rogers had no wells and were dependent upon purchasing crude oil to refine and sell to Pratt. A few months later, crude oil prices suddenly increased due to manipulation by speculators. The young entrepreneurs and their Wamsutta Oil Refinery struggled to try to live up to their contract with Pratt, but soon their surplus was wiped out. Before long, they were heavily in debt to him.

Charles Ellis gave up, but in 1866, Henry Rogers went to Pratt in New York, and told him he would take personal responsibility for the entire debt. This so impressed Pratt that he immediately hired him for his own organization. In the next few years Rogers became, in the words of Elbert Hubbard, Pratt&#x27;s &quot;hands and feet and eyes and ears&quot; (&quot;Little Journeys to the Homes&quot;, 1909).

Pratt made Rogers foreman of his Brooklyn refinery, with a promise of a partnership if sales ran over fifty thousand dollars a year. Rogers and his wife Abbie moved to Brooklyn and lived frugally. Abbie brought his meals to the &quot;works&quot;; often he would sleep three hours a night rolled up in a blanket by the side of a still. Rogers moved steadily from foreman to manager, and then superintendent of Pratt&#x27;s Astral Oil Refinery. Pratt finally gave Rogers an interest in the business. In 1867, with Henry Rogers as a partner, he established the firm of Charles Pratt and Company.

In the early 1870s, Pratt and Rogers became involved in conflicts with John D. Rockefeller&#x27;s infamous South Improvement Company, which was basically a scheme to obtain favorable net rates from the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) and other railroads through a secret system of rebates. Rockefeller and the South Improvement Company scheme outraged independent oil producers in western Pennsylvania and refineries there and afar alike.

The opposition to the South Improvement Company scheme among the New York refiners was led by Rogers. The New York interests formed an association, and about the middle of March, 1872, sent a committee of three, with Rogers, of Charles Pratt and Company, as head, to Oil City to consult with the Oil Producers&#x27; Union there. Their arrival in the oil regions was a matter of great satisfaction. Working with the Pennsylvania independents, they managed to forge an agreement with the PRR and other railroads whose leaders eventually agreed to open rates to all promised to end their shady dealings with South Improvement. The oil men were most exultant, but their joy was to be short-lived, for Rockefeller had already begun forming his Standard Oil organization and was busy trying another approach, which included frequently buying up opposing interests.

Rockefeller approached Charles Pratt with his plans of cooperation and consolidation. Pratt talked it over with Rogers, and they decided that the combination would benefit them. Rogers formulated terms, which guaranteed financial security and jobs for Pratt and himself. John D. Rockefeller quietly accepted the offer on Rogers&#x27; exact terms. Charles Pratt and Company (including Astral Oil) became one of the important formerly independent refiners to join Rockefeller&#x27;s organization, and it was to become part of the Standard Oil Trust in 1874. Pratt&#x27;s son, Charles Millard Pratt (1858-1913) became Secretary of Standard Oil.

Pratts&#x27; protégé, Henry H. Rogers soon rose to become one of the key men of Standard Oil, and was a Vice-President by 1890. Rogers, who kept his residence in New York after moving there at Pratt&#x27;s request, invested outside of Standard Oil and became one of the wealthiest men in the world. He had interests in oil, gas, steel, copper, coal, and railroads, and eventually founded and built the Virginian Railway at the end of his own career.

Charles Pratt is credited with recognizing the growing need for trained industrial workers in a changing economy. In 1886, he founded and endowed the Pratt Institute, which opened in Brooklyn, New York in 1887.

Pratt settled in Glen Cove, Long Island, New York about 1890. In an effort to keep his family near him, he purchased large tracts of land surrounding his estate, totaling 1,100 acres (4.5 km²). However, he died the next year, 1891, in New York City.

At Glen Cove, on Long Island, Pratt&#x27;s six sons and two daughters later built their homes. As of 2004, most of the extant Pratt mansions along the Gold Coast there are still in use:

* Welwyn, originally the home of Harold I. Pratt, is now the Holocaust Memorial and Tolerance Center of Nassau County.
* The Braes, originally owned by Herbert L. Pratt, is now the Webb Institute of Naval Architecture.
* The Manor House, built for John Teele Pratt, is now the Glen Cove Mansion Hotel and Conference Center.
* Poplar Hill, the Frederic B. Pratt house, is now owned by Glengariff Nursing Home. 
* Killenworth, originally the house of George Dupont Pratt, is now the retreat for the Soviet Delegation to the United Nations.

The current Charles Pratt &amp; Co. exists, according to its website &quot;as a central administrative office providing professional financial services for the descendants of Charles Pratt and selected other private clients.&quot;

<text>Odo of Tournai, also known as Odoardus or Odo of Orléans (1060–1113), was a Benedictine monk, scholar and bishop of Cambrai (from 1105/6).

== Biography ==

Odo was born at Orléans. In 1087 he was invited by the canons of Tournai to teach in that city, and there soon won a great reputation. He became a Benedictine monk (1095) in St. Martin&#x27;s Abbey, Tournai, of which he became abbot later. In 1105 he was chosen Bishop of Cambrai, and was consecrated during a synod at Reims. For some time after he was unable to obtain possession of his see owing to his refusal to receive investiture at the hands of Emperor Henry IV, but the latter&#x27;s son Henry restored the See of Cambrai to Odo in 1106.

He laboured diligently for his diocese, but in 1110 he was exiled on the ground that he had never received the cross and ring from the emperor. Odo retired to Anchin Abbey, near Pecquencourt, where he died without regaining possession of his diocese.

==Works and translations==
Many of his works are lost; those extant are in Migne.

His treatise &quot;De peccato originali&quot; in three books, composed between 1095 and 1105, discuss the problem of universals, and of genera and species from a realist viewpoint.

<doc id="1280863" wikidata="Q1126229" url="?curid=1280863" title="Little Red Songbook">
<text>Since the founding of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), songs have played a large part in spreading the message of the One Big Union. The songs are preserved in the Little Red Songbook.

==Definition==
The &quot;Little Red Songbook&quot; (1909), also known as &quot;I.W.W. Songs&quot; or &quot;Songs of the Industrial Workers of the World&quot;, subtitled (in some editions) &quot;Songs to Fan the Flames of Discontent&quot;, is a compilation of tunes, hymns, and songs used by the Industrial Workers of the World (I.W.W.) to help build morale, promote solidarity, and lift the spirits of the working-class during the Labor Movement.

==History==
The &quot;Little Red Songbook&quot; was first published by a committee of Spokane, Washington IWW members in 1909. It was originally called &quot;Songs of the Workers, on the Road, in the Jungles, and in the Shops—Songs to Fan the Flames of Discontent&quot;. It includes songs written by Joe Hill, Harry McClintock (Spellbinder), Ralph Chaplin, T-Bone Slim, and others. The early editions contain many of the most well-known labor songs, such as &quot;The Red Flag,&quot; &quot;The Internationale,&quot; &quot;The Preacher and the Slave,&quot; and &quot;Solidarity Forever.&quot; Thirty-six editions were published between 1909 and 1995.

A &quot;Canadian I.W.W. Songbook&quot;, compiled and edited by Jerzy (George) Dymny, featuring 41 songs with a Canadian slant, was published in 1990.

An edition commemorating the centennial of the IWW&#x27;s founding in 1905 was published in 2005. The latest edition of the &quot;Little Red Songbook&quot; was printed in 2010.

The 190 different songs included in the &quot;Little Red Songbook&quot; between 1909 and 1973 are collected and annotated in &quot;The Big Red Songbook&quot;, edited by Archie Green, David Roediger, and Franklin Rosemont and published in 2007.

<text>Constance Money (born Susan Jensen; November 30, 1956) is an American former adult film actress. She played the lead role of Misty Beethoven in the 1976 adult classic &quot;The Opening of Misty Beethoven&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Susan Jensen was born in Kenmore, Washington, where she was a cheerleader and acted at Inglemoor High School; she studied psychology and sociology at Mills College in Oakland, California.

==Adult film career==
After first appearing in pornographic films while in college, under the name Jennifer Baker, as Constance Money she played the lead role of the lowly Parisian prostitute reshaped by a sexologist to reach the top tier of her profession in Henry Paris (Radley Metzger)&#x27;s 1976 pornographic parody of Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, &quot;The Opening of Misty Beethoven&quot;. She later said in an interview that she had expected it to be an R-rated movie and that the film reflected her actual sexual education during production: &quot;&quot;Misty&quot; is a good movie because it is real.&quot;

Following the film&#x27;s success, she made several appearances as a porn star, including stays at the Playboy Mansion, and appeared in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine in July 1977 in a photo feature on &quot;The New Girls of Porn&quot; and a 1978 personal photo spread, titled &quot;Call of the Wild&quot;, which portrayed her as leading a double life starring in adult films and running a hostelry in a remote part of Alaska.
Her subsequent appearances include &quot;Mary! Mary!&quot; and &quot;Obsessed&quot; (both 1977), and &quot;Taste of Money&quot; (1983), her last pornographic film, which is about her return to porn after a hiatus. Her co-star was frequently John Leslie, a friend with whom she lived for a while.

During shooting of &quot;Misty Beethoven&quot;, Jensen had objected to work she considered in excess of her contract and claimed damages for stolen possessions; she subsequently sued Metzger over his reuse of material shot for that film, particularly in &quot;Barbara Broadcast&quot; and &quot;Maraschino Cherry&quot;. The parties settled out of court in 1979. It has been reported that Metzger gave her the alias Constance Money because of her demands for money, but Metzger denied it.

She was inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame in 1998 and into the XRCO Hall of Fame as a film pioneer in 2016.

==Subsequent career==
Encouraged by Hugh Hefner to try to cross over into mainstream film, she had a small part in Blake Edwards&#x27; 1979 film &quot;10&quot; and unsuccessfully sought the lead role in &quot;Frances&quot; (1982); the producers were unwilling to consider a star with a background in pornography. She retired from acting to the Pacific Northwest.

The Tarn separates the Narbonne and Aquitaine basins.

==Departments and cities==

The Tarn passes through the following departments and towns:
*Lozère: Le Pont-de-Montvert, Sainte-Enimie
*Aveyron: Millau
*Tarn: Albi, Gaillac, Lisle-sur-Tarn, Rabastens
*Haute-Garonne: Villemur-sur-Tarn
*Tarn-et-Garonne: Montauban, Moissac.

The Millau Viaduct, the tallest bridge in the world, carrying the A75 autoroute across the Tarn Gorge near Millau, opened in December 2004.

The Tarn is famous for its brutal floods, which are the most dangerous in Europe along with the Danube. The floods of March 1930 saw the Tarn rise more than above its normal level in Montauban in just 24 hours, with a discharge of (the average discharge of the Rhine is ; the average discharge of the Nile during the traditional annual flooding before the building of the Aswan Dam was ; the average discharge of the Mississippi River is ). One third of the Tarn-et-Garonne department was flooded, about 300 people died, thousands of houses were destroyed, the low-lying districts of Montauban were destroyed, and the town of Moissac was almost entirely destroyed.

==Navigation==

The Tarn was once navigable from its junction with the Garonne to Corbarieu, near Montauban. This stretch of river included seven river locks over a distance of . The canal was linked to the Canal de Garonne in Moissac by a branch lock upstream of the first river lock, and again, via the Canal de Montech, at Montauban.

The two access points from the Canal de Garonne have both been restored, and boats can again access the immediate reaches of the river at these points. Additionally the first river lock, between Moissac and the Garonne itself, has been flooded by the barrage for the Golfech power station on the Garonne, and is permanently open to boats which can thus reach the Garonne and navigate a short distance of that river.

The remaining six river locks are disused and unnavigable. A proposal exists to restore the five river locks between Moissac and Montauban, thus creating a waterway ring consisting of the Tarn from Moissac to Montauban, the Canal de Montech to Montech and the Canal de Garonne back to Moissac.

<text>Boris Christoff (, ; 18 May 1914 – 28 June 1993) was a Bulgarian opera singer, widely considered one of the greatest basses of the 20th century.

== Early life ==
He was born in Plovdiv on 18 May 1914 to parents Kyryl Christov and Rayna Teodorova. His grand-father Hristo Sovichanov had been a famous cantor at Bitola (then in the Ottoman Empire). Where he was singing in the Bulgarian Exarchist church, during the service many other believers (Turks, Jews) gathered in front of the church entrance to listen to him. Being also a Bulgarian revolutionary, as well as his son Kyryl, after the defeat of the Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising, they moved to Bulgaria. All three of Hristo&#x27;s children were good singers, Kyryl (Boris Christoff&#x27;s father) was a tenor, sang at secular and church choirs, sang also for Radio Sofia and for the Institute of Music at the BAS. 

Boris Christoff demonstrated early his singing talent and sang at the famous choir Gusla. In 1938 he graduated in law and started a career as a magistrate. He continued singing in his spare time in the Gusla Chorus in Sofia, achieving an enormous success as the chorus soloist in 1940; he was also singing at the choir of the St. Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Sofia and the Academic Choir. Thanks to a government grant, Christoff left in May 1942 for Italy where he was tutored for two years in the core Italian bass repertoire by the great baritone of an earlier generation, Riccardo Stracciari.

== Performance career ==
After two visits in Bulgaria in 1943, Boris Christoff went to Austria. He took lessons in Wien, Prague and Salzbourg and had several guest appearances and recitals in Wien and Dresden. In 1944 he was arrested and sent to a prison camp near Feldkirch. He was released from it in May 1945 by the French troops. The commanding colonel, having heard his singing, helped him go to Italy. Later, Boris Hristov made every effort to find this person (&quot;He was my savior!&quot;), but to no avail.

His first concert in Italy was in December 1945 in Rome with the Symphony orchestra of the Santa Cecilia Academy of Music, and was dedicated to Bulgarian and Russian music. Christoff made his operatic debut as Colline in &quot;La bohème&quot; at Reggio Calabria on 12 March 1946. In following years Christoff appeared in a number of roles at Milan&#x27;s La Scala, Venice&#x27;s La Fenice, the Rome Opera, Covent Garden in London, the opera theatres in Naples, Barcelona, Lisbon, Rio de Janeiro, etc.

In 1950 he was invited to sing at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City but was refused entry into the USA as a result of the McCarran Immigration Act, which banned citizens of Eastern bloc countries from entering the country. The role was instead filled by the young Italian basso, Cesare Siepi. After the restrictions were loosened, Christoff made an operatic debut in the United States in 1956 at the San Francisco Opera. He refused any further invitations to the Metropolitan and never appeared there. After a brief absence from the scene due to brain tumour surgery in 1964, Christoff resumed his career.
In the 1970s Christoff on-stage performances became more infrequent. In St. Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Sofia he recorded bulgarian and russian religious chants, together with the choir of the cathedral and the conductor Angel Popkonstantinov. Boris Christoff took an active part in the very work of creating the record. In 1978, he again recorded in the same cathedral Liturgia Domestica by Alexander Grechaninov, with the participation of the Bulgarian Choir Chapel Svetoslav Obretenov and a small string ensemble from the Symphony Orchestra of the Bulgarian Radio and conductor Georgi Robev. This is the first recording in the world of the Domestic Liturgy, and for the first time an orchestra was included in its performance, albeit a small one.

He brought his career to an end with a final concert at the Accademia di Bulgaria in Rome on 22 June 1986. He died in Rome in 1993 and his body was returned to Bulgaria, lay in repose in St. Alexander Nevski Cathedral and was buried in section 46 of Sofia Central Cemetery.

== Voice, repertoire, character ==

Boris Christoff had an excellent voice with a distinctive dark tone. Although it was not as large as some other bass voices, he had no trouble making an impact in big spaces like the San Francisco Opera. Owing to his stage presence and dramatic temperament, he was a worthy heir to the grand tradition of Slavonic basses exemplified by Fyodor Stravinsky, Lev Sibiriakov, Vladimir Kastorsky, Feodor Chaliapin, Alexander Kipnis and Mark Reizen, among others. He sang mostly in Verdi and the Russian repertoire, and was also a refined performer of vocal chamber music. Among his most famous roles were those of Tsar Boris (Mussorgsky - &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;), Philip II (Verdi - &quot;Don Carlo&quot;), Mephistopheles (Gounod - &quot;Faust&quot; and Boito - &quot;Mefistofele&quot;), Ivan Susanin (Glinka - &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot;), Zaccaria (Verdi - &quot;Nabucco&quot;), Tsar Ivan (Rimsky-Korsakov - &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot;), Dosifei (Mussorgsky - &quot;Khovanshchina&quot;), Gomez da Silva (Verdi - &quot;Ernani&quot;), Fiesco (Verdi - &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;), Attila (Verdi - &quot;Attila&quot;), Padre Guardiano (Verdi - &quot;La forza del destino&quot;), Galitzky and Kontchak (Borodin - &quot;Prince Igor&quot;) and others.

Christoff made studio recordings of eight operas (&quot;Don Carlo&quot;, &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; and &quot;Faust&quot; twice each) and numerous live recordings (radio or stage performances). He was much admired as song singer and he recorded more than 200 Russian songs by Mussorgsky (he was the first to record all his 63 songs), Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Glinka, Borodin, Cui, Balakirev as well as traditional songs, mostly with piano accompaniment.

He made the tradition of studio recordings of &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; with the same basso singing three roles (Boris, Varlaam, Pimen). In 1952, he participated in the widely known recording of this opera in Paris, in which at the suggestion of the conductor Issay Dobrowen he performed all three bass roles—Boris Godunov, Varlaam and Pimen— three very diverse roles, which he distinguished characteristically and, according to musicologist Marcel Clavery, their only common feature was the beauty of the singer&#x27;s timbre. The recording brought Boris Hristov his first high award—the grand international prize for a gramophone record (1953). In 1963 he was invited for the second time to record &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; in Paris, again performing all three bass roles. Нe suggested that the choir of the Sofia Opera be invited as well. An EMI representative was sent for an audition in Sofia, who was convinced of Boris Hristov&#x27;s judgement, and so the choir took part in the recording conducted by André Cluytens, called triumphal.

While he was a grand performer on stage, Christoff had difficult off-stage relations with some fellow singers and producers, which sometimes grew into public scandals. In 1955 he fell out with Maria Callas during the performances of &quot;Medea&quot; at the Rome Opera. In 1961 his contract with La Scala was terminated after an open conflict with fellow Bulgarian Nicolai Ghiaurov. In fact, Boris Christoff opened the way for the Bulgarian singers Nikolay Ghiaurov and Dimitar Uzunov to La Scala—it is entirely his merit to attract them as his partners in &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;. The ambitious Ghiaurov, whose brother Kostadin Ghiaurov was a senior functionary of the Bulgarian Communist Party, began to speak out against him and call him a &quot;fascist&quot;, and Boris Christoff blamed him for collaborating with the Bulgarian communist regime. The communist regime&#x27;s hatred for Christoff who was not even allowed to go to Bulgaria for his father&#x27;s funeral pushed Ghiaurov further into rivalry with Christoff. Herbert von Karajan tried to make Boris Christoff sing the title role in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; which would have been inappropriate for his range; this prompted him to sever relations with von Karajan.

He was the brother-in-law of the Italian baritone Tito Gobbi.

<doc id="1280878" wikidata="Q3760499" url="?curid=1280878" title="George Gilder">
<text>George Franklin Gilder (; born November 29, 1939) is an American investor, author, economist, and co-founder of the Discovery Institute. His 1981 book, &quot;Wealth and Poverty&quot;, advanced a case for supply-side economics and capitalism during the early months of the Reagan administration. He is the chairman of George Gilder Fund Management, LLC.

==Early life and education==
Gilder was born in New York City and raised in New York and Massachusetts.
His father, Richard Watson Gilder II, was killed flying in the United States Army Air Forces in World War II when Gilder was two years old.
He is a great-grandson of designer Louis Comfort Tiffany.

He spent most of his childhood with his mother, Anne Spring Denny (Alsop), and his stepfather, Gilder Palmer, on a dairy farm in Tyringham, Massachusetts. Palmer, a college roommate of his father, was deeply involved with his upbringing, 
as was the family of David Rockefeller, his godfather.

Gilder attended Hamilton School in New York City, Phillips Exeter Academy, and Harvard University, graduating in 1962. 
He later returned to Harvard as a fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics, and edited the &quot;Ripon Forum&quot;, the newspaper of the liberal Republican Ripon Society.

== Marine Corps==
Gilder served in the United States Marine Corps.
==Career==
===Speechwriting===
In the 1960s Gilder served as a speechwriter for several prominent officials and candidates, including Nelson Rockefeller, George W. Romney, and Richard Nixon. He worked as a spokesman for the liberal Republican Senator Charles Mathias, as anti-war protesters surrounded the capital; some eventually scared Gilder out of his apartment. Gilder moved to Harvard Square the following year, and he became a writer who modeled himself after Joan Didion.

With his college roommate, Bruce Chapman, he wrote an attack on the anti-intellectual policies of the 1964 Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, &quot;The Party That Lost Its Head&quot; (1966). He later recanted this attack: &quot;The far Right — the same men I dismissed as extremists in my youth — turned out to know far more than I did. At least the &#x27;right-wing extremists&#x27;, as I confidently called them, were right on almost every major policy issue from welfare to Vietnam to Keynesian economics and defense — while I, in my Neo-Conservative sophistication, was nearly always wrong.&quot;

===Supply-side economics===
Supply-side economics was formulated in the mid-1970s by Jude Wanniski and Robert L. Bartley at &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; as a counterweight to the reigning &quot;demand-side&quot; Keynesian economics. At the center of the concept was the Laffer curve, the idea that high tax rates reduce government revenue.

Gilder wrote a book extending the ideas of his &quot;Visible Man&quot; (1978) into the realm of economics, to balance his theory of poverty with a theory of wealth. The book, published as the best-selling &quot;Wealth and Poverty&quot; in 1981, communicated the ideas of supply-side economics to a wide audience in the United States and the world.

Gilder also contributed to the development of supply-side economics when he served as Chairman of the Lehrman Institute&#x27;s Economic Roundtable, as Program Director for the Manhattan Institute, and as a frequent contributor to Laffer&#x27;s economic reports and the editorial page of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

===Technology===
In the 1990s, he became an evangelist of technology and the Internet. He discussed emerging trends in several books and his newsletter, the Gilder Technology Report.

The first mention of the word &quot;Digerati&quot; on USENET occurred in 1992 and referred to an article by Gilder in &quot;Upside&quot; magazine. His other books include &quot;Life After Television&quot;, a 1990 book that predicted microchip &quot;telecomputers&quot; connected by fiberoptic cable would make broadcast-model television obsolete. The book was also notable for being published by the Federal Express company and featuring full-page advertisements for that company on every fifth page.

Gilder wrote the books &quot;Microcosm&quot;, about Carver Mead and the CMOS microchip revolution; &quot;Telecosm&quot;, about the promise of fiber optics; and &quot;The Silicon Eye&quot;, about the Foveon X3 sensor, a digital camera imager chip. The book cover of the Silicon Eye reads, &quot;How a Silicon Valley Company Aims to Make All Current Computers, Cameras, and Cell Phones Obsolete.&quot; The Foveon sensor has not achieved this goal and has not yet been used in cell phones.

Gilder is an investor in private companies and serves as the chairman of the advisory board in Israel-based ASOCS that he discovered during his research for &quot;Israel Test&quot;.

===On women and feminism===
In the early 1970s, Gilder wrote an article in the &quot;Ripon Forum&quot; defending President Richard Nixon&#x27;s veto of a day-care bill sponsored by Senator Walter Mondale (D-Minnesota) and Senator Jacob Javits (R-New York). He was fired as editor as a result. To defend himself, he appeared on &quot;Firing Line&quot;.

Gilder moved to New Orleans and worked in the mornings for Ben Toledano, Republican candidate for the United States Senate in 1972 and the party&#x27;s nominee for mayor of New Orleans in 1970. He also wrote &quot;Sexual Suicide&quot; (1973), which was revised and reissued as &quot;Men and Marriage&quot; (1986). The book achieved a &quot;succès de scandale&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; made Gilder &quot;Male Chauvinist Pig of the Year.&quot;

===Support for immigration===
Gilder has praised mass immigration as an economic boon in both the US and Israel. Although Gilder&#x27;s support for mass immigration is framed by high tech hubs such as Silicon Valley&#x27;s need for computer programmers, he sees recent American immigration policy as being vital to American prosperity overall.

===&quot;The American Spectator&quot;===
Gilder bought the conservative political monthly magazine &quot;The American Spectator&quot; from its founder, Emmett Tyrrell, in the summer of 2000, switching the magazine&#x27;s focus from politics to technology.

Experiencing his own financial problems in 2002,
Gilder sold the &quot;Spectator&quot; back to Tyrrell.

===Speaking engagements and editorial contributions===
Gilder lectures internationally on economics, technology, education, and social theory. He has addressed audiences from Washington, D.C., to the Vatican, and he has appeared at conferences, public policy events, and media outlets.

==&quot;Wealth and Poverty&quot;==
After completing &quot;Visible Man&quot; in the late 1970s, Gilder began writing &quot;The Pursuit of Poverty.&quot; In early 1981, Basic Books published the result as &quot;Wealth and Poverty&quot;. It was an analysis of the roots of economic growth. Reviewing it within a month of the inauguration of the Reagan Administration, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer called it &quot;A Guide to Capitalism&quot;. It offered, he wrote, &quot;a creed for capitalism worthy of intelligent people.&quot; The book was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller, and eventually sold over a million copies.

In &quot;Wealth and Poverty&quot;, Gilder extended the sociological and anthropological analysis of his early books in which he had advocated for the socialization of men into service to women through work and marriage. He wove these sociological themes into the economic policy prescriptions of supply-side economics. In his eyes the breakup of the nuclear family and the policies of demand-side economics led to poverty, while family and supply-side policies led to wealth.

In reviewing the problems of the immediate past—the inflation, recession, and urban problems of the 1970s—and proposing his supply-side solutions, Gilder argued not just the practical but the moral superiority of supply-side capitalism over the alternatives. &quot;Capitalism begins with giving,&quot; he asserted, while New Deal liberalism created moral hazard. It was work, family, and faith that created wealth out of poverty. &quot;It is this supply-side moral vision that underlies all the economic arguments of &quot;Wealth and Poverty,&quot;&quot; he wrote.

In 1994, Gilder wrote that the poor in America are &quot;ruined by the overflow of American prosperity&quot; and &quot;moral decay&quot; and that they are in need of &quot;Christian teaching from the churches.&quot;

==Intelligent design==
In 1991 Gilder cofounded the Discovery Institute with Bruce Chapman.
The organization started as a moderate group that aimed to privatize and modernize Seattle&#x27;s transit systems. It later became the leading thinktank of the intelligent design movement, with Gilder writing many articles for intelligent design and against the theory of evolution.

<text>Johannes Clauberg (24 February 1622 – 31 January 1665) was a German theologian and philosopher. Clauberg was the founding Rector of the first University of Duisburg, where he taught from 1655 to 1665. He is known as a &quot;scholastic cartesian&quot;.

== Biography ==

He was born in Solingen, and educated in the Aristotelian tradition in Köln, Moers and Bremen, then in Groningen, where he discovered what came to be called the reformed variation of Aristotelianism. He gave his first disputations in Groningen under the supervision of Tobias Andreae. His first treatise in metaphysics was written in those student years: &quot;Elementa philosophiae sive Ontosophia&quot; (1647). Travelling in France and England, he came to study the Cartesian philosophy under Johannes de Raey at Leiden. In 1649, he became professor of philosophy and theology at Herborn, but subsequently (1651), in consequence of the jealousy of his colleagues, accepted an invitation to a similar post at Duisburg.

Clauberg was one of the earliest teachers of the new doctrines in Germany and an exact and methodical commentator on his masters writings. His theory of the connection between the soul and the body is in some respects analogous to that of Malebranche; but he is not therefore to be regarded as a true forerunner of Occasionalism, as he uses Occasion for the stimulus which directly produces a mental phenomenon, without postulating the intervention of God. His view of the relation of God to his creatures is held to foreshadow the pantheism of Spinoza. All creatures exist only through the continuous creative energy of the Divine Being, and are no more independent of his will than are our thoughts independent of us, or rather less, for there are thoughts which force themselves upon us whether we will or not.

Metaphysics, in Clauberg&#x27;s conception, studies not the being (ens), but the intelligible, as in the most general object of the intellect (&quot;ens cogitabile&quot;). The most high concept is not being, but the object in general as known to the intellect. For metaphysics Clauberg suggested the names &quot;ontosophy or ontology&quot;, the latter being afterwards adopted by Wolff. In the prolegomena to his &quot;Elementa philosophiae sive Ontosophiae&quot; (1647), Clauberg says:

Étienne Gilson writes:

Clauberg died in Duisburg, and lies buried in the city&#x27;s cathedral.

<text>A cooking apple or culinary apple is an apple that is used primarily for cooking, as opposed to a &quot;dessert apple&quot;, which is eaten raw. Cooking apples are generally larger, and can be tarter than dessert varieties. Some varieties have a firm flesh that does not break down much when cooked. Culinary varieties with a high acid content produce froth when cooked, which is desirable for some recipes. Britain grows a large range of apples specifically for cooking. Worldwide, dual-purpose varieties (for both cooking and eating raw) are more widely grown.

There are many apples that have been cultivated to have the firmness and tartness desired for cooking. Yet each variety of apple has unique qualities and categories such as &quot;cooking&quot; or &quot;eating&quot; are suggestive, rather than exact. 

How an apple will perform once cooked is tested by simmering a half inch wedge in water until tender, then prodding to see if its shape is intact. The apple can then be tasted to see how its flavour has been maintained and if sugar should be added.

Apples can be cooked down into sauce, apple butter, or fruit preserves. They can be baked in an oven and served with custard, and made into pies or apple crumble. In the UK roast pork is commonly served with cold apple sauce made from boiled and mashed apples.

A baked apple is baked in an oven until it has become soft. The core is usually removed before baking and the resulting cavity stuffed with fruits, brown sugar, raisins, or cinnamon, and sometimes a liquor such as brandy. An apple dumpling adds a pastry crust.

<text>The A75 is an &quot;autoroute&quot; (motorway) in France.

Known also as &quot;la Méridienne&quot;, it is a developmental project with the aim of speeding up and reducing the cost of car travel from Paris southwards, and apart from the Millau Viaduct, it is entirely free for the between Clermont-Ferrand and Béziers. It was due for completion in spring 2011, but was fully open in December 2010.

South of St. Flour there are excellent views of the Garabit viaduct.

A large portion of the A75 is also part of the European route E11.

==Engineering achievements==


The building of a motorway across the Massif Central is, in itself, a formidable achievement. Much of the motorway runs at an altitude in excess of with in excess of .

The single most impressive feature is undoubtedly the Millau Viaduct, which carries the road over the Tarn. It was constructed under a government contract with the Eiffage group, effective for 75 years. Eiffage collects tolls at agreed rates making this the only tolled part of the A75.

Other impressive features include:
Viaducts and bridges
* Viaduc de la Violette, long, between junctions 21 &amp; 22
* Pont sur la Truyère, long, between junctions 30 and 31
* Viaduc du Piou, long, between junctions 38 and 39
* Viaduc du Ricoulong, long, between junctions 38 and 39
* Viaduc de la Planchette, long, between junctions 38 and 39
* Viaduc de Verrières, long, between junctions 44 and 44.1
* Viaduc de la Garrigue, long, between junctions 44.1 and 42
* Viaduc de Millau, long, between junctions 45 and 46

Passes
* between junctions 24 and 25
* Col de la Fageole, , between junctions 26 and 27
* Col des Issartets, , the highest point on the A75, between junctions 36 and 37
* Col de la Fagette, , between junctions 40 and 41
* Col d&#x27;Engayresque, , between junctions 44 and 44.1

Tunnels
* Tunnel de Montjezieu, , long at an altitude of , between junctions 39.1 and 40
* Tunnel de Pas d&#x27;Escalette, southbound, northbound, between junctions 50 and 51
* Tunnel de la Vierge, , between junctions 52 and 53

==The route==
:† &quot;The section between junctions 59 and 61 (the Pézenas by-pass) was not technically motorway and was still designated as the N9, despite the depiction on most maps. Work to upgrade the section to full motorway status was carried out between September 2013 and June 2014.&quot;

In May 2007, construction started on the final section of the A75, a connection from Pézenas to the A9 autoroute a kilometre or so east of the previous Béziers east intersection 35. The route to the south of the present D609 Pézenas-Béziers road bypassing Valros opened in February 2009. Further sections opened in spring 2010. The final section, a gap between Valros and Servian, was completed in December 2010. According to Serge Cuculière, construction operations manager, the delay was due to difficulties encountered on the section (&quot;Les difficultés recontrées sur la section exigent un temps de réalisation plus important&quot;).

<text>Johannes Guillaume Christianus Andreas &quot;Jan&quot; Marijnissen () (born 8 October 1952) is a retired Dutch politician of the Socialist Party (SP).

Marijnissen, a welder by occupation, was selected as Leader of the Socialist Party after the death of Daan Monjé on 1 October 1986 and became Chairman of the Socialist Party on 20 May 1988. For the election of 1994 Marijnissen was the Lijsttrekker (top candidate) and won two seats in the House of Representatives, the first time the Socialist Party won representation in the States General of the Netherlands. Marijnissen was elected as a Member of the House of Representatives on 17 May 1994 and became the Parliamentary leader of the Socialist Party in the House of Representatives. For the elections of 1998 and 2002 Marijnissen again as Lijsttrekker won three and four seats respectively. For the election of 2006 Marijnissen for the fifth time as Lijsttrekker won sixteen seats and the Socialist Party became the third-largest party in the House of Representatives. On 20 June 2008 Marijnissen announced his retirement as Leader of the Socialist Party and Parliamentary leader of the Socialist Party in the House of Representatives citing health reasons. Marijnissen remained a Member of the House of Representatives until after the 2010 general election. Marijnissen stood down as Chairman of the Socialist Party on 28 November 2015.

He is the father of Lilian Marijnissen, a former Leader of the Socialist Party.

==Early life==
Johannes Guillaume Christianus Andreas Marijnissen was born on 8 October 1952 in Oss in the Dutch Province of North Brabant in a Roman Catholic family. After leaving secondary school shortly before the exams, he worked in a number of factories in and around Oss. He then trained as a welder, working for ten years in the metal industry.

==Politics==
===Local politics===
Meanwhile, he helped founding the SP in Oss and, in 1975, became the Netherlands&#x27; youngest councillor ever. He remained a councillor until 1993, playing a leading role in many campaigns, such as against polluting discharges. The SP&#x27;s council representation in Oss has grown at every local election and is, as of 2005, the biggest stronghold of the Socialist Party in the Netherlands. Nicknamed &quot;The Wizard of Oss&quot;, after his hometown, he became famous when he turned out to be one of the main architects of the Dutch vote that rejected the European Constitution in June 2005.

In 1987 Marijnissen became the party&#x27;s first ever provincial assembly member, in North Brabant. A year later he became the SP&#x27;s national president. Under his leadership the party was transformed from &quot;a federation of local branches&quot; into a party with a clear national programme, nationally-organised activities and a national profile.

===National politics===
Beginning in 1994, when the SP made the breakthrough which brought it into the House of Representatives, Marijnissen was chairman of the party&#x27;s parliamentary group. After gaining two out of the 150 parliamentary seats during this first breakthrough, support for him and his party rose slowly but continuously. After four years in parliament, his Socialist Party went under his lead from two to five seats during the national elections of 1998, which was followed by a growth towards nine seats in 2002.

In 2003, after the 87-day term of Balkenende I, the Socialist Party didn&#x27;t manage to gain more seats than the year before and stayed at the same level with again 9 out of 150 seats. Although there was a slight rise in number of people who voted for the SP compared to a year before, a few weeks before the elections the polls suggested the SP might double.

After the 2004 elections a conflict arose between Jan Marijnissen and Ali Lazrak, when the latter refused to conform to an agreement that required all SP politicians to donate part of their wages. Lazrak accused Marijnissen of dictatorial behavior; an attempt to settle the argument failed and Lazrak left the fraction on 2 February 2004.

In February 2006 the party was polled on 9.5% of the electorate in the municipal elections. After the untimely end of Balkenende II and the minority government of Balkenende III, the SP won 16 more seats in the 2006 elections to a total of 25, becoming the third party of the Netherlands. Soon after, the party membership passed 50,000.

In 2006 a majority of members of parliament voted for his idea to build a National Historic Museum in the Netherlands. In 2007 the Minister of Culture decided the city Arnhem would be its residence.

On 17 June 2008 Marijnissen announced his resignation as chairman of the SP group in the House of Representatives because of health reasons. However, he remains a member of the House of Representatives and chairman of the Socialist Party.

Marijnissen was said to appeal to the &#x27;common man&#x27; because of his use of simple language. His appeal is also explained by some observers by his capacity of presenting himself as a valid, more social alternative to the PvdA, which moved into a more centrist third way direction by advocating welfare reforms under the leadership of Prime Minister Wim Kok and his so-called Purple Cabinets (1994–2002).

Critics of Marijnissen call his leadership style authoritarian, because he is presumed to have a tight grip on his party.

<text>Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev (, lit. &quot;Ze&#x27;ev&#x27;s Peak&quot;) is an Israeli settlement in East Jerusalem and the largest residential neighborhood in Jerusalem with a population of over 50,000. Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev was established by Israel as one of the city&#x27;s five Ring Neighborhoods on land effectively annexed after the 1967 Six-Day War.

The international community considers Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.

Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev is situated east of Shuafat and Beit Hanina, west of Hizma, south of Neve Yaakov, and north of &#x27;Anata and the Shuafat refugee camp. The Israeli West Bank barrier includes Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev in the northern section of Jerusalem while excluding Shuafat refugee camp from the city by running in an S-shape here.

==History==

===Antiquity===
Archeological evidence shows that in the biblical period, the site encompassed small agricultural villages along routes north from Jerusalem to Nablus and the Galilee. The villages made use of varied water-catchment strategies and served the needs of Israelite Jerusalem, including as a major producer of wine and oil for use in the Temple in Jerusalem. Three ritual baths from the Second Temple period have been excavated in Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev.

The Byzantine period saw the villages&#x27; primary use shift from agriculture to service religious functions, such as churches and monasteries. A large monastery from the period was located at the site&#x27;s highest point, Ras at-Tawill. The monastery was likely active from the end of the 5th century to the close of the 8th century, and included a mosaic-floored chapel above a burial cave, as well as an oil press and a cloth bag of 200 coins. An oven and pots from the Iron Age were also found nearby.

An archaeological site known as &quot;Deir Ghazali&quot; (the Deer Monastery) was also excavated in eastern Pisgat Ze’ev.

Overlooking the neighborhood is Tell el-Ful, believed to be the capital of the Tribe of Judah and site of the Israelite King Saul&#x27;s palace. King Hussein of Jordan began constructing a palace there in the mid-1960s.

===Modern era===
In the 1930s, plots of land were purchased near Hizme by European Jews for the establishment of a Jewish farming cooperative, Havatzelet Binyamin. Most of the landowners died in the Holocaust. The land was later expropriated along with Palestinian land to build Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev.

Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev was established in 1982 on land annexed to Israel after the 1967 Six-Day War as one of the city&#x27;s five Ring Neighborhoods, meant to create a contiguous Jewish link with Neve Yaakov in the city&#x27;s north, which had been isolated from other Jewish areas. The original name proposal was &quot;Pisgat Tal,&quot; based on the Arabic name of the hilltop where construction was to begin, &quot;Ras at-Tawill&quot;, but the final choice was Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev, after the Revisionist Zionist leader, Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky.

According to ARIJ, Israel confiscated land from several surrounding Palestinian communities in order to construct Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev:

*1,458 dunams from Beit Hanina,
*686 dunams from Beit Hanina for the Pisgat Amir neighbourhood in Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev,
*239 dunams from Shuafat,
*89 dunams from Hizma.

In May 2003, a public bus leaving the Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev terminus was blown up by a Palestinian suicide bomber. Seven people were killed in the attack and dozens were wounded. The police said the bomber boarded the bus disguised as a religious Jew, wearing a kippa and a prayer shawl. One of the victims was a resident of the Shuafat refugee camp, on his way to work at the Hadassah Medical Center in Ein Kerem.

==Geography==

The neighborhood was established on a hilltop known in Arabic as &quot;Ras at-Tawill&quot;, 772 meters above sea level, and its additional construction phases descend along the ridge and up to a neighboring hill. Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev has five districts: Center (1984), West (1988), East and North (1990), and South (1998). Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev is situated in north Jerusalem to the east of Shuafat and Beit Hanina, west of Hizma, south of Neve Yaakov, and north of French Hill, &#x27;Anata and the Shuafat refugee camp. It is due east of the watershed on the edge of the Judean Desert.

==Demographics==
In 2017, Pisgat Zeev had a population of 42,300. In 2007 it was reported to have about 1,300 of which were Arabs. Many residents of Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev are Jerusalem families that left the city center in search of more affordable housing. Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev has a mixed population of religious and secular Jews. The construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier has also prompted Arabs to move to Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev.

==Status under international law==

The international community considers Israeli settlements in the Israeli-occupied territories, including East Jerusalem, to violate the Fourth Geneva Convention&#x27;s prohibition on the transfer of a civilian population into occupied territory and thus illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. Israel disputes that the Fourth Geneva Convention applies to these territories as they had not been legally held by a sovereign prior to Israel taking control of them. This view has been rejected by the International Court of Justice and the International Committee of the Red Cross.

==Schools and public buildings==
With 40 percent of the residents under the age of 21, Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev has 58 kindergartens, 9 elementary schools, 2 middle schools and 3 high schools. There are also 22 synagogues and 2 libraries.

==Transportation==
Moshe Dayan Boulevard, beginning at Highway 1 (Israel/Palestine) in the south and ending in Neve Yaakov in the north, is named after the famed Israeli Army general. It is Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev&#x27;s major commercial thoroughfare, including many shops, eateries and the Pisga Mall.

Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev is located on the Jerusalem Light Rail line. Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev Center is two stations away from the northern terminus.

Many of the street names in Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev commemorate leading Israeli personalities such as Simcha Holtzberg, Moshe Rachmilewitz, Eliyahu Meridor and Meir Gershon. In the center of Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev, many streets are named for Israel Defense Forces units that fought in the country&#x27;s wars such as Sayeret Duchifat Blvd., HaSayeret HaYerushalmit St., Sayeret Golani St. and Hel HaAvir St. A memorial for fallen soldiers is located in an archeological park in central Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev.

==Environmental projects==
With the help of the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel (SPNI), the residents of Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev transformed a site used as an illegal dumping ground into a wildflower sanctuary with over 55 species of trees and plants.

In 2011, an innovative water-recycling project was introduced at the ritual bath in Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev which will make it unnecessary to change the water every day. In 2011, rainwater collection tanks were installed at the Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev (West) school in a project designed to conserve water organized by the Green Network, which specializes in educational programming in ecology and the environment.

<text>Feebate is a portmanteau of &quot;fee&quot; and &quot;rebate&quot;. A feebate program is a self-financing system of fees and rebates that are used to shift the costs of externalities produced by the private expropriation, fraudulent abstraction, or outright destruction of public goods onto those market actors responsible. Originally coined in the 1970s by Arthur H. Rosenfeld, feebate programs have typically been used to shift buying habits in the transportation and energy sectors.

== Examples ==

California&#x27;s proposed &quot;Clean Car Discount&quot; program (AB493-Ruskin) was designed to help reduce the state&#x27;s global warming/greenhouse gas emissions by imposing a fee of up to $2,500 on new, high carbon emitting vehicles (starting with 2011 models), and then rebating the fee to buyers of new low emission vehicles, thereby theoretically shifting the social cost of the destruction of public goods by global warming onto those who contribute to global warming. This Bill failed to pass.

Supporters point towards what they feel are feebates&#x27; tendency to promote personal responsibility by having those responsible for the involuntary expropriation (by means of force and fraud) of public goods from the public—and each and every private individual—by destruction of the environment or other negligent behavior towards private and public property, by having polluters pay for the externalities that they impose upon society. In the case of personal cars, feebates share some of the same aims as fuel taxes, vehicle registration fees, congestion charging, and road pricing.

In some situations, feebates can be a more efficient (or complementary) way of promoting greater fuel efficiency and other socially-desirable outcomes than traditional taxes or quotas. Fuel taxes create important price signals that can make consumers aware of the non-internalized costs of fuel consumption (greenhouse gasses, other pollution)—and raise funds to offset this externality. But retail consumers have very high discount rates, meaning buyers do not take into account the additional cost high gasoline taxes or poor gas mileage when purchasing a car. A feebate internalizes that cost into the initial purchase price, thereby requiring the buyer to prepay for the taking of public and private environmental goods.

Another example of a feebate is proposed in the Rocky Mountain Institute&#x27;s 2004 publication, &quot;Winning the Oil Endgame&quot;. For each class of car and light truck, a feebate mechanism is used to reward buyers of vehicles that are more fuel efficient than the average vehicle in that class and penalize buyers of less fuel efficient vehicles. This feebate is revenue-neutral, meaning that the amount of money collected through fees (surcharges) equals the amount paid out in rebates.

<text>Robert Flint (14 March 1838 – 25 November 1910) was a Scottish theologian and philosopher who wrote also on sociology.

==Life==
Flint was born at Greenburn, Sibbaldbie near Applegarth in Dumfriesshire on 14 March 1838, the son of Grace Johnston (&quot;née&quot; Paterson) and Robert Flint, a farm overseer. His first school was at Evan Water then he moved to Moffat. In 1852, he entered the University of Glasgow where he distinguished himself (without graduating) in arts and divinity.

Having been employed as a lay missionary by the &#x27;El ders&#x27; Association of Glasgow&#x27;, Flint was licensed to preach as a Church of Scotland minister by the Presbytery of Glasgow in June 1858, and for a short time acted as assistant to Norman Macleod, at the Barony Church, Glasgow. He was minister of the East Church, Aberdeen from 1859 to 1862, and of Kilconquhar church in Fife from 1862 to 1864, a small country village parish, which gave him leisure for study, improved by visits to Germany.

On the death of James Frederick Ferrier in 1864, Flint was elected to succeed him in the moral philosophy chair at the University of St Andrews, among the competing candidates being Thomas Hill Green. This chair he held till 1876, when he succeeded Thomas Jackson Crawford in the divinity chair of the University of Edinburgh. On this appointment he was awarded doctorates by both the University of Glasgow (LLD) and the University of Edinburgh (DD). Thomas Chalmers had similarly migrated from the one chair to the other.

Flint was appointed to a number of foundation lectureships. He was Baird lecturer (1876–77); in 1880 he travelled to America, and delivered a course as Stone lecturer at Princeton University; in 1887–88 he was Croall lecturer. He was elected on 21 May 1883 corresponding member of the Institute of France (Académie des sciences morales et politiques), and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1880. His proposers were Sir Robert Christison, Sir Alexander Grant, Alexander Campbell Fraser and Peter Guthrie Tait. He served as Vice President to the Society for three sessions: 1886–92; 1893–99; and 1902–07.

He resigned his chair in 1903 to devote himself to literary work, a purpose hampered by failing health. His post was filled by Rev Prof William Paterson Paterson (later Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.

For some time he lived at Musselburgh. He delivered the Gifford lectures in 1908–1909.

Flint died, unmarried, at his residence, 5 Royal Terrace, Edinburgh, on 25 November 1910. In 2015 the building was occupied by a restaurant and hotel.

He is buried against the eastern wall of the old south section of Liberton Cemetery in south Edinburgh.

<text>Karl Gustav Adolf Knies (29 March 18213 August 1898) was a German economist of the historical school of economics, best known as the author of &quot;Political Economy from the Standpoint of the Historical Method&quot; (1853). Knies taught at the University of Heidelberg for over 30 years, and was perhaps the most theoretically oriented economist of the older historical school.

Like others in the German historical school, Knies disliked the attitudes of the &quot;classical school&quot; (Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and their followers), particularly their belief that the pursuit of individual self-interest redounded to the good of the community. In his &quot;Political Economy&quot;, p. 157, he comments that self-interest is &quot;in the public interest, so to speak, in its weakness, and dangerous in its strength&quot; (gemeinnützig, so zu sagen, in seine Schwäche und gefährlich in seine Stärke).

Knies is very important to early American economic thought, as some of its founders studied under him, e.g., John Bates Clark attended from 1872 to 1875 the University of Zurich and the University of Heidelberg where he studied under him; Clark supervised the thesis of Frank Knight, who in turn influenced Paul Samuelson, who was the first to win the John Bates Clark Medal for the best American economist under age forty. Richard T. Ely studied under Knies and received his Ph.D. in 1879 in Heidelberg. Knies is the central-most figure in the network of winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics.

<doc id="1280959" wikidata="Q209511" url="?curid=1280959" title="Dylan and Cole Sprouse">
<text>Dylan Thomas Sprouse and Cole Mitchell Sprouse (born August 4, 1992) are American actors. They are twins and are sometimes referred to as the Sprouse brothers or Sprouse Bros. Their first major theatrical film role was in the 1999 comedy &quot;Big Daddy&quot;, in which they co-starred with Adam Sandler. They later appeared in several television sitcoms and starred in the television film &quot;I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus&quot; and straight-to-DVD &quot;Just for Kicks&quot;.

From 2005 until 2008, they starred in the Disney Channel sitcom &quot;The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody&quot;. As a result of the series&#x27; success, the media has termed them &quot;heartthrobs&quot; and &quot;overwhelming draws&quot; among preteen and teen audiences. The following year, the brothers launched a franchise known as the Sprouse Bros brand, which included a clothing line, book series and magazine. The majority of the Sprouses&#x27; franchise ended in 2008, except for their clothing line. &quot;The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody&quot; was retooled in 2008 as &quot;The Suite Life on Deck&quot;, in which the brothers reprised their roles as Zack and Cody. &quot;The Suite Life on Deck&quot; went on to become the most-watched children&#x27;s television show in 2008 and 2009. The show ended in May 2011. They also starred in &quot;The Suite Life Movie&quot;, which aired in March of the same year. They began cultivating an adult image by starring in the independent theatrical suspense film &quot;The Kings of Appletown&quot; in 2009.

Dylan and Cole were two of the wealthiest children alive in 2007, and in 2010, the Sprouse brothers were the highest-paid Disney television child actors, earning $40,000 per episode combined. MSN reported by the end of the 2000s that the twin brothers became the richest young twins in the world. In 2010, the brothers were accepted to New York University. They deferred admission for one year, and attended the university from 2011 to 2015. Both Cole and Dylan confirmed they wish to pursue acting post-university.

As of 2018, Cole appears as Jughead Jones on the television series &quot;Riverdale&quot;, and Dylan is a co-owner and brewmaster of the All-Wise Meadery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

==Early lives==
The Sprouses were born at Clinica Tanganelli, a small hospital in Arezzo, Italy, to American parents Matthew Sprouse and Melanie Wright, while they were teaching at an English language school in Tuscany. Dylan was named after Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, and Cole is named after jazz singer and pianist Nat King Cole. Dylan is 15 minutes older than Cole. They have German ancestry. The boys moved back to the United States four months after their birth to their parents&#x27; native Long Beach, California. Some of the money Dylan and Cole earned by acting was used to buy a house in Calabasas, California, where their family still lived .

==Acting==

The brothers began acting at the age of eight months following a suggestion from their grandmother, Jonine Booth Wright, who was a drama teacher and actress. They first appeared in a commercial for diapers, switching on-screen time every few seconds. As with many twins, the two have often played the same role, due to child labor laws in California restricting the amount of time children can be filmed in a day. Casting twins in a single role thus allows more time for the character to be filmed. Beginning at eight months old, the two played a single character, Patrick Kelly, on the ABC series &quot;Grace Under Fire&quot;.

In 1999, the boys appeared in their first major feature film, &quot;Big Daddy&quot;, in which they shared the role of a five-year-old boy named Julian who is adopted by Adam Sandler&#x27;s character, Sonny Koufax. Though the film received mixed reviews, the two were nominated for multiple awards for their role in the film. However, they did not win any. The same year, the boys also had a minor role in the thriller &quot;The Astronaut&#x27;s Wife&quot;. The Sprouses have noted that after &quot;Big Daddy&quot;&#x27;s release, they entered a slow period in their careers and were not cast in any major roles for a time. During the early 2000s, the twins appeared in episodes of &quot;The Nightmare Room&quot; and &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;, as well as in &quot;Mad TV&quot; and portrayed roles in the feature films &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot; and &quot;Adam Sandler&#x27;s Eight Crazy Nights&quot;. Cole began appearing in episodes of the television show &quot;Friends&quot; as Ross Geller&#x27;s son Ben in 2001; this role was not shared with Dylan.

They both appeared in &quot;I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus&quot; and &quot;Just for Kicks&quot;, both of which were family films that received a direct-to-video release. David Nusair of &quot;Reel Film Reviews&quot; said of their acting in &quot;Just for Kicks&quot; that the brothers &quot;aren&#x27;t the worst child actors I&#x27;ve ever seen... but they certainly leave a lot to be desired.&quot; Dylan and Cole were later cast in the Disney Channel original series &quot;The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody&quot;, where they portrayed identical twins Zack and Cody Martin, respectively. The series, which debuted in March 2005, became a ratings success. As part of their involvement with Disney, the brothers also became part of the 11-member group, the Disney Channel Circle of Stars, and sang the song &quot;A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes&quot; along with the members of the group, for a video that was released as bonus material in the special edition version of the Disney film &quot;Cinderella&quot;. They also participated in the Disney Channel Games.

The Sprouses played one character, Jeremiah, in the independent film &quot;The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things&quot;. The film was produced in 2004 but not given a theatrical release until March 2006, when it played at three theatres in the United States, ultimately grossing $29,000 domestically. Harvey Karten praised their acting, stating that &quot;acting is superlative all around&quot;, and Tamara Straus of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called them &quot;the movie&#x27;s only saving grace&quot;. In 2007, the two filmed &quot;A Modern Twain Story: The Prince and the Pauper&quot;. Carrie R. Wheadon of Common Sense Media said the film was a &quot;slow story for Zack and Cody fans only&quot;. The Sprouse brothers both had voice roles in the animated film &quot;Holidaze: The Christmas That Almost Didn&#x27;t Happen&quot; alongside Brenda Song and Emily Osment. Dylan played the voice of Shasta in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow Buddies&quot;. The brothers both starred in the theatrical film &quot;The Kings of Appletown&quot;, which is based on the book &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot;. The film was directed by Bobby Moresco and written by Amanda Moresco. Shot in New Braunfels, Texas, the film was originally estimated to be released in the winter of 2008. &quot;Kings of Appletown&quot; had a limited theatrical release on December 12, 2009, and was officially released at the Newport Beach Film Festival in April 2010.

They appeared on the cover of the May 2009 issue &quot;People Magazine&quot;, in an eighty-page special edition issue devoted to &quot;The Suite Life on Deck&quot;. The twin brothers began filming another Modern Twain Story film in the summer of 2009. The film was tentatively titled &quot;Sivilized&quot; and was a modern version of &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;. However, in mid-2010, Dylan stated that they would not be doing the film, in part because they &quot;outgrew&quot; the film. They became the new face of the children&#x27;s yogurt, Danimals, in 2009; their endorsement deal was renewed in 2010. The twin brothers signed an endorsement deal with Nintendo DS in August 2010.

, Dylan and Cole were not in any acting projects and were focusing instead on college as well as art and photography, respectively. However, Dylan has stated that they would both like to continue acting while in college. Dylan and Cole are represented by William Morris Endeavor .

In February 2016, Cole was cast as Jughead Jones in The CW&#x27;s drama series &quot;Riverdale&quot;, based on &quot;Archie&quot;.

==Sprouse Bros brand==
In 2005, the Sprouse brothers signed a licensing agreement with Dualstar Entertainment to produce Sprouse Bros branded merchandise for the preadolescent market, the Sprouse Bros brand included a clothing line, comics series and a magazine, as well as personal hygiene line and a line of sportswear. Dylan said of the brand that they wanted to &quot;reach out to the nerd group and the cool group&quot; and &quot;appeal to everybody&quot;. A magazine targeting boys was launched by Dualstar and Leisure Publishing LLC in 2006 called &quot;Sprouse Bros. Code&quot;. Simon &amp; Schuster Inc. published two volumes of a book series titled &quot;Sprouse Bros. 47 R.O.N.I.N.&quot;, which was described as featuring the Sprouse twins as &quot;young James Bonds or undercover agents&quot;; the book series continued. In 2008, the brothers ended their association with the Olsens&#x27; Dualstar, but they continued to sell their clothing line. The items in their clothing lines were sold exclusively online , when the online store could no longer be accessed.

== Personal lives ==
Dylan Sprouse has stated that the experience of coming to fame after the success of &quot;The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody&quot; is &quot;kind of scary, how fast everything is moving&quot; and that a year prior &quot;none of this was happening, it was just doing &quot;Suite Life&quot;&quot;, and that he was excited for the future. While filming &quot;The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody&quot;, the both of them received on-set tutoring for three hours each day for school, and said they were getting &quot;straight A&#x27;s and honors&quot;. In their last year of high school, the brothers both took Advanced Placement classes. Dylan took AP Psychology and AP Spanish, and Cole took AP Psychology and AP Government.

The twins&#x27; family has three dogs: Bubba, which belongs to Dylan and Cole; Pinky, who is their father&#x27;s; and Curry, their stepmother&#x27;s. Their favorite actor and co-star is Adam Sandler. Dylan has said that Adam is &quot;a role model in acting&quot; and that they learned a lot about comedy from him. In mid-2010, Dylan launched a site for his art called Sprouse Arts, and in mid-2011, Cole launched a site for his photography called Cole Sprouse Photography.

In 2010, the brothers were both accepted to New York University. They had initial plans to attend the university in the fall of 2010; however, they deferred for one year. Dylan initially planned on majoring in fine/studio arts and minoring in economics while Cole planned on majoring in film and television production and minoring in drama. Instead, they both enrolled in the Gallatin School of Individualized Study, which allows students to plan their own curriculum. Cole focused his curriculum on the humanities and archaeology while Dylan focused on video game design. In 2011, Dylan was elected president of the Third Avenue North residence hall at New York University. Both brothers graduated in May 2015; they told &quot;Entertainment&quot; magazine that they had walked away with each other&#x27;s diplomas at the graduation ceremony.

In 2012, Dylan and Cole were officially appointed as the International Ambassadors of the Koyamada International Foundation. They traveled to Japan with Shin Koyamada to empower the youth of Japan to better themselves and rebuild Japan as a society as well as to deepen the friendly relations and brotherhood between the youth of Japan and America in August 2013.

As of 2013, Dylan was working as a host at a New York City restaurant, which he explained was a result of his desire to try a new experience, as he said, &quot;working somewhat below the means I&#x27;m used to, as well as a way to socialize and get out of the house.&quot;
Since 2014, Dylan has commentated a few &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; tournaments.

In early 2017, Dylan announced that with two partners he was preparing to open All-Wise Meadery in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, New York; he is the brewmaster. He disclosed that he has been a Heathen since he was 15.

<text>Mark Coyne (born November 19, 1962) is an American musician and one of the original members of the rock band the Flaming Lips. Coyne co-founded the group along with his brother Wayne in Norman, Oklahoma, in 1983. The original lineup of the Flaming Lips was Mark on lead vocals, Wayne on guitar, and Michael Ivins on bass. Mark left the band in 1985 (shortly after their self-titled debut EP was released) around the time of his wedding. Upon Mark&#x27;s departure, Wayne assumed lead vocalist and songwriting duties.

Some of the 1985 demos that Mark sang on were released as a part of the &quot;Finally the Punk Rockers Are Taking Acid&quot; compilation.

<doc id="1280968" wikidata="Q1809132" url="?curid=1280968" title="In My Father's Den (film)">
<text>In My Father&#x27;s Den is a 2004 New Zealand film written and directed by Brad McGann and starring Matthew Macfadyen and Emily Barclay. It is based on the novel of the same title by Maurice Gee. The film was released in October 2004 to glowing reviews.

== Plot ==
Following the death of his father Jeff (Matthew Chamberlain), renowned war photographer Paul Prior (Matthew Macfadyen) returns to his hometown in the South Island of New Zealand. Paul also reunites with his younger brother Andrew (Colin Moy), a pious local ostrich farmer, who is married to the very religious and agoraphobic Penny (Miranda Otto). Under Andrew&#x27;s pressure, Paul reluctantly prolongs his stay to help sort out the sale of their father&#x27;s cottage and the adjoining orchard.

Returning to the dilapidated family property, Paul revisits his father&#x27;s makeshift den in the equipment shed. Jeff, who secretly harboured a love of wine, literature, and free-thinking philosophy, found solace in the den away from his puritanical wife Iris (Vanessa Riddell). When Paul as a child had accidentally stumbled upon this wondrous booklined universe, his father had shared the den with him on the condition that he did not tell anyone else.

While back in his hometown, Paul accepts a temporary English teaching position at his old high school. Paul also forges an unlikely friendship with the 16-year-old Celia (Emily Barclay), a teenaged misfit who loves writing and dreams of travelling to Spain. Celia is the daughter of Paul&#x27;s former girlfriend Jackie (Jodie Rimmer), the town&#x27;s butcher. It is implied that Paul believes Celia to be his daughter, and becomes a father figure for the teenager. Resenting the unwanted attentions of her mother&#x27;s boyfriend Gareth (Antony Starr), Celia seeks solace in Paul&#x27;s den.

Paul and Celia&#x27;s budding friendship eventually comes under scrutiny from the judgmental Andrew and the envious Jackie. After Paul attacks Gareth for beating Celia, Jackie forbids Paul from having contact with her daughter. Despite the warnings, Celia continues to visit and Paul encourages her in her ambitions as a writer. In the middle of winter, Celia goes missing. Due to their close friendship, Paul becomes the prime suspect in her disappearance and endures the hostility of the town including Gareth and his teenage nephew Jonathan (Jimmy Keen), who fancied Celia.

The rest of the film is shown in flashbacks of Paul&#x27;s teenage years interspersed with his interactions with Celia and final confrontation with Andrew. After Jonathan reveals that his father had confiscated his camera for illicitly photographing Celia, Paul confronts Andrew. Jeff is then revealed to be Celia&#x27;s biological father through an affair with Jackie, which Paul and Iris had discovered. Grief-stricken and betrayed, Iris committed suicide, while Paul - ignoring the pleas of Andrew - left the family home at the age of 17.

Paul also learns that Andrew had invited Celia to view their late father&#x27;s will; Jeff had left a third of his estate to Celia. Mistaking Celia for Andrew&#x27;s mistress after accidentally viewing Jonathan&#x27;s photos, and with a misunderstanding of confirmation from Andrew, an enraged Penny had pushed Celia over the balcony, killing her. To protect his wife, Andrew covered up Celia&#x27;s death. After Paul and Andrew&#x27;s confrontation, Jonathan calls the police, believing his father killed Celia. To continue protecting Penny, Andrew takes the blame and is arrested. Celia&#x27;s body is later found in a river. 

Following the funeral, Paul burns the den and reconciles with Jackie. The film closes with a flashback to the last time Paul saw Celia; they openly talk about being siblings - Paul being revealed to have known she was his half-sister all along - and they say goodbye as she walks down the road to her untimely death.

== Production ==
Filming locations were mainly in Central Otago, New Zealand, with the town of Roxburgh standing in for the fictional Rapata Junction. Interior scenes of Andrew and Penny&#x27;s house were filmed in Auckland.

&quot;In My Father&#x27;s Den&quot; was the only feature film and the final work written or directed by McGann, who died of bowel cancer in 2007.

==Awards==
The film won the Fipresci Prize at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival, the Mercedes Benz Youth Jury Prize at the 52nd San Sebastián International Film Festival in Spain in the same year, the Special Jury Prize at the Seattle International Film Festival in 2005 and the Grand Prix at the 2005 Festival du Film Britannique de Dinard. It became one of the top 10 grossing New Zealand films.

==Critical reaction==
The website rottentomatoes.com, which compiles mostly North American reviews, gives the film a 100 per cent &quot;fresh&quot; rating, meaning consistently positive reviews, and with an average rating of 7.2 out of 10. The latter figure is the average from seven reviews. The film also garnered acclaim in many publications. A reviewer for &quot;The Australian&quot; described the film as &quot;one of the best films I have ever seen&quot;. Meanwhile, &quot;Empire&quot; described that &quot;director Brad McGann reveals great skill and bravery in the way he brings the story&#x27;s insular world to life&quot;.

<text>The Hardys, also known as the Hardy Boys, also stylized as the Hardy Boyz, are an American professional wrestling tag team consisting of brothers Jeff Hardy and Matt Hardy. They are both signed to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) while appearing with partner promotion WWE on its NXT brand.

They first began teaming together in 1993 on the independent circuit, winning the NWA 2000 Tag Team Championship in NWA and founding OMEGA Championship Wrestling, where they held the OMEGA Tag Team Championship. They signed contracts with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 1997. In 2000, they were joined by Lita, and the trio became Team Xtreme during her stay. They are the only team to have held the WWE/World, WCW, TNA, ROH, Raw, and SmackDown Tag Team Championships. They are considered one of the major teams that revived tag team wrestling during the Attitude Era. In 2012, WWE named them as one of the greatest tag teams in WWE history.

After splitting up as a team in 2002, the brothers reunited in 2006 and teamed up sporadically afterward. They also appeared in Impact Wrestling (formerly TNA) to briefly reunite in 2011 as members of Immortal, and teamed more frequently from 2014 to 2017. Both brothers left Impact in 2017, and returned to WWE, where they would go on to win the Raw Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania 33, and would team on and off over the next two years. In 2019, they won the SmackDown Tag Team Championship the night after WrestleMania 35, but would relinquish the titles three weeks later after Jeff suffered a leg injury. Jeff would then be out of action for the rest of the year, marking the last appearance of the team during their latest run in WWE, as Matt&#x27;s contract expired in March 2020 and he went to AEW soon after.

Both brothers have also won singles championships, with each becoming multi-time world champions in their own right. In 2017, they held seven tag team championships from seven different companies at the same time, including the ROH World Tag Team Championship and the TNA World Tag Team Championship, being recognized as the only tag team in history to hold these titles simultaneously.

The Hardy Boyz gained fame for their innovative participation in ladder matches and Tables, Ladders and Chairs matches with The Dudley Boyz and Edge and Christian. Overall, they are 13-time world tag team champions between WWE, TNA, and ROH, having won the WWE&#x27;s original Tag Team Championship six times, the World Tag Team Championship once, the WWE Tag Team Championship once, the WCW Tag Team Championship once (in WWE), the TNA World Tag Team Championship three times, and the ROH World Tag Team Championship once.

== History ==
=== Early years (1993–1998) ===
The brothers formed a tag team in 1993 after Jeff&#x27;s debut in the Trampoline Wrestling Federation (TWF). The promotion went by several names, and it was modernized in 1997 as the Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (OMEGA). The duo worked in several independent promotions throughout North Carolina, holding the OMEGA Tag Team Championship and NWA 2000 Tag Team Championship. They had their first record tag team for Smoky Mountain Wrestling in July 1995.

Their first match as a team in the WWF was against The New Rockers on May 28, 1996 for the June 15 episode of WWF Superstars. Later on they wrestled against Smoking Gunns, Harris Twins, The Headbangers, and Kurrgan in a handicap match.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1998–2009) ===
==== Rise to popularity (1998–1999) ====

After being signed to a contract in 1998, they were trained by Dory Funk, Jr. in his Funkin&#x27; Dojo.

The Hardy Boyz started their run as a popular tag team with a win over Kaientai (Men&#x27;s Teioh and Shoichi Funaki) on the September 27, 1998 episode of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;. Soon after their &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; win, they built up a fan base following through their high-flying tag team tactics. They started to become serious contenders for the Tag Team Championship after they became managed by Michael Hayes, formerly a member of The Fabulous Freebirds. On the June 29, 1999, episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot; (aired July 5), they defeated The Acolytes (Faarooq and Bradshaw) to win their first WWF Tag Team Championship, but they re-lost the title to The Acolytes a little less than a month later at Fully Loaded.

They eventually dumped Hayes as their manager in August 1999, becoming villains and briefly associating themselves with Gangrel as part of The New Brood. After winning a series of matches against the team of Edge and Christian—dubbed the Terri Invitational Tournament—they won the services of Terri Runnels as their manager by winning the first ever tag team ladder match at No Mercy, and then dumped Gangrel the next night becoming faces. The fans also gave both teams a standing ovation the next night on &quot;Raw Is War&quot;. This began an over two year rivalry between the Hardy Boyz and the team of Edge and Christian. During this time, they also gained notoriety as a faction with Lita.

==== Team Xtreme (2000–2002) ====

With the addition of Lita, Matt and Jeff comprised the trio dubbed Team Xtreme, their name serving as a reflection of their &quot;extreme&quot; high-flying moves. In 2000, they were involved in feuds with Edge and Christian and The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) in many ladder matches and TLC matches.

They faced Edge and Christian and the Dudley Boyz at WrestleMania 2000 in a triple threat tag team ladder match. The Dudley Boyz started the match as the champions and Edge and Christian won the title. The Hardyz faced Edge and Christian for the title at Insurrextion and defeated them by disqualification, which meant that Edge and Christian retained the title. At King of the Ring, the Hardy Boyz squared off in a Four Corners Elimination match for the Tag Team Championship which included the champions Too Cool (Grandmaster Sexay and Scotty 2 Hotty), T &amp; A (Test and Albert) and Edge and Christian. The Hardyz were able to eliminate T &amp; A before getting eliminated themselves by Edge and Christian.
At SummerSlam, the Hardy Boyz were defeated in the first ever TLC match for the title, which Edge and Christian won, and in which the Dudley Boyz also competed. At Unforgiven, the Hardy Boyz defeated Edge and Christian in a steel cage match to win the title for a second time. They re-lost the title to Edge and Christian (who were dressed as Los Conquistadores) at No Mercy, but they won it back the next night on &quot;Raw Is War&quot; for a third time. During the match, the Hardy Boyz were dressed as Los Conquistadores, but tore off their masks after the match, revealing themselves. The team lost the title less than a month later to Right to Censor (Bull Buchanan and The Goodfather) on the November 6 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, when Edge and Christian came out and assaulted the Hardyz, allowing Right to Censor to pick up the win and the title.
The Hardyz became involved in a feud with both Edge and Christian and Right to Censor. At Survivor Series, the Hardyz along with the Dudleyz defeated Edge and Christian and Right to Censor in a Survivor Series elimination match. At Rebellion, the Hardy Boyz faced Right to Censor in a rematch for the titles but were unable to win the titles when Val Venis interfered. On the December 4 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, Dean Malenko defeated the Hardy Boyz&#x27; valet Lita to retain the Light Heavyweight Championship and earn himself a date with her three days later on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, when Malenko took Lita on a date and received a beating from the Hardyz. The Hardyz began feuding with Malenko and his friends, The Radicalz (Eddie Guerrero, Chris Benoit, Malenko and Perry Saturn). The two teams faced each other in several tag team and singles matches on &quot;Raw Is War&quot; and &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. The two teams also squared off against each other at Armageddon with Guerrero, Malenko and Saturn taking on the Hardyz and Lita. The Radicalz won the match.

On the March 5, 2001 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, the Hardy Boyz captured their fourth WWF Tag Team Championship when they defeated The Dudley Boyz, after interference from Christian, only to lose the title to Edge and Christian two weeks later on &quot;Raw&quot;. The next month at WrestleMania X-Seven, the Hardy Boyz competed in another TLC match against Edge and Christian and the Dudley Boyz. Just as in the first TLC match, Edge and Christian were victorious thanks to help from Rhyno.

On the October 8 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the Hardy Boyz won the WCW Tag Team Championship from Booker T and Test. They lost the title to the Dudley Boyz two weeks later on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. On the November 12 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, they beat Booker T and Test again, but this time for the WWF Tag Team Championship. At Survivor Series, they lost the title to the Dudleys in a steel cage title unification match. This defeat led to a break up storyline that resulted in a match between the brothers at Vengeance. Jeff would emerge victorious after Lita, who was the special referee, failed to see Matt&#x27;s foot on the rope. The storyline was dropped in January 2002 and they reunited.

At No Way Out, the Hardy Boyz participated in a tag team turmoil match which was won by the APA. At WrestleMania X8, along with the APA and the Dudley Boyz, the Hardyz challenged Billy and Chuck for the WWF Tag Team Championship in a four corners elimination match. The APA were eliminated by the Dudleyz, whom the Hardy Boyz managed to eliminate. In the end, they were pinned by the champions, therefore losing the opportunity. They then began a feud with the newcomer Brock Lesnar and his manager Paul Heyman. At Judgment Day, the Hardy Boyz lost to Lesnar and Heyman in a tag team match.

==== Split and departure (2002–2005) ====
The duo split up afterward as Jeff began a storyline with The Undertaker, while Matt was relegated to working on &quot;Heat&quot;. In the storyline, Matt then attacked Jeff due to jealousy of Jeff getting opportunities, including a match for the Intercontinental Championship. Matt was then moved to the SmackDown! brand, where he dubbed himself &quot;Matt Hardy Version 1&quot; and the &quot;Sensei of Mattitude&quot; and picked up real-life friend Shannon Moore and briefly Crash Holly as followers. He later won the Cruiserweight Championship from Billy Kidman at No Way Out in February 2003. Jeff was released from WWE on April 22 for erratic behavior, drug use, refusal to go to rehab and deteriorating ring performance as well as constant tardiness and no-showing events.

Following his release from WWE, Jeff debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) in mid-2004. After no-showing several events, he was suspended in 2006 before leaving the company soon afterward. Meanwhile, in April 2005, Matt was released from WWE due to unprofessional conduct with social media after discovering Lita had a real-life affair with Edge. He was rehired just a few months later, feuded with Edge, and was eventually sent to the SmackDown! brand.

==== The Hardys reunion (2006–2007) ====
On August 4, 2006, Jeff rejoined WWE on its Raw brand. In November 2006, it was announced on WWE&#x27;s official website that Matt and Jeff would team up for the first time together in over four years as members of Team DX at the Survivor Series. The Hardys, as they were now known, were first given a &quot;warm up match&quot; on &quot;ECW on Sci Fi&quot;, defeating The Full Blooded Italians (Little Guido Maritato and Tony Mamaluke). At Survivor Series, Team DX defeated Team Rated-RKO in a clean sweep.

On the November 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Hardys had their first shot at Tag Team gold in five years. They took on World Tag Team Champions Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton), but came up short when Edge hit Jeff in the back with a belt to get himself and Orton deliberately disqualified to retain the title. That same day, The Hardys posed an open challenge to any team for ECW brand&#x27;s ECW December to Dismember which was immediately accepted by a reuniting MNM (Johnny Nitro and Joey Mercury). After a run in on the intervening &quot;ECW on Sci Fi&quot;, The Hardys defeated MNM at the event, starting a feud between all four men that spanned both brands. The Hardys got their first chance to gain the WWE Tag Team Championship at Armageddon, where the original tag team match was changed to a four team ladder match involving The Hardys, MNM, Dave Taylor and William Regal, and Paul London and Brian Kendrick. Despite coming up short, The Hardys sparked another feud with MNM when Mercury was legitimately injured. While Jeff and Nitro continued battling over the Intercontinental Championship on &quot;Raw&quot;, Matt and Mercury feuded on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Mercury and Nitro tried injuring both Hardys&#x27; faces as payback for what happened at Armageddon, claiming that The Hardys had ruined Mercury&#x27;s &#x27;Hollywood good looks&#x27;. The Hardys settled their feud with MNM at the Royal Rumble when they defeated them for the second time. Matt and Mercury continued feuding, however, which was finally settled at No Way Out.

On the April 2, 2007, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the Hardys won the World Tag Team Championship for the sixth time in their career after winning a ten team battle royal. After losing singles bouts to both Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch, The Hardys retained their World Tag Team Championship at both Backlash and Judgment Day against the team of Cade and Murdoch. At One Night Stand, Hardyz retained the titles against The World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin) in a ladder match. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, however, the Hardys lost their championship to Cade and Murdoch, when Jeff missed a Swanton Bomb and was pinned by Cade after Murdoch pushed his foot off of the bottom rope of the ring. Cade and Murdoch attacked the Hardys with the championship belts after the match. The Hardys got a rematch at , but was unsuccessful after Jeff was hit with a sitout spinebuster from Cade.

The Hardys once again returned to WWE on the November 13 episode of &quot;ECW&quot; to face Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Mr. Kennedy, a match that was originally scheduled for the November 16 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. The Hardys were unsuccessful in their return as Porter pinned Jeff for the win. The Hardys, announced and referred to once again as the Hardy Boyz, reunited once again in 2008, on the June 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; in a losing effort to John Morrison and The Miz. The match occurred after Jeff was drafted to the SmackDown brand (the same brand as Matt). This loss, however, caused Matt to be drafted to the ECW brand. On the July 15 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, The Hardys reunited in their home state of North Carolina, defeating Morrison and Miz. The Hardys then teamed up on the October 31 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; and on November 3 on &quot;Raw&quot;, winning both matches.
==== Feud and second departure (2009) ====

The Hardy Boyz kickstarted 2009 with a win over Edge and Big Show on the January 2 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;. This was the last match for the then WWE Champion and ECW Champion as a team as Matt would lose the ECW championship to Jack Swagger on the January 13 episode of ECW. Heading into the 2009 Royal Rumble, Matt was attempting to regain the ECW Championship from Jack Swagger while Jeff held the WWE Championship. After Matt lost to Swagger, he interfered in Jeff&#x27;s match with Edge, hitting Jeff with a steel chair and allowing Edge to win the WWE Championship. On the January 30 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Matt announced the permanent disbandment of the tag team due to the events at the Royal Rumble and that he no longer considered Jeff as his partner or brother. Matt moved to the SmackDown brand and began a scripted rivalry with Jeff. The pair faced each other in an Extreme Rules match at WrestleMania 25, which Matt won. They later faced each other in a stretcher match, in which Matt gained his second win over Jeff. As part of the 2009 WWE draft, Matt was drafted to the Raw brand on the April 13 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Despite this, the brothers faced each other in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match at Backlash, which Jeff won. Matt also interfered in Jeff&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship match at Judgment Day, preventing him from winning the championship.

On the August 21 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Jeff (then the World Heavyweight Champion) and Matt reunited as the Hardys and teamed with John Morrison in a six-man tag team match to defeat CM Punk and The Hart Dynasty. The following week, Jeff lost a &quot;Loser Leaves the WWE&quot; steel cage match to CM Punk, resulting in him leaving the company. Over a year later, on October 15, 2010, WWE announced that Matt had been released from his contract, with Matt later stating that his release had been in effect two weeks before WWE made the announcement.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2010–2017) ===
==== Immortal (2010–2011) ====

Jeff made his TNA return on the January 4, 2010 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, and went on to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Bound for Glory in October with help from Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff, revealing that they and others had formed the Immortal faction. On January 9, 2011, at TNA&#x27;s pay-per-view Genesis, Matt made his TNA debut as a surprise member of Immortal, and defeated Rob Van Dam. Jeff went on to lose the TNA World Heavyweight Championship to Mr. Anderson later that night. On the January 13 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; the Hardy Brothers reunited, as heels for the first time since 1999, and defeated Van Dam and Anderson. Following the Victory Road pay-per-view, Immortal severed their ties with Jeff. On August 20, Matt was released from TNA after being arrested for driving while intoxicated.

==== TNA World Tag Team Champions (2014–2015) ====
Matt returned to TNA in mid-2014. On June 26, at Destination X The Hardys unsuccessfully challenged The Wolves (Davey Richards and Eddie Edwards) for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. On the August 14 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, The Hardys were defeated by Team 3D (the former Dudley Boyz). At the &quot;Hardcore Justice&quot; edition of Impact Wrestling, The Hardys and Team 3D challenged The Wolves to a three-way for the TNA World Tag Team Championship, to which they agreed. Kurt Angle later announced that all three teams would compete in a best of three series for the title with the winners of the first match being able to choose the stipulation of the next one. Team 3D won the first match and chose a Tables match, The Hardys won the second match and chose a ladder match, and The Wolves won the third match on the &quot;No Surrender&quot; episode of Impact Wrestling, tying them all at one win each. A final match to decide the series took place, and was won by The Wolves. In October, The Hardys participated in a tournament to determine the number one contender to the TNA World Tag Team Championship; they defeated The BroMans (Jessie Godderz and DJ Z), Ethan Carter III and Tyrus, and Samoa Joe and Low Ki to win the tournamanet. On February 6, 2015, at Lockdown, The Hardys unsuccessfully challenged The Revolution for the TNA World Tag Team Championship in a Six Sides of Steel match.

After The Wolves vacated the tag team championship due to an injury to Eddie Edwards, an Ultimate X match was held for the title at the March 16 &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; tapings. The Hardys defeated Kenny King and Low Ki, Ethan Carter III and Bram, and Rockstar Spud and Mr. Anderson to win the match and the title. However, The Hardys vacated the titles due to Jeff&#x27;s broken tibia.

==== The Broken Hardyz (2016–2017) ====

On the August 4 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, after a lengthy feud involving the &quot;Deletion&quot; of Jeff Hardy, Broken Matt sent Jeff, (at the time referred to as Brother Nero), on a quest to procure the Impact Wrestling World Tag Team Championship for him. On the August 18 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Broken Matt and Brother Nero defeated The BroMans, The Tribunal, and The Helms Dynasty in an &quot;Ascension to Hell&quot; fatal four-way number one contender&#x27;s ladder match for an opportunity to challenge Decay for the TNA World Tag Team Championships at Bound for Glory. Broken Matt climbed the ladder and grabbed the contract, following Nero sacrificing himself by jumping off the ladder and onto Trevor Lee. On the September 1 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, the Hardys invited Decay to come to their hometown compound, plotting for a sequel to &quot;The Final Deletion&quot; (dubbed as &quot;Delete or Decay&quot;). Broken Matt turned babyface during this encounter when King Maxel was almost kidnapped by Decay and when Brother Nero took a hit from Abyss&#x27; spiked bat, and Broken Matt healed him via the Lake of Restoration.

On October 2 at TNA Bound for Glory they defeated Decay to become two time TNA World Tag Team Champions. On the October 6 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, they retained their titles against Decay in a Wolf Creek match. On the October 13 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, they were attacked by The Tribunal. The Hardys would then face The Tribunal one week later, on October 20&#x27;s broadcast where they were able to successfully defend their titles. However, after the match as they returned to the dressing rooms, the arena went dark, signalling the arrival of a new faction, dubbed the DCC. The DCC would use the darkness to attack and layout The Tribunal as The Hardys looked on from the ramp, thus potentially building an upcoming rivalry in weeks to comes. On February 27, 2017, The Hardys announced their departure from TNA after negotiations of a new contract fell through. Jeff and Matt left the company without dropping the TNA World Tag Team Championships.

=== Expedition of Gold (2014–2017) ===
Beginning in April 2014, the brothers reunited on the independent circuit.
In 2017, the Hardys embarked on a tour of various independent promotions—while still reigning as TNA World Tag Team Champions—which was promoted on &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; as the &quot;Expedition of Gold,&quot; where they sought to win other tag team titles in order to declare themselves as the &quot;greatest tag team in all of space and time&quot;. During this tour, Matt and Jeff won the tag team titles in promotions such as Mexico&#x27;s The Crash promotion, the West Virginia based All Star Wrestling, Maryland&#x27;s MCW Pro Wrestling, their own OMEGA Championship Wrestling and Wrestling Superstar company based out of Chile. Footage from some of these matches was aired on &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;.

Although some debate remains whether it was six or seven championships held at one time, the contracts of Broken Matt (Hardy) and Brother Nero (Jeff Hardy) expired with TNA Wrestling on February 27, 2017 at midnight after negotiations were stalled by the company. Having previously filmed television weeks in advance, in storylines Matt and Jeff remained the TNA Tag Team Champions as their contracts expired. They offered to drop the titles the following week on the next set of television tapings but TNA&#x27;s new parent company, Anthem, declined.

On March 4, 2017, The Hardys made their Ring of Honor (ROH) debut at Manhattan Mayhem VI and defeated The Young Bucks for the ROH World Tag Team Championship. TNA still recognized them as the World Tag Team Champions (as the footage filmed for the following week where they would vacate the titles on &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; hadn&#x27;t aired yet), making them the only team to be recognized as both the TNA and ROH World Tag Team Champions simultaneously. They then lost the titles back to The Young Bucks in a ladder match on April 1 at Supercard of Honor XI, to which after the match, Jeff was noted as staying in the ring and saying &quot;We&#x27;ll fade away and classify ourselves as obsolete&quot;, paying homage to their &quot;Broken&quot; characters. It was also announced after the match that both Matt and Jeff Hardy&#x27;s contracts had expired.

Having won the ROH World Tag Team Championship, their tag team title accoutrements equalled seven at the time. The Broken Hardy storyline was abruptly dropped without explanation following a new set of television tapings between March 2–5, 2017. The Hardys did not appear on the Thursday, March 9 airing of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; and there was no reference to the TNA tag team titles, but the Broken Hardys were last seen broadcast in their compound using Vanguard-1 to teleport them with the TNA World Tag Team Championship belts to their next location, only for Decay to appear through teleportation with the belts with Rosemary declaring the Broken Hardys, &quot;deleted, obsolete, and decay!&quot;. The following week on the March 16 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Bruce Prichard cut a promo in the ring and said that the tag team titles are won in the ring, not in space. Playing upon the Hardys phrase of &quot;greatest tag team in all of space and time&quot;, he said that four teams would wrestle in two weeks to crown new tag team champions.

=== Return to WWE (2017, 2019) ===
On April 2 at, WrestleMania 33, The Hardy Boyz made an unannounced return to WWE, after hosts The New Day (Big E, Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods) announced that the triple threat ladder match for the Raw Tag Team Championship which had been set by WWE before the event was now going to be a Fatal four-way match. They then began jokingly questioning the arena about who the mystery team could be, before the Hardy Boyz&#x27;s made their entrance to the stage to a massive ovation from the crowd. At the event, The Hardy Boyz won the Raw Tag Team Championship, defeating the teams of Enzo Amore and Big Cass, Cesaro and Sheamus, and then-reigning champions Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson. The night after WrestleMania on &quot;Raw&quot;, they successfully defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson. Afterwards on &quot;Raw Talk&quot;, Matt mentioned that the Hardy Boyz had successfully completed the Expedition of Gold after winning the Raw Tag Team Championship. They would retain the titles at Payback against Sheamus and Cesaro, but lost them at Extreme Rules in a steel cage match, and failed to regain it at the inaugural Great Balls of Fire event.

In September, Jeff suffered a torn rotator cuff and would be out of action for four to six months, leaving Matt to begin a run as a singles competitor. However, two years later, on the February 26, 2019 episode of &quot;SmackDown Live&quot;, the Hardy Boyz reunited and, on the April 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, defeated The Usos to win the SmackDown Tag Team Championships. With this, they became the first team to win all three of WWE&#x27;s world tag team championships (World, Raw, and SmackDown). However, they vacated the WWE Smackdown Tag Team Championships due to Jeff suffering a leg injury from Lars Sullivan. While Jeff was recovering, Matt was featured less on WWE television until he left WWE on March 2. and he went on to sign with All Elite Wrestling. Jeff went on to become a singles competitor before being released from the WWE on December 9, 2021.

=== All Elite Wrestling (2022–2024) ===
Matt announced on Twitter that he and Jeff would be reuniting for their &#x27;Final Run&#x27; and wrestling a match in Big Time Wrestling (BTW). They will be facing the winner of a match between The Briscoes and The S.A.T.

Jeff debuted for AEW on the March 9, 2022 episode of &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot;, reuniting the brothers for the first time in over two years. On the March 16, 2022 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Matt and Jeff, billed as &quot;The Hardys&quot;, wrestled in their first ever AEW match, defeating Private Party.

On April 30, 2022 in Rostraver, PA, the brothers wrestled against The Mane Event (TME) for the IWC Tag Team Championship, and successfully captured their first tag team titles in three years.

On May 29, 2022, during a successful bout the Hardys had at the AEW Double or Nothing PPV against The Young Bucks, Jeff Hardy suffered a &quot;terrible&quot; concussion-like injury which, according to Matt Hardy, left him &quot;almost knocked out.&quot; On June 14, 2022, AEW owner Tony Khan would suspend Jeff Hardy indefinitely from AEW the day following his arrest for DUI, driving with a suspended license and violating a restriction that required him to keep an Ignition Interlock Device — a handheld breathalyzer that prevents users from starting their vehicle after drinking alcohol — in his car. Khan also announced that Jeff&#x27;s AEW suspension would only be lifted &quot;upon successfully completing treatment and maintaining his sobriety.” During the April 12, 2023 episode of Dynamite, Jeff Hardy returned to assist his brother during an assault thus reuniting the team. On April 8, 2024, it was reported that Matt&#x27;s contract had expired and decided not to renew, effectively disbanding the team. Two months later, Jeff also departed from AEW after his contract expired.

=== Return to TNA and WWE appearances (2024–present) ===
Matt made his surprise return to TNA on April 20, 2024 at Rebellion, reverting back to his &quot;Broken&quot; gimmick and attacking TNA World Champion Moose. On June 14 at Against All Odds, Matt unsuccessfully challenged Moose for the championship. After the match, Jeff made his surprise return to TNA to come to Matt&#x27;s aid from a post-match attack from Moose. On October 26, 2024, the Hardys won their third TNA World Tag Team Championship by defeating previous champions The System (Eddie Edwards and Brian Myers), and ABC (Ace Austin and Chris Bey) at Bound for Glory in a Full Metal Mayhem match to win the titles. While still contracted to TNA, the Hardy Boyz made a return appearance with WWE during the February 25, 2025 episode of &quot;NXT&quot;.

== Other media ==
The Hardys appeared on the February 7, 1999 episode of &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; entitled &quot;That Wrestling Show&quot;, as uncredited wrestlers. Jeff and Matt, along with Lita, also appeared on &quot;Tough Enough&quot; in early 2001, talking and wrestling with the contestants. They both appeared on the February 25, 2002 episode of &quot;Fear Factor&quot; competing against four other WWF wrestlers. Jeff was eliminated in the first round, but Matt became the eventual winner, winning $50,000 for the American Cancer Society.

In 2001, the Hardys and Lita appeared in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2001 Sports Hall of Fame issue. In 2003, Jeff and Matt, with the help of Michael Krugman, wrote and published their autobiography &quot;The Hardy Boyz: Exist 2 Inspire&quot;. As part of WWE, the Hardys appeared in the DVD, &quot;The Hardy Boyz: Leap of Faith&quot; in 2001. On April 29, 2008, WWE released &quot;Twist of Fate: The Matt and Jeff Hardy Story&quot;. The DVD features footage of the brothers in OMEGA and WWE, and it also briefly mentions Jeff&#x27;s initial stint in TNA. The brothers also appear on &quot;The Hardy Show&quot;, an internet web show which features the Hardys, Shannon Moore, and many of their friends.

<text>Leona Brown (born July 27, 1960) is a female boxer who is the WIBC world Bantamweight champion. Because of her age, many consider her to be &quot;the George Foreman of women&#x27;s boxing&quot;. Brown&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Downtown&quot;, is both a homage to actress Downtown Julie Brown, and it also serves as name play, such as in the case of &quot;Hannah The Vegas Fox&quot;.

==Career==
A native of Buffalo, New York, she now lives in Wappinger, New York.

Brown was an award winning amateur boxer, winning the New York state golden gloves award before turning professional, on September 27. 1997, beating Judy Mayrand by a four round unanimous decision in Germantown, Pennsylvania. Brown proceeded to win her first seven fights as a professional, including victories over Sue Chase, Sonya Emery and Suzanne Riccio.

On her eighth professional bout, fought June 11, 1999 in Bossier City, Louisiana, she fought for a world title for the first time, losing a ten round decision to IFBA world Bantamweight champion Eva Jones. Her next bout was a six round unanimous decision loss at the hands of the noted Margaret Sidoroff.

On October 1, 1999, Brown became a world champion for the first time, when she knocked out Dee Dufoe in round ten to become the IFBA&#x27;s world Super Bantamweight champion.

That short success was followed by defeat and disappointment, however, as she lost seven of her next eight bouts, beginning with a world title unification against WIBF world Super Bantamweight champion Michele Aboro on May 13, 2000. Brown lost a ten round split decision, and her IFBA world title, to Aboro in Germany. Other boxers that defeated her during this period included Alicia Ashley, Kathy Williams and Lisa Brown (twice). Her only win during those eight bouts came against Ria Ramnarine, by a knockout in round four, on July 27 of 2001.

After defeating Renee Richardt, she was given another chance at the WIBF world Super Bantamweight title, flying over to Austria, where she lost to Esther Schouten by a ten round decision, on June 9, 2002. That loss marked the beginning of another losing streak for Brown, as she lost her next three bouts as well. These included a defeat at the hands of Ada Vélez. She broke that streak with a fourth round knockout of Terri Cruz on April 23, 2004, in Denver, Colorado.

After another loss and a win, she was given another chance at becoming world champion again, and, on November 20, Brown took on Stephaney George of Guyana for the WIBC world Bantamweight title, in Poughkeepsie, New York. Brown won a world title on a second division when she beat George by a unanimous decision, on a fight that the judges saw as a one-sided affair (all three judges scored the fight 100–90 in favor of Brown).

Leona Brown holds a professional boxing record of 13 wins and 14 losses, with 5 knockout wins.

<doc id="1280993" wikidata="Q2947735" url="?curid=1280993" title="HMS Superb (1798)">
<text>HMS &quot;Superb&quot; was a 74-gun third-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, and the fourth vessel to bear the name. She was launched on 19 March 1798 from Northfleet, and was eventually broken up in 1826. &quot;Superb&quot; is mostly associated with Richard Goodwin Keats who commanded her as captain from 1801 until his promotion in 1806. Keats famously spent only one night (in Algiers) out of the ship during four and a half years out of a home port. She also served as his flagship from early 1808 until she was paid off in 1809.

Keats&#x27;s captain&#x27;s orders for the ship were comprehensive and used by the fledgling US navy, being found on USS Philadelphia in 1803 and the USS President a decade later.

==Battle of Algeciras Bay==
In July 1801 the &quot;Superb&quot; was stationed off Cadiz and took part in the second Battle of Algeciras Bay. During the French and Spanish retreat Admiral Sir James Saumarez hailed the &quot;Superb&quot; and ordered Keats to catch the allied fleet&#x27;s rear and engage. The &quot;Superb&quot; was a relatively new ship and had not been long on blockade duty. As a consequence she was the fastest sailing ship-of-the-line in the fleet. As night fell on 12 July, Keats sailed the &quot;Superb&quot; alongside the 112-gun on her starboard side. Another Spanish ship, the 112-gun , was sailing abreast, on the port side, of the &quot;Real Carlos&quot;. Keats fired into the &quot;Real Carlos&quot; and some shot passed her and struck the &quot;San Hermenegildo&quot;. The &quot;Real Carlos&quot; caught fire and Keats disengaged her to continue up the line. In the darkness the two Spanish ships confused one another for British ships and began a furious duel. With the &quot;Real Carlos&quot; aflame the captain of the &quot;Hermenegildo&quot; determined to take advantage and crossed the &quot;Real Carlos&quot;’ stern in order to deal a fatal broadside that would run the length of the ship through the unprotected stern. A sudden gust of wind brought the two ships together and entangled their rigging. The &quot;Hermenegildo&quot; also caught fire and the two enormous three-deck ships exploded. The &quot;Superb&quot; continued on relatively unscathed and engaged the French 74-gun under Commodore Julien le Roy. The &quot;Saint Antoine&quot; struck after a fierce exchange of broadsides.

Following the treaty of Amiens she was stationed in the Mediterranean keeping watch over the French in Toulon. On renewal of the wars Nelson took command of the Mediterranean fleet, including Keats and the Superb. They accompanied Nelson in the pursuit of Villeneuve to the West Indies and back. The &quot;Superb&quot;, now three years out of home port, was in a poor state, giving rise to the poem &quot;The Old Superb&quot; by Henry Newbolt (set to music in 1904 by Stanford in his &quot;Songs of the Sea&quot;). As early as May 1804 Nelson wrote &quot;the Superb must be sent to England before that period [winter] arrives, as her stem and the knees of her head are loose and broke—nothing but the great exertions of Captain Keats has kept her at sea this last season&quot;. She arrived at Algiers 10 June 1804. On their return to Cadiz the &quot;Superb&quot; was ordered home for a refit—which resulted in the ship, captain and crew missing Trafalgar.

==Battle of San Domingo==
She was the flagship of Admiral John Thomas Duckworth, with Richard Goodwin Keats her captain when they reached Cadiz after Trafalgar and were ordered to maintain the blockade of the remaining French fleet.

Duckworth abandoned the blockade in pursuit of a French squadron reported to have been in the Atlantic near Madeira. Duckworth came across another squadron in the West Indies which lead the Battle of San Domingo, (the last fleet battle of the age of sail on the open sea) in which the English destroyed or captured nearly the entirety of the French squadron, the frigates only escaping.

==Copenhagen and the Baltic==
On 26 July 1808, &quot;Superb&quot;, , and captured &quot;Falck and Kline Wiloelm&quot;.

&quot;Superb&quot; was commissioned in December 1809 under the command of Captain Samuel Jackson. She went out to the Baltic as Keats&#x27;s flagship, and was part of the squadron there under Admiral Sir James Saumarez. There she was engaged in convoy duties in the Sound and Great Belt protecting British merchants from the predation of Danish gun-boats.

The squadron under Keats&#x27;s command, including the Superb successfully undertook the evacuation of La Romana&#x27;s division of the Spanish northern army from the Danish islands, taking the port of Nyborg, commandeering 57 small boats in the harbour and transferring the men to nearby Langeland before forming a convoy upwards of 70 craft taking the 9,000 men to Gothenburg.

Superb returned to Portsmouth, and underwent repairs between September 1811 and November 1812, before commissioning in September 1812 under Captain Charles Paget.

==War of 1812==
Paget was appointed to command &quot;Superb&quot; as part of the Channel Fleet, and during a cruise in the Bay of Biscay he took several prizes.

On 13 February 1813 , which had been sailing from New York to Bordeaux, arrived at Bideford. She was a prize to &quot;Superb&quot;. Captain Paget described the prize as &quot;the fine
American brig Star, of three hundred and fifty tons, six guns, and thirty-five men.&quot;

In 1814 &quot;Superb&quot; was employed on the coast of North America under the orders of Sir Alexander Cochrane and took part in an attack upon Wareham, Massachusetts during the War of 1812.

<text>Vintilă Ion Constantin Brătianu (16 September 1867 – 22 December 1930) was a Romanian politician who served as Prime Minister of Romania between 24 November 1927 and 9 November 1928. He and his brothers Ion I. C. Brătianu and Dinu Brătianu were the leaders of the National Liberal Party of Romania, founded by their father, Ion C. Brătianu.

==Biography==
Born at his family&#x27;s estate of &quot;Florica&quot;, in Ștefănești, Argeș County, Vintilă Brătianu started his studies at Saint Sava High School in Bucharest. He then went to France to study engineering at École Centrale Paris from 1886 to 1890. After returning to Romania, he entered politics.

From 1907 to 1911 he was Mayor of Bucharest. During World War I, he was 
Minister of War (15 August 1916–19 July 1917) and then Minister for War Munitions. 

After the war, he served as Finance Minister (19 January 1922–9 March 1926) in the Liberal government led by his brother, Ion. After his brother died on 24 November 1927, he assumed the post of Prime Minister of Romania until he was forced to resign a year later to allow the new National Peasants&#x27; Party government of Iuliu Maniu to take office. In November 1927 he also assumed the presidency of the National Liberal Party; he remained in that position until the end of his life. 

On 22 December 1930 Brătianu was at his estate in Mihăești, Vâlcea, when he had a stroke of apoplexy which paralyzed his left side; he died that evening at the hospital in nearby Râmnicu Vâlcea. He is buried at the family estate, Florica, in a crypt where also lie his father Ion C. Brătianu and his brother Ion I. C. Brătianu, as well as his other brother, Dinu Brătianu, and his nephew, Gheorghe I. Brătianu, both of whom died in the early 1950s at Sighet Prison.

<text>The North American beaver (Castor canadensis) is one of two extant beaver species, along with the Eurasian beaver (&quot;Castor fiber&quot;). It is native to North America and has been introduced in South America (Patagonia) and Europe (primarily Finland and Karelia). The North American beaver is one of the national symbols of Canada and the official state mammal of Oregon and New York. North American beavers are widespread across the continental United States, Canada, southern Alaska, and some parts of northern Mexico.

In Canada and the United States, the North American beaver is often referred to simply as &quot;beaver&quot;, although this can cause some confusion because another distantly related rodent, &quot;Aplodontia rufa&quot;, is often called the &quot;mountain beaver&quot;. Other vernacular names, including American beaver and Canadian beaver, distinguish this species from the other extant beaver species, &quot;Castor fiber&quot;, which is native to Eurasia. 

==Taxonomy==
===Evolution===
The first fossil records of beavers are 10 to 12 million years old in Germany, and they are thought to have migrated to North America across the Bering Strait. The oldest fossil record of beavers in North America are of two beaver teeth near Dayville, Oregon, and are 7 million years old.

===Subspecies===
At one time, 25 subspecies of beavers were identified in North America, with distinctions based primarily on slight morphological differences and geographical isolation at the time of discovery. However, modern techniques generally use genetics rather than morphology to distinguish between subspecies, and currently the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (which provides authoritative taxonomic information on plants, animals, fungi, and microbes of North America and the world) does not recognize any subspecies of &quot;C. canadensis, &quot;though a definitive genetic analysis has not been performed. Such an analysis would be complicated by the fact that substantial genetic mixing of populations has occurred because of the numerous reintroduction efforts intended to help the species recover following extirpation from many regions.

The most widespread (formerly recognized) subspecies, which perhaps are now best thought of as populations with some distinct physical characteristics, are &quot;C. c. acadicus&quot; (New England beaver), &quot;C. c. canadensis&quot; (Canadian beaver), &quot;C. c. carolinensis&quot; (Carolina beaver), and &quot;C. c. missouriensis&quot; (Missouri River beaver). The Canadian beaver originally inhabited almost all of the forested area of Canada, and because of its more valued fur, was often selected for reintroductions elsewhere. The Carolina beaver is found in the southeastern United States; the Missouri River beaver, as its name suggests, is found in the Missouri River and its tributaries; and &quot;C. c. acadicus&quot; is found throughout the New England area in the northeastern United States.

==Description==

The beaver is the largest rodent in North America and competes with its Eurasian counterpart, the European beaver, for being the third-largest in the world, both following the South American capybara and lesser capybara. The European species is slightly larger on average but the American has a larger known maximum size. Adults usually weigh from , with being typical. In New York, the average weight of adult male beavers was , while non-native females in Finland averaged . However, adults of both sexes averaged in Ohio. The species seems to conform to Bergmann&#x27;s rule, as northern animals appear to be larger. In the Northwest Territory, adults weighed a median of . The American beaver is slightly smaller in average body mass than the Eurasian species. The head-and-body length of adult North American beavers is , with the tail adding a further . Very old individuals can exceptionally exceed normal sizes, weighing more than or even as much as (higher than the maximum known for the Eurasian beaver).

Like the capybara, the beaver is semiaquatic. The beaver has many traits suited to this lifestyle. It has a large, flat, paddle-shaped tail and large, webbed hind feet. The unwebbed front paws are smaller, with claws. The forepaws are highly dextrous, and are used both for digging, and to fold individual leaves into their mouth and to rotate small, pencil-sized stems as they gnaw off bark. The eyes are covered by a nictitating membrane which allows the beaver to see under water. The nostrils and ears are sealed while submerged. Their lips can be closed behind their front teeth so that they can continue to gnaw underwater. A thick layer of fat under its skin insulates the beaver from its coldwater environment.

The beaver&#x27;s fur consists of long, coarse outer hairs and short, fine inner hairs (see Double coat). The fur has a range of colors, but usually is dark brown. Scent glands near the genitals secrete an oily substance known as castoreum, which the beaver uses to waterproof its fur. There is also another set of oil glands producing unique chemical identifiers in the form of waxy esters and fatty acids. The lush, workable fur was made into a number of products, most notably hats. Demand for furs for hats drove beavers nearly to the point of extinction, and the North American species was saved principally by a sudden change in style.

The beaver possesses continuously (or constantly) growing incisors, and is a hindgut fermenter whose cecum, populated by symbiotic bacteria, helps to digest plant-based material. These traits are not unique to beavers, and are in fact present among all rodents. Nonetheless, the beaver is remarkably specialized for the efficient digestion of its lignocellulose-heavy diet.

Brain anatomy of the beaver is not particularly specialized for its semiaquatic life history. The brain masses of a beaver weighing 11.7 and 17 kg are 41 and 45 g respectively. &quot;C. canadensis&quot; has an encephalization quotient of 0.9 compared to other rodents; this is intermediate between similar terrestrial rodents and arboreal squirrels, and higher than similar aquatic terrestrial rodents, the muskrats and nutria. The cerebrum is well developed, and the neocortex comparatively large. Larger areas of the beaver&#x27;s somatosensory cortex are dedicated to the processing of stimuli from the lips and the hands, more so than the tail and whiskers, which play a relatively minor role. The visual area of the brain is smaller than the gray squirrel.

== Distribution ==
Before their near-extirpation by trapping in North America, beavers were practically ubiquitous and lived from south of the arctic tundra to the deserts of northern Mexico, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans. They are widely distributed in boreal and temperate ecoregions, where populations are rebounding from historic over-exploitation. Recently, beaver have been observed colonizing arctic tundra, likely as a result of climate-induced increases in riparian shrubs.

Physician naturalist Edgar Alexander Mearns&#x27; 1907 report of beaver on the Sonora River may be the earliest report on the southernmost range of this North American aquatic mammal. However, beavers have also been reported both historically and contemporarily in Mexico on the Colorado River, Bavispe River, and San Bernardino River in the Mexican states of Sonora and Chihuahua.

==Behavior==

Beavers are active mainly at night. They are excellent swimmers and may remain submerged up to 15 minutes. More vulnerable on land, they tend to remain in the water as much as possible. They use their flat, scaly tail both to signal danger by slapping the surface of the water and as a location for fat storage.

They construct their homes, or &quot;lodges&quot;, out of sticks, twigs, rocks, and mud in lakes, streams, and tidal river deltas. These lodges may be surrounded by water, or touching land, including burrows dug into river banks. Beavers are well known for building dams across streams and constructing their lodges in the artificial ponds which form. When building in a pond, the beavers first make a pile of sticks and then eat out one or more underwater entrances and two platforms above the water surface inside the pile. The first is used for drying off. Towards winter, the lodge is often plastered with mud which, when it freezes, has the consistency of concrete. A small air hole is left in the top of the lodge.

=== Dam-building ===
The purpose of the dam is to create a deepwater refuge enabling the beaver to escape from predators. When deep water is already present in lakes, rivers, or larger streams, the beaver may dwell in a bank burrow and bank lodge with an underwater entrance. The beaver dam is constructed using branches from trees the beavers cut down, as well as rocks, grass, and mud. Where naturally-occurring woody material is limiting, beavers may build their dams largely of rocks. The inner bark, twigs, shoots, and leaves of such trees are also an important part of the beaver&#x27;s diet. The trees are cut down using their strong incisor teeth. Their front paws are used for digging and carrying and placing materials. The sound of running water dictates when and where a beaver builds its dam. Besides providing a safe home for the beaver, beaver ponds also provide habitat for waterfowl, fish, and other aquatic animals. Their dams help reduce soil erosion and can help reduce flooding. However, beaver dams are not permanent and depend on the beavers&#x27; continued presence for their maintenance. Beavers generally concentrate on building and repairing dams in the fall in preparation for the coming winter. In northern areas, they often do not repair breaches in the dam made by otters, and sometimes breach the dam themselves and lower the water level in the pond to create more breathing space under the ice or get easier access to trees below the dam. In a 1988 study in Alberta, Canada, no beavers repaired &quot;sites of water loss&quot; during the winter. Of 178 sites of water loss, beavers repaired 78 when water was opened, and did not repair 68. The rest were partially repaired.

Beavers are best known for their dam-building. They maintain their pond-habitat by reacting quickly to the sound of running water, and damming it up with tree branches and mud. Early ecologists believed that this dam-building was an amazing feat of architectural planning, indicative of the beaver&#x27;s high intellect. This theory was tested when a recording of running water was played in a field near a beaver pond. Although it was on dry land, the beaver covered the tape player with branches and mud. The largest beaver dam is in length—more than half a mile long—and was discovered via satellite imagery in 2007. It is located on the southern edge of Wood Buffalo National Park in northern Alberta and is more than twice the width of the Hoover Dam which spans .
Normally, the purpose of the dam is to provide water around their lodges that is deep enough that it does not freeze solid in winter. The dams also flood areas of surrounding forest, giving the beaver safe access to an important food supply, which is the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees. In colder climates where their pond freezes over, beavers also build a food cache from this food resource. To form the cache, beavers collect food in late fall in the form of tree branches, storing them under water (usually by sticking the sharp chewed base of the branches into the mud on the pond bottom), where they can be accessed through the winter. Often, the pile of food branches projects above the pond and collects snow. This insulates the water below it and keeps the pond open at that location. The frozen combination of branches and ice is known as a cap, sealing the food cache. Beavers often maintain an underwater entrance to their dam, and they can access their food cache from their lodge by swimming under the ice. In warmer climes, a winter food store is less common.

Muskrats have been thought to steal food from beaver lodges, but seemingly cooperative relationships exist, with beavers allowing muskrats to reside in their lodge if they gather fresh reeds.

=== Canals ===
Another component to the beaver&#x27;s habitat is the canal. Canals are used to float logs to a pond, and dams may also be used to maintain the water levels in these canals. Several land trails can extend from the canals. Despite being widespread in some beaver-inhabited areas, beaver canals and their environmental effects are much less studied than beaver dams. Beaver primarily develop canals to increase accessibility of river resources, facilitate transport of acquired resources, and to decrease the risk of predation. Beaver canals can be over 0.5 km in length. Beavers build canals by pushing through soil and vegetation using their forelimbs.

It has been hypothesized that beavers&#x27; canals are not only transportation routes to extend foraging, but also an extension of their &quot;central place&quot; around the lodge and/or food cache. A 2012 study of beavers&#x27; mark on the landscape found that cut stumps were negatively related to distance from beaver canals, but not to the central body of water. This finding suggested that beavers may consider the canals to be part of their &quot;central place&quot; as far as foraging activity is concerned.

=== Social behavior ===

Communication is highly developed in beaver, including scent marking, vocalization, and tail slapping. Beaver deposit castoreum on piles of debris and mud called scent mounds, which are usually placed on or near lodges, dams, and trails less than a meter from water. Over 100 of such mounds can be constructed within one territory. Beaver colonies with close neighbors constructed more &quot;scent mounds&quot; than did isolated colonies, and the number of scent mounds at each active lodge is correlated with the distance to the nearest occupied lodge.

Although seven vocal sounds have been described for beaver, most zoologists recognize only three: a whine, hiss, and growl. Vocalizations and tail slapping may be used to beg for food, signal to family members to warn of predators, or to drive away or elicit a response from predators.

Beavers usually mate for life, forming familial colonies. Beaver &quot;kits&quot; are born precocious and with a developed coat. The young beaver &quot;kits&quot; typically remain with their parents up to two years. Kits express some adult behaviors, but require a long period in the family to develop their dam construction skills, and other abilities required for independent life.

=== Diet ===
Beavers are herbivorous generalists with sophisticated foraging preferences. Beavers consume a mix of herbaceous and woody plants, which varies considerably in both composition and species diversity by region and season. They prefer aspen and other poplars, but also take birch, maple, willow, alder, black cherry, red oak, beech, ash, hornbeam, and occasionally pine and spruce. They also eat cattails, water lilies, and other aquatic vegetation, especially in the early spring. Contrary to widespread belief, they do not eat fish.

Beavers select food based on taste, coarse physical shape, and odor. Beavers feed on wood, bark, cambium, branches, twigs, roots, buds, leaves, stems, sprouts, and in some cases, the sap and storax of pine and sweetgum.

When herbaceous plants are actively growing, they make up much of the beaver&#x27;s diet. In the winter, beavers switch to woody plants and the food they have stored over the winter. The protein to calorie ratio of a beaver&#x27;s diet is 40 mg/calorie in summer and 8 mg/calorie for the rest of the year. In northern latitudes, the water lilies &quot;Nymphaea&quot; and &quot;Nuphar&quot; are the most important herbaceous component. The rhizomes are stored in the food cache and remain actively growing.

Willow is an important protein source and is likely to be available for the longest period of time in a beaver&#x27;s habitat especially in the far north. When available, aspen and poplar are preferred over willow. Conifers are also cut or gnawed by beavers, and used for food and/or building material.

Beavers do not necessarily use the same trees as construction material and as food. Inedible material is more likely to be used as the cap of a beaver family&#x27;s food cache, the upper part which is frozen in the ice, while the cache itself is composed of edible, high quality branches, which remain unfrozen and accessible.

Beavers avoid red maple, which can be the only tree left standing at the edges of some beaver ponds.

The beaver&#x27;s gut microbiome is complex and specialized for a wood-heavy diet, sharing a number of similarities with other mammalian herbivores. However the microbial community in the beaver shows less taxonomic diversity than the &quot;typical&quot; mammalian gut. The major operational taxonomic units (OTU) are Bacteroidota and Bacillota.

=== Predators ===

Common natural predators include coyotes, wolves, and mountain lions. American black bears may also prey on beavers if the opportunity arises, often by smashing their paws into the beavers&#x27; lodges. Perhaps due to differing habitat preferences, grizzly bears were not known to hunt beavers in Denali National Park, Alaska. Less significant predators include wolverines, which may attack a rare beaver of up to adult size, and Canada lynx, bobcats, and foxes (predators of kits or very sick or injured animals, rather than full-grown beavers due to their increasingly smaller size). American alligators, which only minimally co-exist in the wild with beavers, also seldom threaten them. Both golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;) and bald eagles (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;) may on occasion prey on a beaver, most likely only small kits. Despite repeated claims, no evidence shows that North American river otters are typically predators of beavers but anecdotally may take a rare beaver kit.

==Reproduction==
North American beavers have one litter per year, coming into estrus for only 12 to 24 hours, between late December and May but peaking in January. Unlike most other rodents, beaver pairs are monogamous, staying together for multiple breeding seasons. Gestation averages 128 days and they have a range of three to six kits per litter (usually 4–5). Most beavers do not reproduce until they are three years of age, but about 20% of two-year-old females reproduce.

==Differences from European beaver==
Although North American beavers are superficially similar to the European beaver (&quot;Castor fiber&quot;), several important differences exist between the two species. North American beavers tend to be slightly smaller, with smaller, more rounded heads; shorter, wider muzzles; thicker, longer, and darker underfur; wider, more oval-shaped tails; and longer shin bones, allowing them a greater range of bipedal locomotion than the European species. North American beavers have shorter nasal bones than their European relatives, with the widest point being at the middle of the snout for the former, and in the tip for the latter. The nasal opening for the North American species is square, unlike that of the European species, which is triangular. The foramen magnum is triangular in the North American beaver, and rounded in the European. The anal glands of the North American beaver are smaller and thick-walled with a small internal volume compared to that of the European species. Finally, the guard hairs of the North American beaver have a shorter hollow medulla at their tips. Fur color is also different. Overall, 50% of North American beavers have pale brown fur, 25% are reddish brown, 20% are brown, and 6% are blackish, while in European beavers, 66% have pale brown or beige fur, 20% are reddish brown, nearly 8% are brown, and only 4% have blackish coats.

The two species are not genetically compatible. North American beavers have 40 chromosomes, while European beavers have 48. Also, more than 27 attempts were made in Russia to hybridize the two species, with one breeding between a male North American beaver and a female European resulting in one stillborn kit. These factors make interspecific breeding unlikely in areas where the two species&#x27; ranges overlap.

==Ecology==

The beaver was trapped out and almost extirpated in North America because its fur and castoreum were highly sought after. The beaver furs were used to make clothing and beaver hats. In the United States, extensive trapping began in the early 17th century, with more than 10,000 beaver per year taken for the fur trade in Connecticut and Massachusetts between 1620 and 1630. From 1630 to 1640, around 80,000 beavers were taken annually from the Hudson River and western New York. From 1670 onwards, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company sent two or three trading ships into the bay every year to take furs to England from Canada. Archaeological and historical evidence suggests that beaver ponds created &quot;moth-hole like&quot; habitats in the deciduous forest that dominated eastern North America. This nonforest habitat attracted both Native American and early colonial hunters to the abundant fish, waterfowl, and large game attracted to the riparian clearings created by these aquatic mammals. The first colonial farmers were also attracted to the fertile, flat bottomlands created by the accumulated silt and organic matter in beaver ponds.

As eastern beaver populations were depleted, English, French, and American trappers pushed west. Much of the westward expansion and exploration of North America was driven by the quest for this animal&#x27;s fur. Before the 1849 California Gold Rush, an earlier, 19th-century California Fur Rush drove the earliest American settlement in that state. During the roughly 30 years (1806–1838) of the era of the mountain man, the West from Missouri to California and from Canada to Mexico was thoroughly explored and the beaver was brought to the brink of extinction.

With protection in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the current beaver population has rebounded to an estimated 10 to 15 million; this is a fraction of the originally estimated 100 to 200 million North American beavers before the days of the fur trade.

These animals are considered pests in parts of their range because their dams can cause flooding, or because their habit of felling trees can pose danger to people, as in Charlotte, North Carolina&#x27;s Park Road Park. Because they are persistent in repairing damage to the dam, they were historically relocated or exterminated. Nonlethal methods of containing beaver-related flooding have been developed. One such flow device has been used by both the Canadian and U.S. governments, called &quot;beaver deceivers&quot; or levelers, invented and pioneered by wildlife biologist Skip Lisle.

The beaver is a keystone species, increasing biodiversity in its territory through creation of ponds and wetlands. As wetlands are formed and riparian habitats enlarged, aquatic plants colonize newly available watery habitat. Insect, invertebrate, fish, mammal, and bird diversities are also expanded. Effects of beaver recolonization on native and non-native species in streams where they have been historically absent, particularly dryland streams, is not well-researched.

==Relationship with humans==
===As introduced non-native species===

In the 1940s, beavers were brought to Tierra del Fuego in southern Chile and Argentina for commercial fur production and introduced near Fagnano Lake. Although the fur enterprise failed, 25 mating pairs of beavers were released into the wild. Having no natural predators in their new environment, they quickly spread throughout the main island, and to other islands in the archipelago, reaching a number of 100,000 individuals within just 50 years. Although they have been considered an invasive species, it has been more recently shown that the beaver have some beneficial ecological effects on native fish and should not be considered wholly detrimental. Although the dominant Lenga beech (&quot;Nothofagus pumilio&quot;) forest can regenerate from stumps, most of the newly created beaver wetlands are being colonized by the rarer native Antarctic beech (&quot;Nothofagus antarctica&quot;). It is not known whether the shrubbier Antarctic beech will be succeeded by the originally dominant and larger Lengo beech, however, and the beaver wetlands are readily colonized by non-native plant species. In contrast, areas with introduced beaver were associated with increased populations of the native catadromous puye fish (&quot;Galaxias maculatus&quot;). Furthermore, the beavers did not seem to have a highly beneficial impact on the exotic brook trout (&quot;Salvelinus fontinalis&quot;) and rainbow trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;) which have negative impacts on native stream fishes in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve, Chile. They have also been found to cross saltwater to islands northward; and reached the Chilean mainland in the 1990s. On balance, because of their landscape-wide modifications to the Fuegian environment and because biologists want to preserve the unique biota of the region, most favor their removal.

North American beavers were released in Finland in 1937, before it was realized that they formed a separate species; following this, 7 beavers expanded to a population of 12,000 within 64 years. Eurasian beavers had earlier been extirpated from the region, so the release was intended as a reintroduction project. By 1999, it was estimated that 90% of beavers in Finland were the American species. However, the species is not always considered invasive, as in Europe it has a similar keystone effect to European beavers, which have not recolonized the area. The beaver population has been controlled by issuing hunting licenses. A report in 2010 concluded that while the current population of American beavers was not problematic, as the species has larger litters than European beavers and builds somewhat larger dams, it could become a problem if its range continues expanding into Russia, but this does not seem to be taking place.

In Europe, significant invasive populations of Canadian beaver are only present in Finland and Karelia, as the boundary between species has somewhat stabilized, but smaller occurrences have been detected elsewhere. Ephemeral populations of &quot;C. canadensis&quot; in Germany and Poland were found from the 1950s to 1970s. Zoo escapes in 2006 created a small population of invasive &quot;C. canadensis&quot; in Luxembourg, Rhineland-Palatinate, and Belgium. American beavers have not been detected in Sweden, Norway, or Denmark.

===As food===
Beaver meat is similar tasting to lean beef, but care must be taken to prevent contamination from the animal&#x27;s strong castor (musk) gland. It is usually slow-cooked in a broth, and was a valuable food source to Native Americans. Early French Canadian Catholics considered beaver to be &quot;four-legged fish&quot; that could be eaten at Lent.

===Symbolism===
As one of the national symbols of Canada, the North American beaver is depicted on the Canadian nickel. This beaver was also featured on the first Canadian postage stamp, the Three Penny Beaver, which is considered the first postage stamp to show an animal instead of a head of state. It is also the state animal of Oregon and New York of the United States, and a common school emblem for engineering schools, including the California Institute of Technology, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Alberta as well as the mascot for Oregon State University, Babson College, and the City College of New York. A beaver is featured prominently on the stamp and seal issued to Professional Engineers and Geoscientists by APEGA. It also appears on the back on the state flag of Oregon. The beaver also appears in the coats of arms of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, University of Toronto, Wilfrid Laurier University, and the London School of Economics.

The beaver is also the symbol of the Royal Canadian Engineers both combat and civil. 

Busy beaver is a term in theoretical computer science which refers to a terminating program of a given size that produces the most output possible.

Much of the early economy of New Netherland was based on the beaver fur trade. As such, the seal of New Netherland featured the beaver; likewise, the coats of arms of Albany, New York and New York City included the beaver.

<text>Jasus edwardsii, the southern rock lobster, red rock lobster, or spiny rock lobster, is a species of spiny lobster found throughout coastal waters of southern Australia and New Zealand including the Chatham Islands. It is commonly called crayfish in Australia and New Zealand and &quot;&quot; in Māori. They resemble lobsters, but lack the large characteristic pincers on the first pair of walking legs.

Spiny rock lobsters are carnivorous, leaving their rock cover to venture out to feed during the night. They live in and around reefs at depths ranging from deep at the continental shelf. They can be dark red and orange above with paler yellowish abdomens or grey-green brown with the paler underside. The more tropical animals tend to have the brighter colours. Adult carapaces can grow up to in length and can often exceed in underfished areas.

==Distribution==
&quot;Jasus edwardsii&quot; is found around most of the coast of New Zealand, including the three main islands, the Three Kings Islands, the Chatham Islands, the Snares Islands, the Bounty Islands, the Antipodes Islands and the Auckland Islands. This last locality is the southernmost place where spiny lobsters occur in the world. In Australia, &quot;J. edwardsii&quot; is found around the southern coast, from central New South Wales to southern Western Australia, including Tasmania.

==Life cycle==
Adults are sexually mature at between 7 and 11 years, mating occurs during late summer and autumn. Eggs develop on females, which carry between 100,000 and 500,000 eggs which are fertilised and held below the tail on hairs on the female&#x27;s abdomen. The eggs develop here for 3 to 5 months. Eggs then metamorphose into naupliosoma larva which leave the female and are free swimming plankton which migrate towards the surface where they moult into a phyllosoma larva.

The rock lobster has among the longest larval development known for any marine creature. The &quot;phyllosoma&quot; (Greek for &quot;leaf-like&quot;) larvae spend between 9 months to 2 years in oceanic waters before metamorphosing to the post larval stage, known as the puerulus, which then swims towards the coast to settle.

==Size==
Maximum total body length is 58 cm (males), and 43 cm (females); maximum carapace lengths 23.5 cm (males), 18 cm (females); minimum legal carapace lengths vary depending on location. In some areas, &quot;Jasus edwardsii&quot; are frequently harvested weighing over 4.5kg.

==As food==
&quot;Jasus edwardsii&quot; is prized by consumers in Oceania, China and South-East Asia for its sweet, succulent flesh. Like true lobster, it can be served boiled, steamed, grilled or raw. A$250 million worth are harvested every year in Australia alone.

==Aquaculture==
The potential for &quot;Jasus edwardsii&quot; to become an aquaculture species in New Zealand is high. Although not commercially farmed yet, this species of lobster has a wild seed stock available and already some commercial companies are harvesting and on growing this seed stock. The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) has reared individuals from egg to adult, showing that it is possible to grow this species in captivity, although it takes between 200 and 400 days to reach maturity.

This species is also a potential aquaculture species in Australia. There is already a well established export of wild rock lobster from Australia, especially Southern Australia which currently lands just over 3000 tonnes a year. An aquaculture of this species would serve to bulk up the wild catch and add value with high quality grown lobsters.

South Australia currently does have limited aquaculture of &quot;Jasus edwardsii&quot;, keeping legal sized individuals from the fishery in cages in Kangaroo Island to make them available in the off season, ensuring a year-round supply to market, although no aquaculture from juveniles or eggs is done yet.

===Food===
NIWA used primarily brine shrimp to feed the juvenile lobsters, but little is known about a preferred food source. Chopped up mussel flesh has been used previously in Japan. Both these techniques carry some potential disadvantages – brine shrimp can introduce disease, and mussels deteriorate once introduced to the water, giving bacteria an environment to grow on. A study has shown that mussels provide the best food along with a carbohydrate source in the form of agar, allowing faster grow rates in the lobster.

===Techniques===
The most promising technique for aquaculture in New Zealand is sea cages. These have been successfully used internationally to grow similar species. In Vietnam sea cages are used to grow large amounts of &quot;Panulirus ornatus&quot; (ornate spiny lobster) in excess of 1,500 t valued at US$90 million. This species is also commercially cultured in Indonesia and the Philippines.

There are three main types of sea cage – floating, wooden fixed, and submerged.
*Floating cages as the name suggests are floating, nets are supported by floating buoys which are connected using a frame. They are often far above the seabed in waters deep in calm bays. This type of cage is used in Nga Trang Bay in Vietnam. Wooden fixed cages are near the bottom, or on the bottom of the sea and each net is attached to salt resistant wooden stakes driven into the ground in squares with nets between them. These may be on the seabed with sand covering the bottom of the cage. These cages are used in Van Phong Bay in Vietnam.
*Submerged cages are sealed cubic cages with feeding holes in one end that are attached to the seabed. Similar to crab and crayfish pots used to catch adults. These cages are used in Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam. Often the materials used to make these cages are sourced locally, in the form of nets from fishing, wood and other framing materials and floats.
*There has been experimental work done in New Zealand with suspended cages which resulted in good grow rates and survivability as long as suitable sites are picked.

===Sites===
The sites for lobster farms should be in shallow water (not exceeding 20 m) and sheltered from currents and swell as well as potential strong winds. Often behind islands and in sheltered bays are the best sites as the sea cages are easily damaged by swell and high winds. Also the type of sea cage affects the site, floating and submerged cages can be in deeper water, and wooden fixed cages have to be in water only a few metres deep.

===Seed stock===
Due to the time it takes larva to develop (up to two years) the most cost-effective method of lobster aquaculture is to harvest wild pueruli. This has been done in Vietnam and has been done previously in New Zealand. This would allow a faster grow time to adults as the caught juvenile will have already had months of growth before being put in cages for aquaculture. There is a good source of pueruli in New Zealand (in places like Gisborne) and research into effective catching of pueruli is currently being done. Research suggests a &#x27;bottle brush&#x27; collector as the most effective way, a mesh material attached to a PVC core resembling a bottle brush.

The maximum sustainable yield of this seed stock is unknown and research will have to be carried out to determine this before an industry can be founded.

===Market===
This species provides New Zealand with a high price point aquaculture species in an industry dominated by low price species. New Zealand baited pot wild lobsters earn approximately $180 million per annum which is limited by the Quota Management System to a total allowable commercial catch (TACC) of 2,981 metric tonnes.

<text>Abrar-ul-Haq () is a Pakistani singer-songwriter, philanthropist, and a politician. 

His debut 1995 album &quot;Billo De Ghar&quot; sold over 40.3million albums worldwide, which made him a household name and granted him the title of &quot;King of Pakistani pop&quot;.

Abrar-ul-Haq is the founder and chairman of Sahara for Life Trust, a private organization that has been providing health services to the people of Narowal and surrounding areas since 1998. He was Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf&#x27;s candidate for the seat of National Assembly from constituency NA-78 (Narowal-II) in the 2018 Pakistani general election.

== Early life and education ==
Abrar-ul-Haq was born in Faisalabad, Punjab to a civil servant father, and is the youngest among eight siblings. He belongs to Punjabi Jat family of the Kahlon clan and his elder brother Major (r) Israr-ul-Haq Kahlon is an active politician in Narowal.

He was initially educated at the Junior Model School, Gujrat later graduating from the Sir Syed College, Rawalpindi before getting his Master&#x27;s degree in social sciences from the Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad.

Abrar-ul-Haq served as a teacher in Aitchison College, Lahore for a brief period of time but quit the faculty when he opted for a music career.

== Music career ==

His first album as singer was &quot;Billo De Ghar&quot;, which was released in 1995.

=== Controversies ===
Abrar-ul-Haq&#x27;s songs have been a subject of controversy in Pakistan. After the release of the hit song &quot;Billo De Ghar&quot; in 1995, Urdu newspapers began quoting Islamic scholars of Lahore who were of the opinion that the song was describing a man falling in love with a prostitute and wanting to marry her. Upon the formation of Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s PML-N majority government after the 1997 election, the song was banned from state-owned TV and radio channels.

In the early 2000s, his song &quot;Nach Punjaban&quot; was met with opposition from those who thought the casual use of the word &quot;Punjaban&quot; was a demeaning way to address Punjabi women, eventually resulting in Abrar-ul-Haq re-recording a version of the song using the word &quot;Majajan&quot; instead.

In 2007, the Supreme Court of Pakistan summoned the singer for an explanation of the song &quot;Parveen&quot; from the album &quot;Nara Sada Ishq Aye&quot;, alleging that it used the name Parveen in a derogatory manner that would hurt the sentiments of society.

In 2019, his song &quot;Chamkeeli&quot; was the subject of a claim in a civil court in Lahore, with the courts requesting that the song be banned and removed from YouTube, alleging that it was humiliating and insulting to both men and women.

== Philanthropy ==
=== Sahara for Life Trust ===
Abrar-ul-Haq is the Founder and Chairman of Sahara for Life Trust (SLT), a post he has held since its inception in 1998. SLT is a private organization promoting health and education in remote areas. SAHARA stands for: &quot;Services Aimed at Health and Awakening in Remote Areas&quot;. SLT is recognized and registered as a leading charitable organization in Pakistan, the U.K, and the U.S. It is also certified by the Pakistan Center for Philanthropy (PCP) and the U.N. (under the charter of DESA). SLT has been involved in numerous relief and rehabilitation efforts over the years. In 2003, SLT established its first large-scale general hospital in Narowal, Pakistan. The Sughra Shafi Medical Hospital Complex is a PMDC-certified general hospital that provides a wide range of healthcare services to the people of Narowal and its surrounding areas. The location of this hospital also reduced the travel time for patients in critical condition who were unable to travel to major cities in a timely manner, thus saving lives.

<text>The Municipal Affairs Bureau (; ) of Macau is an administrative body without political powers responsible for providing certain civic services for the special administrative region and is the successor to the Civic and Municipal Affairs Bureau () which was abolished in 2019. The latter was formed to handle the functions of the former municipalities of Macau and their councils and assemblies that were abolished on 1 January 2002, slightly more than two years after Macau became a special administrative region (SAR) of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The body is under the Secretariat for Administration and Justice of the Macau government.

== History ==
Following the transfer of sovereignty over Macau from Portugal to China in 1999, the Portuguese administrative divisions of municipalities (concelhos) and parishes (freguesias) in Macau were kept provisionally in place: the provisional municipal council of Macau, the provisional municipal council of Ilhas, and the provisional municipal assemblies of each municipality.

On 31 December 2001, all the provisional organs were dissolved and the new Civic and Municipal Affairs Bureau (&quot;&quot; [IACM], ) took on the roles of the provisional municipal councils, starting from 1 January 2002, under the Secretariat for Administration and Justice of the Macau government.

The IACM was given a logo based on the Chinese Han character , for &quot;civilian&quot;.

In 2018, the Macau legislative assembly passed Law No. 9/2018 which abolished the IACM and created the Municipal Affairs Bureau in its place. All the functions of the former were transferred to the new bureau and a new 25-member municipal affairs advisory council was established. This came into effect on 1 January 2019.

<text>A View from the Bridge is a play by American playwright Arthur Miller. It was first staged on September 29, 1955, as a one-act verse drama with &quot;A Memory of Two Mondays&quot; at the Coronet Theatre on Broadway. The run was unsuccessful, and Miller subsequently revised and extended the play to contain two acts; this version is the one with which audiences are most familiar. The two-act version premiered in the New Watergate theatre club in London&#x27;s West End under the direction of Peter Brook on October 11, 1956.

The play is set in 1950s America, in an Italian-American neighborhood near the Brooklyn Bridge in New York. It employs a chorus and narrator in the character of Alfieri. Eddie, the tragic protagonist, has an improper love for, and almost an obsession with, Catherine, his wife Beatrice&#x27;s orphaned niece, so he does not approve of her courtship of Beatrice&#x27;s cousin Rodolpho. Miller&#x27;s interest in writing about the world of the New York docks originated with an unproduced screenplay that he developed with Elia Kazan in the early 1950s (titled &quot;The Hook&quot;) that addressed corruption on the Brooklyn docks. Kazan later directed &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;, which dealt with the same subject.

==Synopsis==
The action is narrated by Alfieri, who was raised in 1900s Italy but is now working as an American lawyer, thereby representing the &quot;Bridge&quot; between the two cultures.

===Act 1===
In the opening speech, Alfieri describes the violent history of the small Brooklyn community of Red Hook and tells us that the second-generation Sicilians are now more civilized, more American, and are prepared to &quot;settle for half&quot; and let the law handle their disputes. But there are exceptions, and he then begins to narrate the story of Eddie Carbone, an Italian American longshoreman who lives with his wife Beatrice and her orphaned niece Catherine.

Eddie is a good man who, although ostensibly protective and fatherly towards Catherine, harbors a growing passion for her as she approaches her 18th birthday. We learn that he has not had sex with his wife for nearly three months. Catherine is studying to become a stenographer and Eddie objects to her taking a job she has been offered until she finishes her coursework, expressing a dislike for the way she dresses and the interest she is beginning to show in men. Beatrice is more supportive of Catherine&#x27;s ventures and persuades Eddie to let her take the job.

Eddie returns home one afternoon with the news that Beatrice&#x27;s two cousins, brothers Marco and Rodolpho, have safely arrived in New York as illegal immigrants. He has agreed to house them saying that he is honored to be able to help family. Marco is quiet and thoughtful, possessing remarkable strength, whereas Rodolpho is more unconventional, with plans to make a career singing in America. Marco has a family starving in Italy and plans to return after working illegally for several years, whereas Rodolpho intends to stay. Although Eddie, Beatrice, and Catherine are at first excellent hosts, cracks appear when Rodolpho and Catherine begin dating.

Eddie convinces himself that Rodolpho is homosexual and is only expressing interest in Catherine so he can marry her and gain status as a legal citizen. He confronts Catherine with his beliefs and she turns to Beatrice for advice. Beatrice, starting to realize Eddie&#x27;s true feelings, tells her that she should marry Rodolpho and move out. In the meantime, Eddie turns to Alfieri, hoping for help from the law. However, Alfieri tells him that the only recourse he has is to report Rodolpho and Marco as undocumented. Seeing no solution to his problem, Eddie becomes increasingly desperate and takes his anger out on Rodolpho and, in teaching him to box, &quot;accidentally&quot; injures him. Marco reacts by quietly threatening Eddie, showing his strength by holding a heavy chair above Eddie&#x27;s head with one hand and &quot;smiling with triumph&quot;.

===Act 2===
A few months have passed and Eddie reaches a breaking point when he discovers that Catherine and Rodolpho have slept together and are intent on marrying. Drunk, he kisses Catherine and then attempts to prove that Rodolpho is gay by suddenly and passionately kissing him. After a violent confrontation, Eddie orders Rodolpho to leave the apartment.

Eddie visits Alfieri and insists that the kiss has proved Rodolpho is gay and that he is only marrying Catherine for citizenship, but once again Alfieri says the law cannot help. Out of desperation, Eddie phones immigration services but in the meantime, Beatrice has arranged for Marco and Rodolpho to move in with two other undocumented immigrants in the flat above. Eddie learns that Catherine and Rodolpho have arranged to marry within a week and about the two new immigrants that have moved into the building and, with both anger and fright, frantically urges Catherine and Beatrice to move them out. When immigration officials arrive and arrest Marco, Rodolpho, and the two other immigrants, Eddie pretends that the arrest comes as a complete surprise to him, but Beatrice and Marco see through this. Marco spits in Eddie&#x27;s face in front of everyone and accuses Eddie of killing his starving children. Eddie tries to convince the neighborhood of his innocence but they turn away from him.

Alfieri visits Marco and Rodolpho in custody, obtaining their release on bail until their hearing comes up. Alfieri explains that Rodolpho will be able to stay once he has married Catherine but warns Marco that he will have to return to Italy. Vengeful, Marco confronts Eddie publicly on his release, and Eddie turns on him with a knife, demanding that he take back his accusations and restore his honor. In the ensuing scuffle, Eddie is stabbed with his own knife by Marco and dies, as his stunned family and neighbors stand around.

When he witnesses Eddie&#x27;s death, Alfieri trembles because he realizes that, even though it was wrong, something &quot;perversely pure&quot; calls to him and he is filled with admiration. But, he tells the audience, settling for half-measures is better, it must be, and so he mourns Eddie with a sense of alarm at his own feelings.

===Revivals in New York===
Dustin Hoffman acted as assistant director and stage manager for a successful 1965 production of the play Off-Broadway at the Sheridan Square Playhouse in New York City. The play&#x27;s director, Ulu Grosbard, suggested to Arthur Miller that Hoffman would one day make a great Willy Loman (a role that Hoffman would later play to great acclaim). Miller was unimpressed and later wrote &quot;My estimate of Grosbard all but collapsed as, observing Dustin Hoffman&#x27;s awkwardness and his big nose that never seemed to get unstuffy, I wondered how the poor fellow imagined himself a candidate for any kind of acting career.&quot;

Another production in New York opened on February 3, 1983, at the Ambassador Theatre, with Tony Lo Bianco as Eddie and directed by Arvin Brown. It ran for 149 performances.

An award-winning production in New York opened on December 14, 1997, at the Criterion Center Stage Right and subsequently transferred to the Neil Simon Theatre. It ran for 239 performances.

===Revivals in London===
The National Theatre of Great Britain staged a production in 1987 at the Cottesloe Theatre. It was directed by Alan Ayckbourn and Michael Gambon gave an acclaimed performance as Eddie. &quot;Time Out&quot; called the production &quot;near perfect&quot; and the &quot;New Statesman&quot; called it &quot;one of the finest events to be presented at the National Theatre since it moved to the South Bank.&quot;

==Adaptations==

===Film===
Italian film director Luchino Visconti directed a stage version of the play in Italy in 1958. The plot of his film &quot;Rocco and His Brothers&quot; (&quot;Rocco e i suoi fratelli&quot;), made in 1960, has many affinities with &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot;.

A French-Italian film &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot; was released in February 1962. Directed by Sidney Lumet, the film starred Raf Vallone and Maureen Stapleton as Eddie and Beatrice, with Carol Lawrence as Catherine. The film was the first time that a kiss between men was shown on screen in America, albeit in this case it is intended as an accusation of being gay, rather than a romantic expression. In a major change to the plot of the play, Eddie commits suicide after being publicly beaten by Marco.

===Television===
On 4 April 1966, ITV aired &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot; as its ITV Play of the Week, of which no copies survive. Vallone also played Eddie in this version.

In 1986, the BBC aired a TV dramatisation of the play produced by Geoff Wilson.

===Opera===
Renzo Rossellini, the brother of film director Roberto Rossellini, was the first to adapt the play into an opera with his &quot;Uno sguardo dal ponte&quot;, which premiered at the Teatro dell&#x27;Opera di Roma in 1961.

In 1999, another operatic version, with music by William Bolcom and a libretto by Arthur Miller, premiered at Lyric Opera of Chicago starring Kim Josephson as Eddie Carbone. The work was performed subsequently at the Metropolitan Opera in 2002, again at the Washington National Opera in 2007, and by Vertical Player Repertory Opera in 2009, starring William Browning as Eddie. The opera was first performed in Europe at Theater Hagen in 2003 in German translation. The first English (original) language version produced in Europe opened at the Teatro dell&#x27;Opera di Roma in Rome on January 18, 2011.

===Radio===
L.A. Theatre Works released a radio adaptation of the play in 1998 featuring Ed O&#x27;Neill.

BBC Radio 3 produced a radio adaptation starring Alfred Molina, which was first broadcast on October 18, 2015, and then again on May 14, 2017. For his work on the production, Molina was awarded the BBC Audio Drama Award for Best Actor.
