<text>A limited-access road, known by various terms worldwide, including limited-access highway, dual-carriageway, expressway, and partial controlled-access highway, is a highway or arterial road for high-speed traffic which has many or most characteristics of a controlled-access highway (also known as a &quot;freeway&quot; or &quot;motorway&quot;), including limited or no access to adjacent property, some degree of separation of opposing traffic flow, use of grade separated interchanges to some extent, prohibition of slow modes of transport, such as bicycles, horse-drawn vehicles or ridden horses, or self-propelled agricultural machines; and very few or no intersecting cross-streets or level crossings. The degree of isolation from local traffic allowed varies between countries and regions. The precise definition of these terms varies by jurisdiction.

== History ==
The first implementation of limited-access roadways in the United States was the Bronx River Parkway in New York, in 1907. The New York State Parkway System was constructed as a network of high-speed roads in and around New York City. The first limited access highway built is thought to be the privately built Long Island Motor Parkway in Long Island, New York. The Southern State Parkway opened in 1927, while the Long Island Motor Parkway was closed in 1937 and replaced by the Northern State Parkway (opened in 1931) and the contiguous Grand Central Parkway (opened in 1936).

== Regional implementations ==
In the United States, the national &quot;Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot; (MUTCD) uses &quot;full control of access&quot; only for freeways. Expressways are defined as having &quot;partial control of access&quot; (or &quot;semi-controlled access&quot;). This means that major roads typically use interchanges and commercial development is accessed via cross roads or frontage roads, while minor roads can cross at grade and farms can have direct access, some may be two lanes.This definition is also used by some states, some of which also restrict freeways only to motor vehicles capable of maintaining a certain speed. Some other states use &quot;controlled access&quot; to mean a higher standard than &quot;limited access&quot;, while others reverse the two terms.

=== Oceania ===

==== Australia ====
While Australia&#x27;s larger capital cities feature controlled-access highway networks, the smaller metropolitan areas mostly rely on limited-access highways for high-speed local traffic.

In South Australia the terms &quot;expressway&quot; and &quot;freeway&quot; can be synonymous. The Southern and Northern Expressways are both controlled-access highways. However, perhaps confusingly, the Port River Expressway is a limited-access highway.

Dual carriageways that connect capital cities and regional centres, such as the M31 Hume Highway between Sydney and Melbourne, are almost all limited-access highways. In spite of this, &#x27;freeway&#x27; terminology is used on signage for most regional limited access highways in the state of Victoria.

==== New Zealand: &quot;Expressway, Motorway&quot; ====

The terms &quot;Motorway&quot; and &quot;Expressway&quot; in New Zealand both encompass multi-lane divided freeways as well as narrower 2 to 4-lane undivided expressways with varying degrees of grade separation; the difference being that in New Zealand a &quot;Motorway&quot; has certain additional legal traffic restrictions.
=== Asia ===

==== China ====
The Expressway Network of the People&#x27;s Republic of China is the longest highway system in the world. The network is also known as National Trunk Highway System (NTHS). By the end of 2016, the total length of China&#x27;s expressway network reached 131,000 kilometers (82,000 mi).

Expressways in China are a fairly recent addition to a complex network of roads. China&#x27;s first expressway was built in 1988. Until 1993, very few expressways existed. The network is expanding rapidly after 2000. In 2011, 11,000 kilometres (6,800 mi) of expressways were added to the network.

====Pakistan====
The Expressways of Pakistan are a network of multiple-lane, high-speed highways in Pakistan, which are owned, maintained and operated federally by Pakistan&#x27;s National Highway Authority. They are one class lower than the country&#x27;s motorways and are usually upgraded versions of the national highways. The total length of Pakistan&#x27;s expressways is as of November, 2016. Around of expressways are currently under construction in different parts of country. Most of these expressways will be complete between 2017 and 2020.

==== India ====
Expressways in India make up more than of the Indian National Highway System on which they are the highest class of road. The National Highways Development Project is underway to add an additional of expressways to the network by the year 2023.

==== Iran ====
&quot;Expressways&quot; in Iran are one class lower than &quot;freeways&quot; and are used in large urban areas such as Isfahan, Mashhad, or Tehran and between other important cities (Usually two province capitals) in rural and desert areas. The speed limit in Urban areas is between and in rural and desert areas between .

==== Japan ====
The term &quot;Expressway&quot; as used in English in Japan refers to both freeway-style highways and narrower, more winding, often undivided &quot;Regional High-Standard Highways&quot; . Both types of expressways have a combined length of as of April 2012.

====Malaysia====
Limited-access roads in Malaysia usually, but not always, take the name ( – this is also the name for expressways). Highways normally have a lower speed limit than expressways (but still higher than the rest of the local road network), and permit at-grade intersections and junctions to residential roads and shopfronts, although grade separation is still typical. Highways are normally toll-free and are owned and operated by the federal government. Notable examples of limited-access roads are the Federal Highway, Skudai Highway, Gelugor Highway, Kuantan Bypass and Kuching Bypass.

====Singapore====

Limited-access roads in Singapore are formally known as (in contrast to controlled-access highways which are known as &quot;expressways&quot;). While still functioning as high-speed roads, semi-expressways may still have at-grade intersections with traffic lights, and speed limits are not uniform. Grade separation is, however, still typical at major junctions. Five roads have been designated as semi-expressways: Bukit Timah Road, Jurong Island Highway, Nicoll Highway, Outer Ring Road System and West Coast Highway.

==== South Korea ====
Motorways in South Korea (자동차 전용 도로, &quot;jadongcha jeonyong doro&quot;, literally &#x27;motor vehicle-only road&#x27;) include various grades of highways other than expressways. Contrary to the expressway in South Korea, the status of motorway is a measure of traffic control rather than a class of road. For example, &quot;Jayu-ro&quot; is a segment of national route 77 as well as a motorway. As of June 2011, 1,610 km of highways in total were designated as motorways. (1,052 km national highways, 351 km metropolitan highways, 185 km regional highways and 20 km municipal highways)

Like on expressways, motorcycles are not permitted.

====Sri Lanka====

Sri Lanka has ensured to classify the expressways in reference to the connotation of E grades. , three expressways namely the Southern Expressway, Outer Circular Expressway and the Colombo – Katunayake Expressway have been created. A tax levying structure is proposed for travelling via the expressways. Speed limits in the range of 80–100 km/h is attested for travelling through the expressways. Up to now two expressways namely the Northern Expressway and the Ruwanpura Expressway are in process to satisfy the needs of public transport.
==== Taiwan (R.O.C.) ====

Expressways in Taiwan may be controlled-access highways similar to National Freeways or limited-access roads. Most have Provincial (as opposed to National) Highway status, although some are built and maintained by cities. All provincial expressways run east–west except for Provincial Highway No. 61, which runs north–south along the west coast. Some provincial expressway routes are still under construction.

=== Europe ===
==== Austria: &quot;Schnellstraße&quot; ====

In Austria the speed limit on a &quot;Schnellstraße&quot; is . &quot;Schnellstraßen&quot; are very similar to Austrian &quot;Autobahnen&quot; (freeways/motorways); the chief difference is that they are more cheaply built with smaller curve radius, often undivided and have fewer bridges and tunnels.
==== Belgium: &quot;Autoweg&quot; ====
In Belgium an &quot;autoweg&quot; is a public road, the beginning of which is indicated by the first signboard (F9) and the end by the second sign (F11).

An important difference with an &quot;autosnelweg&quot; is that crossroads as well as traffic lights can be on an &quot;autoweg&quot;.

In Belgium there is no specific speed regulation for an &quot;autoweg&quot;.

Only motor vehicles and their trailers (with the exception of mopeds), agricultural vehicles and the towing of fairground vehicles, as well as four-wheelers (without passenger compartment), are allowed to drive on an &quot;autoweg&quot;.

An &quot;autoweg&quot; can consist of two or more lanes. The driving directions can be separated by a roadmarking, or by a central reservation. If a public road (&quot;autosnelweg&quot;, &quot;autoweg&quot;, &quot;weg&quot;) consists of two or more lanes that are clearly separated from each other by a roadside or a space that is not accessible to vehicles, the drivers may not drive on the lane opposite to them.

==== Bosnia and Herzegovina: &quot;Brza cesta/Brzi put&quot; ====

==== Croatia: &quot;Brza cesta&quot; ====


In Croatia, the term &quot;brza cesta&quot; (lit. &quot;fast road&quot;) is used to describe a motor vehicle-only road, usually grade-separated, without an emergency lane, with a speed limit of , although it can be lowered, usually to . They range from 2+2 lane dual carriageways with grade-separated intersections and speed limit (D2 in Osijek), four or six-lane urban streets with at-grade intersections with traffic lights (D1 in Karlovac) or two-lane single carriageways with grade-separated intersections (D33 in Šibenik). They are either a standalone state road (D10) or a part of one (Southern Osijek bypass, D2). Some portions of motorways are expressways since they are either in construction (A8 between Pazin and Matulji) or designed as such (A7 in Rijeka). As a rule, the expressways are not tolled, however major tunnels on expressways are tolled.
==== Czech Republic: &quot;Rychlostní silnice&quot; ====


Expressways in the Czech Republic (, are defined as dual carriageways with smaller emergency lane. The speed limit is 110 km/h (70 mph). Expressway road signs are white on blue.
==== Denmark: &quot;Motortrafikvej&quot;====
In Denmark, a &#x27;motortrafikvej&#x27; (Danish for &quot;motor traffic road&quot;) is a high-speed highway with a speed limit between . The most common &#x27;motortrafikvej&#x27; has two lanes (1+1) or 2+1. There is no grade intersections. The signs for &#x27;motortrafikvej&#x27; have white text on blue background.
==== Finland: &quot;Moottoriliikennetie&quot; ====

In Finland, highways are separated into three categories: all-access &quot;valtatie&quot; (&quot;main road&quot;), limited-access &quot;moottoriliikennetie&quot; (&quot;motor traffic road&quot;) and finally &quot;moottoritie&quot; (&quot;motorway&quot;); the latter two are marked with green signage, while &quot;valtatie&quot; signage is blue. While most of the network is all-access road, of it is motorway, and is limited-access road. The access is limited to motor vehicles faster than 50 km/h, thus excluding pedestrian, bicycle, moped or tractor traffic; furthermore, towing is not allowed. Limited-access roads are generally similar to motorways, but do not fulfill all the technical requirements, such as several lanes in one direction or separation of opposite directions. Limited-access roads are usually built because the local population density is too low to justify a motorway. Often space has been left during construction for an eventual upgrade to a motorway. Limited-access roads also function as feeder routes for motorways. The general speed limit on main roads and limited-access roads is 100 km/h (summertime) and 80 km/h (wintertime). On motorways the speed limits are 120 and 100 km/h respectively. Especially during winter the speed limits can be changed due to weather conditions.
==== Germany: &quot;Kraftfahrstraße&quot; ====

A &quot;Kraftfahrstrasse&quot; (German for &quot;motor-power road&quot;, also colloquially called &quot;Schnellstraße&quot;, literally &quot;fast road&quot;) in Germany is any road with access limited to motor vehicles with a maximum design speed of more than , excluding pedestrian, bicycle, moped or tractor traffic. Oversized vehicles are banned.

The construction of transregional &quot;Kraftfahrstraßen&quot; highways (&quot;Autostraßen&quot;) rank below the standard of German autobahns. With regard to the general German speed limits, on roads with lanes separated by a median or with a minimum of two marked lanes per direction, an advisory speed limit (&quot;Richtgeschwindigkeit&quot;) of applies. At-grade intersections are admissible, regulation at junctions is usually provided by traffic lights or roundabouts. U-turns and any deliberate stopping are prohibited. &quot;Kraftfahrstraßen&quot; are out of bounds to pedestrians, except for special crosswalks.
==== Hungary: &quot;Autóút&quot; ====

Expressways in Hungary are called &quot;Autóút&quot; (Auto/car road). They are mostly dual carriageways.
The main difference between Hungarian motorways and expressways is, that they are more cheaply built with narrower width and often undivided. 
Maximum speed limit is reduced to 110 km/h for vehicles under 3.5 tons, and 70 km/h for vehicles over 3.5 tons.

In Hungary there are multiple types of dual carriageways. One part is almost identical with motorways, but the driving lanes are narrower.

Parameters of a 2+2 lane dual carriageway off-habitat area:
* Total width of road: 25.60 m
* Driving lane width: 3.50 m
* Pavement width: 2x10.25 m
* Parking lane: 3.00 m
* Middle separation area width: 3.60 m
Parameters of a 2+2 lane dual carriageway in habitat (town/city) area:
* Total width of road: 24.10 m
* Driving lane width: 3.50 m
* Pavement width: 2x10.75 m
* Parking lane: 3.00 m
* Middle separation area width: 3.60 m

There are also semi-motorways with only one side of the motorway built.
After the missing lanes are built, they will become standard motorways.

==== Ireland: &quot;HQDC&quot; ====
A &quot;High-quality dual carriageway (HQDC)&quot; in Ireland is normally completed to a motorway standard, including no right-turns, but with no motorway restrictions. These are common on the final stretches of motorways nearing a major city, generally in order to enable use of bus stops and city bus services on the particular stretch of road.

Speed limits are normally 100 km/h compared to 120 km/h on motorways
====Italy: &quot;Superstrada&quot;====

In Italy there are:
Type B highway (or &quot;strada extraurbana principale&quot;), commonly but unofficially known as &quot;superstrada&quot;, is a divided highway with at least two lanes for each direction, paved shoulder on the right, no cross-traffic and no at-grade intersections. Access restrictions on such highways are exactly the same of Italian motorways (&quot;autostrade&quot;), as well as signage at the beginning and the end of the highway (with the only difference being the background color, blue instead of green). Speed limit on type-B road is .
Type C highway (or &quot;strada extraurbana secondaria&quot;), a single carriageway with at least one lane for each direction and shoulders. It may have at-grade, at-level crossings with railways, roundabouts and traffic lights. This category contains also dual carriageways that can not be classified as type-B highways because of the lack of one or more required features. In absence of specific regulation signs, a type-C road is accessible by all vehicles and pedestrians, even if it has separate carriageways and no cross-traffic.

The sign shown here on the left allows access only to motorized vehicles. Speed limit on type-C roads is .
==== Netherlands: &quot;Autoweg&quot; ====

The Netherlands has much more kilometres of motorways (&quot;snelwegen&quot;), than expressways (&quot;autowegen&quot;). The latter only form a complementary part of the country&#x27;s main highway network. They are typically shorter than motorways, offering connections of a more regional significance. The general speed limit is 100 km/h. Only faster motor vehicles, both &quot;capable&quot; and &quot;legally allowed&quot; to go at least 50 km/h, may use the road. &quot;Autowegen&quot; are always numbered and mostly signposted with an N (for Non motorway highway) and up to three digits, like . For the most part they fall under national or provincial management.

Dutch expressways are built to significantly varying standards. Designs range from fully controlled-access dual carriageways with grade separation, center dividers and full hard shoulders, to single carriageways with just one lane per direction and only intermittent shoulder patches called &quot;Vluchthavens&quot; (small Lay-bys). Intersections are frequently at grade with traffic lights, or they are roundabouts. There can be moveable bridges in these roads. In either case, the speed limit is frequently reduced to 70 km/h before reaching the junction or the bridge.

Since 1997 a national traffic safety program called &quot;Sustainable Safety&quot; has introduced a new road categorisation and new design standards. Although &quot;autowegen&quot; don&#x27;t have to conform completely to the new Dutch design standard for regional flow roads (&quot;stroomwegen&quot;), many of these roads require at least some upgrades. The ideal is to make expressways divided and grade-separated, as much as possible. Otherwise these roads are downgraded to the safety category of distributor roads, thereby losing their expressway status.


==== Norway: &quot;Motortrafikkvei&quot; ====
In Norway, a &quot;motortrafikkvei&quot; (Norwegian for &quot;motor traffic road&quot;), formerly called &quot;motorvei klasse B&quot; (&quot;class-B motorway&quot;) is a high-speed highway with a speed limit of up to 90 km/h. There are no at grade intersections. Direction signs for &quot;motortrafikkvei&quot; have black text on yellow background, while same signs on &quot;motorvei&quot; have white text on blue background. As of October 2017 the Norwegian Road DataBase show approximately 455 km of &quot;motortrafikkvei&quot; in Norway.
==== Poland: &quot;droga ekspresowa&quot; ====


 (plural: ) refers to a type of road in the Polish highway network, with slightly lower technical parameters than the (motorway), and serving major international and inter-regional purposes. They are often built as ring roads since they take less space than motorway and allow more entrances and exits. All expressways start with the letter S followed by a number, and are signposted with the &quot;D-7&quot; traffic sign. They can be dual or single carriageways, but as of May 2024, only out of of Polish expressways are single-carriageway. They are also allowed to have at-grade intersections in exceptional cases, however, since 2020 all expressway junctions are grade separated. The speed limit is 120 km/h (dual carriageway) and 100 km/h (single carriageway).

As of May 2004 the Polish government documents indicated that the country had plans of an expressway and motorway network totalling (including about of motorways).

Those limited-access roads, which are not part of the Polish national highway network, are signposted with a separate &quot;B-6/8/9&quot; prohibitory sign, which bans all traffic not allowed on highways.
==== Portugal: &quot;via rápida&quot; ====


In Portugal, a non-motorway limited access road is commonly referred as a &quot;via rápida&quot; (rapid way, plural: &quot;vias rápidas&quot;), although there is not a specific official technical designation for it.

The legal term &quot;via reservada a automóveis e motociclos&quot; (reserved way for automobiles and motorcycles) is used to designate a non-motorway road where motorway rules apply (except the speed limit which is lower). However, this term refers only to the road rules and not to the road technical characteristics.

There are two main types of roads commonly referred as &quot;vias rápidas&quot; in Portugal. The first type is a limited access road, with dual carriageway and with interchanges grade separation. Many of these roads have all or almost all the technical characteristics of full motorways. Examples are the several urban highways in cities like Lisbon, Oporto, Coimbra and Braga. In Madeira, the main regional highways, that connect the cities and other important places of the island, are mainly of these type, there are two vias rápidas classified as motorways in the region, VR1 and VR2.
The second Portuguese type of &quot;via rápida&quot; is a highway with all the same characteristics of the above first type, except the number of carriageways that is only one. Examples of this type of roads are the ancient IP4 and IP5 (before being transformed in full motorways), the Portalegre-Beja section of the IP2, the Coimbra-Viseu section of the IP3 and several complementary routes (IC).
The dual carriageway &quot;vias rápidas&quot; can be classified and signalized as reserved ways for automobiles and motorcycles, cases in which general motorway rules apply, except speed limited which is never above 100 km/h. In dual carriageway &quot;vias rápidas&quot; not signalized as reserved ways, normal road rules apply, including speed limit which is never above 90 km/h. Single carriageway &quot;vias rápidas&quot; cannot be classified and signalized as reserved ways and so normal road rules always apply there.
==== Romania ====
In Romania, such roads are called &quot;drumuri expres&quot; (or &quot;drum expres&quot; in singular form). Whilst there is only one expressway in Romania so far, their main difference from regular motorways are the lack of hard shoulders and a slightly lower speed limit of 120 km/h, otherwise, being similar to a motorway regarding grade separation and featuring at least 2 lanes per direction.

Expressways were introduced for the first time on the 2014 roads masterplan. This masterplan envisaged building most planned motorways up to expressway standards, provided that in the future they would be converted to actual motorways. However, by mid-2019, no expressway has been built, nevermind starting works on one, although contracts were signed to allow for their construction, meaning that in the 2020s more expressways will likely be completed.

Planned expressways according to CNADNR (Romanian National Company of Motorways and National Roads), based on the 2014 roads masterplan:

==== Russia ====

Russia has a large federal highway network that totals approximately . Federal highways in the country are classified into two categories: &quot;motorways&quot; (, not the same as the English term motorway) and &quot;other&quot;. 
In the Road Rules, there are 2 designations for a limited-access road, one being &quot;motorway&quot; and the other being &quot;road for cars&quot;(), on both of which special motorway rules apply.
&quot;Roads for cars&quot; are different from motorways by the fact that they don&#x27;t have to be dual-carriageway, at-grade traffic light intersections are permitted, and the speed limit is still 90 km/h.
==== Spain: &quot;Autovía&quot; ====

Unlike Spain&#x27;s &quot;Autopistas&quot;, specifically reserved for vehicles able to sustain at least 60 km/h (37 mph), and usually tolled, Autovías are usually upgrades from older roads, and never toll roads. In general, slow vehicles like bicycles and agricultural machinery are allowed under certain restrictions.

====Slovakia: Rýchlostná cesta====

A &quot;rýchlostná cesta&quot; in Slovakia, sometimes referred to as cesta pre motorove vozidla, is different from a &quot;diaľnica&quot;, with speed limits restricted to for cars and for trucks. Rýchlostné cesty (&quot;cesty&quot; is the plural form of &quot;cesta&quot;) used to be designated by the letter &#x27;R&#x27; preceding the road number, however, new road rules introduced in 2020 established that all expressways noted by the letter &#x27;R&#x27; were to be considered motorways. A rýchlostná cesta has two lanes on each side and, occasionally, may take the form of a single carriageway, like in Poland.

==== Sweden ====

The Swedish road type motortrafikled is a road with limited access (all grade-separated, no slow traffic) and two or three lanes. According to the EU&#x27;s multilingual term base, &quot;motortrafikled&quot; should be translated to &quot;expressway&quot;, &quot;rapid road&quot; or &quot;road with limited access&quot;. The same rules apply to a &quot;motortrafikled&quot; as to a motorway - it is basically a half motorway. The speed limit is usually 90 – 100 km/h. Many &quot;motortrafikleder&quot; are built as 2+1 roads, alternating two lanes in one direction and one in the other, with a narrow fence in between.
==== Switzerland ====

In Switzerland &quot;Autostrasse&quot; (German, &quot;auto road&quot;), &quot;semi-autoroute&quot;, or &quot;semiautostrada&quot; (French and Italian for &quot;semi-freeway&quot;) is a highway that is only allowed to high-speed traffic with no crossings, but it is not the highest class road, the motorways (&quot;Autobahn&quot;/&quot;autoroute&quot;/&quot;autostrada&quot;). The speed limit on these roads in Switzerland is . Most of the &quot;Autostrasse / semi-autoroutes / semiautostrade&quot; have no central barrier separating the lanes in different directions.
==== United Kingdom ====


In the United Kingdom, the second tier of high speed roads below motorways are typically dual carriageways (although the term &quot;dual carriageway&quot; can refer to roads that are not limited-access, so long as traffic in opposite directions is physically separated). Many roads such as the A1, the A14, the A19 and the A42 are built to a high quality, in many places they are only intersected by grade-separated junctions, have full barriers at both the road side and the central reservations and in some cases three or more lanes of traffic, however they are not subjected to motorway restrictions as they are typically built to a lower standard, or have existing rights of way for non motorised vehicles. They may lack some features that a motorway would have, such as hard shoulders, and may have tighter bends and steeper gradients than would be allowed on a motorway or have established rights of way that cannot be removed. The standard motorway speed limit for cars of also applies to many dual carriageways.

In March 2015, it was announced that a new standard would be developed to formally designate certain high-quality routes in England as &quot;Expressways&quot;. This new standard would have the same motorway regulations as traditional motorways, however would lack a hard shoulder and use traffic management systems like those on smart motorways. An &quot;expressway&quot; is limited to 3 through lanes, they are to be built largely to the same standards as a smart motorway, although some non-standard existing alignments are allowed to remain if they are just short of being standard.

Some roads have &quot;expressway&quot; in their name, this has no reflection on the purpose or standard of the road. For example, the Aston Expressway or the North Wales Expressway.

==== Canada ====

In Ontario, &quot;expressway&quot; is synonymous with &quot;freeway&quot; and is used to mean limited-access divided-highways with no at-grade intersections. An example of this is the Gardiner Expressway through western and downtown Toronto, and once it turns into a 6-lane arterial road (Lake Shore Boulevard) east of the Don River, there is a sign warning of the end of the freeway. The E. C. Row Expressway in Windsor, Ontario is a controlled-access divided freeway with grade-separated interchanges, between Ojibway Parkway at its western terminus and Banwell Road at its eastern terminus, where there are traffic intersections at both termini. The Macdonald–Cartier Freeway would be an example of a route that uses the term &quot;freeway&quot;, however, that name is being phased out by the Ministry of Transportation. In general, the term &quot;expressway&quot; is used more frequently for municipally maintained roads, while provincial freeways are known more by their route number (particularly the 400-series highways are known as Highway 4__) despite some of them having an &quot;expressway&quot; name for all or part of their length, such as the (Chedoke Expressway/Hamilton Expressway, Belfield Expressway, and Airport Expressway).

The Veterans Memorial Parkway in London, Ontario, has intersections instead of interchanges, and thus is considered an expressway and not a freeway. It was originally designed with sufficient right-of-way to be built as a full freeway, but a lack of funding forced it to be built with at-grade intersections. Similarly, the Hanlon Parkway in Guelph and Highway 40 in Sarnia, Ontario were originally opened with intersections in lieu of interchanges, save for the couple grade-separated interchanges. Regional Road 420 in Niagara Falls is also an expressway. While Allen Road and Highway 400 were originally full freeways, their extensions (for Allen Road to meet Sheppard Avenue and Dufferine Street, and the 400 South Extension which became Black Creek Drive and handed over to Metro Toronto upon completion) were built as expressways with at-grade intersections.

Two sections of Highway 11, between Barrie and Orillia as well as between Orillia and Gravenhurst, are a Right-in Right-out (RIRO) expressway rather than a full freeway. The joint route of Highway 35/115 in Durham Region is also a RIRO expressway.

In most of Western Canada, an expressway is a high-speed arterial road along the lines of the California definition, while a freeway is fully controlled access with no at-grade intersections. In Alberta, the term &quot;Trail&quot; refers to both full freeways (Stoney Trail), or high-speed arterials with a mix of signalized intersections and interchanges (Crowchild Trail). The Yellowhead Trail as it passes through Edmonton, Alberta has both intersections and interchanges. It is the main east–west artery for the northern half of the city. There are plans to upgrade many of the most congested remaining intersections into interchanges in the near future.

In Quebec, the term &quot;freeway&quot; is never used, with the terms &quot;expressway&quot; (in English) and &quot;autoroute&quot; (in English and French) being preferred. English terms are rare, and only found on bilingual signage of expressways (abbreviated &quot;expy&quot;) found in Montreal around bridges and on the Bonaventure Expressway; these signs are controlled by the federal government. Most of the Autoroutes are built or at least designed to be upgrade to a full freeway (initially constructed as a Two-lane expressway), a notable exception is the section of Autoroute 20 through Vaudreuil-Dorion and L&#x27;Île-Perrot which is an 8 km urban boulevard. 
==== United States ====
In the United States, an &quot;expressway&quot; is defined by the federal government&#x27;s Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices as a divided highway with partial control of access. In contrast, a &quot;freeway&quot; is defined as a divided highway with full control of access. The difference between &quot;partial&quot; and &quot;full&quot; access control is that expressways may have a limited number of driveways and at-grade intersections (thus making them a form of high-speed arterial road), while access to freeways is allowed only at grade-separated interchanges. Expressways under this definition do not conform to Interstate highway standards (which ban all driveways and at-grade intersections) and are therefore usually numbered as state highways or U.S. Highways.

This distinction was first developed in 1949 by the Special Committee on Nomenclature of what is now the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). In turn, the definitions were incorporated into AASHTO&#x27;s official standards book, the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, which would become the national standards book of the U.S. Department of Transportation under a 1966 federal statute. The same distinction has also been codified into the statutory law of eight states: California, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, and Wisconsin.

However, each state codified the federal distinction slightly differently. California expressways do not necessarily have to be divided, though they must have at least partial access control. For both terms to apply in Wisconsin, a divided highway must be at least four lanes wide. In Missouri, both terms apply only to divided highways at least 10 miles long that are not part of the Interstate Highway System. In North Dakota and Mississippi, an expressway may have &quot;full or partial&quot; access control and &quot;generally&quot; has grade separations at intersections; a freeway is then defined as an expressway with full access control. Ohio&#x27;s statute is similar, but instead of the vague word &quot;generally&quot;, it imposes a requirement that 50% of an expressway&#x27;s intersections must be grade-separated for the term to apply. Only Minnesota enacted the exact MUTCD definitions, in May 2008.

However, many states around the Great Lakes region and along the Eastern Seaboard have refused to conform their terminology to the federal definition. The following states officially prefer the term &quot;expressway&quot; instead of &quot;freeway&quot; to describe what are technically freeways in federal parlance: Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, and West Virginia. In those states, it is common to find Interstate highways that bear the name &quot;expressway&quot;. Ultimately, it is the federal definition that defines a road&#x27;s classification whether it is an expressway or freeway no matter the preferred term. No state, for instance, could have what is technically an expressway given Interstate status just because semantically they use the term interchangeably with freeway.

Most expressways under the federal definition have speed limits of 45-55 mph (70–90 km/h) in urban areas and 55-70 mph (90–110 km/h) in rural areas. Urban expressways are usually free of private driveways, but occasional exceptions include direct driveways to gas stations and shopping malls at major intersections (which would never be allowed on a true freeway).

The vast majority of expressways are built by state governments, or by private companies, which then operate them as toll roads pursuant to a license from the state government.

A famous example of a local government getting into the expressway business is Santa Clara County in California, which deliberately built its own expressway system in the 1960s to supplement the freeway system then planned by Caltrans. Although the county originally planned to upgrade the expressways into full-fledged freeways, such a project became politically infeasible after the rise of the tax revolt movement in the mid-1970s, which began with California Proposition 13 in 1978.

==== Brazil ====

In Brazil, an expressway is known as &quot;Via Expressa&quot; and its function is to connect the most important streets and avenues of certain cities with their adjacent highways. Because of this, some expressways are numbered (in the same way as highways). According to the &quot;Código Brasileiro de Trânsito&quot; (Brazilian Traffic Code), expressways are officially defined as &quot;Vias de Trânsito Rápido&quot; (Rapid Transit Routes) and are considered the most important urban roads, with standard speed limits of 80 km/h (unless specified). A few examples of expressways include Marginal Tietê and Marginal Pinheiros in São Paulo; Avenida Brasil, Red Line and Yellow Line in Rio de Janeiro; among others.

<text>Kaki Hunter (born Katherine Susan Hunter; November 6, 1955) is an American actress, architect, and writer, perhaps best known for her role in the trilogy of &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; films in the 1980s.

==Life and career==
Hunter was born in Silver Spring, Maryland. She received accolades for her second ever role, as one of the three sisters in the 1977 West German film &quot;&quot;. Her performance earned the gold award for Best Young Actress from Germany&#x27;s Deutscher Filmpreis, and the award for Best Actress at Spain&#x27;s San Sebastián International Film Festival.

Hunter starred as the female lead in &quot;Roadie&quot; (1980), followed by roles in &quot;Willie &amp; Phil&quot; (1980), &quot;Whose Life Is It Anyway?&quot; (1981) and &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot; (1984).

Hunter also appeared in guest roles on television, including the 1979 episode &quot;The Execution File&quot; of the television series &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, the 1982 episode &quot;Weekend&quot; on the anthology series &quot;American Playhouse&quot;, and the 1991 episode &quot;Writer Wrong&quot; of the series &quot;Tropical Heat&quot;, her last role before retiring from acting.

Hunter received her greatest attention for the role of Wendy Williams, the female lead among the group of high schoolers in the 1981 hit film &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot;, returning to the role in &quot;Porky&#x27;s II: The Next Day&quot; (1983) and &quot;Porky&#x27;s Revenge!&quot; (1985).

After she retired from acting, Hunter became a teacher of white water rafting in Utah. She is the author of the how-to book &quot;Earthbag Building&quot;.

She was also active in the community theater in Moab, Utah.

<text>Théah is the fictional world created for the 7th Sea tabletop roleplaying game and collectible card game, created by John Wick and Jennifer Wick. It is based on an alternate version of early modern Europe with nations matching different periods and legends. There is also an undercurrent of secret societies based on real world and fictional sources. The 7th Sea role-playing game is centered on the swashbuckling genre.

== Nations of Théah ==
; Avalon : The England of Théah is based equally on Elizabethan England and the Arthurian legends. Queen Elaine rules the Three Kingdoms (Avalon, Innismore, and the Highland Marches) from the mystical city of Carleon using the symbol of the Graal to represent her unified rule.
; Castille : The Spain of Théah is the stronghold of the Vaticine church (more Gnostic than Catholic) where the masked El Vago fights the injustice of the Inquisition.
; Eisen : The Seven Kingdoms of Théah&#x27;s equivalent to the various nation-states that would become Germany were once united into a Holy Roman Empire but now lie war-torn and divided after a religious-based civil war equivalent to the Thirty Years&#x27; War.
; Montaigne : The France of Théah was home to the decadent empire of the glorious Sun King Leon Alexandre du Montaigne but now having gone through the throes of a bloody French Revolution is the first republic in Théah.
; Ussura : The icy parable of Russia lies on the brink of modernisation and the transition from the iron grip of the Gaius (like Ivan the Terrible) to the reformation of Catherine the Great.
; Vendel : The Dutch and Scandinavian cultures are in schism between the merchant Guilds and the ancient warrior traditions of the Vestenmannavnjar (Vikings).
; Vodacce : The Italian city-states are represented by the fracture and fractious islands of the scheming Merchant Princes all following the tenets of The Great Game.
; Cathay : Théah&#x27;s parallel to China and the Orient is separated from the rest of the world by the mysterious Wall of Fire.
; Crescent Empire : Sand, scimitars and other archetypal Middle Eastern fare.

== Secret societies ==
; The Knights of the Rose &amp; Cross : A mixture of the Knights Templar with the Rosicrucians and a touch of the Masons, they try to inspire the populace with their heroic deeds.
; Die Kreuzritter : The Black Crosses are the successors to the Teutonic Knights who fought in the Crusades and now fight a shadowy war against an alien threat.
; Explorer&#x27;s Society : The archaeologists and explorers of Théah are for any budding &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; as they explore the ancient Syrneth cultures that predate mankind.
; Invisible College : Based on the real-world association of scholars that became the Royal Society, they work in secret due to the rise of the Inquisition.
; Los Vagos : The followers of El Vago (Zorro) help to uphold justice and freedom in Castille under the persecution of the Inquisition
; The Rilasciare : Seen as small collections of anarchists and troublemakers, the group is far older and more organised than anyone realises.
; Sophia&#x27;s Daughters : Descendants of an ancient Sidhe bloodline, the group are secret guardians of Théah with powers of foresight and manipulation.
; Novus Ordum Mundi : The evil overlord club is a collection of some of the most villainous members of Théan society who have schemed and manipulated for many centuries.
; The Rye Grin : A new organization founded during the Montaigne Revolution trying to save innocents from the guillotine.

<text>In space systems a tell-tale is a single-bit status indicator that is included in telemetry or is used within the spacecraft&#x27;s on-board software to signal conditions that must be tracked or acted upon, especially when the status changes. A tell-tale may continually change as the status it is tracking changes, or, it may change once upon change of status and then remain at that value until deliberately cleared. The latter type of tell-tale is known as a &quot;sticky-bit&quot; because its value &quot;sticks&quot;, that is, remains constant, once it has been set.

The Phoenix spacecraft contains another type of tell-tale, developed by the University of Aarhus in Denmark, as part of its &quot;Meteorological Station&quot;. It is a small tube that is deflected by the martian wind, similar to a sailing tell-tale. The science payload&#x27;s stereo camera recorded images of its motion to be used to determine wind direction and speed.

<doc id="1300057" wikidata="Q47282" url="?curid=1300057" title="Osh">
<text>Osh (, , ) is the second-largest city in Kyrgyzstan, located in the Fergana Valley in the south of the country. It is often referred to as the &quot;capital of the south&quot;. It is the oldest city in the country (estimated by UNESCO to be more than 3,000 years old) and has served as the administrative center of Osh Region since 1939. The city has an ethnically mixed population of 322,164 , comprising Kyrgyz, Uzbeks, Ukrainians, Koreans, and other smaller ethnic groups.

==Overview==
Osh has an important outdoor activity bazaar which has been taking place on the same spot for the past 2,000 years and was a major market along the Silk Road. The city&#x27;s industrial base, established during the Soviet period, largely collapsed after the break-up of the Soviet Union and has only recently started to revive.

The proximity of the Uzbekistan border, which cuts through historically linked territories and settlements, deprives Osh of much of its former hinterland and presents a serious obstacle to trade and economic development. Daily flights from Osh Airport link Osh—and hence the southern part of Kyrgyzstan—to the national capital Bishkek and some international destinations, mainly in Russia. Osh has two railway stations and a railway connection to Andijan in neighbouring Uzbekistan, but no passenger traffic and only sporadic freight traffic. Most transport is by road. The recent upgrading of the long and arduous road through the mountains to Bishkek has greatly improved communications.

The city has several monuments, including one to the southern Kyrgyz leader () Kurmanjan and one of the few remaining statues of Lenin. A Russian Orthodox church, reopened after the demise of the Soviet Union, the second-largest mosque in the country, built in 2012 and situated beside the bazaar, and the 16th-century Rabat Abdul Khan Mosque can be found here. The only World Heritage Site in Kyrgyzstan, the Sulayman Mountain, offers a splendid view of Osh and its environs.

This mountain is thought by some researchers and historians to be the famous landmark of antiquity known as the &quot;Stone Tower&quot;, which Claudius Ptolemy wrote about in his famous work &quot;Geography&quot;. It marked the midpoint on the ancient Silk Road, the overland trade route taken by caravans between Europe and Asia. The National Historical and Archaeological Museum Complex Sulayman is carved in the mountain, containing a collection of archaeological, geological, and historical finds and information about local flora and fauna.

Its first Western-style supermarket, &quot;Narodnyj&quot;, opened in March 2007.

Osh is home to Osh State University, one of the largest universities in Kyrgyzstan.

==Administration==
Osh city (Ош шаар, &quot;Osh shaar&quot;) covers and, like the capital city of Bishkek, is administered separately and not part of any region, although it is the seat of Osh Region. Besides the city proper, 11 villages are administered by the city: Almalyk, Arek, Gulbaar-Tölöykön, Japalak, Kengesh, Kerme-Too, Orke, Pyatiletka, Teeke and parts of Ozgur and Tölöykön.

==Population==
Osh is the second-largest city in Kyrgyzstan after the capital city of Bishkek. According to the population estimate of 2021, the city population amounted to 322,164, of which 33,315 resided in the 11 villages that the City of Osh administers. At the 2009 census, 47.9% of the population were Kyrgyz, 44.2% were Uzbeks, 2.5% Russians, 2.2% Turks, 1.1% Tatars and 2.1% other nationalities. The population of the built-up (or metro) area in the surrounding Kara-Suu District and in neighbouring Uzbekistan is estimated at 400,000 inhabitants.

==History==

===Early history===
The name of the city of Osh derives from the river Vakhsh, anthropomorphised there as a water goddess of the same name, who was worshipped (in tandem with Atar, sacred fire) in a Zoroastrian shrine or fire temple situated in the Eagle Cave in the ancient sacred mountain Sulaiman-Too. The river Vakhsh itself, known also as Surkhob or Kyzyl-Suu ( Turkic: “red water”) is a tributary of the Amu Darya, the course of the Vakhsh lying outside and to the South of the Fergana valley, rising as it does on the west side of the 3,536m Taunmurun pass (east of the village of Sary-Tash) and flowing southwest to its confluence with the Panj at Takht-i Sangin to form the Amu Darya.
Oxus, the ancient name of the Amu Darya, like Osh, is cognate with the river name Vakhsh, revealing that the present day Vakhsh/Kyzyl-Suu was conceived to form the upper reaches of the river now known as the Amu Darya.

The city is among the oldest settlements in Central Asia. Osh was known as early as the 8th century as a center for silk production along the Silk Road. The famous trading route crossed Alay Mountains to reach Kashgar to the east.

Babur, founder of the Mughal Empire and descendant of Tamerlane, was born in nearby Andijan, in the Fergana Valley, pondered his future on Sulayman Mountain and even constructed a mosque atop of the mountain. Babur somehow concludes that the confines of the Fergana would cramp his aspirations as a descendant of famous conquering warrior princes. He wrote of the city:

 &quot;There are many sayings about the excellence of Osh. On the southeastern side of the Osh fortress is a well-proportioned mountain called Bara-Koh, where, on its summit, Sultan Mahmud Khan built a pavilion. Farther down, on a spur of the same mountain, I had a porticoed pavilion built in 902 (1496-7)&quot; 

===Imperial Russian and Soviet rule===
The city was occupied and annexed by the Russian Empire in 1876 when Russia overwhelmed the Central Asian khanates during the so-called &quot;Great Game&quot;, the contest between Britain and Russia for dominance in Central Asia. This conquest was achieved and the inclusion to the Russian Empire made by the mid-1880s, with main credit to General von Kaufman and General Mikhail Skobelev.

In the 1960s Osh and other towns in the south of the Kyrgyz SSR began to be industrialized. The population of Osh and other towns in the Fergana Valley that falls within Kyrgyzstan has traditionally consisted of a significant number of ethnic Uzbeks. When Osh started to industrialize the ethnic &quot;Kyrgyz were encouraged to move from the Kyrgyz populated countryside to the cities to work in industrial jobs and public administration.&quot; This contributed to the rise of social tension between the two groups.

===1990 riots===

In 1990, shortly before the end of Soviet power in Central Asia, Osh and its environs experienced bloody ethnic clashes between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks. There were about 1,200 casualties, including over 300 dead and 462 seriously injured. The riots broke out over the division of land resources in and around the city.

===2010 ethnic violence===

In 2010, after riots in Bishkek and other major Kyrgyz cities, President Kurmanbek Bakiyev took refuge in the city to hide from protesters denouncing his government and its response to the nation&#x27;s struggling economy. On May 13, 2010, Bakiyev supporters took over government buildings in Osh and seized the airport, preventing interim government officials from landing. The protesters demanded Bakiev&#x27;s return, and forced the regional governor to flee. The former Osh regional governor Mamasadyk Bakirov was reinstated.

On June 10, 2010, riots erupted in Osh, killing at least 81 and injuring hundreds of others. &quot;An explosion of violence, destruction and looting in southern Kyrgyzstan on 11–14 June 2010 killed many dozens of Kyrgyz and Uzbek people. The total of over 2000 buildings were destroyed, mostly homes, and deepened the divide between the country&#x27;s ethnic Kyrgyz and Uzbeks.&quot;

Local media reported that gangs of young men armed with sticks and stones smashed shop windows and set cars aflame in the city center. Several buildings and homes across the city were also set on fire. The city&#x27;s police force proved incapable of restoring order resulting in a state of emergency being declared and the army being mobilised.

The Kyrgyz intelligence agency claimed that the just-deposed president initiated the 2010 violence, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, who is said to have made a deal with foreign narco-jihadist gangs to take over southern Kyrgyzstan and initiate a shariah state in exchange for the Bakiyev family&#x27;s being returned to controlling Bishkek. However, to the day no serious proof has been presented to the public and media. According to various sources, up to 100,000 ethnic Uzbek refugees fled to Uzbekistan. Many refugee camps have been organized in the Andijan, Fergana and Namangan regions of Uzbekistan for Uzbek citizens of Kyrgyzstan who cross the border seeking safety.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Osh features a continental climate (Dsa), with hot, dry summers and cold winters. Osh receives on average roughly 400 millimeters of precipitation annually, the bulk of which typically falls on the city outside the summer months. Summers are hot in Osh, with average high temperatures routinely exceeding 30 °C. Winters are cold with average temperatures below freezing during a good portion of the season. Spring and autumn are transitional seasons, with temperatures rising during the course of the spring season and falling during the course of the autumn.

<text>The prefix thio-, when applied to a chemical, such as an ion, means that an oxygen atom in the compound has been replaced by a sulfur atom. This term is often used in organic chemistry. For example, from the word &quot;ether,&quot; referring to an oxygen-containing compound having the general chemical structure , where R and R′ are organic functional groups and O is an oxygen atom, comes the word &quot;thioether&quot;, which refers to an analogous compound with the general structure , where S is a sulfur atom covalently bonded to two organic groups. A chemical reaction involving the replacement of oxygen to sulfur is called thionation or thiation.

Thio- can be prefixed with &quot;di-&quot; and &quot;tri-&quot; in chemical nomenclature.

The word derives (which occurs in Greek epic poetry as and may come from the same root as Latin (Indo-European &quot;dh-w&quot;) and may have originally meant &quot;fumigation substance&quot;.)

<text>The first USS &quot;Prometheus&quot; was a brig in the United States Navy from 1814 to 1818.

&quot;Prometheus&quot; was built by William Seguin, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; purchased in 1814 by the Navy from Messrs. Savage and Dryan, the original owners, as the brig &quot;Escape&quot;; commissioned and renamed &quot;Prometheus&quot;, she was fitted out at Philadelphia by Master Commandant Joseph J. Nicholson.

In March–May 1815 she made a cruise to the West Indies to carry U.S. Senators Eligius Fromentin and James Brown to Havana. She sailed for Europe on 14 August 1816 to take Edward Coles, special messenger from the President of the United States to the Emperor Alexander I of Russia, returning to Boston, Massachusetts, on 25 November. In 1817 she was employed in surveying the U.S. coast north of Newport, Rhode Island, and in 1818 she operated along the southern coast and at New Orleans, Louisiana.

In October 1818 she was pronounced unseaworthy and decommissioned. &quot;Prometheus&quot; was dismantled and sold at auction at New Orleans in 1819.

<text>The United Nations Standard Products and Services Code (UNSPSC) is a taxonomy of products and services for use in eCommerce. It is a four-level hierarchy coded as an eight-digit number, with an optional fifth level adding two more digits.

The latest release (August 14, 2023) of the code set is 26.0801.

The third newest UNv24.0301 release contains 740 changes to the previous UNSPSC version UNv23.0701 which are 721 new items added, 12 existing items edited, 6 existing items moved, and 1 existing item deleted. The new UNv24.0301 release contains 157,116 total items.

The changes include a new Segment 57000000 -Humanitarian Relief Items, Kits, or Accessories, requested by United Nation Global Marketplace (UNGM); additional codes were added to support the United States Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Specialty Crops Inspection at the U.S. border.

The UNSPSC competes with a number of other product and commodity coding schemes, including the European Union&#x27;s Common Procurement Vocabulary, ECLASS, and GS1&#x27;s Global Product Classification.

== History ==
The UNSPSC was organized upon the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding signed on September 29, 1998, by John S. Svendsen, the director of the Inter-agency Procurement Services Office (IAPSO) of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and on November 1, 1998, by Lawrence M. Barth, a Vice President of the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corporation. The development of the first version was overseen by Peter R. Benson, who was also responsible for the design and development of the code management procedure as a modification of the Delphi statistical forecasting method. The process allowed for the rapid development of consensus without dominance or influence.

The ECCMA, a non-profit membership association, was formed in 1999 to manage and promote the UNSPSC until March 2003, with the release of version 6.0315. The UNDP then appointed GS1 US as code manager in May 2003 and ECCMA developed the ECCMA Open Technical Dictionary (eOTD) and the international standards ISO 22745 and ISO 8000.
==Description==
The four primary levels of the code are: Segment, Family, Class and Commodity.

Each level is coded in two decimal digits, with &#x27;00&#x27; treated specially to give segments, families and classes their own eight-digit codes.

Thus &#x27;Cats&#x27; are coded as 10101501, &#x27;Dogs&#x27; are coded as 10101502 and &#x27;Cattle&#x27; as 10101516. The class of &#x27;Livestock&#x27; is 10101500; the family of &#x27;Live animals&#x27; is 10100000, and all in the segment 10000000 of &#x27;Live Plant and Animal Material and Accessories and Supplies&#x27;.

Optionally, a further two digits can be added for the business function, such as &#x27;retail&#x27; or wholesale.

== Governance ==
The UNSPSC was jointly developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Dun &amp; Bradstreet in 1998 and is currently managed by GS1 US, which is responsible for overseeing code change requests, revising the codes and issuing regularly scheduled updates to the code, as well as managing special projects and initiatives.

== Availability and languages ==
The codeset is available in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Dutch, Mandarin Chinese, Portuguese, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, and Hungarian. The latest PDF version of the codeset is available for download at no cost, though a user account is required and can be created (also at no cost). A version in Microsoft Excel format is available to members, who can also request changes and suggest additions to the code.

<doc id="1300073" wikidata="Q1428744" url="?curid=1300073" title="Flight of the Amazon Queen">
<text>Flight of the Amazon Queen is a graphical point-and-click adventure game by Interactive Binary Illusions, originally released in 1995 for Amiga and MS-DOS. The game was re-released as freeware in 2004 for use with ScummVM. In January 2022, a sequel was announced, titled &quot;Return of the Amazon Queen&quot;.

== Development ==
The game was developed on Amiga 500 using AMOS and ported to C for release on MS-DOS. The game engine was called JASPAR: while developers had read about Lucasfilm&#x27;s SCUMM, the engine was designed in a different way. Deluxe Paint was used for art.

Gameplay is very similar in style to many of LucasArts&#x27; popular point-and-click adventures of the 1990s, and was inspired by &quot;Monkey Island&quot;. The game was inspired by the Indiana Jones film &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;: while the developers knew there was an adventure game of Indiana Jones, at the time it was dismissed as a movie tie-in.

==Plot==
In 1949, Joe King, pilot for hire and owner of the &quot;Amazon Queen&quot; airplane which he uses for his work, arrives at a hotel in Rio de Janeiro to transport his next customer, famous film actress Faye Russel, only to be ambushed by his Dutch rival Anderson. Locked in a hotel room and trapped by Anderson&#x27;s goons, Joe quickly gains assistance from Lola, a showgirl at the hotel and a former love interest, and escapes, making it back to the airport with his mechanic Sparky, just in time to stop his rival taking Faye. Wasting no time, Joe quickly pilots the Amazon Queen towards the location of Faye&#x27;s shoot, only for a storm to cause him to crash-land in the Amazon jungle. After getting Faye and Sparky to safety, Joe begins searching for help, soon encountering a parrot named Wedgewood with a message for help. Seeking out the person the message was for, Joe meets with Trader Bob, a merchant who lives amongst an indigenous tribe in the jungle, who soon asks for his help in rescuing a princess named Azura from Floda, a lederhosen company that Bob suspects is a cover for something much more sinister.

Joe quickly begins searching for the jungle, encountering an entire tribe of Amazon women who capture him and took in Faye when she decided to seek help herself. Released by the tribe, Joe agrees to help them rescue Azura as well. Finding the princess within a hidden base beneath Floda, Joe frees her and returns to her tribe, only to find himself coming face-to-face with Floda&#x27;s leader - Dr. Frank Ironstein, a mad scientist who seeks to conquer the world by turning Amazon women into dinosaur warriors through the use of his DinoRay invention. Seeing that Joe was smart to get around his security, Ironstein coerces him into helping him find an artifact from a temple that he requires known as the Crystal Skull, threatening to harm Azura if he does not. Left with no choice, Joe agrees, and heads for the temple, navigating traps and puzzles and eventually finding what he needs. Returning it to Ironstein, Joe quickly finds himself betrayed and trapped in Floda&#x27;s base, but soon escapes and goes after Ironstein with the help of Anderson, his former rival having originally been hired by the scientist to assist but later deciding to turn against him. Heading into the valley, Joe assists in trying to find Ironstein and manages to stop him, saving the day, before taking the scientist&#x27;s Zeppelin and flying into the sunset with Azura.

==Releases==
Prior to release, the game was sent by the publisher to Future Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Amiga Power&quot; magazine, to be reviewed by Jonathan Nash in issue 51. Whilst playing he found an error which prevented progression through the game (at the start, the bellhop would not relinquish the door key). He informed the publisher which resulted in the game release being delayed for several months as, at the time, the game had been sent to the disk duplication factory ready for reproduction. As it was also too late to change the magazine content and layout, the issue went to press with an apology that they had unintentionally reviewed an &quot;unfinished&quot; game, which was against one of their policies. The screenshots for the issue came from the PC version, also against their policy. The front cover of this issue featured an artist&#x27;s impression of the &#x27;escape from Rio&#x27; car chase scene.

The Amiga version had no voices, whereas the DOS CD version was a talkie featuring full voice-acting. The voice of the Temple Guardian was provided by British actress Penelope Keith. Actor William Hootkins, who played Red Six (Jek Porkins) in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, also voiced a number of characters.

The DOS CD version contained a mini-game of sorts. The file Queen.1 (1.82MB, CRC-32: D72DCD56) is found in the INTERVIE folder in the CD-ROM&#x27;s Root. The mini-game is a fully playable adventure game, where the main character tries to get an interview from the game&#x27;s development team. The game features MIDI music and full text, but no talkie version was ever released. The mini-game features familiar locations, characters, and game spoilers. The mini-game usually goes unnoticed as it is not bootable or playable from within the main game. The mini-game is fully supported by the recent ScummVM release.

In March 2004, the game was released as freeware, and support for it was added to ScummVM, allowing it to be played on Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, and many other operating systems and consoles. The datafiles for both the floppy disk and CD-ROM version are available from the ScummVM website. The Fedora RPM software repository has an installer for the game alongside ScummVM. This game is directly included in the Debian software repository.

In 2009, iPhSoft took ScummVM&#x27;s FOTAQ iPhone / iPod Touch free port and modified it. This modification has been commercially sold on iTunes but was discontinued in mid-2015 due to lack of iOS 8 and up support.

In 2013, the game was released at GOG.com as a digital download ready to play on modern PCs.

In March 2016, MojoTouch, working with John Passfield, the designer of the original game, released the 20th Anniversary Edition on the App Store (iOS), Google Play and Amazon Appstore. This version includes improved graphics rendering, full voice acting, new touch interface, auto-save, multi-language support, high definition menus and the following bonus material: Making of Flight of the Amazon Queen booklet, a play through of the interactive interview mini-game with audio commentary by John Passfield, the original game manuals (both US and international versions) and the Official Playing Guide.

==Reception==
Discussing the game&#x27;s commercial performance, designer John Passfield said in 2013: &quot;I believe it sold fewer than 100,000 copies, which at the time was okay&quot;.

&quot;Flight of the Amazon Queen&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. At GameRankings the iOS version scores 72.50% and the PC version 75.00%. &quot;Pocket Gamer&quot;&#x27;s Spanner Spencer called the iPhone release of &quot;Flight of the Amazon Queen&quot; more of a direct conversion than an adaptation, but was generally positive for this version.

<text>JetDirect is a line of external print servers formerly sold by Hewlett-Packard (HP). The JetDirect allows computer printers to be directly attached to a local area network. The &quot;JetDirect&quot; designation covers a range of models from the external 1 and 3 port parallel print servers known as the 300x and 500x, to the internal EIO print servers for use with HP printers. The JetDirect series also includes wireless print server (Bluetooth, 802.11b and g) models, as well as gigabit Ethernet and IPv6-compliant internal cards.

==History==

HP JetDirect was first introduced in March 1991 (code named QuickSilver) with the LaserJet IIIsi network printer (code named Eli). JetDirect is based on HP&#x27;s MIO (Modular Input/Output) interface, which was designed from the ground up with the IIIsi to create a mainstream full function high performance networked printer. The initial MIO interface card had Ethernet and Token Ring physical layer variants and used various networking protocols over an AUI/BNC connection. Initially, a printer needed a separate card for each protocol, such as TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, AppleTalk, or DLC/LLC. The following year, the team applied the technology to the legacy accessory slot on the LaserJetIIs and IIIs XIO (Extended Input/Output). MIO type JetDirect cards were also used for network connectivity on some HP/Agilent laboratory equipment, such as the 6890A and 6890 Plus series of gas chromatographs. These included unusual network connection types such as HPs I-Net, which was used as an interconnect between various pieces of hardware that controlled the 58xx and 68xx series gas chromatographs. Not until 1994 would MIO interface cards be released that could support more than one protocol per card.

The next development releases added connection interfaces. In 1992, a card with both 8P8C modular telephone and BNC connectors for Ethernet was released, and in 1993, the first external JetDirects were introduced with a parallel interface. This enabled JetDirect cards to connect to almost any printer, making that printer network-capable. In 1995, the Ex plus 3 was released, with 3 parallel ports on one network interface, allowing 3 printers to share 1 network address.

1997 saw the new numbering format for both internal and external JetDirect servers. Internals began the 6xx series with the release of the 600n, multiprotocol card that supported TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, DLC/LLC, and AppleTalk over a Token Ring network; along with the 1760x series external print server - also multiprotocol. An Ethernet version of the 600n was released in 1998. In 1999, the JetDirect autoswitch was introduced.

1998 also saw the release of 170x, the first value-line print server aimed at smaller companies that did not necessarily need full networking - only TCP/IP or IPX/SPX support. This was followed in 2000 by the JetDirect 70x home print server.

==Protocols==

More advanced versions of JetDirect supported a number of network printing protocols. However, the protocol that ended up being associated with it, the &quot;JetDirect protocol&quot;, is its raw TCP/IP protocol sometimes referred to as &quot;Socket API&quot; or &quot;RAW&quot;. It is an extremely simple network printing protocol. Submitting a print job can be done by netcating a file containing the page description language (e.g. PostScript, PCL) to the appropriate TCP port on the printer (default port is 9100). Information about the printer and job is simply sent to the client while the TCP connection is active. The port would reject connections if the printer is busy.

AppSocket is a very similar implementation by Tektronix for Phaser printers, later sold to Xerox. This protocol adds support for querying for printer status by non-printing users via a separate UDP port.

Most JetDirect devices also came with, &quot;JetDirect Interface&quot;, a telnet interface for configuring the device or printer.

==External print servers==

==Internal print servers==

===MIO===

MIO (Modular Input/Output) was the first technology developed by HP for its laser printers to enable the addition of peripheral cards such as JetDirect.

===LIO===

LIO (Low-end I/O) interfaces were developed by HP as a corporate response to the strictly internal MIO and EIO development path. The LIO interface differs from MIO/EIO in that the card is wrapped in an external plastic casing and is hot-swappable. The LIO backplane technology is based on a low power/low-voltage (&lt; 1-volt) differential signaling technology.

* 200N (C6502a) - Parallel with Centronics Interface
* 200m (J6039C) – 10/100 BASE-T (Supports only Windows and Apple Mac, fixed firmware)
* 250m (J6042B) – 10/100 BASE-T (Full support for Netware and Unix, firmware upgradeable)
* 280m (J6044A) – 802.11b Wireless

===EIO===
EIO (Enhanced Input/Output) is a modular interface developed by HP for its printers to expand their capabilities. EIO does not just serve JetDirect cards, but EIO hard drives and the EIO Connectivity card for adding communication ports to the printers as well. EIO utilizes the 3.3V signaling technology of the Conventional PCI bus and is significantly more energy-efficient than MIO technology. EIO print servers will not work in LIO slots, nor will the LIO print servers work in EIO slots.

* 1284B Parallel Card (J7972G) - Provides one Type C Mini-Centronics 36-pin parallel port.
* 600n – 10/100BASE-TX/10BASE2/LocalTalk (J3110A, J3111A, J3112A, J3113A) &quot;(Discontinued)&quot;
* 610n – Ethernet/Fast Ethernet/802.5, DE9, 8-pin Modular (J4169A, J4167A) &quot;(Discontinued)&quot;

===615n series ASIC issue===
In 2002 HP released the 615n series of Internal EIO print server. This model featured a new chipset manufactured in Singapore that had a problem related to either overheating or data overload. Otherwise known as the ASIC issue, this meant the 615n card could fail without warning, and when it failed, would completely shut down, appearing to vanish from the printer entirely.

Soon afterwards, HP began to do a per-item replacement policy that has ended as of October 31, 2008, when all known 615n cards were at least 4 years old and at such time HP felt it had taken appropriate corporate responsibility for a defect in manufacturing.

The 615n cards most often affected were the units installed in the Laserjet 2300, 4200 and Color 4600 series. Those cards appear to be most prone to failure.

Any 615n series card can fail, but it is up to HP to determine if the failure is due to the chipset or some other factor. HP recommended to call them or contact them through the Web site and they will proceed to do some simple troubleshooting steps to determine if the failure is due to the chipset or some other cause. If it is proven to be the chipset, HP would be able to replace the card under warranty with an as-new card (nominally a 620n).

==Other JetDirect products==

===bt1300===

The BT1300 is a Bluetooth compliant network adapter for network-ready parallel or USB printers. &quot;(Discontinued)&quot;
* 2MB flash memory for software and print server upgrades

===Print Server Appliance 4250===

The Print Server Appliance 4250 is perhaps the most ambitious of the JetDirect products - being a complete printing facility in a box. The system comes ready to go with a pre-loaded and configured Print Server running on a Linux core with an Apache Web Server. Once connected to the network, the device is able to manage up to 50 print shares with any supported network-ready printer, not just HP products. &quot;(Discontinued)&quot;

<text>Asipovichy (; ) is a town in Mogilev Region, Belarus. It serves as the administrative center of Asipovichy District. It is located southwest of Mogilev, south of the Minsk-Gomel expressway. It is located at the junction of railway lines between Minsk, Gomel, Mogilev, and Baranavichy. In 2020, its population was 29,900. As of 2024, it has a population of 29,103.

The active industries of Asipovichy include machine building, building materials, food production, and light and wood processing. It is home to the hydro-electric power plant on the Svislach River.

== History ==
A village existed on the site of the modern town during the 18th century, which in 1787 had seventeen dwellings as part of the Protasevichi folwark owned by Dominik Hieronim Radzivil in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. After the Second Partition of Poland the village came under control of the Russian Empire. According to an inventory in 1805, there were 22 dwellings and 146 inhabitants in the village, and then 26 dwellings in 1834. In addition to agriculture and animal husbandry, the villagers were engaged in weaving, fishing, and woodworking. A sawmill and flour mill were founded in 1885. Meanwhile, a railway station on the Libau–Romny Railway was founded in forest two kilometers from the village in 1872. The railway contributed to the expansion of the forestry industry and the development of crafts in the area. During the late 1880s and first half of the 1890s, two sawmills, a mill, several houses, a post office, and an inn were built. The narrow-gauge Asapovichy-Darahanava railway was laid down in 1896. The Russian Empire 1897 census recorded 449 inhabitants in the village and 99 in the settlement that developed around the station; the region was part of the Bobruysky Uyezd.

A railway sleeper plant was founded in 1900 and in the early 20th century the village turned into an urban settlement with a bakery, workshops for the manufacture and repair of sled wheels and agricultural implements. There were more than 1,000 inhabitants in 1904, and in the 1905 Russian Revolution there was a worker&#x27;s demonstration on 17 September 1905. The Asapovichy-Darahanava railway was extended to Uručča between 1905 and 1907, and the town turned into a rail junction from which more than a million poods of forestry products were shipped annually. There were two schools, a steam mill was built in 1908, a tar factory founded in 1909, and communication was established with Minsk and Mogilev. A locomotive depot opened in 1913 and the railway was extended to Slutsk in 1915 during World War I and converted to broad gauge. Soldiers of the town garrison rioted during August and September 1915. By 1917 there were 601 inhabitants in the village and 4,178 at the station, which became a town. After the October Revolution, a Red Guard detachment of 1,000 men was formed, which in January and February 1918 took part in the defeat of Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki&#x27;s Polish troops. The town was occupied by German troops between 19 February and November 1918, and by Polish troops between August 1919 and July 1920. Red partisan detachments occupied in the vicinity during 1919 and 1920.

A pharmacy was opened in 1921 and telegraph restored, two schools, a railway club were opened, and a library followed the next year. Asipovichy became the &quot;volost&quot; center in January 1922. A power plant was put into operation in 1922 and the Red Chemist tar factory the next year. The People&#x27;s House and Hospital was opened in 1924, and two clinics in 1925. The locomotive depot, sawmills, mill, and crafts workshops were restored, and a beekeeping cooperative was founded in 1925. A weather station was founded in 1926, and radio came to the town in 1925. By 1926 there were 3,504 inhabitants in the urban settlement, 616 in the village, and 141 at the station. During collectivization a machine tractor station was established in 1931 and an agricultural machinery repair workshop followed in 1932. From Asapovichy, a district newspaper began publishing and the Red Lumberjack newspaper targeted at loggers was published in 1934. Asapovichy received city status on 15 July 1935, and a secondary school, maternity hospital, and public bathhouse were built. In 1940 the town had grown to 14,000 inhabitants.

The town came under German occupation during World War II on 30 June 1941. Soviet partisans were active in the region during the war, undertaking sabotage against the railway junction and burning down the creamery. The town was liberated by the Red Army and local partisans on 30 June 1944.

In early 1944, the town was transferred to the administration of Bobruysk Region, reverting back to the Mogilev Region in 1954. Soon after liberation, the town was rebuilt – the forestry enterprise, mill, creamery and the artels Red Chemist, Progress, and Social Work were restored, telephone and telegraph services resumed. The radio station began broadcasting and the depot and railway station were rebuilt. During the postwar years, enterprises were reconstructed and expanded and new ones established. A reservoir and associated hydroelectric power station were built near the town in 1953. Its population had grown to 15,777 by 1959. Industry in the town expanded significantly by 1990 with a roofing plant, reinforced concrete, industrial plant, forest products, automobile assembly, bread products, household services, creamery, stationery, and concentrates factories.

In 2006, there were enterprises of mechanical engineering and metalworking, construction materials, and the food industry. There was a professional lyceum, a Belarusian gymnasium school, four secondary schools, a special boarding school, a children&#x27;s and youth sports and music school, an art school, 12 children&#x27;s preschools, and a center for correctional and developmental training and rehabilitation. There was a district Cultural Center, 5 libraries, a center for children and youth, a club for children and youth tourism and local lore, a district center of folk crafts, 2 hospitals, a clinic and pharmacies, and district service centers. The city has 2 hotels, 2 public houses, a factory of consumer services, 2 points of collective use, a computer club, driving schools and DTSAAF clubs, stadiums, gyms and sports complex grounds, restaurants, cafes, the city market, 5 post offices and others. Attractions include the Asipovichy Museum of History and Local Lore, Mass graves of Soviet soldiers and guerrillas who died in the Great Patriotic War, graves of victims of fascism. Liberation Monument, and the Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross.

== Military ==
The Yuzhny (South) military base is located on the southeastern outskirts of the town on &quot;ulitsa Rabochye-Krestyanskaya&quot; (street). The base is home to the 51st Guards Artillery Brigade, 336th Rocket Artillery Brigade, and the 465th Missile Brigade. In 2017 the 51st Guards Artillery Brigade marked 25 years located in the town. A now-closed military base known as Severny (North) was also located on the northern outskirts.

<doc id="1300085" wikidata="Q273724" url="?curid=1300085" title="Écu">
<text>The term écu () may refer to one of several French coins. The first &quot;écu&quot; was a gold coin (the &quot;écu d&#x27;or&quot;) minted during the reign of Louis IX of France, in 1266. The value of the &quot;écu&quot; varied considerably over time, and silver coins (known as &quot;écu d&#x27;argent&quot;) were also introduced.

&quot;Écu&quot; (from Latin &quot;scutum&quot;) means shield, and the coin was so called because its design included the coat of arms of France. The word is related to the Catalan &quot;escut&quot;, Italian &quot;scudo,&quot; or Portuguese and Castilian &quot;escudo&quot;. In English, the écu was often referred to as the crown, or the French crown in the eras of the English crown, British crown, and other crowns.

==History==
===Origin===
When Louis IX took the throne, France still used small silver deniers (abbreviated &quot;d&quot;.), which had circulated since the time of Charlemagne to the exclusion of larger silver or gold coins. Over the years, French kings had granted numerous nobles and bishops the right to strike coins and their “feudal” coinages competed with the royal coinage. Venice and Florence had already shown that there was demand for larger silver and gold coins and in 1266 Louis IX sought an advantage for the royal coinage by expanding it in these areas. His gold écu d&#x27;or showed a shield strewn with fleur-de-lis, which was the coat of arms of the kings of France at the time. These coins were valued as if gold was worth only 10 times as much as silver, an unrealistic ratio which Edward III of England had unsuccessfully tried to use. It failed again, Louis IX&#x27;s silver coins were a great success but his gold was not accepted at this rate and his successor discontinued gold coinage.

===Écu d&#x27;or===

Philip IV reintroduced gold coinage to France in 1296 and began a sequence of extravagantly designed but rapidly changing types. These coins were generally named for their obverse design, and the écu à la chaise which Philip VI introduced in 1337 showed a shield with the coat of arms of the kings of France beside the seated king. Philip VI spent vast quantities of these coins subsidizing his allies in the Netherlands at the outset of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, and this coin was widely copied in the Netherlands.
Charles VI ended the practice of frequently changing gold coin designs (but not that of tampering with their weight and value) with his écu à la couronne in 1385. This is again named after the shield on the obverse, which now has a crown above it and the modern coat of arms of the kings of France with three fleur-de-lis. Charles VI&#x27;s father had scored major gains against the English but had passed the cost on to his children. The government of the child Charles VI abandoned his father&#x27;s sound money policy by replacing his gold franc &quot;à cheval&quot;. The new &quot;écu à la couronne&quot; weighed less than the franc but its value was increased from 1&quot;livre&quot; (&quot;₶.&quot;), i.e. 20 &quot;sous&quot; (abbr. &quot;s&quot;), for the franc to 22&quot;s&quot;.  6&quot;d&quot;. (i.e. 1&quot;₶&quot;. 2&quot;s&quot;. 6&quot;d&quot;.) for the &quot;écu&quot;. Not only was this a devaluation, but while the franc had been identified with its valuation of one livre the valuation of the &quot;écu à la couronne&quot; was subject to manipulation.
In 1475, Louis XI created a variant of the &quot;écu à la couronne&quot; called an écu au soleil because the Sun now appeared above the shield. The process of devaluation continued. In 1515 the &quot;écu au soleil&quot; was valued at 36&quot;s. &quot;9&quot;d.&quot;, but this was increased to 45&quot;s&quot;. by 1547 even though its weight and fineness had been decreased in 1519. The &quot;écu&quot; design continued, essentially unchanged, on French gold coins until 1640 when the louis d’or replaced it.

In the second half of the 1500s gold and silver imported from Spanish America impacted the French economy, but the king of France was not getting much of the new wealth. He responded by revaluing the &quot;écu d’or&quot; in stages from 45&quot;s.&quot; in 1547 to 60&quot;s.&quot;, i.e. 3&quot;₶.&quot;, in 1577. This exacerbated the inflation caused by the increase in the supply of gold and silver, and the Estates General, which met at Blois in 1576, added to the public pressure to stop currency manipulation.
In 1577, Henri III agreed to stabilize the &quot;écu d’or&quot; at 3&quot;₶.&quot; and to adopt a new monetary system with prices quoted in &quot;écus&quot;. As part of this system, he introduced quarter and eighth &quot;écu&quot; coins struck in silver. The types of quarter and eighth &quot;écus d&#x27;argent&quot; paralleled those of the &quot;écu d’or&quot;, with the royal arms on the obverse and a cross on the reverse. For the first time in French history, these coins had a mark of value, with IIII or VIII placed on either side of the shield. Royal coins struck at mints in Navarre and Béarn added local heraldry to the fleur-de-lis of France. Feudal coinages at Bouillon and Sedan, Château-Renaud, and Rethel also struck quarter &quot;écus&quot;, with their own arms replacing the royal arms. By the 17th century this &quot;écu d’or&quot; would rise in value from 3&quot;₶.&quot; to more than 5&quot;₶.&quot;, while the hammered silver quarter &quot;écu&quot; struck until 1646 would rise in value from 15&quot;s&quot;. to 1&quot;₶.&quot;

===Silver Louis or écu of 1641===
This still did not give France a coin which could compete with the thalers which were popular in Germany. Moreover, French coins were still made by hand, so precious metal could be illegally shaved from the edges of the coins before passing them on. Finally, the &quot;écu d’or&quot; was made of 23 carat gold, which was not the international standard. Louis XIII fixed all this. He installed coinage making machinery in the Paris mint and replaced the &quot;écu d’or&quot; with the Louis d&#x27;or in 1640. In 1641 he introduced a thaler-sized silver coin originally called a &quot;Louis d’argent&quot;, issued at 9 to a French Mark of silver, 11/12 fine (24.93 g fine silver), and valued at three &quot;livres tournois&quot; - the same value in which the écu &quot;d’or&quot; was stabilized in 1577. This new 3&quot;₶.&quot; coin also came to be called an &quot;écu&quot;.

===Silver écu of 1726===
From 1690 to 1725 rates were unstable, resulting in the discontinuation of the &quot;Louis d&#x27;argent&quot; in favor of the new silver &quot;écu&quot;. In 1726 it was first issued at issued 8.3 to a French Mark of silver, 11/12 fine (or 27.03 g fine silver), and valued at 6&quot;₶&quot;. The silver &quot;écu&quot; was further broken down into a value coin (&quot;huitième d&#x27;écu&quot;), a value coin (the &quot;quart d&#x27;écu&quot;) and a value coin (the &quot;demi-écu&quot;). All had the king&#x27;s bust on the obverse and the royal coat of arms on the reverse.

This silver écu was known as the &quot;laubthaler&quot; in Germany. It circulated in Southern Germany at 2.8 South German gulden. In Switzerland it was worth four Berne livres or four francs of the Helvetic Republic. For more on the 17th-18th centuries currency system, see Louis d&#x27;or, livre tournois and Italian scudo.

===French Revolution ===
The silver &quot;écu&quot; disappeared during the French Revolution and was replaced by the franc at the rate of 6&quot;₶.&quot; = 6/1.0125 or 5.93 francs. At 4.5 g fine silver per franc this implied each écu contained only 26.66 g fine silver.

But the 5-franc silver coins minted throughout the 19th century were just a continuation of the old &quot;écus&quot;, and were often still called &quot;écu&quot; by French people. The &quot;écu&quot;, as it existed immediately before the French Revolution, was approximately equivalent (in terms of purchasing power) to 24 euro or 30 U.S. dollars in 2017.

<text>The Brigade de Répression du Banditisme (&#x27;Banditry Repression Brigade&#x27;) are police special units of the French Ministry of the Interior (&quot;Ministère de l&#x27;Intérieur&quot;). They are in charge of armed robberies, serious burglaries and scams, stolen cars and art thefts. 
The first analogue of the Brigade de répression du banditisme was created in 1894, when the Sûreté service seconded the so-called “voie publique” brigade to the headquarters of the Paris police. The main task of the &quot;voie publique Brigade&quot; was the fight against crime, which takes place in an ordinary, but nevertheless very hostile environment: on the street.

In 1948, Commissioner Charles Chenevier organized and led, under the auspices of la Sûreté nationale, a group called &quot;Brigade de répression du banditisme&quot;. In addition to Commissioner Chenevier himself, the group included Commissioner Gillard, Inspector Leclerc, Inspector Hours and Inspector Roger Bornish.

<text>Willy Voet (born 4 July 1945) is a Belgian sports physiotherapist. He is most widely known for his involvement in the Festina affair in the 1998 Tour de France (often dubbed the &quot;Tour of Shame&quot;).

==Biography==
Voet was born into a working-class family, with a father who worked as a train driver and who had been a semi-professional footballer and a mother who was an upholsterer. Voet started racing bicycles at the age of 15 and enjoyed some success as a junior, winning around 20 races in total, and scoring a win against Herman Van Springel. Voet&#x27;s first encounter with drugs was at the age of 18 when a friend and club team-mate persuaded him to take amphetamines for a race. He continued racing as an amateur until the age of 23, and returned to cycling as a soigneur six years later. After initially freelancing, he obtained his first contract as a soigneur with the Flandria team. Through his work as a soigneur Voet came to learn about the range of drugs used by riders and the techniques used to evade drug testing. Voet worked for a number of other teams, including Marc Zeep Centrale, Daf-Trucks and RMO, before joining Festina in 1993.

On 8 July 1998, Voet was stopped by French Customs agents on the &quot;Chemin du Dronckaert&quot; as he tried to cross the French-Belgian border close to Neuville-en-Ferrain, near Lille in northern France. In his Festina team car, the agents found large quantities of syringes and controlled substances including narcotics, erythropoietin (EPO), growth hormones, testosterone and amphetamines. He was arrested and the Festina cycling team was suspended from the race. Further investigation led to the suspension, arrest and prosecution of numerous Festina and TVM team riders and staff.
In 2000, Voet went on trial. He was convicted, given a 10-month suspended sentence and (the equivalent of) a US$4,200 fine.

Voet&#x27;s book &quot;Prikken en slikken&quot; (translated as &quot;Breaking The Chain&quot;) was released in 1999. In it, he claims to have revealed all that he knew regarding doping practices in the cycling world. The book also includes photographs of the written doping records he used to keep track of the different performance-enhancing drugs and dosages he had given to each of the team&#x27;s cyclists. Those records were used in court as evidence during the trials of the Festina affair.
Voet says he worked with the Festina team doctor, Eric Rijkaert, whose opinion was that drug-taking could not be eliminated from cycling and that it would be better therefore to see that doping happened with medical supervision. Rykaert died soon after the Festina trial and Voet left the sport to become a bus driver. He has been declared persona non grata by the Tour de France management and been asked to stay away from the race even as a private individual. He does maintain contact with cycling, however, and sometimes appears at seminars aimed at a greater understanding and greater restriction of drug-taking in cycling.

In 2002 Union Cycliste Internationale (then led by Hein Verbruggen) sued Voet over specific claims in his book. In 2004 the UCI won the case, and in 2006 won the appeal. Voet had made various claims about UCI and Verbruggen&#x27;s behavior related to the Laurent Brochard Lidocaine case at the 1997 UCI Road World Championships.

*Machar/Waterhead Stones - pair of neolithic standing stones

===&quot;Old Fintry&quot;===

&quot;Old&quot; Fintry was formed around the Church area or Clachan of Fintry in the early 13th century.

====Culcreuch Castle====
Culcreuch Castle was also built in Fintry around this period, in 1296, and was the historic seat of the chiefs of the Galbraith clan until 1624 when a series of scandals lost them their status under Scots Law.

From 1699, the Barons of Culcreuch resided there. The castle was converted into a hotel in the 1980s and operated as such until early 2020, bringing its 700-year lifespan to an end. Until 2020, it was Central Scotland&#x27;s longest-inhabited castle.

Culcreuch is a three-story, attic-topped rectangular tower house with a parapet and slate roof. The Napier family built the north and east expansions to the old tower about 1721, which match the original tower in style. The Castle is accessible by path from the village and is a popular local walk.

===&quot;New Fintry&quot;===

The small industrial ‘new town’ of Fintry (or &quot;Newton of Fintry&quot;) developed north-west of the original clachan following the establishment of
the Culcreuch cotton spinning mill by Peter Spiers in 1795. The mill and two small settlements were recorded in the mid-eighteenth century. the village had retained examples of former mill workers’ housing alongside traditional buildings from the later eighteenth and turn of the nineteenth centuries.

<doc id="1300097" wikidata="Q5120196" url="?curid=1300097" title="Cinchophen">
<text>Cinchophen (trade names Atophan, Quinophan, and Phenaquin) is an analgesic drug that was first produced by Doebner &amp; Gieskel in 1887, it was commercially introduced in 1908 as a treatment for gout. This drug is still used, in combination with Prednisolone, by veterinarians to treat arthritis in animals. It can be prepared starting from anilin, benzaldehyde and pyruvic acid in absolute ethanol. Use of this drug in humans ceased in the 1930s due to the discovery that cinchophen can cause serious liver damage. There is some evidence that it stimulates C-Fos.

== History ==
Cinchophen was first introduced in 1908 as &#x27;Atophan&#x27; and used for the treatment of gout and arthritis. It was efficacious at reducing the buildup of uric acid and became a popular medicine. Further studies in 1911 and 1912 were successful in isolating metabolites of cinchophen from human urine. During the 1920s, cases of severe adverse effects such as liver damage and cirrhosis had been clinically observed; the first case of jaundice was recorded in 1923 and the first fatality occurred in 1925. Approximately half of all patients experienced toxic effects and by 1932 there were 32 drugs available that contained cinchophen or its derivatives as their active ingredients, experiments were conducted to determine the drugs pharmacology but the mechanism of drug induced liver injury remained unclear. Cinchophen was considered to be too dangerous for human use in most countries but has applications in veterinary medicine as a treatment for osteoarthritis in dogs.

== Available forms ==
Cinchophen can be administered orally in tablet form or intravenously in liquid form.

== Toxicity and side-effects ==
Cinchophen toxicity may present 6 to 12 hours after administration. Symptoms can include hyperventilation, hyperthermia (fever), gastrointestinal discomfort, diarrhoea, hives, vomiting, delirium, hepatitis, jaundice, anorexia, convulsions, coma and death. Fatty degeneration of the heart and kidneys, necrosis of hepatic cells in addition to yellow atrophy of the liver have been recorded in autopsy findings.

== Treatment ==
Cinchophen administration should be immediately ceased if symptoms occur. There is no cure for acute cinchophen poisoning but early diagnosis and symptomatic treatments may be effective. Calcium lactate may be used to treat hives and oral or intravenous glucose can relieve gastrointestinal symptoms. If glucose is given, insulin may be needed to protect the liver from further damage. Oral alkali treatments can combat acidosis and anti-emetics may be required to manage nausea and vomiting. 

== Veterinary medicine ==
Cinchophen is the main active ingredient in prednoleucotropin (PLT), a medication used in the treatment of osteoarthritis in dogs. PLT may produce analgesic and anti-pyretic effects at higher doses. Osteoarthritic dogs treated with PLT have shown significant improvement of joint mobility, stiffness, lameness and weight bearing capacity. When administered correctly, PLT has shown similar clinical efficacy to phenylbutazone. The effects of PLT toxicity in dogs are similar to cinchophen toxicity in humans and include hepatotoxicity and gastric ulceration.

<text>The Johnson Wax Headquarters is the corporate headquarters of the household goods company S. C. Johnson &amp; Son in Racine, Wisconsin, United States. The original headquarters includes two buildings designed by Frank Lloyd Wright: the Administration Building, completed in April 1939, and the Research Tower, completed in November 1950. The headquarters also includes the Golden Rondelle Theater, relocated from the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, in addition to Fortaleza Hall and The Commons, a memorial to Samuel Curtis Johnson Jr.. Both of the original buildings were widely discussed when they were completed, and they have been depicted in several exhibits and media works. In addition, the original headquarters has received the American Institute of Architects&#x27; Twenty-five Year Award and has been designated as a National Historic Landmark.

S. C. Johnson&#x27;s chief executive, Herbert Fisk &quot;Hibbert&quot; Johnson Jr., hired Wright to design the Administration Building in 1936 after rejecting an earlier plan by J. Mandor Matson. Construction began that September, though work progressed slowly due to Wright&#x27;s attention to detail and use of novel construction methods. The Administration Building was well received upon its opening, undergoing minor modifications over the years. S. C. Johnson rehired Wright in 1945 to design the Research Tower, construction of which began in late 1947. After the Research Tower opened, S. C. Johnson used the structure for research and development (R&amp;D). The Golden Rondelle Theater opened in 1967 as a visitor center for the headquarters. The Research Tower was closed in 1982 due to safety concerns. The Fortaleza Hall was finished in 2010, and the Research Tower partially opened for tours in 2014.

The Johnson Administration Building is designed in a variation of the streamlined Art Moderne style, with a curved brick facade and Pyrex glass-tube windows. The Administration Building&#x27;s primary interior space is a great workroom with concrete shell columns topped by large &quot;calyxes&quot;. The Administration Building also includes offices on a mezzanine and penthouse, in addition to an overpass connecting with a carport; these spaces contain furniture designed by Wright. The Research Tower, a 15-story structure with a brick facade and Pyrex-tube windows, is next to the Administration Building and is surrounded by a courtyard. The tower has alternating square floors and circular mezzanines, cantilevered outward from the structural core.

== Site ==
The Johnson Wax Headquarters is located at 1525 Howe Street in Racine, Wisconsin, United States. The original headquarters comprises two structures, the Administration Building and Research Tower. These occupy a city block bounded by 16th Street to the south, Howe Street to the west, 15th Street to the north, and Franklin Street to the east. The Administration Building occupies a square site measuring on each side. The Research Tower is immediately to the north of the Administration Building, connected to it by a footbridge. The two original buildings are among five that the American architect Frank Lloyd Wright designed around Racine, the others being Wingspread, the Keland House, and the Hardy House.

=== Related structures ===

Just north of the original Johnson Wax Headquarters campus is the Golden Rondelle Theater, near the intersection of 14th and Franklin streets. Designed by Lippincott &amp; Margulies as a 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair pavilion, the theater has a saucer-shaped, gold-colored roof supported by six concrete columns. The Golden Rondelle Theater was moved to the Johnson Wax Headquarters after the fair closed. The modern theater has 308 seats and functions as a visitor center for the Johnson Wax Headquarters. Flanking the theater are two brick structures with glass-tube windows, designed by Taliesin Associated Architects; one is a lobby and display area, while the other structure is an exit.

Immediately to the east of the Golden Rondelle Theater, and northeast of the original headquarters, is Fortaleza Hall and The Commons, which opened in 2010 and was designed by Foster + Partners. The structure was built as a memorial to Samuel Curtis Johnson Jr. the president of the household goods company S. C. Johnson. Its name refers to Samuel Johnson&#x27;s 1998 trip to Fortaleza, Brazil, which replicated a journey that his father Herbert Fisk &quot;Hibbert&quot; Johnson Jr. had made in 1935. Fortaleza Hall consists of a spherical atrium with a disc-shaped roof. The facade is made of 85 glass panels measuring across. Inside is a replica of the Sikorsky S-38 plane that Hibbert had flown, a cafeteria, a waterfall, a precast concrete wall with forest motifs, a green wall, and a reading room. There is also a gift shop.

The campus also includes a plastic globe, the first version of which was erected in 1954. The globe contained plastic markers denoting the locations of S. C. Johnson&#x27;s offices and distributors around the world. According to the &quot;Racine Journal Times&quot;, the globe was the largest of its kind in the world when it was erected, with a circumference of . The globe, designed by Rand McNally and built by the Steiner Plastics Company, was tilted at a 23.5-degree angle and is illuminated by neon tubes. The outer portion of the globe was supported by a steel frame measuring across. The current globe, installed in 1986, is similar in design to the original globe, rotating once every 24 minutes.

== Development ==
S. C. Johnson &amp; Son was founded in Racine, Wisconsin, in 1886 and expanded rapidly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By 1936, some of the company&#x27;s executives worked in a wooden house and a series of annexes next to the company&#x27;s existing factory and warehouse. Hibbert Johnson initially wanted to expand the existing buildings before deciding on an entirely new campus. Samuel Johnson later reflected that his father &quot;was tired of us being seen as a little old family enterprise in a little town in the Midwest&quot;.

=== Original building ===

==== Design ====
Before starting his new building, Hibbert visited The Hershey Company&#x27;s headquarters in Hershey, Pennsylvania, for inspiration. At the time, Hershey had just completed an air-conditioned office building, and S. C. Johnson&#x27;s existing building lacked air conditioning, forcing the factory to close whenever temperatures exceeded . Upon his return to Racine, Hibbert hired J. Mandor Matson to design an office building near S. C. Johnson&#x27;s existing headquarters. S. C. Johnson bought land immediately to the east of its existing headquarters and razed the houses there. Matson&#x27;s first proposal from 1935 called for a T-shaped building, with the stem of the T running south toward 16th Street. The plans called for a Beaux-Arts structure with six niches depicting the history of S. C. Johnson&#x27;s wax products. The initial drawings lacked windows, though a revised blueprint from 1936 did include windows. Hibbert was unimpressed with the plans, as was S. C. Johnson&#x27;s general manager Jack Ramsey, who said Matson&#x27;s plan &quot;isn&#x27;t good enough, it&#x27;s just another building&quot;. Ramsey and S. C. Johnson&#x27;s advertising manager, William Connolly, were also unable to suggest suitable revisions.

Hibbert and Ramsey decided to expand their search for an architect. Hibbert gave Matson&#x27;s drawings to his brother-in-law Jack Louis, an executive at the public-relations firm that handled advertisements for S. C. Johnson. Louis&#x27;s colleagues Melvin Brorby and E. Willis Jones, who also disliked the design, recommended another architect, who in turn recommended that Hibbert and Ramsey reach out to Frank Lloyd Wright. Jones visited Wright&#x27;s Taliesin studio in Spring Green, Wisconsin, twice in July 1936 to discuss the proposed building, whereupon Wright characterized Matson&#x27;s design as a crematorium. That month, Hibbert went to Taliesin to talk with the architect. Despite their personal disagreements, Hibbert asked Wright to design a headquarters for S. C. Johnson &amp; Son in Racine, The architect offered to design a building costing $200,000 (much less than what Matson was asking), and he charged a commission equivalent to 10% of the construction cost.

Wright promised that &quot;the Johnson Administration Building is not going to be what you expect&quot;, and he sought to design a structure that would stimulate workers, rather than being merely satisfying. Wright replaced Matson as the architect in late July 1936, less than a month before construction was supposed to begin; it was the first major commission given to Wright&#x27;s Taliesin Fellowship. Hibbert&#x27;s daughter Karen reported being elated that her father had decided to hire Wright. Shortly afterward, Wright visited the site that S. C. Johnson had acquired in Racine. At the time, the site had a series of wood-frame houses, a few small stores, and a cinema. The site of the new headquarters had been cleared by late August 1936. Wright&#x27;s plans for the Johnson Administration Building were based on his earlier, unbuilt design for the &quot;Capital Journal&quot; offices in Salem, Oregon, which included a series of mushroom–shaped columns and translucent walls.

Wright tried to convince the company to relocate to the Racine suburbs, as he wanted to incorporate his proposals for Broadacre City into the S. C. Johnson complex. Ramsey and Connolly were vehemently against the idea, but Wright continued to promote it until his wife Olgivanna warned that S. C. Johnson might fire him, too. Instead, Wright&#x27;s team drew up plans at Taliesin for an Administration Building in Racine. Two of Wright&#x27;s apprentices, John Howe and William Wesley Peters, recalled that Wright rushed to draw his ideas but that he also focused on perfecting the building&#x27;s geometry, particularly the grids of columns. Wright allocated space to each of S. C. Johnson&#x27;s departments based on what each department needed. On August 9, 1936, ten days after he was hired, Wright went to Racine to show the plans to Hibbert and other S. C. Johnson officials. Hibbert requested two changes to the plans, although he retained Wright&#x27;s draft plan for the most part. By the end of the month, Wright asked three apprentices to create a model of the building.

==== Initial work and delays ====
Hibbert Johnson suggested that his good friend Ben Wiltscheck be hired as the building&#x27;s general contractor. Wright, who was typically adversarial toward contractors, saw Wiltscheck as &quot;good help for us in getting this building properly built&quot;. By September 1936, preliminary work on the site had begun, and Peters and Mendel Glickman finalized the building&#x27;s structural details. Apprentices at Taliesin created 18 to 20 drawings, many of which depicted the building&#x27;s great workroom, a relatively simple space. Wright continued to refine the drawings as construction proceeded. Concurrently, Wright&#x27;s apprentice Robert Mosher had been overseeing the construction of Fallingwater, Edgar J. Kaufmann&#x27;s country estate in Pennsylvania, when Wright forced Mosher to return to Wisconsin after a dispute involving reinforcing steel. Mosher was instead appointed to oversee the construction of the S. C. Johnson Administration Building, while another apprentice, Edgar Tafel, took Mosher&#x27;s place in Pennsylvania.

Wiltscheck and Mosher worked out of a nearby shack. Wright visited a few times a month, sometimes bringing food and drinks for workers. The Wisconsin Industrial Commission refused to approve plans for various aspects of the building, citing building-code violations, but ultimately approved most of these plans with few changes. The commission withheld its approval of the building&#x27;s columns; in particular, inspectors felt that the columns were too thin to support the loads that had been indicated in Glickman&#x27;s drawings. In the meantime, work continued. To provide space for a car-wash area and a squash court, S. C. Johnson bought a plot north of the Administration Building that November. By the end of the year, the building&#x27;s estimated cost had increased to $300,000. Wright, who had designed just two buildings in the previous half-decade, had severely underestimated the materials and labor expenses.

Construction briefly stalled in late 1936 after Wright caught pneumonia, rendering him unable to answer contractors&#x27; questions. In addition, fourteen footings had to be rebuilt to accommodate the weight of a planned footbridge and squash court. Mosher returned to Pennsylvania in January 1937 to supervise Fallingwater, and Tafel was appointed as the Johnson Administration Building&#x27;s supervisor. Tafel lived in a former bar across from the Administration Building&#x27;s site, playing an organ as entertainment. The same month, S. C. Johnson bought a parcel immediately northwest of the Administration Building, as Ramsey wanted to construct a truck-repair garage there. Wright agreed to expand the roof of the Administration Building&#x27;s carport above this new garage. Not all of Wright&#x27;s proposals for the building were implemented; for example, Hibbert rejected a proposed pipe organ in the great workroom.

==== Structural tests, delays, and completion ====
Comparatively little progress occurred in 1937, in part because of Wright&#x27;s extreme attention to detail and in part because some of the construction methods he used were entirely brand-new. In several instances, Wright finalized plans for certain parts of the building as they were being constructed. Wright created detailed drawings for the columns in the great workroom in early 1937, only to redesign the columns when the drawings were nearly finished. He spent one year adjusting the details of glass tubes that were to be installed on the facade. Meanwhile, state officials refused to approve the columns because they were not of sufficient thickness. As such, Wright decided to build one prototype column and place progressively heavier loads onto it. The concrete for the column was poured in late May, and Wright began testing the column that June. The column was able to withstand a load of before it showed any strain, at which point Wright ordered workers to pull down the column. Afterward, state officials finally gave Wright permission to build the columns. Work on the Johnson Administration Building was accelerated, and laborers began laying masonry.

Wiltscheck reported in June 1937 that the building was half-completed, and by that August, some of the walls had been finished. Work had to be halted in late October 1937 after Wright, with little warning, revised plans for the squash court and the cafeteria–theater space. The building&#x27;s exterior was being completed by January 1938, but work on the interior finishes had not started because the HVAC systems had to be built first. The estimated cost had increased to $450,000 by then. During early 1938, Wright refined his plans for the interiors while at Taliesin West, his studio in Arizona. After Corning Glass began delivering Pyrex glass tubes for the building&#x27;s facade, disagreements emerged over who should install the glass tubes. Progress was further delayed by labor strikes during early 1938; for example, laborers called a strike to demand higher wages, and material deliveries were delayed when truckers went on strike. Although Wiltscheck and Wright&#x27;s apprentices all raised concerns about the use of Pyrex tubes for the skylights, which they claimed would leak, Wright refused to consider alternative materials. Hibbert secretly ordered standard glass skylights anyway; Tafel told Wright about this change, and Hibbert fired Tafel in retaliation. Hibbert eventually agreed to rehire Tafel and use Pyrex skylights after Wright threatened to resign over this dispute.

The iron pipes in the floors were installed in April 1938, followed by the pouring of concrete floor slabs during June and July. Contractors used a &quot;pumpcrete&quot; machine to pour an hour. Peters recalled that, just before the second floor was ready to be poured, he had to reinforce some of the first-floor columns after discovering that Wright had made a last-minute change to the placement of the second-floor columns. Olgivanna Wright recalled that her husband had become increasingly agitated because contractors and laborers requested constant clarifications on various aspects of the project. S. C. Johnson&#x27;s board of directors, who were also displeased at the slow pace of construction, stopped paying Wright and Wiltscheck. Wright postponed a trip to England so he could oversee the building&#x27;s construction. By that December, Wright was again ill with pneumonia, and the opening of the building had been postponed to early the next year. Workers began painting the columns and installing interior partitions in January 1939, and construction workers were invited to preview the building&#x27;s interiors the next month. Having completed the Administration Building, Hibbert asked Wright to design the Wingspread mansion outside of Racine, which was also completed in 1939.

=== Opening ===
S. C. Johnson employees began moving into the new offices at the end of March 1939. The building had exceeded its original budget considerably; Fisk Johnson, one of S. C. Johnson&#x27;s subsequent chief executives, estimated that the structure&#x27;s cost was half of the company&#x27;s entire net worth. Local Boy Scouts, Cub Scouts, and Sea Scouts members were invited to greet people for the building&#x27;s official opening that April. Around 23,000 or 26,000 members of the public visited the building on April 23, 1939, constituting more than a third of Racine&#x27;s population at the time. Prince Frederik IX and Princess Ingrid of Denmark visited it on a private tour the next day. The Johnson Administration Building also attracted other visitors, including a wide variety of architects and the animator Walt Disney (who was an acquaintance of Wright&#x27;s).

The caulking between the Administration Building&#x27;s Pyrex glass tubes began to peel off after it was completed, causing leaks, which continued for several years. Glass tubes sometimes fell from the ceiling as well, and because the great workroom&#x27;s light bulbs were wedged between the glass tubes, workers needed to remove the tubes with a special scaffold every time they had to replace the light bulbs. Conversely, the Administration Building&#x27;s structural system experienced no structural failures, except for the carport&#x27;s roof, which was repaired in 1941 after it sagged.

=== Research Tower expansion ===

==== Planning ====
By 1943, S. C. Johnson&#x27;s research department had 25 workers, who were split across two buildings. That year, the research department&#x27;s director J. Vernon Steinle submitted a memo to Hibbert in which he outlined what he wanted in a laboratory building. Hibbert, who liked the idea, forwarded Steinle&#x27;s memo to Wright. Hibbert wanted to avoid experimental design details, a main source of delays in the Administration Building&#x27;s construction. Sources disagree over whether Wright or Hibbert had suggested developing a tower instead of a conventional low-rise building. Wright&#x27;s initial plans for the research building called for a 18-story tower, with a hollow core in a fashion similar to Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s 4D Apartment Tower and Dymaxion houses. The building would have two small elevators and two small stairs, later combined into one larger stair and elevator each. The cantilevered floor slabs in the plans had been influenced by his proposal for unbuilt apartment buildings at St. Mark&#x27;s Church in-the-Bowery in New York City. Additionally, there were to be a courtyard around the tower, a two-story &quot;U&quot;-shaped building surrounding the courtyard, and footbridges connecting the Administration Building and the Research Tower.

Wright continued to fine-tune his design for the Research Tower during 1944, and he briefly considered constructing the tower to the west of the Administration Building, across Howe Street. By that September, Wright&#x27;s plans called for a 16-story tower and two additional stories above the existing carport. Hibbert signed off on the revised plans in November 1944. Steinle, who was tasked with determining how the equipment would be laid out, commissioned a scale model of the proposed tower. Ben Wiltscheck agreed to be rehired as the tower&#x27;s general contractor. William Wesley Peters was responsible for the tower&#x27;s structural calculations, a particularly difficult task for him, as no similar structure had been built before. Work on the plans was delayed in 1945, as Wright had not finalized his drawings, thus preventing Peters and the tower&#x27;s mechanical engineer from preparing their respective drawings. That August, Samuel Lewis was hired as the mechanical engineer. Some parts of the tower were redesigned after Lewis found that there was not enough space for utilities in some parts of the building.

S. C. Johnson announced in November 1945 that they had rehired Wright to design a 15-story laboratory tower next to the Administration Building. Sketches of the laboratory tower were displayed in Milwaukee, and further details of the building were revealed in March 1946. These plans called for a laboratory tower and several ancillary structures hosting various S. C. Johnson departments. Meanwhile, Wright and S. C. Johnson negotiated the architect&#x27;s fee and the cost of the building. Wright had estimated in 1944 that the building would cost $750,000, although official building permits from 1947 listed the tower&#x27;s cost as $1.3 million. S. C. Johnson ultimately agreed in 1948 to pay Wright based on a cost estimate of $2 million, with the stipulation that Wright not receive further compensation if construction went over budget.

==== Construction ====

Work on the Research Tower was delayed because the federal Civilian Production Administration, which reviewed industrial projects after World War II, would not approve the structure. S. C. Johnson received partial approval for the tower only after lobbying from U.S. Representative Lawrence H. Smith. At the end of August 1947, S. C. Johnson awarded the general contract to Wiltscheck &amp; Nelson, a joint venture between Ben Wiltscheck and local firm Nelson Incorporated. A groundbreaking ceremony was hosted for the Research Tower on November 6, 1947, just over two months later. By January 1948, workers were nearly finished excavating the research tower&#x27;s site and were pouring foundations for an extension to the carport. Laborers dug the foundation for the tower&#x27;s core partially by hand, and a crane operator excavated other parts of the core&#x27;s foundation with the help of a periscope and a mirror. The foundation was poured that February; according to one magazine, the project involved the largest continuous concrete pour in Wisconsin at the time.

Laborers began pouring the floor slabs for the tower in mid-1948. Separate wooden formwork was built for the square main stories and the circular mezzanines; to create the hollow floor slabs, the concrete for each story was poured in two sections. The lowest story took seven weeks to pour, but workers became more efficient at pouring concrete as the structure ascended, eventually pouring one floor every three weeks. Two of the tower&#x27;s floors had been completed by the end of 1948, a year after the groundbreaking ceremony. Because laborers had difficulties using the pumpcrete machine, they instead used conventional mixers on the ground. Further delays were incurred because the concrete had to be poured with as few deformities or inaccuracies as possible. As such, concrete work did not reach the fifteenth floor until mid-1949; the concrete frame topped out that October.

The Research Tower was built without a fire sprinkler system, as Wright disliked the sprinklers&#x27; appearance, though S. C. Johnson&#x27;s insurance company threatened not to insure the tower unless it had sprinklers. Hibbert agreed to pay an increased insurance premium in exchange for not adding fire sprinklers. Wright also thought up ways to prevent the Research Tower&#x27;s Pyrex windows from leaking. As a temporary measure, wooden sheeting was placed around the building in late 1949 while the Pyrex tubes were being delivered. After the laboratory equipment was delivered in April 1950, workers installed the equipment and the glass at the same time. By October 1950, the tower was nearly complete, and S. C. Johnson was sending out invitations to the tower&#x27;s opening ceremony. The tower was dedicated on November 17, 1950. Hundreds of guests, including scientists, educators, and industrialists, were invited to the ceremony, where Wright said that &quot;the building speaks eloquently for itself&quot;.

=== 1950s to 1960s ===
After the Research Tower was opened, S. C. Johnson began using the structure for research and development (R&amp;D). The writer Jonathan Lipman reflected that the Research Tower&#x27;s design had increased morale among chemists who shared space there. In the first decade of the tower&#x27;s operations, scientists developed products such as furniture polish, insect repellent, air freshener, and insecticide. In 1954, S. C. Johnson erected a large plastic globe outside the headquarters, serving as a corporate symbol. Meanwhile, thousands of people toured the Administration Building annually, particularly during the weekends; on some days, the building accommodated up to 300 visitors. Although many visitors came from the nearby cities of Chicago and Milwaukee, the buildings also attracted visitors from around the world, particularly members of women&#x27;s groups and architecture fans. In addition, people visiting other manufacturing companies in the area often stopped by the Johnson Wax buildings, and politicians such as Wisconsin governor Walter J. Kohler Jr. and U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren sometimes made visits.

Steinle and another S. C. Johnson chemist, Edward Wilder, recalled that each pair of stories in the Research Tower was equivalent to five laboratories, but they also said that chemists often waited to chat with colleagues on different floors because they did not want to wait for the tower&#x27;s only elevator. The R&amp;D department quickly outgrew its space, prompting S. C. Johnson to convert the carport into an enclosed laboratory in 1957. The same year, parts of the Administration Building&#x27;s skylights were replaced with corrugated plastic. Additionally, the structure&#x27;s glass-tube windows experienced the same kinds of leaks that had occurred at the Administration Building. S. C. Johnson announced in 1959 that it would expand the headquarters&#x27; R&amp;D department. After Wright&#x27;s death that year, William Wesley Peters (who by then led Wright&#x27;s successor firm, Taliesin Associated Architects) was hired to design an expansion to the east of the tower&#x27;s carport. The annex was completed in 1961.

S. C. Johnson hired the Carrier Corporation in 1964 to install a thermoelectric cooling system with 28 air conditioners, which lacked the refrigerant and compressor coils found in typical air-cooling systems. After the end of the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, the Golden Rondelle Theater was relocated to the Johnson Wax Headquarters in 1966. The land to the north of the existing headquarters was acquired and cleared to make way for the theater, and two pavilion structures, also designed by Taliesin Associated Architects, were built next to it. The theater was rededicated in July 1967; it initially hosted screenings of the film &quot;To Be Alive!&quot;, as well as S. C. Johnson meetings. By then, the Johnson Wax Headquarters accommodated over 9,000 annual visitors. Meanwhile, S. C. Johnson&#x27;s business continued to grow over the years, prompting the company to construct additional offices outside Racine in the late 1960s. Taliesin Associated Architects oversaw other minor changes to the two original buildings over the years. The Research Tower&#x27;s floors were originally painted red, but over the years, each pair of floors was repainted in different colors to prevent confusion.

=== 1970s to 1990s ===
S. C. Johnson hired Llewelyn Davies Associates in 1969 to create plans for redeveloping the area around the Johnson Wax Headquarters. The plan was released in 1970 and called for several buildings immediately north of the headquarters, such as an employee cafeteria, a workshop and maintenance building, a public exhibition building, a parking garage. The plan also called for a public park around the Golden Rondelle Theater and housing north of the theater. The company continued to grow, prompting S. C. Johnson to ask four firms to design an expansion of the headquarters in the 1970s, although none of these designs were used. During the 1970s, the carpet in the Administration Building&#x27;s workroom was changed, and laborers added and renovated offices in the workroom&#x27;s mezzanine. S. C. Johnson also added fire partitions in the Research Tower. The company considered adding a second staircase to the tower but ultimately decided against it.

In 1977, S. C. Johnson bought the St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital building, immediately to the east of the headquarters, for $1.5 million. The company constructed a tunnel from the original headquarters to the hospital, which was renamed the East Complex. S. C. Johnson subsequently moved several departments from the original headquarters to the hospital. Due to safety concerns, the Research Tower was largely abandoned in 1982 after S. C. Johnson relocated its research facilities to another building. The company retained some offices on the tower&#x27;s second story. By that decade, the Golden Rondelle Theater had become a visitor center for the headquarters, which had 15,000 annual visitors. A plastic globe outside the headquarters was installed in 1986 to replace the original globe. S. C. Johnson also wanted to repurpose the tower, though these plans were ultimately dropped because it could not meet modern building codes without undergoing significant design changes. The tower&#x27;s facade was cleaned in 1987, and S. C. Johnson celebrated the Administration Building&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 1989.

The Administration Building remained largely unchanged into the 1990s, though the desks had been modified to accommodate computers. The director of the company&#x27;s guest relations department claimed that the Johnson Administration Building was one of a few Wright–designed structures that was still being used for its original purpose. Despite widespread architectural acclaim, the Administration Building continued to experience maintenance issues; the roof often leaked, and maintenance costs were 25% higher than at similarly sized buildings. S. C. Johnson policy prevented its executives from making major changes to the design. The company was unable to install sound-absorbing panels, nor could it equip the mezzanine with telecommunications wires, and employees brought in doctors&#x27; notes recommending against the use of Wright&#x27;s chairs. By the late 1990s, S. C. Johnson executives privately considered moving some of the headquarters functions to Chicago due to the lack of qualified executives in Racine.

=== 2000s to present ===
The Administration Building&#x27;s theater/cafeteria was turned into a conference area around 2001, and the Research Tower was again cleaned that year. Following Sam Johnson&#x27;s death in 2004, his son Fisk Johnson announced that he would construct a memorial to his father, with a replica of a plane that Sam Johnson had flown to Brazil in 1998. Fisk hired Foster and Partners to design the building, known as &quot;Project Honor&quot;, in 2006; the new structure would host the headquarters&#x27; cafeteria and other meeting spaces. Work on the new structure, later known as Fortaleza Hall, began in September 2007. The replica plane was installed in 2009, and Fortaleza Hall opened next to the original headquarters campus in January 2010. The S. C. Johnson Gallery, an exhibition space within Fortaleza Hall, opened in 2012.

During the early 2010s, S. C. Johnson renovated the tower as part of a $30 million refurbishment project, and it replaced the bricks and glass tubes on the tower&#x27;s facade. In 2013, S. C. Johnson announced plans to open the Research Tower to the public for the first time, and two of the tower&#x27;s floors were restored to their 1950s appearance. The tower was relit on December 21, 2013, when the renovations were nearly completed. The Research Tower opened to the public on May 2, 2014, hosting tours three days a week. The third floor and third mezzanine contain various props, including beakers, scales, centrifuges, archival photographs, and letters. S. C. Johnson also announced in 2014 that it would spend another $1.5 million renovating the headquarters&#x27; offices.

For its restoration of the tower, S. C. Johnson received a Spirit Award from the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy. The Johnson Wax Headquarters was subsequently added to the Frank Lloyd Wright Trail, which was established in 2017. S. C. Johnson retrofitted the headquarters with a geothermal energy system in 2019.

== Administration Building ==
The Johnson Administration Building was one of three major buildings that Frank Lloyd Wright designed in the 1930s; the other two were Fallingwater in Stewart Township, Pennsylvania, and Herbert Jacobs&#x27;s first house in Madison, Wisconsin. Similar to Wright&#x27;s earlier Larkin Administration Building in Buffalo, New York, the Johnson Administration Building was intended to draw occupants&#x27; attention inward, rather than outward. The historian Robert McCarter wrote that S. C. Johnson and the Larkin Company both had &quot;enlightened management&quot; who aimed to better their employees&#x27; lives, thus making Wright the ideal architect for the Johnson Administration Building. Wright referred to the Larkin Building as the &quot;masculine sire&quot; to the Johnson Building, which he saw as more feminine due to its curves.

=== Exterior ===

The original building is designed in a variation of the streamlined Art Moderne style. Wright, who felt that many modern–style buildings were &quot;not really modern&quot;, devised plans for a low-lying, streamlined structure. The facade is made of brick, tinted in a Cherokee red hue and manufactured in Streator, Illinois. The bricks were made in 200 distinct shapes. The bricks are alternately laid apart, with blocks of cork placed between the bricks. Concrete was poured into the gaps between the bricks and cork, while steel rods and copper ties were added for reinforcement. Each horizontal course of bricks measures high. Surplus bricks from the project were used in the first Herbert Jacobs House in Madison.

For the most part, the building lacks windows and other openings. The facade uses of Pyrex glass tubes, manufactured by Corning Glass in New York. Two bands of Pyrex tubes cross the facade horizontally: one band approximately above the ground, and the other at the cornice immediately below the roof. The Pyrex tubes function as clerestory windows, and they distort natural light, preventing occupants from looking out into the neighborhood and vice versa. Several diameters of tubes are used. Each band consists of multiple tubes stacked atop each other, which are placed on aluminum racks and bound using wires. The gaps between the tubes created shadows, which gave the impression of alternating light-colored and dark bands. Since the building was equipped with an air-conditioning system from the outset, the glass tubes were not designed to be movable. One unintended effect of the Pyrex tubes was that they focused light onto certain parts of the great workroom, creating glare.

The entrance faces S. C. Johnson&#x27;s parking lot to the north, away from 16th Street, which was more industrial in nature. The building had no exits to the east, south, and west, as Wright had convinced the state&#x27;s industrial commission that the structure was completely fireproof. Instead, a planting strip surrounds the building on these sides. The facade originally did not contain any public-facing signage, although a small sign was mounted on the northern elevation of the building&#x27;s carport, facing the parking lot. Robert Mosher, who thought Wright would reject any suggestions for signage on the facade, reportedly told Hibbert and S. C. Johnson&#x27;s board of directors that the building &quot;is going to be such a contribution that you won&#x27;t need any sign&quot;. Between the main building and its carport is a driveway for visitors. To the right of the main entrance is a red tile on which Wright signed his initials.

=== Interior ===
The Administration Building&#x27;s interior covers and consists of a great workroom, as well as offices on a mezzanine and in a penthouse. For the most part, the building lacked hallways because Wright wanted people to circulate vertically between floors, rather than horizontally across a single floor. This also reduced the amount of unused &quot;dead space&quot; in the building. The mezzanine and penthouse are accessed by a pair of elevators, which are made of cylindrical bronze cages. The hydraulic elevators can carry up to and are operated from an electric control panel in the basement. There is also a pair of cylindrical staircase halls flanking the main lobby, and several spiraling iron staircases connect the mezzanine to the main level.

Two circular ventilation shafts extend the building&#x27;s full height, eliminating the need for air ducts on the roof. The presence of the shafts led Wright to describe the building as breathing through two &quot;nostrils&quot;. Air filters, compressors, and fans were installed at the bottom of each shaft. Filtered air was distributed via a plenum chamber under the workroom&#x27;s mezzanine. Heating pipes, made of wrought iron, are embedded into the concrete floor slabs. The heating system, divided into six sectors that could operate independently, was an early example of a radiant heating system. By the 21st century, heating was provided by ventilation ducts, while the original heating pipes were used as telecommunications conduits. The foundation consists of reinforced concrete footers measuring thick, beneath which is an layer of crushed stone. The drinking fountains were surrounded by flower bowls.

==== Great workroom ====
Wright decided to put all clerical staff in the great workroom, which is variously cited as measuring or . Its design was heavily based on that of Wright&#x27;s &quot;Capital Journal&quot; headquarters in Oregon. The interior primarily uses concrete, though some brick was also used. The floor is covered with rubber tiles, which are painted a Cherokee red. S. C. Johnson keeps a collection of Cherokee-red tiles in case the floor tiles need to be replaced. The great workroom is illuminated by rooftop skylights and by the facade&#x27;s glass bands, in addition to artificial lighting. Wooden blinds are installed in front of the Pyrex glass tubes to reduce glare.

The room is arranged in an open plan, with space for around 200 desks. When it was completed, the room was large enough to host meetings for S. C. Johnson&#x27;s entire workforce, including laborers at nearby factories. Departments with related functions were placed next to each other. For example, the billing and credit departments worked in the western portion of the room, while the outgoing mail, records, and sales departments worked in the eastern portion. Tafel described the great workroom as &quot;the first landscaped office&quot; because of the flexible interior layout. The great workroom is surrounded by a mezzanine with offices for departmental heads and junior executives. Offices occupy the outermost of the mezzanine, while a corridor protrudes inward. The mezzanine included offices for the cost, accounting, and traffic departments, in addition to an office for S. C. Johnson&#x27;s assistant treasurer. In addition to individual filing rooms for each department, there was storage space for S. C. Johnson&#x27;s general files under the southern end of the mezzanine. Mail equipment was placed under the eastern part of the mezzanine. Cork boards were installed under the mezzanine to dampen sound.

The great workroom&#x27;s ceiling is supported by 60 columns, a number deliberately selected by Wright to avoid asymmetry. Wright, who described the columns as &quot;dendriform&quot;, had intended for the columns&#x27; design to emphasize the interiors, rather than merely serving a utilitarian function. The columns are spaced apart, forming a grid. At the bottom of each column is a footer with steel ribs. The columns consist of concrete shells surrounding a hollow shaft, the concrete shells have steel mesh cores for added strength. The columns are made of Portland cement and can carry loads of up to , higher than what Wright had specified. In contrast to typical columns, they are narrower at their bases and wider at their tops. The bottoms of each column measure in diameter, while their tops are about wide. The columns are cited as measuring , , or tall. Because of their shape, the columns have been compared to lily pads, golf tees, and ice cream cones. The great workroom&#x27;s lobby, to the north, has columns measuring over tall.

Above each column is a &quot;calyx&quot;, which measures in diameter. Hollow pads with concrete rings and struts, which Wright referred to as &quot;petals&quot;, stand atop each of the calyxes. There are circular concrete slabs above each of the petals, as well as above the lobby columns. The roof above the workroom is composed of small beams that connect the petals, thereby forming a rigid frame. There are skylights in the spaces between the calyxes. Because there is nothing above much of the great workroom, most of the columns had to support only the weight of a section of roof, plus any snow that accumulated on the roof. The ceiling is angled to absorb sound. The skylights were originally made of Pyrex tubes but have since been replaced with corrugated plastic sheets.

==== Other spaces ====
The building&#x27;s basement has service spaces such as lockers, restrooms, and rest areas, which are accessed via circular stairs. The great workroom is connected to the building&#x27;s carport by an overpass at the second and third stories. The theater, located on the second story of the overpass, contains a projection booth and a dining–kitchen area to the north, as well as a podium to the south. The theater can accommodate 250 people. Senior executives and S. C. Johnson officers worked in the penthouse. The penthouse consists of two wings connected by a central conference room: one wing for S. C. Johnson&#x27;s operations division, and one for the advertising and media division. Hibbert Johnson&#x27;s office was located between the wings, to the north of the conference room. Writers described the executive offices as having no locks.

Like the great workroom, the interior of the carport is placed on a grid of columns spaced 20 feet apart. The carport columns are shorter versions of the columns that appear in the great workroom, measuring only tall. Since 1957, the carport has been a laboratory. The roof of the carport originally functioned as a recreational area for workers. North of the carport was a squash court with a garage for maintenance vehicles under it. When the Research Tower was built, a separate set of offices was constructed on the site of the squash court and carport&#x27;s roof. These offices have a forced-air system and hot water ceiling panels for cooling and heating, respectively.

==== Furniture ====

Wright designed the building&#x27;s furniture, which was made out of metal tubes and produced by Steelcase. Around 40 types of furniture were created for the building, many of which incorporate ovals and curved shapes. Wright created three-legged aluminum chairs, which were color-coded by department and would tip over if its occupants did not have both feet on the ground. After several employees (and Wright himself) fell out of the chairs, the architect designed a four-legged variant of the chair, and a fourth leg was later added to most of the three-legged chairs.

There were also nine types of desks; the typical desk measured , although round and rectangular tables of different dimensions were created for some departments, such as the mailroom. The desks themselves generally had oval wooden desktops, with cutouts for devices such as comptometers and typewriters. The built-in drawers under each desk could swing outward. The information desk, custom-made for the site, wraps around one of the lobby&#x27;s columns. Replicas of the desks have been sold to the public.

== Research Tower ==
Wright also designed the 15-story Research Tower. Sources disagree on the building&#x27;s exact height; the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat and a contemporary &quot;Journal Times&quot; article cite the tower as measuring tall, which would have made it the tallest building in Racine when it was built. S. C. Johnson&#x27;s website, ArchDaily, and a &quot;Journal Times&quot; article from 1982 all describe the building as tall; this would make it Racine&#x27;s second-tallest extant building behind the Racine County Courthouse. Above ground level are seven square-shaped full stories, alternating with seven circular mezzanines; the second floor, which is square, has no mezzanine.

Wright referred to the Research Tower as a &quot;helio-lab&quot; because of the way it was illuminated by the sun. A garden and three fountain pools surround its base, while a court on three sides provides parking for employees.

=== Exterior ===

The facade has full-height windows between brick spandrel panels. Since there are spandrels only at the full stories, the facade appears to have only eight levels. The bricks are tinted Cherokee red and are the same as those used on the Administration Building. The windows are composed of glass tubes measuring in diameter and separated by insulating strips made of synthetic rubber. There are of glass tubes, which are bound to aluminum racks; these racks contain semicircular incisions for the glass tubes. The Research Tower contains of insulating strips. There are also plate-glass panels behind the glass-tube walls. To prevent water from leaking into the building, there are gaskets and tiny pieces of plastic between the Pyrex tubes.

Several smaller structures are connected to the Research Tower. These include a three-story annex for S. C. Johnson&#x27;s advertising department, technical department, and lounge. There is also a pilot plant with one basement level and one above-ground story. These structures completely surround the Research Tower, creating a courtyard around the structure. As such, the Research Tower&#x27;s ground story is not visible from the street, giving it the impression that it is floating. There is a two-story annex on Franklin Street, which dates from the early 1960s and is clad with red brick, molded Plexiglas, reinforced concrete, and Kasota limestone.

=== Interior ===
The Research Tower weighs . Each of the circular mezzanines measures in diameter, while the squarish main floors measure across. The main floors were originally used as laboratories, while the mezzanines contained offices. There are dumbwaiters within the open spaces between the main floors and the mezzanines, and staff could call out to each other through the openings. Each story is cantilevered from a cylindrical core, a principle that Wright would later use for his design of the Price Tower in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. As a result, the Research Tower is sometimes likened to a tree and described as having a &quot;taproot core&quot;. Like the Administration Building, the Research Tower&#x27;s interiors do not have corridors in order to maximize the amount of usable office space. The elevator doors are curved, as are doors to the bathrooms.

The core itself measures across and extends into the ground. The bottom of the core is stabilized by a circular slab measuring across; it ranges in thickness from , with the outermost portions of the slab being thinner. The walls of the core are thick. There is a staircase and an elevator in the core. Because of the dimensions of the core, the staircase narrows to a minimum width of or . Utilities such as the HVAC system are embedded into the core. There are separate pipes for distilled, cold, and hot water; compressed air; illuminating gas; nitrogen/carbon dioxide; and steam. Alternating current and direct current energy is provided at two voltages. The top of the core contains equipment for the intake and exhaust of cold and hot air.

At each story, utility pipes split from the core, running under the floor slabs to the laboratory desks and the exterior walls. Each floor slab is hollow, with ducts, rebar, and steel sheets sandwiched between the two layers of concrete; they taper in thickness toward their perimeters. The floor slabs reached their maximum thickness near the core, where the ceilings measured as low as . Fume hoods for laboratory equipment were installed near the core, and there were ratchets to raise or lower the work surfaces under the hoods. The spaces had no sprinklers, so combustible items were banned from the tower. On each pair of floors, there are air-intake openings on the main floors and air-exhaust vents on the ceilings of the mezzanines. Each story also had an air-intake grille and radiators. The floors themselves originally housed several departments, in addition to a research library, and had built-in furniture. About six researchers could work on each floor.

When part of the courtyard was enclosed in a 1957 expansion, the ground-level laboratories were expanded by , while the basement laboratories were expanded by . The annex on Franklin Street measures across, with of space. The Franklin Street annex contains 38 staff offices, two general offices, and a circular room used for meetings.

=== Reception ===
==== Contemporary ====

When the Administration Building was under construction, &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; described it as a &quot;complete about-face from the skyscraper&quot;, citing its streamlined, low-to-the-ground design. The design also led &quot;The Journal Times&quot; to characterize the structure as an entirely new type of office building. The editor of the &quot;Architectural Review&quot;, in a conversation with Ben Wiltscheck, regarded the Administration Building as &quot;a progressive landmark in office building architecture&quot;. One publication described the tapering concrete columns in the building as having a &quot;fairy-like slenderness&quot;, while &quot;Time&quot; magazine said the Johnson Administration Building &quot;is unlike any other in the world&quot; and was among Wright&#x27;s best work.

After the Administration Building was finished, a writer for &quot;The Hartford Courant&quot; wrote that Wright has &quot;made us little men feel big&quot;, and &quot;The Capital Times&quot; said that Wright &quot;has again pioneered with the Johnson building&quot;. United Press International wrote that the building&#x27;s design was meant to erase differences between management and subordinates, saying that &quot;the errand boy and the president sit on the same kind of a chair&quot;. &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot; of Spokane, Washington, wrote that architects had called the structure &quot;the greatest contribution to business housing since the design of the skyscraper&quot;, and &quot;Life&quot; magazine compared the Administration Building&#x27;s futuristic design to the architecture of the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The editor of the &quot;Milwaukee Journal&quot; likened the &quot;cool, gliding, musical&quot; interior to &quot;a woman swimming naked in a stream&quot;. Ward Morehouse, visiting the building in 1946, felt that &quot;it should be put on wheels and shown to the nation&quot;.

When the Research Tower was under construction, the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; described it as a &quot;glass Hollyhock&quot;, a reference to Wright&#x27;s Hollyhock House in Los Angeles. The architect Philip Johnson, who directed MoMA&#x27;s architecture department, regarded the Research Tower as one of three buildings that &quot;will make 1950 rival any year in American architecture&quot;, along with the headquarters of the United Nations and 860–880 Lake Shore Drive. When the tower was finished, one commentator wrote that it was &quot;as soul-stirring as the Colosseum, the Alps, or Sorrento&quot;, while &quot;The Berkshire Eagle&quot; of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, likened the core to a flagpole. Additionally, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine wrote that Wright had &quot;create[d] a kind of beauty the past had never seen&quot;, listing the Johnson Wax Headquarters as one of seven &quot;art wonders of America&quot;, while another observer likened the Administration Building to a cathedral.

==== Retrospective ====
American architects deemed the Johnson Wax Headquarters one of &quot;seven wonders of American architecture&quot; in a 1958 survey. The Administration Building and Research Tower received the Twenty-five Year Award from the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in 1974, in honor of the buildings&#x27; &quot;design of enduring significance&quot;. The AIA also described the two structures as being among seventeen &quot;examples of [Wright&#x27;s] contribution to American culture&quot;. Additionally, in a survey of 170 AIA fellows in 1986, the building ranked ninth on a list of &quot;most successful examples of architectural design&quot;. A writer for the &quot;Journal Times&quot; said in 1993 that the Johnson Wax Headquarters and Wingspread &quot;overshadow the rest of the architecture in Racine County&quot; because they were so well-known.

When Hibbert died in 1978, the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art&#x27;s director said that Hibbert&#x27;s decision to hire Wright &quot;was a daring and courageous action at the time&quot;. Michael Kimmelman of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote in 1986 that the Johnson Wax Headquarters &quot;is without question one of the most remarkable commercial structures ever built&quot;. The British historian Kenneth Frampton described the structures as &quot;possibly the most profound work of art that America has ever produced&quot;. A local newspaper reporter, touring the headquarters in the 1990s, wrote that &quot;you&#x27;ll never look at any building the same way again&quot;, describing the structures as not merely utilitarian. Dale Buss wrote in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in 2009 that the headquarters&#x27; design had inspired &quot;a form of architectural husbandry&quot; by S. C. Johnson, although he thought the Golden Rondelle Theater&#x27;s design clashed with the rest of the complex.

Several critics have compared the Administration Building to a church, including Paul Goldberger of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and Paul Richard of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Wright&#x27;s biographer Robert Twombly regarded the Administration Building as reflecting an outdated belief that subordinates should be observed by their supervisors. In a 2000 book about American architecture, the writer Carter Wiseman compared the interior of the great workroom to &quot;a dense but sheltering forest&quot; because of the presence of the columns. &quot;The Architectural Review&quot;, in 2009, described the Administration Building&#x27;s design as having &quot;a socialist bent&quot;, since the great workroom functioned as a shared workspace. As for the Research Tower, the journalist Brendan Gill described it as being more esthetically pleasing than practical.

After the Research Tower opened for tours in 2014, a writer for &quot;Architectural Record&quot; wrote that the tower was cramped and that its props were out of place, but that the Administration Building as &quot;remarkably light and airy&quot;. James S. Russell of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote that the structures had retained their character over time, both because of S. C. Johnson&#x27;s stewardship and because of their innovative nature. Blair Kamin wrote that both buildings &quot;richly express the optimism of their time&quot;, and a writer for &quot;Curbed&quot; saw both buildings as &quot;a dashing vision of the modern American workplace&quot;. A writer for &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; said in 2017 that the buildings contrasted with Wright&#x27;s residential designs, which harmonized with their surroundings rather than turning inward as the Johnson Wax buildings did.

=== Media ===
Although comparatively few publications reported on the Administration Building&#x27;s construction, the building itself received large amounts of publicity after construction began. &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, and &quot;Architectural Forum&quot; magazines all covered the building while it was under construction, and news agencies published stories about the building&#x27;s opening in newspapers across the U.S. When the Research Tower was finished, it too was widely publicized. Articles and images of the buildings were published around the world, and the architectural and mechanical aspects of both buildings were detailed in trade journals. S. C. Johnson credited the buildings&#x27; design with creating publicity for the company, whose executives gave Wright a plaque and a $20,000 check as a sign of gratitude in 1953. In addition, the company used depictions of the buildings in its trademarks until 1959. &quot;The Capital Times&quot; estimated in 1962 that revenue from publicity had exceeded the headquarters&#x27; construction cost.

The printmaker Frances Myers created a folio with images of the Johnson Wax Headquarters in 1980, and Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art curator Jonathan Lipman published a book about the buildings in 1986. In addition, the headquarters buildings were described in a 30-minute video project called &quot;The Wright Way&quot;, filmed in 1994.

=== Landmark designations ===

The buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1974; although most NRHP listings were required to be at least 50 years old, this rule was waived for both structures. Both buildings were designated as National Historic Landmarks in March 1976, comprising the first National Historic Landmark designation in Racine, as well as Wisconsin&#x27;s 15th such designation overall. After Racine&#x27;s city council passed a law in 1974 permitting city-landmark designations, the Administration Building and Research Center were among the first buildings in Racine to be nominated for such a designation; the structures became Racine city landmarks in August 1975. The Johnson Wax Headquarters was and ten other Wright buildings were nominated as a World Heritage Site in 2011, but the Johnson buildings were removed from the nomination at S. C. Johnson&#x27;s request.

=== Exhibits and architectural influence ===
After the Administration Building was completed, a model of the building was displayed at New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in 1940. Both the tower and original building were featured in a traveling exhibit of Wright&#x27;s work in 1951. MoMA also hosted an exhibit about the buildings in 1952, and it displayed photographs of the buildings in another exhibit the next year. The Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art sponsored a traveling exhibit about the buildings beginning in 1986. The Milwaukee Art Museum displayed schematics and models of the buildings in 1990, and MoMA also displayed cutaways of the offices in a 1994 exhibit. In addition, the headquarters was detailed in an exhibit by the Racine Heritage Museum in 2002.

The designs of the Johnson Wax buildings also influenced Wright and his personal style. According to the historian Vincent Scully, the Administration Building was one of Wright&#x27;s earliest buildings to incorporate curves, and Wright himself said in 1951 that he had been inspired to &quot;abolish the box&quot; when he designed the Administration Building. As for the Research Tower, Wright regarded it as a prototype of his high-rise designs. The historian Franklin Toker wrote that the Administration Building had been a particularly important commission for Wright, who did not want to be known primarily as a designer of houses. Ultimately, the Johnson Wax Headquarters and the Larkin Building were the only major commercial buildings Wright ever designed. The Johnson buildings helped revive his career, which had stalled in the 1930s.

The Administration Building&#x27;s workroom has been cited as an early example of an open-plan office. Fay Jones, one of Wright&#x27;s apprentices, cited the Johnson Administration Building as an inspiration for his own Mildred B. Cooper Memorial Chapel in Arkansas. Other buildings have also used design elements inspired by those in the Johnson Wax buildings; for example, Santiago Calatrava&#x27;s Milwaukee Art Museum building contains tapering columns like those at the Administration Building.

<text>Martin of Opava, O.P. (died 1278) also known as Martin of Poland, was a 13th-century Dominican friar, bishop and chronicler.

==Life==
Known in Latin as &quot;Frater Martinus Ordinis Praedicatorum&quot; (Brother Martin of the Order of Preachers), he is believed to have been born, at an unknown date, in the Silesian town of Opava, at that time part of the Margraviate of Moravia.

From the middle of the 13th century, Martin was active in Rome as confessor and chaplain for Pope Alexander IV and his successors, Urban IV, Clement IV, Gregory X, Innocent V, Adrian V and John XXI (d. 1277), the last pope to appear in his chronicles. On 22 June 1278, Pope Nicholas III, while in Viterbo, appointed him archbishop of Gniezno.

While travelling to his new episcopal see, Martin died in Bologna, where he was buried at the Basilica of San Domenico, near the tomb of the founder of his Order.

==Works==
Martin&#x27;s Latin chronicle, the &quot;Chronicon pontificum et imperatorum&quot;, was intended for the school-room. It is mostly derivative in content and is therefore of limited value to modern historians. However, its importance is in the way the material is presented, which is a quantum leap forward in didactic method. The genius lies in its layout: each double page covers fifty years with fifty lines per page. The left-hand pages give the history of the papacy, with one line per year, and the right-hand pages give the history of emperors, the two accounts being kept strictly parallel. This was a revolutionary approach in graphic design, which was not appreciated by all his contemporaries: many manuscripts simply copy the text without retaining the page layout, which results in a rather chaotic chronology. The chronicle was enormously influential; over 400 manuscripts are known, and the influence on many dozens of later chroniclers is palpable. Translations were made into many medieval vernaculars, including Middle English, as well as an Old French translation by Sébastien Mamerot in the late 15th century. Martin&#x27;s &quot;Chronicon&quot; is the most influential source for the legend of &quot;Pope Joan&quot;. It was also a source for Rashid al-Din Hamadani&#x27;s &quot;Jami al-Tawarikh&quot;.

Other of his works include the &quot;Promptuarium Exemplorum&quot;.

<text>Moquegua (, founded by the Spanish colonists as Villa de Santa Catalina de Guadalcázar del Valle de Moquegua) is a city in southern Peru, located in the Department of Moquegua, of which it is the capital. It is also capital of Mariscal Nieto Province and Moquegua District. It is located 1144 kilometers south of the capital city of Lima.

==History==
This region was occupied for thousands of years by successive cultures of indigenous peoples. The Wari culture built numerous monuments, and developed terraced fields to support crop cultivation on hillsides hundreds of years before the Inca conquered them and expanded their territory into this area. Cerro Baúl is the remains of a Wari monumental site, on top of a hill outside of Moquegua.

Numerous Tiwanaku sites are also in the area. It was an important colonial center for the Tiwanaku state. The valley is the only area of Peru to house both Wari and Tiwanaku ruins.

The Chiribaya culture flourished in the Moquegua area and near the Pacific island coast from about 1000 until 1360.

According to Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, the Inca Emperor Mayta Cápac organized the military expedition that extended the Inca domains to the shore of the Pacific. They overcame other indigenous peoples in the 15th century; in the next century they were conquered by the Spanish.

There is no definite information about the year of the city&#x27;s founding by the Spanish. Tradition holds that the colonial city was founded on 25 November 1541, by Pedro Cansino and his wife Josefina de Bilbao.

==Geography==
===Climate===

==Tourism==
This city is located in the mountains of the region of the same name. It has many gardens and other tourist attractions, which make it a popular destination in Peru.

The Plaza de Armas, is the Main Square and center of the city. It was designed in the 19th century by the French architect, Gustave Eiffel, who designed the Eiffel Tower in Paris. In this main square the Jose Carlos Mariategui Museum and the Contisuyo Museum, are located.

The Casa del Regidor Perpetuo de la Ciudad, is a house built in the 18th century. It has a front of carved stone. Operated as a house museum, it is furnished with high quality antiques.

The district of Torata, located 24 km away from the city, has traditional houses with &quot;mojinete&quot; roofs. The parish church has beautiful wood carvings.

The Pan-American Highway passes through the city.

==Economy==
Moquegua&#x27;s economy is largely based on mining. Resources include copper, silver, gold and molybdenum. Cuajone and part of Toquepala Mine are located in the Mcal. Nieto Province. A copper smelter and refinery to treat copper concentrates from those mines is located in Ilo province.

<text>In finance, a specific risk is a risk that affects a very small number of assets. This is sometimes referred to as &quot;unsystematic risk&quot;. In a balanced portfolio of assets there would be a spread between general market risk and risks specific to individual components of that portfolio. Determination of the extent of exposure to individual risks is made using models such as Treynor-Black in which the optimal share of a security is inversely proportional to the square of its specific risk.

An example would be news that is specific to either one stock or a group of companies, such as the loss of a patent or a major natural disaster affecting the company&#x27;s operation.

Unlike systematic risk or market risk, specific risk can be diversified away. In fact, most unsystematic risk is removed by holding a portfolio of about twenty-five to thirty securities.

<doc id="1300134" wikidata="Q524206" url="?curid=1300134" title="Chu (river)">
<text>The Chu is a river in northern Kyrgyzstan and southern Kazakhstan. Of its total length of , the first 115 kilometres are in Kyrgyzstan, then for 221 kilometres the river serves as the border between Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan and the last 731 kilometres are in Kazakhstan. It is one of the longest rivers in Kyrgyzstan and in Kazakhstan. It has a drainage basin of .

The Chüy Region, the northernmost and most populous administrative region of Kyrgyzstan, is named after the river; so are Chüy Avenue, the main street of the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek and the city of Shu in Kazakhstan&#x27;s Jambyl Region.

==Course==
The Chu is formed by the confluence of the rivers Joon Aryk and Kochkor, in the Kochkor District of the Naryn Region. After approaching within a few kilometres of Lake Issyk-Kul (near Balykchy), without either flowing into the lake or draining it, it turns towards the northwest. In the 1950s an old riverbed called Ketmaldy (also Buugan) linked the Chu River and Issyk Kul. During floods part of Chu water would reach the lake, but such outflow has not been seen since the construction of the Orto-Tokoy Reservoir. After passing through the narrow Boom Gorge (, &quot;Boomskoye ushchelye&quot;), the river enters the comparatively flat Chüy Valley, within which lie the Kyrgyz capital Bishkek and the Kazakh city of Shu. Much of the Chu&#x27;s water is diverted into a network of canals, such as the Great Chüy Canal, to irrigate the fertile black soils of the Chüy Valley for farming, on both the Kyrgyz and Kazakh sides of the river.

As the Chu flows through the Chüy Valley, it forms the border between Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan for more than a hundred kilometres, but then it leaves Kyrgyzstan and flows into Kazakhstan, where it flows at the northern edge of the Moiynkum Desert, with lake Kokuydynkol close to its channel. In wet years it may reach the endorheic salt lake Akzhaykyn, located among the vast solonchaks of the Ashchykol Depression.

==History==

The area of this river was originally home to the Iranian Sughds who spoke Soghdian, an Eastern Iranian language.

During the Middle Ages, the area was strategically important. It was the setting of Suyab, the capital of the Western Turkic Khaganate and Balasagun, the capital of the Qara Khitai (Western Liao dynasty).

The Chu River posed a risk of flooding for settlements located in the Chu Valley. In the winter of 1878, an ice gorge formed on the Chu River upstream from Tokmok, the administrative centre of Semirechye Province. This was followed by severe flooding that damaged the town and the province&#x27;s capital was moved to Pishpek (Bishkek).

==Dams==
The river flow is regulated by the dam at Orto-Tokoy Reservoir in Kyrgyzstan built in 1957 and the dam at Tasotkel Reservoir in Kazakhstan built in 1974.

==Ecology and environment==

===Environmental monitoring===
The Kyrgyz State Agency for Hydrometeorology and the Kazakhstan Hydrometeorological Service (Kazhydromet) operate a number of water quality monitoring stations on the Chu River and its tributaries.

===Water quality===
According to the Kyrgyz State Agency for Hydrometeorology, in 2004–08 the water pollution index of the Chu River in the Chu Valley ranged from 0.25 to 0.7 units, which is interpreted as Class II (&quot;Clean water&quot;). The only exception was a monitoring point downstream of Vasilyevka village where the water pollution index ranged from 0.4 to 1.2 units and water quality was assessed as Class II(Clean)/Class III (&quot;Moderately polluted&quot;).

According to the Kazakhstan Hydrometeorological Service (Kazhydromet), the water pollution index of the Shu (Chu) River in the Jambyl Region of Kazakhstan amounted to 2.01 (Class III, &quot;Moderately polluted&quot;) in 2008, and 1.83 (Class III, &quot;Moderately polluted&quot;) in 2009. Such water quality parameters as biochemical oxygen demand, nitrites, copper, and phenols exceeded the maximum allowable concentrations.

==Major tributaries==
In Kyrgyzstan, 4892 rivers and canals flow into Chu River. The main tributaries are, from source to mouth:
* Kochkor (left)
* Joon Aryk (right)
* Chong-Kemin (right)

<doc id="1300146" wikidata="Q1592759" url="?curid=1300146" title="James Brown (Louisiana politician)">
<text>James Brown (September 11, 1766April 7, 1835) was an American lawyer, planter, diplomat and politician who served as a Secretary of State for the new state of Kentucky, and later as U.S. Senator from Louisiana, and Minister to France (1823–1829) before his retirement and death in Philadelphia.

==Early and family life==
Born near Staunton, Virginia, to John Brown and his wife, young James Brown had brothers John and Samuel Brown and sisters Mary and Elizabeth who either survived him or had children who survived him, unlike his brother Preston. His brother John Brown became the U.S. Senator from Kentucky and active in its gaining statehood. Well-connected among the southern elite, they were also cousins of John Breckinridge, James Breckinridge and Francis Preston.

James Brown attended Washington College (later Washington and Lee University) in Lexington, Virginia, and the College of William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg. James Brown read law, was admitted to the Virginia bar, and commenced practice in Frankfort, Kentucky, then still part of Virginia.

He married Ann &quot;Nancy&quot; Hart, one of seven children of Revolutionary War veteran and successful businessman Col. Thomas Hart, who moved from North Carolina to Maryland and finally Lexington, Kentucky. Her sister Lucretia married Henry Clay, who became U.S. Senator from Kentucky. Her brother Nathaniel G. S. Hart died in the War of 1812. They did not have any children who survived them. James Brown was the uncle of James Brown Clay, Henry Clay, Jr., John Morrison Clay, the great uncle of B. Gratz Brown, and the cousin-in-law of Thomas Hart Benton.

==Career==
James Brown commanded a company of Virginia sharpshooters in an expedition against the Indians in 1789. He served as secretary to Isaac Shelby, the first governor of Kentucky, in 1792. On June 5, 1792, Shelby nominated Brown as Secretary of State; he was confirmed by the state senate and served until October 13, 1796.

Soon after the United States made the Louisiana Purchase, Brown moved to New Orleans, where he was appointed in 1804 as secretary of the Territory of Orleans. He served from October 1 to December 11 of that year, when he was appointed as U.S. Attorney-General for the Territory.

Brown became one of the wealthiest planters and slave owners on the German Coast. His extensive plantation produced sugar through the use of slave labor.

In January 1811, some slaves from James Brown&#x27;s plantations (some of them jointly owned by his nephew James Humphreys) joined in the 1811 German Coast uprising. One was the African-born warrior Kook, who became one of the insurrection&#x27;s leaders. It was the largest slave rebellion in U.S. history, but was soon suppressed. The insurgents killed only two white men, but between the one battle, subsequent summary executions by militia members, and executions after tribunals of slaveowners, ninety-five black men died. Some of the men were from Saint-Domingue, brought to Spanish Louisiana several years earlier by white French refugees, as well as by refugee &quot;gens de couleur&quot; (free people of colour), who fled the violence and expropriations of the Haitian Revolution. Others were slaves imported directly from Africa.

Brown was elected as a Democratic Republican to the United States Senate on December 1, 1812, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Jean Noël Destréhan, whose slaves were also involved in the quashed uprising. Brown served in the U.S. Senate from February 5, 1813, until March 3, 1817. The Louisiana legislature refused to reelect him, but in 1819 he was elected again to the U.S. Senate as a Democratic-Republican aligned with Southern Jeffersonians. During the Missouri Crisis, he favored the unrestricted expansion of slavery west of the Mississippi River. He served from March 4, 1819, until December 10, 1823, when he resigned. During his tenure, Brown was the chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations (Sixteenth Congress).

With the consent of the Senate, the President appointed Brown U.S. Minister to France, and he served 1823–1829. Returning to the U.S., he settled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He agreed to support a Quaker appeal for funds to aid an American free black settlement in Ontario, Canada, known as the Wilberforce Colony. It had been started by free blacks from Cincinnati, Ohio, who emigrated to Canada in reaction to discriminatory laws and especially a highly destructive riot against them in 1829.

Brown was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814 and the American Philosophical Society in 1827.

==Death and legacy==
Brown survived his wife Nancy, as well as a Philadelphia cholera outbreak in 1831, but died in Philadelphia in 1835. After a service at its St. Stephen&#x27;s Church, he was buried in the vault of nearby Christ Church, Philadelphia.

Brown is remembered as one of the drafters of the first Louisiana Civil Code of 1808, a work undertaken together with Louis Moreau-Lislet and Edward Livingston.

<doc id="1300148" wikidata="Q16136302" url="?curid=1300148" title="Webster Hubbell">
<text>Webster Lee &quot;Webb&quot; Hubbell (born January 18, 1948) is a former United States Associate Attorney General from 1993 to 1994 who as part of the Whitewater controversy pled guilty to one count of wire fraud and one count of failing to disclose a conflict of interest, and was sentenced to 21 months in prison.

== Early life and education ==
Born and raised in Little Rock, Arkansas, Webster Hubbell was a three-sport letterman at Hall High School. He attended the University of Arkansas on a football scholarship where he played offensive tackle for the Arkansas Razorbacks. In his senior year (1968/69), the Razorbacks were SWC co-champions and beat undefeated Georgia in the Sugar Bowl. Hubbell was selected in the eighth round (197th overall) in the 1969 NFL draft by the Chicago Bears, but an injury ended his football career. He graduated from the University of Arkansas with a degree in Electrical Engineering in 1970, then graduated with a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Arkansas School of Law with honors.

==Career==
Hubbell began the practice of law with the Rose Law Firm in 1973, where in February 1977 Hillary Clinton joined him as a law partner. In September 1978 he was appointed to Little Rock&#x27;s City Board of Directors, and in 1979 he was elected Mayor of Little Rock. He served in that position until 1981. Hubbell was re-elected to the City Board of Directors in 1980 where he served until he resigned in 1984 to become the chief justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court.

After his service on the Court, he returned to the Rose Law Firm where he remained until he left for Washington, D.C. in January 1993.
Hubbell was active in community affairs including, serving as president of the Visiting Nurses Association, on the Board and Treasurer of the Arkansas Arts Center, on the board of the UAMS Foundation, and as chairman of the board of the Arkansas State Board of Bar Examiners.

=== Federal government career ===
After the 1992 election, Hubbell was one of the Clinton Administration transition&#x27;s senior officials, Counsel to the Transition Board and responsible for vetting appointments to the Cabinet and other top positions, among others George Stephanopoulos, Henry Cisneros, and Jim Woolsey, former head of the Central Intelligence Agency and Bernard W. Nussbaum, White House Counsel.

After Clinton&#x27;s inauguration, Hubbell became White House liaison to the United States Department of Justice, arriving at Justice on January 20, 1993. During the period before an Attorney General was approved, Hubbell worked as the assistant to the Attorney General, but reported to Republican appointee, Acting Attorney General Stuart M. Gerson. Clinton considered Hubbell for the Attorney General position on January 30, 1993, after Zoë Baird&#x27;s name was withdrawn, but Clinton nominated Janet Reno instead.

Hubbell was formally nominated as Associate Attorney General on April 2, 1993, and was immediately attacked for his ties to the Clintons. Hubbell&#x27;s nomination was nonetheless quickly confirmed by the U.S. Senate and he served as Associate Attorney General until April 1994. He oversaw all the civil divisions of the U.S. Department of Justice, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and was appointed by Janet Reno as the Chief Operating Officer of Department and its 100,000 employees and $10 billion budget.

==== Resignation and conviction ====
During the Whitewater controversy, Hubbell was indicted for allegedly overbilling clients while in private practice. Hubbell had previously resigned as associate attorney general on April 14, 1994, to avoid controversy regarding his work at Justice and in hopes of reaching a resolution with the Rose Law Firm. In December 1994 Hubbell pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and one count of tax fraud and on June 28, 1995, Judge George Howard sentenced Hubbell to 21 months&#x27; imprisonment. As a convicted felon, Hubbell entered Federal Correctional Institution, Cumberland in August 1995, and was released from a halfway house in February 1997.

In 1997, William Morrow &amp; Co published &quot;Friends in High Places&quot;, Hubbell&#x27;s autobiographical account of his rise in Arkansas politics and his time in the Clinton administration.

==Additional criminal charges==
During the months after Hubbell&#x27;s resignation, he entered into legal consulting contracts with several clients including the Indonesian Riady family and Revlon. This activity became the focus of another Starr investigation while Hubbell served out his sentence. Despite years of investigation, and although Independent Counsel Starr alleged that Hubbell &quot;did little or no work for the money paid by his consulting clients&quot;, Starr ultimately concluded there was insufficient evidence to prove that any legal consulting contract or payments were intended to influence Hubbell&#x27;s cooperation with investigators in the Whitewater investigation.

Starr and his prosecutors were convinced that Hubbell knew all the Clintons&#x27; secrets that were under investigation and that, if pressured enough, Hubbell would tell all. On April 30, 1998, Hubbell and his wife were indicted for conspiracy, tax evasion and mail fraud. Hubbell had, in the course of Starr&#x27;s investigation, provided documents as part of an immunity agreement with the Independent Counsel about his consulting agreements. Despite this agreement, Starr used this information to obtain an indictment of Hubbell, his wife, his accountant and his tax lawyer.

District Judge James Robertson dismissed the charges against Hubbell and his wife on July 1, 1998, ruling that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr had overstepped his authority in bringing the Hubbell indictment. Judge Robertson ruled that Starr had violated Hubbell&#x27;s Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination by building a case that relied on materials collected under an immunity agreement with Hubbell. Starr appealed to the Court of Appeals and Judge Robertson was affirmed. Starr then appealed to the United States Supreme Court. In an 8–1 decision (with Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist the lone dissenter), the Supreme Court also ruled in favor of Hubbell.

On November 14, 1998, Starr obtained a third indictment, this time alleging that Hubbell had committed fraud and given false testimony to the House Banking Committee and federal banking regulators. On June 30, 1999, the day Starr was required to step down as Independent Counsel, Hubbell entered into a plea agreement resolving the indictments. Hubbell pleaded guilty to one charge of failing to disclose a potential conflict of interest from ten years earlier. He was sentenced to one year of probation; in exchange, the prosecutor dropped charges against Hubbell&#x27;s wife, lawyer, and accountant, and Starr agreed not to bring further charges against him.

==Life after prison==
During the six years of Starr&#x27;s investigation, Hubbell worked for criminal justice think tank NCIA. Afterwards, Hubbell worked as an independent legal consultant, general counsel for an Internet start-up, and general counsel and senior vice-president for a large commercial insurance company until July 2010. After a liver transplant instigated by a rare form of hepatitis, he moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, where he now writes novels. His first novel, &quot;When Men Betray&quot;, was released in May 2014 by Beaufort Books. He has since written &quot;Ginger Snaps&quot; and &quot;A Game Of Inches,&quot; also published by Beaufort.

== Personal life ==
Hubbell and his wife, Suzy, have four children and seven grandchildren. They moved in 2010 from Washington, D.C. to Charlotte, where Suzy is a realtor/broker.

<text>Batken (also called Batkent) is a town in southwestern Kyrgyzstan, on the southern fringe of the Fergana Valley. It is the administrative seat of Batken Region. Since 2000, it is a city of regional significance, i.e. not part of a district. However, it is still the administrative seat of Batken District. Its area is , and its resident population was 27,730 in 2021 (both including the villages Bulak-Bashy, Kyzyl-Jol and Bazar-Bashy). The population of the town proper was 15,805.

==History==
The name Batkent is from the Iranian language of Sogdian and means &quot;The city of wind&quot;. Batken became the administrative headquarters of the youngest of Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s seven regions, created from the three westernmost districts of Osh Region in 1999, after concerns over radical Islamist activities in neighboring Tajikistan and Uzbekistan led to demands for a more direct and visible governmental presence in this remote and mountainous region. Batken Airport links the town with Bishkek. Since 2000, there is a small university in Batken.

The 2022 Kyrgyzstan-Tajikistan clashes has heavily damaged the town, which has been subject to shelling. Some residents returned to the city throughout the day from the villages to which they had repaired to avoid the danger of fresh shelling. In the evening, they left again. Most of the shelling and incursions by Tajik troops occurred in places right on the border. On September 16, though, the odd projectile landed on Batken too, despite it lying several kilometers from Tajikistan.

==Population==
==Climate==
Batken has a cold steppe climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSk&quot;), bordering on a Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) and a continental Mediterranean climate (&quot;Dsa&quot;). The average annual temperature in Batken is . About of precipitation falls annually.

===Early career===
During his brief playing career, Houghton was a midfielder for Fulham (1966–69) and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion (1969–70). Houghton was one of the youngest coaches ever to manage in English senior football, being appointed player-manager of Hastings United in the Southern League at only 23. During that period, he was a star pupil of coaching guru Allen Wade, who was the technical director of the Football Association between 1963 and 83. In the early 1970s Houghton also managed Maidstone United and worked as an assistant to Bobby Robson at Ipswich Town.

===Malmö FF===
He became the manager of Swedish top flight side Malmö FF in 1974. Houghton guided them to success domestically and internationally, reaching the 1979 European Cup final, losing 1–0 against Nottingham Forest. The team was all based on local players who came from within 60 km from Malmö. It was the first and so far only time a Swedish team has reached the European Cup final.

He also won the Swedish championship and Svenska Cupen several times and was runner-up in the Intercontinental Cup in 1979 as Nottingham Forest declined to participate, losing against Olimpia from Paraguay.

===Revolution in Sweden===
Houghton&#x27;s early coaching career was closely linked to that of his friend Roy Hodgson. They worked together at Maidstone, Stranraer and Bristol City. They also managed different teams in Swedish football at the same time.

Houghton moved to Sweden with Malmö in 1974 and two years later installed Hodgson at Halmstad. The pair are credited with transforming football in Sweden and bringing in zonal marking for the first time to Swedish football. Swedish teams at the time used a sweeper with 3 or 5 in defence favouring man-marking. The two were known in Sweden as English Roy and English Bob.

Besides zonal marking, the defence pressed hard and maintained a high offside line. Their teams counter-attacked with long passes played in behind the opposition defence. Instead of playing with a team that was very spread out from one end of the field to the other, with a libero who stayed in his penalty area and a centre-forward who never tracked back, they set up a system of zonal defence, a back four, people pushing up and getting the ball forward into the final area much more quickly.

===1980s and &#x27;90s===
After a short spell in Greece with Ethnikos Piraeus, Houghton returned to his homeland in 1980 to manage Bristol City. His spell at Ashton Gate Stadium was unsuccessful as the financially stricken club were relegated and Houghton resigned after a defeat to Wimbledon. Houghton&#x27;s next job was with North American Soccer League side Toronto Blizzard between 1982 and 1984. He then managed in Saudi Arabia with Al-Ittihad before returning to Sweden at Örgryte IS and Malmö FF again. After another spell with Al-Ittihad in 1993, he joined Swiss side FC Zürich in April 1994 and remained in charge for just over a year before leaving in March 1995. In 1996, he became the first ever coach of Major League Soccer side Colorado Rapids before being sacked after just one season.

===International management===

====China====
Houghton then assumed control of the Chinese national team in late 1997, who had just failed to qualify for the 1998 World Cup. Within weeks, Houghton was able to memorise the names of all his players, a rare feat in foreign coaches, and helped build the team&#x27;s confidence and self-belief. China were placed second in the Dynasty Cup very shortly after Houghton took over, and he developed a reputation for being able to implement an effective technical football program for struggling teams. They also attained a bronze medal at the 1998 Asian Games. After failing to qualify for the 2000 Olympic football tournament, Houghton left as manager of the Chinese national team in 1999. He later had several spells as a club manager in China and was also a coaching instructor.

====Uzbekistan====
He had a spell in charge of Uzbekistan in 2005 when he was charged with qualifying for the 2006 World Cup though his attempt failed after losing a controversial play-off tie against Bahrain. Uzbekistan won the first match 1–0 but FIFA declared the result void after a refereeing mistake, and Uzbekistan were eliminated on the away goals rule.

====India====
After coaching Chinese side Changsha Ginde for a few months, Houghton was then appointed head coach of India in June 2006 by the All India Football Federation. His appointment saw a general progress in India&#x27;s performances crowned by victory in the Nehru Cup in August 2007. The following year India suffered a huge loss when Maldives defeated them at the final of SAFF Championship 2008, despite a 100% record in the group stage, including a victory over the Maldives. However, Houghton led India to the AFC Challenge Cup title as they beat Tajikistan 4–1 in August 2008, which gave India a berth at the Asian cup 2011 in Doha. 
He also oversaw the Indian team to its second consecutive Nehru Cup trophy win in 2009. He resigned in 2010 after not being able to reach a new contract deal. 
He later confirmed that his contract had been renewed until 2013, but hinted that he might review his decision after the 2011 Asian Cup. 
At the Asian Cup, India, the lowest-ranked team in the tournament, lost all of their three group matches as predicted. Despite this, India&#x27;s football authorities expressed disappointment over the national team&#x27;s performance and the All India Football Federation (AIFF) technical committee urged the executive committee to sack Houghton.
On 23 April 2011, Bob Houghton tendered his immediate resignation as the India national team coach, which the AIFF accepted. Houghton&#x27;s last assignment as Indian coach was the AFC Challenge Cup 2012 qualifiers in Malaysia, where India topped Group B which included Pakistan, Chinese Taipei and Turkmenistan.

==Style of management==
In a 2012 article for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Jonathan Wilson noted that Houghton, like his compatriot Roy Hodgson, employed a zonal defence while coaching in the Allsvenskan, and that his teams pressed hard and maintained a high back-line, making use of the offside trap. They also utilised counter-attacks that were initiated with long passes played in behind the opposing defensive line. Swedish academic Tomas Peterson believed that the managers &quot;threaded together a number of principles, which could be used in a series of combinations and compositions, and moulded them into an organic totality — an indivisible project about how to play football. Every moment of the match was theorised, and placed as an object-lesson for training-teaching, and was looked at in a totality.&quot;

In an article with &quot;The Blizzard&quot;, Hodgson noted that he and Houghton were attempting to introduce a different style of defending in Swedish football, rather than elements of English football, such as the long-ball game, stating: &quot;Instead of playing with a team that was very spread out from one end of the field to the other, with a libero who stays in his penalty area and a centre-forward who never tracks back, we set up a system of zonal defence, a back four, people pushing up and, of course, getting the ball forward into the final area much more quickly.&quot; He also believed that Sven-Göran Eriksson&#x27;s tactical innovations in the Swedish game were inspired by their own work.

<doc id="1300175" wikidata="Q2622279" url="?curid=1300175" title="Jim Raynor">
<text>James Eugene Raynor is a major protagonist in Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s science fiction &quot;StarCraft&quot; series. Raynor is a predominant character in the science fiction real-time strategy video games &quot;StarCraft&quot; and &quot;&quot; and is a player character in &quot;StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty&quot;. He also appears as a playable character in the crossover multiplayer online battle arena game &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot;. Outside video games, Raynor appears in the novels &quot;Liberty&#x27;s Crusade&quot; and &quot;Queen of Blades&quot;, while his backstory is explored in the novels &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Devils&quot; and &quot;Devil&#x27;s Due&quot;. Robert Clotworthy voices the character in all video game appearances.

Created by Chris Metzen and James Phinney, Raynor is loosely based on a character of the same name in the 1991 film &quot;Rush&quot;. Metzen conceived Raynor to represent the ordinary man in a series populated with politically motivated characters. Raynor&#x27;s physical appearance was designed by Metzen himself. A Terran in his thirties, Raynor is a former soldier and outlaw who eventually becomes a marshal in a backwater colony world. Raynor joins Arcturus Mengsk&#x27;s revolution against the oppressive Terran Confederacy but becomes disillusioned with Mengsk&#x27;s genocidal tactics, forming his own paramilitary group to challenge Mengsk&#x27;s tyranny.

The character has received a positive critical response; Raynor&#x27;s depiction in &quot;StarCraft&quot; and &quot;Brood War&quot; was praised for its character depth and the quality of Clotworthy&#x27;s voice acting. One survey by GameSpot put Raynor as one of the top ten heroes in video gaming.

==Character design==
The character of Raynor was originally devised by Chris Metzen and James Phinney, with his depiction as a rough-living and dangerous man developed through various pieces of concept art by Metzen. In an interview, Raynor&#x27;s voice actor Robert Clotworthy cited one piece of this concept art in how he decided to voice the character. The art, showing Raynor on a hoverbike and outfitted with futuristic weaponry, gave Clotworthy the impression that as Raynor was someone people &quot;wouldn&#x27;t mess with&quot;, he would not have to raise his voice as &quot;other characters [would] shut up and listen&quot; or face the consequences. Clotworthy also stated that if a &quot;StarCraft&quot; film was produced, he believed Clive Owen would be the perfect choice to play Raynor due to his &quot;being dangerous&quot;.

Raynor&#x27;s character is based on a character of the same name in the film &quot;Rush&quot;, whom Chris Metzen describes as a &quot;gritty, undercover cop&quot;. Metzen also states that Raynor is a personal favorite character of his, as although he is only an ordinary man, he has personally met and worked with the most influential characters in the series. In &quot;StarCraft II&quot;, Raynor was again voiced by Robert Clotworthy.

The tactical shooter &quot;&quot; was to feature Raynor as Clotworthy stated he was brought in to voice the character; however, the game has since been canceled and Raynor&#x27;s role was never revealed. Bill Roper, Blizzard North&#x27;s former vice president, stated that the game would not center on Kerrigan or Raynor.

==Attributes==

===Personality===
Despite an often laid back and sarcastic demeanor, Raynor is described in the novel &quot;Liberty&#x27;s Crusade&quot; as a decent and honorable man who is well liked by those under his command. Robert Clotworthy noted that as such, Raynor is always willing to do the right thing, no matter how difficult it may be. His assertion to kill Sarah Kerrigan—the series&#x27; main antagonist—despite his former love for her early in the story arc is one of the sacrifices that in Clotworthy&#x27;s eyes makes Raynor a &quot;true hero in the purest sense of the word&quot;. He is also described as being fiercely loyal to his friends and his cause, willing to put it all at risk for the protection of those who cannot defend themselves. It is this loyalty that causes deep resentment in Raynor when he is betrayed by those he had once trusted. Although often displaying an overzealous attitude, Raynor is well respected by his men as a dynamic and reliable leader who always tries to ensure his troops survive the day, even when Raynor is responsible for getting them into a bad situation. Raynor himself acknowledges that he is not the most intelligent man there is, but is shown as being extremely resourceful and persistent in the face of unfavorable odds.

===Depiction===

Raynor is only ever depicted by his unit portrait through the course of &quot;StarCraft&quot; and &quot;Brood War&quot;. He is later shown in &quot;StarCraft II&quot; as a physically strong yet casually dressed character, wearing his combat gear over his normal clothes, which are further described in the novels as well-worn and rough in appearance. Raynor has a neatly trimmed moustache and beard, which by the time of &quot;StarCraft II&quot; are beginning to grey. His &quot;StarCraft II&quot; model also reveals the presence of tattoos on both his arms. In addition, a number of pieces of concept art depict Raynor smoking. Unlike other characters, Raynor is not seen wearing a uniform at any point during the series, with the rare exceptions of when he is encased in marine combat armour. Raynor is often depicted riding a modified vulture hovercycle, which he uses for transport and in open land combat.

==Appearances==

===In video games===

====&quot;StarCraft&quot;====
Raynor&#x27;s first appearance is in the 1998 title &quot;StarCraft&quot;. Raynor is a marshall on the Confederate fringe colony of Mar Sara, where he is attempting to defend the population from an expanding Zerg infestation. As the Confederacy abandons Mar Sara to its fate, Arcturus Mengsk and his rebel Sons of Korhal arrive to evacuate the colony. Thoroughly disillusioned with the Confederacy, Raynor and his colonial militia join the Sons of Korhal. During his time with the rebels, Raynor falls in love with Mengsk&#x27;s second-in-command, psychic assassin Sarah Kerrigan. However, when Mengsk uses Zerg-attracting Confederate technology to destroy the Confederate capital Tarsonis and abandons Kerrigan on Tarsonis to the Zerg, Raynor and his militia desert, hijacking Mengsk&#x27;s flagship &quot;Hyperion&quot; in the process. Raynor&#x27;s men, labelling themselves &quot;Raynor&#x27;s Raiders&quot;, take it upon themselves to strike at Mengsk, who has crowned himself emperor of the new Terran Dominion. Soon after, Raynor is lured to the planet Char by psychic dreams. He discovers the source is Kerrigan, who has been captured and infested by the Zerg. Raynor tries to save her, but to no avail; he and his men end up stranded on Char for months. Raynor discovers a Protoss force led by high templar Tassadar and the dark templar Zeratul is also on Char, likewise attracted by Kerrigan&#x27;s psychic emanations and subsequently stranded. The two groups ally and hold out against Kerrigan and the Zerg until rescue arrives with forces from the Protoss homeworld of Aiur. Raynor and his remaining Raiders accompany Tassadar back to Aiur, which has fallen prey to Zerg invasion, and help the Protoss destroy the gargantuan Zerg Overmind.

====&quot;StarCraft: Brood War&quot;====
Raynor returns in &quot;&quot;, having earned the trust of the Protoss and befriended the templar warrior Fenix. The Raiders and Fenix&#x27;s forces remain on Aiur as a rearguard while the surviving Protoss evacuate their homeworld, now devastated and overrun by the Zerg, for the dark templar world of Shakuras. Raynor is later contacted by Kerrigan, who convinces them to join with her against the United Earth Directorate (UED), which has arrived to pacify the sector by any means necessary. Raynor and Fenix reluctantly prevent Mengsk&#x27;s capture by the UED, and with Kerrigan&#x27;s Zerg rout the UED from the Dominion throne world of Korhal. However, Kerrigan turns on her allies, launching a surprise attack against both the Dominion and the Raiders. Although the &quot;Hyperion&quot; escapes the planet, Fenix is killed in the attack; an outraged Raynor vows that Kerrigan will die by his hands.

====&quot;StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty&quot;====
The 2010 sequel &quot;Wings of Liberty&quot; takes place four years later, where the Raiders are still resisting the renewed Dominion, but are low on morale and resources, while their efforts are marginalised by Dominion media. Raynor, blaming himself for Kerrigan&#x27;s transformation and Fenix&#x27;s death, has started drinking. He returns to Mar Sara, where he is approached by a former associate, Tychus Findlay, with a business proposition to acquire Xel&#x27;Naga artifacts for a research group, the Moebius Foundation. The artifacts, guarded by an extremist faction of Protoss, are also sought by Kerrigan, who launches a vast invasion of the Dominion to find them. Between missions Zeratul appears and tells Raynor that Kerrigan must survive the coming battles &quot;or all is lost&quot;, as she will be pivotal to every species surviving a coming enemy worse than even the Zerg. To prove his point he leaves a Protoss memory device, through which Raynor sees Zeratul&#x27;s journey following an ancient prophecy and the vision of an alternate timeline&#x27;s future. In this vision Kerrigan had died and the swarm (under control of an unknown entity) is wiping out the last remaining Protoss - with the Humans having already fallen and the Zerg being wiped out after their victory.

Eventually accumulating all the artifacts, the Raiders discover that the Moebius Foundation is a front for the heir apparent of the Dominion, Valerian Mengsk; though the &quot;Hyperion&quot; crew is concerned about having been working for their enemy, Valerian coaxes Raynor to accompany him in invading Char as the combined artifact may reverse Kerrigan&#x27;s infestation. Although the Dominion takes heavy losses to the Zerg, the Raiders defend the artifact from Kerrigan until it can be activated; upon detonating, it destroys all nearby Zerg and leaves Kerrigan human again. However, Findlay, acting on orders from Arcturus Mengsk, attempts to kill the weakened Kerrigan, forcing Raynor to kill Findlay before tending to Kerrigan.

====&quot;StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm&quot;====
Following the battle of Char, in &quot;Heart of the Swarm&quot;, Raynor and Kerrigan are taken to a secret lab by Valerian to evaluate the extension of Kerrigan&#x27;s current power to control the Zergs, until it is attacked by Dominion forces. Raynor is captured by Nova and Mengsk declares that he was executed, much to Kerrigan&#x27;s grief. However, Mengsk later contacts Kerrigan and reveals that Raynor is still alive and under his custody, using him as a leverage to have her keep the Zerg swarm, now reunited under her command, away from Dominion Territory. Kerrigan then manages to rescue Raynor with the Raiders&#x27; help and despite his rejection of Kerrigan at first for choosing to abandon her humanity in order to save him, he and his forces join the swarm for a final battle on Korhal to overthrow Mengsk, saving Kerrigan once more when the Emperor tries to destroy her with the artifact, ultimately leading to Mengsk&#x27;s death at her hands. Reconciled with Kerrigan, Raynor bids farewell to her as she leaves with the Zerg swarm to confront Amon, the fallen Xel&#x27;Naga which intends to return and exterminate both the Zerg and Protoss races.

====&quot;StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void&quot;====
During the events of &quot;Legacy of the Void&quot;, Raynor participates in the defense of Korhal from Amon&#x27;s forces alongside Artanis. He is later given a psionic call by Kerrigan to aid her and Artanis in a joint Terran Dominion/Zerg Swarm/Protoss invasion of the Void, a realm accessed from the Xel&#x27;Naga homeworld of Ulnar, to permanently kill Amon. In the aftermath of the war, Raynor disappears from public view with Kerrigan.

==== &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot; ====
Raynor appears as a playable character in the crossover video game &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot;, which features various characters from Blizzard&#x27;s franchises as playable heroes. He is one of many &quot;StarCraft&quot; heroes that are available in the game, and features a unique skillset including a heroic ability to summon the Hyperion to fire upon the battleground he is on. Raynor is a ranged assassin that can keep enemies away with his basic abilities. He relies on his hard-hitting physical attacks and long range to fight his enemies from a safe distance. Since he lacks any form of innate escape mechanism, like teleports or dashes, knowing when to take a fight and when to retreat is crucial to achieve good results when playing this hero. Jim Raynor is also the leading character in the game&#x27;s tutorial, and one of the six Blizzard characters who appear in the &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot; cinematic trailer.

==== &quot;Hearthstone&quot; ====
Raynor is set to appear as a card in the &quot;Warcraft&quot; spinoff game &quot;Hearthstone&quot;, in which he is a playable hero card for the Terran faction of cards in the expansion mini-set &quot;Heroes of Starcraft&quot;. He will release in the set alongside fellow Starcraft characters &quot;Artanis&quot; and &quot;Sarah Kerrigan&quot;. 

===In novels===
Several &quot;StarCraft&quot; novels also feature Raynor; he is a prominent character in &quot;Liberty&#x27;s Crusade&quot;, which reveals that Raynor had a wife and son. His son exhibited psychic potential and consequently is conscripted for the Confederate ghost program, where the intense training ultimately kills him. Afterward, Raynor&#x27;s wife Liddy dies after a period of depression and illness. As a result, Raynor immerses himself in his work and develops a penchant for operating alone. He is also the primary protagonist in &quot;Queen of Blades&quot;, a novelization of the events of &quot;StarCraft&quot;&#x27;s Episode II in which Raynor attempts to rescue Sarah Kerrigan from the Zerg on Char and eventually allies with the high templar Tassadar and renegade dark templar Zeratul, facilitating the reconciliation between the two estranged Protoss.
More recently, his early military and criminal history, including his association with Tychus Findlay, were explored in the novels Heaven&#x27;s Devils and Devil&#x27;s Due. Also in Devil&#x27;s Due, Raynor&#x27;s father died by machine error. Raynor&#x27;s mother died at day when Raynor visited her.

==Reception==
The character of Raynor was generally well received by critics and fans alike. Gaming&#x27;s Edge described Raynor as an &quot;almost prototypical action movie figure&quot; with a &quot;healthy dose of arrogance&quot; who despite always attempting to do the morally right thing invariably ends up with &quot;the worst end of the deal&quot; due to circumstances beyond his control. The article also puts forward the case that &quot;it would be difficult not to admire Raynor, if for no other reason than his persistence&quot; in the face of abandonment, isolation and betrayal. In the review of &quot;StarCraft&quot; for the magazine &quot;GamePro&quot;, the reviewer stated that he felt that the portrayal of characters was so good that he felt they &quot;were actually talking to me&quot; and expressed that he began to feel an emotional attachment to the plights of Raynor, commenting &quot;When was the last time you could say that about a character in a strategy game?&quot; A reader&#x27;s poll for GameSpot voted Raynor one of video gaming&#x27;s top ten heroes, complimenting Raynor&#x27;s character on his humanity, his resilience in the face of consistent loss, as well as his progression from backwater marshal to galactic hero. GameSpot also gave additional praise to the quality of Robert Clotworthy&#x27;s voice acting. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the 80th &quot;most memorable, influential, and badass&quot; protagonist in games, commenting: &quot;He embodies the concept of the greater good and is willing to put it all on the line to protect others. If you’re ever stuck in a sticky situation, whether it’s against a swarm of Zerg or a Protoss fleet, he’s the man you want to be fighting side by side with.&quot; In 2013, &quot;Complex&quot; ranked Raynor as the 24th greatest soldier in video games.

Raynor earned a nomination for Most Compelling Character at the second Annual Inside Gaming Awards in 2010, but lost to John Marston from the &quot;Red Dead&quot; video game series.

<text>Frederiksborg Castle () is a palatial complex in Hillerød, Denmark. It was built as a royal residence for King Christian IV of Denmark-Norway in the early 17th century, replacing an older castle acquired by Frederick II and becoming the largest Renaissance residence in Scandinavia. On three islets in the &quot;Slotssøen&quot; (castle lake), it is adjoined by a large formal garden in the Baroque style.

After a serious fire in 1859, the castle was rebuilt on the basis of old plans and paintings. Thanks to public support and the brewer J. C. Jacobsen, its apartments were fully restored and reopened to the public as the Danish Museum of National History in 1882. Open throughout the year, the museum contains the largest collection of portrait paintings in Denmark. It also provides visitors with an opportunity to visit several of the castle&#x27;s state rooms including the restored Valdemar Room and Great Hall as well as the Chapel and the Audience Chamber which were both largely spared by the fire and contain sumptuous decorations. While there was renovation, a fire truck was permanently parked in the castle.

==History==

===Origins===
The estate originally known as Hillerødsholm near Hillerød had traditionally belonged to the Gøyes, one of the noble families of Denmark. In the 1520s and 1530s, Mogens Gøye (c.1470–1544), Steward of the Realm, had been instrumental in introducing the Danish Reformation. He lived in a half-timbered building on the most northerly of three adjoining islets on the estate&#x27;s lake. The property was known as Hillerødsholm (literally islet of Hillerød). After his daughter, Birgitte, married the courtier and naval hero Herluf Trolle in 1544, the couple became its proprietors. In the 1540s, Trolle replaced the old building with a larger manor house.
In 1550, Frederick II who was king of Denmark and Norway from 1559 to 1588, concluded an exchange agreement with Herluf Trolle and his wife whereby Trolle received the manor of Skovkloster in the south of Zealand, while the king acquired the Hillerødsholm Estate. As the old building with twin towers was too small for the king, in 1560 he arranged for extensions and additions under Trolle&#x27;s supervision. At the king&#x27;s request, Trolle remained on the premises until the work was completed. The king then renamed the estate Frederiksborg (literally Frederik&#x27;s castle). Interested in deer hunting, he used the castle with the neighbouring Bath House as a royal hunting lodge, centred as it was in the fields and forests he owned in the north of Zealand. The additions included a gated wall to the south, separating the estate from the town. Still standing today is the quadrangular red-brick, tip-roofed house on Staldgade known as Herluf Trolle&#x27;s Tower (c.1560). Adjoining this are two long, narrow red-brick stable buildings: the King&#x27;s Stables to the west and the Hussars&#x27; Stables to the east. These in turn lead to a wall along the lake with two round towers completed in 1562 bearing the arms of Frederick II and his motto &quot;Mein Hoffnung zu Gott allein&quot; (My hope to God alone). On the central islet, the long pantry house with stepped gables (1575) can also be seen today. The most important building from Frederick II&#x27;s times is the Bath House in the park northwest of the islets. Completed in 1581 in the Renaissance style with three protruding step-gabled wings, it served the king as a hunting lodge during the summer months.

Frederiksborg Castle was the first Danish castle to be built inland. All previous castles had been on the coast or close to ports as the sea had traditionally been the principal means of travel. It was also the first to be built for purely recreational purposes rather than for defence. Its location in Hillerød led to the development of vastly improved roads, initially reserved for the king. Kongevej (King&#x27;s Way), linking Frederiksborg with Copenhagen, was completed in 1588. James VI of Scotland visited on 13 March 1590 after his marriage to Anne of Denmark. He gave money to the poor, to the keeper of the park who lent the couple horses, to a woman who kept pheasants and &quot;spruce fowls&quot;, and 100 Danish dalers to the Captain of Frederiksborg for his officers and servants.

===Renaissance castle===

Frederik&#x27;s son Christian, who was born there became very attached to the castle as a child. Nevertheless, when reigning as Christian IV (1588–1648) he decided to have it completely rebuilt in the Flemish and Dutch Renaissance style (Northern Mannerism). The old building was demolished in 1599 and the Flemish architect Hans van Steenwinckel the Elder was charged with planning the new building. After his death in 1601, his sons Hans and Lorenz completed the assignment. The main four-storey building with its three wings was completed around 1610 but work continued on the Chapel until 1618. The entire complex was finished around 1620, becoming the largest Renaissance building in Scandinavia. The main Renaissance building built by Christian IV was thus completed in under ten years, an astonishing accomplishment at the time, although there were additions until the early 1620s.

In 1659 during the Second Northern War, the castle was captured by the Swedes who took most of its artworks as war reparations. During the Swedish occupation, the queen of Sweden, Hedvig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp, used the palace and hunted in the woods with the English envoy to Sweden.

After Christian IV&#x27;s death in 1648, the castle was used mainly for ceremonial events. The Chapel was the scene of the coronations and anointments of all the Danish monarchs from 1671 to 1840 except for that of Christian VII. 
* 1671: Christian V and Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel
* 1700: Frederick IV and Louise of Mecklenburg-Güstrow
* 1721: Anna Sophia, consort of Frederick IV
* 1731: Christian VI and Sophia Magdalena of Brandenburg-Kulmbach
* 1747: Frederick V and Louise of Great Britain
* 1752: Juliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, consort of Frederick V
* 1815: Frederick VI and Marie of Hesse-Kassel
* 1840: Christian VIII and Caroline Amalie of Schleswig-Holstein

In July 1720, the Treaty of Frederiksborg was signed in the castle, ending the Great Northern War between Sweden and Denmark-Norway which had started in 1700.

===Fire and reconstruction===

In the 1850s, the castle was again used as a residence by King Frederick VII. While he was staying there on the night of 16 December 1859, he retired to a room on the third floor to examine his historic artifacts. But as it was a cold night, he asked for a fire to be lit in the room. Unfortunately, the chimney was under repair, causing a fire to break out. As the lake was frozen, the only water available came from the pantry and the kitchen. The fire spread quickly, ruining most of the building within a few hours although the Chapel, the Audience Chamber and the Privy Passage were not seriously damaged. The intricate internal decorations were also destroyed, but over 300 paintings were saved and are now displayed in the castle&#x27;s history museum. Reconstruction was funded by public subscription, with substantial contributions from the king and state, as well as from the prominent philanthropist J. C. Jacobsen of the Carlsberg Brewery. Jacobsen&#x27;s funding provided for the establishment of the Museum of National History in the castle. It was formally established on 5 April 1878 and opened to the public in 1882. The restoration and reconstruction work began in 1860 on the basis of old plans from the archives as well as detailed paintings and drawings by Heinrich Hansen. When work was completed under the leadership of the historicist architect Ferdinand Meldahl in 1864, the castle once again took on its original appearance. Jacobsen also donated a copy of the Neptune Fountain (the original by Adrian de Vries having been taken to Sweden) which was placed in the outer courtyard in 1888.

==Architecture==
In line with Flemish and Dutch Renaissance tradition, the quadrangular castle covering the entire area of the northern islet is built of red brick with stepped gables, towering spires and light sandstone decorations. The symmetry of the main structure is broken by the large bell tower on the Chapel Wing. All three wings are fundamentally independent buildings which have been joined together to form a complex. The usual concern with symmetry was overridden by the need to glorify Christian IV with sculptural decorations evoking astrology and mythology as can be seen in the gate house, the Terrace Wing and the Neptune Fountain. The window gables also display statues of historic emperors including Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar.

The King&#x27;s Wing, the main wing of the Renaissance building, was completed in 1604, the Chapel Wing followed in 1606 and the Princess&#x27;s Wing on the eastern side in 1608. All three were three storeys high but the Terrace Wing, completed in 1609, had only one storey. The side of the Terrace Wing next to the moat was decorated with mythological figures while open arcades overlooked the courtyard. The central portal bears the arms of King Christian and Queen Anne Catherine and its completion date, 1609.

The castle is noted for its towers and turrets. All the outer corners are decorated with towers. Two octagonal towers with lofty spires overlook the lake (Mønttårnet to the west and Jægerbakkettårnet to the east) and two round one-storey towers face the central islet. Stair turrets with copper-clad domes decorate the courtyard side of the King&#x27;s Wing. The highest and most impressive tower stands above the Chapel. The chamfered corners of its multistorey spire are decorated with four obelisks.

The Audience House (Audienshuset) was completed in 1616. With its swinging gables and protruding bay windows in the Renaissance style, the elegant five-wing building on the middle islet over the moat from the Mønttårn tower on the main building. Its south-facing portal, Møntporten, decorated with figures including Venus and Mars surrounded by musicians, is considered to be one of Denmark&#x27;s finest. In 1621, Christian IV decorated the King&#x27;s Wing with the Great Gallery overlooking the courtyard. The statues of the gods, decorating the two storeys, were crafted by Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger in Amsterdam and brought to Denmark by ship.

The middle islet was further developed during the reign of Christian IV. The lord lieutenant&#x27;s manor (Slotsherrens Hus) to the west was completed in 1611. The Chancellery to the east was erected in 1615 as a true copy of Berritsgård on the island of Lolland, one of the finest Renaissance buildings in Denmark. Both buildings were decorated with an octagonal turret and sweeping gables.

While most of the castle was destroyed by fire in 1859, the Chapel and its furnishings suffered only minor damage. The Chapel has also been used as the ceremonial chapel for the Order of the Elephant and the Order of the Dannebrog since 1693. It houses the Danish royal family&#x27;s art collection, notably works on the life of Jesus by the Danish painter Carl Heinrich Bloch. The Chapel was also the site of the signing of the Treaty of Frederiksborg. Since the times of Christian IV, it has been used as a parish church. Today it is served by four priests and two organists.

The coats-of-arms of recipients of the Order of the Elephant and of the Dannebrog are displayed on the Chapel walls. They include those of international figures such as Nelson Mandela and outstanding Danes including Niels Bohr and Mærsk McKinney Møller.

==Neptune fountain==

Designed by Adrien de Vries, the Neptune fountain is considered to be the castle&#x27;s sculptural masterpiece. It was created from 1620 to 1622 to stand on the castle&#x27;s forecourt symbolizing Denmark&#x27;s position as a leading Nordic power in the early 17th century. The large bronze figures were cast in Prague where de Vries was employed as a sculptor by the imperial palace. Symbolizing the Danish king, the sea god Neptune is the central figure, while tritons piping their seashells decorate the outer basin. The current fountain is a copy of the original which was dismantled by the Swedish troops in 1659 and taken to Sweden for war reparations following the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. The reassembled fountain now stands in the gardens of Drottningholm Palace outside Stockholm. The copy was made by Heinrich Hansen in 1888 with funding from J.C. Jacobsen.

==The Museum of National History==

The Frederiksborg Museum was founded by a royal decree on 5 April 1878 and was opened to the public on 1 February 1882. The original collection was based on the paintings which had been saved from the castle fire but, with the help of the Jacobsen fund, it was soon extended to include other cultural artefacts including paintings and furniture. Over the next thirty years, the collection was considerably extended with paintings providing a national record of the most important figures in Danish history from the Middle Ages to the present day. Today the portrait collection is the largest in Denmark. In addition to its 70 rooms in the three storeys of the King&#x27;s Wing and the Princess&#x27;s Wing, the Chapel, the Rose Room and the Audience Room are included in the museum. The museum also hosts special exhibitions. Since 2010 it has also hosted a censored international portrait exhibition.

===Valdemar Room===

The first and second storeys of the King&#x27;s Wing present the history of Denmark from the 12th to the 17th century. The Valdemar Room contains a number of history paintings which were specially commissioned for the museum, including Carl Bloch&#x27;s &quot;Christian II&#x27;s Imprisonment in Sønderborg&quot; (1871), Otto Bache&#x27;s &quot;De sammensvorene rider fra Finderup&quot; (1882) showing the conspirators riding away from Finderup near Viborg after the murder of Erik Klipping, and Laurits Tuxens 1894 work depicting Valdemar the Great and Absalon destroying Svantevit&#x27;s temple on the island of Rügen. The Valdemar Room also contains a copy of the oldest Danish flag from 1427. The original used to hang in Lübeck Cathedral in Germany, where it was destroyed by bombing in 1942. The portrait collection also contains a number of truly historic works including Karel van Mander&#x27;s paintings of Leonora Christina and Christian IV, and a number of works by Jacob Binck. The works in the east wing are mainly from the 18th and 19th centuries and include Constantin Hansen&#x27;s historic painting of the &quot;Fathers of the Danish Constitution&quot;.

===Chapel===
The chapel, consecrated in 1617, is also part of the museum. It is the best-preserved part of the Renaissance complex, having largely escaped damage in the 1859 fire. The chapel extends along the entire length of the west wing with a long nave and a two-storey gallery. The richly decorated six-vaulted stucco ceiling is borne by pillars rising from the galleries.

The pillars bear grisaille frescos of Biblical figures, painted in the 1690s. The galleries were decorated during the reign of Frederick III (1648–1670) as can be seen from his arms.

The Chapel&#x27;s most significant artifact is the organ, built by Esajas Compenius in 1610. It was installed by Compenius himself shortly before his death in Hillerød in 1617. The oldest organ in Denmark, it has 1,001 wooden pipes. Its original manually-driven bellows has been preserved. The instrument is richly decorated with ebony, ivory and silver.

The altarpiece and pulpit from the early 17th century are the work of the silversmith Jacob Mores from Hamburg. In the king&#x27;s prayer chamber adjoining the Chapel, there is a small silver altar crafted by the goldsmith Matthäus Wallbaum from Augsburg in 1600.

===Great Hall===

The Great Hall (&quot;Riddersalen&quot;) is situated above the Chapel and also extends over the length of the west wing. It was destroyed by fire in 1859, but was almost fully restored thanks to architectural paintings made by Heinrich Hansen and F.C. Lund. The restoration work, completed in 1880, was carried out by Ferdinand Meldahl who made use of preserved segments of the ornate gilded ceiling. The large chandelier in the centre of the room is the work of Meldahl&#x27;s pupil, Carl Brummer. The original tapestries depicting important events in the life of Christian IV were woven in Karel van Mander&#x27;s workshop in Delft. The copies decorating the walls of the hall today were created from Mander&#x27;s sketches.

===The Rose===
The room on the ground floor in the King&#x27;s Wing known as the Rose was originally a dining room for the king and his courtiers. It was also destroyed by the fire in 1859, but was reconstructed from old paintings. The two series of six vaults rest on free-standing pillars. It is thought Mehldahl managed to reuse parts of the window decorations including the monograms of Christian IV and Queen Catherine.

===Audience Chamber===

Extending into the middle islet, the Audience Chamber also escaped damage from the fire in 1859. It was decorated by Christian V&#x27;s master builder Lambert van Haven in the 1680s, combining the Renaissance style with Baroque. He had himself brought the paintings in adjoining Privy Passage (&quot;Conseilgangen&quot;) back from Italy. His work was completed in 1688, making the Audience Chamber the oldest preserved Baroque room in Denmark. The sumptuous ceiling in the Privy Passage with flowering vines, creepers and rosettes is the work of the stucco artists Jan Wilckens van Verelt and Christian Nerger. The Audience Chamber itself was completed in 1689. The chandelier with a carved deer was crafted around 1625 by Hans Ocksen. The chair in the north-east corner allowed the king to be lifted up from the building&#x27;s entrance. The central dome, designed by van Haven, bears the motto of Christian V, &quot;Pietate et Justitia&quot; (Piety and Justice) and is decorated with allegorical paintings of a Christian queen, a negro, a Turk, and an American Indian representing Europe, Africa, Asia and America. The paintings on the walls by the Christian V&#x27;s court painter Jacob d&#x27;Agar depict the king&#x27;s ancestors. They are surmounted by scenes from the king&#x27;s glorious Scanian War (1675–1697) painted by Claus Møinchen and Christian Morholt, despite the fact that in the end, Denmark was defeated.

==Castle parks==
In 1850, Frederick VII had a landscaped garden laid out to the north-west of the castle with winding paths, canals and artificial lakes. On Louise&#x27;s Island, named after his third wife, a small wooden manor house was built in the Norwegian style, from which the king could go out fishing and enjoy uninterrupted breaks with his wife.

To the east of the castle, the Baroque Park with its waterfalls was originally created by the court gardener Johan Cornelius Krieger for Frederick IV in the early 1720s. Its carefully planned symmetrical features were designed to surround the park&#x27;s centrepiece, a fountain from which water cascaded down the terraces to the lake below. Neatly laid out paths, shrubs and flowerbeds were arranged around the central fountain. The garden was maintained until the beginning of the 19th century when it was abandoned. The shrubs grew wild but the paths and terraces could still be seen. In 1993 it was decided to recreate the park in its original style. Now known as &quot;Kaskaderne&quot; (The Cascades), it was reopened in 1996 with a multitude of new shrubs and trees, making it Denmark&#x27;s most notable Baroque garden. Crafted in miniature hedges, the monograms of Frederick IV, Christian VI, Frederick V and Margrethe II form part of the central layout.

==Countess of Frederiksborg==
Alexandra Christina Manley was created Countess of Frederiksborg (&quot;Grevinde af Frederiksborg&quot;) by Queen Margrethe II on April 16, 2005, eight days after her divorce from Prince Joachim. The title refers to her marriage to the prince which took place in the castle&#x27;s chapel.

==Cultural references==

<text>Olyka (, ; ; ) is a rural settlement in Lutsk Raion, Volyn Oblast, western Ukraine. It is located east of Lutsk on the Putylivka Rriver. Its population is 

==History==

The village of Olyka was founded in the early Middle Ages as one of the villages belonging to the Kievan Rus&#x27;. It was first mentioned in 1149 in the &quot;Hypatian Chronicle&quot;. In the 14th century it was conquered by Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

Under the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the village grew rapidly and became a centre of local magnates, initially the family of Kiška and, after 1533, the Radziwills. In 1548 Mikolaj Radziwill the Black became Duke of Olyka. In 1569, Olyka became part of Poland after the Union of Lublin.

In the second half of the 16th century, during the Protestant Reformation, the town became one of the most important centres of Calvinism in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Its growth was halted by the Khmelnytsky Uprising of 1648, during which the town was captured by Cossacks, plundered and burnt. However, it was soon rebuilt and in 1654 it received city rights. As the main seat of one of the branches of the influential Radziwill family, Olyka became one of the most important political and trade centres of all of Volhynia.

In the Third Partition of Poland (1795), the town was annexed by the Russian Empire and became part of the Volhynian Governorate. In the 19th century, it continued to play a role as a centre of wood and grain trade. During World War I in 1915 and 1916, the area was a scene of heavy fighting between the forces of Russia and Austria-Hungary. After the Polish-Bolshevik War, the town was restored to Poland as part of Wołyń Voivodeship, and the local palace was refurbished.

Following the Polish Defensive War of 1939 and the Nazi-Soviet Alliance, the town was occupied by Soviet Union forces. After Operation Barbarossa, when Germany attacked the Soviet Union, the German occupation started and lasted until 1944. Olyka was attacked and deeply damaged by Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) forces.

After World War II the area was annexed by the Soviet Union and incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR. Since 1991 it is a part of independent Ukraine.

Until 26 January 2024, Olyka was designated urban-type settlement. On this day, a new law entered into force which abolished this status, and Olyka became a rural settlement.

==Jewish presence==
===Pre-World War II===
Jewish presence in Olyka dates back to the 16th century, and in the late 17th century the Jewish community became one of the largest in the Volhyn Region.

After the Cossack Chmielnicki Uprising of 1648, 20 out of 30 Jewish households survived. It was believed that the prayer by Rabbi David HaLevi Segal miraculously saved the Jewish and non-Jewish citizens of Olyka from the Cossacks&#x27; assault of 1651.

Olyka was the cradle of the Olyker Hasidic dynasty that was founded by the famous Rabbi &quot;Hersh Leib Landa&quot; the first Olyker rebbe. He was followed by his son Rabbi Yosef (Yoseph) Dovid, who was followed by his son Rabbi Mordechai (he authored a book called &quot;Gedulas Mordechai&quot;). He was followed by his son Rabbi Shimon Shloima (he authored a book called &quot;Shekel Hakodesh,&quot; and was father-in-law of Rabbi Yochanan Perlow of the Karliner Dynasty), who was followed by his son Rabbi Alter Yosef (Yoseph) Dovid.

In 1897 a total of 2,606 people – 50 percent of the total Olyka population – were Jews, and that amount increased when many Jewish refugees from nearby towns fled to Olyka during World War I. According to the 1921 census, the number of Jews living in Olyka had decreased to 2,086 individuals.

===The Holocaust===

Olyka&#x27;s large Jewish community was completely destroyed during the Holocaust, including Nazi persecutions at the site of the Radziwill Fortress/Olyka Castle. It is an important place of Jewish memory. Rabbi Alter Yosef Dovid Landa and his family perished.

Following the September 1939 Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact and German-Soviet Occupation of Poland, many Jewish refugees from central and western Poland settled in Olyka in the fall of 1939, as did 60 Jewish refugees from Czechoslovakia. Jewish organizations and institutions were forced to disband. After the German invasion of Ukraine in June 1941, as part of Operation Barbarossa, the German 6th Army entered Olyka, destroyed houses, killed 100 Jews, and kept the remaining Jews in an open ghetto. Around 150 Jews evacuated eastward; most Jews stayed in the ghetto. Jews and non-Jewish Ukrainians continued to trade goods and food in and around the ghetto; for example, an Olyka ghetto Jew traded his house for sixteen kilograms of rye due to famine. As part of the Einsatzgruppen Aktion of August 1941, 720 Jews, including Rabbi Alter Yosef Dovid Landa, were killed at the Olyka Castle and at the town&#x27;s Jewish cemetery towards Czemeryn.

In March 1942, Jews from surrounding villages were brought into Olyka, and a closed ghetto was created with barbed-wire fence to imprison those inside. More than 4,000 Jews were shot to death by Nazi and Ukrainian forces in the summer of 1942, in and around the Olyka ghetto, Radziwill Fortress, Olyka Castle, and surrounding areas. Monuments outside Olyka commemorate this massacre. The mass grave is located on the road to Zhornische (Żorniszcze).

Accounts vary as to the total number of Jews in and around Olyka who had died by the time the Olyka ghetto was liquidated in July/August 1942. Given the circumstances of Nazi massacres, it has been difficult to accurately count the dead. Most reports state the total amounted to 5,220 to 5,673 Jews. In early 1943, 130 remaining Jewish artisans remaining in the ghetto were shot to death. Although Olyka&#x27;s Great Synagogue was intact after the summer 1942 ghetto liquidation, it was destroyed by war&#x27;s end. Israel&#x27;s Holon Cemetery has a monument in memory of those Jews of Olyka and its surroundings, who were murdered in the Holocaust.

Fewer than 30 Jews escaped to the forest in the summer of 1942. Of those survivors, 23 men created a partisan unit with 30 Jews already outside the village. They joined the underground resistance in the region against the Nazis, and a small number survived after early 1943.

==Population==
According to the last census from 2001, there were 3,255 people living in Olyka. It is estimated 3,083 people lived there as of 2017. 
==Climate==
The climate in Olyka is cold and temperate, with significant rainfall that occurs mostly in July.

==Notable people==
* Janusz Chodnikiewicz (born 1936), film director and producer
* Henry Orenstein (born c. 1923), toymaker, poker player, author, and entrepreneur (resided in Olyka 1939–1941)
* Albrycht Stanisław Radziwiłł (1595–1656), Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth politician, Lithuanian chancellor
* Michał Kazimierz &quot;Rybeńko&quot; Radziwiłł (1702–1762), equestrian, hetman, starost

<text>Leamington Spa railway station serves the town of Leamington Spa, in Warwickshire, England. It is situated on Old Warwick Road, towards the southern edge of the town centre. It is a major stop on the Chiltern Main Line between London and Birmingham, and is the southern terminus of a branch line to Coventry.

==History==
The first station at the site, under the name &quot;Leamington&quot; was opened by the Great Western Railway (GWR) on its new main line between Birmingham, Oxford and London in 1852. It was later renamed &quot;Leamington Spa&quot; in 1913.

This was not the first station in Leamington; the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) had reached the town eight years earlier in 1844, with a branch line from Coventry. That line, however, terminated about from the town centre, at Milverton station. The opening of the GWR line compelled the LNWR to extend their Coventry branch into the centre of Leamington, and join it end-on to their new branch to Rugby, and in 1854 they opened a new station directly alongside the GWR station known as Leamington Spa (Avenue). In 1864, a connection was made between the GWR and LNWR lines at Leamington, which was mainly used to exchange goods traffic. 

James G. Batterson, the founder of American insurance giant The Travelers Companies, claimed that he first became aware of accident insurance in 1859 when he bought a railway ticket from this station to London which included accidental death insurance up to the amount of £1,000.

In the 1930s, GWR took advantage of a government loan guarantee scheme to fund improvements to their railway network; one of these improvements was the complete rebuilding between 1937 and 1939 of their station at Leamington in the then popular Art Deco style, to the designs of the GWR&#x27;s chief architect Percy Emerson Culverhouse.

The station came under the control of the Western Region of British Railways in 1948, which renamed the station &quot;Leamington Spa (General)&quot; in 1950, before reverting to &quot;Leamington Spa&quot; in 1968. In 1965, British Rail (BR) closed down the adjacent Leamington Spa (Avenue) station and the branch to Rugby; it diverted the Coventry branch into the ex-GWR station via a new connection. Prior to this, there had only been sidings connecting the Coventry line to the ex-GWR line, used for the exchange of goods wagons. BR also removed passenger services from the Coventry branch at the same time, and closed all of the intermediate stations, leaving it open for freight trains only. This lasted until 1977, when BR resumed passenger trains between Leamington and Coventry.

In 1996, Chiltern Railways took over the running of the station and the London to Birmingham services, upon the privatisation of British Rail.

In 2011, the two waiting rooms were restored and refurbished as part of £395,000 improvements that also include 80 new parking spaces at the front of the station and improved disabled access.

The station building and platform structures became grade II listed buildings in 2003.
==The station today==
===Routes===
Three lines radiate from Leamington Spa:
* one heading north-west to Birmingham by way of and , with a branch to diverging at Hatton, from Leamington;
* one going north through to ;
* one heading south-east towards , beyond which it splits into routes heading for and for , via .

===Layout===
The present Art Deco-style station, which dates from immediately prior to the Second World War having been rebuilt comprehensively between 1937 and 1939, has four platforms which are numbered one to four from south to north:
* Platforms one and four are west-facing bays, used only by local trains to and from Birmingham Snow Hill, Stratford-upon-Avon or starting or terminating at Leamington
* Platforms two and three are through platforms: platform two is used by services to Stratford-upon-Avon, Birmingham Snow Hill or Coventry, Birmingham New Street and beyond; platform three is for departures to Banbury and London Marylebone or Reading. Two central lines allow freight trains or other non-stop services to pass through the station when platforms two and three are occupied.

==Services==
The station is served by three train operating companies:

===Chiltern Railways===
Chiltern Railways services run every half hour between London Marylebone and Birmingham Moor Street (limited stop, alternate trains continue through to Birmingham Snow Hill, with 3 evening trains extending to ); further trains, at approximately two-hourly intervals, travel from here to and to Moor Street (stopping service). Until the May 2023 timetable change, a number of the Birmingham trains started from in the mornings and terminated there in the evenings, whilst a limited through service ran between Marylebone and Stratford-upon-Avon.

On Sundays, the frequency of trains is about half of that indicated above northbound to Moor Street and southbound to Marylebone, with hourly services between the two. An additional two services to Stourbridge via Birmingham Snow Hill run in the evening peak. The service starting from here to Stratford-upon-Avon remains two-hourly.

===CrossCountry===
One long-distance train per hour stops in each direction. Northbound services go to , via Coventry, , Birmingham New Street, , and ; southbound to , via Banbury, Oxford, Reading, and .

===West Midlands Railway===
West Midlands Railway operate an hourly local service to via , and . Since 2023 this service has been branded as the Elephant &amp; Bear Line.

WMR also operates an early morning service on Mondays to Saturdays to , via Birmingham Snow Hill, Birmingham Moor Street, , and at the beginning of the day and from there in the evening. An additional limited stop service terminates at Snow Hill on Saturday mornings only.


==Former motive power depots==
The London and Birmingham Railway opened a motive power depot on the west side of the line at their Milverton station in 1844. It was replaced by a larger engine shed nearby in 1881, which was known as Warwick (Milverton). This depot closed on 17 November 1958 and was demolished. Locomotives were then serviced at the former Great Western Railway depot at Leamington Spa.

The Great Western Railway opened a motive power depot on the east side of the line south of Leamington Spa General Station in 1906. This was closed by British Railways on 14 June 1965 and was demolished.

<doc id="1300182" wikidata="Q266614" url="?curid=1300182" title="Fighting of World Japan Pro Wrestling">
<text>Fighting of World Japan Pro Wrestling, also known as Fighting World of Japan Pro Wrestling and frequently shortened to World Japan or WJ was a professional wrestling promotion formed in Japan in 2002 by former New Japan Pro-Wrestling employees Riki Choshu and Katsuji Nagashima, who also served as chairmen along with Tomohiro Ishii.

==History==
===Formation===
In January 2002, New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) ace Keiji Mutoh left the promotion, jumping to rival All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) along with Satoshi Kojima and Kendo Kashin. Riki Choshu, NJPW&#x27;s head booker at the time, was blamed for their departure and removed from his position by the president Antonio Inoki in February. Furious with Inoki&#x27;s decision to do this, Choshu left the promotion altogether in May 2002 and blasted both Inoki and chairman Tatsumi Fujinami in interviews. At the same time Mutoh had left NJPW, Choshu&#x27;s longtime friend Katsuji Nagashima, who worked as a booker and head of NJPW&#x27;s advertising department, had also left the company and formed his agency, Nagashima Promotions, working with Pro Wrestling ZERO-ONE as a third party liaison to freelance wrestlers as well as a booking agency. Choshu proposed a partnership with Nagashima, and Nagashima Promotions was soon renamed &quot;The Riki Nagashima Project&quot;. Shortly after this, the two began seeking a sponsor to fund their promotion. They were backed by Seiji Fukuda, a well-known entrepreneur from Hokkaido. Fukuda joined their project as president and representative director, Nagashima became managing director, and Choshu became the director. In November, Choshu officially announced the formation of Fighting of World Japan Pro Wrestling in a press conference.

With WJ established, Choshu began seeking talent to sign to the newborn promotion. Kensuke Sasaki, a trainee of Choshu and the former ace of NJPW, had grown disillusioned with New Japan&#x27;s focus on MMA fighters over pro wrestlers and announced his departure from NJPW in October 2002 once his contract expired in January. Shiro Koshinaka, Kenzo Suzuki and referee Masao &quot;Tiger&quot; Hattori also announced they would not be renewing their contracts with New Japan in January, and the three committed to join WJ in December. Yoshiaki Yatsu (who had been Choshu&#x27;s ally in New Japan, Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance, and All Japan Pro Wrestling in the 1980s), was also brought in as the head of the sales division, along with some of the talent from his regional SPWF promotion. Choshu filled his roster with young independent stars such as Tomohiro Ishii and Takashi Uwano, freelancers such as Genichiro Tenryu, Takao Omori and Atsushi Onita, gaijin including Vader, The Road Warriors, &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams and Big Vito, and young American wrestlers such as Lex Lovett, Steve Madison, The Maximos, and The Shane Twins. Choshu himself also announced he would wrestle for the promotion, and booked himself into the main event of the first show against longtime rival Tenryu.

===Debut show and initial setbacks===
With the roster established, WJ began planning its debut show for March 2003. It had originally been planned to debut in November 2002, however, Choshu had to wait until some of his wrestlers&#x27; contracts with NJPW had expired, and as a result, WJ&#x27;s debut show, &quot;MAGMA01&quot;, was postponed many times. It eventually took place on March 1, 2003 in Yokohama Arena, running the same day that Pro Wrestling NOAH and K-1 were also promoting major events in Nippon Budokan and Ariake Coliseum, respectively. This was the only day a major arena could be booked in March, and Nagashima and Choshu could not postpone the debut any longer as they had already done so several times and lost bookings in other arenas as a result. Despite the competition, &quot;MAGMA01&quot; drew a respectable 13,000 fans to Yokohama, and the promotion soon set out on its first tour the same month. They suffered their first setback on that very tour when Choshu himself was injured during the third match of his planned six-match series with Genichiro Tenryu and forced to pull out of all events for the foreseeable future. In addition, Atsushi Onita withdrew from all future events due to commitments to his political career. WJ began pushing Kensuke Sasaki as their top star but struggled to gain a fanbase, and attendance and interest soon began to dwindle. WJ struggled to turn a profit with any shows they ran, and Choshu&#x27;s excessive spending soon became a problem; this had been a worry of investors for months, as Choshu had spent over ¥200 million ($1.8 million USD) before they had even run a show on building a dojo, a tour bus, a new car for himself, and an expensive year-end party attended by many celebrities and high profile figures.

A tournament took place in July to crown the first WMG (World Magma the Greatest) Heavyweight Champion, won by Sasaki, but did not receive the belt until weeks later due to it remaining incomplete by the supplier.

===Decline===
On July 28, 2003, MMA fighter turned pro wrestler Giant Ochiai was training under Kenzo Suzuki in the WJ dojo when he lost consciousness and eventually fell into a coma, dying of an acute subdural hematoma on August 8, 2003. Choshu, Nagashima, and Suzuki were all present in the dojo when he lost consciousness, but none of them were charged to his death. However, WJ faced severe media scrutiny for refusing to accept responsibility for the incident.

In the fallout of Ochiai&#x27;s death, Kenzo Suzuki and Yoshiaki Yatsu both left the promotion, with Yatsu, in particular, blasting Choshu in interviews with the media, famously telling Nikkan Sports &quot;Riki Choshu has no idea how independent wrestling works&quot;. WJ&#x27;s numerous financial issues also became greater and greater public knowledge around this time; Choshu&#x27;s spending had not slowed down, and he continued to make extravagant purchases with investors money, including sending ¥1 million a month to both of his daughters who were studying in the United Kingdom at the time. Numerous wrestlers began to claim they were owed money by Choshu, with Kensuke Sasaki putting up ¥5 million of his own money and canceling his life insurance to help continue to promote events. WJ&#x27;s unpaid salaries were later parodied in the promotion, with Shiro Koshinaka forming the &quot;Labour Union&quot; stable and feuding with Choshu in kayfabe over his numerous debts to them.

In a bid to recoup money and replicate the success of Pride FC and K-1, Choshu announced &quot;X1&quot; in September, a sister MMA promotion of WJ which drew some attention after they announced Katsuhiko Nakajima, then 15 years old, would debut as the youngest MMA fighter ever on the card. Despite the attention, the show was heavily panned by fans who criticized the inexperienced fighters and low level of competition. In addition to this, the cage itself began to collapse during the show and had to be held up by ringside assistants during the last fights. Choshu himself walked out of the event and refused to talk to the media before the end of the show, to the anger of Sasaki and Nagashima.

===Closure===
After the colossal failure of X1, many WJ events would be promoted and then suddenly canceled just days before; it was later revealed that Nagashima had either lied about booking the venues or not paid the money owed to hire them and when he was unable to secure them, simply canceled the events. The most infamous of these happened on October 22, 2003, when WJ had announced they were running Korakuen Hall; however, it was quickly pointed out that a boxing show was scheduled to take place in Korakuen on that day and Nagashima had once again lied about the booking.

By the end of 2003, Shiro Koshinaka and Takao Omori had both left for other organizations, and WJ&#x27;s ace Kensuke Sasaki returned to NJPW in December. The failure of WJ severely damaged the formerly close relationship between Sasaki and Choshu; Sasaki lost over ¥5 million and canceled his life insurance to fund WJ events, leading to him and his wife Akira Hokuto facing severe money issues in late 2003 and Sasaki having to work up to two independent shows a day just to support his family.

World Japan was ultimately viewed by Japanese fans as just another independent promotion in the saturated world of pro wrestling, so it was not able to make a dent in the major promotions&#x27; fanbases. It officially closed in mid-2004 and was eventually succeeded by Riki Pro, a small-time independent promotion that mainly ran in Korakuen Hall.

<doc id="1300207" wikidata="Q544525" url="?curid=1300207" title="About Time (Pennywise album)">
<text>About Time is the third studio album by American punk rock band Pennywise, released on June 13, 1995.

It is widely considered to be one of Pennywise&#x27;s best releases, and it includes their concert staples &quot;Peaceful Day&quot;, &quot;Perfect People&quot;, &quot;Every Single Day&quot;, and &quot;Same Old Story&quot;. &quot;About Time&quot; was also the first Pennywise album to chart in Billboard; the release peaked at number 96. Most of the album follows the theme of problems with time: fear of it passing, controlling it and accepting it.

&quot;About Time&quot; is the final Pennywise album to feature bass player Jason Thirsk, who committed suicide on July 29, 1996. After debating whether to break up, or to move on with a new bass player, Pennywise decided to hire a new bassist, Randy Bradbury, who would stay with the band permanently.

==Background and recording==
Frontman Jim Lindberg rejoined Pennywise in 1992, after a temporary hiatus, releasing the second album &quot;Unknown Road&quot; in 1993. Although &quot;Unknown Road&quot; failed to chart in Billboard, the band enjoyed moderate success and gained supporting slots on national and world tours with bands such as The Offspring. Due to constant touring and appearances on snowboarding and surfing videos, the album sold around 200,000 copies. In the latter part of 1994, Pennywise began writing and recording their third album, entitled &quot;About Time&quot;. They entered Total Access Recording in Redondo Beach that December and recorded their new album over a three-month period. When they were in the midst of recording &quot;About Time&quot;, Pennywise was courted by several major labels, who approached the band following the unexpected multi-platinum breakthrough success of Green Day and The Offspring, but Pennywise rejected the idea of signing to a major label and decided to stay with Epitaph.

&quot;About Time&quot; was the final Pennywise studio album to feature bassist Jason Thirsk; however, it was not their last album to contain songs written by him. Thirsk was still alive when writing for &quot;Full Circle&quot; began, and co-wrote some previously unreleased songs that would eventually appear on the band&#x27;s 2014 album &quot;Yesterdays&quot;.

==Reception==
The AllMusic review by Paul Henderson awards the album 4.5 out of 5 stars and states: &quot;The band&#x27;s fourth release in as many years finds it functioning as a full-strength unit, cranking out searing hardcore laced with positive but leery messages and ideals. While the music and message remain essentially the same as their previous releases, increasing depth and maturity begin to take hold in both these areas.&quot;

<doc id="1300222" wikidata="Q49448" url="?curid=1300222" title="Robert Nivelle">
<text>Robert Georges Nivelle (15 October 1856 – 22 March 1924) was a French artillery general officer who served in the Boxer Rebellion and the First World War. In May 1916, he succeeded Philippe Pétain as commander of the French Second Army in the Battle of Verdun, leading counter-offensives that rolled back the German forces in late 1916. During these actions he and General Charles Mangin were accused of wasting French lives. He gives his name to the Nivelle Offensive.

Following the successes at Verdun, Nivelle was promoted to commander-in-chief of the French armies on the Western Front in December 1916, largely because of his persuasiveness with French and British political leaders, aided by his fluency in English. He was responsible for the Nivelle Offensive at the Chemin des Dames, which had aroused skepticism already in its planning stages. When the costly offensive failed to achieve a breakthrough on the Western Front, a major mutiny occurred, affecting roughly half the French Army, which conducted no further major offensive action for several months. Nivelle was replaced as commander-in-chief by Philippe Pétain in May 15, 1917.

== Early life and career ==
Robert Georges Nivelle, born on 15 October 1856 in the French provincial town of Tulle in Corrèze, had a French father and an English Protestant mother. Nivelle also was a Protestant and this was a help to him as in the context of the politics of the French military Catholic piety was a handicap. He began his service in the French Army in 1878 upon graduating from the École Polytechnique. Starting as a sub-lieutenant with the French artillery, Nivelle became a colonel-of-artillery in December 1913. During that period, Nivelle served with distinction in Algeria, Tunisia and in China during the Boxer Rebellion (1898–1901).

== First World War ==
=== 1914–15 ===
Described as &quot;an articulate and immensely self-confident gunner&quot;,
Nivelle played a key role in defeating German attacks during the Alsace Offensive, the First Battle of the Marne and the First Battle of the Aisne, as a result of the intense artillery fire he organised against them. Consequently, he was promoted to the rank of general in October 1914.

=== 1916 ===

In 1916 the Battle of Verdun occurred (21 February – 18 December), during which Nivelle was a subordinate to Philippe Pétain. When Pétain was promoted to the command of the French Central Army Group, Nivelle was promoted to Pétain&#x27;s previous command of the French Second Army, which was fighting against the Germans at Verdun, and he took direct control of the army on 1 May 1916.

Nivelle is considered to have squandered the lives of his soldiers in wasteful counter-attacks during the Battle of Verdun; only one fresh reserve brigade was left with the Second Army by 12 June. After the Germans captured Fleury on 23 June, Nivelle issued an Order of the Day which ended with the now-famous line: Ils ne passeront pas! (They shall not pass!). Nivelle ordered the employment of a creeping barrage when the French made their initial counter-stroke on 24 October. The artillery supporting the infantry focused more on suppressing German troops as opposed to destroying specific objects. These tactics proved effective: French troops re-took Fleury on 24 October, as well as Fort Douaumont, whose capture by the Germans on 25 February 1916 had been highly celebrated in Germany. Nivelle&#x27;s successful counter-strokes were an important factor behind the decision to appoint him to become the commander-in-chief of the French armies on 12 December 1916. The then French Prime Minister Aristide Briand was extremely impressed by Nivelle, telling the other leaders at the Rome Conference (January 1917) that during his Verdun attacks Nivelle had sent telegrams from various places on the advance, achieving his objectives exactly according to the predicted timetable.

=== Commander-in-Chief ===
Nivelle had less power than his predecessor Joffre. He was placed under the orders of the War Minister Hubert Lyautey and, unlike Joffre, Nivelle&#x27;s authority did not extend over the Salonika front.

Nivelle&#x27;s slogan (also attributed to Petain) was: &quot;the artillery conquers; the infantry occupies&quot;. He believed that a saturation bombardment, followed by a creeping barrage and by aggressive infantry assaults, could break the enemy&#x27;s front defences and help French troops reach the German gun-line during a single attack, which would be followed by a breakthrough within two days.

Nivelle&#x27;s plan in 1917, was for the British to take over an extra 20 miles of French front to free up French troops, then Anglo-French wearing-out attacks between Arras and the Oise to keep German reserve troops occupied, then a surprise attack by French forces on the Aisne, the &quot;GAR&quot; (Army Group Reserve or Rupture: two armies in the line and another two (27 divisions) in reserve, 1.2 million men in total) to exploit the rupture of the German defences that was expected to occur as a result. The attack would be broken off if it did not &quot;rupture&quot; the German front within 48 hours.

Looking for an alternative to more months of attrition warfare, British and French political leaders supported Nivelle&#x27;s proposal.

=== Relations with the British ===
Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, commander of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front, had already agreed with Joffre that the British would launch wearing-out attacks in 1917, but demanded (6 January) written confirmation of Nivelle&#x27;s earlier assurance that if the plan did not succeed in forcing a general German withdrawal, Nivelle would take over British line to free up British reserves for his planned Flanders offensive. By Edward Spears&#x27; account Nivelle accused Haig of having &quot;une idée fixe&quot; about Flanders and of trying to &quot;hog all the blanket for himself&quot; rather than seeing the front as a whole. David Lloyd George, the British Prime Minister, backed Nivelle because he thought he had &quot;proved himself to be a Man&quot; at Verdun.

Field Marshal Haig wanted to delay his attack until May to coincide with Italian and Russian attacks, but was told to be ready no later than 1 April, and to take over French line as requested. The British government ordered him to live up to both the &quot;letter&quot; and &quot;spirit&quot; of the agreement with Nivelle, and not cause delays, almost certainly a result of private lobbying by Nivelle.

Lloyd George had a long conversation (15 February) with Major Berthier de Sauvigny, a French liaison officer in London, telling him that Haig needed to be subordinated to Nivelle for the offensive, as George Milne had been subordinated to Sarrail at Salonika, and if necessary he would be replaced. The British War Cabinet felt that the French generals and staff had shown themselves more skilled than the British in 1916, whilst politically Britain had to give wholehearted support to what would probably be the last major French effort of the war.

Haig blamed the poor state of the railways, demanding twice the railway requirements for half as many troops as the French. At the Calais Conference the railway experts were soon sent away, and although Nivelle became embarrassed when Lloyd George asked him to criticise Haig, he agreed to draw up rules for the relations between the British and French armies, to be binding also on their successors going forward. He proposed that the British forces be placed under his direct command (via a British staff at French GQG), not just for operations but even logistics and food, with Haig sidelined and forbidden even to make direct contact with London. The British CIGS Robertson lost his temper when shown the proposals, and believed that Lloyd George, not the French, had originated them. Nivelle visited the British generals next morning, and professed astonishment that they had had no prior knowledge of the plan. As a compromise Haig was given right of appeal to the War Cabinet and retained tactical control of British forces, although Lloyd George insisted – lest the conference break up without agreement - that he still be under Nivelle&#x27;s orders for the duration of the offensive.

The Germans had recently added 300 battalions to their forces by intensive mobilisation, and Haig claimed (3 March) that with the BEF spread more thinly by having taken over line to the south, these forces might be used to attack at Ypres and cut him off from the Channel Ports. Assuming Haig was inventing this threat, Nivelle wrote him a letter, addressing him as a subordinate, and revived the idea of a British staff at GQG, this time reporting to Robertson, but through whom Nivelle would issue orders to Haig. Nivelle now demanded that the BEF be split into two Army Groups or else that Haig be sacked and replaced by Gough. Nivelle also believed that Lloyd George hoped to become Allied Commander-in-Chief, a suggestion so absurd that it caused President Poincaré to laugh.

After further lobbying from Robertson and intervention by King George V, Lloyd George lost the support of the British War Cabinet and had to back down. At another conference in London (12-13 March) Lloyd George stressed that the BEF must not be &quot;mixed up with the French Army&quot;, and Haig and Nivelle met with Robertson and Lyautey to settle their differences.

=== French doubts about the Offensive ===
Between 16 March and 20 March 1917, the Germans withdrew from the Noyon salient and a smaller salient near Bapaume. The French General Franchet d&#x27;Esperey, commander of the Northern Army Group, asked Nivelle if he could attack the Germans as they withdrew. Nivelle believed that that action would disrupt his operational plan, and refused d&#x27;Esperey&#x27;s request as a result. Nivelle has since been deemed to have missed his only real opportunity to disrupt the German withdrawal.

Lyautey resigned after being shouted down in the French Chamber (15 March) and the Briand government fell (19 March). Confidence in Nivelle&#x27;s planned offensive did not improve when Paul Painlevé was appointed to become the French Minister of War, as Painlevé had little faith in Nivelle&#x27;s concepts.
The British CIGS &quot;Wully&quot; Robertson described Nivelle as a commander &quot;with a rope round his neck&quot;.

Philippe Pétain, over whose head Nivelle had been promoted to become commander-in-chief, wanted to launch a major attack against the Germans near Reims. The proposal is considered to have likely resulted in considerable difficulties for the Germans, but Nivelle refused because Petain&#x27;s offensive would delay Nivelle&#x27;s offensive for two weeks. General Micheler, commander of the French Reserve Army Group, which was to exploit the expected breakthrough on the Aisne, had serious misgivings about the upcoming battle. In a letter to Nivelle on 22 March, Micheler argued that the French might not break through as quickly as Nivelle wanted, as the Germans had reserves available, and had strengthened their defenses along a key sector of the Aisne. The other commanders of the French army groups also had concerns, but Nivelle did not make any major adjustments to his plan.

Assisted by Colonel (and former Minister of War) Adolphe Messimy, Micheler communicated his worries to Prime Minister Alexandre Ribot. On 6 April, Nivelle met with Micheler, Pétain and several politicians, including President Poincaré and Minister of War Painlevé at Compiegne. The investigation made the mistake of questioning Nivelle&#x27;s subordinates - the Army Group Commanders - in front of him.

Painlevé argued that the Russian Revolution meant that France shouldn&#x27;t expect any major help from Russia, and that the offensive should be delayed until American forces were available and could get involved. Micheler and Petain said that they doubted the French force allocated to the attack could penetrate beyond the second line of the German defences, and suggested a more limited operation. Poincaré, summing up the discussions, said that the offensive should proceed, but that it should be halted if it failed to rupture the German front. At this point, Nivelle threatened to resign if his plan was not accepted but the politicians declared their complete confidence in him.

Thus Nivelle&#x27;s plan went unchanged despite the doubts expressed by the other generals and he was under greater pressure to achieve decisive results. Prime Minister Ribot said, &quot;Our hand has been forced: It is too late to go back&quot;.

On 4 April, during a German attack south of the Aisne, the secret plans of the French assault were captured but Nivelle did not alter his course.

=== Nivelle Offensive ===
After three postponements, the Nivelle Offensive began on 16 April 1917. It started a week after British forces had attacked near Arras. Nivelle made several declarations which improved the morale of the French troops involved: &quot;L&#x27;heure venue! Confiance! Courage! Vive la France!&quot;. Edmonds claimed Nivelle said &quot;The German Army will run away; they only want to be off&quot;.

Due to the fact that the preliminary bombardment against the Germans was markedly less effective than expected, and the lack of a sufficient number of French howitzers, the desired French breakthrough was not achieved on the first day of the battle.

Crown Prince Wilhelm, in his memoirs, tells of the wonderment of the German troops at these futile but heroic attacks: &quot;The commander of a machine-gun company... described to me the overwhelming view of the battleground, on which France&#x27;s best regiments were being destroyed in continually renewed, hopeless attacks&quot;. (Griffiths, p. 39)

From 16 April to 25 April, there had been 134,000 casualties. Nivelle had said there would be about 10,000. Nivelle had promised the Government that the attack would either be a success or be stopped. But obviously he did not have the same interpretation of &#x27;success&#x27; as them; he ordered the attacks to continue. On the 19th, Minister Paul Painlevé came to see him to get the offensive stopped; but Nivelle was convinced that the attacks must continue. Gradually the whole thing had developed into the Somme-like action that all had feared. (Griffiths, p. 39)

By 20 April, the French took 20,000 prisoners and 147 guns, which was considered to be &quot;impressive results by the standards of previous years.&quot; However, a decisive breakthrough on the Aisne had not been achieved. The offensive had led to a shell shortage in France, the French medical services broke down, and the delay of transporting French wounded from the front-line was demoralising.

By the end of its first week, the attack was stalled, and Nivelle was losing control. Micheler convinced Nivelle to reduce the scope of the offensive, with the goal now only to secure all of the Chemin des Dames and push the Germans back from Reims. Nivelle became increasingly depressed over the course of the offensive as his orders were under a great degree of scrutiny by the French government. On 29 April, Nivelle&#x27;s authority was undermined by the appointment of Pétain as Chief of the General Staff, and thus the main military adviser to the government. Although the French captured parts of the Chemin des Dames on 4–5 May, this was not sufficient to &quot;repair Nivelle&#x27;s crumbling reputation.&quot;

== Dismissal ==
By the time the Nivelle offensive had ended on 9 May 1917 the French had sustained 187,000 casualties. Although this was far fewer than the casualties in the Battle of Verdun, Nivelle had predicted a great success, and the country expressed bitter disappointment.
Pétain became Commander-in-Chief in Nivelle&#x27;s place on 15 May.
In December 1917 Nivelle was transferred by the French Government to the post of Commander-in-Chief of the French Army in North Africa, an appointment which effectively removed him from direct involvement in the war. He returned to France on the war&#x27;s conclusion in November 1918, retiring from the French Army in 1921. He was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour and the Military Medal. Nivelle died on 22 March 1924, his body was buried at Les Invalides in Paris.

== Legacy ==

The British Official Historian wrote that the attempt at breakthrough had failed but that the French had gained &#x27;considerable advantages&#x27;. &quot;By the 20th of April they had in their hands over 20,000 prisoners and 147 guns; the railway from Soissons to Reims was freed, the enemy had been driven out of the Aisne valley west of the Oise—Aisne Canal; the German second position had been captured south of Juvincourt; and in Champagne some of the most important &#x27;monts&#x27; had been taken. The German counter-attacks, successful at the beginning, were becoming less and less so as time went on. In particular, a great effort made on the 19th against the Fourth Army, when three divisions were thrown in between Nauroy and Moronvilliers, failed completely.&quot;

Other historians have been less generous about Nivelle&#x27;s actions during the First World War. Julian Thompson contends that Nivelle was &quot;careless of casualties,&quot; that he was a &quot;disastrous choice to succeed Joffre as commander-in-chief,&quot;
and that the planning for the Nivelle Offensive was &quot;slapdash&quot;.
In the book &quot;World War 1: 1914–1918&quot;, the execution of the Nivelle Offensive is considered to have been &quot;murderous.&quot;
David Stevenson says that the attack on the Chemin des Dames was a &quot;disaster&quot;.

Nivelle is also considered positively in some ways. In &quot;The Macmillan Dictionary of the First World War&quot;, he is described as &quot;a competent tactician as a regimental colonel in 1914&quot;,
that his creeping barrage tactics were &quot;innovative&quot;, and that he was able to galvanize &quot;increasingly pessimistic public opinion in France&quot; in December 1916&quot;.
J Rickard believes Nivelle&#x27;s push for a greater development of the tank contributed to its improvement by 1918, and he also says that Nivelle was a &quot;gifted artilleryman&quot;.

Some historians blame the Nivelle Offensive for starting the French army mutinies of 1917. Tim Travers states that &quot;the heavy French casualties of the Nivelle offensive resulted in French army mutinies&quot;,
and David Stevenson proposes that &quot;the Nivelle offensive-or more precisely the decision to persist with it-precipitated the French mutinies of May and June [1917]&quot;.

Mount Nivelle on the Continental Divide in the Canadian Rockies was named for him in 1918; summits with the names of other French generals are nearby: Cordonnier, Foch, Joffre, and Mangin.

<text>Unknown Road is the second studio album by American punk rock band Pennywise, released on August 17, 1993, through Epitaph Records. After frontman Jim Lindberg briefly left the band during touring in support of its previous album, &quot;Pennywise&quot; (1991), Pennywise began the recording sessions for their second album. Released a year before the success of punk rock in California, &quot;Unknown Road&quot; gained Pennywise supporting slots on national and world tours with bands such as The Offspring (who was just about to hit the mainstream with then-new album &quot;Smash&quot;). Some archived footage of the &quot;Unknown Road&quot; tour dates can be seen on the band&#x27;s 1995 documentary &quot;Home Movies&quot;.

==Background and recording==
In 1989, Pennywise released the vinyl only EPs &quot;A Word from the Wise&quot; and &quot;Wildcard&quot; (which were both re-released on CD in 1992). Thanks to the success of the EPs, Epitaph Records (a label owned by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz) saw the band&#x27;s potential and signed them in 1990. In the following year, Pennywise managed to release their first album for the label, which is self-titled. The album quickly spread throughout the punk community, earning the band some nationwide recognition. Lyrics in the album endorsed a positive mental attitude, helping promote progressive ideals for Generation X. Lindberg left the band soon after the debut record. Bass player Randy Bradbury joined the lineup as Thirsk took over lead vocal duties. In 1992, The Vandals lead singer Dave Quackenbush took over on vocals for a brief stint. Bradbury left the band and Thirsk returned to bass (Bradbury would rejoin Pennywise permanently after Thirsk&#x27;s death in 1996, which retroactively made this the first album recorded with the band&#x27;s present lineup). During the 1991-1992 tour, Pennywise began writing their second album, entitled &quot;Unknown Road&quot;. After Lindberg returned to the fold in 1992, they managed to begin recording their new album at Westbeach Recorders in Hollywood, California with producer Joe Peccerillo.

==Reception==

The Allmusic review by Paul Henderson awards the album 4 out of 5 stars and states: &quot;&quot;Unknown Road&quot; is an inspired effort by the reunited and recharged Pennywise, the first consistently solid release of their career.&quot;

==Track listing==
All songs by Pennywise.
The track &quot;Slowdown&quot; is after &quot;Clear Your Head&quot; (track 13) on the original album pressing. It is its own track on the 2005 remastered edition.

The piano on the track &quot;Unknown Road&quot; is extended after the silence on the closing track, &quot;Bro Hymn Tribute&quot;, of the album &quot;Full Circle&quot;. This piano piece is taken from the 1992 movie Poison Ivy.

The tracks &quot;Homesick&quot;, “Try to Conform”, and &quot;Dying to Know&quot; were featured in the 1997 arcade game &quot;Top Skater&quot;.

==Personnel==
*Jim Lindberg – vocals
*Fletcher Dragge – guitar
*Randy Bradbury – bass
*Jason Thirsk – bass (tracks 4 and 10)
*Byron McMackin – drums
*Fred Hidalgo – album art

<text>Danny Escobedo (born c. 1937) was a Chicago petitioner in the Supreme Court case of &quot;Escobedo v. Illinois&quot;, which established a criminal suspect&#x27;s right to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning. This case was an important precedent to the famous &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot; decision.

==Case==

Escobedo&#x27;s brother-in-law Manuel was shot on the night of January 19, 1960, and Escobedo was arrested, without a warrant, at 2:30 a.m. the next day to be questioned. He was released at 5 p.m, that afternoon after Warren Wolfson, his lawyer, obtained a writ of habeas corpus, making no statement to the police. On January 30, Benedict DiGerlando, a man in police custody told the police that Escobedo had shot and killed Manuel. The police then arrested Escobedo, along with his sister, between 8 and 9 p.m. that day. He was then taken to the police headquarters and questioned without letting him speak to or even see his lawyer. During his questioning, Escobedo was tricked into saying he knew that DiGerlando had killed Manuel, making him an accomplice. He was then found guilty of first degree murder and was sentenced to jail for 20 years, with his &quot;confession&quot;, which he had later recanted.

Escobedo then petitioned to the Illinois Supreme Court (where the conviction was affirmed) and then to the US Supreme Court. The US Supreme Court agreed to hear it and the case was titled &quot;Escobedo v. Illinois&quot;. The case was heard on April 29, 1964. Barry L. Kroll argued for Escobedo with Donald M. Haskell, and James R. Thompson argued for Illinois against Escobedo, with Daniel P. Ward and Elmer C. Kissane. Bernard Weisberg argued for the American Civil Liberties Union in favor of Escobedo, with Walter T. Fisher. The case was decided on June 22, 1964.

Justice Arthur Goldberg delivered the opinion of the court, which was in favor of Escobedo. The ruling reversed Escobedo&#x27;s conviction and stated that &quot;Under the circumstances of this case, where a police investigation is no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but has begun to focus on a particular suspect in police custody who has been refused an opportunity to consult with his counsel and who has not been warned of his constitutional right to keep silent, the accused has been denied the assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments; and no statement extracted by the police during the interrogation may be used against him at a trial.&quot;

==Post trial==

Escobedo became a drifter after his case was resolved, moving from job to job. He was arrested in 2001, outside Mexico City, Mexico, for federal probation violations and on a warrant issued in Illinois in connection with a 1983 stabbing death. Escobedo had been listed by the US Marshals Service as one of its 15 Most Wanted Fugitives prior to this arrest.

<text>Tokyo Pro Wrestling is the name of two unrelated Japanese professional wrestling promotions. Despite their common name, they did not share management, promotional style, or talent in any way.

==Original Tokyo Pro Wrestling==
The original Tokyo Pro Wrestling operated from 1966 to 1967.

In mid-1966, Japan Wrestling Association president Michiharu Toyonobori resigned his position and left the promotion, taking along with him some talent, including Katsuhisa Shibata (father of current All Elite Wrestling star Katsuyori Shibata) and the future Rusher Kimura (Masao Kimura). Antonio Inoki, who was coming back from a long excursion to the United States, chose to join him and create a new venture, Tokyo Pro Wrestling.

Tokyo Pro&#x27;s biggest rising star was Inoki, who feuded with Johnny Valentine over the &quot;United States&quot; heavyweight title (as Valentine had held in California, Michigan and Ontario, he was &quot;recognized&quot; as champion by Tokyo Pro so as to lose the belt to Inoki). Inoki&#x27;s feud with Valentine cemented him not only as a rising star, but also as a tough wrestler who could take on anyone, any style, anywhere.

Nevertheless, problems between Toyonobori and his business backers led him and Isao Yoshiwara to dissolve the promotion in 1967 and replace it with Kokusai Puroresu Kaisha (International Wrestling Enterprise/International Pro Wrestling), which would promote on a larger scale in Japan and eventually become the third most important men&#x27;s promotion, after New Japan and All Japan, which would appear in 1972.

Tokyo Pro-Wrestling is also the place where Haruka Eigen, who was still active into his 60s wrestling for Pro Wrestling Noah, debuted. He joined Inoki and Shibata in going back to JWA.

==New Tokyo Pro Wrestling==
The new version of Tokyo Pro Wrestling was started by former All Japan Pro Wrestling and Super World of Sports wrestler Takashi Ishikawa in 1994, and it was one of the many independents that arose following SWS&#x27;s collapse. In 1996 they found a businessman by the name of Kotaro Ishizawa who was willing to bankroll the promotion using his bike messenger business, which enabled Ishikawa to bring foreigners, namely Abdullah the Butcher, 2 Cold Scorpio, and Sabu. It was their peak year, when they were able to hold feuds against WAR and UWFI, but economic problems relating to Kotaro Ishizawa&#x27;s business&#x27; collapse sent Tokyo Pro Wrestling on a downward spiral.

The promotion was briefly reborn as Shin (&quot;New&quot;) Tokyo Pro Wrestling but remained in an even bigger obscure status. One of its top trainees, Shigeo Okumura, ended up spending more time competing for AJPW and eventually joined it in 2000, following the Pro Wrestling Noah split.

<doc id="1300252" wikidata="Q161048" url="?curid=1300252" title="Alois Senefelder">
<text>Johann Alois Senefelder (6 November 177126 February 1834) was a German actor and playwright who invented the printing technique of lithography in the 1790s.

==Actor, playwright==
Born Aloys Johann Nepomuk Franz Senefelder in Prague, then capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia, where his actor father was appearing on stage. He was educated in Munich and won a scholarship to study law at Ingolstadt. The death of his father in 1791 forced him to leave his studies to support his mother and eight siblings, and he became an actor and wrote a successful play &quot;Connoisseur of Girls&quot;.

==Discovery, development of lithography==

Problems with the printing of his play &quot;Mathilde von Altenstein&quot; caused him to fall into debt, and unable to afford to publish a new play he had written, Senefelder experimented with a novel etching technique using a greasy, acid resistant ink as a resist on a smooth fine-grained stone of Solnhofen limestone. He then discovered that this could be extended to allow printing from the flat surface of the stone alone, the first planographic process in printing.

He joined with the André family of music publishers and gradually brought his technique into a workable form, perfecting both the chemical processes and the special form of printing press required for using the stones. He called it &quot;stone printing&quot; or &quot;chemical printing&quot;, but the French name &quot;lithography&quot; became more widely adopted. And with the composer Franz Gleißner he started a publishing firm in 1796 using lithography.

The value of the new cheap and exact reproduction process was recognized early by land surveying offices across Europe. Senefelder was appointed 1809 to be the Inspector of a new Institution set up for this purpose in Bavaria called the &quot;Lithographic Institute&quot; (Lithographische Anstalt) in Munich. Similar Institutions were subsequently set up under his supervision in Berlin, Paris, London and Vienna.

He secured patent rights across Europe and publicized his findings in 1818 in &quot;Vollstandiges Lehrbuch der Steindruckerei&quot; which was translated in 1819 into French and English. &quot;A Complete Course of Lithography&quot; combined Senefelder&#x27;s history of his own invention with a practical guide to lithography, and remained in print as recently as 1977 (Da Capo Press).

Senefelder was also able to exploit the potential of lithography as a medium for art. Unlike previous printmaking techniques, such as engraving, that required advanced craft skills, lithography facilitated greater accuracy and textural variety, because the artist could now draw directly onto the plate with familiar pens. As early as 1803 André published in London a portfolio of artists lithographs, entitled &quot;Specimens of Polyautography&quot;.

In 1837, lithography had been further developed to allow full colour printing from multiple plates, and chromolithography was the most important technique in colour printing until the introduction of process colour.

==Awards and legacy==

Senefelder was decorated by King Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria and a statue of him stands in the town of Solnhofen, where lithographic stone is still quarried. A statue of Alois Senefelder by sculptor Rudolf Pohle was erected in 1892 in what was then known as Thusneldaplatz in Berlin. The name of the square was changed to Senefelderplatz in 1894. An U-Bahn station named Senefelderplatz was opened in 1913.

Alois Senefelder&#x27;s contribution ranks alongside William Ged&#x27;s invention of stereotyping, Friedrich Koenig&#x27;s steam press and Ottmar Mergenthaler&#x27;s linotype machine in its innovative effect. It made printing more affordable and available to more people, and was important in art and newspaper printing. Senefelder lived to see his process become widely adopted both for art printmaking and as the dominant method of pictorial reproduction in the printing industry. He died in Munich, where he is buried in the Alter Südfriedhof.

Several plant taxa have been named after him as well. The genus of &quot;Senefeldera&quot; (in the Euphorbiaceae family). and of &quot;Senefelderopsis&quot; (Euphorbiaceae).

The span was converted in 1929–1930 to a vertical-lift bridge, also rather uncommon, although there are six such bridges along Ontario&#x27;s Welland Canal. It remains in operation. The bridge is owned and operated by the City of Duluth. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 22, 1973. The United States Army Corps of Engineers maintains a nearby maritime museum.

== Bridge history ==
The bridge spans the Duluth Ship Canal, which was put through the miles-long sand spit named Minnesota Point – commonly called Park Point by locals – in 1870–1871. The natural mouth of the Saint Louis River is about farther southeast, and is split between Minnesota and Wisconsin. Creating this gap in the sand spit meant that residents who lived on the new island needed to have a way to get across. Several transportation methods were tried, though they were complicated by the weather. Ferries could work in the summer, but ice caused problems in colder months. A swinging footbridge was used, but was considered rather rickety and unsafe.

In 1892, a contest was held to find a solution. The winning design came from John Low Waddell, who drew up plans for a high-rise vertical lift bridge. The city of Duluth was eager to build the bridge, which would have been about wide. However, the War Department objected to the design, and the project was canceled before it could be built. Waddell&#x27;s design went on to be built in Chicago, Illinois, as the slightly larger South Halsted Street Bridge, which was removed in 1932.

New plans were later drawn up for a structure that would ferry people from one side to the other. This type of span, known variously as an aerial transfer, ferry, or transporter bridge, was first demonstrated in Bilbao&#x27;s Vizcaya Bridge in 1893 and one in France in 1898. Duluth&#x27;s bridge was inspired by the one in France, though the actual construction is quite different. The architect was a city engineer, Thomas McGilvray.

When it was completed in 1905, the Aerial Bridge&#x27;s gondola had a capacity of 60 short tons (54 tonnes) and could carry 350 people plus wagons, streetcars, or automobiles. A trip across the canal took about one minute, and the ferry car moved across once every five minutes during busy times of the day. A growing population on Minnesota Point, a greater demand for cars, and an increase in tourism soon meant that the bridge&#x27;s capacity was being stretched to the limit.

A remodeling was planned that would remove the gondola and incorporate a lifting platform into the structure. The firm finally commissioned with designing the new bridge was the descendant of Waddell&#x27;s company. The new design, which closely resembles the 1892 concept, is attributed to C.A.P. Turner. Reconstruction began in 1929. In order to ensure that tall ships could still pass under the bridge, the top span had to be raised to accommodate the new deck when raised. The support columns on either side were also modified so that they could hold new counterweights to balance the weight of the lifting portion. The new bridge first lifted for a vessel, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers tugboat &quot;Essayons&quot;, on March 29, 1930.

The bridge can be raised to its full height of 135 feet in about a minute, and is raised about 5,000 times per year. The span is about . As ships pass, there is a customary horn-blowing sequence that is copied back. The bridge&#x27;s &quot;horn&quot; is actually made up of two Westinghouse Airbrake locomotive horns. Long-short-short is known as the Captain&#x27;s Salute and is the most common of the ship signal exchanges. However, on November 10, the anniversary of the sinking of the with all hands in Lake Superior, the Lift Bridge exchanges a special salute with the when it comes into Duluth Harbor in honor of the &quot;Fitzgerald&quot; and its crew as the &quot;Anderson&quot; was the last lake freighter to have contact with the &quot;Fitzgerald&quot; before it went down and was the first vessel on scene to search in vain for survivors. The exchange is known as the master salute consisting of the horn sequence of long-long-long-short-short.

The bridge was designated as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2017.

<text>USS &quot;Mapiro&quot; (SS-376), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the mapiro,
a fish of the Gobioidea suborder occurring off the West Indies and the Atlantic coasts of Central America and Mexico.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Mapiro&quot; was laid down by Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company at Manitowoc, Wisconsin, on 30 May 1944; launched on 9 November 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Philip H. Ross; and commissioned on 30 April 1945.

==Operational history==
Following trials on Lake Michigan, &quot;Mapiro&quot; entered a floating drydock at Lockport, Ill.; and was towed down the Chicago and Mississippi Rivers to New Orleans, La., to be readied for duty in the South Pacific. She sailed for the Canal Zone 31 May, arriving off Balboa 5 June for training. On 28 June the submarine got underway for Hawaii in company with , arriving Pearl Harbor 15 July.

&quot;Mapiro&quot; sailed for the Marianas on her first war patrol 4 August, arriving off Saipan the day Japan surrendered, 15 August. She remained on observation patrol until returning to the west coast in September, arriving at San Francisco for deactivation by 25 August.

On 16 March 1946, &quot;Mapiro&quot; decommissioned to enter the Pacific Reserve Fleet at Mare Island, Calif., 1 January 1947.

== TCG &quot;Pirireis&quot; (S-343) ==

In 1960, &quot;Mapiro&quot; was converted to a Fleet Snorkel submarine. On 18 March 1960 she was transferred on loan under the Military Assistance Program to Turkey. The Turkish Navy renamed her TCG &quot;Pirireis&quot; (S-343), after Piri Reis (ca. 1465–1554), an Ottoman admiral and cartographer. She left San Francisco on 16 May 1960 for Istanbul via the Panama Canal, with her new Turkish crew. &quot;Pirireis&quot; arrived in Gölcük on 23 June 1960. She was commissioned into Turkish Navy the day after.

The submarine was struck from the US Naval Register, and sold outright to Turkey, 1 August 1973; she was scrapped by the Turkish Navy in 1973.

In 1983, a second ex-U.S. Navy submarine, the former , was renamed TCG &quot;Pirireis&quot; (S-343) reusing the same hull number.

<text>King&#x27;s Highway 6, commonly referred to as Highway 6, is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario. It crosses a distance of between Port Dover, on the northern shore of Lake Erie, and Espanola, on the northern shore of Lake Huron, before ending at the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 17) in McKerrow.

Highway 6 was one of several routes established when Ontario first introduced a highway network on February 26, 1920, following several pioneer wagon trails. The original designation, not numbered until 1925, connected Port Dover with Owen Sound via Hamilton and Guelph. When the Department of Highways (DHO) took over the Department of Northern Development (DND) in 1937, Highway 6 was extended north through the Bruce Peninsula to Tobermory. In 1980, the entire length of Highway 68 on Manitoulin Island and north to Highway 17 became a northern extension of Highway 6. Small modifications were made to the route of Highway 6 in 1997, but it was largely untouched by provincial downloading.

Highway 6 is one of two highways in Ontario (the other being Highway 33) broken into two segments by a ferry. The &quot;Chi-Cheemaun&quot; ferry serves automobile traffic, connecting Tobermory with South Baymouth between May and October.

==Route description==
===Port Dover to Hamilton===
Highway 6 begins at Saint Patrick Street in the community of Port Dover, and stretches northward as a two-lane, undivided highway. The road travels into Haldimand County, through communities such as Jarvis and Hagersville, and the traffic flow increases. At Caledonia, the road bypasses the former Highway 6 section (Argyle Street) that passes the town centre of Caledonia and is routed outside the urban area Caledonia. This Caledonia Bypass was opened in 1983, and is a two-lane undivided freeway. The bypass terminates at Green&#x27;s Road on the north side of Caledonia and Highway 6 proceeds eastbound on Green&#x27;s Road for approximately 500 metres to Argyle St. North. Highway 6 then turns north on a four-lane undivided alignment for 5 km. Much of the old alignment north to near Rymal Road remains provincially maintained as unsigned Highway 7273. 

In Hamilton, Highway 6 now uses a new alignment from Highway 403 to south of the Hamilton Airport, connecting with the southerly leg to Caledonia and Port Dover. The new alignment opened as an undivided two-lane freeway in November 2004, with capacity to expand it to full 4-lane divided freeway, and to extend to past Caledonia, by some time in the 2010s. As Highway 6 meets Highway 403 at a trumpet interchange, and there is a concurrency for 17 kilometres within Hamilton. The concurrency ends at the &quot;Highway 6 junction&quot; directional-T interchange, at the Hamilton/Burlington boundary, near the Royal Botanical Gardens where Highway 6 turns northward towards Clappison&#x27;s Corners.

===Hamilton to Guelph===
The section of Highway 6 between Highway 403 in Hamilton and Clappison&#x27;s Corners (the intersection at Highway 5 West / Dundas Street) was converted in 2009 to a freeway with an interchange at York Road. The interchange opened on May 23, 2009, and simultaneously, the intersection where Northcliffe/Plains Road met Highway 6 was closed permanently. A new service road was built on either side to connect Plains Road and various other residential streets to the York Road interchange. Previously a four lane arterial road with a centre turning lane, it is now a fully controlled-access expressway with two southbound lanes and three northbound lanes (the extra lane being for trucks climbing the steep escarpment) as well a concrete median barrier with high mast lighting.

North of Clappison&#x27;s Corners, most of the route is four lanes for general traffic, plus one centre lane for left turns, allowing for high travel speeds as the typical flow varies between . However the section in Wellington County from Puslinch to Morriston (which is also known as Brock Road) has remained a two lane road since it runs through several small towns where it lacks sufficient right-of-way for widening. As this narrow segment suffers from significant congestion, a bypass is being considered which will connect to the Hanlon Expressway at Highway 401.

North of Morriston when Brock Road meets Highway 401 at a Parclo A2 interchange (the exits from Highway 401 are displayed as &quot;Highway 6 South&quot;), while through traffic on Brock Road continues as Wellington Road 46, the current Highway 6 designation is instead multiplexed with Highway 401 west of that junction. Although Wellington Road 46 (the previous alignment of Highway 6 prior to the opening of the Hanlon) does provide a more direct route to Guelph, the combination of Highway 401 and the Hanlon Expressway serves as an express bypass. The section where Highway 6 is concurrent with the Highway 401 freeway has the highest AADT (Annual Average Daily Traffic), at 85,000 automobiles per day in 2002. The Highway 6 routing splits from Highway 401 at a trumpet interchange with the Hanlon Expressway (the on-ramps from Highway 401 are signed as &quot;Highway 6 North&quot;). 

In Guelph, the road travels along the full length of the Hanlon Expressway (also known as the Hanlon Parkway), a four lane divided highway with mostly signalized level intersections and a couple grade-separated interchanges. The Ministry of Transportation is presently investigating the possibility of upgrading it to 400-series freeway standards by removing the remaining intersections. For 4 km Highway 6 is concurrent with Highway 7, from the Wellington Street interchange north to where the Hanlon Expressway ends at Woodlawn Road. At Woodlawn, Highway 7 turns west onto Woodlawn Road, while Highway 6 turns east onto Woodlawn Road. Following Woodlawn, Highway 6 then turns north onto Woolwich Street, leaving the city of Guelph.

===Guelph to Owen Sound===
As Highway 6 leaves Guelph and heads northwards through Wellington County, it narrows to two lanes and passes through farmland. The route meanders northward for before entering Fergus, where it meets County Road 18 and County Road 19. North of Fergus, Highway 6 winds northwest for another 17 kilometres into Arthur meeting County Road 109 (former Highway 9) just south of the town. After exiting Arthur, the route continues northwest for before entering Mount Forest and meeting an intersection with Highway 89.

The route enters Grey County as it curves and meanders northward into farmland. It progresses north for another 22 kilometres to Durham, where it intersects Highway 4. It continues for another to Chatsworth, where it meets Highway 10 and travels northward concurrent with Highway 10 for into Owen Sound. There it encounters an intersection, where Highway 10 ends; from here, Highway 26 continues runs north and then east to Collingwood and Barrie, while Ontario Highway 21 travels east and then south towards Sarnia. Highway 6 turns west onto Highway 21, forming the only wrong-way concurrency in Ontario (Highway 6 westbound traffic is labelled as going north, while Highway 21 westbound traffic is labelled as travelling south). The two routes pass through downtown Owen Sound and onwards into Springmount, where they disembark from one-another; Highway 21 continues west, while Highway 6 turns north into the Bruce Peninsula.
===Owen Sound to Tobermory===
At Springmount, Highway 6 ends its concurrency with Highway21, and continues northwards into the Bruce Peninsula. The road remains as a two-lane highway for its full length up to Tobermory. Highway6 spans across the peninsula. It passes through communities such as Shallow Lake, Hepworth, Wiarton, and Ferndale. It is named Berford Street in Wiarton, and 10th Street in Owen Sound. Along the road, Bruce Peninsula National Park can be found.
At Tobermory, the highway travels along Carlton Road and Front Street, where motorists must queue for the &quot;Chi-Cheemaun&quot; ferry to continue onwards to Manitoulin Island. The journey by ferry traverses waters of both Georgian Bay and Lake Huron, and takes approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes.
The ferry service is not available from mid-October to early May.

=== South Baymouth to McKerrow ===
The &quot;Chi-Cheemaun&quot; ferry docks at South Baymouth, and Highway6 continues as a two-lane highway. Highway6 is both the main means of connection between Manitoulin Island and the rest of Ontario and the major highway on Manitoulin Island. Highway 540 and Highway 542 on Manitoulin Island link back to Highway6. The section from South Baymouth to the Highway542 junction has the least traffic on a given day, with an average of 610vehicles passing as measured in 2010.

Highway 6 continues north, passing through communities such as Manitowaning, Sheguiandah, and Little Current. At Little Current, Highway6 crosses the North Channel by the Little Current Swing Bridge,
which swings open for 15minutes of each daylight hour in the summer to allow boats to pass through the channel. As of 2021, studies by the MTO have proposed replacing the aging structure with a two-lane crossing.

After crossing the North Channel, Highway 6 climbs through the La Cloche Mountains near Whitefish Falls. Eventually, it arrives in Baldwin, north of Espanola, ending at Highway 17 in the community of McKerrow, from South Baymouth.

==History==

===Wagon trails===
Prior to the establishment of Ontario&#x27;s provincial highway network in 1920, the route that would become Highway 6 was composed of several early wagon trails created during the early settlement of what was then known as Upper Canada. These trails carved through an otherwise barren wilderness, connecting distant townsites: the &quot;Hamilton–Dover Plank Road&quot; between Port Dover and Hamilton, the &quot;Brock Road&quot; between Hamilton and Guelph, and the Garafraxa Road between Guelph and Sydenham (renamed to Owen Sound in 1851) — were opened in the 1830s and 1840s. Further north, the &quot;Southwest Diagonal&quot; and the &quot;Centre Road&quot; were built through the Bruce Peninsula in the 1840s and 1920s, respectively.

In 1837, Charles Rankin was hired by the Canada Company to survey a line between Guelph and a new town site on the southern shore of Georgian Bay known as Sydenham. The Canada Company was formed by several British investors to purchase, open, and settle the Huron Tract, a vast wilderness stretching from Guelph north to Georgian Bay and west to Lake Huron. Rankin&#x27;s line crossed too many natural obstacles, a result of the tendency to build roads that were straight rather than following the natural topography. Consequently, a new line was surveyed in 1840 by the company&#x27;s own surveyor, John McDonald, and construction along this new route began. Around the same time, the Van Norman Company constructed a plank road between Port Dover and Hamilton known as both the Hamilton Plank Road and the Dover Road. By 1848, the Garafraxa Road between Guelph and Sydenham was completed.

The remaining section between Hamilton and Guelph, known as the Brock Road, was constructed between 1848 and 1850 over the Guelph and Dundas wagon road. The wagon road, merely a trail through the forest, was cleared by the Canada Company in the 1820s to connect the fledgling town of Guelph with the established harbour at Hamilton, thus encouraging settlers to venture inland.

Further north, the Southwest Diagonal was surveyed in 1842 by Charles Rankin to provide a short route from the Sydenham townsite to the Hepworth townsite. This route passed through a large swamp and as a result remained an unimproved one lane trail into the 1920s. The Centre Road, the spine of the Bruce Peninsula, was built by the Department of Northern Development in the early 1920s, providing access to communities north of Wiarton. The route followed a telegraph line between Lion&#x27;s Head and Tobermory and opened up a large area previously accessible only by water.

The latter two would not be incorporated into the original route of Highway 6.

===Provincial highway===

When Ontario&#x27;s Department of Public Highways first established a network of provincial highways on February 26, 1920 to be eligible for federal funding, it included the Hamilton and Dover Plank Road, the Brock Road and the Garafraxa Road.
These roads were assumed from the various counties that held jurisdiction over them – Norfolk, Haldimand, Wentworth, Wellington and Grey – throughout June, July and August 1920.

Within Wentworth County, the construction of the Clappison Cut through the Niagara Escarpment was underway by 1921, with the aim of bypassing the winding old route that is known today as Old Guelph Road. The new route, which travelled straight along the boundary between East and West Flamboro, was assumed on January12, 1921. The province and the City of Hamilton also constructed several new bridges across Cootes Paradise to create a new northwest entrance into Hamilton. The new entrance, connecting the Toronto–Hamilton Highway (later Highway2) with the incomplete route up the escarpment to Clappison&#x27;s Corners, was ceremonially opened by the Minister of Public Works and Highways, Frank Campbell Biggs, on August23, 1922.
The Clappison Cut was completed and paved in 1924.
;Clappison Cut construction, 1920–1924
Highway5 and Highway6 travelled concurrently from Highway8 (Main Street) in downtown Hamilton to Clappison&#x27;s Corners when route numbers were assigned in 1925. Highway5 was long at this time. This situation was short lived however, as Highway5 was redirected west from Clappison&#x27;s Corners to Peters Corners to meet Highway8 on May25, 1927. Highway6, in turn, assumed the route of Highway5 south to Jarvis.
The route was extended further west in 1930, when the newly-renamed Department of Highways (DHO) assumed the road from Highway8 at Peters Corners to Highway24 west of St. George, as well as the Governor&#x27;s Road between Highway24 and Highway2 at Paris. The road between Highway8 and Highway24, through Beverley and South Dumfries was designated on June18, while the section of the Governor&#x27;s Road, along the boundary between South Dumfries and Brantford Township, was designated several months later on September24.
These two segments were connected by a concurrency with Highway24.
This brought the length of the route to , including the approximately of Bloor Street and Danforth Avenue between Jane Street and Sibley Avenue, within the Toronto city limits.
 Below the escarpment, the highway followed what is now the Old Guelph Road, meandering into Hamilton.

South of Hamilton, the road to Jarvis was numbered as Highway 5 when route numbers were assigned in the middle of 1925. Highway 5 and Highway 6 travelled concurrently from downtown Hamilton to Clappison&#x27;s Corners. However, on May 25, 1927, several route numbers were revised, including Highways 5 and 6. Highway 5 was redirected west from Clappison&#x27;s Corners to Peter&#x27;s Corners to meet Highway 8. Highway 6, in turn, assumed the route of Highway 5 south to Jarvis. Exactly two weeks prior, on May 11, the Department of Public Highways had assumed the road between Jarvis and Port Dover; this also became a section of Highway 6, establishing its southern terminus for the next seven decades.

North of the escarpment to Highway 401, Highway 6 follows the same route that it did in 1920, the Brock Road. North of Highway 401, which didn&#x27;t exist before the 1950s, the route continued through Guelph along what is now Gordon Street, Norfolk Street and Woolwich Street. This section has since been replaced by the Hanlon Expressway, built throughout the 1970s.

North of Guelph to Owen Sound, the route also follows the same route as it did in 1920, with some small deviations. The section from Fergus north towards Arthur followed the route was of the old Fergus and Arthur Road Company. A &quot;cheap attempt&quot; at paving had been made in the 1920s. The section was straightened, widened and paved with asphalt-based &quot;penetration pavement&quot; in 1930.

On April 1, 1937, the Department of Northern Development was absorbed into the Department of Highways, which subsequently took over many development roads as provincial highways. Most of the northern sections of Highway 6 were included amongst these. Highway 68 was designated from Little Current north to Espanola on August 11, 1937. Two weeks later, on August 25, Highway 6 was designated in Bruce County, from Wiarton north to Tobermory. The section within Grey County was designated several months later on November 3. The lone remaining section of what would eventually become today&#x27;s Highway 6, across Manitoulin Island, was not designated until December 7, 1955. The entirety of Highway 68 eventually became part of Highway 6 in the early to mid- 1980.

===Expressways and bypasses===
;Longwoods Road extension
Under the leadership of Thomas B. McQuesten, who would soon introduce the freeway to Ontario, a new grand entrance to Hamilton was planned. It would cross the Desjardins Canal and terminate at a traffic circle, with Highway 2 continuing east and Highway 6 north. This new road, known as the Longwoods Road Extension, was built partially as a depression-relief project in the early 1930s. Upon completion in 1932, Highway 2 and Highway 6 were routed off the Old Guelph Road onto the new route into Hamilton. This configuration remained until the construction of Highway 403 during the early 1960s, which was built over the Longwoods Road Extension.

Mount Hope Bypass

Due to the narrow spacing of buildings in the village of Mount Hope, a bypass of the village was built in the mid- to late 1950s. The original route is now known as Homestead Drive. The bypass opened on April 26, 1957, at which point the old routing was decommissioned. It was subsequently bypassed, when the new Highway 6 opened to the southwest of John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport, on November 26, 2004.

Hanlon Expressway

With the rapid suburban expansion of Guelph in the 1950s and 1960s, a revised transportation plan was conceived to handle the increasing traffic load. The Guelph Area Transportation Study was completed in 1967, and recommended a new controlled-access highway to allow through-traffic on Highway 6 to bypass the city. Route planning, engineering and design began on October 2, 1967 and was subsequently completed in 1969. Construction began between Waterloo Avenue and Stone Road in 1970; this section opened on June 28, 1972. The next section, from Stone Road to Clair Road, opened in October 1973. Work on the northern section from Waterloo Avenue to Woodlawn Road began in August 1974. It and the final section south to Highway 401 were opened on November 7, 1975.

Initially, the road featured no interchanges. However, the MTO has long-intended to upgrade the route to a freeway. Construction of the Wellington Avenue interchange began in October 1998; it opened in July 2001. On April 30, 2012, construction began on the Laird Road interchange. It partially opened on the week of November 11, 2013, and was fully opened on November 29, 2013, in a public ceremony attended by local officials as well as Guelph MPP Liz Sandals.

Caledonia Bypass

In 1976, a corridor study was completed on Highway 6 between Port Dover and Hamilton, indicating a need for a bypass of Caledonia due to the aging multi-span bridge over the Grand River, to improve capacity to the developing areas of Nanticoke near Lake Erie, and to reduce the high-volume of truck traffic passing through the town. Construction began in late 1979 on structures to cross the Grand River and to carry rail lines and three crossroads over the bypass. The bypass was completed in the fall of 1983. The old route through Caledonia is now known as Argyle Street.

===Downloading and changes since===

On April 1, 1997, Highway 6 was decommissioned south of Hepworth to Highway 21. The entire length of Highway 70 was subsequently renumbered Highway 6 to rectify the discontinuity. On the same day, the section between the southern terminus at former Highway 24 to the west side of the Lynn River. These reduced the length of Highway 6 from to .

A new segment of Highway 6 was opened to the southwest of John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport in 2004. This building of this route had been planned since the construction of the Caledonia Bypass in 1983. However, concrete plans were not announced until January 1993. However, it had already drawn criticism due to an old-growth forest located in the path of the route. The planned highway would cost a projected $100 million. However, these plans never came to fruition, and by 1997 a new, shorter route was in the planning stages. Construction of the $33 million route was announced on May 26, 2000 by Transportation Minister David Turnbull, and began in July 2003.

The new route was opened on November 26, 2004. The section through Hamilton at the time followed Upper James Street through the Claremont Access onto the one-way pairings of Wellington Street and Victoria Avenue then Main Street and King Street. It turned north on Dundurn Street and crossed Cootes Paradise via York Boulevard before turning onto Plains Road and meeting the current route at the now-closed intersection. The responsibility for this routing was subsequently transferred to the City of Hamilton.

In early 2002, it was announced that the section of Highway 6 north of Hamilton, from Highway 403 north to beyond Highway 5, would be widened to a five lane freeway, with the northbound carriageway featuring an additional truck-climbing lane. This work began in 2006, widening and dividing the highway up the Clappison Cut. The York Road interchange opened on May 23, 2009, following completion of this work. The Plains Road/Northcliffe Avenue intersection was closed the night before and a new section of Plains Road opened on the same day as the interchange. The project to upgrade this segment of Highway 6 was $34 million.


== Future ==
Three sections of Highway6 are undergoing planning as of 2022.
*Highway6 South (from Upper James Street south of Mt. Hope to Highway403) is proposed four-laning around John C. Munro Airport that is undergoing preliminary design as of February17, 2022
*The Morriston Bypass (from Maddaugh Road, south of Puslinch, to Highway401 west of Morriston) is a proposed new two or four lane alignment of Highway6 currently in early works construction.
*The Hanlon Expressway Mid-Block Interchange project will result in a new interchange between Wellington County Road34 and Maltby Road, as well as the removal of the existing intersections between the Hanlon Expressway and those two roads. A design–build contract for this work was awarded in February 2022.

<text>Lene Vestergaard Hau (; born November 13, 1959) is a Danish physicist and educator. She is the Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics and of Applied Physics at Harvard University. 

In 1999, she led a Harvard University team who, by use of a Bose–Einstein condensate, succeeded in slowing a beam of light to about 17 metres per second, and, in 2001, was able to stop a beam completely. Later work based on these experiments led to the transfer of light to matter, then from matter back into light, a process with important implications for quantum encryption and quantum computing. More recent work has involved research into novel interactions between ultracold atoms and nanoscopic-scale systems. In addition to teaching physics and applied physics, she has taught Energy Science at Harvard, involving photovoltaic cells, nuclear power, batteries, and photosynthesis. In addition to her own experiments and research, she is often invited to speak at international conferences, and is involved in structuring the science policies of various institutions. She was keynote speaker at &quot;EliteForsk-konferencen 2013&quot; (&quot;Elite Research Conference&quot;) in Copenhagen, which was attended by government ministers, as well as senior science policy and research developers in Denmark.

In acknowledgment of her many achievements, &quot;Discover Magazine&quot; recognized her in 2002 as one of the 50 most important women in science.

==Early life, family and education==
Hau was born in Vejle, Denmark.

Hau earned her bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics in 1984 at the University of Aarhus in Denmark at the age of 24. Hau continued her studies there, receiving her master&#x27;s degree in physics two years later. 

For her doctoral studies in quantum theory, Hau worked on ideas similar to those involved in fibre optic cables carrying light, but her work involved strings of atoms in a silicon crystal carrying electrons. While working towards her doctorate, Hau spent seven months at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics near Geneva. She received her doctorate from the University of Aarhus in 1991 at the age of 32, but by this time her research interests had changed direction.

==Career==
In 1991 she joined the Rowland Institute for Science at Cambridge, Massachusetts as a scientific staff member, beginning to explore the possibilities of slow light and cold atoms. In 1999 at the age of 40, Hau accepted a two-year appointment as a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University. Her formalized training is in theoretical physics but her interest moved to experimental research in an effort to create a new form of matter known as a Bose–Einstein condensate. &quot;Hau applied to the National Science Foundation for funds to make a batch of this condensate but was rejected on the grounds that she was a theorist for whom such experiments would be too difficult to do.&quot; Undeterred, she gained alternative funding, and became one of the first handful of physicists to create such a condensate. In September 1999 she was appointed the Gordon Mckay Professor of Applied Physics and Professor of Physics at Harvard. She was also awarded tenure in 1999 and is now Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics and Applied Physics at Harvard. In 2001 she became the first person to stop light completely, using a Bose–Einstein condensate to achieve this. Since then she has produced copious research, and new experimental work, in electromagnetically induced transparency, various areas of quantum physics, photonics and contributed to the development of new quantum devices and novel nanoscale applications.

==Qubit transfer==
Hau and her associates at Harvard University &quot;have demonstrated exquisite control over light and matter in several experiments, but her experiment with 2 condensates is one of the most compelling&quot;. In 2006 they successfully transferred a qubit from light to a matter wave and back into light, again using Bose–Einstein condensates. Details of the experiment are discussed in the February 8, 2007, publication of the journal &quot;Nature&quot;. The experiment relies on the way that, according to quantum mechanics, atoms may behave as waves as well as particles. This enables atoms to do some counterintuitive things, such as passing through two openings at once. Within a Bose–Einstein condensate a light pulse is compressed by a factor of 50 million, without losing any of the information stored within it. In this Bose–Einstein condensate, information encoded in a light pulse can be transferred to the atom waves. Because all the atoms move coherently, the information does not dissolve into random noise. The light drives some of the cloud&#x27;s roughly 1.8 million sodium atoms to enter into &quot;quantum superposition&quot; states, with a lower-energy component that stays put and a higher-energy component that travels between the two clouds. A second &#x27;control&#x27; laser then writes the shape of the pulse into the atom waves. When this control beam is turned off and the light pulse disappears, the &#x27;matter copy&#x27; remains. Prior to this, researchers could not readily control optical information during its journey, except to amplify the signal to avoid fading. This experiment by Hau and her colleagues marked the first successful manipulation of coherent optical information. The new study is &quot;a beautiful demonstration&quot;, says Irina Novikova, a physicist at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, VA. Before this result, she says, light storage was measured in milliseconds. &quot;Here it&#x27;s fractional seconds. It&#x27;s a really dramatic time.&quot;

Of its potential, Hau said &quot;While the matter is traveling between the two Bose–Einstein condensates, we can trap it, potentially for minutes, and reshape it – change it – in whatever way we want. This novel form of quantum control could also have applications in the developing fields of quantum information processing and quantum cryptography.&quot; Of the developmental implications, &quot;This feat, the sharing around of quantum information in light-form and in not just one but two atom-forms, offers great encouragement to those who hope to develop quantum computers,&quot; said Jeremy Bloxham, dean of science in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Hau was awarded the George Ledlie Prize for this work, Harvard&#x27;s Provost Steven Hyman noting &quot;her work is path-breaking. Her research blurs the boundaries between basic and applied science, draws on the talent and people of two Schools and several departments, and provides a literally glowing example of how taking daring intellectual risks leads to profound rewards.&quot;

==Cold atoms and nanoscale systems==
In 2009 Hau and team laser-cooled clouds of one million rubidium atoms to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. They then launched this millimeter-long atomic cloud towards a suspended carbon nanotube, located some two centimeters away and charged to hundreds of volts. The results were published in 2010, heralding new interactions between cold atoms and nanoscale systems. They observed that most atoms passed by, but approximately 10 per million were inescapably attracted, causing them to dramatically accelerate both in movement and in temperature. &quot;At this point, the speeding atoms separate into an electron and an ion rotating in parallel around the nanowire, completing each orbit in just a few trillionths of a second. The electron eventually gets sucked into the nanotube via quantum tunneling, causing its companion ion to shoot away – repelled by the strong charge of the 300-volt nanotube – at a speed of roughly 26 kilometers per second, or 59,000 miles per hour.&quot; Atoms can rapidly disintegrate, without having to collide with each other in this experiment. The team is quick to note that this effect is not produced by gravity, as calculated in blackholes that exist in space, but by the high electrical charge in the nanotube. The experiment combines nanotechnology with cold atoms to demonstrate a new type of high-resolution, single-atom, chip-integrated detector that may ultimately be able to resolve fringes from the interference of matter waves. The scientists also foresee a range of single-atom, fundamental studies made possible by their setup.

<text>Patan () is the administrative seat of Patan district in the Indian state of Gujarat and is an administered municipality. It was the capital of Gujarat&#x27;s Chavda and Chaulukya dynasties in medieval times and is also known as Anhilpur-Patan to distinguish it from Prabhas Patan. During the rule of Gujarat Sultanate, it was the capital from 1407 to 1411.

Patan was established by the Chavda king Vanaraja. During the rule of several Hindu and Muslim dynasties, it thrived as a trading city and a regional capital of northern Gujarat. The city contains many Hindu and Jain temples as well as mosques, dargahs and rauzas.

It is a historical place located on the bank of the now-extinct Saraswati River. Patan has an old market which is quite sizeable and is believed to have been in continuous operation since at least the rule of Vaghelas and gandhis.

==History==
Patan was established by the Chavda ruler Vanaraja in the ninth century as &quot;Anahilapataka&quot;. During the 10th–13th centuries, the city served as the capital of the Chaulukya dynasty, who succeeded the Chavdas.

===Jain community===
Vanaraja Chavda (c. 746 CE to c. 780 CE), the most prominent ruler of the Chavda dynasty established the territory of Patan in 746 CE and built the Panchasara Parshwanath temple with main idol of Parshvanatha brought from Panchasar village.

During the rule of Chaulukya dynasty (or Solanki dynasty), Patan was a major pilgrimage centre of Jainism. There are more than 100 temples in the region. The temple was rebuilt in the 16th–17th centuries after destruction by Muslim invaders.
Patan has been home to a community of Jains for at least several hundred years. According to a 1375 CE letter written by a Jain monk:

==The modern city==

==Patola==

Patola is one of the finest hand-woven sarees produced today. This is a specialty of Patan. It is known for extremely delicate patterns woven with great precision and clarity. A patola sari takes 4 to 6 months to make, depending on how complicated the designs is and if the length is 5 or 6 metres. The saris are colored with vegetable colors. Costs start from Rs. 20,000 which may go up to Rs. 20,00,000 depending on the difficulty of work and the amount of gold threads included during the weaving process.

There are only two families making patola saris. They do not teach this art to other family members. Only their sons are eligible to learn.

Salvivad is a place where patolas are woven along with places where traditional clay toys are made. Many annual religious fairs act as tourist destinations.

It is an ancient art and needs to be preserved as well as nurtured. Local people in Gujarat praise the &quot;Patan Na patola&quot; as being the most costly item for women to afford in Gujarat.

<text>The Yangtze Delta or Yangtze River Delta (YRD, ), once known as the Shanghai Economic Zone, is a megalopolis generally comprising the Wu-speaking areas of Shanghai, southern Jiangsu, northern Zhejiang, southern Anhui. The area lies in the heart of the Jiangnan region (literally, &quot;south of the Yangtze&quot;), where the Yangtze drains into the East China Sea. Historically the fertile delta fed much of China’s population, and cities and commerce flourished. Today, it is one of China’s most important metropolitan areas and is home to China’s financial center, as well as a tourist destination and hub for manufacture ranging from textile to car-making. In 2021, the Yangtze Delta had a GDP of approximately US$4.3 trillion, about the same size as Japan.
The urban build-up in the area has given rise to what may be the largest concentration of adjacent metropolitan areas in the world. It covers an area of around and is home to over 240 million people. With about a sixth of China&#x27;s population and a fourth of the country&#x27;s GDP, the YRD is one of the fastest growing and richest regions in East Asia.

==History==

The Neolithic Liangzhu culture was based in this region, and in the Eastern Zhou period it was home to the powerful states of Wu, based in Suzhou, and Yue, based in the Shaoxing area. Nanjing first served as a capital in the Three Kingdoms period as the capital of Eastern Wu (AD 229–280). In the fourth century CE the Eastern Jin dynasty (AD 317–420) moved its capital here after losing control of the north and its capital Jiankang (present-day Nanjing) became a major cultural, economic, and political centre. During the mid to late period of the Tang dynasty (618-907), the region emerged as an economic centre, and the Yangtze Delta became the most important agricultural, handicraft industrial and economic centre for the late Tang dynasty.

Hangzhou served as the Chinese capital during the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279). Then called Lin&#x27;an, it became the biggest city in East Asia with a population more than 1.5 million, and one of the most prosperous cities in the world, which it remained after the Mongol conquest. At the same time, Ningbo became one of the two biggest seaports in East Asia along with Quanzhou (in Fujian province). Nanjing was the early capital of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) and the region remained the most important economic region of the empire even after the Yongle Emperor moved the capital to Beijing in 1421.

During the mid-late Ming dynasty (1368–1644), the first bud of capitalism of East Asia was born and developed in this area, although it was disrupted by the Manchu invasion and controlled strictly and carefully by the Confucian central government in Beijing, it continued its development slowly throughout the rest of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911). During the Ming and Qing dynasties, the delta became a large economic centre for the country, and also played the most important role in agriculture and handicraft industry.

During the Qianlong era (1735-1796) of the Qing dynasty, Shanghai began developing rapidly and became the largest port in the Far East. From late 19th century to early 20th century, Shanghai was the biggest commercial centre in the Far East. The Yangtze Delta became the first industrialized area in China. In the middle and late feudal society of China, the Yangtze River Delta region initially formed a considerable urban agglomeration.

After the Chinese economic reform program, which began in 1978, Shanghai again became the most important economic centre in mainland China, and is emerging to become one of Asia&#x27;s centres for commerce. In modern times, the Yangtze Delta metropolitan region is centred at Shanghai, and also flanked by the major metropolitan areas of Hangzhou, Suzhou, Ningbo, and Nanjing, home to nearly 105 million people (of which an estimated 80 million are urban residents). It is the centre of Chinese economic development, and surpasses other concentrations of metropolitan areas (including the Pearl Delta) in China in terms of economic growth, productivity and per capita income.

In 1982, the Chinese government set up the Shanghai Economic Area. Besides Shanghai, four cities in Jiangsu (Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Nantong) and five cities in Zhejiang (Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Shaoxing, Huzhou, Ningbo) were included. In 1992, a 14-city cooperative joint meeting was launched. Besides the previous 10 cities, the members included Nanjing, Zhenjiang and Yangzhou in Jiangsu, and Zhoushan in Zhejiang. In 1997, the regular joint meeting resulted in the establishment of the Yangtze Delta Economic Coordination Association, which included a new member Taizhou in Jiangsu in that year. In 1997, Taizhou in Zhejiang also joined the association. In 2003, the association accepted six new members after a six-year observation and review, including Yancheng and Huai&#x27;an in Jiangsu, Jinhua and Quzhou in Zhejiang, and Ma&#x27;anshan and Hefei in Anhui. In 2019, the area expanded to include the entirety of Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai.

==Demographics==
The delta is one of the most densely populated regions on earth, and includes one of the world&#x27;s largest cities on its banks — Shanghai, with a density of . Because of the large population of the delta, and factories, farms, and other cities upriver, the World Wide Fund for Nature says the Yangtze Delta is the biggest cause of marine pollution in the Pacific Ocean.

Most of the people in this region speak Wu Chinese (sometimes called Shanghainese, although Shanghainese is actually one of the dialects within the Wu group of Chinese) as their mother tongue, in addition to Mandarin. Wu is mutually unintelligible with other varieties of Chinese, including Mandarin.

==Geography==
===Metropolitan areas===
===Cities===

Central areas include Shanghai, Nanjing, Jiujiang, Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, Nantong, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, Yancheng, Taizhou (Jiangsu), Hangzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Huzhou, Jiaxing, Shaoxing, Jinhua, Zhoushan, Taizhou (Zhejiang), Hefei, Wuhu, Maanshan, Tongling, Anqing, Chuzhou, Chizhou, Xuancheng.

==Geology==
===Coastal erosion===
The Three Gorge Dam has huge impacts on both upstream and downstream. Since 2003, the Yangtze River delta front has experienced severe erosion and significant sediment coarsening.

===Subaqueous delta===
The Yangtze River derived sediment has not really dispersed across the East China Sea continental shelf, instead, an elongated (~800 km) distal subaqueous mud wedge (up to 60 m thick) extending from the Yangtze River mouth southward off the Zhejiang and Fujian coasts into the Taiwan Strait.

==Culture==
The Yangtze River Delta is both a geographical and a socio-economic region, characterised by shared or similar cultural traditions and historical experiences. Distinct regional cultures, such as Hui, Huaiyang, Wuyue, Shanghai-style, and Chu-Han, each retain their own identities while also influencing and merging with one another, contributing to the diverse culture of the Delta. The region’s rich cultural heritage has played a role in supporting its economic development, helping it become one of China’s most economically dynamic areas, with high levels of openness and innovation.

==Economy==
The area of the Yangtze Delta incorporates more than twenty relatively developed cities in three provinces. The term can be generally used to refer to the entire region extending as far north as Lianyungang, Jiangsu and as far south as Wenzhou, Zhejiang. 

===Fishing and agriculture===
The Yangtze Delta contains the most fertile soils in all of China. Rice is the dominant crop of the delta, but further inland fishing rivals it. In Qing Pu, 50 ponds, containing five different species of fish, produce 29,000 tons of fish each year. One of the biggest fears of fish farmers in this region is that toxic water will seep into their man-made lagoons and threaten their livelihood.

==Governance==
Yangtze Delta regional cooperation requires effort from governments of Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui and Jiangxi.

They&#x27;ve gradually established a three-tier model of governance on increased regional cooperation:

*Leadership: Symposium of Governors of YRD Area (长三角地区主要领导座谈会)
*Coordination: Joint Conference on Cooperation and Development of YRD Area (长三角地区合作与发展联席会议)
*Operation: 
**Offices of the Joint Conference (联席会议办公室)
**Office of YRD Regional Cooperation (长三角区域合作办公室)
***Specialized Task Forces (专题合作组)

There is also a conference with longer history for economical cooperation:
* Coordinative Conference on Economy for Cities in YRD (长三角城市经济协调会, since 1992)
** Joint Conference of Mayors (市长联席会议)
** Office of the Coordination Society (协调会办公室)

===Plans===
*Outline of the Regional Integration Development Plan of the Yangtze River Delta

==Transportation==

The region has a well-developed transport infrastructure, with one of the highest rates of private vehicle ownership in China. Traffic regulations in Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Zhejiang are also comparatively stricter than in other parts of the country. Major shipping and trade hubs, such as the Port of Shanghai and the Port of Ningbo-Zhoushan, are located here; these ports are the largest in the world for container and cargo handling, respectively. The area is also home to the Hangzhou Bay Bridge, the world’s longest cross-sea bridge at 36 km, and has the densest network of rapid transit railways, spanning 12 lines.

==Climate==
The Yangtze Delta has a marine monsoon subtropical climate, with hot and humid summers, cool and dry winters, and warm spring and fall. Winter temperatures can drop as low as -10 °C (a record), however, and even in springtime, large temperature fluctuations can occur.

{{lang|fr|Recherche, Assistance, Intervention, Dissuasion}} (&quot;Search, Assistance, Intervention, Deterrence&quot;), commonly abbreviated RAID ({{IPAc-en|r|eɪ|d}}; French: {{IPA|fr|ʁɛd||RAID_1.ogg|pronunciation}}), is an elite tactical unit of the French National Police. Founded in 1985, it is headquartered in Bièvres, Essonne, approximately 20 kilometres (12 miles) southwest of Paris. RAID is the National Police counterpart of the National Gendarmerie&#x27;s GIGN. Both units share responsibility for the French territory.

Since 2009, RAID and the Paris Search and Intervention Brigade (BRI), a separate National Police unit reporting directly into the Paris Police Prefecture ({{langx|fr|Préfecture de police de Paris}}), have formed a task force called National Police Intervention Force ({{langx|fr| Force d&#x27;intervention de la Police nationale}}) or FIPN. When activated, the task force is headed by the RAID commander. Thirteen regional units of the National Police, previously known as National Police Intervention Groups (GIPNs), have been created or permanently integrated into RAID and re-designated as &quot;RAID branches&quot; ({{langx|fr| antennes RAID}}) between 2015 and 2019.

==Missions==

Among the main missions of RAID are:
* Counter-terrorism in coordination with UCLAT, the co-ordination unit for the fight against terrorism ({{langx|fr|Unité de coordination de la lutte anti-terroriste}}).
* Hostage recovery situations
* Close protection of VIPs
* Protection of some of the French embassies in war-torn countries (a mission shared with the Gendarmerie&#x27;s GIGN)
* Site protection during special events
* Resolution of prison riots
* Assistance to other police departments fighting against organized crime 
* Surveillance and arrest of high-profile criminals
* Arrest of dangerous deranged persons
* Training and assistance to foreign police forces
* Assessment of new equipment and techniques.

RAID reports to the director general of the National Police (DGPN), himself a direct report of the minister of the interior.

==History==
Before the creation of RAID, the National Police did not have a national unit comparable to the Gendarmerie&#x27;s GIGN and relied instead on regional units: BRI in Paris and the GIPNs in the provinces. Minister of the Interior Pierre Joxe was the key decision maker who authorized the creation of the unit. RAID was founded by then-commissaires Robert Broussard and Ange Mancini in 1985. Broussard, one of the best known Police commissaires at the time, was one of the advisers who pushed the project. Mancini was chosen to be the unit&#x27;s first commander. RAID&#x27;s first mission - a hostage situation in a Nantes tribunal, took place soon afterwards in December 1985.

In 1987 RAID arrested the leaders of the terrorist group Action Directe in their Vitry-aux-Loges hideout. In May 1993, RAID solved a delicate hostage situation when a man named Erick Schmitt, calling himself &quot;HB&quot; (for &quot;Human Bomb&quot;, in English), and carrying large quantities of explosives, took 21 hostages in a Neuilly-sur-Seine nursery school. The hostage taker was finally shot and the children were recovered safely, together with their teacher and a nurse. In 1996, in Roubaix, the unit neutralized the Gang de Roubaix, a 14-member terrorist group tied to the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria (GIA), suspected of several bank robberies, murders, and a failed attack against the Group of Seven (G7) meeting in Lille. The assault was very violent and resulted in the death of four terrorists. Two RAID operatives were also injured, one by a grenade blast, the other hit by a bullet in a lung. Christophe Caze, the head of the group, escaped the burning building, but was killed at a Belgian checkpoint during a gunfight with Customs agents. Several days later, thanks to an electronic device found on Caze&#x27;s body, Fateh Kamel, head of a terrorist cell in Montreal, was arrested in Jordan and tried in France.

RAID operators saw action during the 2005 and 2006 riots in France, as well as in a hostage situation in Versailles, where an armed man was shot dead by RAID operators after coming under attack. On 21 and 22 March 2012, RAID was tasked to arrest Mohammed Merah, the main suspect for shooting sprees in Toulouse and Montauban. RAID surrounded the flat where Merah was entrenched. After 30 hours of siege, RAID stormed the flat to apprehend Merah who fought back. After a four-minute shoot out, Merah was shot by a RAID sniper while exiting the building.

On 9 January 2015 RAID, together with BRI, a unit of the Paris Metropolitan Police, ended the hostage situation at the kosher supermarket &quot;Hypercacher&quot; on the third day of the January 2015 Paris terrorist attacks. On 14 November 2015 RAID, again with the Paris BRI, took part in operations at the Bataclan theatre, where 90 people were killed during a series of bombings, shootings and hostage taking in Paris on 13 – 14 November. On 18 November RAID undertook a follow-up operation in Saint-Denis seeking Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the &#x27;mastermind&#x27; of the attacks, who was killed.

RAID also provides close protection for foreign dignitaries traveling in France. During special events, RAID is also in charge of protecting French individuals abroad (For example, the French Delegation during the Olympic Games is under RAID protection during the whole event).

Three RAID officers have been killed in action: two in Ris-Orangis (near Paris) in 1989 and one in Corsica in 1996.

RAID has a total strength of around 450 men and women, approx. 180 of which are in Bièvres, the rest in the regional branches located in Bordeaux, Guadeloupe, Lille, Lyon, Marseille, Montpellier, Nancy, New Caledonia, Nice, Rennes, Réunion, Strasbourg and Toulouse.{{cn|date=February 2025}} The Bièvres (Paris) unit is divided into three main sections with about 60 members each:{{cn|date=February 2025}}

* First Section: The first section deals with the usual tasks of special forces: intervention, monitoring, protection.{{cn|date=February 2025}}
* Second Section: The second section is the Research and Development unit of the RAID. It studies techniques and collects information. This section is divided into three groups:{{cn|date=February 2025}}
:*Intelligence Group{{cn|date=February 2025}}
:*Technical Group{{cn|date=February 2025}}
:*Weaponry Group{{cn|date=February 2025}}
* Third section: The Third section deals with the psychological aspects of the interventions. It is in charge of negotiations and crisis management. It also provides psychological support for the policemen in the unit and in the whole French Police. It is composed of forensic experts, a psychologist and physicians.{{cn|date=February 2025}}

The Negotiation group is on permanent alert.{{cn|date=February 2025}} It deals with suicides, violent crises, mental disorders, hostage crises and other major troubles, independently from the rest of the RAID.{{cn|date=February 2025}} It assesses the dangers of the situation, suggests possible solutions, and helps with the negotiations and the resolution of the crises. If the whole RAID has to intervene, the Negotiations section is used as a reconnaissance unit, and prepares the intervention of the other sections.{{cn|date=February 2025}} To join the unit, an officer needs five years duty within the Police Nationale and after passing a thorough test he will serve in the RAID for five years{{cn|date=February 2025}}. With a commendation he can expand it further five years.{{cn|date=February 2025}} All members must leave the tactical unit after ten years.{{cn|date=February 2025}} Candidates must be under forty to apply.{{cn|date=February 2025}} Female officers are admitted in almost all positions.{{cn|date=February 2025}}

Helicopter support is provided by Sécurité Civile and the National Gendarmerie.{{cn|date=February 2025}} Tactical deployment of large groups is handled by GIH ({{langx|fr|Groupe interarmées d&#x27;hélicoptères}}) a joint army/air force special operations flight equipped with SA330 PUMA helicopters based in nearby Villacoublay air base.{{cn|date=February 2025}} GIH was established in 2006, initially to support GIGN.{{cn|date=February 2025}} Its role has been expanded to also support RAID in 2008.{{cn|date=February 2025}}

Coordination between GIGN and RAID is handled by a joint organization called Ucofi ({{langx|fr|Unité de coordination des forces d’intervention}}). A &quot;leader/follower&quot; protocol has been established for use when both units need to be engaged jointly, leadership belonging to the unit operating in its primary area of responsibility.

RAID is also a member of the European ATLAS Network, an informal association consisting of the special police units of the 28 states of the European Union.{{cn|date=February 2025}}

<text>The Unibus was the earliest of several computer bus and backplane designs used with PDP-11 and early VAX systems manufactured by the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) of Maynard, Massachusetts. The Unibus was developed around 1969 by Gordon Bell and student Harold McFarland while at Carnegie Mellon University.

The name refers to the unified nature of the bus; Unibus was used both as a system bus allowing the central processing unit to communicate with main memory, as well as a peripheral bus, allowing peripherals to send and receive data. Unifying these formerly separate busses allowed external devices to easily perform direct memory access (DMA) and made the construction of device drivers easier as control and data exchange was all handled through memory-mapped I/O.

Unibus was physically large, which led to the introduction of Q-bus, which multiplexed some signals to reduce pin count. Higher performance PDP systems used Fastbus, essentially two Unibusses in one. The system was later supplanted by Massbus, a dedicated I/O bus introduced on the VAX and late-model PDP-11s.

==Technical specifications==
The Unibus consists of 72 signals, usually connected via two 36-way edge connectors on each printed circuit board. When not counting the power and ground lines, it is usually referred to as a 56-line bus. It can exist within a backplane or on a cable. Up to 20 nodes (devices) can be connected to a single Unibus segment; additional segments can be connected via a bus repeater.

The bus is completely asynchronous, allowing a mixture of fast and slow devices. It allows the overlapping of arbitration (selection of the next &quot;bus master&quot;) while the current bus master is still performing data transfers. The 18 address lines allow the addressing of a maximum of 256 KB. Typically, the top 8 KB is reserved for the registers of the memory-mapped I/O devices used in the PDP-11 architecture.

The design deliberately minimizes the amount of redundant logic required in the system. For example, a system always contains more slave devices than master devices so most of the complex logic required to implement asynchronous data transfers is forced into the relatively few master devices. For interrupts, only the &quot;interrupt-fielding processor&quot; needs to contain the complex timing logic. The result is that most I/O controllers can be implemented with simple logic, and most of the critical logic is implemented as a custom MSI IC.

==Pinout==

Type 1 lines are a normal multi-sender wired-OR bus with pull-up resistors at each end of the bus, typically on a terminator card.

Type 2 lines are selectively propagated by each card to the next slot – if the card wants to keep the request grant it will assert the SACK line and not propagate the request to the next slot. If a slot is empty, it is necessary to install a &quot;grant continuity card&quot; in the slot to propagate the four type 2 signals to the next card.

Type 3 signals are generated by the power supply and have only a single sender. They warn the devices on the bus when the power is about to fail, so those devices can execute an orderly shutdown, and disable operations to prevent spurious writes.

The two control lines (C0 and C1) allowed the selection of four different data transfer cycles:
*DATI (Data In, a read)
*DATIP (Data In/Pause, the first portion of a Read-Modify-Write operation. A DATO or DATOB operation completes this.)
*DATO (Data Out, a word write)
*DATOB (Data Out/Byte, a byte write)
*During an interrupt cycle, a fifth style of transfer was automatically invoked to convey an &quot;interrupt vector&quot; from the interrupting device to the &quot;interrupt-fielding processor&quot;.

<text>J002E3 is an object in space which is thought to be the S-IVB third stage of the Apollo 12 Saturn V rocket. It was discovered on September 3, 2002, by amateur astronomer Bill Yeung. Initially thought to be an asteroid, it has since been tentatively identified as the third stage of Apollo 12 Saturn V based on spectrographic evidence consistent with the titanium dioxide in the paint used on the rockets. The stage was intended to be injected into a permanent heliocentric orbit in November 1969, but is now believed instead to have gone into an unstable high Earth orbit which left Earth&#x27;s proximity in 1971 and again in June 2003, with an approximately 40-year cycle between heliocentric and geocentric orbit.

==Discovery==
When it was first discovered, it was quickly found that the object was in an orbit around Earth. Astronomers were surprised at this, as the Moon is the only large object in orbit around the Earth, and anything else would have been ejected long ago due to perturbations with the Earth, the Moon and the Sun.

Therefore, it probably entered into Earth orbit very recently, yet there was no recently launched spacecraft that matched the orbit of J002E3. One explanation could have been that it was a 30 meter-wide piece of rock, but University of Arizona astronomers found that spectral observations of the object indicated a strong correlation of absorption features with a combination of human-made materials including white paint, black paint, and aluminum, consistent with Saturn V rockets. Back-tracing its orbit showed that the object had been orbiting the Sun for 31 years and had last been in the vicinity of the Earth in 1971. This seemed to suggest that it was a part of the Apollo 14 mission, but NASA knew the whereabouts of all hardware used for that mission; the third stage, for instance, was deliberately crashed into the Moon for seismic studies.

The most likely explanation appears to be the S-IVB third stage for Apollo 12. Photometric observations of J002E3 made in February 2003 from the Air Force Maui Optical and Supercomputing Site (AMOS) matched an S-IVB light curve model consisting of a diffuse cylinder tumbling with a period of 63.46 seconds and a precession of 79 ± 10°. NASA had originally planned to direct the S-IVB into a solar orbit, but an extra long burn of the ullage motors meant that venting the remaining propellant in the tank of the S-IVB did not give the rocket stage enough energy to escape the Earth–Moon system, and instead the stage ended up in a semi-stable orbit around the Earth after passing by the Moon on 18 November 1969.

It is thought that J002E3 left Earth orbit in June 2003, and that it may return to orbit the Earth in the mid-2040s.

==Potential impact with Earth or Moon==
The object&#x27;s Earth orbital paths occasionally take it within the radius of the Moon&#x27;s orbit, and could result in eventual entry into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, or collision with the Moon. The Apollo 12 empty S-IVB, Instrument Unit, and spacecraft adapter base, had a mass of about . This is less than one-fifth of the mass of the Skylab space station, which was constructed from a similar S-IVB and fell out of orbit on 11 July 1979. Objects with a mass of about enter Earth&#x27;s atmosphere approximately 10 times a year, one of which impacts the Earth&#x27;s surface approximately once every 10 years.

Ten essentially similar empty S-IVB stages from Apollo, Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz Test Project missions have re-entered the atmosphere from 1966 to 1975. In all cases (including the Skylab station), the objects burned in the atmosphere and broke into relatively small pieces, rather than striking the Earth as a single mass. On the other hand, these objects entered from low Earth orbit or a ballistic trajectory, with less energy than J002E3 might possibly have if it were to enter from solar orbit.

<doc id="1300341" wikidata="Q2065945" url="?curid=1300341" title="Non-homologous end joining">
<text>Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is a pathway that repairs double-strand breaks in DNA. It is called &quot;non-homologous&quot; because the break ends are directly ligated without the need for a homologous template, in contrast to homology directed repair (HDR), which requires a homologous sequence to guide repair. NHEJ is active in both non-dividing and proliferating cells, while HDR is not readily accessible in non-dividing cells. The term &quot;non-homologous end joining&quot; was coined in 1996 by Moore and Haber.

NHEJ is typically guided by short homologous DNA sequences called microhomologies. These microhomologies are often present in single-stranded overhangs on the ends of double-strand breaks. When the overhangs are perfectly compatible, NHEJ usually repairs the break accurately. Imprecise repair leading to loss of nucleotides can also occur, but is much more common when the overhangs are not compatible. Inappropriate NHEJ can lead to translocations and telomere fusion, hallmarks of tumor cells.

NHEJ implementations are understood to have been existent throughout nearly all biological systems and it is the predominant double-strand break repair pathway in mammalian cells. In budding yeast (&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;), however, homologous recombination dominates when the organism is grown under common laboratory conditions.

When the NHEJ pathway is inactivated, double-strand breaks can be repaired by a more error-prone pathway called microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). In this pathway, end resection reveals short microhomologies on either side of the break, which are then aligned to guide repair. This contrasts with classical NHEJ, which typically uses microhomologies already exposed in single-stranded overhangs on the DSB ends. Repair by MMEJ therefore leads to deletion of the DNA sequence between the microhomologies.

==In bacteria and archaea==
Many species of bacteria, including &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, lack an end joining pathway and thus rely completely on homologous recombination to repair double-strand breaks. NHEJ proteins have been identified in a number of bacteria, including &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot;, &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, and &quot;Mycobacterium smegmatis&quot;. Bacteria utilize a remarkably compact version of NHEJ in which all of the required activities are contained in only two proteins: a Ku homodimer and the multifunctional ligase/polymerase/nuclease LigD. In mycobacteria, NHEJ is much more error prone than in yeast, with bases often added to and deleted from the ends of double-strand breaks during repair. Many of the bacteria that possess NHEJ proteins spend a significant portion of their life cycle in a stationary haploid phase, in which a template for recombination is not available. NHEJ may have evolved to help these organisms survive DSBs induced during desiccation. It preferentially use rNTPs (RNA nucleotides), possibly advantageous in dormant cells.

The archaeal NHEJ system in &quot;Methanocella paludicola&quot; have a homodimeric Ku, but the three functions of LigD are broken up into three single-domain proteins sharing an operon. All three genes retain substantial homology with their LigD counterparts and the polymerase retains the preference for rNTP. NHEJ has been lost and acquired multiple times in bacteria and archaea, with a significant amount of horizontal gene transfer shuffling the system around taxa.

Corndog and Omega, two related mycobacteriophages of &quot;Mycobacterium smegmatis&quot;, also encode Ku homologs and exploit the NHEJ pathway to recircularize their genomes during infection. Unlike homologous recombination, which has been studied extensively in bacteria, NHEJ was originally discovered in eukaryotes and was only identified in prokaryotes in the past decade.

==In eukaryotes==
In contrast to bacteria, NHEJ in eukaryotes utilizes a number of proteins, which participate in the following steps:

===End binding and tethering===
In yeast, the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex is recruited to DSBs early and is thought to promote bridging of the DNA ends. The corresponding mammalian complex of Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) is also involved in NHEJ, but it may function at multiple steps in the pathway beyond simply holding the ends in proximity. DNA-PKcs is also thought to participate in end bridging during mammalian NHEJ.

Eukaryotic Ku is a heterodimer consisting of Ku70 and Ku80, and forms a complex with DNA-PKcs, which is present in mammals but absent in yeast. Ku is a basket-shaped molecule that slides onto the DNA end and translocates inward. Ku may function as a docking site for other NHEJ proteins, and is known to interact with the DNA ligase IV complex and XLF.

===End processing===
End processing involves removal of damaged or mismatched nucleotides by nucleases and resynthesis by DNA polymerases. This step is not necessary if the ends are already compatible and have 3&#x27; hydroxyl and 5&#x27; phosphate termini.

Little is known about the function of nucleases in NHEJ. Artemis is required for opening the hairpins that are formed on DNA ends during V(D)J recombination, a specific type of NHEJ, and may also participate in end trimming during general NHEJ. Mre11 has nuclease activity, but it seems to be involved in homologous recombination, not NHEJ.

The X family DNA polymerases Pol λ and Pol μ (Pol4 in yeast) fill gaps during NHEJ. Yeast lacking Pol4 are unable to join 3&#x27; overhangs that require gap filling, but remain proficient for gap filling at 5&#x27; overhangs. This is because the primer terminus used to initiate DNA synthesis is less stable at 3&#x27; overhangs, necessitating a specialized NHEJ polymerase.

===Ligation===
The DNA ligase IV complex, consisting of the catalytic subunit DNA ligase IV and its cofactor XRCC4 (Dnl4 and Lif1 in yeast), performs the ligation step of repair. XLF, also known as Cernunnos, is homologous to yeast Nej1 and is also required for NHEJ. While the precise role of XLF is unknown, it interacts with the XRCC4/DNA ligase IV complex and likely participates in the ligation step. Recent evidence suggests that XLF promotes re-adenylation of DNA ligase IV after ligation, recharging the ligase and allowing it to catalyze a second ligation.

===Other===
In yeast, Sir2 was originally identified as an NHEJ protein, but is now known to be required for NHEJ only because it is required for the transcription of Nej1.

NHEJ and heat-labile sites

Induction of heat-labile sites (HLS) is a signature of ionizing radiation. The DNA clustered damage sites consist of different types of DNA lesions. Some of these lesions are not prompt DSBs but they convert to DSB after heating. HLS are not evolved to DSB under physiological temperature (37 C). Also, the interaction of HLS with other lesions and their role in living cells is yet elusive. The repair mechanisms of these sites are not fully revealed. The NHEJ is the dominant DNA repair pathway throughout the cell cycle. The DNA-PKcs protein is the critical element in the center of NHEJ. Using DNA-PKcs KO cell lines or inhibition of DNA-PKcs does not affect the repair capacity of HLS. Also blocking both HR and NHEJ repair pathways by dactolisib (NVP-BEZ235) inhibitor showed that repair of HLS is not dependent on HR and NHEJ. These results showed that the repair mechanism of HLS is independent of NHEJ and HR pathways

==Regulation==
The choice between NHEJ and homologous recombination for repair of a double-strand break is regulated at the initial step in recombination, 5&#x27; end resection. In this step, the 5&#x27; strand of the break is degraded by nucleases to create long 3&#x27; single-stranded tails. DSBs that have not been resected can be rejoined by NHEJ, but resection of even a few nucleotides strongly inhibits NHEJ and effectively commits the break to repair by recombination. NHEJ is active throughout the cell cycle, but is most important during G1 when no homologous template for recombination is available. This regulation is accomplished by the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1 (Cdc28 in yeast), which is turned off in G1 and expressed in S and G2. Cdk1 phosphorylates the nuclease Sae2, allowing resection to initiate.

==V(D)J recombination==
NHEJ plays a critical role in V(D)J recombination, the process by which B-cell and T-cell receptor diversity is generated in the vertebrate immune system. In V(D)J recombination, hairpin-capped double-strand breaks are created by the RAG1/RAG2 nuclease, which cleaves the DNA at recombination signal sequences. These hairpins are then opened by the Artemis nuclease and joined by NHEJ. A specialized DNA polymerase called terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), which is only expressed in lymph tissue, adds nontemplated nucleotides to the ends before the break is joined. This process couples &quot;variable&quot; (V), &quot;diversity&quot; (D), and &quot;joining&quot; (J) regions, which when assembled together create the variable region of a B-cell or T-cell receptor gene. Unlike typical cellular NHEJ, in which accurate repair is the most favorable outcome, error-prone repair in V(D)J recombination is beneficial in that it maximizes diversity in the coding sequence of these genes. Patients with mutations in NHEJ genes are unable to produce functional B cells and T cells and suffer from severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).

==At telomeres==
Telomeres are normally protected by a &quot;cap&quot; that prevents them from being recognized as double-strand breaks. Loss of capping proteins causes telomere shortening and inappropriate joining by NHEJ, producing dicentric chromosomes which are then pulled apart during mitosis. Paradoxically, some NHEJ proteins are involved in telomere capping. For example, Ku localizes to telomeres and its deletion leads to shortened telomeres. Ku is also required for subtelomeric silencing, the process by which genes located near telomeres are turned off.

==Consequences of dysfunction==
Several human syndromes are associated with dysfunctional NHEJ. Hypomorphic mutations in LIG4 and XLF cause LIG4 syndrome and XLF-SCID, respectively. These syndromes share many features including cellular radiosensitivity, microcephaly and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) due to defective V(D)J recombination. Loss-of-function mutations in Artemis also cause SCID, but these patients do not show the neurological defects associated with LIG4 or XLF mutations. The difference in severity may be explained by the roles of the mutated proteins. Artemis is a nuclease and is thought to be required only for repair of DSBs with damaged ends, whereas DNA Ligase IV and XLF are required for all NHEJ events. Mutations in genes that participate in non-homologous end joining lead to ataxia-telangiectasia (ATM gene), Fanconi anemia (multiple genes), as well as hereditary breast and ovarian cancers (BRCA1 gene).

Many NHEJ genes have been knocked out in mice. Deletion of XRCC4 or LIG4 causes embryonic lethality in mice, indicating that NHEJ is essential for viability in mammals. In contrast, mice lacking Ku or DNA-PKcs are viable, probably because low levels of end joining can still occur in the absence of these components. All NHEJ mutant mice show a SCID phenotype, sensitivity to ionizing radiation, and neuronal apoptosis.

==Aging==
A system was developed for measuring NHEJ efficiency in the mouse. NHEJ efficiency could be compared across tissues of the same mouse and in mice of different age. Efficiency was higher in the skin, lung and kidney fibroblasts, and lower in heart fibroblasts and brain astrocytes. Furthermore, NHEJ efficiency declined with age. The decline was 1.8 to 3.8-fold, depending on the tissue, in the 5-month-old compared to the 24-month-old mice. Reduced capability for NHEJ can lead to an increase in the number of unrepaired or faultily repaired DNA double-strand breaks that may then contribute to aging. An analysis of the level of NHEJ protein Ku80 in human, cow, and mouse indicated that Ku80 levels vary dramatically between species, and that these levels are strongly correlated with species longevity.

<doc id="1300344" wikidata="Q6269777" url="?curid=1300344" title="Joking Apart">
<text>Joking Apart is a BBC television sitcom written by Steven Moffat about the rise and fall of a relationship. It juxtaposes a couple, Mark (Robert Bathurst) and Becky (Fiona Gillies), who fall in love and marry, before getting separated and finally divorced. The twelve episodes, broadcast between 1993 and 1995, were directed by Bob Spiers and produced by Andre Ptaszynski for independent production company Pola Jones.

The show is semi-autobiographical; it was inspired by the then-recent separation of Moffat and his first wife. Some of the episodes in the first series followed a non-linear parallel structure, contrasting the rise of the relationship with the fall. Other episodes were ensemble farces, predominantly including the couple&#x27;s friends Robert (Paul Raffield) and Tracy (Tracie Bennett). Paul Mark Elliott also appeared as Trevor, Becky&#x27;s lover.

Scheduling problems meant that the show attracted low viewing figures. However, it scored highly on the Appreciation Index and accrued a loyal fanbase. One fan acquired the home video rights from the BBC and released both series on his own DVD label.

==Production==

===Inception===
By 1990, Moffat had written two series of &quot;Press Gang&quot;, but the programme&#x27;s high cost along with organisational changes at Central cast its future in doubt. As Moffat wondered what to do next and worried about his future employment, Bob Spiers, &quot;Press Gang&quot;&#x27;s primary director, suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom. Moffat&#x27;s father had been a headteacher and Moffat himself had taught English before writing &quot;Press Gang&quot;, so his initial proposal was a programme similar to what would become &quot;Chalk,&quot; a series that eventually aired in 1997.

As he was separating from his wife, Moffat was going through a difficult period and aspects of it coloured his creative output. He introduced a proxy of his wife&#x27;s new partner into the &quot;Press Gang&quot; episode &quot;The Big Finish?&quot;, the character Brian Magboy (Simon Schatzberger). Moffat scripted unfortunate situations for the Magboy character, such as having a typewriter drop on his foot. Moffat says that the character&#x27;s name was inspired by his wife&#x27;s: &quot;Magboy: Maggie&#x27;s boy&quot;.

During the pitch meeting at the Groucho Club, Ptaszynski realised that Moffat was talking passionately about his impending divorce and suggested that he write about that instead of his initial proposal, a school sitcom. Taking Ptaszynski&#x27;s advice, Moffat&#x27;s new idea was about &quot;a sitcom writer whose wife leaves him&quot;. Speaking about the autobiographical elements of the show, the writer jokes that he has to remember that his wife didn&#x27;t leave him &quot;for&quot; an estate agent; his wife &quot;was&quot; an estate agent. In 2003, Moffat told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that his &quot;ex-wife wasn&#x27;t terribly pleased about her failed marriage being presented as a sitcom on BBC2 on Monday nights&quot;. In an interview with Richard Herring, Moffat says that &quot;the sit-com actually lasted slightly longer than my marriage&quot;. Conversely, his later sitcom &quot;Coupling&quot; was based on his relationship with his second wife, TV producer Sue Vertue. Moffat reused the surname &#x27;Taylor&#x27;, which is Mark&#x27;s surname in &quot;Joking Apart&quot;, for Jack Davenport&#x27;s character Steve in &quot;Coupling&quot;.

===Recording===

The pilot, directed by John Kilby, was filmed at Pebble Mill in Birmingham on 9–10 August 1990. It is practically identical to the first episode of the series proper; some scenes are even reused, notably the scene with Mark and Becky meeting when he accidentally turns up at a funeral. The reused footage gave rise to the first episode&#x27;s shared director credit between Spiers and Kilby. The stand-up sequences were shot against a black background. Although this made it clearer that they were not &quot;real&quot;, Moffat thought that it looked odd. The pilot was transmitted on BBC2 as part of its &quot;Comic Asides&quot; series of pilot shows on 12 July 1991.

Moffat had written all six episodes of the first series before recording commenced. With series two, he had written only the first four episodes by the time recording had commenced, only delivering the final episode by the first day of rehearsals.

All of the location shots were filmed at the beginning of the production block. Recording for the first series of six episodes began on location in the first half of April 1992 and were mainly filmed in Chelsea within a short distance from the director&#x27;s home. The stand-up sequences were filmed in the &quot;Café Des Artistes&quot; on London&#x27;s Fulham Road, now known as the Valmont Club, and were shot for the benefit of the studio audience, with the intention of reshooting them later for the broadcast version. Robert Bathurst has complained that, in order to save £5,000, this promised reshoot never materialised. The close ups of Bathurst were filmed in the studio for the second series, with stock footage of the club&#x27;s audience reused.

After the exterior shots had been filmed, the episodes were recorded at BBC Television Centre in April and May 1992 for the first series, and 12 November until 18 December 1993 for the second. Studio recording sessions were normally completed quickly; Gillies recalls &quot;an hour and a half, tops&quot;. To a large extent, the editing occurred live during the studio recording with only tightening later. At the end of the recording on Sunday evenings Spiers would review the show before retiring to the bar, with the bulk of the work complete. Moffat contrasts this with the editing of modern sitcoms, which, he says, are edited more like film.

===Structure===
Many of the first six episodes of &quot;Joking Apart&quot; were constructed non-sequentially, with scenes from the beginning of the relationship juxtaposed with those from the end. Moffat describes this non-linear technique as a &quot;romantic comedy, but a romantic comedy backwards because it ends with the couple unhappy&quot;. Moffat had experimented with non-linear narrative in &quot;Press Gang&quot;, such as the episode &quot;Monday-Tuesday&quot;. Various episodes of &quot;Coupling&quot; played with structure, such as the fourth series episode &quot;9½ Minutes&quot; which showed the same events from three perspectives.
All of the episodes open with Bathurst portraying Mark Taylor, a sitcom writer, apparently performing stand-up in a small comedy club. These performances are fantasy sequences, playing out in the character&#x27;s mind and portraying his internal creative processes as comedic monologues; these monologues mainly employ material from the character&#x27;s failing marriage and are intended to show that &quot;he thinks in punchlines, in comedy&quot;. Episodes regularly cut back to these fantasy performances, which usually open with the signature line: &quot;My wife left me ...&quot;. Moffat felt that audiences needed to know from the start that the relationship would not survive. However, it was unclear to some viewers that the fantasy sequences were set in the writer&#x27;s mind; many journalists reported that the character Mark was a stand-up comic, not a sitcom writer.

In the fantasy sequences for the pilot, Bathurst was filmed against a completely black backdrop, which Moffat describes as &quot;hell to look at&quot;. For the series, the sequences were filmed in a real club. Moffat describes this as the &quot;wrong direction&quot; as it became unclear that the fantasy sequences were &quot;not real&quot;. Moffat observes that, like &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, an American sitcom that used a similar device, &quot;Joking Apart&quot; used less of the stand-up as the series progressed. In retrospect, Moffat regrets including the stand-up sequences. Bathurst, however, has considered refilming them as a video diary. Now with older features, he can portray a Mark Taylor reflecting on his earlier life. Both are very critical of the sequences in the DVD audio commentaries. The sequences have also drawn the sharpest criticisms from reviewers. The second series followed a more linear structure, although it retained the stand-up sequences.

===Music and titles===
&quot;Fool (If You Think It&#x27;s Over)&quot;, written by Chris Rea, was used for both the opening and closing credit sequences. The original Rea version was used for the pilot&#x27;s closing credits, but for the series it was performed by Kenny Craddock, who arranged the incidental music with Colin Gibson. Beginning with a saxophone, only the chorus of the theme song accompanied the opening titles. These ran over legal imagery and a sequence of images of famous separated couples, including Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe; Winnie and Nelson Mandela; Princess Anne and Mark Phillips, and culminating in Mark and Becky. The closing credits featured a verse and chorus. The first part of the closing credits was usually over a still of the final frame, and faded to black with the line &quot;All dressed in black.&quot;

==Characters==
Mark Taylor (Robert Bathurst) is a television sitcom writer. Other than episode one, where he is shown working on a script and references to a show of his that had aired during a dinner with Robert and Tracy the night before, his work is hardly mentioned. Mark is quick-witted, and the stand-up sequences indicate that he thinks in one-liners. However, this proves to be the downfall of his marriage with Becky, who says that she didn&#x27;t sign on to become his &quot;lawfully wedded straight man&quot;. In one episode, Mark jokes about worrying if his virginity will heal back; Becky articulates her frustration by responding &quot;What page is that on?&quot; Identifying his insecurities, she points out that the &quot;thing about someone who uses humour as a weapon, is not the sense of humour, but the fact that they need a weapon&quot;. In interviews, Bathurst has compared Steven Moffat to his character: Mark is &quot;a man whose wife leaves him because he talks in one-liners. And Steven Moffat&#x27;s wife had just left him, because he talks in one-liners.&quot;

Robert Bathurst, a former Footlights president, was cast as Mark Taylor. He was performing on a live topical programme on BSB called &quot;Up Yer News&quot;. A fellow performer on that show also auditioned for the part at what is now the Soho Theatre, then the old Soho Synagogue in Dean Street, and claimed that he would break Bathurst&#x27;s legs if the latter got the job. In a 2005 interview, Bathurst recalls that the threat seemed not to be entirely jocular. Bathurst speaks very highly of &quot;Joking Apart&quot;, identifying it as a &quot;career highlight&quot; and the most enjoyable job he has ever done. Retrospectively, he wishes that he had &quot;roughened up&quot; Mark, as he was &quot;too designery&quot;.

Becky Johnson/Taylor (Fiona Gillies) meets Mark at a funeral and they eventually marry. Although irritated at being his comic foil, she is capable of her own quick-witted put-downs. In episode 3, for example, she wins an impromptu one-liner contest over Mark, whose put-downs fall flat. Becky is shown as an independent woman, meeting Mark on her terms. The first series revolves around her leaving Mark for estate agent Trevor, whom she subsequently cheats on in series two. This was Fiona Gillies&#x27; first major television role, having appeared in &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;, a 1988 episode of &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, and the mini-series &quot;Mother Love&quot;. She was aware that some of her dialogue was based on what had been said to Moffat during his own separation.

Robert and Tracy Glazebrook (Paul Raffield and Tracie Bennett) are their &quot;increasingly bizarre and totally dim friends&quot;. They are initially Becky&#x27;s friends, but soon befriend Mark, comforting him on the night Becky leaves him. Tracy, as Tracie Bennett identifies, is a stereotypical Tracy—normally a dysphemism for an intellectually inadequate, usually blonde, female. However, &quot;she&#x27;s not a bimbo: she&#x27;s quite clever in her own logic&quot;. Bennett jokes that she was quite offended that such a character was named Tracy. Tracy&#x27;s catchphrase of &quot;you&#x27;re a silly&quot; was originally Moffat&#x27;s typographical error, which Bennett faithfully reproduced in her performance. They decided that the amended version worked well for the character.

They are both naive about sex and technology. Tracy, for example, attempts to telephone Robert to inform him that he&#x27;s lost his mobile phone, and believes that she is a lesbian when she discovers her husband in women&#x27;s clothing. They have a baby, who is seen or referred to occasionally. This reflects, as the writer observes, Moffat&#x27;s inexperience of looking after children at the time.

Trevor (Paul Mark Elliott) is Becky&#x27;s lover. His job as an estate agent regularly provokes derision from Mark. (Moffat&#x27;s ex-wife was an estate agent.) He is himself cheated on in the second series, as Becky dates her solicitor Michael (Tony Gardner). Trevor&#x27;s debut appearance is in the third episode where he and Becky go to Robert and Tracy&#x27;s house for dinner, but he generally features less regularly than the main ensemble.

==Episodes==

===Series one===
The first episode shows the couple meeting at a funeral, marrying, and going through the honeymoon phase. The last section of the episode features a confrontation between Becky and Mark, in which the former admits that she is an adulteress before realising that all of her friends are hiding around her living room in preparation for a surprise party for her. The story continues directly into episode two, when Robert and Tracy return to the flat to check on Mark after his wife&#x27;s departure. The three recall the circumstances in which they had first met. After their first date, the couple go back to Becky&#x27;s flat. While she is in the bathroom, he strips down to his boxer shorts and handcuffs himself to the bedpost. Unable to free himself, he is found by Robert and Tracy as they walk in on him. Moffat used a similar scenario for the &quot;Coupling&quot; episode &quot;The Freckle, the Key, and the Couple who Weren&#x27;t&quot; and reveals in its audio commentary that it is based on a situation with one of his ex-girlfriends.

In the third episode, Mark arrives at Robert and Tracy&#x27;s house on the wrong night for a dinner party. The couple are entertaining that night, but are instead expecting Becky and her new boyfriend Trevor. Hopeful of a reconciliation, Mark assumes that his friends are trying to smooth things over between them. They spend the evening trying to keep Mark and Trevor apart, each not knowing that the other is also there. Episode five makes extensive use of what Moffat labels &quot;techno-farce&quot;, which uses technology, predominantly telephones, to facilitate the farcical situations. Moffat considers this episode the best of the show. Discussing the series as a whole, Moffat felt that the story ends after this episode. It begins when Mark attempts to return Robert&#x27;s mobile phone and ends with Robert threatening to shoot Mark after the latter has slept with Tracy. The series ends with Becky and Trevor, and Robert and Tracy reconciling their relationships and Mark being left alone.

===Series two===
The format was changed for this series, with the dual timelines and many of the flashbacks dropped for a more linear narrative. Moffat felt that the relationship had already been sufficiently established in the first series so there was little point returning to the start. Set two months after the end of series one, Mark meets Becky in a newsagent, where he is purchasing pornographic magazines. He discovers the location of Becky and Trevor&#x27;s house and breaks in using Tracy&#x27;s keys. However, he is forced to hide under the bed when Becky and Trevor return home. Listening to them having sex, he becomes optimistic when he thinks that Becky is beginning to shout his name (&quot;M...&quot;). The name turns out to be Michael (Tony Gardner), Becky&#x27;s solicitor, with whom she is now being unfaithful to Trevor.

Robert and Tracy are given more stories than in the first series. Their main story arc begins in the third episode when Robert is caught by all of the main characters and his parents in a maid&#x27;s outfit being spanked by a prostitute. The couple temporarily separate while Robert experiments with cross-dressing, but they are reunited by the end of the series.

The fourth episode features a scene where Mark jams his dressing gown in the door and is forced to hide naked in his new neighbour&#x27;s flat. This sequence was Moffat&#x27;s revenge for Bathurst&#x27;s late arrival at the series one press launch at the Café Royal in Regent Street, London. Moffat threatened that if they ever did a second series he would write a whole episode in which Bathurst was naked. After being mistaken for a flasher, Mark is punched by his neighbour&#x27;s brother. When he awakens he is confronted by a man (Kerry Shale) in a red polo neck jumper who claims to be &quot;his very best friend&quot;. In the fifth episode it transpires that the man, who identifies himself as Dick, is the personification of Mark&#x27;s penis.

The final episode begins after Becky and Michael had slept together while Becky is house sitting for Tracy and Robert, and Michael hides in the bathroom when the latter couple return. Tracy phones a morning television phone-in show and when she realises that the show&#x27;s divorce expert is hiding in her bathroom she takes on his role (with a heavy Northern accent, actually a slightly exaggerated version of Bennett&#x27;s own voice) to give herself advice on the other line. Bennett says this was the hardest thing she has had to do in her career.

==Scheduling==
After the pilot was transmitted on 12 July 1991, the BBC were interested in a series. However, Moffat had signed on to write the third and fourth series of &quot;Press Gang&quot; as one twelve-episode block so it was not until 1992 that they produced the series. After being postponed from the autumn schedules, the first series was transmitted on Thursday evenings on BBC2 from 7 January until 11 February 1993.

The second series was filmed in late 1993. However, the controller of BBC2, Michael Jackson, had little faith in the project at the time, which, according to the writer, he now admits was wrong. Jackson felt that it was too mainstream for BBC2 and not mainstream enough for BBC1. The second series was scheduled to air from 11 June 1994, but was delayed many times. Bathurst articulates the group&#x27;s frustration at the delay:

Every so often, I&#x27;d get a call from the producer saying, it&#x27;s going out at this time. The publicity people would be alerted, then we&#x27;d get a call saying no, it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s been put back. That happened six times, I think, altogether – seven reschedules in a year or so ... It was extraordinary and inexplicable, and just one of these things that happen. I mean, a lot of shows are left on people&#x27;s desks and they hardly get seen, and &quot;Joking Apart&quot; was certainly one of those. Meanwhile, they were making about four series of &quot;The Brittas Empire&quot;, and you thought, &quot;Bloody Hell! Come on, surely….?&quot; To my mind, our show was a very superior product, and it upset me that other shows, which I, personally, felt were broader and less interesting, were getting precedence.

The first series was repeated in preparation for the six episodes of the second series, which began transmission on Tuesday evenings from 3 January until 7 February 1995. The second series was only transmitted once even though the BBC had paid to show it twice. Moffat feels that the delay damaged the series because such bad scheduling hinders returning audiences and that the two-year gap meant that it seemed as if Mark &quot;had been banging on about this sodding divorce for an awfully long time!&quot;

After winning the Montreux award it seemed inevitable that the show would get a third series. At a Christmas party, a BBC executive expressed a wish for the ratings of a third series &quot;to go like Everest&quot;, indicating a steep slope with his hands. Bathurst replied, &quot;But, Everest goes down the other side ...&quot; The show was not recommissioned. Moffat says that he had no idea for a third series anyway, as it would have been difficult to contrive how a group of people who did not particularly like each other would get together so regularly.

==Reception==
The scheduling problems meant that the show did not get the momentum to achieve high viewing figures. Moffat jokes that &quot;the eight people who saw it were very happy indeed&quot;. However, as Bathurst observes, &quot;there&#x27;s an underground of people who like it&quot;. The show rated highly on the Appreciation Index, meaning that viewers thought very highly of the programme. Bathurst says that drunks on the London Underground tell him in detail the plot of their favourite episode. The cast claim that the programme has a timeless, universal appeal as there are no time-specific references apart from the typewriter and the size of the mobile telephones. Gillies says that her accountant watches it to cheer himself up, while Bathurst recalls that a friend cheered so loudly when Mark pushes avocado into Trevor&#x27;s face in the third episode that he woke his son.

Critical reception was generally positive. In his overview of Moffat&#x27;s celebrated &quot;Press Gang&quot;, Paul Cornell said that the writer &quot;continues to impress&quot; with &quot;Joking Apart&quot;. The &quot;Daily Express&quot; said that it was &quot;flavoured with a delicious bitterness about the perfidy of women and the conscious-less nature of the male orgasm, it was plotted with the intricacy of a French farce&quot;. Another reviewer for the &quot;Express&quot; commented that &quot;it&#x27;s quite funny and an acute analysis&quot; of the modern divorce, and that the first episode was &quot;distinctly promising&quot;. Similarly &quot;DVD Review&quot; comments that &quot;Moffat&#x27;s distillation of his marriage melting down is as precise a piece of comic writing as you&#x27;re likely to find.&quot;

Not all reviews were completely positive. Criticising Bathurst for being too handsome to convey the frustrations of a writer, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; said that the show had &quot;its problems but possesses a dark, mordant wit&quot;. William Gallagher comments that &quot;&quot;Press Gang&quot; was pretty flawless, but &quot;Joking Apart&quot; would veer from brilliance to schoolboy humour from week to week.&quot;

While the transmission of series two was being delayed by BBC 2 controller Michael Jackson, the show won the Bronze Rose of Montreux and was entered for the Emmys. The show was remade in Portugal but used a linear structure rather than the flashbacks. Moffat reflects that although the remake is &quot;not as dark or ground-breaking&quot; as the original, it is &quot;probably more fun&quot; because it ends happily.

==Home media==
Both series have been released on DVD. A fan of the show, Craig Robins, bought the rights from 2Entertain, BBC Worldwide&#x27;s DVD publishing company, and released it on his own independent label, Replay DVD. Robins put up £30,000 of his own money to buy the rights and produced the series one disc. As a professional videotape editor, Robins was able to restore the video, and author the disc himself, using a piece of freeware to transcribe the dialogue for the subtitles.

The first series was released on DVD on 29 May 2006. It contains audio commentaries on four of the episodes from Moffat, Bathurst, Gillies and Bennett. It also contains a featurette, &quot;Fool If You Think It&#x27;s Over&quot;, with retrospective interviews. The second series was released on 17 March 2008 as a two-disc set. It contains audio commentaries on all episodes: five featuring a mix of Moffat, Bathurst, Gillies, Bennett, Raffield and Ptaszynski, with episode two featuring Spiers, and production manager Stacey Adair that concentrates on the behind-the-scenes production. The pilot from &quot;Comic Asides&quot; is also included on Disc 2, along with a complete set of Series Two scripts in Portable Document Format (PDF) and a PDF article entitled &quot;Joking Apart in the Studio&quot;. The release includes a companion booklet.

Replay DVD was commended in reviews for the quality of the disc. &quot;DVD Times&quot; reports that &quot;&quot;Joking Apart&quot; looks much sharper than the average television show on DVD. The colours are also much richer and have obviously been fixed throughout to present a more uniform image while the picture is bright and clear.&quot; The featurette on the series 1 set is labelled &quot;a great little feature&quot;, with Moffat particularly praised for his contribution. &quot;DVD Times&quot; identifies &quot;a real sense of friendship and of a real liking for this show&quot; within the commentaries, highlighting that Moffat &quot;sounds really happy ... for &quot;Joking Apart&quot; to have finally gotten some recognition&quot;.

<doc id="1300347" wikidata="Q2023100" url="?curid=1300347" title="Q-Bus">
<text>The Q-bus, also known as the LSI-11 Bus, is one of several bus technologies used with PDP and MicroVAX computer systems previously manufactured by the Digital Equipment Corporation of Maynard, Massachusetts.

The Q-bus is a less expensive version of Unibus using multiplexing so that address and data signals share the same wires. This allows both a physically smaller and less-expensive implementation of essentially the same functionality.

Over time, the physical address range of the Q-bus was expanded from 16 to 18 and then 22 bits. Block transfer modes were also added to the Q-bus.

==Main features of the Q-bus==

The Q-bus is arranged as a series of modules installed in one or more backplanes.

Like the Unibus before it, the Q-bus uses:
* &quot;Memory-mapped I/O&quot;
* &quot;Byte addressing&quot;
* A strict &quot;master-slave&quot; relationship between devices on the bus
* &quot;Asynchronous signaling&quot;

&quot;Memory-mapped I/O&quot; means that data cycles between any two devices, whether CPU, memory, or I/O devices, use the same protocols. On the Unibus, a range of physical addresses are dedicated for I/O devices. The Q-bus simplifies this design by providing a specific signal (originally called &quot;BBS7&quot;, &quot;Bus Bank Select 7&quot; but later generalized to be called &quot;BBSIO&quot;, &quot;Bus Bank Select I/O&quot;) that selects the range of addresses used by the I/O devices.

&quot;Byte addressing&quot; means that the physical address passed on the Unibus is interpreted as the address of a byte-sized quantity of data. Because the bus actually contains a data path that is two bytes wide, address bit [0] is subject to special interpretation and data on the bus has to travel in the correct byte lanes.

A strict &quot;Master-Slave&quot; relationship means that at any point in time, only one device can be the &quot;Master&quot; of the Q-bus. This &quot;master device&quot; can initiate data transactions which can then be responded to by a maximum of one selected &quot;slave device&quot;. (This had no effect on whether a given bus cycle is reading or writing data; the bus master can command either type of transaction.) At the end of the bus cycle, a &quot;bus arbitration&quot; protocol then selects the next device to be given mastery of the bus.

&quot;Asynchronous signaling&quot; means that the bus has no fixed cycle time; the duration of any particular data transfer cycle on the bus is determined solely by the master and slave devices participating in the current data cycle. These devices use &quot;handshake&quot; signals to control the timing of the data cycle. Timeout logic within the master device limits the maximum allowed length of any given bus cycle.

Depending on its generation, the Q-bus contains 16, 18, or 22 &quot;BDAL&quot; (&quot;Bus Data/Address Line&quot;) lines. 16, 18, or 22 BDAL lines are used for the physical address portion of each bus cycle. Eight or 16 DBAL lines are then re-used for the data portion(s) of each bus cycle. Newer generations of the bus allow &quot;block mode&quot; transfer where a single bus address can be followed by more than one data cycle (with the transfers taking place at consecutive bus addresses). Because the address portion of each bus cycle can not transfer data, the use of block mode means fewer address cycles and more time for data cycles, allowing increased bus data transfer bandwidth.

Bus mastery is awarded based on an I/O card&#x27;s topological proximity to the bus arbitrator (at the logical front of the bus); closer cards are granted priority over further cards.

Interrupts can be delivered to the &quot;Interrupt Fielding Processor&quot; at any of four interrupt priority levels. Within a given level, the cards closer to the IFP (at the front of the bus) take priority over cards further back on the bus. Interrupts are vectored: a card requesting an interrupt has its interrupt vector read by the IFP. In this way, the interrupts from all I/O cards in the system can be distinguished with no ambiguity.

== Physical characteristics ==
Q-bus modules are configured as printed-circuit boards with gold-plated card-edge connectors which mate with corresponding slots on a backplane. The edge connectors on the modules are split into individual &quot;fingers,&quot; similarly to Unibus modules, but are limited to four connectors, compared to the six of Unibus. Modules are available in either double-height (two connectors) or quad-height (four connectors) sizes. This nomenclature is somewhat non-intuitive, as the difference between the two is actually the &quot;width&quot; of the PCB. Quad-height modules tend to be used for CPUs, memory, video processors, and other high-bandwidth components, whereas double-height modules tend to be used for interface cards, connector breakout boards, real-time clocks, ROM/microcode, and other relatively low-bandwidth components. Some exceptions are the double-height LSI-11/2, KDF11-A, and KDJ11-A CPUs, and many early small-capacity memory modules.

==Logic minimization==
As with the Unibus, the signaling was carefully optimized so that the minimum amount of logic is required across the entire bus system. Asynchronous signaling is used but de-skewing of addresses and data is the responsibility of the current bus master, minimizing the complexity of the bus slave devices. The responsibility for timing-out failed bus cycles also is placed in the master devices. Similarly, the complexities of handling interrupt transactions are concentrated into the single &quot;Interrupt-Fielding Processor&quot; (the PDP-11 or VAX-11 computer) in the system.

==Compatibility==
The design of the Q-bus was very closely related to the design of the Unibus both in spirit and in detailed implementation. Adapters were available from Digital and from third parties that allow Q-bus devices to be connected to Unibus-based computers and vice versa. A number of I/O devices were available in either Unibus or Q-bus flavors; some of these devices have minor differences while many others were essentially identical.

==Soviet clones==
In Soviet systems (see 1801 series CPU), the Q-Bus architecture is called МПИ (&quot;Магистральный Параллельный Интерфейс&quot;, or parallel bus interface). Its main difference is that it supports up to four processors on the same bus. Otherwise it is completely binary and electrically compatible with the standard Q-Bus, except for the physical layout of connectors.

==Cycle Types==
The Q-Bus supports 6 basic transaction types:
 DATI Data in - master read - note no DATIB (not required)
 DATO Data out - master write
 DATOB Data out (byte)
 DATIO Data in/out
 DATIOB Data in/out (byte)
 IAK Interrupt Acknowledge

== Device Types ==
A wide range of module types are available for the Q-Bus. Generally, they can be categorized as:

* CPU modules
* Memory modules
* Interface modules
* System modules (grant continuity cards, connector breakout boards, etc)

==Interfaces==
A wide range of interface cards are available for the Q-Bus. Various Q-bus modules can be dual-width (two sets of fingers, half the total width of the mounting), or quad-width (four sets of fingers, the full width of the mounting), indicating that the module occupies one-half of or all of the Q-bus mounting slot, respectively.

<text>Béatrice de Planissoles (circa 1274 – after 1322), was a Cathar minor noble in the Comté de Foix in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth century. She was born circa 1274, probably in the mountain village of Caussou. 

A great deal of information about her life was recorded in the Fournier Register. She has a central role in Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie&#x27;s &quot;Montaillou.&quot;

Béatrice was the daughter of Philippe de Planissoles, a noble who was later convicted of supporting the Cathar heresy. Béatrice herself was sympathetic towards Catharism, but remained attached to the Catholic Church in some respects.

At around the age of twenty, Béatrice was married to Bérenger de Roquefort, the châtelain of the small and largely Cathar community of Montaillou. Despite living in the fortress above the town, Béatrice&#x27;s life was closely linked with that of the local peasants and there was much intermixing. Béatrice was not in love with her husband, an entirely normal state of affairs as noble women usually married for economic reasons. Raymond Roussel, the steward of the châtelain&#x27;s estate, attempted to begin an affair with her. When Roussel tried to sleep with her, however, she had him fired. 

In 1302, de Roquefort died and left Béatrice a widow. At this point, the villager Pathau Clergue raped her. She declined an affair with Pathau when he pressed her to begin one. Soon, however, a relationship began with Pathau&#x27;s cousin, Pierre Clergue, the priest and the most powerful man in the village. This relationship lasted two years before Béatrice decided to leave the mountain village and marry another minor noble, Otho de Lagleize. He, too, died after only a few years of marriage.

In her older years, Béatrice took up with a young priest, Barthélemy Amilhac. She was past menopause, but fell in love with the priest. They ran away together, were united in a form of marriage and remained away for a year. After a number of years, this relationship ended as Barthélemy worried he would be placed in danger by Béatrice&#x27;s Cathar past. He was correct in his concerns and they were both arrested by the inquisition and held for a year. 

Béatrice first appeared before the Inquisition on Saturday, 26 July 1320, at the Episcopal Palace in Pamiers. She had been summoned to the hearing by Jacques Fournier, the Bishop of Pamiers, to answer charges of blasphemy, witchcraft and heresy. The charge of witchcraft was supported by the contents of her purse, which included a variety of &quot;objects, strongly suggestive of having been used by her to cast evil spells&quot;: two umbilical cords of her grandsons, which ensured victory in any lawsuit; linens soaked with her daughter&#x27;s first menstrual blood, meant to be drunk by the daughter&#x27;s husband to ensure his love; frankincense to cure bad headaches; some of the herb rocket, &quot;Eruca sativa,&quot; thought to enhance sperm quality and sexual vigor, which Beatrice refrained from telling Fournier was meant for her husband, the priest; a mirror and a small knife wrapped in a piece of linen; the seed of the herb ive, wrapped in muslin, as a remedy for epilepsy for her grandson; a dry piece of bread called &quot;tinhol&quot; (possibly millet bread); written formulas; and numerous morsels of linen. None of the items, explained Beatrice, was to be used in black magic, that is, divination and the making of mischief. Indeed, Rene Weis comments that Fournier would have recognized the contents as innocuous charms and love potions, except for the bread, which indicated Cathar interests. Beatrice had failed to mention the bread at all; Fournier knew that it must be consecrated bread carried as a talisman.

Barthélemy and Beatrice spent a year in prison and were both released on July 4, 1322, but Béatrice was sentenced to wear the yellow cross forever as punishment, while the priest escaped further sentence.

With her husbands, she had two sons, Guillaume and Bernard, and five daughters: Condors, Esclarmonde, Philippa, Ava and Gentille. 

The band Supreme Fiction has a song on their album &quot;Quivering Things&quot; about Béatrice titled &quot;Beatrice of Montaillou Recants Her Repentance.&quot;

<doc id="1300357" wikidata="Q7349127" url="?curid=1300357" title="Robert R. Young">
<text>Robert Ralph Young (February 14, 1897 – January 25, 1958) was an American financier and industrialist. He is best known for leading the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway and the New York Central Railroad during and after World War II. He was a brother-in-law of the famous western painter, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe.

Because of his initials, R.R. Young was often labeled &quot;Railroad&quot; Young. He was otherwise known as the &quot;Populist of Wall Street&quot;, or, as his press agent encouraged journalists to call him, &quot;The Daring Young Man of Wall Street&quot;. He regarded himself as a crusader against the mismanagement of railroads by banking interests. Young&#x27;s most famous advertising slogan was &quot;A hog can cross the country without changing trains – but you can&#x27;t.&quot;

Despite his vocal criticisms, at the railroads he led, Young inaugurated many forward-looking advances in technology that have ramifications to the present. He was one of the first railroad executives to introduce high-speed diesel powered passenger trains which utilized lightweight equipment. He was also involved with the first large-scale railroad computer system, as well as diversification of freight traffic and development and implementation of larger and better freight cars of all types.

==Early life==
Young was born on February 14, 1897, in Canadian, Hemphill County, Texas. He was the son of David John Young and Mary Arabella ( Moody) Young. His maternal grandfather was Robert Moody, builder and owner of the Moody Hotel, who is crediting with bringing banking to Oklahoma. He was educated at Culver Military Academy in Indiana and at the University of Virginia.

==Career==
=== Early career ===
Young took a job as a powder-cutter at the E. I. DuPont gunpowder plant at Carneys Point, New Jersey.

At DuPont, Young worked his way up to the treasurer&#x27;s office, where he learned much about finance and advertising. By 1920, he had left DuPont and speculated in securities for a short time.

Young joined General Motors (GM) in 1922 and was made assistant treasurer in 1928. He soon became associated with GM head John J. Raskob, and left GM to handle Raskob&#x27;s finances, when Raskob, who though a former Republican had been chairman of the Democratic National Committee, took a sabbatical to manage Al Smith&#x27;s presidential campaign against Herbert C. Hoover.

Early in 1929, Raskob vehemently disagreed with Young&#x27;s predictions of a stock market crash, and the two men parted company. Subsequently, Young netted a fortune selling stocks short of their earlier value.

In 1931, Young formed a brokerage partnership with Frank Kolbe and bought a seat on the New York Stock Exchange in order to speculate in stocks.

===Film===
Young acquired First Division Pictures in 1935, a distributor based in five cities in the Eastern United States, and hired future United Artists chairman Robert S. Benjamin as a lawyer. He expanded his film interest into laboratory work, as an affiliate of DuPont, national distribution and financing productions. In 1943 he acquired Producers Releasing Corporation, a B-movie production company, also known as PRC Pictures. In 1947, PRC was sold to Eagle-Lion Films.

Young continued to own Pathé Laboratories, a motion picture processing laboratory.

=== Chesapeake and Ohio Railway===
In 1942, in alliance with Allan P. Kirby, a retail merchant, Young owned a controlling interest in the Alleghany Corporation, a railroad holding company previously owned by the Cleveland-based Van Sweringen family, which controlled the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, Pere Marquette Railroad, and other railroad properties.

By the end of World War II, C&amp;O was poised to help America during its great growth during the following decades, and at mid-century was truly a line of national importance. It became more so, at least in the public eye through Young, who became &quot;the gadfly of the rails&quot; as he challenged old methods of financing and operating railroads, and inaugurated many forward-looking advances in technology that have ramifications to the present.

As chairman of the board of the C&amp;O, Young launched a well-publicized campaign for the modernization of railroad passenger service. He was one of the first railroad executives to introduce lightweight, high-speed diesel passenger trains.

He served as a delegate from Rhode Island to the Republican National Convention in 1944.

In 1945, Young and Cyrus S. Eaton assembled $43,000,000 in a bid to purchase the Pullman Company operating pool, in the wake of a court decision that forced Pullman to divest that portion of its business. Their bid ultimately failed when a Philadelphia court, acting on recommendations from the ICC, awarded the railcar operations to a consortium of the large railroads.
Young changed the C&amp;O&#x27;s herald (logo) to &quot;C&amp;O for Progress&quot; to embody his ideas that C&amp;O would lead the industry to a new day. He installed a well-staffed research and development department, which came up with ideas for passenger service that are thought to be futuristic even now, and for freight service that would challenge the growth of trucking. Fortune magazine wrote, &quot;Young has an almost endless inventory of ideas, some pneumatic and some substantial, about passenger service. He believes that the railroads could double any previous passenger revenues if they put out a good product and merchandised it well...&quot;
During the Young era and subsequently, C&amp;O was headed by Cyrus S. Eaton and Walter J. Tuohy, under whose control the &quot;For Progress&quot; theme continued, though in a more muted way after the departure of Young. During that time, C&amp;O installed the first large computer system in railroading, developed larger and better freight cars of all types, switched (reluctantly) from steam to diesel motive power, and diversified its traffic, which had already occurred in 1947 when it merged Pere Marquette, of Michigan and Ontario, Canada, which had been controlled by the C&amp;O since Van Sweringen days, into the system. The PM&#x27;s huge automotive industry traffic, taking raw materials in and finished vehicles out, gave C&amp;O some protection from the swings in the coal trade, making merchandise traffic 50% of the company&#x27;s haulage.

Mr. Young was jointly awarded the inaugural Horatio Alger Award for initiative and excellence in 1947.

=== New York Central ===

In the early 1950s, Young turned his attention to the New York Central Railroad. In 1954, after a long proxy struggle and with the aid of Clint Murchison Sr. and Sid Williams Richardson, Young gained control of the NYC and became the chairman of its board.

The dreams of Young and innovative Alfred E. Perlman, whom he selected to become president of the NYC, to form a true transcontinental line were frustrated by antitrust suits and by lack of interest on the part of the western lines to merge with the nearly bankrupt NYC. Many of Young&#x27;s friends and smaller investors lost money as NYC stock prices fell.

==Personal life==
On April 27, 1916, he married Anita Ten Eyck O&#x27;Keeffe (1892–1985), sister of Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe and artist Ida O&#x27;Keeffe. Her parents, Francis Calyxtus O&#x27;Keeffe and Ida ( Totto) O&#x27;Keeffe, were Wisconsin dairy farmers. Her maternal grandfather, George Victor Totto, was a Hungarian count who came to the United States in 1848. Robert and Anita had one daughter who became one of the much-publicized &quot;Glamour Debutantes&quot; of the Great Depression-era:

* Eleanor &quot;Cookie&quot; Young (1912–1941), who married Robert Ogden &quot;Bunty&quot; Bacon in early 1939. They divorced in December 1939, and she died in 1941 in a plane crash with Nicholas Embiricos.

Among his circle of friends were the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal. Young maintained offices and an apartment in New York City. However, he preferred to do most of his office work in the privacy of the den of his mansion at Newport, Rhode Island. After renting Beechwood for a number of years from Vincent Astor, he bought Fairholme, the former John R. Drexel estate, from Count and Countess Alfonso P. Villa (after Astor sold Beechwood to Allene Tew and her fifth husband, Count Pavel de Kotzebue). In 1946, the Youngs purchased the 200-acre former McCorrie Farm from Mrs. Howard G. Cushing, the 45-acre Anthony Farm and the 185-acre Oakland Farm in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, the former estate of Gov. and Mrs. William Henry Vanderbilt III. Oakland Farm was sold and divided into housing lots by the end of the 1940s.

===Death===
On January 25, 1958, Young, who had suffered from depression for more than fifteen years, took his own life with a shotgun at The Towers, his winter mansion in Palm Beach, Florida. After his death, his widow razed the mansion and built a new one, Montsorrel. The property was sold to Nelson Peltz after Anita&#x27;s death.

He is interred in St. Mary&#x27;s Episcopal Cemetery in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. Oddly, Young had helped to restore an old cemetery in Canadian, which was renamed in honor of his aunt, Edith Ford, who had helped to rear him after the early death of his mother. That graveyard is today known as the Edith Ford Cemeteries.

<text>In the Hartree–Fock method of quantum mechanics, the Fock matrix is a matrix approximating the single-electron energy operator of a given quantum system in a given set of basis vectors.
It is most often formed in computational chemistry when attempting to solve the Roothaan equations for an atomic or molecular system. The Fock matrix is actually an approximation to the true Hamiltonian operator of the quantum system. It includes the effects of electron-electron repulsion only in an average way. Because the Fock operator is a one-electron operator, it does not include the electron correlation energy.

The Fock matrix is defined by the Fock operator. In its general form the Fock operator writes:
:formula_1
Where &quot;i&quot; runs over the total &quot;N&quot; spin orbitals. In the closed-shell case, it can be simplified by considering only the spatial orbitals. Noting that the formula_2 terms are duplicated and the exchange terms are null between different spins.
For the restricted case which assumes closed-shell orbitals and single-
determinantal wavefunctions, the Fock operator for the &quot;i&quot;-th electron is given by:

:formula_3

where:

:formula_4 is the Fock operator for the &quot;i&quot;-th electron in the system,

:formula_5 is the one-electron Hamiltonian for the &quot;i&quot;-th electron,

:formula_6 is the number of electrons and formula_7 is the number of occupied orbitals in the closed-shell system,

:formula_8 is the Coulomb operator, defining the repulsive force between the &quot;j&quot;-th and &quot;i&quot;-th electrons in the system,

:formula_9 is the exchange operator, defining the quantum effect produced by exchanging two electrons.

The Coulomb operator is multiplied by two since there are two electrons in each occupied orbital. The exchange operator is not multiplied by two since it has a non-zero result only for electrons which have the same spin as the &quot;i&quot;-th electron.

For systems with unpaired electrons there are many choices of Fock matrices.

<text>The Open Sourced Vulnerability Database (OSVDB) was an independent and open-sourced vulnerability database. The goal of the project was to provide accurate, detailed, current, and unbiased technical information on security vulnerabilities. The project promoted greater and more open collaboration between companies and individuals. The database&#x27;s motto was &quot;Everything is Vulnerable&quot;.

The core of OSVDB was a relational database which tied various information about security vulnerabilities into a common, cross-referenced open security data source. As of December 2013, the database cataloged over 100,000 vulnerabilities. While the database was maintained by a 501(c)(3) non-profit public organization and volunteers, the data was prohibited for commercial use without a license. Despite that, many large commercial companies used the data in violation of the license without contributing employee volunteer time or financial compensation.

==History==
The project was started in August 2002 at the Blackhat and DEF CON Conferences by several industry notables (including H. D. Moore, rain.forest.puppy, and others). Under mostly-new management, the database officially launched to the public on March 31, 2004. The original implementation was written in PHP by Forrest Rae (FBR). Later, the entire site was re-written in Ruby on Rails by David Shettler.

The Open Security Foundation (OSF) was created to ensure the project&#x27;s continuing support. Jake Kouns (Zel), Chris Sullo, Kelly Todd (AKA Lyger), David Shettler (AKA D2D), and Brian Martin (AKA Jericho) were project leaders for the OSVDB project, and held leadership roles in the OSF at various times.

On 5 April 2016, the database was shut down, while the blog was initially continued by Brian Martin. The reason for the shut down was the ongoing commercial but uncompensated use by security companies.

As of January 2012, vulnerability entry was performed by full-time employees of Risk Based Security, who provided the personnel to do the work in order to give back to the community. Every new entry included a full title, disclosure timeline, description, solution (if known), classification metadata, references, products, and researcher who discovered the vulnerability (creditee).

==Process==
Originally, vulnerability disclosures posted in various security lists and web sites were entered into the database as a new entry in the New Data Mangler (NDM) queue. The new entry contained only a title and links to the disclosure. At that stage the page for the new entry didn&#x27;t contain any detailed description of the vulnerability or any associated metadata. As time permitted, new entries were analyzed and refined, by adding a description of the vulnerability as well as a solution if available. This general activity was called &quot;data mangling&quot; and someone who performed this task a &quot;mangler&quot;. Mangling was done by core or casual volunteers. Details submitted by volunteers were reviewed by the core volunteers, called &quot;moderators&quot;, further refining the entry or rejecting the volunteer changes if necessary. New information added to an entry that was approved was then available to anyone browsing the site.

<doc id="1300366" wikidata="Q888212" url="?curid=1300366" title="M-10000">
<text>The M-10000 was an early American streamlined passenger trainset that operated for the Union Pacific Railroad from 1934 until 1941. It was the first streamlined passenger train to be delivered in the United States, and the second to enter regular service after the &quot;Pioneer Zephyr&quot; of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad.

==Development==

The M-10000 car design built upon the efforts of William Bushnell Stout, an early designer of all-metal airplanes, who adapted fuselage design ideas to the &quot;Railplane&quot; (not to be confused with the &quot;Bennie Railplane&quot;), a lightweight self-propelled railcar built by Pullman-Standard in 1932. The tapered car cross-section, lightweight tubular aluminum space frame construction, and Duralumin skin of the &quot;Railplane&quot; were carried over into the M-10000 design. The performance of the &quot;Railplane&quot; in testing drew the attention of Union Pacific, who sought the services of Pullman-Standard in building a small, lightweight streamlined trainset for mainline service. Union Pacific ordered M-10000 from Pullman in May 1933 at a cost of $230,997, following an analysis of passenger traffic that concluded new, more cost effective equipment than heavyweight passenger cars and steam locomotives was required for maintaining profitability, especially on low-traffic routes. The streamlined body was developed from a series of wind tunnel tests that were carried out at the University of Michigan. 

The Electro-Motive Corporation (EMC) developed the internal combustion-electric propulsion system powered by a 600 hp spark-ignition engine. As was their practice as a system engineering firm at the time, they contracted manufacture of the components of their systems to primary equipment manufacturers. General Motors&#x27; Cleveland subsidiary, the Winton Engine Corporation, provided the prime mover. The air brake compressor, main generator, traction motors and control equipment were manufactured by the General Electric Company. Skepticism that development efforts for diesel engines underway in the early 1930s would provide timely release of an engine adequate for high speed rail service led to use of a spark-ignition distillate engine. Trucks were strongly influenced by German passenger bogie design, as investigated by Union Pacific chief engineer A.H. Fetters.

==Design==

The M-10000 was a three-car trainset, with a combined power/baggage/railway post office car and two trailing passenger coaches. The power car measured long, followed by coaches measuring and . Including the space between cars, the trainset had a total length of , with a width of and a height of at the cab; the coaches were shorter. The trainset was articulated using shared Jacobs bogies to reduce weight, making the train operate as one integrated unit rather than as a separable locomotive and cars. 
The integrated-body-and-frame construction using aluminum reduced the required structural weight to a fraction of that for conventional body-on-frame railcars, and the trainset&#x27;s total weight of was about the same as a single passenger coach of the time.

The power car featured an elevated &quot;turret cab&quot; behind a nose featuring a large vertically-divided air intake grille formed by parabolic arches. On the roof of the cab were a headlamp and a vertical marker light. The train was powered by a single spark-ignited distillate-burning engine built by the General Motors subsidiary Winton Engine Corporation driving a generator that powered two traction motors on the leading truck of the power car. The two passenger coaches each had a capacity of 60 people; the last coach also included a small galley at the rear end to prepare meals that were served at passengers&#x27; seats. Original livery consisted of Armour Yellow sides with a Leaf Brown nose, roof, rear, and lower panels, with red striping separating the two main colors. The nose was subsequently painted Armour Yellow consistent with other early Union Pacific streamliners.

==Service history==

The trainset was delivered on February 12, 1934, and was sent on a publicity tour across the US, during which about a million people toured it and its stops became local media sensations. During its exhibition tour across the US as &quot;The Streamliner&quot;, where it hit a top speed of 110 mph (177 km/h) during its journey, it visited Washington DC for inspection by Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The popular train was put on display at the 1934 World&#x27;s Fair (&quot;A Century of Progress&quot;) in Chicago from May 26 to October 31, 1934. It was somewhat overshadowed by the other lightweight streamliner, the diesel-powered &quot;Burlington Zephyr&quot;, which entered the fair after a record-setting &quot;Dawn to Dusk Dash&quot; speed run from Denver to Chicago, in time to arrive at the &quot;Wings of a Century&quot; transportation pageant. During its testing, demonstration, and display periods, the M-10000 trainset included the sleeper car &quot;Overland Trail,&quot; which was removed from the consist prior to revenue service and added to Union Pacific&#x27;s next streamliner, M-10001.

M-10000 was placed in revenue service between Kansas City, Missouri and Salina, Kansas as &quot;The Streamliner&quot; on January 31, 1935. It was subsequently named &quot;City of Salina&quot; as Union Pacific adopted the &quot;City of...&quot; convention for its new streamliners, but was also nicknamed the &quot;Tin Worm&quot; or &quot;Little Zip&quot;. It operated until December 1941, by which time its engine, after powering the train for approximately 995,000 miles, required replacement that was deemed prohibitively expensive. The trainset was scrapped the following year, with its aluminum recycled for use in the wartime aircraft industry.

==Legacy==
Union Pacific commissioned five diesel-powered streamliners during 1934–1936, evolved from the M-10000 design. The color scheme originated with M-10000 was used for UP&#x27;s later streamliners, and changed incrementally to the Armour Yellow and Harbor Mist Gray livery that became UP&#x27;s standard. The &quot;Streamliner&quot; name for M-10000 became the general term for locomotives and passenger trains styled with clean lines and an aerodynamic look. The high-mounted, behind-the-nose cab design originated with M-10000 was later adopted for EMC&#x27;s E-Series and F-Series locomotives, although without the front-mounted air intake. Integrated-body-and-frame, or carbody, designs became standard for rail equipment where weight was a concern, such as early mainline diesel locomotives, passenger cars, urban mass transit rail, and high speed passenger rail.

== In popular culture ==

In the 1937 children&#x27;s book &quot;Choo Choo: The Story Of An Engine Who Ran Away&quot; by Virginia Lee Burton, an M-10000 is cast as the streamliner train that helps Choo Choo&#x27;s crew pursue the title engine after she runs away. Once Choo Choo is found on an old unused track, her engineer, Jim, uses a chain to help the streamliner tow Choo Choo back to the big city as the M-10000 lacks couplers.

<text>The Kansas City Attack, previously the Atlanta Attack and later known as the Kansas City Comets, were an indoor soccer team based for most of its existence in Kansas City, Missouri. In its various incarnations the franchise played in the National Professional Soccer League from 1989–2001 and the second Major Indoor Soccer League from 2001–2005. They played their home games at the Municipal Auditorium and later Kemper Arena.

==History==
The franchise originated as the Atlanta Attack, which joined the American Indoor Soccer Association as an expansion team based in Atlanta, Georgia in 1989. In 1990 the league changed its name to the National Professional Soccer League. In 1991 the team relocated to Kansas City, Missouri, which had just lost its prolific Major Indoor Soccer League team, becoming the Kansas City Attack. The Attack played their first season at the Municipal Auditorium and moved into Kemper Arena in 1992.

The 1992–93 season was also the first of two national NPSL championship years for the Attack with Rookie Eddie Carmean scoring the game winning goal in the semi-final overtime to send the Attack to finals for the first time.

Kansas City was one of the more successful of the NPSL&#x27;s teams, though the league itself declined in the late 1990s. In 2001 the league disbanded, and Kansas City and the NPSL&#x27;s five other remaining teams formed a new league, the second Major Indoor Soccer League. At this time the team renamed itself the Kansas City Comets, after the city&#x27;s original indoor soccer team. In 2005 the franchise announced that it would not play in the 2005–2006 and 2006–2007 seasons, but hoped to reform thereafter. However, the team did not reorganize by the time the second MISL folded in 2008.

In 2010, the Missouri Comets, based in nearby Independence, joined the third Major Indoor Soccer League as an expansion team, carrying on the Comets name.

<doc id="1300375" wikidata="Q834195" url="?curid=1300375" title="Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe">
<text>The original Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) was negotiated and concluded during the last years of the Cold War and established comprehensive limits on key categories of conventional military equipment in Europe (from the Atlantic to the Urals) and mandated the destruction of excess weaponry. The treaty proposed equal limits for the two &quot;groups of states-parties&quot;, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact. In 2007, Russia &quot;suspended&quot; its participation in the treaty, and on 10 March 2015, citing NATO&#x27;s alleged &quot;de facto&quot; breach of the Treaty, Russia formally announced it was &quot;completely&quot; halting its participation in it as of the next day. On 7 November 2023, Russia withdrew from the treaty, and in response the United States and its NATO allies suspended their participation in the treaty.

==History==

===Background===
In 1972, US president Richard Nixon and Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev reached a compromise agreement to hold separate political and military negotiations. The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) would deal with political issues, and Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions (MBFR) with military issues. The CSCE resulted in 1975 in 35 nations signing the concluding document: the Helsinki Final Act. Negotiations for MBFR were stalled by the USSR in 1979 because of NATO&#x27;s decision to deploy new intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe. In 1986, Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev proposed in the context of MBFR negotiations to reduce ground and air forces, and to include conventional and nuclear weapons from the Atlantic to the Urals. This proposal was formalized later that year during a Warsaw Treaty meeting. NATO&#x27;s North Atlantic Council of foreign ministers issued the Brussels Declaration on Conventional Arms Control, which called for two distinct sets of negotiations: one to build on the Confidence and Security-Building Measures (CSBM) results of the Stockholm Conference and the other to establish conventional stability in Europe through negotiations on conventional arms control from the Atlantic to the Urals (ATTU). In 1987, the Stockholm Document entered into force and for the first time provided a negotiated right to conduct on-site inspections of military forces in the field.

Informal talks between the 16 NATO and the 7 Warsaw Treaty nations began in Vienna on 17 February 1987 on a mandate for conventional negotiations in Europe, which would set out the treaty negotiating guidelines. Several months later, on 27 June, NATO presented a draft mandate during the 23-nation conference in Vienna. The mandate called for elimination of force disparities, capability for surprise attack, and large-scale offensive operations, and the establishment of an effective verification system. Meanwhile, in December the INF Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union was signed, effectively allowing mutual inspections. During the May–June 1988 Moscow Summit, US President Ronald Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev emphasized the importance of stability and security in Europe, specifically calling for data exchange, verification of these data, and then reductions. In December 1988, Gorbachev announced in the United Nations a unilateral withdrawal of 50,000 troops from Eastern Europe, and demobilization of 500,000 Soviet troops.

===CFE negotiations===
In January 1989, NATO and the Warsaw Treaty members produced the Mandate for the Negotiation on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. The mandate set out objectives for the CFE Treaty and established negotiating principles, and formal negotiations began on 9 March 1989 in Vienna. When US President George H. W. Bush and France&#x27;s President François Mitterrand met in May, Bush announced the acceptance of reductions of combat aircraft and helicopters. He also proposed a ceiling of 275,000 personnel stationed in Europe by the US and Soviet Union. Bush&#x27;s proposal was formally adopted during the 1989 Brussels NATO summit and subsequently presented in Vienna. 

In July, the 1989 Polish legislative election held in accord with the Polish Round Table Agreement resulted in the appointment on 24 August 1989 of the first non-communist Prime Minister, considered an effective end of communist rule in Poland, followed in November by the fall of the Berlin Wall in Germany. In the following months revolutions broke out in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and Albania. Bush and Gorbachev agreed to speed up arms control and economic negotiations. Bush proposed even steeper reductions, and the Soviet Union negotiated and concluded troop withdrawal agreements with Warsaw Treaty states. The ensuing German reunification would lead to the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany linked to the CFE treaty by specifying that certain military limits imposed on Germany would come into force upon the conclusion of the CFE Treaty.

The text of the treaty was approved by the 22 negotiating states on 15 November 1990 in Vienna.

The Vienna Document on confidence- and security-building measures, also first adopted in 1990, and the CFE Treaty, were seen as parallel peace process components by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

===1990 signature ceremony in Paris===

The Treaty was signed in Paris on November 19, 1990 by 22 countries. These were divided into two groups: 
*the then-16 NATO members: the United States, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and Belgium.
*the then-six Warsaw Treaty states: Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the Soviet Union

===Ratification===

The treaty entered into force on 9 November 1992. In 1991 the USSR and the Warsaw Treaty dissolved and Czechoslovakia was in the middle of splitting into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which explains why the treaty was ratified by 30 rather than 22 states:
*The then-16 NATO members
*The eight former USSR republics that have territory west of the Urals. These former USSR republics include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine. 
*the six former Warsaw Treaty members: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania. 

=== Military blocs reshuffle in Europe and former Soviet Union===
In 1994, the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) was formed and currently includes Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, as well as Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, though the latter two states did not join the treaty, while Russia suspended its participation in 2015. In September 2022, the lack of Russian support during the Armenia–Azerbaijan border clashes prompted a national debate in Armenia, as an increasing percentage of the population put into doubt whether it is beneficial to continue CSTO membership, calling for realignment of the state with NATO instead.

In contrast, most former non-USSR Warsaw Treaty members subsequently joined NATO, followed later by the Baltic states and the states of the former Yugoslavia (except Serbia, Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina) which however did not join the treaty. Furthermore, the former Soviet Union republics of Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine, also aspire to join.

Azerbaijan in turn balances between the blocs without joining any.

===1996 amendment===
On 31 May 1996, the treaty was amended by the so-called flank agreement, which relaxed the restrictions for Russia and Ukraine in the flank region defined in Article V, subparagraph 1(A) of the treaty.

=== 2007–2015 partial suspension of Russian participation ===
On 14 July 2007, Vladimir Putin announced that Russia would suspend implementation of its Treaty obligations, effective after 150 days. Moscow continued to participate in the JCG, because it hoped that dialogue could lead to the creation of an effective, new conventional arms control regime in Europe.

In 2007 Russia specified steps that NATO could take to end the suspension. &quot;These include [NATO] members cutting their arms allotments and further restricting temporary weapons deployments on each NATO member&#x27;s territory. Russia also want[ed] constraints eliminated on how many forces it can deploy in its southern and northern flanks. Moreover, it is pressing NATO members to ratify a 1999 updated version of the accord, known as the Adapted CFE Treaty, and demanding that the four alliance members outside the original treaty, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Slovenia, join it.&quot;

===2015 indefinite total withdrawal of Russian participation ===
In March 2015, the Russian Federation announced that it had taken the decision to completely withdraw its participation in the Treaty. Russian diplomat Mikhail Ulyanov said Russia would be unlikely to return to compliance because the accord, &quot;created when the Warsaw Pact was still in existence, is &#x27;anachronistic&#x27; and &#x27;absolutely out of sync with the present realities.

=== 2023 Russia denounces TCAFE ===
On 7 November 2023 Russia denounced the TCAFE. On the same day in response NATO announced its members would suspend participation. 

=== 2024 suspension of Greek participation ===
On 9 February 2024, Greece suspended its particiation in the TCAFE.

=== 2024 suspension of Polish participation ===
On 29 March 2024, President Duda of Poland suspended his country&#x27;s participation in the TCAFE. This had been foreseen by the NATO statement, and the vote in the Sejm.

=== 2024 suspension of Turkish participation ===
On 5 April 2024, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan issued a presidential decree that suspended the Turkish participation in the treaty.

== Content ==
===Arms ceilings===
The CFE Treaty set equal ceilings for each bloc (NATO and the Warsaw Treaty Organization), from the Atlantic to the Urals, on key armaments essential for conducting surprise attacks and initiating large-scale offensive operations. Collectively, the treaty participants agreed that neither side could have more than:
* 20,000 tanks;
* 20,000 artillery pieces;
* 30,000 armored combat vehicles (ACVs);
* 6,800 combat aircraft; and
* 2,000 attack helicopters.

To further limit the readiness of armed forces, the treaty set equal ceilings on equipment that could be deployed with active units. Other ground equipment had to be place in designated permanent storage sites. The limits for equipment each side could have in active units were:
* 16,500 tanks;
* 17,000 artillery pieces; and
* 27,300 armored combat vehicles (ACVs);

The treaty further limited the proportion of armaments that could be held by any one country in Europe to about one-third of the total for all countries in Europe – the &quot;sufficiency&quot; rule.

All sea-based Naval forces were excluded from CFE Treaty accountability.

===Regional arrangements===
In addition to limits on the number of armaments in each category on each side, the treaty included regional limits intended to prevent destabilizing force concentrations of ground equipment.

===Destruction===
To meet required troop ceilings, equipment had to be destroyed or, if possible, converted to non-military purposes.

===Verification===
The treaty included unprecedented provisions for detailed information exchanges, on-site inspections, challenge inspections, and on-site monitoring of destruction. Treaty parties received an unlimited right to monitor the process of destruction. Satellite surveillance was used to verify placement and progress on destruction of large military equipment like vehicles and tanks.

===Joint Consultative Group===
Finally, the Treaty established in Vienna a body composed of all Treaty members, which was called the Joint Consultative Group (JCG), and which dealt with questions relating to compliance with the provisions of the Treaty. The group aimed to:
* Resolve ambiguities and differences in interpretation
* Consider measures that enhance the Treaty&#x27;s viability and effectiveness
* Resolve technical questions
* Look into disputes that may arise from the Treaty&#x27;s implementation

==Implementation==
After the treaty entered into force, a 4-month baseline inspection period began. Twenty-five percent of the destruction had to be completed by the end of 1 year, 60% by the end of 2 years, and all destruction required by the treaty completed by the end of 3 years.

The principal accomplishment was the large-scale reduction or destruction of conventional military equipment in the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains (ATTU) region during the first 5 years the Treaty was in effect. By the end of the Treaty&#x27;s reduction period in 1995, when equipment limits took effect, the 30 States Parties completed and verified by inspection the destruction or conversion of over 52,000 battle tanks, armored combat vehicles, artillery pieces, combat aircraft and attack helicopters. In addition, they have conducted/accepted over 4,000 intrusive on-site inspections of military units/installations, and of specified areas.

NATO mostly fulfilled its obligations by destroying its oldest equipment. Also, NATO members with newer equipment, such as the United States, agreed to transfer some of this equipment to allies with older equipment.

===Compliance ===

====NATO====
In 2007, the United States&#x27; plans to create bases in Romania and Bulgaria constituted, according to Russia, a breach of the treaty. NATO officials disputed this and stated that the US bases were not intended as permanent and thus could not be seen as a breach. However, it was then reported that the agreements signed with both Romania and Bulgaria in 2006 specifically allowed for &quot;permanent&quot; bases under direct US control and &quot;The Washington Times&quot; also had obtained the confirmation of a senior United States official that the facilities were intended to be permanent.

====Former Soviet republics====
A June 1998 Clinton administration report stated that Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Armenia and Azerbaijan were not in compliance with the CFE treaty. Violations ranged from holdings of treaty-limited equipment (TLE) in excess of CFE ceilings to denial of full access during treaty inspections. The report concluded that the compliance issues were not &quot;militarily significant&quot; and Russia and Ukraine, the former USSR republics with the largest holdings among the Eastern bloc, remained within their treaty limits.

In the run-up to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe&#x27;s (OSCE) November 1999 Istanbul summit, NATO members perceived three treaty compliance problems. First of all, the continuing existence of Russian equipment holdings in the &quot;flank&quot; region (i.e. Russia&#x27;s North Caucasus Military District) were in excess of agreed treaty limits. Secondly, the Russian military presence in Georgia was beyond the level authorised by the Georgian authorities. Thirdly, the Russian military presence in Moldova lacked the explicit consent of the Moldovan authorities. During the summit, 30 OSCE members signed the adapted CFE treaty and Russia assumed an obligation to withdraw from the Republic of Moldova, reduce her equipment levels in Georgia and agree with the Georgian authorities on the modalities and duration of the Russian forces stationed on the territory of Georgia, and reduce their forces in the flanks to the agreed levels of the Adapted CFE Treaty. These agreements became known as the &quot;Istanbul Commitments&quot; and were contained in 14 Annexes to the CFE Final Act and within the 1999 Istanbul Summit Declaration. NATO members however refused to ratify the treaty as long as Russia refused, as they saw it, to completely withdraw its troops from Moldovan and Georgian soil. While Russia partially withdrew troops and equipment from Georgia and Moldova, it did not do so completely as requested by NATO.

===== South Caucasus =====
According to a 2019 report, Azerbaijan continues to significantly violate the treaty. In its data as of 1 January 2018, Azerbaijan declared equipment totals that exceeded its overall limits by over 900 pieces of Treaty-Limited Equipment:

* over 300 battle tanks in excess of Azerbaijan&#x27;s limit of 220 battle tanks, surpassing 136% of the limit,
* over 160 armored combat vehicles (ACV) in excess of Azerbaijan&#x27;s limit of 220 ACVs, surpassing 72% of the limit,
* over 670 artillery pieces in excess of Azerbaijan&#x27;s limit of 285 artillery pieces surpassing 235% of the limit,
*over 5 attack helicopters in excess of Azerbaijan&#x27;s limit of 50 attack helicopters surpassing 10% of the limit.

In May 2019, Armenia dismantled and decommissioned 21 armored combat vehicles in accordance with the requirements of treaty.

==Follow-up agreements==

===Concluding Act of the Negotiation on Personnel Strength of Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE-1A)===
CFE-1A negotiations began shortly after the original CFE Treaty was signed in 1990. CFE-1A was unlike the original CFE treaty not a legally binding treaty, but a political commitment that simultaneously came into force with the CFE treaty and served as a follow-up agreement. The commitment was that all signatories of the CFE Treaty would undertake steps to improve further confidence and security in the ATTU region. CFE-1A committed the 30 members of the treaty to establish manpower limits and, if deemed necessary, to reduce the existing manpower levels within the CFE area of application to reach these limits. The United States was limited under this commitment to have no more than 250,000 troops in the area of application. As an additional source of security assurance, the CFE-1A agreement required the parties to provide advanced notification of any increases made to the force levels. The compliance with the CFE-1A agreement by a member was evaluated during on-site inspections conducted under the CFE Treaty.

===Agreement on Adaptation of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE-II)===
The Agreement on Adaptation of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (also known as the adapted CFE treaty) was a revision of the original treaty and was signed during the November 1999 Istanbul summit and took into account the different geopolitical situation of the post-Cold War era by setting national instead of bloc-based limits on conventional armed forces. NATO members refused however to ratify the treaty so long as Russia refused to completely withdraw its troops from Moldovan and Georgian soil. While Russia partially withdrew troops and equipment from Georgia and Moldova, it did not do so completely as demanded by NATO. The linkage between the ratification of the adapted treaty and the complete withdrawal was a political decision made by NATO members based on fundamental principles of international law pertaining to the territorial integrity of sovereign states.

==2007 suspension by the Russian Federation==
After the Russian Federation was not willing to support the US missile defense plans in Europe, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for &quot;moratorium&quot; on the treaty in his address on 26 April 2007. Then he raised most of his points for rewriting the treaty during the Extraordinary Conference of States Parties to the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe, held in Vienna on 11–15 June at Russia&#x27;s initiative. As his requests were not met during this conference, Putin issued a decree intended to suspend the observance of its treaty obligations on 14 July 2007, effective 150 days later, stating that it was the result of &quot;extraordinary circumstances ... which affect the security of the Russian Federation and require immediate measures&quot;, and notified NATO and its members. The suspension applies to the original CFE treaty, as well as to the follow-up agreements.

===Motives===
An explanatory document from Russia&#x27;s presidential administration outlined several reasons for its original suspension of compliance in 2007. First of all, Russia considered the linkage between the adapted treaty ratification and the withdrawal of troops from Georgia and Moldova as &quot;illegitimate&quot; and &quot;invented&quot;. Russia also considered the troop-withdrawal issue a bilateral Russia–Georgia and Russia–Moldova issue, not a NATO–Russia issue. Secondly, the three Baltic states, which border Russia unlike the rest of NATO (excluding Poland and Norway), were not covered under the original CFE treaty as they were still occupied by the Soviet Union when the treaty was signed. Also, the Baltic states like all NATO members did not ratify the adapted CFE treaty. Russia&#x27;s request for a ratification and accession of the Baltic states to a ratified treaty was not fulfilled.

Thirdly, Russia emphasized that NATO&#x27;s 1999 and 2004 enlargements increased the alliance&#x27;s equipment above the treaty limits. Consequently, Russia demanded a &quot;compensatory lowering&quot; of overall NATO numerical ceilings on such equipment. Fourthly, Russia mentioned that the then planned basing of U.S. military units in Romania and Bulgaria &quot;negatively affects&quot; those countries&#x27; compliance with the CFE Treaty&#x27;s force ceilings. Fifthly, the document demanded a &quot;removal&quot; of the flank (i.e., North Caucasian) ceilings on Russian forces by a &quot;political decision&quot; between NATO and Russia, ostensibly to &quot;compensate&quot; Russia for the alliance&#x27;s enlargement. Sixthly, Russia wanted to re-negotiate and &quot;modernize&quot; the 1999–adapted CFE treaty as soon as it was brought into force. Russia&#x27;s position was that it would proceed unilaterally to suspend the treaty&#x27;s validity unless NATO countries brought the updated version into force by 1 July 2008, or at least complied with its terms on a temporary basis, pending a re-negotiation of the treaty.

Most likely, but not mentioned in Russia&#x27;s explanatory document, the above-mentioned &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot; referred to the US plans for a missile defense complex in Poland, with a radar component in the Czech Republic. Another likely reason is that NATO members refused to ratify the Adapted CFE Treaty due to the continuing presence of several hundred Russian troops in Moldova—something they considered as a violation of the obligations Russia assumed during the 1999 Istanbul summit. However, there was no legal connection between the Adapted CFE treaty and the Russian withdrawal from Georgia and Moldova. The linkage between these two security issues was a decision made by NATO member states to protest against the Second Chechen War and was used as a reason not to ratify the treaty. Russia never accepted this decision—a decision also made six months after the Istanbul summit. Russia also considered the original CFE treaty to be outdated and strategically flawed as it did not take into account the dissolutions of the Warsaw Treaty or the Soviet Union.

In Russia, even Vladimir Ryzhkov, an opposition leader and an independent member of the Duma, agreed that Russia had been forced to respond. However, he also speculated that Putin&#x27;s suspension by decree was &quot;primarily an election-year message to the country: &#x27;Your leader won&#x27;t budge, no matter who formally becomes next President&#x27;.&quot;

===Reactions===
NATO immediately expressed regret over Russia&#x27;s decision to suspend the treaty, describing it as &quot;a step in the wrong direction&quot;, but hoped to engage Moscow in what was described as constructive talks on this issue. The United States along with European states such as Germany, Poland and Romania also expressed their disappointment. Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) General Secretary Nikolai Bordyuzha and former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev expressed support for Putin&#x27;s decree. On 25 November 2011, the UK stopped sharing military data with Russia.

The Russian Foreign Ministry also said that the consequences of the suspension would be the halting of inspections and verifications of its military sites by NATO countries and that it would no longer have the obligation to limit the number of its conventional weapons. In practice, Russia had already halted such verification visits in June 2007 after an extraordinary CFE treaty conference held in Vienna turned a deaf ear to Russia&#x27;s complaints. Consequently, military delegations from Bulgaria and Hungary had been denied entry to Russian military units.

Yuri Zarakhovich speculated in &quot;Time&quot; that the above-mentioned &quot;immediate measures&quot; would be a build-up of its forces in areas bordering NATO eastern members, in particular Poland and the Baltic states. &quot;Time&quot; further speculated at the time that other measures could include troop buildups along southern borders in the Caucasus, new pressures on Ukraine to maintain the Russian Black Sea Fleet in the Crimea beyond the (then planned) 2017 withdrawal deadline, and a refusal to leave Moldova.

<text>Grazide Lizier née Fauré (fl. 1321) was a peasant in the Comté de Foix in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth century. Her home region was known for being Cathar, and, during an anti-Cathar inquisition carried out by Catholic authorities, she was interrogated. A number of facts about her are recorded in the Fournier Register, and her life, along with those of her fellow villagers, was analyzed in Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie&#x27;s &quot;Montaillou&quot;.

Grazide was the daughter of Pons and Frabrisse Rives. Her mother was the town wine seller. At the age of fifteen or sixteen she became mistress to Pierre Clergue, the local priest, who, though Grazide insisted she hadn&#x27;t known at the time, was allegedly her mother&#x27;s illegitimate cousin. Clergue was known as a local rake, and had many sexual relationships with many women.

A year later, at Clergue&#x27;s behest, Grazide married an elderly local, Pierre Lizier of Montaillou. The affair between her and Clergue continued, however, with the consent of her husband. The marriage lasted only four years with Pierre Lizier dying when Grazide was twenty. Soon after,Grazide also ended the relationship with Pierre Clergue.

During her testimony, Grazide stated that she had not believed that having sex with Clergue was a sin. For one thing, Clergue, being a priest, had told her it was not a sin. But, more than that, she simply stated that because she had liked it, and Pierre had liked it, it could not have offended God, so it could not have been a sin. 

It is not known what happened to Grazide after her testimony.

<doc id="1300385" wikidata="Q2407695" url="?curid=1300385" title="Texas v. White">
<text>Texas v. White, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 700 (1869), was a case argued before the Supreme Court of the U.S. in 1869. The case&#x27;s notable political dispute involved a claim by the Reconstruction era government of Texas that U.S. bonds owned by Texas since 1850 had been illegally sold by the Confederate state legislature during the American Civil War. The state filed suit in the U.S. Supreme Court, given that, under the Constitution, that institution has original jurisdiction on certain cases in which a state is a party.

In accepting original jurisdiction, the court ruled that, legally speaking, Texas was and remained a state of the United States ever since it first joined the Union in 1845, despite it later purporting to join the Confederate States of America and despite it being under military rule at the time of the decision in the case. In deciding the merits of the bond issue, the court further held that the Constitution did not permit states to unilaterally secede from the United States, and that the ordinances of secession, and all the acts of the legislatures within seceding states intended to give effect to such ordinances, were &quot;absolutely null&quot;. The purported bond sale during the civil war was thus void and the reconstructed Texas remained the legal owner.

==Background==
===Secession and bond sales===

On February 1, 1861, the Texas secession convention drafted and approved an Ordinance of Secession. This ordinance was subsequently approved by both the state legislature and a statewide referendum. On January 11, 1862, the state legislature approved the creation of a military board to address issues involved in the transition in the shift in loyalty from the United States to the Confederate States.

Texas had received $10 million in United States bonds in settlement of border claims as a part of the Compromise of 1850. While many of the bonds were sold, there were still some unsold in 1861. Needing money, the legislature authorized the sale of the remaining bonds. Existing state law required that the Texas governor sign his endorsement on any bonds that were sold, but the state feared that the sale price would be depressed if the United States Treasury refused to honor bonds sold by a Confederate state. The legislature therefore repealed the requirement for the governor&#x27;s endorsement in order to hide the origin of the bonds.

Before the bonds were sold, a Texas Unionist notified the Treasury which ran a legal notice in the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; that it would not honor any bonds from Texas unless they were endorsed by the prewar governor (Sam Houston). Despite the warning, 136 bonds were purchased by a brokerage owned by George W. White and John Chiles. Although this sale probably occurred earlier, the written confirmation of the transaction was not executed until January 12, 1865. The bonds were in the meantime resold to several individuals, one or more of whom were able to successfully redeem the bonds through the United States government.

With the end of the war, President Andrew Johnson appointed a temporary governor, Andrew J. Hamilton, and ordered Texas to create a new state constitution and form a new state government loyal to the Union. James W. Throckmorton was elected governor under this process. Throckmorton was in office for a year before General Philip Sheridan, the military commander of the Military District of the Southwest, dismissed him for being an &quot;impediment to the reconstruction of the State&quot;, appointing Elisha M. Pease in his place. Pease was a Republican who had lost to Throckmorton in the election.

As the United States Treasury Department became aware of the situation regarding the bonds, it refused to redeem those bonds sold by White and Chiles. After the state realized that it was no longer in possession of the bonds, it determined that the bonds had been sold illicitly to finance the rebellion against the United States. All three of the governors, in order to regain ownership of the bonds for the state, approved filing a lawsuit under Article III, Section 2 of the United States Constitution which granted original jurisdiction to the Supreme Court in all cases &quot;in which a State shall be a party&quot;. The case, filed on February 15, 1867, appeared on the docket as &quot;The State of Texas, Compt., v. George W. White, John Chiles, John A. Hardenburg, Samuel Wolf, George W. Stewart, the Branch of the Commercial Bank of Kentucky, Weston F. Birch, Byron Murray, Jr., and Shaw.&quot;

John Chiles, who was being sued along with White, argued that he could not be sued because Texas lacked evidence. He claimed the bond documents were destroyed by soldiers and that there was no way to get them back. White believed therefore, that he should not have to reimburse the state of Texas.

===Reconstruction politics===

By the time the suit was filed, the radical faction of Republicans in Congress opposed President Johnson&#x27;s policy in Reconstruction. Radicals opposed the creation of provisional state governments, and moderates were frustrated by a number of lawsuits instigated by provisional Southern governors attempting to obstruct congressional reconstruction. Increasingly, Republicans were abandoning Lincoln&#x27;s position that the states had never left the Union, preferring to treat the South as conquered provinces totally subject to Congressional rule. They hoped that the Supreme Court would reject jurisdiction in the case by claiming that there was no legally recognized government in Texas.

Democrats, on the other hand, wanted the Court to acknowledge the existence of an official state government in Texas. Such a ruling would have the effect of accepting Texas as fully restored to its place in the Union and render the Military Reconstruction Act unconstitutional. Wall Street was also concerned with the case, opposing any actions that threatened bondholders and investors.

==Arguments==

Twelve attorneys represented Texas and the various defendants in the case. Arguments before the Supreme Court were made over three days on February 5, 8 and 9, 1869.

===State of Texas, Plaintiff ===

The complaint filed by Texas claimed ownership of the bonds and requested that the defendants turn the bonds over to the state. Texas&#x27;s attorneys disputed the legitimacy of the Confederate state legislature that had allowed the bonds to be sold. In response to an issue raised by the defendants, Texas differentiated between those acts of the legislature necessary &quot;to preserve the social community from anarchy and to maintain order&quot; (such as marriages and routine criminal and civil matters) and those &quot;designed to promote the Confederacy or that were in violation of the U.S. Constitution&quot;.

Texas argued that it was a well established legal principle that if the original transfer to White and Chiles was invalid, then the subsequent transfers were also invalid. Chiles and White might be liable to such purchasers and any purchasers who had successfully redeemed the bonds were liable for a personal judgment in favor of the state for the amount they received.

===Defendants===

The attorneys for Chiles first raised the issue of jurisdiction. They claimed that the section of the Constitution granting the Supreme Court original jurisdiction did not apply. Texas&#x27;s current situation was not that of a state as contemplated by the Founders, but was that of a territory secured by military conquest. Residents of Texas were subject to military rule and had no representation in Congress and no constitutional rights.

Chiles&#x27;s attorneys also argued that the sale of the bonds itself, even if conducted by a revolutionary government, was not in violation of the Constitution. Their sale was for the benefit of the people of the state, and the people, simply because they now had a different government, could not decide to invalidate the predecessor government&#x27;s actions. They rejected the notion that the people of the state and the state itself were legally separate entities. As long as the people had chosen to act through representatives it was irrelevant who those representatives were.

James Mandeville Carlisle, the attorney for Hardenburg, argued that, since his client had purchased his bonds on the open market in New York, he had no way of knowing about any possible questions concerning the validity of his title. Carlisle further stated that the precedents recognizing that the decisions of the &quot;revolutionary&quot; government would be binding on any subsequent governments were &quot;universally admitted in the public law of nations&quot;.

White&#x27;s attorney, P. Phillips, argued that, if the bond sales were invalid, then all actions of the state government during the war were null and void. He stated that &quot;civilized government recognizes the necessity of government at all times&quot;. Phillips concluded his presentation by stating that, if, in fact, Texas had acted illegally during the war, then a subsequent government had no right to appeal that illegality to the Supreme Court.

==Decision==
===Majority opinion===

The court delivered its opinion (with five justices supporting and three dissenting) on April 12, 1869. Chief Justice Salmon Chase, a former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury under President Abraham Lincoln, first addressed a procedural issue raised in the original filings claiming that the state lacked the authority to prosecute the case. Chase ruled that the approval by any one of the three governors of the original bill submitted to the court was sufficient to authorize the action.

Chase wrote that the original Union of the colonies had been made in reaction to very real problems faced by the colonists. The first result of these circumstances was the creation of the Articles of Confederation, which established a perpetual union between these states. The Constitution, when implemented, only strengthened and perfected this relationship. Chase wrote:

The Union of the States never was a purely artificial and arbitrary relation. It began among the Colonies, and grew out of common origin, mutual sympathies, kindred principles, similar interests, and geographical relations. It was confirmed and strengthened by the necessities of war, and received definite form and character and sanction from the Articles of Confederation. By these, the Union was solemnly declared to &quot;be perpetual&quot;. And when these Articles were found to be inadequate to the exigencies of the country, the Constitution was ordained &quot;to form a more perfect Union&quot;. It is difficult to convey the idea of indissoluble unity more clearly than by these words. What can be indissoluble if a perpetual Union, made more perfect, is not?

After establishing the origin of the nation, Chase next addressed Texas&#x27;s relationship to that Union. He rejected the notion that Texas had merely created a compact with the other states; rather, he said, it had in fact incorporated itself into an existing indissoluble political body. From the decision:
When, therefore, Texas became one of the United States, she entered into an indissoluble relation. All the obligations of perpetual union, and all the guaranties of republican government in the Union, attached at once to the State. The act which consummated her admission into the Union was something more than a compact; it was the incorporation of a new member into the political body. And it was final. The union between Texas and the other States was as complete, as perpetual, and as indissoluble as the union between the original States. There was no place for reconsideration or revocation, except through revolution or through consent of the States.

For these reasons, Texas had never been outside the Union and any state actions taken to declare secession or implement the Ordinance of Secession were null and void. The rights of the state itself, as well as the rights of Texans as citizens of the United States, remained unimpaired. From the decision:

Considered therefore as transactions under the Constitution, the ordinance of secession, adopted by the convention and ratified by a majority of the citizens of Texas, and all the acts of her legislature intended to give effect to that ordinance, were absolutely null. They were utterly without operation in law. The obligations of the State, as a member of the Union, and of every citizen of the State, as a citizen of the United States, remained perfect and unimpaired. It certainly follows that the State did not cease to be a State, nor her citizens to be citizens of the Union. If this were otherwise, the State must have become foreign, and her citizens foreigners. The war must have ceased to be a war for the suppression of rebellion, and must have become a war for conquest and subjugation.

However, the state&#x27;s suspension of the prewar government did require the United States to put down the rebellion and reestablish the proper relationship between Texas and the federal government. These obligations were created by the Constitution in its grant of the power to suppress insurrections and the responsibility to insure for every state a republican form of government. From the decision:

The authority for the performance of the first had been found in the power to suppress insurrection and carry on war; for the performance of the second, authority was derived from the obligation of the United States to guarantee to every State in the Union a republican form of government. The latter, indeed, in the case of a rebellion which involves the government of a State and for the time excludes the National authority from its limits, seems to be a necessary complement to the former.

Having settled the jurisdiction issue, Chase moved on to the question of who owned title to the bonds. In previous circuit court cases, Chase had recognized the validity of legislative decisions intended solely to maintain peace and order within Southern society. He had recognized the validity of &quot;marriage licenses, market transactions, and other day-to-day acts legally sanctioned by the Confederate state governments.&quot; However, he clearly treated actions in furtherance of the war effort in a different light. From the decision:

It is not necessary to attempt any exact definitions within which the acts of such a State government must be treated as valid or invalid. It may be said, perhaps with sufficient accuracy, that acts necessary to peace and good order among citizens, such for example, as acts sanctioning and protecting marriage and the domestic relations, governing the course of descents, regulating the conveyance and transfer of property, real and personal, and providing remedies for injuries to person and estate, and other similar acts, which would be valid if emanating from a lawful government must be regarded in general as valid when proceeding from an actual, though unlawful, government, and that acts in furtherance or support of rebellion against the United States, or intended to defeat the just rights of citizens, and other acts of like nature, must, in general, be regarded as invalid and void.

Chase ruled that the state&#x27;s relationship with White and Chiles &quot;was therefore treasonable and void&quot;. Consequently, he ordered that the current state of Texas retained ownership of the bonds and was entitled either to the return of the bonds or to the payment of a cash equivalent from those who had redeemed the bonds.

===Dissenting opinion===

Justice Robert Grier wrote a dissent in which he stated that he disagreed &quot;on all points raised and decided&quot; by the majority. Grier relied on the case &quot;Hepburn v. Ellzey&quot; (1805) in which Chief Justice John Marshall had defined a state as an entity entitled to representatives in both Congress and the Electoral College. Thus, Texas&#x27;s status had become more analogous to an Indian tribe than to a state. He also believed that the issue of Texas statehood was a matter for congressional rather than judicial determination, and he was &quot;not disposed to join in any essay to prove Texas to be a State of the Union when Congress had decided that she is not&quot;. Justice Grier said that Texas&#x27;s claim that she was not a state during the Civil War was the equivalent of making a &quot;plea of insanity&quot; and asking the court to now overrule all her acts &quot;made during the disease&quot;. Justices Noah Swayne and Samuel F. Miller also dissented.

The dissenting justices rejected the majority opinion for different reasons. Grier, a &quot;doughface&quot; from Pennsylvania, was opposed to Radical Reconstruction and was primarily concerned with the bondholders. He felt that the Treasury lost any control over the bonds immediately after they were issued. Miller and Swayne were more sympathetic than Chase to the radical position. In a separate dissent they agreed with the majority that the bonds had been sold illegally by the secessionist government, but agreed with Grier that the current state of Texas was not a state within the meaning of the Constitution.

==Reaction==

The Court&#x27;s decision, written by Chase, was criticized by both sides. Radical Republicans saw this as evidence that Chase was abandoning a cause he had once enthusiastically supported. Conservatives condemned Chase for a decision that would allow congressional reconstruction to continue.

In December, Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull, using the Miller–Swayne dissent as his model, introduced legislation to overcome the &quot;White&quot; decision. Trumbull&#x27;s bill stated that &quot;under the Constitution, the judicial power of the United States does not embrace political power, or give to judicial tribunals any authority to question the political departments of the Government on political questions&quot;. In a direct attack on Chase&#x27;s position the bill stipulated that &quot;it rests with Congress to decide what Government is the established one in a State, and that it is hereby, in accordance with former legislation, declared that no civil State Government exists in Virginia, Mississippi, or Texas.&quot; The legislation was defeated by the more conservative members of Congress.

Aleksandar Pavković and Peter Radan in &quot;Creating New States: Theory and Practice of Secession&quot; state &quot;&#x27;There was no place for reconsideration or revocation, except through revolution or through consent of the States&#x27; was not surprising. Given that the United States was born from revolution, Chase&#x27;s words echo what had been stated by many legal scholars and politicians of the day, including Abraham Lincoln and Daniel Webster.&quot;

<text>Athens Kallithea Football Club or simply Kallithea is a Greek professional football club based in Kallithea, a city and a suburb in Athens. The club currently competes in the Super League, the top tier of the Greek football league system.

The club has finished as high as ninth in the Greek top flight (2004–05) and has reached as far as the quarterfinal stage of the Greek Cup on five occasions (1969–70, 1978–79, 1986–87, 2001–02, 2009–10).

==History==

===Founding and early history===
The club was founded on 18 August 1966 from the merger of five local clubs: Esperos, Iraklis, AE Kallitheas, Kallithaikos, and Pyrsos.

In 1970, Kallithea&#x27;s Grigoris Lambrakis Stadium, named after the Greek liberal politician and peace activist Grigoris Lambrakis, was opened to the public.

=== Promotion to the first division ===

On 28 April 2002, Kallithea clinched their first-ever promotion to Greece&#x27;s top division with a 0-1 win over Chalkidona FC at Neapoli Stadium on a goal by Theofanis Gekas.

The club&#x27;s first win in the competition was a 3–2 upset of PAOK at Toumba Stadium, thanks to two goals from Gekas, on 14 September 2002.

After four seasons in the top flight, Kallithea were relegated in the 2005-06 season.

===Recent history (2021 to present) ===
In August 2021, New York-born Greek-American Ted Philipakos, a former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Brand Officer at Venezia FC, led the takeover of Kallithea FC with his brother and former professional footballer Peter Philipakos and investor Andrew Barroway.

In the 2021-22 season, Kallithea finished second in Super League 2, seven points back of league winners Levadiakos for promotion to Super League 1, which was the club&#x27;s most successful season since it last appeared in the top division in 2005–06.

In September 2022, the club rebranded as Athens Kallithea FC. The presentation of the club&#x27;s rebranding was met with widespread acclaim in Greece and abroad, with London-based Versus calling it &quot;one of the cleanest football rebrands ever.&quot;

In the 2022-23 season, AKFC missed out on promotion to Super League 1 by one point, finishing second in Super League 2 for the second consecutive season.

After two consecutive second-place finishes, AKFC were crowned 2023-24 Super League 2 South Group champions and was promoted to Super League Greece.

==Crest and colors==
The first crest of Kallithea consisted of four circles representing the four groups of the merger of 1966, then becoming five circles with the addition of Pyrsos in 1967, which caused an issue with the Hellenic Olympic Committee. As a result, the club introduced a new crest with five stars in a diagonal line. The club&#x27;s colors were blue and white, which were the colors of the two main groups of the merger, Esperos Kallitheas and Iraklis Kallitheas.

In September 2022, the club rebranded as Athens Kallithea FC and presented a new visual identity, including a new crest and the addition of accents of gold to the uniform and a different shade of blue. The design work was executed by German studio Bureau Borsche, which also handled the rebranding of Inter Milan and Venezia FC.

<doc id="1300394" wikidata="Q7114941" url="?curid=1300394" title="Ownership society">
<text>Ownership society is a slogan for a model of society promoted by former United States president George W. Bush. It takes as lead values personal responsibility, economic liberty, and the owning of property. The &quot;ownership society&quot; discussed by Bush also extends to certain proposals of specific models of health care and social security.

==History==
The term appears to have been used originally by President Bush (for example in a speech February 20, 2003 in Kennesaw, Georgia) as a phrase to rally support for his tax-cut proposals. From 2004 Bush supporters described the ownership society in much broader and more ambitious terms, including specific policy proposals concerning home ownership, medicine, education and savings.

The idea that the welfare of individuals is directly related to their ability to control their own lives and wealth, rather than relying on government transfer payments, is a longstanding one, particularly in British conservatism.

In a modern form its implementation was developed as a main plank of Thatcherism, and is traced back to David Howell, before 1970, with help from the phrase-maker Peter Drucker.

In political practice under Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s administration, it was implemented by measures such as the sale at affordable prices of public housing to tenants (right to buy program), and privatization.

==Ownership and control==

As formulated by the Cato Institute (see original quote and external link below), the goals are that 

*patients have &quot;control&quot; of [decisions on] their personal health care,
*parents &quot;control&quot; [i.e. have power over] their children&#x27;s education, and
*workers &quot;control&quot; [i.e. have some responsibility for the investment of, or explicit property rights in] their retirement savings. 

Here the comments in brackets are an interpretation or paraphrase, consistent with a generalised idea of &quot;ownership&quot;. The conceptual link here is by means of the idea that private property, the most familiar and everyday form of ownership, is being extended. &quot;Control&quot; is closely associated with ownership in that sense. 

This Cato Institute formulation is not, however, in terms of positive policies. It is more accurately a definition of &quot;ownership&quot; by taking the state out of the loop. So, for example, in health care ownership is &quot;not&quot; being defined just on the basis of informed consent.

There is no real originality, politically speaking, in the connection made between individual ownership of property and political stake-holding. This was an idea discussed in Europe and America in the eighteenth century. (For example, that the franchise should &quot;only&quot; be for property holders.) 

The novelty of the Cato Institute formulation would lie in the extrapolation. In the case of savings, for example, the extension would be an assertion of property rights in money held in savings or collected tax revenues.

The first desiderata was part of John McCain&#x27;s campaign platform as the 2008 Republican presidential nominee. McCain&#x27;s website says, 
&quot;John McCain believes [that] the key to health care reform is to restore control to the patients themselves.&quot; 

==Political consequences and unexpected consequences==

Consistently with the basic tenet, proponents of an &quot;ownership society&quot; usually support inherited wealth, and oppose inheritance taxes and wealth taxes. They are also likely to favour a pattern of property ownership based on the purchase, rather than rental, of accommodation. 

The consequences for health and education are heavily dependent on details of implementation. For example, ownership in one&#x27;s child&#x27;s education, for a parent, might be in the form of an education voucher, a vote in the running of a school, influence on the school curriculum, or a generalised &#x27;right&#x27; to have a child educated in line with one&#x27;s own values.

One example from the UK of an unexpected or unintended consequence of government policy favouring direct share ownership, through some oversubscribed privatisation issues, was the holding of small parcels of shares by individuals numbered in millions. This broad-based ownership created an administrative overhead, for example in relation to every shareholder vote.

==Quotations==
&quot;The really big money in America comes not from working at all but from owning, which requires no expenditure of effort, either physical or mental. In short, working hard is not in and of itself directly related to the amount of income and wealth that individuals have.&quot; – The Meritocracy Myth by Stephen J. McNamee and Robert K. Miller, Jr. University of North Carolina at Wilmington.

&quot;We Conservatives have always passed our values from generation to generation. I believe that personal prosperity should follow the same course. I want to see wealth cascading down the generations. We do not see each generation starting out anew, with the past cut off and the future ignored.&quot; – John Major conference speech, 1991.

&quot;...if you own something, you have a vital stake in the future of our country. The more ownership there is in America, the more vitality there is in America, and the more people have a vital stake in the future of this country.&quot; – President George W. Bush, June 17, 2004.

&quot;We&#x27;re creating... an ownership society in this country, where more Americans than ever will be able to open up their door where they live and say, welcome to my house, welcome to my piece of property.&quot; – President George W. Bush, October 2004. 

&quot;Individuals are empowered by freeing them from dependence on government handouts and making them owners instead, in control of their own lives and destinies. In the ownership society, patients control their own health care, parents control their own children&#x27;s education, and workers control their retirement savings.&quot; – Cato Institute.

&quot;Many people don&#x27;t have the time, inclination, or expertise necessary to take full responsibility for their own well-being in areas that are so complex as assuring they have sufficient income for retirement or choosing a health plan appropriate for their circumstances.&quot; – Robert Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank.

&quot;...the key to health care reform is to restore control to the patients themselves.&quot; – John McCain&#x27;s campaign website, 2008.

&quot;George Bush called this the ownership society, but what he really meant was &#x27;you&#x27;re-on-your-own&#x27; society.&quot; – Barack Obama, 2008.

<text>Beta is a time signal service in the VLF range in Russia, operated by the Russian Navy. It is controlled by All-Russian Scientific Research Institute for Physical-Engineering and Radiotechnical Metrology. There are 6 transmitter stations, which take turns transmitting time signals and other communications.

Each transmitter has 1 or 2 scheduled sessions per day lasting 31–41 minutes, depending on transmitter, total 8 sessions in 24 hours. Beginning on the hour is 15–20 minutes of 25.0 kHz, including morse code station identification and time code. This is followed by 3- or 4-minute intervals of 25.1, 25.5, 23.0 and 20.5 kHz of unmodulated carrier precisely phase-locked to UTC(SU) time scale. No time code is sent during the last quarter of an hour.

== The Beta network ==
Beta consists of the following transmitters:

== Frequency usage ==
The time code consists of a series of signals on multiple frequencies. Transmission starts on the hour. Each time a new frequency is selected, there is 1 minute of low power while the transmitter is adjusted, then full-power transmissions begin.

The transmitters are estimated to operate at 1000 kW, achieving 30–50 kW EIRP. (The difference is due to the low efficiency of antennas at this frequency, which must be much smaller than the 12 km wavelength.)

The time code consists of a series of carrier pulses:
* Each 100 ms, a 25 ms burst of carrier is transmitted
* Each second, a 100 ms burst of carrier is transmitted
* Each 10 s, a 1 s burst of carrier is transmitted
* Each minute, a 10 s burst of carrier is transmitted
The hour or date is not coded.

Most of the stations were built in the 1970s. RJH63 and RAB99, built later, has a different transmission:

<doc id="1300407" wikidata="Q942883" url="?curid=1300407" title="St. Emmeram's Cathedral, Nitra">
<text>St. Emmeram&#x27;s Cathedral () is a Roman Catholic cathedral located in Nitra, Slovakia. The entire cathedral is housed in the Nitra Castle precinct, much like Prague Castle.

It was originally built in the Gothic style and is composed of many parts. The upper church dates from 1333 to 1355. The rotunda dates back to the 11th–12th century and houses a silver reliquary made in 1674. Another reliquary in the cathedral houses some relics of Saint Cyril. The lower church was built between 1621 and 1642. Later, the entire cathedral complex was remodelled in the Baroque style.

Saint Emmeram of Regensburg, to whom the cathedral is dedicated, was an itinerant seventh-century bishop who did missionary work from the court of Theodo I, Duke of Bavaria.

Jozef Tiso, who collaborated with Nazi rule in Slovakia during the Second World War, was reburied in the Crypt of St. Emmeram&#x27;s Cathedral in 2008.

==Description==
Pulpit

The pulpit is part of the solid Baroque interior decoration that was commissioned by Bishop László Ádám Erdődy in the first decades of the 18th century. It was built by the left pillar of the triumphal arch, with a stone stairway leading up from the chancel. Its red, green and white marbled surface and gilt stucco decoration matches the walls and the altars. The iconography is fairly simple, with three white cherubs on the abat-voix and the Eye of Providence between clouds.

<doc id="1300409" wikidata="Q1875899" url="?curid=1300409" title="Parasite (comics)">
<text>Parasite is the name of several supervillains appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Each iteration of the character has the ability to temporarily absorb the life force, attributes, memories, and superpowers of anyone through physical touch. The most well-known and recurring incarnation is Rudy Jones, who has become one of Superman&#x27;s most enduring enemies and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues gallery. In 2009, Parasite was ranked as IGN&#x27;s 61st Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.

The Rudy Jones incarnation of the Parasite has been substantially adapted from the comics into multiple forms of media, most notably in the DC Animated Universe&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and &quot;Justice League&quot; as well as the live-action TV series &quot;Smallville&quot; and &quot;Supergirl&quot;, portrayed by Brendan Fletcher and William Mapother respectively. Additionally, Raymond Jensen and Alexandra Allston, Ally Allston, appear in &quot;Supergirl&quot; and &quot;Superman &amp; Lois&quot;, portrayed by Anthony Konechny and Rya Kihlstedt respectively.

==Publication history==
The Raymond Maxwell Jenson version of the Parasite first appeared in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #340 (August 1966) and was created by Jim Shooter.

Shooter, who began working for DC at age 13, says that his inspiration for the villain was learning about parasites in his ninth-grade biology class.

The Rudy Jones version of the Parasite first appeared in &quot;Firestorm&quot; (vol. 2) #58 and was created by John Ostrander and Joe Brozowski.

The Alex and Andrea Allston versions of the Parasite first appeared in &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; #633 and were created by Greg Rucka, Matthew Clark, and Andrew Lanning.

The Joshua Allen version of the &quot;New 52&quot; Parasite first appeared in &quot;Superman&quot; (vol. 3) #23.4 and was created by Aaron Kuder.

==Fictional character biography==
===Raymond Jensen===

In the Pre-Crisis, Raymond Maxwell Jensen was a lowlife who got a job as a plant worker for a research center. Wrongly believing that the company payrolls were hidden in storage containers, Jensen opened one and was bombarded with energies from biohazard materials (which was actually waste collected by Superman when he traveled into outer space), which transformed him into a purple-skinned, parasitic entity, and thus he became the Parasite. Any time he touched someone, he could absorb their physical and mental properties. Touching Superman would instantly absorb a sizable fraction of his superhuman powers (it was established early on that he is not capable of acquiring the whole of Superman&#x27;s powers). On one occasion, while attempting to absorb a greater portion of his adversary&#x27;s powers than previously, his body disintegrated for a period of time due to the pressure in his cells. Despite these abilities, the Parasite became depressed because he could no longer embrace his wife and children. The Parasite made a number of reappearances before the Crisis, yet he never successfully found a means to permanently defeat Superman. Despite this, he knew Superman&#x27;s alter ego and often used this to attack Clark Kent. Gaining sizable intellect from his multiple encounters with Superman, the Parasite devised the means to reanimate dormant plant remains left behind from the Earth-Two supervillain Solomon Grundy, creating a newer and stronger version of the creature to plague his adversary. On another occasion, the Parasite devised the means to transfer the powers of the hero Air Wave to the young hero&#x27;s adversary Casey Jones temporarily.

In &quot;&quot;, Parasite and Terra-Man are revealed to have killed each other sometime prior.

===Rudy Jones===
The second Parasite, Rudolph &quot;Rudy&quot; Jones, is a janitor at a Pittsburgh S.T.A.R. Labs facility who is transformed after being exposed to radioactive waste. Forced to absorb energy to survive, Parasite attacks Firestorm and kills Multiplex before the former stops him.

Throughout his appearances, Parasite&#x27;s abilities evolve, giving him the ability to absorb fire, electricity, and consciousnesses, and mimic the genetic makeup and appearance of others, before he is killed after accidentally absorbing Kryptonite radiation. Parasite is later resurrected and joins Libra&#x27;s Secret Society of Super Villains.

The 2009-10 miniseries &quot;&quot; redefines the Parasite&#x27;s origin. In this version, Rudy Jones is a janitor at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; who is selected to join LexCorp. There, he eats a donut imbued with Kryptonite radiation that transforms him into the Parasite.

In the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; relaunch, Parasite is a member of the Suicide Squad. In &quot;Dawn of DC&quot;, Parasite reforms, gets a job at Supercorp, and is given a special wristband that supplies him with energy. He also develops the ability to create small duplicates of himself and adopts one of them as a pet. In &quot;Superman&quot; (volume 6), Parasite is killed by Doomsday.

===Alex and Alexandra Allston===

Alex and Alexandra Allston are teenagers who are experimented on by the villain Ruin and transformed into Parasites.

Alex is later killed by an OMAC while attempting to escape prison. Alexandra successfully escapes and joins the Secret Society of Super Villains under Alexander Luthor Jr.

===Joshua Allen===
Joshua Allen is the fourth incarnation of Parasite, introduced in &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot. He is a misanthropic delivery boy who is wounded while attacking a creature that Superman was fighting. Allen is taken to S.T.A.R. Labs to recover, where the treatment transforms him into Parasite.

In later appearances, Allen joins the Secret Society of Super Villains and the Suicide Squad.

==Powers and abilities==
All incarnations of the Parasite have the ability to temporarily absorb the life energy, superpowers, and knowledge of their victims through physical contact, and are also able to drain virtually any other form of energy and use it as a power source.

In particular, Rudy Jones is granted enhanced strength, intelligence, agility, durability, and reflexes by absorbing the energy of other beings. When Jones drains other superpowered individuals, he gains their abilities for a limited period of time until he &quot;runs out of life-energy&quot; and must seek a new victim to &quot;feed on&quot;. He is shown to have a heightened sense of perception that allows him to detect the life force and power within other beings. While drawing the energy of ordinary humans is almost instantaneous, it takes a notably longer time in the case of immensely powerful beings, which gives the victim more time to react and free themselves from the Parasite&#x27;s grip. Following an encounter with the Strange Visitor, however, the Parasite&#x27;s powers were enhanced and enable him to retain the energy he takes for longer as well as granting Jones the ability to shapeshift; he can now physically morph into his victims right down to their DNA, being able to access their memories, gain their natural abilities, and mimic their voices. The Parasite&#x27;s biggest weakness is that he also absorbs the weaknesses of his victims and cannot counter such susceptibilities even when he has other abilities that should do so; when he absorbed both Superman and Livewire&#x27;s powers, he retained the latter&#x27;s vulnerability to water despite possessing the former&#x27;s near-invulnerability. The Parasite also maintains Superman&#x27;s weaknesses, like kryptonite, even when the Parasite in addition already absorbed the powers of non-Kryptonians.

==In other media==
===Television===
====Live-action====
* The Rudy Jones incarnation of Parasite appears in the &quot;Smallville&quot; episode &quot;Injustice&quot;, portrayed by Brendan Fletcher. This version was a metahuman prisoner at the Black Creek facility before Tess Mercer stages a prison break and recruits Jones, among other prisoners, into a team in a failed attempt at making them heroes.
** Additionally, an unrelated character called Eric Summers appears in the episodes &quot;Leech&quot; and &quot;Asylum&quot;, portrayed by Shawn Ashmore. Throughout his appearances, he temporarily steals Clark Kent&#x27;s powers via Kryptonite and electricity on two separate occasions, only to be defeated by him and lose them each time.
* Two incarnations of Parasite appear in &quot;Supergirl&quot;. Both versions are the result of humans being possessed by an alien parasite called an Angon:
** Dr. Rudy Jones appears in the episode &quot;Changing&quot;, portrayed by William Mapother. This version is an environmental scientist who is infected by an Angon that had laid dormant in an Arctic wolf&#x27;s corpse and gains the ability to drain life force through physical contact. While fighting Supergirl, Alex Danvers, and Martian Manhunter, Jones absorbs Supergirl and Manhunter&#x27;s powers and transforms into a monster before Supergirl overloads and kills him with plutonium.
** Raymond Jensen appears in the fourth season, portrayed by Anthony Konechny. This version is a Department of Extranormal Operations (DEO) agent who despises aliens for wreaking havoc on National City. Throughout the episodes &quot;American Alien&quot; and &quot;Parasite Lost&quot;, he leaves the DEO to join anti-alien activists Otis and Mercy Graves and Agent Liberty. Jensen later volunteers to be exposed to an Angon obtained from the DEO, gaining energy-absorbing abilities in the process, only to eventually end up comatose and taken into DEO custody.
* A character based on Alexandra Allston named Ally Allston appears in the second season of &quot;Superman &amp; Lois&quot;, portrayed by Rya Kihlstedt as an adult and by Amber Taylor as a child. This version is a cult leader behind the Inverse Society who took over Bizarro World with help from her Bizarro counterpart (also portrayed by Kihlstedt), who she later merges with, gaining flight and the ability to drain energy. Nonetheless, they are defeated and separated by Superman and incarcerated by the Department of Defense.

<text>Charles Edward Searle (18 June 1828 in Hackney – 29 July 1902 in Cambridge) was an English clergyman and academic, Master of Pembroke College, Cambridge from 1880 until his death in 1902.

==Biography==
Charles Edward Searle was the seventh son of Samuel Browne Searle and Charlotte née Smales, of Hackney. His father died when he was young, leaving his mother with 12 children, and thus two of the brothers were educated at Christ&#x27;s Hospital, supported by the governor of the hospital. Searle specialized in mathematics, and was elected to a scholarship at Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1848, graduating BA (10th wrangler) in 1851. Elected a fellow, he was ordained deacon in 1854, and priest in 1855. He was curate in Broughton in 1855, of Odell, Bedfordshire, 1856–64, and of Earl Stonham 1864–70. In that year he returned to Pembroke as a tutor, served as lecturer and Dean, and eventually (from his election in 1880) Master of Pembroke. &quot;To him, more than to any other single man, the growth of the College, both in numbers and distinction, during the later part of the nineteenth century, was due.&quot; He was Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University in 1888–89. He was the friend and chief mentor of Inagaki Manjiro.

In 1881 he married Miss Fowler, niece of John Power, his predecessor as Master.

Searle died on 29 July 1902.

<text>The Chengdu J-10 Vigorous Dragon (; NATO reporting name: Firebird), is a medium-weight, single-engine, multirole combat aircraft using a delta wing and canard design. It is produced by the Chengdu Aircraft Corporation (CAC) for the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF), Pakistan Air Force (PAF) and People&#x27;s Liberation Army Naval Air Force (PLANAF). The J-10 is mainly designed for air-to-air combat, but can also perform strike missions.

== Development ==

In 1981, PLAAF Commander Zhang Tingfa submitted a proposal to Deng Xiaoping for the development of a third-generation fighter for ; it was accepted later that year by the Central Military Commission (CMC). It was the first Chinese aircraft program to incorporate modern development and acquisition processes. In one departure from the past, the supplier was now responsible directly to the customer; this allowed the PLAAF to communicate its requirements and ensure they were met; previously suppliers were responsible to their managing agency, which could produce products that failed to meet end user requirements. Another difference was the selection of a design through competition, rather than allocating a project to an institute and using whatever design that institute created.

Design proposals were made by the three major aircraft design institutes. Shenyang&#x27;s proposal was based on its cancelled J-13 with a F-16-like strake-wing. Hongdu&#x27;s proposal was MiG-23/Su-24-like with variable-sweep wing. Chengdu Aircraft Design Institute&#x27;s (CADI) proposal was a Saab 37 Viggen-like design based on its cancelled J-9. CADI&#x27;s proposal was selected in February 1984. The following month, CADI and Chengdu Fighter Factory were formally directed to develop and manufacture the aircraft, respectively. Song Wencong (宋文骢) became chief designer.

The engine was selected during the design proposal stage. Candidates were an improved Woshan WS-6, the WP-15, or a new engine. The new engine, ultimately the Shenyang WS-10, was chosen in 1983.

The State Council and the CMC approved the program in 1986, code-naming it &quot;No. 10 Project&quot;. Interest waned in the following years which constrained funding and prolonged development. The Gulf War renewed interest and brought adequate resourcing. Unlike earlier programs, the J-10 avoided crippling requirement creep.

Technical development was slow and difficult. The J-10 represented a higher level of complexity than earlier generations of Chinese aircraft. About 60% of the aircraft required new technology and parts, instead of - according to Chengdu - the usual 30% for new aircraft; the high proportion reflected both requirements and limited domestic capability. Development and modernization of China&#x27;s aviation industry occurred alongside the J-10; the program was an early Chinese user of digital design, modelling, and testing including computer-aided design (CAD) and computational fluid dynamics. The J-10 was the first Chinese aircraft to make major use of CAD for its structural design, allowing the detailed design to be completed in 1994. The hydraulics system was tested with physical models because of limited digital modelling capabilities.

The first J-10 was assembled in June 1997. Lei Qiang flew the first flight on 23 March 1998; Lei was chosen for his experience with modern, foreign, third-generation aircraft. PLA training units received the J-10 ahead of schedule starting in 2003. Weapons tests occurred in the fall of that year. The design was finalized in 2004. Rumors of crashes during flight testing were actually mishaps related to the AL-31 engine.

The J-10 became operational in 2006. It was officially unveiled by the Chinese government in January 2007, when photographs were published by Xinhua News Agency.

The Siberian Aeronautical Research Institute (SibNIA) from Russia was involved in the program by 2006. According to SibNIA, it was only observing and instructing as &quot;scientific guides&quot;.

In May 2021, China National Radio released images of the J-10C powered by the WS-10B engine; this was the first time the WS-10 was officially seen on an operational J-10.

=== Disputed origins ===

In 1988 Israel&#x27;s defense minister denied a report by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; that Israel and China had agreed to develop a fighter derived from the IAI Lavi, a project based on the F-16. In 2006, Russia&#x27;s SibNIA engineers believed that the J-10 was &quot;more or less a version&quot; of the Lavi, incorporating &quot;a melting pot of foreign technology and acquired design methods... but there are a number of other pieces of other aircraft or technologies that are part of the configuration that they have acquired from different sources.&quot; In 2008, Janes claimed that the J-10 benefited from technical information from the Israeli project, citing senior Russian engineers who said they had heard this from Chinese colleagues.

The Chinese assert J-10&#x27;s features claimed to be from the Lavi are from the manufacturer&#x27;s own previous aircraft design, for example attributing the J-10&#x27;s Lavi-like double canard configuration to Chengdu&#x27;s work on the cancelled J-9 of the 1960s and 1970s; this view is supported by Song Wencong, who worked on the J-9 and became the J-10&#x27;s chief designer, and PLAAF Major General Zhang Weigang.

== Design ==
The J-10 was designed and developed by the Chengdu Aircraft Design Institute (CADI), a subsidiary of Chengdu Aircraft Corporation.

=== Avionics ===

The cockpit has three liquid crystal (LCD) multi-function displays (MFD) and a Chinese developed holographic head-up display (HUD). These are compatible with a Chinese helmet mounted sight (HMS); the Chinese consider the HMS of the imported Sukhoi Su-27 to be worse.

=== Radar ===

The early J-10s were initially equipped with the Type 1473 pulse-Doppler radar (PD) developed by the CETC 14th Institute; the Type 1473 has been called China&#x27;s first &quot;successful&quot; or &quot;practical&quot; PD radar.

The J-10B is equipped with an active electronically scanned array (AESA) or passive electronically scanned array (PESA) radar. According to Chinese accounts, PESA was never used due to unsatisfactory performance; AVIC 607 Institute and CETC 14th Institute developed a PESA radar that could track multiple targets simultaneously but had shorter range than the PD radar. PESA and AESA development delayed the J-10B. CETC 14th Institute helped to develop the J-10B&#x27;s AESA radar.

=== Propulsion ===

The J-10 is powered by a single turbofan. The J-10A entered production with the Russian Salyut AL-31FN. The initial version generated a maximum static thrust of . In December 2013, Salyut reported it was testing an upgraded AL-31FN Series 3 for China with 250 hours more life and 1000 kg/f more thrust; the Series 3 would be equipped on the improved J-10B. Compared to the original Lyulka-Saturn AL-31F, the AL-31FN was fitted to the J-10 by rotating the gearbox and accessory pack to the underside.

The J-10s intended engine is the Chinese Shenyang WS-10. The WS-10 suffered development difficulties and production of the aircraft went ahead with the Salyut AL-31FN as a substitute. A pre-production J-10C flew with a WS-10 at the 2018 China International Aviation &amp; Aerospace Exhibition; the engine nozzle was modified for stealth and thrust vectoring (TVC). In March 2020, a video from Chinese state media showed a J-10C in PLAAF livery equipped with the WS-10B; WS-10B-powered aircraft were in service by November 2021.

=== Weaponry and external loads ===

The aircraft&#x27;s internal armament consists of a Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-23 twin-barrel cannon, located underneath the port side of the intake. Other weaponry and equipment is mounted externally on 11 hardpoints, to which of either missiles and bombs, drop-tanks containing fuel, or other equipment such as avionics pods can be attached.

Air-to-air missiles deployed may include short-range air-to-air missiles such as the PL-8 and PL-10 (on J-10C), medium-range radar-guided air-to-air missiles such as the PL-12 and PL-15 (on J-10C), unguided and precision guided munitions such as laser-guided bombs, air-to-surface missile such as KD-88, anti-ship missiles such as the YJ-91A, and anti-radiation missiles such as the YJ-91.

== Operational history ==

=== China ===

The first aircraft were delivered to the 13th Test Regiment on 23 February 2003. The aircraft was declared &#x27;operational&#x27; in December of the same year, after 18 years in development.

The J-10C entered combat service in April 2018.

The J-10C has been reported to have consistently prevailed in simulated combat engagements against Su-35 fighters acquired from Russia, with the fighter&#x27;s reduced radar visibility allowing it to detect and fire on its target first. The fighter&#x27;s lower radar signature and significantly more advanced sensors and weaponry for both visual and beyond-visual range engagements were cited by experts as leading advantages the aircraft retained. The J-10C gained victories against both the Su-35 and the J-16 in exercises for three consecutive years from 2019 to 2021.

=== Pakistan ===

Negotiations for acquisitions for J-10A were started in 2006 when offered by China, but negotiations persisted into 2012 with the offer of the J-10B. 

In September 2020, it was reported that Pakistan was interested in the J-10C. In December 2021, Pakistan announced the purchase of 25 J-10CEs, with an option for 11 more; they were expected to enter service in March 2022. On 4 March 2022, the first batch of 6 J-10CEs for the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) landed at PAF Base Minhas (Kamra) after a ferry flight from Chengdu, China. They were officially inducted into the PAF&#x27;s No. 15 Squadron &quot;Cobras&quot; based at PAF Base Minhas on 11 March 2022.

On 18 January 2024, Pakistan launched a series of air and artillery strikes inside Iran, targeting Baloch separatist groups, multiple JF-17C and Wing Loong II drones escorted by J-10CE launched attacks against BLA and BLF militant groups with GIDS B-REK Glidebombs. 9 terrorists were killed in the attack.
