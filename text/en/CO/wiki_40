<text>Ashlar () is a cut and dressed stone, worked using a chisel to achieve a specific form, typically rectangular in shape. The term can also refer to a structure built from such stones.

Ashlar is the finest stone masonry unit, and is generally rectangular (cuboid). It was described by Vitruvius as &quot;opus isodomum&quot; or trapezoidal. Precisely cut &quot;on all faces adjacent to those of other stones&quot;, ashlar is capable of requiring only very thin joints between blocks, and the visible face of the stone may be quarry-faced or feature a variety of treatments: tooled, smoothly polished or rendered with another material for decorative effect. One such decorative treatment consists of small grooves achieved by the application of a metal comb. Generally used only on softer stone ashlar, this decoration is known as &quot;mason&#x27;s drag&quot;.

Ashlar is in contrast to rubble masonry, which employs irregularly shaped stones, sometimes minimally worked or selected for similar size, or both. Ashlar is related but distinct from other stone masonry that is finely dressed but not quadrilateral, such as curvilinear and polygonal masonry.

Ashlar may be coursed, which involves lengthy horizontal layers of stone blocks laid in parallel, and therefore with continuous horizontal joints. Ashlar may also be random, which involves stone blocks laid with deliberately discontinuous courses and therefore discontinuous joints both vertically and horizontally. In either case, it generally uses a joining material such as mortar to bind the blocks together, although dry ashlar construction, metal ties, and other methods of assembly have been used. The dry ashlar of Inca architecture in Cusco and Machu Picchu is particularly fine and famous.

==Etymology==
The word is attested in Middle English and derives from the Old French &quot;aisselier&quot;, from the Latin &quot;axilla&quot;, a diminutive of &quot;axis&quot;, meaning &quot;plank&quot;. &quot;Clene hewen ashler&quot; often occurs in medieval documents; this means tooled or finely worked, in contradistinction to rough-axed faces.

In tile carpet installation &quot;ashlar&quot; refers to a vertical 1/2 offset pattern.

==Use==
Ashlar blocks have been used in the construction of many buildings as an alternative to brick or other materials.

In classical architecture, ashlar wall surfaces were often contrasted with rustication.

The term is frequently used to describe the dressed stone work of prehistoric Greece and Crete, although the dressed blocks are usually much larger than modern ashlar. For example, the &quot;tholos&quot; tombs of Bronze Age Mycenae use ashlar masonry in the construction of the so-called &quot;beehive&quot; dome. This dome consists of finely cut ashlar blocks that decrease in size and terminate in a central capstone. These domes are not true domes, but are constructed using the corbel arch.

Ashlar masonry was also heavily used in the construction of palace facades on Crete, including Knossos and Phaistos. These constructions date to the MM III-LM Ib period, –1450 BC.

In modern European masonry the blocks are generally about in height. When shorter than , they are usually called small ashlar.

== As metaphor==
In some Masonic groupings, which such societies term s, ashlars are used as a symbolic metaphor for how one&#x27;s personal development relates to the tenets of their lodge. As described in the explanation of the First Degree Tracing Board, in Emulation and other Masonic rituals the rough ashlar is a stone as taken directly from the quarry, and allegorically represents the Freemason prior to his initiation; a smooth ashlar (or &quot;perfect ashlar&quot;) is a stone that has been smoothed and dressed by the experienced stonemason, and allegorically represents the Freemason who, through education and diligence, has learned the lessons of Freemasonry and who lives an upstanding life.

<text>Salem University is a private for-profit university in Salem, West Virginia. It has about 250 students on campus and about 600 online students that are enrolled in undergraduate as well as graduate programs. The university was founded by the Seventh Day Baptist Church in 1888.

==History==
The school was founded after the Eastern Seventh Day Baptist Association decided to build an academy in the city of Salem. The state granted a permit in December 1888 to build what was called the Academy of Salem, specifying that the institution was subject to the regulations and decisions of the Society of Seventh Day Baptist Education. The charter required the institution to make a college as soon as possible, which occurred in 1890. Over the next 100 years, the school continued as a liberal arts, teacher education, and nursing college.

In 1989, Salem formed an alliance with Teikyo University in Tokyo, Japan, which changed the focus of the school to one of education of international students. &quot;Salem College&quot; was renamed &quot;Salem-Teikyo University&quot;. Nearly 200 freshmen from Japan enrolled in the college as part of an experiment by Japanese educators to teach the 145 boys and 45 girls how to speak fluent English, experience American culture firsthand and to acquire a valuable American college degree. The alliance with Teikyo ended in 2000, when the school was purchased by investors from Singapore. At that time, the school changed its name to &quot;Salem International University&quot;. Salem International University was acquired by Salem Education LLC in June 2005. The school was renamed &quot;Salem University&quot; in September 2017.

The Salem College Administration Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. However, due to ongoing safety concerns, the building was demolished in 2023. Historical documents and the original bell from the building were found in that demolition and are now housed in Salem&#x27;s Benedum Library.

==Academics==
Salem is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. The university offers undergraduate degrees including the Associate of Arts, Associate of Science, Bachelor of Arts, and Bachelor of Science. The School of Nursing offers a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (a degree-completion program for registered nurses) and an Associate of Science in Nursing that prepares students to become Registered Nurses.

At the graduate level, Salem offers a Master of Business Administration, a Master of Education, and a Master of Science in Nursing. Teachers may take courses in the School of Education as non-degree students to renew their licenses. A post-master&#x27;s certificate in Educational Leadership is offered that leads to advanced licensure and a certificate in Special Education Leadership is also offered.

All programs, including distance education programs, are delivered in a monthly format allowing students to complete their degrees more quickly than their counterparts at other traditional or online universities. This attracts non-traditional students conscious of time and accessibility.

Since classes are four weeks long, the MBA or M.Ed. can be completed in 12 months or fewer, a Bachelor&#x27;s in 40 months, or an Associate in only 20 months, if a student were to start college studies without any prior college credits.

==Athletics==
The Salem athletic teams are called the Tigers. The university is a member of the Division II level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing as an NCAA D-II Independent for most of its sports since the 2016–17 academic year (which they were a member on a previous stint from 2010–11 to 2012–13); while being an associate member of the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) for some of its sports. The Tigers previously competed as a member of the Great Midwest Athletic Conference (G-MAC) from 2013–14 to 2015–16; as well as a charter member of the defunct West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WVIAC) from 1924–25 to 2009–10. They have also competed as a dual affliate with the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA) since the 2022–23 school year, thus winning national championships in men&#x27;s basketball (2023) and women&#x27;s basketball (2024). 

Salem competes in 14 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, soccer, swimming, tennis, wrestling, water polo; while women&#x27;s sports basketball, soccer, softball, swimming, volleyball, tennis, and water polo.

===Athletic Conference membership===
Salem competed as original members of the WVIAC beginning in 1924–25, and remained a member through 2009–10 (including through that conference&#x27;s transition from NAIA to NCAA Division II in 1995-1996). The WVIAC folded shortly thereafter in 2013. The majority of the former WVIAC joined the Mountain East Conference, which had their first season of competition in 2013.

Salem is one of four West Virginia schools that joined the G-MAC in July 2013. The other three schools were former WVIAC colleagues of Salem that had been cast adrift in the breakup of the WVIAC. Salem left the G-MAC at the end of the 2015–16 season. According to an official statement issued by the G-MAC: “Salem International will be conducting a final year of (G-MAC) affiliation in 2015-2016. 

The institution has been exploring alternate Division II conference membership options beginning with the 2016–17 season.” As of the 2023–24 school year, Salem remains an independent NCAA Division II institution with no conference affiliation in most sports, with the exception being men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s water polo that compete in the Western Water Polo Association.

However, Salem University and the Mountain East Conference reached a non-conference scheduling agreement for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, volleyball, baseball, and softball beginning in August of 2023 in the wake of the sudden closure of then Mountain East member Alderson Broaddus University.

<doc id="1281816" wikidata="Q1138042" url="?curid=1281816" title="Covenanter tank">
<text>The Cruiser tank Mk V or A13 Mk III Covenanter was a British cruiser tank of the Second World War. The Covenanter was the first cruiser tank design to be given a name. Designed by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway as a better-armoured replacement for the Cruiser Mark IV, it was ordered into production in 1939 before pilot models were built. Problems with the design became apparent only after production was under way.

The tank equipped various British armoured divisions for home defence and training. It never left the UK as poor engine cooling caused the Mk I to Mk III to be declared unfit for overseas service, especially in hot climates. This was rectified in the Mk IV after many corrective actions were undertaken but, by February 1944, it was declared obsolete. More than 1,700 of the type were built. It was named after the Covenanters, a Scottish religious and political movement at the time of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms.

==Development==

In 1938, the War Office had issued a requirement for a new, better armoured &quot;heavy&quot; cruiser tank to replace the Cruiser IV. Nuffield&#x27;s A16 (and the A14) design was found to be too expensive and, in 1939, a cheaper and lighter cruiser tank – under General Staff specification A13 Mk III Cruiser Mark V – was chosen to be developed. It had nothing apart from Christie suspension and armament in common with the other A13 specifications.

The initial specification required a QF 2 pounder gun, at least one machine gun, the same A13 Christie suspension in a lower hull, epicyclic steering transmission and &quot;armour standard&quot; (armour basis) of . The &quot;30 mm armoured standard&quot; referred to any vertical plate having to be 30 mm thick. Angled surfaces (through the principles of sloped armour) could be thinner, provided they were at least as effective as a 30 mm thick vertical plate.

From these, a design using many sloped surfaces was chosen to keep the weight low. To keep the silhouette low, the suspension used cranked arms and a low profile engine was envisaged. The engine, which was to be specifically designed for it, was to deliver at least . The Wilson transmission and steering of the A16 would be used.

Design work was by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company (LMS), who had no prior experience in the design and production of fighting vehicles and had been invited to participate under a Government policy that British companies should develop skills in expectation of war. The design assumed a welded hull rather than the usual riveting. The turret was designed by Nuffield, with Henry Meadows designing a new low profile engine for it. On 17 April 1939, before a prototype was produced, the first 100 vehicles were ordered from the LMS. Additional orders soon followed, with English Electric and Leyland Motors joining the production effort, for a final production total of 1,771 Covenanters. Nuffield was also approached but preferred to design its own offspring of the A13 line, which became the Cruiser Mk.VI Crusader.

Due to the expectation of war, the design was ordered &quot;off the drawing board&quot;. The expectation was that two pilot models would serve for testing and results applied to the production lines.

To meet the engine requirement, a horizontally opposed 12-cylinder design was used. Although flat, it was wide and left no room for radiators in the engine compartment and so the radiators were situated at the front of the vehicle. The unusual arrangement, although tested in mock up form first, when combined with the rushed design resulted in serious problems with engine cooling. Even when the systems were redesigned, there were problems and the piping from engine to the radiators heated the fighting compartment. These problems meant that the Covenanter would not be employed in the North African Campaign. Instead, Crusaders and American tanks were sent to Africa, while the Covenanters remained at home.

LMS advised a return to riveted construction due to doubts about the strength of the welds and rather than risk delays due to a lack of welders, this was accepted. The welded design used two layers of armour plate, the inner being of steel that would weld readily without losing its properties. This two-plate system was retained when the design reverted to riveted construction. The use of rivets, steel wheels instead of aluminium and an increase in armour specification to at the front of hull and turret increased the weight to a level where the tank suspension was at maximum load, leaving no room for later development of the design. Rather than risk the availability of the combined Wilson transmission and steering, affecting production, the A13 &quot;crash&quot; gear box was used with epicyclic steering units. This necessitated a reduced size of cooling fan for the transmission compartment.

Contracts were placed with the manufacturers in 1939. The pilot model (with welded hull) was successfully tested in 1940; though the second pilot suffered from overheating. The first deliveries of production vehicles were not until after the battle of Dunkirk. Production of turrets lagged behind that of hulls. Production ended in mid-1942. It is surprising that production was continued for so long, because newer, better tank designs were waiting for space on production lines. A Covenanter tank cost the British Government £12,000, a Crusader tank cost £13,700, a Matilda tank cost £18,000, and a Valentine tank £14,900.

By late 1943, the Covenanter was considered too weakly armed and armoured to deal with new German tanks. It was decided that neither problem could be addressed without significant changes in the design, so the tank was declared obsolete and all vehicles except the bridge-layer variant were to be scrapped.

==Service==

Except for a few trial vehicles, Covenanters were never deployed outside the UK. The Covenanter was used to re-equip the 1st Armoured Division (six armoured regiments in two brigades), which had lost most of its tanks in the Fall of France. When the 1st was sent to Egypt, the tanks were transferred to the 9th Armoured Division.

Eventually, a handful of vehicles were sent to the desert for service trials and were allocated to the REME for maintenance and evaluation. It is not clear if these tanks were ever used in combat; the unit markings indicate they may have been deployed alongside Kingforce with their new 6 pounder-equipped Churchill Mk III tanks.

Covenanters were also used to equip the Guards Armoured Division in 1942 and elements of the 1st Polish Armoured Division when it was formed in the UK; they were replaced before these units were sent to the frontline, except for a few bridgelayers that both divisions retained and used in their advance through Belgium and the Netherlands.

Observation Post tanks were issued to artillery units to carry Forward Observation Officers for Royal Artillery batteries. In an armoured division, there were two OP tanks for each RHA or field battery. Medium gun batteries had one. Command tanks were similar to OP tanks, but had only two No. 19 sets; one on the regiment radio net and the other on the brigade net.

Covenanter bridgelayers were used by the 1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade during the siege of Dunkirk from October 1944 to May 1945. The bridgelayer version was also used by the 4th Armoured Brigade of the Australian Army at Bougainville and Balikpapan during the Pacific Campaign in 1945.

==Variants==

* Covenanter Mk I (Cruiser Mk V) – Original production model.
** Covenanter Mk I Close Support – Armed with 3-inch howitzer.
* Covenanter Mk II (Cruiser Mk V*) – Mark I production modified by addition of radiator-mounted oil cooler.
** Covenanter Mk II CS – Armed with 3-inch howitzer.
** Observation Post version with dummy gun, two No. 19 radios and a No. 18 radio; issued to artillery units.
** Command version with dummy gun and two No. 19 radios.
* Covenanter Mk III (Cruiser Mk V**) – new production with twin oil coolers installed either side of the engine. Clutch linkage modified. Air cleaners added inboard at the rear. Exhaust silencers moved to the ends of the track guards.
** Covenanter Mk III CS – Armed with 3-inch howitzer.
* Covenanter Mk IV – New production as the Mk II with the clutch changes of the Mk III.
** Covenanter Mk IV CS – Armed with 3-inch howitzer.
** Observation Post version with dummy gun, two No. 19 radios and No. 18 radio.
* Covenanter Bridgelayer – Covenanter hull fitted with a vehicle-launched bridge (&quot;30 ft No. 1&quot;). This was long and wide. It could span a gap and was capable of carrying 24 tons. In 1944, an improved bridge was developed with a 30-ton capacity.
* Covenanter ARV Mk I – Armoured recovery vehicle based on turretless Covenanter hull. One prototype was built in 1942.
Some Covenanters were fitted with the &quot;Anti-Mine Roller Attachment&quot; (AMRA) Mk IC which was a mine clearing device consisting of four heavy rollers suspended from a frame. The weight of the rollers could be increased by filling them with water or sand.

==Surviving vehicles==
A single Covenanter gun–tank is preserved at The Tank Museum, Bovington, in the UK. It is displayed in the markings it had during the War when it served with the 13th/18th Royal Hussars, part of the 9th Armoured Division. For unknown reasons, it was buried after the war on a farm near Dorking. In 1977 it was discovered, recovered, restored and put on display at the Bovington museum in 1985. The Tank Museum also has the turret from an early Covenanter pilot model.

A second Covenanter tank was recovered in May 2017 from the same farm, now the site of Denbies vineyard. 

The partially buried, wrecked hulls of two tanks may be seen at Titchwell Marsh in Norfolk, UK. Now a Royal Society for the Protection of Birds nature reserve, the area was formerly a tank gunnery range and the Covenanters were likely used as targets.

Two Covenanter Bridgelayers are preserved in Australia – one at the Royal Australian Armoured Corps Tank Museum, Puckapunyal, Victoria, and one at the 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers Lancer Barracks and Museum at Parramatta, New South Wales.

<text>Ofira Resnikov Navon (; January 1, 1936 – August 22, 1993) was the wife of Yitzhak Navon, the fifth President of Israel.

==Biography==
Ofira Navon was born in Tel Aviv to Batya and Eliezer Resnikov, both originally from Russia. She earned an MA in education and psychology from the University of Georgia, where she was also a member of the Delta Phi Epsilon sorority, and had professional certification in rehabilitation psychology from Columbia University. She and Yitzhak Navon had two children, Naama and Erez.

==As First Lady==

During her husband&#x27;s presidency, from 1978 to 1983, Navon raised the profile of the president&#x27;s wife. As First Lady, Navon established the President&#x27;s Council for the Welfare of the Child. She worked with Jihan Sadat, wife of the Egyptian president, on rehabilitation projects for soldiers wounded in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Navon also pushed for an international treaty to protect children caught in war zones.

Navon was the first Israeli-born presidential wife. With her Ashkenazi upbringing, her marriage to a Sephardi Jew was unusual at the time. The fact that they were parents of small children was another first for the presidency in Israel.

==Illness and death==
In 1979, Navon was diagnosed with breast cancer and rejected a mastectomy, opting for chemotherapy and a lumpectomy. Later she argued for the right of patients to determine their own treatment. In August 1993, Navon died of leukemia at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem at the age of 57.

<text>Raphael &quot;Raph&quot; Koster (born September 7, 1971) is an American entrepreneur, game designer, and author of &quot;A Theory of Fun for Game Design&quot;. Koster is widely recognized for his work as the lead designer of &quot;Ultima Online&quot; and the creative director behind &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot;. From 2006 until 2013 he worked as the founder and president of Metaplace (previously operating as Areae and acquired by social gaming company Playdom in 2010, which was in turn acquired by Disney) producing a Facebook game platform.

==Biography==
Koster attended Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland, receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English (creative writing) and Spanish in 1992. The same year he became involved with MUDs as a developer of &quot;Worlds of Carnage&quot;, then in 1994 moved on to become implementor of &quot;LegendMUD&quot;, where he was known as Ptah. He also played &quot;MUME&quot; for a time. On May 10, 1992, he married Kristen who would later work alongside him at Origin Systems as a game designer.

In 1995, he received a Master of Fine Arts in Poetry from the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and joined Origin Systems as the lead designer of Ultima Online. Koster was also the lead designer of &quot;Ultima Online: The Second Age&quot;, &quot;Ultima Online Live&quot;, and an unannounced and cancelled title until 2000, when he joined Verant Interactive in Austin as the creative director of &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot;.

Promoted to chief creative officer in 2003, he relocated to Sony Online Entertainment in San Diego where he spent three years primarily responsible for business development. In March 2006, Koster left the company to work on Metaplace which, at the end, was a social gaming platform for Facebook games. Since 2013 he is an independent designer and consultant.

Koster is a charter member of the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences, and a member of the IGDA, ASCAP, and Omicron Delta Kappa. He is also a frequent speaker at game industry conferences such as the GDC, DICE, State of Play, and E3. He presently lives in San Diego, California with his wife and family.

In 2019, Koster and Eric Goldberg founded a new company, Playable Worlds, focused on producing the MMORPG, Stars Reach.

<doc id="1281835" wikidata="Q220528" url="?curid=1281835" title="Rebetiko">
<text>Rebetiko (, ), plural rebetika ( ), occasionally transliterated as rembetiko or rebetico, is a term used today to designate originally disparate kinds of urban Greek music which in the 1930s went through a process of musical syncretism and developed into a more distinctive musical genre. Rebetiko briefly can be described as the urban popular song of the Greeks, especially the poorest, from the late 19th century to the 1950s, and served as the basis for further developments in popular Greek music. The music, which was partly forgotten, was rediscovered during the so-called rebetika revival, which started in the 1960s and developed further from the early 1970s onwards. 

In 2017 rebetiko was added in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.

== Definition and etymology ==

The word (plural ) is an adjectival form derived from the Greek word (, ). The word is today construed to mean a person who embodies aspects of character, dress, behavior, morals and ethics associated with a particular subculture. The etymology of the word remains the subject of dispute and uncertainty; an early scholar of rebetiko, Elias Petropoulos, and the modern Greek lexicographer Giorgos Babiniotis, both offer various suggested derivations, but leave the question open. The earliest source of the word to date is to be found in a Greek-Latin dictionary published in Leiden, Holland in 1614 where the word is defined as a &#x27;wanderer&#x27;, &#x27;blind&#x27;, &#x27;misguided&#x27;, etc.

== Musical bases ==
Although nowadays treated as a single genre, rebetiko is, musically speaking, a synthesis of elements of European music, the music of the various areas of the Greek mainland and the Greek islands, Greek Orthodox ecclesiastical chant, often referred to as Byzantine music, and the modal traditions of Ottoman art music and café music.

=== Melody and harmony ===
The melodies of most rebetiko songs are thus often considered to follow one or more (, Greek for &#x27;roads&#x27; or &#x27;routes&#x27;; singular is (). The names of the are derived in all but a few cases from the names of various Turkish modes, also known as &quot;makam&quot;.

However, the majority of rebetiko songs have been accompanied by instruments capable of playing chords according to the Western harmonic system, and have thereby been harmonized in a manner which corresponds neither with conventional European harmony, nor with Ottoman art music, which is a monophonic form normally not harmonized. Furthermore, rebetika has come to be played on instruments tuned in equal temperament, in direct conflict with the more complex pitch divisions of the system.

During the later period of the rebetiko revival there has been a cultural entente between Greek and Turkish musicians, mostly of the younger generations. One consequence of this has been a tendency to overemphasize the aspect of rebetiko at the expense of the European components and, most significantly, at the expense of perceiving and problematizing this music&#x27;s truly syncretic nature.

However it is important to note in this context that a considerable proportion of the rebetiko repertoire on Greek records until 1936 was not dramatically different, except in terms of language and musical &quot;dialect&quot;, from Ottoman café music (played by musicians of various ethnic backgrounds) which the mainland Greeks called &quot;Smyrneika&quot;. This portion of the recorded repertoire was played almost exclusively on the instruments of /Ottoman café music, such as kanonaki, santouri, politikí lyra (), (, actually identical with the Hungarian cimbalom, or the Romanian țambal), and clarinet.

=== Scales ===
The scales used in rebetiko music are the traditional western major and minor scales, as well as a series of eastern makams, influenced by the Ottoman classical music. Some of them include rast, uşşâk, hijaz (or &quot;phrygian dominant scale&quot;), and nahawand.

=== Rhythms ===
Most rebetiko songs are based on traditional Greek or Anatolian dance rhythms. Most common are:
* Syrtos, a general name for many Greek dances (including the Nisiotika), (mostly a meter in various forms)
* Zeibekiko, a or a meter, in its various forms
* Hasaposervikos, including various kinds of Greek music. It is also the fast version of &quot;hasapiko&quot; (like and meter)
* Hasapiko, a meter and the fast version &quot;hasaposerviko&quot; in a meter
* Antikristos or Karsilamas and &quot;argilamas&quot; (a meter)
* Kamilierikos (a meter) and &quot;aptalikos&quot;, broken down into sixteenths, (slow version a and fast version a meter in various forms
* Tsifteteli, cheerful dance for women (a )
* Bolero, in a few songs, mainly for guitar (a )

Various other rhythms are used too.

=== Taxim ===
There is one component within the rebetiko tradition which is common to many musical styles within Eastern musical spheres. This is the freely improvised unmeasured prelude, within a given /, which can occur at the beginning or in the middle of a song. This is known in Greek as or ( or ) after the Arabic word usually transliterated as &quot;taqsim&quot; or .

==Instruments==
The first rebetiko songs to be recorded, as mentioned above, were mostly in Ottoman/Smyrna style, employing instruments of the Ottoman tradition. During the second half of the 1930s, as rebetiko music gradually acquired its own character, the bouzouki began to emerge as the emblematic instrument of this music, gradually ousting the instruments which had been brought over from Asia Minor.

=== The bouzouki ===
The bouzouki was apparently not particularly well-known among the refugees from Asia Minor, but had been known by that name in Greece since at least 1835, from which year a drawing by the Danish artist Martinus Rørbye has survived. It is a view of the studio of the Athenian luthier Leonidas Gailas (), whom the artist describes as . The drawing clearly shows a number of bouzouki-like instruments. Despite this evidence, we still know nothing of the early history of the instrument&#x27;s association with what came to be called rebetiko. Recent research has however uncovered a number of hitherto unknown references to the instrument during the 19th and early 20th centuries, including evidence of its established presence in the Peloponnese.

Although known in the rebetiko context, and often referred to in song lyrics, well before it was allowed into the recording studio, the bouzouki was first commercially recorded not in Greece, but in America, in 1926, when the Peloponnesian musician Konstandinos Kokotis (1878 – after 1948) recorded two Peloponnesian folk songs with the accordionist Ioannis Sfondilias. This recording, reissued for the first time in 2013, reveals a &quot;folk&quot; melodic style never recorded before or since. The first recording to feature the instrument clearly in a recognisable somewhat more &quot;modern&quot; melodic role, was made in 1929, in New York. Three years later the first true bouzouki solo was recorded by Ioannis Halikias, also in New York, in January 1932.

In Greece the bouzouki had been allowed into a studio for the first time a few months previously, in October 1931. In the hands of Thanassis Manetas (1870-ca 1943), together with the player Yiannis Livadhitis, it can be heard accompanying the singers Konstantinos Masselos, aka Nouros, and Spahanis, on two discs, three songs in all.

These early commercial recordings in America and in Greece had however been preceded by a group of documentary recordings, consisting of one shellac 78 rpm disc and five wax cylinders, made in Görlitz, Germany in July 1917, during WWI. The amateur bouzouki player Konstandinos Kalamaras accompanied a professional Byzantine singer, Konstandinos Vorgias, and an amateur singer, Apostolos Papadiamantis. These three men were among 6500 Greek soldiers interned as guests of Germany in an ex-POW camp in the small town of Görlitz at the Polish border, from September 1916 until their release in February 1919.

It was not until October 1932, in the wake of the success of Halikias&#x27; New York recording, which immediately met with great success in Greece, that Markos Vamvakaris made his first recordings with the bouzouki. These recordings marked the real beginning of the bouzouki&#x27;s recorded career in Greece, a career which continues unbroken to the present day.

=== Other instruments ===
The core instruments of rebetiko, from the mid-1930s onwards, have been the bouzouki, the baglamas and the guitar. Other instruments included accordion, politiki (Constantinopolitan) lyra (sometimes other lyra were used), clarinet, kanonaki, oud, santur, violin and finger-cymbals. Other instruments heard on rebetiko recordings include: double bass, laouto, mandola, mandolin and piano. In some recordings, the sound of clinking glass may be heard. This sound is produced by drawing worry beads () against a fluted drinking glass, originally an ad hoc and supremely effective rhythmic instrument, probably characteristic of teké and taverna milieux, and subsequently adopted in the recording studios.

== Lyrics ==
Like several other urban subcultural musical forms such as the blues, flamenco, fado, bal-musette and tango, rebetiko grew out of particular urban circumstances. Often its lyrics reflect the harsher realities of a marginalized subculture&#x27;s lifestyle. Thus one finds themes such as crime, drink, drugs, poverty, prostitution and violence, but also a multitude of themes of relevance to Greek people of any social stratum: death, eroticism, exile, exoticism, disease, love, marriage, matchmaking, the mother figure, war, work, and diverse other everyday matters, both happy and sad.

Manos Hatzidakis summarized the key elements in three words with a wide presence in the vocabulary of modern Greek , , and (, , : love, joy, and sorrow).

A perhaps over-emphasized theme of rebetiko is the pleasure of using drugs (cocaine, heroin- etc.), but especially hashish. Rebetiko songs emphasizing such matters have come to be called (), although musically speaking they do not differ from the main body of rebetiko songs in any particular way.

== Culture ==
Rebetiko is closely related with nightlife entertainment: ouzeri, taverna (Greek tavern) and night centres.

Rebetiko is also sometimes related with the icon of &quot;mangas&quot; (, ), which means &quot;strong&quot; &quot;guy&quot; that &quot;needs correction&quot;, a social group in the Belle Époque era&#x27;s counterculture of Greece (especially of the great urban centers: Athens, Piraeus, and Thessaloniki).

Mangas was a label for men belonging to the working class, behaving in a particularly arrogant/presumptuous way, and dressing with a very typical vesture composed of a woolen hat (, ), a jacket (they usually wore only one of its sleeves), a tight belt (used as a knife case), stripe pants, and pointy shoes. Other features of their appearance were their long moustache, their bead chaplets (, sing. ), and their idiosyncratic manneristic limp-walking (). A related social group were the Koutsavakides (, sing. ); the two terms are occasionally used interchangeably.

== History ==

Initially a music associated with the lower classes, rebetiko later reached greater general acceptance as the rough edges of its overt subcultural character were softened and polished, sometimes to the point of unrecognizability. Then, when the original form was almost forgotten, and its original protagonists either dead, or in some cases almost consigned to oblivion, it became, from the 1960s onwards, a revived musical form of wide popularity, especially among younger people of the time.

=== Origins ===
Rebetiko probably originated in the music of the large (mainly) coastal cities with large Greek communities of western Anatolia during the Ottoman era. In these cities the cradles of rebetiko were likely the ouzeri, the hashish dens () with hookahs, coffee shops and even the prison. In view of the paucity of documentation prior to the era of sound recordings it is difficult to assert further facts on the very early history of this music. There is a certain amount of recorded Greek material from the first two decades of the 20th century, recorded in Constantinople/Istanbul, in Egypt and in America, of which isolated examples have some bearing on rebetiko, such as in the first case of the use of the word itself on a record label. But there are no recordings from this early period which give an inkling of the local music of Piraeus such as first emerged on disc in 1931 (see above).

=== Smyrna style (Smyrneïko) ===


During the early 20th century, the main centre of rebetiko music was the multi-national port of Smyrna (modern İzmir) in Asia Minor. The musicians of Smyrna were influenced not only from the eastern sounds inside the Ottoman empire, but also from the European-style music of the many European communities of the city, most notably the Italians. Smyrneiki Estudiantina was a group of musicians playing popular music for Greeks worldwide. After the Great fire of Smyrna many of them (Panagiotis Toundas, Spyros Peristeris, Giorgos Vidalis, Anestis Delias and others) fled to Greece contributing to the development of the rebetiko style music in Greece.

=== 1922–1932 ===

In the wake of the Asia Minor Catastrophe and the population exchange of 1923, huge numbers of refugees settled in Piraeus, Thessaloniki, Volos and other harbor cities. They brought with them both European and Anatolian musical instruments and musical elements, including Ottoman café music, and, often neglected in accounts of this music, a somewhat Italianate style with mandolins and choral singing in parallel thirds and sixths.

Many of these Greek musicians from Asia Minor were highly competent musicians. Initially an &quot;Athenean Estudiantina&quot; was established with Giorgos Vidalis and some musicians of the old Smyrneiki Estudiantina. Other musicians became studio directors (A&amp;R men) for the major companies, for example Spyros Peristeris (who played mandolin, guitar, piano and later bouzouki), Panagiotis Toundas (primarily a mandolinist) and the violin virtuoso Giannis Dragatsis (Oghdhondakis). The musical personalities of Peristeris and Toundas in particular came to have enormous influence on the further development of recorded rebetiko. While from the middle of the 1920s a substantial number of Anatolian-style songs were recorded in Greece, examples of Piraeus-style rebetiko song first reached shellac in 1931 (see above).

=== 1930s ===
During the 1930s, the relatively sophisticated musical styles met with, and cross-fertilised, with the more heavy-hitting local urban styles exemplified by the earliest recordings of Markos Vamvakaris and Batis.

This historical process has led to a currently used terminology intended to distinguish between the clearly Asia Minor oriental style, often called &quot;&quot;, and the bouzouki-based style of the 1930s, often called Piraeus style. Also, the use of mandolin totally vanished.

By the end of the 1930s rebetiko had reached what can reasonably be called its classic phase, in which elements of the early Piraeus style, elements of the Asia Minor style, clearly European and Greek folk music elements, had fused to generate a genuinely syncretic musical form. Simultaneously, with the onset of censorship, a process began in which rebetiko lyrics slowly began to lose what had been their defining underworld character. This process extended over more than a decade.

===Metaxas censorship, new directions=== 

In 1936, the 4th of August Regime under Ioannis Metaxas was established and with it, the onset of censorship. Some of the subject matter of rebetiko songs was now considered disreputable and unacceptable. During this period, when the Metaxas dictatorship subjected all song lyrics to censorship, song composers would rewrite lyrics, or practice self-censorship before submitting lyrics for approval. The music itself was not subject to censorship, although proclamations were made recommending the &quot;Europeanisation&quot; of the regarded outcoming Anatolian music, which led to certain radio stations banning in 1938, i.e. on the basis of music rather than lyrics. This was, however, not bouzouki music. The term , (sing. , Gr. , sing. ) refers to a kind of improvised sung lament, in ummeasured time, sung in a particular &quot;/&quot;. The were perhaps the most pointedly oriental kind of songs in the Greek repertoire of the time.

Metaxas closed also all the (hashish dens) in the country. References to drugs and other criminal or disreputable activities now vanished from recordings made in Greek studios, to reappear briefly in the first recordings made at the resumption of recording activity in 1946. In the United States, however, a flourishing Greek musical production continued, with song lyrics apparently unaffected by censorship, (see below) although, strangely, the bouzouki continued to be rare on American recordings until after WWII.

It is notable that Rebetiko music was also rejected by the Greek Left because of its &quot;reactionary&quot; (according to the Communist Party of Greece) and subculture character and the drug references.

=== Postwar period ===
Recording activities ceased during the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II (1941–1944), and did not resume until 1946; that year, during a very short period, a handful of uncensored songs with drug references were recorded, several in multiple versions with different singers.

The scene was soon popularized further by stars like Vassilis Tsitsanis. His musical career had started in 1936, and continued during the war despite the occupation. A musical genius, he was both a brilliant bouzouki player and a prolific composer, with hundreds of songs to his credit. After the war he continued to develop his style in new directions, and under his wing, singers such as Sotiria Bellou, Ioanna Georgakopoulou, Stella Haskil and Marika Ninou made their appearance. Tsitsanis developed the &quot;westernization&quot; of the rebetiko and made it more known to large sections of the population, setting also the bases for the future &quot;laiko&quot;.

In 1948 Manos Hatzidakis shook the musical establishment by delivering his legendary lecture on rebetiko, until then with heavy underworld and cannabis use connections and consequently looked down upon. Hatzidakis focused on the economy of expression, the deep traditional roots and the genuineness of emotion displayed in rembetika, and exalted the likes of composers like Markos Vamvakaris and Vassilis Tsitsanis. Putting theory into practice, he adapted classic rembetika in his 1951 piano work, &quot;Six Folk Paintings&quot; (&quot;Έξι Λαϊκές Ζωγραφιές&quot;), which was later also presented as a folk ballet.

Parallel to the post-war career of Tsitsanis, the career of Manolis Chiotis took rebetiko and the Greek popular music in more radically new directions. Chiotis developed much more the &quot;europeanisation/westernization&quot; of the rebetiko. In 1953 he added a fourth pair of strings to the bouzouki, which allowed it to be played as a guitar and set the stage for the future &#x27;electrification&#x27; of rebetiko.

Chiotis was also a bold innovator, importing Latin and South American rhythms (such as flamenco, rumba, mambo etc.), and concentrating on songs in a decidedly lighter vein than the characteristic ambiance of rebetiko songs. Perhaps most significantly of all, Chiotis, himself a virtuoso not only on the bouzouki but on guitar, violin and oud, was responsible for introducing and popularizing the modified 4-stringed bouzouki () in 1956. Chiotis was already a seemingly fully-fledged virtuoso on the traditional 3-stringed instrument by his teens, but the guitar-based tuning of his new instrument, in combination with his playful delight in extreme virtuosity, led to new concepts of bouzouki playing which came to define the style used in (laiko) and other forms of bouzouki music, which however could no longer really be called rebetiko in any sense.

A comparable development also took place on the vocal side. In 1952 a young singer named Stelios Kazantzidis recorded a couple of rebetika songs that were quite successful. Although he would continue in the same style for a few years it was quickly realized, by all parties involved, that his singing technique and expressive abilities were too good to be contained within the rebetiko idiom. Soon well-known composers of rebetika—like Kaldaras, Chiotis, Klouvatos—started to write songs tailored to Stelios powerful voice and this created a further shift in rebetika music. The new songs had a more complex melodic structure and were usually more dramatic in character. Kazantzidis went on to become a star of the emerging laiki music.

Kazantzidis, however, did not only contribute to the demise of classical rebetika (of the Piraeus style that is). Paradoxically, he was also one of the forerunners of its revival. In 1956 he started his cooperation with Vassilis Tsitsanis who, in addition to writing new songs for Kazantzidis, also gave him some of his old ones to reinterpret. Kazantzidis, thus, sung and popularized such rebetika classics as &quot; (Clouded Sunday), &quot; and &quot;&quot;. These songs, and many others, previously unknown to the wider public, suddenly became cherished and sought-after.

At about the same time many of the old time performers—both singers and bouzouki players—abandoned the musical scene of Greece. Some of them died prematurely (Haskil, Ninou), others emigrated to the US (Binis, Evgenikos, Tzouanakos, Kaplanis), while some quit music life for other work (Pagioumtzis, Genitsaris). This, of course, created a void which had to be filled with new blood. In the beginning the new recruits—like for example Dalia, Grey and Kazantzidis—stayed within the bounds of classical rebetica. Soon, however, their youthful enthusiasm and different experiences found expression in new stylistic venues which eventually changed the old idiom.

This combined situation contributed, during the 1950s, to the almost total eclipse of rebetiko by other popular styles. By the late 1950s, rebetiko had declined; it only survived in the form of (, &#x27;posh rebetiko&#x27; or &#x27;bourgeois rebetiko&#x27;), a refined style of rebetiko that was far more accepted by the upper class than the traditional form of the genre.

In fact, somewhat confusingly, from at least the 1950s, during which period rebetiko songs were not usually referred to as a separate musical category, but more specifically on the basis of lyrics, the term (), or , () covered a broad range of Greek popular music, including songs with the bouzouki, and songs that today would without doubt be classified as rebetiko. The term in its turn derives from the word () which translates best as &#x27;the people&#x27;.

=== The revival ===

The first phase of the rebetiko revival can perhaps be said to have begun around 1960. In that year the singer Grigoris Bithikotsis recorded a number of songs by Markos Vamvakaris, and Vamvakaris himself made his first recording since 1954. During the same period, writers such as Elias Petropoulos began researching and publishing their earliest attempts to write on rebetiko as a subject in itself. The bouzouki, unquestioned as the basic musical instrument of rebetiko music, now began to make inroads into other areas of Greek music, not least due to the virtuosity of Manolis Chiotis. From 1960 onwards prominent Greek composers such as Mikis Theodorakis and Manos Hatzidakis employed bouzouki virtuosi such as Manolis Chiotis, Giorgos Zambetas, and Thanassis Polyhandriotis in their recordings.

The next phase of the rebetiko revival can be said to have started in the beginning of the 1970s, when LP reissues of 78 rpm recordings, both anthologies and records devoted to individual artists, began to appear in larger numbers. This phase of the revival was initially, and is still to a large extent, characterized by a desire to recapture the style of the original recordings, whereas the first phase tended to present old songs in the current musical idiom of Greek popular music, . Many singers emerged and became popular during this period. It was during the 1970s that the first work which aimed at popularizing rebetiko outside the Greek language sphere appeared and the first English-language academic work was completed.

During the 1970s a number of older artists made new recordings of the older repertoire, accompanied by bouzouki players of a younger generation. Giorgios Mouflouzelis, for example, recorded a number of LPs, though he had never recorded during his youth in the 78 rpm era. The most significant contribution in this respect was perhaps a series of LPs recorded by the singer Sotiria Bellou, who had had a fairly successful career from 1947 onwards, initially under the wing of Tsitsanis. These newer recordings were instrumental in bringing rebetiko to the ears of many who were unfamiliar with the recordings of the 78 rpm era, and are still available today as CDs.

An important aspect of the revival of the late 1960s and early 1970s was the element of protest, resistance and revolt against the military dictatorship of the junta years. This was perhaps because rebetiko lyrics, although seldom directly political, were easily construed as subversive by the nature of their subject matter and their association in popular memory with previous periods of conflict.

Rebetiko in its original form was revived during the Junta of 1967–1974, when the Regime of the Colonels banned it. After the end of the Junta, many revival groups (and solo artists) appeared. The most notable of them include Opisthodhromiki Kompania, Rembetiki Kompania, Babis Tsertos, Agathonas Iakovidis and others.

Giorgos Dalaras in 1975 decided to release his own renditions of rebetiko songs on the double LP &quot;50&quot; (50 , &quot;50 Years of Rebetiko Songs&quot;). The recording proved an immediate success, despite the toning down of the lyrics. However, as a result, a new movement was set to take place in Greek music, and the once forgotten were finding themselves performing, in some cases for the first time in 30 to 40 years. He followed up this work with an LP in 1980, (, &quot; Rebetiko (songs) of the occupation&quot;), which was a more gritty and meaty release, more faithful to the tone of the original rebetika as heard in the 1930s. However, again references to drugs were cut out, and only mentioned in passing. Unlike the previous double LP, this one contained some of the original musicians, Bayianteras and Genitsaris in particular making an appearance on the album.

=== Modern times ===
Today, rebetiko songs are still popular in Greece, both in contemporary interpretations which make no attempt to be other than contemporary in style, and in interpretations aspiring to emulate the old styles. The genre is a subject of growing international research, and its popularity outside Greece is now well-established.

Some of the musicians and singers of the genre include Babis Tsertos, Babis Goles and Agathonas Iakovidis.

In 2012, Vinicio Capossela released his music album .

== In the United States ==
Greek emigration to the United States started in earnest towards the end of the 19th century. From then onwards, and in the years following the Asia Minor Disaster, until immigration became restricted in the mid-1920s, a great number of Greeks emigrated to the United States, bringing their musical traditions with them. American companies began recording Greek music performed by these immigrants as early as 1896. The first Greek-American recording enterprises made their appearance in 1919. From the latter years of the second decade of the century there exist a number of recordings that can be considered as rebetiko, a few years before such songs began to appear on recordings in Greece.

The music industry in the United States came to play a particular role from the mid-1930s onwards in recording rebetiko lyrics which would not have passed the censors in Greece. This phenomenon came to repeat itself during the period of the Greek military junta of 1967–1974. A notable example of American recording studios permitting some &#x27;bolder&#x27; lyrics can be found in the LP (, &quot;When They Smoke The Hookah&quot;) by Apostolos Nikolaidis, released in 1973. Releasing this album in Greece, with its overt references to various aspects of drug use, would have been impossible at that time. It is worth noting, however, that the censorship laws invoked in Greece by Metaxas were never officially revoked until 1981, seven years after the fall of the junta. A further characteristic of American Greek recordings of the time was the recording of songs in the Anatolian musical styles of rebetiko, which continued in the United States well into the 1950s. Even songs originally recorded with typical bouzouki-baglamas-guitar accompaniment could appear in Anatolian garments.

After WWII, beginning in the early 1950s, many Greek rebetiko musicians and singers traveled from Greece to tour the United States, and some stayed for longer periods. Prominent among them were Ioannis Papaioannou, Manolis Chiotis, Vassilis Tsitsanis, Iordanis Tsomidis, Roza Eskenazi, Stratos Pagioumtzis, Stavros Tzouanakos and Giannis Tatasopoulos, of whom the latter three died in the United States.

==Rebetiko rock==
Rebetiko rock is a music genre that fuses the elements of rock music and rebetiko. Hard rock and the Greek folk music are also a major influence on rebetiko rock.

== Performers of rebetiko on 78 rpm recordings ==
== Discography ==
Much rebetiko is issued in Greece on CDs which quickly go out of print. Since the 1990s a considerable number of high quality CD productions of historical rebetiko have been released by various European and American labels. The following select discography includes some of these historical anthologies, which are likely to be available in English speaking countries, plus a few Greek issues. All are CDs unless otherwise noted. The emphasis on English-language releases in this discography is motivated both by their consistently high sound quality and by their inclusion, in many cases, of copious information in English, which tends to be lacking in Greek issues.

<text>Aura Herzog ( ( Ambache, 24 December 1924 – 10 January 2022) was an Israeli social and environmental activist, who served as the First Lady of Israel from 1983 to 1993; she was the wife of Chaim Herzog, the sixth President of the State of Israel and mother of the current president, Isaac Herzog. In 1968, she founded the Council for a Beautiful Israel.

==Biography==
=== Early life and work ===
Aura Ambache was born in Ismailia, Egypt, on 24 December 1924, to an Ashkenazi Jewish family of Russian Jewish and Polish Jewish descent. Her parents were Leah Steinberg (daughter of Yechiel Michal Steinberg, the founding family of Motza, a village on the outskirts of Jerusalem), and Simcha Ambache (Hebrew acronym for &quot;ani ma&#x27;amin b&#x27;emunah shleima&quot; - I believe in complete faith), an engineer by profession. Aura&#x27;s sister Suzy married Israeli diplomat Abba Eban.

The family was originally from Jaffa, but relocated to Egypt after they were expelled by the Turks during World War I. Herzog attended French schools in Ismailia and Cairo and completed her BA in mathematics and physics at the University of Witwatersrand, South Africa.

In October 1946, Herzog immigrated to Mandatory Palestine. The following year, she was chosen to participate in the first class of the Diplomatic School established by the Jewish Agency. She was a member of the Haganah, a Jewish paramilitary organization in the British Mandate of Palestine (1921–48). In 1947, she married Chaim Herzog and the couple had four children, namely Yoel (born 1949), an attorney and former Brigadier General, Michael (born 1952), the Israeli Ambassador to the United States, Isaac (born 1960), the current President of Israel and Ronit (born 1965), a clinical psychologist.

On 11 March 1948, she was seriously injured in a bombing attack on the Jewish Agency building in the National Institutions House in Jerusalem. During the War of Independence she served as an intelligence officer in the newly founded Science Corps and intelligence department Number 2 (Unit 8200).

===Diplomatic career and public service===
From 1950 to 1954, she accompanied her husband to the United States, where he was sent as a military attache, and again from 1975 to 1978, when he served as ambassador to the United Nations.

In 1958, Herzog headed the committee that organized Israel&#x27;s 10th anniversary celebrations and initiated the first International Bible Contest, which takes place annually on Israel Independence Day.

From 1959 to 1968, she headed the Department of Culture in the Ministry of Education and Culture and was a member of the Council for Arts and Culture. In 1969, she founded the Council for a Beautiful Israel, a leading environmental protection NGO and chaired it for 38 years, after which she became its international president.

After the end of her husband&#x27;s presidency and her own tenure as first lady, she held various positions: Chairperson of the Public Committee for the celebration of Israel&#x27;s Jubilee celebration (1998), Member of the Public Advisory Board of Mifal Hapayis (Israel&#x27;s national lottery), Member of the Board of Governors of the Tel Aviv Museum, and Chairperson of Friends of Schneider association at Schneider Children&#x27;s Medical Center of Israel.

===Later life===
Aura Herzog died on 10 January 2022, at the age of 97. She is buried alongside her husband and a number of other Israeli leaders in Jerusalem’s Mount Herzl national cemetery. In his eulogy, her son President Isaac Herzog paid tribute to her as “an extremely loving mother for all of us, a source of strength, an engine with incredible energies.”

==Published works==
In 1971, she published &quot;Secrets of Hospitality,&quot; a manual on hospitality, manners and customs.

<text>&quot;Q&quot;-learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm that trains an agent to assign values to its possible actions based on its current state, without requiring a model of the environment (model-free). It can handle problems with stochastic transitions and rewards without requiring adaptations.

For example, in a grid maze, an agent learns to reach an exit worth 10 points. At a junction, Q-learning might assign a higher value to moving right than left if right gets to the exit faster, improving this choice by trying both directions over time.

For any finite Markov decision process, &quot;Q&quot;-learning finds an optimal policy in the sense of maximizing the expected value of the total reward over any and all successive steps, starting from the current state. &quot;Q&quot;-learning can identify an optimal action-selection policy for any given finite Markov decision process, given infinite exploration time and a partly random policy. 

&quot;Q&quot; refers to the function that the algorithm computes: the expected reward—that is, the &quot;quality&quot;—of an action taken in a given state.

== Reinforcement learning ==

Reinforcement learning involves an agent, a set of &quot;states&quot; formula_1, and a set formula_2 of &quot;actions&quot; per state. By performing an action formula_3, the agent transitions from state to state. Executing an action in a specific state provides the agent with a &quot;reward&quot; (a numerical score).

The goal of the agent is to maximize its total reward. It does this by adding the maximum reward attainable from future states to the reward for achieving its current state, effectively influencing the current action by the potential future reward. This potential reward is a weighted sum of expected values of the rewards of all future steps starting from the current state.

As an example, consider the process of boarding a train, in which the reward is measured by the negative of the total time spent boarding (alternatively, the cost of boarding the train is equal to the boarding time). One strategy is to enter the train door as soon as they open, minimizing the initial wait time for yourself. If the train is crowded, however, then you will have a slow entry after the initial action of entering the door as people are fighting you to depart the train as you attempt to board. The total boarding time, or cost, is then:

* 0 seconds wait time + 15 seconds fight time

On the next day, by random chance (exploration), you decide to wait and let other people depart first. This initially results in a longer wait time. However, less time is spent fighting the departing passengers. Overall, this path has a higher reward than that of the previous day, since the total boarding time is now:

* 5 second wait time + 0 second fight time

Through exploration, despite the initial (patient) action resulting in a larger cost (or negative reward) than in the forceful strategy, the overall cost is lower, thus revealing a more rewarding strategy.

== Algorithm ==

After formula_4 steps into the future the agent will decide some next step. The weight for this step is calculated as formula_5, where formula_6 (the &quot;discount factor&quot;) is a number between 0 and 1 (formula_7). Assuming formula_8, it has the effect of valuing rewards received earlier higher than those received later (reflecting the value of a &quot;good start&quot;). formula_9 may also be interpreted as the probability to succeed (or survive) at every step formula_4.

The algorithm, therefore, has a function that calculates the quality of a state–action combination:

:formula_11.

Before learning begins, is initialized to a possibly arbitrary fixed value (chosen by the programmer). Then, at each time formula_12 the agent selects an action formula_13, observes a reward formula_14, enters a new state formula_15 (that may depend on both the previous state formula_16 and the selected action), and formula_17 is updated. The core of the algorithm is a Bellman equation as a simple value iteration update, using the weighted average of the current value and the new information:

:formula_18

where &quot;formula_14&quot; is the reward received when moving from the state formula_20 to the state formula_15, and formula_22 is the learning rate formula_23.

Note that formula_24 is the sum of three factors:

* formula_25: the current value (weighted by one minus the learning rate)
* formula_26: the reward formula_14 to obtain if action formula_13 is taken when in state formula_16 (weighted by learning rate)
*formula_30: the maximum reward that can be obtained from state formula_15(weighted by learning rate and discount factor)

An episode of the algorithm ends when state formula_15 is a final or &quot;terminal state&quot;. However, &quot;Q&quot;-learning can also learn in non-episodic tasks (as a result of the property of convergent infinite series). If the discount factor is lower than 1, the action values are finite even if the problem can contain infinite loops.

For all final states formula_33, formula_34 is never updated, but is set to the reward value formula_35 observed for state formula_33. In most cases, formula_37 can be taken to equal zero.

==Influence of variables==

=== Learning rate ===
The learning rate or &quot;step size&quot; determines to what extent newly acquired information overrides old information. A factor of 0 makes the agent learn nothing (exclusively exploiting prior knowledge), while a factor of 1 makes the agent consider only the most recent information (ignoring prior knowledge to explore possibilities). In fully deterministic environments, a learning rate of formula_38 is optimal. When the problem is stochastic, the algorithm converges under some technical conditions on the learning rate that require it to decrease to zero. In practice, often a constant learning rate is used, such as formula_39 for all formula_12.

=== Discount factor ===
The discount factor determines the importance of future rewards. A factor of 0 will make the agent &quot;myopic&quot; (or short-sighted) by only considering current rewards, i.e. formula_41 (in the update rule above), while a factor approaching 1 will make it strive for a long-term high reward. If the discount factor meets or exceeds 1, the action values may diverge. For , without a terminal state, or if the agent never reaches one, all environment histories become infinitely long, and utilities with additive, undiscounted rewards generally become infinite. Even with a discount factor only slightly lower than 1, &quot;Q&quot;-function learning leads to propagation of errors and instabilities when the value function is approximated with an artificial neural network. In that case, starting with a lower discount factor and increasing it towards its final value accelerates learning.

=== Initial conditions (&quot;Q&quot;0) ===
Since &quot;Q&quot;-learning is an iterative algorithm, it implicitly assumes an initial condition before the first update occurs. High initial values, also known as &quot;optimistic initial conditions&quot;, can encourage exploration: no matter what action is selected, the update rule will cause it to have lower values than the other alternative, thus increasing their choice probability. The first reward formula_35 can be used to reset the initial conditions. According to this idea, the first time an action is taken the reward is used to set the value of formula_17. This allows immediate learning in case of fixed deterministic rewards. A model that incorporates &quot;reset of initial conditions&quot; (RIC) is expected to predict participants&#x27; behavior better than a model that assumes any &quot;arbitrary initial condition&quot; (AIC). RIC seems to be consistent with human behaviour in repeated binary choice experiments.

== Implementation ==
&quot;Q&quot;-learning at its simplest stores data in tables. This approach falters with increasing numbers of states/actions since the likelihood of the agent visiting a particular state and performing a particular action is increasingly small.

=== Function approximation ===
&quot;Q&quot;-learning can be combined with function approximation. This makes it possible to apply the algorithm to larger problems, even when the state space is continuous.

One solution is to use an (adapted) artificial neural network as a function approximator. Another possibility is to integrate Fuzzy Rule Interpolation (FRI) and use sparse fuzzy rule-bases instead of discrete Q-tables or ANNs, which has the advantage of being a human-readable knowledge representation form. Function approximation may speed up learning in finite problems, due to the fact that the algorithm can generalize earlier experiences to previously unseen states.

=== Quantization ===
Another technique to decrease the state/action space quantizes possible values. Consider the example of learning to balance a stick on a finger. To describe a state at a certain point in time involves the position of the finger in space, its velocity, the angle of the stick and the angular velocity of the stick. This yields a four-element vector that describes one state, i.e. a snapshot of one state encoded into four values. The problem is that infinitely many possible states are present. To shrink the possible space of valid actions multiple values can be assigned to a bucket. The exact distance of the finger from its starting position (-Infinity to Infinity) is not known, but rather whether it is far away or not (Near, Far).

== History ==
&quot;Q&quot;-learning was introduced by Chris Watkins in 1989. A convergence proof was presented by Watkins and Peter Dayan in 1992.

Watkins was addressing “Learning from delayed rewards”, the title of his PhD thesis. Eight years earlier in 1981 the same problem, under the name of “Delayed reinforcement learning”, was solved by Bozinovski&#x27;s Crossbar Adaptive Array (CAA). The memory matrix formula_44 was the same as the eight years later Q-table of Q-learning. The architecture introduced the term “state evaluation” in reinforcement learning. The crossbar learning algorithm, written in mathematical pseudocode in the paper, in each iteration performs the following computation:

* In state perform action ;
* Receive consequence state ; 
* Compute state evaluation ; 
* Update crossbar value formula_45.

The term “secondary reinforcement” is borrowed from animal learning theory, to model state values via backpropagation: the state value of the consequence situation is backpropagated to the previously encountered situations. CAA computes state values vertically and actions horizontally (the &quot;crossbar&quot;). Demonstration graphs showing delayed reinforcement learning contained states (desirable, undesirable, and neutral states), which were computed by the state evaluation function. This learning system was a forerunner of the Q-learning algorithm.

In 2014, Google DeepMind patented an application of Q-learning to deep learning, titled &quot;deep reinforcement learning&quot; or &quot;deep Q-learning&quot; that can play Atari 2600 games at expert human levels.

== Variants ==

=== Deep Q-learning ===
The DeepMind system used a deep convolutional neural network, with layers of tiled convolutional filters to mimic the effects of receptive fields. Reinforcement learning is unstable or divergent when a nonlinear function approximator such as a neural network is used to represent Q. This instability comes from the correlations present in the sequence of observations, the fact that small updates to Q may significantly change the policy of the agent and the data distribution, and the correlations between Q and the target values. The method can be used for stochastic search in various domains and applications.

The technique used &quot;experience replay,&quot; a biologically inspired mechanism that uses a random sample of prior actions instead of the most recent action to proceed. This removes correlations in the observation sequence and smooths changes in the data distribution. Iterative updates adjust Q towards target values that are only periodically updated, further reducing correlations with the target.

=== Double Q-learning ===
Because the future maximum approximated action value in Q-learning is evaluated using the same Q function as in current action selection policy, in noisy environments Q-learning can sometimes overestimate the action values, slowing the learning. A variant called Double Q-learning was proposed to correct this. Double Q-learning is an off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm, where a different policy is used for value evaluation than what is used to select the next action.

In practice, two separate value functions formula_46 and formula_47 are trained in a mutually symmetric fashion using separate experiences. The double Q-learning update step is then as follows:
:formula_48, and
:formula_49

Now the estimated value of the discounted future is evaluated using a different policy, which solves the overestimation issue.

This algorithm was later modified in 2015 and combined with deep learning, as in the DQN algorithm, resulting in Double DQN, which outperforms the original DQN algorithm.

=== Others ===
Delayed Q-learning is an alternative implementation of the online &quot;Q&quot;-learning algorithm, with probably approximately correct (PAC) learning.

Greedy GQ is a variant of &quot;Q&quot;-learning to use in combination with (linear) function approximation. The advantage of Greedy GQ is that convergence is guaranteed even when function approximation is used to estimate the action values.

Distributional Q-learning is a variant of &quot;Q&quot;-learning which seeks to model the distribution of returns rather than the expected return of each action. It has been observed to facilitate estimate by deep neural networks and can enable alternative control methods, such as risk-sensitive control.

=== Multi-agent learning ===
Q-learning has been proposed in the multi-agent setting (see Section 4.1.2 in ). One approach consists in pretending the environment is passive. Littman proposes the minimax Q learning algorithm.

== Limitations ==
The standard Q-learning algorithm (using a formula_17 table) applies only to discrete action and state spaces. Discretization of these values leads to inefficient learning, largely due to the curse of dimensionality. However, there are adaptations of Q-learning that attempt to solve this problem such as Wire-fitted Neural Network Q-Learning.

<text>Marius Borg Høiby (born 13 January 1997) is a relative of the Norwegian royal family, who is accused of being a serial sex offender and charged with violence, abuse and raping several women. He is the son of Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway from her previous brief encounter with convicted felon Morten Borg before she married Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway. Høiby is not a royal himself. While his father was still in prison, he received widespread media attention as the first step-child in the history of the Norwegian royal family and was widely nicknamed &quot;Little Marius&quot; after a somewhat tragic literary character.

He is a commoner and the royal family has stated that &quot;he shall not have a public role and is not a public figure.&quot; He has falsely claimed to be a &quot;prince&quot; abroad and was presented as a member of the royal family on their website, but both claims were since removed. He has earned a reputation in Norway as entitled and spoiled, with serious behavioral and drug-related problems, and been unfavorably compared to &quot;Lillelord,&quot; an entitled literary character. Høiby has briefly worked as a salesperson and mechanic, but since been unemployed. Høiby invited criminal friends to the royal property Skaugum, to what he called &quot;Skaugum festivals&quot;, and where drugs were consumed. On 18 November 2024, Høiby was arrested on suspicion of rape and is facing trial. From 20 November 2024, Høiby was a remand prisoner at Hamar Prison. As of 21 November Høiby is accused of raping three women. 

The Høiby affair, along with scandals involving the King&#x27;s son-in-law, conspiracy theorist, convicted felon and accused sex offender Durek Verrett, have been cited as reasons for a &quot;decimation of the Norwegian royal family&#x27;s reputation,&quot; leading to increased discussion about the future of the monarchy and a doubling of membership in the Norwegian republican association. Royal commentator Satu Jaatinen said Høiby &quot;has no position, but he has abused all the things he could abuse,&quot; and that &quot;the entire royal family&#x27;s popularity has collapsed&quot; in 2024.

== Biography ==
Høiby was born on 13 January 1997 at Aker University Hospital in Oslo, to Mette-Marit Tjessem Høiby, then a waitress, and Morten Borg, a convicted felon. His grandfather Sven O. Høiby was also a convicted felon and unemployed alcoholic, who married a stripper in his second marriage. His parents were never in a relationship, and only had a brief encounter after they were introduced by John Ognby, Høiby&#x27;s former cohabitant and fiancé, who was also a convicted felon. For two years Mette-Marit was in a relationship with Ognby, a man on welfare who was 15 years her senior, until shortly before Marius&#x27; birth. They shared a social housing apartment provided by welfare services in a working-class neighborhood in Lillestrøm, until a breakup occurred after Ognby chased Mette-Marit down the street with a knife around the time she became pregnant with Marius.

At the time of Høiby&#x27;s birth, his father Morten Borg was in prison for drug-related violent crimes, and the two did not meet until Høiby moved to Oslo with his mother. Høiby had resided in a lower working class environment outside Oslo where several of her acquaintances and family members, including her child&#x27;s father, had served time in prison. After her son was born, she relocated to her childhood home of Kristiansand, where Marius Høiby was raised by his mother and her then-partner, a local disc jockey, until the couple split in early 1999. Later that same year, she met Crown Prince Haakon and in 2000 they moved to Oslo to live with him. The fact that Mette-Marit was a single mother and the circumstances surrounding this, including the background of the child&#x27;s father as a convicted felon, were considered controversial. TV 2 later wrote that &quot;Merely by existing, Marius Borg Høiby was seen by many as a scandal for the royal family.&quot; Jo Moen Bredeveien of &quot;Dagsavisen&quot; wrote that &quot;in a documentary on TV2, the king&#x27;s sister (Princess Ragnhild, Mrs. Lorentzen) comes across as almost uncomfortably prophetic. She expressed concern about how things would turn out for Marius, now that the Crown Princess was pregnant with Ingrid Alexandra, the nation&#x27;s future queen: &#x27;I feel terribly sorry for her son. When they have a child, poor Marius will be nothing. He is six years old, but he will understand that there is a difference. That will cause problems for them. I hope they have thought it through,&#x27; the princess said.&quot; Mette-Marit remains deeply unpopular in Norway, with only 27% approving of her as a future queen.
When his mother entered the public spotlight as the girlfriend of Haakon, Marius Borg Høiby was nicknamed &quot;Little Marius&quot; by the media, and the name stuck. The name was also used by Queen Sonja, who said that &quot;Little Marius is just the world&#x27;s cutest little bright guy, who is so charming and wonderful, so it&#x27;s definitely not a problem for me, at least.&quot; The nickname is famous as the name of a tragic character in the 1883 novel &quot;Poison&quot;, who – like Høiby – is illegitimate and a perceived outsider.

He graduated from high school in 2016. The following year he began to study &quot;business&quot; at Santa Monica College in California, a community college catering to non-traditional students who may not be accepted at more conventional colleges, but dropped out after a few months without completing a degree. In late 2017, Høiby moved back to Norway briefly, before briefly working as an intern for designer Philipp Plein, after which he was hired as style editor for the UK-based fashion magazine &quot;Tempus,&quot; until its closure in December 2018. Høiby moved back to Norway in 2019, residing in Tønsberg with then-partner Juliane Snekkestad. After the couple split in 2022, Høiby moved to one of the houses at Skaugum, the official residence of the Crown Prince and Princess. 

Høiby was convicted of drug possession in 2017. When arrested, he claimed his residence was the royal palace, although he lived in Asker in another municipality. As of 2024, the royal family&#x27;s website included his half-siblings Princess Ingrid Alexandra and Prince Sverre Magnus, and made no mention of Høiby being part of the household. His maternal grandfather, Sven O. Høiby, frequently spoke publicly about &quot;little Marius&quot; during his childhood, expressing that he believed his grandson should be given the title of Prince to avoid feeling second-class and becoming a target of bullying. He also claimed that he planned to write a book about his grandson. Despite the absence of any formal roles or titles, Høiby has attended several royal events as a guest, including official state visits, dinners and Constitution Day celebrations.

Høiby was pictured alongside individuals with criminal records and a controversial alt-right blogger with a history of defending rape, sparking significant public and media backlash.

== Personal life ==
In adulthood, media reports regarding Høiby became more common, earning him a reputation in Norway as entitled and spoiled due to several minor scandals and controversies surrounding him. Since 2016, Høiby has been in a series of high-profile relationships. Between 2016 and 2017, he was in a relationship with wealthy heir Linn Helena Nilsen. From 2018 to 2022, Høiby was in a relationship with model and actress Juliane Snekkestad, whom he had met while working in Los Angeles. He also briefly dated influencer Nora Haukland after his relationship with Snekkestad ended, before the couple split in 2023.

== Høiby affair ==
He has been charged with domestic violence. As of early January 2025, the police are nearing the end of their investigations. Authorities said that they did not know when the case possibly could go to the court system.

Four women and one man have been victimized, according to the charges (as of 19 November 2024):
*The &quot;woman in Frogner&quot; [or the woman that was living in the Frogner neighbourhood of Oslo]. Two instances of violence against her were reported, according to the charges. She is a former girlfriend of Høiby, and his last one, according to the media in September 2024. On 13 September 2024, police arrested Høiby. He was released the next day. The arrest was in regard to allegedly contacting her by phone, in violation of a restraining order. Høiby has not admitted culpability [to the justice system]. Earlier in 2024, Høiby was arrested for violence against her, according to the charges. A blood test was taken (while arrested); the test results were consistent with those of someone that had recently been using &quot;cocain, ecstasy and cannabis&quot;. The following day, recordings via telephone were released by the media, in which Høiby can be heard making multiple references to slapping/striking her previously. On 23 August he was charged with making threats against her.
*Violence against a named woman at a date that has not been made public. She was once a girlfriend of Høiby.
*Violence against another named woman, within about a four-year period. The charges say that he pulled her hair, pushed her, and hit her. She was once a girlfriend of Høiby.
*Sexual assault (or rape) of a woman that was unable to resist. There was no intercourse, according to the police. The court closed its doors to journalists, when the court system decided that Høiby can be detained by police until 27 November. The alleged victim has not pressed charges. Earlier, Høiby was arrested on 18 November. Earlier (8 November), investigation started after police found video clips on Høiby&#x27;s mobile phone. The incident allegedly happened on Palm Sunday, in an apartment where the alleged victim was registered as living; she does not know the other alleged victims. He did not know her previously, according to the media. He has not admitted culpability. The woman is in her 20s.
*Another charge of rape is in regard to a woman in her 20s. There was no intercourse, according to the police. She was allegedly raped on 26 September, at Skaugum.

*In addition, one person has allegedly received a death threat from Høiby, according to the police. Høiby is charged with having messaged him (through Instagram) and written that the person is a &quot;fucking dead man&quot; (&quot;fuckings død mann&quot;).

The authorities notified the Royal Court that Høiby would possibly be arrested. The Royal Court notified the Crown Prince and the Crown Princess. She in turn notified her son, and a half hour later she drove him from Skaugum to an adjacent property, to the appointment with the police. The media claims (as of November 2024) that Høiby and his family has received preferential treatment from police. Mette-Marit has been accused of warning her son about his impending arrest and of evidence tampering and witness tampering.

Earlier on 25 September, the chief editor of &quot;Se og Hør&quot; said that Høiby should be forced to move from the royal residence at Skaugum. The media have raised the question of whether the Crown Prince or Crown Princess finance Høiby&#x27;s drug habit. The media claimed that police interrogation of Høiby revealed that the crown prince &quot;together with the crown princess&quot; took care of his bills. Høiby gets 20,000 kroner each month. The media have also raised questions over the financing of the rest of his lifestyle.

Other reactions to the alleged crimes of 2024, include - after the first arrest - royal commentator Johan T. Lindwall describing Høiby&#x27;s behavior as a &quot;catastrophe&quot; for the monarchy. Royal commentator Sebastian Mattsson said Marius Høiby is viewed as the black sheep among the extended family of the royals due to his many scandals and controversies, but highlighting the 2024 charges as a new low. Newspaper editor Trygve Hegnar described Høiby as &quot;the psycho who brings down the royal family.&quot; 

Ten days after his arrest in August, Høiby released a statement admitting to his crimes and apologizing to the victim, adding that the incidents had taken place in a &quot;haze of alcohol and cocaine&quot; and stating that he has &quot;several mental disorders.&quot; 

On 19 November, it was announced that Høiby was also charged with one count of &quot;abuse in close relationships,&quot; violating a restraining order, and driving without a valid driver&#x27;s license.

On 18 November 2024, Høiby was arrested on suspicion of rape. Since 20 November 2024, he has been held in remand at Hamar Prison, and he is held incommunicado. The justice system has autorised that the police can keep him no longer than until 27 November 2024; at that time his one-week detention expired; the prosecutor had asked for two weeks. He was promptly released on that date.

On 25 November, it became known that Høiby is under investigating for raping another woman, after having been released following his initial arrest and questioning by the police.

Høiby invited criminal friends to the royal property Skaugum, including members of the Hells Angels criminal gang, to what he called &quot;Skaugum festivals&quot;, where drugs were consumed. At these festivals Mette-Marit personally received Marius&#x27; criminal friends. Høiby is also charged with raping women at Skaugum. Jan Bøhler wrote that &quot;a member of the royal family has for years vacationed and partied with central figures in drug-related crime. Individuals known for involvement in serious money laundering cases and violent gangs, including the Hells Angels, have also participated in the festivities. These enemies of society have been allowed to roam freely on the Crown Prince couple&#x27;s properties during events referred to as &#x27;Skaugum festivals&#x27;.&quot;

As of December 2024, Høiby had started in a program of drug rehabilitation.

==Other controversies==
Høiby has been at the center of several scandals and controversies after becoming an adult. 

As an adult, he made headlines in 2016 after posting several luxury items for sale on a Norwegian online trade site using the royal residence as address, which led to criticism of Høiby misusing his proximity to the royal family for monetary gain, something his maternal grandfather had also been criticized for previously. In 2018, Høiby was referred to as a &quot;Prince of Norway&quot; in &quot;Tempus Magazine,&quot; where he briefly worked as an editor, which again led to criticism from several Norwegian media outlets, until the references were removed from print and the magazine&#x27;s website. During 2023 and 2024, several outlets reported Høiby posting videos and images to social media showing him speeding and recklessly driving, engaging in heavy partying and other offences, with &quot;Dagbladet&quot; describing his circuit of friends being one of &quot;wealthy heirs, reality stars and influencers, mixed in with seasoned criminals and drug offenders&quot;. This led to many experts criticizing Høiby as a security risk given his proximity to the royal family and residence near them. Several outlets also criticized Høiby&#x27;s repeated misuse of a false princely title, leading some outlets to refer to him as &quot;the pseudo prince&quot;.

In 2024, the media said that he had abused a diplomatic passport, a type of passport meant to be used by individuals on official missions representing Norway, even though he is not a diplomat and does not hold any public role. The media reported that he had &quot;abused&quot; the passport multiple times, including to evade the police abroad, even while under the influence of drugs.

Høiby was convicted of drug possession in 2017.

<doc id="1281860" wikidata="Q706701" url="?curid=1281860" title="Michael Melchior">
<text>Michael Melchior (; born January 31, 1954) is a Jewish leader, Orthodox rabbi, thinker, and activist. He is a former Minister of Social and Diaspora Affairs, a former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and a former member of Knesset for Meimad. He is the Rabbi of a community in Talpiyot, Jerusalem (Beit Boyar), while still holding the title of the Chief Rabbi of Norway.

==Biography==
A descendant of seven generations of rabbis in Denmark, Melchior was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1954. His grandfather, Marcus Melchior, helped orchestrate the escape of Danish Jews during the Nazi occupation of Denmark, and served as the country&#x27;s chief rabbi until his death in 1969. Michael was ordained as an Orthodox Rabbi at Yeshivat Hakotel of Jerusalem in 1980. Soon afterwards, he returned to Scandinavia to serve as Chief Rabbi of Norway.

In 1986, he immigrated to Israel, and settled down with his family in Jerusalem, while still holding the honorary title of Chief Rabbi of Norway.

==Political career==
Melchior entered politics with the Meimad party in 1995. When Rabbi Yehuda Amital was appointed minister without portfolio after the assassination of prime minister Yitzhak Rabin in November 1995, Melchior served as Amital&#x27;s assistant. Melchior was selected chairman of the managing committee of the Meimad party in late 1995.

In the 1999 elections, Meimad ran as part of the One Israel alliance with the Labor Party and Gesher. Melchior won a seat, and was appointed Minister of Social and Diaspora Affairs on 5 August 1999, a post he held until Ariel Sharon became Prime Minister in 2001. Melchior was re-elected to the Knesset as a member of the joint list in 2003 and 2006, as Meimad continued its alliance with the Labor Party. In 2008, Meimad broke away from the alliance, and ran in partnership with the Green Movement in the 2009 elections, but failed to win a seat. On December 14, 2012, on his Facebook page, he said that he will quit Knesset elections.

==Extra-parliamentary political and social activities==
As part of his official roles in the Knesset and the Israeli government, Melchior was involved with Birthright Israel, an organization that has brought over 200,000 young Jews to explore their heritage in Israel.

In addition, Rabbi Melchior established a number of civil organizations that focus on issues he dealt with in his parliamentary activities, concerning education, inter-Jewish relations, the environment, economics, and Arab-Israeli peace.

He founded The Yachad Council, which promoted dialogue between religious and secular Jews, and he served as honorary chairman of the Citizens&#x27; Accord Forum Between Jews and Arabs in Israel. CAF conducted activities that promoted civic engagement, encouraged active citizenship, and inspired members of the public to play an active role in formulating policies that affect their daily lives and their future. CAF worked to create dialogue and civic action groups of Jews and Arabs across the country, in cooperation with civic and community organizations, including groups of ultra-Orthodox and Arab participants, among them a group of ultra-Orthodox Jewish women and religious Arab women, with the aim of building a shared society in a sustainable democracy in Israel.

While serving in the Knesset, Rabbi Melchior became concerned about the growing polarization between the different Jewish sectors in Israel. One contributing factor was the division of students in different educational streams: religious, secular, ultra-Orthodox, and Arab. These divides in the schools strengthened polarization between the Jewish sectors and reinforced a lack of common narrative, values, and vision for the future of the state. As a response, in 2001, Melchior established Meitarim - a network of pluralistic Jewish schools in Israel where religious and secular students can grow up and learn together in kindergartens, schools, pre- and post-military institutions in a non-coercive approach, enabling multiple interpretations and expressions of Jewish heritage to take responsibility for tolerance and the establishment of a collective narrative. Since 2001, Meitarim has disseminated its experimental infrastructure and curricula to over 15,000 students and instructors in collaboration with 120 educational institutions.

In 2002, Melchior initiated, together with his Palestinian counterpart Sheikh Talal Sider, an inter-religious summit in Alexandria, Egypt, co-sponsored by the Mufti of Egypt, Grand Imam of al-Azhar Mosque, and Grand Sheikh of al-Azhar University, Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi; Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey; and Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron, Israel&#x27;s Chief Rabbi. The summit, which launched The Alexandria Process, brought together religious leaders from the Middle-East to adopt common principles aimed at preventing the region&#x27;s religious sensibilities from being exploited during conflicts, and declaring the need to work together towards peaceful solutions of the conflicts. Together with Elie Wiesel, Melchior established the Mosaica Center for Interreligious Cooperation – MERPI (Middle East Religious Peace Initiative) to &quot;lead to the implementation&quot; of the principles of the Alexandria Declaration and continues to serve as chair of both of Mosaica&#x27;s branches. Melchior is also a member of the Elijah Interfaith Institute Board of World Religious Leaders.

Mosaica&#x27;s second branch is The Center for Conflict Resolution by Agreement which Rabbi Melchior also serves as Chairman. The center serves as a professional address for establishing understandings and agreements between individuals, organizations, groups, and communities. The center believes in every person&#x27;s abilities to resolve conflicts and to operate in cooperation with the aid of tools from the realm of mediation. Mosaica supports the activities of 44 mediation and dialogue centers across the country with the aim of making the activities accessible to an array of communities in Israel. Thus, individuals, groups, and communities can contribute to a cohesive and respectful Israeli society.

More controversially, in September 2012, Melchior claimed that extremist Islamic leaders, including the leaders of Hamas, are ready for peaceful co-existence with Israel, and he added that he has &quot;yet to meet with somebody who is not willing to make peace&quot; with the Jewish state of Israel, placing the onus for lack of peace with extremist Islamic movements on Israel.

An additional initiative of Rabbi Melchior was Kulanu. Kulanu sought to strengthen the Jewish character of the State of Israel, enhance democracy, and foster unity through its diverse projects. Kulanu was best known for its Chagim BaKehilla (literally: holidays in the community) program, which provided religious services for secular Jews for many of the Jewish holidays. Kulanu worked with Teva Ivri to launch the Shmita Yisraelit program. Other Kulanu programs included Yom Kippur Shel Kulanu; B&#x27;Yachad: For a Shared Jewish Democratic Society; Meitarim: Inclusive Jewish Educational Network; and Shmita Yisraeli (in coordination with Teva Ivri).

In 2010, Melchior involved himself in economic issues. He co-founded the Israel Civic Action Forum which promotes higher taxation on income from the extraction of natural resources, and the use of the tax income for higher government spending to increase government spending on welfare, education, and health.

In 2014, he, along with Hadassah Froman of Tekoa and Rav Yoel Bin-Nun of Alon Shevut, participated at the Gush Etzion mourning where a kidnapping of three yeshiva students took place on June 12, 2014, who were found dead on June 30, 2014, and are believed to have been killed shortly after being kidnapped.

<doc id="1281863" wikidata="Q426498" url="?curid=1281863" title="Tantalum carbide">
<text>Tantalum carbides (TaC) form a family of binary chemical compounds of tantalum and carbon with the empirical formula , where &quot;x&quot; usually varies between 0.4 and 1. They are extremely hard, brittle, refractory ceramic materials with metallic electrical conductivity. They appear as brown-gray powders, which are usually processed by sintering.

Being important cermet materials, tantalum carbides are commercially used in tool bits for cutting applications and are sometimes added to tungsten carbide alloys.

The melting points of tantalum carbides was previously estimated to be about depending on the purity and measurement conditions; this value is among the highest for binary compounds. And only tantalum hafnium carbide was estimated to have a higher melting point of . However new tests have conclusively proven that TaC actually has a melting point of 3,768 °C and both tantalum hafnium carbide and hafnium carbide have higher melting points.

==Preparation==
 powders of desired composition are prepared by heating a mixture of tantalum and graphite powders in vacuum or inert-gas atmosphere (argon). The heating is performed at a temperature of about using a furnace or an arc-melting setup. An alternative technique is reduction of tantalum pentoxide by carbon in vacuum or hydrogen atmosphere at a temperature of . This method was used to obtain tantalum carbide in 1876, but it lacks control over the stoichiometry of the product. Production of TaC directly from the elements has been reported through self-propagating high-temperature synthesis.

==Crystal structure==

 compounds have a cubic (rock-salt) crystal structure for &quot;x&quot; = 0.7–1.0; the lattice parameter increases with &quot;x&quot;. has two major crystalline forms. The more stable one has an anti-cadmium iodide-type trigonal structure, which transforms upon heating to about 2,000 °C into a hexagonal lattice with no long-range order for the carbon atoms.

Here &quot;Z&quot; is the number of formula units per unit cell, &quot;ρ&quot; is the density calculated from lattice parameters.

==Properties==
The bonding between tantalum and carbon atoms in tantalum carbides is a complex mixture of ionic, metallic and covalent contributions, and because of the strong covalent component, these carbides are very hard and brittle materials. For example, TaC has a microhardness of 1,600–2,000 kg/mm2 (~9 Mohs) and an elastic modulus of 285 GPa, whereas the corresponding values for tantalum are 110 kg/mm2 and 186 GPa.

Tantalum carbides have metallic electrical conductivity, both in terms of its magnitude and temperature dependence. TaC is a superconductor with a relatively high transition temperature of &quot;T&quot;C = 10.35 K.

The magnetic properties of change from diamagnetic for &quot;x&quot; ≤ 0.9 to paramagnetic at larger &quot;x&quot;. An inverse behavior (para-diamagnetic transition with increasing &quot;x&quot;) is observed for , despite that it has the same crystal structure as .

==Application==
Tantalum carbide is widely used as sintering additive in ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs) or as a ceramic reinforcement in high-entropy alloys (HEAs) due to its excellent physical properties in melting point, hardness, elastic modulus, thermal conductivity, thermal shock resistance, and chemical stability, which makes it a desirable material for aircraft and rockets in aerospace industries.

Wang et al. have synthesized SiBCN ceramic matrix with TaC addition by mechanical alloying plus reactive hot-pressing sintering methods, in which BN, graphite and TaC powders were mixed with ball-milling and sintered at to obtain SiBCN-TaC composites. For the synthesis, the ball-milling process refined the TaC powders down to 5 nm without reacting with other components, allowing to form agglomerates that are composed of spherical clusters with a diameter of 100 nm-200 nm. TEM analysis showed that TaC is distributed either randomly in the form of nanoparticles with sizes of 10-20 nm within the matrix or distributed in BN with smaller size of 3-5 nm. As a result, the composite with 10 wt% addition of TaC improved the fracture toughness of the matrix, reaching 399.5 MPa compared to 127.9 MPa of pristine SiBCN ceramics. This is mainly due to the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients between TaC and SiBCN ceramic matrix. Since TaC has a larger coefficient of thermal expansion than that of SiBCN matrix, TaC particles endures tensile stress while the matrix endures tensile stress in radial direction and compressive stress in tangential direction. This makes the cracks to bypass the particles and absorbs some energy to achieve toughening. In addition, the uniform distribution of TaC particles contributes to the yield stress explained by Hall-Petch relationship due to a decrease in grain size.

Wei et al. have synthesized novel refractory MoNbRe0.5W(TaC)x HEA matrix using vacuum arc melting. XRD patterns showed that the resulting material is mainly composed of a single BCC crystal structure in the base alloy MoNbRe0.5W and a multi-component (MC) type carbide of (Nb, Ta, Mo, W)C to form a lamellar eutectic structure, with the amount of MC phase proportional to TaC addition. TEM analysis showed that the lamellar interface between BCC and MC phase presents a smooth and curvy morphology which exhibits good bonding with no lattice misfit dislocations. As a result, the grain size decreases with increasing TaC addition which improves the yield stress explained by Hall-Petch relationship. The formation of lamellar structure is because at elevated temperature, the decomposition reaction occurs in the MoNbRe0.5W(TaC)x composites:
in which Re is dissolved in both components to nucleate BCC phase first and MC phase in the following, according to the phase diagrams. In addition, the MC phase also improves the strength of composites, due to its stiffer and more elastic property compared to BCC phase.

Wu et al. have also synthesized Ti(C, N)-based cermets with TaC addition with ball-milling and sintering at . TEM analysis showed that TaC helps dissolution of carbonitride phase and converts to TaC-binder phase. The resulting is a formation of “black-core-white rim” structure with decreasing grain size in the region of 3-5 wt% TaC addition and increasing transverse rupture strength (TRS). 0-3 wt% TaC region showed a decrease in the TRS because the TaC addition decreases the wettability between binder and carbonitride phase and creates pores. Further addition of TaC beyond 5 wt% also decreases TRS because TaC agglomerates during sintering and porosity again forms. The best TRS is found at 5wt% addition where fine grains and homogeneous microstructure are achieved for less grain boundary sliding.

==Natural occurrence==
Tantalcarbide is a natural form of tantalum carbide. It is a cubic, extremely rare mineral.

<doc id="1281864" wikidata="Q5210747" url="?curid=1281864" title="Dalek variants">
<text>Since their first appearance in 1963 there have been a number of variant models of the [[Dalek]]s, a fictional alien race in the BBC science fiction television programme &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

First seen in the serial &quot;The Daleks&quot; (1963–64), the outward manifestation is portrayed as a powerful, technically advanced travel machine in which a hideous and malevolent mutant, the Dalek creature, resides. Although the general appearance of the Daleks has remained the same, details of both the casing and the mutant creature have changed over time. Alterations were made to accommodate the requirements of specific plot elements in various serials and episodes or at the request of producers, designers and directors to revitalise the Dalek appearance. On other occasions design changes have been the result of practical considerations when filming the Dalek props on location, or the mixing of components acquired from different sources.

The episodes &quot;Asylum of the Daleks&quot; (2012), &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (2015) and &quot;The Witch&#x27;s Familiar&quot; (2015) feature appearances by many of the Dalek variants seen in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; programme since its inception.
==Glossary of primary Dalek components==
The component names listed below are used in this article as an aid to tracking the detail changes made to the basic Dalek design to create variants. From the base up, the major components are:
* fender: The projecting base of the Dalek prop. 
* skirt: The section with angled faces, to which the hemispheres are attached.
* hemispheres: Also known as &quot;hemis&quot; and &quot;sense globes&quot;, fifty-six of these items (forty-eight on New Paradigm Daleks) are fixed in four rows to the skirt panels.
* shoulders: The section between the top of the skirt and the neck bin.
* collars: Two horizontal bands fitted around the shoulders.
* slats: Vertical rectangular panels fitted around the upper collar.
* shoulder mesh: Diamond-section mesh fitted between the slats and the upper collar.
* appendage boxes: Projecting boxes housing the ball joints for the arm and gun stick.
* gun stick: Usually portrayed as a variable discharge energy weapon.
* gun rods: Longitudinal rods forming a cage around the gun stick.
* gun mantles: Octagonal cross-members bracing the gun rods along their length.
* arm: A telescopic arm, having two or three sections.
* plunger: Fixed to the end of the arm and depicted as a Dalek&#x27;s primary manipulating appendage.
* neck bin: The section between the shoulders and the dome.
* neck bin mesh: Mesh fitted between the neck bin and the neck rings.
* neck rings: Horizontal rings fitted around the neck bin.
* neck struts: Eight thin, vertical struts on the exterior of the neck bin, between the top of the shoulders and the dome.
* dome: The rotatable top component of the travel machine.
* dome lights: Lights fixed to the dome, which flash when the Dalek is shown speaking.
* eye stalk: A rod projecting from the dome, which can pivot vertically.
* eye discs: A series of discs of varying diameter through which the eye stalk is threaded.
* eyeball: A spherical component fitted to the end of the eye stalk, shown in various episodes to contain the Dalek&#x27;s visual apparatus.
* eye lens: A circular lens at the front of the eyeball which, depending on the variant, is sometimes illuminated or has a central pupil.
* dome cowl: A structure which projects from the front of the dome and surrounds the eye stalk pivot. (&quot;New Series&quot; Daleks only)

==General design==
===Overview===
Externally Daleks have the appearance of a truncated cone varying between approximately 1.5 metres (5 feet) and 2 metres (6 feet 6 inches) tall depending upon the variant. They are equipped with a single mechanical rod-mounted eye which protrudes from a rotating dome, a directed energy weapon and a telescopic arm. Usually the arm is fitted with a manipulating device resembling a sink plunger. This item is shown in various episodes to be capable of holding people and objects, seemingly using a powerful vacuum. The weapon is depicted as having a variable output which can paralyse, stun or kill most life forms, disintegrate other Daleks and destroy buildings and spacecraft.

===Casing===
In &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; (1988) and the episodes &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot; (2005) and &quot;Doomsday&quot; (2006) the Doctor states that Dalek casings are constructed from &quot;bonded polycarbide&quot;, with this material being referred to as &quot;dalekanium&quot; in &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot; (1964) and &quot;Daleks in Manhattan&quot; (2007). The casing is depicted as being impervious to most projectile and energy weapons, although not indestructible. In various episodes Daleks are shown being damaged or destroyed by overwhelming firepower, their own weaponry and falls from a height. In addition, in &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot; (1985), they are said to be vulnerable to &quot;bastic-headed bullets&quot;. In appearances from 2005 onwards a Dalek&#x27;s defensive capability has been shown to include an invisible force shield, with the eye remaining a weak point.

The lower shell is covered with hemispherical protrusions. In the BBC-licensed &quot;The Dalek Book&quot; (1964), and again in &quot;The Doctor Who Technical Manual&quot; (1983), these items are described as being part of a sensory array. In &quot;Dalek&quot; (2005) they are shown to act as components in a self-destruct mechanism.

===Eye===
Historically, a Dalek&#x27;s eye has been depicted as its most vulnerable spot. In &quot;Silence in the Library&quot; (2008) the Doctor, speaking of how to deal with various alien menaces, says &quot;Daleks: aim for the eye stalk&quot;. In the revived series from 2005 onwards, storylines have shown Daleks as having systems to protect their vision. In the 2008 episode &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot;, Wilfred Mott attempts to disable a Dalek by blinding it using a paintball gun. The Dalek is seen to simply evaporate the paint from its eye.

===Eye lens, eye discs and dome lights===
While maintaining their general shape and appearance, the design of these components has varied over the years. Eye lenses were first shown as blank, white discs, sometimes featuring internal illumination. Later, lenses with a black &quot;pupil&quot; were introduced. &quot;New Series&quot; Daleks have a clear lens which glows with a blue light while New Paradigm Daleks, introduced in the episode &quot;Victory of the Daleks&quot; (2010), are equipped with an &quot;organic eyeball&quot; set behind a small transparent hemisphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;DWC 5/3&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1960s Daleks were occasionally shown with a functioning iris, a feature also seen in the &quot;New Series&quot; Dalek design. The eye discs have varied in number, size, spacing, profile and configuration. Colour has generally been restricted to powder blue, white or gold, with &quot;New Series&quot; Dalek eye discs having a translucent, frosted appearance and those of the New Paradigm variant being black.

The dome-light covers first resembled table tennis balls, before items having the appearance of plastic egg cup inserts were substituted. Later these were replaced by various types of &quot;bee skep-shaped&quot; vehicle side light lenses. The flattened lights fitted to the Imperial Daleks seen in &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; were formed from Perspex discs capped by commercially available saucer-shaped plastic components, while &quot;New Series&quot; and New Paradigm Daleks have light-covers consisting of tubular beacon lenses, the former variant&#x27;s being surrounded by a metallic cage.

===Underside===
The underside structure of a Dalek casing was indeterminate until the publication of &quot;The Dalek Book &quot; (1964). This included a cutaway drawing entitled &quot;Anatomy of a Dalek&quot; which showed it to have a base through which a large central sphere, surrounded by smaller satellite &quot;balancing globes&quot;, protrudes. This layout was generally adopted and used in subsequent Dalek plans and comic strip representations. This is at variance with the few glimpses seen in early &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television episodes and films, which made little attempt to show (or hide) anything other than the actual base of the Dalek prop. As this usually took the form of a plywood board to which castors had been attached and a hole cut out for the operator&#x27;s feet, these brief appearances were of little assistance in maintaining the illusion of the props being functional, armoured casings housing an alien being. This situation was finally remedied in the episode &quot;Dalek&quot; (2005) and subsequent appearances of the &quot;New Series&quot; Dalek. This variant is shown to have an underside consisting of a large, recessed central hemisphere surrounded by eight satellite hemispheres. The central hemisphere and four of the satellite hemispheres glow when the Dalek is in flight mode.

===Dalek Mutant===

The creatures inside the &quot;travel machines&quot; are depicted as repulsive in appearance and vicious even without their mechanical armour. Rarely glimpsed until the programme&#x27;s revival in 2005, they were usually shown as amorphous green blobs with strong tentacles capable of strangulation or, occasionally, as having clawed hands. Their appearance and evolution is variously attributed to radioactive fallout from a catastrophic war, artificially accelerating pre-existing genetic mutations in the Kaled species and the manipulation of genetic material forcibly obtained from other (usually human) species. From 2005 onward the Dalek creature has been seen more frequently, in its latest incarnation resembling a pale octopus-like being with a single viable eye, a vestigial nose and mouth, and an exposed brain.

In the episode &quot;The Witch&#x27;s Familiar&quot; (2015) it is revealed that the mutants are biologically immortal, yet still gradually age to eventually rot away into a liquid mass. These decayed Daleks are ultimately deposited in Skaro&#x27;s sewer system, where they decompose further into a living, maddened sludge.

===Voice===
Daleks have distinctive electronic voices, the harsh, staccato sound being created by actors speaking through a microphone into a device called a ring modulator. While this produces considerable distortion and a monotone effect, inflection and pace are used to express a range of emotions including rage, triumph, disdain and, very occasionally, fear. (  )

===Locomotion and manoeuvrability===
Dalek locomotion is usually shown as a gliding movement a few centimetres above the ground. &quot;The Dalek Book&quot; (1964) indicates that traction is provided by a large, omnidirectional rotating metal sphere, while in the serial &quot;Death to the Daleks&quot; (1974) the Doctor states that they move by psycho-kinetic power. For years Daleks were depicted as being unable to climb stairs, with travel confined to smooth ground and level surfaces. This was rectified in &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot; in which a hovering Dalek was seen briefly, and then in &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; which featured a Dalek levitating up a staircase. From 2005 various &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes have shown Daleks hovering and flying with ease, locomotion being imparted by anti-gravity generators.

==Dalek variant naming conventions==
During the course of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television programme the BBC, its producers and scriptwriters have rarely alluded to changes in Dalek design or ascribed names or designations to the various models seen. Notable exceptions usually refer to rank, such as &quot;Emperor&quot; and &quot;Supreme Dalek&quot;, although in &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; the newly created Dalek casing is referred to as a &quot;Mark 3 Travel Machine&quot;.

The Dalek variant naming conventions used in this article are attributed to the various models as a matter of convenience. They can be found in general use by the Doctor Who/Dalek fan base, and are often quoted in posts and documentation on websites such as The Project Dalek Forum. Other classifications for the major Dalek variants exist. &quot;The Doctor Who Technical Manual&quot; (1983) places both television and Movie Daleks in the same numerical sequence by order of their first screen appearances, although reconciling the characters and events depicted in the Doctor Who films with those established in the TV programme is problematic.

The term &quot;drone&quot; is used in this article to indicate a Dalek having no rank. Its only use to date in the Doctor Who television serials and films in which the Daleks have appeared has been in the episodes &quot;Victory of the Daleks&quot; and &quot;Revolution of the Daleks&quot;.

==Mark 1 Daleks==
The Daleks first appeared in the 1963 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Daleks&quot;. There are no visual cues to distinguish one Dalek from another, or suggestions in the story of a hierarchy.

The Mark 1 Dalek differs from later variants in having no shoulder slats or mesh, nine eye discs (the greatest number of any version) and a &quot;toffee apple&quot; shaped eyeball. The eye lenses are illuminated and shown to have an iris which can expand and contract. These Daleks have a silver colour scheme with blue/grey shoulders, blue hemispheres and eye discs, collars in natural aluminium and black fenders. The story refers to them being powered by static electricity, with mobility limited to the metal floors in the Dalek City on their home planet, Skaro.

In the episode &quot;The Ambush&quot; a Dalek is shown using a device resembling a thermal lance to cut through a door. It consists of a long, slim tube flanked by two globes, surmounted by a clear disc-shaped &quot;sight screen&quot;. This appendage is mounted to the Dalek&#x27;s arm in place of a plunger.

The Dalek concept was the creation of screenwriter Terry Nation, with the design being realised by BBC staff designer Raymond Cusick. The props were constructed by Shawcraft Engineering of Uxbridge, England under the direction of Bill Roberts, who also provided additional design input.

==Mark 2 Daleks==
The storyline for the second serial to feature the Daleks, &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot; (1964), required the props to be used extensively on location. Consequently, serial designer Spencer Chapman and manufacturer Shawcraft Engineering devised a tricycle arrangement, incorporating three pneumatic tyres, to replace the original castors and carry the props over uneven ground. Enlarged fenders were then created to hide the revised undercarriage.

To explain the Daleks&#x27; ability to travel away from the static-charged floors of their city, the narrative has the Doctor stating that an aerial located at the edge of a mine in Bedfordshire is the key to the Daleks&#x27; power supply on Earth. Although not referred to directly in the story, it is implied that the parabolic dishes now fitted to the rear shoulder section of each prop act as receptors for a form of transmitted energy. Other design changes are a reduction in the number of eye discs to five and painting some eyeballs silver instead of the standard black colour. An amphibious capability is demonstrated in the closing moments of the first episode of the serial when a Dalek emerges from beneath the waters of the River Thames.

For the first time a Dalek command structure is introduced, with rank indicated by differing colour schemes. The Earth Task Force Commander, or &quot;Saucer Commander&quot;, features a black dome and alternating light and dark skirt panels. A Supreme Controller or &quot;Black Dalek&quot; is also seen with a black dome, shoulders and skirt.

==Mark 3 Daleks==
First introduced in 1965, the basic design of the Mark 3 Dalek variant remained relatively unchanged throughout their later appearances.

===Mark 3 Daleks in the 1960s===
The Mark 3 Dalek variant first appeared in &quot;The Chase&quot; (1965), with Ray Cusick returning as designer for the serial. As the production required no location filming and Cusick felt that Daleks should be shorter than an average person, he had the enlarged fenders and wheels, installed for &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot;, removed and replaced with the original style of running gear. Greater flexibility in the storylines was afforded by freeing the Daleks from reliance on static-charged metal floors for power and mobility. For this and further serials, however, the contrivance of dish aerials as energy receptors was dispensed with. They were replaced by a steel mesh wrapped around the upper collar of each prop, over which were mounted twenty-three vertical, oblong slats ostensibly forming a power collection array (although this function has never been confirmed on screen).

A Black Dalek with grey shoulders is introduced in the first episode of &quot;The Chase&quot;; &quot;The Executioners&quot;, and makes subsequent appearances in a number of serials thereafter. Daleks with non-standard arm appendages are also seen in this serial. A gimballed hemisphere referred to as both a &quot;seismic detector&quot; and a &quot;TARDIS perceptor&quot; appears, and in the episode &quot;The Planet of Decision&quot; an &quot;electrode unit&quot; is employed to disable an electronic lock. The prop consisted of a large revolving parabolic dish from the centre of which two converging rods protruded.

In the later 1960s serials in which they appeared the Dalek design remained virtually unchanged, with only minor variations to the standard colour scheme and appendages.

In &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot; (1965) several Daleks are shown clearing areas of jungle using short, tubular flame throwers, referred to as &quot;pyro-flame burners&quot;, in place of the standard plunger.

A Dalek with a circular sieve-like scoop attachment in place of its plunger is seen in &quot;The Power of the Daleks&quot; (1966). It is used for transferring embryonic Dalek mutants from a liquid-filled nurturing tank to their travel machine casings. For this serial and future appearance of the Mark 3 variant, the gun design was simplified by removing the mantles.

In &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot; (1967) two more elements of the Dalek hierarchy appear; the Dalek Emperor and Daleks with black domes which appear to act as the Emperor&#x27;s personal guard. (This motif appears again in &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot; (2005), with black-domed Daleks fulfilling a similar function.) For the first time a Dalek is seen with a black pupil centred in its eye lens.

An unusual version of the Mark 3 Dalek made an appearance in &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot;. It featured narrow skirt and shoulder sections, with the rear skirt panel having only a single vertical line of hemispheres down the middle. These differences are not alluded to in the story. This prop is sometimes referred to as &quot;The Wilkie Dalek&quot; after Bernard Wilkie, the BBC technical designer who became primarily responsible for the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; programme&#x27;s visual effects after Shawcraft&#x27;s involvement ceased during 1967.

===Mark 3 Daleks in the 1970s===
The Daleks returned in the 1972 serial &quot;Day of the Daleks&quot;, their first appearance in colour on the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television programme. &quot;Drone&quot; Daleks were now finished in grey, with black hemispheres and fender. Except for &quot;Death to the Daleks&quot; (1974), and albeit with variations in the shade of grey and occasional adornment with black slats, black collars or both, this stayed as the standard Dalek colour scheme for the remaining eight serials in which they appeared over the next sixteen years. During this period, however, several small changes to the standard Mark 3 Dalek design were made and their hierarchy was again expanded.

In &quot;Day of the Daleks&quot; a Dalek Leader is seen painted in gold, with black hemispheres and fender. This serial also saw the first appearance of an oval disc between the appendage boxes and a higher fender on all models. The eye lens &quot;pupil&quot;, first seen in &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot;, now became a standard fitting. A gold Dalek Leader returned again in &quot;Frontier in Space&quot; (1973).

Seven additional Dalek props were produced for &quot;Planet of the Daleks&quot; (1973), created by special effects professional Clifford Culley&#x27;s company Westbury Design &amp; Optical Limited. The production crew referred to these props as &quot;goons&quot;. Although fabricated using measurements and moulds taken from an existing prop, the &quot;goon&quot; Daleks exhibited minor differences from the original Shawcraft builds including the substitution of single dowel neck struts for the trefoil cross section items which were the norm up to this point. The story again called for a Dalek to cut through a metal door, on this occasion the cutting device replacing the plunger resembling the tip of a large soldering iron. This serial also featured a unique variant; the Dalek Supreme.

In &quot;Death to the Daleks&quot; the travel machines display a silver livery with black shoulders, hemispheres and fender, with a task force leader being differentiated from its subordinates by amber, instead of clear, dome lights. During the serial, due to a plot element, the standard blasters are replaced by projectile weapons featuring a drilled barrel with six small fins at the muzzle. After killing two primitive humanoids with these devices a Dalek declares them to be &quot;...moderately efficient&quot;. The phasing-out of three section telescopic arms commenced in this serial, with two sections becoming the norm for the remainder of the classic series.

In &quot;Destiny of the Daleks&quot; (1979) a revised dome rotation mechanism was installed in many of the props resulting in a pin, resembling a small stub aerial, projecting from the dome top. Six crude, hollow, vacuum-formed Dalek props were also created. They were primarily used during location filming of the serial&#x27;s finale, although several of them can also be seen in the background of some studio shots. They can be recognised by their thick neck struts and the absence of dome aerials and appendage ball joints. Production photographs taken at the time reveal that they also lacked hemispheres on the rear skirt panels.

A group of Daleks are seen in this story forming a suicide squad to destroy an enemy spacecraft, each with a number of bombs attached to its shoulder section. The bomb props consist of yellow cylinders capped at the ends by red hemispheres.

A Mark 3 drone Dalek with a distinctive design also appears in &quot;Destiny of the Daleks&quot;. It features a combination of &quot;goon&quot; and Shawcraft Dalek sections for the upper half, and a unique skirt with a rear section which flares out from the shoulders at almost the same angle as the front. Four prominent bolt heads frame the chest oval and large hemispheres are fitted. These differences are not alluded to in the story and the origin of the components remains uncertain. This variant is sometimes referred to as &quot;The Tussauds Dalek&quot; after Madame Tussauds wax museum in London, where it was exhibited (painted bright blue and silver) as part of their Doctor Who display in the 1980s.

===Mark 3 Daleks in the 1980s===
Commencing with a cameo appearance in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; (1983), Mark 3 Dalek variants seen during this decade feature a neck bin raised so that a strip of it is visible between the lower neck ring and the top of the shoulders. The use of the dome rotation mechanism pin continued, appearing for the last time in &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot; (1984).

The eyestalks and discs of standard Daleks in &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot; are painted white, with four discs arranged in a conical layout, smallest disc to the front. The Tussauds Dalek prop appears in this serial under two guises; a grey drone and a Supreme Dalek painted in gloss black with white hemispheres. The Tussauds Dalek features briefly once more in &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot;, again portraying a drone.

==Dalek Emperor==

In &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot; (1967) the Emperor is presented as a towering, immobile, twelve-sided conical structure to which numerous umbilical cables are connected. Twelve large, black hemispheres girdle its midsection with a further two smaller, tan-coloured hemispheres being mounted horizontally on the chest. It has a predominantly white colour scheme with black detailing and speaks in an echoing, grating voice. Shown mounted on a plinth in a corner of the control room in the Dalek City on Skaro, in the story it is destroyed when a civil war breaks out among the Daleks.

The Dalek Emperor was designed by Chris Thompson and built by the BBC Visual Effects Department.

==Dalek Supreme==
In &quot;Planet of the Daleks&quot; (1973) the Dalek Supreme, a member of the Dalek Supreme Council, is despatched to the planet Spiridon. It is tasked with overseeing experiments into invisibility, the production of a plague designed to exterminate all organic life and the deployment of a 10,000 strong Dalek invasion force.

The variant was created utilising a prop owned by screenwriter Terry Nation. The neck bin mesh, struts and neck rings were removed, the latter items being replaced by new rings having a flat, recessed edge detailed with small rivets rather than the usual bevel. Lilac dome lights shaped like upturned jam jars were fitted, together with an eyeball resembling a flashlight which lit up when it spoke. It was painted in gloss black with yellow-gold hemispheres, slats, neck rings and dome. It is uncertain who carried out the conversion work, although the painting of the prop was undertaken by the BBC Visual Effects Department under the direction of Clifford Culley.

The ruthlessness of the Dalek Supreme is demonstrated in the story when it destroys the Dalek leader of the Spiridon task force for failing to meet its mission objectives.

==Necros Daleks==
In &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot; (1985) Davros creates an army of Dalek mutants by manipulating DNA extracted from humans on the planet Necros, where the terminally ill and the dead are being stored in suspended animation. These Necros Daleks are portrayed in the serial as a rebel faction while the grey Daleks from the Dalek home-world of Skaro, seen in the final episode, serve the Supreme Dalek.

In this serial Davros&#x27; life-support chair is shown hovering a short distance above the ground. In a later scene a Dalek kills two saboteurs from an elevated vantage point, implying that Daleks now share this capability. For DVD releases of the serial from 2005 onwards new shots were created to clarify that the Dalek is hovering.

===Standard Necros Dalek===
The Necros Dalek design features detail changes which distinguish it from the standard Mark 3 variant. The skirt angle is steeper at both the front and rear and the hemispheres have a smaller diameter. The shoulder section has only twenty slats, and is broader at the top which, when combined with the skirt, gives it a stockier look. The arm is shorter and the oval between the appendage boxes more elongated. The neck bin strip beneath the lower neck ring is quite distinct in this variant. Necros Daleks are painted light cream with gold hemispheres, shoulder mesh, neck bin mesh, arm and gun.

===Glass Dalek===
Making a single appearance in &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot;, a Glass Dalek is introduced as a transparent, embryonic version of a Necros Dalek in which a grotesquely mutating human head can be seen. It has four neck rings rather than three. It was manufactured primarily from clear Perspex.
==Imperial Daleks==

In &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; (1988) Davros, masquerading as the Dalek Emperor, has gained control of Skaro. He commands an army of Imperial Daleks, created by grafting bionic appendages onto the bodies of Kaled mutants. The Supreme Dalek and its followers are now referred to by the Imperial Daleks as &quot;renegades&quot;.

Imperial Daleks have a similar colour scheme to Necros Daleks, but the designs are otherwise quite distinct from one another. At the direction of BBC visual effects designer Stuart Brisdon, they were realised by the BBC Plastics / Plastering Department using different sets of props created from flexible silicone moulds, enabling both &#x27;hero&#x27; props, and lightweight, rigid foam versions for pyrotechnic sequences, to be constructed quickly.

===Standard Imperial Dalek===
The Imperial Dalek shares a skirt design with the Necros Dalek. In other respects it features many differences when compared with previous variants. It has a stepped fender incorporating a recessed bottom section and integrally moulded collars and slats with no shoulder mesh. There are circular bosses around the appendage ball joints, a hexagonal panel between the appendage boxes, a re-modelled eye and eye discs, a mirrored eye lens with a small gold pupil, flush dome lights and a notched, funnel-like appendage instead of a plunger. The dome has a slightly larger diameter with a sharper angle where the bevelled section meets the curved upper part. The neck bin has a mirrored gold finish and is detailed with a fine circular-section gold mesh overlay, replacing the usual diamond section design. The props are painted predominantly light cream with gold hemisphere, slats, arm, &quot;plunger&quot;, gun, eye discs and light covers.

The hovering capability first seen in &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot; is confirmed in &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; when an Imperial Dalek is shown levitating up a staircase, emitting a red glow from the base of its casing.

===Special Weapons Dalek===
The Special Weapons Dalek is a heavily armoured Imperial variant first seen in &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; and later in &quot;Asylum of the Daleks&quot; (2012), &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (2015) and &quot;The Witch&#x27;s Familiar&quot; (2015). It has no manipulator arm, eye-stalk or dome lights, the latter items being replaced by an encircling row of small, square, translucent ports set around a foreshortened neck section and beneath a truncated dome. In &quot;The Witch&#x27;s Familiar&quot; the ports are shown to glow with an orange light when the Dalek speaks. It is equipped with a large energy cannon mounted on the front of the casing, which in &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; is portrayed completely vaporising two conventional Daleks with a single shot, leaving only scorch marks on the ground. The armour is seen deflecting conventional Dalek weapon fire without suffering damage. Like other Imperial Daleks its livery is white with gold hemispheres, but with a metallic grey colour applied to most of the upper section. The casing appears battle-scarred and far dirtier than other Daleks, which are usually shown in a clean condition.

The BBC &quot;Dalek Survival Guide&quot; book maintains that this variant&#x27;s weapon is fifty times more powerful than a regular Dalek blaster. It notes that Special Weapons Daleks are almost always directly controlled by Dalek commanders and rarely allowed autonomy, except in desperate situations, as they are as likely to fire on fellow Daleks as the enemy.

In Ben Aaronovitch&#x27;s novelisation of &quot;Remembrance&quot; it is stated that the enormous power source required for the Special Weapons Dalek&#x27;s gun resulted in the release of high levels of radiation which altered the structure of the Dalek creature&#x27;s brain, causing insanity. Consequently, other Daleks shun it, ironically for being a mutant, naming it &quot;the Abomination&quot;. The novel states that the Special Weapons Dalek is used only in extreme situations and only the Emperor can maintain complete control over it. The Special Weapons Dalek is also mentioned in the novel &quot;War of the Daleks&quot;. and the Big Finish audio production &quot;The Genocide Machine&quot;. See also The Dark Dimension Dalek.

===Imperial Dalek Emperor ===

The Emperor of the Imperial Dalek faction features in &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot;. During the serial it is revealed that it contains the Kaled Davros, rather than a Dalek mutant. With only his head and partial torso visible, he is carried in a life support casing similar in design to the &quot;TV21&quot; comic version of the Dalek Emperor. The travel machine has no appendages. A translucent hexagonal panel is located centrally on the front of the dome, in a position approximating that where an eye stalk would be mounted on a standard Dalek casing. A strip-light is mounted vertically behind it, which scans from side to side when the Emperor speaks. The front upper section of the dome is shown to operate like a visor, retracting upward and to the rear to reveal Davros within.

==Renegade Daleks==
In &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; (1988) the Imperial Daleks are opposed by &quot;Renegade Daleks&quot;. Most of the Renegades seen in the serial are of the Necros Dalek design but with the prominent neck bin strip below the lower neck ring removed. The shoulder mesh is also coarser than that previously seen, resembling a perforated, solid material. Renegade drones are painted grey with a black fender, hemispheres, collars, slats and appendages. A Renegade Supreme Dalek also appears, being a BBC promotional prop made by Martin Wilkie and Lorne Martin. It too is primarily based on the Necros design but with a different collar, slat, mesh and neck bin arrangement. It is further differentiated by having a small eyeball and orange dome lights and appears in a black paint scheme with silver neck rings, neck struts, hemispheres, collars, mesh and slats.

&quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; was the Daleks&#x27; last appearance in the &quot;classic&quot; &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series, with the programme being put on hiatus by the BBC after December 1989.

==&quot;New Series&quot; Daleks==
After a break of fifteen years from regular production (there was a 1996 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television movie in which the Daleks were heard but not seen), &quot;Doctor Who&quot; returned to British television in March 2005. The sixth episode of the &quot;new series&quot; first season, &quot;Dalek&quot;, featured a lone Dalek, the survivor of a Time War which had ended in the mutual annihilation of both the Daleks and the Doctor&#x27;s race, the Time Lords. While the &quot;New Series&quot; Dalek retains the same basic shape and proportions of its forebears, almost every component has been re-designed to give it a more solid look. The updated appearance was the result of input from &quot;Doctor Who&quot; executive producer Russell T Davies, artist Bryan Hitch and production designer Edward Thomas, with the design being realised by art department assistant designer Matthew Savage.
The first batch of &quot;New Series&quot; Dalek props were constructed by special effects company The Model Unit under the direction of Mike Tucker, with later builds being undertaken by Specialist Models, &#x27;propmaker.co.uk&#x27; and Rubbertoe Props.

===Standard Dalek===
The standard &quot;New Series&quot; Dalek design incorporates additional detailing to many of the components including the dome, gun, appendage boxes, plunger and eyeball. The fender is larger with a bevelled edge, the lower collar is integral to the casing and the upper collar and mesh are omitted, being replaced by a raised shoulder section beneath the neck bin. The slats have an indented central channel running down their length and the neck bin mesh has a denser, more complex design. The dome lights are substantially larger and enclosed in metallic cages and the eye stalk pivot is surrounded by a cowl, below which is a horizontal oblong depression containing an ideogram unique to each Dalek. The standard &quot;New Series&quot; Dalek is finished in a metallic bronze colour scheme.

This Dalek design exhibits previously unseen abilities, many of which are realised using computer-generated imagery.&lt;ref name=&quot;DWC 1/6&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The casing has a swivelling midsection incorporating the appendage boxes, providing a 360-degree field of fire. It can also open by splitting down the front centreline to reveal the mutant within. In &quot;Dalek&quot; (2005) the hemispheres are shown to be recessed spheres and components of a self-destruct mechanism. They are able to separate from the Dalek&#x27;s casing and create an encircling sphere of energy within which the Dalek is destroyed without trace. The plunger has been transformed into a versatile tool with an adaptable shape which can interface with keyboards and control mechanisms, upload data, drain power and crush a human skull.

&quot;New Series&quot; Daleks have been shown flying both in the vacuum of space and planetary atmospheres. They can regenerate by absorbing residual radiation and DNA from a time-traveller who touches them (&quot;Doomsday&quot; (2006)) and have a force field which can disintegrate bullets before they strike the casing. The height of the new design was chosen so that the eye stalk would be level with the eyes of the Doctor&#x27;s companion Rose Tyler, as portrayed by actress Billie Piper.

Minor variations to the standard &quot;new series&quot; design have been shown. The single Dalek seen in &quot;Dalek&quot; differs from those appearing in subsequent episodes in that the lower shoulder collar is the same brass colour as its slats, instead of being bronze. A Dalek is seen in &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot; (2005) with its plunger replaced by a spherical appendage incorporating a three-pincer claw and an extendable cutting torch. The story shows it being used by the Dalek force invading the Satellite 5 space station to breach an internal blast door. The toy manufacturer Character Options has used the term &quot;Assault Dalek&quot; on promotional material and packaging for licensed scale Dalek action figures having the claw/cutter appendage. The episode &quot;Victory of the Daleks&quot; (2010), set during World War II, features two &quot;New Series&quot; Daleks masquerading as British secret weapons. Their casings are painted in camouflage green with a Union Jack replacing the identifying ideogram on the dome front. Canvas ammunition pouches are fixed around the shoulders and in one scene a Dalek is shown operating outdoors with opaque fabric covers fitted over its dome lights. The Daleks are also seen carrying a tea tray and box files with their plungers angled upward, an ability not previously demonstrated. These Daleks are referred to as &quot;Ironsides&quot; in the story. The BBC webcast mini-episode &quot;The Final Battle&quot; (2024) features a red Dalek with gold hemispheres, collar and slats, and two dull silver versions with black hemispheres and a dark grey collar, one of which has a three-pronged appendage replacing the plunger. 

===Emperor&#x27;s personal guard===

Repeating the motif first seen in 1967 serial &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot;, a number of black-domed Daleks appear briefly in &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot;, forming a guard around the Dalek Emperor. Some of the guards are also differentiated by the replacement of the standard plunger with a metallic sphere, on the front of which is a glowing lens. In some instances the sphere is held by blade-like projections while the support for a second, larger type is provided by a tubular framework. These specialised appendages are not referred to or shown in use during the episode, nor is their purpose explained. Both the BBC&#x27;s Doctor Who website and the publication &quot;Doctor Who: Aliens and Enemies&quot; describe them as weapons. The packaging for the Character Options 12&quot; radio control model of the Emperor&#x27;s Guard variant identifies the device as a &quot;multiple spectrum sensor arm&quot;.

===Emperor Dalek ===
An Emperor Dalek features in the 2005 series finale &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot;. Escaping the Time War which resulted in the apparent destruction of both the Daleks and Time Lords alike, its ship had fallen through time and space to the edge of Earth&#x27;s Solar System. Having then recreated the Dalek race this Emperor regards itself as an immortal god and the Daleks worship it as such. The Emperor Dalek mutant floats in a transparent cylindrical tank below a large dome which is adorned with lights and an eyestalk. Two mechanical arms are mounted to the base of the tank. The central structure is connected by articulated joints to three flanking panels, to which large hemispheres are attached.

&quot;Doctor Who&quot; production designer Edward Thomas was responsible for the overall appearance of the Emperor Dalek, with the design being realised by assistant designers Dan Walker and Matthew Savage. The Emperor&#x27;s casing was produced as a 1:6 scale model by The Model Unit, while the Emperor Dalek mutant was an animatronic puppet, again in 1:6 scale, created by visual effects specialist Neill Gorton.

===Cult of Skaro===
The Cult of Skaro is introduced in &quot;Army of Ghosts&quot; (2006) as an elite order of Daleks specifically engineered to use initiative and think like the enemy. They are the first recurring Dalek characters in the history of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television programme. Unlike other Daleks the four members of the Cult have individual names; Sec, Thay, Jast and Caan. While Daleks Thay, Jast and Caan appear identical to other Daleks, Dalek Sec is distinguished by a black casing.

The Cult are shown to possess a sense of individuality and the ability to initiate an &quot;emergency temporal shift&quot; to escape danger by travelling through time and space. In &quot;Doomsday&quot; a combination of three plungers are used to extract information from a person&#x27;s mind with lethal results (although it is implied that this can be done without killing the victim). In the episode &quot;Daleks in Manhattan&quot; (2007) the plungers of the Cult of Skaro Daleks are used to detect the intelligence of human subjects, and in one scene a plunger is temporarily replaced by a syringe-like device. The BBC book &quot;Doctor Who Files: The Cult of Skaro &quot; states that Dalek Sec&#x27;s black casing is constructed from &quot;Metalert&quot;, an enhanced form of Dalekanium reinforced with flidor gold and sap from the extinct Arkellis flower. This fictional material and its constituents have their origins in the &quot;TV Century 21&quot; Dalek comic strip from 1965, where they are mentioned in the stories &quot;Duel of the Daleks&quot; and &quot;Genesis of Evil&quot;.

===Vault Daleks===
Appearing in the linked episodes &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot; (2008) and &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; (2008), Vault Daleks watch over Davros in the Vault of &quot;The Crucible&quot; space station, acting as both bodyguards and warders. Although unnamed during the episodes in which they appear, the term is used for the variant on the BBC&#x27;s Doctor Who website. Character Options named its licensed scale toys of the variant &quot;Crucible Daleks&quot;.

Vault Daleks form part of the recreated Dalek race each of which, Davros states, has been genetically engineered with cells taken from his own body. Instead of the standard plunger they are fitted with a claw-like appendage incorporating eight &quot;pincers&quot;, which are shown to fit directly into some of the ship&#x27;s controls.

===Death Squad Daleks===
In the episode &quot;Revolution of the Daleks&quot;, Death Squad Daleks are introduced. According to the episode&#x27;s narrative, they are enforcers of the Dalek race&#x27;s purity through the destruction of any Daleks which are considered to be genetically corrupt. These Daleks are visually distinguished by having their plunger replaced by a five-pincered claw, similar in design to that fitted to Reconnaissance Scout Daleks and Defence Drone Daleks.

===Executioner Daleks===
New Series Dalek variants equipped with a five-pincered claw manipulator appendage and a multi-barrelled Gatling gun-style energy weapon appear in the 2022 New Year’s Day special episode &quot;Eve of the Daleks&quot;. Their stated mission is to execute special targets, including the Doctor.

===Supreme Dalek===

A Supreme Dalek appears in &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot; and &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; (2008), and &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; and &quot;The Witch&#x27;s Familiar&quot; (2015) as leader of the Dalek forces, outranking even Davros. This variant is a radical departure from the standard &quot;New Series&quot; design. It is painted red with gold hemispheres, collar and neck rings. It has three plinth-mounted dome lights featuring cages with three, rather than four uprights, and large golden struts connecting its shoulders to an extended neck bin. Its voice is deeper than the other Daleks, resembling that of the 2005 series&#x27; Dalek Emperor. Nicholas Briggs, who provided the voice talent for the Dalek, stated that he adopted a grandiose delivery for the Supreme Dalek to fit his perception of the character as being egotistical.&lt;ref name=&quot;DWC 4/12&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Dalek was designed by &quot;Doctor Who&quot; production designer Edward Thomas, realised by design assistant Peter McKinstry and created by propmaker.co.uk.

==New Paradigm Daleks==
In &quot;Victory of the Daleks&quot; (2010) five examples of a new Dalek variant are introduced, described in the narrative as forming &quot;a new Dalek paradigm&quot;. They are created from pure Dalek DNA contained in a device called a &quot;Progenitor&quot;. Their design is the result of input from &quot;Doctor Who&quot; executive producer Steven Moffat, production designer Edward Thomas, &quot;Victory of the Daleks&quot; writer Mark Gatiss and concept artist Peter McKinstry. The props were produced by the BBC Art Department under the supervision of senior prop maker Barry Jones.

Each of the five New Paradigm variants has a casing of a different colour, representing their role in Dalek society: red, Drone; blue, Strategist; orange, Scientist; yellow, Eternal and white, Supreme. Speaking on the programme &quot;Doctor Who Confidential&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Executive Producer Steven Moffat stated that the function of the Eternal Dalek had yet to be decided, while writer Mark Gatiss confirmed that the bright colours of the New Paradigm Daleks were inspired by the Daleks seen in the 1960s Amicus films.

New Paradigm Daleks are taller than previous variants, having a substantial fender reminiscent of Movie Daleks. The skirt section consists of raised panels with bevelled edges to which forty-eight hemispheres are fixed in twelve columns. The hemispheres are coloured grey with the exception of the Eternal Dalek, where they are black. The central rear skirt panel is enlarged to form a broad spine featuring a recessed horizontal louvre assembly. Published design drawings and commentary by concept artist Peter McKinstry indicates that this section is capable of opening to deploy alternative weapons which would traverse around the midsection to replace the standard armament, although this has not been portrayed on screen. The skirt is surmounted by a prominent, slatless shoulder section, divided by a horizontal groove and featuring integral appendage boxes. The neck is devoid of struts and consists of four flared rings detailed with small vertical slots, and is mounted towards the front of the Dalek giving the appearance of a prominent hump to the rear shoulder section. The dome, to which two cylindrical lights are fitted, is missing the chamfered lower section applied to previous variants. The gun is larger than that previously seen on the programme and is shown causing the complete disintegration of another Dalek. The eye design features five closely spaced discs of identical diameter behind an eyeball, inset with horizontal fins, on the front of which is a veined &quot;organic&quot; lens which glows with a yellow light. It is mounted to the dome on a ball joint.

Two variations on the New Paradigm design have been shown. The Series 5 finale &quot;The Big Bang&quot; features a pair of fossilised New Paradigm &#x27;Stone Daleks&#x27; having the appearance of severely weathered statues. They are remnants left when, in the episode, most of history is erased by the destruction of the universe. The term Stone Dalek is derived from a listing in the episode credits. In the Series 7 episode &quot;Asylum of the Daleks&quot; red Drone and blue Strategist Daleks are shown with their original bright colour schemes replaced by a deeper, metallic hue. The rear of the props are also seen with minor modifications, rendering the spine slightly less prominent.

The design of the New Paradigm Daleks proved to be controversial and failed to generate much enthusiasm among fans of the TV series. In 2015, commenting on the introduction of the New Paradigm, Moffat said &quot;Well I suppose if I&#x27;m completely honest - and it&#x27;s all my fault, no one else&#x27;s fault - I don&#x27;t think that was a great idea. When I looked at them in person I thought &#x27;My God, the new Daleks are awesome. they&#x27;re so huge and powerful, they&#x27;re brilliant.&#x27; But I learned a grave lesson: which is that when you put them on screen, of course, they don&#x27;t look bigger, they just make all the other Daleks look smaller.&quot; Moffat stated that the New Paradigm Daleks hadn&#x27;t been abandoned, however. &quot;...I now consider them an officer class of Dalek.&quot; &quot;They haven&#x27;t gone away. We still have them. But that&#x27;s the answer. The answer to most questions I find is that I&#x27;ve made a mistake.&quot;

==Reconnaissance Scout Daleks==
Appearing in the 2019 episode &quot;Resolution&quot;, Reconnaissance Scout Daleks are described as being the first of their kind to leave the Dalek home planet, Skaro, and as possessing abilities not present in other Daleks. The original design of the Reconnaissance Scout travel machine is not established as, in the story, the casing of the individual that visited Earth was destroyed 900 years before the time in which the episode is set. A replacement that it fabricates from scrap components incorporates some simplified bronze New Series Dalek design elements (including fewer, but larger hemispheres) while introducing augmented weaponry in the form of six small missiles housed behind the front two columns of skirt hemispheres.

The Reconnaissance Scout Dalek mutant shown in the episode resembles a grey-green octopus-like being, which can attach itself to the back of, and control, a human host. In the narrative, it was hacked into three pieces which were then buried thousands of miles apart. The creature did not die, however, but became dormant for centuries. When one of the pieces is uncovered and exposed to ultra-violet light, the mutant is able to gather the other pieces by teleportation and reassemble itself.

==Defence Drone Daleks==
In the 2020 episode &quot;Revolution of the Daleks&quot;, an industrialist has one of his scientists create advanced robotic defence drones based upon the stolen remains of the Reconnaissance Scout Dalek casing, seen in the episode &quot;Resolution&quot; (see above). Unaware that the casing once contained a living creature, and discovering organic cells inside it, the scientist clones them and inadvertently creates an imperfect copy of the Reconnaissance Scout Dalek mutant. The mutant then seizes control of the scientist and forces him to make further copies of itself to inhabit the drone casings, to exterminate all human life and take over the planet.
The Defence Drone casings shown in the episode are similar in design to the Reconnaissance Scout Dalek&#x27;s replacement travel machine, but with a predominantly black colour scheme and cleaner lines.

==Dalek hybrids==
Hybridisation between Daleks and other species has been a recurring theme in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television programme since the 1960s.

===Physical Hybrids===
In &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot; (1985) Davros creates a new breed of Dalek mutants to command. He uses as source material the severed heads of terminal human medical patients in the Tranquil Repose mausoleum and suspended animation facility on the planet Necros. During the early stages of the conversion process the victims retain some memory and awareness of their humanity, but by the end of the metamorphosis they have become fully Dalek in nature, if not appearance.

In &quot;Dalek&quot; (2005) a dying Dalek&#x27;s casing is touched by Rose Tyler, a companion of the Doctor. During this brief physical contact the Dalek absorbs enough of her DNA to regenerate itself and its damaged travel machine. It later becomes apparent that this genetic material has caused it to mutate further, as it begins to experience human emotions. It finally becomes trapped in an agony of conflict and self-loathing, and destroys itself.
In &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot; (2005) the Emperor Dalek and the few surviving members of its crew hide in space for centuries after the Time War, harvesting organic material from captured humans and genetically manipulating it to rebuild their race. The Emperor tells the Doctor that a new Dalek army has been created using &quot;filleted, pulped and sifted&quot; human bodies, although they still consider themselves to be &quot;...pure and blessed Dalek&quot;. When a Dalek is destroyed and the mutant revealed it is of a different appearance to the mutant seen in &quot;Dalek&quot;, the prop hinting at a human heritage. Mutants originating from Kaled stock appear to have a closed, vestigial second eye, set below and to one side of the sighted eye. The mutant in &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot; seems to have two identical symmetrically set eyes above which is a prominent supraorbital ridge. A large fleshy mass protrudes below the eyes, with folds suggestive of a mouth-like orifice.

In the two-part story &quot;Daleks in Manhattan&quot; and &quot;Evolution of the Daleks&quot; (2007) the Cult of Skaro, stranded in 1930s America following an emergency temporal shift, attempt to rebuild the Dalek race. Their leader, Dalek Sec, traps in its casing Mr. Diagoras, a human collaborator, and merges with him to become a Human/Dalek hybrid. The process results in a mutated humanoid creature with fingers tapered to points, a large, exposed brain and a single eye set in a face framed by six thick tentacles. The voice is an amalgam of human and Dalek characteristics. Sec then orders that hybrids should be created having human bodies and emotions, coupled with Dalek intelligence, to eradicate the Daleks&#x27; obsession with universal supremacy which has led them to the brink of extinction. Believing that Daleks should remain pure and Sec is now a traitor to their race, the other Cult members bind it in chains and adjust the conversion process to produce hybrids which are completely Dalek in nature. Sec is killed preventing Cult member Dalek Thay from exterminating the Doctor.

The episode &quot;Asylum of the Daleks&quot; (2012) introduces the Dalek planet Asylum where a young woman, Oswin Oswald, has become trapped following a spaceship crash. A nanogene cloud, designed to convert all other life forms to serve the planet&#x27;s security system, completely transforms her into a Dalek to preserve her genius-level intellect for Dalek use. Oswin is initially unaware of her condition, having created the self-delusion of continuing humanity to protect herself from the horror of her situation. Ultimately she is able to overcome her re-emergent Dalek personality and assist the Doctor and his companions to escape the planet. She perishes when the Daleks destroy the Asylum from space.

===Mental Hybrids===
In &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot; (1967) the Daleks trap the Doctor into identifying the &quot;Dalek Factor&quot;, which determines their species&#x27; unquestioning obedience to Dalek ideology and aggressive, pitiless nature. With the aid of a &quot;converted&quot; Doctor they plan to impregnate all of humanity throughout Earth&#x27;s history with the Dalek Factor, transforming them into &quot;Human Daleks&quot;. When, in the story, some Daleks are implanted with the &quot;Human Factor&quot; they lose their aggressive traits and begin to question authority, leading to a catastrophic civil war.

In the two-part story &quot;Daleks in Manhattan&quot; and &quot;Evolution of the Daleks&quot; (2007) the Cult of Skaro attempt to rebuild the Dalek race using Human-Dalek DNA to &quot;format&quot; the brains of thousands of captured people who have had their minds erased. The scheme fails due to the contamination of the Human Daleks with the Doctor&#x27;s DNA, causing them to question their orders and Dalek ideology. After two of the Cult members are destroyed by the Human Daleks during a fire-fight, the remaining Dalek, Caan, declares the hybrids to be a failure and transmits a destruct signal, killing them.

In &quot;The Witch&#x27;s Familiar&quot; (2015), Davros attempts to use the Doctor&#x27;s regeneration energy to transform every Dalek on Skaro into Dalek-Time Lord hybrids. The plan fails when the rotting remains of aged Daleks, which have been discarded in the sewers of the Dalek city, are reanimated by the energy and attack the functional Daleks in revenge.

===Dalek &quot;Puppets&quot;===
Dalek &quot;puppets&quot; are portrayed as life forms converted to serve the Daleks, often covertly. They retain their original, physical form and limited memories from the host, while being endowed with extendable Dalek appendages which are deployed by bursting outward through the skin. Dalek control of the puppets is usually absolute, although a few individual examples have been depicted breaking their mental conditioning and regaining their free will.
First appearing in &quot;Asylum of the Daleks&quot; (2012), humanoids are stated to have been converted to Dalek puppets by nanogenes to act as part of the planet Asylum&#x27;s security system. In the novel &quot;The Dalek Generation&quot; (2013), a child, Jenibeth Blakely, is held prisoner by the Daleks for almost ninety years, during which time she is transformed into a Dalek puppet. Hybrids of this type next appear in the episode &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot; (2013), where the crew of the spacecraft &quot;Church of the Papal Mainframe&quot; are killed by the Daleks during the battle for the planet Trenzalore and turned into Dalek puppets. In &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (2015), Bors, a human friend of the Doctor from the year 1138, is revealed to be a Dalek puppet tasked by his masters with obtaining the TARDIS.

==Dalek variants in films==
Capitalising on the wave of &quot;Dalekmania&quot; gripping Britain following their initial appearances in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; programme, two films featuring the Daleks were produced: &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot; (1965) and &quot;Daleks&#x27; Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.&quot; (1966). The storylines for these movies are essentially identical to the first two TV serials in which the Daleks were seen, with the primary exception that the protagonist is portrayed as an eccentric human inventor with the surname &quot;Who&quot; rather than an alien. Consequently, these Dalek appearances and variants exist in a continuity unique to the film series.

===Mark 1 Movie Daleks===
First appearing in the film &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot;, Movie Daleks have substantial fenders, very similar in shape and design to those seen in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot;. The skirt sits directly on top of the enlarged fender, however, without the intervening step created by the original TV variant base. The appendage boxes are angled slightly differently and the neck ring edges have a steeper bevel. The eyestalk has only five discs, most irises are illuminated and the dome lights are considerably larger than those seen on TV Daleks of the period. Another distinctive design feature is the gun, which has a wider bore than the TV counterpart, lacks mantles and is depicted as projecting a pressurised jet of destructive, lethal vapour rather than an energy discharge.

Three minor Dalek variants appear in the film. Some Daleks are fitted with a two-jawed mechanical claw instead of a plunger, some have integrally moulded collars with reversed angles on the front edges and one is seen with a cutting torch instead of a telescopic arm.

While hemisphere misalignment is an occasionally recurring feature of Daleks seen on television, this issue presents itself in a uniform manner with all of the film props. Most noticeably the four hemispheres on the rear-left corner skirt panel are set higher than those on the other panels.

For their first film appearance the Dalek props were painted in bold colours. Drones are primarily silver with mid-blue domes, hemispheres and fenders, and gold collars. The Dalek leader is black with alternating silver and gold hemispheres, alternating silver and gold neck rings, and gold collars and fender. Its second in command is portrayed as a red Dalek with black hemispheres, gold collars and a gold fender. On all versions the dome lights are coloured red.

The hero props seen in the film were constructed by Shawcraft Engineering while the Daleks with integrally moulded shoulder collars, which were mainly used to make up numbers in crowd scenes, were produced by the Plaster Workshops at Shepperton Studios.

Three Mark 1 Movie Dalek props can occasionally be seen in the Doctor Who television serial &quot;The Chase&quot;, hired from AARU, the production company responsible for the Dr. Who films, to increase numbers. In some scenes their large fenders are missing, with the skirts sitting directly on the floor, and the large dome lights replaced with smaller items as used for the TV props. Their more striking colour scheme is not readily apparent due to the filming of the serial in monochrome. As the film was not released until after &quot;The Chase&quot; was screened, this television appearance is the first occasion that the film props were seen by the public.

===Mark 2 Movie Daleks===
The Dalek variant seen in the film &quot;Daleks&#x27; Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.&quot; is similar in design to the Mark 1 version but with the addition of the upper collar mesh and slats with which the TV versions were by now equipped. At various points in the film a Dalek can be seen with a small silver plunger in place of the usual black item. Another features a scissor-like claw instead of the standard &quot;G-clamp&quot;-shaped device and a gun with mantles. These unusual appendages are not referred to in the story. The misalignment of the hemispheres, evident in &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot;, is once again present.

The colour scheme for the drones used in the second film is essentially the same as that used for the television versions at the time, being silver with grey shoulders, natural aluminium collars and slats, blue hemispheres and a black fender. The narrative fails to establish a precise hierarchy for the Dalek commanders seen in the film. The leader of the expeditionary force appears to be a gold Dalek with natural aluminium collars and slats, black hemispheres and a black fender. A black Dalek with gold hemispheres, natural aluminium collars and slats and a black fender is in charge of a mining operation in Bedfordshire, while a red Dalek with silver hemispheres, natural aluminium collars and slats and a black fender with red topping is shown commanding a Dalek spaceship and operations to capture human slaves and wipe-out the resistance. Drones sport blue dome lights, the black and red Daleks have red dome lights and the gold Dalek has yellow dome lights. As for the first film, the Dalek props were constructed by Shawcraft Engineering.

==Dalek variants in the theatre==
Daleks with unique characteristics have appeared in stage productions consisting of both original works and adaptations of serials from the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television programme. In addition to the professional productions detailed below a number of amateur presentations have been staged. These include &quot;Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday&quot; (Porirua Little Theatre, Titahi Bay, Porirua, New Zealand, 1984), &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot; (New Theatre Royal, Portsmouth, England, 2006) and &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot; (New Theatre Royal, Portsmouth, England, 2007).

===&quot;The Curse of the Daleks&quot; (1965)===
&quot;The Curse of the Daleks&quot; was a stage play written by David Whitaker and Terry Nation which appeared for one month at the Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in London, England beginning on 21 December 1965.

Five Daleks were used in the production; four silver/grey drones and a black version. Built by Shawcraft, the manufacturers of the original TV and Movie props, they were of the basic Mark 1 Movie Dalek design but with fenders, dome lights and guns of the type seen on TV Daleks at the time.

===&quot;Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday&quot; (1974)===
&quot;Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday&quot; was a stage play written by Terrance Dicks which ran at the Adelphi Theatre in London, England, for four weeks beginning on 16 December 1974.

Five Daleks were created for the play by Philip Poole and Phillip Alleston under the guidance of model maker, sculptor and film designer Allister Bowtell. They were of a similar design to the Supreme Dalek from &quot;Planet of the Daleks&quot;, having flat-edged neck rings, a strutless neck bin and an enlarged fender. Turn-indicator style lights were used, with the gun stick rods being thinner and more angular than those fitted to either the TV or film variants.

Contemporary publicity photographs show Trevor Martin, the actor portraying Doctor Who in the play, posing with the &quot;Planet of the Daleks&quot; Supreme and a Mark 2 Movie Dalek, with the latter prop displaying various alterations to its dome lights and appendages. Neither of these props actually appeared in the stage production.

===&quot;The Ultimate Adventure&quot; (1989)===
&quot;Doctor Who – The Ultimate Adventure&quot; was a stage play written by Terrance Dicks. It toured Great Britain, appearing at twenty theatres between April and August 1989.

Four blue/grey drones and a Black Dalek (credited as &quot;The Chief Dalek&quot;) appeared in the play. Specific design differences from the television version of the time included a skirt section flared more to the sides and less to the front and rear, a single vertical column of hemispheres on the skirt side panels and a higher fender. The props had large, rectangular dome lights, a bottom neck ring which protruded beyond the shoulder line, and lacked both eye discs and slats. These Daleks also featured a dome that was a true hemisphere rather than the usual bevelled design and a single, oblong appendage box running across the front of the body.

A Dalek Emperor prop was also created, being a scaled-down but otherwise faithful reproduction of the version that appeared in &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot; with the addition of large wing-like structures to the sides. The Dalek props used in the production were built by the theatrical suppliers Suffolk Scenery.

==Dalek variants in comics, books, audio dramas and video games==
Various writers and artists have created new Dalek variants for media other than television, film and the theatre. The depiction of Daleks with coloured casings has also been used to indicate rank, although these differentiations do not constitute separate variants as such. Of particular note in this respect is John Peel&#x27;s BBC Books &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel &quot;War of the Daleks&quot; in which grey, blue, red, black and gold Daleks are described as having successively higher status, all serving under the Dalek Prime. Other examples are the &quot;TV21&quot; Dalek comic strip in which a Black Dalek is shown acting as second-in-command to the Golden Emperor, and Trevor Baxendale&#x27;s novel &quot;Prisoner of the Daleks&quot; where a Dalek Inquisitor General is described as being of the &quot;New Series&quot; design but having a casing of gunmetal black with gold slats and hemispheres.

===Golden Emperor Dalek===
The concept of an Emperor Dalek was first introduced in &quot;The Dalek Book&quot; (1964), re-appearing shortly thereafter in the &quot;TV21&quot; comic strip &quot;The Daleks&quot; (1965–1967).

In the comic strip version of events the planet Skaro was inhabited by two warring humanoid species; the tall, peaceful Thals and the aggressive blue-skinned Daleks. The Daleks build a neutron bomb to finally destroy the Thals and bring the conflict to an end. A meteorite storm causes the device to detonate prematurely, devastating Skaro and the planet&#x27;s civilisations. The only survivors of the Dalek race are the scientist Yarvelling and the warlord Zolfian. While exploring the shattered remains of their world they are attacked, and then interrogated, by a prototype war machine which Yarvelling had created shortly before the holocaust. It is implied that these machines were intended to act as semi-autonomous robotic warriors. It informs them that it is actually a mutated Dalek, the result of radiation from the neutron bomb explosion, which has commandeered the casing to use as a travel machine. It says that there are many more mutants and persuades Yarvelling and Zolfian to build more casings to house them. Before the last two humanoid Daleks die, exhausted by their labours and the effects of radiation, it appoints itself as Emperor and has a special casing constructed to reflect its new rank, made from &quot;...Flidor gold, Quartz and Arkellis flower sap...&quot;. The Golden Emperor is usually depicted as being slightly shorter than a standard Dalek with a disproportionately large spherical head section.

The title page of &quot;The Dalek Book&quot; lists three contributing illustrators; Richard Jennings, John Woods and A.B. Cornwell. As none of the stories are individually credited it is uncertain which artist or artists first developed the Golden Emperor design. Two illustrators provided interpretations of the Golden Emperor for the &quot;TV21&quot; comic strip; Jennings again, and Ron Turner who superseded him in later instalments.

===&quot;The Dalek Book&quot; Daleks===
&quot;The Dalek Book&quot; (1964) is notable, although not unique, in portraying a Dalek variant which has a &quot;speaker grille&quot; set centrally on the chest and, occasionally, a stylised numeral on the dome. Neither of these items has ever been incorporated in a Dalek variant shown on-screen.

During rehearsals for the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial in which they appeared a numbered piece of card was taped to the dome of each Dalek prop to assist the director in distinguishing them, with a tape roll being wedged behind the top front collar for safekeeping. These objects subsequently appeared in reference photographs of the Daleks provided by the BBC to merchandise producers, with the illustrators of &quot;The Dalek Book&quot; interpreting them as speaker grilles and insignia. Shortly after the publication of this volume other merchandise and packaging appeared featuring Daleks with the speaker grille design element. These included Dalek board games, bagatelle, &quot;Cutta-Mastic&quot; polystyrene sculpting sets, marble mazes and a ray gun torch.

===Dalek Emperor===
A Dalek Emperor, described as being similar that seen in &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot;, appears in the Telos novella &quot;The Dalek Factor&quot; (2004) by Simon Clark. It is referred to as &quot;an Emperor&quot;, implying there is more than one during the period in which the story is set.

===Dalek Prime===
A Dalek Prime is referred to in several of the novels based on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials (&quot;The Chase&quot;, &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot;, &quot;The Power of the Daleks&quot;, &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot;). It is also mentioned in John Peel&#x27;s Eighth Doctor novels, &quot;War of the Daleks&quot; (1997) and &quot;Legacy of the Daleks&quot; (1998). Although portrayed as being a leader its precise position in the Dalek hierarchy is not made clear. In &quot;War of the Daleks&quot; its description closely matches that of the &quot;TV21&quot; Golden Emperor.

===Dalek Time Controller===
The Time Controller Dalek features in the Big Finish Productions Doctor Who audio dramas &quot;Patient Zero&quot; (2009), &quot;Lucie Miller&quot; (2011), &quot;To the Death&quot; (2011), &quot;Dark Eyes&quot; (2012), &quot;Dark Eyes 2&quot; (2014), &quot;Dark Eyes 4&quot; (2015) and the novel &quot;The Dalek Generation&quot; (2013). It is portrayed as being genetically engineered to have an enhanced perception of the space-time vortex, enabling it to direct Dalek strategies involving time travel while limiting temporal destabilisation. Cover art and promotional illustrations depict the Dalek Time Controller with a blue casing of the Mark 3 design, with an extended neck bin and additional, diagonal neck rings. The novel describes it as the ultimate form of Dalek life, able to command even the Supreme Dalek, and having a neck bin encircled by diagonally revolving rings of vortex energy. The Dalek Time Controller is voiced in the audio productions by actor Nicholas Briggs.

===Dalek Time Strategist===
The Dalek Time Strategist is portrayed as having similar abilities to the Dalek Time Controller, while being subservient to the Supreme Dalek. It first appears in the Big Finish &quot;Dark Eyes 4&quot; 2015 audio drama episodes &quot;The Monster of Montmartre&quot; and &quot;Master of the Daleks&quot;, and subsequently features in other episodes of the Big Finish audio dramas &quot;The War Doctor 3&quot;, &quot;The War Doctor 4&quot;, &quot;Gallifrey 9 : Time War Volume 1&quot; and &quot;The Eighth Doctor: The Time War 3&quot;. The Dalek Time Strategist is voiced in the audio productions by actor Nicholas Briggs.

Cover art and promotional illustrations depict the Dalek Time Strategist with a purple casing of the New Series Supreme Dalek design, with an extended neck bin containing a glowing &quot;plasma ball&quot; and additional, diagonal neck rings.

===&quot;Hayakawa&quot; Daleks===
Four of the Target Books &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial novelisations were translated into Japanese by Yukio Sekiguchi and published in 1980 by Hayakawa Bunko books. These included Doctor Who and the Daleks as and Doctor Who and the Day of the Daleks as Artist Michiaki Sato was commissioned to provide illustrations for these volumes.

Unlike other comic book and graphic artists whose work, however stylised, usually presents relatively minor variations to the standard Dalek form, Sato&#x27;s renderings show a unique Dalek variant which is a radical departure from the recognised design. Possible reasons for this include lack of access to source material, the Japanese publishers having no rights to the use of the Dalek image and the artist simply being allowed the free rein of his imagination.

===Marine Daleks===
Marine Daleks, introduced in the novel &quot;War of the Daleks&quot; (1997), are torpedo-shaped with their eye at the front and have a gun stick and grappling arm parallel to their body. They are stated to be larger than standard Daleks.

===Marsh Daleks===
The 1964 &quot;The Dalek Book&quot; story &quot;The Monsters of Gurnian&quot;, written by Terry Nation and David Whittaker, features bipedal Marsh Daleks which are used to keep in check the Horrorkons; two headed plesiosaur-like creatures which inhabit the swamps of the planet Gurnian. As none of the stories or artwork in the book are individually credited it is unknown which of the contributing artists developed the Marsh Dalek design. Marsh Daleks are also referenced briefly in Marc Platt&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel &quot;Lungbarrow&quot; (1997), in which it is said that during the 26th century humans fought and disabled them by shooting at their legs with high-impulse carbines.

===Predator Dalek===
The Predator Dalek features in the Doctor Who novel &quot;Engines of War&quot; (2014), written by George Mann. It is stated to be a prototype created to make a perfect Dalek during The Last Great Time War. This is to be accomplished by capturing the War Doctor, removing his memory and emotions to leave only his creativity, and then integrating him with its technology. It is described as being of the standard &quot;New Series&quot; Dalek design but twice as large, with a deep, metallic vermillion skirt and black hemispheres.

===Psyche Daleks===
Appearing briefly in the comic strip &quot;Emperor of the Daleks&quot; (1993), written by John Freeman and Paul Cornell, Psyche Daleks are depicted with a large mass of green brain tissue contained within a transparent sphere that sits on top of the shoulder section in place of the normal neck bin and dome. In the story a Psyche Dalek is used to control a small group of partially robotised prisoners through a remote device mounted on its arm in place of a plunger. The comic strip was drawn by Lee Sullivan.

===Scout Daleks===
In Ben Aaronovitch&#x27;s novelisation of &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; (1990) the Imperial Dalek faction use Scout Daleks which are described as being more powerful and streamlined than standard Daleks.

===Spider Daleks===
Spider Daleks were a variant proposed by John Leekley for an aborted &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television movie to be produced by Amblin Entertainment in 1994. Spider Daleks directly based on the Amblin production concept sketches were eventually used in the comic strip &quot;Fire and Brimstone&quot; (1997) in which they are presented as a radically different form of Dalek from a parallel universe. The strip was drawn by Martin Geraghty and Robin Smith. In John Peel&#x27;s novel &quot;War of the Daleks&quot; (1997) they are depicted as creations of Davros and described as being slightly larger than a standard Dalek, with eight legs emerging from the lower half. They are said to have greater manoeuvrability than standard Daleks, at the cost of being more vulnerable at their joints.

===Strider Daleks===
Giant versions of the Spider Dalek, known as Striders, are mentioned in John Peel&#x27;s novel &quot;War of the Daleks&quot; (1997). They are said to be ten times larger than a standard Spider Dalek and equipped with additional weapons.

===Klade===
The Klade are a people from the distant future in Lance Parkin&#x27;s BBC Eighth Doctor novel &quot;Father Time&quot; (2001) and the Miranda spin-off comics (2003). Although physically humanoid they share many cultural characteristics with the Daleks and appear to regard Dalek history as their own. Their name is both an anagram of &quot;Dalek&quot;, as &quot;Dalek&quot; is itself of &quot;Kaled&quot; and a play on the biological term &quot;clade&quot;, being a group of species sharing a common ancestor. They are &quot;...the super-evolved descendants of the Daleks&quot;, the implication being that, like the Thals, their mutation has come &quot;full circle&quot; and returned them to a humanoid form.

===Skaro Degradations===
The Skaro Degradations are first mentioned in the Doctor Who television serial &quot;The End of Time&quot; (2009), where the Tenth Doctor says they were one of the horrors of The Last Great Time War. They later appear in the War Doctor novel &quot;Engines of War&quot; (2014) by George Mann, described as being unstable and unpredictable abominations created by Dalek experiments to retro-evolve their own genome. Three types are mentioned in the book. Glider Degradations travel by hovering above the ground. The Dalek mutant is housed in a clear, reinforced compartment set beneath a standard Dalek dome and resembles a limbless, humanoid torso. Mechanical arms and energy weapons are located on both sides of the casing. Spider Degradations are egg-shaped with red and black hemispheres, move on three legs and are armed with four energy weapons. Temporal Weapon Degradations are similar to Special Weapons Daleks and equipped with a temporal cannon capable of erasing its victims from history.

===Alternate timeline Daleks===
Daleks from an alternate timeline appear in the E-book &quot;The Ripple Effect&quot; (2013) by Malorie Blackman. The alternate Daleks are portrayed as a civilised, philosophical, peace-loving race, speaking with quiet, modulated voices and having individual names. Most of the alternate Daleks have two manipulator arms and no weapon, with only those defending Skaro from space being armed. Ultimately the Doctor discovers that the alternate timeline is unstable, causing the Universe to decay. Travelling back in time he restores the original timeline, erasing the alternate Daleks from existence.

===Stained Glass Daleks===
Stained Glass Daleks feature in the Big Finish Productions Doctor Who audio drama &quot;Order of the Daleks&quot; (2016). They are depicted as having ornate, stained glass casings and are harboured by monks of the Brotherhood of the Black Petal on the technologically undeveloped planet Strellin. The Stained Glass Dalek concept was created by Mike Tucker, with the cover artwork for the audio production being designed and rendered by Chris Thompson.

===New Paradigm Dalek Emperor===
Appearing at the climax of &quot;City of the Daleks&quot; (2010), the first instalment of the video game &quot;Doctor Who: The Adventure Games&quot;, the New Paradigm Dalek Emperor is almost identical to the New Series Emperor Dalek seen in the 2005 episode &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot;. Notable differences are the dome and eye assembly, which are of the New Paradigm design, and a blue colour scheme.

===The Eternity Clock Dalek Emperor===
Featured in the video game &quot;Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock&quot; (2012), this version of the Dalek Emperor first appears as a large, levitating, purple sphere, studded with silver hemispheres. This is shown to be a shell which can expand and split into sixteen vertical segments, positionable to form a defensive barrier. The internal structure is mainly of the New Paradigm design, consisting of a large dome incorporating a foreshortened eye stalk and thin, extended dome lights, supported by an inverted neck bin. Below this a conical metallic structure tapers downward towards a circular, rotating weapons platform to which it is connected by an energy field. Arranged evenly around the edge of the platform are three &quot;New Series&quot; Dalek style gun sticks.

===Berserker Daleks===
Berserker Daleks feature in the Big Finish Productions Doctor Who audio drama &quot;Gallifrey: War Room 2: Manoeuvres&quot; (2023). They are depicted as generally conforming to the &quot;New Series&quot; Dalek design, but are mounted on a large base equipped with &#x27;tank tracks&#x27; while the standard manipulator arm and gun stick are replaced by a circular saw and multi-barrel energy weapon respectively. They are described in promotional material for the CD as being bred for savagery and almost impossible to destroy, with the ability to repair damage to their casings using any shrapnel or components from other damaged Berserkers available in close proximity.

==Other notable Dalek variants==

===Dark Dimension Dalek===
&quot;Lost in the Dark Dimension&quot; was the working title of a feature-length BBC &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode, planned to celebrate the programme&#x27;s thirtieth anniversary. Chris Fitzgerald at Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop was engaged to redesign the Special Weapons Dalek for the production. A sketch of the proposed variant was produced at the time by BBC artist Alan Marshall. Notable differences from a standard Dalek include a substantially enlarged fender, an enhanced midsection featuring two large shoulder-mounted cannon and a neck bin encircled by three thick neck rings. Programme development commenced in June 1992 and was officially cancelled in July 1993, with the BBC citing financial and logistical reasons. Although a Dark Dimension Dalek prop was never constructed by the BBC, it has become the subject of a number of illustrations and full size props built by fans.

<doc id="1281865" wikidata="Q280506" url="?curid=1281865" title="Malton, North Yorkshire">
<text>Malton is a market town, civil parish and electoral ward in North Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire, the town has a population measured for both the civil parish and the electoral ward at the 2011 Census as 4,888.

The town is located to the north of the River Derwent, which forms the historic boundary between the North and East Ridings of Yorkshire.

Until 2023 the town was part of the Ryedale district and was the location of the headquarters of the district council.

Facing Malton on the other side of the Derwent is Norton. The Karro Food Group (formerly known as Malton Bacon Factory), Malton bus station and Malton railway station are located in Norton-on-Derwent.

Malton is the local area&#x27;s commercial and retail centre. In the town centre there are small traditional independent shops and high-street names.

Malton has been described as &quot;the food capital of Yorkshire&quot; and was voted one of the best places to live in Britain by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in both the 2017 and 2018 lists.

Malton was named the dog-friendliest town in the UK at the annual Dog Friendly Awards, in association with the Kennel Club, in 2018/19. In 2020 Malton was named as one of the most dog-friendly staycation spots in the UK and the best in Yorkshire.

==History==

=== British ===
A seven-foot-long British oak canoe was found on the farm of Mr Hebden Flowers of South Holme in 1869. The relic was taken to Malton, being intended for the Yorkshire Philosophical Society&#x27;s museum.

===Roman===


The earliest established building in Malton dates from the late first century AD when a Roman auxiliary fort was established, probably under the governor Petilius Cerialis around the same time as &quot;Eboracum&quot;, although it has been suggested that both sites may be slightly earlier. The site was established on the north bank of the River Derwent. A large civilian settlement developed opposite the fort, on the south of the river at Norton. A single Roman cavalry unit, the &quot;Ala Gallorum Picentiana&quot;, is recorded from the site. The Romans left in 429AD when the empire collapsed.

The site remained occupied (and subject to continued development) throughout the four centuries of Roman occupation in Britain, particularly in the Trajanic, Severan, Constantian and Theodosian periods and is notable for the manufacture of jet jewellery at the site as well as a single unique inscription identifying a goldsmith shop.

===Medieval===
There was some form of settlement in New Malton by 1138 and Old Malton was probably also founded in the 1100s; a Gilbertine monastery was built between 1147 and 1154 in Old Malton, and the monastic church was probably built around 1180. The first reference to a market in New Malton was in a 1283 document, indicating that craftsmen and others, such as butchers, were selling their wares.

Earlier, in the 11th century, a wooden Norman castle, Malton Castle, was built in what is now Castle Garden. This was rebuilt in stone by Eustace de Vescy (1169–1216) by the time Richard the Lionheart visited the castle in 1189. Other visitors included Edward II, in 1307 and Robert the Bruce in 1322. The great house subsequently became ruined.

The castle site was inherited by Lord William Eure (c. 1483–1548) in 1544, when he was also made a baron. In 1569 Ralph Eure built a new house on the castle site and in 1602, the house was rebuilt in much grander style. This was a spectacular property and it was described by the diarist Sir Henry Slingsby as the rival of many other great houses, including that at Audley End.

The house was subsequently demolished in 1674 and the stones divided between two sisters, Mary (who married into the Palmes family) and Margaret Eure. (The site is now Castle Garden.) They had quarrelled over their inheritance and the demolition was the settlement ordered by Sheriff Henry Marwood. The Old Lodge Hotel is the remaining fragment of the original Jacobean &quot;prodigy house&quot; and its size hints at the grandeur of the complete structure.

===18th, 19th and early 20th centuries===

According to contemporary archives, during the 18th century attention was paid to improving the facilities for traders in Malton, in particular for the numerous butchers.

Malton Town Hall was first used as a butter market, butter being the main marketable product for many farmers of the day. The town hall was extended and changed at various intervals over the years.

The town&#x27;s Shambles, currently opposite Malton Town Hall, used to be located on the north side of St Michael&#x27;s Church, which still stands in the centre of the Market Place. The Talbot Hotel, still standing and renovated, dates back to the early 17th century and may contain remnants of the medieval town wall. It was initially used as a hunting lodge and became an inn in 1740; it was also a coach stop. The property, with its associated buildings in Talbot Yard, is now Grade II listed. In the Victorian era, it was known as Kimberley&#x27;s Hotel.

A sure sign of a town &#x27;up and coming&#x27; was the advertisement of a &#x27;light coach, setting out from Leeds to Scarborough returning to Malton to dine.&#x27;

In the last year of the 18th century, there was a famine in the area, and a soup kitchen was set up in a brew house in the town. The Earl Fitzwilliam of the time subscribed to a fund, which helped provide &#x27;good strong soup&#x27; for the hungry poor.

In 1801 the population of Old and New Malton numbered 3,788. The workhouse contained 15 elderly people and 17 children.

In 1809 Malton&#x27;s Talbot Hotel was extended and modernised with a third floor being added and new stables being constructed across the road from the hotel.

The town&#x27;s Assembly Rooms were opened in 1814, a place in which &#x27;polite society&#x27; could mingle. An 1833 Gazeteer stated that New Malton did a great deal of trade in coal, corn, butter, etc. There were two churches, four meeting houses for &quot;dissenters&quot;, a free school and a national school. A bridge connected this town to Old Malton. Several schools or academies were operating by the 1820s, on a fee basis.

According to the 1840 edition of &quot;White&#x27;s Gazetteer&quot;, Malton&#x27;s &quot;town and suburbs have much improved during the last twenty years, by the erection of houses; and gas works were constructed in 1832.&quot; The streets of Malton were lit with gas for the first time on 12 November 1832; the first electric light was lit in 1893, powered by a dynamo, in a single location. By 1867, the Malton Waterworks was supplying residents with water.

By 1835, medical care was being provided at The Dispensary on Saville Street; this was a predecessor of the Malton Cottage Hospital which would not open until August 1905, funded by donations and a subscription. As late as 1841, dental care was provided by barbers; a Mr. Moseley was a prominent &quot;surgeon-dentist&quot;.

Newspapers were well established in 1855, when the tax on newspapers was repealed. The Malton Messenger and The Malton &amp; Norton Gazette were both weekly publications.

In 1856, the town was policed by the North Riding, with four men and a superintendent. Thomas Wilson was the Chief Police Officer. The Malton Town Gaol had been opened decades earlier. Work on new police house started in October 1893. By 1881, the Malton Fire Brigade, was operating with a steam engine.

In 1881, the population of Old and New Malton totalled 8,750 persons. Newer industries in New Malton included iron and brass foundries.

The development of the local railway network flourished during the mid-1800s – the York to Scarborough railway opened in 1845 and the Malton and Driffield Junction Railway opened in 1853. The Malton railway station is now Grade II listed (since 1986).

During the early 1900s, electricity was installed in much of the town. Before the Second World War, several buildings were erected, including the Court House, Cottage Hospital and Police Station. The town was bombed during the war.

==Navigation on the River Derwent==
The navigation capacity on the Derwent was one of the earliest in Britain to be significantly improved around 1725, enabling extensive barge traffic to transport goods and produce.

The navigation continued to compete with the railway, having been extended as far as Yedingham after 1810. The river&#x27;s use as a highway declined only after it was bought by the Railway itself and cheaper coal began to arrive by rail, while river maintenance was deliberately neglected.

==Governance==
In medieval times, Malton was briefly a parliamentary borough in the 13th century, and again from 1640 to 1885; the borough was sometimes referred to as &#x27;New Malton&#x27;. It was represented by two Members of Parliament until 1868, among them the political philosopher Edmund Burke, and by one member from 1868 to 1885.

North Yorkshire Council is the local authority.

The current Member of Parliament for Thirsk and Malton (since 2015) is Kevin Hollinrake of the Conservative Party.

==Today==
The Fitzwilliam family has been important in the history of Malton for centuries, and its descendants, as the Fitzwilliam Malton Estate, own much of the commercial area in and around the town. In 1713 The Hon Thomas Watson-Wentworth (father of the 1st Earl of Malton and Marquess of Rockingham) purchased the Manor of Malton, beginning a long association between the town and the Wentworth, Watson-Wentworth, Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, and Naylor-Leyland families. A book detailing the history since 1713 was published in 2013, written by Norman Maitland, entitled &quot;300 years of continuity and change: families and business in Malton from the 18th century to the present.&quot;

Attractions in modern Malton include the signposted remains of the Roman fort at &#x27;Orchard Fields&#x27;, and Malton Priory a Gilbertine priory. Eden Camp, a military themed museum, is located just outside the town. Malton Museum is located at the Subscription Rooms in Yorkersgate. The town has an independent cinema (The Palace Cinema), which also houses a shopping mall, a theatre (The Milton Rooms) and independent retailers, high street shops, cafés, public houses and restaurants. Malton&#x27;s independent microbrewery, Brass Castle Brewery, hosts an annual spring &#x27;BEERTOWN&#x27; festival at the town&#x27;s Milton Rooms. Brass Castle brew their full range of vegan and gluten-free beers in the centre of Malton, including the 2015 UK Supreme Champion Cask Beer: &#x27;Burnout&#x27;. A second microbrewery company in the town is Malton Brewery, which is known for a Yorkshire Pudding Beer produced at Cropton Brewery. Malton Brewery itself is one of Britain&#x27;s smallest, located in a listed building at Navigation Wharf.

Both towns are known in connection with Charles Dickens, who made regular visits to the area to see his friend Charles Smithson. Dickens did not write &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; while staying in Malton, but was inspired by some of the buildings in the town. There have been recent revivals of Dickens-related festivals. Malton and the neighbouring village of Old Malton provide the settings for the collection of stories told in the book, &quot;All is Bright – A Yorkshire Lad&#x27;s Christmas&quot; by Dave Preston.

In September 2013 Ryedale District Council issued their Local Plan Strategy. The current Local Plan, produced in September 2013, supports Malton (together with Norton, its twin town on the south side of the River Derwent) as Ryedale District&#x27;s Principal Town. The Local Plan sees Malton&#x27;s historic town centre as the thriving and attractive cultural and economic heart of the area. During the Plan&#x27;s period until 2027, Malton and Norton will be the focus for the majority of any new development and growth including new housing, employment and retail units. The Local Plan establishes a level of housebuilding of 200 units per annum for the whole district in order to deliver at least 3,000 (net) new homes over the period of 2012 to 2027. Approximately 50% of the planned supply – around 1,500 new homes – will be directed to Malton and Norton. A further plan for employment land is proposed for Malton. Of the 37 hectares of employment land required to meet the needs of the district until 2027, approximately 80% will be allocated towards Malton and Norton. For retail development the plan reflects Malton&#x27;s role as the main retail centre serving Ryedale, and will direct most new retail and other town centre uses to Malton in order to support and promote its role as a shopping, employment, leisure and cultural centre for Ryedale.



Malton holds a market every Saturday, and a farmers&#x27; market once every month. The town has a war memorial and several historical churches (Norton-on-Derwent also holds large church buildings). The town is served by Malton railway station. The livestock market, currently situated on the edge of the town centre will be relocated to a site close to Eden Camp once construction work there is complete.

Malton is the middle-ground between York, Pickering (access to the North York Moors and also a terminus of the North Yorkshire Moors Railway), Scarborough, Filey and Whitby. The route of The White Rose Way, a long-distance walk from Leeds to Scarborough, North Yorkshire also passes through Malton.

Malton and Norton are significant for their horse racing connections and have a number of training stables in the vicinity. The Malton Stables Open Day, held in August 2013, showcased 19 trainer stables. Writer Norman Maitland describes the history of horse racing as &quot;being in the blood in this part of Yorkshire for generations...&quot; with meetings being advertised as early as 1692. The &quot;Malton Races&quot; were run on Langton Wolds, between 1692 and 1861.

Malton is also used to flooding, with notable floods in 1999, 2000, 2007, 2012, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2021.

===We Love Malton===
The &#x27;We Love Malton&#x27; campaign was launched in March 2009. It aimed to reinvigorate the town of Malton as a &#x27;Food Lovers&#x27; destination and raise its appeal with both residents and tourists. The 2015 festival included special guest chef Rosemary Shrager. The Festival for 2018 took place on 27 and 28 May. A harvest festival was also scheduled for 8 September. By 2017, the town was considered to be the food capital of Yorkshire. Malton is also well located for visiting the North York Moors and the seaside towns of Whitby, Scarborough and Bridlington.

===Malton Community Interest Company (Malton CIC)===
Formed in 2011, Malton CIC benefits the area with donations to local organisations, including Ryedale Book Festival. The CIC also finances and provides two hours free parking in Malton&#x27;s Market Place. It helps organise and fund Malton Food Lovers Festival and the Malton Monthly Food Markets.

==Religion==
Malton&#x27;s churches include St Michael&#x27;s Anglican church and Ss Leonard &amp; Mary Catholic church. Preliminary work has commenced at the Methodist Wesley Centre which aims to repurpose the centre for use as a community hub alongside its purpose as a place of worship.

==Education==
There are two secondary schools in Malton and Norton, Malton School, founded in 1547, and Norton College. Primary education is provided by St Mary&#x27;s RC Primary School, Norton Community Primary School and Malton Community Primary School. The nearest independent school is Terrington Hall Prep School.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from either the Emley Moor or Oliver&#x27;s Mount TV transmitters. BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Tyne Tees is also received in the town from the Bilsdale TV transmitter.

Malton&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Radio York, Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire, Capital Yorkshire and Coast &amp; County Radio.

The local newspapers that cover the town are &quot;The York Press&quot; and &quot;Gazette &amp; Herald&quot;.

==Climate==
As with the rest of the British Isles and Yorkshire, Malton possesses a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The nearest Met Office weather station for which records are available is High Mowthorpe, about east of the town centre. Due to its lower elevation, the town centre is likely to be marginally warmer than High Mowthorpe throughout the year.

<text>West Virginia Wesleyan College is a private college in Buckhannon, West Virginia, United States. It has an enrollment of about 1,055 students from 35 U.S. states and 26 countries. The school was founded in 1890 by the West Virginia Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church and is currently affiliated with the United Methodist Church. West Virginia Wesleyan College is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
West Virginia Wesleyan College was founded in 1890 by the West Virginia Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. The school opened in 1890, in a new three-story brick building where the current Lynch-Raine Administration Building now stands. Ohio Wesleyan University and Boston University School of Theology alumnus Bennett W. Hutchinson was the college&#x27;s first president.

Following ten years focusing on college preparatory work, college-level instruction was first offered in 1900 culminating in the first baccalaureate degrees in 1905. For one year the institution was named Wesleyan University of West Virginia but it was quickly changed to West Virginia Wesleyan College in honor of John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. Pre-college instruction continued until 1923 when it was discontinued because the high schools in the state had grown enough to adequately perform that task.

=== Recent years ===
Pamela Jubin Balch, a 1971 graduate of Wesleyan, became the college&#x27;s 18th president in July 2006. Dr. Balch is the first woman to serve as president in the college&#x27;s history. At the outset of her tenure as president, Balch reinstated the college&#x27;s briefly-discontinued nursing program as well as its 3-2 engineering program. The college has since expanded its academic programs, adding graduate degrees in athletic training, business administration, English Writing, and nursing.

==Academics==
The college offers over 50 undergraduate majors and 33 minors. Wesleyan also has 3-2 engineering partnerships with Marshall University and West Virginia University. Undergraduate degrees are awarded in Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Science in Nursing, and Bachelor of Music Education. Graduate degrees awarded include the Master of Science in Athletic Training, Master of Business Administration, Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing, Master of Science in Nursing and Master of Clinical Mental Health Counseling

Approximately 80% of West Virginia Wesleyan&#x27;s faculty have earned doctorates or comparable terminal degrees within their field. The student-faculty ratio is 11.6 to 1, with an average class size of 15.

==Campus==


The campus boasts 23 major buildings of Georgian architecture. The grounds are situated in a park-like setting of more than 100 acres.

==Student life==
Wesleyan has retained its residential character; about 90% of the students live on campus.

There are 21 NCAA Division II sports teams, and 70 clubs and organizations.

The college&#x27;s athletics teams are the Bobcats, which compete in the NCAA Division II Mountain East Conference, of which it was a founding member in 2013. The Bobcats were former members of the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WVIAC), having been recognized as having the top athletic program in the WVIAC.by winning, over 151 conference championships and earning a conference dominance of 18 Commissioner&#x27;s Cups during the past 20 years and eight Presidents&#x27; Cups in 14 years. Each year, Wesleyan&#x27;s 21 NCAA II teams successfully compete at the regional and national levels.

The Greek system was initiated on campus in 1925, and many fraternities and sororities have been founded since. 

Some Wesleyan students participate in community service through the Center for Community Engagement and Leadership Development (CCE). Students in the CCE also organized the first collegiate Jump Rope for Heart events in the United States.

== Wesleyan traditions ==

===Athletics===

The college currently boasts 21 sports, competing in NCAA Division II. The college offers varsity men&#x27;s sports in baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming, tennis, indoor track and field and outdoor track and field. The college offers varsity women&#x27;s sports in basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, indoor track and field, outdoor track and field and volleyball. The 21st varsity sport, women&#x27;s lacrosse, formally began competition in the fall of 2010.

<text>Santos Alomar Conde (; ; born October 19, 1943), known as Sandy Alomar Sr., is a Puerto Rican former second baseman who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for fourteen seasons. Alomar was a switch-hitter and threw right-handed. He is the father of former Major League catcher and current Cleveland Guardians coach Sandy Alomar Jr. and Hall of Fame second baseman Roberto Alomar.

==Career==
Throughout his career, Alomar was a valuable defensive player. His range and defensive positions were excellent but he was prone to poor throws after making fantastic stops. Alomar was able to play all infield and outfield positions. He led league second basemen in fielding percentage in 1975. Alomar&#x27;s offense was below-average with a .245 career batting average, 13 home runs and 282 RBI in 1,481 games played. He was, however, a great bunter and gathered a significant number of bunt singles in his career.

Alomar enjoyed his best season in with career highs in batting average (.260), home runs (4), runs (82), hits (179) and games played (162), and received an All-Star berth. Alomar was a smart and aggressive base-runner compiling 227 stolen bases including a career-high 39 in 1971.

A durable player, Alomar was the Angels&#x27; everyday second baseman for five years. He twice played a full 162-game season and played in 648 consecutive games between 1969 and 1973.

The only postseason at bat of Alomar&#x27;s career came with the Yankees, during the 1976 American League Championship Series; he was standing on-deck when Chris Chambliss hit the series-winning home run in Game 5.

After retiring, Alomar became a manager both in his homeland and minor leagues, and coached in the majors for the Chicago Cubs, Colorado Rockies and San Diego Padres. While in San Diego, Alomar coached his two sons, Sandy Jr. and Roberto. .

After the season, Alomar was hired by the Mets as a bench coach and was moved to first base coach after the season. In 2007, he was moved to third base coach. On June 17, 2008, he was once again made bench coach of the Mets by former bench coach and recently promoted manager Jerry Manuel. Following the season, Alomar was let go by the Mets and replaced by Dave Jauss.

<doc id="1281874" wikidata="Q4689365" url="?curid=1281874" title="Afon Tryweryn">
<text>Afon Tryweryn is a river in the north of Wales which starts at Llyn Tryweryn in the Snowdonia National Park and after joins the river Dee at Bala. One of the main tributaries of the Dee, it was dammed in 1965 to form Llyn Celyn. The Tryweryn flooding forcibly removed residents of the village of Capel Celyn despite popular and political opposition in Wales. The resulting graffiti &quot;Cofiwch Dryweryn&quot; (&quot;Remember Tryweryn&quot;) near Llanrhystud became and remains a popular icon of Welsh feeling. Water is stored in Llyn Celyn in winter when flows are high, and released over the summer to maintain the flow in the Dee (water from the Dee is used as the water supply for large areas of north-east Wales, and for the Wirral and much of Liverpool in England).

==Whitewater sports==
Afon Tryweryn joins the River Dee roughly half a mile downstream from Bala Lake.
The reservoir now at the head of Afon Tryweryn was created in 1965, to provide water to Liverpool. At that time, the 67 inhabitants of the village of Capel Celyn were forcibly removed.

Afon Tryweryn is the site of the Welsh Canolfan Tryweryn national whitewater centre, managed by the Welsh Canoe Association. It is an important river for whitewater kayaking and rafting. The centre features a café and facilities to support whitewater sports. The natural whitewater rapids of the upper section of Afon Tryweryn have been modified (by placing boulders along the river bed) to make them safer and to build playspots. The upper part of the river is usually considered to be Grade III. Usually between 9 and 12 m³/s are released from the Llyn Celyn Dam. The rapids of the lower section remain in a more natural state. These are of somewhat easier grade, with the exception of Bala Mill Falls.

The regular releases from Llyn Celyn in summer mean that kayak events and trips can be planned in advance, and commercial rafting can take place. Most whitewater rivers in Wales rely on recent rain to have enough water for kayaking or rafting.

Access to the upper part of Afon Tryweryn is uncontroversial - this contrasts with recreational access to many of the other rivers in Wales (see Rivers Access Campaign for more information), and adds to the popularity of Afon Tryweryn among kayakers and rafters.

In August 2004, John Prescott, deputy prime minister, was on a rafting trip on Afon Tryweryn and helped to aid a kayaker who had been injured.

<text>Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi, Lord Madraiwiwi Tangatatonga (10 November 1957 – 29 September 2016) was a prominent Fijian lawyer, legal scholar, jurist, and politician. He served as vice-president, and also acting president, of Fiji, and Chief Justice of Nauru.

&quot;Ratu&quot; Madraiwiwi was ceremonially sworn in as vice-president on 10 January 2005, following his nomination by President &quot;Ratu&quot; Josefa Iloilo, and his subsequent approval by the Great Council of Chiefs on 14 December 2004. He served as vice-president beginning 14 December 2004 to complete the unexpired term of his predecessor, Ratu Jope Seniloli, who had resigned in disgrace on 29 November 2004 in the wake of his convictions for treason concerning his role in the Fiji coup of 2000. Madraiwiwi&#x27;s first priority was to restore dignity and respect to the vice-presidency. However, on 5 December 2006, Madraiwiwi was informed of pending abolition of the vice-presidency, to take effect officially on 15 January 2007, by the Military Commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, who had seized power in a military coup. He was forcibly evicted from his official residence and his office on the night of 6 December. Yet, Madraiwiwi announced in the second week of January 2007 that he was merely &quot;on leave&quot; as Vice-President of Fiji and intended in the meantime to resume private practice as an attorney at Howards law firm.

In 2010, Madraiwiwi was presented with a Tongan life peerage and the title of Lord Madraiwiwi Tangatatonga by King George Tupou V of Tonga. Owing to his Fijian and Nauruan nationalities, he was nominated as early as 2013, and subsequently appointed in 2014, to the Supreme Court of the Republic of Nauru as its Chief Justice, the highest position in that country&#x27;s judicial system, which he held until his death on 29 September 2016.

A lifelong legal scholar, Madraiwiwi was a prolific writer and public speaker who authored several articles and books, including &quot;A Personal Perspective&quot;, his last book.

== Career ==

Descended from a long line of Fijian royal hereditary rulers, &quot;Ratu&quot; Madraiwiwi was the eldest son of Bau chief &quot;Ratu&quot; Jione Atonio Rabici Doviverata and Fijian Member of Parliament &quot;Adi&quot; Losalini Raravuya Uluiviti, and was the namesake of his paternal grandfather, Joni Madraiwiwi I, a Fijian Ratu and early colonial administrator in what was then the British Crown Colony of Fiji. He was born in Levuka, on the island of Ovalau, and subsequently titled &quot;Turaga na Roko Tui Bau&quot;, a vassal chief to the &quot;Vunivalu&quot; of Bau, Paramount Chief of the Kubuna Confederacy. He obtained a Law degree from the University of Adelaide in Australia, and then left for Montreal, Canada for graduate study in Law at McGill University. For his Master of Laws (LL.M.) degree which he obtained in 1989 at the McGill University Faculty of Law, he chose to specialize in comparative law. His LL.M. thesis on air and space law was titled &quot;The archipelagic regime under the United Nations convention of the Law of the Sea 1982 : its development and effect on air law&quot; He also pursued and obtained a Diploma in Air and Space Law (DipA&amp;SL) from the Institute of Air and Space Law at McGill University a year earlier in 1988.

From McGill, Madraiwiwi came back to Fiji and worked for the Office of the Attorney-General of Fiji as solicitor, serving from 1983 to 1991. He was then appointed a permanent arbitrator in that office until 1997, when he became a judge of the High Court, which stands at the apex of the Fijian judiciary. He resigned from the bench in mid-2000 in protest against the coup d&#x27;état that saw the elected government toppled, the constitution abrogated, and the judiciary reorganised by decree. Thereafter, he practised law privately as a partner of Howards. In addition, he served as director of Fiji Times Limited (the nation&#x27;s leading newspaper) and trustee of the Fijian Trust Fund. He was also a human rights commissioner and former chairman of the Citizens Constitutional Forum, a pro-democracy and human rights organisation.

In 2004, he was installed as Vice-President of Fiji. Rewa high chief Ro Jone Mataitini said the chiefs unanimously supported Ratu Madraiwiwi Vice-Presidential appointment because of his extensive knowledge of the law and because of his great rapport with other racial and religious groups. In this regard, he was regarded as a compromise between those who insisted on reserving the Vice-Presidency for a high chief, and those (including Ratu Epeli Ganilau, the former Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs), who believed it was time for a non-Fijian, to be appointed to the post as a gesture of goodwill to the Indo-Fijian and other minorities. Fiji Labour Party leader and former prime minister Mahendra Chaudhry also welcomed Ratu Madraiwiwi&#x27;s appointment. &quot;Ratu Joni is an eminent scholar who served Fiji with distinction in the last 20 years holding high offices. He is fully conversant with the affairs of the State and he will certainly restore dignity and decorum to the high office,&quot; Chaudhry said. Tribal and regional factors played a part in the appointment. Fiji&#x27;s tribes each belong to one of three confederacies – Kubuna, Burebasaga, and Tovata. One member of the Great Council of Chiefs explained to the media that they had understood that as President Iloilo is from Burebasaga and his predecessor, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara was from Tovata, the current vice-president should be from Kubuna. Installed as the Roko Tui Bau on 11 November 1995, Ratu Madraiwiwi is one of the highest chiefs of the Kubuna Confederacy.

The Constitution of Fiji assigns a purely ceremonial role to the vice-president, apart from the power to exercise the functions of the Presidency should the President be unable to perform his duties. With the 84-year-old President Iloilo suffering from ill health, the appointment to the Vice-Presidency of a respected individual who could assume the Presidency in the event of an emergency was regarded as a priority. Madraiwiwi, in fact, was acting President of Fiji in the absence of Iloilo in 2005 and 2006.

== Career after the Vice-Presidency ==

In 2008, when a Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established in the Solomon Islands, in the aftermath of ethnic conflict, it was to have five commissioners, including two foreign nationals. Madraiwiwi was asked, and accepted, to serve as one of the two foreign commissioners. The Commission noted that he brought &quot;strong international human rights experience to the TRC&quot;.

In January 2010, King George Tupou V elevated him to the Life Peerage in the Kingdom of Tonga, with the title of Lord Madraiwiwi Tangatatonga.
Ratu Joni became the Chief Justice of Nauru following the resignation of former Chief Justice, Geoffrey Eames QC. He died in service as Supreme Court Chief Justice of Nauru.

== Opinions ==

Madraiwiwi is noted for his outspoken calls for political and cultural moderation, and for his efforts to encourage people to come up with creative and practical solutions to issues that have caused tension in Fijian society.

=== Ethnic tensions and human rights ===

Madraiwiwi says that ethnic Fijians really have nothing to fear from the large Indo-Fijian population, as native ownership of most of the land is enshrined in the Constitution. Madraiwiwi has called for a national discussion on adopting an inclusive label for all Fijian citizens. He pointed out that the &quot;Fijian&quot; label is very often taken to mean the Fijian ethnic group, rather than the citizenry as a whole. &quot;While I personally have no problem with the term Fijian, I recognise many others in my community are not,&quot; he said in a speech to the Lautoka Rotary Club on 14 March 2005. &quot;But let us not leave it there. Let us find other options,&quot; he proposed.

Addressing the Fiji Law Society convention at Warwick Hotel on Fiji&#x27;s Coral Coast on 2 July 2005, Madraiwiwi said that the feeling of insecurity felt by many indigenous Fijians would disappear when more of them became better educated. He said that most members of his ethnic community did not trust the Constitution or the rule of law sufficiently, as both instruments could be impugned by whatever government was in power – an attitude that needed to be changed. His people needed to understand, he said, that the rule of law was not an alien Western concept, but one that was, in fact, rooted as much in Fijian as in Western traditions.

At an education workshop in Suva on 13 July, Madraiwiwi said it was a mistake to view indigenous rights as superior to human rights in general. He said that the ILO Convention 169 (the Convention concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries) clearly stated that indigenous rights were not separate from human rights and could not be asserted at their expense. Articles referring to a self-contained system of governance for indigenous peoples were, he said, for traditional and cultural matters, and did &quot;not legitimise or authorise indigenous supremacy.&quot;

Madraiwiwi also rejected arguments by some politicians that when the United Kingdom granted independence to Fiji in 1970, they should have handed power back to the chiefs, calling this position legally untenable. &quot;To say that power should have been returned to the Fijian chiefs is to ignore what occurred between 1874 and 1970,&quot; Madraiwiwi said. He said there was a legal continuity from the chiefs, through British colonial rule, to the modern Fijian state. Universal rules, he said, required Fijians to temper their indigenous rights with the fundamental human rights enjoyed by other communities, though he admitted that many found that difficult to accept. &quot;It is an unpalatable truth for Fijians because it flies in the face of everything they have been brought up to believe and conditioned to accept,&quot; he said. Madraiwiwi said tensions often arose because fundamental rights were collective, while indigenous rights were individual in character.

He reiterated this position in his closing address to the Roundtable on Human Rights, Indigenous Rights, and Nationalism, organised by the Fiji Human Rights Commission at Suva&#x27;s Holiday Inn on 23 July. He insisted that indigenous rights and fundamental rights are mutually dependent and neither can exist without the other.

In a message to cadets at Xavier College in Ba on 27 July, Madraiwiwi said that the cycle of blame trapped Fiji islanders into racially polarised politics. He said that Fiji was the richer for its ethnic and cultural diversity, and commended the cadet corps for having overcome ethnic divisions to operate as a cohesive whole.

=== Relationship between church and state ===

In the same Lautoka speech, Madraiwiwi opposed calls for the establishment of a Christian state in Fiji, saying that it would hinder a &quot;correct relationship&quot; between the overwhelmingly Christian ethnic Fijians and the mainly Hindu and Muslim Indo-Fijian community. He expressed concern that the growth of newer fundamentalist denominations at the expense of the long-dominant Methodist Church &quot;evoked a less tolerant dimension to the work of some Christian churches.&quot; Madraiwiwi has since reiterated that proposals to establish a Christian state ignore the potential for division and conflict. Speaking at the &quot;Religion and Governance Forum&quot; in Suva on 17 May 2005, he said the proposal had its roots in the initial conversion of chiefs to Christianity and in the Deed of Cession, in which the chiefs ceded sovereignty to the United Kingdom in 1874, but considered that in a multi-faith country like Fiji, it would not be wise to establish any one faith. In an earlier address to a Hindu gathering on 28 March, Madraiwiwi had criticised government politicians for couching pronouncements in purely Christian terms. &quot;When national leaders address the people of Fiji in specifically Christian terms, whatever the occasion, nearly half of our people are excluded,&quot; he said. &quot;When prayer in mixed company is uttered in terms of a purely Christian God, we unintentionally omit and diminish others present of different faiths. When we use Christian symbolism to promote reconciliation, forgiveness and unity, we discount the contribution and equally rich traditions extant in other faiths and cultural traditions.&quot;

Madraiwiwi has also said that churches have failed to do enough to confront serious social problems, including rape, incest, and other violent crimes, and has called on Christian leaders to set an example for the people to follow by practising what they preach. Speaking in the Lau Islands on 12 May 2005, he pointed to the late Lauan chief and former Fijian President, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, as a one &quot;who not only went to church but lived the life of a Christian,&quot; and called on religious leaders to do likewise. Later, speaking at the Religion and Governance Forum in Suva on 18 May, he said that there have been cases of churches making unreasonable demands on parishioners in terms of time and natural resources, which have led to &quot;a significant erosion on family values&quot;. He also called on churches to address the problem of excessive yaqona drinking, which he said was a major social problem. He expressed concern that the Methodist Church, to which approximately two-thirds of indigenous Fijians belong, had not addressed these issues at their recent conference, but conceded that as Fijian cultural conditioning aims for consensus rather than frank debates, raising such matters could cause divisions.

On 13 May 2005, Roman Catholic Archbishop Petero Mataca said he agreed that churches had a role to play in reducing crime, but said that they should not be seen as solely to blame for the problem.

=== Views on Fiji&#x27;s chiefly system ===

Madraiwiwi has also spoken of the need for chiefs to be accessible to their people and to listen to them. &quot;It will be impossible to achieve this if the elders and chiefs have their own way and are too proud of their chiefly status to not bring themselves down to the people,&quot; Madraiwiwi told the Lau Provincial Council on 11 May 2005.

In an address to the Pacific Regional Workshop on Leadership Development in Lami on 9 July, Madraiwiwi said that the chiefly system in Fiji and other Pacific Island nations would have to adapt to modern realities. Traditional leadership remained significant, he said, but its role was diminishing. He said that British colonisation had reinforced the chiefly system and in fact fossilised it. Historically, there had been some flexibility, as chiefs had to earn their positions through military prowess, but British protection had given the chiefs an unprecedented &quot;reach and depth&quot;, he said. Christianity, too, had buttressed the system. The church and the chiefly system had become intertwined and mutually reinforced each other, not always to society&#x27;s benefit. The changing realities of the modern world, however, meant that traditional leaders would have to share the leadership of the country with others. He also said that chiefs and church leaders would have to recognise that tradition did not always sit easily with human rights, and that sensitivity was needed to defuse the inevitable tension between the church and tradition on one hand and human rights on the other.

At the Fiji Medical Association conference on 1 September, Madraiwiwi said that the days when chiefs, religious ministers, and state officials expected to be treated with deference were gone, and he welcomed the change. He also called on doctors to adopt a higher public profile, as by virtue of their training, skills, and income level, they held a position that required them to provide leadership to the community. &quot;The world outside medicine is yours as well,&quot; he said. &quot;Remedying ailments and illness is not the sum total of your existence. You are also citizens of this country and need to be seen in that role.&quot;

Madraiwiwi has also maintained that democracy has not yet completely settled down in Fiji. Opening the conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in Nadi on 6 September 2005, he said that Fiji had yet to fully recognise and appreciate the concepts of human rights and the rule of law. Despite constitutional guarantees, certain aspects of democracy were somewhat tenuous, he considered. Ethnic tensions exacerbated the problem, he said. Indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians had competing priorities that would need to be addressed in a manner fair to all, he said. &quot;All our communities have to make the effort to reach out to each other rather than waiting passively for gestures that may never be made,&quot; Madraiwiwi declared. He added a note of caution, however: &quot;Social integration cannot be forced and not proceed at the pace that the community considers uncomfortable.&quot; He was optimistic about the overall state of race relations, but thought that more needed to be done: &quot;Relationships between our ethnic communities are generally good but we need to continue weaving connections to the point where they are interwoven and unbreakable,&quot; he said.

In the same speech, Madraiwiwi praised the Commonwealth of Nations. &quot;The strength of Commonwealth lies in its diversity and it to be mindful of bearing economic, social, political and cultural systems which comprise its membership,&quot; he said. &quot;&#x27;Its commonality lies in its connection to humanity, in the main it has provided an invariable forum whose members to open and continue meaningful issues of concern.&quot;&quot;

=== Economic and environmental views ===

On 7 July 2005, Madraiwiwi called on his fellow-chiefs to consider how to maximise the effectiveness of income generated through tourist facilities built on natively owned land. Opening the Tourism Forum at the Sheraton Resort, he said that the annual profit, now more than F$30 million, should be invested to spearhead native Fijian participation in the industry. He also called on leaders to take a more &quot;bipartisan&quot; approach to national issues, saying that as a small country with limited resources, Fiji could ill afford &quot;endless debates about ethnicity and identity.&quot; He spoke of the need to break new ground. &quot;We need to move forward and beyond the point where we endlessly pursue the demons bequeathed us by our history,&quot; Madraiwiwi said.

Addressing a Greenpeace meeting in Suva on 10 July to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the bombing of the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; by French DGSE agents in 1985, Madraiwiwi said that while nuclear testing, the issue at the time of the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot;&#x27;s destruction, was a thing of the past, the region was still faced with major environmental challenges. &quot;Back then the issue of the day was nuclear testing, now we are faced with problems such as climate change, overfishing, deforestation, shipments of radioactive materials through Pacific waters and nuclear proliferation,&quot; he said. &quot;We need to remain vigilant so that we won&#x27;t become victims again.&quot; A former Greenpeace board member, Madraiwiwi called on the environmental lobby to remember that &quot;the actions of a few with commitment, can alter the course of world history.&quot;

The vice-president has also called for a crusade against corruption, and for streamlining of the Public Service Commission&#x27;s disciplinary laws to prevent delays in fighting corruption, which only foster further abuse. &quot;Combating it will take courage, determination and perseverance. The most effective means of doing it is by creating a climate not receptive to corruption,&quot; Madraiwiwi said at the launch of the Transparency International Fiji book in Suva on 9 December 2005.

=== Views on homosexuality ===

On 31 August 2005, Madraiwiwi became the first high-ranking office-holder in Fiji to call for homosexuality to be legalised. Speaking at the opening of the Fiji Medical Association conference in Suva, he said that while he acknowledged the abhorrence of many great religions towards homosexuality, he thought that what sexual acts people do in private is no business of the state. &quot;Whatever one&#x27;s views about it, those who choose to practise that lifestyle in private surely have a right to do so,&quot; he said. Madraiwiwi&#x27;s comments flew in the face of pressure from the Methodist and other churches, as well as some Hindu and Muslim organisations, to close the loopholes in the law which allowed a Fijian citizen and a foreigner who had been convicted of homosexual acts to walk free in late August. Madraiwiwi&#x27;s endorsement of legalised homosexuality also ran contrary to assertions from Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase that so long as he remained in office, homosexuality would remain illegal.

=== Views on Fiji&#x27;s national identity ===

Speaking at the launch of Fiji Week celebrations on 7 October 2005, Madraiwiwi called on the nation to face up to questions about its fundamental identity. Such issues involved finding an inclusive adjective of nationality, the term &quot;Fijian&quot; being widely thought of as an ethnic term and its use by non-indigenous persons sometimes resented. The choice of a national language, and the question about whether to keep or change the flag, should also be addressed, he said. It would not do any good to avoid facing such questions, he said, because resolving them was essential to fostering true reconciliation and unity in the nation.

=== Poppy Drive speech ===

At the launch of the Poppy Drive on 21 October, Madraiwiwi called on returned servicemen to lay aside old resentments. The general refusal of Indo-Fijians to contribute to the war effort in World War II caused widespread resentment among indigenous Fijians, which has not entirely abated. Madraiwiwi considered, however, that they had shown bravery in their own way, enduring mistreatment &quot;with fortitude and grace&quot; at the hands of their colonial masters, to whom &quot;they had little reason to be grateful.&quot; He also challenged people to consider the question of how the economy could have survived had the Indo-Fijians left Fiji for the war. &quot;Who would have planted the cane, run the mills and funded the colony if they had gone to battle?&quot; he asked.

In the same address, the vice-president said that only those who had experienced the horrors of war could truly appreciate the value of freedom. A generation had grown up taking freedom for granted, he said, but owed a debt of gratitude that could never be repaid to those who had paid the price with their blood. He also said that people have become bolder in asserting their rights, but cautioned that that is one of the causes of wars.

=== Thoughts on the Fijian electoral system ===

* &quot;See main articles: Electoral system of Fiji; Voting system of Fiji.&quot;

On 3 November 2005, Madraiwiwi expressed reservations about the so-called Alternative Vote, which incorporates elements of instant run-off voting and electoral fusion, which has been used in Fiji for the past two elections. The system allows political parties and candidates to combine their votes in a constituency according to a prearranged ranking of &quot;preferences.&quot; Although voters may customise the ranking, few did so at the last two elections, and many were reportedly unaware that a vote cast for the party of their choice might end up being transferred to a party they might have no wish to support. Madraiwiwi said that in practice, voting for a party meant voting for any other party to which that party had agreed to transfer its &quot;preferences.&quot; He considered that this compromised the voter&#x27;s freedom of choice, and that in retrospect, it might have been better to retain the first past the post system that was formerly used.

At a workshop organised by the Citizens Constitutional Forum in Suva, Madraiwiwi endorsed calls for electoral reform on 9 February 2006. Madraiwiwi, who was the chief guest at the forum, called for a reduction in the number of communal constituencies (elected on ethnic rolls, almost two-thirds of the present House of Representatives) and a corresponding increase in the number of open constituencies (elected by universal suffrage). Communal voting reinforced the ethnic faultline that characterised elections in Fiji, he said, and steps should be taken to move away from it.

The vice-president also reiterated his earlier reservations about the Fijian electoral system. It was not well understood by less literate sections of the population, he said, and though its purpose was to encourage coalition-building, it was open to manipulation and a simpler voting system, which would be fair and neutral, should be considered, the Fiji Live and Fiji Village news services reported him as saying. He proposed proportional representation for as an option which would reflect the composition of the Fijian electorate. The constitutional requirement for multi-party coalitions, which has never been implemented strictly as stipulated, should also be reconsidered, he said.

In a rare display of unity, both Tomasi Vakatora of the predominantly indigenous Grand Coalition Initiative Group and Krishna Datt of the mainly Indo-Fijian Fiji Labour Party both rejected the Vice-President&#x27;s calls for proportional representation, saying they were satisfied with the present electoral system.

Madraiwiwi also expressed concern about how the high level of Indo-Fijian emigration could create electoral disparity, affecting the election results in marginal open constituencies.

=== Critique of ethnic politics ===

In his opening address to the Pacific Islands Political Studies Association (PIPSA) conference on 24 November 2005, Madraiwiwi described race relations as &quot;a work in progress.&quot; He lamented the ethnic faultline that defines Fijian politics, a situation reinforced, he said, by what political parties thought the electorate wanted. The electoral system, in which almost two-thirds of the seats in the House of Representatives are chosen by voters registered on closed ethnic rolls, further reinforced this divide, he maintained. The result was that people retreated into their &quot;ethnic fortresses&quot; and viewed one another with suspicion.

Madraiwiwi spoke of the need to build personal relationships on the basis of trust, across ethnic lines. &quot;We must begin to trust each other if this country is to progress the way we want it to. But before that we have to lay the preparatory work to engender that trust by building relationships every day,&quot; he declared.

One factor gave the vice-president cause for optimism. The indigenous population was growing somewhat faster than that of the nation as a whole, which he thought would gradually allay their fears of marginalisation and could lead to their being less fearful about being led by someone of a different ethnic group.

=== Views on the place of the Fijian language ===

* &quot;See main article: National language debate in Fiji.&quot;

Addressing the 72nd annual meeting of the Fijian Teachers Association in Suva on 9 January 2006, Madraiwiwi added his own voice to calls for the Fijian language to be made a compulsory subject in all primary schools. His parents&#x27; generation had emphasised prioritising English on the assumption that Fijian could be learned later, but this had resulted in a generation knowing little Fijian, and unless the language was made compulsory at all levels of primary education, it would be lost to the next generation, Madraiwiwi said.

== Achievements ==

In his capacity of Acting President of Fiji, Madraiwiwi succeeded in brokering a truce on 16 January 2006 between Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase and Military Commander Commodore Frank Bainimarama, whose long-running feud had raised fears of civil unrest or a military coup. Under Madraiwiwi&#x27;s mediation, each side made some concessions to the other, and observers were cautiously optimistic that Fiji had been pulled back from the brink. Although the truce eventually broke down, it postponed the coup that eventually took place on 5 December.

== Personal life ==

Ratu Madraiwiwi is the eldest son of Doctor Ratu Jione Atonio Rabici Doviverata, who preceded him as Roko Tui Bau in 1995. His mother, Adi Losalini Raravuya Uluiviti was from the chiefly Tui Nairai family, in Fiji&#x27;s Lomaiviti province. She was one of the first women to become a member of Fiji&#x27;s Legislative Council and subsequently a Member of Parliament.

Ratu Madraiwiwi is a grandson of Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi (1859–1920), a Bauan chief, and a great-great-grandson of Ratu Seru Epenisa Cakobau (1815–1883), the Fijian monarch who unified the nation under his leadership before ceding the islands to the United Kingdom in 1874. He is also a nephew of Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna (1888–1958), who forged embryonic institutions for what would become the independent nation of Fiji, although he did not live to see it. On 5 December 1998, he married Adi Lusi Tuivanuavou, also known as Adi Lusiana Paluvavau Qolikoro, on Bau Island in Fiji.

Madraiwiwi died on 29 September 2016 after a short illness. He was later laid to rest at the Sau Tabu in Bau Island on 7 October 2016 a week after his death. His death was attended by The King of Tonga King Tupou VI and other Chiefly families around Fiji.

<doc id="1281891" wikidata="Q173380" url="?curid=1281891" title="Adrian Newey">
<text>Adrian Martin Newey (born 26 December 1958) is a British engineer, aerodynamicist, automotive designer and motorsport executive. From 2025 onwards, Newey is set to serve as technical director and co-owner of Aston Martin in Formula One; he previously served as technical director of Leyton House and McLaren, chief designer of March and Williams, and CTO of Red Bull Racing. Widely regarded as one of the greatest engineers in Formula One history, Newey&#x27;s designs have won 12 World Constructors&#x27; Championship titles and Grands Prix between and .

After designing championship-winning Formula One cars for Williams and McLaren, Newey moved to Red Bull Racing in 2006, his cars winning the Formula One drivers&#x27; and constructors&#x27; championships consecutively from 2010 to 2013, the drivers&#x27; championship in 2021, and both championships in 2022 and 2023. The Newey-designed RB19 is the most successful Formula One car in history, winning 21 out of the 22 races (95.45%) in which it competed. Newey&#x27;s designs also won the 1985 and 1986 CART titles. On 1 May 2024, Red Bull Racing announced that Newey would leave his day-to-day Formula One design duties immediately and shift his focus to the RB17 hypercar (2025). He is set to fully leave the company in the first quarter of 2025.

== Early life and career ==
Adrian Martin Newey was born in Colchester, Essex, England, on 26 December 1958, the son of Richard and Edwina Newey. His father was a veterinarian and his mother was an ambulance driver during the Second World War. He attended Repton public school alongside motoring journalist and writer Jeremy Clarkson. Newey was asked to leave Repton at the age of 16 after an incident at a Greenslade concert at Repton&#x27;s 19th-century Pears School Building organised by the school&#x27;s sixth formers, where he pushed up the sound levels on the band&#x27;s mixer, cracking the building&#x27;s stained glass windows. Newey gained a first class honours degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the University of Southampton in 1980. Immediately after graduation he began working in motorsport for the Fittipaldi Formula One team under Harvey Postlethwaite. In 1981, he joined the March team. After a period as a race engineer for Johnny Cecotto in European Formula 2, Newey began designing racing cars. His first project, the March GTP sports car, was a highly successful design and won the IMSA GTP title two years running.

== CART career ==
In 1984, Newey moved to the March Indy car project, working as designer and race engineer for Bobby Rahal at Truesports. Newey formed a close friendship with Rahal, which would impact their careers some fifteen years later. Newey&#x27;s March 85C design won the 1985 CART championship in the hands of Al Unser, and the 1985 Indianapolis 500 with Danny Sullivan. In 1986 Newey moved to Kraco to engineer Michael Andretti&#x27;s car, while his March 86C design won the CART title and 1986 Indianapolis 500 with Bobby Rahal.

At the end of 1986 Newey joined the Haas Lola F1 team in an effort to improve its fortunes, but the team withdrew at the conclusion of the 1986 season. After a spell at Newman-Haas in 1987 working as Mario Andretti&#x27;s race engineer, Newey was re-hired by March, this time to work in Formula One as chief designer.

== Formula One career ==
=== March/Leyton House (1988–1990) ===

Newey&#x27;s first F1 design, the March 881, was far more competitive than many expected, with Ivan Capelli finishing second in Portugal, and even passing Alain Prost&#x27;s McLaren-Honda turbo for the lead of the Japanese Grand Prix briefly on lap 16.

As March became Leyton House Racing in , Newey gained promotion to the role of technical director. In France Capelli led the most part of the race and finished second after a late pass by Prost&#x27;s Ferrari, but that proved to be the year&#x27;s bright spot, with the team&#x27;s results declining. In the summer of 1990, Newey was fired, although he soon found another role. Newey later said: &quot;I was fired but I&#x27;d already made up my mind I was going – because once a team gets run by an accountant, it&#x27;s time to move. Your self-confidence does suffer but Williams had approached me.&quot;

=== Williams (1991–1996) ===

Through the 1980s and into the 1990s, Williams F1 was a top running team, and technical director Patrick Head wasted no time in getting a contract signed. With a vastly superior budget, drivers and resources at his disposal, Newey and Head rapidly became the dominant design partnership of the early 1990s. By mid-season 1991, Newey&#x27;s FW14 chassis was every bit a match for the previously dominant McLaren, but early season reliability issues and the efforts of Ayrton Senna prevented Williams team leader Nigel Mansell from taking the title.

In 1992, there would be no problems, and with dominance of the sport not repeated until the Ferrari/Schumacher era, Mansell took the drivers&#x27; crown and Newey secured his first constructors&#x27; title. 1993 delivered a second, this time with Alain Prost at the wheel of the FW15C.

1994 saw a rare dip in performance for Newey-designed cars and the team and drivers struggled to match the Rory Byrne-designed Benetton B194 for pace and reliability. Disaster struck at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix with the death of Ayrton Senna who had joined Williams that year. A late-season charge, helped by a two-race ban for Schumacher, enabled Williams to claim their third straight constructors&#x27; championship. However, Williams were unable to take a third consecutive drivers&#x27; title, and with possible manslaughter charges for Senna&#x27;s accident in prospect, cracks began to show in Newey&#x27;s relationship with Williams team management.

By 1995, it was clear that Newey was once more ready to become technical director of a team, but with Head a share-holding founder of Williams, he found his way blocked. Loss of both drivers&#x27; and constructors&#x27; titles to Benetton in 1995 saw further distance put between Newey and Williams, and by the time Damon Hill and Jacques Villeneuve secured both titles in 1996 Newey had been placed on gardening leave prior to joining McLaren.

His career at Williams ended with his cars winning 59 race victories, 78 pole positions and 60 fastest laps all from 114 races from 1991 till 1997. These seven years saw four drivers clinch world championship titles.

=== McLaren (1997–2005) ===
Unable to influence the design of the 1997 McLaren, Newey was forced to attempt to improve on the Neil Oatley design while concentrating his efforts on the 1998 car. A win at the 1997 European Grand Prix saw McLaren enter the off-season on a high, and when the racing resumed four months later the McLaren MP4/13 was the car to beat. Titles followed in 1998 and 1999, and Mika Häkkinen narrowly missed out on a third drivers&#x27; title in 2000.

In the spring of 2001, Newey signed a contract with the Jaguar F1 team managed by Newey&#x27;s friend and former CART colleague Bobby Rahal. Despite having a signed contract, Rahal was unable to complete the deal when McLaren boss Ron Dennis persuaded Newey to stay. Newey and Rahal later stated that the deal failed due to Rahal&#x27;s position within Jaguar being undermined by Niki Lauda and internal politics at Ford. Rahal was fired from the team several months later.

Despite remaining with McLaren, rumours persisted that Newey wanted to leave the team, and by late 2004 his future began to look uncertain when speculation began that the engineer could return to Williams or even leave the sport completely. Despite strenuous denials from Ron Dennis stories continued to circulate during the 2004/2005 off-season that Newey&#x27;s departure was imminent. In April 2005, it was confirmed that his contract with the team had been extended by six months to the end of the year at which point he was expected to take a sabbatical or retire from Formula One design completely, but on 19 July instead he stated that &quot;this step can wait&quot; and he would remain with McLaren for the year 2006.

=== Red Bull (2006–2024) ===


Despite those assurances, Red Bull Racing announced on 8 November 2005 that Newey would join the team from February 2006. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Newey would be getting around $10 million a year at Red Bull Racing after McLaren baulked at increasing his salary in contract renewal negotiations.

Newey could hardly influence the design of the 2006 car and Red Bull&#x27;s season started with poor results, having scored only two points from six races. However, the team&#x27;s lead driver, David Coulthard, who had driven Newey-designed cars for years for both Williams and McLaren, managed to secure third place and six points in the Monaco Grand Prix. Although assisted by retirements of other competitors, indications were that the team was eventually beginning to pick up where it left off in 2005 when they finished a close seventh overall. The 2007 Red Bull of his design was powered by the Renault RS26 engine as the Ferrari 056 contract was transferred to Scuderia Toro Rosso, Red Bull Racing&#x27;s &quot;B team&quot;. The car was reasonably fast but rather unreliable, with each driver retiring seven times in a season of 17 races. Nevertheless, with the disqualification of McLaren-Mercedes, Red Bull achieved fifth place in the 2007 Constructors&#x27; Championship as targeted.
Technical directors Adrian Newey and Geoff Willis noted that the 2008 chassis was the most intricate design to have rolled out of their factory. The season started well for the team, with Mark Webber scoring five consecutive points finishes and Coulthard claiming a podium at Montreal. At the half-way mark, Red Bull was in a fierce battle for fourth place in the Constructors Championship, along with Renault and Toyota. However, Red Bull scored just five points in the second half of the season (compared to 24 in the first half) as the team slipped down the grid. Even Toro Rosso managed to outscore them by the end of the season.

The car Newey designed for 2009 represented a large step up in performance for the team, with one–two finishes at Shanghai, in a rain affected race, and at the British Grand Prix, both won by Sebastian Vettel. Webber went on to win in Germany before a hat-trick of wins for the team at the end of the season, including another one–two in Abu Dhabi. Red Bull finished the season a comfortable second in the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

The 2010 Red Bull car (the RB6) started the season well and proved to be the class of the field, winning on circuits requiring strengths in widely differing areas and winning the Constructors&#x27; Championship. It took 15 out of a possible 19 pole positions. At the 2010 Brazilian GP, Red Bull won the 2010 Constructors&#x27; Championship. On 14 November 2010 when Red Bull won the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with Sebastian Vettel, Newey became the only F1 designer to have won Constructors&#x27; Championships with three different F1 teams.

The 2011 RB7 built on the RB6&#x27;s speed and also proved to be reliable, making it the clearly dominant car in the pack. The car took 18 of the 19 pole positions and won 12 races. On 9 October 2011, Red Bull won the World Drivers&#x27; Championship, making Sebastian Vettel the youngest double champion in the history of F1. Red Bull followed up this title with securing the Constructors&#x27; Championship on 16 October at the 2011 Korean Grand Prix.

The following year, despite initial concerns as to the car&#x27;s superiority compared to the McLaren MP4-27 and a stern challenge from Ferrari&#x27;s Fernando Alonso in the inferior F2012, Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel once again claimed the championship at a dramatic 2012 Brazilian Grand Prix.

In 2013, the RB9 along with Sebastian Vettel dominated the field after the summer break to defend both the World Drivers&#x27; and World Constructors&#x27; Championship in style at the 2013 Indian Grand Prix with Vettel scoring a record-breaking 9 consecutive wins from the Belgian Grand Prix till the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix.

On 8 June 2014, Red Bull Racing announced that Newey had extended his contract for the next few seasons, giving Newey a wider responsibility including &quot;new Red Bull Technology projects&quot;. Allegedly, Red Bull fought off a £20m contract offer by Scuderia Ferrari.
After the sport introduced V6 turbo-hybrid power units in 2014, Newey&#x27;s cars were held back by the performance of the Renault power units, but a switch to Honda power in 2019 eventually gave the team a power unit capable of winning a title. Between 2014 and 2020, all of his cars except the RB11 (2015) won at least two Grands Prix, with the RB10, RB12 and RB16 taking second place in the 2014, 2016, 2020 Constructors&#x27; Championships. The 2021 season saw the team return to title contention, with the RB16B design winning the Drivers&#x27; Championship with Max Verstappen. In 2022, the RB18 proved to be a strong contender and gave Verstappen his second Drivers&#x27; Championship at the 2022 Japanese Grand Prix, as well as delivering Red Bull their first Constructors&#x27; Championship since 2013. It was followed by the RB19 which would end up being one of the most dominant F1 cars in history, with a win rate of 95.45% beating the previous record of 93.8% set by the McLaren MP4/4 from 1988.

At the 2023 Canadian Grand Prix, Verstappen took Red Bull&#x27;s 100th win, which also marked Newey&#x27;s 200th win in Formula One. Later that year, Red Bull broke McLaren&#x27;s legendary record of 11 consecutives victories by winning the Hungarian Grand Prix, while in Italy, Verstappen broke Vettel&#x27;s historic 9 consecutive wins. This win was also the 15th in a row for Red Bull Racing, setting two new records.

On 25 April 2024, motorsport media outlets began reporting Newey having interest in leaving Red Bull Racing. Red Bull Racing responded to the reports via a spokesman to PlanetF1.com stating that “Adrian is contracted until at least the end of 2025 ... We are unaware of him joining any other team.” Five days later, it was reported that Newey&#x27;s departure was complete and an official announcement would be issued prior to the 2024 Miami Grand Prix.

Newey is set to leave Red Bull Racing during the first quarter of 2025 and step away from his Formula One duties while still working on their first hypercar on the trackside, the RB17.

=== Aston Martin (2025) ===
Newey signed a contract with Aston Martin, as a shareholder and Managing Technical Partner for the team, he will join the team on 1 March 2025, in time for the regulations.

== Death of Ayrton Senna ==

Following the death of Ayrton Senna at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix in a car that Newey helped to design, Newey was among several members of the Williams team to be charged with manslaughter. In an initial ruling, in December 1997, Newey was acquitted. The acquittal was upheld on appeal in November 1999. In January 2003, the Italian Supreme Court re-opened the case, citing &quot;material errors&quot;; the court gave Newey a full acquittal in May 2005.

== Other ventures ==
Newey is an avid sports car collector and driver, having participated in the Le Mans Legend races for a few years. He destroyed a Ford GT40 while competing in 2006, but escaped with only a cut finger. He later wrecked a Jaguar E-Type at the Goodwood Revival Meeting.

In 2007, he made the move to modern racing, becoming part of the driver line-up in the AF Corse Ferrari F430 for the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Newey and co-drivers Ben Aucott and Joe Macari managed to finish 22nd outright, and fourth in class.

On 15 June 2010, during the Sony E3 Electronic Entertainment Expo press conference, it was revealed that Newey collaborated as the chief technical officer for the video game &quot;Gran Turismo 5&quot; for the PlayStation 3. A game trailer showed Newey along with race car driver Sebastian Vettel at the Red Bull Technology building in Great Britain in discussion with Kazunori Yamauchi, a Japanese game designer who is the CEO of Polyphony Digital and creator and producer of the &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; series. The three&#x27;s collaboration would later lead to the completion of concept cars Red Bull X2010 and Red Bull X2011, which appeared in that game.

On 2 July 2010, Newey was rewarded with his own Red Bull RB5, out of regard for his achievements with Red Bull Racing since he joined the team in 2007. Newey first drove the car up the hill at the 2010 Goodwood Festival of Speed.

On 8 August 2010, Newey was involved in an accident whilst taking part in the Ginetta G50 Cup at the Snetterton circuit as a guest driver. He was spun into the path of Tony Hughes, and his car sustained a heavy side-on impact. He was taken to hospital for precautionary checks, but sustained no serious injuries.

<text>Kathryn Leigh Scott (born January 26, 1943) is an American television and film actress and writer who is best known for playing several roles on &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;.

==Early life and education ==
Kathryn Leigh Scott (born Marlene Kathryn Kringstad) was born in Robbinsdale, Minnesota, of Norwegian descent. She grew up on a farm in Robbinsdale, the daughter of Ole Kringstad, a Norwegian immigrant, and Hilda Karlsgodt Kringstad, of Norwegian descent.

She attended Northwestern University in their summer &quot;cherub&quot; program while in high school. In 1962 she moved to New York to study at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts on a scholarship while working as a Playboy Bunny in the original New York Playboy Club at 59th and Fifth Avenue.

==Career==

Upon graduation from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, Kathryn landed the ingénue lead in the classic Gothic daytime drama Dark Shadows (ABC, 1966-1971), and starred in the 1970 MGM feature &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot; in 1970. Kathryn played four roles in the series: Maggie Evans, Josette du Pres, Lady Kitty Hampshire and Rachel Drummond.

In 1971, she moved to Paris, France, with her fiance, Time/Life photojournalist Ben Martin. In Paris, Kathryn played twins in the French language film &quot;L&#x27;alfomega.&quot; After marrying later that year in Vikebukt, Norway, she and her husband moved to London, England, where she continued working as an actress. She appeared in several television films including &quot;Crime of Passion&quot;, &quot;Harriet&#x27;s Back In Town&quot;, &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;, &quot;Marked Personal&quot;, &quot;Come Die With Me&quot;, &quot;Dial M For Murder&quot;, &quot;Space: 1999&quot;, and the miniseries &quot;Late Call&quot;, &quot;Edward The King&quot;, and &quot;The Exiles.&quot; Scott also appeared in the 1980 British television series &quot;Hammer House of Horror&quot; episode, &quot;Visitor From The Grave.&quot; She also appeared in the feature films &quot;Brannigan&quot; with John Wayne; &quot;Providence&quot; with Dirk Bogarde, directed by Alain Resnais; &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow, directed by Jack Clayton; and &quot;The Greek Tycoon&quot; with Anthony Quinn and Jacqueline Bisset. In 1974, she played Nurse Kelly in a six-month run of &quot;Harvey&quot; with James Stewart, directed by Sir Anthony Quayle, at the Prince of Wales Theatre, London. The following year she was in a new play, &quot;Le Weekend&quot;, at the Bristol Old Vic, Bristol, England.

In 1978 Scott moved to Los Angeles to star in the CBS series &quot;Big Shamus, Little Shamus&quot; with Brian Dennehy. She guest-starred in a succession of television series, and then returned to England to film &quot;The Last Days of Patton&quot; with George C. Scott; &quot;Murrow&quot; with Daniel J. Travanti; &quot;Voice of the Heart&quot; with James Brolin; and &quot;Chandlertown&quot; with Powers Boothe.

In 1985, Scott launched Pomegranate Press, Ltd. to publish books about the entertainment industry, including guide books, biographies, textbooks and coffee table art books. She wrote &quot;The Bunny Years&quot; (the 25-year history of Playboy Clubs told through the women who worked as Bunnies), which was sold to Imagine Entertainment&#x27;s Brian Grazer. She also co-produced a two-hour special for the A&amp;E Network, and a one-hour documentary for BBC-1 and Canadian TV, based on the book. Pomegranate has published over 50 nonfiction titles, including Scott&#x27;s books &quot;Lobby Cards: The Classic Films&quot; (Benjamin Franklin Award for Best Coffee TableBook) and &quot;Lobby Cards: The Classic Comedies&quot;, both of which were published in the U.K. by Bloomsbury. She published a trade paperback edition of the hardcover biography &quot;Coya Come Home&quot;, with a foreword by Walter Mondale (2012).

Scott wrote &quot;Dark Shadows Memories&quot;, to coincide with the series&#x27; 20th anniversary, and &quot;Dark Shadows Companion&quot; as a 25th anniversary tribute. She has written three novels -- &quot;Dark Passages&quot; (2012), &quot;Down and Out in Beverly Heels&quot; (2013), and &quot;Jinxed&quot; (2015); a memoir, &quot;Last Dance at the Savoy&quot; (Cumberland Press, 2016); and a trilogy of books on care-giving: &quot;Now With You, Now Without&quot;, &quot;The Happy Hours&quot;, and &quot;A Welcome Respite&quot; (Grand Harbor, 2017).

Scott plays Mamie Eisenhower in the feature film &quot;The Eleventh Green&quot; (2019) with Campbell Scott. She has also recently appeared in &quot;Three Christs&quot; (2018) with Richard Gere and Juliana Margulies, and Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;A Rainy Day in New York&quot; (2018). She appeared in Hallmark Channel&#x27;s &quot;Broadcasting Christmas&quot; (2016) and Lifetime&#x27;s &quot;A Wedding to Die For&quot; (2017), and has a recurring role as George Segal&#x27;s girlfriend Miriam in &quot;The Goldbergs.&quot; She wrote &quot;Dark Shadows: Return to Collinwood&quot; (2012), and appeared in a cameo role in the Johnny Depp/Tim Burton film &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; (2012).

After Scott&#x27;s divorce from Ben Martin in 1990, they continued as partners in Pomegranate Press and remained close until his death in 2017. Scott married Geoff Miller, founding editor and publisher of Los Angeles Magazine in 1991. He died from progressive supra-nuclear palsy in 2011. Kathryn is a national volunteer spokesperson for CurePSP.

She has served on the Boards of the Beverly Hills Women&#x27;s Club and the Women&#x27;s Club of Hollywood.

==Pomegranate Press==
In 1986, Scott founded Pomegranate Press, which published her books about &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, as well as other books authored by her, including &quot;The Bunny Years&quot;, about the 25-year history of Playboy Bunnies, and coffee table books on film art. Pomegranate Press has also published books by other authors, mainly nonfiction entertainment titles. Today, she continues to work as an actress (&quot;Three Christs&quot; with Richard Gere, 2017) and writer (&quot;Last Dance At the Savoy&quot;, &quot;Now With You, Now Without&quot;). She reprised a number of her &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; roles in a series of audio dramas. Scott co-wrote (with Jim Pierson) &quot;Dark Shadows: Return to Collinwood&quot;, an updated retrospective on the original series, including the Tim Burton remake with Johnny Depp, in which Scott has a cameo role. The book was released on April 3, 2012 via Pomegranate Press.

==Personal life==
Scott married her first husband, photographer Ben Martin, in 1971. They divorced in 1990, although the two remained business partners in Pomegranate Press. Martin died in February 2017.

In 1991, she married &quot;Los Angeles&quot; magazine founder Geoff Miller (1936–2011). She and Miller remained together until his death from progressive supranuclear palsy in 2011.

<doc id="1281895" wikidata="Q3314970" url="?curid=1281895" title="Robert Adamson (philosopher)">
<text>Robert Adamson (19 January 1852 – 5 February 1902) was a Scottish philosopher and Professor of Logic at Glasgow.

==Early life==
The philosopher Robert Adamson was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. His father Robert Adamson (d. 1855) was a Scottish solicitor, active in Dunbar, Coldstream and, later, in Edinburgh. His mother Mary Agnes Buist (1809 - 11 February 1876) was the daughter of David Buist, factor to George Baillie-Hamilton, 10th Earl of Haddington (1802-1870). Robert Adamson and Mary Agnes Buist were married on 21 November 1843 at Tyninghame, East Lothian, Scotland. In 1855 Mrs. Adamson was left a widow with small means, and devoted herself entirely to the education of her six children (Helen, Ann, John, David, Robert, and Laurence). Of these, Robert was successful from the first. At the end of his school career he entered the University of Edinburgh at the age of fourteen, and four years later graduated with first-class honours in mental philosophy, with prizes in every department of the faculty of Arts. He completed his university successes by winning the Tyndall-Bruce scholarship, the Hamilton fellowship (1872), the Ferguson scholarship (1872) and the Shaw fellowship (1873).

After a short residence at Heidelberg (1871), where he began his study of German philosophy, he returned to Edinburgh as assistant first to Henry Calderwood (1830-1897) and later to Alexander Campbell Fraser (1819-1914). He joined the staff of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (9th edition) (1874) and studied widely in the Advocates&#x27; Library.

==Professorial appointments==
In 1876 he came to England as successor to William Stanley Jevons (1835-1882) in the chair of logic and philosophy, at Owens College, Manchester. In 1883 he received the honorary degree of LL.D. In 1893 he went to the University of Aberdeen, and finally in 1895 to the chair of logic at the University of Glasgow, which he held till his death.

Except during the first few years at Manchester, he delivered his lectures without manuscripts. In 1903, under the title &quot;The Development of Modern Philosophy and Other Essays&quot;, his more important lectures were published with a short biographical introduction by William Ritchie Sorley (1855-1935) of Cambridge University (see &quot;Mind&quot;, xiii. 1904, p. 73 foil.). Most of the matter is taken verbatim from the note-book of one of his students. Under the same editorship there appeared, three years later, his &quot;Development of Greek Philosophy&quot;.

In addition to his professional work, he did much administrative work for Victoria University and the University of Glasgow. In the organisation of Victoria University he took a foremost part, and, as chairman of the Board of Studies at Owens College, he presided over the general academical board of the Victoria University. At Glasgow he was soon elected one of the representatives on the court, and to him were due in large measure the extension of the academical session and the improved equipment of the university.

Throughout his lectures, Adamson pursued the critical and historical method without formulating a constructive theory of his own. He felt that any philosophical advance must be based on the Kantian methods. It was his habit to make straight for the ultimate issue, disregarding half-truths and declining compromise. He left a hypothesis to be worked out by others; this done, he would criticise with all the rigour of logic, and with a profound distrust of imagination, metaphor and the attitude known as the will-to-believe.

==Philosophical views==
As he grew older his metaphysical optimism waned. He felt that the increase of knowledge must come in the domains of physical science. But this empirical tendency as regards science never modified his metaphysical outlook. He has been called Kantian and neo-Kantian, realist and idealist (by himself, for he held that appearance and reality are co-extensive and coincident).

At the same time, in his criticism of other views he was almost typical of Hegelian idealism. All processes of reasoning or judgment (i.e. all units of thought) are (i) analysable only by abstraction, and (2) are compound of deduction and induction, i.e. rational and empirical. An illustration of his empirical tendency is found in his attitude to the Absolute and the Self. The &quot;Absolute&quot; doctrines he regarded as a mere disguise of failure, a dishonest attempt to clothe ignorance in the pretentious garb of mystery. The Self as a primary, determining entity, he would not therefore admit. He represented an empiricism which, so far from refuting, was actually based on, idealism, and yet was alert to expose the fallacies of a particular idealist construction (see his essay in &quot;Ethical Democracy&quot;, edited by Stanton Coit).

==Personal life==
Robert&#x27;s wife Margaret &quot;Daisy&quot; Duncan (1859-1935), a daughter of David Duncan (1826-1871) (a Manchester linen merchant), was a woman of kindred tastes, and their union was entirely happy. Their daughter, Sarah Gough Adamson was a highly regarded landscape artist.

==Published writings==
It is matter for regret to the student that Adamson&#x27;s active labours in the lecture room precluded him from systematic production. His writings consisted of short articles, of which many appeared in the Encyclopaedia and in &quot;Mind&quot;, a volume on Kant and another on Fichte. At the time of his death he was writing a &quot;History of Psychology&quot;, and had promised a work on Kant and the Modern Naturalists. Both in his life and in his writings he was remarkable for impartiality. It was his peculiar virtue that he could quote his opponents without warping their meaning. From this point of view he would have been perhaps the first historian of philosophy of his time, had his professional labours been less exacting.

<text>Annie Sidonie Goossens OBE (19 October 1899 – 15 December 2004) was one of Britain&#x27;s most enduring harpists. She made her professional debut in 1921, was a founder member of the BBC Symphony Orchestra and went on to play for more than half a century until her retirement in 1981.

== The Goossens family ==
She was born in Liscard, Wallasey, Cheshire, a member of the famous Goossens musical family that had emigrated to Britain from Belgium in the 19th century. Her father and grandfather were both conductors, both called Eugène. Her brother Sir Eugene Goossens was a composer and conductor who spent many years working in Australia as the director of the NSW Conservatorium of Music and chief conductor of the Sydney Symphony. Her brother Léon was an eminent oboist and her sister Marie Goossens was also a distinguished harpist. In 1916, her brother Adolphe, a gifted French horn player, was killed in action at the Somme at the age of 20.

== Early career ==

As a child, she wanted to become an actress but was encouraged by her father to play the harp. Taught (like her elder sister Marie) by Miriam Timothy, she was already playing in public by the age of 16. When she joined the London Symphony Orchestra in 1921, taking part in their first ever tour, she was the only female performer. In 1923 she became the first harpist to be broadcast on the radio, and followed this up in 1936 by becoming the first to be broadcast on television (with the BBC Television Orchestra, conducted by her then husband Hyam Greenbaum).

== BBC Symphony Orchestra ==

She was a founder member of the BBC Symphony Orchestra with whom she played for fifty years (1930–1980). The founder of the orchestra, Adrian Boult, engaged her as Principal Harp before the orchestra&#x27;s first public concert in October 1939. She also played under guest conductors such as Arturo Toscanini, Bruno Walter and Arnold Schoenberg. She officially retired from the orchestra in 1980, the year it was celebrating its golden jubilee. At age 91 in 1991, she became the oldest person to perform at the Last Night
of the Proms concert.

== Personal and family life ==

She married her first husband, the conductor, violinist and composer Hyam Greenbaum, in 1924. In the late 1920s and early 1930s their London home (5 Wetherby Gardens, SW5) became a regular meeting place for musicians, including Arnold Bax, Constant Lambert, Patrick Hadley, Spike Hughes, Alan Rawsthorne and William Walton. Greenbaum died of alcohol-related problems one day after his 41st birthday. With her second husband, Norman Millar, she moved to Reigate in Surrey, where they raised pigs and poultry at the 400-year-old Woodstock Farm, Gadbrook Road, Betchworth. She was a close personal friend of Sir Adrian Boult and Pierre Boulez, who wrote of her: &#x27;Always her presence was reassuring, her professional conscience irreproachable, her attitude faultless. She loved her metier, her instrument. All this, really, was the reflection of her personality for which I have had from the first instant, not only the greatest admiration, but also an immense affection.&#x27;

== Final years ==

She was honoured with a MBE in 1974, and later an OBE in 1980. She retired officially from the BBC Symphony Orchestra in 1980, the year of the orchestra&#x27;s Golden Jubilee. Her final performance was in 1991 during the Last Night of the Proms when she accompanied Dame Gwyneth Jones in her own arrangement of &quot;The Last Rose of Summer&quot;. There were celebratory concerts for her 100th birthday at London&#x27;s Wigmore and Royal Festival Halls. She died in Reigate, Surrey, on 15 December 2004 aged 105.

<text>Kingston is a village and a census-designated place within the town of South Kingstown in Washington County, Rhode Island, United States, and the site of the main campus of the University of Rhode Island. The population was 6,974 at the 2010 census. Much of the village center is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Kingston Village Historic District. It was originally known as Little Rest.

==History==

Kingston was first settled in the late seventeenth century. Originally known as Little Rest, the name was changed to Kingston in 1826. It was the county seat for Washington County (formerly Kings County) from 1752 until 1894, when a new courthouse was built in nearby West Kingston. West Kingston is also the site of the historic Kingston Railroad Station which opened in June 1875. The station is served by Amtrak on its Northeast Corridor.

For a time, starting in the late 1770s, the preacher Jemima Wilkinson, known as the Public Universal Friend resided and gave sermons in the town. As late as the 1900s inhabitants of Kingston called a species of solidago &quot;Jemima weed&quot;, because its appearance in the town coincided with the preacher&#x27;s first visit to the area.

South Kingstown established the Kingston Historic District in 1959, and much of Kingston village became a National Register historic district in 1974 as Kingston Village Historic District. The historic district is located just outside the campus of the University of Rhode Island and contains many fine examples of 18th and 19th century architecture. The historic district includes 38 buildings.

The University of Rhode Island was established at Kingston in 1888 as the Rhode Island Agricultural School and Agricultural Experiment Station, by funding from the Hatch Act of 1887. In 1892 the Agricultural School became the Rhode Island College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts with funding from the Second Morrill Land Grant Act of 1890, later becoming Rhode Island State College in 1909 and the University of Rhode Island in 1951.

==Economy==
In addition to the university, major businesses in Kingston include APC by Schneider Electric and the Arnold Lumber Company.

==Education==
Public schools are operated by the South Kingstown School District. Educational institutions in Kingston include:
* The Compass School, a public K-8 charter school
* Kingston Hill Academy, a public K-5 charter school
* University of Rhode Island
* Gordon Research Conferences center

==Houses of worship==
Religious denominations represented with churches, mosques, and synagogues in Kingston or on the university campus are Roman Catholicism, the United Church of Christ, Episcopalians, United Methodists, Baptists, Islam, and Judaism.

The warforged are a race of living, sentient constructs, superficially similar to golems. Warforged are composed of a blend of materials: predominantly stone, wood, and some type of metal. In Eberron, they were created by House Cannith in magical &#x27;creation forges&#x27; to fight in the Last War, based on technology recovered from Xen&#x27;drik. When the Last War ended, they were given their freedom at the Treaty of Thronehold.

While they have no sex, warforged may adopt a gender role as part of their individual personality, particularly among recently-constructed models who have spent more of their life mingling with other races. They do not age as the other races do, and with the first true warforged being created only 33 years ago it is not yet known what effects time will have on them; it is stipulated that, like all living creatures, their bodies must experience degradation over time. Like other races, warforged may take levels in any character class, but their starting age is uniquely lower for &quot;complex&quot; classes than for &quot;simple&quot; ones, as warforged with such skillsets were only developed recently.

Racial qualities and adjustments of the warforged were published in the &quot;Eberron Campaign Setting&quot; and later reprinted in &quot;Monster Manual III&quot;. Warforged are produced with their own armor and have various immunities, including to poison and disease. Healing spells have reduced effect on warforged, but a series of &quot;repair&quot; spells work fully on them. Besides the roughly human-sized and -shaped standard model, other published forms of warforged include:

* merchurion (MM5) - massive, extremely powerful constructs of living quicksilver; in Eberron they are an ancient variety of warforged, though their origins in other settings vary.
* quorcraft warforged (SoX) - various ancient models of warforged which are mindless but slightly stronger and sturdier than their modern counterparts.
* warforged charger (MM3) – warforged that are larger than standard designed for brute strength, but have little intelligence.
* warforged raptor (FoW) – warforged resembling giant birds or insects, designed for aerial bombardment; similar in construction to warforged titans.
* warforged scout (MM3) – smaller versions of the standard warforged model, similar in size to halflings.
* warforged scorpion (SoX) - warforged resembling giant scorpions created by the drow of Xen&#x27;drik since ancient times; similar in construction to warforged titans.
* warforged titan (ECS) – massive constructs created in the early years of Cannith&#x27;s warforged program; while they have limited problem-solving abilities which set them apart from mindless golems, they are not truly alive like later models.

Besides these base models, individual warforged may have unique features - these include upgrading their standard armor plating to mithral or adamantine, building cognizance crystals (capacitors for psionic power) directly into their bodies, or adding extra attack forms such as spikes or fangs.

Warforged are also capable of modifying their bodies to some extent after construction, represented by prestige classes such as the warforged juggernaut (an aloof warrior who becomes more like a golem), the reforged (a socialite who becomes more like a living creature) and the landforged walker (a druid who coaxes the growth of their wooden components).

==History of the warforged==
===Warforged in Xen&#x27;drik===
The origins of the warforged on Eberron are not clear. According to a &quot;docent&quot; (ancient and sentient memory-containing magic item) found in &quot;Secrets of Xen&#x27;drik&quot;, the very first warforged were created as &quot;host bodies&quot; for a group of Quori (which were very different from Quori of 998 YK). The giants of Xen&#x27;drik created their own versions for their wars against the Quori, because the warforged are immune to many Quori tactics. However, according to &quot;Tales of the Last War&quot;, the giants invented the warforged, after which the Quori stole the secrets of their creation from the dreams of giants and created their own.

Either way, the secrets of warforged creation seem to have originated on the continent of Xen&#x27;drik. The ability of ancient Xen&#x27;drik docents to meld with modern-day warforged supports this theory. The existence of Xulo, a huge and powerful warforged found in Xen&#x27;drik, also supports this theory.

===Warforged in Khorvaire===
Prior to the Last War, the last king of Galifar commissioned the Dragonmarked House Cannith to construct human-sized &quot;mechanical soldiers&quot; similar in appearance to modern warforged. While these soldiers would prove largely ineffective due to their lack of intelligence and high cost, House Cannith continued researching the concept hoping for a more viable product.

Near the halfway point of the Last War, Merrix d&#x27;Cannith was commissioned to build a great army of golems to serve as untiring warriors. Not satisfied with the lifeless, unintelligent hulks his forges produced, nor with the prohibitively expensive process of creating golems one-by-one, Merrix began experimenting with magic to instill some spark of life in them that would enable them, like living things, to direct their own actions and to be grown by a self-sustaining process. In 965 YK, after many unsuccessful attempts, Merrix&#x27;s son Aarren d&#x27;Cannith finally invented the process used in modern creation forges.

The warforged that Aarren&#x27;s creation forges created were fully sentient, with the ability to have emotions, relationships, even to experience death; each new generation increased in sophistication and intelligence, ranging from the barely-sentient titans to the youngest versions of warforged who were fully capable of achieving advanced education and ability in magic. However, Aarren and Merrix had a disagreement over their use. Aarren felt that House Cannith had created life, and refused to see his creations used as tools. Merrix ignored him, and Aarren, feeling powerless, left. Powerful divination magics used to this day have only been able to confirm that he is still alive, not where he is.

In 994 YK (four years before the present day), an unexplained disaster destroyed the entire nation of Cyre, leaving behind the nightmarish mist-shrouded realm of the Mournland. Among the many impacts of this event (including the declaration of a global ceasefire), this resulted in House Cannith losing contact with multiple creation forges and their organisation&#x27;s at-the-time main headquarters.

In 996 YK, the Last War was officially brought to a close by the Treaty of Thronehold, which included two important rulings regarding the warforged:

# All warforged were declared &#x27;people&#x27;, and not possessions.
# The House Cannith creation forges were to be shut down, never to produce any more of the living constructs.

Despite the rulings, many warforged are still regarded as outsiders, and many are still employed as indentured servants.

There are also rumours that Merrix d&#x27;Cannith, (the grandson of the original Merrix) still produces illegal warforged in a lost creation forge. Even more disturbing are the rumors that the Lord of Blades, a rogue warforged, has stumbled onto an undestroyed creation forge in the Mournland and has begun creating an army.
Recently a new group of warforged calling themselves the &quot;Psiforged&quot; have begun appearing across Eberron. Able to use very powerful psionic abilities, their origins are as much as mystery as their motives. Some are said to originate from Mournland, while others appear from deep beneath the depth of Sharn. House Cannith denies any connection to the new design and has stated that they never pursued a psionically enhanced warforged model.

==Religion and spirituality==
Though warforged have free will, whether they have a soul is not known with certainty; they can be resurrected by spells designed to restore human souls to life, but, unlike humans, never remember anything of the afterlife realm of Dolurrh after such an event. Likewise, warforged are incapable of becoming undead.

While some warforged follow existing religions, this and other differences between themselves and the flesh races have led them to rapidly develop a number of unique faiths and philosophies.

The most prominent figure in warforged spirituality is a near-messianic figure called the Lord of Blades, who took advantage of the Day of Mourning to establish an independent warforged outpost within the Mournland. Operating from a philosophy that the existence of organic life will always pose a threat that his people will be returned to servitude, he wages a guerrilla war with the eventual goal the elimination of human dominance in Khorvaire; his agents thus serve as reliable antagonists for many Eberron campaigns. One of the biggest mysteries in the setting is the nature of the Lord of Blades&#x27; identity and to what extent he actually exists or has been mythologized.

Another figure of veneration to the warforged is Bulwark, the liberator of their people. Once a favored servant of King Boranel of Breland, Bulwark is widely held as the driving force behind the inclusion of warforged personhood in the Treaty of Thronehold. Bulwark disappeared into the east after achieving his freedom; some warforged believe that he will return to unite their race, others have set out on their own journeys to find him, and a small group even claim that he and the Lord of Blades are the same person.

The Godforged are groups of wandering monks who believe that the souls of modern warforged are fragments of a being called &quot;The Becoming God&quot;, and seek to construct a giant warforged body for it to inhabit. Many Godforged believe that the Lord of Blades has some special connection to the Becoming God, but should not be directly worshipped. The Godforged have also attracted a small number of non-warforged cultists, who follow the religion&#x27;s philosophy of &quot;making the body into a shrine&quot; by replacing parts of their flesh with golem or warforged components.

==Creative origins==
The warforged are very similar, in appearance, concept and history, to the War Golems of the comic &quot;Battle Chasers&quot;. The War Golems were also built to fight in a war and were also social outcasts after the conflict. Similarly, warforged bear many coincidental nuances in common with Nimblewrights, first mentioned in the &quot;Monster Manual II&quot; (MM2). Nimblewrights however, seem to not only possess self-awareness but also a larger majority of their initial construct designs, including many of immunities.

==Warforged in Fourth Edition==
As of the release of the 4th Edition &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; &quot;Monster Manual&quot; in June 2008, Warforged became an official part of the core Points of Light Campaign Setting, and by extension an encouraged part of all campaign settings (such as Greyhawk, the previous core campaign setting, and The Forgotten Realms).

==Reception==
Mark Silcox and Jonathan Cox highlighted the roleplaying potential of warforged player characters in the book &quot;Dungeons and Dragons and Philosophy: Raiding the Temple of Wisdom&quot;. They wrote, &quot;this new playable race turns many of the accepted tropes of traditional high fantasy storytelling on their heads, and presents the player with several possibilities for investigating interesting philosophical experiments. [...] Now these large bipedal meta-humans made of metal, leather, and fibrous joints have their own thoughts and (somewhat naive) emotions, but have no defined purpose within a world without an obvious war to fight&quot;.

&quot;Geek &amp; Sundry&quot; wrote &quot;Winner of Wizards of the Coast’s Fantasy Setting Search contest in 2002, &quot;Eberron&quot; marries magic with steampunk’s technology, offering a world of elemental-powered airships, industrial nobility, and arcane tinkerers. [...] I dig the playable Warforged race, which puts you in the mind of a soldier drone seeking purpose (although their explicit maleness serves a pedantic point). If you want to sling spells in a tailored coat, check out &quot;Eberron&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="1281920" wikidata="Q5557070" url="?curid=1281920" title="Ghost Dance (novel)">
<text>Ghost Dance is John Norman&#x27;s 1970 historical fiction novel wherein a Sioux man and his tradition comes into conflict with a white woman and her civilization as the Wounded Knee Massacre approaches. As with his &quot;Gor&quot; series, his main body of work, Norman displays both philosophical reaction and an affinity with incorporating historical events into the plotlines of fictional characters.

==Outline==
&quot;There was little noticeable, little remarkable about Edward Chance, saving perhaps that he had once shot and killed a man...His craft, medicine, was more than a business with him, more than a professional skill. It was a way of healing his own heart too.&quot; In &quot;Ghost Dance&quot;, it is through Chance&#x27;s keen eyes and weary heart that readers travel along on a journey of discovery and sorrow. On the run across the plains, Chance stumbles upon Running Horse, a Sioux warrior enacting the sacred and violent ritual of the Sun Dance. Quickly, Chance is pulled into the world of the Sioux people. As their civilization teeters on the brink of destruction, the Sioux perform the mournful and frightening Ghost Dance. Clashes with the white man are rising; the Wounded Knee Massacre approaches, still in the unknown distance; and violence and anger threaten the traditions of a proud and once-great people. Nearby, in her quaint sod house, Miss Lucia Turner awaits the full impact of those clashes. Dust on the horizon signals great change coming to her once-simple life. Lucia will soon become a different kind of woman. With &quot;Ghost Dance&quot;, author John Norman brings the same vigor and passion of storytelling and imagination that enriches his classic Gor novels to a vivid story of historical upheaval and personal exploration.
First published January 1, 1970.

<doc id="1281923" wikidata="Q1176588" url="?curid=1281923" title="David Selby">
<text>David Lynn Selby (born February 5, 1941) is an American film, television, and stage actor. He is best known for playing Quentin Collins on the daytime soap &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; (1968–71) and Richard Channing on the prime-time soap &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; (1982–90). Selby also had prominent roles in the television series &quot;Flamingo Road&quot; (1981–82) and the feature film &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot; (1980).

==Early life==
Selby was born February 5, 1941, in Morgantown, West Virginia, the son of Clyde Ira Selby, a carpenter, and his wife Sarah E. (née McIntyre). He attended West Virginia University.

Midway through his time at WVU, Selby joined the cast of &quot;Honey in the Rock&quot;, a civil war drama at Grandview State Park.

==Career==
===Early TV and film roles (1960s and 1970s)===
In 1968, Selby joined the cast of the TV series &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; as werewolf Quentin Collins. After the series&#x27; cancellation in 1971, Selby played Quentin Collins in &quot;Night of Dark Shadows&quot;, the second feature film based on the show, released later the same year. He reprised the role from the series for a series of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; audio dramas from Big Finish Productions, beginning in 2006.

In 1972, Selby co-starred with Barbra Streisand in the movie &quot;Up the Sandbox&quot;. He continued to appear in a number of film and television roles during the 1970s, including &quot;U-Turn&quot; (1973), &quot;The Super Cops&quot; (1974) and &quot;Rich Kids&quot; (1979), and episodes of &quot;The Waltons&quot; (1974), &quot;Police Woman&quot; (1975), and &quot;Kojak&quot; (1976). He was part of the cast in the Emmy Award-winning miniseries &quot;&quot; (1977).

===1980s===
Selby was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor for his role in the 1980 film &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot;, which was met with a negative reception from critics and audiences along with poor box-office takings.

In 1981, Selby played the villainous Michael Tyrone in the final season of the prime-time serial &quot;Flamingo Road&quot;. After its cancellation in 1982, he joined the cast of &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; as Richard Channing, the illegitimate son of Jacqueline Perrault
(Lana Turner) with Angela Channing&#x27;s husband Douglas Channing. Originally considered an antagonist, Richard gradually became more of a protagonist, and by the final season, he was the central character of the show (in part due to the health-related absence of Wyman). In all, Selby appeared in 209 episodes of the series.

===Later career===
Selby continued in numerous film and TV roles during the 1990s and 2000s, including &quot;Dying Young&quot; (1991), &quot;White Squall&quot; (1996) and &quot;Surviving Christmas&quot; (2004), and episodes of series such as &quot;Cold Case&quot; (2007) and &quot;Mad Men&quot; (2009).

To mark the 200th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s birthday in 2009, Selby appeared onstage with Barack Obama and portrayed Lincoln in a scene from the play &quot;The Heavens Are Hung in Black&quot; at the reopening of Ford&#x27;s Theatre. Selby had also played Abraham Lincoln in a 1998 episode of the series &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, titled &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot;.

Selby made an appearance in the 2012 film adaptation of &quot;Dark Shadows, one of four cast members from the original series to feature in the movie. The same year, he co-starred in &quot;&quot;, a two-part direct-to-video animated film adaptation of the 1986 graphic novel &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, portraying Commissioner James Gordon.

In 2017, Selby had a recurring role in the drama &quot;Legion&quot;.

==Writing==
Selby is also a writer. His work includes the plays &quot;Lincoln and James&quot; and &quot;Final Assault&quot; as well as the poetry collections &quot;My Mother&#x27;s Autumn&quot; and &quot;Happenstance&quot;. Novels he has written include &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s Better Angel&quot; and &quot;The Blue Door.&quot; &quot;A Better Place&quot; combines memoir and social commentary to discuss Selby&#x27;s upbringing. In 2010, he published &quot;My Shadowed Past,&quot; chronicling what it was like to work on &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;.

<text>Sawing a woman in half is a generic name for a number of stage magic tricks in which a person (traditionally a female assistant) is apparently cut or divided into two (or more) pieces.

==History==
There remains a debate about the origin of sawing illusions, with some sources saying a magician named Torrini may have performed the first version in front of Pope Pius VII in 1809. However, it is more likely that the story is a fiction which has its roots in the writings of the famous French magician Jean-Eugène Robert-Houdin. In his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, written in 1858, Robert-Houdin described a sawing illusion performed by a magician named Torrini.

Modern magic inventor and historian Jim Steinmeyer has concluded that there was probably no real Torrini and the story was merely a way for Robert-Houdin to play with ideas. It was suggested during a court case in 1922 that the trick can be traced back to ancient Egypt; however, this claim has not been substantiated. Wherever the idea originated, until the 1920s it remained just an idea for an effect, rather than a practical application of a method.

A public show ‘Phauna - Grand Conjuring Performance’ at the Warminster Athenaeum in Warminster, Wiltshire, 11 and 12 January 1887, included the illusion by Mr F I Flower of sawing his magician’s assistant, Miss Sylvester in half. This could claim to be the earliest verifiable record of this act.

Until recently it was generally accepted that the first public performance of a sawing illusion was achieved by British magician P. T. Selbit on 17 January 1921 at the Finsbury Park Empire theatre in London. In fact Selbit had previously performed the illusion in December 1920 before a select audience of promoters and theatrical agents at the St. George&#x27;s Hall, London, to try to persuade one of them to book his new act for public shows. His trick, which he billed as &quot;Sawing Through A Woman&quot;, was significantly different from what a modern audience would expect. Selbit&#x27;s assistant was locked inside a closed wooden crate and could not be seen. The impression that she could not evade the saw was created by the confined space in the box and by ropes tied to her hands, feet, and neck, which were held throughout the illusion by spectators from the audience.

The question of who was the first woman to be sawn in half has received much less publicity than the question of which magician first presented the illusion. According to Jim Steinmeyer the woman who participated in the December 1920 demonstration was Jan Glenrose, who was Selbit&#x27;s main assistant at that time and who was also the partner of magician Fred Culpitt. In the public performance the role of victim was taken by principal assistant Betty Barker.
Later in 1921, Horace Goldin, a magician working in the United States, presented the first version which might look familiar to modern audiences. Goldin&#x27;s assistant lay in a box from which her feet, head and hands protruded. Goldin sawed through the middle of the box, inserting metal sheets to cover the cut ends, and then pushed the two halves a little way apart. This process was then reversed, and the assistant released unharmed. Goldin later developed a sawing illusion that dispensed with boxes and used a large buzzsaw. The success of Selbit and then Goldin led to more and more magicians trying to imitate them with copies or improved versions of sawing illusions. By November 1921 the Thayer magic company in America was advertising a version for sale. A complete prop from Thayer would cost $175 or they would sell plans for $5.

==Effects and variations==
There are many sawing tricks with significant differences in their basic effect. In some, the illusion is merely of a blade passing through an assistant&#x27;s body, while in others it appears that the assistant is severed into two pieces that are moved apart. Some so-called &quot;sawing&quot; illusions do not actually involve a saw but instead use plain blades or blunt dividing panels.

One major group of tricks involves an assistant in a box, which conceals her body from view while any cutting takes place. This group includes the &quot;Selbit&quot;, &quot;Wakeling&quot; and &quot;Thin Model&quot; tricks as well as several versions associated with Horace Goldin. In some versions the box completely covers the assistant while in others the assistant&#x27;s head, hands and feet remain in view during the trick.

===The Selbit sawing===
Several volunteers are recruited from the audience. One or more of these people are invited to tie ropes around the assistant&#x27;s wrists, ankles and neck. The assistant then steps into a wooden crate or box, which is similar in proportion to but slightly larger than a coffin. The ropes are threaded through holes in the box and the ends are given to volunteers, who are instructed to pull them tight and keep hold of them (the neck rope has an added knot to prevent the assistant being strangled). The assistant is thus secured in a standing spreadeagle position in the box. The box is then closed and lifted into a horizontal position on a set of trestles. The magician then slides glass plates through the crate (and apparently through his assistant).

The magician then saws right through the centre of the box, dividing it into two. The sections are pulled slightly apart and the assistant&#x27;s torso is visible. The impression is that the saw blade must have passed through the assistant&#x27;s midriff. The assistant is then released from the box and is revealed to be unharmed. This was the illusion performed at the Finsbury Park Empire theatre in London on 17 January 1921.

===Goldin&#x27;s box sawings===
Goldin presented several sawing illusions that involved a box. To audiences they all appeared largely similar but they involved differing methods, which were steadily improved as time went on and as earlier methods were exposed. His first performance was at the Society of American Magicians annual banquet at the McAlpin Hotel, New York, on 3 June 1921. On that occasion the trick was not well received. The box he used was large and not very deceptive and instead of an attractive woman he employed a bellboy as an assistant. The impression given was that he was clumsily and hurriedly trying to cash in on Selbit&#x27;s success in Britain. However, fellow magician Howard Thurston, who was in the audience, realised the potential of the trick and persuaded Goldin to let him help in its development.

Thurston employed an established magician and prop builder named Harry Jansen to perfect the illusion. Jansen&#x27;s improved version of the apparatus featured a smaller box from which the victim&#x27;s head and feet would protrude during the sawing. Goldin, Thurston and various other magicians employed by Goldin toured the United States performing this trick with great success at theatres belonging to the Keith-Orpheum group. Goldin had great promotional acumen and was fond of resorting to legal action to block anyone else, including Selbit, from competing with him in the USA. As a result, Goldin was sometimes wrongly credited as the originator of the sawing illusion.

The basic form of Goldin&#x27;s box sawings was as follows. The magician presents a box which is similar in size and proportion to that used in the Selbit sawing but which is already in a horizontal position. An assistant climbs into the box and lies down. In the process her head and hands are seen to emerge from holes in one end of the box and her feet from the other. The box is closed and then sawn through across the middle. Dividers are placed into the box either side of the cut and it is then pulled apart so the sections can be seen clearly separated. The assistant&#x27;s head and hands are seen sticking out of one section and her feet out of the other. The box is then pushed together again and opened and the assistant emerges unharmed.

===Wakeling===
The magician presents a rectangular table just big enough to accommodate a person lying upon it. An assistant is introduced and several assistants are recruited from the audience. The magician presents a set of restraints consisting of a sturdy collar and a pair of ankle straps, each attached to a length of chain or rope. The assistant sits on the table with her legs stretched out and volunteers are invited to fasten the restraints around her neck and ankles.

The ropes or chains are threaded through holes in the table and the ends given to volunteers, who are instructed to pull them tight and hold them that way throughout the illusion. The assistant is thus pulled down onto her back and secured in that position. Two halves of a large box are presented and fixed in place over the assistant, covering her completely. Side panels are opened to show the assistant is still in place lying flat on her back. The assistant is then divided into two. Sometimes the division is accomplished merely by pushing two metal dividing panels into slots near where the two halves meet.

Sometimes the cutting of the assistant is emphasised by sawing between the two halves of the box before sliding the dividers into place. Catches are released to allow the table to be separated into two halves along with the box. The halves are parted and the assistant thus appears to have been cut into two completely disconnected pieces. The box and table are then pushed together, the restraints are released and the box is opened to allow the assistant to emerge unharmed.

This version of the trick is generally associated with magician and inventor Alan Wakeling. Whilst Wakeling performed this illusion and perfected aspects of it, the general configuration and method have been attributed to an earlier magician, Virgil Harris Mulkey (1900–1989), aka. &quot;The Great Virgil&quot;, who first performed it in 1942 and later passed on the idea to Wakeling.

===The thin model===
The thin model sawing is one of the most common variants performed by contemporary magicians. The basic arrangement and sequence of events is similar to that described for the Goldin box sawings (see above). However, the box appears very shallow in comparison to Goldin&#x27;s, which was large by modern standards. The ends of the box are initially open when the assistant climbs in. Once the assistant is lying down she is secured in place by having stocks placed over her neck and ankles. The stocks form the ends of the box. The shallow box adds to the impression that the assistant could not possibly find room to evade the saw blade even if she could release herself from the stocks and try to curl up in one half of the box.

===Transparent boxes===
Magician Les Arnold is reported to have been the first to have devised a clear box sawing (known as the &quot;Crystal Sawing&quot;) as far back as 1976. The Pendragons performed a variation called &quot;Clearly Impossible&quot;, in which the box used is both particularly slim and also transparent. The concept of &quot;Clearly Impossible&quot; has been credited to Jonathan Pendragon and the major distinguishing feature of The Pendragons&#x27; illusion from the Les Arnold concept is that the transparent boxes are seemingly never covered.

===Double sawing===
The &quot;double sawing illusion&quot; is a way of adding an extra effect to box-type sawings. It is generally associated with the &quot;thin-model&quot; sawing apparatus. The magician saws two people in half using two sets of apparatus. The people are usually chosen or dressed so as to be clearly distinguishable. For example, they might be in different colored costumes, of different skin colors, or of different genders. After the box halves are separated they are jumbled up and then re-assembled so that the bottom half of one box is matched to the top of the other and vice versa. When the victims emerge, each appears to have been given the other&#x27;s lower half.

The creation of this version has been credited to magician Alan Wakeling, who devised it for fellow magician Channing Pollock to perform.

===Jigsaw===
This version of the illusion is usually performed using a volunteer from the audience as the assistant being sawn in half, and can be performed without any prior rehearsal with the audience volunteer. The audience volunteer lies down on a table. A frame is placed over her middle. The magician then presents an electric jigsaw and proceeds to align the blade into a slot in the frame. The magician switches on the saw and apparently uses it to slice through the audience volunteer&#x27;s waist, which remains obscured by the frame. The saw emerges from the opposite side of the frame. Once the sawing is finished the frame is removed and the audience volunteer is revealed to be in one piece.

===Bow saw===
This variant begins in a similar way to the jig sawing and is also usually performed using an audience volunteer as the assistant, again without any prior rehearsal. With the assistant lying on a table, the magician fixes a frame over her midriff. The magician then presents a bow saw and proceeds to saw through the volunteer assistant, with the blade guided within the frame. Once the blade has apparently passed all the way through the volunteer assistant the frame is released and removed. It is then revealed that the volunteer assistant is encircled by the handle and blade of the bow saw.

===Buzzsaw===
A large apparatus is presented, consisting of a sturdy frame supporting a large buzzsaw or circular saw and a table sufficiently large to carry a person lying flat. It is shown that the table travels beneath the saw, leaving little or no gap, so that anything placed upon it in the path of the saw would be sliced through. The table is moved either by an electric mechanism or by some form of manual crank. The buzzsaw is generally driven by an electric motor. To demonstrate the saw is completely genuine, a piece of wood is placed on the table and sliced in two in full view. An assistant is introduced and placed in a horizontal position on the table.

Sometimes the magician might give the impression of hypnotizing the assistant into a rigid trance before having her lifted onto the table. She is secured in place with two metal &quot;straps&quot; that close over her waist and which align close to the plane of the saw. She might also be further secured with straps or manacles at her wrists and ankles. A strip of wood is pushed beneath her waist in line with the saw. The saw is then started and the table set in motion. The saw visibly passes through the assistant and generally sounds like it is sawing through something.

Once the table reaches the end of its travel and the saw is switched off the assistant is released and shown to be in one piece and uninjured. The strip of wood that had been placed beneath her is shown to have been sawn into two strips, thus reinforcing that the saw really did cut in the manner it appeared to. Harry Blackstone, Sr. was performing this effect in the United States in the 1930s.

===Death Saw===
The &quot;Death Saw&quot; is presented as an escape gone wrong. Its best known performer is David Copperfield. The performer is secured to a table beneath a large buzzsaw or blade, which is set to descend upon them under the control of a timing mechanism. After being secured with various manacles the performer is enclosed in a box. The saw is then set going.

After a while the sides of the box fall away to reveal the performer struggling to escape the manacles. Finally the saw drops before the performer has time to escape. The blade slices right through the performer&#x27;s body. The two halves of the table are rolled apart so that the performer is clearly separated into two sections. The performer then appears to command the whole process to reverse: The body halves go back together, the saw rises, the box closes. Finally the performer emerges unharmed from the box.

===Modern Art===
Although not generally classified as a &quot;sawing&quot; illusion, &quot;Modern Art&quot; is sometimes billed as an &quot;upright dividing the lady in two&quot;. The prop is a vertical cabinet which stands alongside a table-like structure that is half its height. The assistant enters the cabinet through a door in the side away from the table structure. The assistant&#x27;s face can be seen peering from an opening at the top of the cabinet and a panel at the bottom of the front of the cabinet is opened to show the assistant&#x27;s legs. A sword or blade is then placed into a slot at the point where the top of the half-height table meets the cabinet. The top of the cabinet then slides across onto the table, giving the impression that the top half of the assistant has been moved sideways and in the process been severed from the legs by the blade. Panels in the front of the cabinet are opened to show the top and bottom halves of the assistant apparently separate. The top of the cabinet is then slid back into its original position and the assistant emerges unharmed. The effect and method are credited to designer Jim Steinmeyer.

===Criss Angel&#x27;s pulling a woman apart===
Criss Angel performed a trick in which he appeared to pull a woman in half with his hands during an outdoor performance and half of her crawled away. The trick involved a woman with sacral agenesis and a contortionist. Magician and historian Ricky Jay has written that a version of this trick was previously performed by another magician. The magician that inspired Criss Angel&#x27;s trick was Rajah Raboid, who performed this trick with Johnny Eck and his twin brother, Robert, in 1937.

==Methods and exposure==
As suggested by the various effects, detailed above, there are numerous methods for accomplishing sawing illusions. Over the years a number of these have been exposed and several have been published and are easily obtainable.

Publishing of magic methods has proved a controversial subject at times. It has involved battles between those determined to expose methods and magicians, who have sometimes resorted to legal action to try to preserve secrecy. The sawing illusion has had a prominent role in the history of such battles and has thus contributed to case law.

In September 1921, motivated by concerns about preventing competition from other magicians who might copy him, Horace Goldin forwent secrecy and applied for a patent for &quot;Sawing a woman in half&quot;. He was awarded U.S. patent number 1,458,575 on 12 June 1923. The following is an outline summary the patent:

Penn &amp; Teller use the second variant of this trick on a regular basis in Las Vegas. They have also performed this trick on television at least twice: on &quot;Home Improvement&quot; and during the 2007 NBA All-Star Weekend. They always reveal how the trick is done.

==Famous performances and depictions==
A number of performances or depictions of sawing illusions have achieved particular fame or notoriety.
* P. T. Selbit&#x27;s original performances in London in January 1921 were special because the effect was new and shocking to audiences of the time. Such was the impact of Selbit&#x27;s creation that, for decades afterwards, other magicians would try to emulate and improve on what he had done, thus affecting the course of stage magic history.
* In 1956, Indian illusionist P. C. Sorcar used a buzzsaw to cut his wife in two during a televised performance. Just when he had divided her the host quickly signed off and the show ended. This caused horrified viewers to believe she had accidentally been killed. In reality, it was a live television broadcast and time had run out.
* In the 1957 Friz Freleng cartoon &quot;Show Biz Bugs&quot;, Bugs Bunny asks for a volunteer for this trick, and Daffy Duck happily obliges, throughout attempting to expose the fraud of this trick. After the trick is over, Daffy tries to show the audience he isn&#x27;t cut in half, only for his upper and lower halves to jump whenever he is angry (his response: &quot;Hmmph. It&#x27;s a good thing I got Blue Cross&quot;).
* Live performances by Peruvian magician Richiardi Jr are often cited as the most horrific presentations of a sawing illusion. Richiardi used a buzzsaw prop similar to that employed by Sorcar but he greatly added to the shock value by incorporating fake blood and entrails, which were sprayed over the stage (and sometimes beyond it) as the saw went to work.
*The 1962 &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; episode &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; depicted sawing a woman in half. The NBC Television Network and sponsor Revlon determined the episode was too gory and chose not to air it.
* In the late 1990s, stage performances by David Copperfield often featured presentations of various versions of sawing a woman in half, including &quot;Clearly Impossible&quot;, a buzzsaw that had originally belonged to Orson Welles, and Copperfield&#x27;s own &quot;Blade&quot; length-ways sawing. Very often, these presentations featured Copperfield&#x27;s fiancée, supermodel Claudia Schiffer, as the woman being sawn in half.

==Critical responses and twists==
Jim Steinmeyer has argued that Selbit&#x27;s introduction of the sawing illusion was a turning point in the history of magic after which gentler styles represented by the likes of John Nevil Maskelyne were in irreversible decline to be replaced by more sensational presentations that owed something to the shock effect of Grand Guignol theatre. In particular, Steinmeyer identifies the sawing illusion as the beginning of a fashion for magic featuring female assistants in the role of victim. He says the cliche of &quot;pretty ladies teased and tortured by magicians&quot; was not a cliche prior to Selbit&#x27;s illusion.

Male assistants were common in magic history and in the Victorian era; the cumbersome clothes imposed on women by the fashions of the time made it impractical for them to squeeze into confined spaces required by some tricks. Changing fashions in the early 20th century made Selbit&#x27;s choice of a female victim a practical proposition. It was also true that an illusion designed for a lithe woman might be more compact and deceptive than one tailored to fit a man. However, more controversially, a combination of the emancipation of women and a population desensitized by war and exposed to new entertainment phenomena meant Selbit&#x27;s choice struck a chord in the public imagination. In Steinmeyer&#x27;s words: &quot;beyond the practical concerns, the image of the woman in peril became a specific fashion in entertainment&quot;.

Modern magicians, including female performers, have responded by placing a male performer in the role originally filled by a woman. Magician Dorothy Dietrich, who established herself as a leading magician as a teenager, has been called the &quot;first woman to saw a man in half.&quot;

The centenary of the trick of sawing a woman in half was celebrated in January 2021.

<text>Beal University is a private university in Bangor, Maine, United States. It specializes in professional programs such as healthcare and business. It was established as a business school in 1891.

== History ==
The institution was first established as the Bangor Business School by Mary E. Beal and several partners on October 23, 1891. In the first year of operation, the Bangor Business School was attended by less than 25 students and housed on the second floor of the YMCA. Early offerings of the college consisted of courses in banking, accounting, finance, business arithmetic, business writing, commercial law, penmanship, shorthand, and typing.

Less than 6 months later, in January 1892, attendance had quickly grown to over 100 students and more space was required. It was at this point that the shorthand and typing departments moved to a secondary location on the Exchange Street Block.

12 years after the movement of the shorthand and typing departments, Mary E. Beal took ownership of the Shorthand Department of the Bangor Business School. It became Miss Beal&#x27;s School of Shorthand and Typing, consisting of about 30 students. Some time later, on July 14, 1922, the school was sold to Francis G. Lee, who changed the name to the Beal College of Business.

The next 20 years held much growth for Beal College. In 1928 it was quoted by Harris B. Coe as being, &quot;not only the largest of its kind in Bangor, but also one of the largest in the State&quot;. After multiple administrations the name of the school was changed again, to Beal Business College. By its 50th anniversary, Beal Business College offered multiple two-year degree programs, including subjects such as business, administration, secretarial studies, and bookkeeping.

Authorized by the legislature of the State of Maine, Beal College began offering an associate degree in science on April 28, 1968. Two years later, in 1970, Beal College was accredited as a junior college of business by the Accreditation Commission for Business Schools.

The institution acquired its current name in 2021.

==Academics==
Beal University utilizes a scheduling system referred to as a &quot;Term System&quot;. Under this system the academic year is divided into six eight-week terms. Each term starts every 8 weeks and the university runs classes year-round, allowing students to graduate in about one-third less time compared to a traditional school that operates on a 16-week semester schedule. Under the Term System, full-time students take two classes per 8-week term and are considered FTE (Full Time Enrollment).

The university offers multiple diplomas designed to be completed in 9–14 months, as well as associate, bachelor&#x27;s, and master&#x27;s degrees. Beal University offers a selection of programs including Healthcare, Nursing, Cannabis Business Administration and Sciences, Health Information Management, Health Sciences, Business Programs, Addiction Counseling, and Welding.

In addition to their traditional courses, Beal University also expanded into hybrid and completely online programs. Every program has a hybrid option, where students can complete the first 4–6 months of classes completely online. Several associate and bachelor&#x27;s degree programs are online such as Cannabis Business &amp; Sciences, Business Administration, RN to BSN, Biomedical Science, Healthcare Sciences, and Health Information Management. Two master&#x27;s degree programs are offered online as well, Master of Science in Nursing (MSN), and Master of Business Administration (MBA).

==Accreditation==
Beal is accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges. The medical assisting program is further accredited by the American Association of Medical Assistants and the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs and graduates can receive official certification status. The Health Information Technology program is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Management Education and are eligible for Registered Health Information Technician (RHIT) certification. The Associates in Nursing program (ADN) is an approved educational program in Professional Nursing by the Maine Board of Nursing.

<doc id="1281942" wikidata="Q2890920" url="?curid=1281942" title="Battle of Duck Lake">
<text>The Battle of Duck Lake (26 March 1885) was an infantry skirmish outside Duck Lake, Saskatchewan, between North-West Mounted Police forces of the Government of Canada, and the Métis militia of Louis Riel&#x27;s newly established Provisional Government of Saskatchewan. The skirmish lasted approximately 30 minutes, after which Superintendent Leif Newry Fitzroy Crozier of the NWMP, his forces having endured fierce fire with twelve killed and eleven wounded, called for a general retreat. The battle is considered the initial engagement of the North-West Rebellion. Although Louis Riel proved to be victorious at Duck Lake, the general agreement among historians is that the battle was strategically a disappointment to his cause.

==Prelude==
On March 19, 1885, Louis Riel self-affirmed the existence of the new Provisional Government of Saskatchewan. Following Riel&#x27;s declaration, the Canadian government sought to reassert their control over the turbulent territory. Leif Crozier, the newly appointed NWMP superintendent and commander of northwestern Saskatchewan&#x27;s forces, requested immediate reinforcement to Fort Carlton because he feared the growing instability created by Riel and the ever-growing possibility of a First Nations uprising.
 Riel dispatched emissaries to deliver an ultimatum calling for the surrender of Fort Carlton without bloodshed. Crozier&#x27;s representatives rejected the demand and vowed that the Métis leaders would be brought to justice.

 On March 25, in need of supplies for his men and horses, Crozier ordered Sergeant Alfred Stewart, Thomas McKay, and seventeen constables to Hillyard Mitchell&#x27;s general goods store at Duck Lake. Unbeknownst to Crozier, however, commander Gabriel Dumont (Riel&#x27;s right-hand man) and his Métis force had already entrenched themselves on the road to Duck Lake. On the morning of the 26th, Stewart&#x27;s party encountered the band of Métis near Duck Lake. After ample harassment, Stewart decided not to risk a physical engagement, and chose to return to Fort Carlton; no shooting occurred. Crozier rallied together a larger force, which included 53 NWMP non-commissioned officers and men, 41 men of the Prince Albert Volunteers, and a 7-pounder cannon, and set out to secure the much-needed supplies and to reassert the authority of the Canadian government in the District of Saskatchewan.

==Battle==
The forces met about outside Duck Lake on a snowy plateau covered by trees, shrubs, and a few log cabins. Having spotted Crozier&#x27;s force, Gabriel Dumont ordered his men to set up defensive positions around the log cabin and lie in wait. Similarly, Crozier&#x27;s scouts informed the superintendent of the movements of the Métis; subsequently, Crozier ordered his men to halt and deploy their sleighs parallel to the road which was just before them. Both sides took up defensive positions.

Gabriel Dumont dispatched his brother, Isidore, and an elderly half-blind chief, Assiwiyin, with a white flag in hopes of distracting Crozier&#x27;s forces. The superintendent, believing that Dumont was interested in a parley, walked forward with an English Métis interpreter, &quot;Gentleman&quot; Joe McKay. During the half-hearted discussion, Crozier came to believe that Isidore and Assiwiyin were stalling so that the Métis force could manoeuvre to flank his own men. As they began to leave, both Assiwiyin and Isidore attempted to draw their guns, prompting Crozier to give McKay the order to fire. A brief scuffle ensued between the two parties, which resulted in McKay shooting and killing both Isidore and Assiwyin.

 Despite the firepower and training of Crozier&#x27;s militia, the Métis force were more numerous and their position within the log cabins and the tree line proved to be an efficient advantage. In an attempt to relieve the pressure on the Prince Albert Volunteers, Crozier ordered the 7-pounder to target the log cabins. After numerous discharges, a shell was placed in before the powder charge was inserted, which disabled the cannon for the remainder of the battle.

 Within half an hour, Crozier recognized the unavoidable and sounded a general retreat back to Fort Carlton. The Métis were eager to chase down Crozier and his retreating force, but Louis Riel intervened and declared the battle over.

==Aftermath==
The battle toll was high for the government forces. Twelve men were killed, and eleven men seriously injured. For the opposing side, five Métis warriors were killed in the skirmish, including Dumont&#x27;s brother. Furthermore, Gabriel Dumont himself was injured in the head by a passing bullet. Losing to Riel and the Métis force came as a great shock to Crozier&#x27;s superiors. Colonel Acheson Irvine, Crozier&#x27;s supervisor, suggested that Crozier&#x27;s officerial prowess and judgement was overruled by impulsiveness.

Fort Carlton, a trading post with few defensive installations, was now in serious risk of attack. Immediately, Colonel Irvine summoned a council to discuss the future of Fort Carlton. The resounding unanimous decision was in favour of the evacuation and destruction of the fort. By 4 am on 28 March, the last sleigh had left the smouldering fort.

In the span of three days and with the loss of only five men, Riel&#x27;s forces had defeated Crozier&#x27;s militia, forced the destruction and scavenged the remains of Fort Carlton, and spread fear of a Métis uprising throughout the North-West Territories. Riel&#x27;s plans were not completely successful, though: he had hoped to capture Crozier and his men as hostages so that he might force the government&#x27;s hand. Thus, while tactically successful, the battle of Duck Lake proved to be a strategic disappointment for Riel.

==Legacy==

The site of the battle was designated a national historic site of Canada in 1924.

In the spring of 2008, Tourism, Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Christine Tell said in Duck Lake, that &quot;the 125th commemoration, in 2010, of the 1885 Northwest Resistance is an excellent opportunity to tell the story of the prairie Métis and First Nations peoples&#x27; struggle with Government forces and how it has shaped Canada today.&quot;

Duck Lake is home to the Duck Lake Historical Museum and the Duck Lake Regional Interpretive Centre, and murals which reflect the history of the rebellion in the area. The Battle of Duck Lake and a buffalo jump are located here. The &quot;First Shots Cairn&quot; was erected on Saskatchewan Highway 212 as a landmark commemorating the scene of the first shots in the Battle of Duck Lake. The Our Lady of Lourdes Shrine at St. Laurent north of Duck Lake is a local pilgrimage site.

<doc id="1281952" wikidata="Q2297120" url="?curid=1281952" title="January 2005 Iraqi parliamentary election">
<text>Parliamentary elections were held in Iraq on 30 January 2005 to elect the new National Assembly, alongside governorate elections and a parliamentary election in Kurdistan Region. The 275-member legislature had been created under the Transitional Law during the international occupation. The newly elected body was given a mandate to write a new constitution and exercise legislative functions until the new constitution came into effect. The elections also led to the formation of the Iraqi Transitional Government.

The United Iraqi Alliance, tacitly backed by Shia Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, emerged as the largest bloc with 48% of the vote and 140 out of the total 275 seats. The Democratic Patriotic Alliance of Kurdistan was in second place with 26%, whilst interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi&#x27;s party, the Iraqi List, came third with 14%. In total, twelve parties received enough votes to win a seat in the assembly.

Low turnout amongst Sunni Arabs threatened the legitimacy of the elections, with voter turnout as low as 2% in Al Anbar Governorate. More than 100 armed attacks on polling places took place, killing at least 44 people (including nine suicide bombers) across the country, including at least 20 in Baghdad.

==Background==
In November 2003, the US-managed Coalition Provisional Authority had announced plans to turn over sovereignty to an Iraqi Interim Government by mid-2004. The actual transfer of sovereignty occurred on 28 June 2004. The interim president installed was Sheikh Ghazi Mashal Ajil al-Yawer, and the interim prime minister was Ayad Allawi, a man who had been a CIA asset according to former American intelligence officials.

The voting represented the first general election since the United States-led 2003 invasion of Iraq, and marked an important step in the transition of turning control of the country over from United States occupation forces to the Iraqis themselves. 
 The election was seen by some as a victory for democracy in the Middle East, but that opinion is not shared by all, especially as most of the Arab Sunnis boycotted the vote. Seymour Hersh has reported that there was an effort by the American government to shift funds and other resources to Allawi and that there may have been similar under-the-table dealings by other parties. Although he did not get the most seats in the Transitional Assembly, Allawi&#x27;s delegation jumped from a projected 3-4% of the vote to 14% of the vote, giving him power in the writing of the Constitution.

Two parties supported by the majority Shi&#x27;a (or Shiite) Muslim community between them won a majority of seats, while parties representing the Kurdish community will also be strongly represented. Parties representing the Sunni Arab community boycotted the elections and some armed Sunni groups threatened election day violence. There were 44 deaths around polling stations in at least 9 separate attacks on election day. With a total of some 8.4 million votes cast, a 58% turnout, the Iraqi Electoral Commission considers the election to have taken place without major disruption. Voter turnout ranged from 89% in the Kurdish region of Dahuk to two percent in the Sunni region of Anbar.

After the legislative elections held in December 2005, where 76,4% of registered voters participated, the Iraqi government is considered by 44 international governments to be a legitimate government. According to the American administration, the judiciary in Iraq operates under the primacy of rule of law, so those convicted of war crimes from the former regime of Saddam Hussein will get an open trial, in which their rights will be subjected to due process and be protected by the scrutiny of a free press, the requirements of modern court proceedings. There has however been considerable criticism of criminal justice system presently operating in Iraq.

===Transitional Law===
The Transitional Law required a two-thirds majority of the new assembly to select the new presidents, who appointed the Prime Minister who took office after receiving a simple majority vote of confidence from the assembly. Eighteen Governorate Councils and a 111-member council of the Kurdistan Regional Government were also elected.

The Iraqi Transitional Assembly would: 
*Serve as Iraq&#x27;s national legislature. It has named a Presidency Council, consisting of a President and two Vice Presidents. (By unanimous agreement, the Presidency Council will appoint a Prime Minister and, on his recommendation, cabinet ministers.)
*Draft Iraq&#x27;s new constitution. This constitution was presented to the Iraqi people for their approval in a national referendum in October 2005. Under the new constitution, Iraq would elect a permanent government in December 2005 as new legislative elections were held for the Council of Representatives of Iraq.

Under the Transitional Administrative Law, signed March 2004, the country&#x27;s executive branch was led by a three-person presidential council. The election system for the council effectively ensures that all three of Iraq&#x27;s major ethnic / religious groups are represented. The constitution also includes basic freedoms like freedom of religion, speech, and assembly, and is perceived by some to be more progressive than the American Constitution. Controversially, however, it states that all laws that were in effect on the transfer date cannot be repealed. Furthermore, since the coalition forces are currently working to maintain order and create a stable society under the United Nations, coalition troops can remain in effective control of the country despite the transfer of sovereignty. Since Iraqi forces were then considered not fully trained and equipped to police and secure their country, it was expected that coalition troops will remain until Iraqi forces no longer required their support.

==Electoral system==
The members of the National Assembly were elected by proportional representation using the Hare quota and the largest remainder method with a threshold of one quota. At least every third candidate on each list had to be female.

The Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq (IHEC) also held an &quot;Out-of-Country Registration and Voting Program&quot;; it was conducted by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The goal of the program was to enable approximately one million eligible voters living outside Iraq to participate in the election of the transitional National Assembly. There are 280,303 registered expatriates. By far the largest group of those eligible to vote are in Iran with significant populations in a number of western countries. Iraqi expatriates voted from January 28 to January 30, 2005. International voters could place their ballots in fourteen countries: Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Iran, Jordan, Netherlands, Sweden, Syria, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States.

==Conduct==
===Violence and disruption===
Armed Islamist, Ba&#x27;athist and other groups, which have carried out a campaign of bombings and assassinations in Iraq since the beginning of the occupation in 2003 (see Iraqi insurgency), threatened to disrupt the elections by suicide bombing and other violent tactics.

Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, head of the al-Qaida affiliate in Iraq, said: &quot;We have declared a fierce war on this evil principle of democracy and those who follow this wrong ideology. Anyone who tries to help set up this system is part of it&quot;. He also made it clear that al-Qaida opposes elections in Iraq because they will result in a Shi&#x27;a-dominated government. He alleged that &quot;the Shiites aim to begin spreading their evil faith among people through money and fear,&quot;

A rigid security clampdown succeeded in preventing major disruption of the polling. In most parts of the country Iraqis were able to vote freely. More than 100 armed attacks on polling places took place, killing at least 44 people (including nine suicide bombers) across Iraq, including at least 20 in Baghdad. However, threats by opponents of the election to &quot;wash the streets in blood&quot; were not fulfilled.

An unnamed al-Qaida affiliate dismissed the elections as &quot;theatrics&quot; and promised to continue waging &quot;holy war&quot; against coalition forces. &quot;These elections and their results ... will increase our strength and intention to getting rid of injustice,&quot; read the statement, which was posted to an Islamist web site.

===Boycotts===
One challenge to the legitimacy of the election was the low Arab Sunni turnout, which was as low as 2% in Anbar province. Areas with mixed populations saw the vast majority of voters back Shi&#x27;ite or Kurdish parties. The largest Arab Sunni party, The Iraqis, won only 1.78% of the vote (for comparison, Arab Sunnis are thought to be 15-20% of the population).

The boycott was largely a product of the threatened violence. The violence is centered in the Arab Sunni areas and the Arab Sunni party leaders felt that it would be impossible to hold fair elections in their areas. Major Arab Sunni parties such as the Iraqi Islamic Party and the Association of Muslim Scholars, boycotted the elections, as did some smaller groups such as the Worker-Communist Party of Iraq. The major Arab Sunni groups called for elections to be postponed until the safety of voters could be guaranteed. This call for a delay was supported by some in the west, but any such scheme was strongly opposed by the Shi&#x27;a parties. Despite the boycott and the resulting tiny Arab Sunni representation in the assembly, the major party leaders have assured the Arab Sunnis that they will have input into the new constitution. It is also expected that at least one of the major government positions will go to an Arab Sunni.

Small groups of protesters around the United States demonstrated in support of the boycott of the Iraq elections and against the occupation of Iraq. They claim that for an Iraqi election to have meaning America should not be &quot;orchestrating the process&quot;.

Scott Ritter has alleged that America has partially rigged the election to reduce the percentage won by the United Iraqi Alliance from 56% to 48%. No evidence has been provided to support these allegations.

===Observers===
The election was monitored from outside of Iraq by the International Mission for Iraqi Elections made up of members from nine nations and headed by Canada. It was supported by the United Nations but was not a UN operation. The UN recused itself from monitoring the election as it had played a central role in setting up the election. A number of UN staffers worked within the Iraqi electoral commission setting up the election and are considered by some to be de facto international observers. It proved impossible to find monitors that would actually monitor the election from within the country. Rather the IMIE observers were based in Amman, Jordan and monitored the election from there. There were also representatives in Baghdad, generally the staff in the embassies of the IMIE nations. The absentee poll held in fourteen countries around the world were monitored by a wide array of IGO and NGOs, but these groups were unwilling to monitor the election in Iraq itself.

It is highly unusual to base the monitoring team outside of the country where the election is being held, but the observers decided this was necessary for safety reasons. Among other security precautions all but the head of the mission, Canadian Jean-Pierre Kingsley, remained anonymous. The main burden on monitoring the election thus fell to Iraqi representatives on the ground who sent reports to Amman. The majority of these volunteers were some 35,000 partisan scrutineers representing the parties competing in the election. Another 21,000 non-partisan volunteers were recruited by a variety of agencies and NGOs. The observers assert that despite the unusual circumstances the election was adequately monitored. Others disagree arguing that the IMIE was created to rubber stamp the American-created elections.

At the close of the polls, Kingsley stated that &quot;the Iraqi elections generally meet international standards,&quot; while a preliminary assessment released after polling closed said that areas needing improvement included &quot;transparency regarding financial contributions and expenditures, improvements to the voter registration process and reviewing the criteria for candidate eligibility.&quot;

The final report is available on the IMIE Web site.

==Results==
Provisional results released on February 13 showed that the United Iraqi Alliance, tacitly backed by Shi&#x27;a leader Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, led with some 48% of the vote. The Democratic Patriotic Alliance of Kurdistan was in second place with some 26% of the vote. Prime Minister Ayad Allawi&#x27;s party, the Iraqi List, came third with some 14%. In total, twelve parties received enough votes to win a seat in the assembly. 
The majority of the 111 lists that competed in the election did not win seats. The most prominent party to be excluded was the secular, but predominantly Sunni, Independent Democrats Movement led by former exile Adnan Pachachi. It only received some 12,000 votes. Other prominent parties that failed to win seats include the monarchist Constitutional Monarchy Movement, and the Movement of Free Military Officers and Civilians.

==Aftermath==
On 5 April 2005, the Iraqi Transitional National Assembly appointed Jalal Talabani, a prominent Kurdish leader, President. It also appointed Adel Abdul Mehdi, a Shiite Arab, and Ghazi al-Yawar, the former Interim President and a Sunni Arab, as Vice Presidents. Ibrahim al-Jaafari a Shiite, whose United Iraq Alliance Party won the largest share of the vote, was appointed the new Prime Minister of Iraq. Most power was vested in him. The new government was faced with two major tasks. The first was to attempt to rein in a violent insurgency, which had blighted the country in recent months, killing many Iraqi civilians and officials as well as a number of American troops. (As of mid-2005, approximately 135,000 American troops remained in Iraq with 2,214 American soldiers killed.) The second major task was to re-engage in the writing of a new Iraqi constitution, as outlined above, to replace the Transitional Administrative Law of 2004.

<text>Kunowsky is a small lunar impact crater on the Mare Insularum, in the western half of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It is named after the German astronomer Georg Karl Friedrich Kunowsky. It lies about one third the distance from Encke to the west-northwest and Lansberg to the east-southeast.

This formation is surrounded by lunar mare, and the interior has been flooded by basaltic lava, leaving only a roughly circular rim projecting above the surface. The rim is slender and sharp-edged, with no significant erosion. Apart from a tiny craterlet at the midpoint of the interior floor, this crater has no other significant features. It does lie in a region of the mare where rays from the craters Kepler to the northwest and Copernicus farther to the northeast.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Kunowsky.

<doc id="1281968" wikidata="Q6213334" url="?curid=1281968" title="Joel Crothers">
<text>Joel Anthony Crothers (January 28, 1941 – November 6, 1985) was an American actor. His credits primarily included stage and television work, including a number of soap opera roles, the best known being Miles Cavanaugh on &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, whom he played for eight years. He was also known for his roles as Joe Haskell and Lieutenant Nathan Forbes on &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, Ken Stevens No. 2 on &quot;The Secret Storm&quot;, and pianist/newspaper editor Julian Cannell on &quot;Somerset&quot;.

==Early years==
Born January 28, 1941, in Cincinnati and raised in New York City, Crothers graduated from Birch Wathen School in 1958. His passion for performing emerged at the early age of nine. Crothers auditioned and won a role on the CBS religious TV series &quot;Lamp Unto My Feet&quot;. At the time, his father, George Crothers, was a production supervisor on the show. Unbeknownst to him, his son auditioned for the show under a different name, apparently done as a practical joke. Nevertheless, by the age of twelve, he was taking Broadway bows alongside Burgess Meredith for his stage debut in 1954 in &quot;The Remarkable Mr. Pennypacker&quot; at the Coronet Theatre.

==Career==
During the 1950s and 1960s, Crothers made guest appearances on numerous prime-time programs, including &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;The Defenders&quot;, &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;, &quot;Rescue 8&quot;, &quot;Zane Grey Theater&quot;, &quot;Studio One&quot;, &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot;, and &quot;Goodyear Playhouse&quot;. His later daytime television credits included &quot;First Ladies Diaries: Martha Washington&quot;.

Crothers was cast in the 1960 episode, &quot;3-7-77&quot;, of the syndicated anthology series, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; hosted by Stanley Andrews. He played Jim Badger, a young man who tangles with corrupt lawmen and vigilantes.

Crothers graduated from Harvard University, Phi Beta Kappa, in 1962. In 1966, he returned to Broadway in a starring role opposite Joan Van Ark in &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot;, which he worked on simultaneously with his stint on &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;. From 1966 to 1969, he played Joe Haskell, boyfriend of Carolyn Stoddard (Nancy Barrett) and later boyfriend of Maggie Evans (Kathryn Leigh Scott). During the 1795 storyline, he played Lt. Nathan Forbes, a devious naval officer who blackmailed his way into the Collins family. After Nathan Forbes was killed off, Crothers&#x27;s main character, Joe, was bitten by the vampire Angélique and placed under her thrall. Haunted by the apparition of his deceased cousin Tom (a victim of Angélique) and unable to cope with the revelation that Tom&#x27;s twin brother Chris was a werewolf, Joe slowly lost touch with reality and was sent to a mental hospital by Maggie. He was never seen again and was mentioned only once in a later episode.

From 1969 to 1971, he played twice-married cheat and liar Ken Stevens No. 2 on the CBS serial &quot;The Secret Storm&quot;. Several of his 1971 episodes have been preserved by UCLA&#x27;s TV Archives, though the magnetic VHS tapes are awaiting digital transfer and are not available for viewing by the public. From 1972 to 1976, he played concert pianist-turned-newspaper editor Julian Cannell on &quot;Somerset.&quot; From 1977 to 1984, he made it big with another soap opera role: Dr. Miles Cavanaugh on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, for which he was twice nominated as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series at the Daytime Emmy Awards in 1979 and 1984. He played that role until the series went off the air on December 28, 1984. In 1985, his final role was on &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; as both Jack Lee, a prominent attorney, and his villainous lookalike cousin Jerry Cooper, who had locked Jack in a dungeon and was posing as him.

His soap opera fame helped draw attention to the ground-breaking off-Broadway play &quot;Torch Song Trilogy&quot;. The play made major stars of its writer (and lead performer) Harvey Fierstein and castmates Estelle Getty and Matthew Broderick—but when it premiered, Crothers was better known than any of them and received star billing on posters, playbills, and even the tickets. Fierstein played Arnold, a world-weary drag queen; Crothers played Arnold&#x27;s bisexual lover, Ed. He left the cast when &quot;Torch Song&quot; transferred to Broadway. Brian Kerwin played Ed in the film version.

==Personal life==
Crothers was openly gay among co-stars and others in the entertainment industry, but was closeted publicly and was even engaged to his good friend, actress Veleka Gray, at the time of his death. They became close friends on the set when she joined the final season of &quot;Somerset&quot;, where they played the lovers Julian Cannell and Vicki Paisley.

==Death==
During his last appearances on &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;, he was by then growing very ill. On November 6, 1985, Crothers died from AIDS-related lymphoma in Los Angeles at the age of 44. His remains were cremated and scattered in Lake George, New York.

<text>Edward Benton Dodd (November 7, 1902 – May 27, 1991) was a 20th-century American cartoonist known for his &quot;Mark Trail&quot; comic strip.

==Early years==
Born in Lafayette, Georgia to Reverend Jesse Mercer Dodd and Effie Cook Dodd (the artist Lamar Dodd was his first cousin), Ed Dodd went to work for Dan Beard, founder of the Boy Scouts of America, at the age of 16. Dodd worked at Beard&#x27;s camp in Pennsylvania for 13 summers, where he honed his writing and illustration skills under Beard&#x27;s guidance. Dodd became a scoutmaster and the first paid youth and physical education director for the city of Gainesville, Georgia.

==&quot;Back Home Again&quot;==
After studying architecture at Georgia Tech and at the Art Students League of New York, he purchased a ranch in Wyoming in 1926. In 1930, while working as a guide in the national parks, he created &quot;Back Home Again&quot;, a moderately successful daily single-panel which included characters from Gainesville and North Georgia. The panel, about a hillbilly family, was distributed nationally by United Feature Syndicate until 1945.

==&quot;Mark Trail&quot;==
On April 15, 1946, he launched &quot;Mark Trail&quot; as a daily comic strip distributed by &quot;The New York Post&quot; to 45 newspapers. &quot;Mark Trail&quot; centers on environmental themes and its title character, a wildlife photographer and author whose assignments inevitably lead to involvement in local environmental conflicts. Trail was a younger &quot;alter ego&quot; of Dodd (Gurr 2006), likewise a pipe-smoking outdoorsman and conservationist but footloose and free to travel to adventure. Trail owned a St. Bernard named Andy and lived (between travels) with Doc and Cherry Davis in Lost Forest. Likewise, Dodd had a St. Bernard named Andy, and owned a home and studio (designed by Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s student Herbert Millkey) in a forest in North Georgia that he named Lost Forest. Dodd&#x27;s challenge with this alter ego was to write an educational outdoors-themed continuity strip, in varied settings, about a good-guy conservationist who nevertheless remained credible as a man in his responses to exploiters and to underdogs, and to romance and to hardship. At its peak in the 1960s, the strip enjoyed distribution to about 500 newspapers through North America Syndicate and spun off numerous publications about camping and wildlife.

&quot;Mark Trail&quot; was written by Dodd and drawn by Tom Hill until the latter&#x27;s death in 1978. Dodd then retired, and the strip was continued by his long-time assistant, Jack Elrod, and later by James Allen and Jules Rivera.

Dodd enjoyed wide respect for his support of conservation, and among his honors was Georgia Conservationist of the Year in 1967. On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of &quot;Mark Trail&quot; in 1986, he told a reporter that he had quit Georgia Tech&#x27;s architecture program because of failing grades in math and chemistry. &quot;In my case, finishing college would have been a mistake,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;d probably have become a mediocre architect and starved to death.&quot; Towards the end of his life, he established the Mark Trail/Ed Dodd Foundation. He died in Gainesville in 1991, survived by his fourth wife, Rosemary, who still resides in Gainesville. That same year, the U.S. Congress honored Dodd&#x27;s hero with the Mark Trail Wilderness in the Chattahoochee National Forest. Dodd&#x27;s 130-acre Lost Forest is now residential neighborhoods, one bearing the name &quot;Lost Forest&quot; with a street named &quot;Mark Trail&quot;. In 1996, the house formerly occupied by Dodd in Lost Forest burned to the ground (Hill 2003).

<text>Lallemand is a small lunar impact crater that lies near the western limb of the Moon, in a region where the visibility is affected by libration effects. Because of its location, when viewed from the Earth the crater is viewed nearly from the side, limiting the amount of detail that can be seen. It lies in the northeast part of a mountain range named the Montes Rook that forms a ring around the enormous Mare Orientale impact basin. To the northeast is the Lacus Autumni and to the northwest lies the Lacus Veris, both forming small lunar maria along the sides of the range.

This is a roughly circular, bowl-shaped crater that lies along the northeastern edge of the Montes Rook. Its interior walls slope down to a small floor at the midpoint. This crater was previously designated Kopff A before being named for French astronomer André Lallemand by the IAU in 1985. Kopff is located to the southwest along the eastern edge of the Mare Orientale.

<text>Mico is an unincorporated community in northeastern Medina County, Texas, United States. It is approximately west of Downtown San Antonio off Farm to Market Road 1283. The community is part of the San Antonio Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Its zip code is 78056.

The Medina Irrigation Company (MICO) originally built much of the community as a workers camp, to house the approximately 1500 Mexican laborers (and their families) who constructed Medina Dam. It was the fourth largest dam in the United States at its completion in 1913. The dam has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The dam created Lake Medina, a reservoir to supply water for irrigation of an estimated . The company was founded by Dr. Frederick Stark Pearson, an engineer and developer who designed the dam and raised private project funding, chiefly by the sale of subscriptions to British investors. The outbreak of World War I cut off the flow of capital for sale of farmland dependent on the project. Pearson&#x27;s company went into receivership in 1914 and was sold finally at public auction in 1924. Today the dam and lake are operated by a local water authority.

The town was first named MICO, spelled in capital letters after the company&#x27;s acronym. The town was renamed Medina Lake in 1916, but reverted to the name Mico in 1923.

Today, Mico has a Volunteer City Council Manager, and operates a Volunteer Fire Department. Tourists can enjoy entertainment by visiting local bars.

<text>Leakey is a small, undistinguished lunar impact crater that is located in an area of rough terrain in the eastern part of the Moon. It was named after British archaeologist Louis Leakey.

The immediate area is not notable for crater features, although some distance to the southwest is the crater pair of Capella and Isidorus. In the surface between this pair and Leakey is a system of rilles designated the Rimae Gutenberg that follow a course to the southeast.

Leakey is a circular, bowl-shaped formation that is symmetrical and not significantly eroded. The inner walls slope down to a ring of low albedo material having a diameter about half that of the crater. The rim is not notably eroded and the crater has no other features of interest.

<text>Ludwig Bernhard Förster (31 March 1843 – 3 June 1889) was a German teacher and anti-Semitic activist. He was married to Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, the sister of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche.

== Life ==
Förster became a leading figure in the anti-Semitic faction on the far right of German politics and wrote on the Jewish question, characterizing Jews as constituting a &quot;parasite on the German body&quot;. In order to support his beliefs he set up the &quot;Deutscher Volksverein&quot; (German People&#x27;s League) in 1881 with Max Liebermann von Sonnenberg.

In 1883, Förster left Germany in order to emigrate to Paraguay, when his anti-Semitic beliefs resulted in ostracism and loss of his teaching job. After searching the country for many months, Förster found a suitable site to establish a settlement. It was 600 square kilometres and almost 300 kilometres north of Asunción. The settlement was to become known as &quot;Nueva Germania&quot;. Förster returned to Germany in March 1885 and married Elisabeth Nietzsche on 22 May. The couple assembled a group of &#x27;pioneers&#x27; who shared their anti-Semitic views and wished to live in a new &#x27;Fatherland&#x27; where an Aryan could prosper. They travelled to Paraguay from Hamburg in February 1886.

The initiative failed for many reasons, not least the harsh environment. Förster, beleaguered with debts, drank heavily and became depressed. He eventually committed suicide by poisoning himself with morphine and strychnine in his room at the Hotel del Lago in San Bernardino, Paraguay, on 3 June 1889. He was buried in San Bernardino. After his death, his widow Elisabeth wrote a book entitled &quot;Bernhard Förster&#x27;s Colony New Germany in Paraguay&quot;. Intended to salvage Förster&#x27;s reputation by portraying him as a hero, it was published in 1891.

<text>Lindbergh is a small lunar impact crater that is located in the western part of the Mare Fecunditatis. It lies to the west of the flooded crater Bilharz, and northeast of Ibn Battuta. Lindbergh was previously designated Messier G before being given its name by the IAU. The unusual elongated crater Messier lies about 150 km to the northwest.

This is an isolated crater that is entirely surrounded by lunar mare. It is circular and bowl-shaped, with an interior floor that is about half the diameter of the crater. The inner walls slope gently down to the floor, and lacks notable features or impacts.

==Early life==
The son of Dr. and Mrs. Samuel Pitlik, he was born in Philadelphia. He was a graduate of Central High School, Gratz College, and Temple University.

==Career==
Pitlik began his acting career in a Western series on WCAU in Philadelphia. In 1951, he was part of the set design and construction crew for the Philadelphia Experimental Theater. In 1952, he was a member of the cast for the Summer Theater Guild&#x27;s production of &quot;Philadelphia Story&quot; in Indiana, Pennsylvania.

In 1957, he starred in an Off-Broadway production of Kurt Weill&#x27;s &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;. During the 1960s and 1970s, Pitlik became a familiar character actor on television, making guest appearances in around 80 different TV series (making multiple appearances in several) including &quot;The Untouchables&quot;; &quot;The Rifleman&quot;; &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot;; &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;; &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot;; &quot;Combat!&quot;; &quot;The Virginian&quot;; &quot;The Munsters&quot;, &quot;Gidget&quot;; &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;; &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot;; &quot;Get Smart&quot;; &quot;The Invaders&quot;; &quot;The Fugitive&quot;; &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;; &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;; &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; (in seven different roles, including in the pilot episode); &quot;The Monkees&quot;; &quot;Bewitched&quot;; &quot;The Flying Nun&quot;; &quot; That Girl&quot;; &quot;Run for Your Life&quot;; &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;; &quot;The Doris Day Show&quot;; &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;; &quot;Nanny and the Professor&quot;; &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;; &quot;Room 222&quot;; &quot;Night Gallery&quot;; &quot;Love, American Style&quot;; &quot;All in the Family&quot;; &quot;Mannix&quot;; &quot;Ironside&quot;; &quot;Cannon&quot;; &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot;; &quot;Hawkins&quot;; and &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;.

He also appeared in TV movies, commercials and some theatrical films such as &quot;The Fortune Cookie&quot;, &quot;The Graduate&quot;, &quot;Fitzwilly&quot; and &quot;The Front Page&quot;. Though he largely retired from acting in the mid-1970s to concentrate on directing, Pitlik still made a handful of widely spaced acting appearances over the next two decades.

<text>Guild Software is a small independent computer game developer located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (USA) founded in 1998. Guild Software is best known for creating &quot;Vendetta Online&quot;, a first-person MMORPG that uses their in-house NAOS game engine. In 2009, the studio was voted a &quot;Reader&#x27;s Choice Award&quot; for &quot;Favorite Company&quot; by MMOsite.com.

In 2013, Guild Software&#x27;s Vendetta Online was widely reported as the first MMORPG to support the Oculus Rift, making it potentially the first persistent online world with native support for a consumer Virtual reality headset.

<text>Glendower, now known as Glendower Historic Mansion and Arboretum, is a historic Greek Revival style house located at 105 Cincinnati Avenue, U.S. Route 42, Cincinnati Avenue, in Lebanon, Ohio. It was built in 1836 by Amos Bennett for John Milton Williams, a Lebanon merchant, and named for Owain Glyndŵr (often anglicised as &quot;Owen Glendower&quot;). It has been called &quot;one of the finest examples of Residential Greek Revival architecture style in the Midwest.&quot;

On November 10, 1970, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

==Current use==
From 1944 through 2007, Glendower was operated and maintained by the Ohio Historical Society. On December 3, 2007, it was transferred to the Warren County Historical Society, which ran the site until August 2022 as a museum.

Glendower sold in the fall of 2022 to a private buyer but the sale fell through when the buyer backed out and went on sale again in January 2023, with all restrictive Governor Deed covenants that limited its use removed.

The grounds of Glendower were often used by Civil War reenactors.

<doc id="1282037" wikidata="Q7719042" url="?curid=1282037" title="The Bold Ones">
<text>The Bold Ones is the umbrella title for several television series. It was produced by Universal Television and broadcast on NBC from 1969 to 1973. It was a wheel format series, an NBC programming approach also used by that network in series such as &quot;The Name of the Game&quot; and the &quot;NBC Mystery Movie&quot;.

==Segments==

During the four years of the series there were four segments, three of which rotated the first two seasons; in the third the two survivors, &quot;The New Doctors&quot; and &quot;The Lawyers&quot; alternated, then &quot;The New Doctors&quot; in year four was the sole, remaining occupant under &quot;The Bold Ones&quot;″ umbrella. Just as in its wheel predecessor, &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;, a season consisted of 24 originals with 8 shows filmed for each segment. However, in the debut season the police work forming the setting of &quot;The Protectors&quot; resulted in its order being reduced by two because of the new politically induced mandate by the networks to their suppliers, the studios, to curtail on-screen violence, action and danger which of course cop shows would not exist without at least some mayhem. So, &quot;The New Doctors&quot; was the beneficiary, being handed two extra episodes.

Both violence-free &quot;The New Doctors&quot; and &quot;The Lawyers&quot; segments of &quot;The Bold Ones&quot; received pick-ups for a second season while &quot;The Protectors&quot; became a sacrificial lamb of sorts to be replaced by &quot;The Senator&quot; starring Hal Holbrook. While &quot;The Senator&quot; was by far the most critically acclaimed of the four versions of &quot;The Bold Ones&quot;, NBC dumped it in favor of alternating every week &quot;The New Doctors&quot; and &quot;The Lawyers&quot; for the third season. For the final season, an abbreviated fourth, &quot;The New Doctors&quot; and its 15 episodes were the sole occupant in &quot;The Bold Ones&quot;″ wheel.

Listed here are all four elements:

* &quot;The Bold Ones: The New Doctors&quot; (1969–73) starred E. G. Marshall, David Hartman, and John Saxon (who was replaced by Robert Walden in the final season).
* &quot;The Bold Ones: The Lawyers&quot; (1969–72) starred Burl Ives, Joseph Campanella, and James Farentino. This series was based on the TV movies &quot;The Sound of Anger&quot; and &quot;The Whole World Is Watching&quot;.
* &quot;The Bold Ones: The Protectors&quot; (1969–70) starred Leslie Nielsen and Hari Rhodes as an often conflicting police official and district attorney. This series was based on the TV movie &quot;Deadlock&quot;.
* &quot;The Bold Ones: The Senator&quot; (1970–71) starred Hal Holbrook. This series was based on the TV movie &quot;A Clear and Present Danger&quot;.

The New Doctors was based at the &quot;David Craig Institute for New Medicine&quot;, named after E.G. Marshall&#x27;s character Dr. David Craig. David Hartman played Dr. Paul Hunter, with John Saxon (seasons one, two and three) as Dr. Theodore Stuart, replaced in season four by Robert Walden as Dr. Martin Cohen. These stories were medical dramas.
Drs. Craig and Hunter appeared in a two-part crossover story with &quot;Ironside&quot;, &quot;Five Days in the Death of Sgt. Brown&quot;. The crossover was produced between the departure of Saxon and the casting of Walden, and featured Vic Morrow as a third main character. The story has since been edited into a feature-length &quot;Ironside&quot; story with special opening credits added for E.G. Marshall and David Hartman.

The Lawyers featured the legal firm &quot;Nicholls, Darrell &amp; Darrell&quot;. Burl Ives appeared as senior partner Walter Nicholls in all episodes, and Joseph Campanella was featured as Brian Darrell in almost every episode. During the course of the three seasons, James Farentino was written out of 6 episodes—two during a three-week suspension in 1969, and four in order to appear in a number of theatrical and television films between 1970 and 1972.

The Protectors was included in the format for the first season only. This segment broke new ground for television as it concentrated on legal matters but incorporated topical racial and political elements. Leslie Nielsen played conservative police officer Lt. Sam Danforth, and Hari Rhodes played liberal District Attorney Bill Washburn. These men frequently clashed politically, professionally and personally, yet had a mutual respect and reluctant admiration for each other. The episodes featured an opening narration by a fictional deadpan radio presenter named &quot;Al Raymond&quot;.

The Senator was included during the second season as a replacement for &quot;The Protectors&quot;. Hal Holbrook played Washington Senator Hays Stowe, a tireless crusader and investigator of social and political issues on behalf of the American citizen, giving a positive spin to the political scene. Sharon Acker appeared as Erin Stowe, his wife with Cindy Eilbacher as Norma Stowe, their daughter, and Michael Tolan as the senator&#x27;s chief aide, Jordan Boyle.

Like other wheel shows (&quot;The Name of The Game&quot;, &quot;The Men From Shiloh&quot;, &quot;Search&quot;, &quot;The NBC Mystery Movie&quot; etc.) &quot;The Bold Ones&quot; segments were rotated from week to week, with the main cast of every segment credited at the top of every episode until the abbreviated final season (1972–1973), when only &quot;The New Doctors&quot; remained. While its sixteen episodes were double that of its first two, full seasons when it was on every third week, &#x27;The New Doctors&#x27; succumbed as a mid-season casualty with NBC pulling the plug January 1973. Four months later, May 4, 1973, Jane Wyman&#x27;s physician-themed &quot;Amanda Fallon&quot; pilot, reworked from 1972, with David Hartman once again making a brief appearance as Dr. Hunter, aired as the final episode of &#x27;The New Doctors,&#x27; although its setting is far removed from the David Craig Institute.

Like &quot;The Name of The Game&quot;, &quot;The Bold Ones&quot;&#x27;, opening graphic originally rotated, displaying the featured cast first, followed by the other segments&#x27; casts, with accompanying narration. In the first season, the narrator announced the series&#x27; umbrella title, followed by the narration:

==Awards==

&quot;The Lawyers&quot; was nominated for three Emmy Awards in 1972, winning one for its music and another for its direction.

&quot;The Senator&quot;, which lasted for only eight episodes, earned nine Emmy nominations in 1971, winning five, including best drama, best &quot;continued performance&quot; by an actor (Hal Holbrook), and three additional separate awards for outstanding achievement in writing, direction, and film editing, respectively.

==Syndication==
The series has been in syndication, previously paired with episodes of George Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;Sarge&quot;, which was also produced by Universal.

<doc id="1282046" wikidata="Q1452121" url="?curid=1282046" title="Freak Kitchen">
<text>Freak Kitchen is a Swedish rock band from Gothenburg, formed in 1992.

== History and musical style ==
Freak Kitchen&#x27;s style of music is influenced by many genres besides traditional heavy metal, ranging from jazz to pop. The band described their third album as &quot;A corny little heavy-pop-rock-Latin-world-jazz-avant-garde-metal-blues-record straight from hell!&quot;.
The album &quot;Land of the Freaks&quot;, which was released in late October 2009, features Indian inspiration and the band is also joined by the two Indian musicians V. Selvaganesh and Neyveli S Radhakrishna on several tracks.

The lyrics of Freak Kitchen often contain humor and criticism of capitalist society, conformity, racism and the attitude of major labels.

Frontman Mattias Eklundh has a reputation as a guitar virtuoso, acknowledged by Guitar Player Magazine for instance, and live shows often contain parts where Eklundh plays the guitar using several foreign objects such as a vibrating dildo. Eklundh has also released four solo albums, &quot;Sensually Primitive&quot; (1996) (under the pseudonym Mr Libido), &quot;Freak Guitar&quot; (1999), &quot;Freak Guitar - The Road Less Traveled&quot; (2004) and &quot;Freak Guitar: The Smorgasbord&quot; (2013).

They also co-headlined Fuel Great Indian Rock 2008 alongside Sahg and Satyricon.

Their album, &quot;Cooking with Pagans&quot;, was released in 2014, with the first single, &quot;Professional Help&quot; released in November.

The 2018 album &quot;Confusion to the Enemy&quot; contains a song with Swedish lyrics, &quot;Så Kan Det Gå När Inte Haspen Är På&quot;, that roughly translates to &quot;That&#x27;s What Happens When You Don&#x27;t Take Precautions&quot;.

<doc id="1282050" wikidata="Q7155048" url="?curid=1282050" title="Pauline LaFon Gore">
<text>Pauline LaFon Gore ( LaFon; October 6, 1912 – December 15, 2004) was the mother of former United States Vice President Albert Arnold Gore Jr. and the wife of former United States Senator Albert A. Gore. She is credited with playing a significant role in both of their careers with Al Gore saying &quot;there will never be a better campaigner than Pauline LaFon Gore&quot;. Her advice was an important factor in his refusal to sign the &quot;Southern Manifesto&quot; opposing desegregation and his opposition to the Vietnam War which were critical issues in his bid for re-election as a Senator in 1970. She came from a poor family in small business to become one of the first female lawyers to graduate from Vanderbilt University and managed a Washington law firm in the 1970s.

== Early life ==
She was born in Palmersville, Tennessee in 1912 as one of six children. Her parents, Maude (née Gatlin) and Walter L. LaFon, ran a general store. When her father was injured, the family moved to Jackson, Tennessee, where her father worked for the Tennessee highway department.

Despite the fact that her family was struggling and it was the Great Depression, Pauline LaFon was determined to graduate from college and waited on tables in order to pay her way. From 1931 to 1933, she attended Union University, but did not earn a degree from that institution until nearly seven decades later where she was granted an honorary degree. In 1936, she became the 10th woman to graduate from Vanderbilt University Law School.

She met Albert Gore Sr. while waiting tables at the Andrew Jackson Hotel while he was studying for a law degree as well as farming and acting as the Commissioner for Schools. They ended up studying together for the bar exam where Pauline LaFon obtained a higher mark than Gore Sr.

Following graduation from Vanderbilt, she practiced law in Texarkana, Arkansas for a year before returning to Tennessee and married Albert Gore Sr on April 17, 1937. She practiced in oil and gas law and also divorce law, being one of the first women to practice law in those fields.

== Political wife 1937–1970 ==
Al Gore Sr. was a rising man in the Tennessee political system when he married Pauline LaFon. He was appointed State Labor Commissioner later the same year and was elected to Congress a year later. The Gores&#x27; elder child Nancy LaFon Gore Hunger was born in 1938 as well.

When Al Gore Sr., was elected to Congress in 1938, it was traditional for political wives to stay in the background and not play an active role in their husbands&#x27; political lives. However, she took Eleanor Roosevelt as a role model and actively stumped for Gore&#x27;s first campaign speaking at clubs and extensively canvassing in the rural parts of the electorate.

Pauline Gore would play an active role in all of her husband&#x27;s campaigns as his closest adviser. In 1952, Albert Gore Sr., ran for the Senate standing in the Democratic primary against Kenneth McKellar, who was the powerful chair of the Senate Appropriarions Committee. Due to his position, McKellar was in a strong position to win funding for Tennessee. In order to remind voters of his access in Washington, McKellar used the slogan &quot;The thinking fellar votes McKellar&quot;. In order to counter this slogan, Pauline Gore suggested placing signs with the slogan &quot;Think some more and vote for Gore&quot; close by McKellar&#x27;s signs. Albert Gore Sr. won the primary in what was an upset and the tactic played an important part in the victory.

The Gores&#x27; second child, Al Gore Jr., was born on March 31, 1948. During his childhood, the family would live in Washington for much of the year and return to the family home in Carthage, Tennessee for the summer. Al Gore often referred to her as his &quot;greatest teacher&quot;. Pauline Gore was influential in many committees of Senators&#x27; wives when she was in Washington.

During Albert Gore Sr&#x27;s career as a Senator, Pauline Gore was one of his closest advisers. Her views were influential in Al Gore&#x27;s decision not to sign the &quot;Southern Declaration on Integration&quot; opposing desegregation issued in 1956 by all but three southern Senators. Al Gore Sr. was briefly a candidate for the Democratic nomination as Vice-President but bowed out in favour of fellow Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver who was nominated. Later on, she advised her husband to oppose the Vietnam War, which was highly controversial in the electorate.

== Lawyer, mother, and grandmother 1970–2004 ==
After the defeat of her husband, Pauline Gore resumed her law career in Washington. Her husband joined with her in establishing a law firm together. She later became the managing partner of Peabody, Rivlin, Gore, Claudous and Brashares, a large law firm in Washington, and became a mentor to young women starting their legal careers.

Al Gore Jr. ran for election to Congress in 1976, and Pauline Gore campaigned for him. She would help in most of his campaigns, although she would not play as active a role in his political career as she did in her husband&#x27;s career. She also offered counsel to Phil Bredesen, later mayor of Nashville.

She campaigned for Al Gore Jr. in 1988 in his unsuccessful bid to become the Democratic nominee for President. In 1992, she joined her husband in campaigning for the Clinton-Gore ticket on a seven-week bus trip across the United States with many visits to senior citizens&#x27; clubs.

She had a mild stroke in 1993 and had a heart attack in 1995. Albert Gore Sr. died on December 5, 1998. After receiving a humanitarian award in 1998, she established a scholarship fund for residents of Smith County, Tennessee to enable poor people from that county to attend college. In 1999, the Vanderbilt University law school named her as its Distinguished Alumna for the year, the first woman to be so honored. She died in her sleep at her home in Carthage on December 15, 2004.

<text>The Medina Dam is a hollow-masonry type dam built in 1911 and 1912 by the Medina Irrigation Company in what became Mico, Texas, USA. Medina Lake extends north of it in northeastern Medina County and southeastern Bandera County. The dam and irrigation project was designed and financed by Dr. Frederick Stark Pearson, an American engineer, with extensive British financial backing. The construction took over 1500 men two years to build while working 24 hours a day. They were mostly skilled Mexican workers with experience building other dams for Pearson. They received two dollars for a day&#x27;s work, which were good wages for the time. Pearson&#x27;s Medina Irrigation Company (MICO) built a camp to house the workers and their families; the company town was first called MICO after its acronym. The community is now known as Mico, Texas.

When the dam was completed in 1913, it was the largest hydraulic engineering project west of the Mississippi River and the fourth-largest dam in the US. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its significance as an infrastructure project and its contributions to economic development of the county. Author of &quot;Ripples from Medina Lake&quot;, Rev. Cyril M. Kuehne claims a total of 70 lives were taken during the dam&#x27;s construction, however, he only managed to locate 27 death certificates. Dr. Oscar B. Taylor, dentist of near-by settlement Hondo, Texas, was quoted by Kuehne as saying &quot;sixty-six [unmarked] graves&quot; were counted at a cemetery 3 miles away.

The dam contains over 292,000 cubic yards (223,000 m³) of concrete and measures 164 feet high by 128 feet (39 m) wide at the base by 1,580 feet (482 m) long. It is 25 feet (8 m) wide at the top, which is 1076.2 feet (328 m) above sea level, and the spillway is 1,064.2 feet (324 m) above sea level. The dam provides irrigation to over 34,000 acres (138 km²) to Blackland Prairie farmlands below the Balcones Escarpment around Castroville, Texas, and also supplies water to the Medina River Ultrafiltration Water Treatment Plant owned and operated by the San Antonio Water System.

The reservoir behind the dam is called Medina Lake and is a major recreation area. It discharges into the Medina River, which also contains a diversion dam four miles downstream.

The dam was featured in the 1919 serial The Masked Rider.

Medina Dam was once a publicly accessible, one-lane roadway that connected to County Road 260. In 1980, vehicle traffic was closed and rerouted to a new road known as County Road 264; although temporary use of the dam as a road continued in 1990.

== Historical State Markers on the Dam ==
Located on the dam are three state-placed historical markers. These markers are currently inaccessible to the public after foot traffic was disallowed following the September 11 attacks in response to terrorism concerns. 

=== 1936 Mountain Valley marker ===
The earliest of the three markers is a 1936 state marker that acknowledges the previous Mormon settlement, Mountain Valley that was built in 1854 and was destroyed in 1913 during construction of the dam. The Mormon settlement Mountain Valley is now located underneath Medina Lake.&quot;Established in 1854 by 16 families of Mormons under the leadership of Lyman Wight (1796-1858). They abandoned their homes and mills in 1858 as the result of Indian depredations. Their lands are now beneath the waters of Medina Lake. Erected by the State of Texas - 1936.&quot;

=== 1978 Texas Historical Commission Marker ===
The next is a marker placed in 1978 by the Texas Historical Commission that designated the dam as a state historical landmark.&quot;Henri Castro, who colonized this area in the 1840s, envisioned irrigated farms along the Medina River. The project was delayed, however, until after the turn of the century, when Dr. Fred Stark Pearson, an internationally known engineer, persuaded British investors to finance construction of a dam at this site. Completed in 1912, Medina Dam was hailed as the largest in Texas and the fourth largest in the United States. Limestone boulders from a nearby quarry added bulk to the massive concrete structure. Four miles downstream, a small diversion dam conducted water into a system of irrigation canals. Gravitational force delivered the water to fields. The outbreak of World War I (1914) disrupted ties with British investors. Seeking new capital, Dr. Pearson and his wife left for England in 1915 on the &quot;Lusitania&quot; and were killed when a German submarine torpedoed the ship. The irrigation network created by Medina Dam brought new prosperity to this region. Vegetables raised in irrigated fields became a valuable crop. Water and electricity were made available to rural residents. In 1925 voters established the Bexar-Medine-Atascosa Counties Water Improvement District No. 1 to manage the project. 1978.&quot;

=== 1991 Texas Historic Civil Engineering Marker ===
Placed in 1991, a marker declared the dam a Texas Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.

== Reopening of the Dam ==
The Medina Lake Preservation Society is undertaking efforts to get the dam reopened to the public, or to at least have the historical markers moved so people can see them.

<doc id="1282066" wikidata="Q302004" url="?curid=1282066" title="Frank Reynolds">
<text>Frank James Reynolds (November 29, 1923 – July 20, 1983) was an American television journalist for CBS and ABC News.

Reynolds was a New York–based anchor of the &quot;ABC Evening News&quot; from 1968 to 1970 and later was the Washington, D.C.–based co-anchor of &quot;World News Tonight&quot; from 1978 until his death in 1983. During the Iran hostage crisis, he began the 30-minute late-night program &quot;America Held Hostage&quot;, which later was renamed &quot;Nightline&quot;, and then taken over by Ted Koppel.

==Background==
Born in East Chicago, Indiana, Reynolds attended Bishop Noll Institute in Hammond and Wabash College in Crawfordsville. He was a member of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. Reynolds served in the U.S. Army during World War II; he was a staff sergeant (E-6) in the infantry and was awarded the Purple Heart.

==Early career==
After the war, Reynolds began his broadcast career in Indiana with WWCA-AM in Gary. (He also had an early career stint with WJOB-AM in nearby Hammond, Indiana). Reynolds was a television anchor in Chicago, first on the original WBKB in 1949, which in 1953 would become WBBM-TV, the CBS owned-and-operated station; he also served as Chicago correspondent for CBS News. In 1963, he moved to the second WBKB, an ABC owned-and-operated station (now known as WLS-TV) and served as their main news anchor. Reynolds joined ABC News in 1965 as a correspondent.

==Anchor, ABC News==
By 1968, he became co-anchor of the ABC evening newscast with Howard K. Smith, who remained as co-anchor after Harry Reasoner was hired from CBS to replace Reynolds in December 1970. After the demotion, Reynolds returned to the field as a correspondent for the network. After Reasoner and Barbara Walters ceased their anchor duties in 1978, Reynolds returned to the anchor chair as the Washington, D.C., anchor for the now-revamped &quot;World News Tonight&quot; newscast, with co-anchors Max Robinson and Peter Jennings.
Reynolds was also the original anchor of &quot;America Held Hostage&quot;, a series of special reports seen weeknights at 11:30 p.m. (10:30 p.m. Central Time) on the Iran hostage crisis in November 1979 that evolved into the newsmagazine &quot;Nightline&quot; in March 1980. Reynolds, still an evening news anchor, soon tired of the grind of the extended hours and was replaced by one of his revolving substitutes, Ted Koppel, then the network&#x27;s chief diplomatic correspondent.

=== Reagan assassination attempt coverage, 1981 ===
One famous moment in Reynolds&#x27; career occurred on March 30, 1981, during live news coverage of the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. Early reports received by his newsroom had indicated that press secretary James Brady and others had been shot, but that Reagan was uninjured. He became upset when a report arrived indicating that Reagan had been struck and at one point can be heard shouting at an individual off-screen to &quot;Speak up!&quot; as more information arrived.

Later, Brady, a close friend of Reynolds, was erroneously reported by all three networks as having died from the head wound he suffered in the incident. Upon learning that the information regarding Brady was incorrect, Reynolds suddenly appeared noticeably upset and, looking around at staffers in the background, angrily burst out:

&quot;Let&#x27;s get it &quot;nailed down&quot; ...somebody ...let&#x27;s...find out! Let&#x27;s get the word here, let&#x27;s get it straight so we can...we can report this accurately!&quot;

=== Death ===
Reynolds was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in early 1983 and had been absent from his anchor position since April of that year. He died three months later, on July 20, at the age of 59; his death was attributed to acute viral hepatitis.

==Legacy==
One of Reynolds&#x27; five sons is &quot;NewsNation&quot; correspondent Dean Reynolds. Coincidentally, it was a report from the younger Reynolds while he was a correspondent for UPI which first revealed that James Brady was still alive, leading to the aforementioned outburst from the elder Reynolds.

Reynolds is also famous for his optimistic prediction during a live broadcast of the solar eclipse of February 26, 1979, where he stated, &quot;Not until Aug. 21, 2017, will another eclipse be visible from North America, that&#x27;s 38 years from now. May the shadow of the moon fall on a world at peace.&quot;

Reynolds&#x27; last broadcast was April 20, 1983, and, despite promises of his return by substitute anchormen, he never did, dying from hepatitis-induced liver failure at Sibley Memorial Hospital on July 20, 1983, at the age of 59. He was diagnosed with multiple myeloma while he was being treated for acute hepatitis. Reynolds had injured his upper left femur in the Florida surf in January while on vacation and fell on it after slipping on ice in a mid-February snowstorm. X-rays showed a hairline fracture and he underwent surgery on March 17 and was diagnosed with hepatitis a month later.

Reynolds, an Army veteran wounded in combat, is interred in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. President Reagan and wife Nancy were among the 1,100 at the funeral at St. Matthew&#x27;s Cathedral in Washington. Pope John Paul II sent condolences to the family by a letter from the Vatican, read by Bishop Edward John Herrmann. In 1985, Reynolds was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Reagan on May 23.

A few years after Reynolds&#x27; death, musician Paul Hardcastle recorded a section of an ABC documentary about the Vietnam War, that included narration by Reynolds, and later used it as part of his 1985 U.S. Top 40 and U.K. #1 (five weeks) hit, &quot;19&quot;. Hardcastle had a video made of the song that included footage from that documentary that ABC later demanded be removed. The ABC footage was later replaced with stock footage, but Reynolds&#x27; voice remained on the recording.

<text>The Malta Football Association (MFA; ) is the governing body of football in Malta.

The Association organises the Maltese Football League for both men and women and several other competitions, including knockout competitions for the top teams for both genders. The men&#x27;s national team, women&#x27;s national team, as well as several youth representative teams compete regularly in international competitions organised by UEFA and FIFA. These include the European Championships and the World Cup. Malta also compete in the UEFA Futsal Championship, though not the UEFA Women&#x27;s Futsal Championship to date.

The MFA manages the National stadium and the Centenary Stadium nearby. This complex is based in Ta` Qali and includes training grounds, a gymnasium, a swimming pool and physiotherapy and medical clinics. The complex is also used by foreign clubs during the winter months, due to the mild temperatures of the Maltese Islands.

The association is one of the oldest and one of the best in Europe, having been founded in 1900 with the first national league being organised in season 1909–1910. There are several important landmarks in the history of Maltese football, especially since Malta played its first official international friendly match against Austria in February 1957. The result was a narrow 3–2 defeat for Malta.

It took until 1959 for the MFA to join FIFA, also joining UEFA the year after in 1960. From then onwards, Malta become an ever-present in international competitions at national teams as well as at club levels.

During 2019, the MFA has also entered into talks with the Italian Football Federation and the Lega Pro to discuss the possibility for the MFA to field a professional team within the Italian football league system.

The MFA is structured by having 53 member clubs, as well as 10 member associations. The clubs compete in four divisions; the premier, first, second and
third. The member associations are specialised football associations who organise competitions for clubs affiliated to them. The member associations include:

*the Gozo Football Association – organises competitions for teams on the island of Gozo
*Inter Amateur Soccer Competition
*Employees Sports Association
*Malta Hotels and Restaurants Sports Association
*Industries Soccer Association
*District Football Association
*Malta Youth Football Association – for players under 16 
*Malta Amateur Football Association
*Malta Football Coaches Association
*Malta Football Referees Association

<text>Dalton-in-Furness is a town in Westmorland and Furness, Cumbria, England, north east of Barrow-in-Furness. Along with the rest of the Furness peninsula, it was historically part of Lancashire. It is in the parish of Dalton Town with Newton, alongside the nearby hamlet of Newton-in-Furness. In 2011 it had a population of 7,827.

==History==

Dalton is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, written as &quot;Daltune&quot;, as one of the townships forming the Manor of Hougun held by Tostig Godwinson, Earl of Northumbria. Historically, it was the capital of Furness. The ancient parish of Dalton covered the area which was occupied by the borough of Barrow-in-Furness from 1974 to 2023. Historically a part of Lancashire, the town is associated with a number of famous artists, including George Romney. Dalton Town Hall was completed in 1884.

In 1961 the parish had a population of 10,316. The parish was abolished on 1 April 1974, when it became part of the Barrow-in-Furness district. On 1 April 1987, the new parish of Dalton Town with Newton was created.

The Drill Hall was officially opened in July 1929 as a Regular Army Centre for military training, and was used as a military headquarters in the years leading up to the war in 1939. During the war years (1939-1945) it was a centre for the Home Guard. It had a rifle range until 2009. After the war it was a Territorial and Army Cadet Headquarters. In addition the Drill hall was used as an annexe to Nelson Street Junior School. Since the early 1990s it has been used as a community and youth centre.

==Geography==
The town is situated near the centre of Low Furness, on the eastern crest of a glaciated valley which runs obliquely across the peninsula. Just over a mile to the south lie the ruins of Furness Abbey, and four miles to the south west is the nearest major town, Barrow-in-Furness. The area is generally reached by the A590, the link road from the M6 motorway to the Furness region, which now by-passes the town, reducing the traffic flow, and enabling traffic calming measures which have proved to be rather controversial.
 
Dalton with Newton Town Council was the first corporate member of the Friends of Real Lancashire, an organisation dedicated to recognising the traditional county boundaries of Lancashire.

==Transport==
Dalton railway station, which serves the town, is located on the Furness Line, giving connections to Barrow, Ulverston, Grange-over-Sands and Lancaster. There are longer distance services to Preston and Manchester.

Local buses are operated by Stagecoach Cumbria &amp; North Lancashire with routes to Barrow, Ulverston, Windermere and Kendal. 

==Sport==
The local football teams Dalton United and Crooklands Casuals (also known as the Orangemen) play in the West Lancashire Football League.

Girls&#x27; and women&#x27;s football in the town is provided by Dalton Girls and Ladies F.C. who have junior and open age teams competing in a various Cumbrian leagues.

There is also a 2 junior football clubs, Crooklands Casuals boast the larger set up with teams from under 8s through to under 16s whilst, Dalton Junior F.C. provide mini league football (under 8s, under 9s and under 10s); Dalton JFC currently plays on Dowdales School fields.

Dalton Rugby League Football Club is located at the entrance to the town on Crooklands Brow. Currently in the first division of the North West Counties League. Their ground was recently renamed Kelland Park, in memory of Dalton rugby league stalwart, Ivor Kelland.

Dalton Cricket Club plays in the North Lancs. &amp; Cumbria Cricket League. Dalton won the first organized cricket match played in Furness, beating Barrow.
The Cricket Club also has many junior sides, such as The Under 11&#x27;s &amp; Under 13&#x27;s. It also now has a table tennis club, located at the Seventh Day Adventist Church .

== Education ==
Dowdales School is the town&#x27;s secondary school with approximately 1,050 pupils. The school does not have a sixth form, but pupils transfer either to the Sixth Form College in Barrow, or to Barrow and Kendal Colleges of Further Education.

There are four primary schools in the town, Chapel Street School, George Romney Junior School, Dalton St Mary&#x27;s Church of England Primary School and Our Lady of The Rosary Catholic School.

== Media ==
Regional TV news comes from Salford-based BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill and the local relay transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Cumbria on 96.1 FM, Heart North West on 96.9 FM, and Cando FM, a community-based station that broadcasts to the town on 106.3 FM. 

The town&#x27;s local newspaper is the &quot;North West Evening Mail&quot;.

==Attractions==
In addition to being a quarter hour&#x27;s journey from the boundary of the Lake District National Park, Dalton has a number of tourist attractions within its own borders, including: 
* Dalton Castle (National Trust)
* South Lakes Safari Zoo

==Twin towns==
Dalton is twinned with Dalton, Pennsylvania, United States.

==Notable residents==
In 1614 Margaret Fell (also known as Margaret Fox), founder of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), was born in Dalton with the birth name Askew. Known popularly as the &quot;mother of Quakerism,&quot; she is considered one of the Valiant Sixty early Quaker preachers and missionaries. She died on 23 April 1702 at age 87 or 88.

Dalton was the birthplace and early home of George Romney in the 1700s, as well as Miles Romney in the early 1800s, the latter of whom is a direct ancestor of U.S. politician and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney.

William Ashburner (1737–1793), from Dalton-in-Furness, became the ancestor of a noted family of merchants and administrators in British-ruled India during company rule, the Ashburner family.

Steve Dixon, Sky News presenter, was born in Newton-in-Furness, as was Richard T. Slone (b. 23 January 1974), an award-winning artist. Both were in the same year at school and were educated firstly in Newton and then in Dalton-in-Furness. Turner Prize winner Keith Tyson (b. 23 August 1969) grew up and attended school here as well.

E.B. Ford, an eminent scientist and author of the very popular New Naturalist book on butterflies, was born in Dalton in April 1901.

Tommy Johnson, a footballer and the third highest goal scorer for Manchester City, was born in Queen Street, Dalton in Furness, in 1901. He made five appearances for England’s national team scoring in each game.

<doc id="1282083" wikidata="Q132369" url="?curid=1282083" title="Orchidoideae">
<text>The Orchidoideae, or the orchidoid orchids, are a subfamily of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) that contains around 3630 species. Species typically have a single (monandrous), fertile anther which is erect and basitonic.

== Description ==
The subfamily Orchidoideae and the previously recognized subfamily Spiranthoideae are considered the closest allies in the natural group of the monandrous orchids because of several generally shared characters:
* a shared terrestrial habit
* sectile (capable of being severed) or granular pollinia
* erect anthers.

== Taxonomy ==
Phylogeny of the Orchidoideae is volatile and still subject to change. Historically, the Orchidoideae have been partitioned into up to 6 tribes, including Orchideae, Diseae, Cranichideae, Chloraeeae, Diurideae, and Codonorchideae. However, the most recent molecular phylogenetics analysis led by Chase et al. in 2015 and subsequently by Chen et al. in 2017 indicates that the Orchidoideae should be split into 4 tribes: the Orchideae, Cranichideae, Diurideae, and Codonorchideae.

=== Codonorchideae ===
This monophyletic tribe consists of only one genus, &quot;Codonorchis&quot;, found in South America.
=== Cranichideae ===
This cosmopolitan tribe comprises 8 currently accepted subtribes. Molecular evidence suggests that the former Chloraeeae are sister to the rest of the Cranichideae. As such, the Chloraeeae are now considered a subtribe of the Cranichideae. Moreover, based on morphological and genetic evidence, the genus &quot;Discyphus&quot; was elevated out of the Spiranthinae to form its own monophyletic subtribe, the Discyphinae.


=== Orchideae ===
Once divided into the Orchidinae and Habenariinae (a nonsystematic paraphyletic splitting), the Orchideae now comprise 6 subtribes. Along with previous molecular studies, Chase et al&#x27;s 2015 analysis confirmed that Diseae was a polyphyletic grouping. Consequently, the former subtribes of Diseae have been redistributed within the Orchideae (for instance, &quot;Satyrium&quot; is now classified in the Orchidinae). In his 2015 study Chase recommended further study of historically problematic genera in the former Diseae such as &quot;Huttonaea and Pachites.&quot; Further molecular analysis by Chen et al. in 2017 led to the following reorganization:


=== Diurideae ===
The Diurideae, a predominantly Australasian tribe, retain their previous subtribal organization and comprise 9 taxa:

* Acianthinae (monophyletic)
* Caladeniinae (polyphyletic)
* Cryptostylidinae (monophyletic)
* Diuridinae (monophyletic)
* Drakaeinae (monophyletic)
* Megastylidinae (monophyletic)
* Prasophyllinae (monophyletic)
* Rhizanthellinae (monophyletic)
* Thelymitrinae (monophyletic)

<text>The Liechtenstein Football Association (LFA) () is the governing body of football in Liechtenstein. It was established on 28 April 1934, and became affiliated to UEFA on 22 May 1974. The association organizes the Liechtenstein national football team and the Liechtenstein Football Cup. Because Liechtenstein has fewer than 8 (only 7 not counting reserves) active teams, it is the only UEFA member without its own national league. This means the Liechtensteiner teams play in the Swiss Football League system. The LFV is based in Schaan.

<doc id="1282091" wikidata="Q7645926" url="?curid=1282091" title="Surface Ocean Lower Atmosphere Study">
<text>The Surface Ocean Lower Atmosphere Study (SOLAS) is a global and multidisciplinary research project dedicated to understanding the key biogeochemical-physical interactions and feedbacks between the ocean and the atmosphere. Further, SOLAS seeks to link ocean-atmosphere interactions with climate and people. Achievements of these goals are essential in order to understand and quantify the role that ocean-atmosphere interactions play in the regulation of climate and global change. 

SOLAS was first initiated with an Open Science Conference in 2000 and was formally launched in 2004. Since then, the SOLAS community has grown into a worldwide network with 1075 members and 30 national networks around the world. Development and implementation of the SOLAS science plan is guided by a scientific steering committee (SSC) composed of international experts covering a broad spectrum of disciplines, including atmospheric chemistry, oceanography, marine biology, and legal sciences.  

SOLAS science is currently organised around five core research themes, namely: 1) Greenhouse gases and the oceans; 2) Air-sea interface and fluxes of mass and energy; 3) Atmospheric deposition and ocean biogeochemistry; 4) Interconnections between aerosols, clouds, and marine ecosystems; and 5) Ocean biogeochemical control on atmospheric chemistry. The five SOLAS core research themes are complemented by cross-cutting themes on key environments (such as upwelling systems, polar oceans, and the Indian Ocean), as well as on evaluating the environmental efficacy and impacts of climate intervention proposals, policy decisions, and societal developments.

Since 2000, SOLAS has organised seven international Open Science Conferences and seven Summer Schools tailored to students and early career earth scientists. In addition, to these large-scale events, SOLAS also organises meetings, workshops, and conference sessions related to SOLAS science.  

The SOLAS project is coordinated by an International Project Office (IPO), which is currently hosted by GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, Germany, in association to the research unit chemical oceanography, with a nodal office hosted by the State Key Laboratory of marine Environmental Science at Xiamen University, China. The SOLAS IPO works in close cooperation with the SOLAS SSC chair to provide international science coordination and strengthen capacity building within the SOLAS science community. 

SOLAS is sponsored by Future Earth, the International Commission on Atmospheric Chemistry and Global Pollution (iCACGP), Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR), and World Climate Research Programme (WCRP).

<text>Medina Lake is a reservoir on the Medina River in the Texas Hill Country of the United States. It is operated by the Bexar/Medina/Atascosa County Agricultural District. Medina Dam was completed in 1913 in a privately financed project, creating the lake to supply irrigation water for local agricultural use. Lake Medina is in northeastern Medina County and southeastern Bandera County, about 40 miles (64 km) northwest of San Antonio.

It is a crescent-shaped reservoir running west to east. It is 18 miles (29 km) long and 3 miles (5 km) wide at its broadest point. It is contained by the Medina Dam at the lake&#x27;s south end. At the time of the dam&#x27;s construction, it was the largest concrete dam in the country and the fourth largest dam overall. The dam is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The lake is fed by and discharges back into the Medina River, and serves both recreational and irrigation uses. Communities located along the lake are Mico, Lake Medina Shores and Lakehills.

==Fish populations==
Medina Lake has been stocked with species of fish intended to improve the reservoir for recreational fishing. Fish in Medina Lake include largemouth bass, white bass, hybrid striped bass, catfish, and carp. Due to drought conditions lasting up until July 2015, recreational fish species had disappeared. Plans to restock the lake once levels reach viable levels were put in place. These plans were realized when the lake did reach these levels, which as of October 2, 2016, is 96.6% full.

==Future and state of the lake==
As part of the 2010–13 Southern United States drought, the lake water levels dropped below 5% capacity. Many cracks, oil drums and a Jeep were visible as a result of low water. Only one public boat ramp remained, located at Red Cove in Mico. A few showers in the Summer of 2013 helped the lake rise to 5.2%, but the dam was reopened in September as many people in the South Side of San Antonio use the lake for a water source. Many businesses have closed in the area, many residents have left and Lakehills has become somewhat of a ghost town.

Heavy rainfall in the region as of May 2015 brought the levels above 46% capacity. At that time, Medina Lake was about 28 feet low, down from 90 feet low mere months before.

Due to heavy rains on the Medina River basin and the lake itself in May 2016, Medina Lake was 100% full and 1.5 feet above its conservation pool as of June 1, 2016. As of July 2024, the last time the lake was considered to be at full capacity was on July 7, 2019. Since then, the lake levels have begun to decline once again. As of July 2023, Medina Lake was the lowest it’s been since 2015, only being filled to about 5% capacity, compared to 12% capacity in 2022. This is due to constant drought and irrigation as many experts claim it may take years of rain to replenish the reservoir. Due to declining lake levels, many area farmers have to turned to using groundwater for irrigation. In June 2024, Medina Lake had dropped down to 2.4% capacity, with Lakehills and the surrounding areas suffering an economic depression as a result along with depreciated home values and a rise in homelessness.

<text>Louis Stirling Edmonds (September 24, 1923 – March 3, 2001) was an American actor. He was best known for his roles in &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; and &quot;All My Children&quot;.

Edmonds appeared in the musical &quot;Ernest in Love&quot; in 1960. He acted on the supernatural soap &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; as Roger Collins from 1966 to 1971. His other roles on &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; were Joshua Collins (the father of Barnabas), Edward Collins (the older brother of Quentin), Roger Collins PT (Roger Collins&#x27; opposite self in 1970 Parallel Time), the adult Daniel Collins (a cousin of Barnabas and Millicent Collins&#x27; younger brother), Amadeus Collins (a lawyer who was the main prosecutor in the trial of Judah Zachary in 1692, whose spirit later possesses Gerard Stiles in 1840), and Brutus Collins (a ghost who haunted the secret locked room in 1841 Parallel Time).

On &quot;All My Children&quot;, he played Langley Wallingford/Lenny Wlasuk from 1979 to 1992 (on contract, returning for special events up until 1995, the show&#x27;s 25th anniversary special), who was married to Phoebe Tyler, portrayed by Ruth Warrick. He received Daytime Emmy nominations in 1984, 1985, and 1986. He also received Soap Opera Digest Award nominations in 1989 and 1990.

Edmonds retired from the show due to ill health after being off contract for several years. He died of respiratory failure on March 3, 2001, in Port Jefferson, New York.

==Early life==
Edmonds was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on September 24, 1923, to Walter R. Edmonds and his wife, Katherine L. Stirling. He served in the United States Navy during World War II.

<doc id="1282101" wikidata="Q97704261" url="?curid=1282101" title="South Africans">
<text>South Africans are the citizens of South Africa (officially the Republic of South Africa RSA]). 

These individuals include those residing within the borders of South Africa, as well as the South African diaspora.

==History==
The first modern inhabitants of South Africa were the San peoples and the Khoekhoe peoples.

==Ethnic groups==
==Demographic Changes==

According to the 2022 Statistics South Africa census data, the population of South Africa increased from 51,7 million in 2011 to more than 62 million in 2022, constituting a growth rate of 1,8% in the intercensal period.

The number of households increased from 14.4 million in the 2011 census to 17.8 million in the 2022 census, which is an intercensal growth rate of 2%. The household size declined from 3.6 in 2011 to 3.5 in 2022.

In terms of sex, according to the same census data, in 2022, females constituted 51.5% of the total population (~31.94 million people), while 48.5% were males (~30.07 million people).

Also, &quot;Census 2022&quot; stated that there were more than 2.4 million international migrants residing in South Africa, which equated to just above 3% of the total population in South Africa. Most of these individuals - 86% - came from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region.

Gauteng was the province with the largest population in 2022, comprising 24.3% of the total population in South Africa, followed by KwaZulu-Natal (comprising 20%), and then the Western Cape (comprising 12%); the same order of population size as was the case in Census 2011. All three provinces recorded population growth between &quot;Census 2011&quot; and &quot;Census 2022&quot;.

With the categories combined, in 2022, a total of 3.1% of the South African population reported being either agnostic, atheist, or having, &quot;no religious affiliation&quot;.

==South African Citizenship==

Individuals born in South Africa from and including 6 October 1995 onwards, to at least one parent who, at the time of the individual&#x27;s birth, held either South African citizenship or South African permanent residency, are automatically South African citizens by birth, according to the South African Citizenship Act, 1995 (Act 88 of 1995).

It is also possible to become a South African citizen by descent. An individual born outside South Africa, to at least one parent who, at the time of the individual&#x27;s birth, held South African citizenship, may obtain South African citizenship by descent. The individual&#x27;s birth must be registered in South Africa for them to acquire that status.

Furthermore, it is possible to obtain South African citizenship by being adopted by a South African citizen.

Finally, it is possible to become a South African citizen by naturalization, whereby foreigners wishing to obtain that status may apply for such, if they meet certain eligibility criteria.

<text>The Auschwitz trial began on November 24, 1947, in Kraków, when Poland&#x27;s Supreme National Tribunal tried forty former staff of the Auschwitz concentration camps. The trials ended on December 22, 1947.

The best-known defendants were Arthur Liebehenschel, former commandant; Maria Mandl, head of the Auschwitz women&#x27;s camps; and SS-doctor Johann Kremer. Thirty-seven other SS officers—thirty-three men and four women—who had served as guards or doctors in the camps were also tried.

== Verdict of the Supreme National Tribunal in the first Auschwitz trial ==


Rudolf Höss, sentenced in a previous trial, was executed on April 16, 1947, in front of the crematorium at Auschwitz I. The trial of camp commandant Höss, which took place at the Supreme National Tribunal in Warsaw throughout March 1947, was the first trial held at Auschwitz, followed by the trials in Kraków several months later.

==Summary==
The Supreme National Tribunal presiding in Kraków issued 23 death sentences, and 17 imprisonments ranging from life sentences to 3 years. All executions were carried out on January 24, 1948, at the Kraków Montelupich Prison, &quot;one of the most terrible Nazi prisons in occupied Poland&quot; used by Gestapo throughout World War II. Maria Mandl and Therese Brandl were the first to be executed. One person was acquitted: Sergeant Major Hans Münch, who refused to participate in the selection process and made futile, although confirmed, requests for more food to the inmates.

Liebehenschel, Mandel and Kremer were condemned to death, as were Hans Aumeier, August Bogusch, Therese Brandl, Arthur Breitwieser, Fritz Buntrock, Wilhelm Gehring, Paul Götze, Maximilian Grabner, Heinrich Josten, Hermann Kirschner, Josef Kollmer, Franz Kraus, Herbert Ludwig, Karl Möckel, Kurt Mueller, Eric Muhsfeldt, Ludwig Plagge, Hans Schumacher and Paul Szczurek (Arthur Breitwieser and Johann Kremer had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment). Luise Danz, Hans Koch, Anton Lechner, Adolf Medefind, Detlef Nebbe, and Karl Seufert received life sentences. Alexander Bülow, Hans Hoffmann, Hildegard Lächert, Eduard Lorenz, Alice Orlowski, Franz Romeikat, and Johannes Weber were sentenced to 15 years. Richard Schroeder received 10 years, Erich Dinges five years, and Karl Jeschke three years. Hans Münch was acquitted.

<text>Cecil Donald Briscoe (March 20, 1940 – October 31, 2004) was an American stage and soap opera actor known for starring in the TV series &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Briscoe was born on March 20, 1940, in Scobey, Mississippi. He grew up in a middle-class family, where his father worked as a service manager for Firestone, and his mother worked in admissions at the old City of Memphis Hospital. He earned a scholarship to attend Phillips Exeter Academy and aspired to attend MIT to study astrophysics. He graduated in 1958 and considered either acting or astrophysics, having developed an interest in acting at Phillips Exeter Academy. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Columbia College in 1962. He received his master&#x27;s degree in English literature from Columbia Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1965. While at Columbia University, he and future &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; co-star Roger Davis were classmates and acted in the Columbia Players, then headed by their classmate and future director Brian De Palma.

== Career ==
Briscoe&#x27;s early acting credits include New York stage appearances in &quot;Come Back Little Sheba&quot;, &quot;The Tavern&quot;, and &quot;Friends and Romans&quot;. He played Tony Merritt #2 on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; in 1966. He also made a guest appearance during the second season of &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, which aired on March 20, 1967. He played an officer in the episode &quot;A Secretary is Not a Toy.&quot; 

In 1968, he joined the cast of the Gothic soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; , playing Chris Jennings, Tom Jennings, Timothy Shaw, and Chris Collins. His sexy, brooding good looks made him an instant favorite among fans, and he became the subject of countless fan magazine photos and articles. before leaving the show in 1970.

Briscoe appeared in the 1970 film &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot; as Todd, the fiancee of Carolyn (Nancy Barrett) and the target of her vampire attacks. After appearing in the MGM film, Briscoe abruptly left &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; and left acting, suffering from bipolar disorder.

== Personal life ==
After leaving Dark Shadows, Briscoe&#x27;s sister Bonny said he &quot;suffered something of a mental breakdown...He kind of began criss-crossing the country, working in California some and back in New York...He got into the drug culture very heavily in California...which was unfortunate.&quot; Briscoe moved back to Memphis, Tennessee to live with his parents. He continued to act in local productions, such as in a performance of Hamlet in 1980. He also worked as a gas station attendant for a stint. Over time, Briscoe became more of a recluse, and a psychiatrist eventually ruled he was unable to hold a regular job. He lived off of disability and residual checks. In the 1990s, fans reached out to Briscoe and he admitted he wanted nothing to do with his past celebrity life. Briscoe&#x27;s mom died in 1999, and his father died in 2004. A few days before Halloween, his sister Bonny tried to contact him to no avail. She went to check on him on October 31, 2004 and found Briscoe had died at his home from heart disease.

<text>Trevor Gordon Bannister (14 August 193414 April 2011) was a British actor. He was best known for having played the womanising and wisecracking junior salesman Mr Lucas in the sitcom &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; from 1972 to 1979, and for his role as Toby Mulberry Smith in the long-running sitcom &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;, from 2003 until it ended its run in 2010.

==Career==
In 1960, Bannister appeared on stage at the Cambridge Theatre in London in &quot;Billy Liar&quot;, which starred Albert Finney. He starred as Darkie Pilbeam, a wartime spiv, in the 1968 television series &quot;The War of Darkie Pilbeam;&quot; from 1969 to 1970, he appeared as &quot;Heavy Breathing&quot; in Jack Rosenthal&#x27;s sitcom, &quot;The Dustbinmen&quot;. Shortly afterwards, he was asked to play Mr. Lucas in a &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot; pilot called &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; and took the part in the series. It was originally intended as a vehicle for him as the average man caught up in the store full of odd characters and baroque customs and, for the first four series, he received top billing every other episode, alternating with Mollie Sugden. However, as it developed into more of an ensemble piece, he found his role (and his billing) being greatly reduced as other characters came to the top. He left the role in 1980, as filming for the show clashed with a lengthy tour for a play.

In 1972, he appeared as the weak-bladdered producer of a local theatre company in &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;, Episode 2 series 7 – &quot;A Star is Born&quot;. He played Peter Pitt in the 1988 BBC sitcom &quot;Wyatt&#x27;s Watchdogs&quot;. Other TV appearances include &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot; as the kitchen salesman, and he also appeared in &quot;Call Earnshaw&quot;, &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Way&quot;, &quot;The Saint&quot;, &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot;, &quot;Only on Sunday&quot; and &quot;The Avengers&quot;. Bannister played three different characters in the ITV soap &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. From 2001, he played a recurring character (The Golf Captain) in &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;. He became a series regular in 2009, coinciding with the 30th series. Finally receiving a name (&quot;Toby Mulbery-Smith&quot;), he moved next door to Barry and Glenda (Mike Grady and Sarah Thomas), and befriended Morton (Christopher Beeny).

Although Bannister appeared in a few films including &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot; (1956), &quot;Au Pair Girls&quot; (1972) and the film version of &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; (1977), he worked mostly in the theatre, with credits including &quot;Billy Liar&quot; and the farce &quot;Move Over, Mrs Markham&quot;. Bannister also performed in Shakespeare and was a regular in pantomime for more than 35 years, nearly always playing the dame. In 2007, he guest starred in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio adventure &quot;Nocturne&quot;.

His final appearance was in the TV series &quot;New Tricks&quot; episode &quot;Old Fossils&quot; broadcast 4 July 2011.

==Personal life and death==
Bannister was the youngest of three siblings. His first marriage was to actress Kathleen Cravos in 1959. They had three sons together and later divorced. He married Pamela Carson in 1982.

Bannister died on 14 April 2011, aged 76, after a heart attack at his allotment in Thames Ditton, Surrey. &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; and &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; co-star Frank Thornton said that the last event Bannister attended was Thornton&#x27;s 90th birthday on 15 January 2011, three months before Bannister died.

<doc id="1282126" wikidata="Q7310407" url="?curid=1282126" title="Reino Aventura">
<text>Reino Aventura (&quot;Adventure Kingdom&quot; in Spanish) was an amusement park located in Tlalpan in the south-western part of Mexico City. It opened to the public in March 1982 as the biggest amusement park in Latin America.

As of April 14, 2000 to the present, the park is still operating under the name of Six Flags México.

==History==
The park was closed to the public during part of 1992 while it underwent major reconstruction and improvements. Keiko, the orca that would later play the lead role in the motion picture &quot;Free Willy&quot;, was purchased from Marineland of Canada in Ontario, Canada, and was one of the new attractions aimed to improve the park. On July 3, 1992, the park was reopened to the public under the new name El Nuevo Reino Aventura (&quot;The New Adventure Kingdom&quot;). In 1995, the park changed management and the name was also changed back to the original Reino Aventura. Shortly thereafter, Keiko left the amusement park to be rehabilitated and eventually released into the wild. Thousands of people gathered at the amusement park to say goodbye to Keiko, who was airlifted by UPS to his new home at the Oregon Coast Aquarium in Newport, Oregon, United States on January 7, 1996, ending an era for the amusement park.

==Sale to Premier Parks (Six Flags)==
In March 1999, Premier Parks, the holding company for all the Six Flags theme parks, announced the purchase of Reino Aventura for an estimated $59 million. The park then underwent a major reconstruction, which cost approximately $40 million and was reopened to the public on April 14, 2000, as Six Flags México.

<doc id="1282136" wikidata="Q2255807" url="?curid=1282136" title="The Music Machine">
<text>The Music Machine was an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1966. Fronted by chief songwriter and lead vocalist Sean Bonniwell, the band cultivated a dark and rebellious image reflected in their musical approach. Sometimes the band made use of distorted guitar lines and hallucinogenic organ parts, punctuated by Bonniwell&#x27;s distinctively throaty vocals. 

Although they managed to attain national chart success only briefly with two singles, the Music Machine is today considered by many critics to be one of the groundbreaking acts of the 1960s. Their style is now recognized as a pioneering force in proto-punk; yet within a relatively short period of time, they began to employ more complex lyrical and instrumental arrangements that went beyond the typical garage band format.

In 1965, the band came together as a folk rock trio known as the Raggamuffins, before expanding to the quintet that was later rechristened the Music Machine. The group was known for their style of dress, clothing themselves in all-black attire. In 1966, the Music Machine was signed to Original Sound, and released its first single &quot;Talk Talk&quot; in the latter half of the year, with it reaching the Top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Their debut album &quot;(Turn On) The Music Machine&quot; and the moderate hit &quot;The People in Me&quot; followed. The band&#x27;s original lineup fragmented in late 1967 after managerial and financial disputes. Bonniwell reassembled the group under the name The Bonniwell Music Machine. In 1968, a second album, &quot;The Bonniwell Music Machine&quot; appeared, but the group disbanded in early 1969.

==History==
===Beginnings (1965–1966)===
The nucleus of the band was formed when Sean Bonniwell (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) took part in a jam session with Keith Olsen (bass guitar) and Ron Edgar (drums; born Ronald Edgar on June 25, in Minneapolis, Minnesota) – both of whom he met in the folk music circuit. Bonniwell, already a practiced &quot;folky&quot;, possessed prior experience as a vocalist with the Wayfarers. The traditional folk combo had already enjoyed some regional success: releasing three albums, and building on the experience of Bonniwell who insisted on the importance of rehearsal. As Bonniwell traveled and recorded with the group, he began penning some material that would later surface with the Music Machine. However, still influenced by acts now considered passé, the Wayfarers&#x27; musical traditionalism became stifling to Bonniwell who wanted to explore the type of harder, cutting-edge stylistic possibilities that he eventually would find in rock. Olsen had previously performed in Gale Garnett&#x27;s backing band, and Edgar was a member of a bohemian folk quintet called the GoldeBriars, which featured later Sunshine Pop progenitor Curt Boettcher (whose career would intertwine with various members of the Music Machine in the late 1960s). With the GoldeBriars, Edgar contributed to their third album, which was slated for release on Epic Records, but the group disbanded before the album was issued.

In 1965, the three formed their own folk rock group, the Raggamuffins, and began performing in Los Angeles with a repertoire that saw the band embrace a more unorthodox style, and depart from their traditional roots. The group also recorded four songs that went unreleased until the 2000 album, &quot;Ignition&quot;, which represented the transitional phase before the band developed into the Music Machine. Bonniwell and Olsen were enthusiastically experimenting with musical textures while the band arranged strict rehearsal regimens in Bonniwell&#x27;s garage. The Raggamuffins purchased hardware for a homemade fuzz-tone switch. From the onset Bonniwell ensured the group resonated like no other by instructing his bandmates to lower their instruments from the standard E note to D-flat. As a result of the adjustment, the Raggamuffins were given a bottom-heavy and ominous sound. In addition, the group began dressing noire, while sporting dyed-black hair, and the trademark single leather glove that presented an eye-catching and unified band image, which would later become influential with certain 1970s punk acts.

Auditions were held in early 1966 to expand the group, resulting in the recruitment of Mark Landon (lead guitar) and Doug Rhodes (organ), the latter previously a session musician for the Association (whose first album was produced by Boettcher). To reflect on the revamped line-up, Bonniwell changed the band&#x27;s name to the Music Machine. Another purpose for coining the name, Bonniwell explained, was &quot;I seguewayed [sic] all the original material with musical segueways [sic]. So we would be on stage for like an hour and ten minutes, wall-to-wall music just nonstop, which is why I called us the Music Machine&quot;. The band established a solid reputation with its performances in Los Angeles clubs. With Bonniwell as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader and creative force of the band, the Music Machine began to develop a blend of gritty 60s punk and psychedelia, and a repertoire encompassing Bonniwell&#x27;s self-penned material along with some cover songs. The band&#x27;s sound was highlighted by the authoritative and versatile vocals provided by Bonniwell, with an energized technique and unusually good intonation in long-sustained passages, and the ability to breakdown phrases into a series of slow pulsations. The Music Machine&#x27;s artistic stance was also highlighted by Landon&#x27;s wiry guitar playing, Olsen&#x27;s reverberant bass, and Edgar&#x27;s cymbal-punctuated drumming, which gave the band a harder-edged sound than many of their contemporaries.

===Commercial success (1966–1967)===
Record producer Brian Ross just happened upon the Music Machine at Hollywood Legion Lanes, a bowling alley that was an early stomping ground for the group, and signed them to a recording contract with Original Sound. On July 30, 1966, the band entered RCA Studios in Los Angeles to record the Bonniwell originals &quot;Talk Talk&quot; and &quot;Come on In&quot;, which was initially going to be the A-side for the group&#x27;s debut single. Bonniwell had composed &quot;Talk Talk&quot; a year prior to forming the band, and the studio time was marked by the Music Machine&#x27;s collective input aimed toward tightening the structure of its arrangements, including the two-note fuzz guitar riffs and Edgar&#x27;s precise drumming technique. By virtue of the group&#x27;s dedication to rehearsal, recording sessions concluded with the Music Machine requiring only three takes to complete the two songs. Though the band was satisfied with the acetate to &quot;Come on In&quot;, the members were convinced &quot;Talk Talk&quot; would propel them into the national charts.

&quot;Talk Talk&quot; was released on September 10, 1966, on Original Sound, and rose to number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It also peaked at number 21 on &quot;Cashbox&quot; and number 18 on &quot;Record World&quot;. The song&#x27;s relatively short time-length—a mere one minute and 56 seconds—made &quot;Talk Talk&quot; a favorable staple on Top 40 radio and its competing underground FM stations. The Music Machine&#x27;s hit was arguably the most radical single to appear on mainstream broadcasting in 1966, the phenomenon described by music historian Richie Unterberger as a &quot;rally cry to social alienation with a mixture of sarcasm, rebellion, self-pity, and paranoia&quot;. Indeed, Bonniwell&#x27;s progressive lyrics and arrangements have been credited with influencing the Doors and Iron Butterfly, as well as future punk bands. After the single&#x27;s release, the Music Machine embarked on a grueling three-month tour across the U.S., packaged with the Beach Boys, Question Mark and the Mysterians, and Clyde McPhatter. It concluded with the group receiving a poor response in the American south, where the band were criticized for their black outfits. Nonetheless, for the most part, their unified image served well for the Music Machine&#x27;s national recognition, especially as the group made numerous appearances on the television programs &quot;Where the Action Is&quot;, &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, and &quot;Shindig!&quot;.

After their long national tour, the Music Machine returned to the studio to record their debut album, &quot;(Turn On) The Music Machine&quot;. Much to the disapproval of Bonniwell, his original material had to compete with cover versions of &quot;Cherry, Cherry&quot;, &quot;Taxman&quot;, &quot;See See Rider&quot;, and &quot;96 Tears&quot;, all chosen by their record label with an expectation that well-known songs would increase record sales. The band&#x27;s slow, moody, fuzz-laden arrangement of the folk standard &quot;Hey Joe&quot; bears a strong resemblance to Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s later version. Bonniwell first heard the song in 1962 at a club in Hermosa Beach. He felt the tune&#x27;s tempo was too fast, and he unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the Wayfarers to record a slower version. He revisited the concept with altered lyrics after hearing Tim Rose&#x27;s regionally successful rendition in early 1966. Bonniwell ascribes his throaty vocals, most evident on &quot;Hey Joe&quot;, on recording &quot;the &quot;Turn On&quot; album after a 30-day tour. Mark&#x27;s fingers were literally bleeding. I could hardly even speak, much less sing&quot;. Despite the album&#x27;s shortcomings, &quot;(Turn On) The Music Machine&quot; reached number 75 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. On January 21, 1967, a song taken from the album, &quot;The People in Me&quot;, was issued as the group&#x27;s second single, but it stalled at number 66 nationally after the band&#x27;s management angered radio executives for initially making the song exclusively available to a rival station.

===The Bonniwell Music Machine (1967–1969)===
Immediately after &quot;(Turn On) The Music Machine&quot; was released, the band was booked for another U.S. tour; the group sought an appearance at the Monterey Pop Festival, but it was not included on their itinerary. During off-periods in their hectic touring schedule, the Music Machine demoed a new batch of Bonniwell originals at RCA Studios in New York City and Cosimo Matassa&#x27;s facility in New Orleans, before polishing the tunes in Los Angeles. From the sessions emerged the group&#x27;s third single &quot;Double Yellow Line&quot;, released in April 1967, and bubbled under the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 111. The subsequent release, &quot;Eagle Never Hunts the Fly&quot; failed to chart, but was described as Bonniwell&#x27;s &quot;tour de force&quot;—a tune Ross praised as a &quot;sonically compelling work and a lot to listen to, for the time. It was the kind of thing you just didn’t hear, you almost worried about getting those sounds onto a 45&quot;.

In May 1967, the original lineup recorded together for the final time, completing &quot;Astrologically Incompatible&quot;, &quot;Talk Me Down&quot;, and &quot;The Day Today&quot;. One problem that led to the band&#x27;s first breakup was that as part of their production deal, the &quot;Music Machine&quot; name was owned by Ross, who paid the group little to no royalties. Leaving Bonniwell to carry on the project, Olsen, Edgar, and Rhodes joined the Millennium, a sunshine pop group conceived by Boettcher and Olsen. The Millennium recorded one album, &quot;Begin&quot;, in 1968 before disbanding. The three former Music Machine members also took part in Boettcher&#x27;s next production, the studio group with Gary Usher called Sagittarius. The group released the album &quot;Present Tense&quot;, coupled with the moderately successful single &quot;My World Fell Down&quot;, before Edgar and Rhodes departed. Olsen stayed on board to record Sagittarius&#x27; second album, &quot;The Blue Marble&quot; (on which Boettcher had minimal involvement), and subsequently forged a successful career as a record producer in the 1970s.

Undeterred, Bonniwell successfully negotiated his recording contract with Original Sound be transferred to Warner Bros. Records, in hopes of finding a greater degree of independence. The Music Machine&#x27;s spell with Original Sound was drawing to a close, though the label did release &quot;Hey Joe&quot; as a single in 1968 in an attempt to cash in on Hendrix&#x27;s success with the song. There was also the Bonniwell solo project in association with producer Paul Buff that resulted in the rare &quot;Nothing Is Too Good for My Car&quot; single being put out under the name the Friendly Torpedoes. Writer Greg Russo, who composed the liner notes for the single&#x27;s remastered release, explains the side-project was initiated during a confusing transitional phase for Bonniwell that also generated the tune &quot;Citizen Fear&quot;, which did not receive distribution until the &quot;Ignition&quot; album in 2000. Free from company pressure, Bonniwell formed a new band, rechristened The Bonniwell Music Machine, with session musicians Ed Jones on bass guitar, Harry Garfield on organ, Alan Wisdom on lead guitar, and Jerry Harris on drums.

In March 1967, Bonniwell and Ross ushered in the new lineup at United Western Recorders to record the second album &quot;The Bonniwell Music Machine&quot;. The recording and mixing process was painstakingly masterminded almost solely by Bonniwell, who was appreciative of his new bandmates&#x27; efforts to develop the album&#x27;s concept, but disillusioned by the project&#x27;s lack of cohesion. He further explains that the &quot;Warner Brothers album has such an eclectic approach; each track is (was) a singular, studio invention. Not only was my songwriting divergent, but my approach to recording was exploratory as well&quot;. Six of the album&#x27;s tracks were holdovers from the first lineup&#x27;s sessions at Cosimo Matassa&#x27;s studio and RCA Studios. This resulted in a hodgepodge of musical styles, including exploratory approaches toward psychedelia and soft rock. On February 10, 1968, &quot;The Bonniwell Music Machine&quot; was released with little commercial success. Consequently, the Bonniwell Music Machine was largely forgotten by the general public and the second lineup fragmented in July 1968.

===Disbandment and aftermath===
One final version of the Bonniwell Music Machine was assembled with a revolving door of musicians. Two more singles were released on the Warner Bros. label with little notice, before &quot;Advice and Consent&quot;, the group&#x27;s final single, was distributed on Bell Records in March 1969. Disenchanted by the music industry and having to tour against imitation Music Machine groups, Bonniwell gave up the rights to the band&#x27;s name and signed on to Capitol Records as a solo artist. Under the name T.S. Bonniwell, he recorded the album &quot;Close&quot;, which saw a poetically-inclined Bonniwell explore string and orchestral arrangements. Following the album&#x27;s release, Bonniwell departed on what he called his &quot;westernized guru era&quot;—studying eastern mysticism and practicing meditation and vegetarianism.

The band was all but forgotten after their dissolution, but the Music Machine and their music experienced a revival of interest in the late-1980s. It began with Rhino Records featuring tracks on the &quot;Nuggets&quot; compilation albums &quot;Nuggets Volume 1: The Hits&quot; and &quot;Nuggets, Volume 2: Punk&quot;, before releasing the album &quot;The Best of the Music Machine&quot; in 1984. Other compilations such as &quot;Beyond the Garage&quot;, &quot;The Very Best of the Music Machine&quot;, and &quot;Ignition&quot; have added to the Music Machine&#x27;s return to the public&#x27;s interest. In addition, &quot;Talk Talk&quot; and &quot;Double Yellow Line&quot; appear on the 1998 expanded box-set of &quot;&quot;.

In 2000, Bonniwell published his autobiography &quot;Beyond the Garage&quot;, which recalled his experiences with the Music Machine and his life after the group&#x27;s disbandment. A new version of the Bonniwell Music Machine in 2004 played to packed clubs on a European tour that included an appearance headlining one night of the Wild Weekend festival in Spain. Aside from this, a few live performances with the Larksmen, and a guest appearance on their 2006 album, Bonniwell never returned to an active music career, though he claimed to have penned over 300 songs after his tenure with the Music Machine. On December 20, 2011, Bonniwell died of lung cancer at a medical center in Visalia, California; he was 71 years old. Drummer Ronald &quot;Ron&quot; Edgar died on February 23, 2015, at the age of 68. Bass guitarist Keith Olsen died on March 9, 2020, at age 74.

<doc id="1282153" wikidata="Q6867324" url="?curid=1282153" title="Ministry of Justice of Cameroon">
<text>The Ministry of Justice of Cameroon is the Department responsible for administering the Cameroon justice system. As of May 2004, the Minister of State for Justice was Amadou Ali. The legal system in the Cameroon is complex with a constitution developed in 1972 and revised in 1996 as well as elements of the Code Napoleon, Common Law and customary law. In early 2005, the Ministry of Justice became responsible for administering the prison system due to unrest in the prisons. The Ministry of Justice also has a shared responsibility for administering human rights in the Cameroon. There have been serious allegations about use of torture by police and military officials in the Cameroon.

==Administration of justice==
The Constitution of Cameroon provides that the Supreme Court of Cameroon is the highest court existing in the country. In addition, the country has appeal courts, circuit courts and magistrates courts. The Supreme Court is located in Yaoundé as is the Cameroon High Court of Justice consisting of nine titular judges and six surrogate judges and The Constitutional Council of Cameroon, consisting of eleven Judges with three nominated by the President of Cameroon, three nominated by the President of the Senate, three others nominated by the Speaker of the National Assembly and two by the Higher Judicial Council. All of these nominations are forwarded to the President of the republic who appoints them by decree. Other courts are located throughout the country.

The constitution provides for a Constitutional Council responsible for ensuring the Constitutionality of laws. The Supreme Court carried out this duty before its creation in 2018. Cameroon claims that the judiciary is independent from the executive and the legislature. However, the US State Department claims that the judiciary is subordinate to the Ministry of Justice and that the Supreme Court can only consider a constitutional matter when referred to it by the President of Cameroon, 1/3 of the Members of the Cameroonian National Assembly or 1/3 of the Members of the Senate of Cameroon. The Supreme Court is responsible for adjudicating disputes between the president and the National Assembly.

The President of the Cameroon in his capacity as President of the Higher Judicial Council of Cameroon is responsible for appointing judges and also has the power to dismiss them. The Higher Judicial Council of Cameroon advises him on the nomination of judges and magistrates and has responsibility for judicial discipline.

The Parliamentary Court of Justice is responsible for judging acts by the President in cases where he or she has been accused of high treason. This Court also has responsibility for judging acts by the Prime Minister of the Cameroon, other members of the Government and other senior officials in cases relevant to state security.

==Legal traditions==
Prior to independence, jurisdiction over Cameroon was shared between the United Kingdom and France under a League of Nations mandate issued in 1919. The northern part of the British area became part of Nigeria while the Christian southern part joined with the French area. As a consequence, the country inherited a dual legal system including parts of the Code Napoleon and the common law. However, on 12 July 2005 the National Assembly (Assemblé Nationale) approved a law to harmonize the country&#x27;s criminal procedure code.

In addition, traditional courts still play a significant role in domestic, property and probate. The court system honours tribal laws and customs when these do not conflict with national laws.

==Prison system==
The Ministry of Justice became responsible for administering the prison system at the beginning of 2005 taking over responsibility from the Ministry of Territorial Administration of Cameroon. This follows disturbances caused by overcrowding of prisons and long stays in detention without charges of prisons.

There were 15,903 people in the prison system as of 1997 representing 115 per 100,000 population. However, the population of the prisons has grown rapidly in recent years. The New Bell prison in Douala was meant to hold 800 inmates but holds 3,100. The International Centre for Prison Studies estimates that Cameroon has the second highest occupancy rate in the world after Barbados with approximately half awaiting trial.

The Government has built two new prisons but has not provided enough staff resulting in the establishment of &quot;anti-gangs&quot; of 
inmates to preserve order.

==Human rights==
The preamble of the constitution adopted in 1996 incorporates parts of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights. The Ministry of Justice shares responsibility for administering human rights with the Ministry of Territorial Administration.

A person who considers that their rights may have been violated may take their case either to the statutory courts or to the traditional courts. They may also petition the National Committee on Human Rights and Freedoms established in 1990. They may also seek compensation through the courts. If a person is acquitted, discharged or has been wrongfully held in custody, they are not entitled to compensation unless they can prove that the judge was wrong or the system did not function properly.

The United Nations Commission on Human Rights held hearings in 2003 into allegations of torture by the police and the military. The major area of concern was the prison network although it has been acknowledged that Cameroon had made some progress in improving its human rights performance.

<doc id="1282160" wikidata="Q2593110" url="?curid=1282160" title="Woodbridge, Ontario">
<text>Woodbridge is a very large suburban community in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada, along the city&#x27;s border with Toronto. It occupies the city&#x27;s entire southwest quadrant, west of Highway 400, east of Highway 50, north of Steeles Avenue, and generally south of Major Mackenzie Drive. It was once an independent village before being amalgamated with nearby communities to form the city in 1971. Its traditional downtown core is the Woodbridge Avenue stretch between Islington Avenue and Kipling Avenue north of Highway 7.

==History==
 

The community had its origins with the British Crown granting the west half of lots six and seven, concession 7 of Vaughan Township to Jacob Philips and Hugh Cameron in 1802. Woodbridge had its beginnings in what is today Pine Grove. During the early half the 19th century, a school was built on Vaughan&#x27;s eighth concession; and a flour mill and store flourished. A scattering of houses arose around Smith&#x27;s mill (later Hayhoe Mills), Smith&#x27;s mill later became known as Smithsville, and then Pine Grove. Another nearby settlement to the south, known as Brownsville, came into being around a mill run by John Brown on the Humber River at present-day Highway 7 and Islington Avenue, south of the original Woodbridge village. Woodbridge itself, however, did not begin to take the form of a settlement or village until the arrival of Rowland Burr in 1837, a local highly-regarded architect and builder at the time. It had been named &quot;Burwick&quot; after him prior to his arrival, and he moved there to reside in a log house in the growing village near the Humber River. He later moved south down the Humber to Weston in 1846.

Before 1855, Woodbridge was known as the village of Burwick, but was renamed because when the town applied for a post office that year, there was already a settlement named Burwick in the province. The name &quot;Woodbridge&quot; was put forward by the son-in-law of John Gamble (reeve of Vaughan at the time) after his home town in England. It was also suitable due to the many bridges in the area across the Humber River. Woodbridge eventually overtook, and later included, nearby Pine Grove after it was incorporated in 1882. Brownsville also became part of Woodbridge.

John Abell was another notable early entrepreneurial figure that shaped the village of Burwick/Woodbridge. A major industry over time, Abell Agricultural Works opened in 1862 and had 200 employees by 1874, making steam-powered agricultural equipment. The Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway arrived from Weston in 1870. This line was constructed as a narrow gauge railway through Caledon and completed to Owen Sound in 1873. Owing to financial difficulty, it was operated by the Grand Trunk Railway until 1883, when it was leased to the Canadian Pacific Railway. Conversion to standard gauge required realigning some of the track curves, particularly around Woodbridge. In 1908 this line was linked to the transcontinental route through Sudbury at Bolton, with the original TG&amp;B route between Bolton and Orangeville being abandoned in 1934.

By 1880, the settlement had two general stores, a carriage works, two churches, a school, two hotels, a library, two newspapers and a post office. As the population increased it was pressured by the citizens to add a post office so there would be no confusion with another settlement in Canada West. By 1882, Woodbridge had over a thousand residents and was incorporated as a village.

Woodbridge was also served by a branch of the Toronto Suburban Railway from 1914 until 1926. The radial railway from Weston came in to downtown Woodbridge along the west side of the Humber River, north of Humber Summit, after descending from its route along Albion Road and Kipling Avenue. It handled passenger traffic until 1925, and freight traffic (express runs for farmers shipping milk into the city) for a time later but the line was abandoned in May 1926.

Construction of Highway 7 began in the 1920s, passing south of the business section of town via the Canadian Pacific Railway underpass built in 1929-1930 (the original roadway followed a portion of McKenzie Street, and once crossed the tracks at-grade before looping south down the hill to Wallace St. and the Humber River bridge). As Woodbridge is on the Humber floodplain, Hurricane Hazel in 1954 devastated the community as the Humber River swelled from its usual width of at its narrowest point to , and left hundreds homeless and nine dead. Post-Hazel, a number of diversions and reroutings of the Humber River were made, including construction of a diversion channel north of town. At this time, the land around much of Woodbridge was agricultural. Slowly, rural homes were built in the surrounding areas.

In the 1950s, Woodbridge experienced spillover growth from suburban Metropolitan Toronto, which ultimately led to its defined area expanding far beyond the village&#x27;s then-incorporated boundaries. Later, many Italians that settled in Toronto neighbourhoods such as Little Italy, moved to the suburbs and exurbs, in particular Woodbridge. The suburban expansion began east of the Humber and East Humber and to the northeast. Prior to the expansion, the urban area was up to Kipling Avenue and to the Humber. It later expanded in the west up to present-day Martin Grove Road and north to northeast of Langstaff Road in the 1960s. It later expanded further north in the 1970s and 1980s. A drive-in theatre was situated on Langstaff Road east of Highway 27. Operating from 1967 to 1997, the site was developed for housing in 1998.

The Village of Woodbridge, along with other communities within Vaughan Township, was amalgamated to form the new Town (now City) of Vaughan in 1971.

The housing developments in the west expanded north to Langstaff. Development continued in the central part of Woodbridge (including the transformation of older stores in the village into smaller units of housing) in the early 1980s and west to Highway 27 in the late 1980s and early 90s. Development extended north to just south of Rutherford Road in the 1980s and east up to Weston Road from Highway 7 to south of Rutherford Road and south to north of the present-day Highway 407. The industrial areas began appearing first to the west and then to the southwest and east.

After the aforementioned drive-in was closed, Martin Grove Road was extended northward through the former property to serve more developments. Woodbridge Highlands was formed in the northwest, east of Highway 27 in the 1990s. In 1994 housing developments reached to Rutherford and continued until 1996 except for the northeast and the southeastern part. Condominiums were also constructed in the old village along Woodbridge Avenue. Sonoma Heights at Islington and Rutherford and Vellore (built around the former hamlet of Vellore, and today including Vellore Village and Vellore Woods) around Weston and Rutherford were developed. Development in the north end of Woodbridge then followed with Weston and Rutherford Roads becoming a major focal point for the building of additional residential units stretching north to Major Mackenzie Drive. Land on both sides of Weston Road to Major Mackenzie were completely filled in. Development continued north of Major Mackenzie (possibly outside Woodbridge&#x27;s accepted boundary) in the 2010s north to the former hamlet of Purpleville (Pine Valley Drive and Teston Road) and is still ongoing in the 2020s.

Woodbridge contains many industrial developments, mostly along Steeles east of the Humber and running north along the west side of Highway 400 east of Weston. These were mostly built during the 1980s. Another major industrial area began development west of Highway 27 in the 2000s in anticipation of the construction of Highway 427, and is still ongoing, bolstered by the opening of the highway in 2021.

Woodbridge Avenue (formerly known as Pine Street) between Islington Avenue and Kipling Avenue is historically the downtown of Woodbridge, and was once home to some of the historical buildings from the late 19th century in addition to newer 1920s–1960s buildings, but is rapidly being redeveloped. Many older shops were demolished in the late 1970s and 1980s for the Fairground Lane and Market Lane shopping developments. Two examples of historic buildings include a Tinsmith Shop and Masonic Lodge (c. 1850) and the Burwick family home (from 1844 on Pine Street) that were moved to Black Creek Pioneer Village. Market Lane remains the commercial hub of this area, with several other shops and stores lining Woodbridge Avenue.

Woodbridge was chosen as the new location for a research based mental health facility, the OCD and Anxiety Clinic of Ontario. First of its kind, it offers specialized psychological care by offering case by case care, as opposed to a volume patient care model.

An F2 tornado tore through the city of Vaughan during the Southern Ontario Tornado Outbreak on 20 August 2009. The tornado also ripped up trees, flipped cars, and left thousands of people without power. No one was killed.

==Geography==
Situated in hilly terrain of the Humber River Valley, historic Woodbridge rests at an average elevation of 200 metres between Highway 27 and Pine Valley Drive. The terrain can be described as a series of rolling hills and valleys. There are numerous valley intersections that demonstrate the geography of the area, notably Highway 7 and Islington and Highway 27 and Rutherford.

The area was mainly farmland before the onset of suburbanization in the 1970s, but the residential communities are interspersed with forests along the Humber River and its eastern branch. Today, much of the area is residential with commercial and industrial properties to the south, close to Steeles Avenue and to the east near Pine Valley Drive.

The area commonly considered to be Woodbridge today covers a very large portion (roughly one-third) of Vaughan, and is usually seen as being bounded by Highway 50 or Highway 27 to the west, Steeles Avenue to the south, Highway 400 to the east, and Major Mackenzie Drive to the north, However, its boundaries are somewhat unclear and appear to be expanding north of Major Mackenzie along Highway 400 as urbanization progresses.

===Climate===

Woodbridge has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb), with warm, humid summers and cold, snowy winters.

Summer in Woodbridge is characterized by long stretches of humid weather. Spring and autumn are transitional seasons, with generally mild or cool temperatures and alternating dry and wet periods. According to the USDA plant hardiness level, Woodbridge is 5a.

Frank Thornton Ball was born in Dulwich, London, the son of Rosina Mary (née Thornton) and William Ernest Ball. His father was an organist at St Stephen&#x27;s Church, Sydenham Hill, where Frank learned to play the organ for a short while. Music proved too difficult for him, however, and he wanted to act from an early age. 

His father, who worked in a bank, wanted him to get a &quot;proper&quot; job, so he began working in insurance after leaving Alleyn&#x27;s School. He soon enrolled at a small acting school, the London School of Dramatic Art, and took evening classes. After two years working at the insurance company, he was invited to become a day student at the acting school and persuaded his father to finance his studies.

During the Second World War, Thornton was evacuated along with the drama school, and his first job was touring with four plays in Ireland, beginning in County Tipperary. After that he served as an airman in the Royal Air Force before ending the war as an officer. From the rank of leading aircraftman he was commissioned as a pilot officer on probation (emergency) on 1 December 1944. On 1 June 1945 his commission was confirmed and he was promoted to flying officer (war substantive). He was demobilised in 1947.

==Marriage==
On 5 June 1945, Thornton married actress Beryl Evans in West Wickham. The couple had a daughter, Jane.

==Career==

Almost immediately after demobilisation, Thornton joined a repertory company. He appeared in the farce &quot;The Party Spirit&quot; in the West End alongside Robertson Hare and Ralph Lynn. His first credited screen role was in the film &quot;Radio Cab Murder&quot; (1954). After working on stage and in a few films during the 1950s, he became a familiar face on British television, specialising in comedy but initially starred in the TV series &quot;William Tell&quot; as Heinburgher in episode 23, &quot;The Surgeon&quot;. He also appeared frequently in early 1960s series such as &quot;The Four Just Men&quot; and &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Way&quot;.

He was a regular on &quot;It&#x27;s a Square World&quot;, and appeared in British sitcoms such as &quot;Hancock&quot; (&quot;The Blood Donor&quot;, 1961), &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;, &quot;Sykes&quot;, &quot;The Goodies&quot; and &quot;Love Thy Neighbour&quot;. He appeared in the &quot;Danger Man&quot; episodes &quot;The Assassin&quot; as Pepe and &quot;Find and Return&quot; as an airport official in 1961, and as a tailor in &quot;The Sentimental Agent&quot; episode &#x27;Scroll of Islam&#x27; (1963). He worked with Dick Emery, Benny Hill, Frankie Howerd, Harry Worth, Reg Varney and Spike Milligan in their comedy shows and appeared in five episodes of &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; during its first run from 1962 to 1965, and appeared in the film &quot;Steptoe and Son Ride Again&quot; (1973) and the 1973 television Christmas special, &#x27;The Party&#x27;.

From 1966 to 1968, he starred in the BBC radio comedy &quot;The Embassy Lark&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;The Navy Lark&quot;. He appeared in at least one episode of &quot;The Navy Lark&quot; as CPO Nathaniel Pertwee, filling in for Jon Pertwee who was indisposed. He also appeared in at least one episode of &quot;The Navy Lark&quot; as his character from &quot;The Embassy Lark&quot;.

In 1969, he starred in &quot;The Big Business Lark&quot; which ran for one season of thirteen episodes. This was not strictly a spin-off from &quot;The Navy Lark&quot;, other than being another &quot;Lark&quot; written by Lawrie Wyman. He continued to appear in films, mostly comedies, during the 1960s and 1970s, including &quot;Carry On Screaming!&quot;, &quot;The Early Bird&quot;, &quot;The Big Job&quot;, &quot;The Bed Sitting Room&quot;, &quot;Up the Chastity Belt&quot;, &quot;Some Will, Some Won&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; and &quot;No Sex Please, We&#x27;re British&quot;, as well as television sitcom spin-offs. He appeared in &quot;The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1970) as the one-armed doorman for the Diogenes Club. In 1974, he made a rare dramatic appearance as Prince Albert in the second episode of &quot;Fall of Eagles&quot;.

Thornton was best known for playing Captain Peacock in the long-running BBC comedy series &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; from 1972 to 1985. He reprised his role for &quot;Grace &amp; Favour&quot; from 1992 to 1993. In 1984 he starred as Sir John Treymane in the hit London musical &quot;Me and My Girl&quot;, earning rave reviews and an Olivier Award nomination. He also guest-starred in an episode of the BBC Radio series of &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; entitled &quot;Ten Seconds from Now&quot; as the BBC producer Willoughby Maxwell-Troughton, who has to coordinate the chaotic platoon as it tries to broadcast to the nation in a morale-boosting Gang Show-style extravaganza.

In 1980, he joined John Cleese in the BBC Television Shakespeare production of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;. In the 1990s, he appeared as The Major-General (Stanley) in a production of &quot;The Pirates Of Penzance&quot; at the London Palladium.

In 1997, he took the role of Herbert &quot;Truly&quot; Truelove in &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;, replacing Brian Wilde, who had suggested him for the role. He can also be seen in the film &quot;Gosford Park&quot; (2001) as Mr Burkett. Thornton was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1998, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel at Pinewood Studios.

==Death==
Thornton died from natural causes peacefully in his sleep at his home in Barnes, London, on 16 March 2013, aged 92.

<doc id="1282168" wikidata="Q5058557" url="?curid=1282168" title="Celtic music in Canada">
<text>Celtic music is primarily associated with the folk traditions of Ireland, Scotland, Brittany and Wales, as well as the popular styles derived from folk culture. In addition, a number of other areas of the world are known for the use of Celtic musical styles and techniques, including Newfoundland, and much of the folk music of Canada&#x27;s Maritimes, especially on Cape Breton Island and Prince Edward Island.

==Newfoundland==
There are very strong connections between Newfoundland folk music and Irish music, however elements of English folk music and French-Canadian and Acadian music can be heard within the style.

A very traditional strain of Irish music exists in Newfoundland, especially in the primarily Irish-Catholic communities along the southern shore.

The instrumentation in Newfoundland music includes the button accordion, guitar, violin, tin whistle and more recently the bodhrán. Many Newfoundland traditional bands also include bass guitar and drum kit. Other folk instruments such as the mandolin and bouzouki are common especially among Newfoundland bands with an Irish leaning.

Because Newfoundland is an island in the North Atlantic, many of the songs focus on the fishery and seafaring. Many songs chronicle the history of this unique people. Instrumental tune styles include jigs, reels, two steps, and polkas.

===Newfoundland musicians and musical groups===
*Fiddle players: Kelly Russell, Émile Benoît and Patrick Moran
*Button accordion players: Minnie White and Harry Hibbs
*Bodhran players: Fergus O&#x27;Byrne
*Popular Newfoundland traditional music groups: Irish Descendants and Great Big Sea.
*Irish music band in Newfoundland: Ryan&#x27;s Fancy

==Nova Scotia and Cape Breton Island==

Cape Breton Island, part of the province of Nova Scotia, is internationally known for its distinctive styles of Cape Breton fiddling, which are derived from Scottish techniques. The island has produced traditional music-based popular performers like John Allan Cameron, the Rankin Family, Natalie MacMaster, Buddy MacMaster, the Barra MacNeils, Rita MacNeil, Ashley MacIsaac and others.

In addition to the fiddle music, there is a parallel style of solo dance bagpiping and a rhythmic syncopated Celtic piano style. Recently, Highland style guitar has received some attention due to the work of Dave MacIsaac among others.

Mary Jane Lamond has attracted attention to the Island&#x27;s Gaelic song traditions of Milling Frolics (waulking songs in Scotland), Piurt à Beul (mouth music), spinning songs and more.

Irish traditional music is also very popular on the island, particularly Irish folk songs. This is especially prevalent in the communities around North Sydney and Sydney Mines due to the influence of immigrants of Newfoundland Irish descent.

==Prince Edward Island==
Prince Edward Island has long been associated with traditional Celtic music. Fiddle is the most popular instrument for traditional Celtic music in Prince Edward Island, and piano is the most popular accompaniment instrument. Celtic songs tend to be ballads or other popular songs, or new songs in the same tradition with contemporary backing. Where celidh dance is regular and popular in many rural communities, Irish or Celtic themed nightlife exists in both major cities of Charlottetown and Summerside. Organizations supporting traditional Celtic music include the PEI Fiddlers Association and the Benevolent Irish Society.

==Quebec==
There are strong ties between traditional Québécois music and the music of Brittany, Ireland, Scotland and the Maritimes. The songs generally draw more from the French tradition, whereas the dance tunes are more closely related to Celtic traditions. Fiddle and accordion are the most common lead instruments, while piano and guitar often provide accompaniment. More recently, swing has significantly influenced accompaniment styles and techniques. La Bottine Souriante is one of the most well-recognized groups which exemplifies this tradition.

==Popular music==

A number of popular Canadian Celtic rock bands are also influenced by Celtic folk traditions. The most important and influential such band was Vancouver&#x27;s Spirit of the West, whose musical marriage of traditional Irish and Scottish jigs and reels with hard rock and Britpop influences paved the way for later acts such as Great Big Sea, Enter the Haggis, the Stoaters, Captain Tractor, the Mahones, Ashley MacIsaac, Jimmy George, Mudmen, Uisce Beatha, the Paperboys and the Clumsy Lovers.

Figgy Duff and the Rankin Family served much the same role in pop music, influencing later artists such as Leahy, Mary Jane Lamond, the Barra MacNeils and Natalie MacMaster. Loreena McKennitt fuses Celtic, world, and new-age music.

<doc id="1282180" wikidata="Q284479" url="?curid=1282180" title="Barelvi movement">
<text>The Barelvi movement, also known as Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama&#x27;ah (People of the Prophet&#x27;s Way and the Community) is a Sunni revivalist movement that generally adheres to the Hanafi and Shafi&#x27;i schools of jurisprudence, the Maturidi and Ash&#x27;ari creeds, a variety of Sufi orders, including the Qadiri, Chishti, Naqshbandi and Suhrawardi orders, as well as many other orders of Sufism, and has hundreds of millions of followers across the world. They consider themselves to be the continuation of Sunni Islamic orthodoxy before the rise of Salafism and the Deobandi movement.
The Barelvi movement is spread across the globe with millions of followers, thousands of mosques, institutions, and organizations in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, the United Kingdom, South Africa and other parts of Africa, Europe, the Caribbean, and the United States. 

As of 2000, the movement had around 200 million followers globally but mainly located in Pakistan and India.

The movement claims to revive the Sunnah as embodied in the Qur’an, literature of traditions (hadith) and the way of the scholars, as the people had lapsed from the Prophetic traditions. Consequently, scholars took the duty of reminding Muslims go back to the ‘ideal’ way of Islam. The movement drew inspiration from the Sunni doctrines of Shah Abdur Rahim (1644-1719) founder of Madrasah-i Rahimiyah and one of the compiler of Fatawa-e-Alamgiri. Shah Abdur Rahim is father of Shah Waliullah Dehlawi. The movement also drew inspiration from Shah Abdul Aziz Muhaddith Dehlavi (1746 –1824) and Fazl-e-Haq Khairabadi (1796–1861) founder of the Khairabad School. 
Fazle Haq Khairabadi Islamic scholar and leader of 1857 rebellion issued &quot;fatwas&quot; against Wahhabi Ismail Dehlvi for his doctrine of God&#x27;s alleged ability to lie () from Delhi in 1825. Ismail is considered as an intellectual ancestor of Deobandis.

The movement emphasizes personal devotion and adherence to sharia and , following the four Islamic schools of thought, the usage of and Sufi practices such as veneration of and seeking help from saints among other things associated with Sufism. The movement defines itself as an authentic representative of Sunni Islam, (The people who adhere to the Prophetic Tradition and preserve the unity of the community).

Ahmed Raza Khan Barelvi (1856–1921) who was a Sunni Sufi scholar and reformer in north India wrote extensively, including the , in defense of the status of Muhammad in Islam and popular Sufi practices, and became the leader of the Barelvi movement.

==Terminology==
The Barelvi movement is also known as the . According to Oxford Reference, or Barelvi is movement developed on the basis of writings of Mawlana Ahmed Raza Khan Barelwi. The Database of Religious History refers the movement as the Ahl-e-Sunnat wa Jamaat (often, Ahl-e-Sunnat) which has a very strong presence in South Asia.

Professor Usha Sanyal, an expert on &#x27;Ahl-i Sunnat Movement&#x27;, referred the movement as Ahl-i Sunnat. She wrote that the movement refer to themselves as &#x27;Sunnis&#x27; in their literature and prefer to be known by the title of &quot;Ahle Sunnat wa Jama&#x27;at&quot; a reference to the perception of them, as forming an international majority amongst Sunnis, although Barelvi is the term used by section of media to refer to this specific movement arising from Sunni Islam.

Main leaders of Ahle Sunnat movement Imam Ahmad Raza Khan and other scholars never used the term &#x27;Barelvi&#x27; to identify themselves or their movement; they saw themselves as Sunni Muslims defending traditional Sunni beliefs from deviations. Only later was the term &#x27;Barelvi&#x27; used by the section of media and by opposition groups on the basis of the hometown Bareilly, of its main leader Imam Ahmed Raza Khan Qadri (1856–1921). The Barelvis are also called Sunni Sufis.

==History==
Islamic scholar and teacher of Ahmed Raza Khan Qadri, Maulana Naqi Ali Khan (1830-1880) had refuted the ideas of Sayyid Ahmad Barelwi (d. 1831), who was a founder of Wahhabism in India.
Naqi Ali Khan declared Sayyid Ahmad Rae Barelwi, a &#x27;Wahhabi&#x27; due to his support for Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab&#x27;s ideology.
Similarly, founder of Khairabad school, Allama Fazl-e-Haq Khairabadi in 1825 in his book &#x27;Tahqîqul-Fatâwâ&#x27; and
Allama Fazle-Rasûl Badayûnî in his book &#x27;Saiful-Jabbâr&#x27; issued Fatwas against the founders of Ahl-i Hadith and Deobandi movements Fazle Haq Khairabadi Islamic scholar and leader of 1857 rebellion issued &quot;fatwas&quot; against Wahhabi Ismail Dehlvi for his doctrine of God&#x27;s alleged ability to lie (Imkan-i-Kizb) from Delhi in 1825. Ismail is considered as an intellectual ancestor of Deobandis. This refutation of traditional scholars against newly emerging Wahabi sect influenced Sunni scholars such as Ahmed Raza Khan Qadri and paved the way for more organised movement which later came to be known as Ahle-Sunnat movement in South Asia. The movement formed as a defense of the traditional mystic practices of South Asia, which it sought to prove and support.

The Ahl-i Sunnat or Sunni Barelwi movement began in the 1880s under the leadership of Ahmad Raza Khan (1856-1921), who spent his lifetime writing fatwas (judicial opinion) and later established Islamic schools in 1904 with the Manzar-e-Islam in the Bareilly and other madrasas in Pilibhit and Lahore cities. The Barelvi movement formed as a defense of the traditional mystic practices of South Asia, which it sought to prove and support.

The movement views themselves as &quot;Sunni or Ahle Sunnat wal Jamaat&quot; and according to it main leaders of the movement including Imam Ahmad Riza Khan, did not invent new sect but defended traditional Sunni Islam. According to Ahle Sunnat scholars, Deobandis have created a new sect.
The Sunni madrasas of this movement have rarely, if ever, been involved in extremist politics and militancy.

===Propagation against the Shuddhi (Arya Samaj conversion) Movement===
Hindu Arya Samaj, through its founder Swami Dayanand Saraswati initiated converting Muslims back in to Hinduism specially in North India, and Punjab in early 1900s.
They became active in Bharatpur State and they also preached to the neo-Muslim Malkanas, in Etawah, Kanpur, Shahajahnpur, Hardoi, Meerut and Mainpuri in the western United Provinces, exhorting them to return to what they believed was their &#x27;ancestral religion&#x27;. As a result, the movement became controversial and it also antagonized the Muslims populace 
To counter this movement Indian Muslims started Islamic Dawa work among the Muslim population and challenged the Arya Samaj leaders for debates. Mufti Naeemuddin Moradabadi, Mustafa Raza Khan Qadri and Hamid Raza Khan along with a team of Ahle Sunnat scholars through Jama&#x27;at Raza-e-Mustafa worked in north Indian towns and villages against the Shuddhi movement.

The Jama&#x27;at Raza-e-Mustafa prevented around four hundred thousand conversions to Hinduism in eastern U.P and Rajasthan during its activities under anti-Shuddhi movement.
In 1917, Islamic scholar Mufti Naeem-ud-Deen Muradabadi organized the historical Jama&#x27;at Raza-e-Mustafa conference at Jamia Naeemia Moradabad U.P, with a mission to curb, and if possible reverse, the tide of re-conversions threatening the Muslim community in the wake of the Shuddhi movement.

===Shaheed Ganj Mosque Movement===

Shaheed Ganj Mosque was commissioned in 1722 during the reign of Mughal Emperor Alamgir II and built by Abdullah Khan. The construction was completed in 1753. It was located in Naulakha Bazaar area of Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. In 1762, the Bhangi misl Sikh army conquered Lahore and occupied the mosque. The Muslims were not allowed to enter and pray, although Sikhs were given the right to pray. The Sikhs built a gurdwara in the courtyard while the Mosque building was used as a residence for the Sikh priest.
On 17 April 1850, a case was in Punjab High Court. Several suits were filed between 1853 and 1883 to recover the Shaheed Ganj Mosque, but courts maintained the status quo. On 29 June 1935, the Sikhs announced that they would demolish the Shaheed Ganj Mosque. Several thousand Muslims assembled in front of the mosque to protect it. But, on the night of 7 July 1935 the Sikhs demolished the mosque, leading to riots and disorder in Lahore. 
Ahle Sunnat scholar and Sufi Peer Jamaat Ali Shah of Sialkot, Pakistan, led the Shaheed Ganj Mosque movement.
Muslims held a public meeting on 19–20 July 1935 at the Badshahi mosque, and marched directly on the Shaheedganj mosque. Police opened fire on the crowd to kill more than a dozen.

Peer Jamaat Ali Shah presided over the first session of the Conference to organize protests against the demolition. He was appointed the Chief of the protests. &quot;Shaheedganj Day&quot; was observed on 20 September 1935 under his leadership. His appointment as leader of this movement garnered support from other Sunni scholars. Fazal Shah of Jalalpur and Ghulam Mohiuddin of Golra Sharif, Zainulabedin Shah of the Gilani family from Multan and Anjuman Hizb-ul-Ahnaf from Lahore offered support to Shah&#x27;s leadership. This consensus created a religious and political base which reduced urban-rural differences. The struggle continued for several years.

===All India Sunni Conference===
Ahle Sunnat established in 1925 a body of Islamic scholars and Sufis named All India Sunni Conference, in the wake of Congress led secular Indian nationalism, changing geo-political situation of India. Islamic scholars and popular leaders Jamaat Ali Shah, Naeem-ud-Deen Muradabadi, Mustafa Raza Khan Qadri, Amjad Ali Aazmi, Abdul Hamid Qadri Badayuni, Mohammad Abdul Ghafoor Hazarvi and Pir Syed Faiz-ul Hassan Shah were the main leaders.
In 1925, its first Conference was attended by three hundred Ulema and Mashaikh. AISC focus was on Unity, brotherhood, preaching and protection of Islamic faith with a stress on need for acquiring modern education for Muslims.
The Second Conference was held in Badaun U.P in October 1935 under the Presidency of Jamaat Ali Shah. It discussed Shaheed Ganj Mosque Movement. and openly opposed Ibn Saud&#x27;s policies in Arabia, the Conference demanded to respect the Holy and sacred places of the Muslims. The third Conference held on 27–30 April 1946 at Benaras discussed the disturbed condition of the country and possible solution for the Muslims in the wake of demand for Pakistan.

*All India Muslim League
Several Sufi Barelvi scholars supported the All-India Muslim League and Pakistan&#x27;s demand claiming that Congress aimed at establishing Hindu state and arguing, that Muslims need to have their own country. Few Barelvi scholars opposed the partition of India and the League&#x27;s demand to be seen as the only representative of Indian Muslims.

Main roles played by Ahle Sunnat movement scholars and leaders: 
==Beliefs==
Like other Sunni Muslims, they base their beliefs on the Quran and Sunnah and believe in monotheism and the prophethood of Muhammad. Although Barelvis may follow any one of the Ashari and Maturidi schools of Islamic theology and one of the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi&#x27;i and Hanbali madhhabs of fiqh in addition to optionally choosing from one of the Sunni Sufi orders or tariqas, most Barelvis in South Asia follow the Maturidi school of Islamic theology, the Hanafi madhhab of fiqh and the Qadiri or Chishti Sufi orders. Barelvis in Southern parts of India such as Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu follow Shafi&#x27;i maddhab of fiqh and Ashari school of Islamic Theology. Barelvis have mostly the same beliefs and structure of Sunni Sufis around the world as they celebrate Mawlid, belief in Taqleed, belief in Sufi saints and follow Sufi orders.

==Positions==

The movement is defined by a set of theological positions that revolve around the persona of Muhammad and his special, if not exceptional, relationship and status with God.
Several beliefs and practices differentiate the movement from others (particularly Deobandis and Wahhabis including beliefs in the intercession of Muhammad, the knowledge of Muhammad, the &quot;Nur Muhammadiyya&quot; (Light of Muhammad), and whether Muhammad witnesses the actions of people.

===Intercession of Muhammad===
All jurists comprising Shafi&#x27;i, Maliki, Hanafi and Hanbali unanimously agree the on the permissibly of &quot;tawassul&quot; whether during the lifetime of Muhammad or after it.

&quot;Tawassul&quot; is a fundamental belief of all traditional Sunni movements. The belief is that Muhammad helps in this life and in the afterlife. According to this doctrine, God helps the living through Muhammad. Sunni Muslims of the Barelvi movement believe that any ability that Muhammad has to help others is from God. The help received from Muhammad is therefore considered God&#x27;s help. 
Proponents of this belief look to the Quran for proof that God prefers to help through Muhammad.
One of the titles of the Prophet is &quot;shaafi,&quot; or &quot;one who performs intercession.&quot; Other spiritual leaders who will act as intermediaries will be prophets, martyrs, &quot;huffaz&quot; of the Quran, angels, or other pious people whom God deems fit. Jesus&#x27;s intercession for believers on the Day of Judgment is mentioned in the Quran (5:16-18), as well.
They also believe that, on the Day of Judgement, Muhammad will intercede on behalf of his followers, and God will forgive them their sins and allow them to enter &quot;Jannah&quot; (&quot;paradise&quot;).
The belief that Muhammad provides support to believers is a common theme within classical Sunni literature. 
The Quran says, 
&quot;O you who believe! Fear Allah and seek a wasila to him (5:35).&quot; Further, the Quran says, 
&quot;We sent not the Messenger, but to be obeyed, in accordance with the will of Allah. If they had only, when they were unjust to themselves, come to the Messenger and asked Allah&#x27;s forgiveness, and the Messenger had (also) asked forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah indeed Oft-returning, Most Merciful. (Al-Qur&#x27;an, Surah an-Nisa, 4:64)&quot;

The belief that Muhammad intercedes is found in various Hadith, as well.
&quot;A Bedouin of the desert visited the Prophet&#x27;s tomb and greeted the Prophet, addressing him directly as if he were alive. &quot;Peace upon you, Messenger of God!&quot; Then he said, &quot;I heard the word of God &#x27;If, when they had wronged themselves . . .,&#x27; I came to you seeking pardon for my mistakes, longing for your intercession with our Lord!&quot; The Bedouin then recited a poem in praise of the Prophet and departed. The person who witnessed the story says that he fell asleep, and in a dream he saw the Prophet saying to him, &quot;O &#x27;Utbi, rejoin our brother the Bedouin and announce [to] him the good news that God has pardoned him!&quot;&quot;

Syrian Islamic scholars Salih al-Nu&#x27;man, Abu Sulayman Suhayl al-Zabibi, and Mustafa ibn Ahmad al-Hasan al-Shatti al-Hanbali al-Athari al-Dimashqi have similarly released &quot;fatwas&quot; in support of the belief.

Al-Suyuti, in his book &quot;History of the Caliphs&quot;, also reports Caliph Umar’s prayer for rain after the death of Muhammad, and specifies that on that occasion, Umar was wearing his mantle (&quot;al-burda&quot;)a detail confirming his &quot;tawassul&quot; through Muhammad. Sahih al-Bukhari narrates a similar situation as: 

A Hadith states that on that day people will be running to and fro looking for an intercessor, until they come to Muhammad, who will answer, &quot;I am for intercession&quot;. The Lord will then ask him to &quot;...intercede, for your intercession will be heard&quot; (Bukhari). 
Sunni Muslims of this movement also commonly say &quot;Ya Rasul Allah&quot; (&#x27;O Messenger of Allah&#x27;), addressing Muhammad in the present tense with the belief that he is able to listen. They believe that Muhammad is a Rahmah (mercy) to all creation as mentioned in the Quran . Muhammad therefore is a means by which God expresses his attribute, Ar-Rahman, to creation.

===Light of Muhammad (Nur Muhammadiyya)===

A central doctrine of this movement is that Muhammad is both human and (Noor) light. Muhammad&#x27;s physical birth was preceded by his existence as a light which predates creation. The primordial reality of Muhammad existed before creation, and God created for the sake of Muhammad. Adherents of this doctrine believe that the word &quot;Nur&quot; (light) in the Quran refers to Muhammad.

Sahl al-Tustari, the ninth-century Sunni Quran commentator, describes the creation of Muhammad&#x27;s primordial light in his tafsir. Mansur Al-Hallaj (al-Tustari&#x27;s student) affirms this doctrine in his book, &quot;Ta Sin Al-Siraj&quot;:

According to &quot;Stūdīyā Islāmīkā&quot;, all Sufi orders are united in the belief in the light of Muhammad.

=== Muhammad as witness ===
Another central doctrine of this movement is that Muhammad is a viewer and witness (حاضر و ناظر, Ḥāḍir-o nāẓir) actions of people. The doctrine appears in works predating the movement, such as Sayyid Uthman Bukhari&#x27;s (d. ca. 1687) &quot;Jawahir al-Quliya&quot; (&quot;Jewels of the Friends of God&quot;), describing how Sufis may experience the presence of Muhammad. Proponents of this doctrine assert that the term &quot;Shahid&quot; (witness) in the Quran (, ) refers to this ability of Muhammad, and cite hadiths to support it.

This concept was interpreted by Shah Abdul Aziz in Tafsir Azizi in these words: &quot;The Prophet is observing everybody, knows their good and bad deeds, and knows the strength of faith (Imaan) of every individual Muslim and what has hindered his spiritual progress.&quot;

Hafiz Ibn Kathir says: &quot;You are witness of the oneness of Allah Almighty and that there is no God except Allah. You will bear evidence about the actions and deed of whole mankind on the day of judgment.
(Tafseer Ibne Katheer, Vol. 3, Page 497).

===Muhammad&#x27;s Knowledge of the Unseen (Ilm-e-Ghaib)===
A fundamental Sunni Barelvi belief is that Muhammad has knowledge of the unseen, which is granted him by Allah (&quot;ata&#x27;e&quot;) and is not equal to God&#x27;s knowledge. This relates to the concept of &quot;Ummi&quot; as mentioned in the Quran (). This movement does not interpret this word as &quot;unlettered&quot; or &quot;illiterate&quot;, but &quot;untaught&quot;. Muhammad learns not from humankind, but from Allah; his knowledge is universal, encompassing the seen and unseen realms. This belief predates this movement, and is found in Sunni books such as Rumi&#x27;s &quot;Fihi Ma Fihi&quot;:
Allah has sent down to you the Book and Wisdom and has taught to you what you did not know, and great is the grace of Allah upon you&quot; [Sura an-Nisa, verse 113].

Imam Jalal udin Al-Suyuti writes: (Taught to you what you did not know) means that Allah Most High has told the Prophet (may Allah bless him and grant him peace) of Ahkam and Unseen.

Qur&#x27;an states: This is of the tidings of the Unseen which We inspire in thee (Muhammad). Thou thyself knewest it not, nor did thy folk (know it) before this. Then have patience. Lo! the sequel is for those who ward off (evil).[Surah Hud (11), verse 49]
Qur&#x27;an states: Nor will He disclose to you the secrets of the Unseen. &quot;But He chooses of His Apostles [for the purpose].[Sura Aali-Imran, verse 179]

===Practices===
*Public celebration of Muhammad&#x27;s birthday, a practice of Sunni majority world wide
*Tawassul-(Veneration of pious). This consists of the intervention of an ascending, linked and unbroken chain of holy persons claimed to reach ultimately to Muhammad who Barelvis believe intercede on their behalf with God.
The Qur&#x27;an states: This verse raised the question as to whether or not Muhammad&#x27;s mediation was still possible after his death. A number of Islamic scholars including Al-Nawawi, Ibn Kathir and Ibn al-Athir in his exegesis said: &quot;A Bedouin of the desert visited the Prophet’s tomb and greeted the Prophet, addressing him directly as if he were alive. &quot;Peace upon you, Messenger of God!&quot; Then he said, &quot;I heard the word of God ‘If, when they had wronged themselves . . .,’ I came to you seeking pardon for my mistakes, longing for your intercession with our Lord!&quot; The Bedouin then recited a poem in praise of Muhammad and departed. The person who witnessed the story says that he fell asleep, and in a dream he saw Muhammad saying to him, “O ‘Utbi, rejoin our brother the Bedouin and announce [to] him the good news that God has pardoned him!”&quot;

All jurists comprising Ja&#x27;fari, Shafi&#x27;i, Maliki, Hanafi and Hanbali are unanimous on the permissibility of tawassul whether during the lifetime of Muhammad or after his death. 
Syrian Islamic scholars Salih al-Nu`man, Abu Sulayman Suhayl al-Zabibi, and Mustafa ibn Ahmad al-Hasan al-Shatti al-Hanbali al-Athari al-Dimashqi have similarly released Fatwas in support of the practice.

Caliph Umar&#x27;s prayer for rain after the death of Muhammad and specifies that on that occasion ‘Umar was wearing his mantle (al-burda), a detail confirming his &quot;tawassul&quot; through Muhammad at that occasion, as reported by Al-Suyuti in his book &quot;History of the Caliphs&quot;. Sahih al-Bukhari narrates similar situation as: 

*Visiting the tombs of Muhammad, his companions and pious Muslims, an act they believe is supported by the Quran, Sunnah and the acts of the companions.
More than any other tomb in the Islamic world, the shrine of Muhammad is considered a source of blessings for the visitor. A hadith of the Islamic prophet Muhammad states that, &quot;He who visits my grave will be entitled to my intercession&quot; and in a different version &quot;I will intercede for those who have visited me or my tomb.&quot; Visiting Muhammad&#x27;s tomb after the pilgrimage is considered by the majority of Sunni legal scholars to be recommended.

The early scholars of the salaf, Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (d. 241 AH), Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh (d. 238 SH), Abd Allah ibn al-Mubarak (d. 189 AH) and Imam Shafi&#x27;i (d. 204 AH) all permitted the practice of &quot;Ziyarah&quot; to Muhammad&#x27;s tomb.

According to the Hanbali scholar Al-Hasan ibn &#x27;Ali al-Barbahari (d. 275 AH), it is also obligatory to send salutations (salam) upon Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab after having sent salutations upon Muhammad.

The &quot;hadith&quot; scholar Qadi Ayyad (d. 544 AH) stated that visiting Muhammad was &quot;a sunna of the Muslims on which there was consensus, and a good and desirable deed.&quot;

Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (d. 852 AH) explicitly stated that travelling to visit the tomb of Muhammad was &quot;one of the best of actions and the noblest of pious deeds with which one draws near to God, and its legitimacy is a matter of consensus.&quot;

Similarly, Ibn Qudamah (d. 620 AH) considered &quot;Ziyarat&quot; of Muhammad to be recommended and also seeking intercession directly from Muhammad at his grave. Other historic scholars who recommended &quot;Ziyarah&quot; include Imam al-Ghazali (d. 505 AH), Imam Nawawi (d. 676 AH) and Muhammad al-Munawi (d. 1031 AH). The tombs of other Muslim religious figures are also respected. The son of Ahmad ibn Hanbal named Abdullah, one of the primary jurists of Sunnism, reportedly stated that he would prefer to be buried near the shrine of a saintly person than his own father.

*Group dhikr: synchronized movements of the body while chanting the names of God. Some groups, notably those in the Sufi Chishti Order, sing Qawwali; others do not use musical instruments.
*Letting the beard grow. The four schools of fiqh generally (with the exception of the Shafi and Hanbali school of fiqh) consider it unlawful to trim a beard less than a fistful length.
=== Sufi tradition ===
Sufism is a fundamental aspect of this movement. Imam Ahmad Raza Khan Barelvi was part of the Qadri tariqa and pledged &quot;bay&#x27;ah&quot; (allegiance) to Sayyid Shah Al ur-Rasul Marehrawi. Ahmad Raza Khan Barelvi instructed his followers in Sufi beliefs and practices. Traditional Sufi practices, such as devotion to Muhammad and the veneration of &quot;walis&quot;, remain an integral part of the movement (which defended the Sufi status quo in South Asia. They were at the forefront of defending Sufi doctrines, such as the celebration of the birth of Muhammad and tawassul.

The wider Ahle Sunnat Wal jamaat Barelvi movement was sustained and connected through thousands of Sufi Urs festivals at Dargahs/shrines in south Asia, as well as in the Britain and elsewhere.

Ahmad Raza Khan Qadri and many Sunni scholars countered Deobandi, Ahl-i Hadith and Wahabi hardliners which resulted in the institutionalization of diverse Sufi movements in many countries of the world.

== Presence ==
Barelvi demographics are more than 200 million around the world. The Barelvi movement is spread across the globe with millions of followers, thousands of mosques, institutions and organizations in South Asia, parts of Africa and Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States.

===India===
&quot;India Today&quot; estimated that over two-thirds of Muslims in India adhere to the Sufi-oriented Ahle Sunnat (Barelvi) movement.

====Bareilly Sharif Dargah====
Markaz-e-Ahle Sunnah at Dargah Ala Hazrat is one of the main centers of Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat movement in south Asia. Millions of people turned to seek guidance in Islamic matters towards this center of Islamic learning. Bareilly city has been the heart-throb of Sunni Muslims since 1870 when revered Islamic Scholar Ala Hazrat Imam Ahmed Raza Khan established Fatwa committee under the guidance of his father Naqi Ali Khan. Later, his son Maulana Hamid Raza Khan and Mufti Azam-e-Hind Mustafa Raza Khan continued Fatwa work.

====Stand against the forced sterilization actions of the government====
In the mid-70s, during The Emergency (India), on the advice of Sanjay Gandhi, son of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, the Indian government tried to force men to undergo vasectomies (Nasbandi). Huge but unconfirmed numbers of young men were forcibly sterilized. Government officials, and even school teachers, were ordered to induce a predetermined number of males to endure vasectomies or Nasbandi, as they were called. Indian Muslims were finding it difficult to oppose this harsh government action because at the time, it was the emergency and the powers were totally in the hands of Prime Minister Mufti-e-Azam Mustafa Raza Khan. At that time, he acted without pressure and passed a verdict in which he banned vasectomies, declaring them un-Islamic. He published his judicial verdict and circulated it all over India, giving Muslims a sigh of relief but triggering tension between Muslims and the Indian government. The government unsuccessfully tried to get the Fatwa withdrawn and within two years, Indira Gandhi lost the Parliamentary elections.

====Shah Bano Case Movement====
Indian Supreme Court in case of Mohd. Ahmed Khan v. Shah Bano Begum delivered a judgment favouring maintenance given to an aggrieved divorced Muslim woman. Maulana Obaidullah Khan Azmi, Allama Yaseen Akhtar Misbahi and some other Sunni leaders started movement against the judgment. In 1985, Misbahi was elected as the vice president of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, where he advocated for the protection of Shariat. They led various mass protests in various parts of the country specially in Mumbai. Speeches of Obaidullah Khan Azmi were widely circulated and he had become a most sought after speaker for anti-Shah Bano case meetings in Mumbai. Mumbai police filed case against the Maulana and expelled him from Mumbai declaring his speeches inflammatory. 
Then, the government under pressure enacted a law with given the right to maintenance for the period of &quot;iddat&quot; after the divorce, and shifting the onus of maintaining her to her relatives or the Waqf Board.

====Scholars, Organizations and Institutions====


At present chief of dargah Ala Hazrat Subhan Raza Khan, chief Qazi Asjad Raza Khan, Ziaul Mustafa Razvi Qadri, Muhammad Madni Ashraf Ashrafi Al-Jilani, Syed Ameen Mian Qaudri of Barkatiya Sufi chain, Shaikh Aboobacker Ahmad of All India Sunni Jamiatul Ulma, Sayyid Ibraheem Khaleel Al Bukhari, Abdul Rashid Dawoodi and Mufti Mukarram Ahmad of Royal Mosque Fatehpuri Masjid Delhi are some of the influential Sunni leaders of India. 
Bareilly based All India Jama&#x27;at Raza-e-Mustafa, Raza Academy, Mumbai and Kerala based All India Sunni Jamiyyathul Ulama are influential bodies. Idara-e-Shariah(Shara&#x27;ai Council) is highest body in Bihar, Jharkhand and Orrissa. All India Ulema and Mashaikh Board and All India Tanzeem Ulama-e-Islam also works among Sunnis.
The Grand Mufti of India is the senior and influential religious authority of the Islamic Community of India. The incumbent is Shafi Sunni scholar Sheikh Abubakr Ahmad, general secretary of All India Sunni Jamiyyathul Ulama, who was conferred the title in February 2019 at the Ghareeb Nawaz Peace Conference held at Ramlila Maidan, New Delhi, organised by the All India Tanzeem Ulama-e-Islam.
For Islamic missionary activities, Sunni Dawate Islami (SDI) is an important Islamic preaching movement in India. It is working in at least 20 countries around the world. Muhammad Shakir Ali Noori founded the movement in Mumbai. It has a large network of (Dawah workers) preachers in India and in other countries. Sunni Dawat-e-Islami has established many modern and religious educational institutions around India and some in other parts of the world.

It holds an annual conference International Sunni Ijtema in Mumbai, which is said to be attended by between 150,000 and 300,000 people; the first day (Friday) is reserved for women. Followers of Sunni Dawate Islami wear white turbans.

In 2008, SDI had a European headquarters at Noor Hall in Preston, England, and centres in some other English towns, including: Blackburn, Bolton, Leicester and Manchester. SDI also had a North American headquarters in Chicago. By 2008, SDI had founded 12 madrasas in India. 
In 2020, SDI says that in India it manages 50 madrasas and 15 schools that teach in English. SDI says it has an educational centre in Bolton (England), and an educational centre in Mauritius.

====Network of madrasas====

Al Jamiatul Ashrafia, Azamgarh, Jamia Naeemia Moradabad, Jamia Amjadia Rizvia, Ghosi Al-Jame-atul-Islamia, Mau, Markazu Saquafathi Sunniyya, Ma&#x27;din, Jamia Saadiya Kerala and Jamia Nizamia, Hyderabad are some of the movement&#x27;s most notable institutions. 
Markazu Saquafathi Sunniyya or Jamia Markaz operates more than 50 institutions and it also operates many sub-centers across the world.
Al Jamiatul Ashrafia is considered the main institution of learning in northern India and it is attended by thousands of students who come from different parts of the country.
===Pakistan===

Sufism has strong links to South Asia dating back to the eighth and ninth centuries and preaches religious tolerance, encourages spiritual over ritualistic practicing of Islam, and encourages diversity. The Ahle Sunnat Barelvi movement has originated from South Asian Sufism itself. The religious and political leaders of this movement were followers of Sufism and lead the masses in to revivalist Sunni movement.

&quot;Time&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; gave assessments that vast majority of Muslims in Pakistan follow Ahle Sunnat Barelvi movement. Political scientist Rohan Bedi estimated that 60% of Pakistani Muslims follow this movement. 
The movement form a majority in the most populous state Punjab, Sindh and Azad Kashmir regions of Pakistan.

In the aftermath of the 1948 Partition, they formed an association to represent the movement in Pakistan, called Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan (JUP). The ulema have advocated application of sharia law across the country.

They are largest Muslim sect in Pakistan and have several organizations and parties which are Dawat e Islami International, Tanzeem ul Madaris Ahle Sunnat, Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan, Sunni Tehreek (ST), Jamaat Ahle Sunnat,Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT), Sunni Ittehad Council, Tehreek Labaik Ya Rasool Allah (TLYR) and Majlis-e-Tahaffuz-e-Khatme Nabuwwat are some of the leading organisations of Pakistani Sunni Muslims.

Jamia Nizamia Ghousia, Jamia Naeemia Lahore and Dar-ul-Madinah Schools are some of the leading seminaries of this movement.

====Finality of Prophethood movement====

In 1950, scholars of Ahle Sunnat Barelvi movement initiated a sub-movement named, &#x27;Majlis-e-Tahaffuz-e-Khatme Nabuwwat&#x27; the history of which can be traced back to the 1880s when Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian proclaimed himself to be a prophet in Islam. This proclamation of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was against the tenets of Islam and created a schism in the Muslim community. Therefore, with the aim to protect the belief in the finality of prophethood of Muhammad based on their concept of Khatam an-Nabiyyin. The movement launched countrywide campaigns and protests to declare Ahmadis as non-Muslims. 
Mohammad Abdul Ghafoor Hazarvi Zafar Ali Khan, Abdul Hamid Qadri Badayuni, Khwaja Qamar ul Din Sialvi, Syed Faiz-ul Hassan Shah, Ahmad Saeed Kazmi, Abdul Sattar Khan Niazi, Pir of Manki Sharif Amin ul-Hasanat, Muhammad Karam Shah al-Azhari, Sardar Ahmad Qadri and Muhammad Hussain Naeemi were the leaders of the movement.

Scholars of various schools of thought under the leadership of Shah Ahmad Noorani Siddiqui, who was president of Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan initiated a successful campaign against the Ahmadis and compelled the National Assembly to declare Ahmadis as non-Muslims. And such a clause was inserted in the 1973 Constitution of Pakistan by Second Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan.
After meeting the first agenda, Khatme-Nabuwat started the next phase of their campaign – to bar Ahmadis from using the title of Muslim. The then president General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq passed an ordinance in 1984 amending the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) commonly known as Ordinance XX.
Sunni leaders Shaikh ul Quran Allama Ghulam Ali Okarvi, Muhammad Shafee Okarvi, Syed Shujaat Ali Qadri, Iftikharul Hasan Shah and Khalid Hasan Shah were the main leaders of this sub-movement.

====Madarsa Network in Pakistan====

Tanzeem-ul-Madaris Ahl-e-Sunnat ASJ education board is the central organisation to register Ahle Sunnat Barelvi Madarsas. The board follows Sunni Barelvi ideology and is opponent of the Wahabi doctrine.

As per Islam online, around 10,000 madrassas are managed by Tanzeem-ul-Madaris Pakistan. 
Tahzibul Akhbar in its report on the educational services of Religious institutions has estimated that Tanzeem has 3000 institutions in Khyber Pakhtunwa and 1000 in the area of Hazara.

Muhammad Ramzan, in his report on Madarsas has stated that Tanzeem has most has maximum 5584 Madarsas in Punjab state in comparison to others. &#x27;In Lahore 336, Sheikhupura 336, Gujranwala 633, Rawalpindi 387, Faisalabad 675, Sargodha 461, Multan 944, Sahiwal 458, D.G.Khan 605, Bahawalpur 749 madarsa are affiliated with the Tanzeem&#x27;. According to Rizwan, &#x27;the Madarsas of Tanzeem are rarely involved in militancy which is maximum in Deobandis. In population, Barelvis or traditional Sunnis outnumber all other sects combined. They are about 53.4% of total population of the province&#x27;.

==== Stand on blasphemy laws ====

The movement has opposed any change in the Pakistani blasphemy laws. They have always uphold the blasphemy as highest crime and endorsed the strict punishment for blasphemers.
Punjab governor Salman Taseer was assassinated on 4 January 2011 by Mumtaz Qadri, a member of the Barelvi group Dawat-e-Islami, due to Taseer&#x27;s opposition to Pakistan&#x27;s blasphemy laws. Over five hundred scholars supported Qadri and a boycott of Taseer&#x27;s funeral.

====Persecution====

They have been targeted and killed by radical Deobandi groups in Pakistan such as the TTP, SSP, LeJ, etc. Suicide attacks, vandalism and destruction of sites considered holy to those in the Sunni Barelvi movement have been perpetrated by Deobandi extremist groups. This includes attacks, destruction and vandalism of Sufi Data Darbar in Lahore, Abdullah Shah Ghazi&#x27;s tomb in Karachi, Khal Magasi in Balochistan, and Rahman Baba&#x27;s tomb in Peshawar. The murder of various Barelvi leaders have also been committed by Deobandi terrorists.
The clerics claim that there is a bias against them by various Pakistani establishments such as the DHA, who tend to appoint Deobandi Imams for mosques in their housing complexes rather than Barelvi ones. Historical landmarks such as Badshahi Masjid also have Deobandi Imams, which is a fact that has been used as evidence by Barelvi clerics for bias against Barelvis in Pakistan. The &quot;Milade Mustafa Welfare Society&quot; has asserted that the Religious Affairs Department of DHA interferes with Human Resources to ensure that Deobandi Imams are selected for mosques in their housing complex.

During the 1990s and 2000s, sporadic violence resulted from disputes between Barelvis and Deobandis over control of Pakistani mosques. The conflict came to a head in May 2001, when sectarian riots broke out after the assassination of Sunni Tehreek leader Saleem Qadri. In April 2006 in Karachi, a bomb attack on a Barelvi gathering celebrating Muhammad&#x27;s birthday killed 57 people, including several Sunni Tehreek leaders. 
Militants believed to be affiliated with the Taliban and Sipah-e-Sahaba attacked Barelvis celebrating &quot;Mawlid&quot; in Faisalabad and Dera Ismail Khan on 27 February 2010, sparking tensions between the groups.

In 2021, the Pakistani government officially banned the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan and is severely cracking down on Sunni Muslim political voices of the Barelvi movement. Deobandi political parties like Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F), however, are still freely operating and even supported by elements within the Pakistani government.

===Bangladesh===

Barelvis form a sizeable portion of the Hanafi communities in Bangladesh. It identifies under the banner of Ahl-e-Sunnat Wal Jama&#x27;at (ASWJ) along with other Sufi groups which have strong bases in Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet such as the Maizbhandaria, and this serves as a central organization for the Barelvi ulema in Bangladesh.

A majority of Bangladeshi Muslims perceive Sufis as a source of spiritual wisdom and guidance and their Khanqahs and Dargahs as nerve centers of Muslim society

Muslims generally follow Sufi traditions in Sri Lanka. The Al-Fassi family|Fassiya ash Shazuliya tariqa, which has its headquarters in Ummu Zavaya in M.J.M. Laffir mawatha, Colombo, supported by the Al-Fassi family in the 1870s, is the most prevalent Sufi order among the Sri Lankan Muslims followed by Aroosiyathul qadiriya.

In the pre-independence period the two largest Sri Lankan Sufi orders were associated with rival Muslim gem-trading families and ethnic associations in the west coast region, the Qadiriya order allied with N.D.H. Abdul Gaffoor and the All Ceylon Muslim League, and the Shazu-liya order supporting M. Macan Markar and the All Ceylon Moors Association (Wagner 1990, 8385).
Sri Lankan Moors also share with their co-religionists across South Asia a devotion to Sufi saints (avuliyā) and an engagement with local chapters of Sufi orders (tāriqā). Two most widely popular Sufi saints are Abd’al Qādir Jīlanī (d.1166 C.E., buried in Baghdad) and Hazrat Shahul Hamid (d. 1579 C.E., buried in Nagoor [Nagore], on the Tamil nadu coast near Nagapattinam).

Sunni scholar Muhammad Abdul Aleem Siddiqi built Hanafi Masjid in Colombo for Sri Lankan Muslims.
Sri Lankan Sufi Sunnis identify with organizations such as Hubbul Awliya (Love of the Saint) and Muslims across the island who loosely identify themselves as Ahlus Sunnah wa Jamaat (traditional Muslims) which that connotes the more saint-friendly Barelvi movement (versus the Deobandi)identity in North India.

The annual festival cycle at the Badriya Mosque still commemorates familiar saints such as Abdul Qadir Jilani, Ahmed Rifai, and Shahul Hamid of Nagoor, as well as the popular Tangal from Androth, Abdul Rashid.

While Masjid Al Badriyeen, Nawala, Talayan Bawa Masjid Ratmalana are some other notable mosques outside Colombo.
Missionary organisation Dawat-e-Islami is also actively working in various parts of the Sri Lanka.

==Relations with other Muslim movements==
The Ahle Sunnat Barelvi movement&#x27;s relations with Sunni Sufi scholars from various countries have been cordial. The only movements which the Ahle Sunnat Barelvi movement has no relations with are Wahabis/Deobandis. Wahabis/Deobandis were declared to be the enemies of Ahle Sunnah Wal Jama&#x27;ah during the 2016 international conference on Sunni Islam in Grozny.

===2016 international conference on Sunni Islam in Grozny===
The scholars who followed Ahle Sunnat wal Jamaat from India and Pakistan namely Sheikh Abubakr Ahmad, Grand Mufti of India, Shaikh Anwar Ahmad al- Baghdadi and Mufti Muḥammad Muneeb-ur-Rehman, Grand Mufti of Pakistan, participated in International Conference on Sunni Islam in Chechen Republic at Grozny in 2016. The conference was convened to define the term &quot;Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama&#x27;ah&quot;, i.e. who are &quot;the people of Sunnah and majority Muslim community&quot;, and to oppose Salafi/Wahabi groups and their ideology. It was attended by 200 notable Muslim scholars from 30 countries which includes Ahmed el-Tayeb (Grand Imam of Al-Azhar), Shawki Allam (Grand Mufti of Egypt), Ali Gomaa (former Grand Mufti of Egypt), Habib Ali al-Jifri among others. It identified Salafism/Wahhabism as a dangerous and misguided sect, along with the extremist groups, such as ISIS, Hizb ut-Tahrir, the Muslim Brotherhood and others.
The conference definition stated:
&quot;Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama&#x27;ah are the Ash&#x27;arites and Maturidis (adherents of the theological systems of Imam Abu Mansur al-Maturidi and Imam Abu al-Hasan al-Ash&#x27;ari). In matters of belief, they are followers of any of the four schools of thought (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi&#x27;i or Hanbali) and are also the followers of the Sufism of Imam Junaid al-Baghdadi in doctrines, manners and [spiritual] purification.&quot; This definition was in accordance with the ideology of Ahle Sunnat Barelvi movement. The relations with Deobandi and Wahabism have been strained; Scholars of Ahle Sunnat declared Deoband&#x27;s founders and Ahl-e-Hadith scholars as &quot;Gustakh-e-Rasool&quot; (the one who blasphemes against the prophet) and infidels and apostates due to their certain writings found to be against Muhammad.
=== Opposition to terrorism ===

They opposes South Asian Deobandi Taliban movements, organizing rallies and protests in India and Pakistan and condemning what they view as unjustified sectarian violence. The Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), an alliance of eight Sunni organizations, launched the Save Pakistan Movement to slow Talibanisation. Calling the Taliban a product of global anti-Islamic conspiracies, SIC leaders accused the Taliban of playing into the hands of the United States to divide Muslims and degrade Islam. Supporting this movement, Pakistani Minister of Foreign Affairs Shah Mehmood Qureshi said: &quot;The Sunni Tehreek has decided to activate itself against Talibanisation in the country. A national consensus against terrorism is emerging across the country.&quot;
In 2009, Islamic scholar Sarfraz Ahmed Naeemi issued a fatwa denouncing suicide bombings and criticized Taliban leader Sufi Muhammad by saying that he &quot;should wear bangles if he is hiding like a woman&quot;. Naeemi added, &quot;Those who commit suicide attacks for attaining paradise will go to hell, as they kill many innocent people&quot;, and was later killed by a suicide bomber.
In India, the Sunni Barelvi community has issued of a fatwa against terrorism, with concerns expressed over activities of Wahabis in New Delhi at All India Sunni Conference in Feb 2016.

It also runs the Faroe Islands national teams for men and women. Established in 1979, it is based in Tórshavn.

Organized football has been played in the Faroes since late 19th century. The first Faroese national football league (Meistaradeildin) was held in 1942. From 1942 until 1978, all Faroese football was governed by ÍSF (the Faroese Sports Association). On 13 January 1979, the Faroese Football Association was established. At first it worked with organizing Faroese football. The first Faroese national football league for women was held in 1985.

In the 1980s, the Faroese Football Association started training coaches and managers. At first it was done with help from Denmark, but since the mid-1990s, this training has been under full Faroese responsibility.

<text>Rachel Lindsay Rene Bush and Sidney Robyn Danae Bush (born May 25, 1970) are American former child actresses, best known for their combined (alternating) role as Carrie Ingalls, in the drama series &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;. They are identical twin sisters, born in Los Angeles to actor Billy Green Bush and Carole Kay Bush. Their older brother, Clay, is also an actor.

==Careers ==
Prior to &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; debuting on September 11, 1974, they starred in the made-for-television drama &quot;Sunshine&quot; (1973), as Jill Hayden. In 1978, in the season-five &quot;Little House&quot; episode &quot;The Godsister&quot;, the sisters are shown together playing different characters. The twins&#x27; final appearance on the series was on May 10, 1982.

In the final season of the show, the absence of the family members (except Laura) was explained by their relocation to Burr Oak, Iowa, in search of a better life. However, several months later, the series was cancelled. In the opening credits, there was a scene of one of the twins running in a meadow with the credit &quot;Lindsay Sidney Greenbush&quot;.

==Post-&quot;Little House&quot;==

In 1983, Lindsay guest starred in a &quot;Matt Houston&quot; episode as an abuse victim. Sidney starred in the film &quot;Hambone and Hillie&quot; in 1983. The twins starred in commercials for, among others, Doublemint gum, Mattel Toys, and Kentucky Fried Chicken. The twins decided to retire from acting and continue their studies at public school. They graduated from Santa Monica High in 1988.

==Personal lives==

Sidney was married to horse breeder William &quot;Rocky&quot; Foster for nine years, until his death at age 55 in 2009.

Lindsay has been married to Daniel Sanchez since 2014. They originally met on the &quot;Little House&quot; set at Big Sky Ranch in Simi Valley (where exterior scenes were filmed) when she was a small child and he was a teenager who lived nearby. She has said Michael Landon allowed him to watch the filming at Big Sky Ranch. Decades later, they met again and married in the same spot where they first met.

<text>Badakhshan Province (Persian/Pashto: بدخشان) is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan, located in the northeastern part of the country. It is bordered by Tajikistan&#x27;s Gorno-Badakhshan in the north and the Pakistani regions of Lower and Upper Chitral and Gilgit-Baltistan in the southeast. The province also has Afghanistan&#x27;s only border with China spanning 91 kilometers (57 miles) in the eastern side of the province via its Wakhan District.

It is part of a broader historical Badakhshan region, parts of which now also lie in Tajikistan and China. The province contains 22 districts, over 1,200 villages and approximately 1,055,000 people. Fayzabad serves as the provincial capital. Resistance activity has been reported in the province since the 2021 Taliban takeover of Afghanistan.

== Etymology ==

During the Sassanids&#x27; reign it was called &quot;bidix&quot;, and in Parthian times &quot;bthšy&quot;. In Sassanid manuscripts found in Ka&#x27;ba-ye Zartosht it was called &quot;Bałasakan&quot;. In Chinese sources from the 7th century onwards it was called &quot;Po-to-chang-na&quot;.

==Geography==

Badakhshan is bordered by Takhar Province to the west, Panjshir Province to the south west, Nuristan Province to the south, Tajikistan to the north and east (that nation&#x27;s Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province and Khatlon Province), China through a long spur called the Wakhan Corridor to the east, and Pakistan to the south-east (Chitral and Gilgit-Baltistan). The total area of Badakhshan is , most of which is occupied by the Hindu Kush and Pamir mountain ranges.

According to the World Wildlife Fund, Badakhshan contains temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands, as well as Gissaro-Alai open woodlands along the Pamir River. Common plants found in these areas include pistachio, almond, walnut, apple, juniper, and sagebrush.

Montane grasslands and shrublands are existent in the province, with the Hindu Kush alpine meadow in the high mountains in the northern and southwestern regions.

The Wakhan corridor contains two montane grassland and shrubland regions: the Karakoram-West Tibetan Plateau alpine steppe and in the Pamir Mountains and Kuh-e Safed Khers in Darwaz region.

South of Fayzabad the terrain becomes dominated by deserts and xeric shrublands. Common vegetation includes thorny bushes, zizyphus, acacia, and Amygdatus.
Paropamisus xeric woodlands can be found in the province&#x27;s northwestern and central areas. Common vegetation includes almond, pistachio, willows, and sea-buckthorn.

==History==

Badakhshan was an independent country until late 18th century before it was ruled by the Durranis followed by the Barakzai dynasty, and was untouched by the British during the three Anglo-Afghan Wars that were fought in the 19th and 20th centuries, which allowed the Emanzai Tribe to rise in regional control. It remained peaceful for about 100 years until the 1980s Soviet–Afghan War at which point the Mujahideen began a rebellion against the central Afghan government.

During the 1990s, much of the area was controlled by forces loyal to Burhanuddin Rabbani and Ahmad Shah Massoud, who were &quot;de facto&quot; the national government until 1996. Badakhshan was the only province that the Taliban did not conquer during their rule from 1996 to 2001. However, during the course of the wars a non-Taliban Islamic emirate was established in Badakhshan by Mawlawi Shariqi, paralleling the Islamic Revolutionary State of Afghanistan in neighboring Nuristan. Rabbani, a Badakhshan native, and Massoud were the last remnants of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance during the peak of Taliban control in 2001.

Badakhshan was thus one of the few provinces of the country that witnessed little insurgency in the Afghan wars – however, during the 2010s Taliban insurgents managed to attack and take control of several districts in the province.

On 26 October 2015, the 7.5 Mw Hindu Kush earthquake shook northern Afghanistan with a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (&quot;Severe&quot;). This earthquake destroyed almost 30,000 homes, left several hundred dead, and more than 1,700 injured.

==Transportation==
Fayzabad Airport serves the province with regular direct flights to Kabul.

==Healthcare==

The percentage of households with clean drinking water increased from 13% in 2005 to 21% in 2011.
The percentage of births attended to by a skilled birth attendant increased from 1.5% in 2003 to 2% in 2011.

==Education==

Badakhshan University is located in Fayzabad, a city which also has a number of public schools including an all-girls school.

The overall literacy rate (6+ years of age) fell from 31% in 2005 to 26% in 2011. The overall net enrolment rate (6–13 years of age) increased from 46% in 2005 to 68% in 2011.

==Economy==
Despite massive mineral reserves, Badakhshan is one of the most destitute areas in the world. Opium poppy growing is the only real source of income in the province and Badakhshan has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the world, due to the complete lack of health infrastructure, inaccessible locations, and bitter winters of the province.

Lapis lazuli has been mined in the Sar-e-Sang mines, located in the Kuran wa Munjan District of Badakhshan, for over 6,000 years. The mines were the largest and most well-known source in ancient times. Most recent mining activity has focused on lapis lazuli, with the proceeds from the lapis mines being used to fund Northern Alliance troops, and before that, anti-Soviet Mujahideen fighters. Recent geological surveys have indicated the location of other gemstone deposits, in particular rubies and emeralds. It is estimated that the mines at Kuran wa Munjan District hold up to 1,290 tonnes of azure (lapis lazuli). Exploitation of this mineral wealth could be key to the region&#x27;s prosperity.

On 5 October 2018 in Washington, D.C., Afghan officials signed a 30-year contract involving a $22 million investment by investment group Centar and its operating company, Afghan Gold and Minerals Co., to explore and develop an area of Badakhshan for gold mining.

==Sport==

The province is represented in Afghan domestic cricket competitions by the Badakhshan Province cricket team BORNA Cricket Club which belongs to BORNA Institute of Higher Education is coming up with its own team and will be groomed by the experts in the field of cricket.

==Demographics==

As of 2020, the population of the province is about 1,054,087, constituting a multi-ethnic rural society. Dari-speaking Tajiks make up the majority followed by a few Uzbeks, Hazaras, Kyrgyz, Qizilbash, and others. There are also speakers of the following Pamiri languages: Shughni, Munji, Ishkashimi, and Wakhi.

The inhabitants of the province are mostly Sunni Muslims, although there are also some Ismaili Shia Muslims.
