<text>The 14th [[Lok Sabha]] (2 June 2004 – 18 May 2009) was convened after the 2004 Indian general election held in four phases during 20 April – 10 May 2004, which led to the formation of first Manmohan Singh ministry (2004–2009). Indian National Congress-led United Progressive Alliance won 62 more seats than previous 13th Lok Sabha. The Lok Sabha (House of the People) is the lower house in the Parliament of India. 8 sitting members from Rajya Sabha, the Upper House of Indian Parliament, were elected to 14th Lok Sabha after the 2004 Indian general election.The next 15th Lok Sabha was convened after 2009 Indian general election.

<text>Emma Anna Maria Zimmer (née Mezel; 14 August 1888 – 20 September 1948) was a female overseer at the Lichtenburg concentration camp, the Ravensbrück concentration camp and the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination/concentration camp for several years during the Second World War.

== Life ==
Mezel was born in Haßmersheim in Baden-Württemberg and was the eldest child of Oscar Mezel (a pharmacist) and his wife Maria née Lang. In 1938, she became a guard at the Lichtenburg early concentration camp, where she became assistant camp leader under Johanna Langefeld. She worked alongside Maria Mandl, who became a top-ranking official at the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp.

In 1939, Zimmer was assigned to the Ravensbrück concentration camp, where she served as assistant chief leader, then in October 1942, she became assistant camp leader at Auschwitz II (Birkenau) as an SS-&quot;Stellvertretende Oberaufseherin&quot;.

On 1 June 1943, one month before her 55th birthday, she was granted permission to stay on staff as a female overseer at Ravensbrück, despite her age. She was one of the first chief woman officers at Ravensbrück from 1939 to 1941, and took an active part in the selection of internees to be gassed during 1941 at the Bernburg Euthanasia Centre near Berlin.

Zimmer served as a guard at Ravensbrück, and was known in the camp for being brutal and sadistic in her guard duties, often dealing corporal punishment. She reportedly &quot;liked to slap&quot;, &quot;lashed out with her jackboots&quot; and &quot;walked up down the ranks carrying a large document file, with which she would beat inmates about the head for the slightest movement or sound&quot;. Zimmer referred to prisoners as “bitches” and “dirty cows” who needed to be put into their place and &quot;abused and bullied them in an extreme way.&quot;

At Auschwitz, she was particularly feared: &quot;Our supervisor was an old and mean SS-woman called Emma Zimmer. She was vicious and dangerous and frightening us constantly with threats, proclaiming in a sadistic voice, &quot;I will report you and then you will go away, you know where? Just one way-up the chimney.&quot; We hated her and were scared of her.&quot;

She was awarded the War Merit Cross Second Class without swords for her long service in the SS.

== Death ==
Zimmer stood trial at the seventh Ravensbrück Trial and was sentenced to death for her war crimes. She was hanged by the British executioner Albert Pierrepoint on the gallows at Hamelin Prison on 20 September 1948, when she was 60 years old.

<doc id="1291031" wikidata="Q5648619" url="?curid=1291031" title="Hanlon Expressway">
<text>The Hanlon Expressway or Hanlon Parkway is a limited controlled-access expressway connecting Highway 401 with the city of Guelph in the Canadian province of Ontario. The route travels in a generally north–south direction on the city&#x27;s west side. It is signed as Highway 6 for its entire length; from Wellington Street to Woodlawn Road it is concurrent with Highway 7. The speed limit alternates between 70 and 80 km/h (45 and 50 mph).

Between Highway 401 and Guelph, the Hanlon Expressway took over the Highway 6 routing from Brock Road (now Wellington Road 46). After years of planning and engineering, the route was built between 1972 and 1975. Originally designed to be a freeway, it was instead completed largely as a super-4 expressway with at-grade intersections since budget limitations precluded the construction of interchanges and overpasses, apart from an interchange at its southern terminus with Highway 401. Since then two additional interchanges have been built; Wellington Street West (Highway 7 and former Highway 24) which was completed in 2001, and Laird Road which opened in 2013. There are also two railway crossings near the northern terminus, though both are for spur lines. 

The Government of Ontario has announced plans to build a new Highway 7 freeway bypass joining the current northern terminus of the Hanlon Expressway to the Conestoga Parkway in Kitchener. In line with this project, the Hanlon Expressway will be upgraded to 400-series freeway standards. Long-term plans call for Highway 6 to be rerouted along a potential extension of the Hanlon south of Highway 401 to meet the four lane segment of Highway 6 south of Freelton. This would bypass the congested two lane section of Highway 6 (also known as Brock Road) in Wellington County from Puslinch to Morriston which runs through several small towns where it lacks sufficient right-of-way for widening.

== Route description ==
The Hanlon Expressway begins at a trumpet interchange with Highway 401 (from Highway 401 the on-ramps sign the Hanlon as &quot;Highway 6 North&quot;, whereas the other section of Highway 6 along Brock Road is signed as &quot;Highway 6 South&quot;). The Hanlon Expressway cuts through several farms northward before curving slightly westward to follow along the west side of the right-of-way of Hanlon Road. The Hanlon is graded and landscaped similarly to a rural freeway, with broad flat shoulders and an open median.

It enters Guelph at Maltby Road, skirting the outskirts of urban development. At the Laird Road interchange, opened in late 2013, the expressway encounters the Hanlon Creek Business Park.
As it progresses into residential subdivisions, the Hanlon Expressway encounters an at-grade intersection, with Downey Road travelling to the west and Kortright Road West to the east. Continuing north, the route crosses to the east side of the Hanlon Road right-of-way as it intersects Stone Road West to the west of the Stone Road Mall. Before crossing the Speed River, the expressway meets College Avenue West, an at-grade intersection at the southwest corner of Centennial Park Arena.

The Hanlon Expressway crosses the Speed River as it swerves to the west and meets Wellington Street, the only other interchange along the route. To the east, Wellington Road is Highway 7, which follows the Hanlon Expressway north from the interchange; to the west it was formerly Highway 24. North of the Wellington Road the expressway was built slightly west of what is now Silvercreek Parkway. It passes beneath the a line of the Goderich–Exeter Railway, a sideline of the Canadian Pacific Railway, before encountering three at-grade intersections: Paisley Road, Willow Road and Speedvale Avenue West. This section also features two at-grade rail crossings. Shortly thereafter, it ends at Woodlawn Road West; Highway 6 travels east from this point while Highway 7 travels west.

The road, like with nearby Hanlon Creek, is named after Felix Hanlon, one of the men who cut the first tree in Guelph along with John Galt. He was one of the original settlers in the area, and his family eventually deeded their land to the city.

== History ==
Prior to the construction of the Hanlon Expressway, Hanlon Road existed as far north as College Avenue. Edinburgh Road was the westernmost crossing of the Speed River. On the opposite side of the valley, Silvercreek Road continued, as it does today, along the same right-of-way as Hanlon Road.

At the time, the Highway 6 routing from Highway 401 to Guelph followed Brock Road which passed through the centre of the city. With the rapid suburban expansion of Guelph in the 1950s and 1960s, a revised transportation plan was conceived to handle the increasing traffic load. The Guelph Area Transportation Study was completed in 1967, and recommended a new controlled-access highway to allow through-traffic on Highway 6 to bypass the city. Route planning, engineering and design began on October 2, 1967 and was subsequently completed in 1969.
Construction began between Waterloo Avenue and Stone Road in 1970;
this section opened on June 28, 1972. The next section, from Stone Road to Clair Road, opened in October 1973. Work on the northern section from Waterloo Avenue to Woodlawn Road began in August 1974.
That section, as well as the final section south to Highway 401 were opened on November 7, 1975. With the Hanlon assuming the Highway 6 routing, Brock Road north of Highway 401 was downloaded to municipal authorities where it was designated as Wellington Road 46.

For the next quarter century, the Hanlon remained as a limited controlled-access expressway as the right-of-way for grade separations and interchanges remained vacant.
The Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) has planned to upgrade the route to a freeway since at least 1994, when an environmental assessment (EA) for the expressway north of the Speed River was completed.
Construction of the Wellington Avenue interchange began in October 1998;
it opened in July 2001, connecting Wellington Street west of the expressway with the Silvercreek Parkway into downtown Guelph. The interchange cost C$13.2 million and opened a year later than expected due to a design flaw that resulted in several months of delay and a lawsuit against the MTO resulting in a budget overrun of C$3.2 million. No further work has been done north of the Speed River, and the 1994 EA now requires updating.
On April 30, 2012, construction began on the Laird Road interchange. It partially opened on the week of November 11, 2013,
and was fully opened on November 29, 2013, in a public ceremony attended by local officials as well as Guelph MPP Liz Sandals.

== Future ==
As initially envisioned, the Hanlon Expressway will be upgraded to a controlled-access highway by removing all remaining at-grade intersections and improving the highway to 400-series standards. Planning for this work initially began in the early 1990s with the EA for the section north of the Speed River, which resulted in the construction of the Wellington Street interchange. The EA for the section south of the Speed River began in early 2007. The Laird Road interchange and associated closing of the Clair Road intersection were the first projects completed as part of this work.

Future projects will result in numerous changes. A full interchange will be constructed between Wellington County Road 34 and Maltby Road; the intersection with the former will become an overpass while the latter will be closed, with Maltby Road terminating at a cul-de-sac on both sides of the expressway. Further north, a partial-access diamond interchange will be built at Downey Road / Kortright Road West, with ramps from the northbound lanes and to the southbound lanes and the crossroad run beneath the expressway.
The lack of ramps on the north side is due to the proximity of Stone Road to the north, where a full interchange will be constructed. A service road will be constructed along the west side of the expressway connecting Downey Road and Stone Road to provide better access to the YMCA,
which previous controversial plans had neglected. At College Road, an underpass will be built.

<text>Mark Stephen Sampson (born January 19, 1957) is an American soccer coach. He is also the former head coach of both the United States men&#x27;s national team and the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer.

==Collegiate career==
Sampson attended UCLA briefly before transferring to Foothill Community College, located in Los Altos Hills, California, in 1975. At Foothill Community he earned All-American honors while playing on the 1976 California junior college state championship team. He then transferred to San Jose State University in 1977. He graduated from San Jose State in 1979 with a minor in Spanish, which he later used as coach of the Costa Rica national team.

==Beginning coaching==
After graduating from San Jose State, he moved to Stanford University where he earned a master&#x27;s degree in education from the Stanford Graduate School of Education. While at Stanford he entered the coaching ranks with the Awalt High School boys varsity soccer team in Mountain View, California. Then, after graduating from Stanford, he served as an assistant men&#x27;s soccer coach at Foothill College. In 1982, UCLA hired Sampson as an assistant men&#x27;s soccer coach. In 1985, he was on staff when UCLA won the NCAA men&#x27;s soccer championship.

==Santa Clara University==
At the end of the 1985 season, Santa Clara University hired him away from UCLA to serve as their men&#x27;s soccer head coach. In 1989, he achieved his greatest success as a college coach when he led Santa Clara to the NCAA Men&#x27;s Soccer Championship. Santa Clara&#x27;s opponent in the final was Virginia, coached by Bruce Arena, who would later succeed Sampson as head coach of the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team. Santa Clara and Virginia played even through regular time and four overtimes before NCAA officials stopped the game, much to the frustration of the players and two coaches, and named Santa Clara and Virginia as co-champions. Sampson was named the 1989 NCAA Men&#x27;s Soccer Coach of the Year. When he left Santa Clara, he had compiled a 64–19–19 record.

==1994 World Cup==
After leaving Santa Clara, Sampson became an assistant to Bora Milutinović on the United States national team in 1993 and was on the staff when the U.S. hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup. In addition to his coaching duties, he served as the Vice President/Competition Management for the World Cup organization.

==U.S. national team coach==

===1995 Copa America===
When Milutinović resigned from the team after the World Cup, the United States Soccer Federation (USSF) named Sampson as the interim coach in April 1995. After leading the US to a surprising fourth-place finish at the Copa América 1995, including a 3–0 romp over Argentina, as well as a victory over arch-rivals Mexico in the quarterfinals, Sampson was promoted to full-time national team coach in August 1995.

===1998 Gold Cup===
Sampson coached the team to a second-place finish in the 1998 Gold Cup, including a historic 1–0 victory over Brazil in the semi-final.

===1998 World Cup===
The US national team had a strong showing in the 1998 World Cup qualifying rounds, finishing with an 8–6–2 record overall.

Sampson attempted to improve the team by looking for Americans playing in Europe. David Regis was the most talented of those Sampson brought in but was impacted by delays in gaining his citizenship. Others like Michael Mason and David Wagner did not pan out as Sampson tried to overcome the weaknesses of a young MLS. In a controversial move, Sampson removed then captain, John Harkes from the squad. Sampson gave a variety of reasons, from Harkes&#x27; lack of leadership, Harkes wanting a more offensive role, and behavioral issues unbecoming of a national team player. There were injuries to both of the U.S.&#x27;s primary attacking threat, Eric Wynalda and creative midfielder Tab Ramos.

The 1998 World Cup would prove more challenging. Playing the likes of Germany and Yugoslavia were significantly more difficult than in CONCACAF qualifying. Sampson changed the formation in the spring of 1998 to an unusual 3–6–1 formation in preparation for the Germany match, trying to counter the quality of the German midfield. The conservative approach almost worked but was not to be as his team conceded a goal from a corner in the first half. When Sampson changed the system in the second half his team showed promise but was thwarted by an exceptional strike by Jürgen Klinsmann. The team lost 2–0. The second match against Iran showed a spirited team but one that could not find the back of the net. The U.S. team hit the crossbar and post on five occasions en route to a 2–1 loss in their most critical match. Counter-attack goals got the best of the U.S. seeking to overcome the Germany loss and the player unrest after that match. The lone goal came from Brian McBride. After significant personnel changes for the Yugoslavia game, the team lost 1–0. Failing to win a game and finishing in last place, Sampson resigned as coach on June 29, 1998.
In February 2010, Sampson said that John Harkes was dropped from the 1998 World Cup because of an affair between Harkes and Amy Wynalda, then the wife of U.S. striker Eric Wynalda. Long rumored as the reason Harkes was dropped, Sampson finally cleared the air after Eric Wynalda confirmed the rumors during a discussion about the situation for the English National team in the run up to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.

==Costa Rica national team==
In 2002, the Costa Rica national team hired Sampson as its head coach. In his first international post, he helped Costa Rica win the 2003 UNCAF Nations Cup, going undefeated. Costa Rica also finished fourth in the 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

In 2004, Costa Rica ranked 17 in the world, their highest ever at the time. However, after Costa Rica needed the away goals tiebreaker to get past Cuba in the second round of qualifying for the 2006 World Cup, Sampson was fired.

==Los Angeles Galaxy==
Sampson was hired as the LA Galaxy coach on August 18, 2004, replacing Sigi Schmid. Despite an array of talent, the team was inconsistent the rest of the year and struggled for large stretches of 2005. Many of the players whom Sampson had brought into the team were absent from the Galaxy squad due to national team commitments for the US, Costa Rica, and Guatemala. As the season continued the Galaxy improved and eventually won the &quot;double&quot; of the U.S. Open Cup and MLS Cup, the latter as the lowest seed in the playoffs. The Galaxy failed to build on their success in the 2005 season and Sampson was fired on June 6, 2006, after Alexi Lalas, who played for Sampson on the US National Team, was hired as president.

==Cal Poly==
Steve Sampson was hired as the head men&#x27;s soccer coach at California Polytechnic State University on December 4, 2014.

<doc id="1291047" wikidata="Q9179366" url="?curid=1291047" title="Brilliant Pebbles">
<text>Brilliant Pebbles was a space-based ballistic missile defense (BMD) system proposed by Lowell Wood and Edward Teller of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in 1987, near the end of the Cold War. The system would consist of thousands of small satellites, each with missiles similar to conventional heat seeking missiles, placed in low Earth orbit constellations so that hundreds would be above the Soviet Union at all times. If the Soviets launched their ICBM fleet, the pebbles would detect their rocket motors using infrared seekers and collide with them. Because the pebble strikes the ICBM before the latter could release its warheads, each pebble could destroy several warheads with one shot.

Brilliant Pebbles is named as a play on &quot;Smart Rocks,&quot; a concept promoted by Daniel O. Graham under the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). Smart Rocks envisioned large orbital battle stations equipped with powerful sensors and carrying numerous small missiles. However, deploying at least 423 stations to maintain coverage over the Soviet Union was impractical due to limited space lift capabilities at the time. Edward Teller dismissed the idea as &quot;outlandish&quot; and vulnerable to anti-satellite attacks, a sentiment shared by the SDI Office (SDIO). But after their own project, Excalibur—an X-ray laser system powered by a nuclear warhead—failed critical tests, Teller and Lowell Wood recognized the limitations of directed-energy weapons. The SDIO then revisited missile-based concepts akin to Smart Rocks. Wood introduced &quot;Pebbles,&quot; proposing that advances in sensors and microprocessors allowed missiles to operate independently without central stations. 

To intercept missiles promptly, the autonomous pebbles are kept in continuous low Earth orbit near the edge of the atmosphere. This low-altitude placement makes them susceptible to anti-satellite attacks. However, it also reduces the risk of contributing to Kessler Syndrome and space debris, as pebbles decay automatically due to atmospheric drag, re-enter the atmosphere, and are regularly replaced—a form of planned obsolescence. Because of their low orbit, the pebbles must travel at high velocities to maintain altitude, which prevents them from remaining fixed over a single location. Consequently, a constellation of many thousands of pebble satellites evenly distributed around the Earth is necessary to ensure sufficient coverage, making it inherently a global system. Critics contend that this global distribution renders the majority of satellites ineffective during a conflict, thereby making the system less efficient compared to localized or regional missile defense systems.

Pebbles replaced Rocks as the baseline SDI design and in 1991 it was ordered into production and became the &quot;crowning achievement of the Strategic Defense Initiative&quot;. By this time the Soviet Union was collapsing and the perceived threat changed to shorter-range theatre ballistic missiles. Pebbles was modified, but doing so raised its weight and cost; the original design called for around 10,000 missiles and would cost $10 to $20 billion, but by 1990 the cost for 4,600 had ballooned to $55 billion. Fighting in Congress through the early 1990s led to Pebbles&#x27; cancellation in 1993, but elements of the concept re-emerged with the Space Development Agency in 2019, and later in 2025.

==History==
===Smart Rocks===

There are a wide variety of stories about the origins of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Strategic Defense Initiative. According to one often repeated tale, it was Reagan&#x27;s viewing of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; that did it. Edward Teller instead pointed to a talk he gave on the topic of BMD in 1967 that Reagan attended. Others point to Reagan&#x27;s visit to the Cheyenne Mountain Complex in 1979; there he saw the systems that could detect a Soviet launch and then track their warheads. When he asked what they could do in that situation, the answer was &quot;launch our own missiles&quot;. Whatever the source, Reagan was convinced that mutual assured destruction (MAD) was ridiculous, dismissing it as the international equivalent of a suicide pact.

Reagan asked Daniel O. Graham, his military advisor during the 1980 presidential campaign and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, to look for possible solutions. At first, Graham proposed a system of crewed space fighters, but the idea was quickly dismissed. Next, he revived the 1960s Project BAMBI to be the basis of a new system he referred to as Smart Rocks. This concept used &quot;battle stations&quot; in low Earth orbit, each carrying several dozen small missiles similar to a conventional air-to-air missile. The platforms would carry advanced sensors to detect and track Soviet ICBMs as they launched, and then launch its missiles and guide them until the missile&#x27;s own infrared sensors picked up the ICBM. As the ICBM rocket engine was extremely bright in infrared, even a very simple interceptor missile could successfully track them.

As the interceptors were relatively small and carried a limited amount of rocket fuel, they could only attack ICBMs within a limited range of the stations. This meant the stations had to be in low orbit, to keep them close to their targets. At these altitudes, the stations moved at speeds around compared to the surface of the Earth. At that rate, any given station would spend only a few minutes over the Soviet Union. To ensure there were enough stations in the right locations at any given time, hundreds of stations were needed. The Air Force noted that there was nowhere near enough launch capacity to build such a system, and even if it could be launched, maintaining it would cost at least $30 billion a year in 1963 dollars (equivalent to $ billion in ). Additionally, it was noted that there was no effective way to protect the stations against attacks by anti-satellite weapons (ASATs), and the Soviets could easily afford to launch one for each platform.

Although twenty years had elapsed since BAMBI had first been studied and the concept had been re-examined several times, no obvious solution to these problems had presented itself. The Smart Rocks proposal, now known officially as Global Ballistic Missile Defense, ignored all of these problems, presenting a bare minimum of information. One observer derided the concept as being &quot;one view-graph deep&quot; and &quot;unencumbered by practical engineering considerations or the laws of physics&quot;. In spite of this, Graham soon found a group of like-minded Republicans who formed a group known as the High Frontier Panel to help develop and support his idea. The group was led by Karl Bendetsen and began meeting in a room provided by The Heritage Foundation.

===Excalibur===

Around the same time that Graham was formulating his Smart Rocks concept, studies into X-ray lasers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL or Livermore) made an apparent breakthrough. Nuclear explosions give off massive amounts of X-ray energy, and it appeared possible these could be focused down into narrow beams as the basis for a long-range laser weapon. Previous systems had used carbon-based lasing materials, but calculations showed that the energy could be greatly increased by using a metal rod instead. The idea had been largely theoretical until a key test of the new concept in November 1980.

By surrounding a nuclear warhead with dozens of rods, each could be independently aimed to shoot down an enemy missile. A single such warhead might be able to destroy 50 missiles in a radius of a around it. A small fleet of such warheads could seriously disrupt any Soviet attack. In February 1981, Teller and Wood traveled to Washington to pitch the idea of a Manhattan Project-level development effort to produce these weapons in what they called Project Excalibur.

Teller was also a member of the High Frontier group and began attacking Graham&#x27;s Smart Rocks as &quot;outlandish&quot;, and suggested his own Excalibur be used in its place. Graham countered by pointing out a serious flaw in Excalibur; he noted that it worked by blowing itself up, so in the event a Soviet anti-satellite weapon approached, it could either blow itself up to attack the ASAT, or allow itself to be blown up by the ASAT. In either case, the Excalibur would be destroyed. Teller soon returned with a solution. In this concept, the Excalibur weapons would be placed on missiles on submarines and launched when needed.

Seeing himself increasingly sidelined, Graham left the group in December 1981 to form High Frontier Inc. In March 1982, they published a glossy book on the topic. It claimed that the system could be &quot;fully deployed within five or six years at a minimum cost of some $10–$15 billion&quot;. A pre-publication copy was sent to the Air Force, who dismissed it, saying that it &quot;had no technical merit and should be rejected&quot;.

===Early failures, APS report===
On 23 March 1983, Reagan gave his famous &quot;Star Wars&quot; speech that called on the scientists of the United States to build defenses that would render nuclear weapons obsolete. Over the next year this was formalized as the Strategic Defense Initiative Office (SDIO) as a separate branch under the Department of Defense, and soon, many of the United States weapons laboratories and major defense contractors were exploring a variety of systems to meet this goal. Along with Excalibur and the space-based laser, new proposals included ground-based lasers, various particle-beam weapons and nuclear shaped charges.

Through the early phases of SDI, the Smart Rocks concept was ignored by the SDIO. A study by research scientist Ashton Carter (to become Secretary of Defense much later) concluded that the system had &quot;extremely limited capability for boost phase intercept of present Soviet ICBMs and no capability against future MX-like Soviet boosters, even with no Soviet effort to overcome the defense&quot;. Graham&#x27;s connections in Washington&#x27;s political circles meant the concept was well known in spite of any official indifference. This led to a constant stream of questions by politicians to the SDIO about the system and why they were not working on it. In 1985, Sam Nunn asked James A. Abrahamson, director of the SDIO, about it once again. Abrahamson stated that &quot;he would not recommend that the United States proceed to deploy it&quot;.

By 1986, many of the systems being studied had run into difficulties. Among these was Teller&#x27;s Excalibur, which failed several critical tests in 1986. A similar test carried out by skeptical physicists at Los Alamos National Laboratory suggested there was no lasing going on at all. Other concepts, like the neutral beam weapon which shot hydrogen atoms near the speed of light, demonstrated performance that was so poor it was unlikely it could ever work. The best among them all was the space-based laser, but it needed to improve its beam quality by at least 100 times before it would be able to disable an ICBM.

That same year, the American Physical Society (APS) published their review of the directed-energy weapon efforts. After a lengthy declassification procedure, it was released to the public in March 1987. Compiled by a number of notables in the laser and physics community, including Nobel laureate Charles H. Townes, the lengthy report stated in no uncertain terms that none of the concepts were remotely ready for use. In every case, performance had to be improved at least a hundred times, and for some of the concepts, as much as a million times. It concluded that at least another decade of work was required before they would even know if any of the systems could ever reach the necessary performance.

===Strategic Defense System===
In a sudden reversal, in late 1986 Abrahamson and Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger agreed to proceed with a deployment option for a system that was for all intents and purposes an updated version of Smart Rocks. Named &quot;Strategic Defense System, Phase I&quot;, or SDS for short, the concept added a ground-based interceptor that would be located in the United States, along with a host of radars and high- and low-orbit sensor satellites, all netted together with a command and control system. They briefed Reagan on the concept on 17 December 1986, and by mid-1987 had a proposal ready for review by the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB).

The system immediately faced withering criticism. As before, the newly christened &quot;garage satellites&quot; would be open to attack by anti-satellite weapons; a single ASAT attacking the station or its sensors could disable all of the interceptor missiles within. Although this concern had been raised before, the proponents still had no answer to this problem. But now the system added more critical elements, especially the high-orbit sensor satellites which not only had to survive, but had to be able to transmit their information at high speed to the interceptors. Disrupting any one of these many systems could render the system useless.

The $40 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ) budget estimate was dismissed as &quot;pure fantasy&quot;. Over the next year the budget continued to grow, apparently without bound, first to $60 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ), to $75 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ), and then reaching $100 billion by April 1988 (equivalent to $ billion in ).

===Brilliant Pebbles===
After Excalibur&#x27;s failed tests in 1986, the program was about to be defunded. At that time, Livermore had no other major SDI programs. Teller and Wood were looking for a concept that would be feasible.

The two had breakfast with Gregory Canavan, a Los Alamos physicist who worked on SDI related topics. Canavan noted that ongoing improvements meant microprocessors were on the verge of delivering supercomputer performance on a single chip. These chips were powerful enough that the processing capacity that formerly required the battle stations, or even computers on the ground, could now fit in the missiles themselves. Additionally, new sensors offered the optical resolution needed to track a missile at long range and still fit within a missile nose cone. Such a design offered an enormous advantage over the SDS; by flying freely, without a garage satellite, the interceptors could not be attacked &quot;en masse&quot;. If the Soviets wished to attack the system, they would have to launch an anti-satellite weapon for every one.

Wood began exploring the idea using back-of-the-envelope calculations. Wood&#x27;s &quot;O-group&quot; had been working for some time on new computing systems in their S-1 project that aimed to produce a &quot;supercomputer on a wafer&quot;. He combined this with a new sensor system known as &quot;Popeye&quot;. At the speeds the interceptors and ICBMs would be approaching each other, the mass of the projectile had six times the energy of an equal weight of TNT, meaning no warhead would be needed. Considering how small such a system could be scaled, he came up with a lower limit under . But if one considered armored ICBMs, a practical lower limit would be a burnout weight around , in order to have more than enough impact energy to destroy any conceivable fuselage.

Considering the numbers required, it appeared a fleet would have on the order of 7,000 missiles in orbit, which would keep about 700 over the Soviet Union at any given time. The ratio of the total number of missiles in orbit to those available for action was known as the &quot;absentee ratio&quot;. If one wanted complete coverage against any potential attack, the numbers could reach as high as 100,000 missiles in total. Since the cost of each missile was expected to scale down into the $100,000 range, even the fully expanded system would cost $10 billion.

Launch costs were not part of that estimate. If the empty weight was on the order of a few kilograms, then a single Space Shuttle could launch dozens, perhaps hundreds. They were so light that some consideration was given to launching them from the ground using a railgun. Such lightweight designs would have a limited &quot;cone of action&quot;, carrying so little rocket propellant that they could only attack targets right in front of them. A larger interceptor with more propellant could attack more targets, so smaller numbers would be needed to provide coverage. In any event, launch costs would be greatly reduced compared to the baseline system that required hundreds of battle stations, each of which weighed and could only be launched one at a time.

Starting the next year, Wood had the former Excalibur team begin a more detailed study. By the fall of 1987, he had blueprints of the proposed design, a physical model to show, and computer simulations of the system in action. He also came up with a clever play on the Smart Rocks name, calling the newer, smaller, smarter concept Brilliant Pebbles. In another clever turn of phrase, one skeptical congressman would later refer to them as &quot;loose marbles&quot;.

===Pebbles becomes the Strategic Defense System ===
With Teller&#x27;s help, Wood was able to brief Abrahamson on the concept in October 1987. Abrahamson was impressed enough to visit Livermore to view the mockups and watch the animated simulation they had created. This led to increased funding for further studies of the concept. In March 1988, Teller and Wood were able to directly brief President Reagan on the concept, taking the model pebble with them and theatrically hiding it under a black cloth when reporters were allowed to take pictures. Teller reiterated that the price for the system would be on the order of $10 billion.

In May 1988, Abrahamson initiated the Space Based Element Study in order to refine the design of SDS&#x27;s Space Based Interceptor (SBI). As part of this study, he had Livermore&#x27;s work considered as one of the interceptor concepts. This study agreed with the basic concept that all the required sensors could be placed on the missile. While this was going on, the United States Air Force Space Division began a similar study on the baseline Space Based Interceptor. They also concluded that the sensors could be on the missiles, greatly simplifying the stations.

For the next year, Wood and Teller ceaselessly advocated for Pebbles, to the point of it becoming something of a joke in Washington. During a briefing for reporters and congressional staff members, Charles Infosino, deputy director of the SDI architecture and analysis office, was quoted as saying &quot;You may have seen Lowell Wood, who is responsible for this program, running around town with [a mockup] ... on a little cart.&quot; There were concerns about the changing estimates through this period; cost estimates for the pebbles were initially $100,000, but by the end of 1988 this had already risen to $500,000 to $1.5 million. Additionally, the sensor alone cost several million dollars and there was scepticism about whether this could be scaled down by a factor of 10 as Wood&#x27;s estimates required.

===Moving towards production===

George H. W. Bush became President in 1989, as the Cold War was coming to an end. He immediately ordered a review of all ongoing strategic programs. This led to the June 1989 National Security Directive 14, continuing the SDI program on the basis of the SDS. Meanwhile, Abrahamson&#x27;s tenure at the helm of SDIO came to an end. He wrote an end-of-term report stating that Brilliant Pebbles should be aggressively pursued and that tests could be carried out within two years for a system deployment in five years at a total cost of $25 billion. Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle were vocal supporters of the Pebbles concept in the press; Quayle noted its low cost and light weight and stated that &quot;it could revolutionize much of our thinking about strategic defense&quot;.

Abrahamson&#x27;s replacement, George L. Monahan, Jr., planned a rapid series of studies with the goal of moving to approval for deployment by the end of the year. Among the first of these studies was one prepared by the JASONs, a standing committee of science advisers administered by Mitre Corporation. Their report essentially stated that there were no apparent &quot;show stopper&quot; issues in the concept, although they did have concerns about possible countermeasures. Soon after, a similar report by the Defense Science Board offered largely the same assessment.

A third review focussing on possible Soviet countermeasures did find that the system was possibly compromised by a number of issues, but pointed out that this was true for any other space-based system and these should not be the basis for selecting some other system over SDS. The final study, carried out late in 1989, was an Air Force report making one last comparison between the SDS concept with simplified &quot;gun rack&quot; garages versus a Pebbles system, which concluded the former would cost $69 billion and the latter $55 billion. This system included only 4,600 pebbles, and some of the savings were due to the removal of the high-orbit Boost Surveillance and Tracking System (BSTS), a role the pebbles themselves would fill.

Monahan had already given the DAB a &quot;heads up&quot; that major changes to the SDS concept were coming, and had been told to prepare a report for them for early 1990. The new system relied on Brilliant Pebbles as the baseline design. BSTS was not cancelled outright, but instead passed to the Air Force as a replacement for their existing Defense Support Program satellites. Other parts of the original design, including the land-based ERIS missile and its host of supporting radars and low-orbit satellites, remained.

Early contract tenders were sent to six suppliers for production vehicles. Testing was to run in a two-phase program, some of it in parallel. To start, LLNL would supply prototype pebbles interceptors that would be tested both on the ground and in space after launch on sounding rockets. This series would conclude in February 1993, in time to allow the President to review the system and decide whether to proceed. Information from these tests would be fed back into the production designs. The first of these prototypes would begin testing in June 1990 and end in June 1993.

===Global Protection Against Limited Strikes ===
A month later, another independent review by Henry F. Cooper strongly supported Brilliant Pebbles over the alternatives. Cooper&#x27;s report went much further. Considering the major changes to the strategic outlook with the ongoing dissolution of the Soviet Union, Cooper stated that the massive attack that SDS was designed to defeat was no longer the only concern, or even the main one. Instead, it was United States forces in the field that bore the brunt of the missile threat, this time from short and medium range missiles. Although the SDS system should move ahead, he suggested that the system be modified to provide defenses against these new threats.

Cooper noted that pebbles in their current form were designed to operate against a missile in the boost phase. Against a short-range rocket, this period would be too short for a pebble to reach it. To make it effective in this &quot;Protection Against Limited missile Strikes&quot; concept, or PALS, the pebbles should be able to continue tracking the missiles after their motors had burned out. This would either require a dramatic increase in the capability of the pebble&#x27;s seekers, or require a network of low-orbit satellites to provide this same information.

Following Cooper&#x27;s lead, Monahan began the Mid-and-Terminal Tiers Review (MATTR) in early 1990. Before this was complete, Cooper was appointed as the director of the SDIO on 10 July 1990, and Monahan retired. Within SDIO at least, PALS was now the mainline concept. In order to fill the need for a ground-based interceptor to back up the pebbles, the Army began development of the High Endoatmospheric Defense Interceptor (HEDI), essentially a short-range, mobile version of ERIS. A new lightweight interceptor, LEAP, would arm both ERIS and the Navy&#x27;s Standard Missile.

As work continued, the Gulf War broke out and Cooper&#x27;s scenario of United States troops being attacked by short range missiles came true; the nightly news carried vivid images of Scud missiles being attacked by Patriot missiles. Bush praised Patriot, claiming that 42 launches had resulted in 41 intercepts. Congress, formerly skeptical of SDI, suddenly had a very different opinion of the matter, especially with the realignment of the concept towards the PALS concept which would have been helping deal with missiles like Scud.

On 29 January 1991, Bush used the State of the Union speech to announce that SDI was being refocussed to the new &quot;Global PALS&quot;, or GPALS, concept:

This change in posture meant the system no longer had to deal with a large-scale attack, only small ones. Once again the number of pebbles was reduced, this time to between 750 and 1,000.

===Missile Defense Act of 1991===
The new GPALS concept was fully described in a May 1991 report published by the SDIO. It consisted of four parts: a ground-based missile system to protect the United States, a ground- and sea-based system to defend overseas United States forces and allies, Brilliant Pebbles in space, and a command and control system tying them all together. Brilliant Pebbles was seen as both a system for providing early detection of launches, as well as being able to attack any missile with a range greater than .

With the deployable system finally specified, the next step was to go to Congress for funding. This led to the Missile Defense Act of 1991. From one perspective, the Missile Defense Act was a victory for SDI as it considered making changes to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that would allow deployment, and ordered &quot;robust funding&quot; for Brilliant Pebbles. But it also stated that the immediate goal was to produce a Limited Defense System by 1996 what would be fully compliant with the Treaty, meaning it could have a maximum of 100 ground-based interceptors and they had to be in the vicinity of Grand Forks Air Force Base. It was specifically stated that Brilliant Pebbles would not be part of this initial system. Although there was some concern about the Missile Defense Act, many considered it to be the best deal that could be made.

Cooper essentially ignored the anti-Pebbles sentiment of the Missile Defense Act, and maintained its place as the primary weapon within the GPALS system. With funding secured, in June 1991 the SDIO sent out development contracts for Brilliant Pebbles and Brilliant Eyes to Martin Marietta and TRW. Brilliant Eyes was a low-orbit detection platform to aid Pebbles and the ground-based missiles. Additional contracts for the ground-based missiles and interceptors went out at the same time. This marked the first time since the Safeguard program of the 1960s that a production of a ballistic missile defense system was funded, and the first for SDI.

On 9 April 1992, Cooper testified before the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces of the Senate Armed Services Committee, where he was questioned by Democrats in the group. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, arrived late and then essentially took over the meeting. He noted that the complaints that SDIO was not being provided with the required funding was largely their problem, because Cooper was directing too much funding towards Pebbles, which would not be ready by 1996. He stated:

In defending his priorities, Cooper stated that the budget for these items was actually within the guidelines laid out the year before, about 11% for Pebbles and 14% for the other components of the space-based portion. He went on to suggest that the 1996 date was unrealistic and that setting priorities to make it happen would not help. Seeing the implied threat to the program, Cooper soon moved $2 billion out of Pebbles into the ground-based systems. Nunn reiterated his attack on Pebbles in August, at which point Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney stepped in and threatened that if the attacks continued that the president might veto the entire bill. His position was undermined by the failure of the third Pebbles test on 22 October 1992, when the booster broke up shortly after liftoff.

The final language for the 1992 version of the bill contained Nunn&#x27;s language on the focus towards the Limited Defense System. It firmed up language that stated that the deployed system would have to be fully compliant with the ABM Treaty, and reduced funding for the space-based portions from $465 million in the 1991 version to $300 million. Further, the wording that the system should be deployed as rapidly as possible was dropped.

In November 1992, SDIO was forced to remove Pebbles from the deployment contracts, sending it back to a research program. On 18 December 1992, program management was transferred to the Air Force&#x27;s Space and Missile Systems Center, and the January 1993 contracts were for &quot;advanced technology demonstration&quot; as opposed to a pre-production system.

===Cancellation===
Shortly after Bill Clinton became President in 1993, his new Secretary of Defense, Les Aspin, immediately began downgrading the Pebbles system. On 2 February 1993, he issued budget guidance lowering its budget from $100 million to $75 million, and moving it to the &quot;follow on technology&quot; category. In March 1993, it was renamed the Advanced Interceptor Technology Program.

On 1 May 1993, the SDIO became the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO), reflecting the administration&#x27;s shift towards the theatre ballistic missile problem. On 1 December 1993, James D. Carlson, its acting deputy director, ordered a stop work on the program. This was part of significant budget rollbacks to the entire program, limiting the organization to work on a single kill-vehicle. Brilliant Pebbles was dead. In August 1994, the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization was reoriented to a single Boost Phase Interceptor program.

==Description==
The final pebble design was similar to an air-to-air missile with no attempt at streamlining. The main body was about long, most of that consisting of propellant tanks for the final-stage directional controls. At the very front was the LIDAR receiver, with the laser illuminator just behind it to one side along with the UV/visible light camera. At the rear were the batteries. Forward speed was provided by a series of four boosters known as &quot;drop stages&quot;. Each consisted of a tank about the size of the pebble&#x27;s own, along with a thruster engine at the rear.

For most of its lifetime, the pebble would be held inside its &quot;life jacket&quot;. This provided electrical power via a solar panel, included a star tracker to provide basic alignment information, and carried a laser communications transceiver. The shell itself was intended to provide protection from laser strikes and pellets from the known Soviet anti-satellite weapon, part of the Istrebitel Sputnikov program.

==Tests==
Only three all-up tests of the Pebbles concept were carried out before the program was cancelled. All three failed for various reasons.

The first pebble test was carried out on 25 August 1990. This consisted of a basic airframe carrying an IR sensor, a star tracker and an attitude control system. It was to be launched to an altitude of over Wallops Island, Virginia, by a Black Brant sounding rocket. After launch, the pebble was to separate from the rocket, and then use its sensors to keep itself oriented with the still firing third stage of the Brant while also recording its orientation through the star tracker. The stage would be above the horizon and would take place at night, easing the problem of tracking. One of the explosive bolts that was supposed to separate the rocket fired 81 seconds into flight, much earlier than planned, causing the fairing to flip over to one side and pull the pebble partially out of the airframe. The only success on the mission was that another experiment, the ultraviolet plume instrument (UVPI) flying in orbit above the launch, was able to successfully track the rocket. As a result of the failure of the first test, the follow-up series was delayed by 10 months.

The second test was carried out on 17 April 1991. In this case the interceptor was supposed to be looking down at the target against the daylight Earth, testing its capability to see targets in this orientation. Because of the failure of the first launch, it was decided to instead repeat the simpler nighttime test that was supposed to have occurred on the first flight. This test intended to have the interceptor separate from the launcher and then perform a programmed turn so it could see the launcher through several following test phases. The first phase was to simply acquire the target via its rocket plume and keep it in sight using the attitude control system. In the next phase, the interceptor would perform a series of more radical maneuvers in order to characterize the performance of the controls and the tracking system in a more realistic scenario. Finally, the system would perform another series of smaller maneuvers intended to be more accurate movements. This test was largely a failure; the system failed to pick up the target, and all of the subsequent movements were found to be much less accurate than required, to a large degree due to the failure of the gyroscopes. Some useful data characterizing the IR background was performed, but the UV sensor only recorded its own background noise.

The final test was carried out on 22 October 1992, using a much more developed prototype built by Livermore that had been miniaturized and was more indicative of a production model. This test would begin like the others, with both the kill vehicle and the target being launched from a single rocket at Wallops Island. Once the two vehicles separated, the kill vehicle was to begin tracking the target, and then use its propulsion system to bring it to within of the target vehicle. Seventeen seconds after liftoff the ground crew could see pieces falling off the booster, and it was destroyed by the range safety officer at 55 seconds. The problem was later traced to a failure in one of the rocket nozzles in the Aries I first stage.

==Countermeasures==
===Promising cost-exchange===
Earlier anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems like Nike Zeus had the problem that they cost more than the ICBMs they were designed to shoot down; the United States would have to purchase $20 worth of interceptors for every $1 the Soviets spent on new ICBMs. In such a situation, the Soviets could defeat any possible ABM deployment simply by building more missiles. This was a major argument against ABM systems in the 1960s and 70s, and became known as the cost-exchange ratio.

This led Paul Nitze to propose what became known as the Nitze criteria; to be successful, the marginal cost of adding to the defense had to be less than the cost of adding to the offense. If this is not true, then the simplest response to any new defense system is simply to build more offensive missiles. But if the defense is cheaper, this will not work, and the enemy will have to explore other solutions to address the imbalance. Ideally, they too would build defenses, ultimately rendering the offence impotent.

Compared to earlier ground-based systems, the Smart Rocks interceptor missiles were relatively simple and low-cost. This meant the US could afford to launch several for every Soviet ICBM. However, they suffered the major flaw that they were dependant on support from the garage, and thus a single anti-satellite weapon could render all of the interceptors inoperative. Smart Rocks thus failed the Nitze criterion, as it was less expensive for the Soviets to attack the system than it would be for the US to build it.

In contrast, the Pebbles interceptors flew independently, and thus to attack them the Soviets would have to launch an ASAT for each one. This would mean that developing countermeasures to the system would be on the same order of cost as the pebbles themselves, something the Soviets&#x27; weaker economy could not afford. This appeared to meet the Nitze criterion; they could not afford to build their way out of the problem either using ASATs or new ICBMs.

===Absentee ratio===
Critics noted a key flaw in this comparison; since it was only a pebble in the right place at the right time that could attack the ICBM, adding a single ICBM did not require one more pebble, but many more in order to fill out the orbit so one would be in the right area. In the case of Pebbles, this &quot;absentee ratio&quot; was on the order of 10-to-1, meaning that adding a single ICBM would require ten new pebbles, driving the cost much closer to parity.

As the Union of Concerned Scientists pointed out early in the SDI program, any system that relied on boost-phase attacks had to be able to reach the target while the missile&#x27;s motor was still firing. With existing Soviet ICBMs like the SS-18, this period lasted as long as six minutes. The US&#x27;s Minuteman missile fleet only burned for four minutes, and the new MX missile was even less. The report went on to explore the ultimate end of such a &quot;fast burn&quot; approach, concluding that it was possible to build a missile that would launch and disperse its warheads in as little as one minute. Such a missile would require many dozens of pebbles for each one so that at least one of them was close enough to catch it, making the defenses much more expensive than the ICBM.

The SDIO argued that such a response by the Soviets would be welcome; while the Soviets were deploying their fleet of new missiles to counter Pebbles, SDI would be on its way to deploying new systems based on directed energy weapons that could defeat those missiles. Critics noted that this meant the SDIO was arguing that Pebbles would lead to an offensive arms buildup, precisely the opposite of what they had previously claimed was the point of the entire SDI concept, and contrary to the Nitze criterion.

===Other problems===
Another issue raised was that the existing Soviet A-135 anti-ballistic missile system could be fired at the Pebbles. By timing such an attack moments before an ICBM launch, the A-135 system&#x27;s 100 missiles could destroy those pebbles approaching the USSR and temporarily &quot;punch a hole&quot; for their ICBMs to fly through. Because of the absentee ratio, 1,000 additional pebbles would have to be added to the fleet to counter this possibility, not 100. This sort of attack would cost the Soviets very little.

Finally, there was another overarching technical issue that affected all of the space-based weapons. Since the late 1970s, the Soviets had used ground-based lasers to &quot;paint&quot; United States satellites on a number of occasions, in some cases temporarily blinding them. The APS report noted that the amount of energy needed to do this was very low, far less than the amount of energy needed to destroy a missile. This meant that while it was still unknown whether one could ever build a useful directed-energy anti-ICBM weapon, it was already possible to build an anti-SDI weapon that would blind such a system&#x27;s sensors. One commentator went so far as to note that protecting the optics was &quot;impossible&quot;. Such a system could be used against the pebbles in a fashion similar to the A-135, rendering them useless for a critical period while ICBMs were launched.

* Space Based Missile Interceptor Sizing Methodology, has a detailed examination of the weight and performance tradeoffs inherent to any kinetic-kill vehicle. Suggests that empty weight was around 20 kg and all-up weight including the life jacket was about 1850 kg. Based on this, they estimate the total cost of a fleet of 2600 pebbles would be $76 billion.</text><links>

<text>Rawene is a town on the south side of the Hokianga harbour, in Northland, New Zealand. State Highway 12 passes to the south. The town lies at the apex of a peninsula. A car ferry links it to Kohukohu and the northern Hokianga.

==History==
Rawene started as a timber centre, with a mill and shipyards established in the early 19th century. An attempted settlement by the first New Zealand Company in 1826 failed. Captain James Herd in 1822 had taken out the first shipment of kauri from the Hokianga in his ship &quot;Providence&quot;. In 1825 he returned as an agent for the Company, sailing the &quot;Rosanna&quot; in company with the &quot;Lambton&quot;,
and 60 settlers between the two vessels. Starting at Stewart Island / Rakiura, Herd sailed up the east coast eventually rounding North Cape to enter Hokianga - his old stamping ground. Herd negotiated to buy a vast tract of land. The deal was contested but for decades Europeans referred to the town as &quot;Herd&#x27;s Point&quot;. Later it was called &quot;Hokianga Township&quot;, and in 1884 it became &quot;Rawene&quot;, possibly to identify the post office and telegraph.

The post office had started operating by 1845 - one of eight in the country.

Aperahama Taonui, chief of Te Popoto hapū, allegedly operated a school at Rawene in the mid-19th century.

James Reddy Clendon, previously the United States Consul to New Zealand, settled in Rawene in 1862 and served as the local magistrate under the Native Circuit Courts Act until 1867. His house still stands and is open to the public.

By 1872 Rawene had two hotels and two stores. There was a Wesleyan church, and the Roman Catholics owned a section. Von Sturmer was the Postmaster, Customs Officer and Magistrate.

During the Dog Tax War of 1898 the residents of Rawene left for Kohukohu or took refuge on a steamer after the tax rebels threatened to march on the town. On 5 May 1898 120 men marched from Rawene to Waima to deal with the &quot;rebels&quot;, but the dispute was settled without them.
A small cottage hospital was built on a hill overlooking the town in 1910. A new hospital was completed in 1928. Dr George McCall Smith headed the hospital from 1914 to 1948 and developed a unique health-system for the Hokianga.

Dr Smith became a practitioner of &quot;painless childbirth&quot; in the early 1930s, using premedication with the barbiturate Nembutal combined with Hyoscine. This proved very popular and attracted women to Rawene from far afield. The annual average of thirty births per year now peaked at two hundred. In 1937 a &quot;Commission of Inquiry into Maternity Services&quot; investigated Smith&#x27;s practice. Smith fronted up with case notes on his last two hundred patients, and his results could not be bettered anywhere.

Parliament declared a special health area in the 1940s. This meant that all medical officers in the Hokianga were salaried, and all consultations, pharmaceuticals, investigations and hospital admissions were free. The whole scheme was funded through a per-capita grant.

<text>The Mystery Spot is a tourist attraction near Santa Cruz, California, opened in 1939 by George Prather. Visitors experience demonstrations that appear to defy gravity, on the short but steep uphill walk and inside a wooden building on the site. It is a popular tourist attraction, and gained recognition as a roadside &quot;gravity box&quot; or &quot;tilted house&quot;. The site is what is known as a gravity hill and was the first of its kind to be built in California.

==History==

The Mystery Spot was opened by George Prather in 1939. Prather was an electrician, mechanic, and inventor who was born near Fresno and moved to Santa Cruz in 1920. He owned a welding shop and repair garage in the area before he opened the Mystery Spot. One of several roadside attractions that opened after World War II for new automobile owners, the Mystery Spot was featured on Art Baker&#x27;s television show &quot;You Asked for It&quot;.

Prather was inspired to open the site by the popularity of the Oregon Vortex, which opened to the public in 1930. According to a newspaper report, Prather bought three acres on the hill in 1940 after he felt slightly dizzy while walking and was interested in his dizziness. The newspaper also reported that during further exploration of his property he found his compass jittering. He built a &quot;crazy house&quot; and opened the site to the public in June 1941. Tour guides lead visitors through the attraction and perform various demonstrations to showcase the site&#x27;s unusual effects.

Prather died in January 1946; his son Bruce inherited the land and continued running the Mystery Spot with his father&#x27;s business partner Vaden McCray. The McCray family was photographed for the &quot;Life&quot; magazine spread on the Mystery Spot for their November 15, 1948, issue. McCray died in 2001; Bruce Prather died in 2015. Christopher Smith now owns the property.

In July 2004, the Mystery Spot was nominated to be designated a California Historical Landmark, and received its designation (#1055) in August 2014.

==Geography==

The site is in Santa Cruz, California among the Santa Cruz mountains, Oak trees, Eucalyptus trees, near Granite Creek, and within the California Redwood forest. It is home to a man-made dahlia garden along the hiking trail.

==Explanation==
The Mystery Spot is a gravity hill, tilt-induced visual illusion. The illusion experienced by visitors results from the oddly tilted environment as well as standing on a tilted floor. Inside the tilted room, misperceptions of the height and orientation of objects occur. Even when people are standing outside on a level ground, the slant of the building in the background causes misperceptions as humans judge the height of people using the slant of the roof rather than the true horizon.

These visual illusions include balls rolling uphill and people leaning farther than normally possible without falling down. Psychologists at Berkeley state that all of the misperceptions stem from the simple fact that the house is slanted at a 20° angle. Professor William Prinzmetal states, &quot;When the perceiver&#x27;s body also is tilted, the distorting impact on vision is greatly magnified—up to two or three times.&quot; Another point he makes is that distorted orientation causes other senses to fall back while one&#x27;s visual senses become heightened. People standing at impossible angles and water flowing uphill are related to the angle at which the house sits.

Other suggestions have been proposed to explain the reason behind The Mystery Spot&#x27;s odd gravitational rules and illusions. Tour guides suggest that &quot;a meteor which fell in ancient days and left a magic circle&quot; is the cause behind the mystery, and suggest that an electromagnetic field on the hill deters wildlife. These theories are proposed for entertainment, not scientific reasoning.

==Cultural relevance==

The Mystery Spot was the first &quot;gravity-defying&quot; tourist attraction in California and was the most prominent illusion-based tourist attraction in California in the mid-20th century. It has been featured on BuzzFeed, and in the &quot;Santa Cruz Sentinel&quot; and other newspapers, comic strips, and travel blogs for decades.

<doc id="1291053" wikidata="Q1132527" url="?curid=1291053" title="Jerome Williams (basketball)">
<text>Jerome Williams (born May 10, 1973), nicknamed &quot;Junkyard Dog&quot; or &quot;JYD&quot;, is an American former professional basketball player active in the NBA between 1996 and 2005. Williams played for the Detroit Pistons, Toronto Raptors, Chicago Bulls, and the New York Knicks.

==Career==
He was a star player on the Magruder High School basketball team. Drafted out of Georgetown University by the Detroit Pistons with the 26th pick of the 1996 NBA draft (the pick originally belonged to the San Antonio Spurs and went to the Pistons in the Dennis Rodman trade), he played four-plus years with the Pistons, becoming one of their key reserves. He was a fan favorite during his days playing for the Toronto Raptors due to his tenacious efforts on the court.

On February 22, 2001, Williams was traded from the Detroit Pistons, along with Eric Montross, to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for Corliss Williamson, Tyrone Corbin, Dávid Kornél and a future first-round draft pick. He was so enthusiastic about joining his new teammates that he immediately drove from Detroit to Toronto upon hearing the news. In 2002–03 with the Raptors, Williams averaged 9.7 points per game, primarily as a starter, his career-best scoring average. In 2003, Williams also made a cameo appearance in the Disney Channel movie &quot;Full-Court Miracle&quot;.

In December 2003 Williams was traded again, this time along with Antonio Davis and Chris Jefferies, to the Chicago Bulls for Jalen Rose, Donyell Marshall and Lonny Baxter. Overall in 2003–04, Williams played in 68 games, starting 44 of them, averaging 6.2 points and 7.0 rebounds per game. During the 2004 offseason, he was involved in yet another trade, one that sent him and Jamal Crawford to the New York Knicks for Dikembe Mutombo, Frank Williams, Othella Harrington and Cezary Trybanski. His relocation to New York meant a relegation to the bench, as he played about 17 minutes per game.

On August 15, 2005, the Knicks waived Williams to avoid luxury taxes on his salary, as part of the NBA&#x27;s new labor agreement. He announced his retirement from his playing career less than 48 hours later. Williams played in 587 games over nine seasons, averaging 6.6 points and 6.4 rebounds per game.

==Post-playing career==
Williams joined the NBA&#x27;s &quot;Basketball Without Borders&quot; program, an effort to teach the game and bring resources to underdeveloped nations in Africa, Asia and elsewhere. In Toronto, he was always greeted with a standing ovation when he returned in a Bulls or Knicks uniform. Nicknamed the Junk Yard Dog (or JYD) by Rick Mahorn in his early days as a Detroit Piston for his hard work and hustle (as stated in an interview while he served as a commentator on NBA TV), Williams sometimes referred to himself in the third person.

On January 25, 2006, Williams rejoined the Toronto Raptors as their community representative.

Williams also played a minor role in the Canadian FBI show, &quot;Sue Thomas: F.B. Eye&quot;. He played Otis Washington, a dealer turned informant.

Williams was hired as Director of Player Development for the national champion Findlay Prep basketball team before becoming assistant coach. In the summer of 2013, Jerome was promoted to the position of Head Coach at Findlay Prep. He stepped down as head coach in the summer of 2014.

Williams continues to be a part of youth development through basketball as he was appointed the President of The Young3 which holds 3-on-3 tournaments for young people ages 9–14.

Williams and other basketball legends have implemented a digital educational program throughout North America, called Shooting For Peace.

<doc id="1291071" wikidata="Q295679" url="?curid=1291071" title="Ruth Hussey">
<text>Ruth Carol Hussey (October 30, 1911 – April 19, 2005) was an American actress best known for her Academy Award-nominated role as photographer Elizabeth Imbrie in &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;.

==Early life==
Hussey was born in Providence, Rhode Island on October 30, 1911. She was later known as Ruth Carol O&#x27;Rourke, her stepfather&#x27;s surname. Her father, George R. Hussey, died of the Spanish flu in 1918 when she was seven years old. Ten years later, her mother, Julia Corbett Hussey, married a family friend, William O&#x27;Rourke, who had worked at the family&#x27;s mail-order silver enterprise. She had an older brother, Robert, and a younger sister, Betty.

After obtaining her early education at Providence&#x27;s public schools, Hussey studied art at Pembroke College and graduated in 1936. She did not win roles for any of the plays for which she had auditioned at Pembroke. She received a degree in theatre from the University of Michigan and worked as an actress with a summer-stock company in Michigan for two seasons. She also attended Boston Business College.

==Career==
After working as an actress in summer stock, Hussey returned to Providence and served as a radio fashion commentator on a local station. She wrote the ad copy for a local clothing store and read it on the radio each afternoon. She was encouraged by a friend to audition for acting roles at the Providence Playhouse, but the theater director rejected her, saying that the roles were cast only out of New York City. Later that week, she traveled to New York, and on her first day there, she signed with a talent agent who booked her for a role in a play starting the next day back at the Providence Playhouse.

In New York, she also worked for a time as a model. She then landed a number of stage roles with touring companies. While touring the country in 1937 for &quot;Dead End&quot;, Hussey was spotted on opening night at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles by MGM talent scout Billy Grady. MGM signed her to a contract and she made her film debut later that year. She quickly became a leading lady in MGM&#x27;s &quot;B&quot; unit, usually playing sophisticated, worldly roles.

Hussey&#x27;s breakout role was as Elizabeth Imbrie, the cynical magazine photographer in &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1940), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. In 1941, theater exhibitors voted her the third-most-popular new star in Hollywood.

Hussey also worked with Robert Taylor in &quot;Flight Command&quot; (1940), Robert Young in &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; (1940) and &quot;H. M. Pulham, Esq.&quot; (1941), Van Heflin in &quot;Tennessee Johnson&quot; (1942), Ray Milland in &quot;The Uninvited&quot; (1944) and Alan Ladd in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1949).

In 1946, Hussey starred on Broadway in the Pulitzer Prize-winning play &quot;State of the Union&quot;. Her 1949 role in &quot;Goodbye, My Fancy&quot; on Broadway caused a &quot;Billboard&quot; reviewer to write: &quot;Miss Hussey brings a splendid aliveness and warmth to the lovely congresswoman...&quot;

Hussey played Jean Arthur&#x27;s role of Miriam Starrett in the 1955 &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot; presentation of &quot;Shane&quot;, playing alongside the film’s original stars Ladd and Heflin.

In 1960, she costarred in &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; with Bob Hope and Lucille Ball. Hussey was also active in early television drama.

==Personal life==
On August 9, 1942, Hussey married talent agent and radio producer C. Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Longenecker (1909–2002) at Mission San Antonio de Pala in north San Diego County, California. They raised three children: George Longenecker, John Longenecker and Mary Elizabeth Hendrix.

Following the birth of her children, Hussey focused on family activities and in 1964, she designed a family cabin in the mountain community of Lake Arrowhead, California. In 1967, she was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame.

In 1977, Hussey and her husband moved from their Brentwood family home to Rancho Carlsbad in Carlsbad, California. Her husband died in 2002 shortly after their 60th wedding anniversary.

Her son John Longenecker worked as a cinematographer and film director. He won an Academy Award for producing the live-action short film &quot;The Resurrection of Broncho Billy&quot; (1970).
Hussey was also active in Catholic charities, was noted for painting in watercolors and was a lifelong Democrat although she voted for Republican Thomas Dewey in 1944 and for Hollywood friend and former costar Ronald Reagan in the 1980 and 1984 presidential elections.

==Death==
Hussey died on April 19, 2005 at the age of 93 from complications from an appendectomy. She is interred at Pierce Brothers Valley Oaks Memorial Park in Westlake Village, California.

<text>IL-2 Sturmovik () is a 2001 World War II combat flight simulator video game and is the first installment in the &quot;IL-2 Sturmovik&quot; series. The release focused on the air battles of the Eastern Front. It was named after the Soviet Ilyushin Il-2 ground-attack fighter, which played a prominent role in this theatre and is the single most produced military aircraft design to date. Along with its sequels, &quot;IL-2 Sturmovik&quot; is considered one of the leading World War II flight simulators.

== Gameplay ==
The game features 31 flyable planes and additional 40 non-flyable planes (available as opponents). One can play as Australia, France, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the USSR.

The game includes a multi-player feature which supports up to 100 players online over the internet. Free internet services such as Xfire, Hyperlobby, and The All-Seeing Eye, are used for setting up online game sessions.

== History ==
The game was developed by 1C:Maddox Games and published by 1C in Russia and Ubi Soft in the rest of the world, for Windows on November 18, 2001.

== Sequels and subsequent development ==

The game saw the release of a number of add-ons and sequels since its initial release, with some of the sequels including the entirety of the original release&#x27;s content.

The game is currently distributed as the &quot;IL-2 Sturmovik: 1946&quot; pack. The latest edition that includes all sequels and patches is version 4.14.1, which brings the number of available flyable aircraft up to 85* and the number of maps to 41*. &quot;IL-2 Sturmovik&quot; is the flight simulator video game longest supported by its developer with the demo released in 2001 and the latest patch including new planes, maps and other features released in December 2022. Recently patches 4.13, 4.13.1, 4.13.2, 4.13.3, 4.13.4, 4.14, 4.14.1, 4.15, and 4.15.1 were released.

All the patches or versions, like &quot;Forgotten Battles&quot; (2003) or standalone games, like &quot;Pacific Fighters&quot; (2004), used and shared the same game engine from 2001 until the &quot;1946&quot; pack (2006) and even until the console adaptation (&quot;IL-2 Sturmovik: Birds of Prey&quot;, 2009). The first games in the series not using the original 2001 game engine were &quot;IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover&quot; (2011, which runs its own game engine) and &quot;IL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad&quot; (2013, which runs on a game engine derived from another game, the 2009 simulator &quot;Rise of Flight&quot;).

==Reception==

&quot;IL-2 Sturmovik&quot; received a &quot;Silver&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. As of 2014, the game&#x27;s overall sales had surpassed 2 million copies.

The review aggregator Metacritic gave &quot;IL-2 Sturmovik&quot; a score of 91 out of 100, while GameRankings, another review aggregator, gave it 90.65%.

===Awards===
&quot;IL-2 Sturmovik&quot; was named the best computer simulation of 2001 by &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot;, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;, GameSpy and GameSpot, and was a runner-up for IGN&#x27;s award in this category, losing to &quot;Independence War 2&quot;. Similarly, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;IL-2 Sturmovik&quot; for its &quot;PC Simulation&quot; award, but ultimately gave the prize to &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002&quot;. It also &quot;narrowly&quot; lost &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;″s &quot;Best Simulation&quot; award to &quot;Flight Simulator 2002&quot;, according to that magazine&#x27;s editors.

While awarding the game, the editors of &quot;Computer Games&quot; called &quot;IL-2 Sturmovik&quot; &quot;the best World War II flight sim—the best flight sim of any kind, for that matter—to come along in years.&quot; Similarly, those of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;IL-2 Sturmovik&quot;″s election to Sim of the Year was one of the biggest shoo-in votes in the history of this magazine. [...] Know this: &quot;Sturmovik&quot; is not only the best simulation of 2001, it&#x27;s the best WWII-themed sim ever, and one of the best flight sims of all time.&quot;

<doc id="1291078" wikidata="Q3528938" url="?curid=1291078" title="George Harris, 4th Baron Harris">
<text>Colonel George Robert Canning Harris, 4th Baron Harris, (3February 185124March 1932), generally known as Lord Harris, was a British colonial administrator and Governor of Bombay, best known for developing cricket administration via Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). 

An English amateur cricketer, from 1870 to 1889, Lord Harris played for Kent and England, captaining both teams. He was President of the Kent County Football Association between 1881 and 1908, as well as serving as a government minister from 1885 to 1900.

==Early life==
The Honourable George Harris was born at St Ann&#x27;s, Trinidad, on 3 February 1851, the only son of George Harris, 3rd Baron Harris, and his wife Sarah Cummins, daughter of George Cummins. At the time of his birth, his father was serving as Governor of Trinidad (1846–1854). Harris barely knew his mother who died when he was two years old. In 1854, shortly after her death, the family moved to Madras where his father was posted as Governor. Harris senior retired in March 1859 and returned to England, becoming involved with Kent County Cricket Club as a Committee Member, before, in 1870, being elected Club President.

In 1864, at the age of 13, Harris was sent to Eton College to further his education. His first important cricket match was the 1868 Eton &quot;versus&quot; Harrow fixture at Lord&#x27;s, when he was seventeen; he scored 23 and 6. In the same fixture the following year, when Cuthbert Ottaway scored 108 to seal victory for Eton by an innings and nineteen runs, Harris was out for 0. In 1870, his last year at Eton, he scored 12 and 7 against Harrow. In 1871, Harris went up to Christ Church, Oxford.

His father died in November 1872, whereupon Harris junior succeeded to the barony as 4th Baron Harris. He was already a first-class cricketer by then and was henceforward universally known in the sport as Lord Harris.

==Cricket career==
===Summary of playing career===
Harris made his first-class debut for Kent in 1870 after he left Eton. Owing to his position in society, he was immediately elected to the club committee and was associated with Kent cricket for the rest of his life. He went up to Christ Church, Oxford in September 1870 and played for Oxford University from 1871 to 1874. He was available to play for Kent in the latter half of each of these seasons and became county captain in succession to South Norton in 1871, although his appointment was not made official until after he left Oxford. Harris held the Kent captaincy until 1889.

He led the English cricket team in Australia and New Zealand in 1878–79 and was a central figure in the events of 8 February 1879 when a crowd riot erupted at a match in Sydney. The team had previously played a match against an All-Australia XI at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and this was later designated Test status as the third-ever Test match. Harris was therefore the second England Test captain after James Lillywhite. Australia, led by Dave Gregory, won the match by 10 wickets.

Harris captained England against Australia on three further occasions. In 1880 at The Oval, in what was later recognised as the inaugural Test match in England, England won by 5 wickets. Harris captained England in two of the Tests played in 1884, his team winning by an innings and 5 runs at Lord&#x27;s and drawing the final match in the series at The Oval.

The full span of Harris&#x27; first-class cricket career was from 1870 to 1911, at 42 seasons one of the longest on record, though he made only seven appearances after 1889 when he relinquished the Kent captaincy so his essential playing career was from 1870 to 1889. He appeared in 224 first-class matches, including four Test matches, as a righthanded batsman who bowled right arm fast with a roundarm action. He scored 9,990 runs in first-class cricket with a highest score of 176 among eleven centuries and held 190 catches. He took 75 wickets with a best analysis of five for 57. Even in old age he was a capable cricketer, scoring a fifty for I Zingari v West Kent in his 71st year and 25 against Philadelphia Pilgrims at Lord&#x27;s, 53 years after he had made his first appearance at the home of cricket.

===Throwing issue===
In the early 1880s, there were a number of bowlers who were widely considered to have unfair actions, with the Lancashire pair of Jack Crossland and George Nash coming in for particular criticism. After playing for Kent against Lancashire in 1885, when he faced the &quot;bowling&quot; of Crossland and Nash, Harris decided to take action. He persuaded the Kent committee to cancel the return fixture. Later that season, Crossland was found to have broken his residential qualification for Lancashire by living in Nottinghamshire, and Nash dropped out of the side. The two counties resumed playing each other the following season. Harris&#x27;s &quot;Wisden&quot; obituarist wrote: &quot;...there can be no doubt the action of Lord Harris, even if it did not entirely remove the throwing evil, had a very healthy effect on the game.&quot;

===Administration===

Harris had a long association with Lord&#x27;s and MCC as both player and administrator. In 1862, aged eleven, he was practising at Lord&#x27;s. It was not till 1929, at the age of 78, that he played there for the last time, representing MCC &quot;vs&quot; Indian Gymkhana. He was President of MCC in 1895, a Trustee from 1906 to 1916 and Treasurer from 1916 to 1932. Additionally, he was at various times Chairman of both the MCC finance and cricket sub-committees. Through these offices, Harris wielded considerable power in the world of cricket and it was written of him: &quot;No man has exercised so strong an influence on the cricket world so long...&quot;

In July 1909, Harris chaired a meeting of representatives of England, Australia and South Africa which launched the Imperial Cricket Conference and agreed rules to control Test cricket between the three nations. In 1926, he presided at a meeting at The Oval, when it was agreed that &quot;governing bodies of cricket in countries within the Empire to which cricket teams are sent, or which send teams to England&quot; should be eligible for ICC membership. The meeting had the effect of creating three new Test-playing nations: West Indies, New Zealand and India.

Harris was a controversial figure in the world of cricket, revered by cricket&#x27;s MCC-based establishment albeit heavily criticised elsewhere. Not all thought that he used his power well. Alan Gibson once wrote that he was &quot;an antediluvian old tyrant&quot;, though he later retracted this, saying that Harris was a more complex figure than that. But, complex or not, Harris was never accused by contemporaries of being an intellectual. He might have robbed England of the services of one of its greatest batsmen, Wally Hammond, who had been born in Kent but chose to play for Gloucestershire, where he had gone to school. Hammond had not fulfilled the required period of residence to qualify for Gloucestershire and, once Harris became aware of this, Hammond was barred from playing for them until the necessary time had elapsed. The affair resulted in Harris complaining about what he called &quot;bolshevism&quot; influencing cricket.

==Political and military career==

Harris was politically active as a member of the Conservative Party, sitting in the House of Lords as Under-Secretary of State for India from 25 June 1885, then as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War from 4 August 1886 to 1890. During the same period, he also worked as Under-Secretary of State for War, 1886–90; then as Vice-Lieutenant for Kent.

Appointed Governor of the Presidency of Bombay in British India from 1890 to 1895, Harris also served in the British Army, being commissioned in the Royal East Kent Regiment, promoted Colonel of the Regiment, before joining the Imperial Yeomanry, 1900–01. Lord Harris was charged with the Sovereign&#x27;s Sceptre and dove at the Coronation of Edward VII and Alexandra.

===Bombay===
Lord Harris&#x27; governorship of Bombay was not without extensive criticism, with one anonymous writer penning a poem expressing the hope that Bombay would not suffer too greatly from Harris&#x27; political inexperience. He was mainly notable for his enthusiastic pursuit of cricket amongst his fellow Europeans in the colony, at the expense of connecting with the native population. When the interracial Bombay riots of 1893 broke out, Harris was out of the city at Poona enjoying cricket matches. He returned to Bombay only on the ninth day of rioting, and then primarily to attend a cricket match there. 

Some writers credit Harris with almost single-handedly introducing and developing the sport in India. Although cricket was well established among the natives before his arrival, he did much to promote it. However, in 1890, he rejected a petition signed by over 1,000 locals to relocate European polo players to another ground so that the locals could use the area for cricket matches. It was only in 1892 that he granted a parcel of land to the newly formed Muslim Gymkhana for a cricket field, adjacent to land already used by the Parsee Gymkhana. His reluctance to do so is evident in his written comment:

I don&#x27;t see how we can refuse these applicants; but I will steadfastly refuse any more grants once a Gymkhana has been established under respectable auspices by each nationality, and tell applicants that ground having been set apart for their nationality they are free to take advantage of it by joining that particular club.

When Harris left India, having virtually ignored famine, riots and sectarian unrest, a publisher circulated a collection of newspaper extracts from his time as governor. The introduction stated:

Never during the last hundred years has a Governor of Bombay been so sternly criticised and never has he met with such widespread unpopularity on account of his administration as Lord Harris.

Harris was appointed Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India in May 1895.

===Later career===

On his return to England, Harris again served in the Conservative Government as a Lord-in-Waiting to Queen Victoria from 16 July 1895 to 4 December 1900.

He was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel in command of the Royal East Kent Yeomanry on 6 October 1897. During the Second Boer War, he held a commission as Assistant Adjutant-General for the Imperial Yeomanry from 28 February 1900, until he resigned in April 1901.

==Death and family==

In 1874, he married the Honourable Lucy Ada Jervis (died 1930), daughter of Carnegie Robert John Jervis, 3rd Viscount St Vincent. 

Lord Harris died in 1932, aged 82, being succeeded in the barony by his only child, George, as 5th Baron Harris.

<text>Harlan Lawson Lane (August 19, 1936 – July 13, 2019) was an American psychologist. Lane was the Matthews Distinguished University Professor of Psychology at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, in the United States, and founder of the Center for Research in Hearing, Speech, and Language . His research was focused on speech, Deaf culture, and sign language.

Lane was born in Brooklyn, New York. Remaining in New York City for college, he obtained both a B.S. and an M.S. in psychology from Columbia University in 1958. He subsequently received a PhD in psychology from Harvard (1960) and a &quot;Doc. des Lettres&quot; from the Sorbonne (1973). In 1991, Lane received a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship.

Lane, a hearing man, became an often controversial spokesman for the Deaf community and critic of cochlear implants. He wrote extensively on the social construction of disability and stated that &quot;Unless Deaf people challenge the culturally determined meanings of &quot;deaf&quot; and &quot;disability&quot; with at least as much vigor as the technologies of normalization seek to institutionalize those meanings, the day will continue to recede in which Deaf children and adults live the fullest lives and make the fullest contribution to our diverse society.&quot; In recognition of his research and advocacy regarding these issues, Lane received the Distinguished Service Award from the National Association of the Deaf (United States), the International Social Merit Award from the World Federation of the Deaf, and numerous other awards.

He was &quot;Commandeur de l&#x27;Ordre des Palmes Académiques&quot;, the highest level of the academic honor given out by the French government.

Lane died in France from Parkinson&#x27;s disease on July 13, 2019, at the age of 82.

<doc id="1291104" wikidata="Q7321631" url="?curid=1291104" title="Rhyme &amp; Reason (Missing Persons album)">
<text>Rhyme &amp; Reason is the second studio album by American band Missing Persons, released in 1984. It was a commercial disappointment. A video was created for &quot;Surrender Your Heart&quot; featuring animations from Peter Max. &quot;Give&quot; and &quot;Right Now&quot; were also released as singles, and videos made for both received airplay on MTV. Missing Persons embarked on a successful tour, but the album quickly fell off the sales charts.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; wrote that &quot;the most accurate description of the album&#x27;s tone is that it&#x27;s consistently bland... The pace, beat, and modulation of the music sounds the same; the only change is in the lyrics.&quot; The &quot;Omaha World-Herald&quot; concluded that &quot;Missing Persons continues to show why it is one of the worst of the trendy Los Angeles new wave bands.&quot;

<doc id="1291105" wikidata="Q3109767" url="?curid=1291105" title="Godiego">
<text>is a Japanese rock band founded in 1975, originally consisting of Yukihide Takekawa (lead vocals), Mickie Yoshino (keyboards), Takami Asano (guitar), Steve Fox (bass guitar), and Yujin Harada (drums). The band released its first self-titled album in 1976, with Takami&#x27;s brother, Ryōji Asano, replacing Harada as drummer. By 1977, Ryōji left and was replaced by American drummer Tommy Snyder.

They are perhaps best known for performing the song &quot;Monkey Magic&quot; for the 1978 television series &quot;Saiyūki&quot; which was brought over to the United Kingdom as &quot;Monkey&quot;. This led to several releases through BBC Records, including &quot;Monkey Magic&quot;, &quot;Gandhara&quot;, and the LP &quot;Monkey&quot; and several of their records charted in the UK. Their theme from &quot;The Water Margin&quot; was their sole UK Top 40 hit. Godiego are also known for performing the theme song &quot;THE GALAXY EXPRESS 999&quot; for the &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; film and the soundtracks for the 1977 film &quot;House&quot; and the 1978 documentary &quot;The Glacier Fox&quot;. They were the first rock band to play in the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Nepal, and inspired the name for the band Monkey Majik (the group&#x27;s original drummer was British and watched the show as a child). Lead guitarist Takami Asano worked on the soundtrack of the Nintendo DS game &quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor&quot;, while vocalist Yukihide Takekawa composed the soundtrack for the Super NES video game &quot;Soul Blazer&quot;. As of 2024, Godiego has released 27 singles and 55 albums in Japan, with lyrics written variably in English by longtime collaborator lyricist Yoko Narahashi.

<doc id="1291116" wikidata="Q2249401" url="?curid=1291116" title="Portrait of a Killer">
<text>Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper—Case Closed () is a 2002 nonfiction book by crime novelist Patricia Cornwell that presents the theory that Walter Sickert, a German-British painter, was the 19th-century serial killer known as Jack the Ripper.

Jean Overton Fuller, in her 1990 book &quot;Sickert and the Ripper Crimes&quot;, had maintained that Sickert was Jack the Ripper. Prior to that, Stephen Knight, in his 1976 book &quot;Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution&quot;, had maintained that Sickert had been forced to be an accomplice of the Ripper. Neither of these two books is mentioned in Cornwell&#x27;s book.

Cornwell&#x27;s book was released to much controversy, especially within the British art world, where Sickert&#x27;s work is admired, and also among &quot;Ripperologists&quot;, who dispute her research methods and conclusions. Cornwell lashed back at these critics, claiming that, if she were a man or British, her theory would have been accepted. She has also made remarks indicating that those who study the Ripper case would rather have the mystery than its solution.

==Theory==

Cornwell contends Sickert had the psychological profile of a killer. She asserts that many of his paintings and sketches follow a violently misogynistic theme. Cornwell&#x27;s belief is that Sickert was unable to have normal intercourse because of botched surgery to correct a fistula on his penis. However, Cornwell provides little evidence for either the fistula or the surgery. The killings coincide with the marriage of Sickert&#x27;s close friend and mentor, the famous painter James Abbott McNeill Whistler, who later distanced himself from Sickert, even suing Sickert later in life. Cornwell claims this marriage and the end of the friendship provided the spark which exacerbated his awareness of his disabilities and ignited a latent anger against the opposite sex.

Departing from common belief among experts that most of the Ripper&#x27;s letters were hoaxes, Cornwell writes that the letters contain specific information related to crimes, and as such are unlikely to be from anyone other than the Ripper. However, Cornwell&#x27;s book does not discuss exactly which details of the Ripper&#x27;s murders were made known to the general public at the time. Cornwell cites Sickert&#x27;s artistic genius as useful for crafting the Ripper&#x27;s letters by disguising handwriting and varying sketching styles. She also points to Sickert&#x27;s paintings and sketches, some of which show women in prostrate poses that Cornwell claims are similar to victims at their crime scenes.

Cornwell also had a stamp licked by the writer of one of the supposed Ripper letters analysed for DNA, and claimed it pointed to Sickert. However, the analysis could only be of mitochondrial DNA, and the result could be shared by anything from between 1 percent and 10 percent of the population. Sickert was, at best, &quot;not excluded&quot; by the analysis, but his typically European result would be shared by large groups of Britons alive in 1888.

Cornwell has said, including in her &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; interview with Sue Lawley, that new evidence has come to light since 2002. She states that a paper manufacture expert she hired asserts that reams of paper supposedly used by Jack the Ripper to write several letters to Scotland Yard and paper purchased by Sickert&#x27;s mother bear the same small-press watermark. She also claims that there are matches in the cutter&#x27;s marks, which are a result of the rough cutting of each quire (or small package) for packaging. A &quot;quire&quot; was usually of 24 sheets.

==Responses from critics==

Though Cornwell&#x27;s book sold many copies, many Ripperologists and other critics argued that Cornwell&#x27;s theory was far from persuasive.

*Critics point out that most, if not all, of the Ripper letters are considered hoaxes by other authorities and that if they really are hoaxes, then Sickert may have been one of the hoaxers. Thus, even if he did write one or more of these letters, that does not prove that he was the Ripper.
*The evidence she claims supports the idea that Sickert had a disfigured penis also supports the more accepted theory that he had a fistula in his anus.
*Details in the letters and supposedly seen in the paintings she claims only the killer would know had previously been published in newspapers and a book released in France. Sickert could have easily got hold of the book in question, as he also lived in France off and on. In fact, evidence shows that he was probably in France on the nights of four of the five Ripper murders.

Critics also note that Cornwell has said that she did not have a theory about the murders until about a year before her book was published and believed that the first suspect mentioned to her was the one who really committed the crimes.

In September 2014, Finnish molecular biologist Jari Louhelainen claimed that his DNA analysis pointed to a different suspect, Aaron Kosminski, which also provoked criticism and controversy.

&quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27;s December 2002 review by Caleb Carr was very critical, writing:
&quot;Portrait of a Killer&quot; is a sloppy book, insulting to both its target and its audience. The only way for Cornwell to repair its damage will be to stay with this case, as she says she intends to, continuing her research, studies and tests for the years required to complete them thoroughly. Perhaps then she can then do what she claims to have done already—prove Walter Sickert&#x27;s guilt decisively. Failing that, she should apologize for this exercise in calumny.

==2017==

In 2017, Cornwell published another book on the subject, &quot;Ripper: The Secret Life of Walter Sickert&quot;, in which she uncovers what she believes to be further evidence for Sickert&#x27;s guilt.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesOnline.co.uk / Ripper&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>The Westland petrel (&quot;Procellaria westlandica&quot;), (), also known as the Westland black petrel, is a moderately large seabird in the petrel family Procellariidae, that is endemic to New Zealand. Described by Robert Falla in 1946, it is a stocky bird weighing approximately , and is one of the largest of the burrowing petrels. It is a dark blackish-brown colour with black legs and feet. It has a pale yellow with a dark tip.

This species spends most of its life at sea but returns to land to breed. When at sea, it ranges across areas of the Pacific and Tasman seas around the subtropical convergence and migrates east to South American waters during the non-breeding season. They feed on fish, squid and crustaceans. This species is also known to be an opportunistic feeder, scavenging fish waste discarded by hoki fishers.

The only known breeding colonies of the Westland petrel are in New Zealand, in a small area of forest-covered coastal foothills between Barrytown and Punakaiki on the South Island&#x27;s West Coast. The birds nest in burrows excavated into hillsides and slopes, and exhibit natal philopatry, that is they return to their natal colony to breed. The loss of a breeding colony can therefore have severe consequences for the population. The total area of all breeding colonies combined is only about . In 2014, the breeding colony areas suffered extensive damage from landslips and tree fall during the tail-end of Cyclone Ita. Other significant potential threats to the breeding colonies are predation by feral pigs and vagrant dogs from nearby settlements.

As of 2021, the International Union for Conservation of Nature classified this species as endangered, and the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified this species as &quot;At Risk: Naturally Uncommon&quot; under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

== Taxonomy ==

The Westland petrel was first described by New Zealand ornithologist Robert Falla in 1946 under the name &quot;Procellana parkinsoni westlandica&quot;. The Westland petrel was identified in 1945 after the students of Barrytown School wrote to Falla, as he was then the director of the Canterbury Museum. They had heard in a radio broadcast about the sooty shearwater/muttonbird, but noticed that the behaviour of the &#x27;mutton birds&#x27; in their area was quite different. They also sent Falla a dead bird, and within a few weeks he visited the West Coast. Initially he considered that the West Coast birds were a subspecies of the black petrel (&quot;Procellaria parkinsoni&quot;), but it was soon classified as a separate species. The male holotype specimen, collected at Barrytown on 29 April 1946, is held at the Canterbury Museum.

The Māori name is &quot;tāiko&quot;, which also refers to the black petrel, &quot;Procellaria parkinsoni.&quot;

==Description==

The adult Westland petrel is a stocky bird, weighing around . It is entirely dark blackish-brown, with black legs and feet. Some individuals may have a few white feathers. The is pale yellow with a dark tip. Falla measured the female and male birds for his original description and pointed out that the male of the species measured slightly larger than the female. However the female specimen weighed slightly more than the male. It is one of the largest of the burrowing petrels.

Falla described the eggs of this species as follows:
Moulting occurs in the Westland petrel in their non-breeding season between October and February, during migration to South America. The immature birds moult before older individuals do.

==Distribution and habitat==

The Westland petrel is endemic to New Zealand. It spends most of its life at sea, only returning to land to breed, and breeds only in a small region of the South Island&#x27;s West Coast. The breeding range covers an wide strip between Barrytown and Punakaiki, specifically from the Punakaiki River to Waiwhero (Lawson) Creek. The area of the breeding colonies comprises forest-covered coastal foothills within the Paparoa National Park, or other conservation land, or on land belonging to Forest And Bird. There is also a breeding colony located on private land. The total area of all breeding colonies combined is only about .

During the breeding season, adults may be seen in waters around New Zealand from Cape Egmont to Fiordland in the west, through the Cook Strait, and from East Cape to Banks Peninsula in the east. Westland petrels also range across areas of the Pacific Ocean and Tasman Sea around the subtropical convergence. In the non-breeding season, the birds migrate east to waters off South America and feed in the Humboldt Current. They are often found in waters to the west of the Chilean coast. Individuals usually remain solitary during this time, rejoining the colony when the next breeding cycle begins.

==Breeding and life-cycle==
The Westland petrel is one of the few petrel species that still nest on the mainland. Their large size and aggressive behaviour have helped to ensure that they can resist predators that would attack smaller species. Westland petrels nest in burrows dug 1 to 2 metres into the hillside, often on a steep slope. There are around 29 colonies of petrel in the breeding territory. Each colony has between 50 and 1000 burrows. Colonies can be located anywhere from above sea level.

Westland petrel are winter breeders, arriving at their breeding grounds annually in late March or early April to prepare their burrows for nesting. Colonies are noted to be very vocal around three weeks before nesting, during the time when courtship and mating occur. Petrels can form life time pair-bonds. The female lays a single egg between May and June that hatches two months later, between August and September. Both the male and female taking turns incubating the egg. After hatching, the parents care for the chick for about two weeks. After this time the chick is left alone, but is fed at night. If either parent dies before the chick is nearly ready for fledging, the chick will not survive. Fledging occurs between 120 and 130 days after hatching.  Fledging begins in early November, with a peak around 20 November, and finishes in mid-January. In total, chick rearing takes between 177 and 198 days (approximately 6 to 6.5 months). After leaving the nesting sites, fledglings may not return for up to 10 years.

== Diet and foraging ==

Westland petrels can forage during both day and night, preying primarily on fish, some squid, and less commonly on crustaceans. They are known to opportunistically scavenge fish from waste discarded by hoki fisheries during their breeding season as it overlaps with the fishing season, switching back to natural foraging at other times. They capture their prey by seizing or diving from the surface, and, less frequently, pursuit plunging. They have been recorded diving to depths of . Their strong vision allows them to spot prey, and recent studies have shown that smell is also important to petrel foraging, specific odours seeming to attract the birds to certain areas.

==Threats==
=== Breeding colony hazards ===
Westland petrels, along with other types of seabird exhibit natal philopatry—they return to their natal colony to breed. This means that the loss of a breeding colony through landslides, predation or human interference can have severe consequences for the population.

==== Storm, landslide and tree fall ====
The breeding colonies are often on steep sites, and are vulnerable to damage resulting from landslips and tree fall. In April 2014, Cyclone Ita brought very strong winds to the West Coast along with heavy rain. The storm caused widespread damage across the area of the breeding colonies, although not all colonies were equally affected. After the storm, a survey was conducted at colony locations containing 75% of the estimated breeding population. In 4 out of the 6 colonies surveyed, over half of the breeding habitat had been lost through landslips and fallen trees.

Further damage to nesting areas occurred during Cyclone Fehi and Cyclone Gita in 2018.

==== Predation ====
Predation by feral pigs and vagrant dogs are among the top threats to Westland petrels at the breeding colonies. Pigs are a particularly serious threat because they can potentially destroy an entire nesting colony. There have been reports that hunters have deliberately released pigs in areas close to the colonies. Wandering dogs are also a significant threat, because the settlement of Punakaiki is only from the colonies.

Other predators such as stoats,and rats and weka may strike during the breeding season when the birds are on land, preying on chicks in burrows and on adult birds. Feral cats are also infrequent predators of petrels. While not predators, concerns have been raised about the threat of burrow destruction by cattle and goats. They can trample burrows and allow access to predators such as weka, that would have been unable to reach them otherwise.

=== Artificial lighting ===

Many types of seabirds are vulnerable to injury and death as a result of being attracted to artificial lights at night. This is a particular threat for petrels and shearwaters. Burrow-nesting seabirds like the Westland petrel returning to their burrows at night, or leaving them before dawn, can become disoriented by artificial lights and crash land on roads. They are often unable to take off again. The birds can then be eaten by predators or struck by vehicles. In 2009, the Department of Conservation asked residents of Punakaiki to help reduce the occurrences of fledgling birds crash landing in the town by turning off outside lights and closing blinds at night, particularly during misty or stormy weather. 

In 2020, the NZ Transport Agency (Waka Kotahi), in what was reported as a nationwide-first, turned off streetlights in Punakaiki between November and January, the period when the fledgling birds leave their burrows and take their first flight. Shortly after the start of this conservation initiative, Westland petrels were found crash-landed in Greymouth, in larger numbers than reported in previous years. A recent switch to LED streetlights in Greymouth was suggested as a possible cause of the increase. In 2021, it was reported that the number of birds crashing in Punakaiki had reduced significantly in response to the reduced lighting in the town, and the streetlights were again switched off during the next petrel fledging season.

=== Mining on Barrytown Flats ===
In 2021, Australian-owned Barrytown Joint Ventures Ltd applied for consents to mine ilmenite sands on of private land on the Barrytown Flats between Canoe Creek and Deverys Creek. Over eight years up to 156,000 tonnes of sand per year would be extracted to a depth of , 24 hours a day, and processed on site, with the ore being transported to Westport or Greymouth for export. Locals had expressed concerns about noise, light pollution, heavy vehicle traffic, and Westland petrels being attracted to lights. In February 2022, the Grey District Council and the West Coast Regional Council declined an application to mine 5,000 tonnes of ilmenite sands per week, citing environmental concerns, including the potential effects on sensitive waterways and the risks to Westland petrels from vehicle activity and lights associated with the mining project.

=== Parasites and diseases ===
No diseases have been recorded to date that are significant for the Westland petrel. However, little research has been done on disease and parasites in New Zealand seabirds. Avian pox may potentially pose a threat to the petrels, as it has killed a number of black petrel chicks. Other diseases that affect seabirds include avian malaria, avian cholera, and avian diphtheria but these have not been observed in Westland petrels to date.

=== Other threats ===
Power lines have caused the deaths of adult petrels from collision during flight. Commercial fishing is another source of threat because petrels are sometimes accidentally captured in fishing nets. This is a significant risk for Westland petrels, as they are known to interact closely with the fishing vessels and forage from fishery waste.

== Conservation ==
As of 2021, this species is regarded as being endangered under the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species. The Department of Conservation assessed its conservation status in 2021 as &quot;At Risk: Naturally Uncommon&quot; under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

During the fledging season, a team of local conservationists patrol an section State Highway 6 in the Barrytown Flats area that lies beneath the flight path from the breeding colonies, looking for birds that have crash-landed on or near the road. Any birds that are found are placed in a box and delivered to the Department of Conservation office in Punakaiki. Each bird gets a checkup, and is then released from a cliff.

==Relationship with humans==

=== Tāiko festival ===
Every year, a festival is held in Punakaiki to celebrate the return of the petrel to its only known breeding sites, close to the town. It is a weekend-long festival in April or May that includes live music, various entertainment activities, and a local market. The festival begins with a viewing of the birds as they fly overhead and make their way to their nests in the mountains at dusk.

=== Ecotourism ===
There is an ecotourism business in the area that provides viewing opportunities at the breeding colony located on private land.

=== Harvesting of chicks ===
Westland petrel chicks have historically been harvested for food in a practice known as muttonbirding, although this is not thought to be part of traditional Māori food gathering practice in this area.

<text>Hawkair (Hawkair Aviation Services) was a regional airline based in Terrace, British Columbia, Canada. It operated scheduled and charter regional passenger services in British Columbia and Alberta. Its main base was Northwest Regional Airport with a hub at Vancouver International Airport.

== History ==
Hawkair Aviation Services was established and started operations in 1994 as an air freight service operating out of Terrace. In 2000 it started air passenger services, initially between Vancouver and Terrace. It quickly expanded to serve most of the airports of northern British Columbia.

The first plane it owned was a Bristol Freighter. In 2004, this plane took its last flight to an air museum in Wetaskiwin, Alberta. This was the last flight flown by a Bristol Freighter.

In October 2005, it was forced to file for protection under the Companies&#x27; Creditors Arrangement Act (bankruptcy protection), and reduced the number of aircraft in its fleet from 5 to 3.

In April 2007, Hawkair announced that it would be resuming service to Smithers on May 21, 2007. The service operated daily to/from Vancouver. On August 1, 2015, service to Smithers was suspended again due to low passenger loads.

In March 2010, Hawkair was purchased by 580741 BC, the parent company of Central Mountain Air and Northern Thunderbird Air.

In November 2015, Hawkair announced it was cancelling scheduled service into Prince Rupert

In December 2015, Hawkair entered a Capacity Purchase Agreement with sister airline Central Mountain Air, effectively ending its status as a scheduled airline.

In September 2016, Central Mountain Air cancelled the remaining Terrace to Vancouver direct scheduled service using Hawkair Aircraft, ending a 16 year long connection.

On November 18, 2016, Hawkair declared bankruptcy, had all assets seized for liquidation, and permanently suspended operations.

== Destinations ==
Before permanently ceasing operations, Hawkair operated scheduled services to the following destinations in British Columbia from Concourse B of the Main Domestic Terminal of Vancouver International Airport:

*Dawson Creek (Dawson Creek Airport)
*Terrace (Northwest Regional Airport)
*Vancouver (Vancouver International Airport)

In the past the following destinations were also served:

*Bob Quinn Lake (Bob Quinn Lake Airport), BC
*Fort Nelson (Fort Nelson Airport), B.C.
*Fort St. John (Fort St. John Airport), B.C.
*Prince George (Prince George Airport), B.C.
*Prince Rupert (Prince Rupert Airport)
*Sandspit (Sandspit Airport), B.C.
*Smithers (Smithers Airport)
*Victoria (Victoria International Airport), B.C.
*Calgary (Calgary International Airport), AB (from Fort St. John)
*Grande Prairie (Grande Prairie Airport), AB

== Fleet ==
The Hawkair fleet previously included:
* 2 Bristol Freighter
* 1 Cessna 150
* 2 Bombardier Dash 8-100
* 8 Bombardier Dash 8-102
* 2 Bombardier Dash 8-311
* 1 Douglas ATL.98 CARVAIR (Aviation Traders Carvair)
* 1 Piper PA-28 Cherokee

According to Flight International they also operated the following:
* 1 King Air 200
* 1 Fairchild Metro II
* 1 Fairchild Merlin IV

<text>John Brian Francis &quot;Jack&quot; Gaughan, pronounced like &#x27;gone&#x27; (September 24, 1930 – July 21, 1985), was an American science fiction artist and illustrator and multiple winner of the Hugo Award in the category of Best Professional Artist.

==Career==
John Brian Francis Gaughan was born September 24, 1930, in Springfield, Ohio, to James J. and Elizabeth Gaughan. 

Working primarily with Donald A. Wollheim at Ace Books, and DAW Books from 1971, his simple linear style brought to life images of such works as Andre Norton&#x27;s &quot;Witch World&quot; novels and E. E. Smith&#x27;s &quot;Lensmen&quot; and &quot;Skylark&quot; novels (for which he did two related sets of Pyramid Books covers). His broad visual vocabulary enabled him to render the objects, spaceships and scenes in whatever was presented to him as they were described in the books and stories he illustrated. That was especially an accomplishment as many of these authors drew on their knowledge of esoteric subjects for their imagery. This ability made him very popular among people with an engineering background.

During most of Ejler Jakobsson&#x27;s tenure as editor of &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; from 1969 to 1974, Gaughan produced all of the illustration and much of the design that went on in the magazine. In addition, many of the books he did for Ace featured hand-lettered titled pages, frontispieces, or maps with Gaughan&#x27;s distinctive calligraphy. One example is its 1966 edition of Alan Garner&#x27;s &quot;The Weirdstone of Brisingamen&quot;. (Ace replaced the Gaughan cover illustration in its second printing, 1978.) L. Sprague de Camp&#x27;s 1967 anthology, &quot;The Fantastic Swordsmen&quot;, included a Gaughan map before each of the eight collected stories. His maps also grace the Ace first editions of some &quot;Witch World&quot; novels – including the 1963 first edition of the first one – and Mark S. Geston&#x27;s &quot;Lords of the Starship&quot; (title page and map).

Gaughan illustrated the covers and hand-lettered title pages for the unauthorized first paperback edition of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, which Ace released in 1965. A illustration Gaughan did of Samuel R. Delany was also used at the cover art for Delany&#x27;s 1988 autobiography &quot;The Motion of Light in Water&quot;.

Beside his professional work, he was a frequent contributor to SF fan magazines. In his heyday he was often nominated for Hugo Awards for best professional artist and best fan artist. In 1967, he won both awards in the same year. &quot;Locus&quot; ran a column by him for a while.

Gaughan died on July 21, 1985, in Springfield, Ohio. In his memory, the New England Science Fiction Association presents the annual Jack Gaughan Award for best emerging science fiction illustrator. Gaughan was posthumously inducted by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in 2015.

<doc id="1291174" wikidata="Q1378400" url="?curid=1291174" title="Bike lane">
<text>Bike lanes (US) or cycle lanes (UK) are types of bikeways (cycleways) with lanes on the roadway for cyclists only. In the United Kingdom, an on-road cycle-lane can be firmly restricted to cycles (marked with a solid white line, entry by motor vehicles is prohibited) or advisory (marked with a broken white line, entry by motor vehicles is permitted). In the United States, a &quot;designated bicycle lane&quot; (1988 MUTCD) or &quot;class II bikeway&quot; (Caltrans) is always marked by a solid white stripe on the pavement and is for &#x27;preferential use&#x27; by bicyclists. There is also a &quot;class III bicycle route&quot;, which has roadside signs suggesting a route for cyclists, and urging sharing the road. A &quot;class IV separated bike way&quot; (Caltrans) is a bike lane that is physically separate from motor traffic and restricted to bicyclists only. 

Research shows that separated bike lanes improve the safety of bicyclists, and either have positive or non-significant economic effects on nearby businesses. The United Nations Environment Programme says there ought to be at least ten times more bike lanes by 2030 than there were in 2020.

== Effects ==
In a 2024 assessment of existing research, the U.S. Department of Transportation concluded that &quot;separated bicycle lanes have an overall improved safety performance.&quot;

According to a 2019 study, cities with separated bike lanes had 44% fewer road fatalities and 50% fewer serious injuries from crashes. The relationship was particularly strong in cities where bike lanes were separated from car lanes with physical barriers. 

Research published in 2020 showed insights from communities where on-road cycling for transportation is less common, particularly in the Southeast U.S. and reported that potential bikers say separated bike lanes would make them more likely to participate in active transportation. However, scientific research indicates that different groups of cyclists show varying preferences of which aspects of cycling infrastructure are most relevant when choosing a specific cycling route over another; thus, to maximize use, these different groups of cyclists have to be taken into account.

A 2019 study which examined the replacement of 136 on-street parking spots with a bike lane on the Bloor Street retail corridor in Toronto, Canada, found that it increased monthly customer spending and the number of customers on the street. These findings run contrary to a popular sentiment that bike lanes have an adverse effect on local economic activity.

A 2021 review of existing research found that closing car lanes and replacing them with bike lanes or pedestrian lanes had positive or non-significant economic effects on nearby businesses.

== United States ==

According to the &quot;National Association of City Transportation Officials&quot; (NACTO) bike lanes are an exclusive space for cyclists by using pavement markings and signage. Bike lanes flow in the same direction as motor vehicle traffic and is located adjacent to vehicle movement. Conventional bike lanes provide limited buffer space between vehicles cyclists, as those with protective space are referred to as buffered-bike lanes. Buffered bike lanes are similar to conventional lanes but provide a buffered space between vehicles and cyclists hence the name. 

The &quot;Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot; (MUTCD) by the &quot;U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration&quot; (FHA) gives standards of how bike lanes should be implemented regarding pavement markings and signage. These can include the word, symbol, and arrow size to be used in a bike lane and the width of the lane itself, which ranges from 5–7 feet. Cities across America are actively expanding their amount of bike lanes,such as in Boston, Massachusetts, where they have created city-wide goals, Go Boston 2030, to increase their bike network.

== Europe ==

In France, segregated cycling facilities are called &quot;bandes cyclables&quot; for those beside the carriageway and &quot;pistes cyclables&quot; for totally independent ones; together they are &quot;voies cyclables&quot;. In Belgium, traffic laws do not distinguish cycle lanes from cycle paths. Cycle lanes are marked by &quot;two&quot; parallel broken white lines, and they are defined as being &quot;not wide enough to allow use by motor vehicles&quot;. There is some confusion possible here: both in French (&quot;piste cyclable&quot;) and in Dutch (&quot;fietspad&quot;) the term for these lanes can also denote a segregated cycle track, marked by a road sign; the cycle lane is therefore often referred to as a &quot;piste cyclable marquée&quot; (in French) or a &quot;gemarkeerd fietspad&quot; (in Dutch), i.e. a cycle lane/track which is &quot;marked&quot; (i.e. identified by road markings) rather than one which is identified by a road sign. In the Netherlands a cycle lane is normally called &quot;fietsstrook&quot; instead of &quot;fietspad&quot;.

== Asia ==

Commuting by bicycle is quite common in some Asian countries like Japan, where bicycle ridership has been increasing dramatically since the 1970s. However, many parts of Japan have been slow to adopt effective and safe means of transport, so in recent times there have been steps taken to promote biking in the nation&#x27;s largest city, Tokyo. Many bike lanes in Tokyo have been constructed to allow a two-directional flow of traffic in only one lane, but add a physical separation between pedestrians, bike lanes, and the roads. In addition to these types, there are other forms of bike lanes in various parts of the Tokyo wards that do not separate bicycle users from pedestrians, but do separate them from the road. These lanes are designated typically with signs overhead and some form of painted line to denote a lane for pedestrians and a lane for bikers; however these rules are often not adhered to. In addition to these forms of bike lanes in Tokyo, there are several other types which mostly consist of some alteration of the aforementioned two, or are simply painted lanes on the side of the road. In other parts of Japan, such as the city of Fukuoka, clear types of bike lanes are being implemented to promote biking in the city: &quot;Bicycle roads, Bicycle lanes, Sidewalks shared between pedestrians and cyclists with markings, and Sidewalks shared with pedestrian with no markings.&quot;

Other countries in Asia, like China, have larger networks of bike paths and lanes dedicated to cycling. The city of Nanjing has several types of bike lanes: protected, unprotected, and shared lanes. These lanes are similar to those of other nations, in which the bike lanes are either separated by physical barriers of some form or are entirely separate street paths. Unprotected bike lanes are painted on the street with vehicles but denote their own lane, and shared bike lanes are not denoted but it is implied that bikes will share the whole road with cars on that stretch of land. In addition, Chinese bike usage is relatively high compared to other nations, and so cycling is taken into account when designing road junctions: many junctions include various paths for cyclists, so that they do not have to come into direct contact with motor vehicles. There has been increasing concern over biking accidents in China; a case study in Shanghai found that the most desperate need is to alter unprotected to protected cycle lanes.

<doc id="1291180" wikidata="Q512136" url="?curid=1291180" title="Linear phase">
<text>In signal processing, linear phase is a property of a filter where the phase response of the filter is a linear function of frequency. The result is that all frequency components of the input signal are shifted in time (usually delayed) by the same constant amount (the slope of the linear function), which is referred to as the group delay. Consequently, there is no phase distortion due to the time delay of frequencies relative to one another.

For discrete-time signals, perfect linear phase is easily achieved with a finite impulse response (FIR) filter by having coefficients which are symmetric or anti-symmetric. Approximations can be achieved with infinite impulse response (IIR) designs, which are more computationally efficient. Several techniques are:
* a Bessel transfer function which has a maximally flat group delay approximation function
* a phase equalizer

== Definition ==
A filter is called a linear phase filter if the phase component of the frequency response is a linear function of frequency. For a continuous-time application, the frequency response of the filter is the Fourier transform of the filter&#x27;s impulse response, and a linear phase version has the form:

:formula_1

where:
*A(ω) is a real-valued function.
*formula_2 is the group delay.

For a discrete-time application, the discrete-time Fourier transform of the linear phase impulse response has the form:

:formula_3

where:
*A(ω) is a real-valued function with 2π periodicity.
*k is an integer, and k/2 is the group delay in units of samples.

formula_4 is a Fourier series that can also be expressed in terms of the Z-transform of the filter impulse response. I.e.:

:formula_5

where the formula_6 notation distinguishes the Z-transform from the Fourier transform.

== Examples ==
When a sinusoidformula_7  passes through a filter with constant (frequency-independent) group delay formula_8  the result is:

:formula_9

where:
*formula_10 is a frequency-dependent amplitude multiplier.
*The phase shift formula_11 is a linear function of angular frequency formula_12, and formula_13 is the slope.

It follows that a complex exponential function:

:formula_14

is transformed into:

:formula_15

For approximately linear phase, it is sufficient to have that property only in the passband(s) of the filter, where |A(ω)| has relatively large values. Therefore, both magnitude and phase graphs (Bode plots) are customarily used to examine a filter&#x27;s linearity. A &quot;linear&quot; phase graph may contain discontinuities of π and/or 2π radians. The smaller ones happen where A(ω) changes sign. Since |A(ω)| cannot be negative, the changes are reflected in the phase plot. The 2π discontinuities happen because of plotting the principal value of formula_16  instead of the actual value.

In discrete-time applications, one only examines the region of frequencies between 0 and the Nyquist frequency, because of periodicity and symmetry. Depending on the frequency units, the Nyquist frequency may be 0.5, 1.0, π, or ½ of the actual sample-rate.  Some examples of linear and non-linear phase are shown below.

A discrete-time filter with linear phase may be achieved by an FIR filter which is either symmetric or anti-symmetric.  A necessary but not sufficient condition is:
:formula_17
for some formula_18.

== Generalized linear phase ==

Systems with generalized linear phase have an additional frequency-independent constant formula_19 added to the phase. In the discrete-time case, for example, the frequency response has the form:

:formula_20
:formula_21 for formula_22

Because of this constant, the phase of the system is not a strictly linear function of frequency, but it retains many of the useful properties of linear phase systems.

<text>==Events==

=== January events ===
* January – New Kolkata railway station for long-distance passengers officially inaugurated in Chitpur.
* January 5 – Railway workers across India begin voting on whether or not to hold a strike against Indian Railways in February. The union&#x27;s demands center around pay scales, pensions, and private investment into the railway. A Northern Railway Mazdoor Union spokesperson stated that the decision to hold the strike vote was made at the recent All India Railwaymen&#x27;s Union convention in Mumbai; Western Railway Mazdoor Sangh union members protested at the convention by burning an effigy of Indian Finance Minister P Chidambaram. Voting is scheduled to conclude on January 8, and the vote count, which is expected to begin on January 9, will be monitored by external observers.
* January 6 – China&#x27;s Minister of Railways Liu Zhijun announces details of a 160 billion yuan ($20 billion) plan for railway construction there in the coming year. The ministry expects to begin construction on as many as 87 new railway projects in 2006, including thirteen new express passenger train routes and opening new electrified lines. The plan also includes the acceleration of eleven express passenger route projects already under construction.

=== February events ===
* February 7 – Workers in Turkmenistan begin the final phase of construction on the Trans Karakum railway that will connect Ashgabat to Dashoguz, crossing the Karakum Desert. The new railway connection is expected to cut travel times between the two cities in half, bypassing the current circuitous route from Ashgabat through Mary and Lebap provinces and along the border with Uzbekistan. Once construction is completed, the official opening ceremony is expected to be held at the new Ichoguz station on the border between Ahal and Dashhowuz provinces.
* February 13 – Genesee &amp; Wyoming (G&amp;W) announces that it has sold its 50% share in operations (the other 50% was owned by Wesfarmers) of the Australian Railroad Group (ARG) in Western Australia to Queensland Rail (QR) and Babcock &amp; Brown (B&amp;B). The deal, valued at $974 million (A$1.55 billion), splits the holdings between operations and infrastructure elements with QR purchasing the above-rail operations and B&amp;B purchasing the below-rail infrastructure. In a concurrent deal, G&amp;W is purchasing Westfarmer&#x27;s share of ARG in South Australia for $15 million (A$22 million), which is renamed Genesee &amp; Wyoming Australia and operated as a subsidiary company of G&amp;W.
* February 20 – Officials in Thailand affirm that they will consider World Heritage Railway status for the Thailand-Burma Railway, also known as the Death Railway. Thousands of British, Dutch and Australian nationals perished in the railway&#x27;s prisoner of war construction camps during World War II, and the railway&#x27;s construction served as the inspiration for the 1957 film &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;. The campaign to gain heritage status is being led by Takashi Nagase, an English language teacher in Japan, who had served as an interpreter for the Japanese military during the war.

=== March events ===
* March – Guilford Rail System changes its name to Pan Am Railways.
* March 1 – South Korean railroad strike of 2006: Members of the Korean Railway Workers&#x27; Union begin a strike action against Korean National Railroad (Korail). Systemwide passenger service is reduced by 60% and freight service is also drastically reduced during the strike. Union members called the strike to protest Korail&#x27;s practice of replacing regular long-term positions with short-term contract positions. 
* March 9 – Groundbreaking ceremonies are held in Dublin, Ireland, on Spencer Station, the first new railway station to be built in the city in more than 100 years. The first shovelfuls of dirt were turned by Minister for Transport Martin Cullen. The new station, which is valued at €30 million, will serve the Maynooth and Navan lines and is planned as part of an extension of the city&#x27;s Luas light rail system to the north docks area. The new station, part of the Transport 21 plan announced in 2005, is expected to open in mid-2007.
* March 24 – Officials with the Portuguese firm Mota-Engil announce that the company will begin building a trans-Andean railway line in April 2006 that will connect Argentina and Chile. Construction of the new Transandino del Sur railway will begin near the Argentine city of Zapala and will run from there for the to the Chilean border; Mota-Engil expects to complete this section by 2008. From the border, the contract to build the segment to the Chilean city of Lonquimay, further, will be up for international bidding.
* March 27 – Second phase of the Kintetsu Keihanna Line opens for service between Ikoma Station and Gakken Nara-Tomigaoka Station, bringing railway service further into Kansai Science City.

=== April events ===
* April 1 – The London passenger rail services of West Anglia Great Northern and Thameslink are merged under First Capital Connect in a new franchise that will continue for six years. The new franchisee plans to overhaul the trains with new liveries and on-board services as well as an £8 million program of upgrades for several major stations.
* April 7 – Officials with BNSF Railway announce that the railway will become the first United States railroad to open an office in China when its office in Shanghai opens later in April. Both Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway, which both maintain track and operate in the US, already maintain offices in China, but this will be the first office for a US-headquartered railway. The office is hoped to help BNSF with logistics planning for containerized shipments between the US and Asia.
* April 10–14 – Conference of African Railway Ministers discusses integration and gauge standardisation.
* April 11 – Hong Kong&#x27;s Executive Council formally approves the merger of Kowloon-Canton Railway (KCR) and Mass Transit Railway (MTR). Officials close to the negotiations estimate a passenger fare reduction for as many as 2.8 million riders on the first day that the merger is effective. The proposal includes a formula for future fare adjustments. The resulting company will use the MTR name and identity; it will be responsible for the daily operation of both KCR and MTR systems. Although up to 700 layoffs are predicted due to job duplication, officials estimate that the combined company could be looking to hire 1,300 more employees within a few years.
* April 24 – Bern–Lötschberg–Simplon railway merges with Regionalverkehr Mittelland to form the new BLS AG, operating primarily in the Swiss Canton of Bern.
* April 25 – Officials with the governments of Spain and the Basque autonomous region sign an agreement outlining the proposed Basque Y railway service. The service would provide passenger and freight rail transport between the three Basque provincial capitals of Vitoria, Bilbao and Donostia and connections to the high-speed Madrid-Vitoria-Paris rail corridor. The agreement puts the section between Vitoria and Bilbao under Spanish control, and the section in Gipuzkoa province under Basque control.

<text>The Yemen national football team () represents Yemen in men&#x27;s international football and is administered by the Yemen Football Association.

When Yemen was split into North and South, two national teams existed. The current Yemeni national team inherits the records of North Yemen.

Despite being the 5th most populated country in the Middle East, Yemen has never achieved the same success as those with much smaller populations, only qualifying for the AFC Asian Cup once after unification in 1990.

==History==
===1965–1966===
A team representing the Sultanate of Lahej debuted at the 1965 Arab Games in Cairo, Egypt, losing both of their matches: 9–0 to Sudan and 16–1 to Libya. Meanwhile, despite a 4–0 drubbing by Syria, North Yemen beat Oman 2–1.

In April 1966, North Yemen debuted at the 1966 Arab Cup in Baghdad, Iraq, placed in Group 2. They lost their first match 4–1 to Syria and were then crushed 7–0 by Palestine three days later. On 5 April, they suffered an even heavier loss, 13–0 to Libya, thus finishing bottom of the group.

Also in 1966, North Yemen entered the Games of the New Emerging Forces in Cambodia and lost their opener 5–3 to Palestine.

===1984–1989===
Following the tournament in Cambodia, North Yemen did not play a match for eighteen years, returning in 1984 in an attempt to qualify to the 1984 Asian Cup. This was their first entrance of the competition. They were placed at the qualifiers in Group 3 with all matches held in Calcutta, India in October 1984. North Yemen lost the first match on 10 October, 6–0 to South Korea, for whom Park Sung-Hwa scored four goals and Chung Hae-Won two. Two days later, they lost 2–0 to hosts India. On 15 October North Yemen lost 4–1 to Pakistan and three days later by the same score to Malaysia. North Yemen finished at the bottom of the group.

North Yemen entered its first World Cup qualification campaign with the aim of securing a place in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. They were placed in Group 3 of the West Asia zone in the first round of the qualification campaign. North Yemen played their first match at home to Syria in Sana&#x27;a on 29 March 1985 and lost 1–0 to a 70th-minute goal. On 5 April, they lost 5–0 to Kuwait in Kuwait City. On 19 April, North Yemen lost 3–0 away to Syria at the Abbasiyyin Stadium in Damascus. On 26 April, while hosting Kuwait, North Yemen scored their only goal in the group as they lost 3–1 in front of 10,000 people.

In August 1985, North Yemen competed at the 1985 Arab Games in Rabat, Morocco and was placed in a group with Saudi Arabia, Algeria and the United Arab Emirates. They lost 2–0 to the Saudis on 5 August, 3–1 to Algeria on 7 August, and on 9 August beat the UAE 2–1 for their first ever victory.

On 15 October 1985, North Yemen played opposition from outside Asia and Africa for the first time, losing a friendly 2–0 to Mexico at home. 

=== Reunification of the North and South (1990s) ===
In the 1990, the North and South of Yemen re-united which prompted what is now the national team of Yemen to be merged from North Yemen. 

Upon being a new country, their captains alternated between matches to promote a &quot;unified&quot; Yemen. 

Starting in 1993, their first big task would be the qualification to the 1994 FIFA World Cup, because they did not enter the AFC Asian Cup in 1992, nor the Arab Cup. Yemen lost three games, against China once, and Iraq twice. They drew with Jordan twice, and won against China and Pakistan. This placed them third, five points from Iraq who were first, and ultimately ended their first ever World Cup qualification campaign.

The qualification campaign for the 1996 Asian Cup saw them get thrashed by Saudi Arabia as they lost 4–0 in the first leg, but put a fight in the second leg as they lost 1–0. Despite finishing last, on points with Kyrgyzstan, Yemen&#x27;s only redeeming event was a narrow 1–0 win against Kyrgyzstan, despite getting beat 3–1 in the return leg.

More years went by as Yemen continued to struggle, not only in Asia, but in the Middle East. The qualification campaign for the 1998 World Cup raised some spirits as they came in second above Indonesia and Cambodia. For the Yemenis, this was an ample progress as Uzbekistan, with 16 points, had stomped the first stage with having twice as many points as second-place Yemen at 8 points. While adding on to the fact that Yemen lost 1–0 to Uzbekistan, and despite losing 5–1 in the return leg, this gave the Yemenis a hopeful future for the upcoming tournaments.

===2000s===
Yemen started the millennium by attempting to qualify for the 2000 AFC Asian Cup. The &quot;Al-Yemen A&#x27;Sa&#x27;eed&quot; started off the year with a 3–0 win against Nepal following with a 0–1 loss to Turkmenistan. After this, it came to light that Kuwait had thrashed Bhutan 20–0 in the qualifiers which prompted doubt in the national team. Yemen lost 2–0 to Kuwait (with an own-goal added) and ended the qualification campaign with their highest win as they stomped Bhutan 11–2. These matches put Yemen at 6 points finishing above Nepal and Bhutan at third place of fifth.

The following year, in 2001, would be a high-point for the Yemeni fans as they watched their national team barely lose out on the advancement of the second round of the qualification campaign of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. They lost to United Arab Emirates who finished at top with 12 points while Yemen, along with India, sat at 11 points with Yemen scoring three more goals than India, despite the same goal-difference of six. They lost in both legs to United Arab Emirates.

However, for the Yemenis, disappointment would strike as they bombed their next big competition, the 2002 Arab Cup. This would be their first appearance since 1966 when they played as North Yemen, in which they also failed losing all three games and having a goal difference of −23. In 2012, they drew 2–2 with Saudi Arabia but lost to Lebanon 4–2, Bahrain 3–1 and Syria 0–4.

The qualification for the 2004 AFC Asian Cup would arrive as the next test for Yemen. The Yemenis were left stranded on the cusp of qualification as they were beat to the last spot by Indonesia by 3 points.

Days later, they would face yet another big tournament in quick succession which was the 16th Arabian Gulf Cup hosted by Kuwait. They came in dead last out of seven. They finished with 1 point, drawing with Oman and a goal difference of −16. But within a few months, the 17th Arabian Gulf Cup arrived, after their poor showing in the previous tournament. However, the Yemenis once again, to everyone&#x27;s expectations, failed to register a win with the only point coming from a 1–1 draw to Bahrain while losing 0–3 to Saudi Arabia and 3–1 to Kuwait.

Yemen would next look towards the qualification campaign of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. But the Yemenis would soon end it on a short note, as they finished bottom of the group with 5 points under Thailand, United Arab Emirates and North Korea (who won the group with 11 points) and one win, two draws and three losses.

A short time later would find the Yemenis preparing for the 18th Arabian Gulf Cup. Despite, as expected, finishing the group last, they finished with two losses against United Arab Emirates and Oman and the lone draw to Kuwait. 

Months later would see Yemen enter the qualification campaign of the 2007 AFC Asian Cup and were knocked out, once again. While Japan and Saudi Arabia qualified comfortably, Yemen achieved their only two wins against India. 

===2010s===
The next task for the Yemenis was the qualification campaign for the 2010 FIFA World Cup which was cut shorter than usual. In the first round, Yemen scored three goals without reply against Maldives, in the first leg. In the return leg, Maldives replied with two goals but in the end, it was not enough, and Yemen passed to the next stage. The second stage saw Yemen draw 1–1 with Thailand with the second leg finishing 1–0 in favor to Thailand thus knocking them out 3–2 on aggregate. This was the first time Yemen did not reach the group stages of a World Cup qualification stage.

Yemen started off the new year by hosting the 20th Arabian Gulf Cup for the first time. As hosts, they played in the May 22 Stadium in Aden against Saudi Arabia and lost 0–4. Yemen would go on and lose 2–1 and 0–3 to Qatar and Kuwait respectively thus crashing out of the group stages only scoring one goal while conceding nine.

The qualification campaign for the 2011 AFC Asian Cup was acceptable for Yemeni&#x27; standards. Grouped with Japan and Bahrain, and Hong Kong, they achieved two wins, one draw and three losses. They opened with a defeat of 2–1 to Japan and finished with holding Japan to the last minute for a 3–2 defeat.

Ten years later of their last participation, they entered the 2012 Arab Cup where they were grouped with Morocco, Bahrain and Libya. To the bewilderment of many football experts, Bahrain finished last with Yemen finishing third with three points.

However, in 2013, Yemen would participate in the 21st Arabian Gulf Cup, and they would record their worst run in the tournament where they were grouped with Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq. They didn&#x27;t record any goal and conceded six goals losing all three games.

As recent record showed, the Yemenis finished with their worst World Cup qualification campaign for the 2014 World Cup. They faced Iraq which they lost 2–0. The return leg was played in the United Arab Emirates due to the civil unrest in Yemen. This match saw Yemen and Iraq play out to a draw which ended Iraq going through 2–0 on aggregate and thus knocking Yemen out in the knock-out stages.

In December 2013, they sunk to their lowest rank ever on the FIFA rankings at 179th. From the start of January 2013 to December 2013, they lost half of what they had previously, going down nearly 50 points. This calling came for the Yemen Football Association to make a serious signing, when they signed Vladimir Petrović as the coach who had experience in Europe as a player and of Red Star Belgrade fame. Vladmir Petrović quit as Yemen&#x27;s manager in May 2014. 

Because of this, Yemen dropped to their lowest and worst in Yemen&#x27;s football: 186th. In preparation for the 22nd Arabian Gulf Cup, they hired Czech youth teams&#x27; manager Miroslav Soukup to attempt to revive the national team. Once again, Yemen was eliminated without winning a match, but for the first time in their Gulf Cup history, they didn&#x27;t finish last.

==== Debut at the 2019 AFC Asian Cup ====
The 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification happened with the outbreak of the civil war, leaving majority of the national team&#x27;s players and staff to escape to Djibouti by boat, which made headline by the media. Yemen only managed to defeat two opponents, Pakistan and the Philippines, while they lost to other opponents, thus Yemen ended their qualification with bottom record. During the 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification, which was the first attempt of Yemen to qualify to the tournament as an unified nation, Yemen has defeated Tajikistan 2–1 on 23 March 2017, while maintaining four consecutive draws against Nepal and Philippines. Yemen had a big chance to qualify to its first international tournament in its history as a unified country. Finally, with the help from the Philippines when they defeated Tajikistan 2–1 in Manila, Yemen had finally qualified to the 2019 AFC Asian Cup for the first time in its history beating Nepal 2–1 in the last fixtures.

===== Group F =====
In the team&#x27;s maiden AFC Asian Cup, Yemen was grouped in Group D with Iraq, Iran and Vietnam. Their opening campaign was against Iran, which participated in the previous 2018 FIFA World Cup and had almost eliminated Spain in the progress. Yemen played well in the first ten minutes and almost scored a goal, but aftermath saw Iran completely dominate Yemen and the latter suffered a heavy 0–5 defeat to Iran. Yemen later fell to Iraq 0–3 after being unable to repel Iraqi pressure, and later lost to Southeast Asian opponent Vietnam 0–2 which saw Yemen finished last with no goal and no point. All three opponents of Yemen would soon progress from the group stage.

Yemen later participated in the 2019 WAFF Championship where they were grouped with host Iraq, Palestine, Syria and Lebanon. The Yemeni side was eliminated from the group stage this time, but they managed to finish in third place, even above Lebanon and Syria, thanked for a 2–1 over the former and a 1–1 draw to the latter. Despite this, Yemen once again failed in the 24th Arabian Gulf Cup, scoring no goal and conceded nine, but the Yemenis successfully gained a goalless draw to Iraq to win its first major point since 2014 edition.

=== 2020s ===
Between these competitions, Yemen participated in the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC second round where they were grouped with Uzbekistan, minnows Singapore and fellow Arab rivals Saudi Arabia and Palestine. During their first games, Yemen got two points after two 2–2 draws over minnows Singapore away and more importantly, the encouraging draw to powerhouse Saudi Arabia in Bahrain, with the Yemenis taking the lead twice, to end their losing streak to Saudi Arabia since 2002. Yet, Yemen slumped later after receiving a 0–5 demolition from Uzbekistan, before beating Palestine 1–0 to gain its first major win in this qualification round. However, disappointment would soon return when Yemen suffered a heartbreaking loss to Singapore 1–2 and put its qualification at risk. Ultimately, Yemen failed to gain any further momentum, losing to both Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Palestine in the end.

Yemen played in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification first round against Sri Lanka in where they would play their home ground in Saudi Arabia due to the ongoing civil war in Yemen. On 12 October 2023, Yemen secured a 3–0 win over Sri Lanka at the Damac Club Stadium in Khamis Mushait.

Yemen was drawn in the final round of the 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualification on Group B with Lebanon, Bhutan and Brunei. On 28 December 2024, Yemen secured their first ever win in the Arabian Gulf Cup, by achieving a 2–1 victory over Bahrain during the 26th edition.

<text>Arnold Josiah Ford (23 April 1877 – 16 September 1935) was a Barbadian American spiritual leader, recognized as a pioneering figure of the Black Hebrew movement.

==Biography==
Ford was born in Barbados to Edward Thomas Ford and Elizabeth Augustine Ford. He grew up to become a musician in the Royal Navy before settling in the United States. Talented as a linguist, poet, musician and composer of many Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL) songs, Ford co-authored &quot;The Universal Ethiopian Anthem&quot; with Benjamin E. Burrell. Ford officially functioned as director of UNIA Band, Orchestra, Band of the African Legion, and the Liberty Hall Choir. He published the &quot;Universal Ethiopian Hymnal&quot; in 1920.

Following Garvey’s arrest and conviction, Ford founded the Beth B’Nai Israel Synagogue in a Harlem storefront, and declared himself to be a rabbi. He was never recognized as such by the wider Jewish community. In 1930 he and a small group of Black Jews went to Ethiopia, where they participated in the coronation of Emperor Haile Selassie. They created a school, and acquired of land for the purpose of uniting Black Jews of the Diaspora with their brothers already in Ethiopia. He died there in 1935. His daughter Arlein Ford Straw became a composer, music educator, and church music director in New York City.

While Ford&#x27;s religious congregations did not survive, his influence is strongest through Wentworth Arthur Matthew, one time student of Ford, and founder of the Commandment Keepers. Ford provided Matthew with a certificate of rabbinic ordination from Ethiopia, signed by himself as the &quot;Chief Rabbi of Ethiopia&quot;.

Shais Rishon, a Black Orthodox Jewish writer and activist, has claimed that &quot;Ford never belonged nor converted to any branch of Judaism.&quot;

<doc id="1291198" wikidata="Q976924" url="?curid=1291198" title="Donald Hall">
<text>Donald Andrew Hall Jr. (September 20, 1928 – June 23, 2018) was an American poet, writer, editor, and literary critic. He was the author of more than 50 books across several genres from children&#x27;s literature, biography, memoir, essays, and including 22 volumes of verse. Hall was a graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy, Harvard University, and Christ Church, Oxford. Early in his career, he became the first poetry editor of &quot;The Paris Review&quot; (1953–1961), the quarterly literary journal, and was noted for interviewing poets and other authors on their craft.

On June 14, 2006, Hall was appointed as the Library of Congress&#x27;s 14th Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry (commonly known as &quot;Poet Laureate of the United States&quot;). He is regarded as a &quot;plainspoken, rural poet,&quot; and it has been said that, in his work, he &quot;explores the longing for a more bucolic past and reflects [an] abiding reverence for nature.&quot;

Hall was respected for his work as an academic, having taught at Stanford University, Bennington College and the University of Michigan, and having made significant contributions to the study and craft of writing.

==Life and career==

===Early life and education===
Hall was born in Hamden, Connecticut, the only child of Donald Andrew Hall, a businessman, and Lucy Wells. He was educated at Phillips Exeter Academy, then earned an A.B. magna cum laude from Harvard in 1951, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and a B.Litt., from Christ Church, Oxford in 1953.

Hall began writing even before reaching his teens, beginning with poems and short stories, and then moving on to novels and dramatic verse. Hall continued to write throughout his prep school years at Exeter, and, while still only sixteen years old, attended the Bread Loaf Writers&#x27; Conference, where he made his first acquaintance with the poet Robert Frost. That same year, he published his first work. While an undergraduate at Harvard, Hall served on the editorial board of &quot;The Harvard Advocate&quot;, and got to know a number of people who, like him, were poised with significant ambitions in the literary world, amongst them John Ashbery, Robert Bly, Kenneth Koch, Frank O&#x27;Hara, and Adrienne Rich. During his senior year, he won the Glascock Prize that Koch had won 3 years earlier.

After leaving Harvard, Hall went to Oxford for two years, to study for the B.Litt. He was the editor of the magazine &quot;Oxford Poetry&quot;, as literary editor of Isis, as editor of New Poems, and as poetry editor of &quot;The Paris Review&quot;. At the end of his first Oxford year, Hall also won the university&#x27;s Newdigate Prize, awarded for his long poem, &#x27;Exile&#x27;. In September 1952, he married his first wife, Kirby Thompson, with whom he had his son and daughter.

On returning to the United States, Hall went to Stanford University, where he spent one year as a creative writing fellow, studying under the poet-critic, Yvor Winters. Following his year at Stanford, Hall went back to Harvard, where he spent three years in the Society of Fellows. During that time, he put together his first book, &quot;Exiles and Marriages&quot;. In 1957, with Robert Pack and Louis Simpson, he edited an anthology which was to make a significant impression on both sides of the Atlantic, &quot;New Poets of England and America.&quot; It was later juxtaposed with Donald Allen&#x27;s &quot;The New American Poetry 1945–1960&quot;. In 1968, he signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.

While teaching at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, he met the poet Jane Kenyon, whom he married in 1972. Three years later, the couple moved to Eagle Pond Farm, his grandparents&#x27; former home in Wilmot, New Hampshire. Hall and Kenyon were profiled at their home in a 1993 PBS documentary, &quot;A Life Together&quot;, which aired as an episode of &quot;Bill Moyers Journal&quot;. In 1989, when Hall was in his early sixties, it was discovered that he had colon cancer. Surgery followed, but by 1992 the cancer had metastasized to his liver. After another operation, and chemotherapy, he went into remission, though he was told that he only had a one-in-three chance of surviving the next five years. Then, early in 1994, it was discovered that Kenyon had leukemia. Her illness, her death fifteen months later, and Hall&#x27;s struggle to come to terms with these things, were the subject of his 1998 book, &quot;Without&quot;. Another book of poems dedicated to Kenyon, &quot;Painted Bed&quot;, is cited by &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; as &quot;more controlled, more varied and more powerful, this taut follow-up volume reexamines Hall&#x27;s grief while exploring the life he has made since. The book&#x27;s first poem, &#x27;Kill the Day,&#x27; stands among the best Hall has ever written. It examines mourning in 16 long-lined stanzas, alternating catalogue with aphorism, understatement with keen lament: &#x27;How many times will he die in his own lifetime?&#x27;&quot;

Hall served as a member of the editorial board for poetry at the Wesleyan University Press from 1958 to 1964. He was closely affiliated with the Bennington College&#x27;s graduate writing program since 1994, giving lectures and readings annually.

===Career===

Hall published fifteen books of poetry, most recently &quot;White Apples and the Taste of Stone&quot; (2006), &quot;The Painted Bed&quot; (2002) and &quot;Without: Poems&quot; (1998), which was published on the third anniversary of Kenyon&#x27;s death. Most of the poems in &quot;Without&quot; deal with Kenyon&#x27;s illness and death, and many are epistolary poems. In addition to poetry, he also wrote several memoirs (among them &quot;Life Work&quot; and &quot;String Too Short to be Saved&quot;), children&#x27;s books (notably &quot;Ox-Cart Man&quot;, which won the Caldecott Medal), and a number of plays. His recurring themes include New England rural living, baseball, and how work conveys meaning to ordinary life. He is regarded as a master both of received forms and free verse, and a champion of the art of revision, for whom writing is a craft, not merely a mode of self-expression. Hall won many awards, including two Guggenheim Fellowships and a Robert Frost Medal, and served as poet laureate of his state. He lived and worked at Eagle Pond Farm.

When not working on poems, he turned his hand to reviews, criticism, textbooks, sports journalism, memoirs, biographies, children&#x27;s stories, and plays. He also devoted a lot of time to editing. Between 1983 and 1996 he oversaw publication of more than sixty titles for the University of Michigan Press alone. He was for five years Poet Laureate of his home state, New Hampshire (1984–89), and among the many other honours and awards to have come his way were: the Lamont Poetry Prize for &quot;Exiles and Marriages&quot; (1955), the Edna St Vincent Millay Award (1956), two Guggenheim Fellowships (1963–64, 1972–73), inclusion on the Horn Book Honour List (1986), the Sarah Josepha Hale Award (1983), the Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize (1987), the National Book Critics Circle Award for Poetry (1988), the NBCC Award (1989), the Los Angeles Times Book Prize in poetry (1989), and the Frost Medal (1990). He was nominated for the National Book Award on three separate occasions (1956, 1979 and 1993). In 1994, he received the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize for his lifetime achievement.

Hall was named the fourteenth U.S. Poet Laureate, succeeding Ted Kooser. He served from October 1, 2006, and was succeeded by Charles Simic the following year. At the time of his appointment, Hall was profiled in an episode of &quot;The News Hour with Jim Lehrer&quot; which aired on October 16, 2006. Hall was awarded the 2010 National Medal of Arts by President Barack Obama.

Hall&#x27;s penultimate work is a 2018 recording of an eleven-song cycle on the topic of mortality, entitled &quot;Mortality Mansions: Songs of Love and Loss After 60.&quot; The poems are by Hall and are read by the author, the music is by Grammy Award-winning composer Herschel Garfein.

His last book &quot;A Carnival of Losses: Essays Nearing Ninety&quot; was published on July 10, 2018.

===Film===
Donald Hall was the subject of a short documentary by Paul Szynol called &quot;Quiet Hours&quot;. He also appeared in Ken Burns&#x27;s 1994 documentary on baseball.

=== Music ===
Donald Hall was the subject of &quot;Great Gig in the Sky,&quot; the 5th track of Roger Waters&#x27; album The Dark Side of the Moon Redux, released on October 6th, 2023. The song discusses Donald Hall&#x27;s passing, in which his assistant, Kendel Currier, contacts Waters informing him that Hall is in the hospital with sinus cancer. The song continues, eventually revealing that an estate sale was organized for the Eagle Farm, where Waters requested &quot;a couple of bale hooks and some baling twine from the barn.&quot; The lyrics refer to Donald Hall&#x27;s &quot;red chair&quot; - although his chair, famously, was blue. Whether this is a mistake or artistic licence is unclear. The song ends with &quot;Well, R.I.P., Donald Hall.&quot;

==Personal life==
Hall lived at Eagle Pond Farm in Wilmot, New Hampshire, a small town in Merrimack County. He was married to poet and author Jane Kenyon (1947–1995) for 23 years and lived with her until her death. Hall died on June 23, 2018, at the age of 89, at his home in Wilmot.

<text>Seán Daniel Treacy (22 September 1923 – 23 March 2018) was an Irish Labour Party politician who served as Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann from 1973 to 1977 and 1987 to 1997. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Tipperary South constituency from 1961 to 1997. He also served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Munster constituency from 1981 to 1984.

==Political career==
Author R. M. Douglas wrote that Treacy was a party member of fringe Fascist group Ailtirí na hAiséirghe during the 1940s. However, by the 1960s Treacy had moved to the ideological left, albeit he was still considered to be socially conservative. Treacy was first elected to the Dáil at the 1961 general election, as a Labour Party TD for the Tipperary South constituency. He was re-elected there in seven subsequent elections, and returned automatically in three more owing to his having been elected by the Dáil as Ceann Comhairle. He was elected to that office first after the 1973 general election for one term, then after the 1987 general election for three. As Ceann Comhairle, he was a member of the Irish Presidential Commission during the presidential vacancies of 1974 and 1976.

He served as an MEP from 1981 to 1984, replacing Eileen Desmond who resigned as an MEP when she was appointed Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare.

He was expelled from the Labour Party in 1985 for voting against the family planning bill, which would have liberalised the sale of contraception in the Republic of Ireland. He was elected as an Independent TD at the 1987 general election. After that election, he was elected as Ceann Comhairle by the Dáil. One of his first acts was to exercise his casting vote in favour of the nomination of Charles Haughey as Taoiseach. Treacy retired from politics at the 1997 general election, the only Ceann Comhairle to retire from the position at an election, rather than exercising his right of automatic re-election.

He died in Waterford on 23 March 2018, at the age of 94. His funeral, which was attended by President Michael D. Higgins, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and former Minister Martin Mansergh, was held on 26 March 2018.

<text>General (Honorary) Ira Clarence Eaker (April 13, 1896 – August 6, 1987) was a general of the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. Eaker, as second-in-command of the prospective Eighth Air Force, was sent to England to form and organize its bomber command. While he struggled to build up airpower in England, the organization of the Army Air Forces evolved and he was named commander of the Eighth Air Force on December 1, 1942.

Although his background was in single-engine fighter aircraft, Eaker became the architect of a strategic bombing force that ultimately numbered forty groups of 60 heavy bombers each, supported by a subordinate fighter command of 1,500 aircraft, most of which was in place by the time he relinquished command at the start of 1944. Eaker then took overall command of four Allied air forces based in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, and by the end of World War II had been named Deputy Commander of the U.S. Army Air Forces. He worked in the aerospace industry following his retirement from the military, then became a newspaper columnist.

==Childhood and education==
Eaker was born in Field Creek, Texas, in 1896, the son of a Dutch tenant farmer. He attended Southeastern State Teachers College in Durant, Oklahoma, and then joined the United States Army in 1917. He was appointed a second lieutenant of Infantry, Officer&#x27;s Reserve Corps, and assigned to active duty with the 64th Infantry Regiment at Camp Bliss, El Paso, Texas. The 64th Infantry was assigned to the 14th Infantry Brigade on December 20, 1917, to be part of the 7th Infantry Division when it deployed to France. On November 15, 1917, Eaker received a commission in the Regular Army. He later received a Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism from the University of Southern California in 1934.

==Air Service and Air Corps career==
Eaker remained with the 64th Infantry until March 1918, when he was placed on detached service to receive flying instruction at Austin and Kelly Fields in Texas. Upon graduation the following October, he was rated a pilot and assigned to Rockwell Field, California.

In July 1919, he transferred to the Philippine Islands, where he served with the 2d Aero Squadron at Fort Mills until September 1919; with the 3d Aero Squadron at Camp Stotsenburg until September 1920, and as executive officer of the Department Air Office, Department and Assistant Department Air Officer, Philippine Department, and in command of the Philippine Air Depot at Manila until September 1921.

Meanwhile, on July 1, 1920, he was commissioned into the Regular Army as a captain in the Air Service and returned to the United States in January 1922, for duty at Mitchel Field, New York, where he commanded the 5th Aero Squadron and later was post adjutant.

In June 1924, Eaker was named executive assistant in the Office of Air Service at Washington, D.C., and from December 21, 1926, to May 2, 1927, he served as a pilot of one of the Loening OA-1 float planes of the Pan American Goodwill Flight that made a 22,000 mile (35,200 km) trip around South America and, with the others, was awarded the Mackay Trophy. He then became executive officer in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of War at Washington, D.C.

In September 1926, he was named operations and line maintenance officer at Bolling Field, Washington, D.C. While on that duty, he participated as chief pilot on the endurance flight of the Army plane, &quot;Question Mark&quot;, from 1 to January 7, 1929, establishing a new world flight endurance record. For this achievement the entire crew of five, including Eaker and mission commander Major Carl Spaatz, were awarded the DFC. In 1930, he made the first transcontinental flight entirely with instruments.

In October 1934, Eaker was ordered to duty at March Field, Calif., where he commanded the 34th Pursuit Squadron and later the 17th Pursuit Squadron. In the summer of 1935, he was detached for duty with the Navy and participated aboard the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Lexington&quot;, on maneuvers in Hawaii and Guam.

Eaker entered the Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field, Alabama, in August 1935, and upon graduation the following June entered the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, from which he graduated in June 1937. During his time at Ft Leavenworth from June 3–7, 1936, Eaker made the first blind (instruments only) transcontinental flight from New York to Los Angeles. He then became assistant chief of the Information Division in the Office of the Chief of Air Corps (OCAC) at Washington, D.C., during which he helped plan and publicize the interception of the Italian liner &quot;Rex&quot; at sea. In November 1940, Eaker was given command of the 20th Pursuit Group at Hamilton Field, California. He was promoted in 1941 to colonel while at Hamilton Field.

==World War II==
Promoted to brigadier general in January 1942, he was assigned to organize the VIII Bomber Command (which became the Eighth Air Force) in England and to understudy the British system of bomber operations. Then, in December 1942, he assumed command of the Eighth Air Force. In a speech he gave to the British that won him favorable publicity, he said, &quot;We won&#x27;t do much talking until we&#x27;ve done more fighting. After we&#x27;ve gone, we hope you&#x27;ll be glad we came.&quot;

Much of Eaker&#x27;s initial staff, including Captain Frederick W. Castle, Captain Beirne Lay, Jr., and Lieutenant Harris Hull, was composed of reserve rather than career military officers, and the group became known as &quot;Eaker&#x27;s Amateurs&quot;. Eaker&#x27;s position as commander of the Eighth Air Force led to his becoming the model for the fictional Major General Pat Pritchard in the 1949 movie &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot;.

Throughout the war, Eaker was an advocate for daylight &quot;precision&quot; bombing of military and industrial targets in German-occupied territory and ultimately Germany—of striking at the enemy&#x27;s ability to wage war while minimizing civilian casualties. The British considered daylight bombing too risky and wanted the Americans to join them in night raids that would target wider areas, but Eaker persuaded a skeptical Winston Churchill that the American and British approaches complemented each other in a one-page memo that concluded, &quot;If the RAF continues night bombing and we bomb by day, we shall bomb them round the clock and the devil shall get no rest.&quot; He personally participated in the first US B-17 Flying Fortress bomber strike against German occupation forces in France, bombing Rouen on August 17, 1942.
Eaker was promoted to major general in September 1943. However, as American bomber losses mounted from German defensive fighter aircraft attacks on deep penetration missions beyond the range of available fighter cover, Eaker may have lost some of the confidence of USAAF Commanding General Henry Arnold. To reduce losses to fighters, Eaker was a strong advocate of the Boeing YB-40 Flying Fortress, a B-17 Flying Fortress which carried additional gun turrets and gunners instead of a bomb load and was intended to act as a long-range, &quot;gunship&quot; escort for conventional bombers. However the YB-40 was not a success in combat.

Eaker also strongly advocated work on improving the range of escort fighters using drop tanks, so that his Republic P-47 Thunderbolts could stay with the bomber formations for longer periods. Eaker strictly followed the prevailing American doctrine of requiring fighters to stay near the bombers, but this stricture was proving frustrating to the fighter groups, who advocated for free rein in clearing the skies of enemy aircraft ahead of the bomber paths. Eaker&#x27;s air force was bleeding men; from July through November 1943, the 8th lost 64% of its aircrew. When General Dwight D. Eisenhower was named Supreme Allied Commander in December 1943, he proposed to use his existing team of subordinate commanders, including Lieutenant General Jimmy Doolittle, in key positions. Doolittle was named Eighth Air Force Commander, and Arnold concurred with the change. After a rocky start, Doolittle greatly improved on Eaker&#x27;s record by releasing the American fighter groups to hunt down enemy fighters.

Eaker was reassigned as Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces, previous commander Tedder having been selected by Eisenhower to plan the air operations for the Normandy invasion. Eaker had under his command the Twelfth and Fifteenth Air Forces and the British Desert and Balkan Air Forces. He did not approve of the plan to bomb Monte Cassino in February 1944, considering it a dubious military target, but ultimately signed off the mission and gave in to pressure from ground commanders. Historians of the era now generally believe Eaker&#x27;s skepticism was correct and that the ancient abbey at Monte Cassino could have been preserved without jeopardizing the allied advance through Italy. He personally led the first raid of Operation Frantic on 2 July 1944, flying in a B-17 called &quot;Yankee Doodle II&quot; and landing at a Soviet base at Poltava in Ukraine.

On April 30, 1945, General Eaker was named deputy commander of the Army Air Forces and Chief of the Air Staff. He retired on August 31, 1947, and was promoted to lieutenant general in the newly established United States Air Force on the retired list June 29, 1948.

Almost 40 years after his retirement, Congress attempted to pass special legislation awarding four-star status in the U.S. Air Force to General Eaker, prompted by retired Air Force Reserve major general and Senator Barry Goldwater (R-AZ). Goldwater had originally wanted to simply promote Jimmy Doolittle to four star rank, but was told by Air Force Secretary Verne Orr that this would put Eaker in an awkward position because he &quot;had greater responsibilities during World War II.&quot; In order to cure this defect the Doolittle promotion was enlarged to include Eaker. Goldwater first proposed a bill of relief that waived both officers&#x27; ineligibility for promotion. However, the legislation stalled in the House, which prompted Goldwater to only seek confirmation via the Senate, which was arguably unlawful because of statutory restrictions on general officers that required them to be in active service. On April 26, 1985, Chief of Staff General Charles A. Gabriel and Ruth Eaker, the general&#x27;s wife, pinned on his fourth star. Later, in 1986, the Comptroller General ruled that the promotion was unlawful for pay or benefit purposes due to the lack of implementing legislation.

==Civilian career==
Ten days before the Democratic Party primary runoff election of the 1948 United States Senate election in Texas on Saturday, August 28, 1948, Eaker spoke in support of candidate Lyndon B. Johnson. Coke R. Stevenson&#x27;s campaign attacked Eaker, and Eaker was defended by other prominent military officers and Johnson. Criticizing a prominent military leader so soon after World War II likely had a negative effect on Stevenson&#x27;s turnout in the election, and in Howard County in particular (which had quartered an Army Air Force Bombardier School during World War II) returned an abnormally high net gain for Johnson as compared to his gains in other areas. Johnson won the election by a small margin.

Eaker was a vice president of Hughes Tool Company and Hughes Aircraft (1947–1957) and of Douglas Aircraft (1957–1961).

While stationed in New York in the early 1920s, Eaker studied law at Columbia University. Eaker went back to school in the early 1930s at the University of Southern California and received a degree in journalism.
With Henry Arnold, Eaker co-authored &quot;This Flying Game&quot; (1936),
&quot;Winged Warfare&quot; (1937),

and &quot;Army Flyer&quot; (1942). Starting in 1962, he wrote a weekly column, carried by many newspapers, on military affairs.

Eaker was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame, in Dayton, Ohio, in 1970. Over his 30 years of flying, General Eaker accumulated 12,000 flying hours as pilot.

On September 26, 1978, the U.S. Congress passed, and on October 10, 1978, President Jimmy Carter signed, Public Law 95-438, which awarded the Congressional Gold Medal to General Eaker, &quot;in recognition of his distinguished career as an aviation pioneer and Air Force leader&quot;.

Eaker died August 6, 1987, at Malcolm Grow Medical Center, Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

Blytheville Air Force Base, Strategic Air Command (SAC) installation, was renamed Eaker Air Force Base on May 26, 1988. Eaker AFB was closed on March 6, 1992, due to Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) action. Military to civilian conversion began, and public aircraft began using the decommissioned base. The military still uses the renamed Arkansas International Airport.

The airport in Durant, Oklahoma was renamed Eaker Field to honor Eaker, a graduate of Southeastern State College in Durant. Now known as Southeastern Oklahoma State University, the student aviation majors use the airport as the home of the flight school.

<doc id="1291211" wikidata="Q5521406" url="?curid=1291211" title="Gann angles">
<text>The Gann angles are named after W. D. Gann, a 20th-century market theorist. Gann described the use of the angles in the stock market in &quot;The Basis of My Forecasting Method&quot;, a 33-page course written in 1935. The legitimacy of Gann&#x27;s techniques has been seriously questioned. Calculating a &quot;Gann angle&quot; is equivalent to finding the derivative of a particular line on a chart in a simple way.

A Gann angle is a straight line on a price chart, giving a fixed relation between time and price. For Gann the most important angle was the line which represented one unit of price for one unit of time, called the 1x1 or the 45° angle.
The value of a commodity or stock following this angle will for example increase by one point per day. Other important angles were the 2x1 (moving up two points per day), the 3x1, the 4x1, the 8x1, and the 16x1.
In addition to these value increases, the corresponding angles for value decrease are just as important.
When several of these angles are drawn in a group, they are often called a Gann fan, which is usually drawn from a price bottom or a price top.

As with other forms of technical analysis of stock price movements, the Gann angle model contradicts the weakest form of the efficient-market hypothesis which states that past price movements cannot be used to forecast future price movements.

== Using Gann angles ==

Gann watched for important tops and bottoms to form on a daily, weekly, or monthly chart and drew his angles from these changes in trend. When the trend is up and the price stays in the space above an ascending angle without breaking below it, the market is strong; when the trend is down and the price remains below a descending angle without breaking above it, the market is weak. The market shows its relative strength or weakness according to the angle it is above or below. For example, if the price is above the 2x1 the market has shown itself to be much more bullish than if it is above the 1x1. In his angles course, Gann argues that when an uptrending price reverses and breaks under an ascending angle, the tendency of the price is to go to the next nearest angle below it; likewise, when a downtrending price reverses and breaks up through a descending angle, the tendency of the price is to go to the next nearest angle above it.

== Question of scale ==

It is not always practical to give the 1x1 a value of 1 point of price for each day, as Gann observed in his course. If, for example, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is trading around 10,000 points, it can be more helpful to apply a scale in which a certain number of points (like 100 or 1,000) is used as the price unit.

Critics note that Gann did not set down rules for such cases and that the positioning of the angles on a chart is therefore entirely arbitrary and not scientific. This may not necessarily invalidate the methods Gann used himself, as it is not known whether he intentionally left some parts undisclosed.

<doc id="1291214" wikidata="Q1516656" url="?curid=1291214" title="History of Wiltshire">
<text>Wiltshire is a historic county located in the South West England region. Wiltshire is landlocked and is in the east of the region.

==Medieval history==
The English conquest of the district now known as Wiltshire began in 552 AD with the victory of Saxon Cynric over the native Britons at Old Sarum, by which the way was opened to Salisbury Plain. Four years later, pushing his way through the Vale of Pewsey, Cynric extended the limits of the West Saxon kingdom to the Marlborough Downs by a victory at Barbury Hill. At that period the district south of the River Avon and the River Nadder was occupied by dense woodland, the relics of which survive in Cranborne Chase, and the first wave of West Saxon colonisation was chiefly confined to the valleys of the River Avon and the River Wylye. The little township of Wilton which arose in the latter valley gave the name of Wilsætan to the new settlers.

By the 9th century the district had acquired a definite administrative and territorial organization. Weohstan, ealdorman of the Wilsætan, was mentioned as early as 800/802 as repelling an attempted invasion by the Mercians. Moreover, Wiltunshire is mentioned by Asser in 878, in which year the Danes established their headquarters at Chippenham and remained there a year, plundering the surrounding country. In the time of Athelstan there were mints at Old Sarum, Malmesbury, Wilton, Cricklade and Marlborough. Wilton and Salisbury were destroyed by the Danish invaders under Sweyn I of Denmark in 1003, and in 1015 the district was harried by Canute.

==Land ownership after the Norman Conquest==

With the redistribution of estates after the Norman Conquest more than two-fifths of the county fell into the hands of the church; the possessions of the Crown covered one-fifth; while among the chief lay proprietors were Edward of Salisbury, William, Count of Eu, Ralf de Mortimer, Aubrey de Vere II, Robert Fitzgerald, Miles Crispin, Robert d&#x27;Oily and Osbern Giffard. The first Earl of Wiltshire after the Conquest was William le Scrope, who received the honour in 1397. The title subsequently passed to Sir James Butler in 1449, Sir John Stafford in 1470, Thomas Boleyn in 1529, and in 1550 to the Paulet family.

The Benedictine foundations at Wilton, Malmesbury and Amesbury existed before the Conquest; the Augustinian Bradenstoke Priory was founded by Walter d&#x27;Évreux in 1142; that at Lacock by Ela, countess of Salisbury, in 1232; that at Longleat by Sir John Vernon before 1272. The Cluniac priory of Monkton Farleigh was founded by Humphrey II de Bohun in 1125; the Cistercian house at Kingswood, Gloucestershire by William de Berkeley in 1139; and that of Stanley by the Empress Matilda in 1154.

==Wiltshire&#x27;s hundreds==

Of the forty Wiltshire hundreds mentioned in the Domesday Survey, Selkley, Ramsbury, Bradford, Melksham, Calne, Whorwellsdown, Westbury, Warminster, Heytesbury, Kinwardstone, Ambresbury, Underditch, Furstfield, Alderbury and Downton remain to the present day practically unaltered in name and extent; Thorngrave, Dunelawe and Cepeham hundreds form the modern hundred of Chippenham; Malmesbury hundred represents the parishes that were within the Domesday hundreds of Cicemethorn and Sterchelee, which were held at farm by the Abbot of Malmesbury; Highworth represents the Domesday hundreds of Crechelade, Scipe, Wurde and Staple; Kingbridge the hundreds of Chingbridge, Blachegrave and Thornhylle; Swanborough the hundreds of Rugeberge, Stodfold and Swaneberg; Branch the hundreds of Branchesberge and Dolesfeld; Cawden the hundreds of Cawdon and Cadworth.

A noticeable feature in the 14th century is the aggregation of church manors into distinct hundreds, at the court of which their ecclesiastical owners required their tenants to do suit and service. Thus the bishop of Winchester had a separate hundred called Kurwel Bishop, afterwards absorbed in Downton hundred; the abbot of Damerham had that of Damerham; and the prior of St. Swithins that of Elstub, under each of which were included manors situated in other parts of the county.

==Ancient moot places and meeting points==

The meeting-place (or moot) of Swanborough Hundred was at Swanborough Tump, a hillock in the parish of Manningford Abbots identified as the moot-place mentioned in the will of King Alfred; that of Malmesbury was at Colepark; that of Bradford-upon-Avon at Bradford Leigh; that of Warminster at Iley Oak, about three kilometres (2 mi) south of Warminster, near Southleigh Wood. The shire court for Wiltshire was held at Wilton, and until 1446 the shrievalty was enjoyed &quot;ex officio&quot; by the castellans of Old Sarum. Edward of Salisbury was sheriff at the time of the Domesday Survey, and the office remained hereditary in his family, descending to William Longespee by his marriage with Ela, great-granddaughter of Edward. In the 13th century the assizes were held at Wilton, Malmesbury and New Sarum (Salisbury).

==Religious administrative areas==

On the division of the West Saxon see in 703, Wiltshire was included in the diocese of Sherborne, but in 905 a separate diocese of Ramsbury was founded, the see being fixed alternately at Ramsbury, Wilton and Sonning in Berkshire. Shortly before the Conquest, Ramsbury was reunited to the Sherborne diocese, and the see was transferred to Salisbury. The archdeaconries of Wiltshire and Salisbury are mentioned in 1180; in 1291 the former included the deaneries of Avebury, Malmesbury, Marlborough and Cricklade within this county, and the latter the deaneries of Amesbury, Potterne, Wilton, Chalke and Wylye. In 1535 the archdeaconry of Salisbury included the additional deanery of Salisbury, while Potterne deanery had been transferred to the archdeaconry of Wiltshire. The deaneries of the archdeaconry of Salisbury have remained unaltered; Wiltshire archdeaconry now includes the deaneries of Avebury, Marlborough and Potterne; and the deaneries of Chippenham, Cricklade and Malmesbury form part of the archdeaconry and diocese of Bristol.

==Early political history==
Wiltshire has traditionally been a peaceful county, with little impact on national political history. In 1086, after the completion of the Domesday Survey, Salisbury was the scene of a great council, in which all the landholders took oaths of allegiance to the king. A council for the same purpose assembled at Salisbury in 1116. Nearby at Clarendon, the assize which remodelled the provincial administration of justice was drawn up in 1166. Parliaments were held at Marlborough in 1267 and at Salisbury in 1328 and 1384.

During the wars of Stephen&#x27;s reign, Salisbury, Devizes and Malmesbury were garrisoned by Roger, Bishop of Salisbury, for the Empress, but in 1138 Stephen seized the bishop and captured Devizes Castle. In 1216, Marlborough Castle was surrendered to Louis by Hugh de Neville. Hubert de Burgh escaped in 1233 from Devizes Castle, where he had been imprisoned in the previous year.

==The Civil War==
In the Civil War of the 17th century, Wiltshire actively supported the parliamentary cause, displaying a spirit of violent anti-Catholicism. The efforts of the Marquess of Hertford and of Lord Seymour to raise a party for the king met with vigorous resistance from the inhabitants. However, the Royalists made some progress in the early stage of the struggle against the Roundheads, with Marlborough being captured for the king in 1642, while in 1643 the forces of the Earl of Essex were routed by Charles I and Prince Rupert at the Battle of Aldbourne Chase. In the same year Sir William Waller, after failing to capture Devizes, was defeated in the Battle of Roundway Down nearby.

In 1645, the Clubmen of Dorset and Wiltshire, whose sole object was peace, systematically punished any member of either party discovered in acts of plunder. Devizes, the last stronghold of the Royalists, was captured by Oliver Cromwell in 1645. In 1655, a rising organised on behalf of the exiled Charles II at Salisbury was dispersed in the same year.

==The Glorious Revolution==
At the time of the Glorious Revolution, King James II gathered his main forces, altogether about 19,000 men, at Salisbury, James himself arriving there on 19 November 1688. His troops were not keen to fight William and Mary, and the loyalty of many was in doubt. The first blood was shed at the Wincanton Skirmish in Somerset. In Salisbury, James heard that some of his officers, such as Edward Hyde, had deserted, and he broke out in a nose-bleed which he took as a bad omen. His commander in chief, the Earl of Feversham, advised retreat on 23 November, and the next day John Churchill deserted to William. On 26 November, James&#x27;s daughter Princess Anne did the same, and James returned to London the same day, never again to be at the head of a serious military force in England.

==Employment, manufacturing and industry==

At the time of the Domesday Survey the industrial pursuits of Wiltshire were almost exclusively agricultural; 390 mills are mentioned, and vineyards at Tollard Royal and Lacock. In the succeeding centuries sheep farming was vigorously pursued, and the Cistercian monastery of both Kingswood and Stanley exported wool to the Florentine and Flemish markets in the 13th century and 14th century. Wiltshire at this time was already reckoned among the chief of the clothing counties, the principal centres of the industry being Bradford-upon-Avon, Malmesbury, Trowbridge, Devizes and Chippenham.

In the 16th century Devizes was noted for its blankets, Warminster had a famous corn-market, and cheese was extensively made in north Wiltshire. Amesbury was famous for its tobacco pipe manufacture in the 16th century. The clothing trade went through a period of great depression in the 17th century, partly owing to the constant outbreaks of plague. Linen, cotton, gloves and cutlery were also manufactured in the county, silk at Malmesbury and carpets at Wilton.

The Swindon Works of the Great Western Railway (1841–1986) was one of the largest covered areas in the world, and its remains are amongst the most significant of Victorian engineering works in the world. Together with the housing and amenities provided by the company and its workforce, it has been proposed to UNESCO as the centre of a World Heritage Site. Swindon has also been significant in other manufacturing, such as the car industry: see History of Swindon.

==Parliamentary representation==
In 1295 Wiltshire was represented by twenty-eight members in parliament: the shire returning two knights, and the boroughs of Bedwyn, Bradford, Calne, Chippenham, Cricklade, Devizes, Downton, Ludgershall, Malmesbury, Marlborough, Old Sarum, Salisbury and Wilton, two burgesses each, but the boroughs for the most part made irregular returns. Hindon, Heytesbury and Wootton Bassett were enfranchised in the 15th century, and at the time of the Reform Act 1832 the county with sixteen boroughs returned a total of thirty-four members. Under the latter act Great Bedwyn, Downton, Heytesbury, Hindon, Ludgershall, Old Sarum and Wootton Bassett were disfranchised, and Calne, Malmesbury, Westbury and Wilton lost one member each. Under the act of 1868 the county returned two members in two divisions, and Chippenham, Devizes and Marlborough lost one member each. Under the act of 1885 the county returned five members in five divisions; Cricklade, Calne, Chippenham, Devizes, Malmesbury, Marlborough, Westbury and Wilton were disfranchised; and Salisbury lost one member.

==Archaeology==

===Prehistoric remains and monuments===
Wiltshire is rich in prehistoric antiquities. The Stone Age is represented by a number of flint and stone implements, preserved in the unsurpassed collection at Salisbury Museum. Stonehenge, with its circles of giant stones, and Avebury, with its avenues of monoliths leading to what was once a stone circle, surrounded by an earthwork and enclosing two lesser circles, are the largest and best known megalithic works in England.

A valley near Avebury is filled with immense sarsen blocks, resembling a &#x27;river of stone&#x27;, and perhaps laid there by prehistoric architects. There are also menhirs, dolmens and cromlechs. Surrounded as they were by forests and marshy hollows, it is clear that the downs were densely peopled at a very early period. Circles, formed by a ditch within a bank, are common, as are grave-mounds or barrows. These have been classified according to their shape as bell barrows, bowl barrows and long barrows. Bones, ash, tools, weapons and ornaments have been dug up from such mounds, many of which contain kistvaens or chambers of stone. The lynchets or terraces which score some of the hillsides are said to be the work of primitive early farmers and agriculturists.

Ancient strongholds are scattered over the county. Among the most remarkable are Vespasian&#x27;s Camp, near Amesbury; Silbury Hill, the largest artificial mound in Europe, near Avebury; the mounds of Marlborough and Old Sarum; the &quot;camps&quot; of Battlesbury and Scratchbury, near Warminster; Yarnbury, to the north of Wylye, in good preservation; Casterley, on a ridgeway near Devizes; White Sheet hill; Chisbury, near Savernake; Sidbury, near Ludgershall; and Figsbury Ring, northeast of Salisbury. Ogbury, ten kilometres (6 mi) north of Salisbury, is an undoubted British enclosure. Durrington Walls, north of Amesbury, are probably the remains of a British village, and there are vestiges of others on Salisbury Plain and the Marlborough Downs.

===Roman remains===
There are many signs of Roman rule. Wansdyke or Wodens Dyke, one of the largest extant entrenchments, runs west for about from a point east of Savernake, nearly as far as the Bristol Channel, and is almost unaltered for several kilometres along the Marlborough Downs. Its date is uncertain; but the work has been proved, wherever excavated, to be Roman or Romano-British. It consists of a bank, with a trench on the north side, and was clearly meant for defence, not as a boundary. Forts strengthened it at intervals. Bokerley Dyke, which forms a part of the boundary between Wiltshire and Dorset, is the largest among several similar entrenchments, and has also a ditch north of the rampart.

=== Recent excavations ===
In April 2022, metal detectorists announced the discovery of two 4000 year-old Bronze Age axe heads on land owned by a farmer. The remains are being stored in Bristol Museum.

==Architecture==

===Ecclesiastical buildings===

====Monastic houses====
Chief among the few monastic buildings of which any vestiges remain are the ruined abbeys of Malmesbury (still in use as the parish church) and of Lacock. Amesbury&#x27;s Church of St Mary and St Melor may have been linked to the 10th-century Amesbury Priory or its 12th-century successor, Amesbury Abbey. Monkton Farleigh had its Cluniac priory, founded as a cell of Lewes in the 13th century, and represented by some outbuildings of the manor house. A college for a dean and 12 prebendaries, afterwards a monastery of Bonhommes, was founded in 1347 at Edington; the church, Decorated and Perpendicular, resembles a cathedral in size and stately beauty and is now the parish church. The 14th-century buildings of Bradenstoke Priory or Clack Abbey, founded near Chippenham for Augustinian canons, were incorporated in a farmhouse.

====Notable churches====
The finest churches of Wiltshire, generally Perpendicular in style, were built in the districts where good stone could be obtained, while the architecture is simpler in the chalk region where flint was used. Small wooden steeples and pyramidal bell-turrets are not uncommon; and the churches of Purton, five kilometres (3 1/8 mi) northwest of Swindon, and Wanborough, five kilometres (3 mi) southeast, are unusual in having a central steeple as well as a west tower.

St. Lawrence&#x27;s church at Bradford on Avon is one of the most complete Saxon ecclesiastical buildings in England; and elsewhere there are fragments of Saxon work imbedded in later masonry. Examples are three arches in the nave of Britford church, within a mile of Salisbury; the east end of the chancel at Burcombe, near Wilton; and parts of the churches at Avebury, Bremhill, and Manningford Bruce. St John&#x27;s at Devizes retains its original Norman tower and has Norman masonry in its chancel; while the chancel of St Mary in the same town, is also Norman, and the porch has characteristic Norman stone mouldings. The churches of Preshute, Ditteridge and Netheravon also preserve some Norman features.
Early English architecture is illustrated by Salisbury Cathedral, its purest and most beautiful example; and, on a smaller scale, at Amesbury, Bishops Cannings, Boyton, Collingbourne Kingston, Downton and Potterne.

Bishopstone has the finest Decorated church in the county, with a curious external cloister and unique south chancel doorway, recessed beneath a stone canopy. Mere, close to the borders of Dorset and Somerset, is interesting not only for its Perpendicular church, but also for a medieval chantry, used as a schoolhouse by William Barnes, the Dorset poet.

=== Secular architecture ===

====Castles====
The castles of Wiltshire have been almost entirely swept away. At Old Sarum, Marlborough and Devizes only a few vestiges are left in remnant walls and vaults. Castle Combe and Trowbridge castles have long been demolished, and of Ludgershall castle only a small fragment survives. The ruins of Wardour castle, standing in a richly wooded park near Tisbury, date from the 14th century, and consist of a hexagonal outer wall of great height, enclosing an open court; two towers overlook the entrance.

====Manor houses====

The number of mansions, old country houses and stately homes is a marked feature in Wiltshire. Few parishes, especially in the north west of the county, are without their old manor house, usually converted into a farm, but preserving its flagged floor, stone-mullioned windows, gabled front, sometimes two-storeyed porch and oak-panelled interior. Place House in Tisbury, and Barton Farm, at Bradford-upon-Avon, date from the 14th century. The best examples of 15th-century work are the manor houses of Norrington, in the vale of Chalk; Teffont Evias, in the vale of the River Nadder; Potterne; and Great Chalfield, near Monkton Farleigh. At South Wraxall the hall of a beautiful house of the same period is celebrated in local tradition as the spot where tobacco was first smoked in England by Sir Walter Raleigh and his host, Sir Walter Long.

Later styles are represented by Longford Castle, near Salisbury, where the picture galleries are of great interest; Heytesbury House; Wilton House at Wilton, Kingston House at Bradford-upon-Avon, Bowood House near Calne, Longleat near Warminster, Corsham Court at Corsham, Littlecote near Ramsbury, Charlton Park House near Malmesbury, Compton Chamberlayne in the Nadder valley, Grittleton House and the modern Castle Combe, both near Chippenham, and Stourhead, on the borders of Dorset and Somerset. Each of these is noteworthy for its architecture, its art treasures, the care lavished upon it or the beauty of its surroundings.

<text>Cormac Michael Breslin (25 April 1902 – 23 January 1978) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann from 1967 to 1973. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1937 to 1977.

He was born in Bunbeg, Gweedore, County Donegal. He was educated at St Eunan&#x27;s College, Letterkenny and, while Leas-Cheann Comhairle, attended the Golden Jubilee there in September 1956.

He was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil Teachta Dála (TD) for the Donegal West constituency at the 1937 general election. He was re-elected at every election until his retirement in 1977, switching constituency to Donegal South-West in 1961 and to Donegal–Leitrim in 1969. He served as Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann from 1967 to 1973, and as Leas-Cheann Comhairle from 1951 to 1967. He is credited for helping found the industrial estate in Gweedore, and also the turf burning station—a source of employment in his local parish, which allowed local people to cut the turbary and sell it to the station operated by the Electrical Supply Board (ESB), situated in Min a Cuing. 

In November 1931 he married Antoinette Wilman, and they had ten children.

<text>Ladd&#x27;s Addition is an inner southeast historic district of Portland, Oregon, United States. It is Portland&#x27;s oldest planned residential development, and one of the oldest in the western United States. The district is known in Portland for a diagonal street pattern, which is at odds with the rectilinear grid of the surrounding area. Roughly eight blocks (east-west) by ten blocks (north-south) in size (by reference to the surrounding grid), Ladd&#x27;s is bordered by SE Hawthorne, Division, 12th, and 20th streets. It is part of the Hosford-Abernethy neighborhood association.

==History==
Ladd&#x27;s Addition is named after William S. Ladd, a merchant and mid-19th-century Portland mayor who owned a farm on the land. In 1891 (when the city of East Portland was merged into Portland) Ladd subdivided the land for residential use. Rather than follow the standard orthogonal grid of the surrounding area, Ladd created a diagonal &quot;wagon wheel&quot; arrangement, including four small diamond-shaped rose gardens and a central traffic circle surrounding a park. It is also one of fewer than 20 areas in Portland that have alleyways, with street elevations mostly uninterrupted by curb cuts. While it is said that Ladd&#x27;s design was inspired by L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s Washington layout, it bears no actual resemblance to the Washington street plan.

The homes in the district, mostly developed between 1905 and 1930 (after Ladd&#x27;s death), have been called a &quot;architecturally rich mix of compatible early 20th century styles,&quot; notable for their &quot;continuity of scale, setback, orientation, and materials.&quot; Architectural styles represented include bungalow, craftsman, American Foursquare, Mission, Tudor, and Colonial Revival.

Development started at the north end, closest to the streetcar transportation, with the largest homes built between 1905 and 1915.

Though the earliest deeds excluded Japanese and Chinese residents, except as servants, after those covenants expired, Ladd&#x27;s Addition was one of the few areas by 1939 informally designated as open to &#x27;oriental&#x27; families.

==Ecology==
The narrow streets of Ladd&#x27;s Addition are lined with American Elm trees. The Save Our Elms organization inoculates the elm trees yearly against Dutch elm disease. Each of the four smaller, diamond-shaped &quot;circles&quot; to the east, west, north, and south contains one of Portland&#x27;s rose test gardens. Friends of Ladd&#x27;s Addition Gardens regularly solicits money and volunteers to maintain the rose gardens. Ladd named most of the streets after trees, but he named SE Ladd Avenue and SE Elliott Avenue for himself and his wife, who was born Caroline Elliott.

==Historic preservation==
The area was designated a historic district by the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

<doc id="1291228" wikidata="Q3711766" url="?curid=1291228" title="ICL Distributed Array Processor">
<text>The Distributed Array Processor (DAP) produced by
International Computers Limited (ICL) was the world&#x27;s first commercial
massively parallel computer. The original paper study was
complete in 1972 and building of the prototype began in 1974.
The first machine was delivered to
Queen Mary College in 1979.

==Development==
The initial Pilot DAP was designed and implemented by Dr Stewart F Reddaway with the aid of David J Hunt and Peter M Flanders at the ICL Stevenage Labs. Their manager and a major contributor was John K Iliffe, designer of the Basic Language Machine and known for Iliffe vectors. The pilot implementation had a 32×32 processing element arrangement.

The ICL DAP had 64×64 single bit processing elements (PEs) with 4096 bits of storage per PE. It was attached to an ICL mainframe and its memory was mapped into the mainframe&#x27;s memory. Programs for the DAP were written in DAP FORTRAN which was FORTRAN extended with 64×64 matrix and 64 element vector primitives. DAP Fortran compiled to an assembly language called APAL (Array Processor Assembly Language). The DAP had a single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) architecture. Each operation could be performed under the control of a mask which controlled which elements were affected. Array programs were executed as subroutines of normal mainframe FORTRAN programs and IO was handled by the mainframe.

Operationally, there was an overhead to transfer computational data into and out of the array, and problems which did not fit the 64×64 matrix imposed additional complexity to handle the boundaries (65×65 was perhaps the worst case!)—but for problems which suited the architecture, it could outperform the current Cray pipeline architectures by two orders of magnitude. The ICL 2980 was not a popular machine and this held back the use of the DAP as an attached processor was restricted initially to this one range.

The design as described in Reddaway&#x27;s 1973 paper is pretty much that which was implemented in the first commercial version except the facility to supply address bits from the processing elements was removed. This change greatly simplified hardware error detection. A notable extra facility was carry propagation to simplify vector mode addition.

==After ICL==
The DAP [IP] was sold off to a venture capital-funded start-up company Active Memory Technology
(AMT) which was then taken over by Cambridge Parallel Processors (CPP).
It was enhanced and made smaller and faster as the Gamma series.
An 8-bit processor with some local 8-bit wide memory was added to the
processor and fast IO capabilities were implemented. It could be programmed in either C++ or Fortran-Plus. These were more flexible than DAP FORTRAN, in particular they automatically took care of choosing a mapping from user specified matrix and vector bounds to the underlying hardware.

Sample DAPs are in storage at the Computer History Museum.

CPP ceased trading in 2004.

==Mini-DAP and Mil-DAP==

A smaller 32x32 version was created between 1984 and 1987. The commercial version was called the Mini-DAP, normally attached to a PERQ system (so was sometimes called the PERQ-DAP), and the ruggedised military version was called the Mil-DAP.

<doc id="1291286" wikidata="Q1933398" url="?curid=1291286" title="Alpha privative">
<text>An alpha [[privative]] or, rarely, privative a (from Latin &quot;&quot;, from Ancient Greek ) is the prefix &quot;a-&quot; or &quot;an-&quot; (before vowels) that is used in Indo-European languages such as Sanskrit and Greek and in words borrowed therefrom to express negation or absence, for example the English words of Greek origin &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

It is derived from a Proto-Indo-European syllabic nasal *&#x27;, the zero [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]] grade of the negation *&#x27;, i.e. /n/ used as a vowel. For this reason, it usually appears as &#x27; before vowels (e.g. &quot;[[illiteracy|an-alphabetism]]&quot;, &quot;[[anesthesia|an-esthesia]]&quot;, &quot;[[anarchy (word)|an-archy]]&quot;). It shares the same root with the Greek prefix&#x27; or &#x27;, in Greek or , that is also privative (e.g.&#x27;).

It is not to be confused with, among other things, an alpha copulative (e.g. &quot;&quot;) or the prefix &#x27; (i.e. the preposition&#x27; with or elision of its final vowel before a following vowel; e.g. &quot;&quot;).

==Cognates==

===Sanskrit===
The same prefix appears in Sanskrit, also as अ- &#x27; before consonants; and अन्- &#x27; before vowels.

===Latin===
In Latin, the cognate prefix is &#x27;, which leaves its traces in English words like &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. The prepositional prefix &#x27; is unrelated.

===Germanic languages===
In English and other West Germanic languages, the cognate is &quot;un-&quot; (or &quot;on-&quot;).

In North Germanic languages, the -&quot;n&quot;- has disappeared and Old Norse has &#x27; (e.g. ), Danish and Norwegian have &#x27;, whereas Swedish uses &#x27; (pronounced [u]), and Icelandic and Faroese use the related &#x27;.
==Homonym==
The prefix &#x27; (also - &#x27; from psilosis), copulative a, is nearly homonymous with privative &quot;, but originates from Proto-Indo-European *.

<text>René Albert Dreyfus (6 May 1905 – 16 August 1993) was a French racing driver active during the 1930s and 1940s.

== Early life ==

Dreyfus was born and raised in Nice to a Jewish family. He showed an early interest in automobiles, learning to drive before the age of nine. The middle of three children, his brother Maurice served as his business partner in his youth, and his manager in his racing career.

== Career ==

=== Driving career ===

Driving Maseratis, Ferraris, Delahayes, and Bugattis against some of the greatest drivers of all time, Dreyfus won 36 races across Europe, including Monaco, Florence, Rheims, Belgium, Cork, Dieppe, Pau, and at Tripoli in North Africa, becoming a French national hero.

He acquired a Bugatti and joined the Moto Club de Nice for younger competitive automotive enthusiasts. In 1924 he won his class in the first amateur race he entered, being the only entrant in the class, and went on to win three consecutive French Riviera championships in the next five years. In 1929 he entered his first professional race, the inaugural Grand Prix of Monaco, finishing first in his class and fifth overall.

The following year he won the race outright in a Bugatti, beating by 22 seconds the highly regarded Bugatti factory team, led by William Grover-Williams, winner of the previous year, and Louis Chiron. Realizing that factory cars were always faster than the cars owned by private entrants, Dreyfus reasoned that his only chance of winning lay in avoiding refueling stops, so he had additional fuel tanks added to his car with the intent of running the race without stop. This was not common practice at the time, since it was felt that fatigue would make it impossible, but Dreyfus&#x27; strategy proved correct.

The next few years saw Grand Prix racing become a metaphor for war, as the Nazi government of Germany chose this arena to prove their inherent superiority, nationalized the Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union racing teams, gave them seemingly unlimited money and ran them like a military campaign. This led to a remarkable era of competition. While many of the best European drivers of the era, for instance Chiron, were hired by the German teams and jumped at the chance to drive the most advanced cars available, as a Jew this option was not available to Dreyfus. Instead he, like the few other underdogs competing against the German teams, had to defend his nation&#x27;s pride by dint of heroic skill and daring in inferior machinery. Although France had been the birthplace of automobile racing, it now was a distant third in the racing hierarchy, behind the all-consuming German onslaught and the perennially victorious Italians.

Escaping Nazi-occupied France, Dreyfus traveled to the United States to compete in the 1940 Indianapolis 500 alongside fellow Frenchman René Le Bègue. Driving a pair of Maseratis for the American/French owner Lucy O&#x27;Reilly Schell, Le Bègue qualified 31st, but Dreyfus was bumped and ended up as the second alternate. On race day, it was decided for the two drivers to split time in the car, and each drove two stints of approximately 50 laps (125 miles) apiece. Le Bègue started the race and ran approximately laps 1–50 and laps 101–150. Dreyfus piloted the car for laps 51–100 and from 151 to the finish. The pair brought the car home in 10th place, flagged 8 laps down. A rainstorm prompted officials to flag the race after only the first three finishers received the checkered flag.

==== Later life ====

Dreyfus continued to race sporadically, including the 1952 24 Hours of Le Mans. His last race was the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1955, when Stanley &quot;Wacky&quot; Arnolt asked Dreyfus to captain the Arnolt-Bristol Racing Team. Dreyfus led the team to the Sebring Team Trophy and 1–2–3 in class. In 1980 he was invited back to the Monaco Grand Prix to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his victory. At age 75, he personally drove throughout Europe touring all the sites of his racing career, receiving public celebration and honors at each stop. At the banquet following the race, he was brought to the stage to sit once again in the Bugatti in which he had won, half a century earlier. He was also Grand Marshal of the 1980 United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen.

=== Government service ===

In an effort to induce manufacturers to develop new cars which would be competitive with the Germans, in 1937 the French government announced the &#x27;Prix du Million&#x27;, or the Million Franc Race. The prize money was a million francs, and in order to ensure that the competition tested each car&#x27;s ultimate limits rather than just the driver&#x27;s skill in passing other drivers, the race was a time trial against the clock at the treacherous Autodrome de Montlhéry track, which had taken the life of the great Antonio Ascari. Driving a Delahaye 145 for the Écurie Bleue team of Lucy O&#x27;Reilly Schell in testing and in the competition itself, Dreyfus risked death with a literally blistering pace, wearing the special Dunlop tires down to the fabric but handily overwhelming all competitors except the Bugatti team. On the last day of the competition he again went out on the track versus the Bugatti and again set an incredible pace, until he forced the Bugatti to the breaking point, winning the prize for Delahaye. In 1938 Dreyfus drove a Delahaye at Pau, a tight circuit running through village streets, beating the legendary Rudolf Caracciola and his Mercedes-Benz Silver Arrow, and becoming a national hero in France.

When World War II broke out, Dreyfus joined the French Army, where he served as a truck driver. In 1940, however, he was abruptly sent by the French government to the United States to represent France by driving a Maserati in the Indianapolis 500. Although the previous year&#x27;s race had been won by a Maserati driven by American Wilbur Shaw, neither Dreyfus nor his team partner René Le Bègue was familiar with the mechanical requirements and the very different rules of racing at Indianapolis; this problem was exacerbated by both drivers not knowing English, and by the American racing community&#x27;s reluctance to see a European win the &quot;Great American Race.&quot; Despite suffering numerous substantial setbacks and penalties for not understanding the details of the rules, beginning with their attempts to qualify their two cars, Dreyfus and Le Bègue succeeded in co-driving the one car which they did qualify from the back of the grid to tenth place. Shaw again won the race in another Maserati.

In the meantime, the Germans had overrun Paris, and as a Jew who had famously humiliated the German racing effort, Dreyfus was advised by the French government not to return to occupied France. Instead he settled in New York City, where he opened a French restaurant, &quot;&quot;Le Gourmet&quot;.&quot; Upon the United States entering the war, in 1942 Dreyfus enlisted in the United States Army and served in Europe as an interrogator in the Italian Campaign. After the war, in 1945 he became an American citizen and brought his brother Maurice back to New York, where they opened another French restaurant, &quot;&quot;Le Chanteclair&quot;.&quot; This soon became the semi-official New York meeting spot for the world&#x27;s automobile racing community, the rivalries of the past having been overcome by the spirit of fraternity. It continues today as the Madison Avenue Sports Car Driving and Chowder Society, officially founded in March 1957 and which meets monthly at Sardi&#x27;s in NYC.

<text>Walter Friedrich Wislicenus (November 5, 1859 – October 3, 1905) was a German astronomer. He taught at the University of Strasbourg starting in 1888, and was a professor from 1897 until his death. He was known for his lectures given outside of academia that attracted many non-scientists, and for his publications for the interested public.

==Biography==
He was born in Halberstadt as the son of a preacher, and the nephew of Gustav Adolf Wislicenus, founder of the &quot;free religious movement&quot; in Germany.

After only one year of studies in Leipzig he decided to move to Strasbourg in 1880, where a new observatory was close to completion. In 1882 he joined an expedition to observe the transit of Venus at Bahía Blanca as an assistant. In 1883 he started to work for the Strasbourg Observatory. He was the main observer for the catalogue of southern stars, created from 1884 to 1888. He received his Ph.D in 1886 publishing works on the rotational period of Mars.
A crater on Mars and the asteroid 4588 Wislicenus are named in his honor.

<doc id="1291319" wikidata="Q186090" url="?curid=1291319" title="Time-invariant system">
<text>In control theory, a time-invariant (TI) system has a time-dependent system function that is not a direct function of time. Such systems are regarded as a class of systems in the field of system analysis. The time-dependent system function is a function of the time-dependent input function. If this function depends &quot;only&quot; indirectly on the time-domain (via the input function, for example), then that is a system that would be considered time-invariant. Conversely, any direct dependence on the time-domain of the system function could be considered as a &quot;time-varying system&quot;.

Mathematically speaking, &quot;time-invariance&quot; of a system is the following property:

:&quot;Given a system with a time-dependent output function , and a time-dependent input function , the system will be considered time-invariant if a time-delay on the input directly equates to a time-delay of the output function. For example, if time is &quot;elapsed time&quot;, then &quot;time-invariance&quot; implies that the relationship between the input function and the output function is constant with respect to time &quot;
::formula_1 

In the language of signal processing, this property can be satisfied if the transfer function of the system is not a direct function of time except as expressed by the input and output.

In the context of a system schematic, this property can also be stated as follows, as shown in the figure to the right:

:&quot;If a system is time-invariant then the system block commutes with an arbitrary delay.&quot;
If a time-invariant system is also linear, it is the subject of linear time-invariant theory (linear time-invariant) with direct applications in NMR spectroscopy, seismology, circuits, signal processing, control theory, and other technical areas. Nonlinear time-invariant systems lack a comprehensive, governing theory. Discrete time-invariant systems are known as shift-invariant systems. Systems which lack the time-invariant property are studied as time-variant systems.

== Simple example ==

To demonstrate how to determine if a system is time-invariant, consider the two systems:

* System A: formula_2
* System B: formula_3

Since the System Function formula_4 for system A explicitly depends on &quot;t&quot; outside of formula_5, it is not time-invariant because the time-dependence is not explicitly a function of the input function.

In contrast, system B&#x27;s time-dependence is only a function of the time-varying input formula_5. This makes system B time-invariant.

The Formal Example below shows in more detail that while System B is a Shift-Invariant System as a function of time, &quot;t&quot;, System A is not.

== Formal example ==
A more formal proof of why systems A and B above differ is now presented. To perform this proof, the second definition will be used.

:System A: Start with a delay of the input formula_7
::formula_2
::formula_9
:Now delay the output by formula_10
::formula_2
::formula_12
:Clearly formula_13, therefore the system is not time-invariant.

:System B: Start with a delay of the input formula_7
::formula_3
::formula_16
:Now delay the output by formula_10
::formula_3
::formula_19
:Clearly formula_20, therefore the system is time-invariant.

More generally, the relationship between the input and output is 

:formula_21

and its variation with time is

:formula_22

For time-invariant systems, the system properties remain constant with time, 

:formula_23 

Applied to Systems A and B above:

:formula_24 in general, so it is not time-invariant,
:formula_25 so it is time-invariant.

== Abstract example ==

We can denote the shift operator by formula_26 where formula_27 is the amount by which a vector&#x27;s index set should be shifted. For example, the &quot;advance-by-1&quot; system

:formula_28

can be represented in this abstract notation by

:formula_29

where formula_30 is a function given by

:formula_31

with the system yielding the shifted output

:formula_32

So formula_33 is an operator that advances the input vector by 1.

Suppose we represent a system by an operator formula_34. This system is time-invariant if it commutes with the shift operator, i.e.,

:formula_35

If our system equation is given by

:formula_36

then it is time-invariant if we can apply the system operator formula_34 on formula_30 followed by the shift operator formula_26, or we can apply the shift operator formula_26 followed by the system operator formula_34, with the two computations yielding equivalent results.

Applying the system operator first gives

:formula_42

Applying the shift operator first gives

:formula_43

If the system is time-invariant, then

:formula_44

<doc id="1291329" wikidata="Q132810" url="?curid=1291329" title="Hyphessobrycon">
<text>Hyphessobrycon is a genus of freshwater fish in the family Characidae. These species are among the fishes known as tetras. The genus is distributed in the Neotropical realm from southern Mexico to Río de la Plata in Argentina. Many of these species are native to South America; about six species are from Central America and a single species, &quot;H. compressus&quot; is from southern Mexico.

All small fishes, the &quot;Hyphessobrycon&quot; tetras reach maximum overall lengths of about . Great anatomical diversity exists in this genus. They are generally of typical characin shape, but vary greatly in coloration and body form, many species having distinctive black, red, or yellow markings on their bodies and fins. These species are generally omnivorous, feeding predominantly on small crustaceans, insects, annelid worms, and zooplankton. When spawning, they scatter their eggs and guard neither eggs nor young.

==Taxonomy==
This large genus of characins includes over 150 species. The systematics of &quot;Hyphessobrycon&quot; are still largely unresolved. Six groups within this genus have been recognized based on color patterns alone. With no phylogenetic analysis of this genus, species are placed into this genus as anatomically defined by Carl H. Eigenmann in 1917. By this definition, &quot;Hyphessobrycon&quot; is identified by the presence of an adipose fin, incomplete lateral line, two tooth series in the premaxilla, with the teeth of the external series continuous in a single series, teeth not strictly conical, preventral scales arranged in more than one row and lack of scales in the caudal fin. The characteristic of extension of scales onto the caudal fin that differentiates this genus from &quot;Hemigrammus&quot; is not satisfactory, as it occurs in intermediate conditions.

This genus is not monophyletic. A monophyletic group within &quot;Hyphessobrycon&quot; has been hypothesized, termed the rosy tetra clade; this group is based upon coloration pattern and the shape of dorsal and anal fins of males. Recognition of monophyletic groups among &quot;Hyphessobrycon&quot; species is complicated by the difficulty in finding characters useful for hypothesis of relationships among the species. Traditional characters used to identify &quot;Hyphessobrycon&quot; are phylogenetically unreliable.

==Etymology==
The generic name, &quot;Hyphessobrycon&quot;, is of slightly uncertain origin. The second part derives from the Greek βρύκω (to bite); the first, derives from an ostensible Greek &quot;hyphesson&quot;, which may be an error for υπελάσσων (slightly smaller).

==Relationship to humans==
Most of the species in the genus have not been rated by the IUCN Red List as Threatened, but many species have small distributions and at least three, &quot;H. flammeus&quot;, &quot;H. coelestinus&quot; and &quot;H. duragenys&quot; are classified as endangered. One, &quot;H. taurocephalus&quot;, is categorised as possibly extinct. This species only occurs in a few rivers and streams in Santa Catarina and Paraná states of Brazil.

Many &quot;Hyphessobrycon&quot; species are popular aquarium fish, and some, including &quot;H. flammeus&quot;, are bred in large numbers in captivity.

==Species==
The 156 currently recognized species in this genus are:

<doc id="1291335" wikidata="Q809934" url="?curid=1291335" title="Basel II">
<text>Basel II is the second of the Basel Accords, which are recommendations on banking laws and regulations issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. It is now extended and partially superseded by Basel III.

The Basel II Accord was published in June 2004. It was a new framework for international banking standards, superseding the Basel I framework, to determine the minimum capital that banks should hold to guard against the financial and operational risks. The regulations aimed to ensure that the more significant the risk a bank is exposed to, the greater the amount of capital the bank needs to hold to safeguard its solvency and overall economic stability. Basel II attempted to accomplish this by establishing risk and capital management requirements to ensure that a bank has adequate capital for the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending, investment and trading activities. One focus was to maintain sufficient consistency of regulations so to limit competitive inequality amongst internationally active banks.

Basel II was implemented in 2008 in most major economies. The financial crisis of 2007–2008 intervened before Basel II could become fully effective. As Basel III was negotiated, the crisis was top of mind and accordingly more stringent standards were contemplated and quickly adopted in some key countries including in Europe and the US.

==Objective==
The final version aims at:
# Ensuring that capital allocation is more risk-sensitive;
# Enhancing disclosure requirements which would allow market participants to assess the capital adequacy of an institution;
# Ensuring that credit risk, operational risk and market risk are quantified based on data and formal techniques;
# Attempting to align economic and regulatory capital more closely to reduce the scope for regulatory arbitrage.

While the final accord has at large addressed the regulatory arbitrage issue, there are still areas where regulatory capital requirements will diverge from the economic capital.

== The accord in operation: Three pillars ==

Basel II uses a &quot;three pillars&quot; concept – (1) minimum capital requirements (addressing risk), (2) supervisory review and (3) market discipline.

The Basel I accord dealt with only parts of each of these pillars. For example: concerning the first Basel II pillar, only one risk, credit risk, was dealt with easily while the market risk was an afterthought; operational risk was not dealt with at all.

=== The first pillar: Minimum capital requirements ===

The first pillar deals with maintenance of regulatory capital calculated for three major components of risk that a bank faces: credit risk, operational risk, and market risk. Other risks are not considered fully quantifiable at this stage.

# The credit risk component can be calculated in three different ways of varying degree of sophistication, namely standardized approach, Foundation IRB, Advanced IRB. IRB stands for &quot;Internal Rating-Based Approach&quot;. 
# For operational risk, there are three different approaches – basic indicator approach or BIA, standardized approach or TSA, and the internal measurement approach (an advanced form of which is the advanced measurement approach or AMA).
# For market risk the preferred approach is VaR (value at risk).

As the Basel II recommendations are phased in by the banking industry it will move from standardised requirements to more refined and specific requirements that have been developed for each risk category by each bank. The upside for banks that do develop their bespoke risk measurement systems is that they will be rewarded with potentially lower risk capital requirements. In the future, there will be closer links between the concepts of economic and regulatory capital.

=== The second pillar: Supervisory review process ===

This is a regulatory response to the first pillar, giving regulators better &#x27;tools&#x27; over those previously available. It also provides a framework for dealing with systemic risk, pension risk, concentration risk, strategic risk, reputational risk, liquidity risk and legal risk, which the accord combines under the title of residual risk. Banks can review their risk management system.

The Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) is a result of Pillar 2 of Basel II accords.

=== The third pillar: Market discipline===

This pillar aims to complement the minimum capital requirements and supervisory review process by developing a set of disclosure requirements which will allow the market participants to gauge the capital adequacy of an institution.

Market discipline supplements regulation as sharing of information facilitates the assessment of the bank by others, including investors, analysts, customers, other banks, and rating agencies, which leads to good corporate governance. The aim of Pillar 3 is to allow market discipline to operate by requiring institutions to disclose details on the scope of application, capital, risk exposures, risk assessment processes, and the capital adequacy of the institution. It must be consistent with how the senior management, including the board, assess and manage the risks of the institution.

When market participants have a sufficient understanding of a bank&#x27;s activities and the controls it has in place to manage its exposures, they are better able to distinguish between banking organizations so that they can reward those that manage their risks prudently and penalize those that do not.

These disclosures are required to be made at least twice a year, except qualitative disclosures providing a summary of the general risk management objectives and policies which can be made annually. Institutions are also required to create a formal policy on what will be disclosed and controls around them along with the validation and frequency of these disclosures. In general, the disclosures under Pillar 3 apply to the top consolidated level of the banking group to which the Basel II framework applies.

==Chronological updates==

=== September 2005 update ===
On September 30, 2005, the four US Federal banking agencies (the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision) announced their revised plans for the U.S. implementation of the Basel II accord. This delays implementation of the accord for US banks by 12 months.

=== November 2005 update ===
On November 15, 2005, the committee released a revised version of the Accord, incorporating changes to the calculations for market risk and the treatment of double default effects. These changes had been flagged well in advance, as part of a paper released in July 2005.

=== July 2006 update ===
On July 4, 2006, the committee released a comprehensive version of the Accord, incorporating the June 2004 Basel II Framework, the elements of the 1988 Accord that were not revised during the Basel II process, the 1996 Amendment to the Capital Accord to Incorporate Market Risks, and the November 2005 paper on Basel II: International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A Revised Framework. No new elements have been introduced in this compilation. This version is now the current version.

=== November 2007 update ===
On November 1, 2007, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (U.S. Department of the Treasury) approved a final rule implementing the advanced approaches of the Basel II Capital Accord. This rule establishes regulatory and supervisory expectations for credit risk, through the Internal Ratings Based Approach (IRB), and operational risk, through the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA), and articulates enhanced standards for the supervisory review of capital adequacy and public disclosures for the largest U.S. banks.

=== July 2008 update ===
On July 16, 2008 the federal banking and thrift agencies (the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision) issued a final guidance outlining the supervisory review process for the banking institutions that are implementing the new advanced capital adequacy framework (known as Basel II). The final guidance, relating to the supervisory review, is aimed at helping banking institutions meet certain qualification requirements in the advanced approaches rule, which took effect on April 1, 2008.

===Basel 2.5===
A series of proposals to enhance the Basel II framework was announced by the Basel Committee in January 2009. The proposals included: revisions to the Basel II market risk framework; the guidelines for computing capital for incremental risk in the trading book; and proposed enhancements to the Basel II framework.

A final package of measures, known as Basel 2.5, enhanced the three pillars of the Basel II framework and strengthened the 1996 rules governing trading book capital was issued in July 2009 by the newly expanded Basel Committee. These measures included revisions to the Basel II market-risk framework and the guidelines for computing capital for incremental risk in the trading book. In addition, capital requirements for trading book securitisation exposures were aligned with those in the banking book. A further consultation was launched in December 2009 which resulted in further updates in 2010.

==Implementation==

=== International consistency ===
One of the most difficult aspects of implementing an international agreement is the need to accommodate differing cultures, varying structural models, complexities of public policy, and existing regulation. Banks&#x27; senior management will determine corporate strategy, as well as the country in which to base a particular type of business, based in part on how Basel II is ultimately interpreted by various countries&#x27; legislatures and regulators.

To assist banks operating with multiple reporting requirements for different regulators according to geographic location, there are several software applications available. These include capital calculation engines and extend to automated reporting solutions which include the reports required under COREP/FINREP.

For example, U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chair Sheila Bair explained in June 2007 the purpose of capital adequacy requirements for banks, such as the accord:

: There are strong reasons for believing that banks left to their own devices would maintain less capital—not more—than would be prudent. The fact is, banks do benefit from implicit and explicit government safety nets. Investing in a bank is perceived as a safe bet. Without proper capital regulation, banks can operate in the marketplace with little or no capital. And governments and deposit insurers end up holding the bag, bearing much of the risk and cost of failure. History shows this problem is very real ... as we saw with the U.S. banking and S &amp; L crisis in the late 1980s and 1990s. The final bill for inadequate capital regulation can be very heavy. In short, regulators can&#x27;t leave capital decisions totally to the banks. We wouldn&#x27;t be doing our jobs or serving the public interest if we did.

===Implementation progress===
Regulators in most jurisdictions around the world plan to implement the new accord, but with widely varying timelines and use of the varying methodologies being restricted. The United States&#x27; various regulators have agreed on a final approach. They have &quot;required&quot; the Internal Ratings-Based approach for the largest banks, and the standardized approach will be available for smaller banks.

In India, Reserve Bank of India has implemented the Basel II standardized norms on 31 March 2009 and is moving to internal ratings in credit and AMA (Advanced Measurement Approach) norms for operational risks in banks.

Existing RBI norms for banks in India (as of September 2010): Common equity (incl of buffer): 3.6% (Buffer Basel 2 requirement requirements are zero); Tier 1 requirement: 6%. Total Capital: 9% of risk-weighted assets.

According to the draft guidelines published by RBI the capital ratios are set to become: Common Equity as 5% + 2.5% (Capital Conservation Buffer) + 0–2.5% (Counter Cyclical Buffer), 7% of Tier 1 capital and minimum capital adequacy ratio (excluding Capital Conservation Buffer) of 9% of Risk Weighted Assets. Thus the actual capital requirement is between 11 and 13.5% (including Capital Conservation Buffer and Counter Cyclical Buffer).

In response to a questionnaire released by the Financial Stability Institute (FSI), 95 national regulators indicated they were to implement Basel II, in some form or another, by 2015.

The European Union has already implemented the Accord via the EU Capital Requirements Directives and many European banks already report their capital adequacy ratios according to the new system. All the credit institutions adopted it by 2008–09.

Australia, through its Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, implemented the Basel II Framework on 1 January 2008.

==Global financial crisis==

The role of Basel II, both before and after the global financial crisis, has been discussed widely. While some argue that the crisis demonstrated weaknesses in the framework, others have criticized it for actually increasing the effect of the crisis. In response to the financial crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published revised global standards, known as Basel III. The Committee claimed that the new standards would lead to a better quality of capital, increased coverage of risk for capital market activities and better liquidity standards among other benefits.

Nout Wellink, former chairman of the BCBS, wrote an article in September 2009 outlining some of the strategic responses which the Committee should take as response to the crisis. He proposed a stronger regulatory framework which comprises five key components: (a) better quality of regulatory capital, (b) better liquidity management and supervision, (c) better risk management and supervision including enhanced Pillar 2 guidelines, (d)
enhanced Pillar 3 disclosures related to securitization, off-balance sheet exposures and trading activities which would promote transparency, and (e) cross-border supervisory cooperation. Given one of the major factors which drove the crisis was the evaporation of liquidity in the financial markets, the BCBS also published principles for better liquidity management and supervision in September 2008.

A recent OECD study suggest that bank regulation based on the Basel accords encourage unconventional business practices and contributed to or even reinforced adverse systemic shocks that materialised during the financial crisis. According to the study, capital regulation based on risk-weighted assets encourages innovation designed to circumvent regulatory requirements and shifts banks&#x27; focus away from their core economic functions. Tighter capital requirements based on risk-weighted assets, introduced in the Basel III, may further contribute to these skewed incentives. New liquidity regulation, notwithstanding its good intentions, is another likely candidate to increase bank incentives to exploit regulation.

Think-tanks such as the World Pensions Council (WPC) have also argued that European legislators have pushed dogmatically and naively for the adoption of the Basel II recommendations, adopted in 2005, transposed in European Union law through the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), effective since 2008. In essence, they forced private banks, central banks, and bank regulators to rely more on assessments of credit risk by private rating agencies. Thus, part of the regulatory authority was abdicated in favour of private rating agencies.

Long before the implementation of Basel II George W. Stroke and Martin H. Wiggers pointed out, that a global financial and economic crisis will come, because of its systemic dependencies on a few rating agencies. After the breakout of the crisis Alan Greenspan agreed to this opinion in 2007. At least the Financial Crisis Inquiry Report confirmed this point of view in 2011.

<doc id="1291336" wikidata="Q2738807" url="?curid=1291336" title="Reinventing the wheel">
<text>To reinvent the wheel is to attempt to duplicate—most likely with inferior results—a basic method that has already previously been created or optimized by others. 

The inspiration for this idiomatic metaphor is that the wheel is an ancient archetype of human ingenuity (one so profound that it continues to underlie much of modern technology). As it has already been invented and is not considered to have any inherent flaws, an attempt to reinvent it would add no value to it and be a waste of time, diverting the investigator&#x27;s resources from possibly more worthy goals.

== Usage ==

The phrase is sometimes used without derision when a person&#x27;s activities might be perceived as merely reinventing the wheel when they actually possess additional value. For example, &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot; is an important tool in the instruction of complex ideas. Rather than providing students simply with a list of known facts and techniques and expecting them to incorporate these ideas perfectly and rapidly, the instructor instead will build up the material anew, leaving the student to work out those key steps which embody the reasoning characteristic of the field.

&quot;Reinventing the wheel&quot; may be an ironic cliche – it is not clear when the wheel itself was actually invented. The modern &quot;invention&quot; of the wheel might actually be a &quot;re-invention&quot; of an age-old invention. Additionally, many different wheels featuring enhancements on existing wheels (such as the many types of available tires) are regularly developed and marketed. The metaphor emphasizes understanding existing solutions, but not necessarily settling for them.

== In software development ==

In software development, reinventing the wheel is often necessary in order to work around software licensing incompatibilities or around technical and policy limitations present in parts or modules provided by third parties. An example would be to implement a quicksort for a script written in JavaScript and destined to be embedded in a web page. The quicksort algorithm is well known and readily available from libraries for software developers writing general-purpose applications in C++ or Java, but some JavaScript implementations do not provide this specific algorithm. Hence, if a developer wants to reliably use quicksort on their web page, they must &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; by reimplementing the algorithm. They could conceivably copy it from another web page, but then they could run into copyright and software licensing issues. Reinventing the wheel in this case provides the missing functionality and also avoids copyright issues.

Additionally, those new to a language (and especially those new to programming) will often attempt to manually write many functions for which a more robust and optimized equivalent already exists in the standard library or other easily available libraries. While this can be useful as a learning exercise, when done unknowingly the result is often less readable, less reliable, less tested and less optimized software which takes longer to write, test, maintain, and debug.

== Software projects that are reinvented wheels ==
*FreeDOS, a replica of MS-DOS
*FreeWin95, a replica of Windows 95
*ReactOS, a replica of Windows NT
*Apache Harmony, a replica of Java SE 5 and Java SE 6
*ruffle, a replica of Flash Player

== Related phrases ==

Reinventing the square wheel is the practice of unnecessarily engineering artifacts that provide functionality already provided by existing standard artifacts (reinventing the wheel) and ending up with a worse result than the standard (a square wheel). This is an anti-pattern which occurs when the engineer is unaware or contemptuous of the standard solution or does not understand the problem or the standard solution sufficiently to avoid problems overcome by the standard. It is mostly an affliction of inexperienced engineers, or the second-system effect.

Many problems contain subtleties that were resolved long ago in mainstream engineering (such as the importance of a wheel&#x27;s rim being smooth). Anyone starting from scratch, ignoring the prior art, will naturally face these problems afresh, and to produce a satisfactory result they will have to spend time developing solutions for them (most likely the same solutions that are already well known). However, when reinventing the wheel is undertaken as a subtask of a bigger engineering project, rather than as a project in its own right hoping to produce a better wheel, the engineer often does not anticipate spending much time on it. The result is that an underdeveloped, poorly performing version of the wheel is used, when using a standard wheel would have been quicker and easier, and would have given better results.

Preinventing the wheel involves delaying a task if it is expected to be undertaken later. An example would be, &quot;We don&#x27;t want to preinvent the wheel&quot; when discussing a solution to a problem when it is known that the solution is being developed elsewhere. It is not necessarily pejorative.

Redefining the wheel is the practice of coming up with new and often abstruse ways of describing things when the existing way of describing them was perfectly adequate.

<doc id="1291337" wikidata="Q5865743" url="?curid=1291337" title="History of Nottinghamshire">
<text>Nottinghamshire is a county that is situated in the East Midlands of England. The county has history within the Palaeolithic period, dating anywhere between 500,000 and 10,000 BCE, as well as early Anglo-Saxon communities, dating to 600 CE. Furthermore, the county has significance in the political aspects of English history, particularly within intercommunal fighting, and its economics is historically centred around coal and textiles.

==Chronology==
===Palaeolithic and Celtic settlements===
===English control===

The earliest Teutonic settlers in the district which is now Nottinghamshire were an Anglian tribe who, not later than the 5th century, advanced from Lincolnshire along the Fosseway, and, pushing their way up the Trent valley, settled in the fertile districts of the south and east, the whole region from Nottingham to within a short distance of Southwell being then occupied by the vast forest of Sherwood.

At the end of the 6th century Nottinghamshire already existed as organised territory, though its western limit probably extended no farther than the Saxon relics discovered at Oxton and Tuxford. Nottingham, after the treaty of Wedmore, became one of the five Danish boroughs. On the break-up of Mercia under Hardicanute, Nottinghamshire was included in the earldom of the Middle English, but in 1049 it again became part of Leofric&#x27;s earldom of Mercia, and descended to Edwin and Morkere.

===Land division===
The first mention of the shire of Nottingham occurs in 1016, when it was harried by Canute. The boundaries have remained practically unaltered since the time of the Domesday Survey from 1086, and the eight Domesday wapentakes were unchanged in 1610; in 1719 they had been reduced to six, their present number, Oswaldbeck being absorbed in Bassetlaw, of which it forms the North Clay division, and Lythe in Thurgarton.

Nottinghamshire was originally included in the diocese and province of York, and in 1291 formed an archdeaconry, comprising the deaneries of Nottingham, Newark, Bingham and Retford. By an act of Parliament of 1836 the county was transferred to the diocese of Lincoln and province of Canterbury, with the additional deanery of Southwell.

In 1878, the deaneries of Mansfield, South Bingham, West Bingham, Collingham, Tuxford and Worksop were created, and in 1884 most of the county was transferred to the newly created diocese of Southwell, the deaneries being unchanged. The deaneries of Bawtry, Bulwell, Gedling, East Newark and Norwell were created in 1888.

==Political history==
The most interesting historic figure in the Domesday survey of Nottinghamshire is William Peverel (1040 – c. 1115). His fief represents the honour of Nottingham, and in 1068 he was appointed constable of the castle which William the Conqueror had raised at Nottingham. The Cliftons of Clifton and the Byrons of Newstead held lands in Nottinghamshire at the time of the Survey. Holme Pierrepoint belonged to the Pierrepoints from the time of Edward L; Shelford was the seat of the Stanhopes, and Langar of the Tibetots, afterwards earls of Worcester. Archbishop Cranmer was a descendant of the Cranmers of Aslockton near Bingliam.

The political history of Nottinghamshire centres round the town and castle of Nottingham, which was seized by Robert of Gloucester on behalf of Maud in 1140; captured by John in 1191; surrendered to Henry III by the rebellious barons in 1264; formed an important station of Edward III in the Scottish wars; and in 1397 was the scene of a council where three of the lords appellant were appealed of treason. In the Wars of the Roses the county as a whole favoured the Yorkist cause, Nottingham being one of the most useful stations of Edward IV. In the Civil War of the 17th century most of the nobility and gentry favoured the Royalist cause, but Nottingham Castle was garrisoned for the parliament, and in 1651 was ordered to be demolished.

From 1295, the county and town of Nottingham each returned two members to parliament. In 1572 East Retford was represented by two members, and in 1672 Newark-upon-Trent also. Under the Reform Act 1832 the county returned four members in two divisions. By an act of Parliament of 1885 it returned four members in four divisions; Newark and East Retford were disfranchised, and Nottingham returned three members in three divisions.

Until 1568, Nottinghamshire was united with Derbyshire under one sheriff, the courts and tourns being held at Nottingham until the reign of Henry III, when with the assizes for both counties they were removed to Derby. In the time of Edward I the assizes were again held at Nottingham, where they are held at the present day. The Peverel Court, founded before 1113 for the recovery of small debts, had jurisdiction over 127 towns in Nottinghamshire, and was held at Nottingham until 1321, in 1330 at Algarthorpe and in 1790 at Lenton, being finally abolished in 1849.

==Economy==
Among the earliest industries of Nottinghamshire were the malting and woollen industries, which flourished in Norman times. The latter declined in the 16th century, and was superseded by the hosiery manufacture which sprang up after the invention of the stocking-loom in 1589.

The earliest evidence of the working of the Nottinghamshire coalfield is in 1259, when Queen Eleanor was unable to remain in this county on account of the smoke of the sea-coal. Collieries are scarcely heard of in Nottinghamshire in the 17th century, but in 1620 the justices of the peace for the shire report that there is no fear of scarcity of grain, as the counties which send up the Trent for coal bring grain in exchange, and in 1881 thirty-nine collieries were at work in the county. Hops were formerly extensively grown, and Worksop was famous for its liquorice. Numerous cotton mills were erected in Nottinghamshire in the 18th century, and there were silk-mills at Nottingham. The manufacture of tambour lace existed in Nottinghamshire in the 18th century, and was facilitated in the 19th century by the manufacture of machine-made net.

==Relics==
At the dissolution of the monasteries there were no fewer than forty religious houses in Nottinghamshire. The only important monastic remains, however, are those at Newstead, but the building is partly transformed into a mansion which was formerly the residence of Lord Byron. There are also traces of monastic ruins at Beauvale, Mattersey, Radford and Thurgarton.

The finest parish church in the county is that of Newark. The churches of St Mary, Nottingham, and of Southwell were collegiate churches; Southwell, now a cathedral, is a splendid building, principally Norman. The churches of Balderton, Bawtry, Hoveringham, Mansfield and Worksop are also partly Norman, and those of Coddington, Hawton and Upton St Peter near Southwell, Early English. Of the old castles, the principal remains are those at Newark, but there are several interesting old mansions, as at Kingshaugh, Scrooby, Shelford and Southwell. Wollaton Hall, near Nottingham, is a fine old building (c. 1580). The finest residences of more modern date are Welbeck and others in the Dukeries.

<text>A time-variant system is a system whose output response depends on moment of observation as well as moment of input signal application. In other words, a time delay or time advance of input not only shifts the output signal in time but also changes other parameters and behavior. Time variant systems respond differently to the same input at different times. The opposite is true for time invariant systems (TIV).

== Overview ==
There are many well developed techniques for dealing with the response of linear time invariant systems, such as Laplace and Fourier transforms. However, these techniques are not strictly valid for time-varying systems. A system undergoing slow time variation in comparison to its time constants can usually be considered to be time invariant: they are close to time invariant on a small scale. An example of this is the aging and wear of electronic components, which happens on a scale of years, and thus does not result in any behaviour qualitatively different from that observed in a time invariant system: day-to-day, they are effectively time invariant, though year to year, the parameters may change. Other linear time variant systems may behave more like nonlinear systems, if the system changes quickly – significantly differing between measurements.

The following things can be said about a time-variant system:
* It has explicit dependence on time.
* It does not have an impulse response in the normal sense. The system can be characterized by an impulse response except the impulse response must be known at each and every time instant. 
* It is not stationary in the sense of constancy of the signal&#x27;s distributional frequency. This means that the parameters which govern the signal&#x27;s process exhibit varaition with the passage of time. See Stationarity (statistics) for in-depth theoretics regarding this property.

== Linear time-variant systems ==
Linear-time variant (LTV) systems are the ones whose parameters vary with time according to previously specified laws. Mathematically, there is a well defined dependence of the system over time and over the input parameters that change over time.

:formula_1

In order to solve time-variant systems, the algebraic methods initial conditions of the system i.e. whether the system is zero-input or non-zero input system.

== Examples of time-variant systems ==
The following time varying systems cannot be modelled by assuming that they are time invariant:
* The Earth&#x27;s thermodynamic response to incoming Solar irradiance varies with time due to changes in the Earth&#x27;s albedo and the presence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
*Discrete wavelet transform, often used in modern signal processing, is time variant because it makes use of the decimation operation.

<doc id="1291347" wikidata="Q5864808" url="?curid=1291347" title="History of Herefordshire">
<text>The known history of Herefordshire starts with a shire in the time of King Athelstan (), and Herefordshire is mentioned in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; in 1051. The first Anglo-Saxon settlers, the 7th-century Magonsætan, were a sub-tribal unit of the Hwicce who occupied the Severn valley. The undulating hills of marl clay were surrounded by the Welsh mountains to the west; by the Malvern Hills to the east; by the Clent Hills of the Shropshire borders to the north, and by the indeterminate extent of the Forest of Dean to the south. The shire name first recorded in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; may derive from &quot;Here-ford&quot;, Old English for &quot;army crossing&quot;, the location for the city of Hereford.

The area was absorbed into the Mercian kingdom by Offa of Mercia (), who – traditionally – constructed Offa&#x27;s Dyke as a boundary to keep warring Western tribes out of Mercia: an early indication of ambivalent relations between the Anglo-Saxons and the Welsh. The shire as an administrative unit was developed from Burghal Hidage ( 915–917), of Alfred the Great&#x27;s son Edward the Elder () and from the Shire-reeve courts of the Hundred. In 676, during the reign of King Æthelred of Mercia the Archbishop of Canterbury Saint Theodore of Tarsus founded the Diocese of Hereford to minister to the minor sub-kingdom of Magonsaete, and he appointed Putta as the first Bishop of Hereford. The establishment of a centre of law and justice was supported by a monastic chapter that flourished during the tenth-century reformation. Hereford&#x27;s geographical location at the hub of the shire allowed Anglo-Saxon ealdormen to manage affairs; and Hereford played a vital role in the Scandinavian wars until Ralph, Earl Hereford was deposed (1055) by the regal Earl Harold Godwinson.

In the feudal Domesday Survey some adjacent areas of the Welsh Marches are assessed under Herefordshire. The western and southern borders remained debatable ground (&quot;Archenfield&quot;) until, with the incorporation of the Welsh Marches in 1535, considerable territory was annexed to Herefordshire. These areas formed the hundreds of Wigmore, Ewyas Lacy and Huntington, while Ewyas Harold was subsumed into Webtree Hundred. At the time of the Domesday Survey the divisions of the county were very unsettled. As many as nineteen hundreds are mentioned, but these were of varying extent, some containing only one manor, some from twenty to thirty. Of the twelve modern hundreds, only Greytree, Radlow, Stretford, Wolphy and Wormelow retained their original Domesday names. The others were Broxash, Ewyas-Lacy, Grimsworth, Huntington, Webtree and Wigmore. Herefordshire is on the Welsh border (and before that the ancient boundary of the Welsh Marches).

In the modern era the boundaries of the Forest were not set until 1750, by which period several Bishops&#x27; Peculiars were reassessed for land valuation and redistribution. Some land in the north-west of the county was ceded to Shropshire, and some land in the east to Worcestershire. However, in the south-west the Golden Valley lands were confirmed as &quot;Herefordiensis&quot; (Herefordian). A unique source for the history of the county is the Chained Library at Hereford Cathedral which contained some of the earliest printed books in Europe, printed by the Gutenberg press. During the English Civil Wars it acted as a royal treasury.

During the medieval period the county had been defined in law by violence and cruel punishments. It played a large part in various civil wars and gave rise to Lollardism. A fiercely independent folk and a position on the border with Wales gave the county a reputation for a frontier mentality. Many were hanged for hayrick burning, owing to the relatively low agricultural wage, during the Swing Riots and later. However, in contrast to Norfolk, for example, it did not form a militant agricultural workers&#x27; union.

Herefordshire continued to be backward in industrial development: the canals and railways arrived later than elsewhere in England. Development reflected local needs: processing cider apples, manufacturing agricultural machinery. It was not until the 1930s that the first female councillors were elected, and that a rural bus service could provide a short journey into Hereford. The population remained static for 150 years until 2000, at about 150,000.

==Historical setting==

===Welsh control===

Before the arrival of the West Saxons, the region roughly corresponding to modern Herefordshire lay under the control of earlier Welsh kingdoms, principally the minor kingdom of Ergyng. Welsh origins in Herefordshire are evident in the survival of the Welsh language in parts of the county until the 19th century, the survival of many Welsh place names and the historic Welsh commote of Archenfield. In 1887 it was written:

Welsh was spoken by individuals until comparatively recently. The photograph shown is of a plaque in Welsh on display in St Margaret&#x27;s Church, near Newton, which was dismantled from the roof of the nave during restoration in 1902. The plaque is dated 1574.

A bilingual printed notice of the duties of churchwardens is also displayed in St Margaret&#x27;s Church. It is likely to be at least 170 years old, since the churches transferred from the diocese of St David&#x27;s to that of Hereford in the middle of the 19th century. Two fire-damaged Welsh bibles from Rowlestone are kept in the Herefordshire County Archives.

===Anglo-Saxon control===

At some time in the 7th century the West Saxons pushed their way across the Severn and established themselves in the territory between Wales and Mercia, and established the minor kingdom of Magonset, which was later absorbed into Mercia. The district which is now Herefordshire was occupied by a tribe, the Hecanas, who congregated chiefly in the fertile area about Hereford and in the mining districts round Ross-on-Wye. In the 8th century Offa extended the Mercian frontier to the Wye, securing it by the earthwork known as Offa&#x27;s Dyke.

===Danish and Norman control===
A report in the Herefordshire Archaeology and Historic Environment Record provides this chronology of 9th Century involvement with the Danes:During the 9th century the Vikings were able to make incursions into the south of Herefordshire by sailing up the Severn and Wye rivers. Between AD 866 and 874 King Burgred of Mercia was involved in almost constant battles with the Vikings. By 877 the Vikings were in the position of being able to establish one of their own leaders, Ceolwulf, as king.

In 2015, two individuals (operating without landowner permission), using metal detectors, found a large hoard near Leominster consisting primarily of Saxon jewellery and silver ingots but also coins; the latter date to around 879 CE. According to a news report, &quot;experts believe it [the hoard] was buried by a Viking during a series of raids known to have taken place in the area at that time&quot;, while Wessex was ruled by Alfred the Great and Mercia by Ceolwulf II of Mercia. Imperial coins recovered from the treasure hunters depicted both Alfred the Great and Ceolwulf II of Mercia, indicating &quot;a previously-unknown alliance between the kingdoms of Wessex and Mercia&quot; according to a news report. &quot;These coins enable us to re-interpret our history at a key moment in the creation of England as a single kingdom,&quot; said Gareth Williams, curator of early medieval coins at the British Museum.

A listing about the Archenfield area of Herefordshire appeared in the 1870-72 Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales with the following specifics about early incidents involving the Danes:IRCHINGFIELD, or ARCHENFIELD, a quondam liberty and a rural deanery in the S of Hereford. The liberty was known to the ancient Welsh as Urging, to the Saxons as Ircingafeld, and at Domesday as Arcenfelde; was ravaged in 905 by the Danes, and given afterwards, by the Crown, to the Earls of Shrewsbury; and had the custom of gavelkind, and some other peculiar customs. 
In 914 CE the Danes again made their way up the Severn to the district of Archenfield and ravaged the area. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (915 CE, Worcester Manuscript, p. 99), the jarls leading the raids, Ohtor and Hroald, captured Cyfeiliog, also referred to as Cameleac or Cimeliauc, the Bishop of Llandaff. The bishop was later ransomed by King Edward the Elder for forty pounds in silver. The &quot;jarl Hroald and the other jarl Ohtor&#x27;s brother&quot; were killed in 915 CE, probably at &quot;Killdane Field&quot; (or &quot;Kill Dane&quot;) in Weston-under-Penyard and the raiders left the area, leaving some hostages as a peace bond. 
In 921 CE, the Danes besieged Wigmore, which had been rebuilt in that year by Edward the Elder.

From the time of its first settlement the district was the scene of constant border warfare with the Welsh, and Harold, whose earldom included this county, ordered that any Welshman caught trespassing over the border should lose his right hand. In the period preceding the Conquest much disturbance was caused by the outrages of the Norman colony planted in this county by Edward the Confessor. Richard I&#x27;s castle in the north of the county was the first Norman fortress erected on English soil, and Wigmore, Ewyas Harold, Clifford, Weobley, Hereford, Donnington and Caldicot were all the sites of Norman strongholds. Then William the Conqueror entrusted the subjugation of Herefordshire to William FitzOsbern, but Edric the Wild, in conjunction with the Welsh, prolonged violent resistance against him for two years.

===Return to English control===

During &quot;The Anarchy&quot; – the prolonged civil war of Stephen&#x27;s reign – Hereford Castle and Weobley castle were held against the king, but were captured in 1138. Prince Edward, afterwards Edward I, was imprisoned in Hereford Castle, and famously escaped from there in 1265. In 1326 the parliament assembled at Hereford deposed Edward II. In the 14th and 15th centuries the forest of Deerfold gave refuge to some of the most noted followers of Wycliffe. During the Wars of the Roses the influence of the Mortimers led the county to support the Yorkist cause, and Edward, afterwards Edward IV, raised 23,000 men in this neighbourhood. The Battle of Mortimer&#x27;s Cross was fought in 1461 near Wigmore. Before the outbreak of the civil war of the 17th century, complaints of illegal taxation were rife in Herefordshire, but a strong anti-Puritan feeling induced the county to favour the royalist cause. Hereford, Goodrich and Ledbury all endured sieges.

== Earls of Hereford ==

The earldom of Hereford was granted by William I to William FitzOsbern, about 1067, but on the outlawry of his son Roger in 1074 the title lapsed until conferred on Henry de Bohun about 1199. It remained in the possession of the de Bohuns until the death of Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford in 1373; in 1397 Henry, Earl of Derby, afterwards King Henry IV, who had married Mary de Bohun, was created Duke of Hereford. Edward VI created Walter Devereux, a descendant of the de Bohun family, Viscount Hereford, in 1550, and his grandson, the famous earl of Essex, was born in this county. Since this date the viscounty has been held by the Devereux family, and the holder ranks as the premier viscount of England. The families of Clifford, Giffard and Mortimer figured prominently in the warfare on the Welsh border, and the Talbots, Lacys, Crofts and Scudamores all had important seats in the county, Sir James Scudamore of Holme Lacy being the original of the Sir Scudamore of Spenser&#x27;s Faerie Queene. Sir John Oldcastle, the leader of the Lollards, was sheriff of Herefordshire in 1406, before arrest and execution for treason by Henry V.

===Diocese===

Herefordshire has been included in the diocese of Hereford since its foundation in 676. In 1291 it comprised the Deaneries of Hereford, Weston, Leominster, Weobley, Frome, Archenfield and Ross in the Archdeaconry of Hereford, and the Deaneries of Burford, Stottesdon, Ludlow, Pontesbury, Clun and Wenlock, in the Archdeaconry of Shropshire. In 1877 the name of the Archdeaconry of Shropshire was changed to Ludlow, and in 1899 the Deaneries of Abbey Dore, Bromyard, Kingsland, Kington and Ledbury were created in the Archdeaconry of Hereford. The Bishop held a number of Peculiarities in another jurisdiction: Dymock in Gloucestershire was named after a Queen&#x27;s Champion from Lincolnshire who fought in the Welsh Wars for Edward I but the manor long had connections with the Talbots, manorial landowners and familial relations from the county, proven by recent archaeology. The manor was also occupied by the Roundheads and Scots during the Civil Wars, was on the railway line, and on the earlier canal from Hereford city.

==Politics==

Herefordshire was governed by a sheriff as early as the reign of Edward the Confessor, the shire court meeting at Hereford where later the assizes and quarter sessions were also held. In 1606 an act of Parliament was passed declaring Hereford free from the jurisdiction of the Council of Wales, but the county was not finally relieved from the interference of the Marcher Lords until the reign of William III and Mary II. Herefordshire was first represented in Parliament in 1295, when it returned two members, the boroughs of Ledbury, Hereford, Leominster and Weobley being also represented. Hereford was again represented in 1299, and Bromyard and Ross in 1304, but the boroughs made very irregular returns, and from 1306 until Weobley regained representation in 1627, only Hereford and Leominster were represented. Under the Reform Act 1832 the county returned three members and Weobley was disfranchised. The Reform Act 1867 deprived Leominster of one member, and under the Reform Act 1885 Leominster was disfranchised, and Hereford lost one member.

==Economy==

Herefordshire has always been esteemed as an exceptionally rich agricultural area; the manufactures were comparatively unimportant, except for the woollen and cloth trade which flourished soon after the Conquest. Iron was worked in Wormelow hundred in Roman times, and the Domesday Survey mentions iron workers in Marcle. At the time of Henry VIII the towns had become much impoverished, and Elizabeth, to encourage local industries, insisted on her subjects wearing English-made caps from the factory of Hereford. Hops were grown in the county soon after their introduction into England in 1524. In 1580 and again in 1637 the county was severely visited by the plague, but in the 17th century it had a flourishing timber trade, and was also noted for its orchards and cider.

<text>The history of Northamptonshire spans the same period as English history.

==Prehistory==
Much of Northamptonshire&#x27;s countryside appears to have remained somewhat intractable with regards to early human occupation, resulting in an apparently sparse population and relatively few finds from the Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic periods. In about 500 BC the Iron Age was introduced into the area by a continental people in the form of the Hallstatt culture, and over the next century a series of hill-forts were constructed at Arbury Camp, Rainsborough camp, Borough Hill, Castle Dykes, Guilsborough, Irthlingborough, and most notably of all, Hunsbury Hill. There are two more possible hill-forts at Arbury Hill (Badby) and Thenford.

==Roman occupation==
In the 1st century BC, most of what later became Northamptonshire became part of the territory of the Catuvellauni, a Belgic tribe, the Northamptonshire area forming their most northerly possession. The Catuvellauni were in turn conquered by the Romans in 43 AD.

The Roman road of Watling Street passed through the county, and an important Roman settlement, &quot;Lactodorum&quot;, stood on the site of modern-day Towcester. There were other Roman settlements at Northampton, Kettering and along the Nene Valley near Raunds. A large fort was built at Longthorpe.

==Anglo-Saxons==
After the Romans left, the area eventually became part of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia, and Northampton functioned as an administrative centre. The Mercians converted to Christianity in 654 AD with the death of the pagan king Penda.

At some time in the 7th century the district which is now Northamptonshire suffered a simultaneous invasion by the West Saxons from the south and the Anglian tribes from the north. Relics discovered in the county testify to a mingling of people, at the same time showing that West Saxon influence never spread farther north than a line from Daventry to Warwick, and with the extension of the Mercian kingdom under Penda and the conversion of the midland districts ceased altogether.

Abbeys at Medehamstede (now Peterborough) and Pipewell were begun by Peada in 655, and at about the same time foundations were established at Peakirk, Weedon Beck, Castor and Oundle.

From about 889 the area was conquered by the Danes (as at one point almost all of England was, except for Athelney marsh in Somerset) and became part of the Danelaw – with Watling Street serving as the boundary – until being recaptured by the English under the Wessex king Edward the Elder, son of Alfred the Great, in 917. Northamptonshire was conquered again in 940, this time by the Vikings of York, who devastated the area, only for the county to be retaken by the English in 942. Consequently, it is one of the few counties in England to have both Saxon and Danish town-names and settlements.

The county was first recorded in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (1011), as &quot;Hamtunscire&quot;: the &quot;scire&quot; (shire) of &quot;Hamtun&quot; (the homestead). The &quot;North&quot; was added to distinguish Northampton from the other important &quot;Hamtun&quot; further south: Southampton – though the origins of the two names are in fact different.

As a shire Northamptonshire was probably of Danish origin, representing in the 10th century the area which owed allegiance to Northampton as a political and administrative centre. In 921 this area extended to the River Welland, the present northern limit of the county. In the 11th century Northamptonshire was included in Tostig&#x27;s northern earldom; but in 1065, together with Huntingdonshire, it was detached from Northumbria and bestowed on Waltheof.

==Norman conquest and later middle ages==
The only monastic foundation which survived the Conquest was Peterborough. At the time of the Domesday Survey the boundaries of Northamptonshire were approximately the same as the present day. Northamptonshire is first mentioned by name in the &quot;Historia Eliensis&quot;, in connection with events which occurred at the close of the 10th century. At the time of the Domesday survey the chief lay-tenant in Northamptonshire was Robert, earl of Mortain, whose fief escheated to the crown in 1106. The estates of William Peverel, founder of the Abbey of St James at Northampton, also escheated to the crown in the 12th century.

Norman castles existed at Rockingham, Barnwell, Lilbourne, Northampton and Wellingborough.

The Geld roll of the time of William I and the Domesday Survey of 1086 mention 28 hundreds in Northamptonshire, and part of Rutland is assessed under this county. By 1316 the divisions had undergone considerable changes, both in name and in extent, and had been reduced to their present number, 20, since which date they have remained practically unaltered. The names of the hundreds point to primitive meeting-places gradually superseded by villages and towns. For example, the court for Fawsley hundred met under a large beech tree in Fawsley Park until the beginning of the 18th century, when it was transferred to Everdon. The shire court originally met at Northampton.

Northamptonshire was originally included in the Diocese of Lincoln. The archdeaconry of Northampton is mentioned in the 12th century, and in 1291 included the deaneries of Peterborough, Northampton, Brackley, Oundle, Higham, Daventry, Preston, Weldon, Rothwell and Haddon.

Northampton was a favourite meeting-place of the councils and parliaments of the Norman and Plantagenet kings. In 1215 John was besieged in Northampton Castle by the barons, and in 1264, Henry III captured the castle from the younger Simon de Montfort.

==Wars of the Roses (15th century)==
During the Wars of the Roses, Henry VI was defeated at Northampton in 1460.

==Tudors (16th century)==

The Diocese of Peterborough was created in 1541.

==Civil War (17th century)==
In the Civil War of the 17th century, the county declared almost unanimously for the parliament. Although a royalist garrison was placed at Towcester by Prince Rupert in 1644, it was almost immediately withdrawn.

==19th century==
In 1875, the archdeaconry of Oakham was formed and included in this county the first and second deaneries of Peterborough and the deaneries of Oundle, Weldon and Higham Ferrers. By 1900 the Northampton archdeaconry included the first, second and third deaneries of Brackwell and Rothwell, the first and second deaneries of Haddon and Preston, and the deaneries of Daventry, Northampton and Weldon.

==Country seats==
Holdenby House was built by Sir Christopher Hatton, privy councillor to Queen Elizabeth, and Yardley Hastings was named from the Hastings, formerly earls of Pembroke. Higham Ferrers was the seat of the Ferrers family; Braybrook Castle was built by Robert of Braybrooke, a favourite of King John; and Burghley House gave the title of baron to William Cecil.

==Parliamentary representation==
In 1290 Northamptonshire returned two members to parliament, and in 1295 Northampton also returned two members. In 1547 Brackley and Peterborough returned each two members, and in 1557 Higham Ferrers returned one member. Following the Reform Act 1832, the county returned four members in two divisions; both Brackley and Higham Ferrers were disfranchised.

==Economic history==
The iron-mines and stone-quarries of Northamptonshire were worked in Roman times, but the former were entirely neglected from the Plantagenet period until their rediscovery in 1850, while the two most famous quarries, those of Barnack and Stanion, were exhausted about the 16th century. The wool and leather industries flourished in Norman times.

In the 17th century the weaving industry declined in the Northampton district, but flourished around Kettering. Other early industries were charcoal-burning, brick and tile manufacture and brewing. The industries of whip-making, pipe-making, silk-weaving and paper-making were introduced in the 17th and 18th centuries. Tanning was a flourishing industry, and provided the materials for shoemaking which became a principal industry in the county. Northamptonshire made boots for Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s New Model Army, and the making of army boots continued to be an important feature of the economy until the 20th century, as well as boots and shoes of other kinds.

==Relics==

Although Northamptonshire was rich in monastic foundations, remains, except of the abbey-church of Peterborough, afterwards the cathedral, are of small importance. At Geddington, and also at Hardingstone, near Northampton, there is an Eleanor cross, erected by Edward I to the memory of his queen, in good preservation.

For the architecture of its churches, Northampton holds a place scarcely inferior to any other English county. To the Saxon period belong the tower of Earls Barton church, which stands on what is probably the mound of an old English strong-house; the tower and other portions at Brigstock; the ground plan and other portions at Wittering; the remarkable tower at Barnack; and Brixworth church, constructed in part of Roman materials, and by some believed to include part of a Roman basilica.

Of Norman, besides the cathedral of Peterborough, the finest examples are St Peter&#x27;s and St Sepulchre&#x27;s, Northampton, and the tower of Castor church. St Mary&#x27;s church, Higham Ferrers, formerly collegiate, Early English and Decorated, is one of the finest churches in the county, and, as specially noteworthy among many beautiful buildings, there may be mentioned the churches at Irthlingborough and Lowick, with their lantern towers, Warmington, a very fine specimen of Early English work, Rushden, Finedon, Raunds and Fotheringhay.

Philip Porter Thomas Percy, author of the &quot;Percy&#x27;s Reliques&quot;, and afterwards Bishop of Dromore, was rector of the church at Easton Maudit.

A gateway at Rockingham, leading to the castle, which is still lived in, and earth-works at Higham Ferrers and Brackley are worthy of mention. Only a large mound and visible earthworks remain of the castle at Fotheringhay, famous as the scene of the imprisonment, trial and execution of Mary, Queen of Scots. Part of the house which was the birthplace of Richard III still stands and is now a private dwelling.

Barnwell Castle, founded by William the Conqueror, an interesting example of the defensive construction of the period, is still a fine ruin, which includes four of the round towers and an imposing gateway.

Holdenby Manor House, where Sir Christopher Hatton (1540–1591) was born, and where Charles I was staying when he was carried away by Cornet Joyce, is largely restored.

Among ancient mansions are Castle Ashby, the seat of the Comptons, the oldest portion belonging to the reign of Henry VIII; Althorp, the seat of the Spencers, of various dates; Drayton House, of the time of Henry VI; the vast pile of Burghley House, Stamford, founded by Lord Burghley (1553), but more than once altered and enlarged; Kirby Hall, a beautiful Elizabethan building once the residence of Sir Christopher Hatton; and Lilford Hall a fine example of a Jacobean mansion.

<doc id="1291359" wikidata="Q5775243" url="?curid=1291359" title="History of Bedfordshire">
<text>Bedfordshire is an English ceremonial county which lies between approximately 25 miles and 55 miles (or approximately 40 and 90 kilometres) north of central London.

==Anglo-Saxon Bedfordshire==

Early 5th century Saxon burial sites have been discovered at Kempston and Sandy, two Bedfordshire towns on the River Great Ouse and its tributary the River Ivel, as well as at Luton, in the south of the county on the River Lea (a tributary of the Thames). These sites are all in the vicinity of Roman towns, suggesting that these may have been the site of Saxon &quot;foederati&quot; employed by Romano-British inhabitants to protect their towns. A seventh century settlement at Stratton, near Biggleswade has also been found.

The area may have remained part of a British enclave until the Battle of Bedcanford (Bedford) in 571, when Cuthwulf inflicted a severe defeat on the Britons and took the towns of Eynsham, Aylesbury, Benson and Limbury. This area may have coincided with the &quot;Chilternsetna&quot; who comprised 4,000 hides in the Tribal Hidage (compared to 7,000 for Essex).

During the Heptarchy what is now Bedfordshire formed part of Mercia; by the Treaty of Wedmore it became part of the Danelaw.

The Vikings of Bedford were subdued by King Edward the Elder in 915, and he built two burhs at Bedford on each side of the River Ouse. Four hundreds were formed on each side to support each burgh - Willey, Stodden, Buckelow and Barford in the north and Redbornstoke, Wixamtree, Biggleswade and Clifton in the south. The boundary to the north largely coincides with the watershed between the Nene and Ouse rivers, presumed to also be the boundary between the land of the Vikings based at Bedford and Northampton; the western boundary aligns with the Newport Hundreds, similarly laid out to support the new burh at Newport Pagnell, and the eastern boundary with the hundreds of Huntingdon.

The first mention of the county comes in 1016 when King Canute &quot;laid waste to the whole shire&quot;.

== Norman Bedfordshire ==
There was no organised resistance to William the Conqueror within Bedfordshire, though the Domesday survey reveals an almost complete substitution of Norman for English landholders.

Bedfordshire suffered severely in the civil war of King Stephen&#x27;s reign; the great Roll of the Exchequer of 1165 proves the shire receipts had depreciated in value to two-thirds of the assessment for the Danegeld. Again the county was thrown into the First Barons&#x27; War when Bedford Castle, seized from the Beauchamps by Falkes de Breauté one of the royal partisans, was the scene of three sieges before being demolished on the king&#x27;s order in 1224 . The Peasants Revolt (1377–1381) was marked by less violence in Bedfordshire than in neighbouring counties; the Annals of Dunstable make brief mention of a rising in that town and the demand for and granting of a charter.

A large part of the county was subject to forest law as a royal forest, until 1191.

In 1638 ship money was levied on Bedfordshire, and in the English Civil War that followed, the county was one of the foremost in opposing the king. Clarendon observed that here Charles I had no visible party or fixed quarter.

The earliest original parliamentary writ that has been discovered was issued in 1290 when two members were returned for the county. In 1295 in addition to the county members, writs are found for two members to represent Bedford borough. Subsequently, until modern times two county and two borough members were returned regularly.

==Sub county level administration==

===Before 1835===

Bedfordshire was divided into nine hundreds, Barford, Biggleswade, Clifton, Flitt, Manshead, Redbornestoke, Stodden, Willey and Wixamtree, and the liberty, half hundred or borough of Bedford. From the Domesday survey it appears that in the 11th century there were three additional half hundreds, viz. Stanburge, Buchelai and Weneslai, which had by the 14th century become parts of the hundreds of Manshead, Willey and Biggleswade respectively.

Until 1574 one sheriff did duty for Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire, the shire court of the former being held at Bedford. The jurisdiction of the hundred courts, excepting Flitt, remained in the king&#x27;s possession. Flitt was parcel of the manor of Luton, and formed part of the marriage portion of Eleanor, sister of Henry III, and wife of William Marshall. The burgesses of Bedford and the prior of Dunstable claimed jurisdictional freedom in those two boroughs. The hundred Rolls and the &quot;Placita de quo warranto&quot; show that important jurisdiction had accrued to the great over-lordships, such as those of Beauchamp, Wahull and Caynho, and to several religious houses, the prior of St John of Jerusalem claiming rights in more than fifty places in the county.

===18351894=== 
Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 the county was divided into poor law unions, each consisting of a town and surrounding rural parishes. The poor law unions based in Bedfordshire towns were Ampthill, Bedford, Biggleswade, Leighton Buzzard, Luton, and Woburn. In addition, a handful of parishes near the boundaries of Bedfordshire were included in poor law unions based in towns in other counties, namely Hitchin in Hertfordshire, St Neots in Huntingdonshire and Wellingborough in Northamptonshire.

Urban areas

Bedford was the only ancient borough in the county still operating at the time of the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. Dunstable was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1864 and Luton in 1876.

Urban local government in Bedfordshire in this period took one of three forms:
*Municipal Boroughs created under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835;
*Local Board Districts created under the Public Health Act 1848 and governed by a local board of health; or
*Local Government Districts created under the Local Government Act 1858 and governed by a local board.
Under the Public Health Acts of 1872 and 1875 these areas also became urban sanitary districts, with their existing council or board acting as urban sanitary authority.

Rural areas

Until 1872, local government in rural areas was limited to the parish vestries. As well as giving sanitary responsibilities to the urban authorities above, the Public Health Acts of 1872 and 1875 also established rural sanitary districts for the areas of each poor law union outside the urban authorities. These rural sanitary districts were administered by the existing boards of guardians for the poor law unions.

===18941974===
The Local Government Act 1894 replaced the system of sanitary districts with urban and rural districts, each with an elected council. The urban districts, rural districts and municipal boroughs were collectively termed county districts and formed the principal subdivisions for local government for the next eighty years. Where sanitary districts had straddled county boundaries they were split or otherwise boundaries were adjusted so that each county district was solely in one county. Some of the adjustments to boundaries took a couple of years to finalise after the 1894 act, so there were some short-lived anomalies where districts initially straddled county boundaries, but these were all resolved for Bedfordshire by 1897.

===19742009===
The Local Government Act 1972 replaced the system of urban and rural district councils with a two-tier system of metropolitan and non-metropolitan county and district councils.

County council (principal authority)
*Bedfordshire

Borough and district councils
*Bedford district (renamed North Bedfordshire Borough in 1975, changed name again to Bedford Borough in 1992)
*Luton Borough
*Mid Bedfordshire district
*South Bedfordshire district

In 1997 Luton became a unitary authority, meaning the borough became administratively independent of Bedfordshire County Council. Luton remained part of Bedfordshire for ceremonial purposes.

===Since 2009===
In 2006 the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) considered reorganising Bedfordshire&#x27;s administrative structure as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England. The four proposals considered were:

* &quot;Proposal 1,&quot; To abolish the three districts within the county to create a &quot;Bedfordshire unitary authority&quot;. (Luton would remain a separate unitary authority.)
* &quot;Proposal 2,&quot; To create two unitary authorities: one based on the existing Bedford Borough, and the other, to be known as &quot;Central Bedfordshire&quot;, a combination of Mid Bedfordshire and South Bedfordshire Districts. (Luton would remain a separate unitary authority.)
* &quot;Proposal 3,&quot; To create two unitary authorities: one a combination of Bedford Borough and Mid Bedfordshire District, and one a combination of Luton Borough and South Bedfordshire District.
* &quot;Proposal 4,&quot; To form an &quot;enhanced two-tier&quot; authority, with the four local councils under the control of the county council, but with different responsibilities.

On 6 March 2008 the DCLG decided to implement &quot;Proposal 2&quot;. Bedfordshire County Council initially challenged this decision in the High Court, but on 4 April 2008 it was announced the Judicial Review in the High Court had been unsuccessful, and the County Council declared they would not be appealing the decision.

Unitary authorities
*Bedford Borough
*Central Bedfordshire
*Luton Borough

Bedfordshire County Council was formally abolished on 1 April 2009, with its powers transferred to the new unitary authorities. the three authority areas continue to form the ceremonial county of Bedfordshire for functions such as lieutenancy and High Sheriff.

==Industry and agriculture==

Owing to its favorable agricultural conditions, up until at least the late nineteenth century Bedfordshire was predominantly an agricultural rather than a manufacturing county. From the 13th to the 15th century sheep farming flourished, Bedfordshire wool being in demand and plentiful. Surviving records show that in assessments of wool to the king, Bedfordshire always provided its full quota. Tradition says that the straw-plait industry owes its introduction to James I, who transferred to Luton the colony of Lorraine plaiters whom Mary, Queen of Scots, had settled in Scotland.

Bedfordshire was one of the main centres of the English lace industry from the 16th century to the start of the 20th century, although early records are sparse and assertions of the role of Huguenot refugees in the industry are unsupported by evidence. In the early 18th century Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;A tour thro’ the whole island of Great Britain&quot; refers to the extent and quality of Bedfordshire lace manufacture, and the Northampton Militia Lists of 1777 document the number of lacemakers in different parts of the county at that time.

==Prominent landed families==

Woburn Abbey, belonging to the Russells since 1547, is the seat of the Dukes of Bedford, the greatest landowner in the county. The Burgoynes of Sutton, whose baronetcy dates from 1641, have been in Bedfordshire since the 15th century, while the Osborn family have owned Chicksands Priory since its purchase by Peter Osborn in 1576. Sir Phillip Monoux Payne represents the ancient Morioux family of Wootton. Other county families are the Crawleys of Stockwood near Luton, the Brandreths of Houghton Regis, and the Orlebars of Hinwick.

==Ecclesiastical history==

On the division of the Mercian diocese in 679 Bedfordshire was allocated to the new see of Dorchester. It formed part of the Diocese of Lincoln from 1075 until 1837, when it was transferred to the Diocese of Ely. In 1914 the Archdeaconry of Bedford, virtually corresponding to the county, was transferred to the Diocese of St Albans. In 1291 Bedfordshire was an archdeaconry including six rural deaneries, which remained practically unaltered until 1880, when they were increased to eleven with a new schedule of parishes.

==Antiquities and architecture==

The monastic remains in Bedfordshire include the fine fragment of the church of the Augustinian priory at Dunstable, serving as the parish church; Elstow Abbey near Bedford, which belonged to a Benedictine nunnery founded by Judith, niece of William the Conqueror in 1078; and portions of the Gilbertine Chicksands Priory and of a Cistercian foundation at Old Warden. In the parish churches, many of which are of great interest, the predominant styles are Decorated and Perpendicular. Work of pre-Conquest date, however, is found in the massive tower of Clapham church, the tower of St. Peter&#x27;s Church in Bedford town centre, and in a door of St Mary the Virgin in Stevington. Fine Norman and Early English work is seen at Dunstable and Elstow, and the later style is illustrated by the large cruciform churches at Leighton Buzzard and at Felmersham on the Ouse above Bedford. Among the perpendicular additions to the church last named may be noted a very beautiful oaken rood screen. To illustrate Decorated and Perpendicular the churches of Clifton and of Marston Moretaine, with its massive detached bell tower, may be mentioned; and Cople church is a good specimen of fine Perpendicular work. The church of Cockayne Hatley, near Potton, is fitted with rich Flemish carved wood, mostly from the abbey of Alne near Charleroi, and dating from 1689, but brought here by a former rector early in the 19th century. In medieval domestic architecture the county is not rich. The mansion of Woburn Abbey dates mainly from the middle of the 18th century in its present form.

<doc id="1291365" wikidata="Q5775523" url="?curid=1291365" title="History of Cambridgeshire">
<text>The English county of Cambridgeshire has a long history.

== Anglo-Saxon times ==
The area that is now Cambridgeshire was settled at about the 6th century by groups of Angles, who pushed their way up the Ouse and the Cam, and established themselves in the fen-district, where they became known as the Gyrwas, the districts corresponding to the modern counties of Huntingdonshire and Cambridgeshire being distinguished as the lands of the North Gyrwas and the South Gyrwas respectively. At this period the fen-district stretched southward as far as Cambridge, and the essential unity which it preserved is illustrated later by its inclusion under one sheriff, chosen in successive years from Cambridgeshire proper and the Liberty of the Isle of Ely.

In 656 numerous lands in the neighbourhood of Wisbech were included in the endowment of the abbey of Peterborough, and in the same century religious houses were established at Ely and Thorney, both of which, however, were destroyed during the Danish invasions of the 9th century. After the Treaty of Wedmore, the district became part of the Danelaw. On the expulsion of the Danes by Edward the Elder in the 10th century it was included in East Anglia, but in the 11th century was again overrun by the Danes, who in the course of their devastations burnt Cambridge. The first mention of the shire in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records the valiant resistance which it opposed to the invaders in 1010 when the rest of East Anglia had taken ignominious flight. The shire-system of East Anglia was in all probability not definitely settled before the Norman conquest of England, but during the Danish occupation of the 9th century the district possessed a certain military and political organization round Cambridge, its chief town, whence probably originated the constitution and demarcation of the later shire.

== Division of Cambridgeshire ==

At the time of the Domesday Survey the county was divided as now, except that the Isle of Ely, which then formed two hundreds having their meeting-place at Witchford, is now divided into the four hundreds of Ely, Wisbech, North Witchford and South Witchford, while Cambridge formed a hundred by itself. The hundred of Flendish was then known as Flamingdike. Cambridgeshire was formerly included in the diocese of Lincoln. On the creation of the diocese of Ely in 1109, almost the whole county was placed in that diocese. In 1291 the whole county, with the exception of parishes in the deanery of Fordham and diocese of Norwich, constituted the archdeaconry of Ely, comprising the deaneries of Ely, Wisbech, Chesterton, Shingay, Bourn, Barton and Camps.

== Politics ==
The Isle of Ely formerly constituted an independent franchise in which the bishops exercised quasi-palatinate rights, and offences were held to be committed against the bishop&#x27;s peace. These privileges were considerably abridged in the reign of Henry VIII, but the Isle still had separate civil officers, appointed by the bishop, chief among whom were the chief justice, chief bailiff, deputy bailiff and two coroners.

Cambridgeshire has always been remarkable for its lack of county families, and for the frequent changes in the ownership of estates. No Englishmen retained lands of any importance after the Conquest, and at the time of the Domesday Survey the chief lay proprietors were Alan, Earl of Brittany, whose descendants the Zouches retained estates in the county until the 15th century; Picot the sheriff, whose estates passed to the families of Peverell and Peche; Aubrey de Vere, whose descendants retained their estates until the 16th century; and Hardwinus de Scalariis, ancestor of the Scales of Whaddon.

From the time of Hereward&#x27;s famous resistance to William the Conqueror in the fen-district, the Isle of Ely was intimately concerned with the great political struggles of the country. 
* It was defended against King Stephen by Bishop Nigellus of Ely, who fortified Ely and Aldreth, which in 1144 was held for the Empress Matilda by Geoffrey de Mandeville. 
* During the struggles between John and his barons, Faukes de Breaut was made governor of Cambridge Castle, which, however, surrendered to the barons in the same year. 
* The Isle of Ely was seized by the followers of Simon de Montfort in 1266, but in 1267 was taken by Prince Edward. 
* At the Reformation period the county showed much sympathy with the Reformers, and in 1642 the knights, gentry and commoners of Cambridgeshire petitioned for the removal of all unwarrantable orders and dignities, and the banishment of Popish clergy. 
* In the Civil War of the 17th century Cambridgeshire was one of the associated counties in which the King had no visible party, although the University assisted him with contributions of plate and money.

Cambridgeshire returned three members to Parliament in 1290, and in 1295 the county returned two members, the borough of Cambridge two members, and the city of Ely two members, this being the sole return for Ely. The university was summoned to return members in 1300 and again in 1603, but no returns are recorded before 1614, after which it continued to return two members. Under the Reform Act 1832 the county returned three members.

== Economy ==
Cambridgeshire is historically an agricultural county. The Domesday Survey mentions over 90 mills and numerous valuable fisheries, especially eel-fisheries, and contains frequent references to wheat, malt and honey. The county had a flourishing wool-industry in the 14th century, and became noted for its worsted cloths. The Black Death of 1349 and the ravages committed during the Wars of the Roses were followed by periods of severe depression, and in 1439 several Cambridgeshire towns obtained a remission of taxation on the plea of poverty. In the 16th century, barley for malt was grown in large quantities in the south, and the manufacture of willow baskets was carried on in the fen-districts. Saffron was extensively cultivated in the 18th century, and paper was manufactured near Sturbridge. Sturbridge fair was at this period reckoned the largest in Europe, the chief articles of merchandise being wool, hops and leather; and the Newmarket races and horse trade were already famous. Large waste areas were brought under cultivation in the 17th century through the drainage of the fen-district, which was brought to completion about 1652 through the labors of Cornelius Vermuyden, a Dutchman. The coprolite industry was very profitable for a short period from 1850 to 1880, and its decline was accompanied by a general industrial and agricultural depression.

== Antiquities in ecclesiastical architecture ==
Cambridgeshire would be rich only in the possession of the cathedral at Ely and the round church of the Holy Sepulchre, Jesus College and King&#x27;s College chapels, and many other examples in Cambridge. At Thorney, a small town in the north of the county, which owes much in appearance to the 8th Duke of Bedford (d. 1872), the parish church is actually a portion of the church of an abbey said to date originally from the 7th century, and refounded in 972 by Aethelwold, Bishop of Winchester, as a Benedictine monastery. The church is partly fine Norman. Another Norman building of special interest is Sturbridge chapel near Cambridge, which belonged to a lepers&#x27; hospital. To this foundation King John granted a fair, which became, and continued until the 18th century, one of the most important in England. At Swaffham Prior there are remains of two churches in one churchyard, the tower of one being Transitional Norman, while that of the other is Perpendicular, the upper part octagonal. Among many Early English examples St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Cherry Hinton near Cambridge may be mentioned. The churches of Trumpington and Bottisham are examples of the Decorated style; in the first is a famous brass to Sir Roger de Trumpington (1289). As Perpendicular examples the tower and spire of St Mary&#x27;s, Whittlesey, and the wooden roof of Outwell church, may be selected. Monastic remains are scanty. Excluding the city of Cambridge there are no domestic buildings, either ancient or modern, of special note, with the exception of Sawston Hall, in the south of the county, a quadrangular mansion dated 1557–1584.

== Archaeology ==
In Spring 2018, a massive Romano-British coin hoard was discovered by a metal-detectorist in the town of Huntingdon. Designated as the Huntingdon &quot;Muddy&quot; Hoard, it is considered the largest coin hoard in the county, dating to 274 AD during the last days of the Gallic Empire, during the Crisis of the Third Century.

In February 2019, archaeologists from Mola Headland Infrastructure and experts from Highways England found evidence of first Iron Age beer dated back over 2,000 years during road works in Cambridgeshire.

&quot;It’s a well-known fact that ancient populations used the beer-making process to purify water and create a safe source of hydration, but this is potentially the earliest physical evidence of that process taking place in the UK&quot;, said archaeologist Steve Sherlock.

<text>The history of County Durham.

==Roman and pre-Roman==
Remains of Prehistoric Durham include a number of Neolithic earthworks.

The Crawley Edge Cairns and Heathery Burn Cave are Bronze Age sites. Maiden Castle, Durham is an Iron Age site.

Brigantia, the land of the Brigantes, is said to have included what is now County Durham.

There are archaeological remains of Roman Durham. Dere Street and Cade&#x27;s Road run through what is now County Durham. There were Roman forts at Concangis (Chester-le-Street), Lavatrae (Bowes), Longovicium (Lanchester), Piercebridge (Morbium), Vindomora (Ebchester) and Vinovium (Binchester). (The Roman fort at Arbeia (South Shields) is within the former boundaries of County Durham.) A Romanised farmstead has been excavated at Old Durham.

==Anglo-Saxon==
Remains of the Anglo-Saxon period include a number of sculpted stones and sundials, the Legs Cross, the Rey Cross and St Cuthbert&#x27;s coffin.

===Anglian Kingdom of Bernicia===
Around AD 547, an Angle named Ida founded the kingdom of Bernicia after spotting the defensive potential of a large rock at Bamburgh, upon which many a fortification was thenceforth built. Ida was able to forge, hold and consolidate the kingdom; although the native British tried to take back their land, the Angles triumphed and the kingdom endured.

===Kingdom of Northumbria===
In AD 604, Ida&#x27;s grandson Æthelfrith forcibly merged Bernicia (ruled from Bamburgh) and Deira (ruled from York, which was known as Eforwic at the time) to create the Kingdom of Northumbria. In time, the realm was expanded, primarily through warfare and conquest; at its height, the kingdom stretched from the River Humber (from which the kingdom drew its name) to the Forth. Eventually, factional fighting and the rejuvenated strength of neighbouring kingdoms, most notably Mercia, led to Northumbria&#x27;s decline. The arrival of the Vikings hastened this decline, and the Scandinavian raiders eventually claimed the Deiran part of the kingdom in AD 867 (which became Jórvík). The land that would become County Durham now sat on the border with the Great Heathen Army, a border which today still (albeit with some adjustments over the years) forms the boundaries between Yorkshire and County Durham.

Despite their success south of the river Tees, the Vikings never fully conquered the Bernician part of Northumbria, despite the many raids they had carried out on the kingdom. However, Viking control over the Danelaw, the central belt of Anglo-Saxon territory, resulted in Northumbria becoming isolated from the rest of Anglo-Saxon Britain. Scots invasions in the north pushed the kingdom&#x27;s northern boundary back to the River Tweed, and the kingdom found itself reduced to a dependent earldom, its boundaries very close to those of modern-day Northumberland and County Durham. The kingdom was annexed into England in AD 954.

==City of Durham founded==
In AD 995, St Cuthbert&#x27;s community, who had been transporting Cuthbert&#x27;s remains around, partly in an attempt to avoid them falling into the hands of Viking raiders, settled at Dunholm (Durham) on a site that was defensively favourable due to the horseshoe-like path of the River Wear. St Cuthbert&#x27;s remains were placed in a shrine in the White Church, which was originally a wooden structure but was eventually fortified into a stone building.

Once the City of Durham had been founded, the Bishops of Durham gradually acquired the lands that would become County Durham. Bishop Aldhun began this process by procuring land in the Tees and Wear valleys, including Norton, Stockton, Escomb and Aucklandshire in 1018. In 1031, King Canute gave Staindrop to the Bishops. This territory continued to expand, and was eventually given the status of a liberty. Under the control of the Bishops of Durham, the land had various names: the &quot;Liberty of Durham&quot;, &quot;Liberty of St Cuthbert&#x27;s Land&quot; &quot;the lands of St Cuthbert between Tyne and Tees&quot; or &quot;the Liberty of Haliwerfolc&quot; (holy Wear folk).

The bishops&#x27; special jurisdiction rested on claims that King Ecgfrith of Northumbria had granted a substantial territory to St Cuthbert on his election to the see of Lindisfarne in 684. In about 883 a cathedral housing the saint&#x27;s remains was established at Chester-le-Street and Guthfrith, King of York granted the community of St Cuthbert the area between the Tyne and the Wear, before the community reached its final destination in 995, in Durham.

Following the Norman invasion, the administrative machinery of government extended only slowly into northern England. Northumberland&#x27;s first recorded Sheriff was Gilebert from 1076 until 1080 and a 12th-century record records Durham regarded as within the shire. However the bishops disputed the authority of the sheriff of Northumberland and his officials, despite the second sheriff for example being the reputed slayer of Malcolm Canmore, King of Scots. The crown regarded Durham as falling within Northumberland until the late thirteenth century.

==Norman and Anglo-Norman==
Following the Battle of Hastings, William the Conqueror appointed Copsig as Earl of Northumbria, thereby bringing what would become County Durham under Copsig&#x27;s control. Copsig was, just a few weeks later, killed in Newburn. Having already being previously offended by the appointment of a non-Northumbrian as Bishop of Durham in 1042, the people of the region became increasingly rebellious. In response, in January 1069, William despatched a large Norman army, under the command of Robert de Comines, to Durham City. The army, believed to consist of 700 cavalry (about one-third of the number of Norman knights who had participated in the Battle of Hastings), entered the city, whereupon they were attacked, and defeated, by a Northumbrian assault force. The Northumbrians wiped out the entire Norman army, including Comines, all except for one survivor, who was allowed to take the news of this defeat back.

Following the Norman slaughter at the hands of the Northumbrians, resistance to Norman rule spread throughout Northern England, including a similar uprising in York. William The Conqueror subsequently (and successfully) attempted to halt the northern rebellions by unleashing the notorious Harrying of the North (1069–1070). Because William&#x27;s main focus during the harrying was on Yorkshire, County Durham was largely spared the Harrying.

Anglo-Norman Durham refers to the Anglo-Norman period, during which Durham Cathedral was built.

==County Palatine of Durham==


Matters regarding the bishopric of Durham came to a head in 1293 when the bishop and his steward failed to attend proceedings of &quot;quo warranto&quot; held by the justices of Northumberland. The bishop&#x27;s case went before parliament, where he stated that Durham lay outside the bounds of any English shire and that &quot;from time immemorial it had been widely known that the sheriff of Northumberland was not sheriff of Durham nor entered within that liberty as sheriff. . . nor made there proclamations or attachments&quot;. The arguments appear to have prevailed, as by the fourteenth century Durham was accepted as a liberty which received royal mandates direct. In effect it was a private shire, with the bishop appointing his own sheriff. The area eventually became known as the &quot;County Palatine of Durham&quot;.

Sadberge was a liberty, sometimes referred to as a county, within Northumberland. In 1189 it was purchased for the see but continued with a separate sheriff, coroner and court of pleas. In the 14th century Sadberge was included in Stockton ward and was itself divided into two wards. The division into the four wards of Chester-le-Street, Darlington, Easington and Stockton existed in the 13th century, each ward having its own coroner and a three-weekly court corresponding to the hundred court. The diocese was divided into the archdeaconries of Durham and Northumberland. The former is mentioned in 1072, and in 1291 included the deaneries of Chester-le-Street, Auckland, Lanchester and Darlington.

The term &quot;palatinus&quot; is applied to the bishop in 1293, and from the 13th century onwards the bishops frequently claimed the same rights in their lands as the king enjoyed in his kingdom.

==Early administration==
===Boundaries, exclaves and population===

The historic boundaries of County Durham included a main body covering the catchment of the Pennines in the west, the River Tees in the south, the North Sea in the east and the Rivers Tyne and Derwent in the north. The county palatinate also had a number of liberties: the Bedlingtonshire, Islandshire and Norhamshire exclaves within Northumberland, and the Craikshire exclave within the North Riding of Yorkshire. In 1831 the county covered an area of and had a population of 253,910. These exclaves were included as part of the county for parliamentary electoral purposes until 1832, and for judicial and local-government purposes until the coming into force of the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844, which merged most remaining exclaves with their surrounding county. The boundaries of the county proper remained in use for administrative and ceremonial purposes until the Local Government Act 1972.

===Survey===
Boldon Book (1183 or 1184) is a polyptichum for the Bishopric of Durham.

=== Palatinate ===

Until the 15th century, the most important administrative officer in the Palatinate was the steward. Other officers included the sheriff, the coroners, the Chamberlain and the chancellor. The palatine exchequer originated in the 12th century. The palatine assembly represented the whole county, and dealt chiefly with fiscal questions. The bishop&#x27;s council, consisting of the clergy, the sheriff and the barons, regulated judicial affairs, and later produced the Chancery and the courts of Admiralty and Marshalsea.

The prior of Durham ranked first among the bishop&#x27;s barons. He had his own court, and almost exclusive jurisdiction over his men. A UNESCO site describes the role of the Prince-Bishops in Durham, the &quot;buffer state between England and Scotland&quot;:From 1075, the Bishop of Durham became a Prince-Bishop, with the right to raise an army, mint his own coins, and levy taxes. As long as he remained loyal to the king of England, he could govern as a virtually autonomous ruler, reaping the revenue from his territory, but also remaining mindful of his role of protecting England’s northern frontier.

A report states that the Bishops also had the authority to appoint judges and barons and to offer pardons.

There were ten palatinate barons in the 12th century, most importantly the Hyltons of Hylton Castle, the Bulmers of Brancepeth, the Conyers of Sockburne, the Hansards of Evenwood, and the Lumleys of Lumley Castle. The Nevilles owned large estates in the county. John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville de Raby rebuilt Raby Castle, their principal seat, in 1377.

Edward I&#x27;s &quot;quo warranto&quot; proceedings of 1293 showed twelve lords enjoying more or less extensive franchises under the bishop. The repeated efforts of the Crown to check the powers of the palatinate bishops culminated in 1536 in the Act of Resumption, which deprived the bishop of the power to pardon offences against the law or to appoint judicial officers. Moreover, indictments and legal processes were in future to run in the name of the king, and offences to be described as against the peace of the king, rather than that of the bishop. In 1596 restrictions were imposed on the powers of the chancery, and in 1646 the palatinate was formally abolished. It was revived, however, after the Restoration, and continued with much the same power until 5 July 1836, when the Durham (County Palatine) Act 1836 provided that the palatine jurisdiction should in future be vested in the Crown.

=== Wars ===

During the 15th-century Wars of the Roses, Henry VI passed through Durham. On the outbreak of the Great Rebellion in 1642 Durham inclined to support the cause of Parliament, and in 1640 the high sheriff of the palatinate guaranteed to supply the Scottish army with provisions during their stay in the county. In 1642 the Earl of Newcastle formed the western counties into an association for the King&#x27;s service, but in 1644 the palatinate was again overrun by a Scottish army, and after the Battle of Marston Moor (2 July 1644) fell entirely into the hands of Parliament.

===Parliamentary representation and secular powers===
In 1614, a bill was introduced in Parliament for securing representation to the county and city of Durham and the borough of Barnard Castle. The bishop strongly opposed the proposal as an infringement of his palatinate rights, and the county was first summoned to return members to Parliament in 1654. After the Restoration of 1660 the county and city returned two members each. In the wake of the Reform Act 1832 the county returned two members for two divisions, and the boroughs of Gateshead, South Shields and Sunderland acquired representation. The bishops lost their secular powers in 1836. The boroughs of Darlington, Stockton and Hartlepool returned one member each from 1868 until the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885.

==Later government==
The Municipal Corporations Act 1835 reformed the municipal boroughs of Durham, Stockton on Tees and Sunderland. In 1875, Jarrow was incorporated as a municipal borough, as was West Hartlepool in 1887. At a county level, the Local Government Act 1888 reorganised local government throughout England and Wales. Most of the county came under control of the newly formed Durham County Council in an area known as an administrative county. Not included were the county boroughs of Gateshead, South Shields and Sunderland. However, for purposes other than local government, the administrative county of Durham and the county boroughs continued to form a single county to which the Crown appointed a Lord Lieutenant of Durham.

Over its existence, the administrative county lost territory, both to the existing county boroughs, and because two municipal boroughs became county boroughs: West Hartlepool in 1902 and Darlington in 1915. The county boundary with the North Riding of Yorkshire was adjusted in 1967: that part of the town of Barnard Castle historically in Yorkshire was added to County Durham, while the administrative county ceded the portion of the Borough of Stockton-on-Tees in Durham to the North Riding. In 1968, following the recommendation of the Local Government Commission, Billingham was transferred to the County Borough of Teesside, in the North Riding. In 1971, the population of the county—including all associated county boroughs (an area of )—was 1,409,633, with a population outside the county boroughs of 814,396.

In 1974, the Local Government Act 1972 abolished the administrative county and the county boroughs, reconstituting County Durham as a non-metropolitan county. The reconstituted County Durham lost territory to the north-east (around Gateshead, South Shields and Sunderland) to Tyne and Wear and to the south-east (around Hartlepool) to Cleveland. At the same time it gained the former area of Startforth Rural District from the North Riding of Yorkshire. The area of the Lord Lieutenancy of Durham was also adjusted by the Act to coincide with the non-metropolitan county (which occupied in 1981).

In 1996, as part of 1990s UK local government reform by Lieutenancies Act 1997, Cleveland was abolished. Its districts were reconstituted as unitary authorities. Hartlepool and Stockton-on-Tees (north Tees) were returned to the county for the purposes of Lord Lieutenancy. Darlington also became a third unitary authority of the county. The Royal Mail abandoned the use of postal counties altogether, permitted but not mandatory being at a writer wishes.

As part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England initiated by the Department for Communities and Local Government, the seven district councils within the County Council area were abolished. The County Council assumed their functions and became the fourth unitary authority. Changes came into effect on 1 April 2009.

On 15 April 2014, North East Combined Authority was established under the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 with powers over economic development and regeneration. In November 2018, Newcastle City Council, North Tyneside Borough Council, and Northumberland County Council left the authority. These later formed the North of Tyne Combined Authority.

In May 2021, four parish councils of the villages of Elwick, Hart, Dalton Piercy and Greatham all issued individual votes of no confidence in Hartlepool Borough Council, and expressed their desire to join the County Durham district.

In October 2021, County Durham was shortlisted for the UK City of Culture 2025. In May 2022, it lost to Bradford.

==Eighteenth century==
Eighteenth century Durham saw the appearance of dissent in the county and the Durham Ox. The county did not assist the Jacobite Rebellion of 1715. The Statue of Neptune in the City of Durham was erected in 1729.

==Nineteenth century==
A number of disasters happened in Nineteenth century Durham. The Felling mine disasters happened in 1812, 1813, 1821 and 1847. The Philadelphia train accident happened in 1815. In 1854, there was a great fire in Gateshead. One of the West Stanley Pit disasters happened in 1882. The Victoria Hall disaster happened in 1883.

==Twentieth century==
One of the West Stanley Pit disasters happened in 1909. The Darlington rail crash happened in 1928. The Battle of Stockton happened in 1933. The Browney rail crash happened in 1946.

==Political history==
The First Treaty of Durham was made at Durham in 1136. The Second Treaty of Durham was made at Durham in 1139.

==Military and naval history==
The county regiment was the Durham Light Infantry, which replaced, in particular, the 68th (Durham) Regiment of Foot (Light Infantry) and the Militia and Volunteers of County Durham.

RAF Greatham, RAF Middleton St George and RAF Usworth were located in County Durham.

David I, the King of Scotland, invaded the county in 1136, and ravaged much of the county 1138. In 17 October 1346, the Battle of Neville&#x27;s Cross was fought at Neville&#x27;s Cross, near the city of Durham. On 16 December 1914, during the First World War, there was a raid on Hartlepool by the Imperial German Navy.

==Ecclesiastical history==
Chroniclers connected with Durham include the Bede, Symeon of Durham, Geoffrey of Coldingham and Robert de Graystanes.

==Economic history==
County Durham has long been associated with coal mining, from medieval times up to the late 20th century. The Durham Coalfield covered a large area of the county, from Bishop Auckland, to Consett, to the River Tyne and below the North Sea, thereby providing a significant expanse of territory from which this rich mineral resource could be extracted.
King Stephen possessed a mine in Durham, which he granted to Bishop Pudsey, and in the same century colliers are mentioned at Coundon, Bishopwearmouth and Sedgefield. Cockfield Fell was one of the earliest Landsale collieries in Durham. Edward III issued an order allowing coal dug at Newcastle to be taken across the Tyne, and Richard II granted to the inhabitants of Durham licence to export the produce of the mines, without paying dues to the corporation of Newcastle. The majority was transported from the Port of Sunderland complex, which was constructed in the 1850s.

Among other early industries, lead-mining was carried on in the western part of the county, and mustard was extensively cultivated. Gateshead had a considerable tanning trade and shipbuilding was undertaken at Jarrow, and at Sunderland, which became the largest shipbuilding town in the world – constructing a third of Britain&#x27;s tonnage.

The county&#x27;s modern-era economic history was facilitated significantly by the growth of the mining industry during the nineteenth century. At the industry&#x27;s height, in the early 20th century, over 170,000 coal miners were employed, and they mined 58,700,000 tons of coal in 1913 alone. As a result, a large number of colliery villages were built throughout the county as the Industrial Revolution gathered pace.

The railway industry was also a major employer during the industrial revolution, with railways being built throughout the county, such as The Tanfield Railway, The Clarence Railway and The Stockton and Darlington Railway. The growth of this industry occurred alongside the coal industry, as the railways provided a fast, efficient means to move coal from the mines to the ports and provided the fuel for the locomotives. The great railway pioneers Timothy Hackworth, Edward Pease, George Stephenson and Robert Stephenson were all actively involved with developing the railways in tandem with County Durham&#x27;s coal mining industry. Shildon and Darlington became thriving &#x27;railway towns&#x27; and experienced significant growths in population and prosperity; before the railways, just over 100 people lived in Shildon but, by the 1890s, the town was home to around 8,000 people, with Shildon Shops employing almost 3000 people at its height.

However, by the 1930s, the coal mining industry began to diminish and, by the mid-twentieth century, the pits were closing at an increasing rate. In 1951, the Durham County Development Plan highlighted a number of colliery villages, such as Blackhouse, as &#x27;Category D&#x27; settlements, in which future development would be prohibited, property would be acquired and demolished, and the population moved to new housing, such as that being built in Newton Aycliffe. Likewise, the railway industry also began to decline, and was significantly brought to a fraction of its former self by the Beeching cuts in the 1960s. Darlington Works closed in 1966 and Shildon Shops followed suit in 1984. The county&#x27;s last deep mines, at Easington, Vane Tempest, Wearmouth and Westoe, closed in 1993.

==Post markings==
Postal Rates from 1801 were charged depending on the distance from London. Durham was allocated the code 263 the approximate mileage from London. From about 1811, a datestamp appeared on letters showing the date the letter was posted. In 1844 a new system was introduced and Durham was allocated the code 267. This system was replaced in 1840 when the first postage stamps were introduced.

==Antiquities==

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition (1911): &quot;To the Anglo-Saxon period are to be referred portions of the churches of Monk Wearmouth (Sunderland), Jarrow, Escomb near Bishop Auckland, and numerous sculptured crosses, two of which are in situ at Aycliffe. . . . The Decorated and Perpendicular periods are very scantily represented, on account, as is supposed, of the incessant wars between England and Scotland in the 14th and 15th centuries. The principal monastic remains, besides those surrounding Durham cathedral, are those of its subordinate house or &quot;cell,&quot; Finchale Priory, beautifully situated by the Wear. The most interesting castles are those of Durham, Raby, Brancepeth and Barnard. There are ruins of castelets or peel-towers at Dalden, Ludworth and Langley Dale. The hospitals of Sherburn, Greatham and Kepyer, founded by early bishops of Durham, retain but few ancient features.&quot;

The best remains of the Norman period include Durham Cathedral and Durham Castle, and several parish churches, such as St Laurence Church in Pittington. The Early English period has left the eastern portion of the cathedral, the churches of Darlington, Hartlepool, and St Andrew, Auckland, Sedgefield, and portions of a few other churches.

&#x27;Durham Castle and Cathedral&#x27; is a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site. Elsewhere in the County there is Auckland Castle.

==Museums==

Museums include North of England Lead Mining Museum, Beamish Museum, Bowes Museum, Head of Steam and the National Museum of the Royal Navy, Hartlepool.

<doc id="1291378" wikidata="Q5864683" url="?curid=1291378" title="History of Gloucestershire">
<text>The region now known as Gloucestershire was originally inhabited by Brythonic peoples (ancestors of the Welsh and English and other Romano-British 
peoples) in the Iron Age and Roman periods. After the Romans left Britain in the early 5th century, the Brythons re-established control but the territorial divisions for the post-Roman period are uncertain. The city of Caerloyw (Gloucester today, still known as &quot;Caerloyw&quot; in modern Welsh) was one centre and Cirencester may have continued as a tribal centre as well. The only reliably attested kingdom is the minor south-east Wales kingdom of Ergyng, which may have included a portion of the area (roughly the Forest of Dean). In the final quarter of the 6th century, the Saxons of Wessex began to establish control over the area.

The English conquest of the Severn valley began in 577 with the victory of Ceawlin at Deorham, followed by the capture of Cirencester, Gloucester and Bath. The Hwiccas who occupied the district were a West Saxon tribe, but their territory had become a dependency of Mercia in the 7th century, and was not brought under West Saxon dominion until the 9th century. No important settlements were made by the Danes in the district. Gloucestershire probably originated as a shire in the 10th century, and is mentioned by name in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; in 1016. Towards the close of the 11th century, the boundaries were readjusted to include Winchcombeshire, previously a county by itself, and at the same time the forest district between the Wye and the Severn was added to Gloucestershire. The divisions of the county for a long time remained very unsettled, and the thirty-nine hundreds mentioned in the Domesday Survey and the thirty-one hundreds of the Hundred Rolls of 1274 differ very widely in name and extent both from each other and from the twenty-eight hundreds of the present day.

==Military significance==
Gloucestershire formed part of Harold&#x27;s earldom at the time of the Norman Conquest of England, but it offered slight resistance to William the Conqueror.

During The Anarchy, Empress Matilda was supported by her half brother, Robert of Gloucester, who had rebuilt Bristol Castle. The castles at Gloucester and Cirencester were garrisoned on her behalf. Beverston Castle was also a site of the conflict.

During 13th century Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany was imprisoned for quite some time in Gloucester Castle and Bristol Castle, both were considered strongest among England castles.

In the barons&#x27; war of the reign of Henry III, Gloucester was garrisoned for Simon de Montfort, but was captured by Prince Edward in 1265, in which year de Montfort was slain at the Battle of Evesham.

Bristol and Gloucester actively supported the Yorkist cause during the Wars of the Roses.

In the religious struggles of the 16th century Gloucester showed strong Protestant sympathy, and in the reign of Mary, Bishop Hooper was sent to Gloucester to be burnt as a warning to the county.

The same Puritan leanings induced the county to support the Parliamentary cause in the civil war of the 17th century. In 1643 Bristol and Cirencester were captured by the Royalists, but the latter was recovered in the same year and Bristol in 1645. Two Civil War battles were fought at Beverston Castle, and Parliament ordered its battlements destroyed to deprive the Royalists use of the fortress. Gloucester was garrisoned for the Parliament throughout the struggle.

==Land partition==

On the subdivision of the Mercian diocese in 680 the greater part of modern Gloucestershire was included in the diocese of Worcester, and shortly after the Conquest constituted the archdeaconry of Gloucester, which in 1290 comprised the deaneries of Campden, Stow, Cirencester, Fairford, Winchcombe, Stonehouse, Hawkesbury, Bitton, Bristol, Dursley and Gloucester. The district west of the Severn, with the exception of a few parishes in the deaneries of Ross and Staunton, constituted the deanery of the forest within the archdeaconry and diocese of Hereford. In 1535 the deanery of Bitton had been absorbed in that of Hawkesbury. In 1541 the diocese of Gloucester was created, its boundaries being identical with those of the county. On the erection of Bristol to a see in 1542 the deanery of Bristol was transferred from Gloucester to that diocese. In 1836 the sees of Gloucester and Bristol were united; the archdeaconry of Bristol was created out of the deaneries of Bristol, Cirencester, Fairford and Hawkesbury; and the deanery of the forest was transferred to the archdeaconry of Gloucester. In 1882 the archdeaconry of Cirencester was constituted to include the deaneries of Campden, Stow, Northleach north and south, Fairford and Cirencester. In 1897 the diocese of Bristol was recreated, and included the deaneries of Bristol, Stapleton and Bitton.

After the Conquest very extensive lands and privileges in the county were acquired by the church, the Cirencester Abbey alone holding seven hundreds at fee-farm, and the estates of the principal lay-tenants were for the most part outlying parcels of baronies having their caput in other counties. The large estates held by William Fitz Osbern, Earl of Hereford, escheated to the crown on the rebellion of his son Earl Roger in 1074. The Berkeleys have held lands in Gloucestershire from the time of the Domesday Survey, and the families of Basset, Tracy, Clifton, Dennis and Poyntz have figured prominently in the annals of the county. Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, and Richard of Cornwall claimed extensive lands and privileges in the shire in the 13th century, and Simon de Montfort owned Minsterworth and Rodley.

==Politics==

Bristol was made a county in 1373, and in 1483 Richard III created Gloucester as an independent county, adding to it the hundreds of Dudston and Kings Barton. The latter were reunited to Gloucestershire in 1673, but the cities of Bristol and Gloucester continued to rank as independent counties, with separate jurisdiction, county rate and assizes. The chief officer of the Forest of Dean was the warden, who was generally also constable of St Briavel Castle. The first justice-seat for the forest was held at Gloucester Castle in 1282, the last in 1635.

Gloucestershire was first represented in Parliament in 1290, when it returned two members. Bristol and Gloucester acquired representation in 1295, Cirencester in 1572 and Tewkesbury in 1620. Under the Reform Act 1832 the county returned four members in two divisions; Bristol, Gloucester, Cirencester, Stroud and Tewkesbury returned two members each, and Cheltenham returned one member. The act of Parliament of 1868 reduced the representation of Cirencester and Tewkesbury to one member each.

==Economy==
The physical characteristics of the three natural divisions of Gloucestershire have given rise in each to a special industry. The forest district, until the development of the Sussex mines in the 16th century, was the chief iron producing area of the kingdom, the mines having been worked in Roman times, while the abundance of timber gave rise to numerous tanneries and to an important shipbuilding trade. The hill district, besides fostering agricultural pursuits, gradually absorbed the woollen trade from the big towns, which now devoted themselves almost entirely to foreign commerce. Silkweaving was introduced in the 17th century, and was especially prosperous in the Stroud valley. The abundance of clay and building-stone in the county gave rise to considerable manufactures of brick, tiles and pottery. Numerous minor industries sprang up in the 17th and 18th centuries, such as flax-growing and the manufacture of pins, buttons, lace, stockings, rope and sailcloth.

==Relics==
Gloucester Cathedral and Bristol Cathedral, Tewkesbury Abbey, and the Church of St. John the Baptist in Cirencester with its great Perpendicular porch, are historic buildings of Gloucestershire. Of the abbey of Hailes near Winchcomb, founded by Richard, Earl of Cornwall, in 1246, little more than the foundations are left, but these have been excavated with great care, and interesting fragments have been brought to light.

Most of the old market towns have line parish churches. At Deerhurst near Tewkesbury, and Cleeve near Cheltenham, there are churches of special interest on account of the pre-Norman work they retain. The Perpendicular church at Lechlade is unusually perfect; and that at Fairford was built (c. 1500), according to tradition, to contain the remarkable series of stained glass windows which are said to have been brought from the Netherlands. These are, however, adjudged to be of English workmanship, and are one of the finest series in the country. The castle at Berkeley is a splendid example of a feudal stronghold. Thornbury Castle, in the same district, is a fine Tudor ruin, the pretensions of which evoked the jealousy of Cardinal Wolsey against its builder, Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, who was beheaded in 1521. Near Cheltenham is the fine 15th-century mansion of Southam de la Bere, of timber and stone.

Memorials of the de la Bere family appear in the church at Cleeve. The mansion contains a tiled floor from Hailes Abbey. Near Winchcomb is Sudeley Castle, dating from the 15th century, but the inhabited portion is chiefly Elizabethan. The chapel is the burial place of Queen Catherine Parr. At Great Badminton is the mansion and vast domain of the Beauforts (formerly of the Botelers and others), on the south-eastern boundary of the county.

<doc id="1291381" wikidata="Q1017691" url="?curid=1291381" title="Cold Lake, Alberta">
<text>Cold Lake is a city in east-northern Alberta, Canada and is named after the lake nearby. Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake (CFB Cold Lake) is situated within the city&#x27;s outer limits.

== History ==
Cold Lake was first recorded on a 1790 map, by the name of Coldwater Lake. Originally three communities, Cold Lake was formed by merging the Town of Grand Centre, the Town of Cold Lake, and Medley (CFB Cold Lake) on October 1, 1996. Grand Centre was renamed Cold Lake South, and the original Cold Lake is known as Cold Lake North. Because of its origins, the area is also known as the Tri-Town.

== Fossil record ==
Cold Lake preserves an extensive fossil and subfossil record from the Pleistocene after the Last Glacial Maximum to the Late Holocene. By the Middle Holocene, the mammalian biota in the region was essentially modern.

== Geography ==
The city is situated in Alberta&#x27;s &quot;Lakeland&quot; district, northeast of Edmonton, near the Alberta-Saskatchewan provincial border. The area surrounding the city is sparsely populated, and consists mostly of farmland.

=== Climate ===
Cold Lake&#x27;s climate is humid continental (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;). Summers are generally warm with cool nights, and winters are very cold with moderate snowfall.

== Demographics ==

The population of the City of Cold Lake according to its 2022 municipal census is 16,302, a change of from its 2014 municipal census population of 15.736.

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the City of Cold Lake had a population of 15,661 living in 6,114 of its 6,767 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 14,976. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

In the Canada 2016 census conducted by Statistics Canada, the City of Cold Lake had a population of 14,961 living in 5,597 of its 6,657 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 13,839. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.

== Economy ==
The city&#x27;s economy is inextricably linked to military spending at CFB Cold Lake. The region also supports oil and gas exploration and production. The Athabasca Oil Sands project in Fort McMurray is having a growing influence in the region as well. The Cold Lake oil sands may become a significant contributor to the local economy.

A job market analysis from December 2024 to January 2025 showed that the Oil &amp; Gas sector accounted for 33% of job postings in the region, with administrative roles and skilled trades also in high demand.

Every year Cold Lake hosts military forces from around the world for Exercise Maple Flag, a training exercise where pilots and support staff of NATO allies can take advantage of the Air Weapons Range and relatively open rural air space. Running from 4 to 6 weeks and starting in May of each year, commercial accommodations in the entire region are left with little to no vacancy. This annual exercise contributes a substantial amount of capital into these industries and other hospitality-related businesses.

<doc id="1291382" wikidata="Q6859783" url="?curid=1291382" title="Million Franc Race">
<text>The Million Franc Race, or , was an effort in 1937 by the French Popular Front to induce French automobile manufacturers to develop race cars capable of competing with the incredibly advanced German Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union racers of the time, which were backed by the Nazi government in a (largely successful) attempt to dominate the sport, to &quot;prove the superiority of the Aryan race&quot;. The prize money was a million francs, and to ensure that the competition tested each car&#x27;s ultimate limits, rather than just the driver&#x27;s skill in passing other drivers, the race was a time trial against the clock at the treacherous Autodrome de Montlhéry track, which had taken the life of the great Antonio Ascari.

Each car had to drive sixteen laps () at an average speed of at least from a standing start. René Dreyfus was hired by Lucy O&#x27;Reilly Schell&#x27;s Écurie Bleue team to drive a Delahaye 145 in testing and in the competition itself in which he risked death by setting a literally-blistering pace, wearing the special Dunlop tires down to the fabric but handily overwhelming all competitors except the Bugatti team. On the last day of the competition, the Bugatti entry, driven by Jean-Pierre Wimille, arrived. After spending most of the day repairing various mechanical problems, the Bugatti took to the track for its run towards sundown, accompanied by Dreyfus in the Delahaye in an attempt to protect his incipient victory. The two drivers pushed each other to incredible speed until the Bugatti once again broke under the strain, ensuring Delahaye the prize.

The victorious Delahaye 145, known as the &quot;Million Franc Delahaye&quot;, was driven by Dreyfus in 1938 at the Pau Grand Prix, a tight circuit running through village streets, where he beat the legendary Rudolf Caracciola and his all-conquering Silver Arrow, becoming a national hero in France.

One story tells us that when the Germans seized control of France during World War II, the &quot;Million Franc Delahaye&quot; was disassembled and hidden by sentimental French patriots to prevent it from falling into German hands, and its later whereabouts became unknown.

However, the fact is that Lucy O&#x27;Reilly Schell retained ownership of 48771, and her other four V12 engined racecars. She did not allow any &quot;sentimental patriots&quot; permission to dismantle and hide the car. Instead, she consigned it, and the other V12 racers, with The Wilson Garage&#x27;s proprietor/owner Fernand Lacour, to be liquidated. Despite 48771 being advertised for sale, in mid 1938, not a single &quot;sentimental patriot&quot; expressed interest in buying it. Lacour secured storage for it in the south of France, near Lucy&#x27;s new family home in neutral Monaco. The car was sold in 1945 to an unknown Nazi sympathizer, who commissioned Franay to design and build a low-slung attractive roadster body on the old Type 145 chassis. He vanished without paying Franay, who managed to have the car seized. Franay bought it at auction. Since then, two different cars have surfaced with credible claims to be the &quot;Million Franc Delahaye&quot;, with two different collectors (Peter Mullin in 1987 for the Mullin Automotive Museum and/or Sam Mann) both claiming the privilege of owning this unique piece of automotive history.

<doc id="1291391" wikidata="Q5866503" url="?curid=1291391" title="History of Shropshire">
<text>Shropshire was established during the division of Saxon Mercia into shires in the 10th century. It is first mentioned in 1006. After the Norman Conquest it experienced significant development, following the granting of the principal estates of the county to eminent Normans, such as Roger De Montgomery and his son Robert de Bellême.

The Coalbrookdale area of the county is designated &quot;the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution&quot;, due to significant technological developments that happened there.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name &quot;Shropshire&quot; is the Old English &quot;Scrobbesbyrigscīr&quot; (literally &quot;Shrewsburyshire&quot;), perhaps taking its name from Richard Scrob (or FitzScrob or Scrope), the builder of Richard&#x27;s Castle near what is now the town of Ludlow. However, the Normans who ruled England after 1066 found both &quot;Scrobbesbyrig&quot; and &quot;Scrobbesbyrigscir&quot; difficult to pronounce so they softened them to &quot;Salopesberia&quot; and &quot;Salopescira&quot;. Salop is the abbreviation of these.

When a council for the county was set up in 1888, it was called &quot;Salop County Council&quot;. The name was never popular, with Ludlow MP Sir Jasper More raising an amendment to the 1972 Local Government Bill to rename the county &quot;Shropshire&quot; – at the time the council itself opposed the change, although later, in 1980, would exercise its power to legally change the name of the county.

&quot;The Times&quot; noted in a 19 February 1980 article about the name change that &quot;there was no record of why the name Salop County Council was adopted&quot;. The decision to make the change was taken on 1 March 1980, at a special meeting of the council, with 48 votes in favour versus five against. It came into effect on 1 April.

Another reason why Salop was unfavourable was the fact that if you add the letter &#x27;E&#x27; and make it Salope, this is a French word which means &#x27;Bitch&#x27; or &#x27;Loose Woman&#x27;.

The term &quot;Salopian&quot;, derived from &quot;Salop&quot;, is still used to mean &quot;from Shropshire&quot;. 
Salop can also mean the county town, Shrewsbury, and in historical records Shropshire is described as &quot;the county of Salop&quot; and Shrewsbury as &quot;the town of Salop&quot;. There is a reference in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (1948) to Shropshire being called Sloppesbury, and this name being shortened to Salop.

The Latin motto of &quot;Floreat Salopia&quot; (may Shropshire flourish) was originally used by the borough of Shrewsbury, and was adopted in 1896 by Salop (or Shropshire) County Council when they received a grant of a coat of arms. The motto is now used in a number of other emblems associated with the county.

==County extent==

The border with Wales was defined in the first half of the 16th century – the hundreds of Oswestry (including Oswestry) and Pimhill (including Wem), and part of Chirbury had prior to the Laws in Wales Act formed various Lordships in the Welsh Marches. Clun hundred went briefly to Montgomeryshire at its creation in 1536, but was returned to Shropshire in 1546.

The present day ceremonial county boundary is almost the same as the historic county&#x27;s. Notably there has been the removal of several exclaves and enclaves. The largest of the exclaves was Halesowen, which became part of Worcestershire in 1844 (now part of the West Midlands county), and the largest of the enclaves was Herefordshire&#x27;s Farlow in south Shropshire, also transferred in 1844, to Shropshire. Alterations have been made on Shropshire&#x27;s border with all neighbouring English counties over the centuries. Gains have been made to the south of Ludlow (the parish of Ludford from Herefordshire), to the north of Shifnal (part of Sheriffhales parish from Staffordshire) and to the north (the hamlet of Tittenley from Cheshire) and south (from Staffordshire) of Market Drayton. The county has lost minor tracts of land in a few places, notably north of Tenbury Wells to Worcestershire, and near Leintwardine to Herefordshire.

==Romano-British Period==
===Cornovii Tribe===
The entire area of modern Shropshire was included within the territory of the Celtic Cornovii tribe, whose capital was the Wrekin hill fort.

===Roman Rule===
After Roman military expansion into the area in 47 AD, the tribal territory was reorganised as a Roman Civitas and the capital was relocated to Viroconium.

===Pengwern &amp; Powys===
Following the collapse of the Romano-British administration, the Cornovii territory may have become part of the Kingdom of Powys, but its status is obscure. Twelfth century Welsh historian Giraldus Cambrensis associated Pengwern with Shrewsbury, but its location is uncertain.

==Integration with Mercia to 1066==

===The Saxon Kingdom of Mercia===
The northern part of Shropshire was part of the territory of the Wreocensæte. The southern part probably belonged to the Magonsaete. Both were absorbed by the Saxon Kingdom of Mercia by King Offa. In 765 he constructed Watt&#x27;s Dyke to defend his territory against the Welsh, and in 779, having pushed across the River Severn, drove the Welsh King of Powys from Shrewsbury, he secured his conquests by a second defensive earthwork known as Offa&#x27;s Dyke. (This enters Shropshire at Knighton, traverses moor and mountain by Llanymynech and Oswestry, in many places forming the boundary line of the county, and finally leaves it at Bronygarth and enters Denbighshire.)

===Danish invasions===
In the 9th and 10th centuries the district was frequently overrun by the Danes, who in 874 destroyed the famous priory of Wenlock, said to have been founded by St Milburga, granddaughter of King Penda of Mercia, and in 896 wintered at Quatford. In 912 Ethelfleda, the Lady of Mercia, erected a fortress at Bridgnorth against the Danish invaders, and in the following year she erected another at Chirbury.

===The establishment of Shropshire===
Mercia was mapped out into shires in the 10th century after its recovery from the Danes by Edward the Elder. The first mention of &quot;Shropshire&quot; in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; occurs under 1006, when the King crossed the Thames and wintered there. In 1016 Edmund Ætheling plundered Shrewsbury and the neighbourhood.

In 963 AD two towns are described in east Shropshire. These have now been identified as Newport, Plesc was described as having a High street, a stone quarry and a religious community. The name Plesc means fortified place or one with palisade, denoting it was of some importance.

Thirteen years before the Norman Conquest, the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; relates that in 1053 the Welshmen slew a great many of the English wardens at Westbury, and in that year Harold ordered that any Welshman found beyond Offa&#x27;s Dyke within the English pale should have his right hand cut off.

Earl Godwin, Sweyn, Harold, Queen Edith, Edward the Confessor and Edwin and Morcar are all mentioned in the Domesday Survey as having held lands in the county shortly before or during the Norman Conquest.

==1066 to the late Middle Ages==

===Norman Conquest===

After the Norman Conquest of 1066 the principal estates in Shropshire were all bestowed on Norman proprietors, pre-eminent among whom is Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, whose son Robert de Bellesme forfeited his possessions for rebelling against Henry I, when the latter bestowed the Earldom on his Queen Matilda for life.

The principal landholders at the time of the Domesday Survey were the Bishop of Chester, the Bishop of Hereford, the church of St Remigius, Earl Roger, Osbern Fitz-Richard, Ralph de Mortimer, Roger de Laci, Hugh Lasne and Nicholas Medicus. Earl Roger had the whole profits of Condover hundred and also owned Alnodestreu hundred. The family of Fitz-Alan, ancestors of the royal family of Stuart, had supreme jurisdiction in Oswestry hundred, which was exempt from English law.

Richard Fitz-Scrob, father of Osbern Fitz-Richard and founder of Richard&#x27;s Castle, was lord of the hundred of Overs at the time of the Conquest. Gatacre was the seat of the Gatacres. The barony of Pulverbatch passed from the Pulverbatches, and was purchased in 1193 by John de Kilpeck for £100. The Lands of Wrentnall (Ernui and Chetel before the conquest) and Great Lyth were amalgamated under The Barony of Pulverbatch (devolved over the centuries to Condover, held by various families and now, Wrentnall and Great Lyth Manorial rights belong to the present Lord of the Manors of Wrentnall and Great Lyth, also the Baron of Pulverbatch). {Farrow, M. MA Cantab, 7 April 2003, Barony of Pulverbatch, Lordships of Great Lyth and Wrentnall}.
The family of Cornwall were barons of Burford and of Harley for many centuries. The family of Le Strange owned large estates in Shropshire after the Conquest, and Fulk Lestrange claimed the right of holding pleas of the crown in Wrockworthyn in 1292.

Among others claiming rights of jurisdiction in their Shropshire estates in the same year were Edmund de Mortimer, the abbot of Combermere, the prior of Llanthony, the prior of Great Malvern, the Bishop of Lichfield, Peter Corbett, Nicholas of Audley, the abbot of Lilleshall, John of Mortayn, Richard Fitz-Alan, the bishop of Hereford and the prior of Wenlock.

===Castles===

The constant necessity of defending their territories against the Welsh prompted the Norman lords of Shropshire to such activity in castle-building that out of 186 castles in England no less than 32 are in this county. Shropshire became a key area within the Welsh Marches. Of the castles built in this period the most famous are Ludlow, founded by Walter de Lacy; Bishop&#x27;s Castle, which belonged to the Bishops of Hereford; Clun Castle, built by the FitzAlans; Cleobury Castle, built by Hugh de Mortimer; Caus Castle, once the Barony of Sir Peter Corbet, from whom it came to the Barons Strafford; Rowton Castle, also a seat of the Corbets; Red Castle, a seat of the Audleys. Other castles were Bridgnorth, Corfham, Holdgate, Newport, Pulverbatch, Quatford, Shrewsbury and Wem.

===Forests===
At this period a very large portion of Shropshire was covered by forests, the largest of which, Morfe Forest, at its origin extended at least 8 miles in length and 6 miles in width, and became a favorite hunting-ground of the English Kings. The forest of Wrekin, or &#x27;Mount Gilbert&#x27; as it was then called, covered the whole of that hill and extended eastward as far as Sheriffhales. Other forests were Stiperstones, the jurisdiction of which was from time immemorial annexed to the Barony of Caus, Wyre, Shirlot, Clee, Long Forest and Brewood.

===Welsh Marches===
The early political history of Shropshire is largely concerned with the constant incursions and depredations of the Welsh from across the border. Various statutory measures to keep the Welsh in check were enforced in the 14th and 15th centuries.
In 1379 Welshmen were forbidden to purchase land in the county save on certain conditions, and this enactment was reinforced in 1400. In 1379 the men of Shropshire forwarded to parliament a complaint of the felonies committed by the men of Cheshire and of the Welsh marches, and declared the gaol of Shrewsbury Castle to be in such a ruinous condition that they had no place of imprisonment for the offenders when captured. In 1442 and again as late as 1535 acts were passed for the protection of Shropshire against the Welsh.

===Medieval national affairs===
Apart from the border warfare in which they were constantly engaged, the great Shropshire lords were actively concerned in the more national struggles. Shrewsbury Castle was garrisoned for the empress Maud by William Fitz-Alan in 1138, but was captured by King Stephen in the same year. Holgate Castle was taken by King John from Thomas Mauduit, one of the rebellious barons.
Ludlow and Shrewsbury were both held for a time by Simon de Montfort. At Acton Burnell in 1283 was held the parliament which passed the famous Statute of Acton Burnell, and a parliament was summoned to meet at Shrewsbury in 1398.

During the Percy rebellion Shrewsbury was in 1403 the site of a battle between the Lancastrian Henry IV, and Henry Percy (&#x27;Harry Hotspur&#x27;) of Northumberland. The Battle of Shrewsbury was fought on 21 July 1403, at what is now Battlefield, just to the north of present-day Shrewsbury town. The battle resulted in the death of Henry Percy, and a victory to King Henry IV, who established a chapel at the site to commemorate the fallen.

===Religious foundations===

Among the Norman religious foundations were:

*the Cluniac priory of Wenlock, at Much Wenlock, re-established on the Saxon foundation by Roger Montgomery in 1080
*the Augustinian Haughmond Abbey founded by William Fitz-Alan
*the Cistercian Buildwas Abbey, now a magnificent ruin, founded in 1135 by Roger de Clinton, Bishop of Chester
*the Benedictine Shrewsbury Abbey, founded in 1083 by Roger de Montgomerie
*the Augustinian Lilleshall Abbey, founded in the reign of Stephen
*the Augustinian Wombridge Priory, founded before the reign of King Henry I
*the Benedictine priory of Alberbury founded by Fulk FitzWarin in the 13th century
*and the Augustinian Chirbury Priory founded in the 13th century.

===Hundreds===
Hundreds in England had various judicial, fiscal and other local government functions, their importance gradually declining from the end of manorialism to the latter part of the 19th century.

The fifteen Shropshire hundreds mentioned in the Domesday Survey were entirely rearranged in the 12th century, particularly during the 1100-1135 reign of King Henry I, and only Overs, Shrewsbury and Condover retained their original names.

The Domesday hundred of Reweset was replaced by Ford, and the hundred court transferred from Alberbury to Ford. Hodnet was the meeting-place of the Domesday hundred of Hodnet, which was combined with Wrockwardine hundred, the largest of the Domesday hundreds, to form the very large hundred of Bradford, the latter also including part of the Domesday hundred of Pinholle in Staffordshire. The hundred of Baschurch had its meeting-place at Baschurch in the time of Edward the Confessor; in the reign of Henry I it was represented mainly by the hundred of Pimhill, the meeting-place of which was at Pimhill. Oswestry came to represent the Domesday hundred of Merset, the hundred court of which was transferred from Maesbury to Oswestry. The Domesday hundred of Alnodestreu, abolished in the reign of King Henry I, had its meeting-place at Membrefeld (Morville). It was effectively succeeded by Brimstree.

The Domesday-era hundreds of Culvestan and Patton, which following the Norman conquest shared their &quot;caput&quot; at Corfham Castle, were amalgamated into a new hundred of Munslow in the reign of Henry I. Later, in the 1189-1199 reign of Richard I, a large portion was taken out of Munslow to form a new hundred-like liberty for the priory of Wenlock, which became known as the franchise (or liberty) of Wenlock, and further manors were added to this &#x27;franchise&#x27; in the coming centuries. The hundred of Wittery effectively became Chirbury.

Leintwardine was divided amongst various hundreds, largely the new Herefordshire hundred of Wigmore and the new Shropshire hundred of Purslow (created also from Rinlau), with some manors going towards the new Munslow. The Domesday-era hundred of Conditre formed the basis for the large Stottesdon hundred, which took in manors from Overs and Alnodestreu, and resulted in Overs being divided into two detached parts. Stottesdon also brought across manors from the Staffordshire hundred of Seisdon. Clun hundred was formed upon the ending of the Marcher lordship there; it formed part of Montgomeryshire (and therefore Wales) in 1536, but was brought into Shropshire already in 1546.

Although never formally abolished, the hundreds of England have become obsolete. They lost their remaining administrative and judicial functions in the mid-to-late 19th century, with the last aspects removed from them in 1895 with the Local Government Act 1894.

===Administration===
Shropshire was administered by a high sheriff, at least from the time of the Norman Conquest, the first Norman sheriff being Warin the Bald, whose successor was Rainald, and in 1156 the office was held by William Fitzalan, whose account of the fee farm of the county is entered in the pipe roll for that year (see list at High Sheriff of Shropshire). The shire court was held at Shrewsbury. A considerable portion of Shropshire was included in the Welsh Marches, the court for the administration of which was held at Ludlow. In 1397 the castle of Oswestry with the hundred and eleven towns pertaining thereto, the castle of Isabel with the lordship pertaining thereto, and the castle of Dalaley, were annexed to the principality of Chester. By the statute of 1535 for the abolition of the Welsh Marches, the lordships of Oswestry, Whittington, Maesbrooke and Knockin were formed into the hundred of Oswestry; the lordship of Ellesmere was joined to the hundred of Pimhill; and the lordship of Down to the hundred of Chirbury.

The boundaries of Shropshire have otherwise varied little since the Domesday Book survey. Richard&#x27;s Castle and Ludford, however were then included in the Herefordshire hundred of Cutestornes, while several manors now in Herefordshire were assessed under Shropshire. The Shropshire manors of Kings Nordley, Alveley, Claverley and Worfield were assessed in the Domesday hundred of Saisdon in Staffordshire; and Quatt, Romsley, Rudge and Shipley appear under the Warwickshire hundred of Stanlei.

===Ecclesiastical organisation===
Shropshire in the 13th century was situated almost entirely in the diocese of Hereford and diocese of Coventry and Lichfield; forming the archdeaconries of Shropshire and Salop. That portion of the county in the Hereford diocese, the archdeaconry of Shropshire, included the deaneries of Burford, Stottesdon, Ludlow, Pontesbury, Clun and Wenlock; and that portion in the Coventry and Lichfield diocese, the archdeaconry of Salop, the deaneries of Salop and Newport.

In 1535 the Hereford portion included the additional deanery of Bridgnorth; it now, since 1876, forms the archdeaconry of Ludlow, with the additional deaneries of Pontesbury, Bishops Castle, Condover, and Church Stretton. The archdeaconry of Salop, now entirely in the Lichfield diocese, includes the deaneries of Edgmond, Ellesmere, Hodnet, Shifnal, Shrewsbury, Wem, Whitchurch and Wrockwardine. Part of Shropshire was included in the Welsh diocese of St Asaph until the disestablishment of the Church in Wales (1920), comprising the deanery of Oswestry in the archdeaconry of Montgomery, and two parishes in the deanery of Llangollen and the archdeaconry of Wrexham. Certain parishes in Montgomeryshire, namely Churchstoke, Hyssington, Leighton and Trelystan, chose to remain in the Church of England

==English Civil War==
On the outbreak of the Civil War of the 17th century the Shropshire gentry for the most part declared for the King, who visited Shrewsbury in 1642 and received valuable contributions in plate and money from the inhabitants. A mint and printing-press were set up at Shrewsbury, which became a refuge for the neighbouring royalist gentry. Wem, the first place to declare for Parliament, was garrisoned in 1643. Shrewsbury was forced to surrender in 1645, and the royalist strongholds of Ludlow and Bridgnorth were captured in 1646, the latter after a four weeks&#x27; siege, during which the governor burnt part of the town for defence against Parliamentary troops.

==Commerce and industry==
The earliest industries of Shropshire took their rise from its abundant natural resources; the rivers supplying valuable fisheries; the vast forest areas abundance of timber; while the mineral products of the county had been exploited from remote times. The Domesday Survey mentions salt-works at Ditton Priors, Caynham and Donnington. The lead mines of Shelve and Stiperstones were worked by the Romans, and in 1220 Robert Corbett conferred on Shrewsbury Abbey a tithe of his lead from the mine at Shelve.

In 1260 licence was granted to dig coal in the Clee Hills, and in 1291 the abbot of Wigmore received the profits of a coal mine at Caynham. Iron was dug in the Clee Hills and at Wombridge in the 16th century. Wenlock had a famous copper-mine in the reign of Richard II, and in the 16th century was noted for its limestone.

As the forest areas were gradually cleared and brought under cultivation, the county became more exclusively agricultural. In 1343 Shropshire wool was rated at a higher value than that of almost any other English county, and in the 13th and 14th centuries Buildwas monastery exported wool to the Italian markets. Shropshire had never been distinguished for any characteristic manufactures, but a prosperous clothing trade arose about Shrewsbury and Bridgnorth, and Oswestry was famous in the 16th century for its &quot;Welsh cottons&quot;, cheap woolen cloth in which the nap was raised, or &quot;cottoned&quot; by carding.

===The Industrial Revolution===

Shropshire is the &quot;geological capital&quot; of the UK, as just about every rock type in Northern Europe is found within its borders, as are coal, lead, copper and iron ore deposits. In addition to this, the River Severn flows through the county and has been used for the transportation of goods and services for centuries. A result of this was that the Ironbridge Gorge became a focal point of new industrial energies in the 18th century. Coalbrookdale, a small area of the Gorge, has been claimed as the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, because of Abraham Darby I&#x27;s development of coke-smelting and ironfounding there in the early 18th century.

The towns of Broseley and Madeley were centres of innovation during the late 18th century. In Broseley, John Wilkinson pioneered precision engineering by providing cylinders for Boulton and Watt&#x27;s improved steam engines, and by boring cannons with greater accuracy and range. He also constructed the first iron boat, launched in 1787. It was in nearby locations where key events of the Industrial Revolution took place. Coalbrookdale is where modern iron smelting techniques were developed, Ironbridge is where the world&#x27;s first iron bridge was constructed in 1779, to link Broseley with Madeley and the Black Country, and Ditherington in Shrewsbury is where the world&#x27;s first iron framed building was built, the Ditherington Flaxmill. Other places notable for early industry are Jackfield for tiles and Coalport for china.

Later, Broseley and Madeley became notable for their continuation of trade in the field of bricks and tiles, which became a staple to the booming building trade, and millions of Broseley clay pipes were exported across the British Empire.

<doc id="1291393" wikidata="Q1071389" url="?curid=1291393" title="Gold mining">
<text>Gold mining is the extraction of gold by mining.

Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning. The expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation. In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by large corporations. However, the value of gold has led to millions of small, artisanal miners in many parts of the Global South.

Like all mining, human rights and environmental issues are common in the gold mining industry, and can result in environmental conflict. In mines with less regulation, health and safety risks are much higher.

==History==

The exact date that humans first began to mine gold is unknown, but some of the oldest known gold artifacts were found in the Varna Necropolis in Bulgaria. The graves of the necropolis were built between 4700 and 4200 BC, indicating that gold mining could be at least 6,724 years old. During a series of excavations carried out between 1878 and 1992, several graves were found with more than 6 kg of gold. A group of German and Georgian archaeologists claims the Sakdrisi site in southern Georgia, dating to the 3rd or 4th millennium BC, may be the world&#x27;s oldest known gold mine.

=== Ancient Times ===

==== Prehistoric Period ====
Gold has been prized by humans since prehistoric times. Archaeological evidence suggests that humans were mining gold as far back as 4000 BCE, with some the earliest known gold artifacts dating back to ancient Mesopotamia. Particularly in the region of present-day Iraq, gold was mined extensively. The ancient Sumerians, around 2500 BCE, developed sophisticated techniques for extracting gold from alluvial deposits and underground mines. These techniques included the use of sluice boxes.

===== Ancient Egypt =====
Evidence suggests that Nubia had sporadic access to gold nuggets during the Neolithic and Prehistoric Period. Gold mining in Egypt involved both surface mining such as panning for gold in riverbeads and underground mining, where tunnels were dug to extract gold-bearing quartz veins. During the Bronze Age, sites in the Eastern Desert became a great source of gold-mining for nomadic Nubians, who used &quot;two-hand-mallets&quot; and &quot;grinding
ore extraction.&quot; By the Old Kingdom, the oval mallet was introduced for mining. By the Middle Kingdom, stone mortars to process ores and a new gold-washing technique were introduced. During the New Kingdom, Nubian mining expanded under Egyptian occupation with the invention of the grinding mill. Additionally, gold was associated with the sun god Ra and was believed to be eternal and indestructible, symbolising the pharoah&#x27;s divine power and afterlife. Gold has also been found in the tombs of Tutankhamun and other pharoahs.

===== Ancient Rome and Greece =====
During the Bronze Age, gold objects were also plentiful; especially in Ireland and Spain. Romans employed slave labour and used hydraulic mining methods, such as hushing and ground sluicing on a large scale to extract gold from extensive alluvial (loose sediment) deposits, such as those at Las Medulas. Mining was under the control of the state but the mines may have been leased to civilian contractors some time later. The gold served as the primary medium of exchange within the empire, and was an important motive in the Roman conquest of Britain by Claudius in the first century AD; although there is only one known Roman gold mine at Dolaucothi in west Wales. Gold was a prime motivation for the campaign in Dacia when the Romans invaded Transylvania in what is now modern Romania in the second century AD. The legions were led by the emperor Trajan, and their exploits are shown on Trajan&#x27;s Column in Rome and the several reproductions of the column elsewhere (such as the Victoria and Albert Museum in London). Under the Eastern Roman Empire Emperor Justinian&#x27;s rule, gold was mined in the Balkans, Anatolia, Armenia, Egypt, and Nubia.

===== Ancient Asia =====
In the area of the Kolar Gold Fields in Bangarpet Taluk, Kolar district of Karnataka state, India; gold was first mined prior to the 2nd and 3rd century AD by digging small pits. Golden objects found in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have been traced to Kolar through the analysis of impuritiesthe impurities include 11% silver concentration, found only in KGF ore. The Champion reef at the Kolar gold fields was mined to a depth of during the Gupta period in the fifth century AD. During the Chola period in the 9th and 10th century AD, the scale of the operation grew. The metal continued to be mined by the eleventh-century kings of South India, the Vijayanagara Empire from 1336 to 1560, and later by Tipu Sultan, the king of Mysore state and the British. It is estimated that the total gold production in Karnataka to date is 1000 tons.

The mining of the Hungarian deposit (present-day Slovakia) primarily around Kremnica was the largest of the Medieval period in Europe.

===== Ancient South America =====
In South America, gold mining in the Andes dates back to thousands of years, with the Inca empire employing extensive gold mining operations in regions such as present-day Peru and Ecuador. They used stone tools and simple mining techniques to extract gold from rivers, streams, and surface deposits.

=== Middle Ages: European Gold Rushes ===
During the Middle Ages, Europe experience several gold rushes. Most notably in regions like Transylvania, Scotland, and Wales. These rushes were often small-scale and localised compared to later rushes in history.

==== Transylvania ====
The Transylvania gold rush took place in the Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Romania), primarily in the region of Transylvania during the medieval period. Transylvania was known for its rich mineral resources including gold, silver, and other metals. Miners in Transylvania used both surface and underground mining techniques to extract gold from alluvial deposits and veins. These methods include panning, sluicing, and rudimentary shaft mining.

==== Scotland ====
The Scottish gold rush occurred in Scotland, primarily in the Highlands during the 16th and 17th century. Gold deposits were discovered in rivers and streams, leading to a surge in prospecting and mining activity. The Scottish Crown took an interest in gold discoveries, in hopes of aiding the kingdom&#x27;s economy and revenue. King James IV of Scotland established a royal mint to produce gold coins from Scottish gold. The Scottish gold rush eventually waned due to a combination of factors including the depletion of easily accessible gold deposits, harsh weather conditions, and the political instability at the time.

==== Wales ====
The Welsh gold rush occurred in Wales, more so in the Dolgellau area of Gwynedd, during the 19th century. Gold deposits were discovered in Welsh mountains, with reports of gold being found in rivers Mawddach and Tryweryn. By the mid-19th century, commercial mining operations had begun. Wales&#x27; gold gained popularity for its quality and rarity, leading to its use in royal jewelry for the British royal family.

=== Modern Era ===

==== California Gold Rush ====
During the 19th century, numerous gold rushes in remote regions around the globe caused large migrations of miners, such as the California Gold Rush of 1849. This is one of the most famous gold rushes in history. The discovery of gold at Sutter&#x27;s Mill in California sparked a massive migration of people from around the world to California in search of gold. The rush significantly accelerated westward expansion in the United States and had profound effects on the region&#x27;s economy and society.

==== Australian Gold Rush ====
The gold rushes began in 1851 when Edward Hargraves, a prospector, discovered gold near Bathhurst, New South Wales. The most well known gold rush in Australia was the Victorian Gold Rush. Thousands of people, known as &#x27;diggers&#x27;, came from around the world to Australia in search of gold, which ultimately contributed to the growth of cities like Melbourne and Sydney.

==== South African Gold Rush ====
The discovery of gold in the Witwatersrand led to the Second Boer War and ultimately the founding of South Africa. This transformed the region into one of the wealthiest gold-producing areas in the world. This rush played a crucial role in the development of South Africa&#x27;s economy and lead to the establishment of Johannesburg, known as the &#x27;city of gold&#x27;. Gold-bearing reefs in the neighbouring Free State province were found shortly thereafter, driving significant development in the region with the establishment of the Free State goldfields.
==== Klondike Gold Rush ====
Also known as the Yukon Gold Rush, brought prospectors from around the world to the Klondike region of the Yukon territory in Canada. The Klondike Gold Rush began in 1896, when gold was discovered in Bonanza Creek, a tributary of the Klondike River by George Carmack and his Indigenous companions, Skookum Jim Mason and Tagish Charlie. As prospectors arrived in Klondike, makeshift towns and settlements sprang up along the rivers, including Dawson City, which because the largest town in Yukon at the height of the gold rush. Prospectors employed various mining techniques to extract gold from the Klondike&#x27;s streams and riverbeds, including placer mining, dredging, and hydraulic mining.

==== The Carlin Trend ====
The Carlin Trend of Nevada, U.S., was discovered in 1961. Official estimates indicate that total world gold production since the beginning of civilization has been around and total gold production in Nevada is 1.1% of that, ranking Nevada as one of the Earth&#x27;s primary gold-producing regions.

== Statistics ==
World gold production was 3,612 tonnes in 2022. , the world&#x27;s largest gold producer was China with 368.3 tonnes of gold mined in that year. The second-largest producer of gold was Russia where 331.1 tonnes was mined in the same year, followed by Australia with 327.8 tonnes. In 2023, the annual gold demand of 4,448 tonnes was 5% below that of 2022. The total gold demand in 2023 was the highest at 4,899 tonnes.
Despite its decreasing content in ores, gold production is increasing. This increase can be achieved through ever larger-scale industrial installations as well as innovations, especially in hydrometallurgy.

==Methods==
=== Hard rock mining ===


Hard rock mining extracts gold encased in rock, rather than fragments in loose sediment, and produces most of the world&#x27;s gold. Sometimes open-pit mining is used, such as at the Fort Knox Mine in central Alaska. Barrick Gold Corporation has one of the largest open-pit gold mines in North America located on its Goldstrike mine property in north eastern Nevada. Other gold mines use underground mining, where the ore is extracted through tunnels or shafts. South Africa has the world&#x27;s deepest hard rock gold mine up to underground. At such depths, the heat is unbearable for humans, and air conditioning is required for the safety of the workers. The first such mine to receive air conditioning was Robinson Deep, at that time the deepest mine in the world for any mineral.

===By-product gold mining===
Gold is also produced by mining in which it is not the principal product. Large copper mines, such as the Bingham Canyon mine in Utah, often recover considerable amounts of gold and other metals along with copper. Sand and gravel pits, like those in Denver (Colorado), may recover small amounts of gold in their wash operations. The largest producing gold mine in the world, the Grasberg mine in Papua, Indonesia, is primarily a copper mine.

===Niche, recreational, or historical methods===

====Placer mining====

Placer mining is a method of extracting gold from alluvial deposits such as sand, gravel, and sediment. These are known as placer deposits which are typically found in riverbeds, stream beds, and floodplains. These deposits typically contain minerals that are resistant to weathering and eroision like gold, platinum, diamonds, and more. They are characterized by their relatively high concentration of valuable minerals compared to the surrounding rock or sediments. Unlike hard-rock mining, which involves excavating solid rock formations, water or dredging is used to extract the gold.

=====Sluicing=====
Using a sluice box to extract gold from placer deposits has long been a very common practice in prospecting and small-scale mining. Sluices work on the principle that heavier particles will sink to the bottom of a stream, while those that are lighter will be carried downstream and expelled. A sluice box is essentially a man made channel with riffles set in the bottom. The riffles are designed to create dead zones in the current to allow gold to drop out of suspension. The box is placed in the stream to channel water flow. Gold-bearing material is placed at the top of the box. The material is carried by the current through the volt where gold and other dense material settles out behind the riffles. Less dense material flows out of the box as tailings.

Larger commercial placer mining operations employ screening plants, or trommels, to remove the larger alluvial materials such as boulders and gravel, before concentrating the remainder in a sluice box or jig plant. After the gold is sorted through trommels, it is then placed through regular sluice boxes for further sorting. These operations typically include diesel powered, earth moving equipment including excavators, bulldozers, wheel loaders, and rock trucks.

=====Dredging=====

Although this method has largely been replaced by modern methods, some dredging is done by small-scale miners using suction dredges. These are small machines that float on the water and are usually operated by one or two people. A suction dredge consists of a sluice box supported by pontoons, attached to a suction hose which is controlled by a miner working beneath the water. This method is particularly popular in areas where gold is found at river bottoms or submerge deposits.

Suction dredging can have environmental impacts, moreso on aquatic habitats and water quality. Regulations and best practices are often in place to minimize these impacts. State dredging permits in many of the United States gold dredging areas specify a seasonal time period and area closures to avoid conflicts between dredgers and the spawning time of fish populations. Some US states, such as Montana, require an extensive permitting procedure, including permits.

Some large suction dredges [ &amp; ] are used in commercial production throughout the world. Small suction dredges are much more efficient at extracting smaller gold than the old &quot;bucket line&quot;. This has improved the chances of finding gold. Smaller dredges with suction tubes are used to sample areas behind boulders and along potential pay streaks, until &quot;colour&quot; (gold) appears.

Other larger scale dredging operations take place on exposed river gravel bars at seasonal low water. These operations typically use a land based excavator to feed a gravel screening plant and sluice box floating in a temporary pond. The pond is excavated in the gravel bar and filled from the natural water table. &quot;Pay&quot; gravel is excavated from the front face of the pond and processed through the floating plant, with the gold trapped in the onboard sluice box and tailings stacked behind the plant, steadily filling in the back of the pond as the operation moves forward. This type of gold mining is characterized by its low cost, as each rock is moved only once. It also has low environmental impact, as no stripping of vegetation or overburden is necessary, and all process water is fully recycled. Such operations are typical on New Zealand&#x27;s South Island and in the Klondike region of Canada.

=====Rocker box=====

Also called a cradle, a rocker box uses riffles located in a high-walled box to trap gold in a similar manner to the sluice box. A rocker box uses less water than a sluice box and is well suited for areas where water is limited. A rocking motion provides the water movement needed for the gravity separation of gold in placer material. Rocker boxes gained popularity during the California Gold Rush in the 19th century and remain in use today. Although simple and inexpensive, it is not efficient as the previously discussed mining techniques.

==Gold ore processing==
===Cyanide process===

The dominant method for refining gold is a cyanide extraction method, or gold cyanidation, introduced in the late 1800s. This a metallurgical technique used to extract gold from lower grade ores by converting gold into a water-soluble coordination complex. Finely ground rock is treated with a solution of sodium cyanide. The extract is absorbed onto carbon and then removed from the carbon with a solution of caustic soda and cyanide. Gold cyanide is then converted to relatively pure gold through gold parting.

There are many environmental hazards associated with this extraction method, largely due to the high toxicity of the cyanide compounds. Furthermore, there are potentials for accidental spills or leaks to cause harm to aquatic ecosystems and human health. For example, in 2000, the Baia Mare cyanide spill in northern Romania released approximately of waste water contaminated with heavy metal sludge and up to of cyanide into the Tisza River.

===Mercury process===

Historically, mercury was used extensively in placer gold mining in order to form mercury-gold amalgam with smaller gold particles, and thereby increase the gold recovery rates. First, the gold ore is crushed and ground to a fine powder to expose the gold particles for amalgamation. Then, this finely ground ore is mixed with liquid mercury to amalgamate it. Mercury forms an amalgam, an alloy, with gold particles to allow for the efficient capture of gold from the ore. The gold is concentrated by boiling away the mercury from the amalgam. This process is called retorting. This is effective in extracting very small gold particles, but the process is hazardous due to the toxicity of mercury vapour. Large-scale use of mercury stopped in the 1960s. However, mercury is still used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM).

== Business ==

=== Small operations ===


While most gold is produced by major corporations, there are an estimated 10 to 15 million small-scale artisanal gold miners worldwide. Around 4.5 million of them are women, and an estimated 600,000 children work in illegal artisanal gold mines. Artisanal miners use rudimentary methods to extract and process gold. Many of these people are mining to escape extreme poverty, unemployment and landlessness.

In Ghana, &quot;galamsey&quot; miners are estimated to number 20,000 to 50,000. In neighboring francophone countries, such workers are called &quot;orpailleurs.&quot; In Brazil, Venezuela, Suriname, and French Guiana, workers are called &quot;garimpeiros&quot;. These workers are not required to claim responsibility for their social and environmental impacts.

Miners risk government persecution, mine shaft collapses, and toxic poisoning from unsafe chemicals used in processing, such as mercury. For example, in Ghana during 2009, the Dompoase mine collapse killed 18 workers. It was the worst mining disaster in Ghanaian history.

Children in these mines suffer extremely harsh working conditions and various hazards such as collapsing tunnels, explosions, and chemical exposure. Children may be especially vulnerable to these hazards and many suffer from serious respiratory conditions, hearing, and vision problems.

=== Large companies ===
Gold mining by large multi-national corporations produces about 80% of the gold supply. Most gold is mined in developing nations. Large mining companies play a key role in globalisation of the economy by linking rich and poor companies. Newmont and Barrick Gold are the largest gold mining companies in the world, but there are many smaller corporations in the industry.

Local communities are frequently vulnerable to environmental degradation caused by large mining companies and may lack government protection or industry regulation. For example, thousands of people around Lega Dembi mine are exposed to mercury, arsenic, and other toxins resulting in widespread health problems and birth defects. Vulnerable communities may also lose their land to the mine. Some large companies have attempted to build local legitimacy through corporate responsibility initiatives and local development.

==Adverse effects and responses==

===Impact===

==== Environmental impacts ====
Gold mining can significantly alter the natural environment. Gold mining activities in tropical forests are increasingly causing deforestation along rivers and in remote areas rich in biodiversity. Mining has increased rainforest loss up to 70 km beyond lease boundaries, causing nearly 11,670 km2 of deforestation between 2005 to 2015. Up to 9% of gold mining occurs outside of these regulated lease boundaries. Other gold mining impacts, particularly in aquatic systems with residual cyanide or mercury (used in the recovery of gold from ore), can be highly toxic to people and wildlife even at relatively low concentrations. Illegal gold mining exacerbates the ecological vulnerability of the remaining forest ultimately leading to permanent forest loss. Gold mining clears native forests for mineral extraction, but also indirectly facilitates access to more land and further clearing. Rainforest recovery rates are the lowest ever recorded for tropical forests, with there being little to no tree regeneration at abandoned mining camps, even after several years. The Amazon rainforest is at risk for &#x27;savannization&#x27;, which is the gradual transformation of a tropical rainforest into a savannah. This would ultimately lead to a collapse of biodiversity, ecosystems, and climate.

Gold mining produces more waste than mining of other minerals, because it can be mined at a lower grade. Tailings can contain lead, mercury, cadmium, and arsenic. These toxins can pose health risks for local communities. Arsenic is typically found in gold-containing ores, and gold processing may contaminate groundwater or the atmosphere. This pollution may persist for decades. Furthermore, mining operations use large quantities of water for processing ore and can result in the contamination of water sources with heavy metals, such as mercury and cyanide, used in the extraction process. This pollution can have detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems and human health. Soil degradation has also been found to be impacted by gold mining. Mining activities can disturb soil structure, leading to erosion, sedimentation of waterways, and loss of fertile land for agriculture or vegetation regrowth. More evidently, dust and emissions from mining machiner and processing facilities can contribute to air pollution, impacting air quality and potentially causings respiratory problems for nearby communities.

==== Social and cultural impacts ====
Large-scale gold mining projects may require land acquisition and resettlement of local communities, leading to displacement, loss of livelihoods, and disruption of traditional ways of life. In addition to the possible respiratory problems that could be acquired, individuals may be exposed to hazardous chemicals used in gold extraction such as mercury and cyanide. These chemicals pose risks to gold miners, communities, and wildlife; resulting in further medical problems involving neurological disorders and waterborne diseases.

Gold mining in some regions has been associated with conflicts over land rights, labour rights violations, and exploitation of vulnerable populations, including Indigenous peoples and artisanal miners. Mining activities can damage or destroy cultural heritage sites, artifacts, and sacred areas; further impacting cultural identities and heritages. In the Amazon rainforest, Indigenous peoples have been killed and had their rightfully owned land stolen from them. As a consequence of this, some have left the rainforest to move to cities which further puts them at risk to disease, homelessness, and poverty.

Artisanal gold mining is widespread across Africa, occurring in numerous countries including Ghana, Mali, Burkina Faso, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and many others. For many individuals and communities in rural Africa, artisanal gold mining represents a critical source of income and livelihood, providing employment opportunities and economic support in regions with limited alternative options. Artisanal mining operations vary in scale, from individuals panning for gold in rivers and streams, to small groups working collectibely in informal mining camps, often referred to as &#x27;galamsey&#x27; in West Africa.

==== Economic impacts ====
Gold mining can create employment opportunities in mining operations and related sectors. Howevers, these jobs may be temporary. The sector&#x27;s reliance on fluctuating global gold prices can lead to economic stability for communities dependent on mining. The discovery of significant gold deposits in a region often sees a flood of resources and development, which lasts as long as the mines are economic. When goldfields begin to decline in production, local economies find themselves destabilised and overly reliant upon an industry that will inevitably abandon the region when gold deposits are sufficiently depleted; leaving the areas without proper rehabilitation.

The some instances, the &#x27;resource curse&#x27; phenomenon may occur, where countries rich in natural resources, like gold, may experience economic challenges, corruption, inequality, and governence issues instead of sustained development. Despite the existence of several laws that regulate environmental crimes, illegal practices in mining tends to happen because of an absence of enforcement. The rules for gold mining create ambiguities between the types of &#x27;legal&#x27; mining; leaving loopholes for those to exploit.

==== Global market impacts ====
Gold prices are subject to global market trands, economic uncertainties, and geopolitical factors. Fluctuation in gold prices can influence investment decisions, currency values, and trade balances in gold-producing and consuming countries. Furthermore, the global gold supply chain involves complex networks of mining companies, refineries, traders, and retailers. Ensuring ethical and sustainable practices throughout this supply chain, including addressing issues such as child labour and environmental degradation, remains a challenge.

===Responses===
Human Rights Watch produced a report in 2015 that outlined some of challenges faced globally. The report notes that
&quot;Fairtrade&quot; and &quot;Fairmined&quot; dual certification for gold was launched across the United Kingdom on 14 February 2011, a joint scheme between The Fairtrade Foundation and The Association for Responsible Mining. The &quot;Fairmined&quot; mark ensures that the gold has been extracted in a fair and responsible manner.

A UN investigation reported human rights abuses such as sexual exploitation of women and children, mercury poisoning, and child labor affecting communities where illegal gold production occurs. The reports said global buyers such as Switzerland, through which roughly two-thirds of global trade transits, need to ensure that human rights are respected throughout supply chains.

The &quot;No Dirty Gold&quot; campaign, working with a number of campaigning partners, was established in 2004 and aims &quot;to ensure that gold mining operations respect human rights and the environment&quot; through a call for changes in gold mining techniques and processes. The impacts of mining on the environment are long-lasting, and active land management and restoration are needed to ensure recovery. A barrier to the restoration of environments is cost. Limited funding is a major barrier in implementing commitments. Restoration costs vary widely between difference approaches, such as passive and active restoration. Additionally, governments have started to promote the formalization of gold mining. This formalization puts the government in a better position to govern the sectors, manage environmental impacts, and direct mining away from ecologically sensitive areas.

==Peak gold==

Peak gold is the date at which the maximum rate of global gold extraction is reached. According to Hubbert peak theory, after the peak, the rate of production declines until it approaches zero. Unlike petroleum, which is destroyed in use, gold can be reused and recycled.

===Supply and demand===
World gold demand (defined in terms of total consumption excluding central banks) in 2007 was 3,519 tonnes. Gold demand is subdivided into central bank reserve increases, jewellery production, industrial consumption (including dental), and investment (bars, coins, exchange-traded funds, etc.)

The supply of gold is provided by mining, official sales (typically gold by central banks), de-hedging (physical delivery of metal sold months before by mining companies on terminal markets), and old gold scraps. The total world supply of gold in 2007 was 3,497 tonnes. Gold production does not need to make up for gold demand because gold is a reusable resource. Currently, yearly gold mining produces 2% of the existing above-ground gold which is 158,000 tonnes (as of 2006). In 2008, gold mining produced 2,400 tonnes of gold, official gold sales close to 300 tonnes, and dehedging (physical delivery of metal sold months before by mining companies on terminal markets) close to 500 tonnes.

===Timing of peak production===
World mined gold production has peaked four times since 1900: in 1912, 1940, 1971, and 2001, with each peak being higher than previous peaks. The latest peak was in 2001, when production reached 2,600 metric tons, then declined for several years. Production started to increase again in 2009, spurred by high gold prices, and achieved record new highs each year from 2011 through 2015, when production reached 3,100 tonnes. Early estimates of 2016 gold production indicate that it was flat to 2015 production, at 3,100 tonnes.

In 2009, Barrick CEO Aaron Regent claimed that global production had peaked in 2000. Barrick&#x27;s production costs have been &quot;trending down&quot; despite this peak, reaching . In 2006, with gold at , Roland Watson claimed that gold production had peaked in 2001 due to falling exploration in the 1990s, when gold prices were low. He predicted that higher prices and new technologies would boost gold production to higher levels in the future.

In July 2012, Natural Resource Holdings CEO Roy Sebag wrote a report entitled &quot;2012 World Gold Deposit Ranking&quot; claiming that gold production would peak between 2022 and 2025 due to the markedly lower grades and remote locations of the remaining known undeveloped deposits.

Charles Jeannes, the CEO of Goldcorp, the world&#x27;s largest gold miner by market capitalization, stated in September 2014 that Peak Gold would be reached in either 2014 or 2015. &quot;Whether it is this year or next year, I don&#x27;t think we will ever see the gold production reach these levels again,&quot; he claimed. &quot;There are just not that many new mines being found and developed.&quot;

== Economics of gold ==
The gold price compared to other valuable metals consistently holds its value and is less prone to price changes than other metals. Gold production tends to excel when there are turbulent market conditions with investors seeking a different investment opportunity outside the stock, bond or real estate markets. Some of the factors affecting gold prices are:

=== Central bank gold reserves ===
Central banks diversify their reserves with gold to protect the value of the dollar during challenging economic times. When banks are forced to print more money to prevent economic turmoil they are simultaneously devaluing the currency. Gold, unlike money, is a finite valuable material which can be used as a hedge against the inflation cause by increasing the money supply. Gold has this inverse relationship with the US dollar which is used as a reserve asset by many central banks thus protecting the central banks reserves when there is a dip in the US dollar or the money supply increases.

=== Value of the U.S. dollar ===
As mentioned above the value of the U.S. dollar is normally inversely related to the value of gold, this is because gold is dollar-denominated. When the U.S. dollar is stronger it tends to keep the price of gold lower and controlled and when there is a weaker U.S. dollar the price of gold is likely to increase as well as the demand for it.
