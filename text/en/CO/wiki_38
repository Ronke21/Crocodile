<text>The Black Sea Fleet () is the fleet of the Russian Navy in the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov and the Mediterranean Sea. The Black Sea Fleet, along with other Russian ground and air forces on the Crimean Peninsula, are subordinate to the Southern Military District of the Russian Armed Forces. The fleet traces its history to its founding by Prince Potemkin on 13 May 1783 as part of the Imperial Russian Navy. The Russian SFSR inherited the fleet in 1918; with the founding of the Soviet Union in 1922, it became part of the Soviet Navy. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Black Sea Fleet was partitioned between the Russian Federation and Ukraine in 1997, with Russia receiving title to 82% of the vessels.

The Black Sea Fleet has its official primary headquarters and facilities at the Sevastopol Naval Base, Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The rest of the fleet&#x27;s facilities are based in locations on the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, including Krasnodar Krai, Rostov Oblast and Crimea.

The ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War led to major operations and losses due to Ukrainian missiles and umanned surface vehicles including the flagship &quot;Moskva&quot; and several landing vessels. Additionally, there was a 2023 Ukrainian missile strike against the Black Sea Fleet HQ in Sevastopol itself; After another attack on 24 March 2024, a Ukraine spokesperson said that they have disabled or damaged one third of the fleet during the war. In June, Ukraine said was now highly likely that they had destroyed all of the Black Sea Fleet&#x27;s missile carrier capability based in Crimea. On 2 August, another missile attack sank a Russian submarine that was under repair.

==History==
===Imperial Russian Navy===

The Black Sea Fleet is considered to have been founded by Prince Potemkin on 13 May 1783, together with its principal base, the city of Sevastopol. Formerly commanded by admirals such as Dmitry Senyavin and Pavel Nakhimov, it is a fleet of great historical and political importance for Russia. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1792 Russian control over Crimea was confirmed and Russian naval forces under the command of Admiral Fyodor Ushakov defeated the Turkish fleet at the Battle of Kerch Strait in 1790, preventing the Turks from landing a force in Crimea; while Ushakov&#x27;s victory at Tendra allowed the Russians to begin the siege of Izmail, a potent Ottoman stronghold by the Black Sea, which was twice besieged without effect.

During the French Revolutionary Wars, the Black Sea Fleet was initially deployed under the command of Admiral Ushakov, in conjunction with the Turks, against French forces during the Siege of Corfu. The victory led to the establishment of the Septinsular Republic with the island of Corfu then serving as a base for Russian naval units in the Mediterranean operating against the French.

Turkey, encouraged by the French, went to war with Russia in the Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812. The Russian fleet (deploying from the Baltic, but joining some vessels of the Black Sea Fleet already in the Mediterranean prior to the outbreak of war) under the command of Admiral Dmitry Senyavin played an instrumental role in this conflict securing victories at both the Battle of the Dardanelles (1807) and the Battle of Athos.

After the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars, the Russians, together with the British and French, intervened in the Greek War of Independence defeating the Turkish fleet at the Battle of Navarino in 1827 and helping to secure Greek independence (though once again, the Russian fleet was compelled to deploy from the Baltic). Turkish closure of the Dardanelles Straits then sparked a renewed Russo-Turkish conflict from 1828 to 1829 which led to the Russians gaining further territory along the eastern Black Sea.

The restriction imposed on the Black Sea Fleet by Turkish control of the Straits was influential in motivating Russia from time-to-time to attempt to secure control of the passage, which became a recurrent theme in Russian policy. From 1841 onward, the Russian fleet was formally confined to the Black Sea by the London Straits Convention.

====Crimean War====

In 1853, the Black Sea Fleet destroyed Turkish naval forces at the Battle of Sinop after the Turks had declared war on Russia. Nevertheless, during the ensuing Crimean War, the Russians were placed on the defensive and the allies were able to land their forces in Crimea and, ultimately, capture Sevastopol.

As a result of the Crimean War, one provision of the 1856 Treaty of Paris was that the Black Sea was to be a demilitarized zone similar to the Island of Åland in the Baltic Sea.

====1877 conflict with Turkey====
This hampered the Russians during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 and in the aftermath of that conflict, Russia moved to reconstitute its naval strength and fortifications in the Black Sea.

====1905 revolution====
The Black Sea Fleet would play an instrumental political role in the 1905 Russian Revolution with the crew of the battleship revolting in 1905 soon after the Navy&#x27;s defeat in the Russo-Japanese War. The revolt acquired a symbolic character in the lead up to the Russian Revolutions of 1917 and after, as portrayed in the 1925 film by Sergei Eisenstein, &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot;. Lenin wrote that the &quot;Potemkin&quot; uprising had had a huge importance in terms of being the first attempt at creating the nucleus of a revolutionary army.

==== World War I and Russian Civil War ====

During World War I, there were a number of encounters between the Russian and Ottoman navies in the Black Sea. The Ottomans initially had the advantage due to having under their command the German battlecruiser , but after the two modern Russian dreadnoughts and had been built in Nikolaev, the Russians took command of the sea until the Russian government collapsed in November 1917. German submarines of the Constantinople Flotilla and Turkish light forces would continue to raid and harass Russian shipping until the war&#x27;s end.

In 1918, some elements of the fleet were interned by the Central Powers as a result of their advance into South Russia. In the April Crimea operation, the goal of both Ukrainians and Germans was to get control over the Black Sea Fleet, anchored in Sevastopol. Former Chief of Staff Mikhail Sablin raised the colours of the Ukrainian National Republic on 29 April 1918, and moved a portion of the Ukrainian fleet (two battleships and fourteen destroyers) to Novorossiysk in order to save it from capture by the Germans.

He was ordered to scuttle his ships by Lenin but refused to do so. Most ships returned to Sevastopol, where they first came under German control. In November 1918 they came under control of the Allies, who later gave the ships to Wrangel&#x27;s fleet of the Whites.

In 1919, following the collapse of the Central Powers&#x27; occupation in Western Russia, the Red Fleet of Ukraine was established out of certain remnants of the Russian Imperial Fleet. However, subsequently these elements were either scuttled or captured by the Western Allies. During the ensuing Russian Civil War, the chaotic political and strategic situation in southern Russia permitted the intervening Western allies to occupy Odessa, Sevastopol and other centres with relative ease.

Most of the ships of the Black Sea Fleet became part of the &quot;Russian Squadron&quot; of Wrangel&#x27;s armed forces. Following the defeat of anti-Bolshevik forces and the evacuation of Crimea by White forces, the fleet itself sailed to Tunisia. Out of those ships, some passed to the French Navy while others were sold as scrap.

=== Soviet Navy ===

With the defeat of the anti-Bolshevik Armed Forces of South Russia, the Soviet government took control of all naval elements. The few ships that remained in the Black Sea were scrapped in the 1920s and a large scale new construction programme began in the 1930s. Over 500 new ships were built during that period and a massive expansion of coastal infrastructure took place. The Black Sea Fleet was commanded by Vice Admiral F.S. Oktyabrskiy on the outbreak of war with Germany in June 1941.

==== World War II ====
During World War II despite the scale of the German/Axis advance in southern Russia, and the capture of Crimea by Axis forces in mid-1942, the Fleet, though badly mauled, gave a creditable account of itself as it fought alongside the Red Army during the Siege of Odessa and the Battle of Sevastopol.

Soviet hospital ship was sunk on 7 November 1941 by German aircraft while evacuating civilians and wounded soldiers from Crimea. It has been estimated that approximately 5,000 to 7,000 people were killed during the sinking, making it one of the deadliest maritime disasters in history. There were only 8 survivors.

==== Cold War ====
With the end of World War II, the Soviet Union effectively dominated the Black Sea region. The Soviet Union controlled the entire north and east of the Black Sea while pro-Soviet regimes were installed in Romania and Bulgaria. As members of the Warsaw Pact, the Romanian and Bulgarian navies supplemented the strength of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet. Only Turkey remained outside the Soviet Black Sea security regime and the Soviets initially pressed for joint control of the Bosporus Straits with Turkey; a position which Turkey rejected.

In 1952, Turkey decided to join NATO, placing the Bosporus Straits in the Western sphere of influence. Nevertheless, the terms of the Montreux Convention limited NATO&#x27;s options with respect to directly reinforcing Turkey&#x27;s position in the Black Sea. The Soviets, in turn, had some of their naval options in the Mediterranean restricted by the Montreux Convention limitations.

In the later post-war period, along with the Northern Fleet, the Black Sea Fleet provided ships for the 5th Operational Squadron in the Mediterranean, which confronted the United States Navy during the Arab-Israeli wars, notably during the Yom Kippur War in 1973.
In 1988 Coastal Troops and Naval Aviation units of the Black Sea Fleet included:

* Danube Flotilla:
** 116th River Ship Brigade (Izmail, Odesa Oblast)
* 112th Reconnaissance Ship Brigade (Lake Donuzlav (Mirnyy), Crimean Oblast)
* 37th Rescue Ship Brigade (Sevastopol, Crimean Oblast)
* Marine and Coastal Defense Forces Department
** 810th Naval Infantry Brigade (Sevastopol, Crimean Oblast)
** 362nd independent Coastal Missile Regiment (Balaklava, Crimean Oblast)
** 138th independent Coastal Missile Regiment (Chernomorsk, Crimean Oblast)
** 417th independent Coastal Missile Regiment (Sevastopol, Crimean Oblast)
** 51st independent Coastal Missile Regiment (Mekenzerye, Crimean Oblast)
* Naval Air Forces Department of the Black Sea Fleet
** 2nd Guards Maritime Missile Aviation Division (Gvardeyskoye, Crimean Oblast)(three regiments of maritime attack Tu-22M2s
*** 5th Maritime Missile Aviation Regiment (Veseloye, Crimean Oblast) – disbanded 15.11.94.
*** 124th Maritime Missile Aviation Regiment (Gvardeskoye, Crimean Oblast) – disbanded 1993.
*** 943rd Maritime Missile Aviation Regiment (Oktyabrskoye) – disbanded 1996.
** 30th independent Maritime Reconnaissance Aviation Regiment (Saki-Novofedorovka, Crimean Oblast)(Tu-22P)
** 318th independent Anti-Submarine Aviation Regiment (Lake Donuzlav, Crimean Oblast)
** 78th independent Shipborne Anti-Submarine Helicopter Regiment (Lake Donuzlav, Crimean Oblast)
** 872nd independent Shipborne Anti-Submarine Helicopter Regiment (Kacha, Crimean Oblast)
** 917th independent Transport Aviation Regiment (Kacha, Crimean Oblast)
** 859th Training Center for Naval Aviation (Kacha, Crimean Oblast)

In 1989, the 126th Motor Rifle Division at Simferopol was transferred to the Black Sea Fleet from the Odesa Military District. Also that year, the 119th Fighter Aviation Division, with the 86th Guards, 161st, and 841st Guards Fighter Aviation Regiments, joined the Fleet from the 5th Air Army. The 86th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment became part of the Moldovan Air Force upon the breakup of the Soviet Union. The 841st at Meria airport (between Poti and Batumi in the Adjar ASSR) (Georgian SSR) became the 841st independent Guards Anti-Submarine Helicopter Regiment in May 1991 and was disbanded in October 1992.

The 43rd Aviation Sevastopol Red Banner Order of Kutuzov Regiment of Fighter-Bombers, after being included in the Air Force of the Red Banner Black Sea Fleet on 1 December 1990, was renamed the 43rd Separate Naval Assault Aviation Sevastopol Red Banner Order of Kutuzov Regiment.

===After the fall of the Soviet Union===
With the fall of the Soviet Union and the demise of the Warsaw Pact, the military importance of the fleet was degraded and it suffered significant funding cuts and the loss of its major missions.

In the early 1990s the fleet had 645 ships and 72,000 personnel.

In 1992, the major part of the personnel, armaments and coastal facilities of the Fleet fell under formal jurisdiction of the newly independent Ukraine as they were situated on Ukrainian territory. Later, the Ukrainian government ordered the establishment of its own Ukrainian Navy based on the Black Sea Fleet; several ships and ground formations declared themselves Ukrainian.

However, this immediately led to conflicts with the majority of officers who appeared to be loyal to Russia. According to pro-Ukrainian sailors they were declared &quot;drunkards and villains&quot; and they and their families were harassed. They have also claimed that their names were branded &quot;traitors to Russia&quot; on local graffiti. Simultaneously, pro-Russian separatist groups became active in the local politics of Ukraine&#x27;s Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol where the major naval bases were situated, and started coordinating their efforts with pro-Moscow seamen.

During this time the Georgian Civil War broke out. Fighting erupted between two separatist minorities of South Ossetia and Abkhazia supported by Russia on one side and the Georgian government led by Zviad Gamsakhurdia on the other. However, he was ousted during the so-called Tbilisi War in 1991. The new government continued the fighting against the break-away republics, but at the same time asked Russia&#x27;s president Boris Yeltsin for support against the &#x27;Zviadists&#x27; who were trying to regain power. This led to the Black Sea Fleet landing in Georgia (despite the unsettled dispute over ownership of the fleet), and resulted in the Battle of Poti.

====Joint Fleet and its partition====
Presidents Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine and Boris Yeltsin of Russia negotiated terms for dividing the fleet, and to ease the tensions, on 10 June 1995 the two governments signed an interim treaty, establishing a joint Russo-Ukrainian Black Sea Fleet under bilateral command (and Soviet Navy flag) until a full-scale partition agreement could be reached. Formally, the Fleet&#x27;s Commander was to be appointed by a joint order of the two countries&#x27; presidents. However, Russia still dominated the Fleet unofficially, and a Russian admiral was appointed as Commander; the majority of the fleet personnel adopted Russian citizenship. Minor tensions between the Fleet and the new Ukrainian Navy (such as electricity cut-offs and sailors&#x27; street-fighting) continued.

In 1996 the 126th Motor Rifle Division was disestablished.

Moscow mayor Yuriy Luzhkov campaigned to annex the city of Sevastopol, which housed the fleet&#x27;s headquarters and main naval base, and in December the Russian Federation Council officially endorsed the claim. Spurred by these territorial claims, Ukraine proposed a &quot;special partnership&quot; with NATO in January 1997.

On 28 May 1997, Russia and Ukraine signed several agreements regarding the fleet including the Partition Treaty, establishing two independent national fleets and dividing armaments and bases between them. Ukraine agreed to lease major parts of its facilities to the Russian Black Sea Fleet until 2017. However, permanent tensions on the lease details continued. The Fleet&#x27;s main base was still situated in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol. In 2009 the Yushchenko Ukrainian government declared that the lease would not be extended and that the fleet would have to leave Sevastopol by 2017.

Due to the lack of fleet facilities in Russia, the former naval area at the Port of Novorossiysk was revived in September 1994, and officially reorganised as Novorossiysk Naval Base in 1997. The Russian Federation planned to house the headquarters and the bulk of the fleet there, and undertook a major upgrade of Novorossiysk military facilities starting in 2005 and finishing in 2022.

In April 2010 President Yanukovych renegotiated and extended the Russian leasehold until 2042 and an option for an additional five years until 2047 plus consideration of further renewals. This deal proved controversial in Ukraine. It appeared to violate the constitutional ban on basing foreign military forces, and would eventually lead to high treason charges.

In this regard, relations between Russia and Ukraine over the status of the Fleet continued to be strained. In an August 2009 letter to Russian President Medvedev, Ukrainian President Yushchenko complained about alleged &quot;infringements of bilateral agreements and Ukrainian legislation&quot;

In June 2009, the head of the Security Service of Ukraine said that after 13 December 2009, all officers from the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) represented at the Black Sea Fleet would be required to leave Ukraine. From then, the Security Service of Ukraine would ensure the security of the Black Sea Fleet, including Russian sailors on Ukrainian territory. However, according to the Russian Foreign Ministry, employees of the FSB working at the Black Sea Fleet facilities were to remain on Ukrainian territory &quot;in line with bilateral agreements&quot;. In 2010, based on an agreement between the Ukrainian and Russian governments, military counterintelligence officers from the Federal Security Service returned to the Black Sea Fleet base.

Despite these differences, joint exercises between the Ukrainian Navy and the Black Sea Fleet of Russia resumed with a command-staff exercise in June 2010 after a seven-year interval. In May 2011, Russia and Ukraine resumed their joint &quot;Peace Fairway&quot; (Farvater Mira) naval exercises.

====Georgia in the Fleet partition====
The newly independent nation of Georgia, which also hosted several bases of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet when it was the Georgian SSR, also claimed a share of the Fleet, including 32 naval vessels formerly stationed at Georgia&#x27;s Black Sea port of Poti. Not a CIS member at that time, Georgia was not, however, included in the initial negotiations in January 1992. Additionally, some low-importance bases situated in the Russian-backed breakaway autonomy of Abkhazia soon escaped any Georgian control.

In 1996, Georgia resumed its demands, and the Russian refusal to allot Georgia a portion of the ex-Soviet navy became another bone of contention in the progressively deteriorating Georgian-Russian relations. This time, Ukraine endorsed Tbilisi&#x27;s claims, turning over several patrol boats to the Georgian Navy and starting to train Georgian crews, but was unable to include in the final fleet deal a transfer of the formerly Poti-based vessels to Georgia. Later, the rest of the Georgian share was decided to be ceded to Russia in return for diminution of debt.

Russia employed part of the fleet during the 2008 Georgian conflict. Russian units operating off Abkhazia region resulted in a reported skirmish and sinking of a ship of the Georgian Navy. Since the 2008 South Ossetia war the Russian Black Sea Fleet has not taken part in any joint naval exercises involving Georgian warships. However, such a statement has little meaning since the Georgian Navy has ceased to exist (early 2009 it was merged with the Georgian coast guard).

====Russo-Ukrainian War====
=====Russian annexation of Crimea=====

The 2014 political crisis in Ukraine rapidly engulfed Crimea where pro-Russian separatist sentiment was strong. When the Russian Government determined to seize Crimea, specialist Russian military units appear to have played the central role. In March, the Ukrainians claimed that units of the 18th Motor Rifle Brigade, 31st Air Assault Brigade and 22nd Spetsnaz Brigade were deployed and operating in Crimea, instead of Black Sea Fleet personnel, which violated international agreements signed by Ukraine and Russia. Nevertheless, at minimum the Black Sea Fleet played a supporting role including with respect to preventing the departure of Ukrainian naval vessels from Crimea. Other sources suggested that the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Fleet was also involved.

After the annexation of Crimea, the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the Ukrainian Navy were evicted from their bases and subsequently withdrew from the peninsula. During the occupation, Russian forces seized 54 out of 67 ships of the Ukrainian Navy. According to sources from Black Sea Fleet Headquarters, inspections of all ships were to be done by the end of 2014. On 8 April 2014 an agreement was reached between Russia and Ukraine to return Ukrainian Navy materials to Ukraine proper. The greater portion of the Ukrainian naval ships and vessels were then returned to Ukraine but Russia suspended this process after Ukraine did not renew its unilaterally declared ceasefire on 1 July 2014 in the conflict in the Donbas. According to the fleet commander Aleksandr Vitko, this happened because the vessels were old &quot;and, if used [by Ukraine], could hurt its own people&quot;.

Crimea was then formally annexed into Russia through a referendum, but this was declared invalid by United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262.

=====Strengthening the fleet=====
From that point, Russia proceeded to consolidate its military position in Crimea, which it now regards as an integral part of the Russian Federation, though this position is not one supported by the vast majority of the international community. The Russian seizure of Crimea in 2014 changed the situation and role of the Black Sea Fleet significantly. Analysis undertaken by Micheal Peterson of the US Naval War College suggested that since the Russian seizure of Crimea, the modernization of Russian shore-based assets and of the Black Sea Fleet itself assisted in re-establishing Russian military dominance in the region. Specifically Peterson argued in 2019: &quot;Russian maritime dominance in the Black Sea is back. The shift was made possible by Moscow&#x27;s 2014 seizure of Crimea and subsequent buildup of combat and maritime law enforcement capabilities in the region&quot;.

Prior to the annexation of Crimea, divergent announcements had been made concerning the future composition of the fleet. In June 2010, Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Vladimir Vysotsky announced that Russia was reviewing plans for the naval modernization of the Black Sea Fleet. The plans include 15 new warships and submarines by 2020. These vessels were to partially replace the reported decommissioning of &quot;Kerch,&quot; (decommissioned in 2011 and sunk as a blockship in 2014), several large support ships, and a diesel-electric submarine. Also in 2010, Russian Navy Headquarters sources projected that, by 2020, six frigates of the Project 22350 &quot;Admiral Gorshkov&quot; class, six submarines of Project 677 Lada class, two large landing ships of Project 11711 &quot;Ivan Gren&quot; class and four class-unspecified ships would be delivered. Due to the obsolescence of the Beriev Be-12 by 2015, they were planned to be replaced with Il-38s. Sukhoi Su-24M aircraft were planned to be upgraded to Su-24M2 at the same time.

Since the annexation of Crimea, the composition of the Black Sea Fleet shifted focus to the Improved Kilo-class submarines instead of the Lada, the s and at least three new classes of missile corvettes (the , and Buyan-M classes). The deployment of the &quot;Admiral Gorshkov&quot;-class frigate with the Black Sea Fleet was still anticipated, though in reduced numbers. The replacement of the Black Sea Fleet&#x27;s Soviet-era missile boats and corvettes with vessels of more modern design had been a priority since 2010. A similar modernization is also taking place in the Baltic Fleet and the Caspian Flotilla. Utilizing Russia&#x27;s internal waterways provides the Russian Navy with the capacity to transfer both corvettes and other light units, such as landing craft, among its three western fleets and the Caspian Flotilla as may be required. Analysis in May 2022 suggested that it might be feasible for the Russian Navy even to move its &quot;Kilo&quot;-class submarines between the Black Sea and the Baltic via the internal waterways.

The projection of power into the Mediterranean also returned as a significant role for the Black Sea Fleet with the creation of the Russian Navy&#x27;s permanent task force in the Mediterranean. Both the Black Sea Fleet and the Caspian Flotilla have supported Russian involvement in the Syrian Civil War with units from the former now routinely deployed into the Mediterranean. The deployment of submarines from the Black Sea Fleet to the Mediterranean has become a routine occurrence (though the need to send them for &quot;maintenance&quot; in the Baltic, so as to comply with terms of the Montreux Convention, lengthens the timeframe of such deployments significantly). In late 2021 it was reported that one of the new &quot;Priboy-class&quot; helicopter assault ships, the &quot;Mitrofan Moskalenko&quot;, had been earmarked to enter service with the Black Sea Fleet &quot;within the next few years&quot; in the role of fleet flagship. If confirmed such a deployment would significantly enhance the fleet&#x27;s power projection capabilities.

Also significant is the build-up of Russian surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missile assets in the region. Dmitry Gorenburg of the Centre for Naval Analysis (CNA) has noted in 2018 that: &quot;Russia&#x27;s expanded military footprint in Crimea allows it to carry out a range of operations that it was not capable of prior to 2014. The deployment of S-400, Bastion-P and Bal missiles allows the Russian military to establish an anti-access/area denial zone (A2/AD) covering almost all of the Black Sea. By using a combination of ground-based and ship-based missiles, backed with strong electronic warfare capabilities, the Russian military can inhibit military movement into the Black Sea and deny freedom of action to an opponent if it does make it into the theater. The long-range sea-, air-, and ground-launched missiles deny access, while shorter-range coastal and air defense systems focus on the area denial mission. The result is several interlocking air defense zones&quot;.

, ongoing technological upgrades of this already robust SAM network were planned during the 2020s. Others, such as Michael Kofman of CNA, argued in 2019 that while there is no A2/AD doctrine or term in Russian military strategy, Russian forces nevertheless are organized at an operational and strategic level to deploy a wide range of overlapping defensive and offensive capabilities that extend beyond just one theatre of operations like the Black Sea.

The evident American response to the dense shore-based anti-ship and air defence capabilities that Russia has developed in the Black Sea region, and elsewhere, has been to place greater emphasis on striking at potential Black Sea and other targets utilizing stand-off air-launched cruise missiles deployed on American long-range bombers. Additionally, the United States, the United Kingdom and Turkey have entered into contracts to supply new corvettes, missile-armed fast attack craft, patrol boats and unmanned air vehicles to the Ukrainian Navy.

In 2020, the Black Sea Fleet obtained seven new warships and auxiliary ships, including corvette &quot;Grayvoron&quot;, patrol ship &quot;Pavel Derzhavin&quot;, seagoing tug &quot;Sergey Balk&quot;, as well as a harbour tugs and three hydrographic survey vessels. In 2021, Russian sources said that the same number of vessels should enter service.

=====Russo-Ukrainian naval standoff=====
On 29 January 2021, three US naval vessels entered the Black Sea for the first time in three years. On 1 February, the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky argued for NATO membership for Ukraine. On 19 March, another significant US naval deployment to the Black Sea took place, as cruiser USS &quot;Monterey&quot; and destroyer USS &quot;Thomas Hudner&quot; entered the sea on 19 and 20 March respectively. Prior to the scheduled deployment, on 12 March Russian cruiser &quot;Moskva&quot; made an exit to sea and on 19 March all six submarines of the Black Sea Fleet went to sea, which was an unprecedented event.

Russian ground forces also started a buildup on the border with Ukraine. On 2 April, Zelensky had his first telephone conversation with Biden, and on 6 April he called NATO&#x27;s Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg pressuring NATO to speed up Ukrainian path to the membership. On 8 April, Russia started moving ten of its Caspian Flotilla warships to the Black Sea. Six amphibious and three artillery boats of &quot;Serna&quot; and &quot;Shmel&quot; classes, as well as a hydrographic boat GS-599, were reported in transit, while Black Sea Fleet frigate &quot;Admiral Essen&quot; conducted an artillery exercise, usually done to raise the readiness for the amphibious landing. The same day, the US decided to send two warships to the Black Sea.

On 9 April 2021, tensions rose further and Ukraine promised not to attack the separatists, while Russia considered intervening. On the same day, two Black Sea Fleet corvettes, &quot;Vishny Volochyok&quot; and &quot;Gravoron&quot;, conducted an exercise. The two US destroyers were clarified by Turkey to be USS &quot;Roosevelt&quot; and USS &quot;Donald Cook&quot;, while Putin stressed the importance of the Montreux Convention in a telephone conversation with Turkish president Recep Erdogan. On 14 April, the deployment of the two US destroyers was cancelled. On 17 April, amphibious ships &quot;Aleksandr Otrakovsky&quot; and &quot;Kondoponga&quot; of the Northern Fleet and &quot;Kaliningrad&quot; and &quot;Korolyov&quot; of the Baltic Fleet strengthened the amphibious warfare capabilities of the Black Sea Fleet. On 30 April, the cruiser &quot;Moskva&quot; fired a Vulkan anti-ship missile for the first time.

In November, further tensions started amidst the build-up of Russian ground forces on the Ukraine border. On 2 November, the destroyer USS &quot;Porter&quot; entered the Black Sea, followed on 25 November by the destroyer USS &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;. In late October, the Russian Black Sea fleet held a large exercise with a cruiser, a frigate and three corvettes.

=====Incident with HMS &quot;Defender&quot;=====

On 23 June 2021, the United Kingdom&#x27;s undertook a freedom of navigation patrol through the disputed waters around the Crimean Peninsula. The Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation and border guards said they fired warning shots from coast guard patrol ships and dropped bombs from a Sukhoi Su-24 attack aircraft in the path of &quot;Defender&quot; after, according to the Russian Defence Ministry, it had allegedly strayed for about 20 minutes as far as 3 km (2 miles) into waters off the coast of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014 in a move mostly unrecognised internationally. The UK military denied any warning shots were fired and said the ship was in innocent passage in Ukraine&#x27;s territorial sea, later clarifying that heavy guns were fired three miles astern and could not be considered to be warning shots.

===== 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine =====

A build-up of Russian forces around Ukraine and in Belarus began toward the end of 2021, ostensibly for exercises. In February 2022, the Black Sea Fleet was reinforced by six landing ships: three Ropucha-class landing ships (&quot;Minsk&quot; (127), &quot;Korolev&quot; (130) and &quot;Kaliningrad&quot; (102)) were drawn from the Baltic Fleet while two (&quot;Georgy Pobedonosets&quot; (016) and &quot;Olenegorsky Gornyak&quot; (012)) came from the Northern Fleet. The &quot;Ivan Gren&quot;-class landing ship, &quot;Pyotr Morgunov&quot; (117) also deployed to the Black Sea from the Northern Fleet. The 22nd Army Corps (subordinate to the Black Sea Fleet) was also reinforced, including by the 247th Regiment of the 7th Guards Mountain Air Assault Division as well as by the 56th Guards Air Assault Regiment, subordinate to the same division. On the eve of the conflict, it was reported that the headquarters of the 58th Combined Arms Army had deployed to Crimea commanding between 12 and 17 battalion tactical groups.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February 2022 and it was initially reported that this included an amphibious landing at Odesa by elements of Russian Naval Infantry and the Black Sea Fleet. However, the report of a landing at Odesa on 24 February subsequently proved to be false. On 24 February 2022, the cruiser &quot;Moskva&quot; and the patrol ship &quot;Vasily Bykov&quot; bombarded Snake Island in the Danube Delta and captured it from its Ukrainian garrison. On 26 February 2022 it was reported that Russian forces made an amphibious assault at Mariupol utilizing half of their landing ships in the Black Sea. A second Russian amphibious group was said still to be positioned in the vicinity of Odesa.

On 28 February 2022, Turkey indicated that it was closing the Dardanelles Straits to all foreign warships for the duration of the conflict. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu argued that the move was consistent with terms of the Montreux Convention. An exception would be allowed for Russian ships returning from the Mediterranean to Black Sea bases where they were registered.

As of early March 2022, the Ukrainian navy was confirmed to have lost two vessels: the frigate &quot;Hetman Sahaidachny&quot;, scuttled by its crew to avoid capture, and the patrol vessel &quot;Sloviansk&quot;, reported sunk by Russian action on 3 March 2022. On 7 March 2022 it was reported that the Russian patrol ship &quot;Vasily Bykov&quot; may have been damaged by Ukrainian shore-based multiple-launch rocket fire. However, the ship was subsequently reported as having entered Sevastopol on 16 March 2022 with no obvious damage.

On 14 March 2022, the Russian source RT reported that the Russian Armed Forces had captured about a dozen Ukrainian ships in Berdiansk.

The Russian government claimed the damage was a result of an ammunition explosion. According to the Russian government, everyone on the ship was evacuated. On 14 April, the Russian Ministry of Defence confirmed the ship had sunk. On 15 April, a United States senior defense official confirmed that the ship was hit by two Ukrainian Neptune missiles about 65 nautical miles south of Odesa. On 6 May 2022 a letter from the Black Sea Fleet&#x27;s prosecutor general&#x27;s office to the family of one of the sailors lost on the &quot;Moskva&quot; was made public.

Russia denied the claims. Three days later, a US-backed media outlet carried photographs of the ship unharmed moored at Sevastopol. The ship was also seen with the Pantsir-S mobile surface-to-air missile system on board while docked in Sevastopol.

On 15 May 2022, four Kalibr missiles launched from the Black Sea hit Ukrainian military facilities at Yavoriv, near Lviv. The attack was &quot;probably&quot; carried out by submarines. Lviv region&#x27;s Governor Maxim Kozitsky acknowledged that the target was &quot;completely destroyed&quot;.

The 43rd Guards Naval Assault Aviation Regiment traces its history to the 43rd Fighter Aviation Regiment (:ru:43-й истребительный авиационный полк). The regiment began its formation in May 1938 and was finally formed on 11 or 13 May 1938 in the Kiev Special Military District at Vasylkiv airfield from the 71st, 5th and 109th separate fighter aviation squadrons. It joined the 51st Aviation Brigade of the Air Forces of the Kiev Special Military District.

The regiment&#x27;s first commander from summer 1938 was Vladimir Sryvkin (:ru:Срывкин, Владимир Алексеевич). Major Sryvkin handed over command in 1939 and became assistant commander of the 72nd Fighter Aviation Brigade. In May 1944, he died of wounds received in action.

On 22 June 1941, the regiment was still located at Vasylkiv, forming part of the 36th Fighter Aviation Division of the Air Defence Forces of the Kiev Special Military District.

Over the entire period of its existence, the regiment was repeatedly reorganized and changed its name depending on the honorary titles assigned, awards and changes in the type of aviation:

The 43rd Fighter Aviation Regiment on 9 June 1942 was reorganized into the 43rd Mixed Aviation Regiment. The 43rd Mixed Aviation Regiment was reorganized on 21 June 1942 into the 43rd Fighter Aviation Regiment.[3]

The 43rd Fighter Aviation Sevastopol Red Banner Order of Kutuzov Regiment on 1 April 1960 was renamed the 43rd Aviation Sevastopol Red Banner Order of Kutuzov Regiment of Fighter-Bombers (APIB).

The 43rd Aviation Sevastopol Red Banner Order of Kutuzov Regiment of Fighter-Bombers, after being included in the Air Force of the Red Banner Black Sea Fleet on 1 December 1990, was renamed the 43rd Separate Naval Assault Aviation Sevastopol Red Banner Order of Kutuzov Regiment.

In connection with the reduction of the Russian Air Force, the 43rd Separate Marine Assault Aviation Sevastopol Red Banner Order of Kutuzov Regiment was reorganized on 1 October 1995 into the 43rd Separate Marine Assault Aviation Sevastopol Red Banner Order of Kutuzov Squadron.

In December 2004, the squadron was upgraded to a regiment once again. The 43rd separate naval assault aviation Sevastopol Red Banner Order of Kutuzov Regiment in connection with the ongoing reform of the RF Armed Forces in 2009 was renamed the 7058th Aviation Sevastopol Red Banner Order of Kutuzov Naval Aviation Base of the Russian Federation.

The 43rd separate naval assault aviation Sevastopol Red Banner Order of Kutuzov Naval Aviation Regiment of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation was re-formed in 2014 at the Novofedorovka airfield near the city of Saki.

The regiment was part of the &quot;active army&quot; (in front-line combat service) for six periods between 22 July 1941 and 9 May 1945.

==Incidents==
The Russian Black Sea Fleet&#x27;s (BSF) use of leased facilities in Sevastopol and the Crimea was sometimes controversial. A number of incidents took place:
* For security reasons, the BSF refused to allow Ukrainians to inspect its aircraft cargo, after allegations by Ukrainians that they could be carrying nuclear weapons, which would have infringed upon Ukraine&#x27;s status under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)
* The BSF transported rockets repeatedly through the port of Sevastopol without seeking permission from Ukrainian authorities.
* A lighthouse is located on the headland which, starting in 2005, was the subject of a controversy between Ukraine and Russia. From 3 August 2005, the lighthouse was occupied by the Russian military. Despite a controversial ruling by a Court in Sevastopol on the subject, Russian military officials referred to the fact that they only took orders from the chief of the Russian Navy headquarters and no one else. Ukrainian activists complained that Sarych was illegally occupied by the Russian Navy. As a military facility, the territory around the Sarych headland is closed to trespassers with barbed wire, and the Russian flag flew over Sarych.
* 20 June 2009 – In Sevastopol, a Russian fleet servicemen allegedly used physical force against 30 civilians. The city also alleges contract violations by the Construction Management Corporation of the Black Sea Fleet for not following through on promises to construct requested commercial housing after taking advance payment. The city began talks with the President and the Prime-Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, and also to the Russian Minister of Defense Anatoliy Serdyukov with respect to the contract violations, but those did not yield results.
* On 27 August 2009, Russian marines successfully prevented Ukrainian bailiffs from enforcing a Ukrainian court ruling on seizing lighthouses belonging to the BSF. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry described the Russian obstruction as a &quot;disregard for Ukrainian legislation and international agreements&quot;.
* On 16 April 2013, a &quot;high-ranking Russian Defense Ministry official&quot; complained to Interfax that &quot;Ukraine&#x27;s stubborn position&quot; was slowing the cancellation of customs payments (for the fleet) and that Ukraine still upheld (former) Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko&#x27;s 2008 decrees that banned the &quot;relaxed procedure&quot; of BSF formations crossing the Ukrainian border.
*In the late hours of 13 April 2022 Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych reported &quot;Moskva&quot; was on fire and Odesa governor Maksym Marchenko said their forces hit &quot;Moskva&quot; with two R-360 Neptune anti-ship missiles.
* On 22 September 2023, Ukraine hit the headquarters of the BSF using a Storm Shadow missile, killing at least 6 people.
*on 1 February 2024, Ukraine released video purported to show the sinking of the Tarantul-class vessel &quot;Ivanovets&quot; by unmanned surface vehicle.
*On 5 March 2024, the &quot;Sergey Kotov&quot; patrol vessel was sunk using Magura V5 naval drone.
*On 23 March 2024, The defense forces of Ukraine hit the Russian large amphibious Ropucha-class landing ships &quot;Yamal.&quot; According to Ukraine&#x27;s military intelligence, the &quot;Yamal&quot; warship suffered critical damage: a hole in the upper deck caused it to roll to the starboard side.
*On 19 May 2024, Ukrainian forces destroyed the Project 22800 Karakurt class &quot;Tsiklon&quot; missile corvette in the port of Sevastopol with ATACMS missiles.
*In 12 November 2024, Valery Trankovsky, Captain of the 1st Rank and chief of staff of a missile boat brigade, was killed in a car bomb explosion in Crimea. The Russian government has opened a terrorism investigation.

<text>The Battle of San Domingo was a naval battle of the Napoleonic Wars fought on 6 February 1806 between squadrons of French and British ships of the line off the southern coast of the French-occupied Spanish colonial Captaincy General of Santo Domingo (&quot;San Domingo&quot; in contemporary British English) in the Caribbean.

All five of the French ships of the line commanded by Vice-Admiral Corentin-Urbain Leissègues were captured or destroyed. The Royal Navy led by Vice-Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth lost no ships and suffered fewer than a hundred killed while the French lost approximately 1,500 men. Only a small number of the French squadron were able to escape.

The battle of San Domingo was the last fleet engagement of the war between French and British capital ships in open water.

==Background==

In late 1805, First Lord of the Admiralty Lord Barham withdrew the Royal Navy blockade of the French Atlantic ports following the Trafalgar Campaign, in which the French Navy had lost 14 ships of the line. Barham believed that the French, having suffered such heavy losses, would be unable and unwilling to launch a major offensive in the Atlantic until after the winter. However, he had miscalculated the strength of the fleet at Brest, the principal French Atlantic seaport. 

Taking advantage of the withdrawal of the British blockade, Emperor Napoleon ordered two squadrons to put to sea with orders to raid the British trade routes that crossed the Atlantic. These forces were to inflict as much economic damage to Britain as possible without engaging an equivalent British naval squadron and risking defeat and capture. The cruise was expected to last as long as 14 months, sustained by captured food supplies from British merchant ships. Sailing unopposed on 13 December 1805, the squadrons separated two days later in pursuit of British merchant convoys, one squadron steering for the South Atlantic under Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez and the other, under Vice-Admiral Corentin-Urbain Leissègues, sailing for the Caribbean. The Admiralty in London did not discover that the French had sailed until 24 December, and the two squadrons they prepared in pursuit, under Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Strachan and Rear-Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren, did not sail until January 1806, by which time the French had disappeared into the Atlantic.

There was however one British squadron that had maintained contact with the French: since the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805, the Admiralty had stationed a squadron under Vice-Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth off Cadiz to watch the remnants of the combined fleet. In November 1805, reports reached Duckworth of a French squadron operating against British convoys off the Savage Islands between Madeira and the Canary Islands. This squadron, which belonged to Contre-Admiral Zacharie Allemand, had left France in July 1805. Immediately sailing to investigate, Duckworth abandoned Cadiz, leaving just two frigates to watch the Allied fleet at anchor. Passing the Savage and Canary Islands, Duckworth continued to the Cape Verde Islands before conceding that the French had escaped him and turning northwards again. Allemand was already far to the north. He eventually returned to France without incident on 23 December.

===Duckworth&#x27;s cruise===
During his return journey to Cadiz, on 23 December Duckworth encountered under Captain Charles Brisbane escorting a small group of merchant ships. Leissègues had intercepted, chased and dispersed Brisbane&#x27;s convoy in the Bay of Biscay on 15 December, Brisbane retaining only the largest merchant ships to help cover the flight of the smaller vessels. Once he had escaped Leissègues&#x27; pursuit, Brisbane sailed in search of support at Cadiz, continuing southwards after realizing that Duckworth was not at his appointed station. Immediately setting a course that he believed would intercept Leissègues, Duckworth turned to the northwest and on 25 December discovered an enemy squadron approximately northwest of the Canary Islands. Duckworth ordered his squadron to pursue, the chase lasting throughout the day and continuing into 26 December, by which time it had become clear that his quarry was not Allemand. In fact, Duckworth had discovered Willaumez&#x27;s squadron. However, the French admiral ordered his ships to run before Duckworth rather than give battle. By 13:00 on 26 December, it seemed certain that the British flagship, , Captain Richard Goodwin Keats, would outstrip the rearmost French ship, when Duckworth suddenly called off the pursuit. He later claimed that he was concerned that the leading ships of his squadron would be overwhelmed by the concentrated French squadron before the stragglers, some of which were more than behind &quot;Superb&quot;, could join the battle.

As Willaumez escaped into the South Atlantic, Duckworth ordered his squadron to sail for Barbados to resupply before making the long journey back to Cadiz. When he arrived on 12 January 1806, he ordered the frigate to St. Kitts to arrange the required water supplies, and moved the squadron to an anchorage off Basseterre on 19 January. There two ships of the Leeward Islands squadron, and , joined him. &quot;Northumberland&quot; was the flagship of Rear-Admiral Alexander Cochrane, commander of the station. Cochrane&#x27;s arrival raised the number of admirals in the squadron to three, as Duckworth&#x27;s second in command was Rear-Admiral Thomas Louis in . Leissègues was also &quot;en route&quot; to the Caribbean, winter storms off the Azores having delayed him, separated &quot;Alexandre&quot; and &quot;Brave&quot; and inflicted damage on &quot;Jupiter&quot; and . Arriving at the French-held city of Santo Domingo on the island of Hispaniola on 20 January, Leissègues disembarked over 1,000 soldiers as reinforcements for the garrison, and made hasty repairs as he awaited the arrival of his missing ships, which appeared on 29 January. During his time in the harbour, Leissègues moved ashore and gave orders for the ships to be recaulked following their Atlantic voyage, a difficult and time-consuming process.

On 1 February the small sloop arrived at Basseterre with information that three French ships of the line had been sighted off Santo Domingo. Duckworth gave orders for the fleet to sail immediately. On 3 February the brig joined him at St. Thomas and on 5 February the frigate under Captain Adam Mackenzie joined near the Mona Passage. Mackenzie was accompanied by a Danish schooner that had sailed from Santo Domingo a few days before, and whose crew were able to provide a detailed account of the French squadron&#x27;s composition. Before the schooner had sailed, a number of French officers had commented on the risk involved in allowing the vessel to leave port, but the admiral had refused their demands that he burn the Danish ship. Duckworth was now confident that he outnumbered and outgunned Leissègues. During the night of 5 February the British squadron slowly approached Santo Domingo, &quot;Acasta&quot; and &quot;Magicienne&quot; scouting ahead of the main fleet.

==Battle==
===Duckworth&#x27;s attack===
At 06:00 on 6 February Duckworth&#x27;s scouts sighted the French, observing two frigates, five ships of the line and one large merchant ship anchored in line at the entrance to Santo Domingo. Leissègues had reportedly issued orders for the squadron to sail for Jamaica, even though several of the French ships were not yet ready for sea, and two frigates were already under sail when the British arrived. Leissègues was not aboard &quot;Impérial&quot;; he and a number of his officers were still conducting their business in the town and were therefore forced to join the squadron in small boats, which delayed the squadron. Several officers, possibly including Leissègues, did not reach their ships until after the engagement had begun. Recognising that his enemy was in a vulnerable position, Duckworth raised all sail in an effort to close with the French. Leissègues too recognised the danger his ships were in and ordered them to raise anchor and then to sail westwards along the coast in the direction of Nizao. Maintaining close formation, the French formed a line of battle, Captain Pierre-Elie Garreau in &quot;Alexandre&quot; leading, with &quot;Impérial&quot;, &quot;Diomède&quot;, &quot;Jupiter&quot; and &quot;Brave&quot; following. The frigates and corvette took a position between the battle line and the shore. Duckworth was concerned that there might be other French forces to the west. He therefore angled his line of attack to pass across the front of the French line and signaled to his squadron to direct their fire at the front three ships: &quot;Alexandre&quot;, &quot;Impérial&quot; and &quot;Diomède&quot;.
At 08:00 Duckworth&#x27;s ships divided into two divisions, a westerly line to windward under Duckworth with &quot;Superb&quot;, &quot;Northumberland&quot;, and , and an eastern line under Louis with &quot;Canopus&quot;, and &quot;Atlas&quot;. The British frigates were gathered in formation to the west of the British lines, awaiting orders to assist if required. Over the next two hours the British slowly closed with the French squadron, the British divisions breaking up as the faster ships outpaced the slower. Louis&#x27; squadron fell behind Duckworth&#x27;s, while &quot;Agamemnon&quot; dropped behind the other three vessels in her division, which otherwise remained in a tight formation. A slight shift in the wind allowed Leissègues to adjust his direction to the southwest, but the close presence of the land restricted French movements. Keats and his crew having accompanied Nelson in the pursuit of Villeneuve to the West Indies were still lamenting having missed Trafalgar. Keats silently suspended a portrait of Nelson from the mizzen stay before addressing the men in a manner intended to encourage enthusiasm for the cause in the coming battle. With the band playing ‘God save the King’ and ‘Nelson of the Nile’ the Superb having made up all ground on the fleeing enemy fired her starboard broadside as she was laid up against the Imperiale, the largest ship in the French navy before the conflict became general. In a few minutes Northumberland was engaged with the Alexandre and Imperiale, quickly followed by the Spencer who made the Diomede her more immediate opponent.
Leissègues&#x27; flagship &quot;Impérial&quot; carried 120 guns to &quot;Northumberland&quot;&#x27;s 74, but Cochrane engaged closely, rapidly supported by &quot;Spencer&quot;, which opened fire on &quot;Impérial&quot; and &quot;Diomède&quot; simultaneously. For 15 minutes the British continued to close, both squadrons sailing westwards along the coast with the wind. At 10:25, the damaged &quot;Alexandre&quot; suddenly swung out of the line in an attempt to drive between &quot;Spencer&quot; and &quot;Northumberland&quot; and rake them both. Captain Robert Stopford on &quot;Spencer&quot; responded rapidly, turning across &quot;Alexandre&quot;&#x27;s bow and raking her, before pulling along the opposite side of Garreau&#x27;s &quot;Alexandre&quot; and opening fire from close range. In the smoke and confusion neither &quot;Superb&quot; nor &quot;Northumberland&quot; noticed &quot;Spencer&quot;&#x27;s move; both fired several shots into &quot;Spencer&quot; before they realized their mistake. With &quot;Spencer&quot; and &quot;Alexandre&quot; out of the way, &quot;Impérial&quot; was able to engage both of the leading British ships, threatening to overwhelm them. Cochrane moved to defend the flagship by pulling &quot;Northumberland&quot; between &quot;Impérial&quot; and &quot;Superb&quot;, suffering terrible damage but preserving Duckworth&#x27;s ship intact. &quot;Impérial&quot;&#x27;s fire was so heavy that several shot passed straight through &quot;Northumberland&quot; into &quot;Superb&quot;.

===Destruction of the French rear===
As the combat raged at the head of the line, the remainder of both squadrons strained to join the battle. The British eastern division under Louis reached the battling &quot;Alexandre&quot; and &quot;Spencer&quot; at 10:35, the two ships locked together to the south of the main engagement. As they passed, &quot;Canopus&quot;, &quot;Donegal&quot;, and &quot;Atlas&quot; all raked the French ship, bringing down her masts and leaving her crippled. &quot;Canopus&quot; then steered directly towards the battle around &quot;Impérial&quot;, as &quot;Donegal&quot; and &quot;Atlas&quot; turned northwest to intercept &quot;Brave&quot; and &quot;Jupiter&quot; respectively. At 11:00, &quot;Spencer&quot; followed &quot;Canopus&quot; while &quot;Alexandre&quot;″s crew were preoccupied with extinguishing a fire that had broken out on board. &quot;Alexandre&quot; was so badly damaged that she was unable to either escape or continue the action; she formally surrendered ten minutes later.

Captain Pulteney Malcolm on &quot;Donegal&quot; attacked &quot;Brave&quot; directly, firing his starboard guns and then crossing &quot;Brave&quot;&#x27;s stern, inflicting severe damage with a raking broadside, before pulling alongside again and engaging from close range. Badly damaged, &quot;Brave&quot; surrendered. Malcolm then ordered Captain Richard Dunn in &quot;Acasta&quot; to take possession as &quot;Donegal&quot; moved forward to engage &quot;Jupiter&quot;. With &quot;Donegal&quot; alongside &quot;Jupiter&quot;, Captain Samuel Pym in &quot;Atlas&quot; abandoned his brief engagement with the French ship and steered for the melee surrounding the increasingly isolated &quot;Impérial&quot;. Taking advantage of his ship&#x27;s superior speed, Malcolm pulled ahead of &quot;Jupiter&quot; and then rammed her bow, securing the ships together to prevent the French vessel from escaping. Recognising that further resistance was hopeless, Captain Gaspard Laignel surrendered immediately. Malcolm then sent 100 men on board as a prize crew and attached a towline to the French ship, just as the trailing &quot;Agamemnon&quot; finally reached the battle.

===Leissègues drives ashore===
Under the shroud of heavy smoke that confused the positions and identities of the ships at the head of the line, manoeuvering became hazardous: &quot;Atlas&quot; fired two broadsides into &quot;Impérial&quot; as she arrived and then raked the French flagship before her tiller jammed just as &quot;Diomède&quot; loomed out the smoke. Receiving a heavy broadside from the French ship, &quot;Atlas&quot; subsequently collided with &quot;Canopus&quot; as she too appeared immediately ahead, tearing off her bowsprit in the collision. Turning back into the battle, &quot;Atlas&quot; engaged &quot;Diomède&quot; at close range as the rest of the British squadron concentrated their fire on the beleaguered &quot;Impérial&quot;, with the exception of the damaged &quot;Northumberland&quot;, which was drifting out of the line.

With his main and mizzen masts collapsed and escape impossible, Leissègues turned his ship towards the shore at 11:30, outdistancing the fire from the drifting &quot;Northumberland&quot; and leaving &quot;Superb&quot; behind, Duckworth reluctant to risk his ship in the shallow coastal shoals. &quot;Canopus&quot; maintained the pressure, pursuing the French flagship until it was clear at 11:40 that &quot;Impérial&quot; was hard aground on a coral reef, less than a mile from the beach. &quot;Diomède&quot;, under attack by &quot;Atlas&quot; and the recently returned &quot;Spencer&quot;, followed &quot;Impérial&quot; ashore. As they struck the reef, both French ships lost their remaining masts and suffered severe damage to their hulls. Their crews then gathered on deck and made preparations to abandon ship as the British squadron pulled back out of range of fire from the shore. During the engagement the French frigates and corvette had all slipped between the battling squadrons and the shoreline and escaped to the westwards. The British frigates were too preoccupied with boarding and towing prizes to initiate a chase.

===Destruction of &quot;Impérial&quot; and &quot;Diomède&quot;===
As Duckworth gathered his squadron, &quot;Northumberland&quot;&#x27;s mainmast collapsed across the deck, causing severe damage to the ship&#x27;s fittings. Although Cochrane&#x27;s flagship was the most severely damaged of the squadron, all had suffered to a degree: &quot;Superb&quot;&#x27;s men counted 60 shot holes while &quot;Atlas&quot; was out of control and &quot;Donegal&quot; had lost one of her topmasts. Casualties were also distributed throughout the fleet, with &quot;Northumberland&quot; and &quot;Spencer&quot; suffering the worst and &quot;Atlas&quot; the least except for the barely engaged &quot;Agamemnon&quot;. Total losses were 74 killed and 264 wounded and several ships were damaged, but Duckworth was rapidly able to effect repairs as his ships remained on station to observe the situation ashore.

&quot;Impérial&quot; and &quot;Diomède&quot; had both run aground between Nizao and Point Catalan, their hulls broadside to the beach and their bottoms stove in by the reefs that lay offshore. Using the remaining ship&#x27;s boats and with assistance from the shore, the wounded and survivors were ferried to the beach. These operations continued uninterrupted until 8 February, when Duckworth sent boats from &quot;Acasta&quot; and &quot;Magicienne&quot; to the wrecks. Boarding unopposed, the boat parties removed the remaining French crewmen as prisoners and set both ships on fire to deny their potential use to the French, although Leissègues had in fact already issued orders for them to be burnt once the last men had been evacuated. Her captain, Jean-Baptiste Henry, was among the 150 prisoners the British took from &quot;Diomède&quot;. By contrast, the British found only six men still aboard &quot;Impérial&quot;, none of them officers. French casualties in the engagement were very heavy, with over 500 men estimated to have been killed or wounded on &quot;Impérial&quot; alone and over 1,000 additional casualties shared among the rest of the fleet. &quot;Jupiter&quot; had not been severely damaged in the engagement and &quot;Brave&quot;, although damaged in the hull, was in a sailing condition. Both ships had surrendered early in the engagement after losing their captains killed or wounded, in the initial exchanges. &quot;Alexandre&quot;, by contrast, was a shattered wreck. Her British prize crew only just prevented the gaping holes smashed in her hull from sinking her.

Duckworth was fortunate to have with him captains on the &quot;Superb&quot;, &quot;Canopus&quot;, &quot;Spencer&quot;, and &quot;Donegal&quot; who had all been part of Nelson&#x27;s Mediterranean fleet and who worked instinctively together, feeling no need to wait for any direction from the Admiral - for little was forthcoming.

Duckworth remained at anchor off Santo Domingo for several more days until his entire squadron and their prizes were ready for the voyage to Jamaica, sending Commander Nathaniel Day Cochrane to Britain in &quot;Kingfisher&quot; with the official despatches. Admiral Cochrane separated from the fleet on the day of departure and &quot;Northumberland&quot; and &quot;Agamemnon&quot; sailed for Barbados in case other French forces should appear in the Leeward Islands while the main fleet was repairing at Jamaica. Duckworth was received at Jamaica with &quot;rapturous acknowledgments&quot; and his prizes were refitted for the journey back to Britain. In the event, &quot;Brave&quot; foundered off the Azores with the loss of three men, and &quot;Alexandre&quot; was too badly damaged for further service, being broken up on arrival. Only &quot;Jupiter&quot;, renamed HMS &quot;Maida&quot; after the recent French defeat at the battle of Maida in Italy, had any continued career in the Royal Navy. The only surviving French ships, the frigates &quot;Comète&quot; and &quot;Félicité&quot;, and the corvette &quot;Diligente&quot; all returned to France without incident over the following months.

==Aftermath==
The victory, just four months after the success at Trafalgar, was celebrated in Britain and across the Empire, particularly in the Caribbean. Mere rumours of Leissègues&#x27; presence had stifled trade and caused panic among the merchant houses of the West Indies and Duckworth&#x27;s victory helped to restore confidence in commercial ocean travel once more. In Britain both the House of Commons and the House of Lords voted their thanks to the entire squadron when Duckworth&#x27;s account of the action was read out, the motions led by Lord Grenville and Charles Grey, who both made expansive speeches in praise of Duckworth. Head money, a bounty on enemy servicemen killed, wounded or captured, was paid for 4,268 men, even though records showed that the French fleet carried significantly fewer men than that. Additional prize money was paid for the captured &quot;Jupiter&quot; and awards of money, ceremonial plate and ornate swords were made by patriotic societies and Lloyd&#x27;s of London insurers. Admiral Louis was made a baronet and Cochrane a Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath, while a number of promotions were distributed among the first lieutenants. Duckworth, however, received nothing beyond his share of the general rewards. Vice-Admiral Lord Collingwood, commander in chief of the Mediterranean, was furious that Duckworth had deserted his post off Cadiz, failed to bring Willaumez to battle in December and then sailed for the West Indies to resupply rather than returning to the Spanish coast. Historians William James and William Laird Clowes both considered that if Duckworth had not defeated Leissègues he would probably have faced a court martial. Duckworth&#x27;s absence forced Collingwood to divert some of his own ships to the Cadiz blockade. The force provided still proved inadequate – on 26 February a French frigate squadron broke out of the port and escaped to Rochefort. Collingwood&#x27;s influence was enough to block additional rewards to Duckworth, who subsequently returned to the Mediterranean and in 1807 commanded the fleet at the ineffectual Dardanelles Operation. Over four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.

In France, the government press misrepresented the battle. &quot;Le Moniteur Universel&quot; published a report purportedly written by Captain Raymond Cocault of the corvette &quot;Diligente&quot;. The report began by inaccurately claiming that the British squadron consisted of nine ships of the line. The report concluded with the information that two British ships had been destroyed on the San Domingo coast alongside three French and that two others had been dismasted and were badly damaged. The official French report, written by Leissègues but not published in France, contradicted this version of events. Leissègues stated that Cocault, with the other smaller warships, had made all sail to the westwards at the start of the engagement and that by the time the flagship drove ashore, &quot;Diligente&quot; was already out of sight. Leissègues remained on Santo Domingo for some time, but had returned to Europe by the time the colony fell to a joint British and Spanish force in July 1809. He later received a regional command in the Ionian Sea and took part in the Adriatic campaign.

The Atlantic campaign continued throughout the spring and summer. Willaumez was able to avoid the British squadrons searching for him by remaining deep in the South Atlantic. However, on 13 March 1806 the British under Warren intercepted and defeated an unrelated French squadron under Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois while he was returning from the Indian Ocean. Eventually forced north in search of additional food supplies, Willaumez entered the Caribbean, where he hoped to intercept the Jamaica convoy to Britain. The disobedience of one of his own captains foiled Willaumez&#x27;s plan and he ordered his squadron to its final cruising ground, off Newfoundland. On 18 August 1806, while it was deep in the Central Atlantic, a ferocious hurricane caught the squadron and scattered it. Willaumez eventually found shelter in Havana; a number of his ships reached ports in the United States, some too badly damaged to ever sail again. Only four of the 11 ships of the line that left Brest in December 1805 ever returned to France. San Domingo was the last fleet battle of the Wars to be fought in open water; the only subsequent engagement between fleets was the Battle of Basque Roads, fought in the narrow, shallow waters at the mouth of the river Charente.

<text>The United States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act (1998) was a bill proposed in the United States Congress to help refine the political status of Puerto Rico. The senior sponsor of the bill was Representative Don Young, Republican of Alaska. While a version was approved in the House, it failed to reach a vote in the Senate.

==Definition==
The bill offered Puerto Ricans four options for their political future: statehood, independence, associated republic, or the current commonwealth status. The project proposed to carry out a referendum in which the people of Puerto Rico could choose the option they preferred.

==Controversy==
The proposal was controversial in Puerto Rican politics for several reasons. Governor Pedro Rosselló and Resident Commissioner Carlos Romero Barceló, two avid supporters of statehood, were advocates of the legislation, and thus the bill was seen with suspicion by non-statehooders. Second, the legislation seemed to favor unchangeable status choices over commonwealth status, and the Commonwealth option in the bill defined Puerto Rico as a &quot;territory subject to the supreme powers of the U.S. Congress.&quot; The Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico (PPD) disagreed with this definition, stating that it portrayed the island as a colony of the United States, and not as a true commonwealth or free associated state (&quot;estado libre associado&quot;) between two nations. The PPD opposed the bill.

The positions regarding Puerto Rican status within the U.S. National Parties are not monolithic. Overall, the national Democratic Party identifies mostly with Commonwealth supporters, with minorities favoring statehood or independence. The Republican Party are also conflicted. Nearly every presidential candidate for the Republican party has endorsed statehood; but many legislators worry about the potential for a Spanish-speaking majority state of Puerto Rico to tip the balance of power in congress. Some welcome the fiscal benefits of detaching the island from the U.S.

The travails of H.R. 856 in the House of Representatives exemplifies the hurdles from conservative and liberal members that any status choice by Puerto Rico will face in Congress. The bill was introduced by conservative representative Gerald Solomon (Republican – New York or R-NY). The following amendments, many by liberal NY and IL congressman were debated:
* Solomon: sought English be declared the official language of U.S. Substituted by Burton (R-IN) which encouraged English proficiency for all Puerto Ricans by age 10. Passed 240–177.
* Gutierrez (Democrat- Illinois or D-IL); made Spanish official language of Puerto Rico. Failed 13–406.
* Serrano (D-NY); allow U.S. citizens born in island but residing outside of Puerto Rico to vote in referendums; failed 57–356.
* Serrano (D-NY): allow persons with one parent born in Puerto Rico to vote in referendum; failed by voice vote.
* Gutierrez (D-NY): Congress recognizes Puerto Rico is sociologically and culturally a Caribbean and Latin American nation with a distinctive culture that has Spanish as a common language; failed by voice vote.
* Stearns (R-FL): required a run-off referendum within 90 days between 2 options which received most votes; failed: 28–384
* Gutierrez (D-IL): delete language in the findings section of the bill which references the Treaty of Paris; Failed by voice vote.
* Barr (R-GA): require the approval of statehood by a super-majority of 75% of the valid votes cast. failed: 131–282
* Velazquez (D-NY): add language to the findings section of the bill recognizing the separate and distinct nature of Puerto Rican citizenship in relation to U.S. citizenship. Failed by voice vote.
* Gutierrez (D-IL): allow Puerto Rico to retain its separate Olympic Committee and to compete under its own flag and national anthem in international athletic competitions; failed: 2–413
* Gutierrez (D-IL): retain certain corporate tax provisions for Puerto Rico for 20 years after statehood and exempt Puerto Ricans from U.S. federal tax until the State of Puerto Rico achieves same per capita income as the State with next lowest per capita income. Failed by voice vote.

Ultimately, Puerto Rico, while under the PNP leadership of Governor Rosselló, held a status referendum in December 1998, using criteria from the Bill, despite the lack of a Bill&#x27;s approval. The PPD opposed the referendum unless different wording was used for the Commonwealth option. The PNP pointed out that any such status change would require congressional approval, and at least the Bill&#x27;s terminology had mustered House support. In response, the PPD urged Puerto Ricans to choose the &quot;None of the Above&quot; option, as a means to reject the offered status choices. The success of this option in the polls while expressing disapproval, does not express a preference among the Bill&#x27;s options.

<text>The People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral (; &quot;People&#x27;s Redemption Cathedral&quot; a better translation of the name), also known as the National Cathedral (), is an Eastern Orthodox cathedral under construction in Bucharest to serve as the patriarchal cathedral of the Romanian Orthodox Church. It is located in central Bucharest on Spirea&#x27;s Hill (Arsenal Square), facing the same courtyard as the Palace of Parliament which is the heaviest building in the world, the cathedral having a one-tenth of its weight and about one-fifth of its volume. Situated behind the Palace of Parliament, this will make it 50 metres taller than the Palace, and will help to make the cathedral an iconic landmark in the city. The People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral to height (ground-cross), holds a dominant position in Bucharest&#x27;s cityscape, being visible from all approaches to the city.

It is the tallest and largest Eastern Orthodox church building by volume, and area, in the world. The People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral will have the largest collection of church mosaics in the world (interior decoration) when it is completed, having about 18,000 square meters, including the mosaic of the altar is about 3,000 square meters. The mosaic of the National Cathedral contains glass tesserae from Venice, and Carrara stone from Pietrasanta, Italy. Also the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral has the world&#x27;s largest Orthodox iconostasis (23.8 meters length and 17.1 meters height) and the world&#x27;s largest free-swinging church bell.

The cathedral is dedicated to the Ascension of Christ, which in Romania is celebrated as the Heroes&#x27; Day, and to Saint Andrew the Apostle, protector of Romania. The cathedral was consecrated on 25 November 2018 by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Bartholomew I, Patriarch Daniel of Romania and Metropolitan Chrysostomos (gr) of Patras from the Greek Orthodox Church. On the same day as the consecration, the very first church service of the cathedral took place and was led by both Patriarch Bartholomew and Patriarch Daniel. The first patronal feast of the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral was celebrated on 30 November, on the day of &#x27;Saint Andrew the First Called&#x27;, and the Liturgy was officiated by Patriarch Theophilos III of Jerusalem and Patriarch Daniel of Romania. The first &quot;Te Deum&quot; of the cathedral was celebrated on 1 December 2018.

== History ==
=== Background ===
The idea of a national cathedral first emerged following the Romanian War of Independence (1877–1878), which was mainly fought between the Russian and Ottoman Empires. The church was to symbolise the victory of Orthodox Christians over the Ottoman Muslims. The idea was shelved for lack of consensus on design, location and funding. The Unification of the Romanian Principalities in 1859, entailed a unitary organisation of church structures in Moldavia and Wallachia within the Holy Synod (1872), thus the assembly of hierarchs increased to 12 members, including: the Primate Metropolitan (chairman), the Metropolitan of Moldavia and their suffragan bishops of Râmnic, Buzău, Argeș, Roman, Huși and Lower Danube (Galați) and one auxiliary vicar-bishop for every diocese. The old Metropolitan Cathedral had proved overcrowded, especially during the national holidays, such as the Proclamation of the Kingdom of Romania and the crowning of King Carol I of Romania (10 May 1881), when none of the over one hundred churches in Bucharest was able to receive those who would have wanted to participate in the official service. Therefore, at King Carol I&#x27;s desire, Romania&#x27;s Assembly of Deputies and the Senate voted in favour of the Law no. 1750 on the construction of the Cathedral Church in Bucharest, promulgated by King Carol I on 5 June 1884.

On 10 May 1920, King Ferdinand I sent a royal letter to Archbishop Miron Cristea, the first Metropolitan-Primate of Greater Romania, supporting the project, but this had no effect. In 1925, after the Romanian Orthodox Church became an independent patriarchate, Metropolitan Cristea now newly enthroned as the first Patriarch of All Romania, suggested Carol Park as a site, but Bibescu Vodă Square (&quot;Unirii Square&quot;) was chosen instead. There, in 1929, a cross (calvary) was raised. Lack of funds meant the construction was postponed and later forgotten.

Patriarch Teoctist was the one who re-launched the project of building a National Cathedral, in this sense sanctifying a cross on 5 February 1999 as the cornerstone of the future cathedral, in the place of Unirii Square that had previously been sanctified by Patriarch Miron Cristea. Meanwhile, there had been an epochal event, which was the visit by Pope John Paul II to Romania (7–9 May 1999).

On 16 February 2005, the Bucharest City Hall proposed to the Patriarchate &quot;as the most suitable place to be available&quot; for the structure, which was the Arsenal Hill, considered the highest place in Bucharest. Following the Patriarchate&#x27;s approval, the Government of Romania promoted the Ordinance no.19/17 March 2005 for the building of the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral. Then the Chamber of Deputies voted to give the building site of 110,000 m2 to Romanian Patriarchate by the protocol of 13 February 2006. The Arsenal Hill was recommended after three other locations were proposed at different stages (Piața Unirii 1999, Alba Iulia Square 2001, Carol Park 2004). Three churches were demolished (&quot;Alba Postăvari&quot;, &quot;Spirea Veche&quot;, and &quot;Izvorul Tămăduirii&quot;), and two churches had been moved (&quot;Schitul Maicilor&quot; and &quot;Mihai Vodă&quot;), by the communist regime to build civic centre and the Palace of the Parliament, previously known as the House of the People (Romanian: &quot;Casa Poporului&quot;). The cornerstone for the construction of the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral was sanctified on 29 November 2007, being officiated by Patriarch Daniel the sixth Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church.

Building began in 2010, and after almost a decade of construction, the cathedral was consecrated on 25 November 2018. The consecration was held in presence of 100 priests including 60 bishops, where the special guests were the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Bartholomew I and Metropolitan Chrysostomos of Patras. Approximately 55,000 people attended at the Divine Liturgy which took place inside the cathedral just after its consecration.

=== Name ===
Metropolitan-primate Miron Cristea proposed the name of the cathedral on 10 May 1920, when spoke in front of the Holy Synod and King Ferdinand, about building a People&#x27;s Cathedral meant to celebrate the birth of Greater Romania. &quot;Will prove to be a visible symbol of our unity in faith and law&quot; metropolitan-primate Miron explained, and King Ferdinand took the floor referred to a Church of Redemption, while Metropolitan Pimen Georgescu resorted to another phrasing mentioning People&#x27;s Redemption Church. The Romanian word &quot;&quot;neam&quot; is difficult to translate in English, because the term people does not convey properly the sense of unity of blood and lineage that &quot;neam&quot; suggests, and it is perhaps better expressed by formulas like ethnic nation or kin. The national identity is a kind of ancestor worship, a system of kinship in which national heroes occupy the place of clan elders in defining a nation as a noble lineage. The word &quot;mântuire&quot; just like &quot;neam&quot;&quot; specifically Romanian, is also a complex term. Even though it is commonly translated as salvation, it retains a spiritual nuance that makes redemption a better alternative. Patriarch Daniel explained in 2008 the choice of name at the symposium &quot;New Patriarchal Cathedral&quot;, saying: &quot;this name is a manifestation of gratitude or thanksgiving brought to God for the deliverance of the Romanian nation from oppression and alienation&quot;.

=== Feast days ===
The Ascension of God is the first celebration of the day, because it is also the day of the Romanian heroes of all time and of all places, and the second is the celebration of Saint Apostle Andrew the first called, Protector of Romania. Patriarch Daniel said about the first celebration: &quot;The homage to the memory of the Romanian heroes during World War I, who fought for national freedom, unity and dignity, must be today a source of inspiration and renewal for patriotic Romanians. That is why, the main dedication of the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral is the Lord&#x27;s Ascension when we celebrate the Day of Heroes. Thus, besides the practical necessity of the future National Cathedral, this is also a national spiritual symbol, being dedicated to the worship of those who have sacrificed themselves for the defense of the homeland and the Orthodox ancestral faith and for the freedom of the Romanian people&quot;. Patriarch Daniel said about the second celebration: &quot;This building will be a symbol of national unity because the feast of Saint Apostle Andrew, which was placed the day before the National Day on 1 December, shows that the national unity has settled with us on the Romanians primarily on spiritual unity, on unity of faith, thought and sentiment. Our church greatly contributed to the development of the Romanian language and Romanian culture.&quot;

=== Construction ===
Romanian Patriarchy launched on 28 December 2009 the tender for the selection of the project of the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral. The design proposal should include the feasibility study (SF) and the technical documentation for the construction authorization (DTAC). The delivery term of the documentation accompanied by the proposed model layout was established on 31 May 2010. In June, the Patriarchal Commission for coordination and verification of design works, together with the technical subcommittees for evaluation on architecture, resilience and facilities specialties analyzed the projects presented and determined the scores obtained by the participants. Later, between 30 June and 1 July (2010), the commission of final evaluation of projects under the chairmanship of Patriarch Daniel met at the Patriarchal Palace. Vanel Exim based in Bacău was chosen for the architectural design of the cathredal. On 2 September 2010, the building&#x27;s construction permit was obtained. To begin the cathedral&#x27;s construction, 24 notices were needed from various state institutions and the city hall of Bucharest. The works officially started on 15 December 2010, with the breakdown of the axes of the building.

In December 2010 – June 2011, the company Foretis Inject executed the 80-centimeter thick mulled walls of foundation up to 15.8 meters deep (north-south walls), and the company Lufin Construct excavated 90 thousand cubic meters of soil from the foundation. On the higher north–south walls, the anchorages were mounted on three levels, on the shorter east–west walls were mounted two-level anchorages, and the last level of anchorages is located below the groundwater level. The hanger rods have a 75 degree inclination towards the foundation wall, and the fastening was made with the help of 750 concrete-drilled anchorages by the Italian company CasaGrande.

On 28 June 2011, the contract with Bog&#x27;Art company for the construction of the building&#x27;s foundation was concluded. In July 2011 – April 2013, the cathedral was built up to the nave floor of 6.8 meters from the ground. The deep foundation is a 120-meter-long monoblock structure, composed of a network of concrete beams and was imposed to avoid sliding the foundation to earthquakes. The foundation was built between December 2011 - June 2012 and the basement until April 2013. The main building of the cathedral is designed as a structure independent from the walls surrounding foundation, moving like a piston in a cylinder. Around the foundation between the lead tank and mulled walls, an 8-centimeter insulation of expanded polystyrene is arranged, which allows the cathedral&#x27;s movement in all parts to the earthquake.

For the waterproofing of the cathedral, Bog&#x27;Art engineering team together with Swiss engineer Franco Sticher conducted many tests over three months in Romania and Switzerland. Were tested the bitumen foil, bentonite foil, polyurethane foil and lead foil. Due to the corrosion indestructibility, the whole foundation of cathedral was dressed in a lead tank. In November–December 2011, over 120 welders welded 10 thousand square meters lead foils. About 400 tons of lead were used horizontally (4 mm thick) and vertically (3 mm thick) in the cathedral&#x27;s foundation. Lead has a high plastic deformation capacity without breaking, required quality under conditions of the building massiveness. It is used in high-voltage power cables as shell material and as a protective sheath for underground or underwater cables, to prevent water diffusion into insulation.

On 22 July 2013, the contract was concluded with the Austrian company Strabag for the construction of the building&#x27;s superstructure. In June 2015, the height of the structure was raised by more than half. To the achievement of vaults, the upper part of nave and dome for not putting pressure on the nave&#x27;s floor, a metal scaffolding structure weighing 1100 tons was installed in the form of trapezium with base at 27 meters and gradually raised up to 45 meters.

For the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral were used 145 thousand cubic meters of heavy concrete, about 40 thousand tons of reinforcement and 22 thousand tons of bricks, bringing the weight of the cathedral to about 420 thousand tons, over the weight of Saint Isaac&#x27;s cathedral of 322 thousand tons, and at the same time it is the heaviest Eastern Orthodox Church building. For the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral was used about 12% of the quantity of concrete and steel used in the Palace of Parliament. The concrete used (C40/50) for the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral is same concrete used for the Vidraru Dam, which showed its resistance to the 1977 earthquake without any crack. The thickest rebar used in reinforced cement concrete (RCC) is BTS500-S of 32 millimeters diameter.

Were used 6,200 cubic meters of solid bricks produced at Câmpulung Muscel and 7,800 cubic meters hollow bricks produced at Târgu Jiu. For solid bricks, was used clay from the Grui hill near Câmpulung Muscel. The bricks used are absorbent, so that with the application of the first layer of plaster, due to the brick&#x27;s porosity there is adhesion between the mortar layer and brick. When the bricks are hit they make a glass sound. The cathedral wall from outside to inside has the following structure: hollow bricks, flexible reinforcements (steel bars), rigid metal structure (welded sheets metal reinforcement), flexible reinforcements and solid bricks.

Energy efficiency is assured by massive walls of resistance and brick used on the inside and outside of them. The cathedral is designed to withstand earthquakes of 9 on the Richter scale. The cathedral should receive its final touch, the paintwork, by 2025 according to the Romanian Orthodox Church. The chapel of the cathedral was built in 2011, exclusively from sponsorships. In this chapel, there are liturgical services for the good works of the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral, for the workers, but also for the founders and donors. In the chapel is a copy of the Icon Theotokos Acheiropoieta (&quot;Prodromiţa&quot;) from the Romanian Skete Prodromos in Mount Athos. Also, here is the reliquary with the relics of Saint John Chrysostom, the 37th archbishop of Constantinople.

=== Design and mosaic ===

The design of the new cathedral was debated by parties including the Romanian Senate and the Mayor of Bucharest. The winning design featured elements of architectural details from all the Romanian provinces and territories in an area that would make the cathedral complex one of the largest religious sites in the world. The cathedral is projected for over 20,000 people in the main cathedral building and underground galleries. A total of 7,000 worshipers can attend the holy liturgy at the same time, with a 1,000 member choir, clergy and 6,000 pilgrims in the main cathedral building. The underground chapel could accommodate 5,000 pilgrims, and the underground St. Andrew&#x27;s Cave gallery could accommodate over 10,000 pilgrims. In the whole complex could accommodate 125,000 visitors on an area of 11 hectares, and in the piazza could accommodate 43,000 visitors. The main cathedral has 6,050 square meters (floor nave) and with stairway has 8,400 square meters. The plan of cathedral is length, width, and (ground level) height. The main building is elevated with the basement area extending to below ground level. The basement area which extending below the ground level, has 7,200 square meters. The volume of the cathedral is 323 thousand cubic meters, with the basement 479 thousand cubic meters and with the pedestal 508 thousand cubic meters. The cathedral together with the underground gallery Saint Andrew have 595 thousand cubic meters.

Along with the Palace of Parliament, the Romanian Academy, the Ministry of National Defense, the cathedral can be seen as a vertical axis or a unifying pole for these buildings in a unitary and representative urban ensemble. Also, the cathedral located on Spirea&#x27;s Hill (Arsenal Square) near the Ministry of National Defense, can be considered the Cathedral of Romanian heroes of all times, who sacrificed themselves for the defense of the homeland.

In January 2018, the Patriarchate requested portfolios with mosaics made by painters from all over Romania, throughout their careers, the winner will make the mosaic of the National Cathedral. The iconographer Daniel Codrescu won, and together with his team he started working in February. The team has about 60 people, most are top specialists in iconography and mosaic art, and a few apprentice students. They work in the workshop and on the construction site. After the iconographic scenes are made, painted, and chosen the model of the tesserae by Daniel Codrescu, the drawings are sent to the Romanian Patriarchate for approval, then part of the team makes the mosaic with millions of tesserae according to the drawings, and finally the rest of the team assembles the mosaic on wall.

According to the iconographic plan, the mosaics of the cathedral show the historical basis of the Orthodox Church, thus the iconography of the cathedral includes: the Church of the Apostolic Age rendered by the representation of the twelve Apostles, the Church of the Patristic Age of the holy fathers from the Greek, Syriac, Latin and Slavic Churches, and the Romanian Orthodox Church old and contemporary. In addition to the saints from the universal church, on the walls of the cathedral will be represented the great saints of the Romanian nation. Also, certain spaces inside the cathedral will be dedicated to the confessors saints from the Romanian communist prisons, such as the priests Stăniloae, Sofian, Cleopa, Partenie Gherasim and others. The mosaic of the cathedral is made according to the hesychastic tradition and in the Neo-Byzantine style. The architecture of the cathedral is a synthesis between tradition and contemporaneity, through national architectural elements such as Brâncovenesc porches, Transylvanian towers and Moldavian niches ().

For the mosaic of the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral, is mainly used glass made in Venice and Carrara stone. The Murano glass is processed by the Venetian foundries Orsoni and Mosaici Donà Murano. The Orsoni foundry produce 24K gold leaf mosaics, blown gold and Venetian smalti in more than 3,500 colors. The smalti Orsoni was used in the decoration of the St.Mark&#x27;s Basilica, Sagrada Familia, or Washington Basilica. The Carrara stone was used in many sculptures of the Renaissance, such as Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Pietà&quot;, and in the mosaic technique. The gold glass was chosen after the glass used at St.Mark&#x27;s Basilica, being lighter in color. Murano glass from Orsoni Venezia was used to restore the St.Mark&#x27;s Basilica, the same company that supply the glass to the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral.

The tesserae are made of colored glass. The gold glass, on the side from the wall they are green-blue, to better reflect the light on the golden side, from the viewer. First, the figures were drawn and then painted &quot;in the mirror&quot; on a paper support and over them was mounted the mosaic, with the gold layer facing inside, towards the painted support. After applying the mosaic painting on the wall and cleaning the paper support on which it had been mirror-mounted, the mosaic remains mounted with the golden part of the tesserae towards the onlooker. For soldering is used a natural glue, made of water and flour, which after fixing on the wall, will be easy to soak and wash with the paper on which it was glued. In Byzantium, lime mixed with sand was used, which dried quickly, which did not allow very detailed finishes. Making a square meter are used approximately 16 kg of mosaic involves joining about 10,000 tesserae, applied with a special cement-based adhesive, working 4–7 days to arrange them according to the difficulty and size of the pixelization. For the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral will require about 400 tons of tesserae, covering an area of 25,000 square meters.

=== Nave ===

The vaulted nave reaches an interior height of 44 meters, being the Orthodox church with the highest interior nave and among the highest in the world. With a nave width of 25.2 meters, People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral is the church building with the second-widest nave in the world after St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Vatican City (27 m). Hagia Sophia in Istanbul has bigger span (31 m), but it has not a nave in the strict sense. By comparison, the nave of the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral has about 2,650 square meters with 78.6 meters (colonnade - iconostasis) by 65.1 meters (transepts), and the main hall of the Hagia Sophia has about 2,400 square meters with 78.1 meters (250 Byzantine foot - without altar) by 37.5 meters (120 Byzantine foot - transepts). If the main cathedral door and the iconostasis door are opened, visually between a person from entrance (colonnade) and the middle of the altar table are 106 meters, and if it is in the nave&#x27;s middle (under the main dome), from the floor it sees the dome ceiling (Pantocrator) also at 106 meters.

The floor of the cathedral will be covered with marble from Rușchița, the best marble in Romania. This marble has been used for many famous buildings: Romanian Parliament Building, Milan Cathedral, Hungarian Parliament Building, Istana Nurul Iman etc. The eagle in the Oval Office at the White House, one of the American symbols, is white Rușchița marble. Rușchița is the most renowned marble deposit in Romania. The quarry is located in Caraș-Severin County, south of the Poiana Ruscă Mountains. The marble from Rușchița is subsequently processed at Simeria, where the final product is made. The marble models used mainly for the cathedral are Rușchița Classico and Rușchița Champagne. The Rușchița Classico has a white-yellow color, and the Rușchița Champagne has a white-pinkish color. Inside the cathedral is used Rușchița marble up to 4 meters height, and the marble for the access steps of the cathedral has 7 cm thickness.

Vratsa marble from Bulgaria, it is used outside the cathedral up to 7 meters height. Vratsa stone for its hardness is used for window-door frames. For the interior decorations in the nave and altar Carrara marble is used. It is quarried from the Apuan Alps mountains, near the city of Pietrasanta, Italy. Carrara marble is a type of marble popular for use in building decor. The marble from Carrara was used for some of the most remarkable buildings in Ancient Rome, such as Pantheon, and other notable construction such as Siena Cathedral, Legislative Palace of Uruguay, Glasgow City Chambers, Finlandia Hall and the Akshardham (New Delhi).

The National Cathedral has 27 bronze doors with iconographic representations. The four-ton bronze doors are 2 meters width with 6.35 meters height at the arch. These are coordinated by a computer system that command the automatic opening of the doors in case of alarm. The doors were made at Süßen by Strassacker. The same company also made the bronze crosses on the towers. Initially, six companies from Austria and six companies from Germany were contacted and finally the company from Süßen was chosen. The bas-reliefs of the saints are life-size. Over 50 saints are represented on the doors of the cathedral. At the entrance on the main doors is the Mother of God and the Savior Jesus Christ. On the doors are represented martyrs, hierarchs, including over twenty Romanian saints. In 2017, Patriarch Daniel said that, the cathedral belongs to all Romanian saints, from all parts of the country.

The People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral has 396 windows and the largest window is the Ascension of Christ stained-glass from entrance (90 sqm) that cost 200 thousand euros. The frameworks of the galvanized arched windows with stainless steel clamping systems were made in Belgium by Reynaers company and electrochemically treated by anodizing. The double secured glazing of 6 millimeters each were made in Ploiești by Valras Prod. The galvanized frameworks have two sets of windows, the secured ones and the stained-glass windows.

==== Transepts and vaults ====
In 2022 the Nativity of Jesus scene having 178 square meters was completed in the southern apse, and in February 2024 the apse and arch were completed. The south apse&#x27;s registries below the conch are four in number. The two upper registers of the hemicycle are related to the family theme, among which: the Visitation, Adoration of the magi, Joseph&#x27;s dream, flight into Egypt, presentation of Jesus at the temple, Jesus blessing the children, wedding at Cana, census of Quirinius and others. The two lower registers of the hemicycle contain saints and Romanian rulers (ro:domni). The south apse&#x27;s arch contains three registers: Christian martyrs (below), Jesus at the age of twelve in the temple (middle) and the tree of Jesse (upper).
The vaulted nave on which the dome rests reaches an interior height of 40.35 meters. The &quot;triumphal&quot; vault between the altar and nave includes the iconographic representation of twelve Old Testament Prophets, the venerable Melchizedek, along with the throne of Hetoimasia and the representation of the heavenly powers: Cherubim, Seraphim and Angels. The prophets shown in medallions of 1.8 meters, hold in their hands symbolic representations, anticipating Theotokos and the foreshadowing of the incarnation of the Lord Jesus Christ. The main mosaic of the &quot;triumphal&quot; vault is Hetoimasia (gr:ἑτοιμασία), also known as the throne of the Last Judgment or the Second Coming. The scene contains: the dove of the Holy Spirit, the spear and sponge on a stick, the nails from the cross and crown of thorns. An empty throne with a Gospel Book on it, was being placed in the chamber of church councils to represent Christ, at the First Council of Ephesus in 431. The scene is inspired by the painted church exterior at Voroneţ Monastery in Romania (1547). On the mosaic Hetoimasia&#x27;s edge is written (gr-Ps:88; en-Ps:89) &quot;Justice and judgment are the habitation of Thy throne; mercy and truth shall go before Thy face&quot;.

=== Dome and roof===
==== Exterior (including towers) ====

The dominant feature is the huge elongated dome, which will have a total height of 135 meters (ground-top cross), and will become the third tallest domed church in the world, after Basilica of Our Lady of Peace and St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. It also has the tallest top dome outside in the world without the lantern-cross with 121.1 meters. At the lantern&#x27;s top the cathedral rises to 127.1 meters from the ground. The Pantocrator cupola of the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral has 106.3 meters height from the floor, surpasses the interior height dome of St.Peter&#x27;s Basilica which has 101.8 meters from the floor of the basilica. The diameter of cupola is 16.8 meters inside, with 18 meters concrete making a hemispherical shape, and the concrete dome was completed on 24 May 2019. The dome is surrounded by six towers, and at the western end is the bell tower or campanile, 86.8 meters height crossless, which contains the world&#x27;s largest free-swinging church bell.

The overall style is Romanian revival, a synthesis of Renaissance revival through the high dome, Romanesque through the façade with towers, and Neo-Byzantine through the bell tower. Both the dome and the hexadecagonal outer cupola are a feature inspired by the tempietto shape of the St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. The outer dome&#x27;s façade has some similarities to the northern façade and choir of the Sacré-Cœur, Paris Basilica. In the Romanian space, among sources of landmark are several buildings. The dome&#x27;s peristyle surrounded by sixteen arches, the six upper octagonal towers with squared basis, three linear moulding around the building find at the Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral, Cluj-Napoca. The bell tower&#x27;s façade with the porch, and the Byzantine compound dome with two rows of pendentives, find at the Timișoara Orthodox Cathedral. Also from the Coronation Cathedral, Alba Iulia find the arches, cornice, and the robust façade of the bell tower by side buttresses. The portal with the bell tower&#x27;s rosette and the porch resemble that of the Antim Monastery and the Cașin Church in Bucharest.

The dome is set on a rectangular-octagonal shaped drum which has 1,350 square meters. Around the dome is a row of circular shields, adorned with the cross of Saint Andrew. The main part to visit is the dome&#x27;s peristyle with sixteen arches supported on each side by continuous colonnade with a circumference of 93 meters around the dome and 29.4 meters in diameter. The arcades are supported by scallop capital of simplified Corinthian order. The capital together with its abacus, have octagonal shape in the towers and bell tower, and at the dome have hexadecagonal shape. The large stained glass windows will be mounted around the dome, each measuring 11.45 meters height by 1.35 meters width. Above the peristyle is the belvedere dome surrounded by a balustraded balcony at 97.8 meters height from the ground, behind a small semioval windows. Above this attic rises the cupola covered with gilded copper, and ribbed in accordance with the spacing of the columns. The outside cupola is pierced by sixteen small skylight just below the lantern, but these are barely visible from the ground level by an onlooker. The inner connection cupola-lantern, is achieved by a spiral metallized staircase. The roof sheet is a CuAl5Zn5 alloy (Tecu-Gold), where copper has 91.55% (99.99% purity) and 8.45% aluminium bronze, and was made by the German company KME. The copper sheet area used for the cathedral is 19,913 square meters.

==== Interior ====

The inner dome consists of two parts supported by two rows of pendentives, with a total area of 4,200 square meters, and the highest point of the dome&#x27;s ceiling rises 106.25 meters above the floor of the nave. The upper dome having 2,830 square meters, with a diameter of 16.8 meters is supported by pendentives at 52.75 meters height, and will consists the mosaics: Christ Pantocrator and the registers of the nine heavenly powers. The lower dome with a diameter of 25.2 meters is supported by pendentives at 40.35 meters height, having 1,370 square meters which will include scenes from the Savior&#x27;s life, Theotokos and the holy apostles, prophets, hierarchs.

The Pantocrator cupola has about 450 square meters, of which the Pantocrator mosaic represents 150 square meters and the surface&#x27;s rest is represented by the mosaic of the nine heavenly powers. With a diameter of 12 meters, of which the face is 4.5 meters, the making of the Pantocrator mosaic required over six months and 2.4 tons of tesserae were used. In February 2024, began assembling of the Pantocrator mosaic on the dome&#x27;s ceiling at the highest point of the worship&#x27;s place, and the dome&#x27;s mosaic will be finished in 2025. Christ is wearing a blue mantle and a purple robe, he is the King of kings and shows strength, austerity and almighty. The arched eyebrows accentuate the horizontal lines of the arms, and the nose that intersects with the horizontal lines creates a symbolic cross. Around the Pantocrator mosaic are two quotations from (gr-Ps:79; en-Ps:80) &quot;O God!, o God!: look down from heaven and behold, and visit this vineyard which Thy right hand hath planted, and it perfects her&quot;; and (gr-Ps:32; en-Ps:33) &quot;The Lord looketh from heaven, He beholdeth all!&quot;; Amen. The Pantocrator mosaic is mainly inspired by the mosaics from the mosaic Deesis (Δέησις, &quot;Prayer&quot;) in Hagia Sophia located in the upper south gallery, dating back to 1261, from the southern dome of the Chora church, and from the dome of Daphni monastery an eleventh-century Byzantine architecture monastery.

=== Altar ===

The vaulted apse altar reaches an interior height of 42.2 meters from the floor of cathedral, and the altar&#x27;s mosaic including iconostasis is about 3,000 square meters. The floor of the altar where the Holy Liturgy are held is 330 square meters, and with the altar ambulatory is 430 square meters. The iconography of the altar excluding iconostasis, comprises five sections: the apse and the hemicycle of the altar with three central registers and the vestment wall.

On 7 May 2019, the Theotokos Platytera (gr:&quot;Πλατυτέρα των Ουρανών&quot;, &quot;higher than the heavens&quot;) icon was completed in the apse altar. It is the largest mosaic of Theotokos in the world, having 16 meters height and 150 square meters. The idea he started, is the Theotokos mosaic from the Hagia Sophia, but larger in size than this.

Following the conversion of the Hagia Sophia to a mosque, the coordinator of the team of iconographers Daniel Codrescu expressed his wish that the Theotokos of National Cathedral from Bucharest, will symbolically replace the Theotokos from Constantinople. It is a synthesis &quot;according to the Romanian soul&quot; with elements from several well-known icons, Daniel Codrescu explained. To make the Platytera mosaic, one million pieces of mosaic were used. For the mantle of the Mother of God, nine different colors of red were used. Below the Theotokos Platytera icon are nine windows through which light enters, like the nine biblical ode, emphasizing the description of the Queen of Heavens. The Theotokos Platytera icon is surrounded by the archangels Michael and Gabriel, each having 13 meters height with 5 meters width and the wings 10 meters in length. The mosaic of the Theotokos and archangels is about 600 square meters. In June 2020, the mosaic of apse altar was completed having about 1,000 square meters.
The altar registers below the apse altar, are three in number. The upper register of the hemicycle, in the center contains the Tabernacle of the Congregation, which was a foreshadowing of the Mother of God in the Old Testament. On the left is the scene of Abraham&#x27;s Sacrifice, and on the right is the scene of Melchizedek&#x27;s Tribute offering. The middle register in the center contains the establishing of the New Testament through the Partaking of the Apostles. On the left is the Holy Trinity in the version of Abraham&#x27;s Hospitality (gr:&quot;Φιλοξενία&quot;), and on the right is the Prophet Elijah fed by the ravens. The lower register is dedicated to eighteen Romanian saints hierarchs. The last section of the altar is the vestment wall, which includes nine stained glass with saints.

The mosaic of the Apostles Partaking is 22 meters in length by 7 meters in height, and the Savior has a height of 4 meters. The Eucharist also known as Holy Communion, or the Lord&#x27;s Supper is a symbolic scene of the Apostles Partaking. Angels with fans stand on either side of the Communion table. To their left and right is the twice portrayed figure of Christ: on the left is breaking bread, on the right shares the wine, and the disciples coming to Him from both sides. Judas appears turned with his back on the Savior, and the halo remains detached behind (right side of the scene). This iconographic detail is taken from Sucevița Monastery. Among the sources of inspiration is the mosaic in the altar of Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv (11th century), but also by the Eucharist mosaic from the museum of the same cathedral, which belonged to the demolished St.Michael&#x27;s Monastery in Kyiv (1113).

The pathway in front of the iconostasis is 7.7 meters width at the upper soleas with 3.13 meters width at the lower end, the soleas having 10.83 meters width and 270 square meters. The bema composed of altar and soleas is about 600 square meters for liturgical space. The floor of the altar and soleas are covered with marble and Rușchița stone, the models used being Muse Campagne, Caffe Latte, Sun Red, White Sivec, White Onyx stone and Yellow Onyx stone. Below the Holy Table of the altar are placed the relics fragments of the Saint Martyr Constantin Brâncoveanu, and the relics fragments of the saints martyrs from Niculițel. Also inside the Holy Table, there is a list of 350,000 names of the Romanian heroes from the First and Second World War.

==== Iconostasis ====

The iconostasis of the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral, with the size of 23.8 meters length and 17.1 meters height, is the largest Orthodox iconostasis in the world. On one side the iconostasis has 407 square meters (wall to wall without doors) of mosaic being covered with over 4 million tesserae weighing 8 tons and with the adhesive 10 tons. Along with the thickened side edges that are part of the cathedral&#x27;s iconography walls, the 1.26-meter thick iconostasis and over 800 square meters of mosaic on both sides is 25.2 meters length as nave, the whole structure with ornaments and crucifix weighing about 1,500 tons. The royal doors has an inner vaulted of 4.28 meters height with 2.50 meters width, the edge of the gate being covered with 12.4 tons of Onyx stone. Age-old since the world began, the onyx is the first gemstone which find in the pages of the Old Testament, in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 2:12).
For the realization of the iconostasis of the cathedral in Bucharest, a team of over 45 mosaic and fresco specialists worked for ten months. The leader of this team was iconographer Daniel Codrescu. Originally, the team had thought of marble frames for each large icon, but because the weight of the material could have affected the structure of the iconostasis resistance, the idea was abandoned. This iconostasis is made entirely of mosaic and fresco in Byzantine style. The team involved in the project was divided into two groups: the first involved in making the mosaics in the workshop, and the second in fitting them on the stonework. Iconographer Daniel Codrescu said: &quot;Everything is worked in the smallest details. The team tried to take the realization to another level of greatness. With the help of God, this monumental work is a gift to the Centenary of Romania. This iconostasis is the summary of the kingdom of heavens.&quot; The front of the iconostasis has 45 icons placed on four registers. The first register has six royal icons, the second register has thirteen icons with royal feasts, the third register has the icon of the Holy Trinity (center) and the twelve Apostles, and the fourth register has the Theotokos (center) and the twelve Prophets of the Old Testament. On the four side doors are the four archangels, and on the royal door are the Annunciation and the four Evangelists. The royal icons have the dimensions of 2.15 meters width with 3.75 meters height and an area of 8 square meters. All icons of the iconostasis have a total of 130 portraits.

The rear face of the iconostasis contains three registers. The upper register in the center contains the Last Supper, represented by the liturgical variant in the hemicycle altar through the Partaking of the Apostles. On the left is Jesus Christ washing the feet of the disciples. It is a ritual practiced on Holy Thursday (Maundy Thursday). On the right are two scenes, the road to Emmaus appearance and the Supper at Emmaus. The middle and lower registers have nineteen Romanian saints, hierarchs, pious and priests. The iconostasis and the altar are joined by two walls, each with three saints.

Commonly, on the iconostasis are four royal icons, but here we have six, which has helped us to represent the two patronal feasts, &quot;Ascension of the Lord&quot; and &quot;Saint Apostle Andrew&quot;. On the left is placed the icons of Saint Nicholas and Saint John the Baptist, two of the most beloved saints in Romanian space. Like a peculiarity, in the registry of the Saints Apostles is represented the Holy Trinity, which in this case occupies the place of the Judge Right. The latter, has been moved to the royal icon of the Savior Jesus Christ. Together with the icon of the Theotokos and Saint John the Baptist is symbolized the Deesis icon. The Holy Trinity was chosen by Patriarch Daniel, to emphasize the Scripture quote that says, &quot;Going, teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&quot; (Matthew 28:19). The Saints Apostles preach the teaching of the Holy Trinity, being the representatives who baptizes the nations.

At each entrance to the altar above the five doors, from right to left is written: 1st door – &quot;Behold, a door standing open in heaven&quot; (Revelation 4); 2nd door – &quot;God of life!, open the doors of repentance to me, that my spirit sighs at Your holy church&quot; (Horologion); central door – &quot;Peace be to you!&quot; (John 20); 4th door – &quot;Blessed Virgin Theotokos open to us the door of mercy, so that those who trust in you may not perish&quot; (Triodion); 5th door – &quot;He brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple, and I looked, and behold, the glory of the Lord filled the temple of the Lord&quot; (Ezekiel 44).

==== Crucifix ====

In December 2021, the Crucifix was placed on the iconostasis after structure was made in August. The cross and the two side mosaics (ro:&quot;Molenii&quot;) were made between 2018 and 2021 by the iconographer Daniel Codrescu, along with other nine mosaic specialists. The Crucifix with a height of 4.5 meters and with the pedestal 5 meters rising to 23 meters from the floor of the cathedral. In the side-attendant of the Crucifix, are the mosaics of the Theotokos and Saint John the Apostle.

On the face behind the Crucifix, is a pelican with chicks, and at the bottom is a quote from the second ode of the Lord&#x27;s Lamentations at the Burial (ro:&quot;Prohod&quot;): &quot;Like a pelican, You hurt yourself into your rib, O Saviour!; You gave your life, for your sons who died, spreading living springs over them&quot;. The image of the mother pelican feeding her chicks with his blood, is rooted in an ancient legends which preceded Christianity. The pelican is a symbol of the Passion of Jesus for Christianity and the Eucharist in the East and in the West. A copy of this pelican on the back of the crucifix, can be seen in Bălăneanu-Iancu Nou Church, Bucharest, in the form of a circular mosaic imprinted on the nave&#x27;s floor.

On the back of the mosaic Theotokos, writes: &quot;upon Thy right hand did stand the queen, embellished in a golden vestment and too beautify!&quot; (gr-Ps:44; en-Ps:45); and on the back of the mosaic John the Apostle, writes: &quot;thine Own of thine Own, we offer unto Thee on behalf of all and for all&quot; (Anaphora Liturgy-Byzantine Rite). The sides of the cross are decorated with a golden interlace ornament braided on a red background. The interlace recalls the archaic motif of the braided rope as a symbol of eternal life. The red decoration signifies the blood sacrificed on the cross and the royal power of the Lord. Among the sources of inspiration are the crucifix paintings from Studenica Monastery (1208), Moldovița Monastery (1532), and the crucifixes of Cimabue and Giotto.

=== Other notable elements ===
==== Courtyard ====

The cathedral&#x27;s courtyard has six annexes. The most important annexes are the Saint John&#x27;s House and Saint Paul&#x27;s House (3.510,6 sq meters together) for clergy pilgrims with rooms, where they will take place the missionary cultural center with classrooms and seminars, a library, and exhibition spaces. To the west of the cathedral will be placed two curved porticos (2,079.6 sq meters) which marks the main entrance to the enclosure of the ensemble, and two L-shaped porticos (5,159.2 sq meters) on either side of the esplanade. Initially, four cultural buildings were planned, but later the plan was abandoned, and the two buildings at the entrance have been turned into porticos.

The esplanade of the cathedral is located above the underground gallery called St.Andrew&#x27;s Cave and implicitly has the same area of 15,581 square meters. The esplanade without porticos, the free side has 11,600 sq meters, where over 23,000 people can gather. One of the L-shaped portico includes the pangar of the cathedral, and the other portico includes the place where the candles burn. Behind the cathedral on the left, there will be a five hectare park, where a monument dedicated to the Ascension of Christ will be arranged. Part of the earth excavated at the foundation of the cathedral will be used for this monument.

==== Basement (chapels and galleries) ====
The cathedral has two large underground galleries. In the underground chapel a total of 5,000 people can attend the holy liturgy at the same time, and in the large polyvalent gallery under the cathedral esplanade called St.Andrew&#x27;s Cave can be accommodate over 10,000 people. The underground chapel has two levels, which are connected to the main hall by colonnades, arcades and stairs, and has 7,200 square meters with 126 meters by 63 meters. The chapel hall has eleven meters high and the same dimensions (horizontally) as the main hall of the cathedral, except that it has no apse area. With annexes the underground chapel has 13,668 square meters, with 155 meters by 92 meters. The gallery St.Andrew&#x27;s Cave has 15,581 square meters (including annexes) with 143 meters by 118 meters. If a person walks through the entire underground gallery of the cathedral from west to east, he has to walk 300 meters in a straight line. The two large underground galleries together have approximately 30,000 square meters. The galleries are divided into: spaces including a main hall, other halls and rooms for events; an icon and religious clothing shop; a workshop (for carpentry, upholstery and metal work for example); a museum, gallery-exhibition, liturgical performance media shop; as well as storage rooms, a refectory, religious/sacramental objects and employees rooms.

Initially instead of the underground room of St.Andrew&#x27;s Cave, a car park was planned there. But this was becoming an inconvenience for the underground chapel, due to emissions from cars, the plan was abandoned. Thus, the car park will be arranged on the left side of the courtyard from the west. The St.Andrew&#x27;s Cave gallery will host the Museum of Romanian Christianity. Under the cathedral chapel at a depth of 16 meters, will be arranged only technical spaces for installations. Also at this level, 42 crypts will be arranged for the patriarchs of Romania and four atomic bunkers.

The chapel will have a liturgical program for the monastery (daily). Liturgical services in the cathedral will be held on Sundays and on important holidays. The Holy Altar of the chapel is dedicated to Saint John James the Chozebite and Daniil Sihastru, because they both lived a part of their lives in the cave. Saint John James the Chozebite (Hosevite) became a monk at Neamt Monastery and soon after his conversion he moved to the Holy Land where he lived near the downstream of the Jordan river, near Jericho. Toward the end of his life, he lived in the wilderness of Choziba at the Saint George Monastery. In 1992 he was declared a saint by the Romanian Orthodox Patriarchate and in 2016 he was officially recognised as such by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem. The Church celebrates his feast day on 5 August. Daniil Sihastrul (or Daniel the Hesychast) was a renowned Romanian Orthodox spiritual guide, hermit, hegumen of Voroneț Monastery and advisor () of Stephen the Great. He encouraged Stephen the Great to fight for the defense of Christendom and to build holy places, after each battle won against the invaders. Canonized by the Romanian Orthodox Church in 1992, he is commemorated on 18 December.

The cathedral has the world&#x27;s largest free-swinging church bell, surpassing the Saint Peter&#x27;s bell (Petersglocke) in the Cologne Cathedral. With a weight of 25,190 kg, a clapper of 750 kg, a diameter of 3,355 mm, a height of 3,130 mm, thickness of 273 mm, the bell was cast on 11 November 2016 in Innsbruck by Grassmayr and is elevated to 65 meters. The casting time was 9 minutes and 23 seconds, the bell being made of 78% copper and 22% tin both 99.99% purity, and has a very low beat C3 (en) – C0 (de) – Do2 (ro) with 130.8 Hz. The cathedral has six bells weighing 32,243 kg, and the sound of the big bell is heard from 15 to 20 km. For the biggest bell 425,000 euros were paid, and the total value of the six bells totalled roughly 550,000 euros.

A team of 25 experts from Italy, Germany, Austria, Croatia and Romania, worked on the great bell of the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral. The leader of the team was the Italian campanologist Flavio Zambotto. Flavio Zambotto said about the bell: &quot;The collaboration for the bell of the Cathedral in Bucharest is my greatest professional achievement. For this bell the team worked 8 months. The bell is made of the premium alloys, at the highest standards. Work was done in the smallest details, and at a purity of 99.99%, the acoustic tolerance is 0%. I had the honor of working at some famous bells and every bell is like a son to me. But the bell of the Cathedral in Bucharest is magnificent, among the best in the world. All acoustic parameters are superlative. The sound is sober, very strong, long and it marks you.&quot;

The sound of the big bell in the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral of Bucharest was chosen especially to resemble the sound of the famous bell &quot;Pummerin&quot; in Saint Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral of Vienna, though compared to &quot;Pummerin&quot;, the Bucharester bell sounds longer and is lower and stronger. The big bell will be rung only on major holidays and declared national days. The sounds of the six bells span two complete octaves.

==== Consecration ====

On 23 November 2018, the Ecumenical Patriarch arrived in Romania to lead the consecration of the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral which was planned on Sunday 25 November; the Ecumenical Patriarch was officially welcomed by Patriarch Daniel of Romania. In his welcoming speech, Patriarch Daniel talked about the &quot;spiritual connection between the Ecumenical Patriarchate, Mother-Church, and the Romanian Orthodox Church, Daughter-Church&quot;

On 24 November, at the Patriarchal Residence in Bucharest, during the meeting of the synod of the Romanian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Daniel of Romania made a speech to the Ecumenical Patriarch, thanking him for the cooperation between the Romanian Orthodox Church and the Ecumenical Patriarchate. During the same meeting, the Ecumenical Patriarch made a speech to the Romanian Orthodox synod, stating that he was &quot;sure the Romanian Orthodox Church will be involved in preserving the church unity and justice.&quot;

On Sunday 25 November, the Ecumenical Patriarch with Patriarch Daniel of Romania and Metropolitan Chrysostomos of Patras consecrated together the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral with myrrh and holy water. At the big event, the consecration was held in the presence of 60 bishops by Romania and other Orthodox countries, together with 40 hegumens and protopopes, to mark the Centenary of Romania.
The Ecumenical Patriarch chaired the first liturgy of the Romanian People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral. Both the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I and the Patriarch Daniel of Romania led the church service this day; it was the very first church service in the cathedral. During his homily at the cathedral, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew said he was &quot;connected&quot; to Patriarch Daniel of Romania with his &quot;old personal, pure and sincerely tested friendship, but also with the unshaken, brotherly love in Christ and good understanding.&quot; On 26 November, Patriarch Bartholomew went back to Istanbul. Thousands of people travelled from all parts of the country to attend the consecration, disregarding the cold weather and waiting times to get a chance to enter the cathedral. Although they travelled hundreds of kilometres to participate in the consecration of the National Cathedral, the cathedral appeared to them as a chimney shrouded in fog, which they had to look at from afar, climbing on fences and surrounded by the gendarmes.

The Ecumenical Patriarch and Patriarch Daniel signed the Document of Consecration. The presence of Patriarch Bartholomew and the absence of Patriarch Kiril of Moscow at the cathedral inauguration &quot;appears to suggest that Romania is siding with Constantinople in the dispute.&quot; To the questions: &quot;Will Patriarch Kiril in Romania come to the sanctification of the painting?&quot; and &quot;How will the presence of His Holiness Bartholomew I affect the relationship between the ROC [Romanian Orthodox Church] and the Russian Patriarchate [Russian Orthodox Church]?&quot;, the Romanian Patriarchate spokesman Vasile Bănescu answered: &quot;I am absolutely convinced that Patriarch Kiril will return to Romania on the occasion of the sanctification of the painting and will not withdraw because the ROC had the wisdom to plead for a dialogue to heal the wound of this separation between the Patriarchate of Constantinople and the Patriarchate of Moscow and All Russia. [...] We hope that this relationship, currently interrupted, will be resumed. The Romanian Patriarchate has a natural relationship with the Moscow Patriarchate and there are no tensions at the moment&quot;.

==== Pope Francis ====
On 31 May 2019, Pope Francis arrived in Romania, visiting the cathedral the same day. Pope Francis expressed the hope that &quot;Romania can always be a home of all, a place of meeting, a garden in which reconciliation and communion flourish.&quot; The pope emphasized brotherhood and communion among all who prayed to the same Heavenly Father. He said: &quot;Each time we pray, we ask that our trespasses, our debts, be forgiven. This takes courage, for it means that we must forgive the trespasses of others, the debts that others have incurred in our regard. We need to find the strength to forgive our brother or sister from the heart (Mt 18:35), even as you, Father, forgive our trespasses: to leave the past behind us and, together, to embrace the present. Help us, Father, not to yield to fear, not to see openness as a threat, to find the strength to forgive each other and move on, and the courage not to settle for a quiet life but to keep seeking, with transparency and sincerity, the face of our brothers and sisters... I come as a pilgrim desirous of seeing the Lord&#x27;s Face in the faces of my Brothers.&quot;

=== Criticism ===
Often in the national media, critics associate the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral and the Palace of the Parliament, the two colossuses of Romania&#x27;s capital that share the same courtyard. As the largest Orthodox church in the world, next to the world&#x27;s heaviest and second largest administrative building in the world, French newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, named it &quot;a pharaonic project&quot;, &quot;worthy of the megalomania of Nicolae Ceaușescu&quot;. A Romanian newspaper said that the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral will be the most expensive building built in the country after the Romanian Revolution of 1989. Another Romanian newspaper said that the politicians of the Romanian government depend on support from the Romanian Patriarchate in the election campaign, and estimates that when the cathedral will be fully completed, the value of the cathedral in the real estate market will be over €1 billion. A Romanian journalist called the cathedral a &quot;God mall&quot;.

The biggest construction project in Romania since the revolution, the cathedral was initially announced to be built with the Romanian Orthodox Church&#x27;s money. It was later discovered that the church had used its influence and the government had decided to promulgate law no. 563/2007 that allows the allocation of unspecified amounts of public funds to the cathedral&#x27;s building. Aside from money from the Romanian Government allocated to the Cathedral through the State Secretariat for Cults (SSC), city halls have also contributed to the total budget. For instance, after a meeting between the Mayor of Bucharest at that time, Gabriela Firea and Patriarch Daniel of the Romanian Orthodox Church, an agreement which mentioned the Bucharest City Hall would allocate money to the cathedral&#x27;s construction was signed but never mentioned to the public. One independent publication finds the total amount of public money (earned by the state from the people) to be at 120 mil euro.

The criticism is mostly related to the primary use of public funds from the state as opposed to the Church&#x27;s own, the lack of proper auctioning processes and instead direct acquisitions/selections, the lack of transparency in regards to the way public funds were spent, erroneous communication and the chosen construction companies being closely related to church members.

The Romanian Orthodox Church&#x27;s answer to such criticism was that the new cathedral would not imitate the gigantic buildings of the communist era, but would &quot;correct them, through a decent and harmonious volumetry&quot;. The presence of the cathedral in the area with the Parliament of Romania, the Ministry of National Defense and the Romanian Academy, is seen as a dialogue and necessity for the benefit of the national homeland.

<doc id="1281059" wikidata="Q985620" url="?curid=1281059" title="Dosso, Niger">
<text>Dosso is a city in the south-west corner of Niger. It lies south-east of the capital Niamey at the junction of the main routes to Zinder and Benin. The eighth-most populous town in Niger and the largest in Dosso Region, it had an official population during the 2001 census of 43,561. The population grew to 58,671 in the 2012 census. It is the capital of its region - which covers five departments in the southwestern corner of the nation - as well as of its own department, Dosso Department. The city itself lies at the centre of its own Urban Commune.

==History==

Dosso is the seat of the Dosso kingdom, a Zarma chieftaincy which rose to dominate the entire Zarma region in Niger in pre-colonial Niger. The traditional ruler is called &quot;Zarmakoy&quot; or &quot;Djermakoy&quot; of Dosso, an autochthonous title meaning literally &quot;King of Djermas&quot; where &quot;koy&quot; means &quot;king&quot; in Zarma (or Djerma) language.

==Sites==
Attractions in the town include the Djermakoy&#x27;s palace and museum, nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006.

== Transport ==
Road: The city of Dosso is a commercial hub for trade between Niamey and the towns of eastern Niger, as well as Benin. &lt;br&gt;
Rail: between 2014 and 2016 a rail link was built between Dosso and Niamey by the French Bolloré conglomerate. The objective was to connect Niamey to the rail network in Benin and thus to the coast. But competing commercial interests by several parties resulted in endless litigation and the connection to Benin never materialized. So the 145 km Niamey-Dosso stretch now lies orphaned and unused, with the tracks ending in the middle of nowhere some 6 km south of Dosso. After 5 years of neglect the tracks are already damaged to such an extent in some places, that they have become unusable.&lt;br&gt;
Customs: There is a plan for the construction of a dry commercial port.&lt;br&gt;
Air: Dosso has a small airport with a single non-tarmacked airstrip. The runway has a length of 1189 m. Its ICAO code is DRRD. There are no regular flights.

== Climatic Condition ==
There is a hot dry season in Dosso, and there is a wet season as well. The dry season is characterised by somewhat cloudy skies.

==Notable residents==
* Rabiou Guero Gao – Olympic long-distance runner for Niger
* Zakari Gourouza – first Nigerien Olympic judoka

<text>Michael Andrew Gove (; born Graeme Andrew Logan, 26 August 1967) is a Scottish journalist, author, and retired politician who served in various Cabinet positions under David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak. Apart from periods as a backbencher from July 2016 to June 2017 and July to October 2022, he served continuously in the Cabinet from 2010 to 2024. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Surrey Heath from 2005 to 2024. A member of the Conservative Party, Gove twice ran to become Leader of the Conservative Party, in 2016 and 2019, finishing in third place on both occasions. He has been editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot; since October 2024.

Born in Aberdeen, Gove was in care until being adopted aged four months old, after which he was raised in the Kittybrewster area of the city. He attended the independent Robert Gordon&#x27;s College and studied English at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. He then began a career as a journalist at &quot;The Press and Journal&quot; before having a long tenure as a leader writer at &quot;The Times&quot;. Elected for Surrey Heath at the 2005 general election, he was appointed Secretary of State for Education in the Cameron–Clegg coalition. He terminated the previous Labour government&#x27;s Building Schools for the Future programme, reformed A-Level and GCSE qualifications in favour of final examinations, and responded to the Trojan Horse scandal. Four teachers unions passed motions of no confidence in his policies at their 2013 conferences. In the 2014 cabinet reshuffle, he was moved to the post of Government Chief Whip. Following the 2015 general election and the formation of the majority Cameron government, Gove was promoted to Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor. As the co-convenor of Vote Leave, Gove was seen, along with fellow Conservative MP Boris Johnson, as one of the most prominent figures of the 2016 referendum on EU membership. He was campaign manager for Johnson in the 2016 Conservative Party leadership election but withdrew his support on the morning Johnson was due to declare and announced his own candidacy, finishing behind Theresa May and Andrea Leadsom.

Upon the appointment of May as prime minister, Gove was dismissed from the Cabinet but joined the second May government as Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs following the 2017 general election. In his second leadership bid, in 2019, Gove finished behind Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt. Following Johnson&#x27;s victory, Gove was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster with responsibility for no-deal Brexit preparations. He took on the additional role of Minister for the Cabinet Office in the 2020 cabinet reshuffle and was responsible for coordinating the government&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. After the 2021 cabinet reshuffle, he served as Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities and Minister for Intergovernmental Relations until telling Johnson to resign during the July 2022 government crisis and being dismissed by Johnson. Under Rishi Sunak, he was reinstated to his previous roles of Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities and Minister for Intergovernmental Relations. He stood down as an MP at the 2024 general election. In September of the same year, Gove was appointed editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot;.

== Early life and education (1967–1988) ==

Gove was born Graeme Andrew Logan on 26 August 1967. His biological mother, whom he originally understood to have been an unmarried Edinburgh student, was in fact a 23-year-old cookery demonstrator. Gove regarded Edinburgh as his birthplace until it was revealed in a biography in 2019 that he was born in a maternity hospital in Fonthill Road, Aberdeen. Logan was put into care soon after he was born.

At the age of four months he was adopted by a couple in Aberdeen, Ernest and Christine Gove, by whom he was brought up. After he joined the Gove family, Logan&#x27;s name was changed to Michael Andrew Gove. His adoptive father, Ernest, ran the family fish processing business at Aberdeen Harbour, and his adoptive mother, Christine, was a lab assistant at the University of Aberdeen, later working at the Aberdeen School for the Deaf.

Gove, his parents, and his adoptive sister Angela Christine lived in a small property in the Kittybrewster area of Aberdeen, before relocating to Rosehill Drive. He was educated at two state schools (Sunnybank Primary School and Kittybrewster Primary School), and later, on the recommendation of his primary school teacher, he sat and passed the entrance exam for the independent Robert Gordon&#x27;s College. In October 2012, he wrote an apology letter to his former French teacher for misbehaving in class.

Gove joined the Labour Party in 1983 and campaigned on behalf of the party for the 1983 general election. Outside of school, he spent time as a Sunday school teacher at Causewayend Church. As he entered sixth year he had to apply for a scholarship as his family fell on difficult economic circumstances. He passed the scholarship exam and served as a school prefect in his final two years.

From 1985 to 1988 he studied English at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, during which time he joined the Conservative Party. He became a member of the Oxford University Conservative Association and was secretary of Aberdeen South Young Conservatives. He helped write speeches for Cabinet and Shadow Cabinet ministers, including Peter Lilley and Michael Howard. During his first year, he met future Prime Minister Boris Johnson and ran his campaign to be President of the Oxford Union. In an interview with Andrew Gimson, Gove remarked that at Oxford, Johnson was &quot;quite the most brilliant extempore speaker of his generation&quot;. Gove was elected as Oxford Union President a year after Johnson. He graduated with an upper second class bachelor&#x27;s degree.

== Career ==
=== Journalism (1988–2005) ===
After university, when applying for a job at the Conservative Research Department, Gove was told he was &quot;insufficiently political&quot; and &quot;insufficiently Conservative&quot;, so he turned to journalism. He first found employment on the Peterborough column of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, after passing an interview with Max Hastings. Struggling to maintain his career in London, he moved back to Aberdeen and became a trainee reporter at &quot;The Press and Journal&quot;, where he spent several months on strike in the 1989–1990 dispute over union recognition and representation. From 1990 to 1991, he worked as a reporter for Scottish Television, with a brief interlude at Grampian Television in Aberdeen.

After moving to national television in 1991, Gove worked for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;On the Record&quot;, and the Channel 4 current affairs programme &quot;A Stab in the Dark&quot;, alongside David Baddiel and Tracey MacLeod. In 1994 he began working for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme. In 1995 he was identified by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as part of a group of &quot;a new breed of 21st-century Tories&quot;. He broke the news of the 1995 Conservative Party leadership election thanks to his connections with the upper echelons of the party. Gove was a member of the winning team in Grampian Television&#x27;s quiz show &quot;Top Club&quot;, and played the school chaplain in the 1994 family comedy &quot;A Feast at Midnight&quot;.

In January 1996 he joined &quot;The Times&quot; as a leader writer and assumed posts as its comment editor, news editor, assistant editor and Saturday editor. He also wrote a weekly column on politics and current affairs for the paper from 1999 until 2005 and contributed to &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, &quot;Prospect&quot; magazine and &quot;The Spectator&quot;. He was on good terms with the owner of the paper, Rupert Murdoch, whom Gove described in evidence before the Leveson Inquiry as &quot;one of the most impressive and significant figures of the last 50 years&quot;. He wrote a sympathetic biography of Michael Portillo, &quot;Michael Portillo: The Future of the Right&quot;, and a highly critical study of the Northern Ireland peace process, &quot;The Price of Peace&quot;, where he compared the Good Friday Agreement to appeasement of the Nazis in the 1930s. During his period at &quot;The Times&quot; he also broadcast regularly, on programmes including &quot;Any Questions?&quot;, &quot;The Week in Westminster&quot;, &quot;The Book Quiz&quot;, &quot;Moral Maze&quot; and &quot;Newsnight Review&quot; (all on the BBC).

Gove co-founded Policy Exchange, a conservative think tank launched in 2002, and chaired it for three years. He was commissioned to write a biography of Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke, in 2004.

=== Early parliamentary career (2005–2010) ===
Gove won the Conservative candidacy for Surrey Heath on 5 July 2004, after the sitting MP Nick Hawkins was deselected by the local Conservative association. He then arranged to leave the staff of &quot;The Times&quot;, but was retained on a contract to write a weekly column for the newspaper and other such pieces as might be commissioned &quot;ad hoc&quot;. He entered the House of Commons after being elected in the 2005 general election, winning by 10,845 votes and a 22.7% majority. After being selected as an MP he stood down from &quot;Moral Maze&quot; but continued to appear on &quot;Newsnight Review&quot;. He was commissioned to write a book on terrorism in 2005, &quot;Celsius 7/7&quot;, which was published in 2006.

In 2005 he was appointed Shadow Minister for Housing and Planning. During his time as an MP, as well as his column for &quot;The Times&quot; he also wrote columns for &quot;Building&quot; magazine and the newspaper &quot;Scotland on Sunday&quot;. He made his maiden speech on 7 June 2005, focusing on national security. Gove was seen as part of an influential set of Conservatives referred to as the Notting Hill Set, which included Conservative leader David Cameron, future Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, Ed Vaizey, Nick Boles and Rachel Whetstone.

Over a five-month period between December 2005 and April 2006, Gove claimed more than £7,000 on a house bought with his wife Sarah Vine, in 2002. Around a third of the money was spent at OKA, an upmarket interior design company established by Annabel Astor, David Cameron&#x27;s mother-in-law. Shortly afterwards he reportedly &#x27;flipped&#x27; his designated second home, a property for which he claimed around £13,000 to cover stamp duty. Gove also claimed for a cot mattress, despite children&#x27;s items being banned under updated Commons rules. Gove said he would repay the claim for the cot mattress, but maintained that his other claims were &quot;below the acceptable threshold costs for furniture&quot; and that moving house was necessary &quot;to effectively discharge my parliamentary duties&quot;. While he was moving between homes, on one occasion he stayed at the Pennyhill Park Hotel in Bagshot, Surrey, following a constituency engagement, charging the taxpayer more than £500 per night&#x27;s stay.

Gove won the &quot;Rising Star Award&quot; at the February 2006 Channel 4 political awards. On 2 July 2007, he was promoted to the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (a newly created department set up by Gordon Brown), shadowing Ed Balls. In the role he advocated the introduction of a Swedish-style education voucher system, whereby parents would choose where their child would be educated, with the state paying what they would have cost in a state school. He also advocated Swedish-style free schools, to be managed by parents and funded by the state, with the possibility that such schools would be allowed to be run on a for-profit model. Gove was involved in founding the right-leaning magazine &quot;Standpoint&quot;, to which he has occasionally contributed. He contracted H1N1 swine flu during the 2009 influenza pandemic. In January 2010, he gave up his column for &quot;The Times&quot;, in keeping with a policy governing Shadow Cabinet activity laid down by David Cameron at that time. Prior to the 2010 general election, most of his questions in Commons debates concerned children, schools and families, education, local government, Council Tax, foreign affairs and the environment. At the 2010 general election, Gove was re-elected, winning an increased majority of 17,289 and with an increased vote share of 57.6%.

=== Education Secretary (2010–2014) ===
With the formation of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government following the hung parliament after the 2010 general election, Gove became Secretary of State for Education. His first moves included reorganising his department, announcing plans to allow schools rated as Outstanding by Ofsted to become academies, and cutting the previous government&#x27;s school-building programme. He apologised, however, when the list of terminated school-building projects he had released was found to be inaccurate; the list was reannounced several times before it was finally accurately published.

In July 2010, Gove said that Labour had failed in their attempt to break the link between social class and school achievement despite spending billions of pounds: quoting research, he indicated that by the age of six years, children of low ability from affluent homes were still out-performing brighter children from poorer backgrounds. At a House of Commons Education Select Committee he said that this separation of achievement grew larger throughout pupils&#x27; school careers, stating, &quot;In effect, rich thick kids do better than poor clever children when they arrive at school [and] the situation as they go through gets worse&quot;.

Gove&#x27;s second home was not in his constituency, but in Elstead, in the South West Surrey constituency. Gove sold the house and began to commute to his constituency.

During the 2010 Conservative Party Conference, Gove announced that the primary and secondary-school national curricula for England would be restructured, and that study of authors such as Byron, Keats, Jane Austen, Dickens and Thomas Hardy would be reinstated in English lessons as part of a plan to improve children&#x27;s grasp of English literature and language. Academies were not required to follow the national curriculum, and so weren&#x27;t affected by the reforms. Children who failed to write coherently and grammatically, or who were weak in spelling, were penalised in the new examinations. Standards in mathematics and science were also strengthened. Gove won the &quot;Minister of the Year&quot; award at the 2011 &quot;Spectator&quot; awards,

In March 2011, Gove was criticised for not understanding the importance of school architecture and accused of having misrepresented the cost. In February 2011, he had told Parliament that one individual had made £1,000,000 in one year when the true figure was £700,000 for five advisers at different times over a four-year period.

During the Cameron–Clegg ministry, Gove was the subject of repeated criticism for alleged attempts to avoid the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. The criticism surrounded Gove&#x27;s use of various private email accounts to send emails that allegedly related to his departmental responsibilities. The allegations suggested that Gove and his advisers believed they could avoid their correspondence being subject to freedom of information requests, as they believed that their private email accounts were not subject to the Freedom of Information Act. In September 2011, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that Gove had used an undisclosed private email account—called &quot;Mrs Blurt&quot;—to discuss government business with advisers. In March 2012 the Information Commissioner ruled that because emails the &quot;Financial Times&quot; had requested contained public information they could be the subject of a freedom of information request and ordered the information requested by the paper to be disclosed. It was also alleged by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; that Gove and his advisors had destroyed email correspondence in order to avoid freedom of information requests. The allegation was denied by Gove&#x27;s department, which stated that deleting email was simply part of good computer housekeeping.

In June 2012, Michael Portillo backed Gove to be a serious contender in a future race for the Conservative Party leadership, though Gove had said in an interview a few months before that &quot;I&#x27;m constitutionally incapable of it. There&#x27;s a special extra quality you need that is indefinable, and I know I don&#x27;t have it. There&#x27;s an equanimity, an impermeability and a courage that you need. There are some things in life you know it&#x27;s better not to try.&quot;

Gove was criticised by teachers unions for his attempts to overhaul English education. At the Association of Teachers and Lecturers Annual Conference in March 2013 a motion of no-confidence in Gove was passed. The next month the National Union of Teachers passed a vote of no confidence in Gove at their annual conference and called for his resignation. The National Association of Head Teachers and NASUWT also passed motions of no confidence at their conferences that year.

=== Chief Whip (2014–2015) ===
On 15 July 2014, Gove&#x27;s four-year stint in charge of the Department for Education came to an end when he was dismissed as Secretary of State for Education and replaced by former Treasury Minister Nicky Morgan in a wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle. Gove was moved to the post of Government chief whip, which was portrayed as a demotion by his detractors; Prime Minister Cameron denied this was the case. Gove told BBC News that he had mixed emotions about starting the new role, saying it was a privilege to become Chief Whip but that leaving the Department for Education was &quot;a wrench&quot;.

The position came with a £30,000 pay cut, and a specific media role saw Gove on television and radio &quot;more than a traditional Chief Whip would be&quot;. He missed his first House of Commons vote in the new role, as explained by Shadow Commons Leader Angela Eagle; &quot;Gove not only lost his first vote but managed to get stuck in the toilet in the wrong lobby&quot;. Gove remained in the post of chief whip until May 2015, when the role was taken over by Mark Harper.

=== Justice Secretary (2015–2016) ===

At the 2015 general election, Gove was again re-elected, increasing his majority to 24,804 and increasing his vote share to 59.9%. Following the election, Cameron promoted Gove as Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor in his newly formed Cabinet. He was praised in December 2015 for scrapping the courts fee introduced by his predecessor, Chris Grayling. The fee had been heavily criticised for, among other things, causing innocent people to plead guilty out of financial concerns. Gove removed the 12-book limit on prison books introduced by Grayling, arguing that books increased literacy and numeracy, skills needed for making prisoners a &quot;potential asset to society&quot;. The move, effective from September 2015, was welcomed by Frances Cook of the Howard League for Penal Reform. Gove was also praised for his prominent role in scrapping a British bid for a Saudi prison contract.

Within three months of his taking office, the Criminal Bar Association (CBA) voted to stop taking new work in protest at Gove&#x27;s insistence that they work for lower fees. The CBA subsequently praised his &quot;courage&quot; in reversing the proposed cuts. On 14 July 2016 Gove was removed from the position of justice secretary by the new prime minister, Theresa May.

==== EU referendum (2016) ====

Gove was a prominent figure in the campaign for Britain to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum and described his decision to take that side as &quot;the most difficult decision of my political life&quot;. He and his family spent Christmas with the Camerons at Chequers where, according to Craig Oliver, Cameron was under the impression that Gove would support remaining in the EU. Despite this, Gove decided to support the Leave campaign. At the beginning of March 2016, he was appointed co-convenor of Vote Leave, with Labour MP Gisela Stuart, and given responsibility for chairing the campaign committee.

He argued Britain would be &quot;freer, fairer and better off&quot; for leaving, and that &quot;[t]he day after we vote to leave, we hold all the cards and we can choose the path we want.&quot; When in an interview it was claimed that there was no expert opinion to support this, Gove remarked that &quot;the people of this country have had enough of experts from organisations with acronyms saying they know what is best and getting it consistently wrong.&quot; However, interviewer Faisal Islam interrupted Gove after the word &quot;experts&quot;, causing some sources to report that he had made a general statement that &quot;the people... have had enough of experts&quot;. In 2021, Louise Richardson, the vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford, said she was &quot;embarrassed&quot; that Gove was an alumnus, on account of these comments.

In his memoir &quot;For the Record&quot;, Cameron described Gove during this period as &quot;mendacious&quot;, adding: &quot;One quality shone through, disloyalty. Disloyalty to me and, later, disloyalty to Boris [Johnson]&quot;.

==== Leadership election (2016) ====
After Cameron announced his intention to resign as prime minister, Gove was not a candidate, having said in the past that he had no interest in becoming prime minister. Instead, he was seen as a strong, highly influential supporter of Johnson for that role. In a move that surprised most political analysts, Gove withdrew his support for Johnson on 30 June 2016, hours before the deadline, without any previous notice to Johnson and announced his own candidacy in the leadership election. Subsequently, Johnson declined to run.

&quot;The Telegraph&quot; wrote in an opinion piece that Gove&#x27;s actions in undermining Johnson&#x27;s leadership aspirations constituted &quot;the most spectacular political assassination in a generation&quot; while &quot;The Guardian&quot; labelled it as a &quot;Machiavellian move&quot;.

Gove said: &quot;I wanted to help build a team behind Boris Johnson so that a politician who argued for leaving the European Union could lead us to a better future. But I have come, reluctantly, to the conclusion that Boris cannot provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead. I have, therefore, decided to put my name forward for the leadership. I want there to be an open and positive debate about the path the country will now take. Whatever the verdict of that debate I will respect it. In the next few days I will lay out my plan for the United Kingdom which I hope can provide unity and change.&quot;

By 5 July 2016, Gove was in third place in the leadership election, behind May and Andrea Leadsom; the latter had gained an endorsement from Johnson. Some political analysts predicted that Gove might quit the race if he was unable to beat Leadsom in the first round of voting. Later that day, it was announced that May had won the first round of voting, with support from 165 MPs, while Andrea Leadsom received 66 votes and Gove trailed with 48. Gove was eliminated in the second ballot after receiving 46 votes, compared to 199 for May and 84 for Leadsom. He subsequently told the media that he was &quot;naturally disappointed&quot; and described his two opponents as &quot;formidable politicians&quot;, welcoming the fact that the next prime minister would be female. He also encouraged a &quot;civilised, inclusive, positive and optimistic debate&quot;.

=== Return to the backbenches (2016–2017) ===

On 14 July 2016, Gove was dismissed by the prime minister, Theresa May. According to Jon Craig of Sky News, Gove was told to &quot;go and learn about loyalty on the backbenches&quot; in a two-minute meeting with May.

In the aftermath of the EU referendum, Gove was accused by Nick Clegg of being the source of a claim by &quot;The Sun&quot; that Queen Elizabeth II made comments supportive of Brexit in a private lunch at Windsor Castle. Clegg told a BBC documentary that Gove &quot;obviously communicated it – well, I know he did&quot;. &quot;The Sun&quot; said it had &quot;multiple sources&quot; and was confident its report was true.

In October 2016, Gove was elected to the Exiting the European Union Select Committee. That month, he was re-hired by &quot;The Times&quot; as a weekly columnist and book reviewer. As well as attending meetings of the newspaper&#x27;s politics team, Gove was dispatched to the United States to report on campaign rallies in the upcoming presidential election.

In December 2016, Gove defended a Vote Leave claim that an additional £350 million a week could be spent on the NHS when Britain left the EU. Gove said the figure was robust and it was up to the Government to decide how to spend it.

In his capacity as a writer for &quot;The Times&quot;, Gove gave the first British post-election interview to Donald Trump in January 2017, along with Kai Diekmann from &quot;Bild&quot;, making him the second British politician to meet Trump as President-elect of the United States after Nigel Farage. Despite preferring Hillary Clinton to Trump as President of the United States, Gove&#x27;s interview and consequent defence of it was seen as praising the President-elect unduly.

=== Environment Secretary (2017–2019) ===

At the snap 2017 general election, Gove was again re-elected, increasing his majority to 24,943 and increasing his vote share to 64.2%. Following the election, Gove was promoted to Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs by May during a reshuffle. Gove said he &quot;was quite surprised&quot; to be asked to join the Cabinet after May dismissed him in 2016 after she became prime minister.

Following his appointment, Gove announced that a microbead ban would be put into place by the end of 2017. However, the ban arrived in early 2018. It meant that manufacturers could no longer produce the tiny beads used in cosmetics and care products. Another ban came in June 2018 which stopped shops from selling products that contained the beads. The reasoning behind the ban was to stop the beads harming marine life.

In July 2017, Gove announced that a fuel combustion vehicle ban will be put into place due to air pollution. He said that the ban would take effect by 2040 and end the sales of new fuel combustion cars, trucks, vans, and buses that have petrol and diesel engines in the UK. The ban does not include plug-in hybrid vehicles.

Gove introduced a ban on bee-harming pesticides like neonicotinoids. He was praised by Greenpeace UK executive director John Sauven for his strong stance on issues like bee-harming pesticides, single-use plastic and the future of the internal combustion engine&quot;, adding &quot;Gove has defied many people&#x27;s expectations on the environment&quot;.

In October 2017, Gove issued an apology for a joke which compared tough interviews on the &quot;Today&quot; programme to a sexual encounter with Harvey Weinstein. He was criticised by political opponents who felt allegations of sexual abuse were not a suitable subject for jokes.

Other policies Gove had announced by December 2017 were that CCTV would be used in all slaughterhouses and beavers would be reintroduced into the UK.

Gove faced criticism over the appointment of Ben Goldsmith to the role of non-executive director at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs as Goldsmith had previously donated cash to Gove&#x27;s Surrey Heath constituency. Concerns were also raised about the selection process for the job, which was overseen by Sir Ian Cheshire, the chairman of Goldsmith&#x27;s investment firm, Menhaden Capital Management.

An important aspect of Gove&#x27;s tenure was the introduction of laws concerning animal welfare. Maximum sentences for the crime of animal cruelty increased, as did protection for animals used by Government services, such as police dogs and horses. One of the &quot;toughest worldwide bans&quot; on ivory trade was also introduced in 2018.

May offered Gove the post of secretary of state for exiting the European Union after Dominic Raab&#x27;s resignation over the Brexit withdrawal agreement in November 2018. Gove rejected the offer after May told him that there was &quot;no chance&quot; of trying to renegotiate the agreement.

Gove was portrayed by actor Oliver Maltman in the 2019 HBO and Channel 4 drama &quot;&quot;. In January 2019, May survived a vote of no confidence in her government, after a &quot;barnstorming&quot; speech from Gove directed towards the Leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn. The speech, which gained significant media attention, attacked Corbyn for his foreign policy record, with Tom Rogan of the &quot;Washington Examiner&quot; describing it as &quot;A tour de force. It was angry but not fanatical, passionate but not somber, and intellectual but simply put&quot;.

In March 2019, Gove argued that &quot;we didn&#x27;t vote to leave without a deal. That wasn&#x27;t the message of the campaign I helped lead. During that campaign, we said we should do a deal with the EU and be part of the network of free trade deals that covers all Europe, from Iceland to Turkey&quot;.

In April 2019, after having a meeting with Extinction Rebellion, Gove said he agreed with the activists that there needed to be a deeper level of public understanding over climate change, but he declined to declare a climate emergency in the United Kingdom. Despite Gove&#x27;s position, Parliament passed a motion to declare a climate emergency.

In May 2019, Gove introduced the Wild Animals in Circuses Bill, which banned the use of wild animals in travelling circuses in England.

==== Leadership election (2019) ====

On 26 May 2019, Gove announced he would stand for the Conservative leadership following May&#x27;s resignation, entering the contest. He promised to remove the charge for UK citizenship applications from EU nationals if elected, and to replace VAT with a &quot;simpler sales tax&quot;. He also planned to scrap the High Speed 2 rail project and increase school funding by £1 billion.

By 5 June 2019, Johnson became the clear frontrunner with the bookmakers, with Gove second favourite, followed closely by Jeremy Hunt. In June, reports emerged that Gove had taken cocaine as a journalist in his twenties. Gove stated that he regretted having done so, and regarded it as having been a mistake. In an article for &quot;The Times&quot; in December 1999, Gove had argued against the legalisation of drugs and criticised members of the middle classes for their hypocrisy in doing so. This was a key component of his bid to be leader. In reaction, Craig Oliver said it would have a negative impact on his run whereas fellow candidate for leadership Dominic Raab said he &quot;admires [Gove&#x27;s] honesty&quot;.

Gove progressed following the first ballot, having received 37 votes. He received 41 votes in the second ballot, and by the third ballot had 51 MPs backing him. The fourth ballot saw him gain 61 votes, moving him into second position. In the last ballot, he had 75 votes and was voted out – losing by only two to Hunt, the eventual runner-up.

=== Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (2019–2021) ===
Upon the election of Johnson as prime minister, Gove was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, legally representing the Crown as Duke of Lancaster. His non-portfolio role included responsibility for no-deal Brexit preparations, overseeing constitutional affairs, maintaining the integrity of the Union and having oversight over all Cabinet Office policy. Gove was excluded from a place on the National Security Council committee as Johnson pursued a slimming down of Cabinet operations. He became a central figure in the conduction of Operation Yellowhammer, the civil servant contingency planning for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.

Writing in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; on 28 July 2019, Gove said that a no-deal Brexit was &quot;a very real prospect&quot; and one that the Government was &quot;working on the assumption of&quot;. He said in August that it was &quot;wrong and sad&quot; that the EU was &quot;refusing to negotiate&quot; over a new withdrawal agreement. That month, an official Cabinet Yellowhammer document leaked, predicting that a no-deal Brexit would lead to food, medicine and petrol shortages. Gove said the leaked dossier outlined a &quot;worst-case scenario&quot;. Interviewed in September 2019, Gove declined to say whether the Government would abide by legislation designed to stop a no-deal Brexit.

In 2019, LBC&#x27;s Iain Dale placed Gove third in a list of that year&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Most Influential Conservatives&quot;. During the 2019 Speaker of the House of Commons election, Gove nominated Labour MP Chris Bryant to replace John Bercow. Gove helped to prepare Johnson for the 2019 general election debates by playing the role of the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. He offered to stand in for Johnson during a Channel 4 debate on environmental issues but the editor of &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; said the debate was only open to party leaders. At the 2019 general election, Gove was again re-elected, seeing his majority cut to 18,349 and with a decreased vote share of 58.6%.

Gove won the &quot;Minister to watch&quot; award at the January 2020 &quot;Spectator&quot; Parliamentarian of the Year awards. On 13 February 2020, he took on additional responsibilities as Minister for the Cabinet Office, succeeding Oliver Dowden, who had been appointed Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, in Johnson&#x27;s first large reshuffle of his government.

During the first COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, Gove generated confusion after saying on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; that children with separated parents were not allowed to move between their parents&#x27; homes. He later apologised and clarified that what he had said was not the case. When Johnson was self-isolating after having been tested positive for COVID-19, Gove stood in for Johnson briefly from 27 March 2020 at the daily briefings of the pandemic, until Gove self-isolated himself after a family member developed COVID-19 symptoms.

In May 2020, Gove was criticised after his wife Sarah Vine shared a bookcase picture &quot;as a very special treat for my trolls&quot; which featured a book by the Holocaust denier David Irving, and a copy of &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;, which controversially claims that intelligence is highly heritable and that median IQ varies among races. Another book in the photograph was &quot;The Strange Death of Europe&quot; by Douglas Murray, which, according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, cites Enoch Powell and argues for protecting white Christian Europe from &quot;outsiders&quot;.

After Johnson said that the UK had ended trade talks with the EU in October 2020, Gove said that the door was &quot;still ajar&quot; if the EU made changes over issues including fishing access and that &quot;We hope the EU will change their position and we are certainly not saying if they do change their position we can&#x27;t talk to them&quot;.

Gove was part of a committee of Cabinet ministers, comprising Johnson, Rishi Sunak and Matt Hancock, that made decisions on the COVID-19 pandemic. He was chair of the COVID-19 operations subcommittee. In a COBR meeting he chaired on 24 November 2020, he agreed, with the leaders of the UK&#x27;s devolved governments, to a set of rules governing social mixing for the whole of the country over the Christmas period. It allowed for up to three households to form a &quot;bubble&quot; from 23 to 27 December, but was cancelled for London and South East England, while being limited to a single day for the rest of England, after the discovery of a mutant COVID-19 strain.

Under the terms of England&#x27;s all-tier COVID-19 restrictions in December 2020, pubs were only legally allowed to serve alcoholic beverages with a substantial meal. Gove initially said that this did not include Scotch eggs, which he defined as a &quot;starter&quot; on multiple occasions (although he said it &quot;would count as a substantial meal if there were table service&quot;); however, he later backtracked and said: &quot;I do recognise that it is a substantial meal.&quot;

Gove was co-chair of the EU–UK Partnership Council with European Commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič. On 8 December 2020, after 10 months of talks with Šefčovič, he helped reach an agreement that included post-Brexit arrangements for the Irish border. As a consequence the Government decided to abandon parts of the Internal Market Bill that could have seen the UK break international law. David Frost succeeded Gove as the UK chair of the Partnership Council on 1 March 2021.

In the 2020 revival of &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, Gove&#x27;s puppet was given &quot;beady eyes, large ears and bulging cheeks&quot; and was voiced by Lewis MacLeod. In May 2021, Gove attended the 2021 Champions League Final in Porto with his son, supporting Chelsea; following his visit he was alerted by the NHS Test and Trace system of his potential exposure to the disease, and that he would need to self-isolate. Rather than isolating for the normal ten-day period, Gove was able to take part in a pilot scheme designed to investigate the efficacy of testing, which required him to self-isolate for only one day and undergo testing every day for a week.

In a case brought to the High Court of Justice by the Good Law Project in June 2021, Gove was found to have acted unlawfully when the Government awarded a COVID-19 contract without a tender to a polling company owned by long-term associates of his and Dominic Cummings, then Johnson&#x27;s chief adviser.

In July 2021, Gove worked part-time in Glasgow as part of the Government strategy to strengthen the Union. That month, a joint statement on behalf of Gove and Vine said that they had agreed to separate and were in the process of finalising their divorce. The next month, Gove was filmed dancing &quot;merrily&quot; at Bohemia nightclub in Aberdeen. He had allegedly tried to avoid a £5 entrance fee by stating he was the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Friends of Gove denied he had attempted to avoid paying. In January 2022, a divorce was granted on the grounds of Gove&#x27;s unreasonable behaviour.

=== Levelling up Secretary (2021–2022) ===
In a cabinet reshuffle on 15 September 2021, Gove was appointed Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government. He was given responsibilities for the Government&#x27;s levelling up agenda, the Union and elections, the last two of which he retained from his previous post. Within days his department was renamed the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, and his title changed to Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. He was given the additional title of Minister for Intergovernmental Relations.

In October 2021, while walking on Horseferry Road in Westminster, Gove was accosted by COVID-19 anti-lockdown protesters. As the protesters attempted to surround him, he was protected by police officers and escorted to a nearby building.

In December 2021, Gove was part of a trio of Cabinet ministers that self-isolated after meeting Australian Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, who was later diagnosed with COVID-19.

Gove launched a white paper on levelling up on 2 February 2022. The paper included plans to increase public investment across the UK and expand devolution in England. It was reported that parts of it had been copied from Wikipedia.

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Gove announced his intention to draft plans to allow Ukrainian refugees to be housed in Russian oligarchs&#x27; homes in the UK. He later announced the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which would arrange for British households to take in Ukrainian refugees.
Gove attended the 2022 Bilderberg meeting in Washington, D.C.

&quot;The Telegraph&quot; journalist Matthew Lynn attacked Gove&#x27;s record in government, describing him as the &quot;driving force behind a whole series of terrible policy mistakes&quot;. In particular, Lynn identified Gove&#x27;s resistance to new skyscrapers in London, his changes to the rules concerning the rental sector to make it harder for landlords to evict tenants, and his opposition to a fracking trial as damaging the economic growth prospects for the UK.

On 6 July 2022, Gove was dismissed by Johnson for alleged disloyalty, after visiting Downing Street to tell him to resign, during the July 2022 Government crisis. A Downing Street source described him as a &quot;snake&quot; following the sacking.

=== Later backbench career (2022) ===
Gove declined to run in the July–September 2022 Conservative Party leadership election. He endorsed Kemi Badenoch&#x27;s leadership bid and, after her defeat, announced his support for Rishi Sunak.

Following the election of Liz Truss, Gove variously backed and criticised the prime minister on Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng&#x27;s controversial reforms to taxation. According to the political editor of &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper, Harry Cole, Truss offered Gove the posts of British Ambassador to Israel and British Ambassador to China.

Gove declined to run in the October 2022 Conservative Party leadership election. He endorsed Sunak&#x27;s leadership bid.

=== Levelling up Secretary (2022–2024) ===
On 25 October 2022, following the accession of Rishi Sunak to the prime ministership, Gove was reinstated to his previous roles of Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities and Minister for Intergovernmental Relations. Gove had previously said that he did not expect to serve in government again.

According to &quot;The Times&quot;, in the February 2023 cabinet reshuffle, Sunak wanted Gove to become Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, but Gove asked to stay at the levelling up department.

In February 2023, following the death of Awaab Ishak, a two-year old child living in a mould-hit flat, the Government announced that it would implement &quot;Awaab&#x27;s Law&quot;, requiring social housing providers to remedy reported damp and mould within certain time limits. Gove made the announcement as he met with Awaab&#x27;s family in Rochdale.

In 2023 the &quot;New Statesman&quot; named Gove as the sixth-most-powerful right-wing figure in the UK, describing him as a &quot;great survivor&quot; and retaining extensive influence over the potential future leaders of the Conservative Party, even as he &quot;hints&quot; at quasi-retirement. In March 2024, he chaired the inaugural East-West Council in London.

Gove did not stand for re-election at the 2024 general election. His seat was won by the Liberal Democrat candidate, Al Pinkerton.

=== &quot;The Spectator&quot; (2024–present) ===
In September 2024, Gove was appointed editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot; by the magazine&#x27;s new proprietor, Sir Paul Marshall. He took on the role at the start of October.

In October 2024, Gove presented a five-part series for BBC Radio 4 called &quot;Surviving Politics with Michael Gove&quot;, in which he spoke with politicians from different parties about how to deal with the job when things get tough.

== Political positions ==
Gove is generally considered as combining socially liberal views—for example, on gay marriage—with a harder Eurosceptic and neoconservative position on foreign affairs. He has expressed his view that the state should generally not interfere in domestic affairs and has campaigned for economic freedom in certain matters. Gove has argued that &quot;the only sustainable ethical foundation for society is a belief in the innate worth and dignity of every individual.&quot;

In remarks prepared for the 2020 Ditchley Lecture, Gove portrayed what he saw as the malaise of modern society as leading to populism, because the non-intellectual classes &quot;chose to opt for polarised identity politics rather than stay with broad-based national political movements&quot; instead of choosing to follow the politics of diversity, inclusion and identity politics they were force-fed by the elites. He praised Franklin D. Roosevelt as a model for his renewal of capitalism and he imagined the construction of inclusive societies with the deconstruction of Whitehall. Gove stressed &quot;basic writing, meeting chairing and time management skills&quot; for all policy civil servants. He ended with a paean to his purpose in public service: &quot;to tackle inequality&quot;.

Gove has described himself as &quot;a proud Zionist&quot;, and supports the United Jewish Israel Appeal&#x27;s fundraising activities. In 2019, he reiterated &quot;One thing I have always been since I was a boy is a Zionist&quot; and spoke of his desire to &quot;celebrate everything that Israel and the Jewish people have brought to the life of this world and hold it dear to our hearts&quot; and that &quot;For as long as I have breath in my body and a platform on which to argue I shall be on your side, by your side and delighted and honoured to argue, powerfully I hope, on behalf of people who have contributed so powerfully to the life of this nation&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Gove met Sarah Vine in 1998, when he was comment editor and she was arts editor at &quot;The Times&quot;. They married in October 2001 and had two children. They divorced in January 2022. Gove has lived in Earl&#x27;s Court, Notting Hill, North Kensington, Mayfair and St James&#x27;s.

Following his appointment as Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss let Gove move in to her grace and favour flat at 1, Carlton Gardens while she lived elsewhere, despite him being a lower ranked minister. Following his appointment as Foreign Secretary, David Cameron allowed Gove to remain at the property.

Gove&#x27;s father, Ernest Gove, died in 2023.

<text>Pontic Olbia (; ) or simply Olbia is an archaeological site of an ancient Greek city on the shore of the Southern Bug estuary (&quot;Hypanis&quot; or &quot; Ὕπανις,&quot;) in Ukraine, near the village of Parutyne. The archaeological site is protected as the National Historic and Archaeological Reserve. The reserve constitutes a research and science institute of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. In 1938–1993 it was part of the NASU Institute of Archaeology as a department.

The Hellenic city was founded in the 7th century BC by colonists from Miletus. Its harbour was one of the main emporia on the Black Sea for the export of cereals, fish, and slaves to Greece, and for the import of Attic goods to Scythia.

== Layout ==

The site of the Greek colony covers the area of fifty hectares and its fortifications form an isosceles triangle about a mile long and half a mile wide. The region was also the site of several villages (modern Victorovka and Dneprovskoe) which may have been settled by Greeks.

As for the town itself, the lower town (now largely submerged by the Bug river) was occupied chiefly by the dockyards and the houses of artisans. The upper town was a main residential quarter, composed of square blocks and centered on the agora. The town was ringed by a defensive stone wall with towers. The upper town was also the site of the first settlement on the site in the archaic period. There is evidence that the town itself was laid out over a grid plan from the 6th century – one of the first after the town of Smyrna.

By the later period of settlement, the city also included an acropolis and, from the 6th century BCE, a religious sanctuary. In the early 5th century, a temple to Apollo Delphinios was also built on the site.

== History ==

===Archaic and Classical periods===
The Greek colony was highly important commercially and endured for a millennium. The first evidence of Greek settlement at the site comes from Berezan Island where pottery has been found dating from the late 7th century. The name in Greek means &quot;happy&quot; or &quot;rich&quot;. It is possible that it had been the site of an earlier native settlement and may even have been a peninsula rather than an island in antiquity. It is now thought that the town of Berezan survived until the 5th century BCE when it was possibly absorbed into the growing Olbian settlement on the mainland.

During the 5th century BCE, the colony was visited by Herodotus, who provides our best description of the city and its inhabitants from antiquity.

It produced distinctive cast bronze money during the 5th century BCE in both the form of circular tokens with Gorgon heads and unique coins in the shape of leaping dolphins. These are unusual considering the struck, round coins common in the Greek world. This form of money is said to have originated from sacrificial tokens used in the Temple of Apollo Delphinios.

M. L. West speculated that early Greek religion, especially the Orphic Mysteries, was heavily influenced by Central Asian shamanistic practices. A significant amount of Orphic graffiti unearthed in Olbia seems to testify that the colony was one major point of contact.

===Hellenistic and Roman periods===

After the town adopted a democratic constitution in the 4th century BCE, its relations with Miletus were regulated by a treaty, which allowed both states to coordinate their operations against Alexander the Great&#x27;s general Zopyrion in the 4th century BCE. By the end of the 3rd century, the town declined economically and accepted the overlordship of King Skilurus of Scythia. It flourished under Mithridates Eupator but was sacked by the Getae under Burebista, a catastrophe which brought Olbia&#x27;s economic prominence to an abrupt end.

Having lost two-thirds of its settled area, Olbia was restored by the Romans, albeit on a small scale and probably with a largely barbarian population. Dio of Prusa visited the town and described it in his &quot;Borysthenic Discourse&quot; (the town was often called Borysthenes, after the river).

The settlement, incorporated into the Roman province of Lower Moesia, was eventually abandoned in the 4th century CE, when it was burnt at least twice in the course of the Gothic Wars.

== Excavation ==

The site of Olbia, designated an archaeological reservation, is situated near the village of Parutyne in Mykolaiv Raion. Before 1902, the site was owned by the Counts Musin-Pushkins, who did not allow any excavations on their estate. Professional excavations were conducted under Boris Farmakovsky from 1901 to 1915 and from 1924 to 1926. As the site was never reoccupied, archaeological finds (particularly inscriptions and sculpture) proved rich. Today archaeologists are under pressure to explore the site, which is being eroded by the Black Sea. At 2016 started in Olbia excavations of the Polish Archaeological Mission &quot;Olbia&quot; of the National Museum in Warsaw headed by Alfred Twardecki. Many of the more notable finds from the period are visible in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

Notable finds from the town include an archaic Greek house in a good state of preservation from the area of the later acropolis and a private letter (written on a lead tablet) dating to around 500 BCE, complaining about an attempt to claim a slave.

<text>is a Japanese multinational electronics and electrical equipment company headquartered in Nagoya, Japan. Its products include printers, multifunction printers, desktop computers, consumer and industrial sewing machines, large machine tools, label printers, typewriters, fax machines, and other computer-related electronics. Brother distributes its products both under its own name and under OEM agreements with other companies.

== History ==
Brother&#x27;s history began in 1908 when it was originally called Yasui Sewing Machine Co in Nagoya, Japan. The company name derives from an early sewing machine model, the Brother, which itself was named for the Yasui brothers, Masayoshi and Jitsuichi. In 1955, Brother International Corporation (US) was established as their first overseas sales affiliate. In 1958 a European regional sales company was established in Dublin. The corporate name was changed to Brother Industries, Ltd. in 1962. Brother entered the printer market during its long association with Centronics.

In 1968, the company moved its UK headquarters to Audenshaw, Manchester, after acquiring the Jones Sewing Machine Company, a long-established British sewing machine maker.

In March 2005, &quot;Brother Communication Space&quot; (now the Brother Museum), a corporate museum that also serves as a public relations facility, opened in Nagoya.

In December 2011, Brother diversified its offerings by acquiring Nefsis, an innovator in web-based remote collaboration and conferencing software.
Brother competed heavily in the worldwide typewriter market, initially with its personal manual typewriters from its Nagoya factory and later with its own factories abroad (e.g., UK, USA), competing with brands that had dominated the international typewriter market—including with Japan&#x27;s Silver Seiko Ltd. and others. In the 1960s and 1970s, Brother, along with Japanese companies Silver Seiko and Nakajima, were frequent targets of antidumping campaigns in the United States and Europe—for their low-priced manual typewriters. In November 2012, Brother announced that it had built the last UK-made typewriter at its north Wales factory. It had made 5.9 million typewriters in its Wrexham factory since it opened in 1985. Brother donated the last machine to London&#x27;s Science Museum.

In September 2022, Brother celebrated a production milestone of 70 million home sewing machines made since mass production started in 1932.

== Sewing and embroidery machines ==

In 2010, the sewing divisions of Brother Industries around Europe were consolidated into one larger company called &quot;Brother Sewing Machines Europe GmbH&quot;. With a turnover in excess of €80 million, it is the fourth-largest company under the Brother Industries Ltd umbrella of organisations.

Brother Industries manufactures mechanical sewing machines in Zhuhai, China and computerised sewing and embroidery machines in Taiwan. A new sewing machine factory was opened in 2012 in Đồng Nai province, Vietnam, which is the largest single-brand sewing machine factory in the world.

In September 2012, Brother Industries manufactured their 50 millionth home sewing machine.

In May 2017, Brother Industries manufactured their 60 millionth home sewing machine.

As for industrial sewing machines, Brother introduced S-7300A &quot;NEXIO&quot; is the world&#x27;s first lockstitch sewing machine which adopts the Electronic Feed. NEXIO are world&#x27;s first IoT applicable industrial sewing machines . The visualisation by connecting sewing machine and computer technology enables the customer to analyze, manage processes and speed up productivity improvement and maintenance work.

=== History ===
In 1908, Kanekichi Yasui established Yasui Sewing and Co. that provided repair services and parts for sewing machines. Meanwhile, Masayoshi Yasui inherited his company and renamed it to Yasui Brothers&#x27; Sewing Machine Co.

In 1928, the company&#x27;s first product was a chain stitch sewing machine capable of producing straw hats. The machine was popular for its durability compared to German machines at the time.

They introduced and began mass production of home sewing machines in 1932, when Jitsuichi Yasui, Masayoshi&#x27;s younger brother and co-founder of their company, succeeded in developing shuttle hooks.

In 1934, they were renamed Nippon Sewing Machine Manufacturing Co. which they subsequently manufacture industrial sewing machines in 1936.

Their 200 HA-1 domestic straight stitching sewing machines were exported to Shanghai, being requested by the Japanese government.

In 1979, they introduced and manufactured their first computerised sewing machine called ZZ3-B820 &quot;Opus 8&quot;.

They started making commercial/multi needle sewing machines in 2003 with the introduction of the &quot;PR-600&quot;. 2010 marked their introduction of a PC design and editing software on their sewing/embroidery machines (&quot;Innov-is I&quot;) called PE-Design.

In 2013, they introduce a home cutting machine named the &quot;CM550DX&quot;.

For the Japanese market, Brother introduced a sewing and embroidery combination machine called &quot;Parie&quot; in 2017.

On 7 August 2018, Brother officially revealed their new 2019 sewing machine product lineup at their Back To Business Dealer Conference held annually in Orlando, Florida to commemorate Brother&#x27;s 100th anniversary since its inception in 1908. The newest top-of-the-line Brother sewing/embroidery/quilting machine is the Luminaire Innov-ìs XP-1. It features StitchVision technology, which uses light projections to virtually preview a stitch accurately and precisely, as well as a 10.6&quot; by 16&quot; maximum embroidery area.

== Other products ==
Brother diversified into manufacturing printers, label printers, MFCs, garment printers, music sequencers, manufacturing/machine tools, and Joysound karaokes in the 1960s.

Brother Industries, for an unknown period of time, produced many different word processor machines, but there is hardly any information backed up online regarding these products.
== Advertising and sponsorship ==
Brother sponsored Manchester City Football Club from 1987 until 1999, which is one of the longest unbroken sponsorship deals of any English football club.

Brother launched their first integrated, pan-European advertising campaign in Autumn 2010 for their A3 printer range. Titled &#x27;141%&#x27;, referring to the ratio between paper sizes A3 and A4.

In 2019 Brother&#x27;s UK subsidiary became co-sponsor of the , with the team&#x27;s name officially becoming &quot;Vitus Pro Cycling Team, Powered By Brother UK&quot;.

In 2019, Brother announced their co-sponsorship of the Japan Pavilion at the Expo 2020 in UAE.

<text>Jelgava () is a state city in central Latvia. It is located about southwest of Riga. It is the largest town in the Semigallia region of Latvia. Jelgava was the capital of the united Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (1578–1795) and was the administrative center of the Courland Governorate (1795–1918).

Jelgava is situated on a fertile plain rising only above mean sea level on the right bank of the river Lielupe. At high water, the plain and sometimes the town as well can be flooded. It is a railway center, and is also a host to the Jelgava Air Base. Its importance as a railway centre can be seen by the fact that it lies at the junction of over 6 railway lines connecting Riga to Lithuania, eastern and western Latvia, and Lithuania to the Baltic Sea.

== Name ==
Until 1917, the city was officially referred to as Mitau. The name of Jelgava is believed to be derived from the Livonian word &quot;jālgab&quot;, meaning &quot;town on the river.&quot; The origin of the German name &quot;Mitau&quot; is unclear, although it is suggested that it came from the Latvian words &quot;mīt&quot; or &quot;mainīt&quot;, meaning &quot;to exchange&quot; or &quot;to trade,&quot; thus making it &quot;trading-place.&quot; An alternate explanation is that &quot;Mitau&quot; came from &quot;Mitte in der Aue&quot;, which is German for &quot;the middle of the Aa&quot;, referring to the Lielupe River, formerly known as the Courland Aa (&quot;Kurländische Aa&quot; in German). 

In Yiddish, the city was known as מיטאַווע (&quot;Mitave&quot;) or מיטאַו (&quot;Mitar&quot;).

In publications dating from the Soviet period, the city name was occasionally spelled in English as &quot;Yelgava&quot;, a back-transliteration from Russian &quot;Елгава&quot;.

== History ==
Settlement began developing in the Mitau locality between the rivers Lielupe and Driksa during the 10th century. Led by the Grand Master , the crusading Livonian Order constructed the castle in Mitau on a natural island fortification (&quot;Pilssala&quot;) in 1265–1266. Using Mitau as a southern fortress, the German knights subdued the surrounding Livonians and Semigallians by 1290. The town rose in importance as a defensive fixture against the Lithuanians to the south, who succeeded in plundering Mitau in 1345.

As a result of the fall of the Livonian Order in the Livonian War of 1558-1583, Mitau became a town of the Duchy of Courland in 1561. Mitau received city rights in 1573, and became the capital of the united duchies of Courland and Semigallia in 1578. When the Duchy of Courland split in 1596, Mitau became the residence of Duke Friedrich Kettler of Semigallia. The city again became the capital of the united duchies in 1617. Because the duchy became a vassal of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from 1561, Mitau was also referred to by the Polish name &quot;Mitawa&quot;. The Commonwealth&#x27;s repeated wars with Sweden subjected Mitau to several sieges. Despite the wars, the city grew as a center for trade and industry. As Courland&#x27;s neighbors increased in strength, however, the duchy - and Mitau - began to fall under Russia&#x27;s sphere of influence.

The Tsar of Russia, Peter the Great, received a promise from duke Friedrich Wilhelm that he would marry one of the daughters of the tsar&#x27;s late half-brother. In 1710, Friedrich Wilhelm married Anna Ioannovna (daughter of Tsar Ivan V (), and herself later Empress of Russia), but on his way back from St Petersburg, he took ill and died (1711). Anna ruled as the duchess of Courland from 1711 to 1730.
The penultimate duke of Courland, Ernst Johann von Biron ( and 1763–1769), expanded the cultural aspects of Mitau. He constructed the ducal palace and opened the first public library in the city. In 1775 the last Duke of Courland, Peter von Biron (), founded the Academia Petrina, which became a cultural center for the country. The duke also encouraged theatrical performances at his court.

With the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, the citizens of Mitau clamored for more rights. Later, Imperial Russia annexed the city as part of Courland in 1795 during the Third Partition of Poland. The Count of Provence lived at the palace of Mitau (1798–1801 and 1804–1807) before he became the French king Louis XVIII in 1814. Although the city was occupied by Prussian troops during the Napoleonic Wars, it was largely spared destruction.
Mitau further expanded after the construction of its railway in 1868. The development of its infrastructure encouraged rural Latvians to migrate to the city, as merchants, craftsmen, teachers, and officials. By 1914 Mitau had over 45,000 inhabitants. However, Mitau suffered considerably after the outbreak of World War I in 1914. The spirited defence of Mitau by two battalions of the Latvian Home Guard in 1915 helped inspire the formation of the Latvian Rifles. German troops occupied the city during the war, and British prisoners of war, sent there as forced labour, suffered atrocious conditions and treatment. After the war, in 1919, Mitau became a battleground between Bolshevik Red Guards, German paramilitaries, and Latvian freedom-fighters. After the victory of the latter group in November 1919, Mitau, renamed to Jelgava, became an important city in independent Latvia. In 1925 a sugar factory was built in Jelgava, the first such factory in Latvia. In 1939 Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies opened in the Jelgava Palace.

As a result of the Nazi-Soviet Pact of 1939, Jelgava was occupied and annexed with the rest of Latvia by the Soviet Union in 1940. Many of the city&#x27;s remaining German population were resettled into the territory of German-occupied Poland during the Nazi–Soviet population transfers. German forces from Army Group North occupied Jelgava from 1941 to 1944 until the re-capture of the city by the Red Army. During World War II, German police along with Latvian auxiliary police murdered the Jewish inhabitants of the city during a series of mass shootings (see Jelgava massacres). The main synagogue was burned to the ground.
In late July 1944, the Soviet Red army launched an attack from the south in the direction of Jelgava and Tukums to encircle the German Army Group North. Jelgava was declared a fortress (&quot;Festung&quot;) however, there were only a few scattered German and Latvian units in the city. From 30 July until 7 August, after heavy street fighting and several air raids, the Red Army managed to occupy the left bank of the Lielupe river. In late August, the German army launched a counterattack on Jelgava from the north but it failed to drive back the Soviets. Jelgava remained on the frontline until 10 October when the German army retreated to Courland.
The city&#x27;s historic centre, industry, rail network, and public buildings were heavily damaged by the fighting, with almost 90% of the city destroyed. Among lost buildings was famous Kurland Provincial Museum and Athenaeum.

Jelgava was rebuilt in typical Soviet style after World War II as part of the Latvian SSR. Jelgava became home to several big factories. Among them were the sugar factory, which was heavily expanded from 1975 assembly line, and administration buildings for the Riga Autobus Factory (RAF).
Following Latvian independence, Jelgava has slowly regained its original Germanic heritage and is now a popular tourist site. Owing to Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies, many of Jelgava&#x27;s inhabitants are students or people connected with education. For this reason Jelgava is sometimes called the &quot;Student capital of Latvia&quot;.

==Climate==
Jelgava has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;).
== Demographics ==
As of 1 January 2022, the city had a population of 54,694. 

== Sights ==

Jelgava before the Second World War had regular, broad streets lined with the mansions of the Baltic German nobility who resided at the former capital of Courland. The old castle (1266) of the dukes of Courland, situated on an island in the river, was destroyed by Duke Biren, who had a spacious palace erected (1738–1772) by Bartolomeo Rastrelli at the bridge across the Lielupe. The palace contains the sarcophagi of almost all of the Curonian dukes, except the last one. The future Louis XVIII sojourned in the palace between 1798 and 1800. It now functions as Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies. Other landmarks include the Baroque church of (Liela Street 22a), the tower of the destroyed Jelgava (Akadēmijas Street 1), and two handsome structures: the and the Academia Petrina.

<text>Eliane Chantal Karp Fernenburg de Toledo (born 24 September 1953) is a Peruvian anthropologist. She was the First Lady of Peru from 2001 to 2006, as the wife of the erstwhile Peruvian president Alejandro Toledo. She specializes in the study of Andean indigenous cultures.

== Early life and education ==
Karp was born in Paris, France, to a family of Ashkenazi Jews (maternally Belgian-Jewish and paternally Polish-Jewish). During World War II, her father Charles Karp was persecuted by the Gestapo and later joined the French Resistance.

She completed her baccalaureate at the Lycée Français in Brussels, Belgium, and later earned a BA in anthropology in Israel, studying at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem with a specialization in Latin American studies. She also holds a Master of Arts in anthropology from Stanford University. Karp also completed a PhD in anthropology at Stanford University in the United States.

Karp has taken courses on indigenous communities at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, and has done graduate work on anthropology and economic development at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru.

=== Marriage and children ===
At Stanford, she met Alejandro Toledo, whom she married in 1972. Karp first came to Peru in the late 1970s to study its indigenous communities. In 1992 Karp and Toledo divorced and she returned to Israel with their daughter. The couple remarried and returned to Peru before her husband&#x27;s 1995 campaign.

== Career ==

=== Political career ===
In 1980, she began working for international organizations such as OAS, UNICEF and UNDP where she conducted impact measurement studies for development projects on indigenous populations.

In 1982 she served at the Agency for International Development (USAID) based in Lima, where she was a consultant until 1987.

Since November 1987 she started working at the World Bank in Washington D.C. as a project officer for Latin America and Africa until 1992.

Karp also served as an officer for Middle East in European Investment Bank. Karp returned to Israel, and worked at Bank Leumi, where she was in charge of developing relationships with foreign banks.

=== Academic career ===

Karp recently served as an adjunct professor at the Elliott School of International Affairs at the George Washington University. She is also a former Visiting Professor and Visiting Scholar at Stanford University department of Anthropology.

Karp was a distinguished fellow in residence at Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University and has also been a visiting professor at Salamanca University - Instituto de Iberoamérica.

==Tenure as First Lady of Peru==

During her husband&#x27;s 2001 presidential bid, Karp contributed to a campaign which drew deeply on Toledo&#x27;s indigenous heritage. She donned traditional Andean costume, rallied voters in Quechua, and demonstrated the couple&#x27;s commitment to indigenous issues. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;her flaming red hair and fiery speeches made her a popular and controversial fixture at campaign rallies.&quot;

In 2001, Karp became the first lady of the Republic of Peru when Toledo was elected president, a position she held until 2006. While in office, Karp became the honorary president of the Fund for the Development of Indigenous Communities of Latin America and the Caribbean.

=== CONAPA ===
Shortly after Toledo&#x27;s inauguration, his administration created the National Commission on Andean, Amazon and Afro-Peruvian Communities (CONAPA) of Peru, of which Karp served as president. The agency was meant to establish a development agenda for indigenous communities, provide representation of indigenous interests within the government, and lead the way to constitutional reforms that benefit indigenous peoples.

Others lamented the commission&#x27;s ineffectiveness. Noting its lack of funding and of implementing powers, Diana Vindling called it &quot;no more than a space for dialogue.&quot; On the other hand, Oxfam&#x27;s Martin Scurrah points out that the agency did good work. Noting that in addition to promoting a chapter on indigenous rights in the new constitution, Eliane Karp &quot;intervened on numerous occasions in support of or in defense of indigenous initiatives.&quot;

Some critics viewed the very creation of the commission as a step backwards for indigenous Peruvians, noting its leadership by a person with no official government position rather than a ministry head. The commission also absorbed the former SETAI (office of indigenous affairs), which reportedly led to a loss of autonomy and dynamism for that agency. Others complained that Karp&#x27;s leadership of the commission represented a conflict of interest, given her involvement in her own private NGO, Fundación Pacha.

In 2003, partly in response to these criticisms, Karp resigned from CONAPA, which was subsequently restructured as a national institute rather than a commission.

=== Machu Picchu Artifacts ===
Throughout Toledo&#x27;s presidency, Karp participated in negotiations with Yale University for the return to Peru of over 350 indigenous artifacts. The museum pieces were excavated from Machu Picchu around 1915 and sent to Yale on a twelve-month loan. On this matter, Peru had the support of the National Geographic Society and Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut. Negotiations stalled when the university refused to acknowledge Peru as the sole owner of the artifacts, but resumed under the García presidency.

In a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed, Karp accused Yale of waiting out &quot;Peru’s first elected indigenous president, until Peru had a new leader who is frankly hostile to indigenous matters.&quot; She also criticized the agreement between Peru and Yale that was finally arrived at in 2008. Under the terms of this agreement, Peru would have to build a museum and research center near Machu Picchu to Yale&#x27;s specifications before it could receive a portion of the articles for display and study. Most of the artifacts would remain with Yale.

=== Pacha Foundation for a Change ===
In 2001, Karp started Fundación Pacha, a non-profit organization that oversees development projects for indigenous Peruvians. The foundation &quot;places special emphasis on the design of sustainable development projects based on traditional and communal organizations and the development of productive skills to promote the comparative economic advantages of the Peruvian biodiversity and its rich potential for ecotourism.&quot;

Karp remained the head of the organization until 2006. Pacha&#x27;s micro projects have included giving Amazonian peoples vaccinations against yellow fever, hepatitis B and malaria, building basic community institutions, and providing equipment for basic medical care centers in rural areas with indigenous populations.

In 2002 Karp reached out to billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates in order to fund a vaccination program for the Candoshi tribes people. Gates was unwilling to help, and instead began humanitarian aid efforts in Africa and China. Since then Karp has criticized Gates for his unwillingness to help and acknowledges she felt it unfair to ignore Peru when conditions in rural Peru are just as dire as in other impoverished areas.

==Current activities==

=== Indigenous and women&#x27;s rights ===
Karp has shown support in favor of a push for more women in the Peruvian congress, and she acknowledges quotas as a means of achieving this.

In March 2012 Karp returned to Peru to pursue a teaching position at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, and in the fall she returned to teach anthropology in the Andean studies postgraduate program. She has also announced she will undertake a book which examines the role of indigenous populations as they integrate into the democratic political process.

In May 2012 Karp participated in a human rights conference organized by the Program on Human Rights and the Center for Latin American Studies of Stanford University, in which she called for a debate about the rights of indigenous peoples in Peru. Karp expressed &quot;We propose that social inclusion and equal citizenship are key factors for good governance... The indigenous worldview has to be respected and integrated in public policies.&quot;

In October 2012 Karp recounted her meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi, saying that it was inspiring and that she was impressed that Suu Kyi was able to stay so calm while being imprisoned for 15 years. Karp likened the situation to when she met the Dalai Lama, who is living in exile, and urged support for a petition going through the United Nations to help combat human rights violations.

=== Self-exile in Israel ===
On 12 May 2023, after her husband was extradited to Peru from the United States, Karp fled to Israel from the U.S. using her Israeli passport to avoid arrest on money laundering charges from the Peruvian justice. Peru does not have an extradition treaty with Israel.

On 18 May 2023, Peru&#x27;s Prosecution Office opened an extradition request to Israel, with a deputy assistant to the prosecution saying that even though Israel and Peru do not have an extradition agreement, Karp&#x27;s extradition &quot;is not impossible&quot;, and that new paths for the proceeding to take place will be considered.

<text>Uplawmoor is a village in East Renfrewshire, Scotland. Its population was 700 as of 2016.

Historic Uplawmoor, associated for centuries with the Barony of Caldwell and the Mure family, is still a vibrant community today, although bereft of the shops once to be found there. It has a primary school, hotel (Uplawmoor Hotel), village hall (Mure Hall), sports ground for tennis and football (including a playpark) and a golf club (Caldwell Golf Club). Nearby is the extensive Caldwell Estate with the roofless 18th century Caldwell House, which was designed by Robert Adam. The separate Caldwell Tower, of probable 16th century origin, is visible from the village. Several farms surround the village, as agriculture has always been of importance locally.

Historically the village was served by two railway lines - Lanarkshire and Ayrshire and Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway

Uplawmoor has a rural setting, with farmland on one side and mainly beech woodland (Pollick Glen and Shillford Woods, with numerous paths) on the other. Below lies the valley where are the A736 and Loch Libo, a Scottish Wildlife Trust Site Of Special Scientific Interest, the winter home of flocks of whooper swans. At the end of the loch is an area of large tussock sedges and on the far side is a striking waterfall among more woodland. The old hamlet of Shillford lies towards Neilston on the A736.

==Transport==

Caldwell station opened on 27 March 1871. The station was renamed Uplawmoor after the closure of the Uplawmoor station on the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway on 2 April 1962. The station closed permanently on 7 November 1966. A number of local campaigns to re-open the station have so far been unsuccessful. It has now become overgrown and only a platform remains to show that Uplawmoor actually had a railway line.

<doc id="1281111" wikidata="Q2917557" url="?curid=1281111" title="Abba Hushi">
<text>Abba Hushi (Also: Aba Khoushy; ; born Abba Schneller; 1898 – 24 March 1969) was an Israeli politician who served as mayor of Haifa for eighteen years between 1951 and 1969. Hushi was one of the founders and activists of Hashomer Hatzair movement in Poland. In July 1920, he settled to Mandatory Palestine with a group of 130 Jewish pioneers. There he took the Hebrew surname &quot;Hushi&quot; [&quot;speedy&quot;], a translation of his original name, Schneller. He built roads and drained swamps, and helped to found kibbutz Beit Alfa. He was one of the founding members of the Histadrut labor federation. In 1927, he settled in Haifa and joined the Ahdut HaAvoda party, which later merged with Mapai. He was secretary of the Haifa Workers Council from 1931 to 1951. Hushi was elected to Israel&#x27;s first Knesset in 1949 as a member of Mapai. Before the 1951 elections, he left the government to become mayor of Haifa. As mayor, he helped to found the University of Haifa, the Haifa Theatre, the Tikotin Museum of Japanese Art, the Mane-Katz Museum and the Carmelit (Haifa&#x27;s funicular railway).

Abba Hushi was the father-in-law of Knesset member Amnon Linn.

==Biography==

===Childhood and Aliyah===
====Family-background====
Abba Hushi was born in 1898 in Turka, Galicia, then part of Austria-Hungary (today in Ukraine). His mother, Liba, ran a small farm, where she grew fruits and vegetables. After divorcing her first husband, Liba moved to Turka and married Zisha, a haberdasher. To avoid the draft, Zisha changed his name to Alexander, took Liba&#x27;s surname, &quot;Schneller,&quot; and hid in the attic of Liba&#x27;s farmhouse.

The Schnellers had seven children: Ettia, Abba, Hinda, Ya&#x27;akov, Rosa, Malka and Harry from Liba&#x27;s first marriage.

====Education====
After attending a heder, Hushi studied at the local gymnasium. He spoke Yiddish, German, Hebrew, Ukrainian and Polish, and knew some Greek and Latin. He planned to study medicine and even wrote &quot;Property of Medical Student Abba Schneller&quot; on his notebooks, but his plans were disrupted by the outbreak of World War I in 1914. The Schneller family fled to Bohemia.

====Involvement in Hashomer Hatzair====

After the family&#x27;s return to Turka in 1918, the city fell under Polish rule. Antisemitism was on the rise, so a group of members of Hashomer Hatzair organized into an independent Jewish protection force. They were successful in Turka and stopped pogroms and other attacks, although in other cities throughout Poland these attacks continued.

On 4 and 5 August 1918, a Hashomer Hatzair conference was held in Turka. Hushi was one of the chairs of the conference, and there he called for immigration to the land of Israel. In the spring of 1920, at another Hashomer Hatzair conference in Lviv, Abba read publicly for the first time the words to his poem &quot;In the Galil, at Tel Hai&quot; inspired by the courage of Joseph Trumpeldor at Tel Hai. Indeed, the decisions made at the conference mirrored the spirit at Tel Hai: it was decided that the graduating group of Hashomer Hatzair would make Aliyah, and the workers of the movement would assist in the realization of this decision.

===Pioneer in Palestine===

====Road Worker====

The work office of the Hapoel Hatzair movement took responsibility for finding employment for its members of who had recently arrived in Palestine. Hushi&#x27;s group found work in paving roads, a project initiated by the first High Commissioner of Palestine, Herbert Samuel. Hushi worked on roads around Rosh Pinna, and in 1920 and 1921, Hushi was the head of the &quot;Shomria Unit,&quot; the group that paved the Haifa-J&#x27;da (a.k.a. Ramat Yishai) road.

====Haifa Port====
Abba Hushi and the other members of his group volunteered to unload coal at the Port of Haifa. The &quot;Workers of Israel&quot; fund received the contract to unload the coal, but the Haifa workers refused to unload the coal. Hushi and his co-workers volunteered for the difficult work, which left them covered in soot and often led to eye infections.

====Founding the Histadrut====
In December 1920, the &quot;Shomria Unit&quot; send two representatives, one of them Abba Hushi, to the &quot;First General Conference of the Workers of Israel.&quot; By the end of the conference, the delegates decided to establish a union for the Hebrew workers in the land of Israel; the Histadrut.

====Drying swamps and founding Beit Alfa====
In 1921, the members of the group transferred to Nahalal, where they paved the entrance road to the moshav and also worked in drying and draining the surrounding swamps. Abba Hushi petitioned on behalf of the entire group, for land in order to establish a settlement in the Jezreel Valley. In 1922, the request was approved and Hushi was among the founding members of kibbutz Beit Alfa.

====Delegate in the Diaspora====
After the establishment of the Kibbutz, Abba was sent by the Jewish National Fund to raise funds in Poland. The money would be used to buy land and establish settlements. Hushi was accompanied by Meir Ya&#x27;ari. In 1924, Ya&#x27;ari and Hushi arrived in Danzig, where they attended two conferences; the Hashomer Hatzair conference and the &quot;Youth Covenant&quot; movement conference (which David Ben-Gurion also attended). At the Hashomer Hatzair conference, Hushi was chosen for the board of the world Hashomer Hatzair movement.

After the conferences, Hushi and Ya&#x27;ari continued their fund-raising efforts on behalf of the JNF. They also visited local branches of, and summer camps run by Hashomer Hatzair throughout Poland in order to encourage the youths to make aliyah. Throughout the entire trip, Hushi corresponded with his girl friend Hannah, who remained in Beit Alfa. As part of his travels, Abba arrived in Turka, where, in February 1925, he convinced his family to make aliyah.

====Moving to Haifa====
In 1925, Hushi took a year off from the kibbutz to help his family settle in Haifa, and become acclimated with Israeli life. Hushi initiated the creation of a working-class restaurant that his family would own and operate, thereby earning a living. While in Haifa he continued his public service: on 19 April 1925, Hushi hosted a meeting of representatives from Kibbutzim that had foreign youths.

====Additional delegation abroad====
Following his great success on his previous trip to Poland, the Zionist committee asked Hushi to go abroad again. This time, he requested to travel with his girlfriend Hanna. The members of the kibbutz argued against his and Hanna&#x27;s departures. Hushi wrote to Hanna:
====Marriage to Hannah====
Hushi&#x27;s relationship with Hannah grew closer while they were in Turka, although Hannah&#x27;s father was not happy with the match. On Lag Ba&#x27;omer 1926, the Chief Rabbi of Haifa, Rabbi Kaniel, officiated at their wedding. On 29 March 1927, their daughter Ruth was born. Hannah remained in Beit Alfa while Hushi went to Haifa to help his family run the restaurant and continue his activities on behalf of the Histadrut. Hannah joined him in June. In September 1930, their son, Gadi, was born. Gadi died in an accident on 12 January 1932. Another son, Dan, was born the following year.

===Activity for the Histadrut in Haifa===
In 1925 Hushi moved to Haifa in order to assist his parents, but he continued being politically active. In 1926 he began to work for the Histadrut in Haifa, and would eventually become a central activist in the Ahdut HaAvoda and then Mapai parties.

====Treatment of the workers in the Port of Haifa====
In his first position in the Histadrut, Hushi substituted for Yaacov Razili, who failed to settle to confrontation between the longtime laborers in the port, and the new immigrants who were sent to work in the port by the Histadrut. After much hard work and tremendous effort, Hushi convinced the port workers to sign an agreement with the Histadrut.

====Secretary of the Haifa Workers Council====
In 1932, Hushi was chosen chairman of the Haifa Workers Council (a position that he held until 1951). He believed that it was upon the Council to create a connection with every worker in its jurisdiction (the city of Haifa). He also saw to it that in every workplace a &quot;worker&#x27;s committee&quot; was established (in workplaces where only a few people worked &quot;trustees&quot; were appointed) that would maintain contact between the workers and the Histadrut. Hushi&#x27;s actions caused a great increase in the number or workers who were associated with different labor organizations.

=====Building controversy=====

In 1934, Jewish contractors experimented with Arab workers, who were less expensive to employ than Jewish workers. The Histadrut responded with strikes and protests. The height of the controversy was in the Borovsky House construction site, where the contractor employed exclusively Arab workers, and didn&#x27;t &quot;reserve&quot; any jobs for Jewish workers. As a reaction, Hushi sent workers to picket the site, who disturbed the building process. The contractor complained to the police, and the picketing workers were arrested. Nevertheless, Hushi continued to send workers to protest. The protests continued for 684 days, and a total of 2259 days of jail time were served by workers who had picketed. By the end of the conflict, the contractor gave in and was forced to employ Jewish workers who were members of the Workers Council.

=====Assisting the unemployed=====
Due to the great stress that existed in Israel in the 1930s, Hushi worried about the unemployed workers in his city. As the secretary of the council, Hushi persuaded the other members to establish a staff that would look after the unemployed workers, and provide them with temporary work. The staff would find places of employment and divide the work among the unemployed workers, meaning that full-time workers had to give up on some work time to allow the unemployed people to come in and work. This style of distributing work differed from that practiced in other workers councils throughout Palestine. Among other things, the organization forced young workers and workers having other alternatives to relinquish their jobs to older, more seasoned workers, who had lost their places of employment.

=====&quot;Hapoel&quot; Organization=====

One of the first organizations that Hushi supported in Haifa was the Hapoel sports club. He was assisted by members of the organization &quot;The Organizer&#x27;s Division,&quot; in order to protect the institution of, and obedience to, the Histadrut and the Workers Council.

=====Bringing Thessaloniki port workers to Haifa=====
With the founding of the port of Haifa, Baruch Uziel, who had made Aliyah from Thessaloniki, Greece, convinced the Workers Council to bring on Aliyah Thessalonikian port workers, in order to guarantee a majority of Jewish port workers. As a result of Uziel&#x27;s request, Hushi traveled to Thessaloniki, where he successfully convinced the Jewish port workers to make Aliya with their families.
Following his success in Thessaloniki, Hushi traveled to Poland and managed to convince Jewish porters there also to make Aliya. The Aliya of the Thessaloniki port workers caused there to be a majority of Jewish workers in the port. This allowed operation of the port and the un-interrupted export of Jewish goods during the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. On May Day 1936, since there was a fear that the port workers would strike, Hushi ordered them to work, despite the fact that it was Workers&#x27; Day, and the port-workers strike was avoided. On 8 August 1936, the Arab workers ceased to come to the port to work, and the port was operated solely by Jewish workers for a number of months.

=====Boycott of German ships, Haifa 1938=====
On 29 December 1938, while loading citrus fruits onto the German ship &quot;Bamburg&quot; in the Port of Haifa, the second officer of the ship said to the port worker in charge of loading the fruits that &quot;the Jews have no place in the world, not even at the North Pole, [...] the only option was to send all of the Jews to &#x27;the second world.&#x27;&quot;

The Jewish workers who heard the officer&#x27;s words informed other workers, and word reached the administration of the Haifa Workers Council, who decided to stop loading the ship. The administration of the Council also instructed the Arab workers not to work, and the port stopped servicing German ships. Hushi informed Dov Hoz, the chairman of the State Committee of the Jewish Agency, of the decision. David Hacohen informed Hushi of his disapproval of the decision, since it had not been approved by the official organizations of the Yishuv, despite the fact that the Workers Council of the Histadrut had approved the new policy.

On the following day, 30 December, the German consul in Haifa turned to influential Olim from Germany to have them convince Hushi to call off the new policy. The consul announced that the Second Officer would apologize and would be punished for his offensive remarks, but Hushi did not relent, and the &quot;Bamburg&quot; returned to Germany empty.
In order not to hurt the interests of the Jewish Yishuv, Hushi contacted &quot;Citrus Center&quot; in Jaffa with a request to find other ships with which to send their produce to Europe. He wrote to them: &quot;We do not want to cause you [financial] loss, and therefore we are giving you options and time to organize the matter. We are not able to overcome our emotions, and the emotions of our workers, to continue to load German ships.&quot;

<doc id="1281127" wikidata="Q278711" url="?curid=1281127" title="Praxilla">
<text>Praxilla (), was a Greek lyric poet of the 5th century BC from Sicyon on the Gulf of Corinth. Five quotations attributed to Praxilla and three paraphrases from her poems survive. The surviving fragments attributed to her come from both religious choral lyric and drinking songs (skolia); the three paraphrases are all versions of myths. Various social contexts have been suggested for Praxilla based on this range of surviving works. These include that Praxilla was a hetaira (courtesan), or that she was a professional musician. Alternatively, the apparent implausibility of a respectable Greek woman writing drinking songs has been explained by suggesting that her poetry was in fact composed by two different authors, or that the drinking songs derive from a non-elite literary tradition rather than being authored by a single writer. 

Praxilla was apparently well-known in antiquity: she was sculpted in bronze by Lysippus and parodied by Aristophanes. In the modern world, she has been referenced in artworks by Cy Twombly and Judy Chicago, and one of her poems was adapted by the Irish poet Michael Longley.

==Life==
Praxilla was from Sicyon on the Gulf of Corinth. Eusebius dates her &quot;floruit&quot; to 451/450 BC (the second year of the 82nd Olympiad). No ancient sources give details about Praxilla&#x27;s life.

==Poetry==
Little of Praxilla&#x27;s work survives – five fragments in her own words, and three paraphrases by other authors. The longest surviving fragment is three lines. These vary in style: two are skolia (drinking songs), one is in the metre named the Praxilleion after her, one is a hymn to Adonis, and one is a dithyramb. The three works known only in paraphrase are all versions of myths. In the second century AD, Athenaeus reports that Praxilla was particularly known for her skolia. The small amount of Praxilla&#x27;s work which survives makes it hard for modern critics to judge. 

===Hymn to Adonis===

Three lines of Praxilla&#x27;s hexameter hymn to Adonis are quoted by Zenobius. In them, Adonis is asked in the underworld what he will most miss from the mortal world. He replies that he will miss the sun, stars, and moon, cucumbers, apples, and pears. Maria Panagiotopoulou argues that both the structure of these lines and Praxilla&#x27;s use of the word allude to Sappho 16. The reference to cucumbers, apples, and pears may allude to the vegetables used in the Adonia, a festival commemorating the death of Adonis, and the poem may have been performed there. Alternatively as all three vegetables had sexual connotations in ancient Greek literature it may have been performed at symposia.

===Praxilleion===
Praxilla was believed to have invented a metre called the Praxilleion, which according to the Byzantine grammarian Trichas she used frequently. A couplet quoted by Hephaestion to illustrate the metre is attributed to her on that basis. This fragment is usually thought to have been from a skolion, and commonly interpreted as being about a prostitute or hetaira. More recently, Vanessa Cazzato has argued that it is in fact a wedding song.

===Skolia===
Two of the skolia quoted by Athenaeus, who associates Praxilla with this genre, are attributed to her by other sources. Because respectable women in classical Greece would normally have been excluded from the parties where such songs were performed, there has been some scholarly debate about her social position. Martin Litchfield West suggests that there were two Praxillas, one writing the skolia; the other, the more &quot;respectable&quot; choral songs and hymns. Other scholars have argued that, based on the attribution of skolia to Praxilla, she must have been a hetaira, though Jane McIntosh Snyder notes that there is no external evidence for this thesis. Ian Plant suggests the alternative hypothesis that she was a professional musician, composing songs for symposia because there was a market for such works.

Alternatively, West suggests that the skolia were not written by Praxilla at all. Gregory Jones agrees, and argues that all of the surviving skolia attributed to particular poets are in fact derived from a non-elite oral literary tradition. Marchinus Van der Valk, who also endorses this theory, allows for the possibility that some skolia were &quot;derived from&quot; Praxilla&#x27;s poetry and published in antiquity attributed to her.

===Dithyramb to Achilles===
A single line of a dithyramb titled &quot;Achilles&quot; is quoted by Hephaestion. The surviving text of this poem seems to refer to Achilles&#x27; anger at Agamemnon which leads to the events of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;.

==Reception==

Praxilla was well regarded in antiquity. Antipater of Thessalonica lists her first among his canon of nine &quot;immortal-tongued&quot; women poets, and the sculptor Lysippus (also from Sicyon) sculpted her in bronze. She was sufficiently well-known in classical Athens that two of Aristophanes&#x27; surviving plays (&quot;The Wasps&quot; and &quot;Thesmophoriazusae&quot;) parody her work, and part of one of her poems is inscribed on a red-figure cup dating to about 470 BC. Her poetry was still remembered many centuries after her death: the Hellenistic epigrammatist Asclepiades imitated one of her poems; in the second century AD, her name was remembered in the proverb &quot;sillier than Praxilla&#x27;s Adonis&quot;, and the author Tatian cites her in his &quot;Address to the Greeks&quot;. Her name was still known in the twelfth century, when Eustathias included her in a list of five female poets in his commentary on the &quot;Iliad&quot;.

Praxilla was included in Judy Chicago&#x27;s &quot;Heritage Floor&quot;, as one of the women associated with the place-setting for Sappho in &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;. Cy Twombly includes text from a poem by Praxilla in his 1960 painting &quot;Untitled (at Sea)&quot;. One of her fragments was adapted by Michael Longley in his poem &quot;Praxilla&quot;, from the 2004 collection &quot;Snow Water&quot;. She features in the video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Odyssey&quot;.

<doc id="1281139" wikidata="Q739484" url="?curid=1281139" title="Pico da Neblina">
<text>Pico da Neblina (, &quot;Mist Peak&quot;) is the highest peak in Brazil, above sea level, in the Serra da Neblina, part of the Serra do Imeri, a section of the Guiana Highlands on the Brazil-Venezuela border. As determined by a border survey expedition in 1962, its summit lies just within Brazilian territory, at a horizontal distance of only from the Venezuelan border at Pico 31 de Março. It is a common misconception to refer to this mountain as the highest point in South America outside the Andes while ignoring the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in Colombia.

As the peak&#x27;s name suggests, it is shrouded in dense clouds most of the time. It was first ascended in 1965 by members of a Brazilian Army expedition.

==Location==

Officially, Pico da Neblina is located in the municipality of Santa Isabel do Rio Negro, state of Amazonas. However, the mountain is not directly accessible from the urban seat of the municipality, which is about away, and federal authority over the national park, the Yanomami reservation and the border security area supersedes municipal authority in all practical respects. The nearest city is actually São Gabriel da Cachoeira, about in a straight line, from where virtually all climbing expeditions depart.

The mountain is contained in the Brazilian Pico da Neblina National Park; its northern slopes are also protected in Venezuela&#x27;s Serranía de la Neblina National Park. The twin parks, together with the neighbouring Parima Tapirapecó National Park (Venezuela), form a protected area complex of about 80,000 km², possibly the largest national park system in tropical rainforests in the world. Pico da Neblina is also located within the territory of the Yanomami people&#x27;s reservation.

==Common misconceptions==

Pico da Neblina is often mentioned as being on the exact border between Brazil and Venezuela. This is true for its massif as a whole, but the main summit is wholly in Brazil, 687 metres from the actual border. It is also sometimes mentioned as being the highest point in South America outside of the Andes, but this is not correct either: the title belongs to Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in Colombia, which is almost twice the height of Pico da Neblina and completely detached from the Andes. However, Pico da Neblina is indeed the highest point &quot;east&quot; of the Andes range, and therefore of a large portion of the continent. Neighbouring Pico 31 de Março, which &quot;is&quot; on the precise international border, is also the highest point in Venezuela outside of the Andes.

==Elevation measurements==

For 39 years, based on an uncontested measurement performed in 1965 by topographer José Ambrósio de Miranda Pombo, using a theodolite, the elevation of Pico da Neblina was thought to be , but a much more accurate measurement performed in 2004 with state-of-the-art GPS equipment by cartographer Marco Aurélio de Almeida Lima, a member of a Brazilian Army expedition, put it at . This was then officially recognised by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the federal government&#x27;s official geographic survey and census agency, which jointly organised the expedition.

In February 2016, IBGE slightly revised again the official altitude of Pico da Neblina to , a 1.52-metre difference. There was no new expedition or field measurement at the time; the new value is simply a mathematical recalculation of the altitude, based on the previously obtained GPS field data, taking into account a newly available, more precise mapping of the Brazilian territory regarding the geoid (the imaginary surface based on the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field that is the reference for altitudes). This explains why Pico da Neblina and Pico 31 de Março, which are next to each other, had both exactly the same altitude correction.

==Geology and topography==
The Neblina Massif is composed of a tilted block of sandstone overlying Precambrian metamorphic rocks. The peak is an impressive sharp rock pyramid or tooth, towering high (when the peak is visible) over the nearby lowlands on the Brazilian side, as the Imeri range quickly rises from only about 100 metres above sea level to about 2,000 metres at the base of the peak in just a few kilometres; from there the peak rises sharply.

The Venezuelan side of the massif is hillier and the altitude gradient to the northern plains is less abrupt, although deep chasms and high walls still exist. Neighbouring Pico 31 de Março can be considered a secondary summit of Pico da Neblina; it has a smoother, rounder shape and is sometimes difficult to be clearly distinguished from Pico da Neblina on photographs, depending on angle and distance. Due to Pico da Neblina&#x27;s equatorial latitude, while it can be cold on top, sub-freezing temperatures and frost appear to be rare (no permanent measurements are undertaken), and there is no snow. One non-authoritative source gives an average temperature of during the day and at night.

==Discovery==
There is little documentation available today on the peak&#x27;s discovery, and virtually none of it is authoritative, even though Brazilians only discovered the mountain fairly recently, in the mid-20th century. This late discovery can be understood if one remembers how extremely remote, inaccessible and uninhabited that part of the Amazon region is even today, and that it could hardly be expected that such a high mountain (by Brazilian standards) could be found standing next to the vast, low-lying Amazon Basin, even though it was known that there were mountains in that area. Moreover, as its own name states, Pico da Neblina is clouded and hidden from view most of the time.

All this led to it only being discovered in the 1950s. The exact date and circumstances are obscure and not documented, but a popular story often heard in Brazil says that it was supposedly seen and reported by an airline pilot who overflew it at a luckily cloudless moment. However, the massif was known well before that on the Venezuelan side, where it was called &quot;Cerro Jimé&quot;. In 1954, eight years before the Pico da Neblina was successfully climbed, the area was visited from the north by an expedition led by botanist Bassett Maguire, who reached the northern summit plateau of the massif and observed the highest peak, then unnamed, estimating it to be between &quot;8,000-9,000 feet&quot;. The whole massif was named &quot;Cerro de la Neblina&quot;, since Maguire and Reynolds considered at the time that the massif constituted a separate formation from the Imeri range to the southeast.

Soon after the expedition, the highest peak, although unclimbed, was named &quot;Pico Phelps&quot; in honour of eminent ornithologist William H. Phelps Jr. At that time, the peak was thought to lie entirely within Venezuelan territory. During the 1962 Brazilian expedition, it was determined that the highest summit lies entirely in Brazil. The Brazilian expedition renamed the summit peak to &quot;Pico da Neblina&quot;, causing some confusion with the name &quot;Cerro de la Neblina&quot;, which is used in Venezuela to refer to the whole massif. The subsidiary summit on the Venezuelan-Brazilian border was named &quot;Pico 31 de Março&quot; in Brazil, but it is now known as &quot;Pico Phelps&quot; in Venezuela.

In the 1950s, it was not yet clear whether Pico da Neblina was in Brazilian or Venezuelan territory, and its precise elevation was not yet known. Therefore, it was still widely held for many years after the peak&#x27;s discovery that Brazil&#x27;s highest mountain was Pico da Bandeira (2,891 m or 9,486 ft), between the southeastern states of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo, in a much more populated, developed and easily accessible region. Only in 1965 it was found and became widely known that Pico da Neblina was the country&#x27;s highest mountain. Pico da Bandeira remains the highest Brazilian mountain outside of the Amazon region, and the third-highest overall, after Pico da Neblina and 31 de Março.

==Access==

Due to its location in a national park in a border area that is also part of Yanomami territory, access to the area is restricted and depends on a special permit by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio), the Brazilian government organisation responsible for national parks. The permit can be obtained at ICMBio&#x27;s office in São Gabriel da Cachoeira, but all climbers must take an accredited local guide. A four-day trek each way should be expected, three of which consisting of a jungle trek in the rainforest that can be as hard and challenging as the climb itself. Rescue is close to impossible in the area.

Onchocerciasis or &quot;river blindness,&quot; a parasitic disease that can cause permanent blindness and is transmitted by a black fly, is endemic in the area, albeit with a low incidence; malaria and yellow fever transmission are also possible. Therefore, climbers are advised not only to take the utmost precaution in avoiding insect bites but also to discuss preventive and/or therapeutic strategies with qualified physicians who are familiar with tropical diseases.

Robson Czaban, a Brazilian photographer who climbed Pico da Neblina in 1998, reports on his adventure account (in Portuguese) that there are always some gold panners on a small plateau just below the peak, at about , called Garimpo do Tucano, which serves as the base camp for the last and steepest part of the climb. While the panners&#x27; presence there is technically illegal, they are widely tolerated by Brazilian authorities, and Czaban speculates that this would be because in such a remote area, they are believed to watch the border and nature better than the park rangers and the army would have the means to do. Czaban reports them to be very friendly and helpful.

<text>San Antonio, officially the Municipality of San Antonio (, Kapampangan: &quot;Balen ning San Antonio&quot;), is a municipality in the province of Nueva Ecija, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 83,060 people.

==Etymology==
The present name of the town was given in 1843 in honor of the patron saint, San Antonio Abad, by Father Leocadio Luis, the first priest of the town. Before its organization and recognition as a town by means of a decree promulgated during the Spanish regime, this was a barangay of Gapan and was known as Barrio Delinquente.

==History==
San Antonio was previously called as the barrio of Delinquente (lit. &quot;outlaw&quot;) as old residents claimed that the name Delinquente originated by the sinking of a Casco (big boat or banca) fully loaded with palay in Pampanga River.

It was partitioned from the town of Gapan in 1843 by the order of Governor-General Marcelino Oraa, along with the town of San Isidro. The movement of the separation of Barrio Delinquente from the town of Gapan, and its organization as an independent municipality was ignited in 1839. The petition of the residents of Barrio Delinquente was finally approved in November 1842 but the definite separation from the town of Gapan took place in 1843. San Antonio, along with its origin Gapan, Aliaga, Cabiao, and San Isidro were transferred from Pampanga to Nueva Ecija in 1848.

It is bounded by the towns of Jaen to its eastern side, Zaragosa is to the north, Cabiao and San Isidro, and Concepcion in the Province of Tarlac is at its western border.

Travelling from the Philippine capital city of Manila, a popular route going to San Antonio is via the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX). Turning north-east and exiting the NLEX at the San Simon junction, the journey continues to Arayat, the last town of Pampanga before reaching Cabiao. From Cabiao, one can opt to continue towards the town of San Isidro and then take a left turn towards Jaen and then before Jaen town proper take another turn towards San Antonio. There is an alternative backroad route leading to the southern part of San Antonio and this can be taken immediately after entering Brgy. Concepcion, turning left towards the Santa Isabel Bridge which crosses the Pampanga river.

The older and now slower route is the bus transport route which leaves the NLEX at Santa Rita and traverses the Pan-Philippine Highway across the length of the Province of Bulacan up to Gapan in Nueva Ecija and turning left on the Gapan-Olongapo Road.

<text>Resistance thermometers, also called resistance temperature detectors (RTDs), are sensors used to measure temperature. Many RTD elements consist of a length of fine wire wrapped around a heat-resistant ceramic or glass core but other constructions are also used. The RTD wire is a pure material, typically platinum (Pt), nickel (Ni), or copper (Cu). The material has an accurate resistance/temperature relationship which is used to provide an indication of temperature. As RTD elements are fragile, they are often housed in protective probes.

RTDs, which have higher accuracy and repeatability, are slowly replacing thermocouples in industrial applications below 600 °C.

==Resistance/temperature relationship of metals==

Common RTD sensing elements for biomedical application constructed of platinum (Pt), nickel (Ni), or copper (Cu) have a repeatable, resistance versus temperature relationship (&quot;R&quot; vs &quot;T&quot;) and operating temperature range. The &quot;R&quot; vs &quot;T&quot; relationship is defined as the amount of resistance change of the sensor per degree of temperature change. The relative change in resistance (temperature coefficient of resistance) varies only slightly over the useful range of the sensor.

Platinum was proposed by Sir William Siemens as an element for a resistance temperature detector at the Bakerian lecture in 1871: it is a noble metal and has the most stable resistance–temperature relationship over the largest temperature range. Nickel elements have a limited temperature range because the temperature coefficient of resistance changes at temperatures over 300 °C (572 °F). Copper has a very linear resistance–temperature relationship; however, copper oxidizes at moderate temperatures and cannot be used over 150 °C (302 °F).

The significant characteristic of metals used as resistive elements is the linear approximation of the resistance versus temperature relationship between 0 and 100 °C. This temperature coefficient of resistance is denoted by α and is usually given in units of Ω/(Ω·°C):
: formula_1
where
: formula_2 is the resistance of the sensor at 0 °C,
: formula_3 is the resistance of the sensor at 100 °C.

Pure platinum has α = 0.003925 Ω/(Ω·°C) in the 0 to 100 °C range and is used in the construction of laboratory-grade RTDs. Conversely, two widely recognized standards for industrial RTDs IEC 60751 and ASTM E-1137 specify α = 0.00385 Ω/(Ω·°C). Before these standards were widely adopted, several different α values were used. It is still possible to find older probes that are made with platinum that have α = 0.003916 Ω/(Ω·°C) and 0.003902 Ω/(Ω·°C).

These different α values for platinum are achieved by doping – carefully introducing impurities, which become embedded in the lattice structure of the platinum and result in a different &quot;R&quot; vs. &quot;T&quot; curve and hence α value.

==Calibration==
To characterize the &quot;R&quot; vs &quot;T&quot; relationship of any RTD over a temperature range that represents the planned range of use, calibration must be performed at temperatures other than 0 °C and 100 °C. This is necessary to meet calibration requirements. Although RTDs are considered to be linear in operation, it must be proven that they are accurate with regard to the temperatures with which they will actually be used (see details in Comparison calibration option). Two common calibration methods are the fixed-point method and the comparison method.
;Fixed-point calibration: is used for the highest-accuracy calibrations by national metrology laboratories. It uses the triple point, freezing point or melting point of pure substances such as water, zinc, tin, and argon to generate a known and repeatable temperature. These cells allow the user to reproduce actual conditions of the ITS-90 temperature scale. Fixed-point calibrations provide extremely accurate calibrations (within ±0.001 °C). A common fixed-point calibration method for industrial-grade probes is the ice bath. The equipment is inexpensive, easy to use, and can accommodate several sensors at once. The ice point is designated as a secondary standard because its accuracy is ±0.005 °C (±0.009 °F), compared to ±0.001 °C (±0.0018 °F) for primary fixed points.
;Comparison calibrations: is commonly used with secondary standard platinum resistance thermometers and industrial RTDs. The thermometers being calibrated are compared to calibrated thermometers by means of a bath whose temperature is uniformly stable. Unlike fixed-point calibrations, comparisons can be made at any temperature between −100 °C and 500 °C (−148 °F to 932 °F). This method might be more cost-effective, since several sensors can be calibrated simultaneously with automated equipment. These electrically heated and well-stirred baths use silicone oils and molten salts as the medium for the various calibration temperatures.

==Element types==
The three main categories of RTD sensors are thin-film, wire-wound, and coiled elements. While these types are the ones most widely used in industry, other more exotic shapes are used; for example, carbon resistors are used at ultra-low temperatures (−273 °C to −173 °C).

;Carbon resistor elements: are cheap and widely used. They have very reproducible results at low temperatures. They are the most reliable over extremely wide range of temperatures. They generally do not suffer from significant hysteresis or strain gauge effects.
;Strain-free elements: use a wire coil minimally supported within a sealed housing filled with an inert gas. These sensors work up to and are used in the SPRTs that define ITS-90. They consist of platinum wire loosely coiled over a support structure, so the element is free to expand and contract with temperature. They are very susceptible to shock and vibration, as the loops of platinum can sway back and forth, causing deformation.
;Thin-film elements: have a sensing element that is formed by depositing a very thin layer of resistive material, normally platinum, on a ceramic substrate (plating). This layer is usually just 10 to 100 ångströms (1 to 10 nanometers) thick. This film is then coated with an epoxy or glass that helps protect the deposited film and also acts as a strain relief for the external lead wires. Disadvantages of this type are that they are not as stable as their wire-wound or coiled counterparts. They also can only be used over a limited temperature range due to the different expansion rates of the substrate and resistive deposited giving a &quot;strain gauge&quot; effect that can be seen in the resistive temperature coefficient. These elements work with temperatures to without further packaging, but can operate up to when suitably encapsulated in glass or ceramic. Special high-temperature RTD elements can be used up to with the right encapsulation.
;Wire-wound elements: can have greater accuracy, especially for wide temperature ranges. The coil diameter provides a compromise between mechanical stability and allowing expansion of the wire to minimize strain and consequential drift. The sensing wire is wrapped around an insulating mandrel or core. The winding core can be round or flat, but must be an electrical insulator. The coefficient of thermal expansion of the winding core material is matched to the sensing wire to minimize any mechanical strain. This strain on the element wire will result in a thermal measurement error. The sensing wire is connected to a larger wire, usually referred to as the element lead or wire. This wire is selected to be compatible with the sensing wire, so that the combination does not generate an emf that would distort the thermal measurement. These elements work with temperatures to 660 °C.
;Coiled elements: have largely replaced wire-wound elements in industry. This design has a wire coil that can expand freely over temperature, held in place by some mechanical support, which lets the coil keep its shape. This “strain free” design allows the sensing wire to expand and contract free of influence from other materials; in this respect it is similar to the SPRT, the primary standard upon which ITS-90 is based, while providing the durability necessary for industrial use. The basis of the sensing element is a small coil of platinum sensing wire. This coil resembles a filament in an incandescent light bulb. The housing or mandrel is a hard fired ceramic oxide tube with equally spaced bores that run transverse to the axes. The coil is inserted in the bores of the mandrel and then packed with a very finely ground ceramic powder. = This permits the sensing wire to move, while still remaining in good thermal contact with the process. These elements work with temperatures to 850 °C.

The current international standard that specifies tolerance and the temperature-to-electrical resistance relationship for platinum resistance thermometers (PRTs) is IEC 60751:2008; ASTM E1137 is also used in the United States. By far the most common devices used in industry have a nominal resistance of 100 ohms at 0 °C and are called Pt100 sensors (&quot;Pt&quot; is the symbol for platinum, &quot;100&quot; for the resistance in ohms at 0 °C). It is also possible to get Pt1000 sensors, where 1000 is for the resistance in ohms at 0 °C. The sensitivity of a standard 100 Ω sensor is a nominal 0.385 Ω/°C. RTDs with a sensitivity of 0.375 and 0.392 Ω/°C, as well as a variety of others, are also available.

==Function==
Resistance thermometers are constructed in a number of forms and offer greater stability, accuracy and repeatability in some cases than thermocouples. While thermocouples use the Seebeck effect to generate a voltage, resistance thermometers use electrical resistance and require a power source to operate. The resistance ideally varies nearly linearly with temperature per the Callendar–Van Dusen equation.

The platinum detecting wire needs to be kept free of contamination to remain stable. A platinum wire or film is supported on a former in such a way that it gets minimal differential expansion or other strains from its former, yet is reasonably resistant to vibration. RTD assemblies made from iron or copper are also used in some applications. Commercial platinum grades exhibit a temperature coefficient of resistance 0.00385/°C (0.385%/°C) (European Fundamental Interval). The sensor is usually made to have a resistance of 100 Ω at 0 °C. This is defined in BS EN 60751:1996 (taken from IEC 60751:1995). The American Fundamental Interval is 0.00392/°C, based on using a purer grade of platinum than the European standard. The American standard is from the Scientific Apparatus Manufacturers Association (SAMA), who are no longer in this standards field. As a result, the &quot;American standard&quot; is hardly the standard even in the US.

Lead-wire resistance can also be a factor; adopting three- and four-wire, instead of two-wire, connections can eliminate connection-lead resistance effects from measurements (see below); three-wire connection is sufficient for most purposes and is an almost universal industrial practice. Four-wire connections are used for the most precise applications.

==Advantages and limitations==
The advantages of platinum resistance thermometers include:
* High accuracy
* Low drift
* Wide operating range
* Suitability for precision applications.

Limitations:

RTDs in industrial applications are rarely used above 660 °C. At temperatures above 660 °C it becomes increasingly difficult to prevent the platinum from becoming contaminated by impurities from the metal sheath of the thermometer. This is why laboratory standard thermometers replace the metal sheath with a glass construction. At very low temperatures, say below −270 °C (3 K), because there are very few phonons, the resistance of an RTD is mainly determined by impurities and boundary scattering and thus basically independent of temperature. As a result, the sensitivity of the RTD is essentially zero and therefore not useful. 

Compared to thermistors, platinum RTDs are less sensitive to small temperature changes and have a slower response time. However, thermistors have a smaller temperature range and stability.

===RTDs vs thermocouples===
The two most common ways of measuring temperatures for industrial applications are with resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) and thermocouples. The choice between them is typically determined by four factors.
;Temperature: If process temperatures are between , an industrial RTD is the preferred option. Thermocouples have a range of , so for temperatures above it is the contact temperature measurement device commonly found in physics laboratories.
;Response time: If the process requires a very fast response to temperature changes (fractions of a second as opposed to seconds), then a thermocouple is the best choice. Time response is measured by immersing the sensor in water moving at with a 63.2% step change.
;Size: A standard RTD sheath is in diameter; sheath diameters for thermocouples can be less than .
;Accuracy and stability requirements: If a tolerance of 2 °C is acceptable and the highest level of repeatability is not required, a thermocouple will serve. RTDs are capable of higher accuracy and can maintain stability for many years, while thermocouples can drift within the first few hours of use.

==Construction==
These elements nearly always require insulated leads attached. PVC, silicone rubber or PTFE insulators are used at temperatures below about 250 °C. Above this, glass fibre or ceramic are used. The measuring point, and usually most of the leads, require a housing or protective sleeve, often made of a metal alloy that is chemically inert to the process being monitored. Selecting and designing protection sheaths can require more care than the actual sensor, as the sheath must withstand chemical or physical attack and provide convenient attachment points.

The RTD construction design may be enhanced to handle shock and vibration by including compacted magnesium oxide (MgO) powder inside the sheath. MgO is used to isolate the conductors from the external sheath and from each other. MgO is used due to its dielectric constant, rounded grain structure, high-temperature capability, and its chemical inertness.

==Wiring configurations==

===Two-wire configuration===
The simplest resistance-thermometer configuration uses two wires. It is only used when high accuracy is not required, as the resistance of the connecting wires is added to that of the sensor, leading to errors of measurement. This configuration allows use of 100 meters of cable. This applies equally to balanced bridge and fixed bridge system.

For a balanced bridge usual setting is with R2 = R1, and R3 around the middle of the range of the RTD. So for example, if we are going to measure between , RTD resistance will range from 100 Ω to 138.5 Ω. We would choose R3 = 120 Ω. In that way we get a small measured voltage in the bridge.

===Three-wire configuration===
In order to minimize the effects of the lead resistances, a three-wire configuration can be used. The suggested setting for the configuration shown, is with R1 = R2, and R3 around the middle of the range of the RTD. Looking at the Wheatstone bridge circuit shown, the voltage drop on the lower left hand side is V_rtd + V_lead, and on the lower righthand side is V_R3 + V_lead, therefore the bridge voltage (V_b) is the difference, V_rtd − V_R3. The voltage drop due to the lead resistance has been cancelled out. This always applies if R1=R2, and R1, R2 » RTD, R3. R1 and R2 can serve the use of limiting the current through the RTD, for example for a Pt100, limiting to 1 mA, and 5 V, would suggest a limiting resistance of approximately R1 = R2 = 5/0.001 = 5,000 Ohms.

===Four-wire configuration===
The four-wire resistance configuration increases the accuracy of measurement of resistance. Four-terminal sensing eliminates voltage drop in the measuring leads as a contribution to error. To increase accuracy further, any residual thermoelectric voltages generated by different wire types or screwed connections are eliminated by reversal of the direction of the 1 mA current and the leads to the DVM (digital voltmeter). The thermoelectric voltages will be produced in one direction only. By averaging the reversed measurements, the thermoelectric error voltages are cancelled out.

==Classifications of RTDs==
The highest-accuracy of all PRTs are the &quot;Ultra Precise Platinum Resistance Thermometers&quot; (UPRTs). This accuracy is achieved at the expense of durability and cost. The UPRT elements are wound from reference-grade platinum wire. Internal lead wires are usually made from platinum, while internal supports are made from quartz or fused silica. The sheaths are usually made from quartz or sometimes Inconel, depending on temperature range. Larger-diameter platinum wire is used, which drives up the cost and results in a lower resistance for the probe (typically 25.5 Ω). UPRTs have a wide temperature range (−200 °C to 1000 °C) and are approximately accurate to ±0.001 °C over the temperature range. UPRTs are only appropriate for laboratory use.

Another classification of laboratory PRTs is &quot;Standard Platinum Resistance Thermometers&quot; (Standard SPRTs). They are constructed like the UPRT, but the materials are more cost-effective. SPRTs commonly use reference-grade, high-purity smaller-diameter platinum wire, metal sheaths and ceramic type insulators. Internal lead wires are usually a nickel-based alloy. Standard PRTs are more limited in temperature range (−200 °C to 500 °C) and are approximately accurate to ±0.03 °C over the temperature range.

&quot;Industrial PRTs&quot; are designed to withstand industrial environments. They can be almost as durable as a thermocouple. Depending on the application, industrial PRTs can use thin-film or coil-wound elements. The internal lead wires can range from PTFE-insulated stranded nickel-plated copper to silver wire, depending on the sensor size and application. Sheath material is typically stainless steel; higher-temperature applications may demand Inconel. Other materials are used for specialized applications.

==History==
Contemporary to the Seebeck effect, the discovery that resistivity in metals is dependent on the temperature was announced in 1821 by Sir Humphry Davy.
The practical application of the tendency of electrical conductors to increase their electrical resistance with rising temperature was first described by Sir William Siemens at the Bakerian Lecture of 1871 before the Royal Society of Great Britain, suggesting platinum as a suitable element. The necessary methods of construction were established by Callendar, Griffiths, Holborn and Wein between 1885 and 1900.

In 1871 Carl Wilhelm Siemens invented the Platinum Resistance Temperature Detector and presented a three-term interpolation formula. Siemens’ RTD rapidly fell out of favour due to the instability of the temperature reading. Hugh Longbourne Callendar developed the first commercially successful platinum RTD in 1885.
A 1971 paper by Eriksson, Keuther, and Glatzel identified six noble metal alloys (63Pt37Rh, 37Pd63Rh, 26Pt74Ir, 10Pd90Ir, 34Pt66Au, 14Pd86Au) with approximately linear resistance temperature characteristics. The alloy 63Pt37Rh is similar to the readily available 70Pt30Rh alloy wire used in thermocouples.

The Space Shuttle made extensive use of platinum resistance thermometers. The only in-flight shutdown of a Space Shuttle Main Engine – mission STS-51F – was caused by multiple failures of RTDs which had become brittle and unreliable due to multiple heat-and-cool cycles. (The failures of the sensors falsely suggested that a fuel pump was critically overheating, and the engine was automatically shut down.) Following the engine failure incident, the RTDs were replaced with thermocouples.

==Standard resistance thermometer data==
Temperature sensors are usually supplied with thin-film elements. The resistance elements are rated in accordance with BS EN 60751:2008 as:

Resistance-thermometer elements functioning up to 1000 °C can be supplied. The relation between temperature and resistance is given by the Callendar–Van Dusen equation:
:formula_4
:formula_5
Here formula_6 is the resistance at temperature &quot;T&quot;, formula_2 is the resistance at 0 °C, and the constants (for an α = 0.00385 platinum RTD) are:
:formula_8
:formula_9
:formula_10
Since the &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; coefficients are relatively small, the resistance changes almost linearly with the temperature.

For positive temperature, solution of the quadratic equation yields the following relationship between temperature and resistance:
:formula_11

Then for a four-wire configuration with a 1 mA precision current source the relationship between temperature and measured voltage formula_12 is
:formula_13

<doc id="1281171" wikidata="Q3630997" url="?curid=1281171" title="Kalinjar Fort">
<text>Kalinjar is a fortress-city in Banda district of Uttar Pradesh, India. It was ruled by several dynasties, including the Guptas, the Vardhana dynasty, the Chandelas, Solankis of Rewa, Mughals and the Marathas.

The fortress has several temples dating back to the Gupta dynasty of the 3rd–5th centuries. It is strategically located on an isolated rocky hill at the end of the Vindhya Range, overlooking the plains of Bundelkhand.

==History==

=== Etymology ===
Kalinjar is a portmanteau of the Sanskrit words &quot;Kaala,&quot; meaning time, and &quot;jara,&quot; meaning destruction, translating to &quot;destroyer of time&quot;.

=== Mythology ===
Kalinjar finds its mention in ancient Hindu mythological texts. According to Hindu legends, it is said that after the Samudra manthan, when Shiva consumed poison that turned his throat blue, he came to Kalinjar and defeated the &quot;kaal&quot; i.e. achieved victory over death. This is the reason why Shiva temple at Kalinjar is called &quot;Neelkanth&quot; (blue-throated). Since then, the hill has been considered a holy site.

=== Early history ===
Kalinjar has also been mentioned in Buddhist literature, particularly in the travelogues of Buddha. The Chedi dynasty ruled here during the time of Gautama Buddha (563–480 BC). Following this, it was absorbed into the Maurya Empire and came to be known as Vindhya-Atavi.

The fort eventually came under the rule of the Shunga dynasty and the Pandu dynasty. In the Prayag Prasathi inscription of the Allahabad Pillar this region is mentioned by the name &quot;Vindhya Atavi&quot;. The Fort was in the control of the Gurjara Pratiharas, and remained until the rule of Nagabhatta II. Chandela rulers used to be their &quot;Mandalik&quot; kings. The mention of Kalinjar is found in almost every text or inscription of that time.

=== Medieval period ===
According to the 16th century Persian historian Firishta, the town of Kalinjar was established by one Kedar Raja in the 7th century. Rastrakutas later seized the fortress. The fort came to prominence during the Chandela rule. According to Chandela-era legends, the fort was built by a Chandela ruler. The Chandela rulers used the title &quot;Kalanjaradhipati&quot; (), which shows their importance to the fort.

In 1023, Mahmud of Ghazni attacked and received a tribute from Kalinjar, Mughal emperor Babur captured the fort in 1526, when his forces drove away Raja Hasan Khan Mewatpatti. It was also the place where Sher Shah Suri met his death in 1545, when he was mortally wounded by a gunpowder explosion from one of his own cannons, with his soldiers capturing the fort before his death. In 1569, Akbar captured the fort and it was under Mughal rule until its capture by the Marathas. Kalinjar played a prominent part in history down to the time of the Revolt of 1857, when it was held by a small British garrison. Both the fort and the town, which stands at the foot of the hill, are of interest to the antiquary on account of the remains of temples, sculptures, inscriptions, and caves.

In the early 18th century, the fort was captured by the Peshwa Bajirao after defeating the Mughal general Bangash Khan of Allahabad. In order to stop the Mughals from entering Bundelkhand again, he established a Maratha light infantry huzurat of 5000 under the command of Sardar Ram Singh Bhatt, Yashwantrao Bhatt, Parshuram Bhau Bundela, Bhaskar Pandit, and Sheshrao Pant Bundela, all veterans of war and Maratha class one generals. In due course of time, the Marathas conquered the nearby territories and expanded to the Bengal frontiers. They inflicted a crushing defeat on Awadh ally Nawab of Rampur and Ala Vardi Khan.
The fort was used to levy chauth to nearby territories like Benares, Mirzapur, Pratapgarh, Kunda, and Bundela.

=== Colonial period ===

In 1803, the Peshwa was involved in direct skirmishes with the East India Company in which he was defeated. In the Treaty of Surji-Anjangaon, Peshwa Bajirao II ceded Bundelkhand to the East India Company after his defeat in the Second Anglo-Maratha war. The fort came under the management of the East India Company in 1805-06. The Old Bhatt royalty was expatriated and was granted separate sanads of Kirwi, Attra, Chitrakut Mathond, and Khurand.

The fort was placed under the pre-Maratha constitution of Bundela - Jhijhotiya Chubes. However, during the first War of Independence in 1857, The Old Bhatta Aristocracy recaptured the fort driving Bundela back to Ajaygarh. In 1858, the British attacked the fort but the people at large resisted and fought a tough battle with Major Hugh Rose. A long drawn siege ensued in which almost 800 British and 3000 Indians were killed. This proved to be the toughest battlefield in Bundelkhand where English suffered maximum casualties. The English with the help of the states of Panna and Rewa captured this fort on 4 May 1858. The Last Bhatta Peshwas surrendered and were sent to Rewa as prisoners. Kalinjar subah was distributed in between Bundela, Rewa Solanki and Chaubes of Rajaula. The fort was decommissioned and its buildings were demolished, to prevent any further maratha garrisoning at Kalinjar, thus ending the legacy of this fort. The total chauth collection was estimated at 40 lakh shahi mohars. The Naukahai campaign of Rewa and Chunar Fort, was launched directly from Kalinjar in which the Sohagpur Amarkantak and Shahdol paragana were attached to Peshwa territories. Almost all the occupants of the fort were moon worshipers and are called Chandravanshi clans of Kshatriya, Brahmanas, Kalchuries and Yadavas.

In 1812, the British troops marched into Bundelkhand, and after a long battle, they were able to annex the fort. The British seizure of Kalinjar proved to be a great watershed, transferring the legacy of the old aristocracy into the hands of the new bureaucracy of officials, who showed their loyalty to British imperialism by damaging the captured fort. The damages caused to the fort can still be seen on its walls and open spaces.

== Transport links ==
===Air===
The nearest airport is at Khajuraho, away but has limited connectivity. Kanpur Airport which is well connected with metropolitan cities of India is and 4 hours drive from Kalinjar.

<text>Quiet as a Nun is a thriller novel, written by Antonia Fraser. First published in 1977, it features Fraser&#x27;s sleuthing heroine Jemima Shore as she revisits the convent school where she was educated following the mysterious death of one of the nuns. A six-part television dramatisation of the book (written by Julia Jones) was part of ITV&#x27;s anthology series &quot;Armchair Thriller&quot; in 1978.

==Plot summary==

The novel begins with the death of a nun, Sister Miriam, who apparently starved herself to death in a ruined tower, known as the &#x27;Tower of Ivory&#x27;, which adjoins the grounds of the Convent of the Blessed Eleanor, a nunnery and a girls&#x27; school.

The tower has specific significance to the Order, as it was the original convent building. The tower and the ancient history of the Order are recorded in the &quot;Treasury of the Blessed Eleanor&quot;, a manuscript that is referenced throughout the story. Though it is never stated explicitly, Blessed Eleanor is presumed to be Eleanor of Aquitaine, who was once Queen of England.

Television reporter Jemima Shore is a former schoolfriend of Sister Miriam, who was also known as Rosabelle Powerstock and was heiress to &quot;the Powers fortune&quot;, one of the largest fortunes in Britain. Jemima is invited back to the convent by Reverend Mother Ancilla, where she uncovers a number of mysteries, including the suggestion that Miriam, whose family owned the convent lands, may have written a second will bequeathing them away from the Order, and into the hands of another charity.

The tension builds when the girls at the convent school tell Jemima that the Black Nun, a malevolent faceless spectre reputed to appear whenever a death is about to take place within the grounds, was seen just prior to Sister Miriam&#x27;s death, and has been sighted again.

==Television adaptation==
&quot;Quiet as a Nun&quot; was adapted for television by ITV in 1978, as part of the &quot;Armchair Thriller&quot; series. The adaptation starred Maria Aitken as Jemima Shore, along with Renée Asherson (Mother Ancilla), Brenda Bruce (Sister Elizabeth) and Sylvia Coleridge (Sister Boniface). Patsy Kensit, then just nine years old, plays one of the convent schoolgirls, Tessa Justin, who has a significant role in the final two episodes.

In the final minutes of the third episode, aired on 18 April 1978, Jemima Shore goes alone into the Tower at night. As she climbs into the attic, she encounters the faceless Black Nun sitting in a rocking chair. Jemima screams as the Black Nun advances towards her, at which point the episode ends. The scene was ranked 63rd in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Scary Moments&quot; list.

<doc id="1281178" wikidata="Q697777" url="?curid=1281178" title="Schwalm (Meuse)">
<text>The Schwalm (German) or Swalm (Dutch), is a small river in Germany and the Netherlands, tributary to the river Meuse. Its source is near Wegberg, in the district Heinsberg, south-west of Mönchengladbach, in North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany). The Schwalm flows through Wegberg and Brüggen before flowing into the Meuse across the border with the Netherlands, in Swalmen. Its total length is 45 km.

== Sources ==
The original source region has since become an area of carr with poor water quality. The water of the Schwalm comes mainly from &quot;Rheinbraun&#x27;s&quot; waste water pits. This brown coal open cast mine is required to feed the waste water into the surface water. Otherwise it would fill the mine, which is up to 230 metres deep.This is achieved by means of shafts (&quot;Schlitzschächten&quot;) through which the water flows back into the groundwater. If it were not for these shafts, the rivers Niers and Schwalm would long since have dried up. This would also destroy the mixed alder and ash wet woodland typical of the region.

== Course ==

The source of the Schwalm is in a wetland area south of the German village of Wegberg-Tüschenbroich at an elevation of about . From there the river flows mainly through the Maas-Schwalm-Nette Nature Park, its riverbed running between the rivers Rur, Nette and Niers.

Of its total length from this source to its mouth on the Meuse, near the village of Swalmen at about , 13 kilometres of the river run through Dutch territory.

Parts of the river which, for example, run past the villages of Wegberg, Niederkrüchten, Schwalmtal, Brüggen-Born, Brüggen and Swalmen, form natural meanders.

The catchment area of the Schwalm is 268.7 square kilometres, of which around 27 square kilometres lie in the Netherlands.

== Tributaries ==

* Beeckbach
* Mühlenbach
* Knippertzbach
* Kranenbach
* Elmpter Bach

== Flora and fauna ==
The carr and heath/bog areas along the Schwalm provide a diverse habitat for fauna and flora. Frogs, dragonflies, damselflies, bluethroat, kingfisher and golden oriole are to be found as are water crowfoot, bog myrtle and other rare plants. brown trout, barbel and chub are at home in the river; along the river banks are also various members of the eter water rat family.

<text>The beguine ( ) is a dance and music form, similar to a slow rhumba. It was popular in the 1930s, coming from the islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, where, in the local Antillean Creole language, &quot;beke&quot; or &quot;begue&quot; means a White man while &quot;beguine&quot; is the female form. It is a combination of Latin folk dance and French ballroom dance, and is a spirited yet slow, close dance with a roll of the hips, a movement inherited from rhumba.

After Cole Porter wrote the song &quot;Begin the Beguine&quot;, the dance became more widely known beyond the Caribbean. The song was introduced in Porter&#x27;s &quot;Jubilee&quot; musical (1935).

In 1984, Italian pop music duo Al Bano and Romina Power released the song &quot;Al ritmo di beguine (Ti amo)&quot; from their album &quot;Effetto amore&quot;.

<text>Coppa Italia () is the annual domestic cup of Italian football. The knockout competition was organized by the DDS and the Lega Calcio until the 2009–10 season and by Lega Serie A ever since.

Juventus is the competition&#x27;s most successful club with fifteen wins, followed by Roma and Inter Milan with nine. Juventus has contested the most finals with 22, followed by Roma with 17 finals. The holder can wear a cockade of Italy (Italian: &quot;coccarda&quot;), akin to the roundels that appear on military aircraft. The winner automatically qualifies for both the UEFA Europa League league phase and the Supercoppa Italiana the following year.

==History==
The beginning of the tournament was turbulent, due to the complexity of the participation of the teams in the tournament, since its inception in 1921, the Italian championship was divided into two groups. On the one hand the rich CCI Championship (Italian Football Confederation) and on the other the poor FIGC championship (Italian Football Federation). Losing all its most prestigious clubs, the FIGC tried to enhance its rump season with a new cup. The tournament&#x27;s first edition held in 1922 was won by F.C. Vado. The following agreement between the contenders did not contemplate a cup that, outside a failed 1926–27 tournament which was cancelled during the round of 32, was not held until 1935–36. The events of World War II interrupted the tournament after the 1942–43 season, and it did not resume again until 1958. Since then, it has been played annually or seasonally.

The eight seasons during the fascist period were contested copying the FA Cup format. There was a different trophy, and the winners were awarded the tricolour scudetto while the championship winners obtained a Savoyard scudetto instead. The present-day cup and cockade were introduced in 1958.

==Format==
The competition is a knockout tournament with pairings for each round made in advance; the draw for the whole competition is made before a ball is kicked. Each tie is played as a single leg, except a two-legged semi-final stage. If a match is drawn, extra time is played. In the event of a draw after 120 minutes, a penalty shoot-out is contested. As well as being presented with the trophy, the winning team also qualifies for the UEFA Europa League (formerly the UEFA Cup). If the winners have already qualified for the UEFA Champions League via the Serie A, or are not entitled to play in UEFA competitions for any reason, the place goes to the next highest placed team in the league table.

There are a total of seven rounds in the competition. The competition begins in August with the preliminary round and is contested only by the eight lowest-ranked clubs. Clubs playing in Serie B join in during the first round with the 12 lowest-ranked teams in Serie A based on the previous league season&#x27;s positions (unless they are to compete in European competition that year) begin the competition in the first round before August is over. The remaining eight Serie A teams join the competition in the third round in January, at which point 16 teams remain. The round of 16, the quarter-finals and the first leg of the semi-finals are then played in quick succession after the fourth round and the second leg of the semi-finals is played a couple of months later – in April – before the final in May. The two-legged final was eliminated for the 2007–08 edition and a single-match final is now played at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.

;Notes
* The 1922 tournament was contested only by smaller clubs who remained associated with FIGC, following the formation of a breakaway league by the larger teams who participated the 1921–22 Prima Divisione.
* Although 77 tournaments have been contested, only 76 cups have been assigned. The 1926–27 edition was abandoned in the round of 32.

===Finals===

<text>Highland English (, ) is the variety of Scottish English spoken by many in Gaelic-speaking areas and the Hebrides. It is more strongly influenced by Gaelic than are other forms of Scottish English.

==Phonology==

*The &quot;Epenthesis&quot; (&quot;helping vowel&quot;) that is used in some consonant combinations in Gaelic and Scots is sometimes used in the Hebrides, so that &quot;film&quot; may be pronounced &quot;fillum&quot;.

==Vocabulary==

* Up south and down north, as opposed to the usual English &quot;up north&quot; and &quot;down south&quot;, are used in parts of the Highlands and Islands, most notably in Uist. It is likely derived from Gaelic usage, attested in the Wester Ross dialect.

<text>Heinrich Rudolf Hildebrand (13 March 1824 – 28 October 1894) was a Germanist, contributor to, and then, editor of the Grimm brothers&#x27; &quot;Deutsches Wörterbuch&quot;. He also wrote on the history of German folksongs, and on the teaching of the German language in schools.

== Biography ==
Rudolf Hildebrand was born in Leipzig to typesetter Heinrich Hildebrand and Amalia, born Porges. He attended the Thomasschule in Leipzig from 1836 to 1843. He went on to study at Leipzig University, where he first studied theology as his father wished him to, but soon switched to classical and German philology. Among his teachers were Moritz Haupt. He wrote his main thesis about Walther von der Vogelweide, which was later published in 1900.

In 1848, he worked for a time as reviewer and translator of the &quot;Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; and was considering a career as a publisher. However, the same year, he started working as a teacher at the Thomasschule from 1848 and remained there to 1868.

He became professor of newer German language and literature at the University of Leipzig in 1869 (&quot;außerordentlicher Professor&quot; from 1869, &quot;ordentlicher Professor&quot; from 1874).

<doc id="1281217" wikidata="Q2893347" url="?curid=1281217" title="MuggleNet">
<text>MuggleNet is the Internet&#x27;s oldest and largest &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and Wizarding World fansite. MuggleNet was founded in 1999. It has expanded over the years to include a handful of partner podcasts, a separate book blog, over half a dozen published works and live events. At one point, it also ran its own forums, social network and separate fan fiction website. Originally owned by founder Emerson Spartz, MuggleNet became an independently-owned and operated brand in early 2020.

==Relationship with the franchise==
MuggleNet once benefitted from friendly relations with J.K. Rowling, the author of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books, and the producers of the films. She has praised MuggleNet on her website and awarded it her Fan Site Award. Rowling has recounted on her website that she visited the site and sometimes read comments left by visitors, although she never commented herself. The author stated in a 2004 post on her website that she visited the site&#x27;s chat room and was snubbed when she anonymously joined a conversation about &quot;Harry Potter&quot; theories.

In July 2005, Rowling invited Spartz and Melissa Anelli, of the Leaky Cauldron, to Edinburgh, Scotland, for an interview at her home on the release of &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;. J.K. Rowling mentioned MuggleNet through the interactive &quot;Harry Potter&quot; website Pottermore in September 2013, saying how proud she was to own the key to La Porte, Indiana, hometown of MuggleNet founder Emerson Spartz.

Warner Bros., the producers of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; movies, regularly sent MuggleNet stills taken from the upcoming movies before they were released. The studio also provided MuggleNet staff with advance views of the new official website designs, as well as included staff in a video conference to discuss the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; theme park at Universal Orlando Resort. Universal has extended invitations to MuggleNet to attend the opening of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios Hollywood in addition to the opening of Diagon Alley and Hagrid’s Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure at Universal Orlando Resort.

In July 2020, MuggleNet, together with the Leaky Cauldron, took several steps to distance themselves from Rowling due to comments she made the previous month that they perceived as transphobic. In a joint statement, the sites wrote that her views were &quot;out of step with the message of acceptance and empowerment we find in her books and celebrated by the Harry Potter community&quot;. They announced that they would no longer use photos of the author, link to her website, or write about achievements unrelated to the Potterverse. In January 2021, MuggleNet promised to no longer provide news coverage of J.K. Rowling&#x27;s works set outside of the wizarding world. The next month, that policy was updated to state that MuggleNet would no longer provide editorial coverage of J.K. Rowling&#x27;s works set outside of the wizarding world &quot;unless related to works set within the wizarding world.&quot;

==Podcasts==

=== &quot;MuggleCast&quot; ===

MuggleCast launched in August 2005 when podcasts were still up and coming. Inspired by the passion within the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; community, MuggleNet staff members Andrew Sims, Ben Schoen, and Kevin Steck created a short podcast to discuss some of the recent &quot;Harry Potter&quot; news and the just-released &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;. Following Sims&#x27;s departure from the site in summer 2011, &quot;MuggleCast&quot; separated from MuggleNet to become an independent podcast. The hosts now discuss the &quot;Fantastic Beasts&quot; films, the Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme parks, and fandom news, along with continued discussion of the original &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series.

&quot;MuggleCast&quot; recorded what it announced would be its final regular episode on August 26, 2013. However, on December 27, 2014, it was announced that they would be returning to regular episodes. &quot;MuggleCast&quot; began posting weekly podcasts again in April 2017. It is currently hosted by Andrew Sims, Eric Scull, Micah Tannenbaum, and Laura Tee. In September 2019, &quot;MuggleCast&quot; was featured in an article in &quot;The Oprah Magazine&quot;: &quot;26 of the Best Book Podcasts to Listen to When You&#x27;re Not Reading&quot;.

==Published works==
In 2006, in advance of the arrival of &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, five MuggleNet staff members (Andy Gordon, Jamie Lawrence, Ben Schoen, Emerson Spartz, and Gretchen Stull) coauthored the reference book &quot;What Will Happen in Harry Potter 7: Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Falls in Love, and How Will the Adventure Finally End&quot;, which was a published collection of unofficial fan predictions. By July 21, 2007, the book had sold 335,000 copies and reached #2 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Children&#x27;s Best Seller list, where it spent six months. In 2009, Emerson Spartz and Ben Schoen penned another book, MuggleNet.com&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter Should Have Died: Controversial Views from the #1 Fan Site&quot;.
==In popular culture==

In 2010, MuggleNet, along with several groups in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; fandom, created a four-hour event called Helping Haiti Heal, with all proceeds going to Partners in Health to help provide health care to areas without reliable medical care following the disastrous earthquake that hit the country that year.

In October 2007, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; did a parody of Emerson Spartz&#x27;s recent interview on the &quot;Geraldo&quot; segment of Fox News. Both the original interview and the parody discussed J. K. Rowling&#x27;s recent outing of Headmaster of Hogwarts Albus Dumbledore.

<text>The Geul (, ; ; ) is a river in Belgium and in the Netherlands, where it is a right-bank tributary to the river Meuse. 

== Geography ==
The source of the Geul is at about above sea level in northeastern Belgium near the German border, south of the German town of Aachen. From there, after flowing some in a northwestern direction, it leaves Belgium and enters the Netherlands at Cottessen in the Vaals municipality. After a further in a west-northwestern direction through the southernmost part of Limburg, which in its turn is the most southern province of the Netherlands, it flows into the Meuse, north of the city of Maastricht.

A tributary of the Geul is the Gulp.

Places through which the Geul passes are among others Kelmis (Belgium), Valkenburg aan de Geul, including Schin op Geul, and Meerssen (Netherlands).

==Pollution==
The water of the Geul is polluted seriously with heavy metals zinc and lead and as a result also is a serious source of heavy metal inflow into the Meuse.

This pollution is a result of former zinc and lead mining activities near the Belgian towns of Kelmis (La Calamine) and Plombières (formerly named Bleiberg).

The last one of these mines have closed early in the 20th century. One of the reasons for giving up mining activities in Plombières was the occasional flooding of the mine by the Geul, as the bedrock (mainly Carboniferous limestone) contains many faults and fissures.

Although mine factory buildings have been demolished, old railway dikes still are abundantly present in the area. They provide ideal hiking routes, that are known for the presence of so-called &quot;zinc flora&quot; (zinc-tolerant plants, such as yellow calamine violet and &quot;Viola calaminaria&quot;).

== Significant events ==
During the 2021 European floods, the banks of the river flooded, including in some of the major population centers such as Valkenburg aan de Geul.

<text>The Fluid Science Laboratory is a European (ESA&#x27;s) science payload designed for use in Columbus built by Alenia Spazio, OHB-System and Verhaert Design and Development. It is a multi-user facility for conducting fluid physics research in microgravity conditions. It can be operated in fully or in semi-automatic mode and can be controlled on board by the ISS astronauts, or from the ground in the so-called telescience mode.

The major objective of performing fluid science experiments in space is to study dynamic phenomena in the absence of gravitational forces. Under microgravity such forces are almost entirely eliminated thereby significantly reducing gravity-driven convection, sedimentation and stratification and fluid static pressure, allowing the study of fluid dynamic effects normally masked by gravity. These effects include diffusion-controlled heat and mass transfer.

The absence of gravity-driven convection eliminates the negative effects of density gradients (inhomogeneous mass distribution) that arise in processes involving heat treatment, phase transitions, diffusive transport or chemical reaction. Convection in terrestrial processes is a strong perturbing factor, the effects of which are seldom predictable with great accuracy and which dominate heat and mass transfer in fluids.

The ability to accurately control such processes remains limited, and their full understanding requires further fundamental research by conducting well-defined model experiments for developing and testing related theories under microgravity. This should facilitate the optimisation of manufacturing processes here on Earth and improve the quality of high value products, such as semiconductors.

The Fluid Science Laboratory fully occupies one International Standard Payload Rack. The Facility Core Element consists of the Optical Diagnostics Module and Central Experiment Module into which the experiment containers are sequentially inserted and operated.
The Optical Diagnostics Module houses the equipment for visual and interferometric observation, their related control electronics and the attachment points and interfaces for Front Mounted Cameras. The Central Experiment Module is divided into two parts:
* The first part contains the suspension structure for the Experiment Containers, including all the functional interfaces and optical equipment, and is designed to be pulled out from the rack to allow insertion and removal of the Experiment Container.
* The second part contains all the diagnostic and illumination equipment and its control electronics to command and monitor the electromechanical and opto-mechanical components. The Facility Core Element is complemented by the functional sub-systems for power distribution, environmental conditioning and data processing and management.

Experiments must be integrated in an FSL Experiment Container (FSL EC). With a typical mass of , a maximum mass of , and standard dimensions of 400x270x280 mm (15.7x10.6x11.0 in), the EC provides ample space to accommodate the fluid cell assembly, including any necessary process stimuli and dedicated electronics.

For observation of experiments the Fluid Science Laboratory includes:
* Two-axis visual observation with electronic imaging and photographic back-up via Front Mounted Cameras which provide high speed imaging together with high resolution and colour recording;
* Background, sheet and volume illumination with white light and monochromatic (laser) light sources;
* Particle image velocimetry, including liquid crystal tracers for simultaneous velocimetry and thermometry;
* Thermographic (infrared) mapping of free liquid surfaces;
* Interferometric observation in two axes by convertible interferometers with active alignment:
** Holographic interferometer;
** Wollaston - shearing interferometer;
** Schlieren mode combined with shearing mode;
** Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometer.

Flight Support Equipment such as spare parts, special tools and consumables (e.g. cleaning agents), Front Mounted Cameras and Optical Reference Targets for experiment and diagnostic calibration will also be available on board to support customer experiments.

A number of upgrades, partly resulting from new technological developments, have been implemented recently into the Fluid Science Laboratory. Most notable among these are a new Video Management Unit (VMU) and the Microgravity Vibration Isolation Subsystem (MVIS) developed by the Canadian Space Agency. Scientists may choose to activate MVIS to isolate (via magnetic levitation) the experiment and optical diagnostics from space station g-jitter perturbations. The VMU has already provided remarkable good scientific data during the recent CompGran Mission, installed by Alexander Gerst in June 2018. The MVIS system will first be exploited with the upcoming Reference Multiscale Boiling Mission starting in August 2019.

FSL is operated according to ESA&#x27;s decentralised payload operation concept. The Facility Responsible Centre (FRC) for FSL was MARS, located in Naples, Italy and now is BUSOC Belgian User Support and Operations Centre, located in Brussels, Belgium.

<text>Nasenbluten were an Australian electronic music group, formed in Newcastle in 1992. The group was made up of Aaron Lubinski, David Melo, and Mark Newlands, and released six studio albums before disbanding in 2001. They have been described as a significant influence on the breakcore genre.

==History==
The group was formed in Newcastle in 1992 by Aaron Lubinski (a.k.a. Xylocaine), David Melo (a.k.a. Disassembler), and Mark Newlands (a.k.a. Mark N, Overcast). They took their name from the German word &quot;Nasenbluten&quot;, meaning nosebleed, in reference to the phrase &quot;nosebleed techno&quot;, used to describe the harder and faster variants of the techno genre. Early in 1993, Lubinski founded the Dead Girl Records label (initially typeset as dEAdGirL) in Swansea.

The group began playing house parties in Newcastle and creating music on Amiga personal computers using tracker software in the MOD format. They self-released a number of cassettes on the Dead Girl label starting with their debut album, &quot;Transient Ischemic Attack&quot; appeared in 15 March 1993. On 31 July that year they recorded a live performance, which was released as &quot;Live at Wobble&quot;. In late October they recorded another album, &quot;You&#x27;re Going to Die&quot;. In mid-1994 following their Dead Girl cassettes they signed to New York City-based hardcore techno label Industrial Strength Records. In August that year, Newlands founded Bloody Fist Records for local releases. In early 1995, a Bloody Fist Sampler record was released on Industrial Strength including two Nasenbluten tracks, which that were licensed from the 500/600/1200 EP that was released on Bloody Fist Records earlier in late 1994.

Nasenbluten inspired local musicians, leading to a thriving hardcore techno scene in Newcastle. In 2005, Luke Collison (a.k.a. Dsico) acknowledged that his major influences were &quot;probably Nasenbluten and the Newcastle Hardcore scene. I grew up around there ... the radio show that Mark N used to do on 2NUR. Amiga 500 Hardcore was probably what got me into electronic music and especially making it&quot;. United Kingdom DJ, Loftgroover declared &quot;there&#x27;s too much niceness in the rave scene ... Gabba is how I really feel – hard, angry&quot;. He described &quot;Nasenbluten-style extreme noise terror: &#x27;punkcore&#x27;, &#x27;scarecore&#x27; and &#x27;doomtrooper&#x27;&quot;.

The band&#x27;s emphasis on breakbeats, ironic audio samples and gangster rap samples became influential in the hardcore scene, most prominently with Australian artists signed to Bloody Fist. Due to their influence and the relatively small numbers of records that were pressed for earlier releases (including limited self-distributed cassettes), they have become popular with collectors. Bloody Fist Records provided &quot;horrifically high-tempo electronic music that quickly became a thing of international legend. Specialising in breakcore, gabba and referential sample alchemy/exploitation&quot;, comments Shaun Prescott of Mess+Noise, going on to describe the band&#x27;s 1995 double LP &quot;100% No Soul Guaranteed&quot; as a &quot;nasty marriage of power electronics shock tactics with vaguely danceable and purely psychotic electronic beats&quot; making &quot;one of the few genuinely sickening music experiences you&#x27;re likely to have in your life&quot;.

In 1996, Nasenbluten released a limited edition single, &quot;Show Us Yor Tits&quot; (often referred to as &quot;Anna Wood&quot; or &quot;Fuck Anna Wood&quot;, from its sampled lyrics), on the Dead Girl label. In October of the previous year Sydney schoolgirl Anna Wood died after using ecstasy at a dance club; she was given copious amounts of water upon her collapse and later lapsed into a coma. Media reports sparked a moral panic surrounding rave parties and drug use at venues. This brought about a hard-line approach from governments to rave and dance parties in Australia. Jack Marx of &quot;The Age&quot; described how Wood&#x27;s friends may have been influenced by the prevailing zero tolerance attitude and hence they were too afraid to take her directly to hospital.

&quot;Show Us Yor Tits&quot; was not commercially available, only distributed by the band at gigs. They made 50 vinyl copies, each individually numbered. The label had a picture of Wood with the phrase &quot;I&#x27;m having the best night of my life!&quot; and a picture of Dutch DJ Paul Elstak on the B-side with the words &quot;I wanna see the rainbow high in the sky&quot;, a reference to the happy hardcore scene, its links to ecstasy, and to the song &quot;Rainbow in the Sky&quot; by Elstak. Cat Hope described &quot;Fuck Anna Wood&quot; as featuring &quot;controversial, sampled snippets from current affairs programs composed to form conversations, laid over with a gabba-style hard beat&quot;. &quot;Show Us Yor Tits&quot; appeared on Nasenbluten&#x27;s next album for Bloody Fist, &quot;N of Terror&quot;, a double cassette which had been recorded in April 1996.

Nasenbluten continued to issue material and toured Europe from November 1996 to February 1997 on their Christ This Is Dragging on a Bit tour. While in Germany they recorded an EP, &quot;Cheapcore&quot;, for the local Strike Records label, which was issued in 1997. The group played their last gig on 30 September 2001, and issued a triple LP, &quot;Dog Control&quot;, in November before disbanding.

===Side and later projects===
Aaron Lubinski made several releases on the Dead Girl and Bloody Fist imprints as Xylocaine. David Melo created several tracks as Disassembler, including one record on the Bloody Fist label that was mis-pressed and was not commercially available. Mark Newlands recorded under the alias Overcast, also on the Bloody Fist. The Overcast album &quot;3PM Eternal&quot; was the last double 12&quot; album release from the label. The &quot;1994-2004&quot; 12&quot; split album by Aftermath / Epsilon is the final vinyl release by Bloody Fist before it shutdown.

<text>Göhl is a municipality in the district of Ostholstein, in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.

== Geography ==
Göhl lies around three kilometers east of Oldenburg in Holstein on the Wagrian peninsular. The municipality is part of the collective municipality of Oldenburg-Land and the district of Ostholstein.

The southern border of Göhl runs along the Oldenburger Graben through the marshy lands of the former Gruber sea. Göhl borders the municipalities of Heringsdorf to the northeast, Gremersdorf to the northwest, Oldenburg in Holstein to the west, and across the Oldenburger Graben, Riepsdorf to the south.

Göhl is connected to Oldenburg in Holstein, the nearest city, via the road &quot;Göhler Chaussee&quot;, which allows connectivity of the municipality to the &quot;Bundesautobahn 1&quot;. The Lübeck–Puttgarden railway runs through the municipality but does not stop for passenger transport. However, a small decommissioned train station still exists in Göhl.

The municipality consists of the settlements Antoinettenhof, Christianstal, Gaarz, Gaarzerfelde, Gaarzermühle, Göhl, Giebelberg, Kremsdorf, Lütjendorf, Neuschwelbek, Plügge, Quals, and Schwelbek.

== History ==
The Oldenburger Graben, which now forms the southern border of Göhl, used to be part of a fjord before and during the times of Slavic settlement in the area, its connection to the Baltic Sea would later be severed through natural processes however, leaving behind several marshy inland seas, the biggest of which being the Gruber sea directly south of what is today the municipality of Göhl. Due to the marshy waters of the inland seas no longer being traversable and lacking any sea access, local farmers considered the draining of the seas to avoid future flood damage and expand their farmland in the early 20th century. The first pumps to drain the seas were commissioned in 1926, and state support was attained through first Weimar, and later Nazi agricultural policy.

Göhl was first mentioned under the name Gola, a Slavic word meaning heather, in 1317.

The areas which today make up Göhl have been part of the &quot;Gut Schwelbek zu Putlos&quot; since the start of the 15th century. During this time, Göhl was known by multiple names, including Ghoele and Ghole. On the 15th November 1910, at the time &quot;Gutsbezirk Schwelbek&quot;, which encompassed the village of Göhl, was transformed into the municipality of Goel. This new municipality grew with the addition of first the &quot;Gutsbezirk Kremsdorf&quot; in 1928, and then the municipality of Plügge in 1939. The spelling of Goel was standardized to the modern version of Göhl in 1937.

The &quot;Kreis Oldenburger Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft&quot; (KOE) rail company commissioned the Oldenburg - Heiligenhafen railway line, which ran trains through the Göhl station, in 1898. During 1976 however, all passenger transport was ceased, which left the train station decommissioned to this day.

A commercial area of 2.5 ha was created in the north of the settlement of Göhl in 1995.

The current coat of arms and flag were adopted in June 2010.

== Demographics ==
As of December 31, 2021, Göhl has a population of 1,118 with 560 (50.1%) being male, and 558 (49.9%) being female. The median age was 45.4 as of 2021.

Göhl had the highest percentage of under 18 years olds in Ostholstein at 24% (293) as of 2003. This population has since shrunken to 17.3% (193) in 2021 however.

=== Citizenship ===
In the 2022 census, 1,071 people (97.6%) in Göhl possessed only German citizenship, 1,046 of which (95.4% of the population) were born in Germany. Residents of other citizenship in the 2022 census were: 11 (1%) Polish, 5 (0.5%) Ukrainian, 4 (0.4%) Syrian, and 6 (0.5%) of other unspecified nationality.
=== Religion ===
In the 2022 census, 613 people (55.9%) were members of the Evangelical Church in Germany, with 58 (5.3%) belonging to the Catholic church, and 425 (38.8%) being either irreligious or belonging to another confession.

The only church in the municipality is the evangelical-lutheran Marco chapel (&quot;Marco-Kapelle&quot;) opposite of the kindergarten in the settlement of Göhl.

== Politics ==
The current mayor of Göhl is Thomas Bauer (BGG), who had been the deputy mayor from 1998 to 2006, he has since continuously been reelected as the mayor of Göhl.

=== Elections ===
The most recent election in Göhl were the 2023 Schleswig-Holstein municipal elections, where the BGG was reelected as the strongest faction despite losing one seat. The SPD last participated in the 2013 election.

=== Coat of Arms and Flag ===

The coat of arms and flag of Göhl were created by Henning Höppner, who had created multiple insignia in Wagria. It was registered with the state of Schleswig-Holstein in 2010. The heather plant in the center is in reference to the origin of the municipality&#x27;s name, stemming from the Slavic word &quot;Gola&quot; (&quot;heather&quot;). The bottom sections of the shield represent the green land, and the Oldenburger Graben which forms the southern border of the municipality.Blazon: &quot;Shield Or a heather plant Vert with three branches and 22 blossoms Gules, in base two bars of Vert and Azure parted by a barrulet Argent, all three countersunk in centre.&quot;The flag of Göhl is a heraldic flag, and shares the same design as the coat of arms.

== Culture and associations ==
The local sports association, SV Göhl, was founded in 1970 and has around 500 members.

The German Red Cross in Göhl acts as not only a medical service focusing on senior care, but also a cultural association; organizing, among other things, flea markets, game nights, and trips.

In the southernmost settlement of Göhl, Gut Gaarz, is a historic estate under family ownership that was built in 1690 and currently acts as a family resort as well as farm.

== Education ==

Göhl is home to a elementary school called &quot;Grundschule Göhl&quot; and a kindergarten.

<doc id="1281230" wikidata="Q1756992" url="?curid=1281230" title="NAVTEX">
<text>NAVTEX (NAVigational TEleX), sometimes styled Navtex or NavTex, is an international automated medium frequency direct-printing service for delivery of navigational and meteorological warnings and forecasts, as well as urgent maritime safety information (MSI) to ships.

NAVTEX was developed in the late 1970s in northwestern Europe to provide a low-cost, simple, and automated means of receiving this information aboard ships at sea within approximately off-shore.

There are no user fees associated with receiving NAVTEX broadcasts, as the transmissions are typically transmitted from the National Weather Authority (Italy) or Navy or Coast Guard (as in the US) or national navigation authority (Canada).

Where the messages contain weather forecasts, an abbreviated format very similar to the shipping forecast is used.

NAVTEX is a component of the International Maritime Organization/International Hydrographic Organization Worldwide Navigation Warning Service (WWNWS). NAVTEX is also a major element of the Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS). SOLAS Convention mandated certain classes of vessels must carry NAVTEX, beginning August 1, 1993.

==Technical information==

NAVTEX transmissions are also called narrow-band direct printing (NBDP). The transmissions are layered on top of SITOR collective B-mode. SITOR-B is a forward error correcting (FEC) broadcast that uses the CCIR 476 character set. NAVTEX messages are transmitted at 100 baud using FSK modulation with a frequency shift of 170 Hz.

NAVTEX broadcasts are primarily made on the medium frequency band at 490 kHz and 518 kHz, the latter being the international NAVTEX frequency. Transmissions here should always be in English. National transmission of NAVTEX, where supported, uses 490 kHz specifically for broadcasts in local languages.

NAVTEX Marine Safety Information (MSI) national transmissions also take place on HF at 4209.5 kHz using FEC mode.

==NAVTEX message format==

NAVTEX messages are transmitted using binary frequency-shift keying (BFSK) at 100 bit/s and a 170 Hz frequency shift. The characters are encoded using the 7-bit CCIR 476 character set which allows for basic error detection. Forward error correction (FEC) is achieved by repeating each character after a 3 character delay, i.e. ...ABCDE... becomes ...A.B.CADBEC.D.E... This is the same format as the SITOR-B format.

A NAVTEX message is built on SITOR collective B-mode and consists of:

* a phasing signal of at least ten seconds
* the four characters &quot;ZCZC&quot; that identify the end of phasing
* a single space
* four characters &quot;B1, B2, B3 and B4&quot; (see below)
* a carriage return and a line feed
* the information
* the four characters &quot;NNNN&quot; to identify the end of information
* a carriage return and two line feeds
* either
:* 5 or more seconds of phasing signal and another message starting with &quot;ZCZC&quot; &quot;or&quot;
:* an end of emission idle signal α for at least 2 seconds.

B1 is an alpha character identifying the station, and B2 is an alpha character used to identify the subject of the message. Receivers use these characters to reject messages from certain stations or if the message contains subjects of no interest to the user.

B3 and B4 are two-digit numerics identifying individual messages, used by receivers to keep already received messages from being repeated.

For example, a message containing &quot;B1B2B3B4&quot; characters of &#x27;FE01&#x27; from a U.S. NAVTEX station indicates a weather forecast message from Boston, MA.

NAVTEX message example:
===Start of message===
ZCZC begins the messages.

===Transmitter identity (B1)===
This character defines the transmitter identity and its associated coverage area.

===Subject indicator character (B2)===
The subject indicator character is used by the receiver to identify different classes of messages below. The indicator is also used to reject messages concerning certain optional subjects which are not required by the ship (e.g. LORAN C messages might be rejected in a ship which is not fitted with a LORAN C receiver).

NAVTEX broadcasts use following subject indicator characters:

Note: Receivers use the B2 character to identify messages which, because of their importance, can not be rejected (designated by a 1).
The subject indicator characters B, F and G are normally not used in the United States since the National Weather Service normally includes meteorological warnings in forecast messages. Meteorological warnings are broadcast using the subject indicator character E.
U.S. Coast Guard District Broadcast Notices to Mariners affecting ships outside the line of demarcation, and inside the line of demarcation in areas where deep draft vessels operate, use the subject indicator character A.

===Serial number of message (B3, B4)===
These two characters define the serial number of each B2 message type (class). Generally serial numbers start with the numbers &#x27;01&#x27;, however in special circumstances, the numbers begin with &#x27;00&#x27;. This forces the receiver to print the message.

===Time of origin===
Time of origin is in the format of &quot;DDHHmm UTC MMM YY&quot; where DD is the date, HH hour, mm minute and MMM three-character abbreviation of month and YY year. The time of the transmission of the message is in UTC.

===Message text===
The full text of the message follows.

===End of message===
The end of the message is asserted when the characters &quot;NNNN&quot; are received.

==NAVTEX transmission schedule==

Each station identifier has a fixed 10-minute time slot, starting with A at 0000 UTC. The time slots are repeated at 4 hour intervals. Within each time slot, a mix of navigation warnings, weather forecasts, ice information and other content may be sent, and this is normally according to a structured plan for that specific station. For example, in the first and third time slot they may decide to transmit navigation warnings, and weather forecasts in the others. Normally each NAVAREA or sub-NAVAREA has only one station at each slot.

Details of all transmitting stations and their schedules may be found at 

==NAVTEX receivers==

NAVTEX receivers which are approved for GMDSS contain an internal printer and/or a scrollable display, and cost between $800–$1500. A new generation of NAVTEX receivers intended for non-GMDSS applications such as the recreational community is entering the marketplace. These receivers include features such as LCD screens and RS-232 output and have a purchase price in the $300–$500 range. In the UK they can be purchased for £115. There are also a number of NAVTEX engines available that do not have any user interface, and just output decoded data in RS-232 format, either as a simple ASCII data stream, or using the NMEA NAVTEX sentences, or their own proprietary protocol.

There are also a number of software packages available (SeaTTY, Mscan, JNX, Fldigi or JVComm32 are examples) that allow messages NAVTEX to be decoded by on a personal computer connected to a receiver that covers the medium frequency range. The computer uses its sound device as a modem.

== Proposed termination of U.S. NAVTEX ==
In September 2019, the U.S. Coast Guard proposed shutting down its MF NAVTEX services and relying on satellite communications.

<text>Ștefan Golescu (1809–1874) was a Wallachian Romanian politician who served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs for two terms from 1 March 1867 to 5 August 1867 and from 13 November 1867 to 30 April 1868, and as Prime Minister of Romania between 26 November 1867 and 12 May 1868.

==Biography==
Golescu was the son of writer, educationist and pioneer Romanian nationalist, Dinicu Golescu. Born in Câmpulung into a boyar family of the Golești, he studied with his brothers (Nicolae and ) in Switzerland. After he returned, he joined the Wallachian Army and became a major in 1836. With his brother he also joined the Philharmonic Society, a society similar to the Freemasonry.

Ștefan Golescu was involved in the triggering of the 1848 Wallachian revolution, participating in the Islaz gathering of 9 June 1848, when he became a member of the Provisional Government, serving as Minister of Justice.

During the writing of the new constitution, he supported Nicolae Bălcescu&#x27;s idea of universal suffrage, while his brother, Nicolae, favoured less expansive participation. Ștefan Golescu was part of the delegation sent by the revolutionaries to Istanbul to negotiate the new constitution with the Ottoman Empire, Wallachia&#x27;s overlord.

Golescu was a member of the Wallachian assembly that elected Alexandru Ioan Cuza as prince of both Wallachia and Moldavia (1859). Afterwards, he was a member of the Liberal Party of Ion C. Brătianu and served for about half a year as Prime Minister of Romania in a Liberal government.

<doc id="1281240" wikidata="Q7099791" url="?curid=1281240" title="Orangeburg Massacre">
<text>The Orangeburg Massacre was a shooting of student protesters on February 8, 1968, on the campus of South Carolina State College in Orangeburg, South Carolina, United States. Nine highway patrolmen and one city police officer opened fire on a crowd of African American students, killing three and injuring twenty-eight. The shootings were the culmination of a series of protests against racial segregation at a local bowling alley, marking the first instance of police killing student protestors at an American university.

Two days before the shootings, student activists had been arrested for a sit-in at the segregated All-Star Bowling Lane. When a crowd of several hundred Claflin College and South Carolina State College (State College) students gathered outside the bowling alley to protest the arrests, police dispersed the crowd with billy clubs. Students requested permission to hold a march downtown and submitted a list of demands to city officials. The request for a march was denied, but city officials agreed to review the demands. As tensions in Orangeburg mounted over the next few days, Governor Robert McNair ordered hundreds of National Guardsmen and highway patrol officers to the city to keep the peace.

On the night of February 8, students from both colleges and Wilkinson High School started a bonfire at the front of the State College campus. When police moved to put out the fire, students threw debris at them, including a piece of a wooden banister that injured an officer. Several minutes later, at least nine patrolmen and one city police officer opened fire on the crowd of students. Dozens of fleeing students were wounded; Sam Hammond, Henry Smith, and Delano Middleton were later pronounced dead at the Orangeburg Regional Hospital.

In the aftermath of the killings, the bowling alley and most remaining whites-only establishments in Orangeburg were desegregated. Federal prosecutors charged nine patrolmen with deprivation of rights under color of law by firing on the demonstrators, but they were acquitted in the subsequent trial. The state of South Carolina charged one of the protestors, Cleveland Sellers, with several riot charges. He was convicted on charges relating to events two days before the massacre. Sellers received a full pardon in 1993. In 2001, Jim Hodges became the first governor to make a formal apology for the massacre.

==Background==
Orangeburg had a long history of student civil rights activism leading up to the events of 1968. In March 1960, students at South Carolina State College and Claflin College marched through downtown to protest segregation. Led by Charles McDew and Thomas Gaither (later known as a member of the Friendship Nine), the approximately 1,000 marchers were assaulted by firemen and police officers with fire hoses and tear gas. Police arrested close to 400 students and confined many of them outdoors in a cattle stockade. The events prompted administrators at South Carolina State College to promise that students involved in any future demonstrations would be expelled.

The South Carolina State College (State College) underwent a major change in administration just before the 1967–1968 school year. The college had been led for the preceding decade by President Brenner Turner, a conservative on civil rights who strove to maintain good relations with the white state government. Students were bound by a strict code of conduct and forbidden to form political organizations or take part in civil rights protests. These policies provoked sporadic student protests that the Turner administration firmly shut down. However, in the spring of 1967, student frustration exploded in a prolonged walkout that paralyzed the school. Students convinced Governor McNair to mediate, leading to Turner&#x27;s resignation. The new interim president lifted many of the restrictions on students, including allowing political clubs to be established on campus. The two most important of these were the Black Awareness Coordinating Committee (BACC) and a chapter of the NAACP. The NAACP chapter took a moderate stance on civil rights and had over 300 members. The BACC was much smaller—its membership hovered around twenty students—and represented students who embraced black pride and were interested in black power. To the white community and the black middle class, the creation of the BACC was ominous. They associated black power with the radical rhetoric of the new Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) leaders such as Stokely Carmichael and H. Rap Brown. This view was reinforced when a SNCC organizer, Cleveland Sellers, arrived in Orangeburg in October. In his autobiography, Sellers wrote that he had returned to his home state because &quot;I believed I could develop a movement by focusing attention on the problems of the poor blacks in South Carolina.&quot; The Orangeburg elites viewed Sellers as an outside agitator who was there to stir up trouble.

There were several ongoing sources of racial tension at State College and in the surrounding city. An independent committee had been set up after Turner&#x27;s resignation to investigate how conditions at the college could be improved, and the issued a list of recommendations. However, by the start of 1968 the board of trustees had still not formally accepted their findings. Despite a wide disparity in funding between State College and white colleges in South Carolina, in January, Governor McNair announced that he was rejecting State College&#x27;s request for a budget increase. Orangeburg had not yet seen the same civil rights reforms as most areas in the south. Many institutions remained segregated, including doctors&#x27; offices, entertainment venues, and the Orangeburg Regional Hospital. Political offices remained beyond the reach of black citizens, in part because the city boundaries were gerrymandered to exclude blacks.

== Integration campaign at All-Star Bowling Lane ==
In the summer and fall of 1967, a whites-only bowling alley near campus, All-Star Bowling Lane, became a focus of student protests. Owner Harry K. Floyd repeatedly refused students&#x27; requests to desegregate. Instead, he followed the trend of replacing his &quot;Whites Only&quot; sign with one saying &quot;Privately Owned&quot; (and saying that only &quot;club members&quot; would be allowed in). In October, the college&#x27;s NAACP chapter invited a lawyer to discuss how they could mount a legal challenge. The lawyer explained that while the legal status of segregated bowling alleys was unclear, the fact that All-Star had a lunch counter meant that it was required to desegregate under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Student activist John Stroman devised a plan to prove that Floyd&#x27;s club-members-only strategy was a cover for refusing black patrons: he would ask a white student without a club membership to try bowling at the alley. On Monday, February 5, 1968, the white student arrived and was able to start bowling without being asked to prove his club membership. A little while later, Stroman and a group of black students arrived and asked to bowl. When the staff refused to let them, the students tried sitting at the lunch counter and were refused service there as well. The staff threw away anything they touched. Stroman pointed out to Floyd that the white student had been allowed to bowl without ever showing that he was a member, but Floyd just called the police. City Police Chief Roger Poston arrived and ordered the alley closed for the night. Chief Poston then met with Stroman and told him that he would have to arrest him for trespassing if he returned to the bowling alley. Stroman responded that getting arrested was his plan so that he could challenge the policy in court.

Stroman and a group of about 40 students returned to the bowling alley on Tuesday evening. They were met by 20 officers led by Chief Poston and South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) Chief J. P. Strom. Chief Poston told Stroman that 40 was probably more than needed to start the court case, so Stroman asked the women and any men who did not want to be arrested to leave. The fifteen remaining staged a brief sit-in and were arrested for trespassing. To this point, everything had proceeded as planned. But as the police were leading the arrestees outside, another student was arrested for cursing at an officer. One student later recalled that this was a turning point, saying &quot;[e]verything was cool until the cops rushed into the crowd of students outside in the parking lot and arrested some cat.&quot; As the arrestees were driven downtown, one student returned to campus and shared news of the arrests with a crowd leaving a movie theater. The crowd, without knowing the arrests were planned, arrived at the bowling alley to make sure the arrestees were not being mistreated. When the police saw the new crowd gathering, they offered to release Stroman and his classmates on the condition that they help defuse the situation at the bowling alley. This worked at first; Stroman and the others returned and were able to explain that the arrests were planned. Students began to return to campus.

The mood of the crowd changed when a fire truck arrived. Fire hoses had been used in Orangeburg as a form of crowd control and had a reputation for brutality. Chief Poston was unaware of this and had called the truck as backup. The students interpreted the move as an act of aggression, and they began to shout insults at the firefighters. The police moved away from the alley to protect the fire truck from the students. A student then broke one of the alley&#x27;s windows. The police arrested the suspect, but the crowd blocked them from leaving. Police and students began yelling abuse at each other. Although it is not clear which happened first, police began beating students with billy clubs and one student sprayed something in an officer&#x27;s eyes. The beatings continued for several minutes. Witnesses described seeing an officer grab and restrain a female student while another beat her with his club. Others reported seeing &quot;a young woman begging not to be hit again, even as a policeman swung his club&quot;. Cecil Williams recalled seeing two officers beating a female student who fell while fleeing. Eight students and one officer were sent to the hospital. The rest of the students fled back to campus, some smashing the windows of cars and businesses on their way. Although the Associated Press ran a story the following day claiming that cars had been overturned; in fact, the students had not overturned any cars and had caused less than $5000 in damages.

As soon as students arrived back on campus, they held an impromptu mass meeting. Sellers was present at the meeting, and, when asked for his advice, suggested that the students immediately occupy the intersections in front of campus and demand to speak to the chamber of commerce about the bowling alley issue. This proposal was rejected. Eventually, the students agreed to ask permission to hold a protest march the following day and drew up a list of ten demands. The demands included desegregating the bowling alley, the hospital, and doctors&#x27; offices as well as an end to police brutality.

===Escalation of tensions===
Tensions escalated rapidly over the next few days. On Wednesday morning, the student leaders submitted their request to hold a march, but were rebuffed. Instead, Mayor E. O. Pandarvis, City Manager Bob Stevenson, and several Orangeburg business leaders came to the State College campus in an attempt to placate the students. City leaders were unprepared for the students&#x27; questions and had no response to the demands read off by the students. The head of the chamber of commerce was slightly more conciliatory and offered to read the demands at the chamber&#x27;s next meeting. There was no local media coverage of the students&#x27; grievances: &quot;The Times and Democrat&quot; (Orangeburg&#x27;s local newspaper) did not publish the students&#x27; list of demands until several days later (when they reported that the city council had rejected them). In a journal article published a few months after the shooting, &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter Jim Hoagland argued that this media silence may have contributed to the students&#x27; frustration and anger.

There were several outbreaks of violence on Wednesday. With no protest planned, frustrated students gathered in informal groups to discuss the police &quot;whipping our girls&quot;. Several crowds of angry students threw rocks and bricks at cars driving on U.S. Route 601 that contained white passengers. Police responded by setting up roadblocks to block traffic. Two blocks from campus, a homeowner shot and injured three Claflin College students who he said had been trespassing. Late that night, two white men drove a car onto campus and shot at students before being chased off with rocks and bottles.

On Wednesday evening Governor McNair decided to activate the National Guard. His main concern, shared by the police chiefs, was based on the unfounded rumor that the &quot;plan of the black power people&quot; was to attack utilities and burn down the city. Therefore, 250 Orangeburg-area National Guards took up positions protecting utilities across the city, joined by hundreds of highway patrol officers. On Thursday, McNair ordered an additional 110 National Guardsmen to Orangeburg. They were joined by FBI agents, officers from SLED, and Governor McNair&#x27;s representatives. Journalist Jack Shuler argued that the arrival of these outside officials &quot;disrupted any kind of communication among white leaders, the college campuses, and the African American community&quot;. Shuler cites Sellers as saying that while negotiations had been slow before the arrival of state officials, afterwards they broke down.

==Shooting==
By the evening of Thursday, February 8, tensions were high and the police had set up a command post (nicknamed &quot;Checkpoint Charlie&quot;) at the intersection of Russell Street and US Highway 601 to monitor the State College campus. Around 7:00 p.m., about 50 State College students gathered at the front of campus to start a bonfire. Police intervened to stop them and called up additional Highway Patrolmen to Checkpoint Charlie and to a warehouse and freight depot across from Claflin College (see map). Students began to shout insults at the police. A .22 caliber pistol was fired from a dormitory over their heads of the police stationed near the warehouse and freight depot. About 9:30 p.m., a larger group of students led by State College student Henry Smith made a second attempt at building a bonfire. This time they were successful, using wood from a nearby abandoned house. About 200 students from State College, Claflin, and Wilkinson High School spent the next hour gathered around the bonfire in good spirits. They told reporters that they would stay as long as the police did.

More than 130 police from at least five agencies were positioned near the front of State College&#x27;s campus. They were under the overall command of SLED Chief Strom, and under orders from Governor McNair not to let the students leave campus. Through journalist intermediaries, Strom attempted to get the students to move away from the front of campus, a request that they refused unless the police would leave first. At about 10:30 p.m., Strom and the other leading officers decided to call a firetruck to put out the bonfire. When the truck arrived, it advanced slowly up U.S. 601 with a police escort. On the truck&#x27;s left, between the highway and railroad tracks were the National Guard. On the truck&#x27;s right, a squad of highway patrol officers under Lieutenant Jesse Spell advanced up Watson Street. The students retreated towards Lowman Hall, throwing rocks and bottles. The fire was quickly extinguished but continued to smolder. As Spell&#x27;s squad turned to scale the embankment at the end of Watson Street, someone threw two white banister posts at patrolmen Donald Crosby and David Shealy. Crosby ducked, but Shealy was struck in the mouth and injured. The other patrolmen thought that Shealy had been shot, and several rushed to his aid.

About five minutes later (around 10:38 p.m.), many of the students began to walk back towards the embankment, unaware that the patrolmen believed Shealy had been shot. Most of the sixty-six patrolmen in front of them had taken up positions behind the embankment or in the surrounding vegetation and were invisible to the students. When the first students reached about 100 feet from the officers, some witnesses recalled hearing a patrolman fire a shot into the air, possibly as a warning. Other witnesses would later recall hearing a whistle, as if signalling to fire. In either case, the noise caused the students to turn and run, some holding their hands in the air or dropping to the ground. Lieutenant Spell then shouted &quot;now&quot;; he and at least eight other patrolmen opened fire on the students. City police officer John Cook joined in as well, and four additional patrolmen fired over the students&#x27; heads. The shooting lasted eight seconds. Most patrolmen fired from Remington Model 870 shotguns, while a few used carbines and one fired a pistol. After expending several rounds, Lieutenant Spell gave the order to cease fire.

===Victims===
Thirty-one victims are known to have been hit by police fire. The victims&#x27; ages ranged between 15 and 23. They included seven students from Claflin, nineteen from State College, and three from Wilkinson High School. Two others were not students: Joseph Hampton, a recent State College graduate and Cleveland Sellers, a SNCC community organizer. Most victims sustained injuries from behind while fleeing or on the soles of the feet while lying on the ground. The most serious non-fatal wounds included those to Bobby Burton, whose left arm was paralyzed, and to Ernest Raymond Carson, who was hit by eight buckshot slugs. Three of those injured would later die of their wounds at the Orangeburg Regional Hospital: Samuel Ephesians Hammond, Delano Herman Middleton, and Henry Ezekial Smith. Smith and Hammond were both State College students, while Middleton was a senior at Wilkinson High School. Hammond was killed by a shot to his back. Middleton received seven bullet wounds: three to his arm and one each to his hip, thigh, and heart. Smith was killed by shots from both sides, leaving five bullet wounds. Many of the student witnesses believed that the patrolmen had mistaken Smith for Sellers and had aimed their fire at him. The patrolmen testified that they had not aimed at any specific target.

===Immediate aftermath ===
The injured students were taken to the segregated waiting room at Orangeburg Regional Hospital. Reporters overheard one of the patrolmen gloating over police radio, saying &quot;You should have been here, ol&#x27; buddy; got a couple of &#x27;em tonight.&quot; Over the next few hours the police arrested and heavily beat several more people. Louise Kelly Crawley would suffer a miscarriage after she was arrested and beaten while taking injured students to the hospital. John Carson approached several officers in the waiting room and demanded to know why they had shot his younger brother, Ernest Raymond, eight times. The patrolmen refused to answer, and when Caron continued to repeat his question, they placed him under arrest and beat him in the head with their rifle butts. Cleveland Sellers was arrested while awaiting hospital treatment; he would later be charged with inciting a riot, arson, assault and battery with intent to kill, property damage, housebreaking, and grand larceny. Some of the hospital staff insulted and demeaned the students. Oscar Butler recalled overhearing a staff member say &quot;they asked for it&quot;.

Half an hour after the shooting, a group of students broke into the ROTC building and stole a handful of training rifles. The rifles lacked firing pins and, after other students spoke to the group that had stolen the rifles, they were returned within about twenty minutes.

==Public reactions and media coverage==
The reaction of the mainstream media was mainly indifference or support for the actions of the police. Civil rights demonstrations had come to be seen as violent after major riots in Detroit and Newark the previous summer. According to journalist and later historian Dave Nolan, &quot;most whites seemed to feel that it was justified to put them down as brutally as possible.&quot; This predisposition was reinforced by inaccurate reporting on the ground. The Associated Press reported that there had been a &quot;heavy exchange of gunfire&quot; and never issued a correction. Newspapers across the country ran the AP story with headlines such as &quot;Three Die in Riot&quot;, &quot;Trio Slain after Opening Fire on Police&quot;, or &quot;Three Killed as Negroes, Police Exchange Shots&quot;. Governor McNair gave a speech about the massacre the following day. He called it &quot;...one of the saddest days in the history of South Carolina&quot;, but said that the shootings had taken place off campus, that the officers were reacting to being fired upon, and that the shootings had been necessary &quot;to protect life and property.&quot; He accused &quot;black power advocates&quot; of having &quot;sparked&quot; the incident, and mentioned the theft of ROTC rifles as having helped escalate the situation. The Governor&#x27;s office blamed Cleveland Sellers in particular. McNair&#x27;s spokesman told reporters that Sellers was &quot;the main man. He&#x27;s the biggest nigger in the crowd&quot; and said that he was the one who had thrown the banister at Officer Shealy. The Governor&#x27;s account of events was widely accepted by the mainstream media in the weeks following the event. Most of the white reporters in Orangeburg failed to investigate official claims, interview key witnesses, or ask the police probing questions. According to &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter Jim Hoagland, they &quot;covered the story largely from the Holiday Inn.&quot;

Martin Luther King Jr. blamed the massacre on SLED Chief J. P. Strom, and called for an investigation by the US Attorney General. The NAACP&#x27;s executive director Roy Wilkins echoed King&#x27;s call for an investigation. John Lewis accused the white press of conspiring to obscure the true nature of events. SNCC chairman Rap Brown issued the most radical statement, calling for black people to take up arms in self-defense and to &quot;die like men&quot;. In the State College newspaper &quot;The Collegian&quot;, students decried the inaccurate reporting in the mainstream press and argued for why the anti-segregation protests were justified. Black students staged demonstrations across the country. In Greenville, South Carolina, black and white students (mostly from Furman) protested together against the killings.

Despite the fact that the Orangeburg Massacre was the first time police shot and killed students on a United States university campus, they received much less media coverage than the later police shootings at Kent State and Jackson State. For example, the week&#x27;s issue of &quot;Time&quot; did not mention the event. Dave Nolan argues that the subject of the protests may have played a role: by 1968, the white public was no longer supportive of demonstrations against segregation, whereas at the time the Kent and Jackson State students were killed, the Vietnam War was a highly charged national issue. Jack Bass and civil rights lawyer Eva Paterson argue that race was a key factor; the most famous of the three incidents (Kent State) was the one where the victims were white. Bass also suggests that the fact that Orangeburg happened at night, meaning there were fewer videos or photographs, had an impact on public reactions. Survivor Thomas Kennerly blamed the lack of attention on the reactions of state officials. He also recalled that the Orangeburg Massacre was followed by the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, which quickly took over the news cycle. In contrast, Kent State and Jackson State happened in close succession, keeping the issue of how campus unrest was handled by law enforcement and university administrations in the public eye.

==Subsequent protests==
Orangeburg remained in a state of high tension in the weeks after the shootings. Both colleges closed and let their students return home. McNair placed Orangeburg under a curfew. Hundreds of National Guards and highway patrolmen remained in the city despite a petition by 800 black residents to have them withdrawn. The NAACP launched a boycott of all of Orangeburg&#x27;s white businesses starting on February 11.

On March 7, BACC organized a protest of 200 Orangeburg students at the South Carolina State House. A group led by Steve Moore attempted to read a petition to the South Carolina Senate from the gallery, but was stopped and six students were arrested. On March 13, BACC led a second protest of 1000 students to Columbia and were met by police in riot gear. After some resistance, McNair eventually agreed to meet with a delegation of students.

==Court cases==
On February 10, the Department of Justice filed a suit against Harry Floyd (who insisted that he had a right to refuse business to black patrons). The department also filed against the Orangeburg Regional Hospital, which remained segregated despite having promised to integrate in 1965. On February 22, federal Judge Robert Martin ordered All-Star Bowling Lane to desegregate. John Stroman became one of the first group of black students to bowl there on the day classes resumed, February 26. Most businesses in Orangeburg followed suit and desegregated.

Federal prosecutors filed an information against the nine state patrolmen who had admitted to firing on the crowd, including Lt. Spell. They were charged with carrying out summary justice, thereby depriving the students of their civil rights. It was the first federal trial of police officers for using excessive force at a campus protest. The state patrol officers&#x27; defense was that they felt they were in danger, and protesters had shot at the officers first. All nine defendants were acquitted, although 36 witnesses stated they did not hear gunfire from the protesters on the campus before the shooting, and no students were found to be carrying guns. In 2007, the FBI reopened the case as part of its re-examination of civil rights-era crimes, but it declined to bring charges because the nine officers had already been acquitted. In 2008, the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act made it possible to reopen cold cases from before 1970, and starting in 2010, the deaths of Smith, Middleton, and Hammond have been on the Department of Justice&#x27;s list of unsolved civil rights cases.

In 1970, the State of South Carolina charged Cleveland Sellers with riot on the night of February 8. However, after the prosecution failed to present sufficient evidence of Seller&#x27;s involvement in the events that day, the judge directed a verdict of not guilty on that charge. Instead, the judge asked the jury to consider whether Sellers was guilty of riot on February 6. The jury convicted him and he was sentenced to a fine and one year in prison. He served seven months, getting time off for good behavior. In 1993, Sellers applied for and was granted a full pardon from the South Carolina Board of Paroles and Pardons. During a conference at The Citadel on the 35th anniversary of massacre, Sellers shared his perspective on the trial and its significance:

==Legacy==
Soon after the event, students and activists dubbed it the &quot;Orangeburg Massacre&quot;. According to Cleveland Sellers, the name was chosen to be reminiscent of the Sharpeville massacre. In Sharpeville, South African police had open fired on and killed dozens of unarmed anti-apartheid activists. Robert McNair strongly disliked the name because he thought it suggested the shootings had been pre-planned. Nevertheless, &quot;Orangeburg Massacre&quot; gradually became the accepted name in the decades after the event.

South Carolina State College (now South Carolina State University) has multiple memorials dedicated to the victims. The gymnasium that opened later in the same year as the massacre was named the Smith–Hammond–Middleton Memorial Center in their honor. The college built a granite monument with the names of the victims at the center of campus in 1969. In 2000, the university erected a South Carolina Historical Marker explaining the history of the massacre near the entrance to campus. In 2022, bronze busts of the three men killed were installed behind the granite memorial. Memorial services are held every year. From 1969 to 1983 they were held at the SHM Memorial Center and since then they have been held at the monument. In 2001, on the 33rd anniversary of the killings, Governor Jim Hodges became the first governor to attend the annual memorial. He issued a formal apology for the massacre. That same year, an oral history project recorded interviews with eight of the survivors.

A joint resolution was introduced in the South Carolina state general assembly in 2003 and re-introduced in each of the next three sessions of the legislature to establish an official investigation of the events of February 8, 1968, and to establish February 8 as a day of remembrance for the students killed and wounded in the protest. However, the legislature never voted on the resolution.

Several works of media have also been produced about the event. It was the subject of two films released after its 40th anniversary in April 2008: &quot;Scarred Justice: The Orangeburg Massacre, 1968&quot; by documentary filmmakers Bestor Cram and Judy Richardson; and &quot;Black Magic&quot; by Dan Klores. In 2009, the SC State Henderson Players (an acting troop of SC State students) put on a play about the events called &quot;Take a Stand&quot;.

In 2019 Cecil J. Williams, a graduate of Claflin, opened a civil rights museum that includes a collection of photographs he took of the days before and after the shooting. It is South Carolina&#x27;s first civil rights museum.

Ain Zaatout () is the administrative name of a mountainous village in north east Algeria, called Ah Frah in the local Shawi dialect, and Beni Farah (sometimes spelled Beni Ferah) () in Arabic.

It is located at 35.14° North, 5.83° East, at the southern edge of the Saharan Atlas between the provinces of Batna and Biskra. The region is largely rocky with an average altitude of more than 900 metres (2,953 feet) above sea level.

Aïn Zaatout has an estimated population of around 5,000 composed of Farhi people, Muslim Berbers speaking a distinctive variant of the Shawi dialect used in the Aurès.

<text>Oxford Blood is a crime novel by Antonia Fraser first published in 1985.

The novel begins with reporter Jemima Shore making a television documentary at Oxford University. Most prominent among the undergraduates is Lord Saffron, a wealthy, twenty-year-old heir to a former (British) Foreign Secretary. Soon she discovers that there is a mystery about Lord Saffron&#x27;s birth and bloodline, based on the confession of a dying midwife. Later another undergraduate is murdered, and a series of attempts are made to kill Saffron, including a night-time attack while punting on the River Thames.

<doc id="1281270" wikidata="Q3752865" url="?curid=1281270" title="Free, White and 21">
<text>Free, White and 21 is a 1963 movie by self-proclaimed &quot;schlockmeister&quot; director Larry Buchanan. It was based on the true story of the controversial trial of a black man accused of raping a white woman in Dallas, Texas in the 1960s. The title is a version of the archaic American idiomatic phrase &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;beholden to no one&quot;.

==Plot==
The central conflict in this film is whether African-American businessman Ernie Jones raped Swedish immigrant and civil rights Freedom Rider Greta Mae Hansen. Jones was the proprietor of the hotel at which Hansen decided to stay during her time in Dallas. The movie is primarily a courtroom drama, with many of the key events portrayed in flashback sequences as Jones and Hansen testify.

==Cast==
* Frederick O&#x27;Neal as Ernie Jones
* Annalena Lund as Greta Mae Hansen
* George Edgley as Judge
* Johnny Hicks as Prosecuting Attorney Atkins
* George R. Russell as Defense Attorney Tyler

==Production==
The movie was based on a true story about an English girl who stayed at a motel owned by Tony Davis, a black disc jockey. She later claimed Davis raped her and he was arrested. Davis was a friend of Buchanan, and agreed to work with him on the film even before the trial concluded. Before the film was completed, Buchanan showed an assembly cut to James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff of American International Pictures (AIP), who agreed to distribute it.

==Release==
The film was released with the gimmick of having the audiences act as a jury and be given ballot papers to mark deciding whether the accused was innocent or guilty. The movie was successful at the box office and led to a series of collaborations between Buchanan and AIP. Samuel Z. Arkoff encouraged the filmmakers to produce a similar film specifically targeted at younger audiences. The resultant picture, &quot;Under Age&quot;, was released in 1964 and featured several of the same actors reprising their roles from &quot;Free, White and 21&quot;.

==Critical response==
A contemporary review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film as a &quot;low-budget courtroom drama&quot; in which &quot;both protagonists emerge as unpleasant and unsympathetic characters,&quot; and that &quot;some socially conscious spectators will find the subject matter significant enough to overlook the film&#x27;s unconvincing dialogue, awkward acting and total absence of cinematic technique.&quot;

<doc id="1281272" wikidata="Q4051975" url="?curid=1281272" title="German submarine U-262">
<text>German submarine &quot;U-262&quot; was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; during World War II.

The submarine was laid down on 29 May 1941 at the Bremer Vulkan yard at Bremen-Vegesack as yard number 27. She was launched on 10 March 1942 and commissioned on 15 April under the command of &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Günther Schiebusch.

She was a member of nine wolfpacks, sinking three merchant ships and one warship.

==Design==
German Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. &quot;U-262&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two AEG GU 460/8–27 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-262&quot; was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and two twin C/30 anti-aircraft guns. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty.

==Service history==

===First and second patrols===
Having moved from Kiel in Germany to Bergen in Norway in September 1942, &quot;U-262&quot;″s first patrol was marked by an unsuccessful attack by two Lockheed Hudsons, but the damage inflicted was serious enough to warrant an early return to Bergen.

Her second foray followed the Norwegian coast to Narvik but was otherwise uneventful.

===Third patrol===
The U-boat sailed from Narvik on 5 November 1942, now under the command of &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Heinz Franke, and headed out to the waters east of Newfoundland, sailing first west from Narvik then north, parallel to the eastern Greenland coast; after that turning about, negotiating the Denmark Strait between Greenland and Iceland.

On 18 November, as part of wolfpack &quot;Kreuzotter&quot;, she attacked the Convoy ONS 144, firing a spread of three torpedoes, one of which hit the Norwegian , fatally damaging the vessel. The commander ordered the crew to abandon ship, &quot;U-262&quot; hit her with another torpedo, breaking the ship in two.

She also sank the 7,178 GRT British cargo ship &quot;Ocean Crusader&quot;, a straggler from Convoy HX 216 northeast of St. John&#x27;s on 26 November. &quot;U-262&quot; arrived at her new home port of La Pallice on the French Atlantic coast on 9 December 1942.

===Fourth patrol===
The U-boat departed La Pallice on 16 January 1943 for a patrol out into the mid-Atlantic. On 6 February she fired five torpedoes at a tanker and a steamer, sinking the 2,864 GRT Polish cargo ship &quot;Zagloba&quot;, east southeast of Cape Farewell (Greenland), a straggler of Convoy SC 118. There were no survivors.

&quot;U-262&quot; returned to La Pallice on 15 February.

===Fifth patrol===
&quot;U-262&quot; sailed again on 27 March 1943 and headed across the Atlantic to Prince Edward Island to pick up German POWs that were to escape from their camp in Operation Elster. On 15 April, while en route, she was shadowing Convoy HX 233, when the U-boat was attacked by depth charges and gunfire from the convoy escorts, forcing her to break off the attack. The U-boat then completed her mission, but no escaped POWs showed up at the rendezvous. She returned to La Pallice on 25 May.

===Sixth patrol===
&quot;U-262&quot; left La Pallice next on 24 July 1943, commanded by the newly promoted &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Heinz Franke, and headed across the Atlantic. On 8 August &quot;U-262&quot; was waiting to refuel from while was being supplied, when a Grumman TBF Avenger/Grumman F4F Wildcat team from the aircraft carrier located the boats and attacked &quot;U-262&quot;. While attempting to drop depth charges, the Avenger was hit by flak and caught fire, but managed to drop two charges, severely damaging &quot;U-262&quot;, before ditching into the sea. The Wildcat was also shot down by &quot;U-262&quot; during a strafing run. The damage received forced the U-boat to abort her patrol, she returned home on 2 September.

===Seventh patrol===
The U-boat sailed on 14 October 1943 for the waters northeast of the Azores. There she was involved in attacks on three Allied convoys. On 31 October during the attack on SL 138/MKS 28, she sank the Norwegian 2,968 GRT merchant ship &quot;Hallfried&quot;. Franke&#x27;s actions in this patrol were marked by efficient shadowing and determined attacks, for which he was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross.

&quot;U-262&quot; returned to La Pallice on 7 December.

===Eighth and ninth patrol===
Under a new commander, &quot;Oblt.z.S.&quot; Helmut Wieduwilt, &quot;U-262&quot; covered the area southwest of Iceland on 3 February 1944, but had no success. She returned home on 29 April after 87 days at sea. &quot;U-262&quot;″s next patrol was similarly uneventful, but lasted only 10 days from 6–15 June. She did not leave the Bay of Biscay. She returned to La Pallice to be fitted with a &quot;Schnorchel&quot; underwater-breathing apparatus.

===Tenth patrol===
After an air raid killed three and wounded one of her crew, the U-boat sailed from La Pallice on 23 August 1944, north to the area south of Iceland, before heading east and south through the North Sea to Flensburg, arriving on 5 November after 75 days.

===Damage and disposal===
While at Gotenhafen (Gdynia, Poland) in December 1944 the U-boat was again damaged by bombing. Struck from the active list at Kiel on 2 April 1945, she was broken up in 1947.

<text>Petre Sebeşanu Aurelian, 13 December 1833 – 24 January 1909, was a Romanian economist, politician and academic. A member of the National Liberal Party (PNL), he served as a Prime Minister of Romania between 2 December 1896 and 12 April 1897.

Born in Slatina on 13 December 1833, he studied at Saint Sava College, Bucharest and then in France at the Superior School of Agronomy of Grignon, where he studied between 1856 and 1860. After he returned to Romania, he became an engineer at the Public Works Ministry and a professor at the Agriculture School of Pantelimon, as well as an editor at the &quot;Monitorul&quot; and &quot;Agronomia&quot; publications. He published the well-known monograph &quot;Terra nostra&quot; that compared the lower birth rates of Romanian Orthodox to those that were higher among the &quot;Israelites&quot; (Jews in Moldova) and was emphatic that the fate of the Romanian people was at stake.

He was a deputy, a senator, the minister of Public Works (1877–1878 and 1887–1888), of agriculture and of Education (1882–1884).

Aurelian was elected as member of the Romanian Academy in 1871 and was its president between 1896 and 1897. He died in Bucharest on 24 January 1909.

<text>Thor Steinar is a German clothing brand manufactured by Thor Steinar Mediatex GmbH, a subsidiary of International Brands General Trading, a Dubai-based company.

In Germany, the brand is considered closely associated to neo-Nazism by the &quot;Verfassungschutz&quot; of the state of Brandenburg. In German media, the brand is most often discussed in the light of this association. Wearing Thor Steinar clothes is expressly forbidden in the Bundestag, the Landtage of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Saxony, and in several football stadiums.

==History==
The brand was registered as a trademark by Axel Kopelke in October 2002 and was manufactured by Mediatex GmbH. In March 2009, Mediatex sold the brand to International Brands General Trading, a Dubai-based company.

== Controversy ==

Since the inception of Thor Steinar, the company has used two logos. Much of the controversy regarding the clothing label revolves around their first logo, featuring a combination of a *tiwaz rune and a *sowilo rune: the runes were so combined that a part of the logo became very similar to the wolfsangel which is used by some organisations with neo-Nazi connections. It was also used by the Nazis as exemplified by the insignia of the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich. In addition there is some similarity to the insignia of the Schutzstaffel.
The manufacturers of the Thor Steinar brand rejected this interpretation of the original logo.

Their second logo is a Gyfu rune, similar in appearance to a saltire, and has not caused controversy. This rune is known as an apolitical symbol given its historical relationship to pre-Christian mythology.

On occasions, Thor Steinar shops have been attacked with stones or paint bombs.

===Germany===
In Germany, public display of Nazi-associated symbols, as well as glorification of Adolf Hitler and denial of the Holocaust, are illegal (under Strafgesetzbuch section 86a and Strafgesetzbuch paragraph 130, respectively). Despite that, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, which collects domestic intelligence for the government, appraises the number of active participants of the far-right movement at around 40,000.

Various authorities and organizations, including Brandenburg &quot;Verfassungsschutz&quot;, have identified the wearing of Thor Steinar clothes as one of the indications of membership in the far-right subculture.

Wearing the label is prohibited in the German Bundestag and in the Landtags of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Saxony. In addition, several football clubs including Tennis Borussia Berlin, Borussia Dortmund, Werder Bremen, Hamburger SV and Hertha BSC prohibit wearing the label in their stadiums. The online retailer Amazon stopped selling the brand in 2009. Despite this, Amazon has since been criticized for employing internal security guards with far-right connections who wore the same clothing.

===Norway===
Various designs by Thor Steinar have had Norwegian flags and Norwegian names, such as Trondheim, Nordfjord, Nordstrand or Bergen. The official stores selling the clothes are also named after the oldest Norwegian city, Tønsberg. The government filed a complaint against the use of the Norwegian flag in February 2008. The legal complaint however failed and it is unlikely that a second attempt will be made. The Norwegian Embassy, the Norwegian Office for Foreign Affairs were informed by Mediatex – the company behind the Thor Steinar brand – in December 2007 that future collections starting and including the spring and summer 2008 collection will no longer use the national symbol of Norway. The company issued a statement in response to the issue.

===Brevik store===
Until 2008, the chain operated a store named &quot;Brevik&quot;, for the town Brevik in Telemark, Norway. In February 2012, Thor Steinar opened a new store in Chemnitz also with the name &quot;Brevik&quot;. Its similarity to the last name of Anders Behring Breivik (who committed the July 2011 Norway attacks) in conjunction with his far-right politics led to public outcry and local authorities sought to have the store closed. The store was eventually renamed to Tønsberg in March 2012.

<text>Benjamin Bagby (born February 20, 1950) is an American singer, composer, harpist, and performer of medieval music.

==Biography==
Born in Evanston, Illinois, Bagby was educated at Oberlin College, Ohio, and the Schola Cantorum in Basel, Bagby founded the ensemble Sequentia with Barbara Thornton in 1977. This group takes an innovative approach to medieval repertoires, especially with respect to their treatment of mode: they rely on the harmonic qualities of their voices to guide them through the different modes. Sequentia has released many recordings, most of them on Deutsche Harmonia Mundi. During the 1980s and 1990s, the group specialized in the music of Hildegard of Bingen; many of their most famous recordings are from this period. The group has also performed music written in the 12th century from the musical centers Santiago de Compostela, Aquitaine, and Notre-Dame de Paris.

Benjamin Bagby&#x27;s work as a composer also contributes to his recreations of the ancient epics, such as &quot;Beowulf&quot;, the Icelandic &quot;Edda&quot; and German music from the 10th and 11th centuries on their recent recording &quot;Lost Songs of a Rhineland Harper.&quot; His version of &quot;Beowulf&quot;, which he has been touring around the world since the 1990s, is available on DVD (from a show in Copenhagen); his performance on May 9, 2003, at the International Congress on Medieval Studies is documented and discussed in, and was an impetus for, the 2012 anthology &quot;Beowulf at Kalamazoo&quot;.

He gave presentations internationally including at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools.

Bagby (widowed from his longtime collaborator Barbara Thornton) married Croatian chant scholar Katarina Livljanić.

<text>Ann McLaughlin Korologos (born Ann Marie Lauenstein; November 16, 1941 – January 30, 2023), formerly known as Ann Dore McLaughlin, was an American corporate executive who served as the 19th United States secretary of labor from 1987 to 1989.

== Life and career ==
Born and raised in Chatham, New Jersey, Ann Marie Lauenstein was the daughter of Marie (née Koellhoffer) and Edward Joseph Lauenstein, a manufacturer representative for a wartime ammunitions company. She had one sibling, an older brother. She was educated at Saint Patrick School in Chatham, the Academy of Saint Elizabeth, and Marymount College, Tarrytown of Fordham University, where she spent a year studying abroad at the University of London. She earned an Executive MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1988.

She received honorary degrees from Marymount, the University of Rhode Island, the New England School of Law, the College of Saint Elizabeth, and Tri-State University.

In 1972 and 1973, she served as the press secretary for the Inaugural Concerts for Nixon&#x27;s second inauguration. In 1987, she was appointed to the presidential cabinet as Secretary of Labor by Ronald Reagan. Before becoming the Labor Secretary, she had served in the Reagan administration as Under Secretary of the Department of the Interior and as Under Secretary of the Department of the Treasury. 

From 1990 to 1995, she was head of the Federal City Council, a group of business, civic, education, and other leaders interested in economic development in Washington, D.C. From 1996 to 2000, she was the chair of the Aspen Institute. From 2000 to 2006, she was on the board of directors of Microsoft, from which she resigned due to &quot;increasing demands on her time from other professional and personal commitments&quot;.

In 2008, she was on the District of Columbia Republican presidential primary ballot as a John McCain delegate.

McLaughlin Korologos served as a member of the board of directors of several companies, including Fannie Mae, Vulcan Materials Company, and the Kellogg Company, and from 2004 to 2009 served as chairman of the RAND Corporation board of trustees.

Previously, she was married to William Dore, a financial investor. In 1975, she married the political commentator and former Jesuit priest John McLaughlin, after having served as his campaign manager in his 1970 failed challenge against Senator John Orlando Pastore for his Rhode Island seat in the United States Senate. They divorced in 1992.

In 2000, Ann McLaughlin married Tom C. Korologos, a former U.S. Ambassador to Belgium who had been appointed by George W. Bush. He also had been a lobbyist before becoming a White House aide during the Nixon and Ford administration. His photography was exhibited in the art gallery she purchased in 2007.

She died from complications of meningitis on January 30, 2023, at the age of 81.

== Ann Korologos Gallery ==
Korologos was an avid art collector, and in 2007 she purchased the Basalt Gallery, of Basalt, Colorado. In June 2009, the gallery outgrew its old location and moved to a larger space downtown.

<doc id="1281315" wikidata="Q734597" url="?curid=1281315" title="Kryha">
<text>In the history of cryptography, the Kryha machine was a device for encryption and decryption, appearing in the early 1920s and used until the 1950s. The machine was the invention of (born 31.10.1891 in Charkow, Russian Empire, committed suicide in Baden-Baden in 1955). During the Second World War, Kryha worked as an officer for the German Wehrmacht. There were several versions; the standard Kryha machine weighed around five kilograms, and was totally mechanical. A scaled down pocket version was introduced later on, termed the &quot;Lilliput&quot; model. There was also a more bulky electrical version.

The machine was used for a time by the German Diplomatic Corps, and was adopted by Marconi in England.

==Operation==

The machine consisted of two concentric rings each containing an alphabet. The inner alphabet was stepped a variable number of places by pushing a lever. In operation, the user would encrypt by finding the plaintext letter on one ring (usually the outer ring), and reading the corresponding letter on the other ring; this was then used as the ciphertext letter. When the lever was pressed, the inner ring would step, causing the relationship between the two alphabets to change. The stepping was irregular and governed by the use of a disk with a number of sectors, each containing a number of teeth.
==Cryptanalysis==

The security of the machine was evaluated by the mathematician Georg Hamel, who calculated the size of the key space. The US Army was also contacted to see if they would be interested in using the machine, and were persuaded to accept a challenge message to evaluate the security of the device. The challenge message, 1135 characters long, was solved by William Friedman, assisted by Solomon Kullback, Frank Rowlett and Abraham Sinkov, in 2 hours and 41 minutes.

<doc id="1281319" wikidata="Q275753" url="?curid=1281319" title="Lynn M. Martin">
<text>Lynn Morley Martin (born Judith Lynn Morley; December 26, 1939) is an American businesswoman and former politician who served as the 21st United States secretary of labor from 1991 to 1993, under President George H. W. Bush. A member of the Republican Party, she previously represented in the United States House of Representatives from 1981 to 1991. Before her election to Congress, Martin served in both chambers of 
Illinois General Assembly; in the State House of Representatives from 1977 to 1979, as well as the State Senate from 1979 to 1980 .

==Early life and career==
Martin was born in Evanston, Illinois, the daughter of Helen Catherine (Hall) and Lawrence William Morley, an accountant. She attended Taft High School in Chicago from 1952 to 1956. She was later named to Taft&#x27;s Hall of Fame. In 1960 she graduated from the University of Illinois, where she was a member of the Gamma Phi Beta sorority. After becoming a teacher in the Rockford Public School District, she continued in that job after being elected to public office, serving as a member of the Winnebago County board from 1972 to 1976 before being elected to the Illinois House of Representatives (1977–1979), Illinois Senate (1979–1980), and U.S. House of Representatives (1981–1991).

==U.S. House of Representatives==
She ran for the House, after Representative John B. Anderson retired to run for president in 1980. She won a competitive four-way Republican primary for the open seat. Martin ran on a platform that was fiscally conservative, lower taxes and business deregulation, and socially liberal, pro-choice and advocating for the Equal Rights Amendment.

In the U.S. House, she was vice chair of the House Republican Conference. She was the first woman to be elected to a position in the Republican House Leadership. During her time in Congress, Martin served on the Armed Services Committee, the Budget Committee, and the House Rules Committee. Martin earned the nickname &quot;the Axe&quot; for her efforts to reduce spending while serving on the House Budget Committee. On a number of important issues she split with Republicans: arguing for a minimum wage increase, voting to override President Reagan&#x27;s 1986 veto of a sanctions bill against the apartheid regime in South Africa, joining with Democrats to stiffen punishment for white-collar criminals, and supporting pro-choice legislation.

A loyalist to the Reagan Administration, she assisted then-Vice President George H. W. Bush with his preparation for the 1984 vice presidential debate against Geraldine Ferraro. She brought an unexpected attacking and aggressive style out of the gates in the mock debates, throwing the Vice President off balance and convincing him that he needed to take Ferraro more seriously and prepare more. Martin also was tapped to deliver Bush&#x27;s nominating speech at the Republican National Convention in Dallas. Bush touted her as a possible running mate in his 1988 presidential campaign, though he eventually selected Indiana Senator Dan Quayle.

Martin entered the race for the vacant Republican Conference Chair position, following Dick Cheney of Wyoming&#x27;s decision to run for Whip spot, the second highest leadership position. Martin lost her bid to Jerry Lewis of California by a slim margin of three votes after conservative hardliners mounted a coordinated campaign against her, in part, for her stances on social issues.

==1990 Senate election==

Martin ran for the U.S. Senate in 1990 against Democratic incumbent Paul Simon. She was considered a formidable challenger, but her campaign floundered – in ads, Martin poked fun at Simon&#x27;s signature bow tie, but the humorous ad campaign was seen by some as petty and mean-spirited. Martin&#x27;s campaign suffered from poor fundraising as well, being outspent by Simon by a margin of two-to-one. Simon&#x27;s popularity proved too much to overcome, and he won with 65 percent of the vote, carrying all but two counties in the state; Edwards County in the southeast and McHenry County outside Chicago, in the heart of the district Martin represented for most of the 1980s. In a midterm favorable to Democrats, Martin was further hurt by negative campaign tactics deployed by advisor Roger Ailes, as well as a number of gaffes. Including, referencing downstate voters as &quot;rednecks&quot;. Martin raised the most campaign funds out of any Republican Senate challenger that cycle.

==Secretary of Labor==
Martin was tapped to be Secretary of Labor in the George H. W. Bush administration when Elizabeth Dole resigned to become president of the American Red Cross. Martin was confirmed as Secretary of Labor by the Senate on January 22, 1991, by a vote of 94–0. During her tenure, Martin promoted programs that would help produce a highly skilled workforce. Martin&#x27;s signature policy while Secretary was the promotion of her Glass Ceiling Commission. Martin pushed for greater representation of women and minorities in the corporate world and was crusader against sexual harassment in the work place.

At the 1992 Republican National Convention, Secretary Martin was selected to give the nominating address for president to George H. W. Bush.

==Post political career==
From 1993 to 1999, Martin was a professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, and chair of the Council for the Advancement of Women and advisor to the firm of Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP, for Deloitte&#x27;s internal human resources and minority advancement matters. She was briefly a fellow at Harvard University&#x27;s Kennedy School of Government.

In 1993, Martin was among the finalist to be named as Commissioner of Baseball, but the job ultimately went to Bud Selig.

In 1995, she tested the waters to run for the 1996 Republican presidential nomination, but decided against it after concluding there was insufficient support for her candidacy. She participated in a Republican primary debate in New Hampshire on local television. Arguably, she would have been the most viable woman to run for the Republican presidential nomination in history to that date.

Martin has been a director on the boards of AT&amp;T Corporation, Ryder System Inc., Dreyfus Funds, Constellation Energy Group and Procter &amp; Gamble. She served as chairman of the board of the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago.

She is briefly mentioned in &quot;The Loudest Voice&quot; for her connection to future Fox News executive Roger Ailes.

==Personal life==
She married John Martin in 1960 and the couple had two daughters. They divorced in 1978. Martin remarried in 1987 to Harry Leinenweber, a U.S. District Court Judge, who died in 2024. She has five stepchildren.

== Awards ==
Lynn Morley Martin was inducted as a laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State&#x27;s highest honor) by Illinois Governor George Ryan in 2000 in the area of government.

<doc id="1281323" wikidata="Q3875618" url="?curid=1281323" title="Newburgh, Fife">
<text>Newburgh is a royal burgh and parish in Fife, Scotland, at the south shore of the Firth of Tay. The town has a population of 2,171 (in 2011), which constitutes a 10% increase since 1901 when the population was counted at 1,904 persons.

The town has a long history of fishing and industrial heritage. Lindores Abbey lies at the eastern edge of the town.

==History==
In 1266 Newburgh was granted burgh status by King Alexander III, as a burgh belonging to the Abbot of Lindores. In 1600, Newburgh was given to Patrick Leslie, 1st Lord Lindores, son of the Earl of Rothes. In 1631, Newburgh was made a Royal Burgh by King Charles I.

Since the Second World War many new houses have been built in Newburgh but the population has only increased by about 10%, partly due to lower average occupancy rates.

For some time, Newburgh&#x27;s industries chiefly consisted of the making of linen, linoleum floorcloth, oilskin fabric and quarrying. There was for many years a net and coble fishery on the Firth Of Tay, mainly for salmon and sea trout.

The harbour area was used originally for boatbuilding and the transshipment of cargoes to Perth for vessels of over 200 tons. Raw materials for making linoleum such as cork and linseed oil were also imported at the &quot;Factory Pier&quot;. Aggregates from the Whin Stone quarry were also shipped from Bell&#x27;s Pier.

The main employer from the early 1920s was the linoleum factory known locally as the &quot;Tayside&quot;, operated by the Tayside Floorcloth Company. In the subsequent decades, Newburgh was a prosperous industrial town pulling in workers for the factories from surrounding towns and villages. As linoleum fell out of fashion in the late 1960s and 1970s, attempts were made to produce vinyl flooring and tiles but the factory was no longer profitable. After several changes in ownership it finally closed in 1980 after a large fire destroyed much of the building.

Situated to the East of the linoleum factory was another factory known locally as &quot;The Oilskin&quot;. Since before the First World War, its mostly female workers produced oilskin fabric for waterproof clothing such as fishermen&#x27;s suits and Sou&#x27;westers. The factory was taken over by textiles giant Courtaulds in the 1960s but it also closed some years later as demand for the product declined.

As of 2020, most industries in Newburgh have closed except for quarrying, which is now the town&#x27;s biggest single employer. It is mainly a dormitory town with many of those of working age commuting for work to Perth, Dundee, and Glenrothes. Local trades and services include a health centre, nursing home, and supermarket on the site of the former &quot;Ship Inn.&quot;

In 2017 a new whisky distillery opened on the site of Lindores Abbey at the east end of Newburgh. This produces Lindores Abbey whisky on the site where &quot;Aqua vitae&quot;—an early form of whisky—was produced by the monks. The distillery incorporates an event venue and offers catering and tours of the distillery and Abbey ruins.

After many years of lying derelict, the linoleum factory was demolished and cleared and its site is now a recreational waterfront linked to the Mugdrum Park and the Fife Coastal Path.

==Local structures==

===Town house===
Newburgh Town House was designed in the Italianate style, with a central tower and spire, and built on the south side of the High Street in 1808. It forms a continuous block with the other houses. The Laing Museum and Library was added to the north side of the street in 1894-96.

===Macduff&#x27;s Cross===
On high ground, about southwest of the town (at ) stand the remains of Macduff&#x27;s Cross, of which only the pedestal survives. In legend, it marks the spot where clan Macduff was granted rights of sanctuary and composition for murder, in return for its chief&#x27;s services against Macbeth.

===Denmylne Castle===

Denmylne Castle, about south-east of Newburgh on the Cupar road, was the home for more than 250 years of the Balfour of Denmylne family, of which the brother, James and Andrew were the most distinguished members. The castle was abandoned in 1772 when the estate was sold and now stands within a 19th-century steading whose construction will have necessitated the removal of the castle&#x27;s subsidiary buildings. It has been unroofed for at least 200 years and is in a state of disrepair. A lintel dated 1620 has been re-used in one of the steading&#x27;s building. It is a scheduled ancient monument.

===Lindores Abbey===

Lindores Abbey is situated near the Tay, on the East side of the town. Only fragments remain of the Tironensian (reformed Benedictine) abbey, founded about 1190 by David of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon, brother of William I the Lion. Nonetheless, the ground plan of the whole structure can still be traced. Best preserved are the south-west gateway through the precinct wall, various remains of the wall itself, and part of the east cloister range, including the still-vaulted slype, all built of local red sandstone. The monastic church itself had a single aisle on the north side, with aisled north and south transepts, a central tower and a detached western tower or campanile, similar to Cambuskenneth Abbey. It is a scheduled ancient monument.

The monks were noted agriculturists and oversaw famous orchards. Some houses in Newburgh&#x27;s High Street are said to have orchards with trees descended from the original plantings, although many plots have now been sold and developed for housing. Numerous architectural fragments from the Abbey are built into buildings in the town.

Lindores Abbey is also famous as the birthplace of Scotch Whisky owing to its links to Friar John Cor and the Exchequer Rolls of 1494. The Abbey is now home to the McKenzie Smith family and has been for 100 years. The site is being preserved, and saw a new distillery opened in 2017.

===Clatchard Craig Hill fort===
The multi-walled Pictish hill fort of Clatchard Craig once stood to the south of the town. Archeological excavations have shown that the fort was occupied between the sixth and eighth centuries AD, as a site of high status. The fort was destroyed by quarrying during the late twentieth century.

== Culture ==
Newburgh has been noted for its Christmas lights, which are designed by local children.

==Natural areas nearby==

Nearby Lochmill Loch has been dammed to provide the town with a water supply and fishing.

At Blackearnside, a forest of alders, to the east of the village, William Wallace defeated Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke in 1298.

Mugdrum Island, opposite the large Mugdrum estate from which it takes its name, (&quot;ridge of the pig[s]&quot; in Gaelic), is offshore in the Firth dividing it into &#x27;North Deep&#x27; and &#x27;South Deep&#x27; channels. For many years cattle were ferried over to the island for summer grazing, but this is no longer practised.

==Sport==
Newburgh is home to the football club Newburgh, who compete in the , and an active sailing club.

==Transportation==
Newburgh is situated on the Firth of Tay, northwest of Ladybank Junction alongside the Edinburgh to Aberdeen railway line (between Perth and Ladybank). Newburgh railway station served the town from 1848 to 1955. There is an active campaign to reopen the station. Fife Scottish (now Stagecoach in Fife) used to have a bus depot in the town at East Shore Road; however, this was closed in 1991. No buses are now based in Newburgh although the Perth to Glenrothes and Newburgh to St Andrews via Ladybank station services still serve the town.

The town lies on the A913.

<text>Prince Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino (22 September 1833 – 22 March 1913), was a Romanian politician and lawyer, one of the leading Conservative Party policymakers. Among his political posts were minister of public instruction in Romania, president of the chamber, and president of the senate. He twice served as the Prime Minister of Romania: between 23 April 1899 and 19 July 1900, and between 4 January 1906 and 24 March 1907. He resigned from office after failing to put down the large-scale peasants&#x27; revolt. He was the 20th Romanian politician to serve as Prime Minister.

The wealthy Cantacuzino was born into the aristocratic Cantacuzino family, of Phanariote origins. He built the Cantacuzino Palace of Bucharest and the Cantacuzino Castle of Bușteni. He was the father of Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino and Mihail G. Cantacuzino, as well as the father-in-law of Alexandrina Pallady-Cantacuzino.

The Hellenic Football Federation (HFF) was founded on 14 November 1926 by a decision of the three major Unions of the country: Athens, Piraeus and Thessaloniki. Its foundation marked the organization of Greek football in compliance with international standards. Since then, the HFF has grown into the biggest sports federation in Greece, as football in the country is regarded as the &quot;king of sports&quot; coming first in the preferences of sports fans.

The HFF is considered a private legal entity and a non-profit organization with registered offices in Athens. It is the only exclusively qualified body in Greece to represent the interests of Greek football and prohibits any political, religious or racial discrimination.

In 1927, the HFF became a member of FIFA and in 1954 became one of the first members of UEFA. Amongst its obligations as member of international sports bodies, the HFF accepts the statutes, regulations, directives and decisions issued by FIFA and UEFA. The HFF also has to ensure that they are accepted by all individuals and clubs in Greek football.

On 3 July 2006, FIFA ruled the HFF was failing to adhere to the principles of the FIFA statutes regarding FIFA&#x27;s political independence. Accordingly, the HFF was indefinitely suspended from international football. In response, Greek officials proposed a change in FIFA&#x27;s law. However, FIFA ruled it too constituted an interference of the government in matters that should be under the football federation&#x27;s jurisdiction. As such, FIFA concluded Greece would not be able to meet its 15 July 2006 deadline and should therefore be suspended until further notice. The suspension would have meant Greek clubs would not be allowed to participate in international competitions, and that the Greece national team would not be able to participate in international matches. There were also doubts cast over whether the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final will be played at Athens&#x27; Olympic Stadium as previously scheduled.

However, on 7 July 2006, the Greek government ratified a new version of the sports law, granting the HFF independence and therefore adherence to FIFA&#x27;s laws. FIFA announced the lifting of its ban that day, judging that the amendments adhered to FIFA and UEFA statutes. This allowed Greece to participate in UEFA Euro 2008 and also allowed Greek clubs to participate in European competitions.

On 11 December 2008, HFF president Vassilis Gagatsis resigned from his position after an eight-year tenure. New elections were held on 17 January 2009, making Giorgos Sarris the new president. However, Sarris&#x27; election was controversial, with reports claiming the election was not fair and that Olympiacos owner Evangelos Marinakis had allegedly using his power to help appoint Sarris.

In April 2013, the HFF announced its new partnership with Nike, which also became the official supplier of clothes and equipment for the Greece national team. On the eve of the announcement, Giorgos Sarris praised the new partnership hoping that &quot;it will contribute to the overall advancement of domestic football&quot;.

==Organisation==
===Organisational structure===
The structure of the HFF is pyramid shaped. It is based on 2,000,000 football players and 5,773 football clubs, 3,700 from which are actively participating in official competitions of every kind, which take place throughout the country, covering all ages. The clubs come under the 53 Regional Unions of Football Clubs. The professional competitions are being organized by the Professional League (Greek League). The HFF is the supreme football authority, the one that all the clubs and professional teams come under and forms the top of the pyramid.

The General Assembly, convening once a year, is actually the HFF parliament. It is the Assembly that, according to the Statutes, decides on everything about Greek football. They can change the Statutes and the regulations of the Federation, enforce new ones, audit the financial review for the previous fiscal year and the budget for the year to come, vote (every four years) and monitor the Administration&#x27;s work.

===Divisions===
The divisions of H.F.F. are: The Sporting Division, the Management Division, the Finance and Marketing Division, the International Relations Division, and the Press and Mass Media Division.

===Committees===
The operation of H.F.F. relies on the above-mentioned divisions that function on the responsibility of their respective managers, as much as, the Committees of the Executive Board, which, according to the Statutes of the Federation, are the following:

* The Appeal Committee
* The Financial Dispute Resolution Committee (second instance)
* The Central Referee&#x27;s Committee, which comprises three members and controls the entire referee field in Greece

== Controversies ==
=== Koriopolis ===

The incident first came to light after UEFA issued a report, which drew attention to 40 matches that were rigged in Greek football in the 2009–10 season. The initial probe into the incident involved approximately 80 individuals suspected of wrongdoing. Olympiacos owner Evangelos Marinakis was also accused of using his position in Greek football and special relationship with the president of the HFF, to appoint favorable referees to matches. Marinakis was later acquitted from all charges by the Prosecutor and the Council of Judges and the decision is final.

In February 2012, the Superleague Greece, with the agreement of the HFF, replaced the two football prosecutors (Fakos and Antonakakis) with two others (Petropoulos and Karras).

=== 2015 Greek football scandal ===
The 2015 Greek football scandal emerged on 6 April 2015 when prosecutor Aristidis Korreas&#x27; 173-page work was revealed. Telephone tapping operated by the National Intelligence Service of Greece since 2011 has played a significant role in the case. According to the prosecutor&#x27;s conclusion, Olympiacos owner Evangelos Marinakis along with HFF members Theodoros Kouridis and Georgios Sarris, were suspected of directing a criminal organization since 2011. The goal behind their scheme was allegedly to &quot;absolutely control Greek football&#x27;s fate by the methods of blackmailing and fraud&quot;, exploiting the self-governing (&quot;autonomy&quot;) status of national football federations promoted by FIFA and UEFA. In 2016, a temporary administration was placed by FIFA.
On 28 December 2017 a new president was elected Evangelos Grammenos with the support of Savvidis and Melissanidis.

On 28 January 2021, the three-member Criminal Court of Appeals acquitted the leader of Olympiacos, Vangelis Marinakis, of all the charges against him in the trial of 28. The same happened with all the defendants in the case. After a thorough analysis of all the elements of the investigation, from the testimony of the witnesses (and the contradictions they encountered) and from the rejection of the pre-investigation conclusion by the lawyers of the accused, the court decided to reject all the accusations.
A case that lasted almost six years and occupied Greek football, tarnishing reputations, has now been closed definitively and irrevocably.

===Other===
The HFF has also been subject to allegations of other crimes, including blackmail and tax evasion. In November 2013, a team of prosecutors raided the headquarters of the HFF to find evidence of illegal activity. There have been allegations some of the teams have failed to pay their taxes by submitting fake documents.

Since 2015, the HFF has also been under judicial investigation regarding the existence of a &quot;pyramid&#x27;s economic scheme&quot; in the Greek referees&#x27; society.

Giorgos Girzikis, ex-president of the HFF, is also under penal prosecution for three felony economic crimes.

In March 2019, the ex-presidents of HFF, Vasilis Gagatsis, Sofoklis Pilavios and Giorgos Girtzikis were found guilty by the Greek courts for economic crimes.

<text>Coria del Río is a small town near Seville, on the shores of the Guadalquivir river.

==History==
Early in the 17th century, &quot;daimyō&quot; Date Masamune of Sendai sent a delegation led by Hasekura Tsunenaga (1571–1622) to Europe. In 1613, Hasekura and the delegates visited the Spanish court of King Philip III and the Vatican. An embassy was established and six samurai stayed in Spain. Approximately 650 of Coria&#x27;s 24,000 residents, as reported in 2003, use the surname &quot;Japón&quot; (originally &quot;Hasekura de Japón&quot;), identifying them as the descendants of the first Japanese official envoy to Spain. The name first appeared on an official document in 1646. Some babies born within the town are known to display the mongolian spot which is common in Asians.

A statue of Hasekura Tsunenaga was donated to the city by Japan in 1992 and stands watch over the river.
The football club Coria CF hails from Coria del Río.

<doc id="1281335" wikidata="Q88131" url="?curid=1281335" title="Johanna Langefeld">
<text>Johanna Langefeld (née May; 5 March 1900, Kupferdreh, Germany – 26 January 1974) was a Nazi German guard and supervisor at three Nazi concentration camps: Lichtenburg, Ravensbrück, and Auschwitz. She was arrested and imprisoned for her role in the Holocaust, but she escaped prison and was never tried.

==Early life and Nazism==
Born in Kupferdreh (now Essen, Germany), Johanna May was brought up in a Lutheran, nationalistic family alongside a sister. She was named after a German heroine figure, Johanna Stegen. Her father was a blacksmith. Her parents instilled her and her sister with values of strict discipline and &quot;Kinder, Küche, Kirche&quot;.

In 1924, she moved to Mülheim and married Wilhelm Langefeld, who died in 1926 of lung disease. In 1928, Langefeld fell pregnant with another man, left him soon afterward, and moved to Düsseldorf, where her son, Herbert Langefeld, was born that August.

Langefeld was unemployed until age 34, when she began to teach domestic economy in an establishment of the city of Neuss. Satisfied to have a secure career inline with traditional gender roles, she became an adherent of Adolf Hitler partially because he preached that traditional gender roles would make Germany great again. From 1935 onwards, she worked as a guard in a so-called Arbeitsanstalt (working institution) in Brauweiler Abbey, which was a prison for prostitutes, unemployed and homeless women, and other so called &quot;antisocial&quot; women, who were then later imprisoned in concentration camps. Langefeld did not join the Nazi Party until 1937, when the Brauweiler director fired her for resistance to his authority, which included her lack of party membership.

==Nazi concentration camps==

In March 1938, Langefeld applied for a job as a camp guard in the first &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) concentration camp for women in Lichtenburg. After one year, she became the female superintendent of this camp, where she stayed until the camp population was transferred to Ravensbrück in May 1939. There, she clashed with camp director Max Koegel, who she believed incompetent and whose job she wanted for herself. While Koegel preferred to keep discipline through beatings, Langefeld believed emphasizing strict protocol was the superior method for controlling female prisoners. Her power struggle with him led her to recruit Blockova loyal only to her to help maintain control of the prisoner population. When Koegel entreated Heinrich Himmler to authorize the use of a wooden horse to aid in beatings, Langefeld protested to no avail. This escalation of punishment led to her developing a guilty conscience, but she did not cease her Nazi activities.

She was in charge of the selections in Ravensbrück during the so-called &quot;14f13” murder campaign. In March 1942, Langefeld was assigned to build a new women&#x27;s camp in Auschwitz. There, she selected prisoners for death in the gas chamber.

Rudolf Höss, the Commandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp, recalled his contact with Johanna Langefeld as follows:The chief female supervisor of the period, Frau Langefeld, was in no way capable of coping with the situation, yet she refused to accept any instructions given to her by the leader of the protective custody camp. Acting on my own initiative, I simply put the women&#x27;s camp under his jurisdiction.

During the visit of Himmler on 18 July 1942, Langefeld tried to get him to annul this order. In fact, Rudolf Höss admitted after the war that “the Reichsführer SS absolutely refused” his order and that he wished “a women&#x27;s camp to be commanded by a woman”. Himmler ordered that Langefeld should stay in charge of the women&#x27;s camp and that in the future, no SS man should enter the female camp.

That month, the Auschwitz women&#x27;s camp was moved to Auschwitz-Birkenau camp three km away. Two weeks later, Langefeld sustained an injury of her meniscus and required a cartilage operation in the Hohenlychen SS Sanatorium near Ravensbrück. During her stay there, she went to see Oswald Pohl, the chief of the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office, in Berlin-Lichterfelde, and convinced him to transfer her back to Ravensbrück.

Maria Mandl became the new Oberaufseherin of the women&#x27;s prisoner camp in Auschwitz. Oswald Pohl instructed the Chief of Department D of his SS Main Economic and Administrative Office, Richard Glücks, to order that duties of protective custody camp leaders in the Women&#x27;s Camps be executed thereafter by the female superintendents, the Oberaufseherinnen.

Margarete Buber-Neumann, who became Langefeld&#x27;s prisoner assistant in Ravensbrück, recorded that Langefeld was dismissed for excessive sympathy with Polish prisoners; she was separated from her son, taken under arrest to Breslau, where an SS tribunal prepared a trial against her. Langefeld never went to trial, and was released from her camp duties. She then moved to Munich and started to work for BMW.

==Trial, later life and death==
On 20 December 1945, Langefeld was arrested by the U.S. Army, and in September 1946, was extradited to the Polish judiciary preparing a trial in Kraków against SS personnel in Auschwitz. On 23 December 1946, she escaped from prison. Given her prior relatively positive treatment of inmates in this German Nazi concentration camp located on occupied Polish soil, the escape was assisted by Polish staff of the prison where she was held. After the escape she hid in a convent, working in a private home. Sometime around 1957, she returned illegally to live with her sister in Munich. During 1957, she tracked down Buber-Neumann to her home in Frankfurt to apologize in hopes of absolution. At this point, she was missing multiple teeth. She died in Augsburg, Germany on 26 January 1974, aged 73. 

==Personality and brutality ==
Langefeld had a complicated view of contemporary German gender roles. Though she was raised with the belief women should be subordinate to men and was attracted to Hitler for his endorsement of such ideas, she also pushed against patriarchal relationships in her professional life. She strongly believed her life would have been better had she been born male. Growing up, she idolized Eleonore Prochaska, a historical German woman who dressed as a man to fight in the War of the Sixth Coalition.

Though she held some degree of sympathy toward the prisoners under her charge and believed herself to have had a connection with Buber-Neumann, she was also passionately antisemitic. She visibly scowled when looking at Jewish prisoners (a former Ravensbrück prisoner recalled that “her face would fill with hatred”) and never complained about the killing of Jews in the Holocaust. She hated Koegel&#x27;s disciplinary methods of long, gratuitous beatings, but her own methods were also violent: imposing strict rules either impossible to obey or resulting in long periods of discomfort and having guards kick and slap prisoners for infractions to keep them constantly on their toes. Langefeld herself would sometimes slap prisoners for emphasis. However, she never struck prisoners out of anger.

<text>Constantin Angelescu (10 June 1869 – 14 September 1948) was a Romanian politician who served as ad interim/acting Prime Minister of Romania for five days, between 30 December 1933 and 3 January 1934.

He was: Doctor of Medicine in Paris, Plenipotentiary Minister in the United States (1917–1918), Minister of Public Works and Communications, of the Instruction and Cults several times, Prime Minister after the death of I.G. Duca, professor and director of the surgical clinic at the Faculty of Medicine in Bucharest.

==Early years==
Constantin Angelescu was born in 1869 in the family of Dumitru Angelescu (father), a merchant from Craiova, and of Theodore (mother), maiden name Geblescu, whose family was related to the Craiovești family. After the years of education at Obedeanu primary school and at Carol I National College, he studied medicine in Paris. In 1897, in France, he has had his specialization in surgery. He came back to the country, worked in surgery department of , then, at the , becoming professor (1903) and director of the University of Surgery Clinic. By marrying Virginia Constantinescu-Monteoru, the daughter of millionaire , he became the owner of the Sărata Monteoru spas, some of petroleum land and real estate in the Buzău area.

==Political activity==
Dr. Angelescu started his political career within the National Liberal Party. 
In 1901, Angelescu became an MP and senator, and later, the minister of public works (1914–1916) and minister of public guidance. As Minister of Public Works in the Government of Ion I. C. Brătianu, he was especially charged with the organization of the Romanian military service, with Romania&#x27;s entry into World War I. The supporter for the accession to the Triple Entente caused the annoyance of the prime minister who had dismissed him during the establishing of the national union coalition. In 1917, during the evacuation of the government and king to Iași, Angelescu lived for a short time in Odesa, and then returned to the country. In January–March 1918 he was appointed as Romania&#x27;s first plenipotentiary minister in Washington, D.C. Then in 1918, he was the Deputy Chairman of the National Council for Romanian Unity established by Take Ionescu in Paris.

Later he was the Minister of Public Guidance in Governments chaired by Ion I.C. Bratianu, and then by Ion G. Duca, during which he made important reforms of modernizing education in Romania, as a continuation of those launched in the previous century and in the beginning of the 20th century by his mentor and uncle, within the alliance, Spiru Haret. His motto was: &quot;School as much as possible! School as good as possible! School as Romanian as possible!&quot; The constitutional text on education, as it was formulated on March 29, 1923 was based on the principles of freedom of education, compulsory primary education and free primary education. He contributed to the adoption of the Law on the state primary education and of the normal-primary education of June 26, 1924, to the uniformity of the education system in Romania. In 1925, he reestablished baccalaureate examinations.

Over time, relations with Ion I.C. Bratianu improved, and Dr. Angelescu was next to him in the moments after the assassination attempt in 1904 and in the last hours of his life in 1927, when he closely supervised the medical-surgical treatment he had given.

After the assassination of Prime Minister Ion G. Duca, he was for four days interim prime minister, forced to give way to Gheorghe Tătărescu. He eventually accepted to be the minister of national education in the cabinet headed by Tatarescu.

In 1938–1940, during the royal dictatorship of Carol II of Romania, Dr. Angelescu served as State Secretary (in the government chaired by Patriarch Miron of Romania) and then a royal counselor. He is one of the members of the Crown Council chaired by Carol II who voted for the cession of Bessarabia and northern Bucovina to the Soviet Union following the ultimatum given to Romania on June 26, 1940. Together with Dinu Brătianu, he was against the Second Vienna Award.

Over 24 years, Dr. Constantin Angelescu was the president of the Romanian Athenaeum (1923–1947), and between 1941–1947 he was president of the Cultural League.

On 24 May 1934 he was elected honorary member of the Romanian Academy.

He was a founding member of the Romanian Academy of Sciences.

According to some sources, in 1943, together with Dr. Nicolae Lupu, he proposed to re-establish the right of the Jews to free practice, as it had been taken by the Antisemitism legislation of 1940.

In September 1948 he died at the French hospital Vincent de Paul in Bucharest. Death freed him from arrest and detention in communist prisons.

==The family==
He had three daughters: Elizabeth, Ioana, and Elena, and three sons: Grigore, Alexander, and Constantine. His daughter, Elisabeth Angelescu, married mathematician Alexandru Ghika; their son, Grigore Ghika, became a physicist. His daughter Ioana (Jeanne) Angelescu married Ștefan Ghika–Budești, geologist, correspondent member of the Romanian Academy, the son of the architect Nicolae Ghika-Budești. And his third daughter, Elena, was married to diplomat George Valimărescu. His son, Constantin C. Angelescu Monteoru (1905–2000), was a professor of constitutional law, dean of the law faculty at the University of Iași. In the years of Stalinist repression, he was deported to the Danube–Black Sea Canal. His daughter, Ioana Angelescu, employed by Radio Free Europe, married George Angelescu, a musician.

==In memoriam==
* The interdepartamental hospital &quot;Alexandru Sahia&quot; of Bucharest has been renamed into &quot;Dr. Constantin Angelescu&quot;.
* A theoretical high school in Bucharest and the college in Buzău were named in honor of Constantin Angelescu.
* His family set up a foundation called the Romanian School of Constantin Angelescu

<text>There are three major types of submarines in the United States Navy: ballistic missile submarines, attack submarines, and cruise missile submarines. All submarines currently in the U.S. Navy are nuclear-powered. Ballistic missile submarines have a single strategic mission of carrying nuclear submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Attack submarines have several tactical missions, including sinking ships and subs, launching cruise missiles, and gathering intelligence. Cruise missile submarines perform many of the same missions as attack submarines, but with a focus on their ability to carry and launch larger quantities of cruise missiles than typical attack submarines.

The submarine has a long history in the United States, beginning with the &quot;Turtle&quot;, the world&#x27;s first submersible with a documented record of use in combat.

== History ==
=== Early history (1775–1914) ===
The first submarine used in combat was the &quot;USS Turtle&quot;. The &quot;Turtle&quot; was built in 1775 and was made to attach explosive charges to the hulls of the ships. Several attempts were made against British ships in American harbors in 1776, but none were successful. 

Other submersible projects date to the 19th century. &quot;Alligator&quot; was a US Navy submarine that was never commissioned. She was being towed to South Carolina to be used in taking Charleston, but was lost in bad weather on 2 April 1863 off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. On February 17, 1864, the H. L. Hunley (submarine) became the first submarine to sink a warship.

Real progress began late in the century with the building of the , named after John Philip Holland. The USS Holland was the first submarine in the US Navy, commissioned on April 1, 1900. Submarines have been active component of the US Navy ever since. The boat was developed at Lewis Nixon&#x27;s Crescent Shipyard located in Elizabeth, New Jersey. This pioneering craft was in service for 10 years and was a developmental and trials vessel for many systems on other early submarines.

Later submarines were given such names as Grampus, Salmon, and Porpoise, but were also named for venomous and stinging creatures, such as Adder, Tarantula, and Viper. Submarines were renamed in 1911 and carried alphanumeric names such as A-1, C-1, H-3, and L-7. In 1920 the U.S. Navy Department established a standard Type and Class letter designation system. &quot;SS&quot; was established as the two-letter class designation for Submarine (first line). In addition to a name, each U.S. submarine carries a Class designation followed by an assigned hull number. Note that &quot;SS&quot; is not an acronym for &#x27;Submersible Ship&#x27;; Warship classifications for U.S. submarines include &quot;SSN&quot;, Submarine (nuclear-powered); &quot;SSBN&quot;, Ballistic Missile Submarine (nuclear-powered), and &quot;SSGN&quot;, Guided Missile Submarine (nuclear-powered).

=== World War I and the inter-war years (1914–1941) ===

The submarine truly came of age in World War I. The US Navy did not have a large part in this war, with action mainly being confined to escorting convoys later in the war and sending a division of battleships to reinforce the British Grand Fleet. However, there were those in the submarine service who saw what the Germans had done with their U-boats and took careful note.

=== World War II (1941–1945) ===


Doctrine in the inter-war years emphasized the submarine as a scout for the battle fleet, and also extreme caution in command. Both these axioms were proven wrong after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. The submarine skippers of the fleet boats of World War II waged a very effective campaign against Japanese merchant vessels, eventually repeating and surpassing Germany&#x27;s initial success during the Battle of the Atlantic against the United Kingdom.

==== Offensive against Japanese ships ====
During the war, submarines of the United States Navy were responsible for 55% of Japan&#x27;s merchant marine losses; other Allied navies added to the toll. The war against shipping was the single most decisive factor in the collapse of the Japanese economy.

The Navy adopted an official policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, and it appears the policy was executed without the knowledge or prior consent of the government. The London Naval Treaty, to which the U.S. was signatory, required submarines to abide by prize rules (commonly known as &quot;cruiser rules&quot;). It did not prohibit arming merchantmen, but arming them, or having them report contact with submarines (or raiders), made them &quot;de facto&quot; naval auxiliaries and removed the protection of the cruiser rules. This made restrictions on submarines effectively moot. U.S. Navy submarines also conducted reconnaissance patrols, landed special forces and guerrilla troops and performed search and rescue tasks.

In addition to sinking Japanese merchant ships, postwar records compiled by the Joint Army-Navy Assessment Committee indicate Japan lost 686 warships of 500 gross tons (GRT) or larger to submarines during 1,600 war patrols. Only 1.6 percent of the total U.S. naval manpower was responsible for America&#x27;s success on its Pacific high seas; more than half of the total tonnage sunk was credited to U.S. submarines. The tremendous accomplishments of American submarines were achieved at the expense of 52 subs with 374 officers and 3,131 enlisted volunteers lost during combat against Japan; Japan lost 128 submarines during the Second World War in Pacific waters. American casualty counts represent 16 percent of the U.S. operational submarine officer corps and 13 percent of its enlisted force.

==== Lifeguard League ====

In addition to their commerce raiding role, submarines also proved valuable in air-sea rescue. While in command of United States Navy aircraft carrier task force 50.1 Rear Admiral Charles Alan Pownall, proposed to Admiral Charles A. Lockwood (commander of Pacific Fleet Submarine Force) that submarines be stationed near targeted islands during aerial attacks. In what became known as the &quot;Lifeboat League&quot;, pilots were informed that they could ditch their damaged planes near these submarines (or bail out nearby) and be rescued by them. Eventually the rescue of downed American pilots became the second most important submarine mission after the destruction of Japanese shipping. Initially, the rescue submarines met several obstacles, most important of which was the lack of communication between the submarines and aircraft in the area; this led to several Lifeguard League submarines being bombed or strafed, possibly including the sinking of and by American planes.

As fighting in the Pacific theater intensified and broadened in geographic scope, the eventual creation of Standing Operating Procedure (SOP TWO) led to several improvements such as the assignment of nearby submarines before air attacks, and the institution of reference points to allow pilots to report their location in the clear.
After the capture of the Marianas, targets such as Tokyo, about 1,500 mi (2,400 km) north of the Marianas, were brought within range of B-29 attacks and Lifeguard League submarines began rescue operations along their flight paths.
Submarine lifeguards spent a combined 3,272 days on rescue duty and rescued 502 men. Famous examples include the rescue of 22 airmen by the , and the rescue of future U.S. President George H. W. Bush by the .

=== Cold War (1945–1991) ===
After WWII, things continued along much the same path until the early 1950s. Then, a revolution that was to forever change the nature of the submarine arm occurred. That revolution was .

==== Towards the &quot;Nuclear Navy&quot; ====

The was the first nuclear-powered submarine. &quot;Nautilus&quot; put to sea for the first time on 17 January 1955, transmitting the historic message, &quot;Under way on nuclear power.&quot; Up until that point, submarines had been torpedo boats tied to the surface by the need to charge their batteries using diesel engines relatively often. The nuclear power plant of the &quot;Nautilus&quot; meant that the boat could stay underwater for literally months at a time, the only operational limit being the amount of food that the boat could carry. With resupply by mini-subs, even this could be overcome. The final limits would be for replacing equipment that wears out, the fatigue limit of the hull, and crew morale.

==== Strategic deterrence ====
Another revolution in submarine warfare came with . Nuclear-powered like , the &quot;George Washington&quot; added strategic ballistic missiles making the nuclear triad. Earlier Regulus missile submarines were diesel powered. Their cruise missiles required the boat to surface in order to fire, and were vulnerable to air defenses in an era when there were no anti-ballistic missiles.
&quot;George Washington&quot;″s missiles could be fired while the boat was submerged, meaning that it was far less likely to be detected before firing. The nuclear power of the boat also meant that, like &quot;Nautilus&quot;, &quot;George Washington&quot;″s patrol length was limited only by the amount of food the boat could carry. Ballistic missile submarines, carrying Polaris missiles, eventually superseded all other strategic nuclear systems in the Navy. Deterrent patrols continue to this day, although now with s and Trident II missiles.

The United States lost two nuclear submarines during the Cold War: due to equipment failure during a test dive while at its operational limit, and due to unknown causes.

=== Post–Cold War (1991–present) ===
Given the lack of large scale conventional naval warfare since 1945, with the USN&#x27;s role being primarily that of power projection, the submarine service did not for very many years. The BGM-109 Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) was developed to give naval vessels a long range land attack capability other than direct shore bombardment and strikes by aircraft flying off carriers. Submarines fitted with the Tomahawk could hit targets up to 1,000 miles inland. The mainstay of the Tomahawk equipped vessels in the early days of the missile&#x27;s deployment were the , and the submarine fleet. 

The Tomahawk was first used in combat on 17 January 1991, on the opening night of Operation Desert Storm. On that day, for the first time since the surrender of Japan in 1945, an American submarine fired in combat, when 12 Tomahawks were launched by U.S. boats in the eastern Mediterranean. Since then, the Tomahawk has become a staple of American campaigns, seeing use in three wars. It has also been exported to the United Kingdom, which has also fitted it to submarines. The use of the Tomahawk has seen a change in the design of attack submarines. The Tomahawk can be fired through 21-inch torpedo tubes, but the and s since have been fitted with vertical launch systems to enable them to carry more of the weapons.

With the decommissioning of the final &quot;Barbel&quot;-class diesel-electric submarine in 1990, this meant that the USN submarine fleet is made up entirely of nuclear-powered vessels; each submarine possesses one nuclear reactor, which powers propulsion and all shipboard equipment.

== Composition of the current force ==
=== Fast attack submarines ===

The U.S. currently operates three classes of fast attack submarine: the , , and es. There are 34 &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarines on active duty and 28 retired which makes it the most numerous nuclear-powered submarine class in the world. &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarines are named after U.S. cities breaking with a U.S. Navy tradition of naming attack submarines after sea creatures. The naming is an exception in this class. returned to the use of sea creatures as names, but the second and final ships of the &quot;Seawolf&quot;-class, and , were named for a U.S. state and a U.S. president, respectively. Ships from the &quot;Virginia&quot;-class except for are named after U.S. states, a convention traditionally reserved for battleships and nuclear missile submarines.

The final 23 boats in the &quot;Los Angeles&quot; class, referred to as &quot;688i&quot; boats, are quieter than their predecessors and incorporate a more advanced combat system. The 688i boats are also designed for under-ice operations. Their diving planes are on the bow rather than on the sail and they have reinforced sails.

=== Ballistic and guided missile submarines ===
The U.S. has 18 &quot;Ohio&quot;-class submarines, of which 14 are Trident II ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), each capable of carrying 24 submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), although to comply with the START II treaty, 4 of the missile launch tubes have been disabled. The first four Ohio-class submarines, which were originally equipped with the older Trident I missiles, have been converted to cruise missile submarines (SSGNs), each capable of carrying 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles and have been further equipped to support Special Operations (SEALS). If the maximum of 154 Tomahawk missiles were loaded, one &quot;Ohio&quot;-class SSGN would carry an entire Battle Group&#x27;s equivalent of cruise missiles. Ballistic missile submarines (&quot;boomers&quot; in American slang) carry SLBMs with nuclear warheads for attacking strategic targets such as cities or missile silos anywhere in the world. They are currently universally nuclear-powered to provide the greatest stealth and endurance. They played an important part in Cold War mutual deterrence, as both the United States and the Soviet Union had the credible ability to conduct a retaliatory strike against the other nation in the event of a first strike. This comprised an important part of the strategy of Mutual Assured Destruction.

In order to comply with arms reduction against the START II treaty, the U.S. Navy modified the four oldest &quot;Ohio&quot;-class Trident submarines (, , , and ) to SSGN configuration. The conversion was achieved by installing vertical launching systems (VLS) in a configuration dubbed &quot;multiple all-up-round canister (MAC).&quot; This system was installed in 22 of the 24 missile tubes, replacing one large nuclear strategic ballistic missile with 7 smaller Tomahawk cruise missiles. The 2 remaining tubes were converted to lockout chambers (LOC) to be used by special forces personnel who can be carried on board. This gives each converted sub the capability to carry up to 154 Tomahawk missiles. The MAC tubes can also be used to carry and launch UAVs or UUVs which give the ship remote controlled &quot;eyes &amp; ears&quot; allowing the ship to act as a forward-deployed command &amp; control center.

The &quot;boomers&quot; were named for patriots, and together with the , , , and es, these SSBNs comprised the Cold War-era &quot;41 for Freedom.&quot; Later &quot;Ohio&quot;-class submarines were named for states (recognizing the increase in striking power and importance once bestowed upon battleships), with the exception of , which was named for United States Senator Henry M. &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson (1912–1983) of Washington upon his death while in office (1983). This honor was in recognition of his advocacy on behalf of the nuclear submarine program. He strongly supported the rapid development of nuclear submarines and especially the development of an SSBN program. Senator Jackson also called for the establishment of a Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Undersea Warfare because he believed submarines were &quot;lost in a welter of naval bureaucracy.&quot;

== Personnel ==
U.S. Navy submarines are manned solely by volunteers from within the Navy. Because of the stressful environment aboard submarines, personnel are accepted only after rigorous testing and observation; as a consequence, submariners have significantly lower mental hospitalization rates than surface ship personnel. Furthermore, submariners receive submarine duty incentive pay (SUBPAY) in addition to sea pay.

Some 5,000 officers and 55,000 enlisted sailors make up the submarine force. In addition to submarines, they are assigned to submarine tenders, submarine rescue ships, deep-diving submersibles, floating dry docks, shore support facilities, submarine staffs, and senior command staffs.

Until 2014, submarine watchkeeping had an 18-hour day, as opposed to a standard 24-hour schedule. Sailors spent 6 hours on watch, 6 hours maintenance and training and 6 hours off (3 watches of 6 hours.) In 2014, the Navy began transitioning the fleet to a 24-hour schedule.

The submarine force has always been a small fraction of the active Navy. During World War II all submariners (including the rear echelon) accounted for less than two percent of Navy personnel, but accounted for 55 percent of Japan&#x27;s merchant marine losses. In 1998 only about seven percent of the Navy&#x27;s people were submariners, though they operated one-third of the Navy&#x27;s warships.

=== Training ===
After acceptance into the submarine program, candidates undergo a demanding training schedule, which includes attendance by all Officers and non-nuclear trained enlisted personnel at the U.S. Naval Submarine School New London, located within the Naval Submarine Base New London, in Groton, Connecticut, (NAVSUBSCOL at SUBASENLON) as well as rigorous technical training in different specialty areas. Officer and enlisted engineering staff have their own advanced training at Nuclear Power School in Charleston, South Carolina, then nuclear prototype training at various locations.
Besides their academic and technical training, much of which is Classified Secret or Top Secret, all prospective US Naval Submariners, both officers and enlisted personnel, undergo 3 phases of physical training and testing related to the intense pressure differential between the surface and submarine operating depth.

==== Pressure training ====
Pressure training is conducted in a 2-day course including classroom and lab training:

The first test is for the ability to perform the Valsalva maneuver, named for Antonio Maria Valsalva. If a submarine training candidate cannot perform the Valsalva maneuver under doctor&#x27;s supervision at normal atmospheric pressure, that candidate is not rejected as &quot;unfit for submarine service&quot; but may not continue the high risk pressure training as follows.

In the second phase of testing, called &quot;Pressure Testing&quot;, candidates who have successfully performed the Valsalva maneuver will be subjected to increased ambient pressure. This test is performed under the supervision of a diving-certified medical doctor. All testees enter a pressure chamber, accompanied by the doctor, and the &#x27;tank&#x27; is sealed. Typically, there is in the chamber a somewhat surprising object: an inflated volleyball, water polo ball or similar inflated ball. Upon sealing the tank, pressure is increased, while the testees equalise their eardrum pressure. (if any testee is unable to &#x27;Valsalva&#x27;, the test stops, and pressure is slowly released.) Pressure builds within the chamber until the chamber is equal to water pressure at &quot;escape depth&quot;. At this point, the chamber feels very warm and dry, and the volleyball has become compressed enough that it has become the shape of a bowl, and appears to have been emptied of air, due to the greatly increased air pressure inside of the tank. Sounds inside the tank at pressure sound as if they are &quot;far away&quot;.

During the controlled release of pressure from the tank, the air in the chamber becomes quite chilled and a fog forms in the chamber, often precipitating as a sort of dew. (See adiabatic expansion) Once pressure is fully released, the candidates are examined with an otoscope to check for ruptured eardrums. Candidates with ruptured eardrums are removed from the testing cycle until healed, depending on the severity of the injury.

==== Escape training ====

The third phase of testing for submarine fitness is escape training, utilizing the &quot;Steinke hood submarine escape appliance&quot;, or colloquially known as the Steinke hood or, more familiarly, as &quot;Stinky hood&quot;. This is a device with a transparent front that essentially covers the head and shoulders during ascent from a stranded submarine, allowing air to escape during ascent, which is necessary as the expanding air in the lungs would otherwise cause disastrous injury. Actual training with the Steinke Hood is done in a Submarine Escape Training Tower to simulate a submarine stranded on the floor of the sea bed.

The escape testing proceeds as in the pressure test, except that this time, a hatch in the floor of the pressure chamber is opened. The chamber immediately adjoins a cylindrical tower full of water, tall enough to simulate the depth of a stranded submarine. Because the air pressure inside the chamber is equal to the pressure of the water in the tower, the water does not enter the chamber.

Donning the Steinke hood, the test subject enters the water and immediately commences a rapid ascent, due to the buoyancy of the escape device. As they ascend, each test subject must allow the air in his lungs to escape, this is facilitated by yelling as loudly as possible. Typically they are told to yell &quot;HO HO HO&quot; repeatedly. If one does not forcefully and continuously expel air from the lungs in this manner, they may be gravely injured or killed. The air exiting the lungs is allowed to exit the hood through a set of two one-way valves, keeping the device inflated but not over-inflated. Upon reaching the top, the test subject swims to the side, climbs up, removes his Steinke Hood, deflates it, stands at parade rest, and yells &quot;I FEEL FINE&quot;, while a corpsman examines the subject.

Successfully completing the escape training requires two trials, one of them at double the depth of the first. On completion of escape training, subjects are now considered &quot;bubbleheads&quot;.

, the Steinke Hood has been replaced with the Mark 10 Submarine Escape Immersion Equipment (SEIE) suit. The Mark 10 allows submariners to escape from deeper depths than possible with the Steinke Hood, i.e., 600 feet vs. 400 feet.

The Mark 8 SEIE, predecessor to the Mark 10, was a double layer suit which gave the wearer the appearance of a Michelin Man. One layer was eliminated, and the fabric was used to build a life raft that would fit in the same package that the original suit came in.

Because it is a full body suit, the Mark 10 provides thermal protection once the wearer reaches the surface, and the British Royal Navy has successfully tested it at six hundred foot depths.

The navies of twenty-two nations currently use SEIE units of some type.

=== Insignia ===

==== Submarine Insignia ====

Further training and qualification at sea are required before submariners are awarded the coveted Submarines insignia (&quot;dolphins&quot; or &quot;fish&quot;) – the submarine insignia worn by officers (gold) and enlisted personnel (silver) to demonstrate their achievement.

The insignia of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Submarine Service is a submarine flanked by two stylized dolphins named Castor and Pollux.

The origin of this insignia dates back to June 1923, when Captain Ernest King, USN, Commander, Submarine Division Three (later Fleet Admiral and Chief of Naval Operations), suggested to the Secretary of the Navy that a device for qualified submariners be adopted. He submitted a pen-and-ink sketch as an example. A Philadelphia firm, Bailey, Banks and Biddle, was requested to design a suitable badge. In 1928, a member of that firm told Ensign William C. Eddy that they were looking for a design. Eddy, using sketches of the 1926 Naval Academy class crest that he had designed, presented the submarine insignia which is used to this day.

In 1941 the Uniform Regulations were modified to permit officers and enlisted men to wear the submarine insignia after they had been assigned to other duties in the naval service, unless such right had been revoked. The officer insignia was a bronze gold-plated metal pin, worn centered above the left breast pocket and above the ribbons or medals. Enlisted men wore an embroidered silk insignia on the outside of the right sleeve, midway between the wrist and elbow until 1947 when it was shifted to above the left breast pocket. In 1943 the Uniform Regulations were modified to allow enlisted men, who were qualified for submarine duty then subsequently promoted to commissioned or warrant ranks, to continue wearing the enlisted submarine insignia until they qualified as submarine officers when they were entitled to wear the officers submarine pin. A 1950 change to Uniform Regulations authorized the embroidered insignia for officers (in addition to pin-on insignia) and a bronze, silver-plated, pin-on insignia for enlisted men (in addition to the embroidered device).

==== Other insignia ====
In addition to the Submarine Warfare insignia there are several special insignia. Since 1943 the Submarine Medical insignia has been awarded to medical officers of the Navy Medical Corps qualified in submarine warfare and medical expertise. The Submarine Engineering Duty insignia is issued to Engineering Duty Officers who have been designated as qualified in submarines through a program administered by the Naval Sea Systems Command and was first awarded in 1950. The Submarine Supply Corps insignia has been awarded to members of the Navy Supply Corps who have qualified as Supply Officers on board U.S. submarines since 1963.

Following the tradition of the World War II patrol pin, the silver SSBN Deterrent Patrol insignia is worn by both officer and enlisted members of SSBN crews in recognition of their sacrifice and hard work in completing strategic patrols. The badge depicts a with superimposed Polaris missiles, below which is a scroll with slots for up to six stars. One gold star marks each patrol completed. A silver star marks five patrols. Upon completion of 20 patrols, a gold patrol pin is authorized.

==== Unofficial insignia ====
The person on active duty, officer or enlisted, with the most deterrent patrols is presented with the Neptune Award. That person retains the award until someone else attains more patrols than the current holder or until he retires and it goes to the member with the next highest number of patrols.

=== Submarine verse of the Navy Hymn ===
Two sets of lyrics for the Submarine verse of the Navy Hymn have been written. The Reverend Gale Williamson wrote the following verse, which is generally associated with ballistic missile patrols:

:Bless those who serve beneath the deep,
:Through lonely hours their vigil keep.
:May peace their mission ever be,
:Protect each one we ask of thee.
:Bless those at home who wait and pray,
:For their return by night or day.

In 1965, David Miller composed the following lyrics, which are used for submariners and divers:

:Lord God, our power evermore,
:Whose arm doth reach the ocean floor,
:Dive with our men beneath the sea;
:Traverse the depths protectively.
:O hear us when we pray, and keep
:Them safe from peril in the deep.

<text>The tiple (, literally or soprano), is a plucked typically 10-string or 12-string chordophone of the guitar family, actually several instruments that share the name. A tiple player is called a &quot;tiplista&quot;. The first mention of the tiple comes from musicologist Pablo Minguet e Irol in 1752. Although many variations of the instrument exist, the 12-string tiple of Colombia is considered the national instrument. The Puerto Rican tiple characteristically has fewer strings, as do variants from Cuba, Mallorca, and North America.

==Tiple family==

===Colombian tiple===
The Colombian tiple (in Spanish: &quot;tiple&quot;) is an instrument of the guitar family, similar in appearance although slightly smaller (about 18%) than a standard classical guitar. The typical fretboard scale is about 530 mm (just under 21 inches), and the neck joins the body at the 12th fret. There are 12 strings, grouped in four tripled courses. Traditional tuning from lowest to highest course is C E A D, although many modern players tune the instrument like the upper four strings of the modern guitar: D G B E. The outer two strings of each of the three lowest triple courses are tuned an octave higher than the middle string in the course (giving C4 C3 C4 • E4 E3 E4 • A4 A3 A4 • D4 D4 D4 in traditional tuning, or D4 D3 D4 • G4 G3 G4 • B4 B3 B4 • E4 E4 E4 in modern tuning). An 18 or 19 fret fingerboard give the tiple Colombiano a range of about 2-2/3 octaves, from C3 - G#5 (or A5). The tiple is used for many traditional Colombian music genres including bambucos and pasillos. It serves both as an accompanying instrument and for soloing. One of the main composers of tiple music is Pacho Benavides.

David Pelham says of the Colombian tiple: &quot;The tiple is a Colombian adaptation of the Renaissance Spanish vihuela brought to the New World in the 16th century by the Spanish conquistadors. At the end of the 19th century, it evolved to its present shape. Its twelve strings are arranged in four groups of three: the first group consists of three steel strings tuned to E, the second, third and fourth groups have a copper string in the middle of two steel strings. The central ones are tuned one octave lower than the surrounding strings of the group. This arrangement produces the set of harmonics that gives the instrument its unique voice. Outside of Colombia the &quot;copper&quot; strings are more often standard brass or bronze wound steel guitar strings.

Another variant, the tiple Colombiano requinto, is often simply called tiple requinto. This instrument is about 10-15% smaller than the tiple Colombiano, and the central octave strings of the smaller instrument are tuned in unison, giving either a C4 C4 C4 • E4 E4 E4 • A4 A4 A4 • D4 D4 D4 tuning (traditional), or a D4 D4 D4 • G4 G4 G4 • B4 B4 B4 • E4 E4 E4 tuning (modern). The tiple requinto is sometimes made in more of a violin or &quot;hourglass&quot; shape, than a guitar shape. These differences give it a generally thinner, higher-pitched sound than the tiple Colombiano, even though most of its tuning is in the same range as the larger instrument.

===Puerto Rican tiples===

The tiple is the smallest of the three string instruments of Puerto Rico that make up the &quot;orquesta jibara&quot; (i.e., the Cuatro, the tiple and the Bordonua). According to investigations made by Jose Reyes Zamora, the tiple in Puerto Rico dates back to the 18th century. It is believed to have evolved from the Spanish guitarrillo. There was never a standard for the tiple and as a result there are many variations throughout the island of Puerto Rico. Most tiples have four or five strings and most tiple requintos have three strings. Some tiples have as many as 6 strings and as few as a single string, though these types are rare.

The main types of tiple in Puerto Rico are:

*Tiple requinto de la montaña - a tiny version of the tiple doliente with only three strings. It is usually smaller than 12 inches.
*Tiple requinto costanero - a smaller version of the tiplón with only three strings. It is usually about 15 inches in length.
*Tiple doliente - this tiple has 5 single strings and is the most common used today. It is usually about 15 inches in length.
*Tiplón or tiple con macho - a larger version of the tiple with a fifth string peg like an American banjo, located on its neck. It is usually about 21 inches in length.
*Tiple grande de Ponce - the largest version (about 21 inches in length) with 5 strings. It is considered a link between tiples and bordonuas. It is sometimes also called &quot;bordonua chiquita&quot; (small bordonua).

The tiple that is now most often played in Puerto Rico is the &quot;tiple doliente&quot;. It has recently acquired a more or less fixed body shape narrowing at the top and having 5 metal strings (see the accompanying photo). It is usually made like the cuatro, so either constructed like a guitar, or from one piece of wood hollowed out. The bottom half of the body is rounded like a guitar, however the top half is square, or triangular. All other features (like neck and bridge) resemble the construction of a normal Spanish guitar. The peghead has tuning machines either from the side or from the back. The strings of the tiple doliente are tuned: E3 A3 D4 G4 C5.

===Tiple Venezolano===
This tiple from Venezuela, looks like a smaller version of the Colombian Tiple. It has 4 sets of triple strings and is also known as the Guitarro, Guitarro Segundo, and the Segunda Guitarra. There is another tiple played in Venezuela but is a member of the Venezuelan Cuatro family of instruments, also called a tiple and known as the Cinco y Medio or Cinco. It is very much like the Cuatro but it has 5 strings instead of four.

===Tiple de Menorca===
On the Spanish Balearic island of Menorca, a &quot;tiple&quot; is an instrument with five single nylon strings.

===Tiple Cubano===
A tiple Cubano, has five doubled courses of strings, ten in total.

===Tiple de Santo Domingo===
The tiple de Santo Domingo, also known as tiple Dominicano or tiple, also has five doubled courses, for ten in total. The strings are steel. It is tuned C4, F4, A#4, D5, G5. All of the courses are tuned in unison.

===Tiple Peruano===
Peru has a tiple with four single or doubled steel strings. It is tuned A3, E4, B4, F#5.

===Tiples in Uruguay and Argentina===
In Uruguay and Argentina, sometimes the requinto guitar is called a tiple.

==Other versions==

===U.S. &quot;/&quot; N. American &quot;/&quot; Martin tiple===
The North American tiple was designed in 1919 by the Pennsylvania guitar company C.F. Martin &amp; Co. for the William J. Smith Co. in New York and was most popular through the 1920s-1940s ukulele craze. This tiple is close in length to a tenor ukulele, but with a deeper body. Unlike a ukulele, it has ten steel strings in four mixed-octave courses of 2, 3, 3, and 2 strings. 
Manufactured for a half century, the Martin tiple was used in jazz, blues and old-time country bands, and as a louder-volume ukulele. 
It was tuned similarly to a D-tuned ukulele:

:A4 A3 • D4 D3 D4 • F#4 F#3 F#4 • B3 B3 (wound octave-lower strings are A3, D3, and F#3).
Ohana, a more recent manufacturer of similar instruments, recommends tuning their copies of the Martin a full tone lower, as mentioned below, similar to contemporary ukuleles.

Martin produced mahogany and rosewood bodied tiples, following a model-identification system similar to its guitars: T-15 and T-17, mahogany top, back and sides; T-18, spruce top, mahogany back and sides; T-28, spruce top, rosewood back and sides; T-45, spruce top, rosewood back and sides, fancy abalone inlay. Martin&#x27;s tiple production continued off-and-on into the 1970s.

Similar instruments were made by Regal, Harmony, Lyon &amp; Healy, Oscar Schmidt, D&#x27;Angelico and other companies during the early decades of Martin production.

In the 21st century, the Ohana ukulele company began manufacturing an all-mahogany tiple similar to the Martin, but calling it &quot;a vintage ukulele inspired by the Columbian (sic) Tiple.&quot; The company recommended tuning with the lowest note a C.
(G3 G4 – C4 C3 C4 – E4 E3 E4 – A4 A4)

In addition to its original ukulele-style tuning (above), the American tiple sometimes has been tuned like the upper four courses of the guitar, presumably with special sets of strings.

===Electric tiples===

Electric tiples usually follow either the Colombian (12-string) or &quot;Martin&quot; (10-string) tuning and string arrangement.

==Related instruments==

===Spanish tiples===

In Spain there are similar instruments. This tiny guitar has four strings and is found in Menorca. Other types of small guitars in Spain are the guitarra, guitarro and guitarrico.

===Portuguese tiples===

Related Portuguese instruments are the cavaquinho or braguinha and the rajâo. The braguinha and the rajâo taken to Hawai&#x27;i by Portuguese immigrants from Madeira are the forerunners of the ukulele.

===Canary Island timple===

Migrating from North Africa in the 16th century to the Canary Islands and then on to Murcia, the timple has become the traditional instrument of the Canaries. In La Palma and in the north of the island of Tenerife some players omit the fifth string, tuning the timple like a ukulele, though nowadays this is often seen as non-standard by players in other regions where five strings are preferred. The popular tiple tuning is GCEAD.

==Other instruments==

The word &quot;tiple&quot; basically means &quot;treble&quot; or &quot;high pitched&quot;, and has been used occasionally for the names of other instruments not directly members of the tiple-family proper. One such is the &quot;Marxochime Hawaiian tiple&quot;, which bears no resemblance to the traditional tiples, but looks like (and is) a variety of zither. It is played with a combination of plucking, strumming, and playing with a slide similar to a lap steel guitar. The instrument is one of many zither variants marketed within the United States during the early 20th century, of which only the autoharp ever achieved lasting popularity. The instrument, also known as the &quot;Tremola&quot;, carries the &quot;Hawaiian tiple&quot; name solely for marketing purposes, as interest in Hawaiian music and culture was high in mainland America during the period when the instrument was marketed.

<text>The Billboard Liberation Front practices culture jamming via altering billboards by changing key words to radically alter the message, often to an anti-corporate message. It started in San Francisco in 1977.

Advertising executives informed Jill Posener, author of &quot;Spray it Loud&quot; (1982), that the executives designed billboards to attract attacks because the changes drew attention to the products. The BLF were aware of this possibility and considered invoicing advertisers including Chiat Day for the BLF&#x27;s work.

In 2013, Complex Magazine named the BLF #27 of The 50 Most Influential Street Artists of All Time.

== Cooperation ==

The BLF cooperated with a range of other art groups, like Guerrilla Girls, monochrom and Joey Skaggs.

<text>The Aramoana massacre was a mass shooting that occurred on 13 November 1990 in the small seaside township of Aramoana, northeast of Dunedin, New Zealand. Resident David Gray killed 13 people, including local police Sergeant Stewart Guthrie, one of the first responders to the reports of a shooting, after a verbal dispute between Gray and his next-door neighbour. After a careful house-to-house search the next day, police officers led by the Anti-Terrorist Squad (now known as the Special Tactics Group) located Gray, and shot and injured him as he came out of a house firing from the hip. He died in an ambulance while being transported to hospital.

At the time, the incident was the deadliest mass shooting in New Zealand&#x27;s history, being surpassed 28 years later by the Christchurch mosque shootings. After the shootings, sweeping changes were made to New Zealand&#x27;s firearms legislation in 1992, including 10-year photographic licences and tight restrictions on military style semi-automatic firearms.

==Details==
===Initial incident===
The massacre began on 13 November at 7:30 p.m. when Gray confronted neighbour Garry Holden about one of Holden&#x27;s daughters wandering onto his property. After the confrontation, Gray went into his house, retrieved a Norinco 84S semi-automatic rifle, walked outside and shot Holden multiple times in his chest, before walking over to him and shooting him fatally through the head.

Nearby were three young girls: Holden&#x27;s two daughters, Chiquita and Jasmine, and his girlfriend Julie Ann Bryson&#x27;s daughter, Rewa. The girls ran into Holden&#x27;s house to hide as Gray walked onto Holden&#x27;s property. He quickly found Chiquita and shot her in the chest and arm with a Squires and Bingham Model 16 .22-calibre semi-automatic sporting rifle, with one of the bullets lodging in her abdomen. Shortly after shooting her, Gray found the other two girls and killed them.

Chiquita, who managed to escape by running out of the back door, fled past her father&#x27;s body to Bryson&#x27;s nearby house, while Gray set the Holden house on fire. Bryson, realising that Rewa and Jasmine were still in the Holden house, drove her van there with Chiquita in an attempt to save the girls. Gray shot at the van as it passed the house, which was by then ablaze.

Gray started shooting indiscriminately, targeting a utility vehicle full of locals who had seen the Holden house burning and stopped to help. He first shot Vanessa Percy several times in the back as she ran down the street in terror; she died a few hours later at the scene. He then turned towards three children. He killed the two boys, Leo Wilson and Dion Percy. The boys&#x27; sister, Stacey, was critically injured by a bullet to her abdomen, but survived. Ross Percy, the children&#x27;s father, who had been driving them home after a day fishing when they saw the fire, was fatally shot in the head. Next, Aleki Tali was killed. Gray then entered the home of Tim Jamieson, killing him and another elderly local, former Green Island mayor Vic Crimp. The next victim was James Dickson, who was looking for his dog. Eva Helen Dickson, James&#x27; mother, and neighbour Chris Cole went into the road to see what the noise was. Gray shot at both of them, wounding Cole who was in a phone booth calling the police and forcing Mrs. Dickson to dive for cover. Mrs. Dickson, who had recently had a hip replacement and was unable to walk without assistance, pulled herself along on her stomach using her arms and feet in a ditch to get inside and called 1-1-1 (the emergency telephone number). She then crawled back to Cole to tell him help was coming. By this stage, it was getting dark and the dispatcher advised her to stay inside. Mrs Dickson later received the George Medal for bravery. Help arrived too late for Cole, who died in the hospital.

===First responders===
The first armed police officer to arrive was Sergeant Stewart Guthrie, officer in charge of Port Chalmers police station and an NCO in the Armed Offenders Squad (AOS). He came armed with a Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10 police revolver (front-line police in New Zealand do not routinely carry firearms). Guthrie enlisted the help of Constable Russell Anderson, who had arrived a short time earlier with the fire service. He armed Anderson with a rifle belonging to a resident. With darkness approaching, the pair moved through the township to Gray&#x27;s house, where Guthrie deployed the constable to cover the front while he moved to cover the more dangerous rear of the house. Detective Paul Alan Knox and two constables arrived, starting the first step of the &quot;cordon, contain, appeal&quot; standard police strategy for armed offenders.

Guthrie observed Gray and relayed his movements inside the house to the police communications centre. After some time he lost sight of the gunman, and advised the detective to warn everyone to be alert. Anderson spotted Gray coming out the front of his property and issued a challenge, at which the gunman retreated quickly, passing through the rear of his property. Taking cover in the sand dunes of a neighbouring crib, Guthrie encountered Gray coming out of the darkness. Yelling at the gunman to surrender, he fired a warning shot. Gray shouted, &quot;Don&#x27;t shoot!&quot;, leading Guthrie to believe he was surrendering. However, Gray suddenly fired several times, one shot striking Guthrie in the head, killing him instantly.

Minutes later the Dunedin branch of the AOS began to arrive and sealed off the township with a roadblock about 250 metres along the only road out of Aramoana, securing it with an armoured car. AOS units from Christchurch, Timaru, and Invercargill were called in for support. The situation was considered dangerous as Gray had a scoped rifle, making him potentially accurate at long range. By this point, the police had ordered that Gray was to be shot on sight – without a warning shot.

===Anti-Terrorist Squad===

Commissioner of Police John Jamieson authorised the Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) (now known as the Special Tactics Group (STG)), the specialist counter terrorist unit, to travel to Dunedin and locate Gray; group members were in Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland. Unable to get transport with the Air Force, the group caught the early morning business flight on the 14th.

They took Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 submachine guns, encountering some problems taking firearms on a commercial aircraft. Also on the flight were Minister of Police John Banks, the Commissioner, and Julie Holden, who described Aramoana to the ATS. A large number of reporters met the flight on arrival at Dunedin. A bus took the ATS to Port Chalmers, which was choked with vehicles, where residents from Aramoana briefed the group about the township and Gray. ATS members took a reconnaissance flight over the township in an RNZAF UH-1H Iroquois helicopter. The helicopter initially flew high as it had no armour protection from small arms fire; Gray had shot at a private news helicopter earlier that morning.

The crew of the Air Force Iroquois then carried out low, slow passes over areas of bush where Gray was believed to be hiding, carrying armed police and dropping tear gas grenades as it did so, in an attempt to &quot;flush him out&quot;. The Iroquois crew flew for over eight hours in support of the operation during the day, including positioning police snipers in the surrounding hills. After the initial reconnaissance flight, the ATS moved out as two squads and met up with the Timaru AOS, who were holding positions. The group received fire orders: &quot;if he has a firearm, he is to be shot&quot;. Meanwhile, Gray had entered a crib, eaten a small meal and gone to sleep.

===Manhunt and shootout===
Some Christchurch members of the ATS moved into Aramoana at about 6:00 a.m. on 14 November. The ATS went first to Gray&#x27;s house, passing bodies on the street. After clearing neighboring houses, they put a stun grenade into Gray&#x27;s, blowing out the windows, followed by tear gas. Kicking down the door, they discovered it was empty. The group then worked down the road, checking each house, a squad on either side of the street. The ATS called up the AOS, with members from Wanganui, Palmerston North, Napier, and New Plymouth, to their backs. The group discovered Sergeant Guthrie&#x27;s revolver in a garden, and a woman who had been hiding under a table for more than twenty hours.

After a long day searching from house to house, the ATS checked a crib with a broken window on the north-eastern side of the township. The crib had large hedges on both sides, and a fibrolite shed at the rear. The group spotted Gray briefly at a window, and a battle ensued. Police put a stun grenade through a window, but it bounced off a mattress that Gray had placed as a barricade and landed back near police. Police fired teargas into the crib. Gray began shooting not at police but through the fibrolite shed.

The ATS opened fire, both sides shooting for two minutes, Gray walking around inside firing randomly. A stray bullet that passed through the crib struck an ATS officer in the ankle. As soon as the shooting erupted, the Air Force Iroquois took up position overhead to help ensure Gray could not escape into nearby bushes in the fading light of the approaching second night.

===Gray&#x27;s death===
At around 5:50 p.m., Gray ran out of the house, shooting from the hip and shouting &quot;Kill me! Fucking kill me, you bastards!&quot; He took several steps before being hit and knocked down by ATS gunfire. Gray was hit five times: in the eye, neck, chest and twice in the groin. Even with these injuries, he struggled fiercely against police, breaking free of plastic handcuffs before being re-handcuffed, while berating police for not having killed him. Ambulance officers treated him at the scene and on the way to Dunedin hospital by providing him oxygen, but the ambulance did not get very far out of Aramoana, and at 6:10 p.m., Gray died from his wounds.

Inside the crib police found a .22-calibre Vickers-Martini MK II single-shot rifle, a .22-calibre Winchester Model 750 rifle fitted with a suppressor, a Norinco SKS semi-automatic rifle, a .22-calibre Squires and Bingham Model 16, an air rifle, hundreds of rounds of .22 ammunition, and approximately 100 rounds of .223 ammunition. Gray was carrying a .22-calibre Remington Nylon 66 as well as the .223 Norinco 84 when he was shot. Police had fired between 50 and 60 shots, and at least 150 police officers were involved in the operation.

Rewa Bryson and Jasmine Holden&#x27;s charred bodies were found in what remained of the Holden family home. Fourteen people, including Gray, were left dead by the end of the incident.

==The perpetrator==

David Malcolm Gray (20 November 1956 – 14 November 1990), aged 33, an unemployed resident of Aramoana, was born in Dunedin, New Zealand, and raised in Port Chalmers. His father, David Francis Gray, worked in a manufacturing company and his mother, Mary Elizabeth Gray, was a machinist. He had two siblings, sister Joan and brother Barry.

Gray attended Port Chalmers Primary School, and later enrolled at the Otago Boys&#x27; High School from 1971 to 1973, where he was a mid-stream student. A former classmate stated Gray was quiet and unassuming, and that &quot;there was nothing frightening about him then&quot;. Those who knew Gray remembered him as having been a loner since primary school. He had worked occasionally as a farmhand but had been unemployed for a few years before 1990.

Both Gray&#x27;s parents predeceased him, his father on 30 November 1978 and his mother on 22 January 1985. His sister said the death of their mother deeply affected David, and prompted him to move from Port Chalmers to the Gray family holiday home in Aramoana.

Gray was a regular customer at Galaxy Books and Records in Lower Stuart Street, Dunedin. Bill Brosnan, the owner, knew him for seven years and said he was a fan of military books and &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; magazine. In January 1990, he threatened an assistant of the bookshop with what appeared to be a shotgun in a cardboard box, and Brosnan served him with a trespass notice in February. His sister said he was an animal lover. Locals said this was a source of conflict with his next-door neighbour Garry Holden, whose pets kept dying.

==Casualties==

* Simon Christopher &quot;Chris&quot; Cole, 62;
* Victor James &quot;Vic&quot; Crimp, 71;
* James Alexander &quot;Jim&quot; Dickson, 45;
* Sergeant Stewart Graeme &quot;Stu&quot; Guthrie, 41, Port Chalmers police officer;
* Garry John Holden, 38;
* Jasmine Amber Holden, 11, daughter of Garry Holden;
* Magnus &quot;Tim&quot; Jamieson, 69;

* Chiquita Holden, 9, daughter of Garry Holden;
* Detective Stephen Vaughan, Wellington police officer (referred to as &quot;Gamma&quot; in Bill O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s account).

==Causes==
Gray&#x27;s mental and physical state worsened in the months leading up to the attack. There was some evidence of a progressive decline in his mental state before the shootings, as he alienated the few friends he had. On the morning of 13 November, he travelled into Dunedin, and visited a bank where he objected angrily to a NZ$2.00 bank fee for a cheque.

He then went to Elio&#x27;s Gun Shop in King Edward Street, South Dunedin, placing a $100 deposit on a gun he intended to collect the next week. At the Continental Coffee Bar, he was served a cold pie, and became confrontational. After being asked to leave, he threatened the owners saying: &quot;I&#x27;ll be back, I&#x27;m going to get you. I&#x27;ll blow you away.&quot;

==Aftermath==

Three days after the incident, Gray&#x27;s house at 27 Muri Street in Aramoana was deliberately set on fire and burnt to the ground. The Port Chalmers Fire Brigade attended and doused surrounding vegetation to prevent the fire spreading; around fifty residents watched it burn and reportedly laughed mockingly as it did so. Gray&#x27;s relatives asked that any investigation of arson be stopped, when contacted by police.

The massacre was the deadliest mass shooting in New Zealand&#x27;s history until the Christchurch mosque massacre at Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch on 15 March 2019.

It sparked lengthy debate about gun control, as Gray&#x27;s primary weapon was a Norinco 84S 5.56mm semi-automatic rifle which had a similar appearance to and internal mechanism based on the Russian AK-47 assault rifle, and he owned three other semi-automatic firearms. Four of the dead victims and one of the injured were proven forensically to have been shot with the Norinco rifle, and another of the injured had been shot with Gray&#x27;s .22 cal Squires Bingham rifle. Fragments recovered from other victims did not lead to an identification of the weapon.

The incident directly resulted in an amendment to New Zealand&#x27;s firearms legislation in 1992, tightening gun control and the creation of the military-style semi-automatic category of firearms.

===Bravery awards===
A number of those involved received bravery awards: 
*George Cross – Sergeant Stewart Guthrie (posthumous);
*George Medal – Mrs Eva Helen Dickson;
*Queen&#x27;s Gallantry Medal – Victor James Crimp QSM (posthumous), Constable Don Nicholas Fraser Harvey, Detective Paul Alan Knox, Constable Terry Edward Van Turnhout, Senior Constable David Thomas Weir;
*Queen&#x27;s Commendation for Brave Conduct – Sergeant Michael Arthur Kyne, Constable Timothy Philip Ashton, Constable Robert William Barlass, Constable Peter Gerard McCarthy, Chiquita Danielle Holden.

===Police commendations===
In addition, a number of police officers who were involved in the incident received internal police merit awards.
* Gold Merit Award – Inspector Murray James Forbes (forward commander of the two anti-terrorist squads), Detective Stephen Patrick Vaughan;
* Certificate of Appreciation – Detective Sergeant Brian Keith Woodcock (squad leader), Constable Gregory James Cummings, Constable Michael Lyn Rusbatch (squad members).

===Memorials===
*A memorial to the victims was erected in the township.
*A memorial to Sergeant Stewart Guthrie was erected at Dunedin Police Station. His name was also added to the memorial wall at the Royal New Zealand Police College and a memorial tribute published on the police website. Police and the Police Museum also mourn Sergeant Guthrie&#x27;s death by issuing statements upon its anniversary.

===Subsequent events===
In 2009, Mrs Dickson&#x27;s George Medal was thought to have been stolen from a museum, as it could not be found. After the theft began circulating on the news and social media, it was found the following year in a cupboard in the museum where it had been stored and poorly catalogued.

In February 2018, relatives sold the George Cross awarded to Sergeant Stewart Guthrie to Lord Ashcroft. The Ministry of Culture and Heritage was criticised for approving the sale.

In 2018 (27 years later), survivors Chiquita Holden (aged 37) and Detective Stephen Vaughan (aged 55) married in a low-key, surprise wedding. Both were wounded during the incident but survived. They had first met in Dunedin Hospital, whilst recovering from their injuries, where they had compared scars and signed each other&#x27;s casts. Vaughan had retired from the police in 2012, after a 30-year career, and been awarded an ONZM in 2016 for his services to police and the community. Holden had become a homicide specialist for Victim Support.

==Cultural influence==

===Books===
At least two non-fiction books have been written about the shootings: &quot;Tragedy at Aramoana&quot; by journalist Paul Bensemann; and &quot;Aramoana: Twenty-two hours of terror&quot; by police officer Bill O&#x27;Brien. There are chapters devoted to the shootings in Gordon Johnston&#x27;s history of the settlement, &quot;Journey to Aramoana – His Story&quot;, and &quot;Confessions from the Front Line&quot; by STG leader Murray Forbes.

===Film and television===

A feature film based on the massacre, &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, directed by Robert Sarkies and starring Karl Urban, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on 12 September 2006. The production faced opposition from some citizens in Aramoana, which resulted in the majority of the movie having to be filmed in another nearby township. However, eventually the community did allow a small number of scenes to be filmed in Aramoana. They agreed to the making of the movie only if the title was not &quot;Aramoana&quot; and if they were to see the movie beforehand.

Bryan Bruce&#x27;s 1997 documentary, &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, investigates David Gray and the events leading up to the killings at Aramoana in 1990, examines psychological similarities between Gray and other mass murderers, and probes into New Zealand legislation around gun laws. 

===Music===
The massacre was an inspiration for the Mutton Birds&#x27; song &quot;A Thing Well Made&quot; on their self-titled debut album. The song is narrated by a man who owns a sporting goods store in Christchurch. As the song closes, he describes his work for the day, which involves sending &quot;one of those AK-47s for some collector down the line&quot;. Dunedin band the Chills more directly address the Aramoana incident in the song &quot;Strange Case&quot; from the 1992 album &quot;Soft Bomb&quot;. Members of the newly formed Wellington band Goatrider were inspired to write the song &quot;David Gray&quot;, which subsequently appeared on their 1992 limited edition cassette release &quot;FTS&quot;.

<text>The Football Association of Finland (, SPL; ) is the governing body of football and futsal in Finland. It was founded in Helsinki on 19 May 1907.

The SPL organises the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s national football teams, and the second to ninth tiers of national football. The premier division Veikkausliiga is organized by a distinct organisation. The SPL is based in the Finnish capital city of Helsinki.

==Background==
The SPL has more than 1,000 member clubs and approximately 140,000 registered players. The Finnish Gallup survey has indicated that football is a popular pastime with around 500,000 Finns interested in the sport. The SPL is Finland&#x27;s largest amateur sports federation.

The association was also the governing body of bandy in Finland until Finland&#x27;s Bandy Association was founded in 1972. In 1928, it also arranged the first Finland ice hockey championship, before the 1929 establishment of the Finnish Ice Hockey Association.

==Publications==
The association publishes several magazines, including now-defunct monthly magazine &quot;Futari&quot;.

<text>Gheorghe Argeșanu (28 February 1883 – 26/27 November 1940) was a Romanian cavalry general and politician who served as a Prime Minister of Romania for about a week in September 1939.

==Biography==
Born in Caracal, he was promoted to a leadership position in the Romanian Army during World War I, and served as the first Romanian military attaché to Japan (1921–1922) and as Minister of Defense in the second Miron Cristea cabinet (March–October 1938).

Argeșanu was appointed as premier by King Carol II after the assassination of his predecessor Armand Călinescu by the nationalist Iron Guard, and promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General. His first noted measures included the public display of the bodies of Călinescu&#x27;s assassins (who had been killed by orders from Horia Sima) and the arbitrary arrest and execution without trial of at least three Iron Guard members in each county. Over 300 legionnaires were summarily executed in reprisal for Călinescu&#x27;s assassination. He was replaced as premier by Constantin Argetoianu. In June 1940, he was awarded the Order of the Star of Romania, 1st Class.

==Death==

Immediately after the establishment of the Iron Guard&#x27;s National Legionary State in September 1940, Argeșanu himself was imprisoned without trial in the Jilava Prison, and ultimately killed there during the Jilava massacre by members of the Iron Guard on the same night together with 63 other political prisoners, in retaliation for the violence he had endorsed.

Argeșanu was married to the pianist Manya Botez.

<doc id="1281413" wikidata="Q2389483" url="?curid=1281413" title="Clan MacDuff">
<text>Clan MacDuff or Clan Duff is a Lowland Scottish clan. The clan does not currently have a chief and is therefore considered an armigerous clan, which is registered with the Lyon Court. The early chiefs of Clan MacDuff were the original Earls of Fife, although this title went to the Stewarts of Albany in the late fourteenth century. The title returned to the MacDuff chief when William Duff was made Earl Fife in 1759. His descendant Alexander Duff was made Duke of Fife in 1889.

==History==

===Origins of the clan===

The Clan Duff claims descent from the original royal Scoto-Pictish line of which Queen Gruoch of Scotland, wife of Macbeth, King of Scotland, was the senior representative. After the death of MacBeth, Malcolm III of Scotland seized the Crown and his son, Aedh, married the daughter of Queen Gruoch. Aedh was created Earl of Fife and abbot of Abernethy. The early chiefs of Clan MacDuff were the Earls of Fife. Sir Iain Moncreiffe wrote that the Clan MacDuff was the premier clan among the Scottish Gaels. Today, the Earls of Wemyss are thought to be the descendants in the male line of Gille Míchéil, Earl of Fife, thought to be one of the first Clan MacDuff chiefs. Gille-michael MacDuff was one of the witnesses to the great charter of David I of Scotland to Dunfermline Abbey.
===14th and 15th centuries===

In 1306 during the Wars of Scottish Independence, Duncan MacDuff, Earl of Fife, was as a minor, held by Edward I of England at the coronation of Robert the Bruce as his ward while Duncan&#x27;s sister, Isabella MacDuff, placed the golden circlet upon King Robert&#x27;s head. As a result, when she fell into the hands of King Edward&#x27;s army, she was imprisoned in a cage which was suspended from the walls of Berwick Castle. Duncan MacDuff later married Mary, the niece of King Edward, and threw in his lot against the Bruce. However, he was captured and imprisoned in Kildrummy Castle where he died in 1336. The Earldom later fell into the hands of Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany, however, although the MacDuff family lost their rank, they continued to prosper. In 1384, the earl of Fife was described as , meaning &#x27;chief of the law of Clan MacDuff&#x27;. In 1404, David Duff received a charter from Robert III of Scotland for lands in Banffshire.

===17th, 18th and 19th centuries===

In 1626, John Duff sold the lands in Banffshire which his ancestor had acquired in 1404. The title of The Fife returned with William Duff, 1st Earl Fife and Viscount Macduff, in 1759. The 1st Earl Fife&#x27;s cousin, Captain Robert Duff of the Royal Navy supported the British-Hanoverian Government during the Jacobite rising of 1745 and was involved in the Skirmish of Arisaig. James Duff, 4th Earl Fife fought with distinction in the Peninsular War where he was wounded at the Battle of Talavera in 1809 and was later made a Knight of the Order of St Ferdinand of Spain.

Alexander Duff, 6th Earl Fife, married Louise, Princess Royal, eldest daughter of Edward VII. Alexander was advanced to the rank of Duke of Fife in July 1889.

===20th and 21st centuries===
With the death of the 1st Duke of Fife, the Clan MacDuff had its last Chief.
On 15 June 2024 notice was made of candidates for Clan Name and Commander Sought for Clans MacDuffee, Macfie, and MacPhee and Presentation must be by May 2025

==Law of Clan MacDuff==
Clan Macduff was the first Scottish clan to be recognized as a clan by the Scottish Parliament, by legislation dated November 1384.

The Earl of Fife and the Abbot of Abernethy were both &quot;Capitals of Law of the Clan MacDuff&quot;. The law protected all murderers within ninth degree of kin to the Earl of Fife, as they could claim sanctuary at the Cross of MacDuff near Abernethy, and could find remission by paying compensation to the victim&#x27;s family.

The chiefs of the clan had the right to enthrone the King on the Stone of Scone. When the Stone of Scone was taken to England by Edward I of England, Robert I of Scotland had himself crowned King of Scots a second time, in order to be crowned by a member of clan MacDuff, in that case the Earl of Fife&#x27;s sister.

In 1425, the last Earl of Fife, Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany, was beheaded. The Clan MacDuff&#x27;s hereditary right of bearing the Crown of Scotland then passed to the Lord Abernethy. The current Lord Abernethy, who is consequently bearer of the Scottish Crown, is Alexander Douglas-Hamilton, 16th Duke of Hamilton.

==Tartans==
There are several Clan MacDuff tartans. The most conventionally used is one recorded by the weavers William Wilson &amp; Son of Bannockburn some time between and 1819 (two variants exist, with blue or green thin &quot;tram track&quot; over-check lines in place of the black ones.) A variant on this, with the larger black stripe replaced by dark green and the proportions altered, was recorded by the Highland Society of London, c. 1815–20. All of these are very similar to the royal Stewart tartan, but without its thin yellow and white over-checks. A third and rather different one appeared in 1842 in the &quot;Vestiarium Scoticum&quot;, and was probably invented by the &quot;Sobieski Stuarts&quot;. There are various other tartans with names like dress MacDuff and hunting MacDuff.

==Clan Castles==

* Macduff&#x27;s Castle in East Wemyss, Fife, is now a ruinous castle that was once held by the MacDuff Earls of Fife. The property later went to the Clan Wemyss who built the present castle.
* Airdit House in Leuchers, Fife, was originally held by the MacDuffs but later went to the Clan Stewart who held it in 1425 when Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany (also then Earl and Duke of Fife), was executed.
* Barnslee Castle near Markinch, Fife, was held by the Clan MacDuff. One story is that a tunnel led from it to Maiden Castle (see below), that was about three miles away.
* Castle Hill in North Berwick in East Lothian was probably held by the MacDuff Earls of Fife who had a ferry from North Berwick to Earlsferry in Fife.
* Cupar Castle in Cupar, Fife, was held by the Clan MacDuff.
* Falkland Palace in Falkland, Fife. There was a castle here that was held by the MacDuff Earls of Fife although it was destroyed by the English in 1337. It was re-built in 1371 and passed to Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany, who was then also Earl of Fife.
* Fernie Castle in Cupar, Fife, was once held by the MacDuff Earls of Fife.
* Maiden Castle near Methil, Fife, was once held by the Clan MacDuff. One story is that a tunnel led from it to Barnslee Castle (see above), that was about three miles away.

<text>Rudolf Hirzel (20 March 1846, Leipzig - 30 December 1917, Jena) was a German classical scholar, and author of a number of major books on Greek law, oaths, dialogues and names. He was the second son of Solomon Hirzel, the owner of a publishing house in Leipzig. He was educated at the Thomasschule in Leipzig and went to study Classics in Heidelberg, Göttingen (with Hermann Sauppe) and, lastly, Berlin, where he graduated in 1868 (with Moriz Haupt).

Hirzel married Dorothea Hirzel, née Springer, on 14 March 1887. They had no children. In Jena Rudolf Hirzel lived in the same house as Gottlob Frege and it has been conjectured that his studies in ancient logic may have influenced him.

<text>Bruno Hildebrand (6 March 1812 – 29 January 1878) was a German economist representing the &quot;older&quot; historical school of economics. His economic thinking was highly critical of classical economists, especially of David Ricardo. His &quot;magnum opus&quot; was &quot;Economics of the Present and the Future&quot; (1848). The basic aim of this work was to establish laws of economic development. Hildebrand also stated that economic development was linear not cyclical. He supported socialist theory on the basis of religion, basic morals, and his beliefs of the negative effect of property on economic behavior.

Like many other representatives of the German Historical School such as Friedrich List, Karl Knies, and Karl Bücher, Hildebrand was a political liberal who advocated liberal institutions and a constitutional state, and participated in the Frankfurt Parliament of 1848. An economics professor in Marburg, he was accused of high treason with respect to the turmoil of 1848 and condemned to death. He avoided the execution of this sentence by escaping to Switzerland, where he served as an associate professor at the University of Zurich. Together with Alfred Escher (Credit Swiss Founder) he was a co-founder and CEO of the Swiss Northeastern Railway Nordostbahn and also was the founder of the Swiss National Bureau Federal Statistical Office and original board member of Credit Swiss bank. Hildebrand also created and directed the publication &#x27;Jahrbücher für Nationalökonomie und Statistik&#x27;; for his contributions he was granted honorary Swiss citizenship. He became a professor at the University of Bern. Hildebrand returned then to Germany, where he was a professor at the University of Jena.

He married Therese Guttentag their son was the artist and sculptor Adolf von Hildebrand. His grandson was the philosopher Dietrich von Hildebrand. His great-great-grandson is environmental leader Martin von Hildebrand.
