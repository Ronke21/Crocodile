<text>The Battle of Morval, 25–28 September 1916, was an attack during the Battle of the Somme by the British Fourth Army on the villages of Morval, Gueudecourt and Lesbœufs held by the German 1st Army, which had been the final objectives of the Battle of Flers–Courcelette (15–22 September). The main British attack was postponed to combine with attacks by the French Sixth Army on the village of Combles south of Morval.

The attack was to close up to the German defences between Moislains and Le Transloy, near the Péronne–Bapaume road (N 17). The combined attack from the Somme river northwards to Martinpuich on the Albert–Bapaume road, was also intended to deprive the German defenders further west near Thiepval of reinforcements, before an attack by the Reserve Army, due on 26 September. The postponement was extended from because of rain, which affected operations more frequently during September.

Combles, Morval, Lesbœufs and Gueudecourt were captured and many casualties inflicted on the Germans. The French made slower progress near the inter-army boundary, due to the obstruction of St Pierre Vaast Wood to the French attack north towards Sailly and Sailly-Saillisel. The inter-army boundary was moved north from to allow the French more room to deploy their forces but the great quantity of German artillery-fire limited the French advance. The Fourth Army advance on 25 September was its deepest since 14 July and left the Germans in severe difficulties, particularly in a salient which developed to the north-east of Combles.

Tiredness and lack of reserves prevented the Fourth Army exploiting its success beyond patrolling and cavalry probes. The Reserve Army attack began on 26 September, at the Battle of Thiepval Ridge. Deteriorating weather and the shorter days greatly increased British and French transport difficulties; rain and fog grounded aircraft and impeded artillery observation. Mud reduced the blast effect of shells and immobilised infantry, which was an advantage to the defenders. A small number of tanks joined in the battle later in the afternoon, after having been held back because of the later start, reducing a number of German strong points, which had withstood earlier attacks.
==Background==
===Strategic developments===
At the beginning of August, optimistic that the Brusilov Offensive would continue to absorb German and Austro-Hungarian reserves and that the Germans had abandoned their offensive at Verdun, Sir Douglas Haig advocated to the War Committee in London, that relentless pressure be kept on the German armies in France for as long as possible. Haig had hoped that the delay in producing tanks had been overcome and that enough would be ready to be used in September. Despite the small numbers of tanks available and the limited time for the training of crews by September 1916, Haig had committed them in the Battle of Flers–Courcelette, in view of the importance of the general Allied offensive being conducted on the Western Front in France, by Italy against the Austro-Hungarians and by Brusilov in Russia, which could not continue indefinitely. Haig had believed that the German defence of the Somme front was weakening and that by mid-September might collapse altogether.

==Prelude==
===Anglo-French preparations===
After the attacks of 12 and 15 September, Foch and Haig kept the Germans off balance, by mounting smaller operations. The British 6th Division captured the Quadrilateral north of Combles on 18 September. While the French Sixth and the Fourth Army prepared to resume larger attacks, the French Tenth Army to the south of the Somme captured Berny, Vermandovillers, Déniecourt and took several thousand prisoners. On the nights of 19 and 20 September, parties of the 56th (1/1st London) Division consolidated a line west and north-east of Combles, from Beef Trench to Middle Copse. The new trench was dug north-east to a tram line near the junction of the Ginchy–Morval road, which connected Middle Copse with the Quadrilateral further north, creating a line long facing Bouleaux Wood. The division was ready to attack from Combles to Leuze Wood and Bouleaux Wood to envelop Bouleaux Wood and avoid a costly fight at close-quarters.

Careful planning for the Anglo-French attack was necessary, due to the French Sixth Army advance diverging to the east and north-east. The attack northwards at Combles to keep touch with the British needed reinforcements, which were taken from the Tenth Army on the south bank. More artillery and aircraft were brought from Verdun and VII Corps was relieved; V, VI and XXXII corps entered the line (which had become longer, since the advance of 12 September) between I and XXXIII corps, increasing the Sixth Army to five corps. The resumption of the general attack was planned for 21 September but poor weather forced a delay until 25 September. The preliminary bombardment began on 24 September but a thick autumn mist in the morning and hazy conditions all day, reduced the amount of counter-battery fire that could be delivered. Late on 25 September, after the Sixth Army had been held up by the fire power of the German forces north of St Quentin, Foch arranged a northward move of the inter-army boundary, so that the I and XXXII Corps could attack Sailly-Saillisel from the south, with V Corps as right flank guard. A conference at the British Fourth Army headquarters on 26 September, arranged the move of the inter-army boundary to run from Lesbœufs, north-east towards Rocquigny.

===Anglo-French plans===

Foch intended to resume the French attack from Mont St Quentin, east of the Somme bend to Combles, at the boundary with the British Fourth Army. The Sixth Army was to advance , close to the German line running from Moislains to Le Transloy. In the south, VI and XXXIII corps would advance east and south-east, to establish a defensive flank along the Tortille stream, menacing Péronne from the north. V and VI corps would capture the south of Bois St Pierre Vaast (St Pierre Vaast Wood) and southern Saillisel, while I Corps and XXXII Corps advanced east to take Rancourt, the rest of Saillisel and the Wood, Frégicourt and Sailly-Saillisel. Distant objectives east of the Péronne–Bapaume road were selected, should the German defence collapse and the cavalry was made ready to prolong an advance.

The British plan was for an advance to the final objective set for the attacks of during the Battle of Flers–Courcelette. The ground to be taken was on the east side of Bazentin ridge, which ran north-west from the Somme to a hollow facing north-east with Combles at the west end, the hollow running towards Rocquigny beyond the Péronne–Bapaume road. North of the hollow the ridge continued through Morval, Lesbœufs and Gueudecourt, then the Albert–Bapaume road, west of Le Sars to Thiepval. Spurs ran down the eastern slope, generally to the north-east in the direction of the Péronne–Bapaume road, before the ground rose again from St Pierre Vaast Wood to Sailly-Saillisel, Le Transloy, Beaulencourt and Thilloy.

An advance on the main front of the British attack of was to be made in stages. The first step was an advance to the third of the objective lines set for 15 September and to the Gird Trenches () south of Gueudecourt, beginning at The second objective was a line along the sunken road running from Combles to Gueudecourt, west of Morval and Lesbœufs, then over a spur south-east of Gueudecourt and through the centre of the village, beginning at The final objective was on the east side of Morval, Lesbœufs and Gueudecourt, the advance to begin at with the objectives to be reached by 

The use of tanks was discussed at a conference on 19 September, where the difficulty in hiding them until the late zero hour, led to them remaining in reserve, ready to assist the attack on the villages at the final objective. The open ground on the approach to Gueudecourt was also considered to be too dangerous for tanks. Two brigades of the 1st Indian Cavalry Division were to move forward to Mametz, with all of the division to be ready to advance on Thilloy and Ligny Thilloy in the III Corps area once Lesbœufs and Gueudecourt were captured, if this was done before Small cavalry detachments were also attached to XIV and XV corps to exploit local opportunities.

The British conformed to the French preference for afternoon attacks, which meant that the final bombardment took place in daylight, despite preferring dawn attacks, to avoid the attacking infantry waiting for too long in the front-line, vulnerable to German counter-bombardment. The XIV Corps commander Major-General the Earl of Cavan put all four divisions of the corps in line, to give them narrower fronts for easier deployment of the supporting infantry. The 56th (1/1st London) Division was to mask Bouleaux Wood and reach trenches to the north-east, cutting the tramlines which looped around the north end of the wood. The division was to gain touch with the 5th Division on the left, while trench mortar and machine-gun fire on the wood and on the north-eastern exits of Combles, kept the Germans under cover. The right flank brigade of the 5th Division was to advance from the second objective to Morval, with four halts, gaining touch with the 56th (1/1st London) Division. The 6th Division to the north had already reached the third objective of the attack of 15 September, on a front of . The German defences on the flanks were too close for artillery and a Stokes mortar bombardment and machine-gun barrage were substituted, for zero hour.

The Guards Division (Major-General Geoffrey Feilding) anticipated &quot;strenuous&quot; German resistance. Feilding stressed that preparations for house-to-house fighting, maintaining direction, momentum were needed. The green line (first objective) was west of Lesbœufs, the brown line was from the crossroads south of Lesbœufs, along the western edge of the village and the blue line (third objective) was east of the village from the Lesbœufs–Le Transloy road, northwards along the Lesbœufs–Gueudecourt road. Three tanks were attached to the divisional reserve, ready to move from Trônes Wood once the infantry attack started. The artillery was divided into two groups of three field artillery brigades for each brigade and the bombardment was to begin at on 24 September. During the attack, half of the artillery was to fire standing barrages and the other half was to fire a creeping barrage, moving at per minute until beyond the green line, where it would become a standing barrage. Creeping barrages to the second and third objectives were to begin at and 

===German preparations===
On 28 August, Chief of the General Staff, General Erich von Falkenhayn, simplified the German command structure on the Western Front by establishing two army groups. controlled the 6th, 1st and 2nd armies, from Lille to the boundary of , south of the Somme battlefield. was dissolved and General Max von Gallwitz reverted to the command of the 2nd Army. The cessation of German attacks at Verdun, ordered by the new supreme command of Chief of the General Staff, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and the General Erich Ludendorff, when they superseded Falkenhayn and the reinforcement of the Somme front, reduced the German inferiority in guns and aircraft on the Somme during September. Field artillery batteries were able to reduce their barrage frontage from to . Accuracy was improved by using one air artillery flight per division with aircraft sent from the Verdun front. Colonel Fritz von Loßberg, Chief of Staff of the 2nd Army and then the 1at Army during the period of , was also able to establish (relief divisions) behind the battlefield, ready to replace front divisions. German counter-attacks became bigger and more frequent, making the Anglo-French advance slower and more costly. After the Anglo-French attacks in mid-September a &quot;wholesale relief&quot; of the front-line divisions had been possible.

As the Germans had been pushed out of their original defences, Loßberg had new positions dug based on the principles of depth, dispersal and camouflage, rather than continuous lines of trenches. Rigid defence of the front-line continued but with as few soldiers as possible, relying on the firepower of machine-guns firing from behind the front-line and from the flanks. The German artillery reduced its counter-battery fire and area bombardments before Anglo-French attacks and used the reinforcements from Verdun for destructive fire, observed from balloons and aircraft. The area behind the front-line was defended by support and reserve units dispersed on reverse slopes, in undulations and in any cover that could be found, so that they could open machine-gun fire by surprise, from unseen positions and then counter-attack swiftly, before the Anglo-French infantry could consolidate captured ground. Rather than pack troops into the front-line, the local, corps and army reserves were held back, in lines about apart, able to make progressively stronger counter-attacks. The largest German counter-attacks of the Somme battle had taken place from from the Somme north to St Pierre Vaast Wood but these had been &quot;destroyed&quot; by French artillery fire.

Trenches were still dug but were no longer intended to be fought from, being used for shelter during quiet periods, for the movement of reinforcements and supplies, as rallying points and decoys. Before an attack, the garrison tried to move forwards into shell-holes, to avoid Anglo-French artillery-fire and surprise attacking infantry with machine-gun fire. Opposite the French, the Germans dug new defences on a reverse slope between the Tortille stream at Allaines, to the west end of St Pierre Vaast Wood and from there to Morval, connected to a new fourth position dug from Sailly Saillisel to Morval and Bapaume, along the Péronne–Bapaume road. French agents also reported new construction to the east. Ludendorff had recently created fifteen &quot;new&quot; divisions by combing-out troops at depots and by removing regiments from existing divisions, from which the 212th, 213th and 214th divisions were brought in, to replace worn out divisions opposite the French Tenth and Sixth armies.

==Battle==
===French Sixth Army===

====25–26 September====
At on 25 September, the Sixth Army attacked with seven divisions. The XXXIII Corps attacked along both sides of the Somme and made very slow progress towards Feuillaucourt; further north VI Corps was stopped south-east of Bouchavesnes and V Corps was stopped short of the village. German artillery on Mont St Quentin swept the southern part of the Sixth Army front and at Inferno Trench, dug on a reverse-slope, strafing by German aircraft and fire from machine-guns hidden in shell-holes, stopped the French advance after . The 10th Division managed a costly advance close to the edge of St Pierre Vaast Wood on 26 and 27 September. The 42nd Division of XXXII Corps captured Rancourt, then occupied Frégicourt shortly after midnight on 26 September, before reaching the west end of St Pierre Vaast Wood, where its advance was stopped by massed machine-gun fire from German positions hidden in the edge of the wood.

A combined attack by the 2nd Division and the British 56th (1/1st London) Division took Combles, before all of the German garrison escaped, after I Corps had been held up for most of the day by German machine-gun fire south-east of the village. French patrols got into Combles overnight and by dawn on 26 September, the south-east of the town had been occupied and taken. German troops retreating east were &quot;routed&quot; in the direction of Haïe Wood by machine-gun fire. Much German equipment was captured, including two million rounds of ammunition, shells and many hand-grenades. I Corps then advanced a short distance east of the Frégicourt–Le Transloy road. A renewal of the attack towards the German defences between Haie Wood and St Pierre Vaast Wood, was delayed until Mutton Trench on the left flank was attacked at by the British. The French attack managed to advance on the flanks but was held up in the centre.

===Fourth Army===
====25 September====
XIV Corps attacked on the right with the 56th (1/1st London) Division next to the French Sixth Army, in co-operation with the French 2nd Division, with two battalions of the 168th Brigade while the other two on the right flank contained the Germans in Bouleaux Wood and the western defences of Combles. The brigade quickly advanced round the north of the wood, despite resistance in the embankment of the tramlines and then sent patrols towards Combles. Artillery observers reported small groups of German soldiers moving eastwards from the village. By midnight all three brigades had moved forward and at British and French troops met; by dawn a patrol met French soldiers east of the town, the 56th (1/1st London) Division line being consolidated east of Combles, with the Germans beyond in Mutton Trench. A further attack was planned with tank support then cancelled when the tanks failed to appear.

North of the 56th (1/1st London) Division, the 95th Brigade of the 5th Division was delayed by enfilade machine-gun fire from the embankment north of the tram line and a strong point on the Ginchy–Morval road until bombed from the north. On the left the 15th Brigade followed the creeping barrage closely down into the valley, over-running and taking prisoner numerous Germans. The 95th Brigade resumed its advance up the far slope and rushed the German trench running south from Morval, as the 15th Brigade overran the trench further north, west of the village, taking many more prisoners. After another halt to reorganise, the village was occupied by the 15th Brigade at . The final objective from the windmill, south to the 56th (1/1st London) Division area, was consolidated by nightfall. Several weak German counter-attacks were defeated and the 95th Brigade began working its way southward, towards the French at Frégicourt.
The 6th Division attacked from north of Morval, to the road through the middle of Lesbœufs, on the left of the 5th Division. The first objective was taken by a battalion of the 16th Brigade on the right and two battalions of the 18th Brigade on the left. The final objective east of the Morval–Lesbœufs road was captured by two battalions leapfrogging through on the right and one on the left, to clear the south end of Lesbœufs, where the Guards Division was met as it occupied the north end. The attack benefitted from good weather, which led to a good preliminary bombardment and an accurate creeping barrage, being taken. The 5th and 6th divisions consolidated on spurs east and north-east of Morval. At the adjoining brigades advanced another east of Morval and also put posts on a line from Morval Mill north to Lesbœufs.

The Guards Division attacked with two brigades in line, which advanced in waves apart. A German counter-barrage began on the Guards Division front, within a minute of the infantry advancing but the leading waves moved fast enough to avoid the bombardment. The foremost battalions of the 1st Guards Brigade found little opposition, apart from uncut wire, which was cut by the officers, while the men provided covering fire and fire from dug-outs along a sunken road on the extreme right flank. The first objective was rushed at and captured by The advance to the next objective took ten minutes, against &quot;slight&quot; opposition and the advance to the final objective was conducted against little resistance, the right-hand brigade digging-in on the east side of Lesbœufs by 

On the left flank, the 3rd Guards Brigade reached the first objective on the right but was delayed on the left until by Germans in a trench which had been missed by the artillery bombardment, before reaching the first objective. The neighbouring brigade of the 21st Division had been held up by uncut wire, so a defensive flank was formed; the rest of the brigade pressed on, arriving at the second objective at and the final objective at Touch was gained with the 6th Division north of Lesbœufs; a further advance in the evening was postponed due to the vulnerable northern flank, although the disarray seen among the German defenders further south, led local commanders to call for cavalry to exploit the &quot;rout&quot; they believed was occurring south of Gueudecourt, as British artillery inflicted many casualties on retreating parties of Germans.
To the north of XIV Corps, the 21st Division attacked on the right flank of XV Corps. Two battalions of the 64th Brigade on the right were held up by uncut wire at Gird Trench (), except for some troops who advanced on the extreme right, in company with the 3rd Guards Brigade. A reserve battalion moved forward to attack the second objective but got no further than the British front trench, due to German artillery fire. The 110th Brigade on the left of the 21st Division took Goat Trench and then machine-gun fire from the right held them up, before the leading battalions reached Gird Trench. Eventually a defensive flank was formed, facing south in part of the Ginchy–Gueudecourt road and a small number of troops got into Gird Trench and gained touch with the 55th (West Lancashire) Division, which had attacked with 165th Brigade and taken Gird Trench early in the afternoon, then gained a foothold in a sunken road between Gird Trench and Gueudecourt at , linking with the 21st Division on the right and the New Zealand Division on the left.

The 1st New Zealand Brigade was to form a defensive flank either side of Goose Alley, which ran from Flers Trench to the Gird Trenches, facing north-west towards Eaucourt l&#x27;Abbaye. The leading waves kept very close to the creeping barrage, advancing quickly against sparse German artillery fire and unusually feeble resistance from German infantry; a battalion headquarters was captured and a defensive flank was formed along Goose Alley to Gird Trench. Touch was gained with the 1st Division (III Corps) to the north in Flers Support Trench and later the 55th (West Lancashire) Division was met beyond Factory Corner to the south. In III Corps the 1st Division took of Flers Trench and the attacking brigade of the 50th (Northumbrian) Division, remained in posts beyond no man&#x27;s land, built the previous night. To the west the 68th Brigade of the 23rd Division attacked 26th Avenue with two tanks attached. One tank crossed the crest and attracted so much German artillery fire that the advance of the brigade was stopped. An attempt to bomb forward from west of Martinpuich Mill also failed.

====26 September====
In XIV Corps the 56th (1/1st London) Division probed towards Combles, arriving within by dawn, as other troops advanced into Bouleaux Wood, after seeing rockets fired at The 167th Brigade linked with the 5th Division south of Morval and met French patrols near the light railway at Troops moved forward and consolidated a new line about east of Combles, linking with the French on the right. An attack on Mutton Trench by the 168th Brigade was called off, after five tanks due to operate in support were ditched. XV Corps captured Gird Trench () and Gueudecourt when a fresh battalion of the 21st Division and a tank advanced up Pilgrim&#x27;s Way at and bombed down Gird Trench to the Guards Division. Infantry and cavalry patrols entered Gueudecourt and the high ground to the north. German artillery fire revived during the morning, forcing the Guards Division to consolidate as quickly as possible. A cavalry squadron tried to get forward near Gueudecourt but found the front of advance too narrow to manoeuvre.

Infantry probes beyond Lesbœufs, made little progress against a line of German machine-gun posts, on the higher ground west of Le Transloy. More cavalry advanced from Mametz and dismounted under fire at , to enter Gueudecourt from the south-west. The 110th Brigade (attached from the 37th Division) moved forward slowly and reached the village late in the afternoon. The 64th Brigade (21st Division) continued the advance with two battalions, to just short of the Gueudecourt–Le Transloy road, where a battalion from the 62nd Brigade passed through to the road and linked with the Guards Division at the junction with the Lesbœufs road. The 1st and 50th divisions of III Corps made a night attack on a new German trench at , the 1st Division was stopped by machine-gun fire and the 50th (Northumbrian) Division captured the west end, then bombed up Crescent Alley to Spence Trench.

====27 September====
XV Corps attacked with the 55th (West Lancashire) Division, which took Gird Trench and Goose Alley with a battalion of the 164th Brigade at The 1st Infantry Brigade of the New Zealand Division linked with the 55th (West Lancashire) Division in Gird Support Trench on the Ligny road, having taken then dug in on a reverse slope further forward, when it was found that Gird Support Trench was nearly obliterated. The New Zealand battalion in the centre advanced except on the left, where it was held up by uncut wire and the left battalion lost three companies to machine-gun fire beyond the road from Factory Corner to Eaucourt l&#x27;Abbaye. The fourth company established posts up Goose Alley, while the Germans managed to hold on to the junction of the Alley and Gird Trench (). In III Corps the 1st Division captured most of the rest of Flers Switch Trench and was relieved by the 47th (1/2nd London) Division that night. The 50th (Northumbrian) Division patrolled and established posts from Flers Trench (). The 23rd Division on the northern flank, took part of 26th Avenue near Spence Trench and linked with the Canadians of the Reserve Army on the Albert–Bapaume road.

====28–30 September====
The 56th (1/1st London) Division was relieved by the 20th and 6th divisions as the Morval area was handed over to the French Sixth Army. A XV Corps attack by the New Zealand Division was cancelled, because the un-captured part of Gird Trench was found to overlook the objective at Goose Alley. The junction of both Gird trenches and Goose Alley were found to be in a dip, which had not been seen on aerial photographs or marked on maps. The Germans were on the north and west slopes and the New Zealanders had reached the south and part of the western edges, which gave a commanding view of the German positions, making another attack redundant. The 41st Division relieved the 55th (West Lancashire) Division, III Corps consolidated and the left of the 23rd Division advanced with the Canadians of the Reserve Army; an attempt on Destremont Farm failed against a vigorous German defence using many machine-guns and bombs. The 6th and Guards divisions of XIV Corps, occupied empty German trenches beyond Lesbœufs.

An attempt by a company to close a gap north of the Lesbœufs–Le Transloy road, was stopped by more massed German machine-gun fire, before the Guards Division was relieved by the reserve brigade of the 56th (1/1st London) Division on the night of 30 September. In the III Corps area, on the northern flank of the Fourth Army, the 23rd Division attacked Destremont Farm at then linked with the 3rd Canadian Division on the army boundary. The 141st Brigade from the 47th (1/2nd London) Division relieved the 1st Division on the night of and pressed the Germans back beyond the Flers Switch Line at the second attempt. The New Zealand Division advanced on the right, also in preparation for the attack on Eaucourt l&#x27;Abbaye intended for 1 October. A German army order was found by New Zealand troops in the Gird Trenches (), which gave away the positions of German reserves in the area.

===Air operations===
Monday 25 September, was bright and cloudless, with a ground haze but reports from observers in contact patrol aircraft were notably accurate, as the infantry advanced to their objectives on the Fourth Army front, from Morval to Gueudecourt and around Flers. Observers in reconnaissance aircraft located artillery batteries; engaged and by zone calls. At observers watched the advance to the final objective and after twenty-one minutes, almost all of it was reported captured. A map compiled from air reports was later shown to be more accurate than infantry progress reports. The ground not taken near Morval fell in the evening, completing the capture of the ground on the main ridge, making Combles untenable, although British balloon observers were able to see that the French advance from the south had been delayed. There was extensive German air activity during the day but most aircraft flew above , which few British aircraft could reach.

German air operations had little effect on the British corps aircraft, which made contact patrols and artillery observation flights. Four German aircraft were shot down and others damaged for no loss but the superior speed of the newer German aeroplanes, allowed them to break off at will. Lagnicourt aerodrome was attacked by two British squadrons, causing damage to hangars and parked aircraft and a German headquarters was bombed at Manancourt. On 26 September, at an aircraft directed a bombardment on Gird Trench () then infantry bombed down the trench southwards; a tank advanced to the trench at and drove along with the infantry. After the defenders were forced back to within of the Guards Division, when the aircraft called for artillery fire until the tank and infantry arrived. The aircraft observer stopped the artillery and the aircraft strafed the Germans in the trench, causing to surrender, for a British loss of five casualties. The capture of Gird Trench opened the way into Gueudecourt and beyond by evening. Air reconnaissance around midday, established the position of British and French positions around Combles.

===German 1st Army===

====25 September====
Anglo-French attacks had been expected on 23 September, rather than 25 September and the timing of the attack for the afternoon, also wrong-footed some of the defenders. The 51st Reserve Division and the 52nd Reserve Division of the XXVI Reserve Corps were quickly pushed back, part of the 236th Reserve Regiment being &quot;destroyed&quot; at the tram line north of Bouleaux Wood. Parts of the 235th Reserve Regiment west of Combles and the 234th Reserve Regiment in the village, were threatened with encirclement by the British from the north and the French in the south. A battalion of the 239th Reserve Regiment of the 52nd Reserve Division was cut off in Morval and part of the regiment was overwhelmed north of the village near Lesbœufs. The rest of Lesbœufs, held by the 240th Reserve Regiment from the same division fell easily. Parts of the 51st and 52nd Reserve divisions counter-attacked Morval but were only able to advance a short distance and cover the withdrawal of their artillery, eventually forming new a line along the Le Transloy road east of Morval.

The 238th Reserve Regiment, on the right of the 52nd Reserve Division and the I Battalion of the neighbouring 6th Bavarian Regiment, on the left flank of the 6th Bavarian Division in the III Bavarian Corps area, were able to hold much of (Gird Trench) and Gueudecourt, because some of the defending machine-guns had survived the British bombardment, having been withdrawn from the front-line and hidden in shell-holes. The 6th Bavarian Regiment further north, was pushed back from into the village and southwards into the I Battalion area. North of Gueudecourt, two German battalions were conducting a relief when the British attack began and a battalion headquarters was captured along with engineer stores, in the confusion. The 50th Reserve Division, defending Eaucourt l&#x27;Abbaye and Le Sars, was able to hold the southern end of its part of (Flers Trench), which had not been captured during the attacks of 15 September, against British attempts to bomb up it to the north-west, although forced back towards further west near Martinpuich, south of the Bapaume–Albert road.

====26–28 September====
Bouchavesnes, Combles and Gueudecourt were lost and rearguards withdrew from Combles to the (Gird Trench), although some of the 234th and 235th Reserve regiments were cut off, many being killed making for Haie Wood. Troops of the 8th Division, brought from north of the Bapaume–Albert road, to counter-attack from Thilloy towards Gueudecourt, were engaged by sixty British field guns, causing the German infantry to &quot;flee&quot; in the direction of Le Transloy. The British aircraft-artillery-tank-infantry attack on near Gueudecourt, led to many of the survivors of the 238th Reserve Regiment and a battalion of the 6th Bavarian Regiment being captured. The 50th Reserve Division was pushed further back towards Eaucourt l&#x27;Abbaye and Le Sars, as the 6th Bavarian Division took over the defence of the area; next day a Bavarian regiment was attacked, while being relieved by part of the 7th Reserve Division near and managed to hold its ground despite many casualties on both sides.

==Aftermath==
===Analysis===

The battle was a considerable Anglo-French victory and as no tanks were used in the initial Fourth Army attack, a continuous creeping barrage was maintained. The objective of one German trench system, the original third line, which was less well-developed than the German defences on 15 September, was subjected to greater weight of shellfire. Rainfall from and the tempo of attacks, made it difficult for the Germans to improve their defences. Cavalry were even able to seize some tactical objectives and infantry kept well up to the creeping bombardment, limiting losses to in the ten British divisions engaged. French attacks in the south beyond Combles, made little progress against massed German artillery fire and Fayolle concluded that an extensive artillery preparation would be needed, to resume the attack around 

More German troops and artillery had arrived on the Somme front during September but their use in big counter-attacks south of the Somme from had disappointing results, failing to regain the ground lost since 12 September, with the French armies proving just as capable of inflicting huge losses on attackers as the Germans. During September, only of the men needed to replace German casualties could be found and men from the 1917 class, comb-outs from Germany, supply troops and were sent to front-line units. Limiting divisions to fourteen-day periods in the line required a fresh division each day and the acute shortage of troops led to German divisional reliefs becoming piecemeal again, which reduced efficiency and showed how close to collapse the German armies on the Somme had come. Ludendorff called the fighting of the biggest engagement of the battle.

A fourth line of defence was dug from Le Transloy to Ligny-Thilloy, a fifth one closer to Bapaume and work begun on a sixth line further east. Reverse slopes were chosen for the defences, to evade artillery fire directed by ground observers, which made more demands on Anglo-French air observation crews, during a period of rain and poor visibility. More and better German aircraft became available, which were used to challenge Anglo-French air superiority and a substantial amount of the German artillery at Verdun was brought to the Somme front. Despite ammunition shortages and inferior quality ammunition being supplied (caused by substitute materials being used in ammunition manufacture), more destructive fire was used to try to disrupt Allied infantry before they crossed no man&#x27;s land, rather than continue with wasteful, unobserved area bombardments. The Anglo-French had made important gains of ground and inflicted many casualties on the German armies but their advance in the Morval area had been contained, leading to more mutually costly fighting in the Battle of Le Transloy (1 October – 5 November) in colder and wetter autumnal weather.

===Casualties===

The 1st Division suffered from 20 September, the 5th Division from and the 6th Division reported from October. The 56th (1/1st London) Division had in September and the 55th (West Lancashire) Division from The New Zealand Division suffered from October. On 2 October, Haig estimated that there had been since 25 September in the Fourth and Reserve armies. The German 1st and 2nd armies suffered in September, the most costly month of the battle. Post war commentary in the German Official History and by Crown Prince Rupprecht, dwelt on the loss of so many of the remaining peace-trained officers, non-commissioned officers and infantry, particularly by an increased willingness to surrender.

<text>The Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine (VCOM) is a private osteopathic medical school on the campus of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia, with branch campuses in Spartanburg, South Carolina, Auburn, Alabama, and Monroe, Louisiana. VCOM also recently added Bluefield University to its list of campuses. Founded in 2002, VCOM graduated its first class of 139 students in June 2007.

According to the U.S. News &amp; World Report, VCOM was the second-largest medical school in the U.S. in 2021, with a total enrollment of 2,122 students among its four campuses.

VCOM is an osteopathic medical school, which grants the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree (DO), and one of four located in the Appalachian region. It is accredited by the American Osteopathic Association&#x27;s Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation.

==History==
The school was founded in 2001 when Virginia Tech and the Harvey W. Peters Research Foundation worked together to start up a new private school of osteopathic medicine called the Edward Via Virginia College of Osteopathic Medicine (VCOM). In June 2007, VCOM graduated its inaugural class of 139 students. The college was originally named the Edward Via Virginia College of Osteopathic Medicine, which was later shortened to its present name.

VCOM is incorporated as a private, non-profit institution and has a collaborative agreement with Virginia Tech and Auburn University for education, research, and student activities.

In 2010, the school founded its second campus in Spartanburg, South Carolina, with classes starting in September 2011. VCOM-Carolinas graduated its first class in May 2015.

In 2012, the school announced plans to establish a third campus in collaboration with Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama, with classes starting in the fall of 2015.

Medical graduates of VCOM receive a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degree and obtain medical licensure by the same boards as graduates with an MD by participating in the same residency programs as their MD peers. The osteopathic curriculum entails additional training in a technique called osteopathic manipulative medicine besides conventional medicine and surgery. While graduates of VCOM may pursue any field of medicine, students typically pursue primary care to serve a rural population.

==Academics==
The first and second years of medical school at VCOM are primarily classroom-based and focus on the basic sciences. The school uses a system of &quot;blocks&quot; as opposed to semesters, with eight blocks occurring within the first two years. Each block concerns a specific organ system, incorporating anatomy, physiology, microbiology, pharmacology, pathology, and osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) courses concerning that system. The third and fourth years of training are clinically oriented, where students complete rotations, or clerkships, through various specialties of medicine. While students at VCOM are educated in all basic medical sciences (as are their M.D. counterparts), VCOM students also receive approximately 200 extra hours of musculoskeletal/neuromuscular training.

==Patient care==
VCOM has permanent medical clinics located in Veron, Dominican Republic, Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and El Salvador.

==Campuses==
VCOM currently operates five campuses: Blacksburg, Carolinas, Auburn, Monroe, and Bluefield

VCOM-Virginia is located on 13 acres within the campus of Virginia Tech, in the Virginia Tech Corporate Research Center. The college operates within a public/private collaboration with Virginia Tech, sharing resources for education, research, and student activities. On campus, the main building consists of 60,000 square feet. The Center for Simulation and Technology is located within a 22,000-square-foot building, where training occurs with simulated patient encounters in several specialties.

VCOM-Carolinas is located on the edge of historic downtown Spartanburg, South Carolina. The campus is approximately 70,000 square feet and is situated on an 18-acre campus. Facility features include a state-of-the-art anatomy lab and the Center for Simulation and Technology, offering standardized patient and manikin-based simulation education.

VCOM-Auburn is a 100,000-square-foot, four-story, state-of-the-art campus situated on 16 acres located on the Auburn University Campus, in Auburn, Alabama. The campus offers the nurturing feel of a small private college but with access to the resources and activities of a larger university community. The collaborative partnership with Auburn University student activities, events, research, and the arts.

VCOM-Louisiana The fourth VCOM campus, which is a 100,000-square-foot, $31 million building on the campus of University of Louisiana at Monroe was completed in the spring of 2020. Between 150-162 medical students enrolled in fall 2020.

Bluefield University merged with VCOM in March 2020. Bluefield University is a Baptist liberal arts college located in Bluefield, Virginia. The merger will allow Bluefield to continue to focus on its Christ-centered education but also focus on a health sciences curriculum.

==Relationship with host institutions==
The Virginia Campus is located in the Corporate Research Center, adjacent to the Virginia Tech campus. As a part of a long-term agreement, students are granted the same benefits as Virginia Tech students in terms of use of the library, recreational facilities, student center, arts and theatre programs, intramural programs, and access to Virginia Tech football and other athletic event tickets. The school features Tech&#x27;s &quot;Hokie Bird&quot; mascot as its own, however, the school is private and receives no state support from Virginia. Additionally, the official medical school of Virginia Tech is the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute granting the M.D. degree, which is located in Virginia Tech&#x27;s Roanoke, Virginia campus.

The Carolinas Campus, until 2014, had a similar relationship with the private Wofford College but currently participates in the &quot;College Town Consortium&quot; with five other local colleges. The annual White Coat Ceremony for first-year medical students is held at nearby Converse College.

The Auburn Campus is located in the Auburn Research Park in Auburn, Alabama, and has a partnership with Auburn University. The partnership is similar to that of Virginia Tech, students can use nearby facilities but they are separate entities. The campus started offering classes in the Fall of 2015.

Academic Sports and Osteopathic Medicine, in Blacksburg, Virginia are affiliated with VCOM-Virginia.

In 2017, VCOM–Carolinas will open Northside direct primary care, a college-affiliated clinic located on campus in Spartanburg, South Carolina. The clinic will be operated in part by Palmetto Proactive and will be staffed by VCOM faculty physicians.

==Graduate medical education==
VCOM operates three fellowship programs, geriatric medicine, sports medicine, and osteopathic neuromusculoskeletal medicine. All programs are accredited by the American Osteopathic Association. In addition, VCOM operates a residency program in family medicine in collaboration with Johnston Memorial Hospital

== Research ==
VCOM conducts multidisciplinary research in biomedical, clinical, and community-based settings. Specific areas of research include Sports Medicine, Concussion and Brain Trauma, Primary Care, Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine, and Infectious Disease. Supported by the Bradley Foundation, VCOM amplified its research in cancer, heart, and neurological diseases as well as bioinformatics and primary care, by creating the Center for Bioinformatics and Genetics and the Primary Care Research Network. Funding for new research projects is provided in part by competitive internal funding programs, including the Research Eureka Accelerator Program (REAP) and the One Health Program.

<doc id="1310248" wikidata="Q1998995" url="?curid=1310248" title="Battle of Thiepval Ridge">
<text>The Battle of Thiepval Ridge was the first large offensive of the Reserve Army (Lieutenant General Hubert Gough), during the Battle of the Somme on the Western Front during the First World War. The attack was intended to benefit from the Fourth Army attack in the Battle of Morval, by starting afterwards. The battle was fought on a front from Courcelette in the east, near the Albert–Bapaume road, to Thiepval and the Schwaben Redoubt () in the west, which overlooked the German defences further north in the Ancre valley, the rising ground towards Beaumont-Hamel and Serre beyond.

Thiepval Ridge was well fortified and the German defenders fought with great determination, while the British co-ordination of infantry and artillery declined after the first day, due to the confused nature of the fighting in the mazes of trenches, dugouts and shell-craters. The final British objectives were not reached until a reorganisation of the Reserve Army and the Battle of the Ancre Heights (1 October – 11 November). Organisational difficulties and deteriorating weather frustrated General Joseph Joffre&#x27;s intention to proceed with vigorous co-ordinated attacks by the Anglo-French armies, which became disjointed and declined in effectiveness during late September, at the same time as a revival occurred in the German defence. The British experimented with new techniques in gas warfare, machine-gun bombardment and tank–infantry co-operation. The German defenders on the Somme front struggled to withstand the preponderance of men and material fielded by the Anglo–French, despite reorganisation and substantial reinforcement of troops, artillery and aircraft from Verdun. September became the month most costly in casualties for the German armies on the Somme.
==Background==
===Tactical developments===
Some debate had occurred among the Reserve Army staffs on attack tactics. The II Corps commander, Lieutenant-General Claud Jacob, advocated attacks by one line, to avoid supporting lines being caught in German counter-bombardments on the British front-line and no man&#x27;s land, which usually fell after the beginning of British attacks. Jacob considered that the supporting lines played little part in the success of the attack and merely added to casualties. Jacob also advocated afternoon attacks, since the six made by his corps had succeeded and the two dawn attacks had failed. The Reserve Army commander, Lieutenant-General Hubert Gough, was less certain but did lay stress on the supports crossing the danger zone swiftly. Gough also used the evidence of a film of an attack on 18 September, to decide against infantry advancing in groups, because of their vulnerability to artillery and because German defences in the gaps between groups were unsuppressed, allowing them to cut off the forward infantry and stop the advance of supporting groups and troops on the flanks.

==Prelude==

===British offensive preparations===

The 18th (Eastern) Division (Major-General Ivor Maxse), moved south after three weeks&#x27; battle training in the Third Army area, joining II Corps on 8 September. All company, battalion and brigade commanders reconnoitred the ground and a lecture was given by Brigadier-General Philip Howell, the II Corps Chief of Staff. Howell briefed the division on the local situation and recent experience which the unit commanders found helpful, having only been in Flanders since August. Two divisional field artilleries were attached to the division and II Corps put a battery of howitzers and four tanks at the disposal of the divisional commander. On 21 September, the trenches south of Thiepval were taken over from the 49th (West Riding) Division and work begun to prepare them for the attack. Royal Engineer field companies, pioneers and two battalions of infantry dug about of assembly and communication trenches and existing positions were also improved; supply dumps were prepared over four nights of digging. The road from Authuille to Thiepval was repaired and hidden behind a brushwood screen, which enabled supplies to be moved up and wounded to be brought down, with little German shelling. The division arranged a stratagem, whereby the assembly and Hindenburg trenches were to be left empty after the first waves had advanced and the reserve battalion held back, to avoid the German counter-barrage. As soon as the counter-barrage stopped the troops were to advance rapidly in small columns.

===British plan of attack===
General Sir Douglas Haig, Commander-in-chief (C-in-C) of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front, directed the Reserve Army to attack towards Achiet le Grand and the Third Army to stand ready to attack at Gommecourt as a flank guard. Gough, ordered the attack for 26 September at to push the Germans off the high ground of the Thiepval Ridge, from Courcelette west to Schwaben Redoubt, by the Canadian Corps (Lieutenant-General Julian Byng) and II Corps, each with two divisions in the attack. Three stages were set for the advance, with halts of ten minutes and one hour before the final advance. The Canadian Corps was to provide a flank guard on the right, by taking the German trenches on the spur north-west of Courcelette, the right of II Corps was to take Redoubt in the second stage of the advance and Stuff Redoubt at the final objective on the crest of the ridge. On the left the corps was to take Thiepval in the second stage and then reach Redoubt, which overlooked the slope down to St Pierre Divion. It was emphasised that the Germans were to be driven off the crest, to deny the Germans observation towards Albert and gain observation over the Ancre valley. The German front line west of Thiepval was to be captured during the advance.

About guns, howitzers and mortars with guns and howitzers were available, the guns of V Corps north of the Ancre, being used to fire on the German river crossings and trenches on the south bank from behind. II Corps artillery was to pay special attention the demoralisation of the German garrisons of the redoubts and Thiepval village, while certain German trenches intended for the British infantry to occupy were not bombarded sufficiently for destruction. Two changes were introduced into the artillery plan, gas shell was to be fired by mortars and the machine guns of both attacking corps, were arranged to fire overhead barrages into the gaps between the artillery barrage lines. The creeping barrage was to move at in three minutes, then at in two minutes, when no man&#x27;s land and the German front position had been crossed. Six of the eight tanks available were allotted to II Corps. Divisional reliefs were to be delayed to keep the attacking troops fresh, beginning on the night of on the right and on the left. Zero hour was set for the afternoon instead of dawn, because Maxse wanted only three hours of daylight for the consolidation on the final objective, so that most of the work would be done after dark, to avoid exposure to observed artillery fire. The Thiepval attack was to be followed by an attack astride the Ancre River. Orders for the capture of more objectives and to gain ground at every opportunity, were issued on 28 September and were intended to combine with the Fourth Army attacks planned for early October, which became known as the Battle of Le Transloy; Stuff and redoubts were to be captured by 29 September and Stuff Trench by 1 October.

===German preparations===
The German front position was held by the 7th Division, 8th Division and the 26th Reserve Division, from Courcelette westwards to Thiepval. The village was garrisoned by two regiments, one attached from the 2nd Guard Reserve Division; the ground from Thiepval to St Pierre Divion was held by a regiment detached from the 52nd Division. The German front position on the south face of Thiepval was about in front of the village; about back was the second line, (&quot;Stuff Trench&quot; to the British and &quot;Regina Trench&quot; to the Canadians) about and another further back was the third line, (Grandcourt Trench). The cellars under Thiepval Château had been extended into a complex of tunnels used as storehouses and shelters. A sunken road running up the middle of the village to the cemetery had been lined with dug-outs and in the original front-line to the west were dug-outs.
Thiepval had been held by Württemberg Infantry Regiment 180 (WIR 180) since 1914, which still contained many pre-war trained soldiers. The regiment had not been moved and was allowed to make its own arrangements, using Bapaume as a base. Redoubt guarded the first line between Courcelette and Thiepval, (Stuff) and redoubts anchored the west end of the first and second lines. Mouquet Farm, to the east of Thiepval, had become dangerously isolated, beyond any support trenches, connected only by a half-demolished trench. The losses incurred in its defence weakened the garrison in the area, for little corresponding gain. Beyond the south-west of Thiepval, the original German front position ran northwards to St Pierre Divion and the Ancre. The German garrisons were alerted that an attack was imminent on 22 September and German artillery began harassing fire on British trenches and supply dumps. The British assembly for the attack early on 26 September went undisturbed.

==Battle==
===Reserve Army===

====23–26 September====

The preliminary bombardment began on 23 September in poor visibility and mist rose morning and evening for the next few days. II Corps fired artillery and artillery rounds. On the afternoon of 24 September a detachment of the Special Brigade fired (gas) shells into Thiepval, which silenced German trench mortars by A preliminary operation to capture Mouquet Farm began on the evening of 24 September, when a company from the 11th Division reached the farm, before a German bombardment and a bombing attack covered by accurate machine-gun fire, forced the British back. The creeping barrage began prompt at on 26 September and the infantry began their advance.

On the right flank, the Canadian Corps attacked with the 6th Canadian Brigade of the 2nd Canadian Division on the right, as flank guard and the 1st Canadian Division on the left. At the 6th Canadian Brigade advanced behind a creeping barrage with three battalions and two attached tanks, though a German counter-barrage kept the right-hand battalion in its trenches. Both tanks were lost early but the 29th Canadian Battalion in the centre reached the German front line in ten minutes, while the left battalion was stopped by machine-gun fire from ahead and the left flank, except for a few troops on the right. At the objective was captured from Twenty Road, westwards to the east end of Miraumont Road and held against two counter-attacks during the night.
The 1st Canadian Division attacked with two brigades. The right brigade with two battalions advanced to Sudbury Trench and resumed the advance at reaching Kenora Trench on the right which ran north-west back to Regina/Stuff Trench by The battalion on the left had been delayed; German bombers counter-attacked the flank and were repulsed. The left battalion had formed up in no man&#x27;s land to escape the German counter-barrage but had a harder fight to reach their objectives, taking until mid-afternoon to reach the second objective, which was just short of the ridge crest, linking with the left brigade later. The left brigade advanced with two reinforced battalions, which received machine-gun fire from the left flank but reached Trench, taking the western part after a delay. At the advance resumed towards Hessian Trench, which was taken easily. Touch was gained with the right brigade but contact with the 11th Division on the left was not gained. The Canadians bombed down Trench and built a barricade, as machine-gun fire forced a slight withdrawal from the left part of Hessian Trench, a defensive flank being thrown back from Hessian to Trench and dug in by 
West of the Canadian Corps, II Corps attacked with the 11th and 18th (Eastern) divisions. The 11th Division advanced with two brigades. The 34th Brigade on the right attacked with two battalions; a bombing party attacking Mouquet Farm just before zero and then guarding the dugout exits. Both battalions got to the German support trench (first objective) although one of the supporting battalions was caught by the German counter-barrage at the British front-line. The right-hand battalion became bogged down fighting through Redoubt and most of the moppers-up were killed. About dug in on the right facing Trench, while others sheltered to the west of the redoubt. The left battalion was caught by machine-gun fire from Redoubt and Midway Line, which ran from Mouquet Farm to Redoubt, north of Thiepval. A few troops reached Trench and the remnants of the support battalion advanced to reinforce them.

The battle for Mouquet Farm continued; two attached tanks ditched nearby and the machine-guns from one tank were removed and the crew carried on as infantry. Reinforcements were sent forward (including a pioneer battalion) and at the last surrendered, after being attacked with smoke bombs. The 33rd Brigade on the left attacked from Nab Valley with two battalions, reached Joseph Trench at and advanced to Trench between Mouquet Farm and the east end of Thiepval where they dug in. Trench was reached by and Hessian Trench by except for the on the right. Touch was gained on the left with the 18th (Eastern) Division at Trench and Midway Line was mopped up by a reserve battalion which also reinforced Hessian Trench, repelling a German counter-attack on the right.

The 18th (Eastern) Division attacked with two battalions of the 53rd Brigade on the right from Nab Valley with a battalion following-on. The plan to avoid the German counter-barrage worked and the first objective, at Trench on the right and the Pozières–St Pierre Divion road on the left, was reached in Two tanks advanced in support but quickly ditched as the battalions advanced again, reaching Trench by against slight resistance. The advance was stopped by German machine-gun fire after another and the troops fell back to Trench at dark and then tried to bomb forward. The 54th Brigade attacked on a narrow front, with one battalion going through the village, a company advancing along the original German front line, with the other two battalions in support and reserve following on. The advanced troops moved forward before zero hour to avoid the German artillery and two tanks advanced from Caterpillar Copse. The advance through Thiepval went slowly, being held up by machine-gun fire from the château ruins, until a tank came up and suppressed the German machine-guns, before ditching a short time later. The infantry lost the barrage but fought on through the village until by all but the north-west corner was captured.

====27–30 September====

After a German artillery bombardment on the 6th Brigade, 2nd Canadian Division all night and the morning of 27 September, patrols found that the Germans had withdrawn and the brigade advanced to the German practice trenches up Dyke Road, running north-east from Courcelette and occupied the rest of the first objective. The 1st Canadian Division was counter-attacked at Kenora Trench in the early hours and was forced back until an attack re-occupied the trench. Around a German bombing attack nearly retook the trench, until repulsed at the last moment; later the Canadians withdrew to the support trench and then made a counter-attack at which failed. In the II Corps area, the 11th Division found the Redoubt empty. Trench was occupied westwards to the junction with Midway Line and eastwards to link with the Canadians. An advance due at was stopped by machine-gun fire from Stuff Redoubt and Hessian Trench. The 32nd Brigade in reserve was ordered to continue the attack at 

The attack was postponed but one of the two battalions attacked and reached the south side of Stuff Redoubt. An hour later Hessian Trench to the west was captured and at a battalion began bombing forward from Redoubt to the north-west. The left brigade attacked eastwards during the morning, linked with the 34th Brigade and at the rest of Hessian Trench was occupied. The 53rd Brigade on the right of the 18th (Eastern) Division consolidated Trench, then took part of Trench behind a Stokes mortar barrage. Unit reliefs were completed quickly in the 54th Brigade on the left and the attack through Thiepval resumed at in company with a 146th Brigade battalion of the 49th (West Riding) Division, in the original British front line west of Thiepval. All of Thiepval had been captured by and touch gained with the 53rd Brigade, 146th Brigade being relieved by a 25th Division brigade overnight.

On 28 September, a cavalry patrol moved forward on the right of the 6th Brigade, 2nd Canadian Division at dawn but was quickly stopped by machine-gun fire. The brigade dug in facing north-east beyond the German practice trenches and a battalion advanced north up Courcelette Trench, meeting much German machine-gun fire from Regina Trench. Two more attempts were made in the afternoon and another in the evening at which failed. During the night, the four Canadian brigades engaged were relieved by the 4th and 8th brigades. In II Corps the 32nd Brigade took over on the right of the 11th Division, ready to take Stuff Redoubt and Hessian Trench at but the attack was delayed. A bombing attack into the rest of Stuff Redoubt gained ground but this was later abandoned. The 18th (Eastern) Division was to attack Redoubt at , the right brigade along Trench to Midway Line, while an extra battalion attacked the redoubt and a battalion from the 54th Brigade attacked on the left, down to the original front line.

Bulgar Trench was taken quickly but the Germans in Midway Line held out longer. By the east end of Redoubt was approached and touch was gained on the right with the 11th Division. Troops later reached the south-west corner of the redoubt and by the south side of the redoubt had been captured and linked with the troops in Midway Line to the right, as the left gained touch with mixed groups from the 54th Brigade. The west of the redoubt was taken by and patrols from the 49th (West Riding) Division occupied parts of the German front line, then met the troops on the left of the 54th Brigade. Grenade skirmishes occurred intermittently during the night and a battalion from the 55th Brigade took over the front of the 54th Brigade.

On 29 September, the 8th Brigade from the 3rd Canadian Division attacked at noon with the 11th Division on the left and reached Hessian Trench in places, which were lost and then regained during German shelling and counter-attacks. In the II Corps area, the 11th Division attacked Stuff Redoubt and Hessian Trench to the right, most of which were captured and touch gained with the Canadians, while the attack on the redoubt failed. After battalion reliefs in the 18th (Eastern) Division, a bombing fight began around along the western edge of Redoubt, which lasted all day; the ground gained could not be held and the battalion later relieved troops in the captured German front system. On 30 September, the 11th Division resumed the attack on Stuff Redoubt at with bombing parties advancing west along Hessian Trench and along Trench, which by nightfall had taken the southern half of the redoubt. Canadian bombers assisted the capture of Hessian Trench and the division was relieved by the 25th Division overnight. A dawn counter-attack drove the 18th (Eastern) Division from the south and west sides of Redoubt; the south side was recaptured and the north side of the redoubt was taken at Another German attack at retook the north face, up to the entrance to Stuff Trench on the right.

===Air operations===

4 Squadron and 7 Squadron made a number of low reconnaissance flights to observe the condition of the German wire and trenches before the attack. GHQ Wing and Corps squadron air observers on contact patrol, watched the infantry advance behind the creeping barrage and enter Thiepval with two tanks, which prompted some German soldiers to run away. At British troops were photographed in Hessian Trench and air observers were able to report the capture of Thiepval, save for the north-west corner. Artillery observers in aircraft and observation balloons reported German batteries in the first and identified the positions of . Ground observers were able to engage six German batteries, while air observation allowed another be bombarded. South of Miraumont a 4 Squadron air observer reported German troops on the road, who were scattered by British heavy artillery. The squadrons of IV and V Brigades dropped a hundred and thirty-five 20-pound bombs on trenches, artillery and billets as III Brigade bombed Lagnicourt aerodrome despite poor visibility and attacked German kite balloons, 60 Squadron Nieuports shooting down two with Le Prieur rockets and bombing grounded balloons with phosphorus bombs. 19 Squadron attacked a German divisional headquarters at Barastre with bombs. Two German aircraft were shot down and four damaged for the loss of one British aircraft over Bapaume but the faster German machines were able to avoid contact at will.
Next day British offensive patrols met numerous German formations in the morning, before heavy rain interrupted flying. Six aircraft of 27 Squadron were attacked by five Albatros D.I of () led by Oswald Boelcke, which shot down three and damaged one of the Martinsydes. Another British aircraft was lost on an early morning railway reconnaissance by 70 Squadron. On 28 September V Brigade aircraft reported the British advances at Redoubt and directed artillery fire on pits and blew up nine ammunition stores. Few German aircraft appeared but two were shot down and two damaged, one of the aircraft being shot down by a new Spad S.VII, flown by a pilot of 60 Squadron. Poor weather grounded most aircraft on 29 September but next day was clear, photographs were obtained and low reconnaissance observed the state of German trenches and wire. With the capture of Stuff Redoubt and most of Redoubt, the denial of air observation to the Germans became more important and eleven aircraft raided Lagnicourt aerodrome again, escorted by 11 Squadron and 60 Squadron. Many German aircraft were able to take off and attack the British aircraft as they returned, three German aircraft being shot down and one damaged for a loss of one F.E. 2b.

===German 1st Army===

The 7th Division near Courcelette had all three regiments forward, with a battalion each in the front, support and reserve lines. The front trenches next to the Albert–Bapaume road were lost quickly, while Infantry Regiment 72 (IR 72) in the centre held its ground and the right-hand regiment was pushed back slowly, having managed to ambush the Canadians by occupying (Fabeck Trench) in no man&#x27;s land, which the British artillery planners had ignored, thinking that it was derelict. The Germans were quickly outflanked and the fifty survivors surrendered at The Canadians pressed forward on both flanks and quickly overran (Zollern Trench). By IR 72 had both flanks in the air, when reinforcements from the support battalion made a defensive flank along the sunken part of the Courcelette–Miraumont road, south of (Stuff Trench) and the rest joined Reserve Infantry Regiment 393 on the left flank.

At dusk the British artillery turned into a moonscape, while British aircraft machine-gunned the trench from . A Canadian attack was repulsed and a second attempt at midnight was stopped with the help of reinforcements. The Canadians had pressed forward on both flanks and got round either side of and the east end of , (Hessian Trench) which fell when the front and support battalions of IR 26 were annihilated, few soldiers making it back to , to hold the of the trench that the regiment was responsible for but they managed to stop the Canadian advance all afternoon, except for the loss of of the trench near the Courcelette–Grandcourt road. After dark the 7th Division withdrew south to and east to cover Pys in the (Below Position).

IR 93, 8th Division, held the defences from Redoubt and part of to the east edge of Thiepval, with supports in and . IR 165 continued the line west along (Mouquet Trench) to the Thiepval–Pozières road, with a company in Mouquet Farm and the support battalions in (Green Redoubt), (Midway Line) and and IR 153 held from the Pozières road to the east edge of Thiepval with the supports in and . The defence of IR 153 on the outskirts of Thiepval collapsed when three tanks appeared, proving to be immune to machine-gun fire and hand-grenades. All battalions of German troops in the area of (Big Trench) and , were overrun by British infantry, hardly any escaping. Dust and smoke from the artillery hung in the air during the afternoon and shrouded the British infantry advance to , where two reserve companies held them up.

The German defence on either side was outflanked, on the left Mouquet Farm was surrounded (and held out until ). was captured, IR 165 to the left being forced back along . The Germans in Redoubt held on, helped by an accurate counter-barrage falling beyond. A British artillery battery which tried to unlimber to the south-west, was knocked out with machine-gun fire. After another bombardment, the British resumed the attack at and were repulsed. Canadian troops advancing to the left began to threaten the left flank, as British troops got past on the right and then caused the survivors to withdraw to . During the night was made the first line and ground still occupied in front of it was to be held by advanced posts. By early morning the new divisional front line had been established between and , touch on the left being gained at the Grandcourt–Courcelette road with the right of the 7th Division and the right being extended to the .

Infantry Regiment 180 (IR 180) of the 26th Reserve Division held Thiepval with part of Reserve Infantry Regiment 77; Redoubt and the old front line north-west to St Pierre Divion were held by Infantry Regiment 66. The support and reserve battalions were in , and . The digging of British assembly trenches was seen before the attack, alerting the defenders and the first two waves of British infantry were shot down. A tank appeared from Authuille Wood leading a third wave, which collected survivors of the first two and came close to the German position, just as IR 180 companies on the south and west sides of the Thiepval defences, were attacked from behind by British bombers moving west. Some British troops reached (Bulgar Trench) behind Thiepval, where the support companies managed to stop the British moving further west. In the British had also reached and probed beyond . At a carrier pigeon arrived at the 26th Reserve Division headquarters, with a message that eighteen men were left in the I Battalion dug-out. The Thiepval garrison lost about casualties and the survivors rallied astride the Thiepval–Grandcourt road, from and to the .

===French operations===
Careful planning for the combined attack at Morval was necessary, due to the French Sixth Army advance diverging east and north-east. The new attack northwards to keep touch with the British, needed reinforcements of troops and artillery, which were taken from the Tenth Army further south. Artillery and aircraft were brought from Verdun and XXXII Corps took over on the right of I Corps. The Sixth Army was to advance close to the line Moislains–Le Transloy. Foch intervened on 25 September, to ensure that I Corps and XXXII Corps attacked north to Sailly-Saillisel, with V Corps as right flank guard. The big attacks on the afternoons of September took little ground in the face of very heavy German artillery fire. Fayolle concluded that an extensive artillery preparation would be needed before resuming the attack.

==Aftermath==
===Analysis===
German accounts of the battle conclude that the break-ins north-west of Courcelette and just east of Thiepval led to the defeat. Lack of reserves forced the 7th Division to retreat in the east and the success of the British 11th Division allowed Thiepval to be outflanked from the right, with the loss of the village and most of the garrison, the British advancing on the front attacked. The British pushed on in the next few days towards Stuff and redoubts, where the Germans were eventually dislodged in the Battle of the Ancre Heights, which began on 1 October. Apart from here and at Sailly-Saillisel in the French Sixth Army area, Bazentin ridge had been captured, giving ground observation of the upper Ancre river and the spurs and valleys on the north bank. The British made better use of their artillery, while German artillery ammunition consumption in September rose to shells from in August but had less effect, much of the ammunition being used inefficiently on unobserved area bombardments, while defensive barrage fire was limited to three-minute periods; up to the German guns became unserviceable in battle due to mechanical failure.

===Casualties===

The 1st Canadian Division losses from were the 11th Division losses from were (about the men being wounded). Casualties in the 18th (Eastern) Division were German losses are uncertain but September is considered to be the most costly month of the battle, with The Germans lost casualties of the by the Reserve Army from along with and mortars.

===Subsequent operations===
British operations concluded on 30 September, with the capture of a large portion of the Redoubt, north of Thiepval, another first day objective which had been attacked by the 36th (Ulster) Division. In the Battle of the Ancre Heights, which began on 1 October, the final objectives of the Battle of Thiepval were reached; on 14 October the rest of Redoubt was captured and the Canadian Corps completed the capture of Regina Trench on 11 November.

==Commemoration==

Because of the significance that the positions at Thiepval as a first-day objective, which was not captured until almost three months later, the high ground on the point of the Thiepval Spur was selected to be the location of the Anglo-French memorial to the &quot;missing of the Somme&quot;. The Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme is dedicated to the men who were killed and whose bodies were never recovered, during the fighting in the vicinity from 1916 to 1918. The piers of the memorial bear the names of over soldiers, who were killed on the Somme battlefields &quot;but to whom the fortunes of war denied the known and honoured burial given to their comrades in death&quot;.

<text>The Battle of Le Transloy was the last big attack by the Fourth Army of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in the 1916 Battle of the Somme in France, during the First World War. The battle was fought in conjunction with attacks by the French Tenth and Sixth armies on the southern flank and the Reserve/5th Army on the northern flank, against Army Group Rupprecht of Bavaria () created on 28 August. General Ferdinand Foch, commander of (GAN, Northern Army Group) and co-ordinator of the armies on the Somme, was unable to continue the sequential attacks of September because persistent rain, mist and fog grounded aircraft, turned the battlefield into a swamp and greatly increased the difficulty of transporting supplies to the front over the roads land devastated since 1 July.

The German armies on the Somme managed a recovery after the string of defeats in September, with fresh divisions to replace exhausted troops and more aircraft, artillery and ammunition diverted from Verdun or stripped from other parts of the Western Front. Command of the German Air Service () was centralised and the new (German Air Force) was able to challenge Anglo-French air superiority with the reinforcements and new, superior, fighter aircraft. The German flyers further reduced the ability of the Anglo-French airmen to support the armies with artillery-observation and contact patrols in the rare periods of clear weather.

The German armies lost much less ground and had fewer casualties in October than in September but the proportion of casualties increased from of the Anglo-French total. Rain, fog and mud were lesser problems for the Germans, who had to carry supplies forward over a much narrower beaten zone and were being forced back onto undamaged ground. German bombardments on the few roads between the original front line and the line in October increased the difficulties of the British and French armies; the size and ambition of Anglo-French attacks was reduced progressively to local operations.

Every soldier endured miserable conditions but the Germans knew that the onset of winter would end the battle, despite the many extra casualties caused by illness. The British and French outnumbered the Germans and could relieve divisions after shorter periods in the line. Severe criticism of General Sir Douglas Haig and General Henry Rawlinson during and since the war for persisting with attacks on October, was challenged in 2009 by William Philpott, who put the British share of the battle into the context of strategic subordination to French wishes, the concept of a general Allied offensive established by Joffre and the continuation of French attacks south of Le Transloy which had to be supported by British operations. In a 2017 publication, Jack Sheldon translated overlooked German material on the ordeal endured by the German armies.
==Background==

===Strategic developments===
In September, Foch had managed to organise sequential attacks by the four Anglo-French armies on the Somme, which had captured more ground than any previous month and inflicted the worst monthly casualties on the Germans of the battle. During the Battle of Morval , the French Sixth Army (General Émile Fayolle) had crossed the Péronne–Bapaume road around Bouchavesnes, the Fourth Army (General Henry Rawlinson) had taken Morval, Lesbœufs and Gueudecourt in the centre and the Reserve Army (Lieutenant-General Hubert Gough), which became the Fifth Army on 30 October, had captured most of Thiepval Ridge on the left flank. On 29 September, General Sir Douglas Haig instructed the Fourth Army to plan operations to advance towards Bapaume, reaching Le Transloy on the right and Loupart Wood north of the Albert–Bapaume road on the left. The Reserve Army was to extend the attacks of the Fourth Army by making converging attacks on the Ancre valley after the Battle of Thiepval Ridge by attacking northwards towards Loupart Wood, Irles and Miraumont on the south bank.
On 28 August, the Chief of the General Staff General Erich von Falkenhayn simplified the German command structure on the Western Front by establishing two army groups. was dissolved and General Max von Gallwitz reverted to the command of the 2nd Army. controlled the 6th, 1st and 2nd armies, from the Belgian coast to the boundary of , south of the Somme. The emergency in Russia caused by the Brusilov Offensive, the entry of Rumania into the war and French counter-attacks at Verdun put further strain on the German army. Falkenhayn had been sacked from (OHL) on 29 August and replaced by Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff. This &quot;Third&quot; OHL ordered an end to attacks at Verdun and the despatch of troops to Rumania and the Somme front. Colonel Fritz von Loßberg, Chief of Staff of the 2nd Army, was also able to establish (relief divisions) behind the battlefield, ready to replace tired divisions.

German counter-attacks became bigger and more frequent, making the Anglo-French advance slower and more costly. After the Anglo-French attacks in mid-September, a comprehensive relief of the front-line divisions had been possible. On 5 September, proposals for a shorter line to be built in France were ordered from the commanders of the western armies, who met Hindenburg and Ludendorff at Cambrai on 8 September; the new leadership announced that no reserves were available for offensive operations, except those planned for Rumania. Ludendorff condemned the policy of holding ground regardless of its tactical value and advocated holding front-line positions with the minimum of troops and to recapture lost positions by counter-attacks. On 21 September, after the battle of Flers–Courcelette Hindenburg ordered that the Somme front was to have priority in the west for troops. During September, the Germans had sent another thirteen fresh divisions to the British sector and scraped up troops wherever they could be found. The German artillery had fired of field artillery shells and of heavy artillery ammunition, yet the début of the tank, the defeat at Thiepval and the suffered by the armies on the Somme in September, had been severe blows to German morale.

===Tactical developments===

German artillery on the Somme slowly improved in its effect, when Gallwitz centralised counter-battery fire and used aircraft reinforcements for artillery observation, which increased the accuracy and efficiency of bombardments. The 2nd Army had been starved of reinforcements in mid-August, to replace exhausted divisions in the 1st Army and plans for a counter-stroke had been abandoned for lack of troops. Reinforcements for the Somme front in September began to reduce the German inferiority in guns and aircraft. Field artillery reduced its barrage frontage from per battery and increased its accuracy by using one air artillery flight () per division. As the Germans had been pushed out of their original defences, Loßberg established new positions based on principles of depth, dispersal and camouflage, rather than continuous lines of trenches. Rigid defence of the front-line continued but with as few soldiers as possible, relying on the firepower of machine-guns firing from behind the front-line and from the flanks. The area behind the front-line was defended by support and reserve units, dispersed on reverse slopes, undulations and in any other cover that could be found, so that they could open machine-gun fire by surprise, from unseen positions and then counter-attack swiftly, before French and British infantry could consolidate captured ground.
The largest German counter-attacks of the Somme battle took place from 20 to 23 September, from the Somme north to St Pierre Vaast Wood and were destroyed by French artillery fire. Rather than pack troops into the front-line, local, corps and army reserves were held back, in lines about apart, able to make progressively stronger counter-attacks. Trenches were still dug but were no longer intended to be fought from, being used for shelter during quiet periods, for the movement of reinforcements and supplies and as rallying points and decoys. Before an attack, the garrison tried to move forwards into shell-holes, to avoid Allied artillery-fire and to surprise attacking infantry with machine-gun fire. Opposite the French, the Germans dug new defences on a reverse slope from the Tortille stream at Allaines to the west end of St Pierre Vaast Wood and from there to Morval. , the fourth German position, was dug from Sailly Saillissel to Morval and Bapaume, along the Péronne–Bapaume road. French agents also reported new construction to the east. Ludendorff created fifteen &quot;new&quot; divisions by combing-out troops at depots and by removing regiments from existing divisions; the new 212th, 213th and 214th divisions replaced worn out divisions opposite the French Tenth and Sixth armies.

==Prelude==

===Anglo-French plan===

Fayolle planned attacks to capture Sailly-Saillisel, a twin village to the north-west of St Pierre Vaast wood, followed by outflanking attacks to the north and south, avoiding a frontal attack. Fayolle expected to be ready to attack Sailly-Saillisel by but if an attack towards Rocquigny could begin earlier, the Fourth Army was to attack to cover the French left flank. Sailly-Saillisel was along the Péronne–Bapaume road and Saillisel lay at right angles on the east side, along the Moislains–St Pierre Vaast road and overlooked a shallow valley to the north towards Le Transloy. The difficulties of movement in the rear, wet weather in October and the terrain channelled the attacks of the Sixth Army into a gap between St Pierre Vaast Wood and the Fourth Army boundary. At the end of September, the Sixth Army took over the Fourth Army front at Morval, which widened the attack front to about . The French XXXII Corps, which held the front from Rancourt to Frégicourt, was to attack the Saillisels and I Corps to the left would attack eastwards from Morval, to capture Bukovina and Jata-Jezov trenches in the German fourth position in front of the Péronne–Bapaume road, then capture the north end of the Saillisels and reach Rocquigny.

The British Fourth, Reserve and Third armies were to be ready by 12 October, the Fourth Army to attack towards Le Transloy, Beaulencourt, the ridge beyond the Thilloy–Warlencourt valley to Loupart Wood (about a mile east of Irles). Before the main attack, the Fourth Army was to advance north-eastwards, to capture a spur west of Le Transloy and Beaulencourt and north to the edge of the Thilloy–Warlencourt valley. Haig thought that if there was normal autumn weather, the objectives could be achieved but some restrictions on artillery ammunition consumption were imposed and more aircraft were requested from England. An attack on 1 October was to advance the left flank, capture Eaucourt and part of the Flers line (also known as the Le Sars line) up to Le Sars. The Reserve Army was to advance towards Puisieux, as the right flank met the attacks from the south bank at Miraumont, enveloping German troops in the upper Ancre valley. The Third Army was to provide a flank guard north of the Reserve Army, by occupying a spur south of Gommecourt. Operations were to begin by 12 October, after the Fourth Army had attacked towards Le Transloy and Beaulencourt and the French Sixth Army had attacked Sailly-Saillisel. The French Tenth Army south of the Somme was to attack on 10 October, north of Chaulnes.

====Fourth Army====
The attack was to be conducted by III Corps and the New Zealand Division of XV Corps on the right flank, which was to advance its left, pivoting from a point in the Gird trenches, east of Eaucourt. On 29 September, a day of rain and bright spells, the 6th Division and the Guards Division in XIV Corps on the right flank, took unopposed, some trenches east of Lesbœufs at A company of the 8th Battalion York and Lancaster Regiment of the 23rd Division captured Destrémont Farm and gained contact with the 2nd Canadian Division (II Corps) on the right flank of the Reserve Army later on; a battalion of the 47th (1/2nd London) Division began to bomb its way up Flers Trench during the evening. On 30 September, the day was dull but dry; the battalion pushed the Germans back beyond Flers Switch Trench and a New Zealand battalion kept pace along Flers Support Trench.

===German preparations===
The Germans had built new defensive lines during the battle and the first two were called the (Switch Trench I Position/Allaines Line), a double line of trenches and barbed-wire several miles further back, as a new second line of defence along the ridge north of the Ancre valley, from Essarts to Bucquoy, west of Achiet le Petit, Loupart Wood, south of Grévillers, west of Bapaume to Le Transloy and Sailly-Saillisel. On the reverse slope of that ridge, the (Switch Trench II Position/Armin Line) ran from Ablainzevelle to west of Logeast Wood, west of Achiet le Grand, the western outskirts of Bapaume, to Rocquigny, Le Mesnil en Arrousaise to Vaux Wood. branched from at Achiet le Grand and ran clockwise around Bapaume, then south to Beugny, Ytres, Nurlu and Templeux la Fosse. The first two German reserve lines had various British titles (Loupart/Bapaume/le Transloy/Bihucourt lines) and the third line was known as the &quot;Beugny–Ytres Switch&quot;.

From 25 September to the beginning of October, Rupprecht relieved the 6th Bavarian Division, 50th Reserve Division and the 52nd Reserve Division with the 7th Reserve Division, 6th Bavarian Reserve Division and 18th Reserve Division opposite the Fourth Army, part of thirteen fresh divisions installed opposite the British. From the six divisions from Le Transloy to the Ancre river were relieved by seven fresh divisions, two of which were then relieved by the 6th Division, 2nd Bavarian Division, 19th Reserve Division, 28th Reserve Division, 24th Division, 40th Division, 4th &quot;Ersatz&quot; Division, 5th &quot;Ersatz&quot; Division and Marinekorps-Flandern from the Belgian coast. From the seven divisions from Le Transloy to the Ancre were relieved, as was one of the fresh divisions, by the 38th Division, 222nd Division, Bavarian &quot;Ersatz&quot; Division, 4th Guard Division, 58th Division, 1st Guards Reserve Division, 23rd Reserve Division and the 24th Reserve Division; in mid-November, the Marine Brigade reinforced the Guard Reserve Corps near Warlencourt.

===Fourth Army===

====1 October====


At on a fine day, a deliberate bombardment began along the Fourth Army front and continued steadily until zero hour at In the Gird trenches on the right flank, captured during the preliminary operations, the Special Brigade RE fired oil cylinders from 36 Livens Projectors, a minute before the attack by the New Zealand Division on the left of XV Corps (Lieutenant-General John Du Cane). Thirty of the cylinders burst on target, enveloping the objective in flame and smoke. Despite the bombs, German machine-gunners inflicted many casualties on the depleted 2nd Canterbury and 2nd Otago battalions of the 2nd New Zealand Brigade. The 2nd Canterbury captured quickly the Gird trenches up to Goose Alley and the east end of Circus Trench, which was on a south-west line down to the Flers trenches. The 2nd Otago attacked from Goose Alley and passed beyond the objective and The Circus, an empty German strong point. The New Zealanders reorganised on the Le Barque road and with reinforcements consolidated a new line, in contact with the 47th Division (Brigadier-General W. H. Greenly then Major-General George Gorringe) near Abbey Road. The New Zealanders lost many of the still left during the attack and took 

On the right flank of the III Corps (Lieutenant-General William Pulteney) area on the left flank of the Fourth Army, the 47th (1/2nd London) Division attacked with three battalions of the 141st Brigade and two tanks. The 1/19th London Regiment (1/19th London) got to within of the German line, was forced under cover by machine-gun fire and waited for the tanks. The tanks drove left along the Flers trenches firing into them and the infantry captured the trenches easily, despite the many earlier casualties. As the support waves consolidated Flers Support Trench, the leading infantry pressed on past Eaucourt L&#x27;Abbaye (Eaucourt) and met the New Zealanders at the Le Barque road. The 1/20th London attacked Eaucourt and crossed the Flers trenches after the two tanks has passed by, swept through Eaucourt and gained touch with the 1/19th London. The tanks pressed on but bogged west of Eaucourt; the 1/17th London on the left flank had already been stopped by uncut wire and German machine-gun fire. During a counter-attack by part of II Battalion, Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 17, the tanks were set on fire and abandoned.
The 50th (Northumbrian) Division (Major-General Percival Wilkinson) attacked with the 151st Brigade. On the right the 1/6th Durham Light Infantry (1/6th DLI) was exposed by the repulse of the 1/17th London, had many casualties from German machine-gun fire and was only able to capture a short length of Flers Trench. The 1/9th DLI (Lieutenant-Colonel R. B. Bradford) came up from reserve and Bradford managed to organise another attack, capturing the rest of Flers Trench by In the centre, a composite battalion of the 1/5th Border, 1/8th DLI and the 1/5th Northumberland Fusiliers attached from the 149th Brigade on the left, benefited from an excellent barrage to advance and capture the Flers trenches before the defenders could react.

On the left flank of III Corps, the 23rd Division (Major-General James Babington) attacked with the 70th Brigade. The 11th Sherwood Foresters (11th Foresters) and the 8th King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry (8th KOYLI) assembled forward of their trenches, which were on a south-east line from Destrémont Farm. On the right, the 11th Foresters captured Flers Trench and most of Flers Support then linked with the 151st Brigade. On the left, the 8th KOYLI faced determined resistance and only later was able to bomb the Germans back up Flers Trench and link with the 2nd Canadian Division on the Reserve Army boundary. The 9th York and Lancs went forward to reinforce and tried to probe Le Sars but was repulsed by small-arms fire from the houses. Communication with the rear broke down and the divisional and corps headquarters were not reliably informed of events until early on 2 October. The 47th (1/2nd London) Division headquarters realised that the 1/17th London had been repulsed and sent forward the tired and understrength 1/23rd London (142nd Brigade), which repeated the attack at and was repulsed with 

====2–6 October====
During the night of the Germans were forced out of Flers Support on the 50th Division front, where the 1/6th and 1/9th DLI formed a flank guard on the right next to the 47th Division and defeated several German counter-attacks, with hand grenades and Stokes mortar fire. It began to rain at and continued for the next two days. The 1/18th London relieved the 1/17th London and at midday on 3 October, patrols reported that there were few Germans in the trenches opposite Eaucourt. The battalion advanced nearly unopposed north-west of the farm and gained touch with the 1/20th London on the right and the 68th Brigade of the 23rd Division, which had relieved the 50th Division brigade. Opposite Le Sars on the left, the 69th Brigade took over from the 70th Brigade and on 4 October, was repulsed in a pre-dawn attack up Flers Support to cross the Albert–Bapaume road. The next Fourth Army attack had been set for 5 October but the rains forced Rawlinson to postpone the attack until 7 October. The Sixth Army agreed to the postponement so that the attacks of both armies would simultaneous.

The 47th (1/2nd London) Division occupied the rest of Flers Support on 4 October and during the night of 5 October occupied the site of a mill to the north-west of Eaucourt; the 23rd Division attacked to capture Flers Support north of the Albert–Bapaume road at on 4 October. A small party of the 10th Battalion Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment cut through the barbed wire by hand and got a footing in the trench but retired after running out of grenades and ammunition. Two days later, the 11th Northumberland Fusiliers captured the Tangle east of Le Sars but found the area untenable and retired. The weather improved on 4 October, with high winds and little rain but low cloud made air observation difficult. On the XIV Corps front, it as was difficult to identify German outposts in trenches and derelict gun pits in front of the fortifications of Le Transloy, as it was for the British positions opposite. A high volume of German artillery retaliation when the preliminary bombardment began on 6 October, was maintained but caused few casualties to British troops waiting for zero hour at 

====7 October====
The XIV Corps objective was a trench line from away and on the right flank the 56th (1/1st London) Division (Major-General Charles Hull) attacked with two brigades. On the right, in the 168th Brigade area, the 1/14th Battalion London Scottish found it difficult to maintain contact with the French on the right, who advanced eastwards rather than north-east. The Scottish captured a southern group of gun pits and pushed on to the south end of Hazy Trench beyond. The 1/4th London was stopped by machine-gun fire from the northern gun pits and tried to outflank them on the right. On the left, the 1/12th London advance was stopped short of Dewdrop Trench to the north-east of Lesbœufs, which had only been bombarded by Stokes mortars as it was too close to the British front line. In the 167th Brigade area, the 1/1st London was repulsed in front of Spectrum Trench except on the left flank where bombers joined with the 1/7th Middlesex, after it captured Rainbow Trench, the south end of Spectrum Trench against determined resistance. The 1/14th London Scottish and the 1/4th London defeated a counter-attack but after dark the battalions were forced back, as were the French on the right.

In the 20th (Light) Division (Major-General William Smith) area two battalions of the 60th Brigade captured Rainbow Trench, shot at German troops who ran away and pressed on to Misty Trench to gain touch with the 1/7th Middlesex on the right and the 61st Brigade on the left, which had reached its objective east of Gueudecourt, after the 7th KOYLI and the 12th King&#x27;s Liverpool encountered a line of Germans advancing from Rainbow Trench to surrender. The battalions occupied Rainbow Trench and kept going to to the south-east corner of Cloudy Trench. The 12th (Eastern) Division (Major-General Arthur Scott) on the right of XV Corps had not moved forward, so a defensive flank was formed on the left and a new trench (Shine Trench) dug from Cloudy Trench to the Beaulencourt road. About of Rainbow Trench south-east of the road was still held by the Germans, who counter-attacked from Beaulencourt at about and were repulsed by small-arms fire.

In the XV Corps area, the objective was set forward along the north-west end of Rainbow Trench and Bayonet Trench (the west end of which, beyond the Flers–Thilloy road, had just been discovered), up to the Gird trenches. Just before zero hour a German machine-gun barrage began on the front trenches of the 12th (Eastern) Division and began an artillery bombardment, particularly on Gueudecourt, which held back the 37th Brigade on the right flank. The 6th Buffs next to the 20th Division got into Rainbow Trench with too few survivors to consolidate and retired. The 6th Royal West Kent on the left was stopped by the machine-gun barrage as were the 9th and 8th Royal Fusiliers of the 36th Brigade on the left, the parties of the 8th Royal Fusiliers which got into Bayonet Trench being overwhelmed. In the 41st Division (Major-General Sydney Lawford) area on the left of XV Corps, the German machine-gun barrage stopped the 32nd and 26th Royal Fusiliers of the 124th Brigade half-way to Bayonet Trench. Parties reached the trench, where they were reinforced by the 21st KRRC and 10th Queen&#x27;s but by nightfall, the brigade had been reduced to a battalion of survivors. On the left flank, the 122nd Brigade used all four battalions who were also shot down. A Livens Projector bombardment of burning oil on the Gird lines failed but bombers from the 11th West Kent advanced a short way up both trenches. On the left flank, the divisional and corps boundary, the brigade got forward and linked with the 47th Division on the right of III Corps.

In the III Corps area, the 47th (1/2nd London) Division and 23rd Division objective required an advance of , half-way into Le Sars and then capture the rest of the village when the offensive began on the Butte de Warlencourt and the Gird trenches up to the Flers trenches. The 47th (1/2nd London) Division attacked with the 140th Brigade to capture Snag Trench along the east slope of a dip towards Warlencourt, about forward and halfway to the butte. The 1/8th London on the right was stopped by a huge volume of machine-gun fire, as were the 1/15th and 1/7th London who were to pass through the 1/8th London and could only establish outposts near the Le Barque road, in touch with the 41st Division. The 23rd Division attacked on the right with the 12th DLI of the 68th Brigade, supported by a tank which attacked the German garrison in the Tangle and then turned left up the sunken road from Eaucourt to Le Sars, until hit by a shell. The 12th DLI was checked by machine-gun fire down the road from the village but the 9th Green Howards of the 69th Brigade got into the south-west end. In the centre, the 13th DLI was to capture the rest of the village and attacked at 

The battalion met the Green Howards at the village crossroads and after a determined resistance, the German defence collapsed. The 12th DLI had dug in along the sunken road beyond the Tangle and pushed posts forward on the right flank. The 13th DLI and Green Howards dug posts around the village and prepared to advance on the Butte de Warlencourt but no reinforcements were available. Twenty minutes after zero hour, the 11th Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment made a frontal attack on Flers Support Trench north of Le Sars but was stopped by artillery-fire and small-arms fire from the left flank. A second attempt succeeded, with bombers attacking along the trench from Le Sars, retreating Germans being shot down by the British infantry and the divisional artillery. The 10th Duke of Wellington&#x27;s arrived later and by dark, the 69th Brigade had occupied the Flers trenches to a point inside the Fourth Army boundary.

====8 October====

The rain came back during the night and on 8 October the Fourth Army divisions removed casualties and consolidated positions. On the left flank the 23rd Division attacked again at with the Reserve Army. Two companies of the 8th York and Lancs from the 70th Brigade, captured the Flers trenches up to the army boundary and occupied an abandoned post north-west of Le Sars. The 47th (1/2nd London) Division made a night attack on Snag Trench with the 1/21st and 1/22nd London, by crawling forward to rush the trench as the barrage lifted. The trench was entered on the left but the parties were forced out by fire from the right. The 1/22nd London set up posts on the Eaucourt–Warlencourt road and gained touch with the 23rd Division to the west. On the army boundary with the Sixth Army, the 56th Division moved back from Rainy Trench north-east of Lesbœufs and most of Spectrum Trench to the north, for a British preparatory bombardment and then attacked at with the 169th Brigade on the right. The 1/5th London (London Rifle Brigade) captured Hazy Trench, despite losing contact with the French 18th Division on the right and machine-guns concealed in shell-holes stopped the 1/9th London and the 1/3rd London (167th Brigade) advance on Dewdrop and Spectrum trenches. After dark the battalions were withdrawn to the start line and German troops occupied Rainy trench unopposed.

Late on 8 October, Rawlinson ordered another attack, once XV Corps had reached its objectives, anticipated to be by 12 October, when the Sixth Army expected to have captured Sailly-Saillisel to the south-east. The rain stopped early on 9 October and from the weather was fine but the state of the ground made divisional reliefs slow and laborious. From the XIV Corps replaced the 56th and 20th divisions with the 4th Division (Major-General William Lambton) and the 6th Division (Major-General Charles Ross). In XV Corps the 41st Division was replaced by the 30th Division (Major-General John Shea) and the 9th Division (Major-General William Furse) and 15th Division (Major-General Frederick McCracken) took over from the 47th (1/2nd London) and 23rd divisions in III Corps. The new division had little time to study the ground or dig assembly trenches and Furse was refused a 48-hour postponement. The Royal Flying Corps (RFC) attempted to get new photographs of the German defences but the light was too poor for much to be achieved.

====12 October====

Zero hour was and the 4th Division on the right of XIV Corps attacked with the 10th Brigade next to the French 18th Division (IX Corps). The 1st Battalion, Royal Warwick advanced and dug Antelope Trench south of Hazy Trench, gained touch with the French and repulsed a counter-attack in the evening. The battalion advance was repulsed at Rainy and Dewdrop trenches north-east of Lesbœufs, along with the 1st Royal Irish Fusiliers further to the left. On the left of the division the 12th Brigade attacked Spectrum Trench after a Stokes mortar bombardment; parties of the 2nd Duke of Wellington got into the trench and linked with the 2nd Lancashire Fusiliers in the north end of the trench. An attempt by groups from both battalions to attack over the spur to Zenith Trench was repulsed. In the 6th Division area north of the Le Transloy road, the 2nd York and Lancaster, on the right of the 16th Brigade was also repulsed in front of Zenith Trench.
In the 71st Brigade area to the left, the 9th Suffolk in a salient formed by Misty and the east end of Cloudy Trench were not to advance and in the 18th Brigade on the left of the division, the 1st West Yorks attacked Mild Trench and the rest of Cloudy Trench by a frontal attack and a flank attack by bombers, which was repulsed. The 14th DLI on the left flank got into Rainbow Trench and bombed dugouts along the sunken Beaulencourt road, to link with the 1st West Yorks. On the left of the road the 14th DLI gained touch with the 88th Brigade detached from the 29th Division to the 12th (Eastern) Division on the right of XV Corps. The Royal Newfoundland Regiment on the right and the 1st Essex on the left, captured part of Hilt Trench and the extension of Rainbow Trench and then part of the 1st Essex pressed on to Grease Trench but were ordered back to the start line at because the 35th Brigade on the left had not managed to get forward. The Newfoundlanders held on at Hilt Trench, bombed further up and took part of the 1st Essex objective. In the 35th Brigade attack, the 7th Suffolk and the 7th Norfolk tried to cut through barbed wire by hand opposite Bayonet Trench against massed small-arms fire, after which the survivors were pinned down until dark and then retreated.

The 30th Division attacked on the left of XV Corps with the 2nd Royal Scots Fusiliers and the 17th Manchester of the 90th Brigade. The Royal Scots managed only to advance into machine-gun fire and then withdrew as some parties of the 17th Manchester got into Bayonet Trench before retiring. On the left of the division, the 89th Brigade attacked on the right with the 2nd Bedfordshire, which tried to bomb up the Gird trenches but were only able to take a small length of Bite Trench. On the left, the 7th King&#x27;s Liverpool was stopped by enfilade fire from the north-west, the preliminary bombardment having failed to suppress the German machine-guns, which were dispersed over a wide area.

In the III Corps area the 9th (Scottish) Division on the right had to capture Snag Trench, then the Butte de Warlencourt and the Warlencourt line. The Tail ran back from Snag Trench to the butte and the Pimple at the west end of Snag Trench, with the help of enfilade fire from the 15th (Scottish) Division to the left. Little Wood and the butte were bombarded with smoke by 4 Special Company RE. In the 26th Brigade on the right, the 7th Seaforth Highlanders was caught by machine-gun fire as soon as it attacked and with the reinforcement of the 10th Argylls managed only to push on for and dig in during the night. On the left flank the 1st South African Brigade attacked with the 2nd Regiment followed by the 4th Regiment, which were held up by long-range machine-gun fire and lost direction in the smoke drifting from the butte. Parties dug in half-way to Snag Trench and some stayed in no man&#x27;s land until the following morning.

====14–17 October====

After the poor results of the attack on 12 October, Rawlinson concluded that the weather delays had enabled the defenders to recover and that a deliberate attack after methodical bombardment was necessary, before another attack on 18 October. On 13 October, he issued an operation order in which he stressed the necessity of improving routes to the front line and the preparation of good assembly trenches parallel to the German defences. A steady bombardment was to begin immediately and XIV Corps was warned to capture Zenith, Mild and the rest of Cloudy trenches, before the general attack. XV Corps was to capture the Gird lines south-east of the Eaucourt–Le Barque road and Snag Trench was to be captured by III Corps, all by night attacks supported by tanks, where practical. On 14 October, the XIV Corps attempted a surprise attack at with the 2nd Seaforth of the 4th Division, which got into Rainy Trench and gun-pits south of Dewdrop Trench and were then forced out by a counter-attack. The 2nd Royal Dublin Fusiliers tried to capture gun-pits in front of Hazy Trench at the same time and were also repulsed.

In the 12th Brigade, the 1st King&#x27;s Own tried to bomb down Spectrum Trench to Dewdrop Trench in the evenings of October and in a pre-dawn attack on 15 October, the 2nd Sherwood Foresters in the 6th Division took the gun-pits in front of the British-held section of Cloudy Trench and took several prisoners. On the left of the division the 11th Essex overran Mild Trench and bombed up the Beaulencourt road before being forced back by a counter-attack. In the III Corps area, the 3rd South African Regiment attacked after dark on 14 October, captured the Pimple and of Snag Trench. The rain gradually abated and 17 October began fair but clouded over and rain fell again during the night. The British bombardment had continued as planned but the German artillery reply was vigorous leading up to zero hour at on 18 October.

====18–20 October====
On most of the brigade fronts, assembly positions had been marked with white tape and compass bearings taken of the direction to the objectives but at zero hour, the British positions were flooded. The moon was obscured by low clouds, troops slipped and fell in the mud and weapons were clogged, leaving only hand grenades and bayonets with which to fight. On the right the 4th Division attacked with the 11th Brigade to take Frosty, Hazy, Rainy and Dewdrop trenches, while in the French sector the attack began at Groups of the 1st Rifle Brigade reached the gun-pits before Hazy Trench and were forced back, the 1st East Lancs were forced under cover in front of Dewdrop Trench, by the fire of hidden machine-guns. The 1st King&#x27;s Own of the 12th Brigade and the German defenders mutually attacked and counter-attacked around Spectrum Trench and then the King&#x27;s Own bombed along Spectrum for towards Dewdrop Trench. In the 6th Division, the 9th Norfolk attacked Mild and Cloudy trenches but was bombarded before zero hour and moved so slowly through mud that it lost the barrage. The battalion captured the north-west end of Mild Trench and then repulsed a counter-attack as dark fell. (After dark on 19 October, a platoon of the 1st Somerset Light Infantry found Frosty Trench unoccupied and defeated a counter-attack.)
The XV Corps made flank attacks because the centre faced a dip either side of the Flers–Thilloy road. The 12th (Eastern) Division on the right attacked Grease Trench with the 2nd Hampshire and 4th Worcester battalions and the south-east end of Bayonet Trench with the 9th Essex battalion from the 35th Brigade. The 2nd Hampshire and the 4th Worcester took Grease Trench with few losses but then had many casualties trying to press on. The Worcester blocked Hilt Trench on the left after the 9th Essex were not able to advance, except for one company which got into Bayonet Trench and was then bombed out by counter-attacks from the flanks. On the left of the 30th Division the 2nd Green Howards almost reached the west end of Bayonet Trench before being stopped by showers of hand-grenades. Parties bombed up part of Bite Trench but reinforcements were stopped from moving up by the mud. On the left the 18th King&#x27;s and 2nd Wiltshire attacked the Gird lines and found uncut wire on the right and enfiladed from the left, most of the 2nd Wiltshire being killed.

Two tanks had been brought up to Flers in case the night attacks failed and during a lull at one bogged in mud and the other drove to the end of Gird Trench and machine-gunned it for twenty minutes, killing many Germans who ran back to the north-east. The commander signalled the infantry to move up but the infantry were so disorganised and exhausted that none moved. The tank drove along Gird Trench to the Le Barque road and then returned. III Corps attacked Snag Trench again as smoke and lachrymatory bombs were fired from the 15th (Scottish) Division front to try to suppress German fire from the butte and from Warlencourt village. The 5th Cameron Highlanders, on the right of the 9th (Scottish) Division, took a trench from the Le Barque road to from the Nose (the junction of Snag Trench and the Tail) and met some of the 2nd Wiltshire.

A German counter-attack on the right got a footing in the trench, until another attack after dark drove them back and on the left two companies of the 1st South African Regiment overran Snag Trench, pressed on and were shot down by machine-gun fire from the butte, apart from a small group who got into Snag Trench next to the Cameron. At dawn the South Africans tried to bomb along Snag from the Pimple and at attacked from both flanks. The South Africans managed to advance, leaving the Germans occupying only of the trench around the Nose as night fell. The rain continued during 19 October; at dawn, German parties accompanied by a detachment advanced along the Tail to attack eastwards along Snag Trench. The South Africans retreated towards the 8th Black Watch which had relieved the Cameron as a counter-attack on the right flank was repulsed. British artillery maintained the bombardment on the Nose and Tail areas but the South African Brigade was too exhausted to attack again and after dark the 27th Brigade took over all the 9th (Scottish) Division front, struggling through mud and water. The 6th King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers (KOSB) was considered fit to attack at on 20 October and in confused fighting, captured, lost and retook the Nose. By dark the 6th KOSB had control of Snag Trench and some Royal Scots had advanced along of the Tail.

===German 1st and 2nd armies===

====1–3 October====
In the early autumn, many German divisions which had fought earlier on the Somme were brought back for a second period, in which their performance was considered inferior, despite replacements being of good quality, because of their lack of experienced NCOs and junior officers. The 6th Bavarian Reserve Division took over the defences of Eaucourt l&#x27;Abbaye (Eaucourt) on 26 September and suffered many casualties to artillery-fire. On 1 October, prisoners taken from Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 21 (BRIR 21) of the division said that (Livens Projectors) had caused much damage. BRIR 21 recorded the capture of the II and III battalion headquarters and that attempts to counter-attack failed. The II Battalion, BRIR 17 counter-attacked south-east down the Flers trenches past two bogged-down tanks but hope to recover Eaucourt were abandoned during the afternoon. The III Battalion, BRIR 17 re-assembled on the Eaucourt–Le Sars road on 2 October and was joined by III Battalion, BRIR 16 and parties of Infantry Regiment 362 of the 4th Division garrisoned the village.

On the night of BRIR 21 was relieved near Eaucourt by BRIR 16 but the fresh troops were unable to prevent the loss of Eaucourt. The infantry were ground down by the weather conditions and British attacks. The commander of I Battalion, BRIR 16 reported that battlefield conditions were extraordinary, with cold food and artillery-fire causing severe problems, particularly short shooting by German guns, the high number of casualties having depressed morale, made worse by the lack of opportunity to remove the bodies strewn around trenches and tracks. Poor hygiene caused many non-battle casualties, with of the men having severe diarrhoea. The report was sent to the regiment commander who could only pass it on. By 3 October, the 4th Division had relieved the 7th Division west of the Bapaume road and took over the Bavarian right up to Le Sars, by when BRIR 17 casualties had risen to 

====7–8 October====
On the night of Infantry Regiment 68 (IR68) of the 16th Division and Reserve Infantry Regiment 76 (RIR 76) of the 17th Reserve Division relieved IR 163 at the Saillisels, both regiments having fought against the British on the Somme earlier in the battle. The troops of the 16th Division had spent several days digging part of by day and night in the rain, after marching from bivouacs in muddy fields, without means of getting dry, before receiving the order to move forward to the front line. On 10 October, another order came that the division would not be relieved for some time and must keep troops in reserve back in . The front line was hard to define and led IR 68 and RIR 76 to argue over the inter-regimental boundary; French attacks and artillery-fire had already made the southern approach to the village untenable. The troops were encouraged by the evidence of the greater effort in the air being made over the Somme, reporting that the &quot;aerial plague was less intense&quot; than during their first tour.

The 18th Reserve Division relieved the 52nd Reserve Division in late September and Reserve Infantry Regiment 84 on the left of the division lost 70 prisoners on 7 October. The British 20th Division took prisoners from Reserve Infantry Regiment 72 (7th Reserve Division) on the Gueudecourt–Beaulencourt road and Reserve Infantry Regiment 66 to the left. Reserve Infantry regiments 36 and 72 (7th Reserve Division) lost prisoners at Rainbow Trench. Snag Trench was held by III Battalion, BRIR 16 of the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division. From the British took 528 prisoners from Infantry regiments 360, 361, 362 of the 4th Division, the I Battalion, Infantry Regiment 360 having been attacked during a relief by III Battalion, Infantry Regiment 360. The 47th Division captured 84 prisoners of Reserve Infantry Regiment 31 (RIR 31) and 84 of the 18th Reserve Division. RIR 86 had moved left to close a gap made by the French, which moved RIR 31 opposite the British right flank. In the 16th Division area opposite the French, IR 68 and IR 28 made several counter-attacks against French troops who had reached the church in Sailly, greatly helped by the German artillery which inflicted many French losses before the fighting closed to hand-to-hand.

The new tactic of holding the front line with the minimum of men increased the burden on German artillery, which had to commence firing as soon as the French or British attacked but the extent of Allied artillery-fire forced the gunners to rely on flares from the front line instead of telephones. A field-gun regiment at the Nurlu–Péronne-Moislains–Templeux-la-Fosse crossroads covered the defences of St Pierre Vaast wood, away, from open positions vulnerable to French shelling. The distance from the wood was too great for observed fire; when shooting from the map, shell dispersion made for a large beaten zone, impossible to correct and some shells fell short onto German positions, despite careful fire control and gun laying. Steel was being used instead of brass for shell cases, which caused stoppages but the artillery still managed to fire per day.

====12 October====
The 16th Division at the Saillisels repulsed several attacks in the morning and then received a bombardment of &quot;staggering intensity&quot;, before the French attacked again. Infantry Regiment 68 lost another but held on with IR 76 which was relieved that night. Liaison between the Bavarians and the 16th Division was poor and both regiments argued about responsibility for a gap between them. The companies of the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division on the Bapaume–Albert road opposite the British, were down to about 35 men each, all suffering from dysentery, exhaustion, hunger and exposure, to hold an area of . Reserve Infantry Regiment 31 recorded many losses at Zenith Trench. The 19th Reserve Division had relieved the 7th Reserve Division and on the right the 6th Division had moved up and taken over the left of the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division opposite the III Corps of the British Fourth Army. Reserve Infantry Regiment 92 of the 19th Reserve Division was opposite the left of the British 6th Division. About were taken from Infantry Regiment 64 of the 6th Division during the loss of Hilt Trench, the left flank being rolled up. A counter-attack stopped the British advance but contact with Reserve Infantry Regiment 92 of the 19th Reserve Division on the left was lost.

Infantry Regiment 24 of the 6th Division and parts of Bavarian Reserve Infantry regiments 16 and 21 of the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division were opposite the 30th Division. Snag Trench was held by Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 20. After the fighting on 12 October, the 2nd Bavarian Division relieved the 18th Reserve Division, the 40th Division relieved the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division on the night of and the 24th Division took over from the 4th Division. On 12 October, men of the German 15th Division refused orders to move up to the front line. French attacks were made in the afternoons after artillery bombardments and on 14 October, IR 68 found that half its casualties had been caused by German artillery firing short. The dispute about regimental boundaries continued and on 15 October the French found the gap and got into Saillisel. Several determined counter-attacks were made to eject them but by 17 October the counter-attacks had failed. (The Bavarians blamed the Prussians of IR 68, which after the war took 58 pages of the regimental history to explain that the position had been compromised all along, that German artillery had bombarded them constantly, tactical communication had been lost and orders could not be related to the ground.)

====18–20 October====
The rest of the Saillisels had been held and the German hold on St Pierre Vaast wood stopped the French from rolling up the German defences from north to south. The 4th Division took prisoners from Bavarian Infantry Regiment 15 of the 2nd Bavarian Division and the II Battalion, Bavarian Infantry Regiment 15 suffered 50 per cent casualties. Most of Reserve Infantry Regiment 92 was captured and Infantry Regiment 64 of the 6th Division lost of the I Battalion. Infantry Regiment 181 of the 40th Division found that the mud reduced the effect of the British bombardment and the infantry were unable to make a quick advance. Prisoners were taken from I and II battalions, Infantry Regiment 104 at Snag Trench and the III Battalion conducted a counter-attack. On 19 October, the storm detachment of the 40th Division counter-attacked in two columns with flame-throwers, a machine-gun section and the best men of I Battalion, Infantry Regiment 104; the advance of the left column was halted by one of the flame-throwers exploding. Most of the survivors of Infantry Regiment 104 were relieved by III Battalion, Infantry Regiment 134. The trenches of Infantry Regiment 104 were smashed by artillery-fire and the troops were withdrawn, according to the new policy, of avoiding pointless casualties by abandoning outposts of no tactical value.

====24 October====
Rupprecht wrote in his diary that the recapture of the north end of Sailly was needed to regain artillery observation but that this would have to wait for the arrival of the XV Corps (General Berthold von Deimling) with the 30th and 39th divisions. Below and the commander of the IX Reserve Corps, General Max von boehn, had agreed that the power of resistance of the Germans on the Somme was much reduced and that officer casualties meant that it could not be increased. The French First Offensive Battle of Verdun temporarily stopped the flow of reinforcements to the Somme front but substantial artillery and air reinforcements were already on the Somme. The decline in the power of the Anglo-French artillery caused by poor weather and attacks on artillery-observation machines, enabled the German infantry to mount a costly but successful defence, helped by the knowledge that the onset of winter would end the battle.

===Air operations===
By October, the Germans had managed to assemble about in from Péronne to Hannescamps, 17 with about aircraft, flights () with about three bomber-fighter squadrons () and two independent flights with about to escort them, mainly of C-type, two-seater, armed biplanes and three fighter squadrons () with about &quot;Jagdstaffel 2&quot; () Hauptmann Oswald Boelcke) had been established at Bertincourt on 27 August and on 16 September, received new Albatros D.I and D.II fighters. The concentration of aircraft, particularly the superior fighters, enabled the Germans to challenge Anglo-French air superiority, at least for short periods.

&quot;Barrage flights&quot; to stop aircraft crossing the German lines were abolished and airmen were ordered over the Anglo-French lines instead, to fight through to their objectives in large formations. Aircraft with more powerful engines, that could climb higher than British fighters had arrived in August and managed to photograph the battlefield. More balloon units arrived, which eventually had fifty balloons, half of those on the Western Front. All of the light motorised anti-aircraft guns in the army were sent to the Somme. Methodical observation of artillery-fire and the reforms introduced by Gallwitz made bombardments more efficient and German infantry began to regain confidence in the air arm. On 6 October, the Imperial German Flying Corps () was reformed as the (German Air Force).

====1–11 October====
During September, the monthly wastage (losses from all causes) in RFC fighters and long-range reconnaissance aircraft was 75 per cent and the new faster, more manoeuvrable German fighters coming into service, threatened Anglo-French air superiority on the Somme. At on 1 October, observers of 34 Squadron and 3 Squadron watched the attack by III Corps and the New Zealand Division of XV Corps on Eaucourt l&#x27;Abbaye and the defences either side, on a front. The attack on Eaucourt failed but on the rest of the attack front the infantry followed a good barrage onto their objectives and were also able to send patrols into Le Sars. The commander of 34 Squadron, Major John Chamier reported that

II Corps of the Reserve Army on the left of III Corps, had attacked at but was repulsed by a huge amount of German artillery-fire and frequent counter-attacks. In three hours, RFC observers sent down 67 zone calls to the II Corps counter-battery group and 39 batteries were reported by observers in balloons. On 2 October, continuous rain began and eight German aircraft flew low over the British lines between Morval and Lesbœufs, where one was shot down by ground fire, while the British aircraft were on the ground. On 6 October, German aircraft had reconnoitred and several strafed troops of XV Corps. The Fourth Army attacked again on 7 October in dull and windy weather and the German airmen returned to the British artillery lines near Flers and Gueudecourt and directed German counter-battery fire onto the British guns.

British fighter pilots from IV Brigade were sent to the scene but the Germans had gone by the time they arrived. RFC observers watched the British attack but the strong westerly wind made their aircraft appear to be stationary in the air, when the pilots turned into the wind to allow the observers to study the ground. German infantry fired on the aircraft, two crew were wounded and several aircraft had to be flown back to make emergency landings. Rawlinson complained at the quality of the reconnaissance reports, which with the lack of observation during the rain delays before the attack, led to the British bombardments and barrages being inaccurate, which contributed to the failure of the Fourth Army except east of Gueudecourt and at Le Sars. The German counter-barrage had been prompt and accurate, helped by the success of the reconnaissance flights before the attack.

On 9 October, German aircraft bombed the rear areas of III Corps at and within minutes four pilots from 18 Squadron and 21 Squadron, were dispatched to raid illuminated aerodromes from which the bombers had come but none were seen; Cambrai station and villages around Bapaume were bombed instead. A train hit earlier by 13 Squadron, which had also bombed Bapaume and Quéant stations, was hit again. Next day the weather improved and every British offensive patrol was attacked; Sopwith 1½ Strutters from 70 Squadron fought seven German fighters over their airfield at Vélu; other British aircraft joined in but found it impossible to keep the German aircraft in their sights because of their manoeuvrability. The German aircraft eventually flew away after one aeroplane each was shot down; three more German aircraft were lost and a British aircraft was shot down into the British lines near Morval from which the crew escaped. Another aeroplane force-landed at Pozières and a 23 Squadron F.E.2b crashed into a shell-hole with a dead pilot. During the night, 18, 19 and 13 squadrons bombed Cambrai and Vitry stations and the aerodrome at Douai.

====12–21 October====

On 12 October, the Fourth Army attack was repulsed except near Gueudecourt, partly because of a lack of air observation, which led to an inadequate preparatory bombardment. The weather remained bad until 16 October when three aircraft of 18 Squadron bombed Cambrai station, one of which was shot down as they returned. German aircraft also bombed the airfield of 9 Squadron, wounding two ground staff and destroying one aeroplane and damaged another. Seven BE 12s of 19 Squadron bombed Hermies station and the airfield in the morning, then Havrincourt and Ruyaulcourt in the afternoon, losing two aircraft. The reconnaissance and artillery-observation aircraft of IV and V brigades flew many sorties against much German fighter opposition. A 15 Squadron aircraft was attacked by five fighters near Hébuterne and shot down and another aircraft was attacked over Warlencourt and returned with a wounded observer. IV Brigade offensive patrols lost one aircraft and had one pilot wounded, shooting down three German aircraft; another was shot down by a V Brigade offensive patrol.

The better weather continued on 17 October and a supply dump was blown up at Bapaume station. A reconnaissance by Third Army aircraft at the north end of the Somme front, met twenty German fighters and two aircraft were shot down by each side. A British aircraft was driven down by German fighters and two German aircraft were forced down by 24 Squadron near Vélu; rain and sleet then stopped flying for two days. On 20 October, aircraft of 11 Squadron on photographic reconnaissance near Douai, were attacked by , which shot down two aircraft and damaged two more. Thirty-three German aircraft crossed the British front line and made many attacks on British aircraft; three German aircraft were shot down and seventeen claimed damaged. German night bombers attacked Querrieu, Corbie and Longueau, where an ammunition wagon was blown up; British aircraft attacked Vélu and Péronne. Quéant station was bombed by thirty aircraft and escorts and one bomber was shot down. After the bombers reached British lines, one of the escorting Nieuport 17s turned back but was forced down in a dogfight with a faster German aircraft. On other parts of the Somme front two German aircraft were shot down, three damaged and ten driven down.

====22 October–November====
On 22 October there were many sorties by German flyers. Six aircraft attacked a 1½ Strutter of 45 Squadron and wounded the observer, who shot one down. Later in the day, three 45 Squadron aircraft were shot down and an F.E.2b shot down one aircraft and damaged another, before the observer was mortally wounded; four British aircraft were shot down beyond German lines. During 23 October, two Reserve Army artillery observation aeroplanes were shot down by . On 26 October, despite poor weather both sides flew many sorties; a fight between five Airco DH.2s of 24 Squadron and twenty Halberstadt D.IIs was indecisive but later in the day, eight aircraft led by Boelcke, shot down one British observation aircraft, forced down two more and a British fighter which intervened. One German fighter was then shot down when a formation of British fighters from 32 Squadron turned up. Boelcke was killed on 28 October, when he collided with a German aircraft during an attack on two British fighters, which returned safely.

For the rest of the battle of the Somme, both sides flew in rain, mist, sleet and westerly gales, often at dangerously low heights, to direct artillery and attack troops with guns and bombs. 3 November was a clear day and German aircraft shot down five British aircraft. On the night of 6 November German night bombers hit an ammunition train near Cerisy, which exploded next to a cage for German prisoners of war and devastated the area. Better weather came on 8 November and many German aircraft made ground attacks on British troops, a tactic which the began to incorporate systematically into its defensive operations. The British attempted to divert German attention next day, with bombing raids on Arleux and Vraucourt. The raid on Vraucourt by twelve bombers and fourteen escorts became the biggest air fight of the war, when approximately thirty German aircraft attacked the formation as it crossed the front lines. Most of the bombs were dropped over the target but six British aircraft were shot down and three German aircraft were claimed. Three more British aircraft were shot down later in the day; one pilot was killed, one wounded and an observer were wounded in aircraft which returned.

The railway station at Vitry and German airfields at Buissy, Vélu and Villers were attacked after dark, while German night bombers attacked the airfield at Lavieville. The British attacked Valenciennes aerodrome next morning, where five parked aircraft, hangars and sheds were bombed. Next day, German air operations were less extensive; three aircraft were shot down and three damaged for the loss of one British aeroplane. Naval 8 drove down two German aircraft on 10 November and overnight 18 Squadron retaliated for the attack on their airfield at Lavieville by bombing Valenciennes, Vélu, transport on the Bapaume road, balloon sheds, a train near St. Léger and a second train which was set on fire; a German headquarters at Havrincourt Château and Douai aerodrome were also attacked. German bombers attacked Amiens station and returned on the night of when one aircraft was forced down with engine-trouble and the crew captured.

===Flanking operations===

====Tenth Army====
The Tenth Army attacked from and during the Battle of Le Transloy, after being reinforced by the XXI Corps (General Paul Maistre) and the II Colonial Corps (General Ernest Blondlat). On 10 October the army attacked on a front in the centre of the army area towards Pressoir, Ablaincourt and Fresnes. The French captured the German second position around Ablaincourt and took about but south of Estrées, the attack by the 51st Division on Chaulnes was contained in Bois 4 to the north-west. On 14 October, an attack by the 10th Colonial Division and two other divisions on the left flank, next to the Sixth Army boundary, captured the trenches opposite and took about the French then paused to consolidate the ground around Ablaincourt, which had turned into a vast lake of mud and repulsed several German counter-attacks. The army began preparations for an attack later in October to capture the Butte de Fresnes and cut the Chaulnes–Péronne railway but the weather, the state of the ground, exhaustion of the infantry and the increased powers of resistance of the German 2nd Army slowed the French advance.

The Tenth Army had failed to advance on the northern flank against Barleux in the Sixth Army area, where the XXXIII Corps on both sides of the Somme, had attacked again in the south on 18 October, to counter German mining and improve the line from La Maisonnette north to Biaches. An attack to clear the approaches to the higher ground on which lay Villers-Carbonnel and Fresnes to the south-east was forestalled on 29 October, when the Germans bombarded La Maisonette for eight hours with high explosive, gas and lachrymatory shell and then the 206th Division attacked with Infantry Regiment 359. A battalion of the 97th Infantry Regiment was overrun and taken, which left a gap in the French line for several days and the attack on Barleux had to be cancelled. On the right (southern) flank of the army, the 51st Division was unable to advance further in Bois 4 on 11 October. During the night a counter-attack by German storm-troops and a flame-thrower detachment destroyed a battalion of the 25th Regiment and a French attack on 21 October, began a period of local attacks and counter-attacks which lasted into November.

====Sixth Army====

The Sixth Army attacked on Opposite the Sixth Army, , reserve position) the fourth German defensive position built on the Somme, ran along a dip at the top of the shallow valley between the Saillisels and Le Transloy, in front of which the sunken road from Le Transloy to the Morval–Saillisel road, known as Baniska and Tours trenches, had also been fortified. On the right flank of the attack, the Saillisels were covered by the Prilip to the Portes de Fer and Négotin line just east of Rancourt, which met the west end of St Pierre Vaast wood at Reuss Trench and the Carlsbad, Terplitz and Berlin trenches about further back. A strong point around Bois Tripot and Château Sailly-Saillisel covered the southern approaches to the villages. The villages were bombarded by super-heavy ready for the attack on 7 October when the Fourth Army to the north attacked.

=====7 October=====
In the centre, the I Corps (General Adolphe Guillaumat) captured the line from Prilip to Portes de Fer to Négotin in early October and on 7 October, the 40th Division captured Terplitz and Berlin trenches, formed a flank on the south-west fringe of St Pierre Vaast Wood and gained a small part of Reuss Trench (later lost). The 56th Division to the left managed to advance up the slope west of the Saillisels, captured Carlsbad Trench and gained a footing in the Bois Tripot strongpoint beyond, which gave the French observation of the ground towards the Péronne–Bapaume road and the Saillisels. The attack was the most successful on the north side of the Somme but fell far short of Rocquigny and on the left flank I Corps, which had been in the line since August, was relieved by the IX Corps (General H. F. A. Pentel) ready for the next attack on 12 October. On the right flank, the attack of the XXXIII Corps (General A. Nudant) south of Bouchavesnes from failed, due to an ineffective bombardment and offensive operations were suspended for the winter.

=====12–18 October=====

In the second week of October, the XXXII Corps (General Henri Berthelot until 16 October then General M. E. Debeney) took over the right flank of I Corps and on 12 October, the corps got into Sailly-Saillisel but was forced out by German counter-attacks. On 15 October, the 66th Division exploited a crushing bombardment to capture the remainder of Bois Tripot, Château Saillisel; the 152nd Infantry Regiment and the 68th Battalion Chasseurs Alpins infiltrated between Prussian and Bavarian positions and spent the next six days fighting hand-to hand in the ruins. The 94th Infantry Regiment of the 66th Division held on against several German counter-attacks around the Péronne–Bapaume and Sailly-Saillisel to Moislains crossroads up to 29 October. On the right flank, the XXXII Corps Chasseurs gained a foothold in Reuss Trench but more attacks to capture the east side of Sailly-Saillisel were postponed because of bad weather until 5 November and took until 12 November to complete.

The 18th Division (IX Corps) attack on Bukovina Trench failed as did several later attacks and Fayolle sacked Pentel, despite the careful training he had given the corps before it entered the line. The 18th Division reported afterwards that ground observation posts had only a partial view over the trench, air observation was limited by frequent fog, rain and high winds. The French approach was up a slope, full of shell-craters and mud dotted with hidden machine-gun nests, dominated by German artillery and observation aircraft. French light machine-guns jammed and the infantry struggled through knee-high mud. On 17 October an attack on Baniska Trench failed when the French barrage fell short onto the 32nd Infantry Regiment as it waited for zero hour in an advanced jumping-off trench. The German counter-bombardment caught the support waves in the French front line and the advanced troops were caught in crossfire from machine-gun nests set up in front of Baniska Trench. The troops furthest forward were forced under cover, short of the trench and those on the flanks were unable to advance, which left the 32nd Infantry Regiment in a salient and bombarded by their artillery again, losing in the attack. Baniska Trench was eventually captured by the 152nd Division (General Andrieu) on 1 November, after Fayolle over-ruled Andrieu and insisted on an attack, which apparently surprised the Germans, who did think that one could occur in such abysmal conditions.

====Reserve Army====

The Reserve Army of the BEF (renamed Fifth Army on 29 October) continued its attacks from Courcelette near the Albert–Bapaume road, west to Thiepval on Bazentin Ridge. The Reserve Army attacked on Many smaller attacks were also made between frequent rainstorms, which turned the ground and roads into rivers of mud and grounded aircraft. German forces at the east end of (Regina Trench) and in the remaining parts of (Schwaben Redoubt) to the north and Stuff Redoubt () north-east of Thiepval, fought a costly defensive battle but Stuff Redoubt was captured on 9 October and the last German position in Redoubt fell on 14 October, exposing German positions in the Ancre valley to British ground observation.

A retreat up the Ancre valley was contemplated by Ludendorff and Rupprecht but rejected, due to the lack of better defensive positions further back, in favour of counter-attacks desired by Below the 1st Army commander. Gallwitz noted in early October that so many of his units had been transferred north of the Somme and that he had only one fresh regiment left in reserve. The German counter-attacks were costly failures and by 21 October, the British had advanced and taken all but the last German foothold in the eastern part of (Regina Trench). From British attacks were postponed due to rain and fog.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===

====Wilfrid Miles====
In 1938, Wilfrid Miles, the British official historian, wrote that by 12 October, the Germans were used to afternoon attacks; British battalions were at half-strength with only many being poorly-trained recruits. Lacking air observation for reconnaissance and artillery-observation in the poor weather, the infantry had struggled to advance towards German defences. The German machine-guns had been moved back to concealed positions beyond the depth of the British barrages, to sweep the attack front from long range. Rawlinson decided that the German defences would have to be subjected to a methodical bombardment and that the infantry must prepare more routes of supply from the rear and dig assembly trenches parallel to their objectives; Cavan suggested beginning a creeping barrage just beyond objectives and firing lots of smoke shells to hamper German observation but none were available. By mid-October, air reconnaissance was impossible because of rain and mist and artillery-observation could not be conducted on any great scale.

Shell bursts were smothered, guns became too worn for accurate fire and sank into the mud; the supply of ammunition was slowed by the condition of the ground and German bombardments. After the results of the attack on 18 October were known, the scope of the offensive was reduced and then washed out by more rain until 3 November. Cavan objected to more attacks on Le Transloy, except from the south, XIV Corps having already suffered Rawlinson and then Haig had agreed to stop the attack but changed their minds when the French insisted on an attack by the Sixth Army. XIV Corps was ordered to make a local attack to the east and north-east of Lesbœufs and the French told that only a general pressure would be exerted by rest of the Fourth Army. On 6 November, attacks were only to be made to stop the Germans from moving troops from the Western Front and to support the attacks of the Sixth Army.

====Andrew Simpson====
In 1995, Simpson wrote that the inability of the British artillery adequately to respond to the changes of German tactics may have been caused by the supply difficulties in October, when the gunners lacked the ammunition to extend creeping barrages all the way to the far side of German defences. Guns were worn out, ammunition had three types of propellant with inconsistent characteristics, all the ammunition was damp and corrections for atmospheric conditions were insufficient to regain accuracy, without observation of targets or information on the fall of shot from artillery-observation aircraft. In 2001, Simpson described the process of forming plans by the Fourth Army headquarters to be one of consultation and negotiation with corps commanders, provided that decisions were compatible with the corps artillery plan, which was derived from the army plan. Corps then set boundaries and let divisional commanders have discretion within them. By October corps headquarters were aware of the importance of passing information from contact-patrol aircraft and other sources forward to divisions, the corps headquarters developing into information clearing-houses by the end of the battle.

====Gary Sheffield====
In 2003, Sheffield described the tactical conditions on the Fourth Army front in similar terms to that of Wilfrid Miles, the official historian and that attacks continued in mud, which slowed movement to a crawl and in which had taken ten hours to move an Australian brigadier to a dressing station. Charles Bean, the Australian official historian called the conditions &quot;the worst ever known to the First A. I. F.&quot;. Sheffield wrote that Haig was in a coalition &quot;strait-jacket&quot; with the French as the senior partners, which other writers and historians had underestimated. Joffre had wanted another offensive towards Bertincourt, Bapaume and Achiet-le-Grand and the Sixth Army continued its attack, which Haig felt bound to support. Sheffield wrote that Philpott&#x27;s view that Haig continued the offensive &quot;in the broader interests of the alliance&quot;, was correct.

In 2011, Sheffield wrote that the new German defences built behind the third position in the onset of autumn required a series of bite and hold attacks, which were beyond the ability of the British to arrange in time to reach open country. In late September, Haig had ordered an ambitious three-army offensive operation toward Cambrai but despite showing increasing tactical skill and inflicting many losses on the Germans, the territorial gains were &quot;miserly&quot;. Haig persisted because he believed that attrition was working, the British Expeditionary Force was improving and that he overestimated the capacity of the armies in a wet and muddy season. The pressure from Joffre to continue was also significant, Haig wrote sympathetically of Cavan&#x27;s protest in November but that the French could not be left in the lurch. In late October Haig reminded Joffre that although subordinate to French strategy he retained discretion over the operational and tactical matters of where, when and how.

====Robin Prior and Trevor Wilson====
In 2005, Prior and Wilson wrote that the weather in September had been unusually good with only two rainstorms but that mid-autumn on the Somme was usually much wetter and that the British would be attacking into a valley, which would require a advance to get beyond. The Fourth Army managed to capture Eaucourt l&#x27;Abbaye in early October but German artillery-fire increased in volume, suggesting that a collapse was unlikely. When the weather broke, the next attack had to be postponed until 7 October, when six British and a French division attacked and mostly failed except at Le Sars, because the lack of air reconnaissance led to an inaccurate bombardment, German reverse-slope defences had disguised new defences and long-range machine-gun fire was not suppressed by the creeping barrage. On 12 October, the Fourth Army attacked with five divisions and had similar results, with some battalions managing to advance but none gaining the first objective, due to the weather hampering air reconnaissance and artillery-observation and because German long-range machine-gun fire came from guns dispersed evenly around the battlefield to evade British artillery bombardments.

All of the divisions in the Fourth Army were short of infantry after the September battles and those in early October depleted the infantry further, even in divisions considered fresh. The comparative failure of the attacks to gain ground was ascribed to lack of surprise, poor observation, the German recovery and long-range machine-gun fire. Rawlinson wanted to delay attacks to assure good air support, different zero hours and the digging of jumping-off trenches to orientate the infantry in the featureless landscape and greater depth to creeping barrages, to hit the German machine-guns far to the rear. These tactical requirements were contradicted by the operational and strategic necessity of continuing the battle through the winter and the attack on 18 October went ahead despite the requirements not being met, except for zero hour being set for which led to the attack taking place in darkness, because low cloud obscured the moon. Haig reduced the scope of attacks but the effort on 23 October was another costly failure.

The constant rain confined supply traffic to one road from Longueval to Flers, which was frequently bombarded by German artillery, which made the difficulties of supply much worse. Another attack was ordered for 5 November and Prior and Wilson described the representations made by Cavan, the XIV Corps commander, who wrote that he was willing to sacrifice men to support the Sixth Army on the right but that a failure would be no help and could lead to the men losing confidence in their commanders. A local attack on 3 November was another failure and Cavan insisted that Rawlinson witness the conditions at the front. Rawlinson agreed that attacks were futile, which Haig accepted until a meeting with Foch, where he was persuaded to continue to attack. Prior and Wilson wrote that the attack on 5 November was another failure but smaller costly attacks continued for the rest of the month, despite not improving the tactical situation of the Fourth Army.

====J. P. Harris====
In 2008, Harris wrote that in late September there had been legitimate grounds for thinking that the German defence of the Somme might collapse. German troops had lost morale, surrendered more willingly and suffered more casualties in September than in any other month. Air reconnaissance had revealed that the Germans were building three more defensive lines () but , in front of Le Transloy, was far less formidable than the three lines overrun since July. Harris also wrote of the rain and mud and that the Germans had relieved exhausted divisions during the respite, reinforced the artillery and moved machine-guns to the rear, where they were less vulnerable but could fire through barrages at the British infantry.

The Fourth Army attacks on 7, 12 and 18 October had captured little ground at great cost, against far less formidable defences than earlier in the battle. By the middle of the month, Haig and Rawlinson agreed that the army could not remain in its positions on such low ground through the winter but that the attacks of 23, 28 and 29 October were costly failures, in an even worse morass than earlier in the month. Fresh troops became exhausted just moving up to the front line and in most of the Fourth Army divisions battalion strengths had fallen from to knee deep in mud, eating cold food and soaking wet. Despite reports of the conditions and Cavan&#x27;s objections, attacks in support of the Sixth Army continued. The British lost another for no gain of ground and the French also had meagre results, which led Foch to accept that little more could be achieved on the Fourth and Sixth army fronts.

====William Philpott====
In a 2014 publication, Philpott wrote that the size and tempo of Anglo-French attacks of September could not be maintained in October and November; attacks became smaller and less ambitious. The British Expeditionary Force had become more proficient since July and the French continued to improve but the wet weather, high winds and shorter days made the delivery of supplies to the front line and the evacuation of wounded extraordinarily difficult. The attacks of the Sixth Army, south of the Fourth Army, were also postponed because of the weather; French aircraft were grounded and the flow of supplies interrupted. Attacks from achieved little and the offensive south of Bouchavesnes towards Péronne was abandoned. The French continued to attack to the north-east to capture the Saillisels, next to the British attacks towards Bapaume.

The Fourth Army attacked a low ridge running north-west from Le Transloy to Ligny but achieved little success amidst a jumble of trenches, derelict artillery positions and strong points. New German trenches dug between the Flers and Gird lines formed tiers of defences to fight from, which became a wasteland due to the ceaseless bombardments. The Fourth Army slowly advanced into a dip overlooked from Le Transloy and Warlencourt and towards the Butte de Warlencourt, from which German observers could see all round. Deliberate attacks on 7, 12, 18 and 23 October and smaller local attacks were quickly forced to ground by German machine-gun fire on the XIV and XV corps fronts but III Corps captured Le Sars, before being held up around the defences of the Butte. The Sixth Army experienced its worst fighting of the battle to capture the Saillisels, attacking on a in the same conditions as the Fourth Army, with the same results for the same reasons. On the right of the attack, the French had more success and closed up on the southern approach to the villages but after 7 October this advance also slowed. In the middle of the month the villages were entered but not entirely captured until 12 November.

The capture of the Saillisels and Le Sars were the only notable geographical successes in October and November. The German armies endured the same physical conditions but had a much narrower beaten zone between the front line and comparatively undamaged terrain. Mud reduced the effect of Allied artillery, many shells not exploding or being smothered, and mud clogged small arms being carried over no man&#x27;s land. British divisions fighting on the Somme for the second time had gained experience but German divisions had been kept in action for longer, new divisions were committed before they were ready and both sides had difficulty in replacing losses. The German army created fifteen new divisions in the autumn from garrison troops, older conscript classes, reservists, the last depot reserves and the 1917 conscript class. The French filled gaps with &quot;shirkers&quot;, workers being disciplined and youths of the 1917 class. In the British Expeditionary Force, the first conscripts arrived and on 16 October, Private Harry Farr was shot by firing squad as an example, despite extenuating circumstances. Fayolle judged that the battle should end and that the armies should wait for spring but in November, protests from senior officers like Cavan and the inspection report of Major John Gort were set aside.

Haig, Foch and Joffre insisted on continuing the offensive on the Somme, despite the appalling conditions, to support the battles at Verdun and on the Eastern Front, where the Russians were attacking in Galicia and Rumania was being overrun. On the Southern Front, the Italian army was on the offensive and an attack had begun in Macedonia on the Balkan Front. Philpott wrote that Allied fire power was still &quot;purgatory&quot; for the German infantry; Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16 fought on the Somme from 2 to 12 October and was &quot;eviscerated&quot; after suffering The regiment had been &quot;dragged along in the darkness and night [and] spewed out in ruins&quot;. The increased number of German divisions, aircraft, artillery and ammunition sent to the Somme front in September and October reduced the effectiveness Anglo-French attacks in October but from 20 October to 2 November, the French armies attacked at Verdun, exploiting the depletion of the 5th Army. The French advanced recaptured Fort Douaumont on 24 October and Fort Vaux on 3 November. On the Somme, the French armies continued small attacks in November along with the British but from 14 to 16 November, the Germans counter-attacked at Bouchavesnes, re-taking part of the Saillisels and Reuss Trench.

Foch showed that a well-organised battle could be fought in a manner which was &quot;not unduly costly&quot; but that the Allies had not accumulated enough resources to defeat decisively the Germans. In September, Foch had managed to get the four Entente armies on the Somme to make co-ordinated attacks, which brought the Germans close to collapse. In October, the autumn rains soaked the ground and slowed the tempo of attacks, which resembled the (nibbling) of late July and August. Such smaller, un-coordinated attacks could depress German morale but not deplete manpower at the rate achieved in September. The systems of organisation and supply to maintain long offensives were not adequate to deliver the vast amounts of food, ammunition and equipment needed by million-man armies, even over the pre-war infrastructure of northern France. A reorganisation was begun, using light railways to link railheads to the armies but this change did not mature until 1917 and became part of a cycle of initiative and response by the belligerents, which continued the battlefield equilibrium.

===Casualties===

The 21st Division suffered from and New Zealand Division casualties from were The 6th Division had from and during the month the 4th Division recorded just over the 8th Division had about from and the 29th Division lost from The 30th Division had casualties of from 
====Mud====
Rain during the summer had turned soil to mud but the heavier autumn rains created a much longer-lasting variety, a mixture of soil and the chalky subsoil, which became &quot;liquid, yellow-grey mud&quot; which had extraordinary buoyancy and stuck to everything, covering men and jamming gun mechanisms and rifles. On roads, the mud stuck to wheels and caked the hooves of horses and mules. Men on foot were coated up to the knee and movement off the roads became impossible. Shell craters filled with a quicksand, which could drown soldiers and animals; a French writer called the Somme mud the worst on the Western Front. Engineers laboured all summer to keep roads open and to lay new ones, build corduroy roads of logs and railway sleepers and laid duckboard tracks as the front moved eastwards. The slow Anglo-French advance increased the distance that supplies had to be carried, from the intact road system in the rear to the front line on the far side of the beaten zone, which brought the transport system close to collapse whenever it rained. More vehicles on the roads accelerated their decrepitude and Bean wrote that many of the lorries broke down and were pushed aside.

Haig wrote on 21 November that

Stretcher-bearers worked four to a stretcher, reinforced by pioneers, men from divisional supply trains and anyone else who could be spared, including prisoners. From Gueudecourt to the Longueval tramway, the carry was in three stages. Illness increased in the British armies. Routine measures to prevent trench foot, by rubbing feet with whale oil and donning dry socks, reduced the number of cases compared to 1915, despite the increase in the size of the BEF. Combined frostbite and trench foot admissions to hospital in 1916 were against year previous. On the week ending 28 October, there were next week and the next two weeks. By 30 December, had been admitted in the British Expeditionary Force in the year, about as measured by ration strength.

==Subsequent operations==

===23 October===

After the dismal result of the attack on 18 October, Foch, Haig, Rawlinson and Gough met and agreed to reduce the scope of attacks, weather permitting. The Fourth and Sixth armies were to attack on 23 October towards Le Transloy, ready to capture the village on 26 October, as the French advanced towards Rocquigny in stages. The full programme for the armies on the Somme was washed out, despite urging by Joffre for another general attack; Haig rejected the pressure from Joffre and denied that he was procrastinating. It was dry from as XIV Corps prepared to attack to the far side of the spur in front of Le Transloy, where after a thirty-minute halt, the creeping barrage would move at per minute, followed by the infantry, whose battalions had fallen lower than half-strength during the recent fighting. Dawn was so foggy that Cavan agreed a postponement with the French from The 4th Division attacked with two battalions of the 11th Brigade, next to the French 152nd Division.

The 1st Hampshire and the French were quickly stopped by enfilade fire from Boritska/Baniska Trench opposite and from machine-guns hidden in shell-holes but when reinforced by the 1st Rifle Brigade, established posts north-west of the trench. To the left, the 2nd Royal Dublin Fusiliers joined with the left of the Hampshire, after capturing gun-pits and a strong point further on. The 1st Royal Warwick were to leap-frog through the Fusiliers but became mixed up and attempts to advance were defeated in hand-to-hand fighting and then flanking fire from both sides. The 12th Brigade on the left was defeated by machine-gun fire from Dewdrop Trench near the Lesbœufs–Le Transloy road, parties of the 2nd Essex who got into the trench being overwhelmed. The 1st King&#x27;s Own captured the German part of Spectrum Trench to the north of Dewdrop Trench and then advanced further; help arrived from bombers of the 2nd Dukes but only Spectrum Trench could be held.
The 6th Division had been relieved by the 8th Division and the 23rd Brigade attacked with the 2nd Scottish Rifles and 2nd Middlesex, capturing Zenith Trench. The Rifles advanced another and took Orion Trench but were bombarded out again late in the afternoon, as Middlesex attempts to bomb northwards failed. On the left the 25th Brigade attacked the north end of Zenith Trench with the 2nd Lincolnshire, which was stopped by small-arms fire, except for a few men who linked with the 2nd Middlesex. The 2nd Rifle Brigade further left was unable to capture a strong point where Zenith and Eclipse trenches met but managed to set up posts about forward of the British front line. In the 24th Brigade area, the 2nd East Lancashire captured most of Mild Trench, took about fifty prisoners and defeated counter-attacks from the flanks.

===24 October – 3 November===
Having relieved the 4th Division on the night of the 1st Middlesex and 4th King&#x27;s Liverpool of the 33rd Division (Major-General Reginald Pinney) attacked at and captured Rainy and Dewdrop trenches but by both had been bombed back out of Dewdrop Trench. Next day the 19th Brigade attacked on the right of the division with the 1st Cameron and the 5/6th Scottish Rifles, to take more of Boritska Trench but were repulsed by fire from machine-guns in shell holes. During the day, the 17th (Northern) Division (Major-General Philip Robertson) relieved the 8th Division. On 30 October the 1st Anzac Corps (Lieutenant-General William Birdwood) relieved the XV Corps between XIV and III corps.

On 1 November, the French attacked from the south, heading towards the Saillisels but were forced back BIR 20, which took 208 prisoners. On the night of 31 October – 1 November, a regiment of the 39th Division prepared the jumping-off points for a counter-attack by IR 126 and IR 132 at but the two attacking regiments were late and arrived exhausted. Air support was cancelled because of the weather and the French were ready when the attack began; German artillery fired short and French small arms fire repulsed the attack. French attacks continued for the next week and a small part of St Pierre Vaast wood was captured on 5 November, through gaps in the positions of IR126 and IR 172. On 9 November, the French and British attacked from Bouchavesnes to the Ancre and next day the 185th Division relieved the 39th Division, in which IR 126 had lost including 

On the Fourth Army front, the 19th Brigade of the 33rd Division attacked again with the 1st Cameronians and the 5/6th Scottish Rifles, who got into Boritska Trench but were repulsed. At the 1/9th Highland Light Infantry (1/9th HLI) and the 2nd Worcester attacked Boritska Trench with the French but mud, exhaustion and machine-gun fire from Le Transloy forced them back out. Next day the 17th (Northern) Division tried a surprise attack at with a party of the 7th Borders (51st Brigade) and captured the rest of Zenith Trench. A counter-attack was defeated and a trench block set up along Eclipse Trench. On 3 November the 7th Lincolns of the 51st Brigade repulsed a counter-attack on Zenith Trench and cleared a German foothold, assisted by the 7th Green Howards that evening. An attack by the 1st Queen&#x27;s of the 100th Brigade on Boritska Trench failed.

====4–15 November====
On 4 November, a 98th Brigade attack on a ridge east of Dewdrop Trench failed and on 5 November, the 33rd Division attacked at with the 2nd Worcester, who captured Boritska and Mirage trenches and joined with the 16th KRRC that had captured Hazy Trench. In the 19th Brigade area to the left, the 2nd Royal West Kent advanced along the Lesbœufs–Le Transloy road but was unable to hold on, after patrols of the 7th East Yorkshire and 7th Green Howards of the 50th Brigade on the left were repulsed. The 1st Anzac Corps attacked on the left at with the 1st Australian Division in a downpour, against a salient north of Gueudecourt. In the 1st Brigade, the 3rd Battalion bombed forward but the repulse of the 1st Battalion during two frontal attacks and a bombing attack on Hilt Trench, forced a withdrawal on the 3rd Battalion. The 7th Brigade attacked with the 27th Battalion on the right flank, a composite battalion of the 25th Battalion and a company each from the 26th and 27th battalions in the centre and the 28th Battalion on the left, in which parties of the 27th Battalion entered Bayonet Trench and then retired at dusk. Troops of the composite battalion reached the Maze and held on but the 28th Battalion was repulsed twice and retired.

On 8 November, the 33rd Division was relieved by the 8th Division and after a lull with some dry days and on 14 November, the 2nd Australian Division made a joint attack with the 28th, 25th and 27th battalions of the 7th Brigade. The 28th Battalion was relieved by the 19th Battalion bought up from reserve. The 50th Division on the right of III Corps co-operated with the 1/5th and 1/7th Northumberland Fusiliers of the 149th Brigade, the combined attack beginning at In the 2nd Australian Division area to the right of Blue Cut that ran from le Barque to Eaucourt l&#x27;Abbaye, the 25th and 26th battalions to the right of the 19th Battalion were stopped by machine-gun from the Maze and artillery-fire from the vicinity of Bapaume. The 19th Battalion and the 1/5th Northumberland Fusiliers captured of Gird Trench but were unable to take Gird Support Trench further on. The trench was found to have flooded; the British and Australian troops retired to Gird Trench, where they were cut off. The 1/7th Northumberland to the left of the 1/5th Northumberland, may have captured Hook Sap but did not secure their part of Gird Trench; they were fired on from Butte Trench and disappeared.

Later in the day, two counter-attacks were repulsed and half of the 20th (NSW) Battalion attacked the Maze at but was stopped by machine-gun fire. At midnight, troops from the 1/4th and 1/5th Northumberland attacked on the opposite flank but were forced back. On 15 November, the remnants of the 1/5th and 19th (NSW) battalions that had met were isolated in part of Gird Trench with a Lewis gun at either end. Rifle ammunition was used to feed the Lewis guns that engaged frequent German attacks. German , supported by artillery around Bapaume, made a determined attack from both ends of Gird Trench and the British and Australians were relieved at dawn by the 28th Battalion and two companies of the 1/4th East Yorkshire. Opposite the French Sixth Army, Operation Hanover (), a plan to recapture the fringe of St Pierre Vaast wood on 15 November succeeded; attacks to recapture the Saillisels failed and the Germans occupied shell hole positions on the outskirts.

==Commemoration==

===Newfoundland Memorial===
The participation of the Newfoundland Regiment in the Battle of Le Transloy is commemorated with the Gueudecourt Newfoundland Memorial. The memorial marks the place where the Newfoundlanders returned to the Somme in early October, after many losses incurred four months earlier, during an attack at Beaumont Hamel, on the First day of the Somme. The rebuilt Newfoundland Battalion, part of the 88th Brigade, attacked on the right flank of XV Corps with the 1st Battalion Essex Regiment (1st Essex) and captured part of Hilt Trench, an extension of Rainbow Trench north-east of Gueudecourt. The 1st Essex pressed on and parties reached Grease Trench but then had to retire to the start line when the 35th Brigade attack on the left failed. The Newfoundlanders held on in Hilt Trench and also bombed up it to capture some of the Essex objective and established a trench block The memorial also marks the furthest point that the British advanced from the front line of 1 July, during the Somme offensive. The Rifle Brigade counted Le Transloy as one of their battle honours for the Somme.

<text>The Lexus ES is a series of mid-size executive cars marketed since 1989 by Lexus, the luxury division of Toyota, across multiple generations, each offering V6 engines and a front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout. The first five generations of the ES used the Toyota Camry platform, while the latter generations are more closely related to both the Camry and the Avalon. Manual transmissions were offered until 1993, a lower-displacement inline-four engine became an option in Asian markets in 2010, and a gasoline-electric hybrid version was introduced in 2012. The ES was Lexus&#x27;s only front-wheel drive vehicle until 1998, when the related RX was introduced, and the sedan occupied the entry-level luxury car segment of the Lexus lineup in North America and other regions until the debut of the IS in 1999. The ES name stands for &quot;Executive Sedan&quot;. However, some Lexus importers use the name, &quot;Elegant Sedan&quot;.

Introduced in 1989, the first generation ES 250 was one of two vehicles in Lexus&#x27;s debut range, along with the LS 400. The second generation ES 300 debuted in 1991, followed by the third generation ES 300 in 1996, and the fourth generation ES 300/330 in 2001. The first- through fourth generation sedans shared body styling elements with Japan-market Toyota sedans, and a domestic market equivalent, the , was sold until the launch of the fifth generation ES in 2006. The word &quot;Windom&quot; is a combination of &quot;win&quot; and the suffix &quot;dom&quot; expresses a state of perpetual victory. The fifth generation ES used body styling marketed by Lexus as L-finesse and debuted in early 2006 as a 2007 model. The sixth generation ES debuted in the first half of 2012 as a 2013 model, and features increased cabin dimensions due to a longer wheelbase which is shared with the full-size XX40 series Avalon.

Lexus has positioned the ES in the comfort luxury segment, with an emphasis on interior amenities, quietness, and ride quality, in contrast with more firm-riding sport sedans. Buyers seeking more performance-focused models are targeted by the Lexus IS and rival makes, with such models offering a sportier drive with differently tuned suspensions. In Europe, Japan and other markets where it was not available until the seventh generation model, the GS sport sedans occupy the mid-size category in the Lexus lineup until it was cancelled August 2020. In the United States, the ES has been the best-selling Lexus sedan for over fifteen years.


== First generation (V20; 1989) ==
=== 1989–1991 ===

The first generation ES (VZV21) debuted in January 1989 at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit as part of the launch of the Lexus division. In order to avoid introducing the nameplate with only one model, the LS 400, Lexus quickly developed the ES to debut alongside their flagship sedan. The smaller representative of the initial two-sedan Lexus lineup was designated the ES 250, and powered by the Camry&#x27;s 2.5 L, V6, which was aimed directly at the Acura Legend. The ES 250 was based on the Camry Prominent/Vista (V20). Design patents were filed on 17 November 1987, at the Japan Patent Office under the patent number 0666961-006 and registered on 8 August 1989.

On the exterior, the ES 250 shared the same general body style and overall dimensions as its Toyota counterparts, but had a more prominent grille, bigger tail lights, chrome trim, frameless windows, and distinct wheel design similar to its LS brethren. Inside the cabin, the ES 250 featured a six-speaker Pioneer sound system, genuine wood trim, one-touch power windows, and leather seats. A four-speed automatic or five-speed manual transmission was offered. The Electronically Controlled Automatic Transmission (ECT) featured &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;power&quot; modes.

Safety features included a driver&#x27;s SRS airbag and anti-lock brakes. In typical specification, the ES 250 further included 15-inch alloy wheels, a power driver&#x27;s seat, power moonroof, and CD player. Leather upholstery was common equipment, despite being listed as an option, while some ES 250s were also produced with cloth interiors.

In September 1989, the ES 250 and the flagship LS 400 went on sale in the United States. The ES 250 was marketed as the &quot;luxury sedan of sports sedans,&quot; and carried a U.S. market suggested base price of approximately $22,000. During the first month of release, the ES 250 logged 1,216 units in sales. However, these numbers were eclipsed by the larger LS sedan, which unlike the ES was built on a unique and all-new platform. The original LS had been envisioned as a standalone model, but Lexus dealerships had asked for an additional vehicle to accompany its launch. Due to its similarities to the Camry, some viewed the ES 250 as a placeholder product of badge engineering and the vehicle ultimately did not sell as well as its larger counterpart. Initial perception of the ES led some to believe all the development time and research spent creating the larger LS showed that they overlooked one of the reasons the LS was developed, which was the 1986 Acura Legend, so it seems that the appearance of the LS was shrunk to fit the ES so as to compete with the Legend.

Production totaled 19,534 units in 1990 and 17,942 units in 1991, most for the automatic transmission model. Production commenced in June 1989 at Tsutsumi, with the first 1990 ES 250 rolling off the production line on 30 August 1989. Production ended on 5 July 1991. Because of its relatively brief production run, the ES 250 is a rare model on US roads today.

== Second generation (XV10; 1991) ==
=== 1991–1994 ===
In 1987, with creation of the Lexus brand, an entry level front-wheel Lexus model was ordered for development alongside the LS 400 and other offerings. In late 1988, a final design was chosen and design patents filed utilizing a clay 1:1 design model on February 3, 1989. In September 1991, for the 1992 model year, Lexus announced the second generation ES almost one year after the introduction of the second generation Acura Legend, but before Infiniti finally decided to add a similarly classed sedan, the J30. The second generation ES shared its design with the new generation Toyota Windom (XV10), which was officially announced in Japan on 30 September 1991, introduced at the October 1991 Tokyo Motor Show, and exclusive to Toyota Japan dealership sales channel called &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot; as the top level luxury sedan. The Windom itself shared elements with the latest generation of the Japan-market &quot;narrow-body&quot; V30 series Camry, and the &quot;wide-body&quot; Toyota Scepter but the Windom was offered as a pillared hardtop sedan while the Scepter was a conventional sedan.

Completely redesigned and now sharing design features with the XV10 series Toyota Windom and styling cues with the LS 400, the model was renamed the ES 300 to reflect the half-liter increase in engine displacement to 3.0-liters. The second generation ES was significantly larger and more curvaceous than its predecessor, gaining in length and of width. On the front fascia, the ES gained projector headlamps in a curved housing and a three-slat grille with the Lexus emblem moved above on the hood. The side profile featured an invisible B-pillar and frameless-window doors. The rear deck lid featured an integrated spoiler effect similar to the flagship LS 400, improving the ES model&#x27;s aerodynamics, now rated .

Inside the cabin, the second generation ES featured California walnut trim on the center console, leather seats, an eight-speaker premium sound system, and keyless entry. The added wheelbase length and overall width made for increased legroom and shoulder space than the previous model. Compared to its Camry relative, the ES 300 featured separate styling, a different suspension setup with front and rear independent MacPherson strut, and added weight amounting to . Much of this is due to increased dimensions, asphalt insulation in the body panels and additional on-board equipment. As with its predecessor, anti-lock brakes were standard.

The ES 300 sported a 3.0-liter &quot;3VZ-FE&quot; V6 engine and had an advertised time of 7.9 seconds. In Japan, where the ES was badged as the Toyota Windom, a 2.5-liter &quot;4VZ-FE&quot; version producing was made available in October 1993. Lexus offered a standard five-speed &quot;E53&quot; manual transmission and optional four-speed &quot;A540/1E&quot; automatic.

Production assembly of the ES 300 commenced on 9 September 1991, and the sedan went on sale later that year in the U.S. as a 1992 model. The sedan was not released in Europe, where similar Toyota models were offered. The second generation ES was a major sales success, becoming Lexus&#x27; best-selling vehicle overall. In its first full year of sales, the ES logged 39,652 units, and throughout the following years of its production run, sales reached near or above that figure. Although the initial US base price was $26,550, this increased to over $30,000 in later years. By 1994, in part because of the rising yen and high demand, the manufacturer&#x27;s suggested retail price had increased to $31,200, 19.3 percent more than the original 1992 figure. In 1993, a passenger airbag was added as standard equipment.

=== 1994–1996 ===
Minor updates were introduced in 1994 for the 1995 model year (August 1994 production), including: a revised grille insert (now with a three-slot grille, replacing the previous four-slot version), new headlights and fog lights, outside air temp readout, and CFC-free air conditioning. In North America, the 1994 update introduced the new all-aluminum &quot;1MZ-FE&quot; engine with . This change in engine resulted in a change in model code for the car (now known as the MCV10 series). Other markets retained the &quot;3VZ-FE&quot; engine (and thus retained the VCV10 model code).

In September 1995 for the 1996 model year, Lexus offered an ES 300 &quot;Coach Edition&quot;, featuring select Coach leather trim in the interior and a set of Coach luggage. Despite being its final year of sales, the 1996 ES 300 logged a 21 percent increase in sales over the previous year in the US, and 40,735 units were produced that year.

== Third generation (XV20; 1996) ==
=== 1996–1999 ===
From 1992 to 1996, chief engineer Kosaku oversaw development of the XV20 Lexus variant alongside the XV20 series Camry programme under project code 416T. In mid-1993, an exterior design concept by Hiroshi Okamoto was approved and later frozen for production in January 1994, later being patented on 9 November 1994 at the Japanese patent office, under patent No. 0796802. The third generation ES (designated MCV20) premiered in September 1996 for the 1997 model year, featuring a design that was an evolution of the VCV10. The new cars featured a 30 percent stiffer body with a more rakish profile and sharper lines, reflector headlights (as opposed to projector headlights), and a more upscale-feeling interior. Introduced at a gala event on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills hosted by actress Sharon Stone, the ES 300 featured one powertrain option, a 3.0-liter V6 capable of and of torque and a four-speed automatic – although a , 2.5-liter &quot;2MZ-FE&quot; V6 was also offered in the equivalent Japanese-market Windom. The ES 300 could go from in 7.7 seconds. The third generation ES was also slightly longer (overall length increased by ) but weighed less than the previous model, and its drag coefficient was , improved over its predecessor. For the first time, an Adaptive Variable Suspension, capable of adjusting individual wheels&#x27; dampers according to road conditions (within 0.0025 seconds), was offered.

Production commenced in August 1996 at the Tsutsumi plant in Toyota, Aichi, supplemented in May 1997 with Toyota Motor Kyushu&#x27;s Miyata plant at Miyawaka, Fukuoka.


Inside the cabin, the ES 300 featured a new electroluminescent Lexus Optitron instrument panel, walnut trim, and leather seats. Other luxury standard features included heated outside mirrors and an automatic climate control system. A power moonroof, a 230 watt Nakamichi premium sound system with in-glove-box mounted six-disc CD changer, HID Headlights, Adaptive Variable Suspension and heated seats were options.

The U.S. base price of the 1997 ES 300 was $30,395. The third generation ES expanded upon the success of the previous generation model, reaching a record-setting 58,430 units in sales in its first year, and recording sales in the 35,000–50,000 range throughout its production run.

In 1997 for the 1998 model year, the ES received a few updates, mainly consisting of a revised supplemental restraint system (next generation), standard front row side-torso airbags, and force limiting seat belt pre-tensioners that were designed to tighten the front seat passengers into their seats upon impact. Transponder chips were now also used in the keys as to provide added protection from theft. The power rating grew to in 1998 (1999 model year) due to the new &quot;1MZ-FE&quot; engine with variable valve timing (VVT-i).

The Lexus IS was introduced to European markets in 1999 and became the luxury marque&#x27;s entry-level model; by this time the ES was no longer sold in most European markets. Recent versions of the ES were sold in North America, Asia, and Australia.

There was a widespread engine oil gelling issue which could block oil from parts of the engine. After a US class action lawsuit, Toyota notified US owners that engines would be overhauled or replaced for free if damaged by the buildup of gelled oil.

=== 1999–2001 ===
The ES 300 received a mild facelift in 1999 for the 2000 model year that consisted of new, clear tail lights and turn signals, a revised front end with a new grill, headlights, and lower bumper with clear fog lights and larger alloy wheels. Inside, the interior received an electrochromatic mirror, more wood trim and slight revisions to the audio system. Xenon High-Intensity Discharge headlights with auto-leveling were now optional. From 1998 through 2001 (1999 to 2001 model years), a limited &quot;Coach Edition&quot; was offered, and in 1999 for 2000, a &quot;Platinum Edition&quot; package was offered, including power moonroof, unique interior trim, and custom alloy wheels.
== Fourth generation (XV30; 2001) ==
=== 2001–2003 ===
As development on the XV30 series Camry began in 1997, development of the XV30 ES commenced under chief engineer Kosaku Yamada, with styling being done through 1998 under design chief Makoto Oshima. In December 1998, a concept design by Kengo Matsumoto was approved and frozen for production in June 1999. Design patents were filed on 8 March 2000 at the Japan Patent Office and registered under patent No. 1098805. The larger, fourth generation ES (designated MCV30) debuted in July 2001 for the 2002 model year, one year after the Lexus IS became Lexus&#x27; entry-level car. The presence of the IS in the Lexus lineup enabled the company to give the new ES 300 a more upscale image and luxury feel by excising the sporting pretensions of the previous ES models. The more aerodynamic shape had a drag coefficient of . In Japan, the MCV30 Windom received a 2-star LEV rating.

Production occurred between July 2001 and September 2004 at the Tsutsumi plant in Toyota, Aichi, supplemented until December 2002 with Toyota Motor Kyushu&#x27;s Miyata plant. The Toyota-badged Windom version was launched in Japan in August 2001. In January 2003, production started at the Higashi Fuji plant at Susono, Shizuoka, lasting until the XV30 ended production in February 2006.


The cabin was fitted with California Walnut wood trim on the front dashboard, center console, and doors as well as exterior puddle lamps, floor-well lighting, chrome door handles, an electric rear sunblind, and rear-view mirrors that would automatically tilt downward in reverse gear. Available options, including a power rear sunshade, rain-sensing windshield wipers, a DVD-based navigation system, and a 240 watt Mark Levinson premium stereo system with a six-disc CD player, they were similar to features on the flagship LS 430 sedan.

Other features included a drive-by-wire electronic throttle, a five-speed automatic transmission, anti-lock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution and brake assist as well as electronic stability and traction control systems. The fourth generation ES was built in Kyūshū and Toyota, Aichi, Japan.

ES sales sold 71,450 units its first year, making it the best-selling luxury car in the United States. Throughout its production run, the fourth generation ES was Lexus&#x27; best-selling sedan, and outsold only in the Lexus model range by the RX luxury utility vehicle.

U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) crash test results in 2003 rated the ES 300 the maximum five stars in the Frontal Driver, Frontal Passenger, and Side Driver categories, and four stars in the Side Rear Passenger and Rollover categories.

The catalogue photos of the Japanese-spec XV30 series Windom were shot on location in New York City, United States. The original owner&#x27;s manual included a photo of the automobile with the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in the background. However, the Twin Towers were destroyed in the September 11 attacks, which occurred less than a month after the model&#x27;s JDM launch. Within a month of the attacks, Toyota issued a revised owner&#x27;s manual, this time with the Twin Towers digitally erased.

=== 2003–2006 ===

During 2003, for the 2004 model year, the American market received a revised 3.3-liter engine producing (later revised to , because of changes in SAE power testing procedures), and the car was renamed the ES 330 (codename MCV31, however, the 3.0 L engine MCV30 model was still available). Lexus released the limited ES 330 &quot;SportDesign&quot; special edition in 2004. The model featured the Adaptive Variable Suspension, 17-inch Y-spoke alloy wheels, Mark Levinson audio, interior upgrades, and special dark exterior colors.

In 2004 for the 2005 model year, the ES received a facelift with new front and rear fascias, clear taillights, projector headlights, and a redesigned grille. Inside, features included standard audio and display steering wheel-mounted controls, power adjustable pedals, heated and ventilated front seats, Bird&#x27;s Eye Maple trim and optional integrated satellite radio. Lexus also offered an exclusive ES 330 &quot;Black Diamond Edition&quot; in 2005, featuring black wood trim, iridescent Black Diamond paint, and a set of Tumi luggage.

== Fifth generation (XV40; 2006) ==
Lexus unveiled the fifth generation ES in February 2006 at the Chicago Auto Show for the 2007 model year. The line initially consisted of the ES 350 sedan, which as per previous models, featured front-wheel-drive and a V6 engine—now displacing 3.5 liters. The line was refreshed in 2009, during which more features were added, and a four-cylinder variant, the ES 240, was introduced for Asian markets. The fifth generation ES remained Lexus&#x27; top-selling sedan model in the North American and Asian markets, anchoring the marque&#x27;s entry-level model lineup. Like previous generations, the fifth generation ES was geared towards the comfort luxury segment, favoring a soft ride over sporty performance. It continued the previous generation&#x27;s direction of moving the ES more upscale in its design and features; Lexus touted the ES 350 as faster, more powerful, more aerodynamic, and more quiet than the original LS 400 flagship. Like its predecessors, the fifth generation ES continued to be made in Japan, at the Kyushu plant in Fukuoka, Japan. Despite being built in the country, the XV40 is left-hand drive only and was not sold in the Japanese market, as well as the other regions with right-hand drive.

=== 2006–2009 ===
The fifth generation ES (GSV40) debuted at the Chicago Auto Show in February 2006 as the ES 350, featuring a six-speed automatic transmission with a front-wheel drive aluminum 3.5 L &quot;2GR-FE&quot; V6 engine with intake and exhaust variable valve timing. The exterior design featured an all-new body in the style of Lexus&#x27; new design philosophy, L-finesse. The new design was sleeker than its predecessor, with a streamlined cabin and character lines across the hood, fenders, and rear pillars. The Lexus emblem returned to the grille for the first time since the first generation, and was placed at the center of a five-bar horizontal grille. For the debut 2007 models, Lexus introduced a number of unique colors exclusive to the ES 350, including Aquamarine Pearl, Royal Ruby Metallic, Moon Shell Mica, and Amber Pearl. The drag coefficient was &quot;C&quot;&quot;d&quot; 0.28. Compared to the preceding fourth generation ES 300/330, the fifth generation ES 350 was longer and wider overall, but with shorter overhangs.

The ES 350 interior featured walnut wood accents, leather seats, dual zone climate control with air filter, an MP3 player auxiliary input, power tilt and telescoping steering wheel, and eight standard airbags. A keyless entry and ignition system, Lexus SmartAccess, which does not require the electronic remote to be taken out of the driver&#x27;s pocket, was standard. Available new features included a 300-watt, 14-speaker Mark Levinson premium audio system, power seat cushion extender, radar-based adaptive cruise control, rain-sensing windshield wipers, power rear sunshade, DVD navigation system, and Lexus Park Assist, a sonar-based warning system with backup camera. For the first time, the ES offered an &quot;Ultra Luxury Package,&quot; which featured many of the aforementioned options along with a three-panel panoramic glass moonroof. The ES also featured a secondary start system, that runs on battery, so that the driver does not have to use the engine for accessory functions. The secondary system allowed the driver use the radio, GPS, Bluetooth, and air conditioning/heating. The instrument panel used Optitron gauges and LED lighting.

Lexus estimated that the ES 350&#x27;s engine-transmission combination allowed acceleration to in less than 7 seconds, but tests netted the ES 350 as being one of the fastest front-wheel drive luxury sedans then available. 0– was acquired in as little as 6.2 seconds by auto magazines, and the car showed a strong point of high-end power as it cleared the quarter-mile in 14.6 seconds while traveling at almost . Fuel economy was estimated at in the city and on the highway. Some commentators have complained that so much power to the front wheels has produced uncomfortable torque steer in both the new ES and Camry.

The ES 350 arrived at U.S. dealerships in late April 2006 as a 2007 model. The 2007 base price in the U.S. was $33,470. That year, the ES 350 was launched in North America, the Middle East, China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea and Taiwan. At the 2008 Chicago Auto Show, Lexus debuted a Pebble Beach Edition ES 350, produced in partnership with the Pebble Beach Company. The Pebble Beach ES 350 came in either Truffle Mica, Pearl Silver, or Obsidian Black exterior colors, with exterior and interior badging, along with the choice of either travel or golf products by the Callaway Golf Company or Viking Range cookware.

Safety features on the ES 350 included dual front airbags, knee airbags, side-torso and curtain airbags, along with traction control, Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), anti-lock brakes (ABS), and electronic brake-force distribution (EBD). A pre-collision system (PCS), which incorporates a grille-mounted sensor and retracts seatbelts and triggers full braking power, was optional, and came with the distance-aware Dynamic Radar Cruise Control system. The front passenger airbag used a twin-chamber design for reduced occupant discomfort upon deployment. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) crash test results in 2007 rated the ES 350 the maximum five stars in the Frontal Driver, Frontal Passenger, and Side Driver categories, and four stars in the Side Rear Passenger and Rollover categories.

Toyota recalled and replaced 55,000 optional all-weather rubber floor mats from the Camry and ES 350 in September 2007, citing the risk of unsecured mats jamming the accelerator pedal. In August 2009, the NHTSA probed the ES 350 following 40 acceleration control complaints, eight crashes and 12 injuries, with floor mats implicated in most cases. An accident involving a loaner ES 350 killed four persons near San Diego on 28 August. The NHTSA and San Diego County Sheriff&#x27;s Department found that the car was wrongly fitted with an unsecured SUV rubber floor mat; the mat had jammed the accelerator, which an earlier driver had complained about. On 29 September, a Toyota safety notice advised floor mat removal, shift to Neutral (N) gear in an emergency, with a 3-second push button ignition press for engine shutoff. On 29 November, the 2007–2010 MY floor mat recall was revised to add shorter accelerator pedals, thinner replacement mats, and a brake override feature which ignores accelerator input when the brake pedal is depressed.

=== 2009–2012 ===

In 2009, the 2010 model year ES underwent a mid-cycle facelift. A slightly revised grille resembled that of the new HS 250h, and the lower bumper and taillights were changed. Other exterior changes included chrome-trimmed side moulding, turn signal indicators on the side mirrors, and new split 5-spoke alloy wheels. Memory seating, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and rear seat-mounted side-impact airbags were now standard. The steering wheel controls now had hard touch buttons as opposed to the previous soft ones. The navigation system shared with the then current RX now included upgraded VoiceBox speech recognition, Bluetooth phone book downloading, and Lexus Insider, XM Weather, Sports, and Stocks reports, and switched from DVD based maps to an internal hard drive. Bluetooth streaming audio and a USB port that included iPod integration was now built into the stereo.

In 2010, the revised ES line gained a brake override feature which ignored accelerator input when the brake pedal was depressed, which was installed on new builds from January 2010. Debuting first in the Chinese auto market, the 2010 ES lineup added a second model, the ES 240 (ACV40), which was produced to comply with the country&#x27;s new emission laws for luxury cars, making it the first gasoline four-cylinder Lexus since the 2005 IS. The ES 240 received a 2.4L &quot;2AZ-FE&quot; inline-four engine producing and of torque at 4000 rpm.

Several awards won by the fifth generation ES include 2009 Best Upscale Car for the Money from &quot;U.S News &amp; World Report&quot;, &quot;AutoPacific&quot; 2009 Vehicle Satisfaction Award for Best Mid-size Luxury Car, and Best New Luxury Car (under $50k) Award in 2007 at the Canadian Car of the Year Awards, selected by the Automobile Journalists Association of Canada. The ES 350 has also been named &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; 2008 Best Buy in the Premium Midsize Class, &quot;ConsumerSearch&quot; Best &quot;budget&quot; luxury sedan of 2008, &quot;Kiplinger&#x27;s Personal Finance&quot; Best New Car for 2007, and Best in Class for 2008, &quot;Intellichoice&quot; Best Car Value Over $23,000 for 2007, and Polk Automotive Loyalty award for 2008.
== Sixth generation (XV60; 2012) ==
=== 2012–2015 ===
The sixth generation ES was revealed on 4 April 2012 at the New York International Auto Show. For its sixth generation, the model was introduced in ES 350 and hybrid ES 300h versions. The ES 350 came with a six-speed automatic transmission, while the hybrid ES 300h models came with an eCVT. Despite the fact that the redesigned ES and the XV50 series Camry still share the same platform, the two vehicles are somewhat less mechanically related, as the ES is now more closely related to the XX40 series Avalon which also uses a wheelbase. The interior added the Lexus Remote Touch interface, and an optional 835 watt Mark Levinson sound system. Several safety features were introduced for the 2013 model year such as Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA), Lane Departure Alert (LDA), and Pre-Collision System (PCS) but only in the highest package, the Technology package. All models had a backup camera and 10 airbags.

The ES 250 made its world debut at the April 2012 Beijing International Automotive Exhibition. This car is equipped with a 2.5-liter inline-four engine and a six-speed automatic transmission. ES 250, ES 300h, and ES 350 models are being offered in China. Production started on 6 July 2012 at Toyota Motor Kyushu&#x27;s Miyata plant.

This generation is export-only, not sold in Japan where it is manufactured, but has been offered in right-hand drive since late 2013, being sold in Australia, Brunei, South Africa, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Indonesia.

=== 2015–2018 ===

The facelifted ES was unveiled at the April 2015 Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition. Production of the updated ES 350 began at the Kentucky plant on 19 October 2015 for the 2016 model year—the first Lexus vehicle manufactured in the US.

The ES is also manufactured by Toyota Motor Kyushu for markets outside North America. This plant also supplies the hybrid ES to all global markets, as the Kentucky plant builds the ES 350 only and does not build the ES 300h.

== Seventh generation (XZ10; 2018) ==
The seventh generation ES was unveiled at the April 2018 Beijing International Automotive Exhibition. It is built on the same GA-K platform as the XX50 series Avalon and the XV70 series Camry. The F Sport variant also made its debut in this generation. All models come equipped with Lexus Safety System+ 2.0.

=== Markets ===

==== Europe ====
The seventh generation ES is the first to be sold in Europe, replacing the GS. It went on sale from September 2018 in Russia and other Eastern markets and from December 2018 in Western and Central Europe.

==== Asia ====
The ES was scheduled to be available in Japanese dealerships in the fourth quarter of 2018, making the debut of ES in the Japanese domestic market since the discontinuation of the XV30-based Windom as well as the introduction of Lexus brand to Japan 13 years prior.

Initial deliveries of ES 300h started on 24 October 2018 in Japan, where it replaced the smaller HS 250h and served as a front-wheel-drive counterpart of GS until the latter&#x27;s demise in 2020.

The Hong Kong model was unveiled on 15 September 2018. Models included the ES250 Executive/Premium and the ES300h Executive/Premium. Lexus Safety System+ became standard in 2019.

The Thailand model was unveiled on 17 August 2018. Models included the ES 300h Luxury/Grand Luxury/Premium.

Lexus began local assembly of the ES 300h in India, at its new assembly line at Toyota India&#x27;s plant in January 2020. Lexus is said to have invested $100 million in this new assembly line.

==== North America ====

===== United States =====
In the US, the ES lineup went on sale in September 2018.

The US market ES was redesigned with an F Sport Trim that was never available on the ES line. This was done to attract a younger audience into purchasing or leasing an ES. The 2019 model year line-up includes three trim levels – the base 3.5-liters trim, the Hybrid trim and the F Sport 3.5-liters trim. All ES models comes standard with Lexus Safety System+ 2.0 that includes Pre-Collision System (PCS) with Pedestrian Detection, Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist, Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC), Lane Tracing Assist (LTA) and Road Sign Assist (RSA). The ES also features Apple CarPlay as an option. Other options include the Mark Levinson surround audio system and navigation with Amazon Alexa support.

Originally, only the ES 350 and ES 300h were offered. In 2020, for the 2021 model year, the ES 250 was added that also introduced Toyota&#x27;s AWD drivetrain previously known as All-Trac. A Black Line Special Edition package was also added for the F Sport. For the hybrid, the nickel-metal hydride battery was replaced by a more compact lithium-ion battery. The reduction in the height of the pack freed up trunk space, and the lower weight improved the front-to-rear weight distribution, which benefited handling.

==== 2021 facelift ====
The first facelift model was unveiled in April 2021 for the 2022 model year. It was the first year that offered an AWD, the 50/50 maximum torque distribution provided equal torque between the front and rear wheels. The grille has a spindle design with horizontal slats instead of a mesh design and smaller side scoops were used on the sides of the car than the previous year. The daytime running lights got updated, featuring V-shaped LEDs. The interior also got updated. The infotainment system got a touch-screen, and it also had the touch pad from the center console. The standard 8-inch was moved up an extra 4.3 inches for easier accessibility. A 12.3-inch unit was offered in 2021. There were also rear view cameras added instead mirrors for better visibility, and they were installed at the bottom of the A-pillar.

==== 2024 facelift ====
The second facelift model was unveiled on 15 November 2024. Changes includes an updated front fascia with new headlights and new grille design, updated rear fascia with new taillights combined with a full-width light bar, the Lexus logo replaced with the brand lettering on the boot lid, a redesigned rear bumper with the exhaust pipes hidden, and the interior receives a larger 14-inch touchscreen infotainment system and fewer physical controls.

<text>The Battle of the Ancre Heights (1 October – 11 November 1916), is the name given to the continuation of British attacks after the Battle of Thiepval Ridge from during the Battle of the Somme. The battle was conducted by the Reserve Army (renamed Fifth Army on 29 October) from Courcelette near the Albert–Bapaume road, west to Thiepval on Bazentin Ridge. British possession of the heights would deprive the German 1st Army of observation towards Albert to the south-west and give the British observation north over the Ancre valley to the German positions around Beaumont-Hamel, Serre and Beaucourt. The Reserve Army conducted large attacks on and from 

Many smaller attacks were made in the intervening periods, amid interruptions caused by frequent heavy rain, which turned the ground and roads into rivers of mud and grounded aircraft. German forces in footholds on the ridge, at the east end of (Regina Trench) and in the remaining parts of (Schwaben Redoubt) to the north and Stuff Redoubt () north-east of Thiepval, fought a costly defensive battle with numerous counter-attacks and attacks, which delayed the British capture of the heights for more than a month.

Stuff Redoubt fell on 9 October and the last German position in Redoubt fell on 14 October, exposing the positions of the 28th Reserve Division in the Ancre valley to British ground observation. A German retreat from the salient that had formed around St. Pierre Divion and Beaumont Hamel either side of the Ancre, was considered by Erich Ludendorff and the new army group commander Field Marshal Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria and rejected, due to the lack of better defensive positions further back, in favour of counter-attacks desired by General Fritz von Below the 1st Army commander. General Max von Gallwitz the 2nd Army commander, noted in early October that so many of his units had been moved to the 1st Army north of the Somme, that he had only one fresh regiment in reserve.

The German counter-attacks were costly failures and by 21 October, the British had managed to advance and take all but the last German foothold in the eastern part of (Regina Trench). A French offensive during the Battle of Verdun on 24 October, forced the Germans to suspend the movement of troops to the Somme front. From British attacks were postponed due to more poor weather, before the capture of of the eastern end of Regina Trench by the 4th Canadian Division on 11 November. Fifth Army operations resumed in the Battle of the Ancre (13–18 November).
==Background==

===Strategic developments===
At the end of September, the Anglo-French armies had crossed the Péronne–Bapaume road around Bouchavesnes, taken Morval, Lesbœufs and Gueudecourt in the centre and captured most of Thiepval Ridge on the northern flank. On 29 September, Sir Douglas Haig instructed the Fourth Army to plan operations to advance towards Bapaume, reaching Le Transloy on the right and Loupart Wood north of the Albert–Bapaume road on the left. The Reserve Army was to extend the attacks of the Fourth Army by making converging attacks on the Ancre valley, attacking northwards from Thiepval Ridge towards Loupart Wood–Irles–Miraumont and eastwards on the north bank of the Ancre, by attacking towards Puisieux on a front from Beaumont Hamel to Hébuterne, with the right flank meeting the attacks from the south at Miraumont, to envelop German troops in the upper Ancre valley. The Third Army was to provide a flank guard north of the Reserve Army, by occupying a spur south of Gommecourt. The Reserve Army operations were to begin by 12 October, after the Fourth Army had attacked towards Le Transloy and Beaulencourt and the French Sixth Army had attacked Sailly-Saillisel around 7 October. The French Tenth Army south of the Somme was to attack on 10 October north of Chaulnes. Normal autumn weather in the Somme region would be an obstacle but an exceptional amount of rain and mist grounded aircraft and created vast mud fields, which caused many attacks to be postponed. Haig issued a much less ambitious directive on 7 October but the poor weather, German tactical changes and reinforcements on the Somme front, led to the costly failure of many attacks by both sides.

After meeting with Rawlinson and Gough, Haig cancelled the Third Army operation on 17 October. The Reserve Army plan for a converging attack towards the Ancre, was limited to an attack up the valley on 23 October. The failure of the Fourth Army attack of 18 October caused another revision of the plan, with II Corps of the Reserve Army to capture the rest of Thiepval Ridge on 19 October, the Fourth and French Sixth armies to attack on 23 October and the less ambitious Reserve Army attack to begin on 25 October. Gough issued a new operation order on 15 October and began another reorganization on the north side of the Ancre. There was more heavy rain on 19 October, which led a delay of the II Corps operation until 21 October. The attack succeeded but the rains returned on 24 October and the main attack next day was postponed. Gough was given discretion by Haig to make further postponements, on 27 October Gough set 1 November as the provisional date, postponed it again on 29 October to 5 November and on 3 November Haig gave Gough the choice of cancelling the attack; Haig also suggested a subsidiary attack while waiting for the weather to improve, if the state of the ground justified the effort. Gough proposed an attack on 9 November but preferred to wait for better weather. Haig agreed that no attack should begin until the ground was dry enough for infantry to move freely, when there was a forecast of two days of fair weather and another postponement followed.

In August the German armies on the Somme had been subjected to great strain. IX Reserve Corps had been &quot;shattered&quot; in the defence of Pozières, the 18th Reserve Division having lost . Ten fresh divisions had been brought into the Somme front and an extra division had been put into the line opposite the British. Movement behind the German front was made difficult by constant Anglo-French artillery-fire, which added to equipment shortages by delaying rail deliveries and interrupting road maintenance. Damage, wear, defective ammunition, capture and destruction had left guns and guns in the two German armies out of action by the end of August. The artillery situation was only slowly improved by the plan devised by Gallwitz to centralize counter-battery fire and use the reinforcements of aircraft to observe artillery fire. The extra aircraft had little effect on Allied air superiority but were able eventually to increase the accuracy and efficiency of bombardments.

The 2nd Army had been starved of reinforcements in mid-August to replace exhausted divisions in the 1st Army and plans for a counter-stroke had been abandoned for lack of troops. The emergency in Russia caused by the Brusilov Offensive, the entry of Rumania into the war and French counter-attacks at Verdun put further strain on the German army. Falkenhayn was sacked from the supreme command () on 28 August and replaced by Hindenburg and Ludendorff. The new supreme command (Third OHL) ordered an end to attacks at Verdun and the despatch of troops from the area to Rumania and the Somme front. On 5 September, proposals for a new shorter line to be built in France were ordered from the commanders of the western armies, who met Hindenburg and Ludendorff at Cambrai on 8 September, where they announced that no reserves were available for offensive operations except those planned for Rumania. Ludendorff condemned the policy of holding ground regardless of its tactical value and advocated holding front-line positions with the minimum of troops and the recapture of lost positions by counter-attacks.

On 15 September, Rupprecht was ordered to prepare a rear defensive line and on 23 September work on the new (Hindenburg Position) was ordered to begin. On 21 September, after the battle of Flers–Courcelette (15–22 September), Hindenburg ordered that the Somme front was to have priority in the west for troops and supplies and by the end of the Battle of Morval Rupprecht had no reserves left on the Somme front. During September, the Germans had sent another thirteen fresh divisions to the British sector and scraped up troops wherever they could be found. The German artillery had fired of field artillery shells and of heavy artillery ammunition, yet the début of the tank, the defeat at Thiepval and the suffered by the armies on the Somme in September, had been severe blows to German morale. On 7 October, Rupprecht forecast a British attack north of the Ancre River in mid-October. Anxieties about the situation at Verdun also increased and on 19 October, the despatch of reinforcements from Verdun to the Somme was suspended. Defeats inflicted by the French Tenth Army led to the sacking of the 2nd Army Chief of Staff, Bronsart von Schellendorf.

==Prelude==

===British preparations===
The front-line of the Reserve Army had not moved far since the beginning of the battle, except in the south, near the Albert–Bapaume road; the ground behind the front-line was far less damaged than that behind the Fourth Army. When supply routes to the Fourth Army were washed out by rain in October, movement remained relatively easy in much of the Reserve Army area. Gough began to concentrate more troops north of the Ancre, for the attack intended for 12 October. In early October the north bank had been held by the 39th Division of V Corps, up to the boundary with the Third Army at Hébuterne. On 1 October the 2nd Division was moved in on the left of the 39th Division, to hold the ground from Redan Ridge to the army boundary. On 4 October the XIII Corps headquarters was brought out of reserve, to control of the front line, up to the junction with the Third Army and the left flank of the 2nd Division was relieved by the 51st Division. The 39th Division was transferred to II Corps on 2 October and then took over the area immediately south of the Ancre on 5 October, by extending its right flank to relieve the 18th Division at Thiepval.

By 7 October, XIII Corps had the 51st and 19th Divisions in line and on 8 October, V Corps relieved the 2nd Division with the 3rd and 63rd divisions. Gough issued instructions for the attack on the north bank from and arranged for the 1st Cavalry Division and the 3rd Cavalry Division to move closer to the front line. The artillery of V Corps and XIII Corps steadily bombarded the German defences on the south bank, where II Corps operations against (Regina Trench to the Canadians and Stuff Trench to the British) continued and simulated an offensive on the north bank with artillery bombardments, wire-cutting and smoke screens. Patrols and raids were carried out on the north bank, although mud and thick fog made it hard to keep direction. On 31 October, a patrol got into the German front-line near Hébuterne and found no Germans within . On the night of 2 November, two V Corps patrols reached the German second line near Serre and a raid by the 31st Division of XIII Corps on 7 November, took four prisoners.

The 1st Cavalry Division, twelve batteries of siege artillery and three divisional artilleries from the Third Army was transferred to the Reserve Army and all in France were brought to Acheux. The constant postponements of the offensive gave tank commanders time to study the ground but the deterioration of the surface made tank operations unlikely. Tunnelling began in October between Beaumont-Hamel and Serre, to repair Russian saps (shallow trenches dug as tunnels, whose surfaces could be broken through, by crouching soldiers standing up) and to plant a mine at Hawthorn Ridge, under the crater made by the mine blown on 1 July. In the II Corps area south of the Ancre, the 25th Division had observation on its eastern flank over the Ancre valley around Grandcourt but the Germans had held on to the crest, from the northern face of Stuff Redoubt () to the west end of the ridge. Preparations began for the capture of the rest of the redoubt and the higher ground just beyond, to gain observation over the rest of the Ancre valley. Assembly areas were prepared in Wood Post on the Authuille road and Blighty Valley and new communication trenches and deep dug-outs were built, before wet weather forced a postponement of the attack.

===British plan===

Operations north of the Ancre waited on the completion of the capture of the ridge north of Courcelette and Thiepval, by the Canadian Corps and II Corps. The remainder of Stuff and redoubts were to be captured and the front line was to be advanced to Regina Trench/Stuff Trench () on the reverse slope of the ridge, the attack being set for 1 October. On 5 October Gough issued a &quot;Memorandum on Attacks&quot; which summarized the lessons of the battle. Gough pointed out that maintaining the momentum of an attack required succeeding waves and reserves not be kept waiting for opportunities to intervene in the battle, because communication delays left them with no time to act. Brigadiers should reorganize the troops holding successive objectives, since these troops became reserves once the advance had moved on.

Brigadiers should move with the advance and divisional commanders should create reserves by reorganizing their brigades. Headquarters should be placed where attacks could be seen, to keep in touch with events when communications broke down, a chronic problem which was increased by distance from the front line. Telephone links in the rear were far easier to maintain but became less important once the infantry battle began. Corps headquarters also had the benefit of air observation and less need of direct communication with troops on the battlefield, since their main role was counter-battery artillery-fire, which was independent of the infantry battle. The attack was to be maintained by the use of reserves moving towards objectives laid down before the attack, so as to make them independent of messages from the front line, which were often delayed and out of date if they arrived.

===German preparations===
In the first fortnight of October, the six German divisions from Le Transloy to the Ancre were replaced by seven divisions, two of which were quickly relieved in turn. By 20 October, the changes ordered by the new supreme command had begun to take effect. On the Somme front, heavy batteries arrived for the 1st Army and the 2nd Army and batteries were replaced. Systematic relief of tired divisions could be attempted, aircraft reinforcements were used to increase the amount of air observation for counter-battery fire, even more ammunition being fired in October than in September, which improved German infantry morale and slowed the advance of the Franco-British armies. Some of the changes were delayed in effect because of the French offensive at Verdun 24 October, which led to the suspension of transfers of troops to the Somme.

The relief of divisions opposite the British was achieved between 24 October and 10 November, by using more divisions from the 6th and 4th armies. After the British capture of Regina/Stuff Trench of 21 October, an evacuation of the salient from St Pierre Divion to Beaumont Hamel was proposed by Rupprecht but not implemented, because of objections by Below that the high ground still held gave valuable observation, which would be lost and that the remaining defences were strong and well-placed. The German troops north of the Ancre were reinforced, despite a suggestion from Loßberg the 1st Army Chief of Staff, to withdraw to the east of Lesbœufs. An attack was not expected east of Grandcourt on the south side of the river and the success of a 2nd Army counter-attack against the French Sixth Army at La Maisonnette on 29 October, increased German optimism that the battle of the Somme was almost over.

In late September, the Marine Infantry Brigade, which had an infantry strength equivalent to an army division and was composed of well trained and rested troops of excellent quality, was moved from the Belgian coast. On 30 September, the brigade relieved the 8th Division on the Ancre Heights in (Stuff/Regina Trench), south of Grandcourt and Miraumont. had been dug as a supply route to (Stuff Redoubt) and was on the reverse slope, which proved a considerable advantage against an attack from the south. Reserves could be sheltered nearby at (Boom Ravine), which was difficult for British artillery to bombard from the south because of the obstruction of the ridge. In the long periods of poor visibility, artillery observation aircraft were grounded, which made British bombardments even more inaccurate but the Marine Brigade still had a stream of casualties caused by shellfire. Nightly supply deliveries and frequent relief enabled the Marines to hold their positions.

==Battle==

===Reserve/Fifth Army===
====1–7 October====
On 1 October the 2nd Canadian Division attacked Regina Trench with two brigades at either side of the Courcelette–Miraumont road, despite many British shells falling short onto their jumping-off line. On the extreme right, the 4th Canadian Brigade dug in forward and connected on the right with the 23rd Division north of Destremont Farm. Three 5th Canadian Brigade battalions attacked on a front west of the road and the right hand battalion was caught by artillery and machine-gun fire, halfway to Regina Trench. Hardly any troops reached the objective, where the wire was found to be uncut and the Canadian parties were forced to retreat. The centre battalion reached Kenora Trench but was not able to advance towards Regina Trench beyond, due to German machine-gun fire. The left battalion advanced at first, until the 3rd Canadian Division battalion of the 8th Canadian Brigade to its left was driven back by a German counter-attack, German bombers making their way down Regina Trench. By nightfall, the 5th Canadian Brigade held most of Kenora Trench, with outposts in the western of the two Courcelette–Miraumont roads and Courcelette Trench running north parallel to the eastern Courcelette–Miraumont road, before being relieved by the 6th Brigade before dawn.

On the left, a brigade of the 3rd Canadian Division was stopped by German artillery, uncut wire and machine-gun fire short of Regina Trench, where it conducted a bombing fight, before withdrawing at a resumption of the attack was delayed by bad weather until 8 October. In the II Corps area west of the Canadian Corps, the 25th Division relieved the 11th Division on 1 October and began consolidation of the new front line in rain and mud, while waiting for an improvement in the weather to attack the rest of Stuff Redoubt. A brigade of the 18th Division continued the fight for Redoubt on 2 October, when the Germans began a big counter-attack at from the east end of the redoubt to the old front line south of St. Pierre Divion. After fighting all day, the Germans gained a small amount of ground. At next morning, a British battalion attempted to bomb their way into Redoubt from two directions but bogged in deep mud. The 18th Division was relieved by the 39th Division on 7 October, which was then attacked in the British part of Redoubt by German troops and a flame thrower detachment, which was repulsed by two battalions of 117th Brigade. The Canadians connected their advanced posts along a line about from Regina Trench and began to send scouting parties forward each day, who reported that as the wire in front of the trench was being cut, the Germans put out &quot;concertina&quot; wire to fill the gaps.

====8 October====
The 1st Canadian Division attacked on 8 October at in cold rain. The 1st Brigade on the right with two battalions took the front trench of the Le Sars line from Dyke Road to beyond the Quadrilateral and repulsed a counter-attack with artillery-fire. As the Canadians reorganized before resuming the attack on the Quadrilateral, a heavy German bombardment fell in the area and a counter-attack began from two directions. After hours of costly fighting the Canadians withdrew to their jumping-off trenches, when they ran out of bombs having had out of and taken . After night fell a trench was dug on the right to link with the 23rd Division. The right-hand battalion of the 3rd Brigade was delayed by uncut wire but forced its way through and took part of Regina Trench on its right flank. The left-hand battalion was stopped in front of the trench with many casualties and the brigade withdrew at nightfall. A few troops of the right-flank battalion of the 9th Brigade of the 3rd Canadian Division got into Regina Trench through some German sally ports but were overwhelmed. The left-hand battalion had reached Regina Trench, where it joined Courcelette Trench and been forced back by the defenders. Part of the 7th Brigade reached Regina Trench and began to bomb westwards and also worked its way up West Miraumont Road but was eventually forced back by German counter-attacks. The left hand battalion was obstructed by new German barbed wire covered by machine-guns and was not able to advance up Kenora Trench. Relief of the Canadian Corps began on 10 October.

====9–20 October====
In an operation by II Corps on 9 October, a battalion of the 39th Division attempted a surprise attack on the northern face of Redoubt at but the German defenders were ready for them. Only on the right flank, did British troops reached the trench but were then forced out by a German counter-attack. At a battalion of the 25th Division attacked Stuff Redoubt, with the support of an &quot;intense&quot; barrage and by captured the objective and pushed advanced posts forward to the north-east, although the high ground to the north could not be captured. Two counter-attacks in the evening were defeated by artillery and machine-gun fire. The 7th Brigade of the 25th Division began to prepare another attack on 10 October to take &quot;The Mounds&quot; not captured the day before. Next day, German counter-attacks were made at Stuff Redoubt against the 25th Division and continued on 12 October, including two supported by a flame-thrower detachment, which were repulsed. 13 October was quiet and on 14 October the 25th Division attacked &quot;The Mounds&quot;, with the 7th Brigade. Six minutes before the attack began at , a German barrage began on the British line but the attackers advanced to the objective behind a dense creeping barrage.

Prisoners later said that the assembly for the attack had been seen but that the officer in command had ordered the German artillery to cease-fire just as the British attack began. Possession of The Mounds gave observation over Grandcourt and observation posts were pushed forward over the ridge. Work began on the extension of communication trenches soon after the attack, to be ready for another advance planned for 19 October. The 39th Division attacked Redoubt at with two battalions of the 118th Brigade and one from the 117th Brigade in support and captured the remaining German positions in the redoubt, in fighting which went on until , as a third 118th Brigade battalion pushed forward on the left. Next day the Germans counter-attacked the redoubt three times, two of the attacks using flame-throwers. On 16 October the 116th Brigade moved from the north bank of the Ancre and took over the redoubt, which was shelled all through 17 October. An attack by II Corps intended for 19 October was postponed because of heavy rain.

====21 October====
On 21 October a German attack at occupied parts of Redoubt, before being forced out by bombing attacks from two battalions of the 39th Division. The British attack delayed from 19 October began with the 4th Canadian Division on the right and the 18th, 25th and 39th divisions in line to the left, on a front. The fire of guns and howitzers and the field artilleries of seven divisions were found to have severely damaged Stuff/Regina Trench and cut most of the wire. The 4th Canadian Division attacked Regina Trench (the east end of ) at with the 11th Brigade, supported by an overhead machine-gun barrage and took Regina Trench. East of the Courcelette–Pys road a defensive flank was formed, with outposts pushed forward from Regina Trench and the left-hand battalion linked with troops from the 18th Division. Three German counter-attacks were defeated during the afternoon. Two battalions from the 53rd Brigade of the 18th Division attacked and reached their objectives in Stuff Trench despite a delay at the Courcelette–Grandcourt road, where troops from the 25th Division joined in a bombing fight against a unit. As the objective was being consolidated, twelve Germans arrived unaware that had been occupied and were taken prisoner.

The 25th Division attacked with three battalions of the 74th Brigade on the right and with three battalions and an attached company of the 75th Brigade on the left. Standing artillery barrages were placed on all known German trenches, strongpoints and machine-gun nests and the creeping barrage was fired by three divisional artilleries. The advance began at in three waves and reached Stuff Trench () where the German defenders inflicted many casualties on the 74th Brigade, before being overwhelmed. Some of the attackers advanced too far and the 75th Brigade on the left reached Stuff Trench with no troops on their right. At a contact aircraft reported a gap of between the brigades, which was closed by bombing parties and the Stokes mortar battery of the 75th Brigade attacking eastwards. The attack had taken thirty minutes and the advance was stopped by the British protective barrage. At Stump Road a short bombing fight took place to capture German dugouts along the road, and three field guns being captured. Touch was gained with the neighbouring divisions by and a communication trench was dug just after dark. Later in the day the 116th Brigade of the 39th Division attacked and captured Stuff Trench () while troops from the 117th Brigade attacked Pope&#x27;s Nose and gained some ground. Observation beyond the objective was found to be unsatisfactory because of the convex slope.

====22 October – 11 November====

During the night of 22 October, the 19th Division relieved the 25th Division and part of the 39th Division sector and the 18th Division moved its left boundary to the Pozières–Miraumont road. Prisoners were still being found and by the end of the day been taken. Next day, a battalion of the 4th Canadian Division tried to advance along Regina Trench towards Farmer Road but they were stopped by flanking machine-gun fire and a German artillery bombardment. On 26 October, the 19th Division drove off a German attack on Stuff Redoubt at . On 28 October the Special Brigade R. E. fired &quot;SK&quot; (lacrymatory) 4-inch Stokes mortar bombs into Beaumont Hamel, phosgene bombs into the village and Y Ravine nearby and thirty White Star (50 percent chlorine: 50 percent phosgene) mortar bombs into Serre.

Vigorous raiding and patrolling began on the north bank of the Ancre. On 29 October the 39th Division took more ground at Pope&#x27;s Nose, before bad weather stopped operations in II Corps on the south bank, until the night of 10/11 November. A patrol from troops of XIII Corps on the north bank entered the German front-line near Hébuterne on 31 October and found it empty and a raid by the 30th Division killed on 7 November. Mud prevented movement on 9 and 10 November and in II Corps another gas bombardment on Beaumont Hamel took place on 11 November. bombs were fired from 4-inch Stokes mortars at and at drums were fired into the village and fired at Y Ravine. At midnight two 10th Brigade battalions and a company from an 11th Brigade battalion of the 4th Canadian Division, attacked the east end of Regina Trench and established advanced posts to the north-east, close to the German positions of the Le Sars–Pys line, before defeating several counter-attacks. The Battle of the Ancre began on 13 November with more attacks by II Corps on the south bank, combined with attacks from V Corps and XIII Corps on the north bank.

===Air operations===

In October the Germans concentrated more than on the Somme front, including the new Albatros D.II and Albatros D.III, which were superior to the best British and French machines. The deployment of two of the new (fighter wings), challenged the air superiority of the Anglo-French air services. On 5 October a dogfight of over north of Bapaume was watched by German troops until the British aircraft withdrew. The troops who had spent periods on the Somme front earlier in the battle, were much encouraged by the sight of German aircraft challenging Allied aircraft, which continued during the infrequent periods of good flying weather in October. British reinforcements also reached the Somme front between August and October, three being new squadrons from England and five from the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) brigades further north, being replaced by four more new squadrons from England. The two squadrons of obsolete Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.12s were withdrawn from fighter operations and many squadrons on the Somme were tired and understrength.

Pressure was put on the Admiralty to send Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) aircraft down from Dunkirk and Naval Squadron No. 8 (Naval 8) arrived at Vert Galand on 26 October. In the morning of 1 October two III Brigade squadrons attacked the railway station at Miraumont with bombs, which caused fires to burn all afternoon and aircraft from 19 Squadron attacked German billets at Havrincourt. During the Canadian attack that afternoon, British artillery observation aircraft sent calls to the artillery to fire on German artillery batteries and sent by balloon observers. Rain fell all next day, grounding British aircraft; a formation of German aircraft surprised the British by appearing over the front-line, where one was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. Very little air activity took place until 10 October when the rain abated. Aircraft from both sides flew many sorties and several British aircraft were shot down, all by &quot;Jasta 2&quot; (Boelcke). An offensive patrol attacked seven German aircraft over Vélu and drove them off, despite the superior speed and manoeuvrability of the German aircraft, one aircraft from each side being shot down, along with three more from each side lost near Morval and Pozierès. British aircraft attacked Douai aerodrome and the railway stations at Cambrai, Marcoing and Vitry overnight.

More bad weather restricted flying until 16 October, when British and German bombers began operations before dawn. Cambrai was bombed again and the Germans attacked the aerodrome of 9 Squadron, wounding two ground crew, destroying one aircraft and damaging another. In the afternoon the British attacked Havrincourt, the station and aerodrome at Hermies and then Ruyaulcourt, two British aircraft being shot down. British corps aircraft were frequently attacked by German fighters, one being shot down and another damaged and four German and one British aircraft were shot down, in fights with British offensive patrols. The better weather continued on 17 October and a supply dump was blown up at Bapaume station. A reconnaissance by Third Army aircraft at the north end of the Somme front, met twenty German fighters and two aircraft were shot down by each side. A British aircraft was driven down by German fighters and two German aircraft were forced down by 24 Squadron near Vélu; rain and sleet then stopped flying for two days.

On 20 October, aircraft of 11 Squadron on photographic reconnaissance near Douai, were attacked by , which shot down two aircraft and damaged two more. Nine aircraft of 27 Squadron made a long-range attack on Aulnoye junction near Maubeuge, for no loss and 70 Squadron aircraft which photographed Valenciennes and Le Quesnoy returned. Thirty-three German aircraft crossed the British front line and made many attacks on British aircraft; three German aircraft were shot down and seventeen claimed damaged. German night bombers attacked Querrieu, Corbie and Longueau, where an ammunition waggon was blown up; British aircraft attacked Vélu and Péronne. After the German morning attack on (Schwaben Redoubt) on 21 October, the British attack planned for the afternoon followed up the German repulse, with the assistance of contact patrols from two squadrons, which in good visibility directed artillery-fire and destroyed ten gun-pits, damaged fourteen and blew up seven ammunition pits. Zone calls from British aircraft silenced many German guns, including nine German batteries firing on the Canadian troops attacking Regina Trench. Long-range bombers attacked an ammunition dump at Ath (near Mons) which had been reported by a French spy. An aircraft bombed from and set fire to the dump, before the formation returned safely. Quéant station was bombed by thirty more aircraft and escorts, which were intercepted over the target and one bomber shot down. An escort pilot flying a Nieuport 17 turned back, after the bombers reached British lines but was then forced down in a dogfight with a faster German aircraft. On other parts of the Somme front two German aircraft were shot down, three damaged and ten driven down.

On 22 October there were many sorties by German flyers. Six aircraft attacked a Sopwith 1½ Strutter of 45 Squadron and wounded the observer, who shot one down. Later in the day, three 45 Squadron aircraft were shot down and an F.E.2b shot down one aircraft and damaged another, before the observer was mortally wounded; four British aircraft were shot down beyond German lines. During 23 October two Reserve Army artillery observation aeroplanes were shot down by . On 26 October, despite poor weather both sides flew many sorties; a fight between five Airco DH.2&#x27;s of 24 Squadron and twenty Halberstadt D.II&#x27;s was indecisive but later in the day a formation of eight aircraft led by Boelcke, shot down one British observation aircraft, forced down two more and a British fighter which intervened. One German fighter was then shot down when a formation of British fighters from 32 Squadron turned up. Boelcke was killed on 28 October, when he collided with a German aircraft during an attack on two British fighters, which returned safely. For the rest of the battle of the Somme, both sides flew in rain, mist, sleet and westerly gales, often at dangerously low heights, to direct artillery and attack troops with guns and bombs.

3 November was a clear day and German aircraft shot down five British aircraft. On the night of 6 November German night bombers hit an ammunition train near Cerisy, which exploded next to a cage for German prisoners of war and devastated the area. Better weather came on 8 November and many German aircraft made ground attacks on British troops, a tactic which the began to incorporate systematically into its defensive operations. The British attempted to divert German attention next day, with bombing raids on Arleux and Vraucourt. The raid on Vraucourt by twelve bombers and fourteen escorts became the biggest air fight of the war, when approximately thirty German aircraft attacked the formation as it crossed the front lines. Most of the bombs were dropped over the target but six British aircraft were shot down and three German aircraft were claimed. Three more British aircraft were shot down later in the day; one pilot was killed, one wounded and an observer were wounded in aircraft which returned. The railway station at Vitry and German airfields at Buissy, Vélu and Villers were attacked after dark, while German night bombers attacked the airfield at Lavieville.

The British attacked Valenciennes aerodrome next morning, where five parked aircraft, hangars and sheds were bombed. Next day, German air operations were less extensive; three aircraft were shot down and three damaged for the loss of one British aeroplane. Naval 8 drove down two German aircraft on 10 November and overnight 18 Squadron retaliated for the attack on their airfield at Lavieville by bombing Valenciennes, Vélu, transport on the Bapaume road, balloon sheds, a train near St. Léger and a second train which was set on fire; a German headquarters at Havrincourt Château and Douai aerodrome were also attacked. German bombers attacked Amiens station and returned on the night of 10/11 November, when one aircraft was forced down with engine-trouble and the crew captured. On 11 November, operations began for the Battle of the Ancre, the last British attack of the Battle of the Somme, before the offensive was stopped for the winter.

===German 1st Army===
On 30 September the Marine Brigade moved up through (Boom Ravine) and relieved the 8th Division on the right of the 4th Division, in (Stuff/Regina Trench), which they found to have disappeared due to the effect of the British artillery bombardments. On 1 October, the British artillery bombardment increased in intensity to &quot;drumfire&quot;, while the German artillery stayed silent because of a shortage of ammunition, being limited to firing only when the British infantry attack began. British aircraft flew overhead at observing for the artillery, strafing the ground when they saw movement and throwing hand-grenades. At about the British artillery lifted towards and Miraumont. The German defenders of the 8th Division saw waves of Canadian infantry advancing, while the division was being relieved by the Marine Brigade and fired rockets to alert the German artillery, which opened fire immediately. Numerous counter-attacks by battalions of the 1st and 2nd Marine Regiments eventually forced the Canadians to withdraw, before attempting to attack again by dribbling forward from shell-hole to shell-hole. The Canadian attacks ceased at nightfall, having been costly to both sides. On 2 October, parts of the 66th and 170th regiments of the 52nd Division, attached to the 26th Reserve Division, attacked at the east end of ( Redoubt) and the German lines further east and gained a small amount of ground. On 7 October the 110th Reserve Regiment of the 28th Reserve Division, which was relieving the 26th Reserve Division, began attacks on assisted by detachments, which continued on 8 October.

Another British attack on 7 October, captured parts of before the 2nd Marine Regiment and part of the 1st Marine Regiment repulsed the attack, with many casualties on both sides. fell on 9 October and counter-attacks by the 111th Reserve Regiment from were defeated. A British attempt at a surprise attack on was repulsed and the last part of the was lost on 14 October, which left the 28th Reserve Division positions in the Ancre valley, under British ground observation and the ground around St. Pierre Divion and Beaumont Hamel in a salient. A hasty counter-attack collapsed into chaos on the night of 14/15 October, despite the participation of stormtrooper () and detachments. A company refused to attack for fear of being hit by German artillery and when a second attack was ordered another company refused to attack. On 21 October was lost except for the east end of the trench and the 5th Division, which had relieved the Marine Brigade on was pushed back for . By 22 October, the British had captured from the 28th Reserve and 5th divisions, which were relieved in turn by the 38th Division and the 58th Division, which counter-attacked and the lines to the east on 26 October. The attack failed with many casualties in the 107th Regiment of the 58th Division and the 2nd Guard Reserve Regiment of the 1st Guard Reserve Division further east. Divisions which had already fought on the Somme and were being sent for a second time, found that their fighting power had been seriously eroded.

===French operations===

The French Sixth Army operations to outflank Péronne from the north continued in October and the Fourth Army co-operated with the Sixth Army in the Battle of Le Transloy Waterlogged ground of the Somme valley obstructed progress further south but XXXIII Corps, that operated on both sides of the Somme, attacked on the south bank on 18 October, to counter German mining and improve the line from La Maisonnette to Biaches, although a German counter-attack on 21 October regained some ground. On 29 October, the XXXIII Corps was pushed out of La Maisonnette, at the end of the salient south-east of Biaches. A French attempt to retake the village was delayed and eventually cancelled. The Tenth Army attacked from 10 to 21 October and captured woods near Chaulnes. The line was advanced towards Ablaincourt, Pressoir and Fresnes on a front from Chaulnes to to the north-east. More attacks by the Tenth Army were delayed by bad weather until 7 November, when Bois Kratz, Ablaincourt-Pressoir were captured; numerous German counter-attacks, including a big attack at Bois Kratz and Pressoir on 15 November were defeated; preparations were begun by the French to advance to a line from Mazancourt, to Happlincourt and Biaches, ready for a spring offensive.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===

The loss of Thiepval had been a huge blow to German morale but the loss of and redoubts, was considered by some German officers to be worse. Rather than order a withdrawal from these exposed positions, Rupprecht and Ludendorff accepted Below&#x27;s argument that there were no better positions to withdraw to and supported his attempt to recapture the redoubts, which only added to German losses. Reports made after the battle by units of the Canadian Corps, stressed that battalion command was impossible once an attack began, companies and platoons needed to be given objectives before the attack and discretion on how to reach them. The attacking troops should have in the line to study the ground, followed by in reserve to receive a detailed briefing. The equipment to be carried was discussed and it was suggested that the first wave should not carry tools but a light load of of ammunition, two hand grenades, two days&#x27; rations and a ground sheet. (Some units pointed out that most of the tools carried by the leading troops were thrown away anyway.) The importance of carrying enough hand grenades was stressed, since uncut wire forced the attackers into German communication trenches, where many more were used to fight forward, which used up the stock intended for repelling counter-attacks, compared to an advance on the surface.

Where barbed wire was cut, the infantry could move above ground, bypassing isolated German defences and leaving them for mopping-up parties. The value of Lewis guns and plenty of ammunition was emphasised in many reports, as was the importance of moving them forward quickly in an attack, to support the infantry and then be ready to engage German infantry counter-attacks. By the end of the battle of the Somme, each platoon had a Lewis gun, giving battalion. Opinion divided over the Stokes mortar because of its rate of fire, each bomb weighed about , which meant that it was impractical to carry many forward in an attack. The mortar was most useful in static positions at the rear, until supply routes had been built to the new front line. Tanks were judged to have serious limitations in mechanical reliability, mobility and armour protection but were considered a useful accessory to infantry operations, having overcome German strong points and diverted German artillery-fire from the infantry. It was found that tank-infantry co-ordination had been impossible, since tanks and infantry moved at different speeds but that when infantry led an attack, tanks could mop-up behind them and when tanks led, they could destroy German defences before the infantry arrived.

Tactics were considered and a new platoon organization was proposed by Major-General R. B. Stephens of the 5th Division, in which there would be four specialist sections, equipped with rifles, rifle-grenades, bombs and a Lewis gun. Advancing by flanking manoeuvres was favoured, to exploit the German defensive change from trench lines to strongpoints, after they had been forced out of their front-line defences on the Somme. Infantry could follow a creeping barrage to within of German defences, crawl another and then rush the Germans, before they could emerge from their shelters. It was recommended that infantry waves be equipped for different tasks, with the first wave comprising about half of the attacking force, carrying rifles, bombs and Lewis guns, the Lewis gunners and bombers moving beyond the objective to form advanced posts and the second wave carrying tools and trench stores for consolidation. Opinion about the allocation of objectives varied, with some reports favouring the first wave moving on from the first objective and others advocating that following waves leap-frog through the wave ahead, while that wave consolidated and recovered from the stress and exertion of the advance.

Details of infantry formation within lines and waves (groups of lines) was discussed, with dispersal advocated to present smaller targets to German machine-gunners and artillery and concentration emphasised, to keep troops close enough together to be able to overwhelm German defences. An attack on 1 October, with three waves of infantry standing apart, advancing against Regina Trench which turned out to be undamaged, was called &quot;suicidal&quot;. If infantry waves passed beyond initial objectives, the ground would need to be searched and garrisoned, to prevent German troops firing on them from behind. It was recommended that mopping-up parties should form the attacking force and be ready to act as local reinforcements, should the attack bog down. Some units wanted a third wave of attackers, who could prepare captured ground for defence without delay.

Regaining contact with field artillery after the attack was considered essential, so that German counter-attacks could be engaged with shrapnel fire, to obstruct German troops as they concentrated for attack and to create a barrier against the survivors. Advanced posts pushed beyond the objective gave early warning of German attacks and forced then under cover, outside grenade-throwing range; the advanced posts could also be connected later. Communication was essential, all reports stressed the efficiency of telephones and some units advocated dispensing with visual communication, since the smoke and dust of battle made them invisible. Runners were the second most reliable means of maintaining contact between advanced troops, battalion and brigade headquarters. The Canadian Corps decided to use telephones, runners, pigeons and visual signals, given the unpredictable characteristics of the battlefield. Aeroplanes on contact-patrol had been found to be ineffective and more training of the infantry in contact-patrol liaison was recommended.

===Casualties===

The 2nd Canadian Division suffered casualties October. Casualties suffered by the 3rd Canadian Division October were The 18th Division incurred casualties October. Canadian Corps casualties on 8 October were . When the Canadian Corps was relieved, its casualties during the Battle of the Somme were , roughly of the forces involved. The Marine Brigade suffered in one regiment and up to 41 per cent of the other two until it was relieved by the 5th &quot;Ersatz&quot; Division on the night of 11/12 October. 

===Victoria Cross===
James Richardson of the 16th Battalion (Canadian Scottish), 3rd Brigade, 1st Canadian Division was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his actions on 8 October 1916.

<doc id="1310376" wikidata="Q965799" url="?curid=1310376" title="Chemical toilet">
<text>A chemical toilet collects human waste in a holding tank and uses chemicals to minimize odors. They do not require a connection to a water supply and are used in a wide variety of situations. These toilets are usually, but not always, self-contained and movable. A chemical toilet is structured around a relatively small tank, which requires frequent emptying. It is not connected to a hole in the ground (like a pit latrine), nor to a septic tank, nor is it plumbed into a municipal system leading to a sewage treatment plant. When the tank is emptied, the contents are usually pumped into a sanitary sewer or directly to a treatment plant.

The enclosed portable toilets used on construction sites and at large gatherings such as music festivals are well-known types of chemical toilets. As they are usually used for short periods and because of their high prices, they are mostly rented rather than bought, often including servicing and cleaning.

A simpler, unenclosed, chemical toilet may be used in camping, travel trailers (caravans) and on small boats.

Many chemical toilets use a blue dye in the bowl water. In the past, disinfection was generally carried out by mixing formaldehyde, bleach, or similar chemicals with the toilet water when flushed. Modern formulations are nitrate-based and work biologically.

==Names==
Chemical toilets are a type of portable toilet and are also known by various tradenames, such as Port-a-John and Porta-Potty (American English), Portaloo (British English), honey bucket, or sanican. The last two are the names of companies and &quot;Portaloo&quot; is a British and European Community registered trade mark.

==Designs==

Enclosed chemical toilets are often used as a temporary solution, for example on construction sites or large gatherings, because of their durability and convenience. Most chemical toilets have black open-front U-shaped toilet seats with a cover. They are often constructed out of lightweight molded plastic or fiberglass. Most include lockable doors.

While chemical toilet units are typically freestanding structures, their stability is augmented by the weight of the waste tank, which usually contains an empty liquid disinfectant dispenser and deodorizer. They can also be staked down to withstand high winds.

In countries which use squat toilets, portable toilets also come in squat versions, with only the shoes touching a potentially soiled surface.
Hybrid toilet designs, where users can squat or swing down a seat to sit on, have not been developed for portable toilets.

Most include ventilation near the top, and a vent pipe for the holding tank. When wind is blowing over the vent pipe, it creates a low pressure area sucking the odor out, and leaving the toilet lid open will reverse the flow of the venting of the tank.

===Size===
Chemical toilets are large enough for a single occupant, usually about square by high.

Typical specifications:

* Total Weight: 
* Total Width: 
* Total Depth: 
* Total Height: 
* Door Height: 
* Door Width: 
A smaller version would be 1 meter square (39 inches). A version for people with disabilities would be at least by , with a door width of at least .

===Variations===

Models can include a urinal, to keep urine away from the seat, air fresheners, a translucent roof for light, a hook to keep purse, tool belt, or jacket off the floor, and antibacterial hand sanitizer dispensers or sinks with soap and paper towels. It has become common for portable toilets to be paired with a separate hand washing station. These sink stations provide a foot pump to dispense non-potable water to wash one&#x27;s hands with provided soap dispensers or hand sanitizer stations after using the toilet, along with paper towels. Some toilets have a dispenser for menstrual products and trash receptacles for menstrual and incontinence products and other trash to keep them out of the waste tank.

Government and private standards are minimal and do not require any of these features.

===Toilet trailers===
Portable toilets on trailers are known as &quot;toilet trailers&quot;. These trailers are typically found in 1–2 toilet configurations with a hand wash ability using either a hand washing station or a plastic barrel full of water. These trailers are often seen on agricultural fields or at road construction sites. These restrooms are ideal for situations where the workers (users) are very mobile. However, this configuration has proven problematic; most modern portable toilet waste tank designs have proven inadequate to deal with the common problem of splash-outs from the waste holding tank while being towed down bumpy roads. Also, when being towed, the high winds blow in from the vents, creating a hurricane effect inside and ejecting any toilet paper rolls from the portable toilet if not secured.

&quot;Luxury&quot; portable toilets also exist. They are typically mounted on large &quot;office-like&quot; trailers or made from converted shipping containers. They contain every amenity that a public toilet would have such as running water, flushing toilet, stalls, urinals, mirrors, lighting, and even air conditioning and hot water in some cases. However, these luxuries come at a price as these trailers typically cost multiple times more than a typical portable toilet to buy or rent. They are commonly found at weddings, high end events/charities, and movie shoots.

The chemical toilets used in film shoots are known as honeywagons.

===Camping toilets===
A portable camping toilet has a seat and a small waste tank. Adding a packet of chemicals to the waste tank reduces odors and bacteria, until the waste can be dumped at an appropriate facility. They are used in camping, travel trailers, caravans, and camper vans. They may also be used on small boats which lack a built-in marine toilet.

They are also referred to as &quot;cassette toilet&quot; or &quot;camping toilet&quot;, or under brand names that have become generic trademarks. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; lists &quot;Porta Potti&quot; (&quot;with arbitrary respelling&quot;) as &quot;A proprietary name for: a portable toilet, as used by campers&quot;, and gives mostly American examples from 1968. The OED gives this proprietary name a second meaning, &quot;a small prefabricated unit containing a toilet, designed for easy transportation and temporary installation esp. outdoors&quot;.

The other name common in British English is &quot;Elsan&quot;, which dates back to 1925. According to the Camping and Caravanning Club, &quot;Today you will often see campsites refer to their Disposal Points as Elsan Disposal Points because of the history and popularity of the brand.&quot; The Canal and River Trust uses both brand names, in lieu of any unbranded term.

One colloquialism for these simple toilets is the &quot;bucket and chuck it&quot; system, although in fact they no longer resemble an open bucket (see bucket toilet). These are designed to be emptied into sanitary stations connected to the regular sewage system. These toilets are not to be confused with the types that are plumbed in to the vehicle and need to be pumped out at holding tank dump stations.

==Chemicals==
Portable chemical toilets typically use a mixture of several different chemicals in the holding tank.

A blue dye is added to conceal the contents of the tank from the user, as well as to provide a visual indicator of capacity. When enough urine and/or feces (yellow to brown) are deposited, the overall mixture takes on a green color which indicates that the tank is full, and should be emptied.

Fragrances and associated surfactants are usually included.

Biocides are added in an effort to control odor by suppressing microbial growth (particularly of gram-positive bacteria). Milder forms include ethanol and quaternary ammonium compounds in low concentration.

A formaldehyde based chemical was used for this purpose in the past, but environmental and health concerns have led to its phase-out in chemical toilets. Formaldehyde is very irritating to the eyes, ears, skin, nose, and throat, and in addition to vapor inhalation, the chemical solution can splash back onto the buttocks of the user when their excrement drops in. Formaldehyde is also highly toxic to aquatic life and can be difficult for wastewater treatment plants to dispose of safely.

In modern chemical toilets, microbial and enzymatic agents are increasingly common. These effectively reduce odor by accelerating digestion and breakdown of the waste, without relying on toxic additives or concealment with fragrances alone. Some can also break down toilet paper as well.

All of the above ingredients may have a limited lifespan (e.g., 7 days), requiring frequent replacement to maintain efficacy.

A much older form of portable toilet chemical is lye. Lye was used during the old &quot;wooden outhouse days&quot; to prevent odors. After a person is done using the portable toilet they would sprinkle a bit of lye into the holding tank. Lye can be dangerously corrosive to skin, and is rarely used today.

==Locations==
Enclosed chemical toilets are frequently seen at outdoor work sites, particularly construction sites, farms, ranches, and camp sites. Large banks of dozens of portable toilets allow for ready sanitation at large gatherings such as outdoor music festivals. Several portable toilets arranged in these large banks are referred to as a &#x27;sitting&#x27; of portable toilets. Portable toilet rentals, crucial for maintaining hygiene and convenience at these sites, offer various options ranging from basic models to luxury units, catering to the specific needs of different events and locations.

==Market size==
In the United States, the chemical toilet industry is a $2 billion a year business with standard models starting at $68 per day at California wildfires or $225 per day in New York City. Luxury restroom trailer units with flushing toilets cost a few thousand dollars delivered a long distance in New York state.

==Advantages==
Though more expensive than a standard permanent outdoor latrine, portable toilets have several significant benefits mostly related to their portability; as they are self-contained, they can be placed almost anywhere. Portable toilets without enclosures can be carried in cars, and toilets with enclosures can be hauled in the back of pick-up trucks. Some corporations manufacture special trucks for this purpose.

Portable toilets reduce open defecation. With their enclosure, they offer privacy on the toilet. If they lack a sink, they often also lack a trash receptacle which is needed when people use nonflushable wipes to clean the seat, and is also needed to dispose of used menstrual and incontinence products in privacy. They are hard to keep clean. Males often may choose to urinate elsewhere for personal convenience, to avoid germs, to shorten queues, to improve efficiency at night, or to prevent the toilets from filling up too quickly.

==Disadvantages==
Because portable toilets are not plumbed, they keep the waste inside the tank; this can lead to a sewage smell if the portable toilet is not cleaned properly or is overused. They may also be seen as an eyesore in most communities, some of which prohibit the use of a portable toilet without special permission from the city or municipality.

Another disadvantage is that regular portable toilets are not wheelchair accessible, meaning that disabled people that use wheelchairs may find using portable toilets difficult or impossible. However, most modern companies offer wheel chair accessible portable toilets upon request.

==Society and culture==
===Use in outdoor advertising===
Portable toilets may be used to display outdoor advertising. Some advertisers wrap portable toilets with vinyl material similar to that commonly used on cars and buses.

==History==
The first US patent for a polyethylene plastic portable toilet was issued in the 1950s to Harvey Heather, the founder of United Sanitation. This &quot;strong box&quot; was a solid, molded, stand-alone chemical toilet. The second US patent for a polyethylene plastic portable toilet was in the 1960s to George Harding, a co-founder of PolyJohn Corporation with Ed Cooper and George Hiskes.

In the mid 1960s PolyJohn was importing these toilets in to the UK under the Portaloo name and by the early 1970s they realized they needed a UK manufacturer of chemicals for their toilets. Working in partnership with Doug Holt &amp; Robert Frazer, the owners of Repclif Chemical Services Ltd now Qualkem Ltd, the Destrol brand was born. Destrol quickly became the main brand with product being sold across the globe, servicing toilets with Destrol Bio-Concentrate &amp; Destrol 6.

Its predecessors include the Victorian thunderbox, the bucket toilet and the pit latrine. The shape of the structure resembles a privy (outhouse), but there is no hole dug beneath it.

<text>Irving Penn (June 16, 1917October 7, 2009) was an American photographer known for his fashion photography, portraits, and still lifes. Penn&#x27;s career included work at &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine, and independent advertising work for clients including Issey Miyake and Clinique. His work has been exhibited internationally and continues to inform the art of photography.

==Early life and education==
Penn was born to a Russian Jewish family on June 16, 1917, in Plainfield, New Jersey, to Harry Penn and Sonia Greenberg. Penn&#x27;s younger brother, Arthur Penn, was born in 1922 and would go on to become a film director and producer. Penn attended Abraham Lincoln High School where he studied graphic design with Leon Friend.

Penn attended the Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Art (now the University of the Arts) from 1934 to 1938, where he studied drawing, painting, graphics, and industrial arts under Alexey Brodovitch. While still a student, Penn worked under Brodovitch at &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; which published several of Penn&#x27;s drawings.

== Career ==
Penn worked as a freelance designer for three years, taking his first amateur photographs before assuming Brodovitch&#x27;s position as the art director at Saks Fifth Avenue in 1940. Penn remained at Saks Fifth Avenue for a year before leaving to spend a year painting and taking photographs in Mexico and across the US. When Penn returned to New York, Alexander Liberman offered him a position as an associate in &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine&#x27;s Art Department. Penn worked on layout for the magazine before Liberman asked him to try photography.

Penn&#x27;s first photographic cover for &quot;VOGUE&quot; magazine appeared in October 1943. The art department of the Office of War Information in London offered him a job as an &quot;artist-photographer&quot; but he volunteered with the American Field Service instead. After arriving in Naples with a boatload of American troops in November 1944. Penn drove an ambulance in support of the British Eighth Army as it alternately waited out weather and slogged its way north through a miserable winter in the Italian Apennines. In July 1945, he was transferred from Italy to India. He photographed the soldiers, medical operations, and camp life for the AFS, and various subjects while bivouacked in India. He sailed back to New York in November 1945.

Penn continued to work at &quot;Vogue&quot; throughout his career, photographing covers, portraits, still lifes, fashion, and photographic essays. In the 1950s, Penn founded his own studio in New York and began making advertising photographs. Over the years, Penn&#x27;s list of clients grew to include General Foods, De Beers, Issey Miyake, and Clinique.

Penn met Swedish fashion model Lisa Fonssagrives at a photo shoot in 1947. In 1950, the two married at Chelsea Register Office, and two years later Lisa gave birth to their son, Tom Penn, who would become a metal designer. Lisa Fonssagrives died in 1992. Penn died aged 92 on October 7, 2009 at his home in Manhattan.

==Photography==
Best known for his fashion photography, Penn&#x27;s repertoire also included portraits of creative greats; ethnographic photographs from around the world; Modernist still-life works of food, bones, bottles, metal, and found objects; and photographic travel essays.

Penn was among the earliest photographers to pose subjects against grey or white backdrop and he effectively used its simplicity. During his early years at Vogue, the magazine&#x27;s art director, Penn developed a bold graphic sensibility that complemented Penn&#x27;s chic images and embodied modern taste. His use of monochromatic backdrops of black, white, or gray allowed him complete control of natural lighting conditions and enhanced the visual simplicity of his photographs. In an era when elaborate artificial lighting was the norm, his work stood out from the rest and influenced subsequent fashion photography. Expanding his austere studio surroundings, Penn constructed a set of upright angled backdrops, to form a stark, acute corner. Subjects photographed with this technique included John Hersey, Martha Graham, Marcel Duchamp, Pablo Picasso, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, W. H. Auden, and Igor Stravinsky.

Beginning in 1964, Irving Penn began experimenting with platinum printing. Penn had spent his career up to that point making photographs that were seen almost exclusively in reproduction within the glossy pages of magazines and in his pivotal 1960 book Moments Preserved. Penn set himself the challenge of producing photographic prints that would surpass the technical limitations of reprographic media and deliver a deeper visual experience. He was drawn to the antiquated platinum process for its long grayscale – its ability to display a seemingly infinite array of gradations between pure white and absolute black.

The platinum process requires direct contact with the negative, without enlargement, so Penn first needed to create flawless negatives the same size as the desired print. He then hand-coated paper with platinum emulsion. When dry, the paper was sandwiched with the negative and exposed to light before processing. Rigorous experimentation revealed that recoating a print with a secondary emulsion and making a second or third exposure of the same image on a single sheet of paper yielded prints of greater depth and subtlety. Penn solved the problem of aligning and re-aligning the negative and the print surface over multiple exposures by borrowing a technique from the graphic arts: he mounted his paper on a sheet of aluminum with a series of registration guides along the top edge. Penn was guarded about the preparation of his emulsions and his precise formulations varied considerably. He frequently introduced palladium and iron salts into his coatings to achieve desired effects.

Penn&#x27;s still life compositions are sparse and highly organized, assemblages of food or objects that articulate the abstract interplay of line and volume. Penn&#x27;s photographs are composed with a great attention to detail, which continues into his craft of developing and making prints of his photographs. Penn experimented with many printing techniques, including prints made on aluminum sheets coated with a platinum emulsion rendering the image with a warmth that untoned silver prints lacked. His black and white prints are notable for their deep contrast, giving them a clean, crisp look.

While steeped in the Modernist tradition, Penn also ventured beyond creative boundaries. The exhibition &quot;Earthly Bodies&quot; consisted of series of posed nudes whose physical shapes range from thin to plump; while the photographs were taken in 1949 and 1950, they were not exhibited until 1980.

He continued to capture collections by his favorite designers, such as John Galliano for Dior, Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel, and Christian Lacroix, for Vogue, incorporating these darker themes into his images.

<text>České Velenice (, , 1938–1945: &quot;Gmünd III&quot;) is a town in Jindřichův Hradec District in the South Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 3,700 inhabitants. It lies on the border with Austria and is adjacent to the town of Gmünd, to which it once belonged.

==Geography==
Suchdol nad Lužnicí is located about south of Jindřichův Hradec and southeast of České Budějovice, on the border with Austria. It lies in the Třeboň Basin. The highest point is the flat hill Andělský kopec at above sea level.

==History==
Until 1870, there were only small settlements of Česká Cejle, Josefsko and Dolní Velenice in the area constituting current České Velenice, and it was part of the Austrian town of Gmünd. In 1868 the main railway station and the factory for repairing rolling stock and locomotives were established. The development of this border area was decisively increased by the inauguration of the Emperor Franz Joseph Railway connecting Vienna to Prague in 1869. Due to the construction, housing estates were built and the population grew, especially of Czech nationality.

At the end of World War I, the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919) awarded the territory to Czechoslovakia. On 31 July it was officially attached to Czechoslovakia and became the new municipality, at first under the names &quot;Cmunt v Čechách&quot; and &quot;Český Cmunt&quot;, and since 1922 under the name České Velenice. Until 1938, České Velenice was a prospering municipality with an important railway junction.

During World War II, České Velenice changed to a town with 95% of population being of German nationality. On 23 March 1945, the town and the railway workshops were severely damaged by American-English air strikes. This caused a mass exodus from the town of people who lost both their homes and their employment. After the war, the depopulated town was partially inhabited by the original residents.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
The largest employer based in the town is the company Magna Cartech, a branch of Magna International. It focuses on sheet metal pressing and welding for automotive industry.

==Transport==

České Velenice railway station is located of the international line Prague–Vienna and is the terminus of the line from České Budějovice. The town shares the railway and pedestrian border crossing with Gmünd in Austria.

==Education==
České Velenice is home to one secondary school and one primary school. The secondary school mainly focuses on business, transport and mechanics.

==Sights==
České Velenice is poor in monuments. The only protected monument is the Church of Saint Agnes of Bohemia. It was built in 1935. Around the church is an English-style park.

==Notable people==
*Adolf Born (1930–2016), painter, cartoonist and illustrator

<text>Kaki King (born Katherine Elizabeth King, August 24, 1979) is an American guitarist and composer. King is known for her percussive and jazz-tinged melodies, energetic live shows, use of multiple tunings on acoustic and lap steel guitar, and her diverse range in different genres.

In February 2006, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; released a list of &quot;The New Guitar Gods&quot;, on which King was the sole woman and youngest artist (beating Derek Trucks in age by two months as the youngest on the list). Her career includes six LP and two EP albums, as well as several scores for television and film. She worked alongside Eddie Vedder and Michael Brook contributing music for the soundtrack to Sean Penn&#x27;s &quot;Into the Wild&quot;, for which the trio received nominations for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score.

==Childhood and early life==
King was born the first of two daughters. While still a small child, her father noticed her natural musical ability, and encouraged her interest in music. She was introduced to the guitar at the age of four and played for several years, but after taking up the drums a few years later, they became her primary instruments as an adolescent.

Convinced that her break in music would come from drumming, King played in bands in high school with classmate Morgan Jahnig, who would later become the bassist of Old Crow Medicine Show. On graduating from The Westminster Schools in Atlanta in 1998, the two friends attended New York University. While there, King picked up the guitar again, and revisited the finger-style techniques that intrigued her as a child. While at NYU she studied with Bill Rayner, a professor of guitar. From there, King played a few occasional gigs and busked in the New York City Subway.

==Career==
===Early career===

After signing with Velour Records in 2002, King began recording her debut album, &quot;Everybody Loves You.&quot; She incorporated fingerstyle &quot;fanning,&quot; with both flamenco style percussion and fret tapping techniques, as well as using double open tunings, viola tunings, and traditional Russian guitar (7 strings). On April 22, 2003, &quot;Everybody Loves You&quot; was released to positive reviews and feedback on King&#x27;s skills as a guitarist in relation to her age. While her later work involves more of a band format, &quot;Everybody Loves You&quot; is King&#x27;s only fully acoustic guitar album, with the exception of light singing on the hidden bonus track, &quot;The Government.&quot; To support the album, King embarked on her first major promotional tour in North America.

After King appeared on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, Sony Records offered her a deal with Epic records&#x27; Red Ink label. From there, King headed back into the studio to work on her sophomore effort, &quot;Legs to Make Us Longer&quot;. King began to incorporate different instruments and sound effects into her album, such as looping, light drum work on &quot;Doing the Wrong Thing&quot;, and her first incorporation of Lap steel guitar with &quot;My Insect Life.&quot; Produced by David Torn, &quot;Legs to Make Us Longer&quot; was released on Epic&#x27;s Red Ink Imprint on October 5, 2004 to strong reviews. In support of the album, King performed as an opening act for Eric Johnson during a leg of his 2005 tour, as well as completing her own nationwide and world tour.

===Change in musical style and sound===

At the end of her tour for &quot;Legs to Make Us Longer&quot; in 2005, King departed from her previous musical direction out of a desire to escape being pigeonholed as a solo instrumental artist. She amicably parted ways with major label Sony/Epic and returned to her original label, Velour, to begin work on her third album &quot;...Until We Felt Red&quot;. Released August 8, 2006, on Velour Records, the album features production work by Tortoise&#x27;s John McEntire. With the prominence of electric guitar shoegazing and effect boxes on the new record, and the addition of a full band, the music website, The A.V. Club, called the sound a &quot;post-rock makeover.&quot; She supported the album by going on tour with Sarah Bettens from K&#x27;s Choice.
In early 2007, Dave Grohl invited King to appear as a guitarist on the track &quot;Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners&quot;, a song penned by Grohl for an upcoming studio album by the Foo Fighters. King agreed and is credited on the album, entitled &quot;Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace&quot;, released on September 25, 2007. On November 18, 2007, she joined Dave Grohl on stage to perform the track at the O2 arena in London. Grohl highly praised King&#x27;s performance:

King toured with the Foo Fighters on the Australian leg of the &quot;Echoes, Silence, Patience and Grace&quot; tour. While on tour, King finished recording what became the &quot;Day Sleeper (Australian tour EP)&quot;. It was released in late 2007 after King had finished working on &quot;August Rush&quot;, and with Eddie Vedder and Sean Penn on &quot;Into The Wild&quot;.

===Further changes in sound===
King recruited Malcolm Burn to help with her next album, &quot;Dreaming of Revenge&quot;, and in December 2007 wrote about it in her blog: &quot;I finished the new album. Don&#x27;t get your panties in a tangle, it won&#x27;t be released until next year, but it&#x27;s done. And it&#x27;s amazing.&quot; Filled with more melodic pop tunes than previous albums, &quot;Dreaming of Revenge&quot; was released on March 11, 2008 to highly positive reviews. On March 4, 2008, iTunes released a full version of &quot;Dreaming of Revenge&quot; featuring the bonus track &quot;I Need A Girl Who Knows A Map&quot;. After filming a video for &quot;Pull Me Out Alive&quot;, she began her tour.

In the first half of King&#x27;s tour, she headlined at The Roxy and toured with The Mountain Goats, which led to the exclusive release of Kaki King and The Mountain Goats EP &quot;Black Pear Tree EP&quot;. While touring Australia in 2008, King filmed part of the music video &quot;Can Anyone Who Has Heard This Music Really Be A Bad Person?&quot; in Sydney. Directed by Michael Ebner, the rest of the video was completed in New York in 2009. After completing the last leg of her world tour, King decided to tour once again with a strictly acoustic show. Dubbed &#x27;The &quot;No Bullshit&quot; Tour&#x27;, King did smaller shows throughout the US and UK that were specifically focused on acoustic works from her first albums along with stripped-down versions of her newer songs.

After completing her &quot;No Bullshit Tour,&quot; King scored work on the independent film &quot;How I Got Lost&quot;, and started to record her next EP, titled &quot;Mexican Teenagers EP.&quot; Recruiting her band that she used from &quot;Dreaming of Revenge&quot;, King cut five new tracks for her new album.

====&quot;Junior&quot;====

After meeting with Carter Burwell to start work on the scoring for the &quot;Twilight&quot; movies, and completing work on Timbaland&#x27;s &quot;Shock Value II&quot; (which became Miley Cyrus&#x27; &quot;We Belong to the Music&quot;), King began to outline her ideals for her 5th record. King&#x27;s interest in Cold War novels, Russian spies and espionage themes, particularly that of double spies living in a double life, became the basis for her new album, &quot;Junior&quot;. Ranging lyrically &quot;from exuberance and anger to heartbreaking melancholy, and sonically from experimental pieces to accessible pop,&quot; &quot;Junior&quot; showcases her further maturation as a well-rounded artist that continues to defy categorization and expectations.

As with her previous album, 2008&#x27;s &quot;Dreaming of Revenge&quot;, &quot;Junior&quot; was produced by Malcolm Burn and recorded at his studio in Kingston, New York. But in contrast to that record, which was marked by deep textures and layers as well as unusual instrumentation, &quot;Junior&quot; was specifically made with only three musicians in mind – in this case King, multi-instrumentalist Dan Brantigan and drummer Jordan Perlson. The result was something more direct. &quot;Prior to this I would have written a lot in the studio and played all the instruments myself,&quot; King says. &quot;This time, I really leaned on Dan and Jordan to help shape the songs and help me get the record written.&quot;

King toured for five weeks in Europe in support of her LP &quot;Junior&quot;, on the Cooking Vinyl label. She later appeared as the musical guest on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, sitting in with The Roots as a part of the house band, and began a US-based tour.

When asked by &quot;Premier Guitar Magazine&quot; what her plans were after completing her tour, King responded &quot;I&#x27;ve been on the road for four months straight. In another three weeks, we&#x27;ll be done with this tour. Honestly, that&#x27;s about as far as I can see.&quot;

====&quot;Traveling Freak Guitar Show&quot;====
King returned to her roots as a solo acoustic performer in 2011, going on her first tour without a backing band since 2005. King planned a tour with a collection of seven instruments including a harp guitar, dojo, a custom 7-string nylon string guitar with fanned fret board, and a hybrid between a guitar and koto that King made herself. Before beginning the tour, King performed with some of these instruments at the opening of an exhibit of Picasso&#x27;s guitar paintings at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The tour began on February 24 in Mexico City and ended on April 9, 2011 in Binghamton.

===Guitar Art Show===
In 2009, King conceived of an art show in which twelve different artists would be commissioned to create visual pieces themed after her songs, using the guitar as the primary artistic medium. As King described it, 

The final total came to fifteen distinct pieces which were then put on display for a one-night exhibition at The Littlefield in Brooklyn. During the exhibit, King provided her own contribution by covering her hands in pink paint and performing her song, &#x27;Playing with Pink Noise&#x27;, leaving the guitar covered in pink fingerprints.

===&quot;Everybody Glows: B-sides &amp; Rarities&quot;===
On November 4, 2014, Kaki released her first B-sides and rarities album entitled, &quot;Everybody Glows&quot;. The album features a collection of outtakes, demos, covers, live versions and never before heard recordings culled from scratched demo CDs, long-forgotten hard drives, and the fuzzier corners of her memory. The collection reveals the evolution of her songwriting while offering a glimpse of a young guitarist doing daring things on her instrument before she grasped the significance of any of it. The album comes with a track-by-track explanation of each song, along with liner notes written by her father. This is the first album Kaki released on her own label, Short Stuff Records.

===&quot;The Neck Is a Bridge to the Body&quot;===

In 2014, King collaborated with the visual experience company Glowing Pictures to construct a multimedia production in which the guitar is used as a projection screen to tell a story. The hour-long production entitled &quot;The Neck Is a Bridge to the Body&quot; places the focus on the guitar itself. Projections of a creation myth including genesis and death were cast onto Ovation Adamas 1581-KK Kaki King Signature 6-String Acoustic guitar customized specifically for the production.

&quot;The Guitar is a shape-shifter,&quot; King says, &quot;something that plays all types of music and really fills all kinds of roles. It&#x27;s not always the six-string guitar that we all know and love. I&#x27;ve been playing guitar for more than 30 years. It&#x27;s who I am and if anything, this project has made me even more familiar with it.&quot;

&quot;The Neck Is a Bridge to the Body&quot; debuted at Brooklyn&#x27;s BRIC Theater in New York City in 2014, and was to tour extensively in 2015. An album featuring the music from the show will also be released on March 3, 2015 on King&#x27;s label, Short Stuff Records.

In August 2017, King made a course on digital pedalboards with online music education platform Soundfly, demonstrating many of the techniques she used in &quot;The Neck Is a Bridge to the Body&quot; tour performances.

===&quot;Modern Yesterdays&quot;===
In 2019, King debuted a theatrical piece called DATA NOT FOUND, incorporating monologue, set design, lighting design, and audio-reactive sound design. After working with sound designer Chloe Alexandra Thompson to develop the sound design for DATA NOT FOUND, King expanded upon the music written for the show, co-producing the album Chloe Alexandra Thompson and Arjan Miranda. The album also incorporates a new invention, the passerelle bridge, designed by King in collaboration with Providence-based luthier Rachel Rosenkrantz.

The album was recorded in New York City in early March 2020, mere days before the first city-wide COVID-19 shutdowns. “We all gave each other COVID while we were making the record,&quot; King explained. Once everyone recovered, it became clear that tour plans would have to be postponed, but King decided to proceed with the release of the record. She adds, “It&#x27;s sort of shocking that it even got done, given the timeframe.&quot;

The album &quot;Modern Yesterdays&quot; was released on October 23, 2020, on Cantaloupe Music.

Inspired by the album and its source inspirations, King produced MODERN YESTERDAYS (the live show titled after the album), showcasing audio-reactive designs for both the guitar and snare drum. The live show debuted worldwide and online in late October 2020, first recorded at the Ferst Center for the Arts in Atlanta, Georgia. MODERN YESTERDAYS debuted in front of a live audience at Lincoln Center in New York City in September 2021. It is currently touring extensively around the world.

==Style, techniques and instruments==
As a long-time Ovation player, King was invited to design her own custom guitar, the result being the Adamas 1581-KK model. Each guitar is signed by King, and she can be seen playing it often on tour and in The DVD for Tegan And Sara&#x27;s &quot;The Con&quot;.

King&#x27;s fingerstyle playing combines fret-tapping with slap bass techniques, using the guitar for percussive beats, as well as sound layering and looping. Her playing style has been compared to Michael Hedges and Preston Reed, the latter of whom she explicitly cites as an influence.

King uses Elixir Strings, particularly the Acoustic Light Guitar Strings on her custom Ovation Adamas guitar, and is a featured artist on the company&#x27;s website.

==Personal life==
King married Jessica Templin in October 2012, giving Templin her surname. They honeymooned in Australia, where King played at the Peats Ridge Festival. The couple have two children.

<text>Jamel Debbouze (; ; born 18 June 1975) is a French-Moroccan actor, comedian, screenwriter, film producer and director. Best known for his stand-up comedy sketches, he also worked with director Alain Chabat in several films and other notable French comedians such as Florence Foresti, Fred Testot and Gad Elmaleh. He has starred in a number of box-office successes, including &quot;Amélie&quot;, &quot;Asterix &amp; Obelix: Mission Cleopatra&quot;, &quot;Hollywoo&quot; and &quot;HOUBA! On the Trail of the Marsupilami&quot;. He is the founder of the Canal+ television show &quot;Jamel Comedy Club&quot;.

==Life==
Debbouze was born in Paris, France. His family, from Taza, moved back to Morocco the following year. They returned in 1979 and settled in Trappes in 1983, in the Paris region, where was spent the rest of his childhood. He is the eldest of six siblings: Jamel, Mohamed, Hayat, Karim, Rachid and Nawel Debbouze.

On 17 January 1990, at the train station in Trappes, he was struck by a passing train travelling at 150 km/h. He lost the use of his right arm in the accident, which killed another young man, Jean-Paul Admette, the son of the singer Michel Admette from Reunion. Debbouze was sued by the victim&#x27;s family for manslaughter but the case was dismissed for lack of proof. In December 2004, he was going to perform on stage on the French island of Réunion, but Debbouze cancelled, claiming illness, as Michel Admette&#x27;s parents had organized a demonstration against his arrival. He has since never set foot on Reunion.

In 1995, he was spotted by the bosses of Radio Nova, Jacques Massadian and Jean-François Bizot, who made him famous (Massadian would become his manager). He debuted on Radio Nova, with a film review show, &quot;Le Cinéma de Jamel&quot; and on television around 1996–1997 on cable channel Paris Première, in a TV show co-produced by Radio Nova and the channel. He took &quot;Le Cinéma de Jamel&quot; to television on Canal+ in 1998. On the same channel, he contributed to another show, &quot;H&quot;, along with Éric Judor and Ramzy Bedia.

He acted in the movies &quot;Zonzon&quot; (1998), international box-office hit &quot;Amélie&quot; (2001), domestic hit &quot;Asterix &amp; Obelix: Mission Cleopatra&quot; (2002), and &quot;Angel-A&quot; (2005, directed by Luc Besson).

In 2006, he acted in the historical movie &quot;Days of Glory&quot; (which he co-produced), paying tribute to the North-African soldiers who fought for France during the Second World War. For this movie, he got the prize for best male actor at the 59th edition of the Cannes Film Festival with Samy Naceri, Roschdy Zem, Sami Bouajila and Bernard Blancan.

In April 2008, Debbouze opened a comedy club, called Le Comedy Club, in Paris aimed at launching newcomers on the stand-up scene.

On 29 March 2008, Debbouze became engaged to French journalist and news anchor Mélissa Theuriau; the two married on 7 May 2008 and subsequently had two children.

In 2009, Debbouze collaborated with the rap band 113 and Awa Imani for the project Maghreb United of Rim&#x27;K&#x27;.

On 1 December 2010, Debbouze&#x27;s new DVD named &quot;Made in Jamel&quot; featuring the likes of Gad Elmaleh, Florence Foresti, Élie Semoun, Stromae, Didier Bourdon, Youness Ait Benouissaden, Hanane Nader, Noureddine Oussayah and Sophie Mounicot was released.

His show, &quot;Jamel improvise&quot;, debuted in January 2011, before playing every evening&#x27;s &quot;Tout sur Jamel&quot; from 1 to 20 January at the Casino de Paris.

He was the chairman of the 2013 César Awards.

==Career==
===First works===
In 1990, Debbouze met Alain Degois, an educator who organized theater improvisation workshops, and joined his troupe. With this troupe, he took part in the French Championship of Improvisation in 1991 and toured Quebec and Morocco. In 1992, he got his first part in a film called &quot;Les Pierres Bleues du Désert&quot;. After this film, Debbouze wanted to work as an actor and create his own show. This happened in 1995 with the show &quot;C&#x27;est Tout Neuf&quot; which had been enjoyed a lot. Then he had an approximative role on the radio program &quot;Radio Nova&quot; and took part in the television program &quot;Nova Premiere&quot; where he was noticed by Canal+.

In 1998, Debbouze played Jamel Dridi, an operator, in the hospital sitcom, &quot;H&quot; on Canal+, alongside fellow comedians Eric and Ramzy. By the time the series ended in 2002, Debbouze had achieved national fame.

In March 1999, Debbouze started his new show &quot;Jamel en Scène&quot;. In this show, Debbouze talked about his beginnings, his childhood and show business. The show played at La Cigale and then at the Bataclan in Paris. He went on tour throughout France in 2000. At the end of the year, he returned to Paris with his show at the Olympia for three weeks.

He then toured France, Morocco, Tunisia, Switzerland, and Belgium. The DVD of the show went on sale in 2004, and sold more than 1 million copies.

In 2006, Debbouze became the presenter of a new program, &quot;Jamel Comedy Club&quot;, which featured a half-hour of the new generation of French humorists each week. With this troupe, Debbouze went to the Casino de Paris in 2007 for a new show, &quot;Le Jamel Comedy Club Envahit le Casino de Paris&quot;. This show was very successful, its run was extended and it also played in Canada.

=== Cinematic works ===

In 1992, the seventeen-year-old Debbouze appeared in his first film, &quot;Les Pierres Bleues du Désert&quot;.

In 1996, he played a small part in &quot;Les Deux papas et la maman&quot;, a film by Jean-Marc Doval with Smaïn and Arielle Dombasle. Three years later he received his first big role in a feature film called &quot;Le Ciel les oiseaux et ta ... mère!&quot; (&quot;Boys on the Beach&quot;). This comedy was successful, with more than one million tickets sold. Over the next two years he continued his stage shows, before returning to film with the highly successful &quot;Le fabuleux destin d&#x27;Amélie Poulain&quot;. He was nominated for his part in this film for the César Award for Best Supporting Actor in 2002. In 2002, Debbouze appeared in another big French film, &quot;Asterix &amp; Obelix: Mission Cleopatra&quot; directed by Alain Chabat. This successful film was seen by 14,000,000 spectators. In 2005, he had the leading role in Luc Besson&#x27;s film &quot;Angel-A&quot;.

In 2006, Debbouze played one of the most important parts of his career in the film &quot;Indigènes&quot; (&quot;Days of Glory&quot; in the United States). The film told the story of four North African soldiers who participate in the liberation of France during World War II. Debbouze, Samy Naceri, Sami Bouajila and Roschdy Zem shared the prize for the best male performance at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival.

=== Television work ===
In 1996, he took part for the first time in a TV show called &quot;Nova première&quot; on Paris Première. He was noticed on this show by some producers from Canal+ who hired him to present a show called &quot;Le cinéma de Jamel&quot;. For New Year&#x27;s Eve in 2000, Debbouze created a TV show for this occasion called the &quot;Jamel show&quot;. Numerous French comedians such as Bruno Solo, Alain Chabat, Élie Semoun, and Dieudonné appeared in this show. In April 2003, he took part in 6 commercials for Orangina.

<doc id="1310393" wikidata="Q4630643" url="?curid=1310393" title="20th (Light) Division">
<text>The 20th (Light) Division was an infantry division of the British Army, part of Kitchener&#x27;s Army, raised in the First World War. The division was formed in September 1914 as part of the K2 Army Group. The division landed in France July 1915 and spent the duration of the First World War in action on the Western Front. The division was disbanded after the end of the war in early 1919.

==History==
===1914–15===
====Formation and training====
The 20th (Light) Division was authorised on 11 September 1914 and was to be composed of newly raised battalions from quick marching rifle and light infantry regiments. The 59th and 60th Brigades were concentrated at Blackdown with the Division Headquarters and other division troops. The 61st Brigade was concentrated at Aldershot, where the medical component also trained, the Artillery was formed near Deepcut, the engineers were trained at Chatham. Clothing, in the form of emergency &quot;Kitchener Blue&quot; uniforms did not arrive until November, together with a few old rifles for drill practice, the artillery had only two 90 mm guns and two 15-pounders per brigade. The supply situation had improved by February 1915 when the Division moved to Whitley, by which time the 11th DLI, which had a large number of miners in it had become the Division pioneer battalion, trading places in the 61st Brigade with the 12th King&#x27;s Regiment, the original divisional troops battalion. In April the Division marched to the Salisbury Plain Training Area to complete its training and were joined by the field ambulances after their training in June. the Division was inspected by the King at the end of that month, and embarked for France in the later part of July.

====Arrival in France====
Leaving Amesbury on 20 July, by 26 July the division was concentrated in the Lumbres area east of Boulogne-sur-Mer. By 30 July the Division was part of III Corps of the First Army, and was billeted in the area between Hazebrouck and Armentières. Training now began in trench warfare, with officers and N.C.O.s being posted to the 8th and 27th Divisions, and bombing (grenades), machine gun and gas mask training for the other troops. The units of the division were rotated though the 8th and 27th Divisions in turn to experience trench warfare first hand between 2 and 17 August. The engineers and pioneers were employed at various tasks behind the lines.
At the end of August the division went into the front line in front of Levantie, south west of Armentiers, 59th and 60th Brigades in the line and the 61st in reserve. In this area the high water table meant that breastworks were required for defence. During September mining and counter mining were carried out and snipers were trained in response to losses from German snipers. The 61st Brigade moved into the line on 5 September, relieving a brigade of the 8th Division. In the early hours of 13 September a mine was exploded by the Germans under a small salient held by 7th S.L.I. The crater was occupied by others from the battalion in spite of German shelling and mortaring, and 12 of the soldiers buried by the explosion were rescued alive. The first gallantry awards earned by men of the division were awarded for this action. These amounted to a Military Cross and a Distinguished Service Medal.

====Loos====

As part of a subsidiary action north of Loos, the 20th Division with the flanking Divisions (the Meerut Division to the south and the 8th to the north) were to launch a diversionary attack on the German lines, holding any lines gained. After four days of bombardment, with changes in the tempo of the shelling falsely indicating an imminent attack, and other demonstrations from the front line the attack was made on the morning of 25 September. Troops from the Indian Bareilly Brigade, and two battalions from the 60th Brigade (6th K.S.L.I. and 12th R.B.) managed to enter the German lines, but an attempt to drive a sap back towards the British lines was met with heavy enfilade fire and was halted. Unable to be supported the British were forced to retire around midday. The other two brigades made no advance that day but were still shelled in their trenches. Lieutenant George Allen Maling, an R.A.M.C. officer of the field ambulance attached to the 60th Brigade, received the Victoria Cross for treating men in the open under heavy shell fire all through the day. The 60th Brigade had suffered 561 casualties in total, and next day the pioneers (11th D.L.I.) were attached to the Brigade as reinforcing infantry until 10 November, and the 68th Brigade from the 23rd Division was attached as division reserve.

The three brigades remained in the line, engaged in patrolling, mining, mortaring, sniping and demonstrating in order to prevent the Germans relieving parts of their line. The Division&#x27;s mounted troops rotated through the trenches, and the cyclist company troops provided working parties. On 10 November the Indian Corps to the Division&#x27;s right was relieved and replaced with XI Corps, this allowed the Division to shorten its line to two Brigades, the pioneers and the 68th Brigade returned to their normal roles. For the rest of the year the Division&#x27;s artillery saw the most use, however a trench raid by parties from 10th R.B. and 11th K.R.R.C. was mounted on the night of 12–13 December. The 11th K.R.R.C. entered the German trenches, inflicting casualties, the 10th R.B. party had further to travel over no-mans land and faced an alerted enemy and were forced to withdraw.

===1916===
A gas attack, planned for the previous December, was finally launched with the arrival of favourable winds, as the Division began to leave the Levantie sector on 9 January 1916. Less than half of the cylinders intended were still in place and trench raids planned for that night were cancelled.
The final units of the division arrived in the reserve area on 13 January. After one weeks rest and training the Division was ordered to the Ypres Salient.

====Ypres====

Arriving on 22 January in VI Corps reserve area, officers and N.C.O.s were sent to 14th Division, which the Division was to relieve, to become acquainted with the area. On 4 February VI Corps handed over to the newly formed XIV Corps (20th Division and the Guards Division). The Division was in the northern section of the salient, north of Ypres with its left on the canal. The area had been rendered a quagmire by shelling and the trench system was fragmented, shallow and poorly maintained, these remnants being separated by gaps of up to of mud. On the night of 11–12 February during the first placement of 60th Brigade into the line, the Germans attempted to interrupt the relief, but were thrown back after temporarily capturing one of the trench fragments. They were praised by Army and Corps commanders for their successful actions &quot;...in novel conditions which might have placed them at a disadvantage,&quot; and by their own division and brigade commanders. Shortly after this isolated points were abandoned, one of which was from the German line and connected to it by a sap. The engineers and pioneers began the task of improving the trench system, the size of the task indicated by the fact that for a time of material per night were being moved from divisional workshops to the 96th Field Company R.E., attached to the 60th Brigade. The difference in conditions in the salient can be seen in the casualty figures for the first month, of around 1,000 men killed, wounded or missing, equal to those of the whole five months while in the Laventie sector.

In early March the Division was strengthened by the arrival of three companies of machine gunners, one attached to each brigade.
The Division was relieved by the 6th Division on 15 April, and went into GHQ and Corps reserve around Poperinghe, with the men of each brigade spending around a week on leave in Calais. During a month of rest and retraining, the artillery was reorganised and the mounted troops and cyclist company left the Division.
On 18 May the Division returned to the salient, relieving the Guards Division to the right of its previous position between Wieltje and Hooge, with the 6th Division on its left and the Canadian Corps on its right.

=====Battle of Mont Sorrel=====

On 2 June the Germans launched an attack on the Canadians to the right of the Division. The right of the 60th Brigade received some of the German artillery barrage and two artillery pieces, placed near the Canadian front line to give enfilade fire along the Division&#x27;s front, were lost with most of the crews. Units travelling up to the line were also shelled, including two companies of 12 K.R.R.C., sent to reinforce the Canadian left. The 60th Brigade was targeted by German artillery on 6 June, however it was able to fire on German infantry moving up to attack the Canadians at Hooge, an infantry attack on the brigade later that day was repulsed, but a mine was exploded under the trenches of 12 R.B. at Gulley Farm killing 11 men. Throughout the day the Division supported the Canadians with Trench mortar fire and the engineers assisted with the maintenance of communications. When the Canadians counter-attacked in the early hours of 13 June the Division launched gas, smoke and artillery attacks on the German lines, followed by patrols and trench raids which met with varied success.

The remainder of the Division&#x27;s time at Ypres was spent patrolling and in trench raids. On 13 July 60th Brigade was placed under orders of II ANZAC Corps and transferred to the Armentieres sector, and supported an unsuccessful attack by the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division and the 5th Australian Division on 19 June. The remainder of the Division was relieved on 14 July. On 19 July the Division began to move back into the Line between Messines and Wytschaete, relieving the 24th Division. The Division Commander had been in command of the area for little more than an hour when verbal orders were received for a move south. The 60th Brigade rejoined the Division on 23 July, on 25–26 July the Division moved south leaving its artillery in the Ypres area.

====The Somme====

By 29 July the division was in the line on the north of the Somme battlefield, between Beaumont-Hamel and Hebuterne, having relieved the 38th (Welsh) Division except for its artillery which stayed to support the 20th. To the right of the division was the 25th Division, and to the left, the 56th (1st London) Division. The trenches in this area had been heavily shelled by the Germans in the first days of the battle, and the front could only be held with advance parties. The pioneers and engineers of the division dug new firing trenches and had to repair the communications trenches up to behind the front line. The division signal company was also employed repairing and replacing the buried telephone cables of the area, all the while under sporadic artillery and trench mortar fire. The 38th Division artillery was relieved by the Guards Division artillery on 7 August, and on 16 August the division was relieved by the Guards Division.

=====Battle of Guillemont=====
The division returned to the line on 22 August, relieving the 24th Division north of the Guillemont-Montauban road and south of Delville Wood. The 59th and 61st brigades were in the line with one battalion each in the firing trenches, the division was supported by the artillery of the 6th Division. Preparations for an assault on 24 August were begun, repairing and digging new trenches for the assault, but this was interrupted by German artillery on the evening of 23 August followed by an infantry advance on the 11th K.R.R.C., this was broken up by rifle and machine-gun fire, but the trenches were damaged again and the battalion suffered around 150 casualties from the bombardment. The attack was postponed by the Corps command, and the division side stepped to the south of the Guillemont-Montauban road, west of the village on 25–26 August. Preparations for the new attack were hampered by a rain and heavy shelling, including the use of gas shells by the Germans.

Supply of the front line became difficult and at one point (29 August) 37 of the division&#x27;s vehicles were stuck in the mud of the Carnoy-Montauban road. On the night of 28/29 August all available men of all three brigades were working in the mud of the forward area still covered in the bodies of the dead from previous assaults. Coupled with German probing attacks the troops were becoming exhausted and some time out of the trenches was agreed for the 59th and 60th brigades which were scheduled to make the attack, which had been put back to 3 September. The 59th brigade had suffered 600 casualties in the line in nine days and the 60th was so weakened that (with the exception of 6th Ox and Bucks L.I.) it was withdrawn into Corps reserve and replaced in the division with 47th brigade from the 16th (Irish) Division. The 6th Ox and Bucks L.I, still only 550 rifles strong, was attached to the 59th brigade.

The 59th brigade returned to the trenches prepared by the pioneers and engineers during the night of 2–3 September, they were to be the right of the divisions advance with the 47th brigade on the left, each brigade supported by a battalion from the 61st brigade and a company of the division&#x27;s engineers and one of pioneers, the remainder of 61st brigade and the three battalions of 60th brigade (only around 1000 men) were in reserve. The 5th Division was to advance on the division&#x27;s right, and the 7th Division on its left. Additional artillery support was provided by the artillery from the 8th and 24th divisions and the Corps heavy artillery.

The artillery bombardment began at 06:00 hours at selected targets, moving around the battle field and including gas at around 08:30 hours. The 5th division&#x27;s advance began at 09:00 hours, 20th division advanced at noon behind stationary and rolling barrages, with the advance led by the 10th and 11th R.B. and the 6th Connaught Rangers and 7th Leinsters. The first objective was occupied by 12:30, a sunken road some from the start line and parts of the western edge of the village were held by the 6th Ox and Bucks L.I. and 10th K.R.R.C., parts of the northern edge of the village were held by the 6th Connaught Rangers and 7th Leinsters. The reserve brigade began to move forward.

The attack on the second objective, a road running roughly north-south through the eastern part of the village, then north-east towards Ginchy, on average about further on, began at 12:50, with the 10th and 11th R.B. in the lead supported by the two K.R.R.C. battalions and the 6th Ox &amp; Bucks, and on the 47th brigade front the 8th Munster Fusiliers with the Leinsters and Connaughts in support. The road was reached by 13:30 with the supporting infantry mopping up in the village and an orchard to the south. The assault on the third objective, a road between Ginchy to the north and &quot;Wedge wood&quot; to the south, about east of the village was begun at 14:00 hours, while the 59th brigade encountered only small parties of Germans, the 6th Royal Irish and the Munsters had to rush the last to the road under fire from positions on it.

The final objective was a line between the corner of Leuze wood to the south ( further forward) and the railway line to the north ( from the third line). However the 5th division had not gained ground and the right flank of 59th brigade was open, Brigadier-General Shute then lengthened the line to the right with the 6th Ox and Bucks and used the 7th D.C.L.I. to form a flank facing south east. On the left, 7th division were reported in the village of Ginchy. The engineers and pioneers continued to consolidate the village and troops from the reserve moved forward through it. An advance to the fourth line was ordered at 15:50 hours. However, by 17:00 hours the situation had changed, 7th division were driven out of Ginchy and the 5th division had not managed to advance to Leuze wood. A bombardment by Corps artillery helped stabilise the line in front of the 20th division that night. Patrols were made up to the forth line and on the flanks, one of these from the 12th King&#x27;s sent towards Ginchy became isolated during repeated German attacks on that flank between 17:30 and 20:30 hours. That night the 83rd and 96th engineer companies, the 7th D.C.L.I. and two companies of pioneers continued to consolidate Guillemont, while the 84th engineer company and the remaining pioneers strengthened the line on the road. Orders for the next day (4 September) were to send out patrols under artillery support and establish the division on the fourth objective. Due to their losses the Royal Irish and the Munsters were ordered to be replaced by 60th brigade, 12th K.R.R.C. and 12 R.B. and the 7th K.O.Y.L.I.. The 59th brigade was also becoming exhausted and two companies of the 11th D.L.I. were sent to relieve the most tired units.

The attack began at 19:30 hours, and with the 5th division advancing on the right, reached the final objective. The 47th and 59th brigades were relieved by the 16th (Irish) Division during the night and morning of 4–5 September, including the isolated patrol from the 12 King&#x27;s, led by Sgt David Jones, this reduced platoon had held out for two days, repulsing three attacks on the morning of 5 September. For this Sgt Jones was awarded the Victoria Cross. The remainder of the division left the front line on 7 September. During the battle the division had lost 1973 officers and men killed, wounded or missing.

=====Morval and Lesbœufs=====

The division artillery had returned from the Ypres salient to the Somme on 13 September and was posted to XIV Corps but not under command of the 20th division. While at Ypres 90th artillery brigade had been broken up a distributed amongst the other to increase each battery from four to six 18-pounders or 4.5&quot; howitzers. The 91st artillery brigade was in action on 15 September supporting the 56th (London) Division. The division returned to the front on 15 September as XIV Corps reserve, after a short rest but no reinforcement. The 59th brigade could muster only 900 rifles, the 60th brigade 1100 and the 61st brigade 1200. In the early hours of 16 September the 60th and 61st brigade went into the front line under orders of the Guards Division, the 61st to the right of the Guards line opposite Lesbœufs and the 60th in reserve.

The objective was a trench line around west of the villages of Morval and Lesbœufs and was to be taken by 61st brigade on the right and the 3rd Guards brigade on the left. The 31st brigade right flank was open as the 6th division was held up by the &#x27;Quadrilateral&#x27; fortification. Due to late orders the 61st brigade was late forming up and was subject to heavy machine-gun and Minenwerfer fire, causing many casualties. Following the rolling barrage 7th D.C.L.I. gained the objective, however only one company of the 7th S.L.I. gained the line. Both flanks of the 7th D.C.L.I. were initially open as the remainder of the 7th S.L.I. had dug in short of the trench line and the guards brigade, which had also received their orders late, had faced strong opposition during their advance. In this isolated position the advance to the second line was called off. Later that morning the right flank of the brigade was secured by the 7th K.O.Y.L.I. and the 12th King&#x27;s and the 84th Engineer company reinforced the position. All battalions remained in this position overnight, under fire from the Germans, until relieved the next morning.

While the 61st brigade went into Corps reserve the remainder of the division relieved the Guards in the front line during the night of 16–17 September, the 60th brigade on the right, the 59th on the left. The relief was made against German opposition, the 59th brigade moving up under gas attack and the 60th facing German attempts to enter their trenches later that day. On 17 September the 59th brigade were ordered to capture the remaining of the trench line not taken the previous day. The orders were received only a short time before the attack due to the difficulty in communicating with the front line, which was an old communications trench at right angles to the line of intended advance. One company of the 11th R.B. did not receive any orders, all the runners to this unit being killed or wounded. With no artillery support available the attack failed with some men of the 10th R.B. being killed on reaching the German wire. After consolidating the trenches the division was relieved on 21 September. The division&#x27;s artillery, still under Corps control supported a number of other divisions in this area, which resulted in the capture of Morval and Lesbœufs on 25 September.

=====Le Transloy=====
The division returned to the front on 25 September and eventually relieved the 21st Division on the night of 29–30 September from halfway between Lesbœufs to a point east of Gueudecourt, facing a low ridge beyond which was Le Transloy. The front line was held by 61st brigade with 60th in support and the 59th brigade in reserve some behind the line, west of Guillemont. For the next advance the division was to be supported by a strong artillery group consisting of the division&#x27;s own three artillery brigades, those of the Guards division and a brigade from the 6th division. This artillery was crowded together in a valley known as &#x27;Toc 7 Valley&#x27; about north-east of Delville Wood, a position known to the Germans and shelled regularly.

Before the main assault, on 1 October 7 S.L.I. and 7th D.C.L.I. pushed the line forward by in a series of small posts into dead ground within of the German line, repelling a counter-attack later that day. That night the engineers and pioneers connected and consolidated these posts. On the night of 3–4 October the 60th brigade joined the 61st in the front line, however due to a break in the weather the assault was put back for two days to 7 October. This allowed the troops who were to make the assault two days rest out of the line, further supplies to be brought up and more front line and communications trenches to be prepared. The strength of the brigades had recovered to a total of just under 6,500 men in total, still only slight over 50% of the nominal strength.

The objective was to establish a line over the crest of the ridge overlooking Le Transloy on the second German trench and was only a small part of an attack of the whole front of Fourth Army. On the left 61st brigade would attack with 6th Ox and Bucks L.I and 12th R.B. with 12th K.R.R.C. in support and 6th K.S.L.I. in reserve and on the right for 60th brigade, 7th K.O.Y.L.I. and 12th King&#x27;s with 7th S.L.I in support and 7th D.C.L.I. in reserve. On 7 October the preceding artillery bombardment managed to cut most of the German wire except for some on the 60th brigade front. At 13:45 hours the attack began behind the rolling barrage with each battalion advancing in four lines. The uncut wire caused delays and heavy casualties to the 6th Ox and Bucks and 12th R.B. and an open left flank, caused by a heavy German bombardment on 12th (Eastern) Division, caused casualties to the 61st brigade from enfilade fire. In spite of this the first two lines of troops took the first trench, &#x27;Rainbow Trench&#x27; and the third and fourth lines formed up beyond it ready for the next stage. At 14:05 hours the next barrage began and the second trench, &#x27;Cloudy Trench&#x27;, was found to be little more than a line of disturbed earth when it was taken against lighter resistance only ten minutes later. The division, now digging in on its new line, was now in a salient with exposed flanks and a gap of around between the brigades with the leading battalion lines commanded by a Captain (12th King&#x27;s) and a lieutenant (7th K.O.L.I.). Companies from the support and reserve battalions were brought forward to fill in the gaps and German counterattacks later that day were beaten off. The engineers and pioneers together with other troops established a communication trench to the front line, and men from the 59th brigade came forward to continue work in the starting lines.

 The division was relieved by 6th division on the night of 8–9 October, having lost 1,112 killed, wounded and missing from the brigades and taken 192 German prisoners. It moved to Treux for a period of rest, while there, corps commander praised the men of the division for their part in the Somme battles and added, 

The division&#x27;s artillery remained in the line as part of the Corps artillery group, assisting in later assaults. The remainder of the division would spend two months out of the line resting, retraining and absorbing much needed replacements. The division returned to the line on 9 December, relieving the 29th Division around south-west and south of Le Transloy. The weather was bad and communications between the front line and rear area was slow at first, a relief to the firing trench taking as long as nine hours, with only some improvement achieved by the time the division left the area. After a relatively uneventful time the division was relieved by the 17th (Northern) Division on 25 December. The 93rd artillery brigade was transferred permanently to Army control about this time.

===1917===
The division returned to the front on 4 January, relieving the Guards south of Le Transloy in a line through the village of Sailley-Saillisel. Two brigades, the 60th and 61st were at the front with two battalions each in the fire trench, the Guards division was to the right and the 17th (Northern) to the left. The front line consisted of a series of isolated posts, some only from the Germans. The divisions artillery was once again under command of the division for a while as part of the Corp group, with 29th division&#x27;s artillery and other units. Until relieved on 30 January by 17th (Northern) division, the 20th held the line repulsing German attacks with the machine gunners and artillery providing covering fire for other formations attacks. On 10 February the division returned to the front, on the northern edge of their previous position and lost one of the more isolated advanced posts which was out of sight from the British line and which the division had been given permission to abandon shortly before its loss. By the beginning of March the British were aware that the Germans intended to withdraw to a more favourable line.

====The Hindenburg Line====

The Germans began to retire from the line in front of 20th division on 17 March, after morning patrols had found them still in place. Thereafter the division kept pace with the German rearguard and by 28 March had advanced some from its position in front of Le-Transloy. Here the Germans established a line of resistance along the line of the villages of Fins, Neuville-Bourjonval and Ruyaulcourt. During this time the division had been transferred to XV Corps and had been joined on 24 March by the 217th Machine Gun Company as the divisional machine gunners. The initial advance of the division&#x27;s artillery (still part of the corps group) had been hampered by the torn-up ground of the battlefield, on one occasion taking up to six hours to move guns , and on another losing one gun in a water filled shell hole. In order to improve the roads in the division&#x27;s rear the 96th engineer company, 11th D.L.I., 10th RB. and 7th K.O.Y.L.I were detached under corps orders to improved road and rail communications, returning to the division at the end of the month.

On 28 March the 61st brigade supported by the 91st artillery brigade, 84th engineer company and a squadron from the XIV Corps cavalry regiment (King Edward&#x27;s Horse) were ordered to take the villages of Neuville-Bourjonval (7th D.C.L.I.) and Ruyaulcourt (12th King&#x27;s). Starting from the village of Ytres at 20:15 hours against heavy machine gun fire, Neuville-Bourjonval was entered early on 29 March and was occupied by 02:30 hours with posts established to its east.

The attack on Ruyaulcourt was defeated by a wire trap not previously known and the battalion entrenched south west of the village. The next night the village was found empty and occupied by the 7th S.L.I. while the 59th brigade established a line along the northern half of the Neuville-Bourjonval – Fins road. On 4 April the 59th brigade supported by 83rd engineer company and the whole of the division artillery attacked a German line between the village of Metz west of Neuville-Bourjonval and the corner of Haverincourt Wood. The 10th and 11th K.R.R.C. suffered heavy casualties, around 25% due to machine gun and rifle fire but occupied the village some two hours after the assault began. German prisoners stated that they had not expected to be attacked until 7 April. Thereafter the line was continually pushed forwards, and before the end of April was in front of the Hindenburg Line from north of Trescault, from Le-Transloy, north west through Haverincourt Wood to the Canal du Nord. For the next few weeks the division had a relatively quiet time, apart from digging the new front line. On 23 May the division was relieved by the 40th Division and it was transferred to the Fifth Army, IV Corps.

The division was redeployed to the north west facing Quéant where IV Corps relieved I Anzac Corps, 48th (South Midland) Division was to the division&#x27;s right and 58th (2/1st London) Division (of V Corps) to its left. The line here, from ~ east of Bullecourt (in the original Hindenburg system) to just east of Lagnicourt, was a series of posts, as the trench system had been comprehensively wrecked, and the divisional artillery could only be sited in valleys which ran towards the German lines and were so under observation. Three weeks of active patrolling and trench raids followed with the division suffering heavy bombardment, especially during reliefs. By 22 June the artillery had left the line to refit and on 29 June the rest of the division was relieved by 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division.

====Third Battle of Ypres====
The division concentrated south east of Amiens on 1 July for rest and retraining. The artillery marched to the Ypres salient over the first two weeks of July, here the two brigades rejoined the 93rd (Army) artillery brigade in the XIV Corps artillery group and covered the corps front between the Ypres-Pilckem road and the canal in the north of the salient, where 20th division had been in 1916. The gun batteries and ammunition column suffered casualties from German counter battery fire. The rest of the division arrived on 20 July and went into the XIV corps area as a reserve. On 25 July 10th and 11th K.R.R.C. and 10th R.B. were detached to 38th (Welsh) Division as carrying parties and the 59th and 217th machine gun companies were also sent forward.

On 30 and 31 July the 59th Brigade, 83rd engineer company and the 11th D.L.I. went forward to positions west and south of Elverdinghe, some west of the front line and the artillery fired fixed and rolling barrages for the advance of the Guards and 38th divisions during the Battle of Pilckem Ridge. The subsequent advance of the artillery to the Yers canal was made difficult by the rain that fell from the afternoon of 31 July to 3 August. On 6 August the division relieved the 38th (Welsh), with the 61st brigade in the front along of the Steenbeek with its left on the railway line.

=====Battle of Langemarck=====
On 7 August the 59th brigade was tasked with establishing a series of post of the eastern bank of the Steenbeek, as the 11th (Northern) Division to the right and the 29th Division to the left had already done. This was complicated on the 20th Division front by the marshy nature of the ground on both sides of the stream and a German strong point at Au Bon Gite, east of the stream on the Langemarck road. Initial attempts by two companies of the 11th K.R.R.C. made on 8 August failed, as did another with two companies of the 10th K.R.R.C. given artillery support on 11 August, a third attack on 14 August by six companies of 10th and 11th R.B. reached the Au Bon Gite pillboxes, but could not take the largest of them and were forced back by a counterattack with heavy casualties of over 210 officers and men. A fourth attempt on 15 August was cancelled and the ground gained was deemed sufficient for forming up for the forthcoming attack.

The larger operation, a phase of the Third battle of Ypres, was to begin on 16 August, with 60th and 61st brigades attacking north-east towards, around and past Langemarck, after the previous weeks losses 59th brigade, as division reserve, was reinforced with two battalions, 10th and 15th battalions, the Welch Regiment, from 38th (Welsh) Division. The 83rd and 84th engineer companies placed wooden bridges across the Steenbeek to allow the initial assaulting troops to form up on the east bank, and in spite of having to form up in some places within of German posts in front of the Au Bon Gite strong point, the build up on the east bank was achieved without the Germans being aware of the movement even while it was conducted through the &#x27;usual&#x27; harassing, but undirected, artillery and machine gun fire. The three phase lines were a road through the west of Langmarck, the second a line east of the village and the third on a road junction about from the Steenbeek.

The 60th brigade would attack on the right on a one battalion front, through the village, the 61st, on the left, on a two battalion front along the railway line. The 61st brigade front would widen, and the 60th brigades front veer northward after Langemarck, widening the division&#x27;s front to at the last phase line. In 60th brigade the 6th Ox and Bucks were to take the first two phase lines then the 12th K.R.R.C. and the 6th K.L.S.I. advance to the last, screening the German reserve known to be in Poelkapelle. On the 61st brigade front two companies each of the 7th K.O.Y.L.I. and the 7th S.L.I. were each allotted to the first and second phase lines, 12th King&#x27;s and 7th D.C.L.I. taking the third. Sections of the brigade machine gun companies and trench mortar batteries would also accompany the assault. For the remaining hard points at Au Bon Gite, a company of the 11th R.B., familiar with the area, and a party of the 83rd engineer company would advance with the Oxfords to reduce and mask them while the rest the advance continued. The 29th Division were to the left and the 11th (Northern) Division on the right

The artillery barrage and infantry advance began at 04:45 hours, with the assault on the Au Bon Gite blockhouse starting at the same time from the 11th R.B. who had crawled up within a few yards of the position. It was soon captured, but only after being able to fire at the 61st brigade advance in enfilade. The most severe hold up was due to the condition of the ground, which was &#x27;...nothing more than a swampy crater field as far as the final objective&#x27;, and particularly bad up to the first objective. The first wave of the 6th Ox and Bucks gained the first line at 05:20 with few losses. On the 61st brigade front the 7th K.O.Y.L.I. were fired on from blockhouses in Langemarck and at Langemarck railway station causing heavy losses to the officers, here Private Wilfred Edwards won the Victoria Cross attacking one of the blockhouses, and the first line on this brigade front was reached at 05:40. The advance to the second line began at 05:45, and the second wave of the 6th Ox and Bucks reach the second line soon after. Behind them the 6th K.S.L.I and 12th K.R.R.C., mopping up in the village, came under fire from another blockhouse. Crossing of open ground Sergeant Edward Cooper subdued the position capturing 46 prisoners and seven machine guns, winning the second Victoria Cross of the day in the division. These two battalions then formed up on the second line. On the left in 61st brigade, the K.O.Y.L.I. was left with only one officer as a company commander, the others being led by sergeants. The 12th King&#x27;s and 7th D.C.L.I. which had suffered casualties in the mopping up, now formed up in the second line. The advance to the third line began at 07:20 and by 07:45 the 60th brigade reached the final line after opposition from its right flank and the 61st brigade reached the line at 08:00. The division was in contact with both flanking divisions on the final objective, and had taken around 400 prisoners, including a battalion commander, a section of howizers, a 77mm field gun and around 25 machine guns.

A division stretcher bearer party, some 200 men strong, was created for the battle and tasked with clearing the battlefield of wounded. They worked throughout the day and night, and were regarded as an unqualified success.

The Germans counter-attacked at 16:00 at the junction of the brigades and drove back the 12th K.R.R.C. and 12th King&#x27;s , with one company of the 12th K.R.R.C. being almost wiped out. The next day an attempt to retake the ground partly succeeded, the mixed force of 12th King&#x27;s, 7th S.L.I. and a company of 7th D.C.L.I. retaking the line on the right, but the attack of the 12th R.B. was defeated by enfilade fire. That night the division was relieved by the 38th (Welsh) Division, except for the artillery which remained under orders of the Welsh.

======Eagle Trench======
After three weeks out of the line the division returned to the front on 5 September north-east of Langemarck. However, having had no reinforcement, it was under strength after the Langemarck battles with an average battalion strength of only 350 rifles. Relieving the 38th (Welsh) Division, an attack on the trench line opposite Poelkapelle was scheduled for 20 September. Preceded by a &quot;hurricane&quot; bombardment, the 59th brigade on the left and the 60th brigade on the right attacked that morning with the left flank reaching its objective, the right flank was held up by fire from strong points and the centre (the inner flanks of both brigades) making no progress due to fire from Eagle Trench, which was later discovered to be well sited between two embankments, and had an excellent field of fire. The attack was repeated that evening, with the artillery using smoke which was only partly successful, the 11th R.B. gaining a foothold in the trench but at a cost of two thirds of its men and 11 out of 16 officers. The 60th brigade gained further ground on the right. A follow-on attack was planned for 22 September with the aid of two tanks, but these became stuck in Langemarck, and the attack was re-planned for the next day without them. A German counterattack on the 60th brigade, 35 minutes before the planned attack was beaten off, and the attack began at 07:00. With trench mortars bombarding the trench, and both brigades working their way to the centre of the trench from the ends they held using bombing parties (grenade throwers), the 12th K.R.R.C. from the south, 10th R.B. from the north and frontally from the west. A total of 158 prisoners were taken and a number of machine guns captured. The attack earned praise from the Army Commander, General Sir Hubert Gough. Until the division was relieved at the end of the month the pioneers and engineers laboured to establish and strengthen communications to the front line through Langemarck.

The artillery remained in the salient and assisted in attacks that captured Poelcapelle and conducted a difficult relocation across the muddy ground. By the time the artillery was relieved on 18 October they had been in action for three months without relief.

====Cambrai====
On 1 October the division (less the artillery) entrained for Bapaume, and by 10 October had relieved the 40th Division with all three brigades in the line from Villers Plouich to Villers Guislains about north to south-east of Gouzeaucourt. The 11th D.L.I. (pioneers) was ordered to send 200 men to strengthen the infantry after the Ypres battles, and received lower fitness men in return. Now part of III Corps of the Third Army, the division had a quiet time in the line and was rejoined by its artillery on 25 October. On 29 October the division line was shortened when the 55th (West Lancashire) Division took over the southern third of the line around Villers Guislains. Brigade commanders and staffs were informed of the plan of attack early in November, other brigade officers only a week before the attack.

During their time in the line, those battalions rotated out of the line were trained in infantry-tank cooperation, the artillery was moved to new positions in the open closer to the line during the nights of 16–19 November. In the weeks preceding the attack, the Division Signals Company was detailed to provide the telephone and signal lines of three attacking divisions, laying of armoured cable. On 19 November the 60th and 61st brigade entered the new division line from Villers Plouich, south-east to a point north west of Gonnelieu facing &#x27;Welsh Ridge&#x27;, with the outposts of the old line still manned by the 20th division. The 59th Brigade was in reserve at Gouzeaucourt. In spite of the noise the tanks made moving up to the line the Germans did not respond. 

The plan called for the 60th brigade, supported by 24 tanks of &#x27;A&#x27; battalion and 61st brigade, supported by 36 tanks of &#x27;I&#x27; battalion, to advance behind a standing barrage launched at the same time as the infantry advance. This advance was to be made between the line of the Villers Plouich – Marcoing railway and a line to southeast, in a north-easterly direction astride Welsh Ridge and the valley to the south east of it. The 60th Brigade (on the left) with the 12th K.R.R.C. (left) and 6th Ox and Bucks L.I. (right) in the lead, and 61st Brigade (on the right), with the 7th D.C.L.I. (left) and 7th S.L.I. (right) in the lead, were to advance to a line some from the start line. The second objective line with the remaining battalions in the advance was around another ahead, on a line containing the whole of Welsh Ridge, whereupon the 59th Brigade and the 29th Division would pass through the 20th Division to a line north of Marcoing and Masnières over the Canal du Nord. The 12th Division was to the right and the 6th Division to the left.

The first wave of tanks advanced at 06:10 hrs on the morning of 20 November with the artillery barrage, provided by six artillery brigades, including the division&#x27;s 91st artillery brigade, beginning at 06:20, opposition was comparatively light, with only the 12th King&#x27;s and 12th K.R.R.C. encountering delaying opposition, Rifleman A E Shepherd (12th K.R.R.C.) winning the V.C. at one of the strongpoints encountered. Large numbers of Germans, overwhelmed by the tanks, surrendered or ran away. 
The first line was occupied by 09:25. The advance to the second line was more vigorously contested by the Germans in The Hindenburg Line support trenches, with the 7th K.O.Y.L.I. and 12th R.B. suffering heavy casualties reducing strong points on their respective brigade fronts. However the final objectives were reached by 11:00 hrs. The 59th Brigade led by the 10th and 11th R.B. and a number of troops of the 1/1st Northumberland Yeomanry, having left the start line at 09:10 hrs, passed along the valley south east of Welsh Ridge, and passed through the lines established by the 60th and 61st Brigades. The 10th R.B advancing towards the canal between Marcoing and Les Rues Vertes, and the 10th R.B. towards a line running south of Les Rues Vertes. Outflanking a strong point south of Marcoing, a company of the 11th R.B. forced a bridgehead across the canal and men of the 29th Division began to cross, C company occupied the village of Les Rues Vertes up to the canal after some street fighting. In Les Rues Vertes, facing Masnières across the main bridge, the 11th R.B were held up by firing from the opposite bank. After the arrival of three tanks, the first of which broke down, the others succeeded in silencing the fire using their 6-pounder guns, Intending to transport a bombing party of the 11th R.B. across the canal, the tank (Flying Fox) collapsed the bridge.

The 91st artillery brigade had moved off from its positions at 10:30 that morning, and despite broken down tanks on the road it was using, was in action that afternoon some in front of the old front line. By nightfall the 59th Brigade were established along approximately of the line of the canal from Les Rues Vertes east, with one company of the 10th R.B. in the village of Les Rues des Vignes just west of the canal. The K.R.R.C. battalions were stationed in a line south of Les Rue Vertes, and the 60th and 61st brigades were consolidating their positions on the north-eastern end of Welsh Ridge. A night attack by the 11th R.B. to take the canal crossings at Crèvecœur was repulsed. During the day the division had taken over 760 prisoners.

The next day a planned attack by the 59th Brigade, with the 29th Division on its left, and the assistance of 12 tanks, on the canal line gained a little ground around the village of Les Rues Vignes, but caused the 11th K.R.R.C. many casualties after the 29th Division&#x27;s attack was cancelled and the tanks ran out of petrol. Over the next few days as the struggle for Bourlon Wood was taking place the division consolidated its line which ran from the 12th Division&#x27;s left flank at Lateau Wood, approximately south of les Rues Vert on the canal and east of the start line on Welsh Ridge, north-east along the top of a spur for then north for to the canal. In front of this was an outpost line. The 7th S.L.I. was attached to the 88th Brigade of 29th Division between 21 and 24 November and cleared snipers from Masnières. By 30 November the line was held by the 59th Brigade on the right (10th and 11th K.R.R.C. in front), just returned from seven days in reserve, and the 61st Brigade on the left (12th King&#x27;s and 7th S.L.I. in the front). The reserve battalions were in the valley south east of Welsh Ridge. None of the battalions had more than 400 men and some had less than 300. The division&#x27;s artillery brigades were at the head of the valley south west of Welsh Ridge approximately north of Gonnelieu.

=====German counter-attack=====

The relief of the 60th brigade headquarters had not been completed when the Germans began their counter-attack. After attacking the 12th and 55th Divisions on the right (south) flank at 07:00 hrs, the division was shelled with smoke, mustard gas and high explosive half an hour later. Aided by a thick mist in the valleys and by air support elsewhere, the Germans attacked the 20th Division&#x27;s front and overwhelmed the outposts, some of which were in any case out of sight of the main line due to the convex slope of the spur north west of the canal. As the attack reached the main line the Germans also appeared on the division&#x27;s right rear flank, having passed through the 12th Division&#x27;s lines. With communications cut the reserve battalions had no sooner heard of the attack than they were subject to it, the headquarters and two companies of the 10th R.B. being overrun in this manner. The divisional and brigade machine gun companies also lost many of their guns and men, only a few men of the 217th MG company, north of Lateau Wood, escaping from the assault. The 83rd and 84th engineer companies were also swept up in the fighting, with the commanding officer of the 84th company assuming command of the 61st Brigade when its senior officers were killed. Two companies of the pioneers (11th D.L.I.) were in action at the northern end of Welsh Ridge the other two behind Gouzeaucourt. The remains of the two brigades fell back onto the slopes of Welsh Ridge. The division&#x27;s artillery was also directly attacked, after the infantry had retreated through the 92nd Brigade&#x27;s position, the artillery was firing at Point-blank range before being overrun. Later in the day the 11th R.B., accompanied by some of the artillerymen retook the position and were able to remove the breeches of the guns, before pulling back.

By the evening the division&#x27;s line ran from Gouzeaucourt to Gonnelieu then along the east and north east slopes of Welsh Ridge. To reinforce the division the 2/6th Battalion Sherwood Foresters and 1st Battalion The Buffs from the 6th Division were sent to the 59th and 60th brigades respectively. That night, the 91st artillery brigade was withdrawn from its forward position some to Beaucamps.

The next day (1 December) the Germans directed their attacks on the 59th and 60th brigades in the middle and southern part of the line, at one point the three forward companies of the 12th R.B. had only one uninjured officer among them, and the 12th K.R.R.C. also suffered heavily. The next day, 60th Brigade was relieved by 183rd Brigade of the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division, and it repulsed three attacks, with the Rifle Brigade battalions of 59th Brigade also suffering losses during the fighting. On the night of 2–3 December the 59th and 61st brigades were relieved by the rest of the 61st Division, and the division HQ was set up in Sorel south west of Gouzeaucourt. The 91st Artillery Brigade remained in action on the Cambrai front for a further two weeks as the British withdrew to the defensible Flesquieres line.

After a few days in Corps reserve, the division was moved north joining the Fourth Army and by 12 December was concentrated about south west of Ypres. The artillery rejoined the division on 24 December.

===1918===
On 7 January the division relieved the 30th Division in the IX Corps area, astride the Menin Road, just north west of Gheluvelt. The 60th Brigade was on the left, the 61st on the right, with the New Zealand Division to the left and the 37th Division to the right. The division&#x27;s time here was relativity quiet, aside from the usual patrolling in &#x27;no-man&#x27;s land&#x27; and an artillery and trench mortar demonstration for a trench raid by the 37th Division o the night of 9–10 January. A reprisal trench raid early on 10 January was beaten back by the 6th K.S.L.I.. The main problems were caused by the weather, which was either freezing, or wet, which made the regular relief of the front line, every 48 or 24 hours difficult.

At the end of January the division was transferred to XXII Corps, which had taken over the sector. In early February the division was reorganised into a three battalion per brigade structure, caused by manpower shortages, some political in origin. The 10th K.R.R.C. and 10th R.B. were disbanded, with the opportunity taken to reinforce the other battalions of those regiments in the division. The 6th Ox &amp; Bucks was also disbanded and the 7th K.O.Y.L.I. became the 14th Entrenching Battalion. Replacing the two battalions lost from the 59th Brigade was the 2nd Battalion Cameronians (Scottish Rifles), at full strength of over 1000 rifles transferring from the 8th Division. The division&#x27;s trench mortar batteries were reduced, with the heavy battery, V/20, transferring to XXII Corps and the medium Z/20 battery being broken up and distributed to the X/20 and Y/20 batteries. The artillery brigades were strengthened after the losses of the Cambrai battles. The division was relieved by 37th Division on 19 February, and was moved south to the Somme.

====Spring Offensive====

It was known that the Germans would mount an offensive with troops freed from the Eastern Front. On 23 February the division arrived in the Fifth Army as G.H.Q. reserve, attached to XVIII Corps and was billeted in the area of Ham about south west of the front line at Saint-Quentin. Here the division prepared defences behind the anticipated battle zone. On 10 March the division was placed on 12 hours notice to move, on 20 March this was reduced to one hour, and 05:00 hrs on 21 March it was ordered to man its battle stations.

=====The Somme 1918=====

The plan was for the division to support the font line between the river Somme and its tributary the Omignon some east of Saint Quentin, with the artillery being sent to support the 36th (Welsh) (92nd brigade), and 30th Divisions (91st brigade), north and south of the division respectively. The division was ordered to move at 13:00 hrs. By 15:00 hrs the brigades were deployed; 59th Brigade on the left (north) between the Omignon and the village of Vaux-en-Vermandos to the south east, 60th Brigade (reinforced with three companies of the 11th D.L.I.), in the centre between Vaux-en-Vermandos and the Somme to the south and the 61st Brigade astride the Somme between the villages of Tugney-en-Pont and Saint-Simon, to the south east.

During the night of 21 March the 36th Division was forced to retire south of the Somme with the 61st Brigade and 91st Artillery Brigade covering them, at which point they came under the orders of that division. During 22 March the 60th Brigade came under artillery attack, and the 59th Brigade was moved into a rear area due to the Corps to the north being out flanked. Further movements meant that by the evening of 22 March the 59th and 60th Brigades were acting as a rearguard for the corps between Lancy ( east of Saint Quentin), Douilly ( south of Lancy) and Bray-Saint-Christophe ( south east of Douilly). During the night the brigades were ordered to retire across the Somme, some to the south west, and conducted a fighting withdrawal as they did so. The engineer companies completed the destruction of the bridges across the canalised river. On 23 March the division held the Somme canal line from west of Ham, held by the 11th D.L.I. and parties men from other divisions, to Béthencourt-sur-Somme to the north west, held by the 11th R.B. Reinforced by the 182nd Brigade, the 60th Brigade fought back the Germans breaking through at Ham, and later in the day the division received more reinforcements, exchanging the 182nd Brigade for the other brigades (183rd and 184th) from the 61st Division, and two batteries of a Canadian motor machine gun battalion. During the night of 23 March it became obvious from the noises they were making that the Germans were preparing to cross the canal at many points.

On 24 March the Somme was crossed and the division was attacked on both flanks and the centre, aided by German artillery, trench mortaring and aircraft. Counter-attacks temporarily held up the German advance, but at a heavy cost, the 11th R.B. losing two companies almost in their entirety and the 2nd Scottish Rifles, one. By mid-morning the right of the line from the Somme, behind the village of Canizy was being held by a platoon from the 83rd Field Company and an assortment of stragglers with an open right flank. By the afternoon the Germans had forced the 8th and 30th Divisions out of contact with the 20th Division and it was forced to fall back a further on a north east facing line between Mesnil-Saint-Nicaise and Buverchy on the Canal-du-nord away. The 183rd Brigade formed a northern flank, south of them were the mixed up troops of 59th brigade, and the 60th Brigade on the south flank. During the afternoon the division was reinforced by four companies of French troops from the French 22nd Division and a French machine gun company.

That night, the 59th Brigade on the north flank, now reinforced with the 25th Entrenching Battalion and the Divisional Reinforcement Battalion (formed a week before from details from all branches of the division) and a mixed batch of men from the 8th and 61st divisions, was forced back by a renewed German attack. By the next morning (25 March) the Germans were continually turning the division&#x27;s left (northern) flank, and by the afternoon only 62 officers and men of A company, 2nd Scottish Rifles escaped the Germans. On the 60th Brigade front the headquarters of the 12th K.R.R.C. was captured that evening, by which time the division was forming a new line to the rear. The 61st Brigade returned to the division, after a hard retreat, often out of contact with the 36th Division, and at one point holding a line long with two battalions. Including companies from the 11th D.L.I. and 20th MG Battalion, the brigade had been reduced to a strength of nine junior officers and 440 men, and was reformed into a four company composite battalion (headquarters, King&#x27;s, S.L.I. and D.C.L.I. companies). The 91st Artillery Brigade remained under orders of the French 9th Division.

The same day the division came under orders of the French 133rd Division and was ordered to withdraw to Roye, where the division&#x27;s headquarters had retired to, south west from the division line on 23 March, and then on to Le Quesnel a further north west. With the Germans only away to the north, the 61st Brigade composite battalion was tasked with forming the left flank between the villages of Gruny, Crémery and Laincourt. The Germans were already in Laincourt, as were French units and a confused night was had with British, French and Germans patrols challenging each other in their different languages. The 59th and 60th Brigades had withdrawn to Roye by midnight 25 March, and set out for Le Quesnel at 07:00 hrs on 26 March, by which time the composite battalion had been pushed back , during that day the D.C.L.I. company fought for nearly 12 hours at the village of Parville-le-Quesnoy, and withdrew with only two officers and nine men from an original 106 of all ranks.

On 27 March the division was holding a line east of Le Quesnel across the Roye-Amiens road behind the 30th Division, with 60th Brigade to the south, 59th Brigade in the centre and the 61st Brigade composite battalion to the north reinforced with the 678 officers and men of the 25th Entrenching Battalion. The 59th and 60th Brigade came under attack that day as the Germans pushed back the line and attempted to outflank the division to the south. Before dawn on 28 March the 59th and 61st Brigades were relieved by 401st regiment of the French 133rd Division. The relief of the 60th Brigade was interrupted by a heavy German attack affecting the 6th K.S.L.I., 12th R.B. and the 11th D.L.I., which included accurate artillery and machine gun fire. The brigade managed to extricate itself and by 15:00 hrs had rejoined the rest of the division near Demuin north west of Le Quesnel.

The division now came under order of XIX Corps, and became part of the corps hard pressed right flank. On 29 March it was deployed between the villages of Demuin and Mézières-en-Santerre, to the south east across the Roye-Amiens road. The 59th Brigade, now reduced to 770 men, held the south of the line and 61st Brigade composite battalion the north, 60th Brigade was in reserve. The 92nd Artillery Brigade rejoined the division. The Germans attacked at mid-day and forced the south flank, reinforcements from the much depleted 149th Brigade of 50th (Northumbrian) Division were received (1/4th, 1/5th and 1/6th Northumberland Fusiliers, themselves needing reinforcement from the 4th East Yorkshire Regiment, 5th D.L.I. and the 22nd Entrenching Battalion, of the 50th Division), the 60th Brigade was brought out of reserve, and the division was ordered to recapture Mézières, from which the French had been driven. The 60th Brigade attacked at 16:00 hrs and although men from the three weakened battalions involved (12th K.R.R.C., 12 R.B. and 11th D.L.I., the last only 140 strong) succeeded in reaching the far side of the village, a simultaneous attack by the Germans on Villers-aux-Érables ( to the east) left them with an open flank and they were forced to retire despite taking 50 prisoners and destroying a battery of German trench mortars. A counter-attack by the 149th Brigade restored the southern flank.

By the morning of 30 March the division and its reinforcements held the road from Demuin to Moreuil to the south west. This was held during that day with the help of troops from the 2nd Cavalry Division. The next day (31 March) the division was continually attacked and was forced back, despite counter-attacks by 59th and 149th brigades supported by the 92nd Artillery Brigade, by repeated out flanking moves, the 60th Brigade losing what was left of D company 12th K.R.R.C. in its entirety. A final counterattack by the remaining 120 men of 6th K.S.L.I. the remnants of 11th D.L.I. and cavalry troops succeeded in maintaining a bridgehead south of Dormant-sur-la-Luce over the river Luce south east of Amiens. On the night of 1 April the division, less the artillery, was withdrawn from the front.

The division&#x27;s artillery continued supporting British, French and Australian troops in the Somme area, and switched commands frequently, with batteries occasionally detached to other formations. Both of the division&#x27;s artillery brigades were in the same part of the line, near Villers-Bretonneux by 17 April although under different commands (58th (2/1st London) Division and 5th Australian Division respectively). They were to take part in the battle of Villers-Bretonneux coming under sustained bombardment and heavy gas attacks, with some of the gunners of 91st Artillery Brigade acting as infantry, and B and D batteries of the 92nd firing over open sights at times on 24 March. The 91st Artillery Brigade was relieved on 25 March, the 92nd on 27 March, in both brigades artillery and the supply columns suffered heavy losses.

====Lens====

The division was moved to near Abbeville, in order to rest and absorb replacements for its losses. The 61st Composite Battalion had been reduced to less than 100 men, and the other brigades were similarly weakened. On 17 April the division was moved to Villers-Châtel about north west of Arras, returning to XVIII Corps control, this time under First Army. It remained there training its replacements until the end of April. Between 1 and 3 May the division relieved the 3rd Canadian Division in the Lens-Avion sector, either side of the river Souchez, where the artillery rejoined it. The 24th Division was to the left, and from 7 May the 52nd (Lowland) Division on the right. The German defences were based along the embankment of a curving section of railway line, known as the &#x27;Bull Ring&#x27; in the southern part of the line, the flooding of the land adjacent to the river, which was overlooked by a slag heap occupied by the Germans in the centre, and the widespread building ruins of the area strengthened with barbed wire traps all along the division&#x27;s front. Beginning almost immediately the division began to patrol in &#x27;no-mans-land&#x27; and conduct trench raids. These raids had the aim of obtaining identification of the German units in the area so that a picture could be built up of German force movements during the other sequences of their Spring Offensive and later defensive moves. One such raid during the night of 23–4 July was conducted by whole companies from the 11th K.R.R.C. and 12th King&#x27;s, two platoons from the 7th D.C.L.I. and one platoon from the 7th S.L.I., also involved in many of these raids were engineers from the field companies carrying explosive charges sufficient to destroy the German&#x27;s dug-outs. These raids were closely supported by the artillery, trench mortars and machine gunners. The raids met with varying degrees of success, and both sides frequently used gas in this sector.

On 27 August the whole division moved to the right, entirely south of the river Souchez on a three brigade front, patrolling and trench raiding were continued. At the end of September the First Army was ordered to advance along with the rest of the front. The initial moves of this by the 20th Division were an attack on the lines south of Lens at Acheville carried out by the 7th D.C.L.I, which on the night of 27–28 September captured of the German front line trench and held it against a counter-attack the next day. On 2 October, seeing that the Germans were withdrawing to the Hindenburg Line, the division advanced on a front of six battalions from all three brigades (from the left: 7th D.C.L.I, 12th King&#x27;s, 12th K.R.R.C., 6th K.S.L.I., 2nd Scottish Rifles and 11th K.R.R.C., with the remainder in reserve). With the close support of the artillery, advances of up to were made across the &#x27;Bull Ring&#x27; and the village of Méricourt was entered, there Pte. James Towers of the 2nd Scottish Rifles won the V.C. after volunteering to take a message to a trapped patrol after five other messengers had been killed, he subsequently led the patrol to safety after dark. The Germans left many machine gun nests to slow the pursuit, which were slowly overrun. The division was relieved between 5 and 8 October by the 12th (Eastern) Division, except for the artillery which was sent to the Chérisy – Foutaine area south east of Arras.

====Hundred Days====

The division spent the rest of the month training around Monchy-Breton, and did not take part in the general advance through Flanders until early November. Then, the division and its artillery (under orders of the 19th (Western) Division) were both moved to the Cambrai area.

The artillery supported attacks by the 19th Division on 4 November, at Jenlain to the north west of Cambrai, at Roisin on 6 November, Bavay on 8 November, a further and further on respectively. The advance was not unhindered and both artillery brigades were shelled and machine gunned, the C battery of the 91st having an ammunition dump blown up. By 9 November the artillery was a further further on, some south of Mons, where it came under orders of the 24th Division.

The remainder of the division moved up behind the leading troops and by 9 November was in Bavay. On 7 November the division had been made responsible for feeding the civilians in the areas it held, it also set up soup kitchens for the refugees heading east before sending them on. On 10 November the 60th Brigade was placed under orders on 24th Division and relieved the 73rd and 74th Brigade on the front, east of the Mons-Maubeuge road north of Maubeuge. Here the 12th K.R.R.C. lost a Regimental Sergeant Major Rawson, who had landed with the division in France in 1915. The 12th K.R.R.C. and 12th R.B were at the front when the armistice came into effect.

In late November, the division was concentrated around Marieux, north west of Albert and began disbanding in January 1919.

During the war the division lost 35,470 mean killed, wounded and missing.

==Memorial==
== General Officer Commanding ==
==Battle insignia==
The practice of wearing battalion specific insignia (often called battle patches) in the B.E.F. began in mid 1915 with the arrival of units of Kitchener&#x27;s Armies and was widespread after the Somme Battles of 1916. The patches shown were adopted by the division during late 1917, and were designed to an overall divisional scheme of a simple shape for each brigade and a number of stripes below that indicating the seniority of the battalion (according to the regimental order of precedence).

<text>Campo de Marte Airport is the first airport built in São Paulo, Brazil, opened in 1929. It is named after Champ de Mars, in Paris, which in turn got its name from Campus Martius, in Rome.

The airport is operated by Pax Aeroportos.

==History==
Campo de Marte was the first airport built in São Paulo, officially opened on July 26, 1929.

The airport was bombarded during the 1932 Constitutionalist Revolution.

On 12 November 1933 a ceremony marking the start-up of scheduled flights of VASP took place at the airport. The first two routes linked Campo de Marte to São Carlos and São José do Rio Preto, and to Ribeirão Preto and Uberaba.

It handled all air operations in São Paulo until VASP opened Congonhas Airport in 1936. VASP considered it a necessary move because of unexpected growing demands, and to avoid a problem of constant flooding by the adjoining Tietê River, particularly the one that happened in 1929.

São Paulo Air Force Base was created on 22 May 1941 by Decree 3,302 at Campo de Marte Airport. On 26 January 1945 the base at Campo de Marte was decommissioned and transferred to its present location, then called Cumbica Farm at Guarulhos.

Presently it houses the São Paulo Flying club, founded in 1931, helicopters and general aviation services. It has limited night operations capability, usually reserved to helicopters.

The 4th command of the Brazilian Air Force is also located on the premises.

On 11 May 2007, Pope Benedict XVI canonized the first Brazilian-born saint, Frei Galvão, during a mass on the site.

An agreement to establish an aerospace museum at the airport was signed in 2017.

Previously operated by Infraero, on August 18, 2022 Pax Aeroportos controlled by XP Inc. won a 30-year concession to operate the airport.

==Airlines and destinations==

No scheduled flights operate at this airport.

==Accidents and incidents==

<text>The couter (also spelled &quot;cowter&quot;) is the defense for the elbow in a piece of plate armour. Initially just a curved piece of metal, as plate armor progressed the couter became an articulated joint. Couters were popular by the 1320s.

In fighting reenactment groups such as the Society for Creative Anachronism, a couter/cowter is often called an &quot;elbow cop&quot;.

<text>Carbon Leaf is a quintet from Richmond, Virginia, known for their alt-country, Celtic, and folk-infused indie rock. Though some of the band members have changed through the years, Carbon Leaf has been consistently creating and performing music since the early 1990s. The band currently consists of founding members Barry Privett, Carter Gravatt, and Terry Clark, as well as Jon Markel and Jesse Humphrey. Carbon Leaf is best known for the song &quot;Life Less Ordinary&quot;, which debuted in 2004 and reached #5 on Billboard&#x27;s Adult Alternative charts.

==History==
===1992–2004: The Constant Ivy Music years===

Carbon Leaf got their start at Randolph-Macon College in Virginia in 1992, practicing in an auditorium on campus. Their next step was playing backyard parties, mixers, fraternity, and sorority parties. Shortly after everyone graduated, they moved to Richmond, Virginia. From Richmond, they played the college circuit in Virginia and up the East Coast before moving on to clubs. Their style is not &quot;Brazilian Polka Metal&quot;, despite the joking claims of guitarist Carter Gravatt (B., David. 2002).

&quot;Meander&quot;, their first album, was released in 1995. The first songs Carbon Leaf wrote, including &quot;One Day&quot; and &quot;Country Monkee&quot;, are on the album.

&quot;Shadows in the Banquet Hall&quot;, released in 1997, includes &quot;Flood&quot;, &quot;Wolftrap and Fireflies&quot;, and &quot;Attica&#x27;s Flower Box Window&quot;. An award-winning video was made for &quot;Flood&quot;.

&quot;Ether~Electrified Porch Music&quot; (1999) is the first album with Jordan Medas as the bassist and contains &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;American Tale&quot;, and &quot;Blue Ridge Laughing&quot;. The band had sold over 10,000 copies of their first three independent CDs by late 1999, released on their own label, Constant Ivy Music.

&quot;Echo Echo&quot; was released in 2001 with &quot;The Boxer&quot; as the first track. In January 2002, Carbon Leaf won the first-ever American Music Awards Presents the Coca-Cola New Music Award for &quot;The Boxer&quot;. As part of winning they performed &quot;The Boxer&quot; live on the AMAs, becoming the first unsigned band to perform at the awards show. Following this appearance, &quot;The Boxer&quot; entered regular rotation on radio stations including Washington, DC&#x27;s DC101 (WWDC 101.1 FM). In May 2002, the band members gave up their day jobs in order to dedicate more time to the band and touring. The hidden bonus track &quot;Dear&quot; from their &quot;Echo Echo&quot; CD was originally written to play over the closing credits and on the soundtrack of the Kevin Hershberger civil war film &quot;Wicked Spring&quot;. Barry Privett also appeared in the film. In September 2002, Carbon Leaf won the Pontiac Vibe Summer Sound Off resulting in &quot;The Boxer&quot; being played in Pontiac Vibe commercials on MTV and VH1.

In January 2003, Carbon Leaf gave permission for fan-made recordings of their concerts to be included in the Live Music Archive, a part of the Internet Archive. Various concerts are available from 2000 to present in lossless formats SHN or FLAC and the lossy format VBR MP3, with the majority coming from the years 2002–2004. &quot;5 Alive!&quot;, Carbon Leaf&#x27;s first live album, was released in the summer of 2003. The album was recorded over five concerts during the autumn and winter of 2002 and its track list is assembled to match a concert playlist.

===2004–2010: The Vanguard Records years===
In Spring 2004, Carbon Leaf signed with Vanguard Records, part of the Welk Music Group and in July of that year released their album, &quot;Indian Summer&quot;. &quot;Life Less Ordinary&quot; rose to number 5 on the Adult Album Alternative charts and 29 on the Hot AC Charts. Carbon Leaf performed &quot;Life Less Ordinary&quot; on the November 30, 2004 episode of The Dr. Phil Show. &quot;What About Everything?&quot; rose to 25 on the AAA charts. &quot;Indian Summer&quot; has been ranked in the top 10 by KMTT in Seattle, and number 40 out of the Top 50 Albums of 2004 by WXPN in Philadelphia. The album was produced by John Morand and David Lowery. The video for &quot;Life Less Ordinary&quot; debuted on January 5, 2005.

In June 2006, an interview with Carbon Leaf guitarist Terry Clark was chosen as the cover feature for the inaugural issue of &quot;The Green Room&quot; magazine. On September 12, 2006, the band released &quot;Love, Loss, Hope, Repeat&quot;. According to their blog, it was recorded in Nashville, Tennessee, and mixed in collaboration with producer Peter Collins and Trina Shoemaker. The title track was featured in the October 30, 2006, episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;What About Brian&quot;. Tom McCormack began touring with Carbon Leaf, playing keys and accordion. The video for &quot;Learn to Fly&quot; featured Katy Perry as &quot;a besotted fan rushing to attend a Carbon Leaf performance&quot;.

Carbon Leaf played at Sudflood 2007, and dedicated their performance to the memory of the lives lost in the Virginia Tech shootings. All proceeds went towards the memorial fund for the victims and their families.

In August 2007, Scott Milstead was replaced by Jason Neal on drums. In August 2008, Jordan Medas left the band to pursue a teaching career. He was replaced in October 2008 by Jon Markel.

The band released their seventh studio album, &quot;Nothing Rhymes with Woman&quot;, on May 19, 2009. On June 30, 2009, Carbon Leaf was the featured band at Red Rocks&#x27; Film On The Rocks.

The producers of &quot;Curious George 2: Follow That Monkey!&quot; were using an acoustic version of &quot;Life Less Ordinary&quot; as a placeholder in the film. The request to license it snowballed into wanting to license additional songs and ultimately a request that Carbon Leaf do the majority of the soundtrack. Carbon Leaf contributed six songs to the soundtrack for the animated film, including versions of &quot;Life Less Ordinary&quot; and &quot;Let Your Troubles Roll By&quot; with new alternate lyrics (in the second verse) and &quot;The Friendship Song&quot;. The soundtrack and the direct-to-DVD movie were released on March 2, 2010.

Carbon Leaf has played with many acts, including Dave Matthews Band, Something Corporate, O.A.R., and David Gray, and has toured with Jason Mraz, Blues Traveler, Great Big Sea, Jump, Little Children, Matt Nathanson, Big Head Todd and the Monsters, The Avett Brothers, Guster, and Stephen Kellogg and the Sixers.

In January 2006, Carbon Leaf was one of the bands to join Sister Hazel&#x27;s floating Music festival The Rock Boat. They have also performed on The Rock Boat 2007, Ships &amp; Dip hosted by The Barenaked Ladies in 2008, The Rock Boat in 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2017.

===2010–present: Return to indie status===
In March 2010, the band announced that they were amicably parting ways with their label, Vanguard Records, intending to record and release music on their own schedule and distribute it over the internet. Their plan was to market their music by giving it away at shows, a strategy not compatible with Vanguard&#x27;s focus on CD sales. 

On July 6, 2010, they released &quot;How the West was One&quot;, inspired by and written during their tour of the American West, initially on their website and subsequently on iTunes and Amazon.com. Their ninth studio album and third of 2010, a collection of original Christmas- and winter-themed songs titled &quot;Christmas Child&quot;, was released on November 16. Barry Privett described the songs as &quot;encompassing
both the joy and melancholy of the season.&quot;

A second live album and DVD was recorded in January 2010 and released as a three-disc set in early 2011. &quot;Live, Acoustic...And In Cinemascope!&quot; was released on May 3, 2011.

In February 2013, the band released &quot;Ghost Dragon Attacks Castle&quot;.

Carbon Leaf launched a crowdfunding effort on in June 2013 to support their next studio album. Entitled &quot;Constellation Prize&quot;, the album was released digitally through their website and on CD.

On August 9, 2014, Carbon Leaf released &quot;Indian Summer Revisited&quot;, a tenth-anniversary re-recording of their 2004 album. As with their previous album, it was supported via a crowdfunding campaign on PledgeMusic. They repeated this tactic with their album Love, Loss, Hope, Repeat in 2015 and Nothing Rhymes with Woman in 2016. While the band does not own the master recordings from the 2004 album they do own the songs. Doing these remasters allowed the band to sell the albums independently.

In 2018, the band&#x27;s 25th anniversary year, Carbon Leaf released a five song album, &quot;Gathering: vol. 1&quot; which was their first release of new songs since 2013.

Carbon Leaf followed up with another five song EP titled &quot;Gathering Vol. 2: The Hunting Ground&quot; in September 2021.

In September 2024, Carbon Leaf released its first full new album in a decade, &quot;Time is the Playground&quot;.

<doc id="1310425" wikidata="Q510748" url="?curid=1310425" title="Jennifer Bassey">
<text>Jennifer Bassey (born July 22, 1939) is an American actress who has worked on both stage and screen. She is perhaps best known for her role as Marian Colby in the ABC soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot; which she played on and off from 1983 until the show&#x27;s cancellation in 2011.

==Life and career==
Bassey was born in Chicago, Illinois. After graduating from Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, Bassey moved back to the United States and took roles in several Off-Broadway plays. This led to further work in daytime soap operas.

After appearing in &quot;Love of Life&quot;, &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, and &quot;Somerset&quot;, Bassey changed her professional name from &quot;Joan Bassie&quot; to &quot;Jennifer Bassey.&quot; She chose the name Jennifer from Dr. Jennifer Stark, the role she had played on &quot;Love of Life&quot;. In the early 1990s, Bassey was one of several actresses brought in briefly to replace Eileen Fulton as Lisa on &quot;As the World Turns&quot; while Fulton was ill.

She began playing Marian Colby on ABC&#x27;s soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot; (1983-1987, 1989, 1995-2009, 2011). She has appeared on &quot;All My Children&quot; for over 20 years and was a favorite among fans. 

A libidinous wealthy widow with a penchant for forbidden romantic trysts, Marian was featured in a variety of storylines, allowing Bassey to showcase a variety of talents in both comedy and drama. In 1998, Bassey won the Soap Opera Digest Award for &quot;Favorite Scene Stealer,&quot; and in 1999, alongside co-star David Canary, won the same award for &quot;Favorite Couple&quot;. Also, in 1999, Bassey received her first Daytime Emmy nomination in the &quot;Outstanding Supporting Actress&quot; category. Bassey appeared on &quot;All My Children&quot; in both contract and recurring capacities until the show&#x27;s 2011 network cancellation, but did not appear on the show&#x27;s short-lived online incarnation.

Bassey did not participate in the February 2, 2017 &quot;All My Children&quot; reunion on the Hallmark Channel&#x27;s &quot;Home &amp; Family&quot; show. However, &quot;Home &amp; Family&quot; did utilize footage of Bassey with actor Michael E. Knight from an infamous &quot;All My Children&quot; storyline wherein Knight&#x27;s youthful Tad Martin had affairs with both Marian Colby and her daughter Liza (played by Marcy Walker).

Bassey also has appeared in a number of prime time television shows, include a recurring roles on &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; and &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, and well as guest shots on &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;, &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, &quot;Matlock&quot;, &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, and &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. Her film credits include &quot;Waxwork&quot; (1988), &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; (1990), &quot;Dunston Checks In&quot; (1996), and &quot;27 Dresses&quot; (2007).

<text>Structured finance is a sector of finance — specifically financial law — that manages leverage and risk. Strategies may involve legal and corporate restructuring, off balance sheet accounting, or the use of financial instruments.

Securitization provides $15.6 trillion in financing and funded more than 50% of U.S. household debt last year. Through securitization and structured finance, more families, individuals, and businesses have access to essential credit, seamlessly and at a lower price.

With more than 370 member institutions, the Structured Finance Association (SFA) is the leading trade association for the structured finance industry. SFA’s purpose is to help its members and public policymakers grow credit availability and the real economy in a responsible manner. 

ISDA conducted market surveys of its Primary Membership to provide a summary of the notional amount outstanding of interest rate, credit, and equity derivatives, until 2010. The ISDA Margin Survey is also conducted annually to examine the state of collateral use and management among derivatives dealers and end-users. End-User Surveys are also conducted to collect information on usage of privately negotiated derivatives.

==Structure==

===Securitization===


Structured finance utilizes securitization to pool assets, creating novel financial instruments to enable better use of available capital or serve as a cheaper source of funding, especially for lower-rated originators

Other uses include alternative funding (ture), reducing credit concentration and for risk transfer and risk management interest rates and liquidity.

===Tranching===

Tranching refers to the creation of different classes of securities (typically with different credit ratings) from the same pool of assets. It is an important concept, because it is the system used to create different investment classes for the securities. Tranching allows the cash flow from the underlying asset to be diverted to various investor groups. The Bank for International Settlements&#x27;s Committee on the Global Financial System explains tranching as follows: &quot;A key goal of the tranching process is to create at least one class of securities whose rating is higher than the average rating of the underlying collateral pool or to create rated securities from a pool of unrated assets. This is accomplished through the use of credit support (enhancement), such as prioritization of payments to the different tranches.&quot;

===Credit enhancement===

Credit enhancement is key in creating a security that has a higher rating than the underlying asset pool. Credit enhancement can be created, for example, by issuing subordinate bonds. The subordinate bonds are allocated any losses from the collateral before losses are allocated to the senior bonds, thus giving senior bonds a credit enhancement. As a result, it is possible for defaults to occur in repayment of the underlying assets without affecting payments to holders of the senior bonds. Also, many deals, typically those involving riskier collateral, such as subprime and Alt-A mortgages, use over-collateralization as well as subordination. In over-collateralization, the balance of the underlying assets (e.g., loans) is greater than the balance of the bonds, thus creating excess interest in the deal which acts as a &quot;cushion&quot; against reduction in value of the underlying assets. Excess interest can be used to offset collateral losses before losses are allocated to bondholders, thus providing another credit enhancement. A further credit enhancement involves the use of derivatives such as swap transactions, which effectively provide insurance, for a set fee, against a decrease in value.

Monoline insurers play a critical role in modern-day Credit Enhancements; they are more effective in (a) off-balance-sheet models creating synthetic collateral, (b) sovereign ratings&#x27; enhancement with built-in asset derivatives and (c) cross border loans with receivables and counterparties in the domain and jurisdiction of the monoline insurer. The decision whether to use a monoline insurer or not often depends upon the cost of such cover vis-a-vis the improvement in pricing for the loan or bond issue by virtue of such credit enhancement.

Ratings play an important role in structured finance for instruments that are meant to be sold to investors. Many mutual funds, governments, and private investors only buy instruments that have been rated by a known credit rating agency, like Moody&#x27;s, Fitch or S&amp;P Global Ratings. New rules in the U.S. and Europe have tightened the requirements for ratings agencies.

==Types==

There are several main types of structured finance instruments.

*Asset-backed securities are bonds or notes based on pools of assets or collateralized by the cash flows from a specific pool of underlying assets.
*Mortgage-backed securities are asset-backed securities, the cash flows from which are backed by the principal and interest payments of a set of mortgage loans. 
** Residential mortgage-backed securities deal with residential homes, usually single family. 
** Commercial mortgage-backed securities are for commercial real estate, such as malls or office complexes.
**Collateralized mortgage obligations are securitizations of mortgage-backed securities, typically involving multiple classes with differing levels of seniority.
*Collateralized debt obligations consolidate a group of fixed-income assets, such as high-yield debt or asset-backed securities, into a pool, which is then divided into various tranches. Many CDOs are collateralized by various types of mortgage-backed securities and other mortgage-related assets. An extension of these CDOs are &quot;synthetic&quot; CDOs which are collateralized by credit default swaps and other derivatives. 
**Collateralized bond obligations are collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by corporate bonds.
**Collateralized loan obligations are collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by bank loans.
**Commercial real estate collateralized debt obligations are collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by commercial real estate loans and bonds.
*Credit derivatives are contracts to transfer the risk of the total return on a credit asset falling below an agreed level, without transfer of the underlying asset.
*Collateralized fund obligations are securitizations of private equity and hedge fund assets.
*Insurance linked securities are risk transfer instruments linked to insurance losses due to catastrophic events, which are generally seen as uncorrelated to traditional financial markets.
*Partial guaranteed structures
*Future flow transactions
*Loan sell offs
*Revolving Credit Financing (property or traded goods)

<doc id="1310450" wikidata="Q16982674" url="?curid=1310450" title="New York City Police Department Highway Patrol">
<text>The Highway Patrol are specialized units part of the Highway District with the Transportation Bureau of the New York City Police Department. The Highway Patrol is primarily responsible for patrolling and maintaining traffic safety on limited-access highways within New York City. The Highway Patrol&#x27;s other duties and roles include accident investigations, advanced driver and radar/laser speed enforcement training for NYPD officers, field sobriety testing at the various testing locations in each Patrol Borough, dignitary and parade escorts, hazardous material and truck traffic enforcement, anti-drag racing programs, and anti-terrorist checkpoints at key bridges and intersections in the city.

== History ==
The Highway Patrol&#x27;s origins begin in 1911 with the formation of the NYPD&#x27;s first motorcycle squad, which was formed to meet the challenges of handling increasing traffic danger concomitant with the rise of automobile use. The unit—then simply known as the Motorcycle Squad—was enlarged as automobile traffic and speeding arose as major problems for the city, and in 1929, the unit was expanded to include armored motorcycles for use in anti-gang activities by the NYPD.

In 1933, the unit expanded to include a formally designated &quot;Grand Central Parkway Motorcycle Squad&quot; for patrol on a limited-access highway.

Until 1972, the unit remained primarily focused on the Motorcycle Squad, when in that year the motorcycle division was merged with the Accident Investigation Squad to officially form the Highway Patrol. The Highway Patrol patch was created, however, five years later in 1977.

== Organization ==
The Highway District is divided into four sub-units:

* Highway Unit #1 in The Bronx (covers Manhattan and the Bronx)
* Highway Unit #2 in Brooklyn
* Highway Unit #3 in Queens
* Highway Unit #5 in Staten Island

Highway Unit #4 in Midtown Manhattan disbanded in September 2010

Highway Patrol also includes:
*Collision Technician Group (CTG)
*Collision Investigation Squad (each highway unit has a squad)
*Highway District Specialized Training School (HDSTS)
*Intoxicated Driver Testing Unit (IDTU)
*Drug Recognition Experts (DREs)
*Motor Carrier Safety Unit (MCSU)

== Uniforms ==

In addition to the vehicular distinctions between the Highway Patrol and the general NYPD, there are differences in the uniforms as well. Aside from the Highway Patrol patch, Highway Patrol officers wear a uniform designed for both practical use and with traditional connections with motorcycle patrol duty in mind. In comparison with most NYPD officers&#x27; plain slacks or cargo pants, Highway Patrol members wear tapered motorcycle breeches with a 1-inch wide light blue braided stripe combined with a 1/2-inch wide reflective white stripe, as well as a &quot;crushed&quot;-style version of the NYPD&#x27;s eight-point cap or a two-toned motorcycle helmet. Motorcycle or riding boots are worn whether an officer is assigned to motorcycle duty or not, excepting those assigned to Highway Patrol Motor Carrier Safety Unit details; Highway Patrol Motor Carrier Safety Unit officers wear regular black work boots or low quarters, cargo pants, jumpsuit, and nylon jacket. The Highway unit is also one of only two units within the NYPD allowed to wear leather jackets, as these jackets are better able to prevent injuries from motorcycle crashes. Additional unique uniform features are the unit&#x27;s use of a Sam Browne belt and shoulder strap, braided leather sidearm lanyards, an “arrow shaped” collar bar clip and a specialized summons book pouch on their duty belt. In addition, instead of the standard regulation NYPD tie clip, many members wear a tie clip that has a miniaturized highway unit patch on it. The uniform and vehicle distinctions help give the Highway Patrol unit an elite look and prominent presence within the department.

The combination of the crushed cap, riding boots and the blue &quot;distinction lace&quot; on the Highway Patrol Uniform is in direct opposition to United States Army traditions; i.e., the uniforms worn by Highway Patrol are reminiscent of Cavalry, yet the blue is symbolic of Infantry. The color of the &quot;distinction lace&quot;—also known as &quot;piping&quot;—was switched from a black one inch band to the current blue piping under New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton&#x27;s first term, who initiated the change in order to emulate the Boston Police Department&#x27;s motor unit.

== Vehicles ==
The Highway Patrol vehicle fleet is primarily made up of Dodge Chargers equipped with Hemi engines and All Wheel Drive. There are also Ford Explorers, and Ford Taurus AWD Interceptors, in the vehicle fleet. The Motor Carrier Safety Unit utilizes Chevrolet Tahoe&#x27;s and Traverses. They are not termed as &quot;Police car cruisers&quot; but rather as &quot;Radio Motor Patrol units&quot;(RMPs). Highway Patrol vehicles differ from more typical NYPD vehicles in that they feature a larger and more complex moveable light bar on the roof called &quot;risers&quot;, which rise up into the air to promote greater visibility on highways and also to warn oncoming vehicles of the presence of danger or an obstruction. Highway Patrol RMPs are additionally equipped with Setina push bumpers to enable officers to push disabled vehicles off or out of a highway lane in order to smooth traffic flow. These vehicles also offer a much stronger engine compared to regular NYPD RMPs. A Highway Patrol RMP is also distinguished from other NYPD automobiles by its &quot;HWY&quot; designation on the rear of the car followed by its command unit number; additional Highway Patrol stenciling may also be present across the front and/or the rear windshield.

In addition to automobiles, the Highway Patrol continues to use motorcycles in its daily traffic duties; currently the Highway Patrol uses Harley-Davidson Road Kings, and these are most prominently used when escorting visiting national or foreign dignitaries to New York, or when opening many of the city&#x27;s parades.

== Auxiliary Police Highway Patrol Unit ==
The NYPD has a volunteer unit of the Highway Patrol Unit. This unit is called the New York City Police Department Auxiliary Police Highway Patrol Unit. The unit is made up of trained volunteer officers who assist the full-time Highway Patrol officers by patrolling the highways, parkways and main thoroughfares throughout the City of New York. The officers in this unit are equipped with handcuffs, a straight baton, whistle, flashlight, reflective traffic vest, and a police radio that is directly linked to the Central Dispatcher, other Auxiliary Police officers, and Highway Patrolman. These officers are unpaid, and receive no benefits for their work. The main jobs for these officers are to assist disabled vehicles and to aid in traffic control responsibilities at accident scenes. These officers do not carry a firearm, and they are &quot;never&quot; permitted to make traffic stops.

Auxiliary Highway Patrol officers wear the same uniforms as full-time Highway Patrol officers and patrol in marked Highway Patrol vehicles with AUXILIARY decals affixed to them. All applicants to this Auxiliary unit are required to have a minimum of five years experience as a patrol officer with the NYPD Auxiliary Police before they will be considered for the job. In addition they must be qualified to operate Highway Patrol vehicles (except motorcycles).

Auxiliary Police recruits must pass a 16-week &quot;Auxiliary Police Basic Training Course&quot; which is classified as &quot;Part Time Peace Officer Training&quot;. Auxiliary recruits are required by the New York State Municipal Police Training Council to undergo and pass this training course before they become Auxiliary Police officers. The training given in this course includes training in penal law, radio use, unarmed self-defense including the use of pressure points, self-defense with a nightstick, first aid, firearm safety, domestic violence, and arrest procedures. A written and physical exam is given at the end of training.

All Auxiliary Police officers are required by New York State to pass an annual refresher course in the use of force with the nightstick, arrest procedures, and Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO).

Auxiliary Police officers are neither Police Officers nor Peace Officers (except during an emergency under 2.20 Criminal Procedure Law)

== Strength ==
At present, there are approximately 180 full-time uniformed members of the service and ~20 Auxiliary Police officers within the Highway Patrol, ranging from Auxiliary Police Officer to Auxiliary Inspector. As with the NYPD as a whole, the number of officers within the unit fluctuates according to budgetary and political changes. Full-time officers must volunteer, be selected to join the Highway Patrol Unit, and usually must have between five and ten years of commendable experience as a patrol officer in order to qualify for a position. Auxiliary Police officers must have five years of commendable experience as a patrol officer in the NYPD Auxiliary Police then may apply to transfer to the highway unit. In many ways, the elite status of this unit and its traditions are similar to that of the NYPD Mounted Unit.

==Similar units==
The NYPD Highway Patrol occupies an unusual position as a municipality-based limited-access Highway Patrol and specialized task unit in the United States. Only a few other cities feature a similarly elite unit, most notably Philadelphia and its Philadelphia Highway Patrol and Boston and its Boston Police Special Operations Unit.

The nearby county of Nassau on Long Island also has a highway patrol unit within its County Police Department for patrol work on expressways in Nassau County. Suffolk County disbanded its highway patrol unit on September 15, 2008 and the highway patrol duties transferred to the Suffolk County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. The police highway unit was recently reformed, however, and has resumed its former duties in Suffolk County.

<doc id="1310454" wikidata="Q56240" url="?curid=1310454" title="Tunisian Arabic">
<text>Tunisian Arabic, or simply Tunisian (), is a variety of Arabic spoken in Tunisia. It is known among its 12 million speakers as &quot;Tūnsi&quot;, &quot;Tunisian&quot; or &quot;Derja&quot; (; meaning &quot;common or everyday dialect&quot;) to distinguish it from Modern Standard Arabic, the official language of Tunisia. Tunisian Arabic is mostly similar to eastern Algerian Arabic and western Libyan Arabic.

As part of the Maghrebi Arabic dialect continuum, Tunisian merges into Algerian Arabic and Libyan Arabic at the borders of the country. Like other Maghrebi dialects, it has a vocabulary that is predominantly Semitic and Arabic with a Berber, Latin and possibly Neo-Punic substratum. Tunisian Arabic contains Berber loanwords which represent 8% to 9% of its vocabulary. However, Tunisian has also loanwords from French, Turkish, Italian and the languages of Spain and a little bit of Persian.

Multilingualism within Tunisia and in the Tunisian diaspora makes it common for Tunisians to code-switch, mixing Tunisian with French, English, Italian, Standard Arabic or other languages in daily speech. Within some circles, Tunisian Arabic has thereby integrated new French and English words, notably in technical fields, or has replaced old French and Italian loans with standard Arabic words. Moreover, code-switching between Tunisian Arabic and modern standard Arabic is mainly done by more educated and upper-class people and has not negatively affected the use of more recent French and English loanwords in Tunisian.

Tunisian Arabic is also closely related to Maltese, which is a separate language that descended from Tunisian and Siculo-Arabic. Maltese and Tunisian Arabic have about 30 to 40 per cent spoken mutual intelligibility.

==Classification==
Tunisian Arabic is one of the Arabic languages within the Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family. It is a variety of Maghrebi Arabic like Moroccan and Algerian Arabic, which are mostly unintelligible to Modern Standard or Mashriqi Arabic speakers. It has a considerable number of pre-hilalian dialects but is usually considered in its koiné form to be a mostly Hilalian variety of Maghrebi Arabic because it was affected by the immigration of Banu Hilal in the 11th century, as were the other Maghrebi varieties.

As a part of the Arabic dialect continuum, it is reported that Tunisian Arabic is partly mutually intelligible with Algerian Arabic, Libyan Arabic, Moroccan, and Maltese. However, it is only slightly intelligible, if at all, with Egyptian, Levantine, Mesopotamian, or Gulf Arabic.

==History==

===Beginnings of the dialect===
====Linguistic situation of Ancient Tunisia====

During classical antiquity, Tunisia&#x27;s population spoke Berber languages related to the Numidian language. However, the languages progressively lost their function as main languages of Tunisia since the 12th century BC, and their usage became restricted mainly to the western regions of the country until their disappearance or evolution into other languages.

Indeed, migrants from Phoenicia settled Tunisia during the 12th to the 2nd century BC, founded ancient Carthage and progressively mixed with the local population. The migrants brought with them their culture and language that progressively spread from Tunisia&#x27;s coastal areas to the rest of the coastal areas of Northwest Africa, the Iberian Peninsula and the Mediterranean islands. From the eighth century BC, most of Tunisia&#x27;s inhabitants spoke the Punic language, a variant of the Phoenician language influenced by the local Numidian language. Also, already at that time, in the regions near to Punic settlements, the Berber that was used evolved considerably. In the urban centers such as Dougga, Bulla Regia, Thuburnica or Chemtou, Berber lost its Maghrebi phonology but kept the essential of its vocabulary. The word &quot;Africa&quot;, which gave its name to the continent, possibly is derived from the name of the Berber tribe of the Afri that was one of the first to enter in contact with Carthage. Also during this period and up to the third century BC, the Tifinagh alphabet developed from the Phoenician alphabet.

After the arrival of Romans, following the fall of Carthage in 146 BC, the coastal population spoke mainly Punic, but that influence decreased away from the coast. From Roman period until the Arab conquest, Latin, Greek and Numidian further influenced the language, called Neo-Punic to differentiate it from its older version. This also progressively gave birth to African Romance, a Latin dialect, influenced by Tunisia&#x27;s other languages and used along with them. Also, as it was the case for the other dialects, Punic probably survived the Arabic conquest of the Maghreb: the geographer al-Bakri described in the 11th century people speaking a language that was not Berber, Latin or Coptic in rural Ifriqiya, a region where spoken Punic survived well past its written use. However, it may be that the existence of Punic facilitated the spread of Arabic in the region, as Punic and Arabic are both Semitic languages and share many common roots.

====Middle Ages====

Classical Arabic began to be installed as a governmental and administrative language in Tunisia that was called then &quot;Ifriqiya&quot; from its older name &quot;Africa&quot; during the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb in 673. The people of several urban cities were progressively influenced by Arabic. By the 11th century, through contact of local languages such as African Romance or Berber with Classical Arabic, some urban dialects appeared in the main coastal cities of Tunisia. The dialects were slightly and characteristically influenced by several common Berber structures and vocabulary like negation because Tamazight was the language of contact for citizens of that period. The new dialects were also significantly influenced by other historical languages.

Many Tunisian and Maghrebi words, like (&quot;octopus&quot;), have a Latin etymology. The dialects were later called Pre-Hilalian Arabic dialects and were used along Classical Arabic for communication in Tunisia. Also, Siculo-Arabic was spoken in several islands near Tunisia like Sicily, Pantelleria, and Malta and entered into contact with the Tunisian pre-hilalian dialects. Consequently, it ameliorated the divergence in grammar and structures of all the concerned dialects from Classical Arabic.

By the mid-11th century, the Banu Hilal immigrated to rural northern and central Tunisia and Banu Sulaym immigrated to southern Tunisia. The immigrants played a major role in spreading the use of Tunisian Arabic in an important part of the country. However, they brought some of the characteristics of their local Arabic dialects as well. In fact, central and western Tunisian Arabic speakers began using the voiced velar stop [ɡ] instead of the voiceless uvular stop [q] in words such as &quot;he said&quot;. Main linguists working about Hilalian dialects like Veronika Ritt-Benmimoum and Martine Vanhove supposed that even the replacement of the diphthongs /aw/ and /aj/ respectively by /uː/ and /iː/ vowels was a Hilalian influence. Furthermore, the phonologies brought to the new towns speaking Tunisian Arabic are those of the immigrants and not Tunisian phonology. The Sulaym even spread a new dialect in southern Tunisia, Libyan Arabic.

However, some dialects avoided the Hilalian influence: Judeo-Tunisian Arabic, a vernacular spoken by Tunisian Jews and known for the conservation of foreign phonemes in loanwords and slightly influenced by Hebrew phonology, Sfax dialect and Tunisian urban woman dialect.

By the 15th century, after the Reconquista and subsequent decline of the formerly Arabic-speaking al-Andalus, many Andalusians immigrated to the Tunisian main coastal cities. These migrants brought some of the characteristics of Andalusian Arabic to the sedentary urban dialects spoken in Tunisia. Among others, it led to the reuse of the voiceless uvular stop [q] instead of the nomadic Hilalian voiced velar stop [ɡ] and to speech simplification in Tunisian, which further differentiated the language from Classical Arabic. Furthermore, the changes were recognized by the Hafsid scholar ibn Khaldun in his &quot;Muqaddimah&quot; in 1377. He said that language contact between classical Arabic and local languages caused the creation of many Arabic varieties very distinct from formal Arabic.

===Ottoman period===

During the 17th to the 19th centuries, Tunisia came under Spanish, then Ottoman rule and hosted Morisco then Italian immigrants from 1609. That made Tunisian, Spanish, Italian, Mediterranean Lingua Franca, and Turkish languages connected. Tunisian acquired several new loanwords from Italian, Spanish, and Turkish and even some structures like the suffix added to several nouns to mean professions like , ... During the mid-19th century, Tunisian Arabic was studied by several European scientists. In 1893, a first linguistic study was completed by the German linguist Hans Stumme. That began a still ongoing research trend on Tunisian Arabic.

===Modern history===

During the French protectorate of Tunisia, the country encountered the Standard French language. That affected Tunisian considerably, as new loanwords, meanings and structures were drawn from French. The unintelligibility of Tunisian to Middle Eastern Arabic speakers was worsened.

However, the same period was characterized by the rise of interest toward Tunisian Arabic. Indeed, this period was the beginning of the spread of the formal use of Tunisian Arabic as by Taht Essour. Also, more research about Tunisian was produced, mainly by French and German linguists. Tunisian Arabic became even taught in French high schools, as an optional language.

By the Tunisian independence in 1956, Tunisian Arabic was spoken only in coastal Tunisia while the other regions spoke Algerian Arabic, Libyan Arabic or several Berber dialects. The profusion is from many factors including the length of time the country was inhabited, its long history as a migration land and the profusion of cultures that have inhabited it, and the geographical length and diversification of the country, divided between mountain, forest, plain, coastal, island and desert areas.

That is why Tunisian leader Habib Bourguiba began a trial of Arabization and Tunisification of Tunisia and spread free basic education for all Tunisians. That contributed to the progressive and partial minimisation of code-switching from European languages in Tunisian and the use of code-switching from Standard Arabic. Furthermore, the creation of the Établissement de la radiodiffusion-télévision tunisienne in 1966 and the nationwide spread of television with the contact of dialects led to a dialect leveling by the 1980s.

By then, Tunisian Arabic reached nationwide usage and became composed of six slightly different but fully mutually intelligible dialects: Tunis dialect, considered the reference Tunisian dialect; Sahil dialect; Sfax dialect; southwestern dialect; southeastern dialect and northwestern dialect. Older dialects became less commonly used and began disappearing. Consequently, Tunisian became the main prestigious language of communication and interaction within the Tunisian community and Tunisia became the most linguistically homogeneous state of the Maghreb. However, Berber dialects, Libyan and Algerian Arabic as well as several Tunisian dialects like the traditional urban woman dialect, Judeo-Tunisian Arabic or even several Tunisian structures like &quot;lā&quot; noun&quot;+š&quot;, also practically disappeared from Tunisia.

The period after Tunisian independence was also marked by the spread of Tunisian Arabic usage in literature and education. In fact, Tunisian Arabic was taught by the Peace Corps from 1966 until 1993 and more studies were carried out. Some which used new methods like computing operations and the automated creation of several speech recognition-based and Internet-based corpora, including the publicly available Tunisian Arabic Corpus Others, more traditional, were also made about the phonology, the morphology, the pragmatic and the semantics of Tunisian. The language has also been used to write several novels since the 1990s and even a Swadesh list in 2012. Now, it is taught by many institutions like the Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales (in Paris with Tunisian Arabic courses since 1916) and the Institut Bourguiba des Langues Vivantes (in Tunis with Tunisian Arabic courses since 1990). or in French high schools as an optional language. In fact, 1878 students sat for the Tunisian Arabic examination in the 1999 French Baccalauréat. Nowadays, the tendency in France is to implement Maghrebi Arabic, mainly Tunisian Arabic, in basic education.

But, those were not the only trials of Tunisian Arabic in education. A project to teach basic education for the elderly people using Tunisian Arabic was proposed in 1977 by Tunisian linguist Mohamed Maamouri. It aimed to ameliorate the quality and intelligibility of basic courses for elderly people who could not understand Standard Arabic as they did not learn it. However, the project was not implemented.

Nowadays, the linguistic classification of Tunisian Arabic causes controversies between interested people. The problem is caused because of the Arabic dialect continuum. Some linguists, such as Michel Quitout and Keith Walters, consider it an independent language, and some others, such as Enam El-Wer, consider it a divergent dialect of Arabic that is still dependent of Arabic morphology and structures.

Moreover, its political recognition is still limited as it is only recognized in France as a minority language part of Maghrebi Arabic according to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages of May 1999. However, even the charter was not agreed on by the Constitutional Council of France because its conflicts with the Article 2 of the French Constitution of 1958. Also, no official recognition or standardization in Tunisia was provided for Tunisian Arabic until 2011 despite the efforts of Tunisian professors Salah Guermadi and Hedi Balegh to prove that Tunisian is a language.

After the Tunisian revolution of 2011 when Tunisian Arabic was the mainly used language of communication, efforts to have the Tunisian language recognised were reinvigorated.

In 2011, the Tunisian Ministry of Youth and Sports has launched a version of its official website in Tunisian Arabic. However, this version was closed after a week of work because of an internet poll that has concluded that 53% of the users of the website were against using Tunisian Arabic in the website.

In 2013, Kélemti initiative was founded by Hager Ben Ammar, Scolibris, Arabesques Publishing House, and Valérie Vacchiani to promote and encourage the creation and publication of written resources about and in Tunisian Arabic.

In 2014, a version of the Tunisian Constitution of 2014 was published in Tunisian Arabic by the Tunisian Association of Constitutional Law.

In 2016 and after two years of work, the Derja Association has been launched by Ramzi Cherif and Mourad Ghachem in order to standardize and regulate Tunisian, to define a standard set of orthographic rules and vocabularies for it, to promote its use in daily life, literature and science, and to get an official recognition for it as a language in Tunisia and abroad. The Derja Association also offers an annual prize, the Abdelaziz Aroui Prize, for the best work written in Tunisian Arabic.

Since the 2011 revolution, there have been many novels published in Tunisian Arabic. The first such novel was Taoufik Ben Brik&#x27;s &quot;Kelb ben Kelb&quot; (2013); several prominent novels have been written by Anis Ezzine and Faten Fazaâ (the first woman to publish a novel in Tunisian Arabic). Although often criticized by literary critics, the Tunisian Arabic novels have been commercially successful: the first printing of Faten Fazaâ&#x27;s third novel sold out in less than a month.

==Distinctive features==
Tunisian Arabic is a variety of Arabic and as such shares many features with other modern varieties, especially the Maghrebi varieties of Arabic. Some of its distinctive features (compared to other Arabic dialects) are listed here.

* A conservative consonantal phonology (due to Berber substrates), with the pre-hilalian and interdental fricatives generally maintained. is usually pronounced in Bedouin dialects. The interdental fricatives are lost in the dialect of Mahdia, the Jewish dialect of Tunis, and the Jewish dialect of Soussa.
* The use of in urban varieties meaning &quot;you&quot; when addressing both men and women, and a concomitant loss of second person gender distinction in the verbal morphology. Second person gender distinction is still maintained in rural varieties by using for male and for female, with corresponding distinctions in verbal morphology.
* The lack of an indicative prefix in the verbal system, resulting in no distinction between indicative and subjunctive moods.
* The innovation of a progressive aspect by means of the participle , originally meaning &quot;sitting&quot;; and the preposition &quot;in&quot; in transitive clauses.
* The distinctive usage of future tense by using the prefixes or or + verb that is nearly equivalent to &quot;will&quot; + verb.
* Some vocabulary such as &quot;fast&quot;, &quot;good&quot; and &quot;very much&quot;. (e.g.: =&quot;very good&quot;)
* Unlike most of the other Muslim countries, the greeting &quot;as-salamu alaykum&quot; is not used as the common greeting expression in Tunisia. Tunisians use the expression (formal) or (informal) for greeting. Also, (formal) or the Italian &quot;ciao&quot; (informal) or more rarely the Italian &quot;arrivederci&quot; are used as the Tunisian &quot;goodbye&quot; expression. is used as &quot;thank you&quot;, in lieu of . However, Tunisian people do use some expressions from standard Arabic such as and for thank you. But, these expressions are used only as loan structures from standard Arabic and are not used as they are used in standard Arabic.
* The passive derivation of verbs is influenced by Berber and is different from the one of classical Arabic. It is obtained by prefixing the verb with , , or and the choice of one of the four prefixes depends on the used verb (ex: &quot;to drink&quot; → &quot;to be drunk&quot;).
* Nearly all educated Tunisians can communicate in French, which is widely used in business and as the main language of communication with foreigners. Code switching into French is common in Tunisian.
* Tunisian Arabic is an SVO language and it is most of the time a Null-subject language. In fact, the subject is only written in order to avoid meaning ambiguity.
* Tunisian has more agglutinative structures than Standard Arabic or the other varieties of Arabic, a phenomenon that was further strengthened by the influence of Turkish on Tunisian in the 17th century.

==Dialects==

The Arabic dialects of Tunisia belong to either pre-Hilalian or Hilalian dialectal families.

Before 1980, The pre-Hilalian group included old (&quot;Baldī&quot;) Urban dialects of Tunis, Kairouan, Sfax, Sousse, Nabeul and its region Cap Bon, Bizerte, old Village dialects (Sahel dialects), and the Judeo-Tunisian. The Hilalian set includes the Sulaym dialects in the south and the Eastern Hilal dialects in central Tunisia. The latter were also spoken in the Constantinois (eastern Algeria).

Nowadays and due to dialect leveling, the main dialect varieties of Tunisian Arabic are Northwestern Tunisian, southwestern Tunisian, Tunis dialect, Sahel dialect, Sfax dialect and southeastern Tunisian. All of these varieties are Hilalian excepting the Sfax one.

Tunis, Sahel and Sfax dialects (considered sedentary dialects) use the voiceless uvular stop in words such as قال &quot;he said&quot; while southeastern, northwestern and southwestern varieties (considered nomadic dialects) substitute it by the voiced velar stop as in . Moreover, only Tunis, Sfax and Sahel dialects use Tunisian phonology.

Indeed, northwestern and southwestern Tunisians speak Tunisian with Algerian Arabic phonology, which tends to simplify short vowels as short schwas while southeastern Tunisian speak Tunisian with the Libyan Arabic phonology.

Additionally, Tunis, Sfax and the urban Sahel dialects are known for not marking the second person gender. Hence, the otherwise feminine is used to address both men and women, and no feminine marking is used in verbs (&quot;inti mšīt&quot;). Northwestern, southeastern and southwestern varieties maintain the gender distinction found in Classical Arabic ( &quot;inta mšīt&quot;, &quot;inti mšītī&quot;).

Furthermore, Tunis, Sfax and Sahel varieties conjugate CCā verbs like mšā and klā in feminine third person and in past tense as CCāt. For example, &quot;hiya mšāt&quot;. However, Northwestern, southeastern and southwestern varieties conjugate them in feminine third person and in past tense as CCat For example, &quot;hiya mšat&quot;.

Finally, each of the six dialects have specific vocabulary and patterns.

===Tunis===
As the prestige variety of media, the Tunis dialect is considered the standard form of Tunisian Arabic and is the variety described in pedagogical and reference materials about &quot;Tunisian&quot; Arabic. It is spoken on the Northern East of Tunisia around Tunis, Cap Bon and Bizerte. However, it has a characteristic not shared with some of the other Tunisian Arabic dialects. It distinguishes the three short vowels and tends to pronounce [æ] as [ɛ] and the āš suffix, used in the end of question words, as an [ɛ:h].

===Sahel===
The Sahel dialect is known for the use of the singular first person &quot;ānī&quot; instead of &quot;ānā&quot;. It is also known for the pronunciation of &quot;wā&quot; as [wɑː] and the pronunciation &quot;ū&quot; and &quot;ī&quot; as respectively [oː] and [eː] when it is a substitution of the common Classical Arabic diphthongs /aw/ and /aj/. For example, &quot;zīt&quot; is pronounced as [ze:t] and &quot;lūn&quot; is pronounced as [lɔːn]. Furthermore, when &quot;ā&quot; is at the end of the indefinite or &quot;il-&quot; definite word, this final &quot;ā&quot; is pronounced as [iː]. For example, &quot;smā&quot; is pronounced as [smiː]. Moreover, If a word begins with a consonant cluster starting with /θ/ or /ð/, these sounds are pronounced respectively as [t] and [d]. For example, /θlaːθa/ is pronounced as [tlɛːθæ]. As well, the Sahel dialect is known for using &quot;miš&quot; instead of &quot;mūš&quot; to mean the negation of future predicted action.

===Sfax===
The Sfax dialect is known mostly for its conservation of the Arabic diphthongs /aj/ and /aw/ and of the short /a/ between two consonants and its use of wḥīd instead of wḥūd to mean the plural of someone.

Other dialects have substituted them respectively by /iː/ and /uː/ and dropped the short /a/ between the first and second consonant of the word.
It is also known by the substitution of short /u/ by short /i/, when it comes in the beginning of the word or just after the first consonant. For example, /χubz/ is pronounced as [χibz].

It is also known for the use of specific words, like &quot;baṛmaqnī&quot; meaning window. Furthermore, it is known for the substitution of [ʒ] by [z] when it comes in the beginning of a word and when that word contains [s] or [z] in its middle or end. For example, /ʒazzaːrˤ/ is pronounced as [zæzzɑːrˤ] and /ʒarʒiːs/ is pronounced as [zærzi:s].

Unlike other Tunisian dialects, Sfax dialect does not simplify the last long vowel at the end of a word. It is also known for some specific verbs like &quot;aṛā&quot; (to see) and the use of the demonstrative articles &quot;hākūma&quot; for those and &quot;hāka&quot; (m.) and &quot;hākī&quot; (f.) for that respectively instead of &quot;hāðūkum&quot; and &quot;hāðāka&quot; (m.) and &quot;hāðākī&quot; (f.) determinants. Finally, the conjugation of &quot;mūš&quot; as a modal verb uses &quot;māhūwāš&quot; instead of &quot;māhūš&quot;, &quot;māhīyāš&quot; instead of &quot;māhīš&quot;, &quot;māḥnāš&quot; instead of &quot;mānāš&quot; and &quot;māhūmāš&quot; instead of &quot;māhumš&quot;.

Sfax dialect is also known for its profusion of diminutives. For example, 
* qṭayṭas (little or friendly cat) for qaṭṭūs (cat). 
* klayib (little or friendly dog) for kalb (dog).

===Northwestern===
The northwestern dialect is known by pronouncing r as [rˤ] when it is written before an ā or ū. Furthermore, it is known for the substitution of [ʒ] by [z] when it comes at the beginning of a word and when that word contains [s] or [z] in its middle or end. Also, it is known for the pronunciation of ū and ī respectively as [o:] and [e:] when they are in an emphatic or uvular environment. As well, northwestern dialect is known for using &quot;miš&quot; that is pronounced as [məʃ] instead of &quot;mānīš&quot; to mean the negation of future predicted action. Similarly, the conjugation of &quot;miš&quot; as a modal verb uses &quot;mišnī&quot; instead of &quot;mānīš&quot;, &quot;mišk&quot; instead of &quot;mākš&quot;, &quot;miššū&quot; instead of &quot;mūš&quot; and &quot;māhūš&quot;, &quot;mišhā&quot; instead of &quot;māhīš&quot;, &quot;mišnā&quot; instead of &quot;mānāš&quot;, &quot;miškum&quot; instead of &quot;mākumš&quot; and &quot;mišhum&quot; instead of &quot;māhumš&quot;. Moreover, northwestern dialect is known for the use of &quot;naḥnā&quot; instead of &quot;aḥnā&quot; as a plural second person personal pronoun and the southern area of this Tunisian dialect like El Kef is known for the use of &quot;nāy&quot; or &quot;nāya&quot; instead of &quot;ānā&quot; (meaning I) excepting Kairouan that is known for using &quot;yāna&quot; in this situation.

===Southeastern===
The southeastern dialect is known for a different conjugation of verbs ending with &quot;ā&quot; in the third person of plural. In fact, people speaking this variety of Tunisian Arabic do not add the regular &quot;ū&quot; suffix after the vowel ā but used to drop the &quot;ā&quot; and then add the &quot;ū&quot;. For example, مشى &quot;mšā&quot; is conjugated as مشوا &quot;mšū&quot; instead of مشاوا &quot;mšāw&quot; with the third person of plural. Furthermore, it is known for the substitution of [ʒ] by [z] at the beginning of a word and when that word contains [s] or [z] in its middle or end. Moreover, it is known like the Sahil dialect for the pronunciation /uː/ and /iː/ as respectively [oː] and [eː] when it is a substitution of the common classical Arabic diphthongs /aw/ and /aj/. Furthermore, this dialect is also known for the use of أنا &quot;anā&quot; instead of آنا &quot;ānā&quot; (meaning I), the use of حنا &quot;ḥnā&quot; instead of أحنا &quot;aḥnā&quot; (meaning we), the use of إنتم &quot;intumm&quot; (masc.) and إنتن &quot;intinn&quot; (fem.) instead of انتوما &quot;intūma&quot; (meaning you in plural) and the use of هم &quot;humm&quot; (masc.) and هن &quot;hinn&quot; (fem.) instead of هوما &quot;hūma&quot; (meaning they).

===Southwestern===
The southwestern dialect is known for a different conjugation of verbs ending with &quot;ā&quot; in the third person of plural. In fact, people who are speaking this variety of Tunisian Arabic do not add the regular &quot;ū&quot; suffix after the vowel &quot;ā&quot; but used to drop the &quot;ā&quot; and then add the &quot;ū&quot;. For example, مشى &quot;mšā&quot; is conjugated as مشوا mšū with the third person of plural. Furthermore, this dialect is also known for the use of ناي &quot;nāy&quot; instead of آنا &quot;ānā&quot; (meaning I), the use of حني &quot;ḥnī&quot; instead of أحنا &quot;aḥnā&quot; (meaning we), the use of إنتم &quot;intumm&quot; (masc.) and إنتن &quot;intinn&quot; (fem.) instead of انتوما &quot;intūma&quot; (meaning you in plural) and the use of هم &quot;humm&quot; (masc.) and هن &quot;hinn&quot; (fem.) instead of هوما &quot;hūma&quot; (meaning they). Moreover, it is known for the pronunciation of ū and ī respectively as [o:] and [e:] in an emphatic or uvular environment.

==Use and geographical distribution==
Tunisian Arabic is the mother tongue of the Arabic-speaking population in Tunisia. It is also the second language of the Berber minority living in the country, particularly in some villages of Djerba and Tataouine.

However, Tunisian Arabic has the role of the low variety in an example of classic diglossia, and Standard Arabic is the high variety. As such, the use of Tunisian Arabic is mainly restricted to spoken domains. as its written and cultural use began in the 17th century and regularly developed since the 20th century only. Now, it is used for a wide range of purposes, including communication, politics, literature, theatre, and music.

===Society===
From the 1990s, Tunisians began to write in Tunisian Arabic when communicating on the Internet, especially on social networking sites, and in text messages. This trend accelerated during the 2011 street protests that brought down the regime of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, in which text messaging and social networking played a major role.

In religion, the use of Tunisian Arabic in promoting Islam is limited although there are some trial efforts. In Christianity, the use of Tunisian Arabic is significant beginning with a 1903 New Testament translation.
In 2013 and subsequent years, Tunisian author and linguist Mohamed Bacha&lt;ref name=&quot;amazon.com/author/mohamedbacha&quot;&gt;amazon.com/author/mohamedbacha&lt;/ref&gt; published very popular textbooks and references to learn Tunisian Arabic and explore Tunisian culture, aimed to international readers who are fluent in English : &quot;Tunisian Arabic in 24 lessons&quot;, &quot;Tunisian Arabic in 30 lessons&quot;, &quot;Tunisian Arabic - English dictionary&quot;, &quot;Tunisian folklore: folktales, songs, proverbs&quot;, This unique book contains a selection of Tunisia&#x27;s oral literature and culture : folktales, proverbs, popular songs. In the latter book, the author Mohamed Bacha adapted into written form (through transliteration) and translated into English some of the most representative oral folklore of Tunisia, while keeping its authenticity and unique cultural flavor. In addition to multilingual editions of oral folktales: &quot;Jabra and the lion&quot;, in Tunisian Arabic, English, French. &quot;Eternal Classic Songs of Tunisia&quot; (Tunisian, English, French)

===Literature===
Before Tunisian independence, there was a large body of folk tales and folk poems in Tunisian Arabic. It was mainly an oral tradition, told by wandering storytellers and bards at marketplaces and festivals. The most important of these folktales are &quot;il-Jāzya il-hlālīya&quot; () and &quot;ḥkāyat ummī sīsī w il-ðīb&quot; (). A few years after independence, the more popular ones were recorded for ERTT broadcast, in Tunisian Arabic by Abdelaziz El Aroui, or translated mainly to French and standard Arabic by other authors. The recorded Tunisian folktales were transcribed in Tunisian Arabic using Arabic script only in the 2010s, thanks to the work of the Kelemti Association of the promotion of Tunisian Arabic in 2013 and the work of Karen McNeil of 2014.

As for novels and short stories, most authors who fluently know Tunisian Arabic prefer to write in Standard Arabic or in French. But since the initiative of the Taht Essour and particularly Ali Douagi to use Tunisian Arabic in transcribing dialogues in novels and writing some newspapers, the dialogues in the Standard Arabic Tunisian novels or romans became written in Tunisian Arabic using the Arabic script.

However, since the early 1990s, Hedi Balegh initiated a new trend in Tunisian literature. He was the first to translate a novel to Tunisian Arabic in 1997 and to make collections of Tunisian idioms and proverbs in 1994 using Arabic script. Some authors, particularly Tahar Fazaa (mainly in &quot;Tšanšīnāt Tūnsīya&quot; ()) and Taoufik Ben Brik (mainly when writing &quot;Kalb Bin Kalb&quot; () and &quot;Kawāzākī&quot; ()) followed him and used Tunisian Arabic in order to write novels, plays and books in Tunisian Arabic.

As for plays in Tunisian Arabic, the first ones were made by the Tunisian-Egyptian Company just after World War I. They faced several objections. However, it acquired general recognition in Tunisia by the end of World War II. After Tunisian independence, the government encouraged the development of theater in Tunisian Arabic through the creation of supporting institutions. That resulted in the creation of notable plays in Tunisian Arabic following the trends of world literature between 1965 and 2005. The main authors of these plays were Jalila Baccar, and members of the National Theatre troupes of the Medina of Tunis, El Kef and Gafsa.

Now, plays are almost always written in Tunisian Arabic except when they are placed in a historical setting. Plays written in Tunisian Arabic are widely considered as meaningful and valuable ones.

Since the 2011 Tunisian Revolution, there has been a trend of novels written in Tunisian Arabic. Since Taoufik Ben Brik&#x27;s &quot;Kalb Bin Kalb&quot; () in 2013, Tunisian Arabic novels have been written by Faten Fazaâ, Anis Ezzine, Amira Charfeddine, and Youssef Chahed. Translation of Tunisian and world literature into Tunisian Arabic have been done by Dhia Bousselmi and Majd Mastoura.

===Music===

The oldest lyrics found written in Tunisian, dates back to the 17th century, by Abu el-Hassan el-Karray, who died in 1693 in the medina quarter of Sfax and wrote a poem in Tunisian Arabic during his youth:

The effective beginning of Tunisian Arabic written songs came in the early 19th century, when Tunisian Jews in the Beylik of Tunis began writing songs in Tunisian Arabic about love, betrayal and other libertine subjects. The current strengthened at the beginning of the 20th century and affected the Tunisian ma&#x27;luf and folklore. Judeo-Tunisian song flowered in the 1930s, with such Jewish artists as Cheikh El Afrit and Habiba Msika.

This tendency was promoted by the creation of Radio Tunis in 1938 and the creation of Établissement de la radiodiffusion-télévision tunisienne in 1966, which allowed many musicians to better disseminate their works and helped spread the use of Tunisian Arabic in songs.

At the same time, popular music developed in the early 19th century, using Tunisian Arabic poems accompanied by Tunisian musical instruments like the mizwad. This kind of music was promoted by the National Troupe of the Popular Arts, created in 1962. Later adaptation and promotion of popular songs, especially by Ahmed Hamza and later Kacem Kefi, further developed Tunisian music. Natives of Sfax, they were both influenced by Mohamed Ennouri and Mohamed Boudaya, leading masters of popular music in that city. Nowadays, this kind of music is very popular.

Tunisian Arabic became the main variety used in writing lyrics of songs in Tunisia and even the main technical words in music have their synonyms in Tunisian Arabic.

In the early 1990s, underground music in Tunisian Arabic appeared. This mainly consisted of rap and was not successful in the beginning because of the lack of media coverage. Tunisian underground music, mainly written in Tunisian Arabic, became successful in the 2000s, thanks to its spread over the Internet, and came to involve other alternative genres like reggae and rock.

In 2014, the first opera songs in Tunisian Arabic had appeared. They were the ones of Yosra Zekri that were written by Emna Rmilli and composed by Jalloul Ayed.
In 2018, the Tunisian linguist Mohamed Bacha published &quot;Eternal Classic Songs of Tunisia&quot; The mythical classic Tunisian songs presented in this book were performed by artists popular in Tunisia&#x27;s urban centers in the 1950s, 60s, 70s, 80s. The lyrics of these beautiful songs are in natural and authentic Tunisian Arabic, the spoken language of Tunisia. The singers performed with Western and Egyptian-like orchestra ensembles, in addition to a Chorus that repeats some verses in a beautiful, unique Tunisian manner, in some songs like ‘’O The Beauty of The Desert” and ‘’How Could you believe it!?’’ 
The music of the songs was composed by great professional musicians such as Boubaker El Mouldi, Mohamed Triki, Salah El Mahdi, Ridha Kalaï, Ali Riahi, Kaddour Srarfi, Chedly Anouar, Hedi Jouini. The lyrics written by poets like Omar Ben Salem, Mahmoud Bourguiba, Mohamed Bouthina. Only rarely was the singer himself at the same time the music composer, as in the case of Ali Riahi in some of his songs. Some of the best Tunisian classic songs were selected from the rich traditional musical folklore.

===Cinema and mass media===

Of the few domestic movies produced since 1966, many tried to reflect new social dynamics, development, identity research and modernity shock, and were done in Tunisian Arabic. Some of them achieved relative success outside Tunisia, such as &quot;La Goulette&quot; (&quot;ḥalq il-wād&quot; (), 1996), &quot;Halfaouine: Child of the Terraces&quot; (&quot;ʿaṣfūr il-sṭaḥ&quot; (), 1990), and &quot;The Ambassadors&quot; (&quot;il-sufaṛā&quot; (), 1975).

Television and radio programs in Tunisian Arabic began officially in 1966 with the establishment of the Établissement de la Radiodiffusion-Télévision Tunisienne.
Tunisian Arabic is now widely used for all television and radio programs, with the exception of news, religious programs and historical dramas. There is even several translations of cartoon series in Tunisian Arabic, like during the 1980s Qrīnaṭ il-šalwāš () and Mufattiš kaʿbūṛa (). As well, foreign Television series begun to be translated to Tunisian Arabic in 2016. The first translation of foreign television series was entitled Qlūb il-rummān () and was developed by Nessma TV from the Turkish television series Kaderimin Yazıldığı Gün.

Some Tunisian Arabic works acquired some honors in the broader Arab world like the ASBU Festival First Prize in 2015. and the Festival of Arab Media Creation Prize in 2008.

Moreover, since the 1990s, mass media advertisements increasingly use Tunisian Arabic, and many advertising boards have their slogans and the original or alternative company name written in Tunisian.

However, the main newspapers in Tunisia are not written in Tunisian Arabic although there were trials to establish humoristic newspapers in Tunisian Arabic like &quot;kull šay b- il-makšūf&quot; () that was directed by Hedi Saidi and Hechmi Bouaziz and led by Ali Douagi and that was issued quite regularly from 23 April 1937 to 22 October 1959. The leading newspapers are still written either in Modern Standard Arabic or in Standard French, even if cartoons in most of them can be written in Tunisian.

==Scripts==
===Arabic script===

The Arabic script used for Tunisian is largely the same as for Arabic. However, it includes additional letters to support /g/ (ڨ), /v/ (ڥ) and /p/ (پ).

The first known use of Arabic script for Tunisian was recorded in the 17th century, when Sheykh Karray wrote several poems in Tunisian Arabic for mystic purposes. However, transcription of Tunisian Arabic was not common until 1903, when the Gospel of John was transcribed in Tunisian Arabic using Arabic script. After the World War I, the use of Arabic script to Tunisian Arabic became very common with the works of Taht Essour. Nowadays, it has become the main script used for Tunisian Arabic, even in published books, but writing conventions for Tunisian Arabic are not standardized and can change from one book to another.

In 2014, Ines Zribi et al. proposed a Conventional Orthography for Tunisian Arabic based on the principles of CODA as proposed in 2012. The orthography is based on eliminating phonological simplifications by comparing the words and structures of Tunisian Arabic by their correspondent etymological equivalent in Modern Standard Arabic. Although the convention is quite important, the orthography does not differentiate between [q] and [g] and does not involve several important phonemes that are mainly used in loanwords.

===Latin script===

====Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft Umschrift====
In 1845, the Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft or DMG, a German scientific association dedicated to the studies and the languages of the orient, was formed in Leipzig. Soon, the organization developed a transcription system for Arabic in Latin script. Its system was a phonemic transcription of Arabic written with an extended Latin alphabet and macrons for long vowels. However, this Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft transcription was first tried on Tunisian only after the establishment of the French Protectorate of Tunisia in 1881.

The first linguistic study about Tunisian to be completed was of German linguist Hans Stumme, who, from 1893 to 1896, transcribed Tunisian Arabic with the DMG transcription. In addition, from 1897 to 1935, a series of linguistic works were conducted by several French members of the DMG, like William Marçais, Philippe Marçais, David Cohen and Alfred Nicolas. These works included corpuses, grammar books, dictionaries, or studies. By 1935, the DMG transcription included many unique letters and diacritics for Tunisian not used for Arabic, such as, à, è, ù and ì, for short and accentuated vowels. This is the reason why the XIXth international congress of orientalists held in Rome, from 23 to 29 September 1935, adopted a modified simplified version of the DMG transcription specifically for Arabic dialects. From 1935 to 1985, most of the linguists working on Tunisian Arabic such as Gilbert Boris, Hans Rudolf Singer, Lucienne Saada and others, adopted the modified DMG.

As of 2016, the modified DMG is still used by institutions such as SIL International or the University of Vienna for Tunisian Arabic written corpuses and linguistic books.

====Additional scripts====
* Phonetic Transcription:

Even if the Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft transcription was abundantly used in early linguistic researches about Tunisian, some trials were performed in order to create alternative Latin scripts and writing methods. The purpose of the trials was to have a simpler and more intuitive Latin Script Writing system than DMG or to try to solve the lack of interconvertibility between scripts as the transcription of Tunisian with the German DMG method was phonetic and not syntactic.

The first successful trial to create a specific Latin script and writing method for Tunisian was the &quot;Practical Orthography of Tunisian Arabic&quot;, created by Joseph Jourdan in 1913. Its principle was to use French consonant and vowel digraphs and phonology to transcribe non-Latin sounds. In this method, &quot;kh&quot; is used to
transcribe /χ/, &quot;ch&quot; to transcribe /ʃ/, &quot;th&quot; to transcribe /θ/, &quot;gh&quot; to transcribe /ʁ/, &quot;dh&quot; to transcribe /ð/ or /ðˤ/ and &quot;ou&quot; to transcribe /u:/, &quot;a&quot; to transcribe /a:/ and /ɛː/, i to transcribe /i:/ and e to transcribe the short vowels. The layout was successful because it did not involve additional Latin letters and could be transcribed efficiently. It was used in the later linguistic works of Joseph Jourdan about Tunisian Arabic until 1956. Moreover, it is still presently used in French books to transcribe Tunisian Arabic. The method was used in 1995 by the Tunisian Arabizi, an Arabic chat alphabet, converting the consonant digraphs into digits. It uses 2 to transcribe a glottal stop, 3 to transcribe /ʕ/, 5 to transcribe /χ/, 6 to transcribe /tˤ/, 7 to transcribe /ħ/, 8 to transcribe /ʁ/ and 9 to transcribe /q/. The ch, dh, and th digraphs were kept in Tunisian Arabizi. Vowels are transcribed according to their quality and not to their length as a is used to transcribe short and long [ɐ] and [æ], e is used to transcribe short and long [ɛ] and [e], u is used to transcribe short and long [y], eu is used to transcribe short and long [œ], o is used to transcribe short and long [o], ou is used to transcribe short and long [u] and i is used to transcribe short and long [i] and [ɪ]. Sometimes, users differentiate between short and long vowels by dropping short ones. Like all other Arabic chat alphabets, its use spread considerably during the 1990s mainly with the Tunisian young people. Nowadays, it is used principally on social networks and mobile phones. Also, during the Tunisian Revolution of 2011, Tunisian Arabizi was the main script used for message transmission on internet. After 2011, more interest was given to Tunisian Arabizi and in 2013, a concise grammar book about Tunisian, written with Tunisian Arabizi, was issued. In 2016, Tunisian Arabizi has been recognized by &quot;Ethnologue&quot; as an official informal script for writing Tunisian. However, this chat alphabet is not standardized and is seen as informal as the Arabic sounds are transcribed as numbers and letters at the same time. The use of digits as numerals and letters at the same time made transcribing Tunisian difficult to users and did not linguistically solve the matters that were faced by the Practical Transcription.

Although they are popular, both methods have problems such as the possibility of ambiguity between digraphs, the absolute certainty of getting a rate of graphs per phoneme that is significantly superior to 1 and of getting independent consonants having the same transliteration as the digraphs, and the lack of disambiguation between /ð/ and /ðˤ/.

A translation of &quot;Le Petit Nicolas&quot; by Dominique Caubet uses a phonetic transcription.
Separately, another Latin script transcription method was created by Patrick L. Inglefield and his team of linguists from Peace Corps Tunisia and Indiana University in 1970. Letters in this method can be written in lowercase letters only, and even T and S are not equivalent to t and s as T is used to transcribe /tˤ/ and S is used to transcribe /sˤ/. Moreover, three additional Latin letters are used in this writing method that are 3 (/ʕ/), ø (/ð/) and ħ (/ħ/). Four common English digraphs are used that are dh (/ðˤ/), gh (/ʁ/), th (/tˤ/) and sh (/ʃ/). In order to distinguish the digraphs from the independent letters written like the digraphs, the digraphs are underlined. As for the vowels, they are written as å (glottal stop or /ʔ/), ā (/æ/), ā: (/ɛ:/), a (short a or /a/), a: (long a or /a:/), i (short i or /i/), i: (long i or /i:/), u (short u or /u/), u: (Long u or /u:/). This method was used in the Peace Corps books about Tunisian Arabic until 1993, when Peace Corps Tunisia became inactive.

* Syntactic Transliteration:

After years of works on a phonetic transliteration of Tunisian, linguists decided that the transliteration should be mainly syntactic. Timothy Buckwalter created an orthography-based transcription of Arabic texts during his work for Xerox. Buckwalter transcription was created in order to avoid the effect of phoneme simplification of spoken Modern Standard Arabic on the morphological analysis of the language. In 2004, Tunisian linguist Mohamed Maamouri proposed to use the same transliteration for Arabic dialects and mainly Tunisian. This idea was later developed by Nizar Habash and Mona Diab in 2012 into CODA-based Buckwalter transliteration that eliminates phonological simplification in the Arabic dialects through doing comparisons between dialectal structures and their Modern Standard Arabic equivalents.
In 2013, a complete work about the regulations of the use of the Buckwalter transliteration for Tunisian was issued by Ines Zribi and her team from the University of Sfax. In fact, a morphological analysis method and a conventional orthography for Tunisian Arabic using this method were posted by 2014.
However, the method is currently used for computer operations only and it is not used by people, as it involves some ASCII non-alphanumeric graphs as letters, and S, D and T do not correspond respectively to the same phonemes as s, d and t. Furthermore, p does not correspond to /p/ but to ﺓ. Even the modified version of Buckwalter transliteration that was proposed by Nizar Habash et al. in 2007 and that substitute ASCII non-alphanumeric graphs by additional Latin letters did not solve the other problems of the original Buckwalter transliteration. That is why both versions of Buckwalter transliteration were not adopted for daily use in writing Tunisian Arabic and are adopted only for NLP purposes.

==Vocabulary==
===Non-Arabic words===
The most immediately apparent difference between Tunisian and Standard Arabic is the extensive use of native, substratum words of Latin and Berber etymology or borrowed ones from Italian, Spanish, French and Turkish. For example, electricity is كهرباء &quot;kahraba&quot; in standard Arabic. It is تريسيتي &quot;trīsītī&quot; in Tunisian Arabic (a word used mainly by older people), from the French &quot;électricité&quot;. Other loans from French include برتمان &quot;buṛtmān&quot; (flat), and بياسة &quot;byāsa&quot; (coin). Furthermore, there are words and structures that came from Turkish, such as ڨاوري &quot;gāwrī&quot; (foreigner) (&quot;Gavur&quot;) as well as the suffix of occupation as in بوصطاجي &quot;būṣṭājī&quot; (post officer) and كوّارجي &quot;kawwāṛjī&quot; (football player). A sample of words derived from Latin, French, Italian, Turkish, Berber, Greek or Spanish is below:

Those words are not to be confused with the actual use of French words or sentences in everyday speech by Tunisians (codeswitching), which is common in everyday language and business environments. However, many French words are used within Tunisian Arabic discourse, without being adapted to Tunisian phonology, apart from the French &quot;r&quot; , which is often replaced, especially by men, with . For example, many Tunisians, when asking &quot;How are you?&quot; will use the French &quot;ça va?&quot; instead of, and in addition to the Tunisian لاباس &quot;(lebes) &quot;. It is difficult in this case to establish whether it is an example of using French or borrowing.

In general, concerning the case of loanwords, they are adapted to Tunisian phonology for years until they become pronounced with basic Tunisian Arabic sounds only. For example, the French word &quot;apartement&quot; became برتمان &quot;buṛtmān&quot; and the Italian word &quot;pacco&quot; became باكو &quot;bakū&quot;.

===Shift in meanings===
The greatest number of differences between Tunisian and standard Arabic is not due to the influences from other languages but to a shift in meaning of several Arabic roots. For example, means &quot;serve&quot; in Standard Arabic but &quot;work&quot; in Tunisian Arabic; meanwhile, means &quot;work&quot; in Standard Arabic but has a broader meaning of &quot;do&quot; in Tunisian Arabic; and in Tunisian Arabic means &quot;go&quot; rather than &quot;walk&quot; as in Standard Arabic.

In general, meaning shift happens when there is a lexical implication of the society speaking the language so the social situation and the thoughts of the speakers of the languages obliged them to change the meaning of some words so their language could be adapted to their situation and that is exactly what happened in Tunisia. In fact, the influences of rhetoric and semantic structures from other contact languages like French helped the meaning shift in Tunisian.

===Word fusion===
In Tunisian, some new words and structures were created through the fusion of two words or more. Almost all question words fall into the latter category. The question words are noticeable by beginning or ending with the sound &quot;š&quot; or &quot;āš&quot; and are not to be confused with the negation mark, &quot;š&quot;, which agrees verbs, as in &quot;mā mšītš&quot; ما مشيتش (I did not go).

The table below shows a comparison of various question words in Tunisian, Standard Arabic and English:

Some of the question words can be merged with other structures such as the prepositions and object pronouns. For example, &quot;who are you&quot; becomes شكونك إنت &quot;škūnik intī&quot; or simply شكونك &quot;škūnik&quot; and &quot;how much is this&quot; becomes بقدّاش &quot;b-qaddāš&quot;.

Another example of word fusion in Tunisian is the formation of numerals between 11 and 19, which are pronounced as one word, composed of the name of the digit obtained by subtracting 10 to the number and the suffix طاش &quot;ṭāš&quot; derived from the standard Arabic word عَشَرَ /ʕaʃara/, those numbers are in order: احداش &quot;aḥdāš&quot;, اثناش &quot;θṇāš&quot;, ثلطّاش &quot;θlaṭṭāš&quot;, أربعطاش &quot;aṛbaʿṭāš&quot;, خمسطاش &quot;xmasṭāš&quot;, سطّاش &quot;sitṭāš&quot;, سبعطاش &quot;sbaʿṭāš&quot;, ثمنطاش &quot;θmanṭāš&quot; and تسعطاش &quot;tsaʿṭāš&quot;.

===Pattern and root-based creation of new words===
In Tunisian Arabic, as in other Semitic languages, the creation of new words is based on a root and pattern system, also known as the Semitic root. That means that new words can be created through the association of a root that is composed most of the time of three letters that have a meaning with a rhythm or pattern that informs about the position of the object in the fact. For example, K-T-B is a root meaning &quot;to write&quot; and مفعول maf‘ūl is a pattern meaning that the object submitted the fact. Thus, the combination of the root and the given pattern render &quot;maKTūB&quot;, which means something that was written.

===Conjugation in Tunisian===

In this representation, we are going to use Latin letters from the Standard Tunisian Alphabet
Studying Tunisian verbs, we have found out that we can classify verbs depending on the number and the position of consonants and vowels in a verb. There are more than 11 possible verb patterns/groups, however Tunisians mostly use 4-5: CVC-CCV-CCVC-CVCC-CV.

Some examples of infinitive verbs from each category:
*CVC: Qal (to say), Çêf (to see), Qaas (to measure), Zeed (to add/to increase).
*CVCC: Ħatt (to put), Ħäbb (to love/to want), Jeewb (to respond/to answer), Xaalf (to disagree).
*CCV: Klee (to eat), Msce (to go), Qra (to read/to study)
*CCVC: Scrab (to drink), Sreq (to steal), Staad (to hunt), Mteez (to be different or special at something).
*CV: Je (to come), Ra (to see, less commonly used).

&quot;Concerning the conjugation, each verb group has its way:&quot;

Verbs starting with one consonant:
As for CVCC verbs, things might change a bit. Both simple-voweled verbs and double-voweled ones will be conjugated differently.


Examples:

Jeewb:
*Huma: y+infinitve+u → y+jeewb+u →Yjeewbu (they answer).
Seefr:
*Aħna: CVC+e+C+na → seef+e+r+na →Seeferna (We travelled).

Note:

gav, as seen in the charts, or the grammatical aspect of the verb represents the new form, a verb could take corresponding to the tense.

It&#x27;s just replacing the V in its CVC or CVCC form by another vowel Vs

Depending on this chart, we can know the shifted vowels and be able to conjugate verbs in every tense.
 gav(CVC)=CVsC, gav(CVCC)=CVsCC.

*Ena: n+gav(qal) → n+qoul → Nqoul (I say).
*Entuma: gav(zeed)+tu → zed+tu → Zedtu (you added).

Of course there are some exceptions like &quot;Thaë&quot; (to be lost) and &quot;Xaf&quot; (to be scared).

Other examples:

Fädd:
*Entuma: t+gav(fädd)+u → t+fedd+u → Tfeddu. (you get bored)
Ħatt:
*Hia: infinitive+et → ħatt+et → Ħattet. (she put)
Ëaawd
*Enti: infinitive → Ëaawd. (repeat!)

Verbs starting with two consonants:

==Phonology==
There are several differences in pronunciation between Standard and Tunisian Arabic. Nunation does not exist in Tunisian Arabic, and short vowels are frequently omitted, especially if they would occur as the final element of an open syllable, which was probably encouraged by the Berber substratum.

However, there are some more specific characteristics related to Tunisian Arabic like the phenomenon of metathesis.

===Metathesis===
Metathesis is the shift of the position of the first vowel of the word. It occurs when the unconjugated verb or unsuffixed noun begins with CCVC, where C is an ungeminated consonant and V is a short vowel. When a suffix is added to this kind of noun or when the verb is conjugated, the first vowel changes of position and the verb or noun begins with CVCC.

For example:
* &quot;(he) wrote&quot; in Tunisian Arabic becomes كتب &quot;ktib&quot; and &quot;(she) wrote&quot; in Tunisian Arabic becomes كتبت &quot;kitbit&quot;.
* &quot;some stuff&quot; in Tunisian Arabic becomes دبش &quot;dbaš&quot; and &quot;my stuff&quot; in Tunisian Arabic becomes دبشي &quot;dabšī&quot;.

===Stress===
Stress is not phonologically distinctive and is determined by the word&#x27;s syllable structure. Hence, 
* it falls on the ultimate syllable if it is doubly closed: سروال &quot;sirwāl&quot; (trousers).
* Otherwise, it falls on the penultimate syllable, if there is one: جريدة &quot;jarīda&quot; (newspaper). 
* Stress falls on all the word if there is only one syllable within it: مرا mṛa (woman).
* Affixes are treated as part of the word: نكتبولكم &quot;niktbūlkum&quot; (we write to you).

For example:
* جابت &quot;jābit&quot; (She brought).
* ما جابتش &quot;mā jābitš&quot; (She did not bring).

=== Assimilation ===
Assimilation is a phonological process in Tunisian Arabic. The possible assimilations are:

* Only if C is a voiced consonant.
* Only if C is a voiceless consonant.
===Consonants===
Tunisian Arabic &quot;qāf&quot; has and as reflexes in respectively sedentary and nomadic varieties: &quot;he said&quot; is instead of ). However, some words have the same form whatever the dialect: &quot;cow&quot; is always (the /g/ deriving from an originally Arabic [q]), and a specific species of &quot;date&quot; is always (the /g/ deriving from an originally Semitic [q] - e.g. Aramaic: /diqla/: date tree). Sometimes, substituting [g] by [q] can change the meaning of a word. For example, garn means &quot;horn&quot; and qarn means &quot;century&quot;.

Interdental fricatives are also maintained for several situations, except in the Sahil dialect.

Furthermore, Tunisian Arabic merged with .
Phonetic notes:
* The emphatic consonants /mˤ, nˤ, bˤ, zˤ/ rarely occur, and most of them are found in words of non-Arabic etymology. Minimal pairs are not always easy to find for these contrasts, but there are nonetheless examples, which show that these marginal forms do not represent allophones of other phonemes. For example:
::: &quot;door&quot; and &quot;Father&quot;
::: &quot;petrol&quot; and &quot;gas&quot;
: These emphatic consonants occur before or after the vowels and . A different analysis is that the posited allophones of and are phonemically distinct, and it is the marginal emphatic consonants that are allophonic. 
* /p/ and /v/ are found in words of non-Arabic etymology and are usually replaced by /b/, like in &quot;ḅāḅūr&quot; and &quot;ḅāla&quot;. However, they are preserved in some words, like &quot;pīsīn&quot; and &quot;talvza&quot;.
* /t͡ʃ/ and /d͡z/ are rarely used, for example &quot;tšīša&quot;, &quot;dzīṛa&quot; and &quot;dzāyir&quot;.
* The glottal stop /ʔ/ is usually dropped but tends to occur in the learned register, in loans from Standard Arabic, often in &quot;&quot; (verbal noun) forms at the onset of the word but also in other words like &quot;environment&quot; and &quot;he asks&quot;, though many (mainly less educated) speakers substitute for in the latter word.
* Like in Standard Arabic, &quot;shadda&quot; &quot;gemination&quot; is very likely to occur in Tunisian. For example, &quot;haddad&quot; هدد meaning to threaten.

===Vowels===
There are two primary analyses of Tunisian vowels: 
*Three vowel qualities, and a large number of emphatic consonants, namely . has distinct allophones near guttural (emphatic, uvular and pharyngeal) consonants ([ɐ], [ä]) and near non-guttural consonants ([æ]).
*Four vowel qualities, , and only the three phonemic emphatic consonants . The other emphatic consonants are allophones found in the environment of .

The first analysis is suggested by comparing other Maghrebi Arabic dialects, like Algerian and Moroccan Arabic, where the same phenomenon of vocalic allophony happens for /u/ and /i/ as well.

Regardless of the analysis, Hilalian influence has provided the additional vowels and to the Sahil and southeastern dialects. These two long vowels are reflexes of the diphthongs /aj/ and /aw/.

* By assuming that pharyngealisation is a property of consonants, most dialects have three vowel qualities , all also distinguished for length, as in Standard Arabic. 
* The length distinction is suspended at the end of the word. A final vowel is realised long in accent-bearing words of one syllable (For example, جاء &quot;jā&quot; &quot;he came&quot;), otherwise short.
* In non-pharyngealised environments, the open vowel is in stressed syllables and or in unstressed syllables. In pharyngealised environments, the open vowel is . 
* and nasal vowels are rare in native words, for most of the varieties of Tunisian and mainly for the Tunis dialect, like منقوبة mañqūba and لنڨار lañgār and mainly occur in French loans. and only exist in French loanwords.
* Unlike other Maghrebi dialects, short u and i are reduced to and when written between two consonants unless when they are in stressed syllables.

===Syllables and pronunciation simplification===
Tunisian Arabic has a very different syllable structure from Standard Arabic like all other Northwest African varieties. While Standard Arabic can have only one consonant at the beginning of a syllable, after which a vowel must follow, Tunisian Arabic commonly has two consonants in the onset. For example, Standard Arabic &quot;book&quot; is كتاب , while in Tunisian Arabic it is ktāb.

The syllable nucleus may contain a short or long vowel, and at the end of the syllable, in the coda, it may have up to three consonants ما دخلتش ( &quot;I did not enter&quot;). Standard Arabic can have no more than two consonants in this position.

Word-internal syllables are generally heavy in that they either have a long vowel in the nucleus or consonant in the coda.

Non-final syllables composed of just a consonant and a short vowel (light syllables) are very rare, generally in loans from Standard Arabic. Short vowels in this position have generally been lost (Syncope), resulting in the many initial CC clusters. For example, جواب &quot;reply&quot; is a loan from Standard Arabic, but the same word has the natural development , which is the usual word for &quot;letter&quot;.

As well as those characteristics, Tunisian Arabic is also known for differently pronouncing words according to their orthography and position within a text. This phenomenon is known as pronunciation simplification and has four rules:
* [iː] and [ɪ], at the end of a word, are pronounced [i]. Also, [uː] and [u] are pronounced [u]. [aː], [ɛː], [a] and [æ] are pronounced [æ]. For example, yībdā is practically pronounced as 
* If a word finishes with a vowel and the next word begins with a short vowel, the short vowel and the space between the two words are not pronounced (Elision). The phenomenon is seen clearly when Arabic texts are compared to their Latin phonemic transliteration in several works. 
* If a word begins with two successive consonants, an epenthetic [ɪ] is added at the beginning.
* A sequence of three consonants, not followed by a vowel, is broken up with an epenthetic [ɪ] before the third consonant. For example: يكتب yiktib, يكتبوا yiktbū.

==Morphology==

Nouns and adjectives in Tunisian Arabic are classified into nouns that have a regular plural and nouns that have an irregular plural. Several nouns in Tunisian Arabic even have dual forms. Irregular or broken plurals are broadly similar to those of Standard Arabic. gender shift is achieved for singular nouns and adjectives by adding an -a suffix. However, this cannot occur for most plural nouns.

Tunisian Arabic has five types of pronouns: personal, possessive, demonstrative, indirect object and indefinite pronouns. Unlike in Standard Arabic, there is a unique pronoun for the second person singular and a unique pronoun for the second person in plural. Furthermore, there are three types of articles: definite, demonstrative and possessive articles. Most of them can be written before or after the noun.

As for verbs, they are conjugated in five tenses: perfective, imperfective, future, imperative, conditional present and conditional past Tenses and in four forms: affirmative, exclamative, interrogative and negative forms. They can be preceded by modal verbs to indicate a particular intention, situation, belief or obligation when they are conjugated in perfective or imperfective tenses. Questions in Tunisian Arabic can be āš (wh question) or īh/lā (yes–no question).

The question words for āš questions can be either a pronoun or an adverb. As for negation, it is usually done using the structure mā verb+š.

There are three types of nouns that can be derived from verbs: present participle, past participle and verbal noun. There are even nouns derived from simple verbs having the root fʿal or faʿlil. The same is true in Standard Arabic. Tunisian Arabic also involves several prepositions and conjunctions. These structures ultimately derive from those of Standard Arabic, even if they are radically different in modern Tunisian because of heavy influence from Berber, Latin and other European languages.

==Semantics and pragmatics==
Discourses in Tunisian Arabic are likely to use some rhetorical styles like metaphors. Furthermore, Tunisian Arabic styles and tenses hold several figurative meanings. For example, the use of past tense can mean that the situation is uncontrollable. As well, the use of the third person pronouns can be figurative to mean saints and/or supernatural beings and the use of demonstrative can have figurative meanings like underestimation. Moreover, the name of some parts of the body can be used in several expressions to get figurative meanings. That is entitled the embodiment.

Some structures like nouns and verbs have figurative meanings, and the use and the adoption of these figurative meanings depends on the circumstances of the discourse like the political situation of the country and the ages of the people participating in the discussion.

==International influences==
Several Tunisian words were used in the lyrics of some famous Arabic songs and poems like ʿaslāma of Majda Al Roumi. Furthermore, some famous Arabic singers were acknowledged for singing several old Tunisian Arabic songs like Hussain Al Jassmi and Dina Hayek. Tunisian Arabic influenced several Berber dialects by transferring to them several Arabic or Tunisian structures and words. It was as well the origin of Maltese and some of its words like Brīk and frīkasāy were inspired by French as loanwords. The Il-Ṭalyānī Tunisian Arabic word meaning &quot;the Italian&quot; () was used as a title of a novel in standard Arabic which received the Booker Prize for Arabic literature in 2015. Also, several prestigious television series from other Arabic countries like the Lebanese Cello Series involved a character talking in Tunisian Arabic.

<text>Sture Ragnar Bergwall (born 26 April 1950), also known as Thomas Quick from 1993–2002, is a Swedish man previously believed to have been a serial killer, having confessed to more than 30 murders while detained in a mental institution for personality disorders. Between 1994 and 2001, Quick was convicted of eight of these murders. However, he withdrew all of his confessions in 2008. As a result, his murder convictions were quashed, the final one in July 2013, and he was released from hospital. The episode raised issues about how murder convictions could have been obtained on such weak evidence, and has been called the largest miscarriage of justice in Swedish history. Journalists Hannes Råstam and Jenny Küttim and Dan Josefsson published TV documentaries and books about the murder cases; they claimed that bad therapy led to false confessions. Dan Josefsson claims that a &quot;cult&quot;-like group led by psychologist Margit Norell manipulated the police and talked Sture Bergwall into false confessions.

==Early life==
Bergwall grew up in Korsnäs with his six siblings. He adopted his mother&#x27;s maiden name, Quick, around 1991. After a history of criminal behavior (molestation of boys and various assaults and drug use), Quick was sentenced in 1991 for armed robbery. He also stabbed a man while in outpatient treatment from a psychiatric facility.

==Confessions and convictions of murder==

After the robbery conviction, Quick was confined to care in an institution for the criminally insane. During therapy, he confessed to more than thirty murders committed in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland between 1964 and 1993. The therapy sessions were followed by police interviews. One of his confessions led to the apparent solving of an 18-year-old murder considered to be unsolvable, and another to the apparent informal solving of a murder in Växjö in 1964. This 1964 crime was outside the then 25-year statute of limitations in Sweden, but with the information given by Quick, the case was considered closed.

With no eyewitnesses or technical forensic evidence to connect him to the crimes, Quick was convicted solely on the basis of his own confessions while undergoing recovered-memory therapy on benzodiazepines followed by police interrogations. Details in the confessions were wildly wrong and Quick relied on hints and body language from his interrogators to guess the answers expected of him. Bergwall/Quick had been researching unsolved murders on microfilm in the Royal Library, Stockholm when he was on day release. Consequently, his confession to a murder in Norway led to a Norwegian newspaper writing his story. Quick requested back copies including earlier reports of the story from Norwegian journalists that included details hitherto unknown to the Swedish police, leading them to believe that only the perpetrator knew them.

Nine-year-old Therese Johannessen had disappeared from Fjell in Drammen in 1988 and had never been found. Ten years later Quick was convicted of murdering her. The crucial evidence was the discovery of burnt bone fragments from what should have been a child. In 2012 laboratory tests showed that the supposed bone fragments were composed of wood and glue fused together – probably hardboard. An analysis had not been performed before the evidence was presented to the court.

Examination of his answers showed that his initial attempts to provide answers to questions concerning (for example) murder weapons and birthmarks were wrong, leading questions were asked in police interviews, and the initial erroneous guesses edited out of the version presented to the court.
The involvement of therapists meant that Quick&#x27;s early failure to provide anything more than a vague, confused and vacillating picture that gradually sharpened and focused was explained away as the result of repressed memories being retrieved as a result of therapy; e.g. in the judgment for the case of Therese one can read that the psychologist Christianson told the court that &quot;Traumatic events are retained in the memory but there can be protective mechanisms that work in the unconscious to repress their recall.&quot; Similar arguments about Quick&#x27;s &quot;repressed&quot; memories recur again and again in the judgments.

The credibility of Quick&#x27;s confessions was widely debated in the Swedish media. Critics of these confessions, and the trials, including a policeman involved in one of the investigations, wrote that there was no evidence that tied Quick to any of the murders he had confessed, and that until he could show something he had taken that belonged to one of his victims, the probability was that he was a compulsive liar. In a December 2008 television interview with Hannes Råstam, Quick denied taking part either in any of the murders for which he had been sentenced or in the more than 30 murders he had confessed to.

Because the only evidence to support the convictions were his own confessions, that he now retracted, and nothing else remained on which to base the judgments, Quick changed his lawyer and the eight murder convictions handed down in six trials were all quashed on appeal, the last one in July 2013. Quick, who now reverted to his birth name of Sture Bergwall, was released from custody after having been confined for more than twenty years in an institution for the criminally insane, with conditions that he refrain from alcohol and narcotics.

Between 1994 and 2001, Quick was convicted of eight murders (in chronological order) at six different District Court trials:
*Charles Zelmanovits, Piteå 1976, sentenced in 1994 – no forensic evidence, except for the confession. Sentence quashed: July 2013
*Johan Asplund, Sundsvall, 1980, sentenced in 2001 – no body, no forensics except for the confession. Sentence quashed: March 2012.
*The Stegehuis couple, Appojaure (Gällivare) 1984, sentenced in 1996 – no forensics, but Quick gave information regarding facts that had never been disclosed to the public. His confessions were later questioned, as Quick seemed to have been privy to all information before the trial – retrial granted by the Supreme Court. Sentence quashed: May 2013.
*Yenon Levi, tourist from Israel, Rörshyttan, 1988, sentenced in 1997 – no forensic evidence, but statements included in Quick&#x27;s testimony such as his incorrect guesses at the murder weapon (in the police interviews, Quick guessed a camping axe, a spade and a car jack before arriving at the correct answer – a wooden club). The incorrect guesses were not mentioned in court. Sentence quashed: September 2010.
*Therese Johannesen, Drammen, Norway, 1988, sentenced in 1998 – bone fragments presented as forensic evidence turned out to be hardboard. Sentence quashed: March 2011.
*Trine Jensen, Oslo, 1981, sentenced in 2000 – no forensic evidence. Sentence quashed: September 2012.
*Gry Storvik, Oslo, 1985 – no forensic evidence, confession; the semen found in the victim did not belong to Quick. Sentence quashed: September 2012.

In Sweden a defendant always gains access to the full police investigation prior to the trial. Quick&#x27;s lawyer Claes Borgström has been criticised for failing to protect his mentally disturbed client&#x27;s objective interest in being judged not guilty.

==Confessions and subsequent withdrawals==
In the years following 1990, when Quick was sentenced to closed psychiatric confinement, he confessed to several well publicised unsolved murders. His first murder, according to his own accounts, occurred in Växjö in 1964, when Quick was only 14 years old. The victim, Tomas Blomgren, was described by Quick as being the same age but not as strong and tall as himself. At the time of his confession, the murder was already subject to the statute of limitations which Bergwall/Quick later admitted was a reason for confessing; but later, it transpired that Quick had a watertight alibi. On the day of the murder he was attending his own confirmation with his family at the Pentecostal Church in Falun, almost 500 kilometers from Växjö where the murder took place.

The second alleged victim was Alvar Larsson, whom Quick claimed to have murdered at Sirkön in the lake Åsnen outside the town of Urshult. According to Quick&#x27;s sister, Quick never left Falun at the time of the murder.

The credibility of Quick&#x27;s confessions had been widely debated in the Swedish media since 1993, up until 2008, when Quick withdrew all of his confessions. There were consistent doubts about the reliability of his statements, and some of his confessions were proven to be fabrications; e.g. the two African refugees Quick confessed to murdering in Norway were found to be alive and well.

A DNA sample from a crime in Norway was subsequently found to be a mismatch, and there was no technical forensic evidence to link Quick to any of the crimes. Another dubious circumstance is the fact that no witnesses have ever testified to seeing Quick in the proximity of any of the crime scenes, even though more than 10,000 people were interviewed for intricate details. 

Critics of these confessions and the trials claim that Quick never murdered anyone, but that he is a compulsive liar. Among the critics are the parents of a child he confessed to having murdered in the late 1970s. In response to these accusations, Quick himself wrote an article for the Swedish newspaper &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; in 2001 in which he said that he refused to cooperate further with the authorities concerning all open murder investigations. 
In November 2006, Thomas Quick&#x27;s trials were reported to the Swedish Chancellor of Justice by retired lawyer Pelle Svensson on behalf of the parents of a murder victim who wished to have the trials declared invalid. Several principals in the fields of law and psychiatry, among them Swedish criminologist and television crime commentator Leif G. W. Persson and two police officers involved in the investigation of the murders who refused to involve themselves further in the investigations all claim that Quick has a history of mental illness, but it was unlikely he was guilty of any of the crimes to which he had confessed. The handling of the Quick cases has been described as the &quot;most scandalous&quot; chapter of Scandinavian crime history, branding it as glaring incompetence, naiveté, and opportunism within the police and judicial system.

Quick withdrew all of his confessions in 2008 during the recording of a TV documentary, made by prize-winning investigative journalist Hannes Råstam, who died shortly before his book version was published.

Quick&#x27;s attorney contended that the prosecution withheld important investigative material from the defence (which the prosecution adamantly denied). Quick&#x27;s attorney claimed that his client is mentally ill and was being given prescription drugs (benzodiazepine) when he confessed to the killings. These arguments were some of the grounds for quashing all the eight murder convictions in six trials and six appeals.

Thomas Quick, now having reverted to his birth name Sture Bergwall, recanted his confessions and requested the Svea Court of Appeal order a new trial for the murder case of Yenon Levi at Rörshyttan. In December 2009, the court of appeal granted a retrial of the Yenon Levi case. In the judgment, the court found that the lower court had heard that Quick correctly identified the murder weapon. However, information had been withheld from the court that initially Quick had made many erroneous attempts to identify the murder weapon before finally giving an account that corresponded with police findings.

Quick moved for a judgment of acquittal, and was acquitted in September 2010. Quick&#x27;s counsel also declared his intention to ask for a retrial of the Therese Johannesen case, claiming that Quick had an alibi for the day when Therese Johannesen was abducted and murdered. SKL (&quot;Statens Kriminaltekniska Laboratorium&quot; eng. National Swedish Laboratory of Forensic Science (Swedish National Forensic Centre)) found in March 2010 that two exhibits claimed by the prosecution to be bone fragments were, in fact, pieces of hardboard. A retrial was granted, and Quick formally acquitted when the prosecutor dropped the charges.

On 30 July 2013, Quick was acquitted of the last of eight murder convictions.

Sture Bergwall has been released from Säter&#x27;s institution for the criminally insane and most of the treatment plan has been made confidential and subject to secrecy. However, from the uncensored portions released to the press, it is apparent that Bergwall has not taken medication for several years and is assessed as not requiring any.

==Film and television==
A 2015 documentary film, &quot;The Confessions of Thomas Quick&quot;, recounted Bergwall&#x27;s life and his murder confessions and retractions, including interviews with Bergwall and other participants in the events. In it Bergwall explained that he made the confessions to gain attention due to profound loneliness. The documentary claims that Bergwall knew little about each murder, but was fed details during questioning, enabling him to build up enough information to persuade people he had carried them out. It also claims that as a result of his confessions Bergwall was given privileged treatment in the hospital, including drugs and therapy on demand, his own office with computer and Internet access, and restaurant meals when going out to visit murder sites, and that this may have encouraged him to continue confessing to more and more crimes.

A television drama series called &quot;Det som göms i snö&quot; (&quot;lit.&quot; What is Hidden in Snow) aired on Swedish television in 2018, directed by Kjell-Åke Andersson with Robert Gustafsson in the lead role as a police cold case investigator. Inspired by the Thomas Quick story, it was released in English in 2020 on various on-demand platforms as &quot;The Truth Will Out&quot;.

The Mikael Håfström thriller film &quot;The Perfect Patient&quot; premiered in Sweden in 2019, with David Dencik as Thomas Quick and Jonas Karlsson as the journalist Hannes Råstam.

<text>Guillermo Héctor Zúñiga Martínez (December 18, 1942 – April 23, 2015) was a Mexican politician and member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) who served in the Mexican Chamber of Deputies for the fifth district of Veracruz.

==Professional career==
Zúñiga founded and was the first president of the oratory institute &quot;Belisario Domínguez&quot; in his native Veracruz. He worked as a professor of history and civics at the &quot;Hidalgo&quot; junior high school, &quot;Erasmo Castellanos Quinto&quot; high school, at a Sephardic school, and at the National Youth Institute (INJUVE).

After finishing his law degree at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), he worked as a consulting lawyer in the Directorate of Legal Subjects of the Secretariat of the Interior, as a consulting lawyer in the Directorate of Legal Affairs of the Presidency and as the state director of education, the youngest ever, during the governorship of Rafael Hernández Ochoa. He updated the education law and created the Centers of Higher Studies of Rural Education, the Veracruz Pedagogical University and the Institute of Pedagogical Normalization.

He was appointed as the Minister of Education and Culture of Veracruz under Governor Fernando Gutiérrez Barrios and again under Patricio Chirinos Calero, and resigned to make what would be a successful run for municipal president of Xalapa, the state capital. He further continued his political career by serving as a local and federal Congressman. While in the local Congress, Zúñiga was the speaker of the congress, and president of the legislative branch of government in Veracruz. He served in the 56th Congress.

He managed the campaign of presidential candidate Roberto Madrazo in Veracruz and the gubernatorial campaign of Fidel Herrera. He also headed the state committee of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).

From 2011 until his death, he fought hard to create a new university in the state of Veracruz, named the (UPAV), and became its founding rector. However, the UPAV has been dogged with concerns about the validity of its degrees. In 2014, the Oaxaca state government warned that UPAV degrees were not valid outside of the state of Veracruz. In 2013, a group of UPAV alumni in Coatzacoalcos publicly claimed that since universities were not accepting UPAV degrees and coursework, the institution was defrauding students.

Zúñiga was survived by his wife Guillermina, and his children, Grecia María Zúñiga Pérez, Américo (the current municipal president of Xalapa), Guillermo and Anilú Zúñiga Martínez.

<doc id="1310493" wikidata="Q1569927" url="?curid=1310493" title="Hook echo">
<text>A hook echo is a pendant or hook-shaped weather radar signature as part of some supercell thunderstorms. It is found in the lower portions of a storm as air and precipitation flow into a mesocyclone, resulting in a curved feature of reflectivity. The echo is produced by rain, hail, or debris being wrapped around the supercell. It is one of the classic hallmarks of tornado-producing supercells. The National Weather Service may consider the presence of a hook echo coinciding with a tornado vortex signature as sufficient to justify issuing a tornado warning.

==History==

Because of the unpredictable and potentially catastrophic nature of tornadoes, the possibility of detecting tornadoes via radar was discussed in the meteorological community in the earliest days of meteorological radar. The first association between tornadoes and the hook echo was discovered by E.M. Brooks in 1949. Brooks noted circulations with radii of approximately 8–16 km on radar. These circulations were associated with supercell thunderstorms and were dubbed “tornado cyclones” by Brooks.

The first documented association between a hook echo and a confirmed tornado occurred near Champaign–Urbana, Illinois, on 9 April 1953. This event was unintentionally discovered by Illinois State Water Survey electrical engineer Donald Staggs.
Staggs was repairing and testing an experimental precipitation measurement radar unit when he noticed an unusual radar echo which was associated with a nearby thunderstorm. The unusual echo appeared to be an area of precipitation in the shape of the number six - hence the modern term “hook echo”. Staggs chose to record the echo for further analysis by meteorologists. Upon review of the unusual echo data, meteorologists F.A. Huff, H.W. Heiser, and S.G. Bigler determined that a destructive tornado had occurred in the geographical location which corresponded with the &quot;six-shaped&quot; echo seen on radar.

Prominent severe storm researcher Ted Fujita also documented hook echoes with various supercell thunderstorms which occurred on 9 April 1953 - the same day as the Huff et al. discovery. After detailed study of the evolution of hook echoes, Fujita hypothesized that certain strong thunderstorms may be capable of rotation.

J.R. Fulks developed the first hypothesis on the formation of hook echoes in 1962. Fulks analyzed wind velocity data from Doppler weather radar units which were installed in Central Oklahoma in 1960. Doppler data on wind velocity during thunderstorms demonstrated an association between strong horizontal wind shear and mesocyclones, which were identified as having the potential to produce tornadoes.

== Interpretation ==

Hook echoes are a reflection of the movement of air inside and around a supercell thunderstorm. Ahead of the base of the storm, the inflow from the environment is sucked in by the instability of the air mass. As it moves upward, it cools slower than the cloud environment, because it mixes very little with it, creating an echo free tube which ends at higher levels to form a bounded weak echo region or BWER. At the same time, a mid-level flow of cool and drier air enters the thunderstorm cloud. Because it is drier than the environment, it is more dense and sinks down behind the cloud and forms the rear flank downdraft, drying the mid-level portion of the back of the cloud. The two currents form a vertical windshear, which then develops rotation and can further interact to form a mesocyclone. Tightening of the rotation near the surface may create a tornado.
Near the interaction zone at the surface, there will be a dry slot caused by the updraft on one side and the cloudy area below the rear flank downdraft on the other side. This is the source of the hook echo seen on radar near the surface. Hook echoes are thus a relatively reliable indicator of tornadic activity; however, they merely indicate the presence of a larger mesocyclone structure in the tornadic storm rather than directly detecting a tornado. During some destructive tornadoes, debris lofted from the surface may be detected as a &quot;debris ball&quot; on the end of the hook structure. Not all thunderstorms exhibiting hook echoes produce tornadoes, and not all tornado-producing supercells contain hook echoes.

The use of Doppler weather radar systems, such as NEXRAD, allows for the detection of strong, low-level mesocyclones that produce tornadoes even when the hook echo is not present and also grant greater certainty when a hook echo is present. By detecting hydrometeors moving toward and away from the radar location, the relative velocities of air flowing within different parts of a storm are revealed. These areas of tight rotation known as &quot;velocity couplets&quot; are now the primary trigger for the issuance of a tornado warning. The tornado vortex signature is an algorithm-based detection of this.

== Observational limitation ==

Hook echoes are not always obvious. Particularly in the Southern United States, thunderstorms tend to take on a structure of more precipitation surrounding a mesocyclone, which leads to the high precipitation (HP) variation supercell that obscures the hook shape. HP supercells instead often have a high reflectivity pendant or front flank notch (FFN), appearing like a &quot;kidney bean&quot; shape. Another limiting factor is radar resolution. Prior to 2008, NEXRAD had a range resolution of 1,000 meters, while the processes which lead to a hook echo happen on a smaller scale.

<text>The T-56 six speed manual transmission has been used in a wide range of vehicles from General Motors, Dodge, and Ford Motor Company. The transmission was originally designed and built by BorgWarner for the Dodge Viper later being used by GM in 1992 for the generation II and later engines, but from 1998 was built by Tremec, though nothing changed internally. The T-56 has been succeeded by the Tremec TR-6060 transmission in many former T-56 applications, as well as applications requiring greater strength than the T-56 could offer.

== Applications ==
*Aston Martin DB7 Vantage, 1999–2003
*Aston Martin V12 Vanquish, 2001–2006
*Chevrolet Corvette, 1997–2007
*Chevrolet Camaro Z28/SS, 1993–2002
*Pontiac Firebird Formula/Trans Am,1993–2002
*Dodge Ram SRT10, 2004–2006

== Features ==
The transmission uses a hydraulic clutch, except for the Cobra which was mechanical. The Cobra had an 11-inch clutch disc. The entire case, including the bell housing, is made of aluminum. The T-56 has a synchromesh made up of brass synchros for the GM and Ford applications, and stainless steel in the Dodge application. The transmission also features internal stops which render stopbolts on the shifter mechanism unnecessary.

<text>Bouchain (; ) is a commune in the Nord department in northern France.

It lies halfway between Cambrai and Valenciennes. Bouchain, seat of the early medieval County of Ostrevent, was taken by Arnulf I, Count of Flanders, in the 10th century and eventually subsumed into the County of Hainaut.

During the War of the Spanish Succession, when the town was fortified, Bouchain was besieged twice. On 12 September 1711 it was seized from the French after a 34 day siege by the Grand Alliance led by the Duke of Marlborough. It was again besieged, and recaptured by French forces, on 19 October 1712 after an 18 day siege.

<doc id="1310511" wikidata="Q4697190" url="?curid=1310511" title="Aimé Adam">
<text>Aimé Raleigh (Pete) Adam (December 5, 1913 – January 7, 2009) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1971 to 1986, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Howard Pawley.

Adam was born in Radville, Saskatchewan, the son of Lionel and Marcella Adam. His nickname &quot;Pete&quot; came from his mother&#x27;s French name for him: &quot;petit&quot; (small). While he was still young, his family moved to Toutes Aides, Manitoba and later to Crane River. In 1937, he married Mary Didychuk. After they married, the couple moved to Winnipeg, where Adam worked for the Canadian National Railway. He later returned to Crane River to help his father. In 1949, Adam opened an International Harvester farm implement dealership with his brother at Ste. Rose du Lac. In 1961, he began farming and ranching near Ochre River. He was a charter member of the National Farmers Union and served as president of its Local 509.

He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in a 1971 by-election in the rural riding of Ste. Rose, called after the sitting MLA, former Liberal leader Gildas Molgat, was appointed to the Senate of Canada. Although the NDP had never won the seat before, Adam scored a convincing victory over his Liberal and Progressive Conservative opponents, and provided Edward Schreyer&#x27;s government with a functioning majority. He was easily re-elected in the election of 1973, although he was not appointed to Schreyer&#x27;s cabinet.

Adam was again re-elected in the 1977 election, which was won by the Tories under Sterling Lyon. In early 1979, he supported Howard Pawley&#x27;s bid to replace Schreyer as interim leader of the party.

The NDP under Pawley returned to government in the election of 1981, although Adam ironically faced the toughest re-election challenge of his career, defeating Progressive Conservative candidate Ivan Traill by fewer than 200 votes. It may be noted that there was no Liberal candidate in this race and that most traditionally Liberal voters in rural Manitoba had shifted to the Progressive Conservatives by this time.

Despite being almost seventy years old, Adam was appointed Minister of Municipal Affairs and Minister of Cooperative Development on November 30, 1981. He was relieved of the latter position on August 20, 1982, and of the former on November 4, 1983, when he was named Minister of Government Services in a cabinet shuffle. Adam left cabinet entirely on January 30, 1985, and did not seek re-election in 1986.

Adam was a prominent defender of Canada&#x27;s &quot;Western Grain Transportation Act&quot; (sometimes called the &quot;Crow Benefit&quot;), a subsidy which covered transportation costs for farmers shipping wheat. On one occasion, he printed off a series of buttons with the slogan, &quot;Save the Crow&quot;.

After he retired, Adam moved to Dauphin, Manitoba. He died there at the age of 95.

<doc id="1310512" wikidata="Q275950" url="?curid=1310512" title="Resident Evil 4">
<text>Resident Evil 4 is a 2005 survival horror game developed and published by Capcom for the GameCube. Players control the special agent Leon S. Kennedy on a mission to rescue the US president&#x27;s daughter, Ashley Graham, who has been kidnapped by a religious cult in rural Spain. Leon fights hordes of enemies infected by a mind-controlling parasite and reunites with the spy Ada Wong. In a departure from the fixed camera angles and slower gameplay of previous &quot;Resident Evil&quot; games, &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; features a dynamic camera system and action-oriented gameplay.

Development on &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; began for the PlayStation 2 in 1999. Four proposed versions were discarded; the first was directed by Hideki Kamiya, but series creator Shinji Mikami felt it was too great a departure from the previous games, so it was spun off as &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; (2001). Other versions were scrapped until Mikami took directorial duties for what became the final version. The game was announced as part of the Capcom Five, a collaboration between Capcom and Nintendo to create five exclusives for the GameCube.

&quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; garnered acclaim for its story, gameplay, graphics, voice acting, and characters, and is cited as one of the best video games of all time, winning multiple Game of the Year awards in 2005. It was ported to numerous formats, and became a cross-platform hit, selling 12.3 million units by December 2022. It influenced the evolution of the survival horror and third-person genres, popularizing the &quot;over-the-shoulder&quot; third-person view used in games such as &quot;Gears of War&quot;, &quot;Dead Space&quot;, and &quot;The Last of Us&quot;. Its successor, &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot;, was released in 2009. A remake of &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; was released in 2023.

==Gameplay==
The player controls the protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy, from a third-person perspective. Departing significantly from the series&#x27; previous games, the gameplay focuses on action and shootouts with fewer survival horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms; instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up, or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, and shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons. Players can also shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.

&quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; adds context-sensitive controls. Based on the situation, players can interact with the environment: kicking down a ladder, jumping out of a window, dodging an attack or executing a &quot;finishing move&quot; on weakened enemies. There are also quick time events, in which the player must press buttons indicated on-screen to execute actions such as dodging a falling boulder or wrestling an enemy to stay alive. These are often incorporated into the game&#x27;s many boss fights, in which the player must avoid instant-kill attacks.

The main enemies are violent villagers referred to as Los Ganados (&quot;The Cattle&quot; in Spanish). Unlike the franchise&#x27;s traditional zombies, they can dodge, wield weaponry like chainsaws and projectile weapons, and are capable of working collectively and communicating with each other. The villagers&#x27; leaders may transform into grotesque monstrous forms to do battle with the player when encountered. Other prominent enemies include the Regeneradors, a type of mutated humanoid creature with potent regenerative abilities; the troll-like El Gigante; and the gigantic sea creature Del Lago.

The inventory system features a grid system, represented by an attaché case, that has each item take up a certain number of spaces. The case can be upgraded several times, allowing for more space. Weapons, ammunition, and healing items are kept in the case, while key items and treasures are kept in a separate menu. Items may be bought from and sold to a merchant that appears in various locations. He sells first aid sprays, weapons, allows for weapons to be upgraded and buys various treasures that Leon finds. The various weapons each have their own advantages and disadvantages.

Capcom added content for the PlayStation 2 version, which was later incorporated into the PC and Wii releases. The largest addition is &quot;Separate Ways&quot;, a side story which focuses on Ada Wong&#x27;s involvement in &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; and her connection to the series&#x27; villain Albert Wesker. &quot;Ada&#x27;s Report&quot;, a five-part documentary, analyzes Ada&#x27;s relationship with Wesker and his role in the plot. Other unlockable content in all versions includes the minigame &quot;The Mercenaries&quot; and short scenario &quot;Assignment Ada&quot; (using Ada to retrieve Las Plagas samples), new costumes for Leon and Ashley, new weapons, and a cutscene browser.

==Plot==
In 2004, U.S. government agent Leon S. Kennedy (Paul Mercier) is on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham (Carolyn Lawrence), the U.S. President&#x27;s daughter, who has been abducted by a mysterious cult. He travels to an unnamed rural village in Spain, where he encounters a group of hostile villagers who pledge their lives to Los Iluminados, the cult that kidnapped Ashley. The villagers were once simple farmers until becoming infected by a mind-controlling parasite known as &quot;Las Plagas&quot;.

While in the village, Leon is captured by its chief, Bitores Mendez, and injected with Las Plagas. He finds himself held captive with Luis Sera (Rino Romano), a former police officer in Madrid, and former Los Iluminados researcher. The two work together to escape, but soon go their separate ways. Leon finds out Ashley is being held in a church and rescues her. They both escape from the church after Osmund Saddler (Michael Gough), leader of the cult, reveals his plan to use the parasite they injected into Ashley to manipulate her into injecting the president of the United States with a &quot;sample&quot; once she returns home, allowing Saddler to begin his conquest of the world.

After killing Mendez, Leon and Ashley try to take refuge in a castle but are attacked by more &quot;Iluminados&quot; under the command of Ramon Salazar (Rene Mujica), another of Saddler&#x27;s henchmen who owns the castle, and the two become separated by Salazar&#x27;s traps. Meanwhile, Luis searches for pills that will slow Leon and Ashley&#x27;s infection, as well as a sample of &quot;Las Plagas&quot;. He brings the two items to Leon but is killed by Saddler, who takes the sample, while the pills to suppress the infection remain in Leon&#x27;s hands. While in the castle, Leon briefly encounters Ada Wong (Sally Cahill), a woman from his past who supports him during his mission. He battles his way through the castle before killing Salazar.

Afterward, Leon travels to a nearby island research facility, where he continues the search for Ashley. He discovers that one of his former training comrades, Jack Krauser (Jim Ward), who was believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior, is responsible for her kidnapping in an attempt to get close enough to Saddler to steal his new Plagas sample. Ada and Krauser are working with Albert Wesker (Richard Waugh), for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample, though Krauser is suspicious of Ada. Suspicious of the mercenary&#x27;s intentions, Saddler orders Krauser to kill Leon, believing that no matter which one dies, he will benefit. After Krauser&#x27;s defeat, Leon rescues Ashley, and they remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon confronts Saddler, and with Ada&#x27;s help, manages to kill him. However, Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before escaping in a helicopter, leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her jet-ski as the island explodes.

==Development==
In 1999, producer Shinji Mikami said a &quot;Resident Evil&quot; sequel was in development for PlayStation 2. &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; underwent a lengthy development, during which at least four versions of the game were discarded. The first version was directed by Hideki Kamiya. Around the turn of the millennium, &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; writer Noboru Sugimura created a story for the game, based on Kamiya&#x27;s idea to make a &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;stylish&quot; action game. The story was based on unraveling the mystery surrounding the body of the protagonist, Tony, an invincible man with skills and an intellect exceeding that of normal people, with his superhuman abilities explained with biotechnology. As Kamiya felt the playable character did not look brave and heroic enough in battles from a fixed angle, he decided to drop the prerendered backgrounds from previous installments and use a dynamic camera system. The team spent 11 days in the United Kingdom and Spain, photographing objects such as Gothic statues, bricks, and stone pavements for use in textures.

Though the developers tried to make the &quot;coolness&quot; theme fit into the world of &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, Mikami felt it strayed too far from the series&#x27; survival horror roots and gradually convinced the staff to make an independent game. This became a new Capcom franchise, &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;, released for the PlayStation 2 in August 2001.

=== &quot;Fog&quot; version ===
Development on &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; restarted at the end of 2001. The first announcement was made in November 2002, as one of five games developed exclusively for the GameCube by Capcom Production Studio 4, the Capcom Five. This revision, commonly dubbed the &quot;fog version&quot;, was directed by Hiroshi Shibata and was 40 percent finished at that time. The game saw Leon S. Kennedy struggling to survive after having infiltrated Umbrella&#x27;s castle-like main headquarters located in Europe and featured traditional &quot;Resident Evil&quot; monsters such as zombies. During the course of the new story which was again written by Sugimura&#x27;s scenario creation company Flagship, Leon became infected with the Progenitor Virus and possessed a hidden power in his left hand. The producer of the final version also pointed out that Ashley did not appear back then, though there was a different girl who was never revealed to the public. The game was to feature some first-person elements.

=== &quot;Hook Man&quot; version ===
At E3 2003, Capcom showcased a version widely known as the &quot;hook man version&quot;. It was later titled on the &quot;Biohazard 4 Secret DVD&quot;. During Mikami&#x27;s introduction of the trailer, he assured that development was proceeding smoothly and claimed the game was scarier than ever before. The story was set in a haunted building where Leon contracted a bizarre disease and fought paranormal enemies, such as animated suits of armor, living dolls, and a ghostlike man armed with a large hook. The game had an otherworldly feel to it, containing elements like flashbacks and hallucinations that were marked by a bluish tint and a shaking camera. It also displayed various gameplay mechanics that carried over to the final release, like the over-the-shoulder camera, a laser sight for aiming in battles and quick time events. Other features, such as dialogue choices, were removed later. Five minutes of gameplay footage were released on the &quot;Biohazard 4 Secret DVD&quot;, a Japanese pre-order bonus given out in January 2005.

===&quot;Hallucination&quot; version===
The Hallucination version had only a basic story concept, having dropped the previous scenario penned by Noboru Sugimura of Flagship. In 2012, &quot;Resident Evil 3: Nemesis&quot; scenario writer Yasuhisa Kawamura said he was responsible for this version, as he wanted to make &quot;Biohazard 4&quot; scarier &quot;and suggested using a particular scene from the film &quot;Lost Souls&quot;, where the main character [...] suddenly finds herself in a derelict building with a killer on the loose. An arranged version of this idea eventually turned into Hook Man. The idea went through several iterations as Mr. Sugimura and I carefully refined this world (which, I have to say, was very romantic). Leon infiltrates the castle of Spencer seeking the truth, while inside a laboratory located deep within, a young girl wakes up. Accompanied by a B.O.W. [an abbreviation for &quot;Bio Organic Weapon&quot; in the series&#x27; lore] dog, the two start to make their way up the castle. Unfortunately, there were many obstacles that needed to be overcome and the cost of development was deemed too expensive.&quot; Kawamura added he was very sorry and &quot;even ashamed&quot; that Mikami had to step in and scrap this version. After this attempt, the last cancelled revision featured classic zombies again. However, it was discontinued after a few months, and before it was ever shown to the public, as the developers felt it was too formulaic.

The story of the Progenitor Virus was eventually covered in &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot; and the Spencer Estate became the setting for &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot;″s downloadable content (DLC) pack &quot;Lost in Nightmares&quot; (featuring Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine).

===Final version===
It was decided to reinvent the series. Mikami took over directorial duties from Shibata and began working on the version that was released. In an interview with &quot;Game Informer&quot;, Mikami explained his decision to shift to a new gameplay system is due to the feeling that the older system is &quot;more of the same&quot; after playing &quot;Resident Evil Zero&quot;. He says that he only felt nervous once more when playing with the newer system. Speaking for the team, game producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi mentioned how the staff was &quot;tired of the same thing&quot; and how some got bored and moved on to other projects. In addition to that, the producer also felt that the older format was &quot;stuck in a cookie cutter mold&quot; and described it as &quot;shackles holding us down&quot;.

However, some of the staff members disagreed about changing the gameplay system. These members felt depressed and were hard to motivate after the game&#x27;s focus shifted to be more action-oriented. Although Mikami demanded the camera system be revised, the team had reservations about making big changes to the series he had created. Eventually, he intervened, explained his proposed changes, and wrote a new story that, unlike previous installments, was not centered on the company Umbrella. Mikami wrote the entire story in just three weeks due to time constraints. Inspired by &quot;Onimusha 3: Demon Siege&quot;, a game Mikami had enjoyed playing but felt could have been better with a different view, he decided to place the camera behind the playable character. To go along with the new gameplay and story, a new type of enemy called &quot;Ganado&quot; was created, as opposed to using the undead creatures from previous &quot;Resident Evil&quot; games. Furthermore, producers expended additional detail to modify and update characters that had previously appeared in the series. In a documentary explaining the conception of the characters, Kamiya stated he intended to make Leon Kennedy &quot;look tougher, but also cool&quot;.

Kobayashi was responsible for the design of some of the final game&#x27;s enemies, such as the Regenerators. Kobayashi described the creatures&#x27; origins within universe lore as byproducts of Los Iluminados&#x27; research into bio organic weapons, malformed creations implanted with multiple &quot;Plaga&quot; parasites during the experimentation process. Regenerators are designed to take distinct heavy breaths before they are seen, which alerts the player to their presence. When encountered, often in small confined spaces, they would walk slowly towards the player character. The Regenerator is capable of continuously regenerating itself and cannot easily be dispatched unless the player is able to find the &quot;Plaga&quot; parasites within its body, which can only be seen with the infrared scope, and specifically target them first. During an interview with Famitsu, Mikami explained that elements like the Regenerators help maintain the survival horror aspect of &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; as a balance between a &quot;scary kind of gameplay and the challenge of overcoming that fear&quot;, with the goal of giving players a sense of achievement when they manage to overcome the monster.

The English voice actors recorded their parts in four sessions, over three to four months. Capcom assigned Shinsaku Ohara as script translator and voice over coordinator. Carolyn Lawrence, who provided the voice for Ashley Graham, described her character as &quot;vulnerable, because Leon has to come to her rescue all the time&quot;. She also described Kennedy&#x27;s character as &quot;more brawn, perhaps, than brain&quot;. In addition to the voice acting, the game&#x27;s designer detailed each cinematic sequence so that each character&#x27;s facial expressions matched the tone of their voice actor.

Along with &quot;Resident Evil: Dead Aim&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil Outbreak&quot;, two side story games that did not fall under the exclusive policy, it was announced on October 31, 2004 that &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; would come to the PlayStation 2 in 2005, citing increased profit, changing market conditions, and increased consumer satisfaction as the key reasons. The PlayStation 2 version included new features, primarily a new sub-game featuring Ada Wong. On February 1, 2006, Ubisoft announced that they would be publishing the game on the PC for Windows. On April 4, 2007, a Wii version was announced and was launched later in the year. The game features all of the extras in the PS2 version, along with other additions, including a trailer for &quot;Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles&quot;.

==Release==
The original version for the GameCube featured two different collector&#x27;s editions. The first was available as a pre-order that included the game, the &quot;Prologue&quot; art book, and a T-shirt. GameStop offered another limited edition that was packaged in a tin box with the art book, a cel of Leon, and a soundtrack CD. Australia received an exclusive collector&#x27;s edition that came with the game and a bonus disc with interviews and creator&#x27;s footage. Nintendo handled marketing sales and distribution of the title in Europe and Australia.

===Ports===
&quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; was ported to the PlayStation 2 after Capcom stated that it did not fall under the exclusivity deal with Nintendo. It was released in North America on October 25, 2005. The largest addition is &quot;Separate Ways&quot;, a new scenario for Ada written by Haruo Murata. According to producer Masachika Kawata, the Separate Ways campaign was something thought up by the PS2 porting team and was added after getting approval from Shinji Mikami. The PlayStation 2 version featured two standard and collector&#x27;s bundles from pre-orders. The standard package included the game and a T-shirt, while the collector&#x27;s bundle also included a figurine of Leon, and the soundtrack &quot;Biohazard Sound Chronicle Best Track Box&quot;. This quickly sold out, and a second pressing was released that included an Ada figurine. Another, called the &quot;Resident Evil 4: Premium Edition&quot;, was packaged in a SteelBook media case, along with the art book, a documentary DVD, and a cel art of Ada.

A PC port of &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; developed by Sourcenext was released in Hong Kong on February 1, 2007, published by Typhoon Games. It was released in Europe, North America, and Australia in March 2007 and was published by Ubisoft. The port contains the bonus features from the PS2 version, such as &quot;Separate Ways&quot;, the P.R.L. 412 laser cannon and a second set of unlockable costumes for Leon and Ashley, as well as an Easy difficulty level. It also supports multiple widescreen resolutions. The shadow and lighting problems were fixed in the only patch, Version 1.10.

&quot;Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition&quot; was released for the Wii on May 31, 2007 in Japan and on June 19, 2007 in the United States. It features updated controls that utilize the pointing and motion-sensing abilities of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, though both the GameCube controller and the Classic Controller are also supported. The Wii Remote is able to aim and shoot anywhere on the screen with a reticle that replaces the laser sight found in the other versions, and motion-based gestures are used to perform some context-sensitive actions, such as dodging or slashing. The &quot;Wii Edition&quot; also includes the extra content from the PS2 and PC versions, and a trailer for &quot;Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles&quot;. The &quot;Wii Edition&quot; became available for download from the Wii U&#x27;s Nintendo eShop in Europe on October 29, 2015.

&quot;Resident Evil 4: Mobile Edition&quot; was released in Japan for au&#x27;s BREW 4.0 on February 1, 2008. It was announced by Capcom at TGS 2007. Differences from the original include changing the flow of the story from being continuous to being divided into sections such as &quot;Village&quot;, &quot;Ravene&quot;, &quot;Fortress&quot; and &quot;Subterranean Tunnel&quot;. There is also a more challenging Mercenary Mode. The game uses the MascotCapsule eruption engine and was adapted to the Zeebo and iOS platforms. On July 13, 2009, without any formal announcement, &quot;Resident Evil 4: Mobile Edition&quot; was released by Capcom for the iOS platform via the App Store in Japan, but was quickly removed, though some players were able to purchase and download it. The game has since been released in Japan and North America. Later, Capcom made an update that had different difficulty levels and high scores. Capcom released a new separate version called &quot;Resident Evil 4 for Beginners&quot;, which offers the first two levels (three counting a training level) of both Story Mode and Mercenary Mode. However, the rest of the levels are available for purchase in-game as downloadable content. Due to the release of the iPad, Capcom recreated the iPhone version of &quot;Resident Evil 4: Mobile Edition&quot; and updated it to HD graphics as &quot;Resident Evil 4: iPad Edition&quot;.

On March 23, 2011, high-definition remastered versions of both &quot;Resident Evil – Code: Veronica&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; were announced to be in development for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, as part of the &quot;Resident Evil: Revival Selection&quot; series. The ports feature all the bonus content from the previous releases, including &quot;Separate Ways&quot;. On July 23, 2011, Capcom announced at Comic-Con 2011 that &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; would be released on September 20, 2011 for the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Games on Demand. In Japan, &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil - Code: Veronica&quot; were released on a single disc with the title &quot;Biohazard Revival Selection&quot; on September 8, 2011. For North America and Europe, both games, including &quot;Resident Evil 4 HD&quot;, were only released as downloads on Xbox Live Games on Demand and PlayStation Network. On February 27, 2014, Capcom released &quot;Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition&quot; for Windows. The port features improved graphics and many other enhancements that were included in &quot;Resident Evil 4 HD&quot;. &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; was re-released on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on August 30, 2016.

In April 2013, &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; was released on Android, but outside of Japan, it is exclusive to Samsung through Samsung Galaxy Store.

Capcom announced in October 2018 that &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; would be published for the Nintendo Switch sometime in 2019, along with releases of &quot;Resident Evil&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil Zero&quot;.

In October 2021, Capcom released a virtual reality (VR) version of &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; for the Oculus Quest 2. Developed by the American Armature Studio, many elements of gameplay like combat and inventory management were changed to accommodate VR. This version, which runs on Unreal Engine 4, also includes redesigned textures with increased resolution. The developers and executive producer Tom Ivey stated that there were changes made to &quot;update the game for a modern audience&quot;, and a number of in-game animations (such as the animation triggered when players attempted to look up Ashley&#x27;s skirt), dialogue and flirtatious banter between characters were removed.

===Merchandise===
&quot;Biohazard 4 Original Soundtrack&quot; was released in Japan on December 22, 2005. It contains 62 compositions from the game and the 48-page &quot;Visual Booklet&quot; with liner notes from composers Shusaku Uchiyama and Misao Senbongi. Other merchandise included figures by McFarlane Toys, NECA and Hot Toys. Agatsuma Entertainment has also created various miniature collectibles based on several main characters and enemies from &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;. Two special controllers designed to resemble chainsaws were designed by NubyTech for use with the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions.

==Reception==
===Reviews===

The GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions of &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; have a score of 96/100 on Metacritic, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. These versions have the top ranking on Metacritic&#x27;s list of the Best Video Games for 2005. In addition to the gameplay, the characters and story received positive commentary, leading to the finished product being deemed by most as one of the best video games ever made. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Greg Kasavin praised the voice acting, but claimed that it was betrayed by &quot;some uncharacteristically goofy dialogue&quot;. &quot;Yahoo! Games&quot;″ Adam Pavlacka and &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Kevin VanOrd acclaimed Capcom for adding great amounts of detail to the characters. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Matt Casamassina went into further detail in his review for &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;, praising not only the detailed character design but also the fight choreography and three-dimensional modeling within cinematic sequences. Casamassina also complimented the voice actors, especially Paul Mercier (Leon), commenting, &quot;For once, the characters are believable because Capcom has hired competent actors to supply their voices. Leon in particular is very well produced&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; specifically recognized &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;″s character design and voice acting. The increased variety of weapons has been praised by gaming publications such as &quot;GamePro&quot; and &quot;Game Over Online&quot;. G4 TV show &quot;X-Play&quot; gave it a 5 out of 5, for introducing a new style of gameplay for the series as well as incorporating moments where the player would have to interact with the cut scenes. Not long after, it was awarded as the best game ever reviewed on the show. The makers of &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; worked on various innovations associated with the use and inventory of weapons. &quot;Game Over&quot; stated that players can use the vast array of weapons to &quot;go for headshots now&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot; stated that ammunition is more plentiful in &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; than in other games in the series, making it more action-oriented.

The ratings of the PC port, along with the &quot;Ultimate HD Edition&quot; release, were not as high as for the other versions. The original PC port was criticized for no mouse support and frustrating keyboard controls, low-quality FMV cut scenes, and choppy lightning graphics rendering. Despite these problems, it received generally positive reviews from critics, including &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;GameSpot&quot;, which praised the gameplay, character models and environments, and sound design. &quot;GameRevolution&quot; referred to the game&#x27;s &quot;Ultimate HD Edition&quot; as &quot;a bare-bones port of a nonetheless spectacular game&quot;, noting &quot;minor superficial alterations&quot; similar to the 2007 PC port and asserting that the true &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot; of &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; is the Wii version. Japanese game magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; reviewed the Wii version, with two editors giving it a perfect 10 score, and the remaining pair giving it a 9, resulting in a score of 38 out of 40. The reviewers felt that the new controls offer something fresh. Multiple reviewers agreed that even those who own the original will find something fun and enjoyable in this version. British magazine &quot;NGamer&quot; gave the &quot;Wii Edition&quot; a score of 96%, slightly lower than the 97% given to the GameCube version. They praised the visuals, controls, and features and commented on the fact that such an &quot;exceptional package&quot; was on sale for a low price; however, when writing about the Wii controls, they said, &quot;if you&#x27;ve played the GC version this won&#x27;t be as special&quot;. &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; gave the Wii version 94%, 3% less than the original due to it simply not having the same impact it did back then. In 2009, they went on to place the game 9th on a list of the greatest Nintendo games of all time. &quot;IGN&quot; praised the Wii version, stating it is the superior edition, but does not push the Wii like it did with GameCube and PS2. &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the new controls of the &quot;Wii Edition&quot; but commented on the lack of exclusive Wii features. &quot;Hyper&quot;″s Jonti Davies commended &quot;Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition&quot; for its &quot;visual improvements&quot; but criticized it for having &quot;no new content&quot;. The PS3 version of &quot;Resident Evil 4 HD&quot; received a score of 9.0 from &quot;Destructoid&quot;, which called it &quot;a hallmark of excellence&quot;. In their October 2013 issue, &quot;Edge&quot; retroactively awarded it ten out of ten.

===Awards===
&quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; was named Game of the Year by multiple publications, including &quot;Edge&quot;, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, &quot;GameTrailers&quot;, &quot;Game Informer&quot;, &quot;GamePro&quot;, &quot;GameRevolution&quot;, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, and &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; is considered one of the best video games of all time. It is included in the &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot; book. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; ranked it as number one in their list of the top 25 best GameCube games of all time in 2005 and also ranked it second on their list of the best games of the 2000s in 2010. In 2008, &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; was ranked first place in the list of the best video games of all time according to the readers of &quot;IGN&quot;, and sixth place in the list of the best PlayStation 2 games of all time according to the &quot;IGN&quot; staff. In 2021, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked the game as the 40th best game of all time. In 2009, &quot;Game Informer&quot; ranked &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; number one on their list of top GameCube games and number three on their list of top PlayStation 2 games. In 2022, &quot;Complex&quot; magazine named it the tenth-best PlayStation 2 game of all time. &quot;GamePro&quot; ranked it as the second best game for the PS2. In 2010, the readers of &quot;PlayStation Official Magazine&quot; voted it the 10th greatest PlayStation game. In 2007, &quot;Edge&quot; ranked the game at second place in its list of top games of all time, behind only &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;. That same year, &quot;G4&quot; named it the 21st top video game of all time, calling it &quot;a modern horror masterpiece.&quot; In 2015, it placed 7th on USgamer&#x27;s The 15 Best Games Since 2000 list. In early 2006, in their 200th issue, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; ranked it in second place in their Top 200 Games of all-time list, also behind only &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;.

&quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; is regarded as one of the most influential games of the 2000s, particularly due to its influence in redefining the third-person shooter genre by introducing offset camera angles that do not obscure action. The new gameplay alterations and immersive style appealed to many not previously familiar with the series. The over-the-shoulder viewpoint introduced in &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; has later become standard in third-person shooters and action games, including titles ranging from &quot;Gears of War&quot; to &quot;&quot;. It has also become a standard &quot;precision aim&quot; feature for third-person action games in general, with examples including &quot;Dead Space&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank Future&quot;, &quot;Fallout&quot;, &quot;Uncharted&quot;, &quot;Mass Effect&quot; and &quot;The Last of Us&quot;. In 2019, &quot;Game Informer&quot; called &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; &quot;the most important third-person shooter ever&quot; and said it &quot;innovated two genres&quot;, inspiring developers of both survival horror and shooter games.

&quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; redefined the survival horror genre by emphasizing reflexes and precision aiming, thus broadening the gameplay of the series with elements from the wider action game genre. However, this also led some reviewers to suggest that the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series had abandoned the survival horror genre, by demolishing the genre conventions that it had established. Other major survival horror series followed suit, by developing their combat systems to feature more action, such as &quot;Silent Hill: Homecoming&quot; and the 2008 version of &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot;. These changes represent an overall trend among console games shifting towards visceral action gameplay.

While working on &quot;The Last of Us&quot;, Naughty Dog took cues from &quot;Resident Evil 4,&quot; particularly the tension and action. &quot;Dead Space&quot; designers Ben Wanat and Wright Bagwell stated that their game was originally intended to be &quot;System Shock 3&quot; before the release of &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; inspired them to go back to the drawing board. &quot;BioShock&quot; was also influenced by &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;, including its approach to the environments, combat, and tools, its game design and tactical elements, its &quot;gameplay fuelled storytelling&quot; and inventory system, and its opening village level in terms of how it &quot;handled the sandbox nature of the combat&quot; and in terms of &quot;the environment.&quot; Cory Barlog cited &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; as an influence on the &quot;God of War&quot; series, including &quot;God of War II&quot; (2007) and particularly &quot;God of War&quot; (2018), which was influenced by &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;″s &quot;combination of poised camera exploration and scavenging&quot;. &quot;Uncharted&quot; director Bruce Straley called the &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; village sequence the best opening fight in a video game.

&quot;Resident Evil Village&quot; is heavily influenced by &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; with its own director stating, &quot;If &quot;Resident Evil 7&quot; was like a reboot that inherited the DNA of the original &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, then you could say that this time we&#x27;re doing the same for &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;. We&#x27;ve designed the game and its structure with &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;″s essence in mind&quot;.

&quot;VentureBeat&quot; credits &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; as an early example of HD video game remasters. A remake of &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; was released on March 24, 2023 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S. The remake was also announced for the iPhone 15 Pro, to be released between late 2023 to early 2024.

In June 2021, the photographer and author Judy Juracek launched legal proceedings against Capcom for using images from her book &quot;Surfaces: Visual Research for Artists, Architects, and Designers&quot; without her permission to create textures for multiple games, including &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; and &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;. The parties reached an undisclosed settlement outside of court in February 2022. Capcom and Juracek have amicably resolved their dispute concerning the alleged use of her photos in Capcom&#x27;s games. A dismissal was filed on February 7, 2022 with the District of Connecticut to end the lawsuit.

<text>The abcoulomb (abC or aC) or electromagnetic unit of charge (emu of charge) is the derived physical unit of electric charge in the cgs-emu system of units. One abcoulomb is equal to ten coulombs.

The name &quot;abcoulomb&quot; was introduced by Kennelly in 1903 as a short form of &quot;(absolute) electromagnetic cgs unit of charge&quot; that was in use since the adoption of the cgs system in 1875. The abcoulomb was coherent with the cgs-emu system, in contrast to the coulomb, the practical unit of charge that had been adopted too in 1875.

CGS-emu (or &quot;electromagnetic cgs&quot;) units are one of several systems of electromagnetic units within the centimetre gram second system of units; others include CGS-esu, Gaussian units, and Heaviside–Lorentz units. In these other systems, the abcoulomb is not used; CGS-esu and Gaussian units use the statcoulomb instead, while the Heaviside–Lorentz unit of charge has no specific name.

In the electromagnetic cgs system, electric current is a fundamental quantity defined via Ampère&#x27;s law and takes the permeability as a dimensionless quantity (relative permeability) whose value in a vacuum is unity. As a consequence, the square of the speed of light appears explicitly in some of the equations interrelating quantities in this system.

The definition of the abcoulomb follows from that of the abampere: given two parallel currents of one abampere separated by one centimetre, the force per distance of wire is 2 dyn/cm. The abcoulomb is the charge flowing in 1 second given a current of 1 abampere.

<text>KKCD (105.9 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a classic rock format. Licensed to Omaha, Nebraska, United States, the station serves the Omaha area. The station is owned by SummitMedia. KKCD&#x27;s studios are located on Mercy Road in Omaha&#x27;s Aksarben Village, while its transmitter is located near South 27th Street and Q Street (near the Kennedy Freeway), about three miles south of Downtown Omaha.

==History==
=== Smooth jazz (1990–1991) ===
The station went on the air on August 11, 1990, calling itself &quot;The View&quot; and broadcasting a smooth jazz format. It had earlier sought the calls KUKF, but changed to KKVU a month before signing on.

=== Classic rock (1991–present) ===
The station initially met acceptance, but soon struggled in the ratings, and on November 9, 1991, the station flipped formats to classic rock as &quot;CD 105.9&quot;, and changed their call sign to KKCD. Notable radio personalities include Donna Mason, Otis XII and Steve King, who was the longest running morning show host in the station&#x27;s history before he was let go on February 1, 2019.

Journal Communications and the E. W. Scripps Company announced on July 30, 2014 that the two companies would merge to create a new broadcast company under the E.W. Scripps Company name that owned the two companies&#x27; broadcast properties, including KKCD. The transaction was completed in 2015. Scripps exited radio in 2018; the Omaha stations went to SummitMedia in a four-market, $47 million deal completed on November 1, 2018.

In February 2020, KKCD rebranded as simply &quot;Classic Rock 105.9&quot;.

<doc id="1310531" wikidata="Q7512272" url="?curid=1310531" title="Sigma Alpha Epsilon">
<text>Sigma Alpha Epsilon () is a North American Greek-letter social college fraternity. It was founded at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, on March 9, 1856. Of all existing national social fraternities, Sigma Alpha Epsilon is the only one founded in the Antebellum South. Its national headquarters, the Levere Memorial Temple, was established next to the campus of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, in 1926. The fraternity&#x27;s mission statement is &quot;To promote the highest standards of friendship, scholarship and service for our members throughout life.&quot;

The fraternity has chapters and emerging-chapters in 50 states and provinces as of 2011.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon had eleven deaths linked to drinking, drugs and hazing between 2006 and 2013, more than any other Greek organization in the United States according to data compiled by Bloomberg. During the 2010s, at least 18 Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapters were suspended, closed, or banned. In March 2014, the fraternity announced that it was eliminating the tradition of pledging following these deaths and other hazing incidents.

==History==

Sigma Alpha Epsilon was founded on March 9, 1856, at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Its founders were Noble Leslie DeVotie, Nathan Elams Cockrell, Samuel Marion Dennis, John Barrett Rudulph, Abner Edwin Patton, Wade Hampton Foster, Thomas Chappell Cook, and John Webb Kerr. Their leader was DeVotie, who wrote the ritual, created the grip, and chose the name. Rudulph designed the fraternity badge. Of all existing national social fraternities, Sigma Alpha Epsilon is the only national fraternity founded in the Antebellum South.

Patton was selected as the fraternity&#x27;s first president. In the fall of 1854, Patton was the only Sigma Alpha Epsilon founder still enrolled at the university and continued to serve as its president. His efforts led to the expansion of the fraternity to the University of Nashville (now Vanderbilt University), Union College, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in January and February 1857. By the end of 1857, the fraternity had grown to seven chapters. Its first national convention met in the summer of 1858 at Murfreesboro, Tennessee, with four of its eight chapters in attendance.

By the time the American Civil War began in 1861, fifteen chapters had been established. The fraternity had fewer than 400 members when the Civil War began. Of those, 370 went to war for the Confederate States and seven for the Union Army. Seventy-four members of the fraternity lost their lives in the war, including founders Dennis, DeVotie, and Patton.

Fraternal history notes that Noble Leslie DeVotie was the first person to die in the Civil War, though this is in dispute. DeVotie lost his footing while boarding a steamer at Fort Morgan, Alabama, on February 12, 1861, hit his head and drowned. His body washed ashore three days later. He is recognized by the State of Alabama as the first Alabama Soldier to die in the Civil War.

After the Civil War, a small chapter at Columbian College, which is now George Washington University in Washington, D.C., was the only chapter to survive.

When a few of the young veterans returned to the Georgia Military Institute in Marietta, Georgia, and found their college burned to the ground, they decided to enter the University of Georgia in Athens. The chapter there, which was established at the end of 1865, along with the reestablishment of a chapter at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, led to the fraternity&#x27;s revival. Soon, other chapters came back to life and, in 1867, the first post-war convention was held in Nashville, where a half-dozen revived chapters planned the fraternity&#x27;s future growth.

In the 1870s and early 1880s, more than a score of new chapters were formed. Older chapters died as fast as new ones were established. By 1886, the fraternity had chartered 49 chapters, but few were active. The first chapter north of the Mason Dixon Line had been established at Pennsylvania College (now Gettysburg College in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania), in 1883, and a second was placed at Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio two years later.

==Symbols==
Sigma Alpha Epsilon&#x27;s colors are royal purple and old gold. Its symbol is the lion. Its flower is the violet. The fraternity&#x27;s Roman divinity is Minerva.

==Levere Memorial Temple==

The fraternity&#x27;s international headquarters, also known as the Fraternity Service Center, is maintained at the Levere Memorial Temple in Evanston, Illinois. The fraternity approved a plan to construct a national headquarters at its 1920 convention and its design was approved at the 1928 convention. It was built between mid-1929 and 1930, and was dedicated on December 28, 1930. The building was named for member William Levere who left $25,000 in his will to the fraternity.

The Levere Memorial Temple serves as a war memorial for fraternities members and houses a museum on the first floor with a collection of historical photographs, pictures, and collections from private sources.

==The Diomedians==
At one point, the fraternity had an alumni affiliate called the Diomedians. This organization was founded in 1918 in New York City, and its ritual was first &quot;exemplified&quot; in May 1919 and a National Council with the power to grant charters was established that June. A convention in St. Louis a year and a half later incorporated the Diomedians into the organizational structure of the fraternity and created the &quot;Diomedian degree&quot;. By 1923 Diomedian chapters were established in Michigan and Pittsburgh and a Diomedian club-house &quot;designed to furnish a modest home for young men just out of college&quot; was established at 51 West 48th Street in New York.

===Hazing and alcohol related deaths and injuries===
Sigma Alpha Epsilon has had nine deaths linked to drinking, drugs and hazing since 2006, more than any other Greek organization, according to data compiled by Bloomberg in 2013. More than 100 chapters have been disciplined since 2007, with at least fifteen suspended or closed since 2010. A potential initiate to the SAE chapter at Salisbury University in Maryland alleged that Justin Stuart was beaten with a paddle, forced to drink alcohol to the point of losing consciousness and confined in a basement for nine hours without access to food, water or a bathroom while being subjected to music torture, an experience described as being &quot;almost like Guantanamo Bay&quot;. The allegations were verified by a university investigation that led to the suspension of the chapter on the grounds that it had violated Salisbury policies on alcohol, hazing, and threats or acts of violence.

In May 2013, members of the Arizona State chapter allegedly left an underage member outside a hospital with a note saying &quot;Ive been drinking and I need some help.&quot; The 20-year-old survived after nearly 20 shots of tequila resulting in a near lethal blood alcohol content of 0.47%, according to doctors.

In 2017, the University of Nevada, Reno suspended the Reno chapter of SAE due to allegations of hazing and under-age drinking. The university ultimately voted to remove SAE&#x27;s recognition for four years. As of 2023, the University of Nevada, Reno still does not recognize SAE, with that chapter still working towards recognition.

As a result of these incidents, student members pay among the highest rates for liability insurance of any fraternity. In March 2014 JPMorgan Chase stopped managing an investment account of SAE&#x27;s charitable foundation, with bad publicity from hazing as the likely cause. In January 2019, a newly-initiated freshman member of the chapter at the University of California, Irvine died from alcohol poisoning with allegations of fraternity hazing rituals still under investigation.

In 2012, the national fraternity organization responded to hazing allegations, stating that it has &quot;zero tolerance for hazing&quot;, and that the reported infractions represent a low percentage of its more than 219 chapters and 15,000 college members. Following the 2011 hazing-related death of a Cornell University sophomore who was blindfolded, bound and forced to drink shots of vodka then left dying in the empty fraternity house, a constitutional amendment to ban alcohol at all chapter houses was proposed at the 155th national conference, but the measure failed to reach the two-thirds majority needed.

In March 2014 the fraternity revised its membership process to replace the term &quot;pledge&quot; with &quot;new member&quot; and require that initiation be completed within 96 hours of new members receiving bids. The SAE national president cited efforts to combat hazing, treat all members of the fraternity equally, and to protect the reputation of the fraternity as primary reasons for the change.

===Sexual assault and harassment===

According to several campus newspapers and the 2015 documentary &quot;The Hunting Ground&quot;, students commonly joke that SAE stands for &quot;sexual assault expected&quot; because of the many members who have been accused of sexual assault.

In 2012, an incident of alleged sexual misconduct involving a member at Louisiana State University (LSU) with a freshman girl occurred. Also that same year, the LSU chapter was accused of severely beating pledges. The chapter was suspended until January 2015.

In 2014, a rape allegedly took place at an SAE party at Loyola Marymount University. The national organization reacted by closing the chapter.

In December 2014, Stanford University announced a two-year suspension of SAE housing due to reports of sexual harassment. After a second university investigation found that members had deterred a student from filing a Title IX concern and had intimidated and harassed another student believed to have filed a Title IX complaint, the chapter&#x27;s housing was &quot;indefinitely&quot; revoked in May 2015.

In January 2015, a victim was hospitalized following allegations of sexual assault at a party at a SAE Iowa State University party. The incident was investigated by police and the chapter suspended the member suspected of the assault.

In March 2015, Johns Hopkins University suspended the local SAE chapter until Spring 2016 after an alleged sexual assault at one of their parties.

The Yale University chapter was temporarily banned from using the university email and bulletin board system as well as association of the fraternity name and the university following &quot;inappropriate comments&quot; made by SAE members.

In February 2017, the SAE chapter at Northwestern University was suspended indefinitely after four women alleged they were given date rape drugs at an SAE party, and two stated they were later sexually assaulted.

In August 2018, the SAE National Fraternity and the chapter at the University of California, Los Angeles were sued for negligence after a member of the Zeta Beta Tau (ZBT) Fraternity assaulted a woman at an SAE event. The lawsuit also encompassed the ZBT fraternity as well as UCLA.

In August 2020, the SAE chapter at West Virginia University was suspended for sexual assault.

===Alcohol, drug, and safety violations===

The founding chapter at the University of Alabama was suspended in 1988 on cocaine-trafficking charges and for violating the university&#x27;s code against drug use and trafficking. The suspension was lifted in 1990, but with a checklist of improvement goals that the chapter was required to fulfill; in 1992, the chapter was suspended again for failing to meet the outlined goals.

In the fall of 1991, the University of Houston chapter was suspended when the fraternity&#x27;s president bit off a finger of a female guest&#x27;s hand during an altercation with her boyfriend at a party held at the fraternity house.

In 1997, the Louisiana State University chapter was suspended after one member died from alcohol poisoning. Another member was praised for rescuing more than a dozen of his passed out brothers from death by ferrying them to the nearest hospital single-handedly.

The chapter at Southern Methodist University was placed on &quot;deferred suspension&quot; following a drug-related death in 2006, and then again for abuse and hazing that occurred in 2017.

In spring 2012, the Miami University chapter of SAE was suspended after an early morning &quot;fireworks battle&quot; with the neighboring Phi Kappa Tau house led to Oxford police seizing considerable amounts of drug paraphernalia from both houses. Since the groups were temporarily unrecognized while on suspension, sophomores who were living there under fraternity exemption from Miami&#x27;s two-year campus housing policy were required to vacate the houses and move on campus. As a result, SAE&#x27;s national organization sued Miami for $10 million, claiming &quot;severe emotional distress&quot; and &quot;substantial lost income and reputation&quot; for the exiled students. Susan Dlott, judge of the Southern District of Ohio, dismissed SAE&#x27;s lawsuit in February 2013 with prejudice (meaning it could not be refiled), saying that &quot;...the fraternity failed to submit any facts that supported its claims the public university violated its constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure and due process.&quot; In November 2015, the Miami SAE chapter was allowed to recolonize by Miami&#x27;s Interfraternity Council.

In 2013, the chapter at Arizona State University was banned from campus due to repeated hazing and alcohol violations and questionable behavior. Jack Culolias, an ASU freshman and SAE pledge, was kicked out of a bar one night then later found dead in a ditch. The chapter also faced heavy scrutiny when a member nearly died after participating in a tequila drinking contest.

In July 2015, the University of Richmond (Virginia) chapter was suspended indefinitely &quot;based on repeated incidents that violated the University&#x27;s policies and risk management procedures.&quot; An investigation had been opened in April, when the national organization suspended the chapter after two women were hurt falling from a balcony during a ski trip.

In April 2016, the UMBC chapter was suspended after allegations of alcohol policy violations, property theft and damage, and failure to comply with previous sanctions (also handed for underage drinking, in a party that resulted in 55 police citations). The University&#x27;s Student Judicial Board determined that the claims were substantiated, and suspended the chapter for four years.

In November 2017, the SAE chapter at the University of Texas at Austin was suspended for hazing violations. Two years prior, several members from the chapter were accused of beating up a male neighbor complaining about loud music that was playing at their fraternity house during a recruitment event. Only two members were identified and charged with physical assault for the incident. This prompted the chapter to disaffiliate from SAE. The chapter retained the fraternity house and is regulated by its alumni board.

In January 2019, the SAE chapter at the University of California, Irvine was suspended after the death of a freshman newly initiated member of the fraternity. In March 2019, the Orange County coroner&#x27;s office announced that the death was found to have been caused by alcohol poisoning and the chapter was closed indefinitely amidst allegations of fraternity hazing rituals but the details are still under investigation .

In February 2019, the SAE chapter at Tennessee Technological University was placed on suspension for four to five years, or until all current members have graduated or left Tennessee Tech. The closure follows the death of a Tech graduate and former fraternity member, who died one day after attending the &quot;senior transition night&quot;, at the SAE house on Dec. 7, 2018.

In December 2021, eight members of the fraternity at Georgia College and State University were arrested for providing alcohol to minors and one member for hazing. The arrests happened after a SAE pledge was hospitalized due to an alcohol related hazing incident. The chapter was taken off of social 

In June 2022, the SAE chapter at the University of New Hampshire was suspended pending an investigation into a hazing incident that occurred in April. Arrest warrants were issued for 46 members of the chapter, as well as a warrant charging the chapter itself with student hazing. The chapter was taken off of social probation in May 2024.

In January 2024, Texas Rho, the SAE chapter at the University of Texas at Austin, was sued by an Australian exchange student over injuries he sustained from an assault by fraternity members at a party the previous year. The student suffered significant injuries during the attack, including a dislocated leg, broken ligaments, fractured tibia and broken nose, according to the suit. He is suing the fraternity for more than $1 million. The SAE chapter was already suspended at the time of his assault due to previous hazing and safety violations.

In February 2025, the SAE chapter at Miami University was suspended after a report indicated a number of &quot;inhumane&quot; activities took place at an off-campus property owned by the fraternity involving pledges. One pledge was allegedly coerced and forced into the pledge process, where &quot;he [was] hazed for multiple days and was forced to cut communication with all others.&quot; Among the alleged hazing incidents, the pledge was required to ingest an entire can of chewing tobacco and then do a handstand. He vomited as a result and was forced to then consume the vomit. When the pledge reported the incident to another student, he received a text message from an active member threatening to put a &quot;12 gauge down his throat and watch his brain splatter.&quot; As of February 24th, the fraternity chapter has been suspended and is under investigation by Miami University officials.

===Discriminatory incidents===

In 1982 SAE members at the University of Cincinnati were suspended for a racially insensitive party corresponding with Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s birthday.

In 2002, Syracuse University officials suspended the chapter there after a member appeared in blackface. The member was expelled from the university. The chapter returned after the suspension and in 2006 was found guilty of hazing a new member by the University&#x27;s Office of Fraternity and Sorority Affairs.

In 2013, SAE pledges at Washington University in St. Louis allegedly recited lyrics to Dr. Dre&#x27;s &quot;Bitches Ain&#x27;t Shit&quot; in slam poetry form within close proximity of several African-American students in the university&#x27;s dining hall. Chapter operations were halted for several months while the chapter was put under investigation due to allegations of racist behavior stemming from the incident. The chapter was fully reinstated following the investigation.

In 2014, the chapter at Clemson University hosted a &quot;Cripmas&quot; party in reference to the Southern California-based black American Crips gang. The chapter &quot;suspended all activity indefinitely&quot;, according to the SAE national office.

Also, in 2014, SAE members at the University of Arizona were suspended for attacking Alpha Epsilon Pi, a Jewish fraternity.

In March 2015, the national organization of Sigma Alpha Epsilon closed the University of Oklahoma chapter after a video surfaced showing members chanting a song which featured the racial slur, &quot;nigger,&quot; and made references to lynching and racial segregation. The chant, set to melody of the popular children&#x27;s song, &quot;If You&#x27;re Happy and You Know It&quot;, declares, &quot;There will never be a nigger at SAE / There will never be a nigger at SAE / You can hang him from a tree, but he&#x27;ll never sign with me / There will never be a nigger at SAE.&quot; Sigma Alpha Epsilon closed the charter of the involved chapter and suspended its members on March 8, 2015. The University of Oklahoma president, David Boren, simultaneously closed the chapter house, giving members two days to vacate the fraternity&#x27;s campus dwellings. On March 10, 2015, two students identified in the video were expelled from the university.

In May 2016, the SAE chapter at the University of Wisconsin–Madison was placed on suspension for repeatedly using racist, homophobic, and anti-Semitic slurs, and then ostracizing a black SAE member for speaking up against the chapter&#x27;s behavior.

<doc id="1310535" wikidata="Q1367130" url="?curid=1310535" title="Klonoa">
<text>Klonoa is a series of platform video games primarily developed and published by Namco. It stars Klonoa, an anthropomorphic creature who explores dream worlds. The series includes two main games: &quot;&quot; (1997) for the PlayStation and &quot;Klonoa 2: Lunatea&#x27;s Veil&quot; (2001) for the PlayStation 2. A remake of &quot;Door to Phantomile&quot; was released for the Wii in 2008, and remasters of both games were released in 2022. The series also includes a set of handheld games released between 1999 and 2002 for the WonderSwan and Game Boy Advance.

== Series elements ==

===Gameplay===
The games are set in different worlds, though the primary and known ones are Phantomile and Lunatea. It revolves around Klonoa and how he, the Dream Traveler, must save whatever world he is in from peril. Along the way he makes new friends and enemies, some of them becoming recurring characters. The game is an early example of a side-scrolling 3D game. It is an adventure and puzzle type of game. The main gameplay feature involves using Klonoa&#x27;s ring and &quot;Wind Bullets&quot; to inflate enemies, which can be thrown at other objects or at the ground, giving him a boost upwards allowing him to double jump.

=== Character ===
 The series stars the titular character, Klonoa, who has features of a dog, cat, and rabbit but is not explicitly any particular animal. He is described within the games and manga as a &quot;Dream Traveler&quot;, who is fated to travel to various places where the state of dreams is in danger. Voice acting for Klonoa in most appearances is provided by Kumiko Watanabe, although English dub performances have been provided by Eric Stitt in the Wii remake of &quot;Klonoa: Door to Phantomile&quot;, and by an uncredited voice actor in &quot;Klonoa Beach Volleyball&quot;. He has Namco&#x27;s mascot Pac-Man on the side of his blue hat. Wanting to be a hero, he is young and good-hearted and is willing to go against all odds to make sure justice is served. He is easily able to befriend characters along the way who support his cause. His attitude is innocent and even a bit naive, as shown in &quot;Klonoa 2: Lunatea&#x27;s Veil&quot;.

Klonoa was designed by Yoshihiko Arai. Arai&#x27;s first design, &quot;Shady&quot;, had a shadow-like appearance. However, he felt that the lack of color did not seem tasteful, and dropped the design. His next design was created with characteristically animal eyes and long ears, as Arai felt that a person&#x27;s eyes and silhouette are the features noticed when they are first met. He added a large hat with a Pac-Man emblem on it and collar to give the character a childlike and energetic quality. The design was kept and used for Klonoa.

== History ==
The first entry in the series, &quot;&quot; (1997), was developed by published by Namco with director Hideo Yoshizawa. The Klonoa character and other game characters were designed by Yoshihiko Arai. The game released to a positive critical reception. Critics labeled it as Namco&#x27;s first notable 3D platformer and a bid for creating a gaming mascot. The game has been renowned for its blend of 2D gameplay with 3D visuals.

After &quot;Door to Phantomile&quot;, Namco developed two follow-ups simultaneously: &quot;&quot; (1999) for the WonderSwan, and &quot;Klonoa 2: Lunatea&#x27;s Veil&quot; (2001) for the PlayStation 2. &quot;Moonlight Museum&quot; was released exclusively in Japan, and set the design standards for future handheld &quot;Klonoa&quot; games. &quot;Lunatea&#x27;s Veil&quot; was released to critical acclaim but weak commercial performance.

Namco published three &quot;Klonoa&quot; games for the Game Boy Advance in the early 2000s. The first two, &quot;&quot; (2001) and &quot;Klonoa 2: Dream Champ Tournament&quot; (2002), are platform games which continued the 2D gameplay used in &quot;Moonlight Museum&quot; but with a new cast of supporting characters. The third game, &quot;Klonoa Heroes: Densetsu no Star Medal&quot; (2002) was an action role-playing game released exclusively in Japan. Also during this period, Namco published &quot;Klonoa Beach Volleyball&quot; (2002) in Japan and Europe.

With no home console release in the series since 2001, Namco sought to revive the franchise with &quot;Klonoa&quot; (2008) for the Wii, a remake of &quot;Door to Phantomile&quot;. The game featured revised graphics and voice acting, as well as new unlockable bonuses not in the original. Despite receiving positive reviews, the game was a commercial failure and plans for a remake of &quot;Lunatea&#x27;s Veil&quot; as well as a third main line installment were scrapped.

In September 2019, a trademark filing under the name &quot;Klonoa of the Wind Encore&quot; was discovered. Further trademark filings for &quot;Wahoo Encore&quot; and &quot;1&amp;2 Encore&quot; were discovered in September 2021. In December 2021, a trademark for &quot;Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series&quot; was filed in the United Kingdom. &quot;Phantasy Reverie Series&quot;, which features remasters of the Wii version of &quot;Klonoa: Door to Phantomile&quot; and the original &quot;Klonoa 2: Lunatea&#x27;s Veil&quot;, was officially announced in a Nintendo Direct in February 2022, and was released in July for Nintendo Switch, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. The game is titled &quot;Kaze no Klonoa 1&amp;2 Encore&quot; in Japan, making it another entry in Bandai Namco&#x27;s &quot;Encore&quot; series of remakes.

== Reception ==

The &quot;Klonoa&quot; series has been mostly critically well received. It was praised for its gameplay, graphics and story. It also received several awards including &quot;Lunatea&#x27;s Veil&quot; winning GameSpy&#x27;s PlayStation 2 &quot;Platform Game of the Year&quot; in 2001.

However, the series saw disappointing sales commercially. &quot;Lunatea&#x27;s Veil&quot; only sold 133,401 copies in Japan during 2001, making it the 85th best-selling game of the year, while &quot;Klonoa&quot; on Wii only debuted with 5,800 copies sold in Japan, making it the 33rd highest-selling game in the region in its first week.

&quot;Phantasy Reverie Series&quot; made #5 in the UK sales charts in its first week, with 52% of its sales being on Switch and 33% being on PlayStation 5. While in Japan, the Switch version sold 9,602 copies in its first week, placing fifth in sales charts, whilst the PlayStation 4 version shifted 1,252 units and made #25.

==Other media==
The character Klonoa has made cameo appearances in other video games developed by Namco. He is playable in &quot;Namco × Capcom&quot;, &quot;MotoGP&quot;, &quot;Alpine Racer 3&quot;, &quot;Smash Court 3&quot;, &quot;World Kicks&quot;, &quot;Super World Stadium 2000&quot;, &quot;Family Tennis Advance&quot;, &quot;Pro Baseball: Famista 2011&quot; and &quot;Famista Dream Match&quot;. Other games in which Klonoa is referenced in include several games in the &quot;Tales of&quot; series, several entries in the &quot;Taiko no Tatsujin&quot; series, several entries in the &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; series, several entries in the &quot;Mr. Driller&quot; series (also created by Hideo Yoshizawa), several entries in the &quot;Kotoba no Puzzle: Mojipittan&quot; series, the Japanese version of &quot;Xenosaga Episode I&quot;, &quot;Final Lap 2000&quot;, &quot;Namco Stars&quot;, &quot;Point Blank 3&quot;, &quot;Family Stadium 2003&quot;, &quot;QuickSpot&quot;, &quot;Dragon Tamer Sound Spirit&quot;, &quot;Seven Bridge&quot;, &quot;Keroro RPG: Kishi to Musha to Densetsu no Kaizoku&quot;, &quot;Magical Girl Lyrical Nahoha A&#x27;s Portable: The Gears of Destiny&quot;, &quot;We Ski&quot; and its sequel &quot;We Ski &amp; Snowboard&quot;, &quot;Soulcalibur V&quot;, &quot;Tekken 7&quot;, &quot;We Love Katamari REROLL+ Royal Reverie&quot; and &quot;Pac-Man Mega Tunnel Battle: Chomp Champs&quot; among others. &quot;Klonoa: Door to Phantomile&quot; is also among the games parodied in the game Segagaga for the Dreamcast, and Klonoa himself is among the many PlayStation heroes featured in the Team Asobi title &quot;Astro Bot&quot;.

&quot;Shippuu Tengoku Kaze no Klonoa&quot; is a two-volume long comedy/slapstick manga that, unlike the somewhat more serious tone from the video games, feature Klonoa as a good natured, clumsy and dim-witted kid obsessed with being a super hero. His attempts to make good deeds tend to fail or cause the opposite effect, due to his being overly enthusiastic, his habit of jumping to conclusions and, sometimes, just because of bad luck. The volumes were released in 2002 and 2003.

&quot;Klonoa: Dream Traveller of Noctis Sol&quot; was a webcomic series published by ShiftyLook, written by Jim Zub and drawn by Hitoshi Ariga. It began in September 2012 and lasted for two seasons with new pages being released every Wednesday, later Wednesdays and Fridays, before abruptly stopping in mid-late 2014 with the closing of ShiftyLook, ending the story on a cliffhanger. In addition, Klonoa has made cameo appearances in ShiftyLook&#x27;s other series &quot;Bravoman: Super Unequaled Hero of Excellence&quot;, and Lolo, a recurring character in the &quot;Klonoa&quot; series, appears in ShiftyLook&#x27;s web browser-based dating simulation game &quot;Namco High&quot;, albeit with an entirely different personality from her other appearances.

A &quot;Klonoa&quot; anime film adaptation was under pre-production at Henshin. Hideo Yoshizawa joined the project as executive producer. Ash Paulsen, a former GameXplain member, also joined in as an associate producer. After two years with no updates, writer Hitoshi Ariga confirmed the project was cancelled on January 4, 2019.

<text>A consort of instruments was a phrase used in England during the 16th and 17th centuries to indicate an instrumental ensemble. These could consist of the same or a variety of instruments. Consort music enjoyed considerable popularity at court and in the households of the wealthy in the Elizabethan era, and many pieces were written for consorts by the major composers of the period. In the Baroque era, consort music was absorbed into chamber music.

==Definitions and forms==
The earliest documented example of the English word &#x27;consort&#x27; in a musical sense is in George Gascoigne’s &quot;The Princelye Pleasures&quot; (1576). Only from the mid-17th century has there been a clear distinction made between a &quot;‘whole’, or ‘closed’ consort&quot;, that is, all instruments of the same family (for example, a set of viols played together) and a &quot;‘mixed’, or ‘broken’ consort&quot;, consisting of instruments from various families (for example viols and lute).

Major forms of music composed for consorts included fantasias, cantus firmus settings (including &quot;In nomines&quot;), variations, dances or ayres, and fantasia suites.

==Major composers==
Composers of consort music during the Elizabethan era include John Dowland, Anthony Holborne, Osbert Parsley, and William Byrd. The principal Jacobean era composers included Thomas Lupo, Orlando Gibbons, John Coprario, and Alfonso Ferrabosco. William Lawes was a principal composer during the Caroline era. Later 17th-century composers included John Jenkins, Christopher Simpson, Matthew Locke and Henry Purcell.

==Modern consorts==
In modern times, a number of ensembles have adopted the term &quot;consort&quot; in their names:

*Armonico Consort
*The Baltimore Consort
*B-Five Recorder Consort
*Catacoustic Consort
*The Consort of Musicke
*Dunedin Consort
*Early Music Consort of London
*Gaia Consort
*The Harp Consort
*The King&#x27;s Consort
*Leonhardt-Consort
*Locke Brass Consort
*The Newberry Consort
*Orlando Consort
*The Paul Winter Consort
*Quadriga Consort
*Clemencic Consort
*Ricercar Consort
*Rose Consort of Viols
*Sherwood Consort
*Southern Consort of Voices
*Taverner Consort
*The Tudor Consort

<doc id="1310540" wikidata="Q5892382" url="?curid=1310540" title="Honda C engine">
<text>Honda&#x27;s first production V6 was the C series; it was produced in displacements from 2.0 to 3.5 liters. The C engine was produced in various forms for over 20 years (1985–2005), having first been used in the KA series Legend model, and its British sister car the Rover 800-series (and Sterling).

All C engines share in common a 90-degree V-angle from bank to bank, common cylinder block bore centers, and four valves per cylinder. It is an all-aluminum design, and uses timing belt-driven single or dual overhead camshafts; the water pump is also driven by the timing belt.

All C engines use an interference design; if the timing belt fails, any open valves will clash into the pistons, and severe engine damage will occur.

The engine family can be broken down into three sub families:
* C20A, C20AT, C25A and C27A (transversely mounted)
* C30A and C32B (transversely mounted rear)
* C32A, C35A, and C35B (one-off) (longitudinally mounted)

As a general rule, interchange of parts will not work between these sub groups.

==C20A==

SOHC 
* at 6,500 rpm
* at 5,500 rpm

Japan only;

* 1986–1988 Honda Legend
* Experimental HP-X (Honda Pininfarina Xperimental)

The variable length intake manifold used six individual small-bore intake runners below 3,500 rpm for each cylinder and added an additional six individual larger bore intake runners at higher RPMs.

The C20AT was a turbocharged version, called the &quot;Wing Turbo&quot;, producing .

Japan only:
* 1989 Honda Legend

Honda replaced the variable length intake manifold with a variable geometry turbocharger to the C20A engine used in the Japanese Domestic Market Legend. The turbo with intercooler-equipped engine was the C20AT engine and are extremely rare. Honda pioneered variable-geometry turbo chargers. The &quot;Wing Turbo&quot;, as Honda called them, were controlled by an 8-bit processor ECU and they were constantly adjusting. Basically, at low speeds the wings surrounding the turbine wheel inside the compressor housing on the intake side would be nearly closed to speed and direct exhaust pressure precisely on the turbine wheel. At 2000 rpm, the wings would fluctuate and it would act like a much larger turbo to increase fuel economy as needed. This car was quick and powerful, but the price premium over the slightly longer and wider Legend with the naturally aspirated V6 was too much for most, so the car disappeared. This was one of the only production Hondas ever turbocharged from the factory (excluding turbo engines of kei car for the Japan domestic market), along with the K23A1 straight-4 engine used in the Acura RDX and the ER straight-4 engine used in the first generation Honda City until model year 2017, when most of their model lines had the option of the 1.5L turbocharged engine.

==C25A==

SOHC (2.5 L) V6 24 valves, 9.0:1 compression

Japan
* at 6,000 rpm
* at 4,500 rpm
North America:
* 1986-1987 Honda Legend Sedan, 1986-1988 Rover 825 Sedan,
** at 5,800 rpm
** at 4,500 rpm
** UK and Europe (sold in US as Sterling 825i)

The engine utilized a 90 degree V-angle to the crankshaft in preference to the taller but more common 60 degree design, with a compression ratio of 9.0:1. The crankshaft had crankpins offset 30 degrees to provide a low profile engine that fires smoothly and evenly. The block and cross flow pent roof cylinder heads with 24 valves are die-cast from aluminum alloy and the cylinder bores are lined with cast iron. The exhaust system uses equal length exhaust pipes connected to the Exhaust manifold to minimize scavenging resistance and maximum total exhaust efficiency. An external high capacity water cooled oil cooler and filter maintain an efficient oil temperature.

==C27A==

The SOHC C27A is a 2.7 L version, with the major upgrade being the addition of a variable length intake manifold, producing up to

* C27A1 - 1988-1991 Sterling 827, (catalyst)

==C30A==
The DOHC VTEC C30A is a version, producing at 7,300 rpm and of torque at 6,500 rpm, with a 10.2:1 compression ratio. The engine has a bore and stroke of 90mm x 78mm, making the engine highly over square, which facilitates a shift in power to the higher end of the rpm range. It utilizes a crankshaft with offset crankpins to achieve an evenly spaced firing interval of 120°, something typically unattainable with a 90° cylinder bank angle. Honda selected the 90° V6 as the NSX&#x27;s optimal engine choice, striking a balance between packaging, complexity, and lowering the car&#x27;s center of gravity. The engine was the second Honda engine ever to utilize Honda&#x27;s proprietary VTEC variable valve timing system in an automotive application after the B16A, which adjusts cam lift depending on engine RPM and throttle position. VTEC allows the C30A to produce a high maximum power level while maintaining a relatively flat torque curve. C30A was also equipped with Variable Volume Induction System (VVIS), which used a primary and a secondary intake plenum. Secondary intake plenum engages at 4800 RPM to improve engines breathing ability and broadens torque curve.

The C30A also made use of titanium connecting rods, which was another first in a mass-production vehicle. The lightweight rods allowed a higher RPM to be achieved while maintaining the strength of traditional steel rods. The C30A block is an open-deck design made from an aluminum alloy with cylinders sleeved in ductile iron. The heads are 4 valves per cylinder (24 valves per engine total), twin-cam design and contain the VTEC mechanism, which is actuated by oil pressure. For maximum performance, the C30A uses a direct ignition system, with individual ignition coils positioned directly over each cylinder spark plug.

With its DOHC layout and its lightweight rotating assembly, the C30A is capable of reliable high RPM operation, but due to its complexity, cost, and use of exotic materials, the C30A was used exclusively on Honda&#x27;s NSX car. For NSXs equipped with a 4-speed automatic transmission, Honda used a slightly less powerful version of the C30A, with less aggressive cam timing and producing .

Though never mass produced, a heavily upgraded version of the engine was briefly used in GT-spec NSXs for the 2004 JGTC racing series by the Team Honda Racing satellite team. This engine was extensively modified by Mugen and was the first turbocharged Honda engine used in the series: prior GT-spec NSXs used a variant of the naturally aspirated C32B engine. Though the exact performance figures were kept secret, it is rumored to output more than .

Applications:
* 1991-1996 Honda NSX (5-Speed Manual Transmission)
* 1991-2005 Honda NSX (4-Speed Automatic Transmission)
* 1994-1996 Honda NSX Le Mans
* 2004 Honda NSX-GT Super GT

==C32A==

The C32A is a version. The SOHC depending on model year, produces or .

Applications;
* C32A - SOHC USDM - and 
** 1991-1995 Acura Legend sedan
** 1991-1992 Acura Legend coupé
* C32A6 - SOHC USDM - and 
** 1996-1998 Acura 3.2TL
* C32A1 - Also known as the &quot;Type-II&quot;; uses a higher flowing intake manifold and slightly more aggressive camshaft - SOHC USDM - at 6200 rpm and at 5000 rpm.
** 1994-1995 Acura Legend GS sedan
** 1993-1995 Acura Legend LS and L coupe
* C32A5 - SOHC JDM - and 
** 1995-1998 Honda Inspire/Honda Saber

==C32B==
The C32B is a highly tuned DOHC V6 used in the Honda NSX, which produces at 7,100 rpm and at 5,500 rpm of torque, retaining the 10.2:1 compression ratio from the C30A. The engine is essentially an update to the C30A and does not share commonality with the C32A. Honda increased displacement to through the use of larger pistons over the used in the C30A, while leaving the stroke the same. To accommodate the larger pistons, Honda used an advanced metallurgical technique on the cylinders called Fiber Reinforced Metal (FRM), in which an ultra lightweight alumina-carbon fiber is cast into the traditional aluminum alloy for enhanced rigidity. This process allowed thinner cylinder walls to be used while providing acceptable cooling characteristics. The C32B also used intake valves, which are larger than those in the C30A.

Applications:
* 1997-2005 Honda NSX (6-Speed manual transmission)
* 1996-2002, 2005-2009 Honda NSX-GT Super GT
* 2002 Vemac RD320R Super GT

==C35A==

The C35A is a SOHC and carries the largest displacement of the C series at . The C35A was the first mass-produced engine to use block forged connecting rods contributing to precise balancing and an exceptionally strong bottom end. The C35 also contains a balance shaft to dampen engine vibrations associated with 90 degree design V6 engines. Besides the addition of these forged components, the overall design is similar to its smaller counterpart the C32A, with some parts being interchangeable. The 9.6:1 compression ratio of the C32A is also retained, despite the increase in displacement.

Applications:
* C35A - SOHC JDM - 
** 1996-2004 Honda Legend 
* C35A1 - SOHC USDM - 
** 1996-2001 Acura 3.5RL; at 5200 rpm and of torque at 2800 rpm
** 2002-2004 Acura 3.5RL; at 5200 rpm and of torque at 2800 rpm
* C35A2 - SOHC EDM - 
** 1996-1998 Honda Legend 
* C35A5 - SOHC EDM - 
** 1998-2004 Honda Legend

==C35B==

The C35B (name unconfirmed) is a DOHC V6 with VTEC which shares basic design properties with its SOHC non-VTEC counterpart but with more aggressive camshafts and slightly lighter cylinder walls. This was the only DOHC VTEC V6 ever built by Honda for longitudinal applications and was only used in one non-production car, the Honda FS-X concept.

Applications:
* 1991 Honda FS-X concept -

<text>The Comp Air 3 is a small civil utility aircraft marketed in kit form by Comp Air. It is a conventional, high-wing monoplane built largely of composite materials and which can be configured with either tailwheel or tricycle undercarriage. The design is based on the Comp Air 4, but the fuselage has been reduced in width, sacrificing seating for improved aerodynamics. The prototype first flew on February 25, 2002.

The company website does not list it as being in production in 2022.

<doc id="1310543" wikidata="Q12124698" url="?curid=1310543" title="Hare Brush">
<text>Hare Brush is a 1955 Warner Bros. &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; animated short directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on May 7, 1955, and stars Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd.

&quot;Hare Brush&quot; pokes fun at Freudian psychoanalysis, psychiatric medication, hypnosis, and the cliches of other Bugs Bunny shorts. Along with &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot; and &quot;Rabbit Rampage&quot;, it is one of the few cartoons where Elmer gets the upper hand on Bugs. It is also the first short in the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series to open with Milt Franklyn&#x27;s re-arranged version of &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot;; the new fanfare would stay in use until 1964.

==Plot==
At the Elmer J. Fudd Corporation&#x27;s boardroom, the mental health of their CEO, Elmer Fudd, is discussed; he thinks he is a rabbit, and the board decides to commit him to the Fruitcake Sanitarium. In a rabbit costume, Elmer encounters Bugs Bunny and, using a carrot as bait, lures him into the sanitarium. Meanwhile, psychiatrist Dr. Oro Myicin arrives to treat Elmer, but mistakenly diagnoses Bugs—with &quot;rabbitschenia&quot;. He gives Bugs a pill that makes him highly suggestible. Through repeated suggestion, Bugs comes to believe he is Elmer J. Fudd, millionaire owner of a mansion and yacht.

Declared cured, Bugs is released from the sanitarium dressed as Elmer. He hunts and ends up pursuing Elmer himself, who manages to escape. Ultimately, Bugs&#x27; charade is exposed when an IRS agent arrests him for tax evasion. Elmer breaks the fourth wall and tells the audience &quot;I may be a scwewy wabbit, but I&#x27;m not going to Alcatwaz&quot; as he hops away happily, as if he had planned the whole thing.

== Music ==
Milt Franklyn&#x27;s music is characteristically less through-composed than that of Carl Stalling, and consists largely of rising and falling arpeggios, stings, and short motifs. Nevertheless, it also follows the usual pattern of Warner&#x27;s shorts in quoting snippets of popular music to reflect the development of the plot. Starting as usual with &quot;Merrily We Roll Along,&quot; the cartoon sets the scene for the corporate meeting by quoting &quot;42nd Street.&quot; To introduce the sanitarium, Franklyn uses the old rhyme &quot;Nuts in May.&quot; The hypnotic phrase &quot;I am Elmer J. Fudd,&quot; &quot;etc&quot;., is associated with a driving motif in the bass. &quot;A-Hunting We Will Go&quot; marks the chauffeur&#x27;s announcement that it is Wednesday, the day on which Fudd customarily goes hunting, and the start of the hunt itself. As noticed above, the final scene of the action ends with Ray Anthony&#x27;s &quot;Bunny Hop&quot;, and the short concludes, as usual, with &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot; over the &quot;That&#x27;s All, Folks!&quot; caption.

==Home Media==
&quot;Hare Brush&quot; was included on several &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; VHS cassette releases, as well as the &quot;Bugs Bunny 80th Anniversary Collection&quot; Blu-ray.

<text>M&amp;M Food Market (), formerly known as M&amp;M Meat Shops, is a Canadian frozen food retail chain. The company is headquartered in Mississauga, Ontario, and has locations in all ten provinces, the Yukon and the Northwest Territories; the company formerly had operations in the Midwestern United States under the MyMenu brand that operated between 2008 and 2013.

==Origin==
M&amp;M was founded by Michael &quot;Mac&quot; Voisin and Mark Nowak in Kitchener, Ontario, in 1980. Voisin&#x27;s and Nowak&#x27;s original business model was to provide good quality meat at lower prices. The partners discovered that flash-frozen meats retained their freshness with Canadian-grown (Health Canada safe) meats with no steroids, added preservatives and no torture farms. But because they could be stored over a longer term, could be sold at a price comparable to supermarket meats.

M&amp;M locations are generally small outlets in strip malls, consisting of several freezers and a counter acting as a point of sale. Store employees are known as &quot;Meal Advisors,&quot; who are trained to assist customers by suggesting products and meal ideas.

In addition to the head office in Mississauga, M&amp;M has regional offices in Montreal, Quebec and Calgary, Alberta.

M&amp;M opened its first new franchise in nearby Cambridge, Ontario, in 1982. Mac&#x27;s brother and co-owner, Greg Voisin, became director of franchising in the mid-1980s. Since then, it has expanded to over 425 stores across Canada. M&amp;M entered Quebec in 1992 and then in 1997, it entered the western provinces by acquiring the business of Jeffrey&#x27;s Food, based in Edmonton, Alberta in 1993. M&amp;M opened its first store in Yukon in 2004 (at Whitehorse) and in the Northwest Territories in 2006 (Yellowknife). Some of Mac&#x27;s family members, including Guy Voisin, also work for the company.

Although it originally focused on cuts of meat, it has expanded its offerings to prepared meals, appetizers, pizza, pasta, seafood, desserts and single servings, including meatless items to appeal to vegetarians.

In the summer of 2019, M&amp;M Food Market announced a partnership with Instacart allowing for customers to order their groceries online and have them delivered right to their door. In 2022 Parkland Corporation acquired M&amp;M&#x27;s for $322 million.

===Loyalty program===
In 2001, M&amp;M launched the MAX Rewards loyalty program that would give members special pricing in-store and entries into exclusive contests. It is not a points-based program, but rather rewards customers with special in-store sale pricing not available to other customers. Over time, the program grew to include special reward vouchers periodically available for over 8 million MAX members and special email offers sent through the eMAX newsletter.

In early 2018, M&amp;M announced a name change to their loyalty program, re-branding it as Real Rewards. M&amp;M Food Market has since launched a mobile app that allows Real Reward members to see their exclusive product offerings.

===Private takeover===
In July 2014, the brand was assumed by private investment firm Searchlight Capital Partners, and partners. Searchlight appointed a chief executive officer, Andy O&#x27;Brien, and a chief financial officer, Sam Florio.

===Name and format change===
In March 2016, M&amp;M Meat Shops announced that they would change their name to M&amp;M Food Market. With the name change came a broadening of M&amp;M&#x27;s selection beyond frozen meats to include frozen produce, and other healthier selections. The company also indicated plans to expand M&amp;M to 500 locations by 2019, along with revamped store layouts that remove the service counter that separates customers from the freezers. In February 2019, M&amp;M began stocking their frozen meals in select locations of retailers such as Rexall, allowing them to reach every Province and Territory with retailers in Nunavut.

==Charity BBQ Day and Corporate Sponsorship==
Charity BBQ Day was M&amp;M Food Market&#x27;s biggest charity event. It was held annually on the Saturday before Mother’s Day. Charity BBQ Day supported the CCFC, the Crohn&#x27;s and Colitis Foundation of Canada, by raising funds for research through the sale of hamburgers and hot dogs for a minimum donation.

Charity BBQ Day first started in 1989, when the founder of M&amp;M, Mac Voisin, wanted to give back to the community. He decided to support the CCFC, to help raise funds and support research into inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD has &quot;no know cause or cure,&quot; and &quot;Canada has among the highest reported prevalence of IBD in the world.&quot; In 25 years, M&amp;M Food Market has raised more than $24.3 million for medical research dedicated to finding a cure for IBD.

M&amp;M Food Market holds other fundraising events through the year to support the CCFC, such as regional golf tournaments, the sale of Charity BBQ Day Penguins, Blossoms and Coupon Books, and by &quot;sponsoring the Gutsy Walk and providing support in the form of BBQs in many event locations across the country.&quot;

M&amp;M Food Market was also a long time sponsor of the Canadian Junior Curling Championships and was a &quot;full sub-sponsor to the CCA&#x27;s Season of Champions.&quot; During the Season of Champions, M&amp;M held a contest where the grand prize was a trip to see the next year&#x27;s World Juniors. Viewers would see a secret word displayed on the television which they then could enter on M&amp;M&#x27;s website.

==Awards and recognition==
M&amp;M Food Market have won numerous awards over the years, such as a Gold Frankie Award from the Canadian Franchise Association for excellence in advertising: Internet/Website Design in 2008. In 2013, M&amp;M Food Market successfully re-qualified for the 7th consecutive year (Platinum) as one of Canada’s 50 Best Managed Companies sponsored by Deloitte, CIBC Commercial Banking, National Post, and Queen’s School of Business. M&amp;M Food Market has also twice held the world record for longest sausage: first in 1983 and again in May 1995 with a sausage produced in conjunction with Schneider Foods.

==MyMenu==
In 2008, M&amp;M ventured outside Canada for the first time, opening stores in the Midwestern United States under the banner MyMenu, so named to avoid any trademark conflict or confusion with the more prominent Mars-produced plurally-branded chocolate candy. Other than the new name (chosen to reflect a from-the-ground-up operation that &quot;[helps] people put menus together&quot;), MyMenu stores were similar in design and layout to the M&amp;M locations in Canada, featuring freezers, a sales counter, and the blue-and-orange M&amp;M colour scheme. The company started with 8 original MyMenu stores — 5 in the Madison, Wisconsin market and 3 in Fort Wayne, Indiana; these were considered &quot;test market&quot; locations, with the company hoping to convert them to franchise ownership before adding franchises in other Midwestern markets. A difficult economic climate that affected sales and franchise financing efforts prompted MyMenu to close 2 of its Madison stores in early 2010 and all of its remaining Madison and Fort Wayne stores in early 2011. Despite this setback, MyMenu continued operations and changed its focus to co-branding opportunities with established retailers in existing locations; the first co-branding effort was the October 2010 launch of stand-alone MyMenu departments at three locations of general-merchandise retailer The Andersons in Toledo, Maumee, and Columbus, Ohio. By March 2013, all United States efforts, including co-branding, were discontinued, with the MyMenu.com website indicating that the company was no longer operating in the U.S.

<text>Mary Elisabeth Dolin ( Brugger; January 25, 1936 – April 9, 1985) was an American-born Canadian politician in Manitoba, Canada. She was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in 1981 as a New Democrat, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Howard Pawley prior to her death. She also had the married names of Higgins from 1957 to 1966 and Andrus from 1966 to 1979.

Born Mary Elisabeth Brugger in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, she was educated at Webster College, Saint Louis University, Washington University in St. Louis and the University of Manitoba. She came to Canada with her husband and children in 1970. She held a number of degrees, including a Bachelor of Education, and was a teacher and school administrator before entering political life. She served as a member of the Manitoba Teachers&#x27; Society, as well as the Manitoba Association of Rights and Liberties.

Dolin was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1981 provincial election in the north-end Winnipeg riding of Kildonan, defeating her Progressive Conservative opponent by more than 2,000 votes. On July 19, 1982, she was named Manitoba Minister of Labour and Manpower, with responsibility for the Civil Service Act, the Civil Service Superannuation Act, the Pension Benefits Act and the Public Servants Insurance Act, and well as the minister responsible for the Status of Women. Following a cabinet shuffle on November 4, 1983, she retained the Labour portfolio and the Status of Women responsibility, while also becoming the Minister of Urban Affairs. As Labour Minister, Dolin conducted the final pension review in Manitoba before 2004.

==Death and legacy==
She left cabinet on January 30, 1985 following her diagnosis of breast cancer. She died shortly thereafter. Her husband, Marty Dolin, was elected in a 1985 by-election held in the Kildonan riding following her death.

The Mary Beth Dolin Meritorious Fire Service Medal was established in her honour in 1988.

<doc id="1310557" wikidata="Q4348078" url="?curid=1310557" title="1954 United States Senate elections">
<text>The 1954 United States Senate elections was a midterm election in the first term of Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s presidency. The 32 Senate seats of Class 2 were contested in regular elections, and six special elections were held to fill vacancies. Eisenhower&#x27;s Republican party lost a net of two seats to the Democratic opposition. This small change was just enough to give Democrats control of the chamber with the help of the Independent (Wayne Morse of Oregon) who at the start of this Congress in January 1955 agreed to caucus with them; he later officially joined the party in April 1955. 

A contribution to the Republican reversal was backlash against GOP-driven McCarthyism and the numerous controversies it spawned, including the Army–McCarthy hearings. Other factors included a comment made in Detroit by Defense Secretary Charles Wilson, former president of General Motors, equating unemployed auto workers with &quot;lazy kennel dogs who sit... and yell.&quot;

However, it has been pointed out that losses in the midterm election were considerably less than the White House party generally faces in the midterm elections, and this has been attributed to the overall popularity of President Eisenhower, who participated in the campaign along with Vice-President Richard Nixon and other members of the cabinet.

The elections resulted in a divided government that continued to the end of Eisenhower&#x27;s presidency and a Democratic majority that would last until 1981. , this is the last Senate election cycle in which a state (both Nebraska and North Carolina) had to hold three simultaneous elections (two special elections and one regular election) due to the near-simultaneous deaths of both incumbent Senators.

Republican Wesley A. D&#x27;Ewart United States Congressman from Montana&#x27;s 2nd congressional district beat Robert Yellowtail, former Superintendent of the Crow Indian Reservation, for the GOP nomination.

A contentious and close election ensued, but ultimately, Murray was able to narrowly win re-election over D&#x27;Ewart to a final term in the Senate.

== South Carolina ==


In South Carolina, Senator Burnet R. Maybank did not face a primary challenge in the summer and was therefore renominated as the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee for the election in the fall. However, his death on September 1 left the Democratic Party without a nominee and the executive committee decided to nominate state Senator Edgar A. Brown as their candidate for the election. Many South Carolinians were outraged by the party&#x27;s decision to forgo a primary election and former Governor Strom Thurmond entered the race as a write-in candidate. He easily won the election and became the first U.S. senator to be elected by a write-in vote (William Knowland of California in 1946 was technically the first, but the ballots in that election were blank with no candidates listed, so essentially every candidate was running a write-in campaign).

Sitting Senator Burnet R. Maybank entered the 1954 contest without a challenge in the Democratic primary nor in the general election. His unexpected death on September 1 caused panic and confusion within the hierarchy of the state Democratic party because the state law required that a party&#x27;s nominee be certified by September 3. Hours after Maybank&#x27;s funeral, the state Democratic executive committee met in secret and chose state Senator Edgar A. Brown of Barnwell County as the party&#x27;s nominee for the general election. Not only was Brown a part of the &quot;Barnwell Ring&quot;, but he was also a member of the executive committee.

The state Democratic Party&#x27;s decision to choose a candidate without holding a special primary election drew widespread criticism across the state. On September 3, &quot;The Greenville News&quot; ran an editorial advocating that a primary election be called and several newspapers across the state followed suit. At least six county Democratic committees repudiated the action by the state committee and called for a primary election. Despite repeated calls for a primary, the state executive committee voted against holding a primary because they did not think that there was enough time before the general election to hold a primary election.

Immediately after the executive committee voted against holding a primary election, former Governor Strom Thurmond and lumberman Marcus Stone announced their intention to run as Democratic write-in candidates. Thurmond and his supporters stated that the executive committee had several legal alternatives as opposed to the outright appointment of state Senator Brown. In addition, Thurmond promised that if he were elected he would resign in 1956 so that the voters could choose a candidate in the regular primary for the remaining four years of the term.

Thurmond received support from Governor James F. Byrnes and from those who backed his Presidential bid as a Dixiecrat in the 1948 Presidential election. Thurmond framed the race as a &quot;moral issue: democracy versus committee rule&quot; and his write-in campaign was repeatedly assisted by every newspaper in the state, except for those in Anderson. For instance, &quot;The News and Courier&quot; devoted its front page on November 2 to show voters a sample ballot and it also provided detailed instructions on how to cast a write-in vote. Not only that, but the newspaper also printed an editorial on the front page giving precise reasons why voters should vote for Thurmond instead of Brown.

On the other hand, Brown was supported by the Democratic party regulars and he also gained the endorsement of Senator Olin D. Johnston. Brown based his campaign entirely on the issue of party loyalty, stressing that Thurmond was a Republican ally because he had voted for President Eisenhower in 1952.

Marcus A. Stone, a lumberman in Florence and Dillon, was a candidate in previous Democratic primaries for governor and senator. He did very little campaigning for the general election.

<doc id="1310559" wikidata="Q7368200" url="?curid=1310559" title="Rosehill Cemetery">
<text>Rosehill Cemetery (founded 1859) is an American garden cemetery on the North Side of Chicago, Illinois, and at , is the largest cemetery in the City of Chicago. According to legend, the name &quot;Rosehill&quot; resulted from a City Clerk&#x27;s error – the area was previously called &quot;Roe&#x27;s Hill&quot;, named after nearby farmer Hiram Roe. He refused to sell his land to the city until it was promised that the cemetery be named in his honor. It is located in the north east section of the Lincoln Square community area.

Rosehill&#x27;s Joliet-limestone entrance gate (added in 1864) was designed by William W. Boyington, the architect of the Chicago Water Tower and the Old University of Chicago, who is buried in Rosehill. The Rosehill Cemetery Administration Building and Entry Gate was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

Like its sister cemetery Graceland, Rosehill is the burial place of many well-known Chicagoans. The cemetery contains many monuments that are notable for their beauty and eccentricity, such as that of Lulu Fellows.

The cemetery is also the final resting place of 64 victims of the Iroquois Theatre fire, in which over 600 people died.

Several graves, gravestones and monuments from the old City Cemetery, originally located in what is now Lincoln Park were relocated to Rosehill Cemetery.

==Landmarks==
===Rosehill Mausoleum===
Dedicated in 1914, Rosehill Mausoleum was designed by architect Sidney Lovell. It is the largest mausoleum in Chicago and has two levels, the lower level being partially underground. The interior is constructed almost entirely of marble. The floors are Italian Carrara marble. There are many small family-owned rooms with heavy bronze gates. Some of these private rooms feature stained glass windows designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany among other artists. Richard B. Ogilvie, Governor of Illinois, is entombed near the ceiling in the west part of the Mausoleum. Other notables include Aaron Montgomery Ward, his business rival Richard Warren Sears, and John G. Shedd, philanthropist and president of Marshall Field &amp; Company. The mausoleum has been expanded several times.

===Horatio N. May Chapel===
Built in 1899, the Horatio N. May Chapel was designed by architect Joseph Lyman Silsbee. It is designed in a blend of Gothic and Romanesque styles, with an exterior of granite and an interior appointed with mosaic floors and a graceful oak roof with &quot;hammer-beam trusses and curved brackets.&quot;

===Civil War memorials===
Civil War buffs have long been attracted to Rosehill, where approximately 350 Union soldiers and sailors and at least three Confederates who gave their lives in service are entombed. It is the final resting place for several members of the 8th Illinois Cavalry, the unit that fired the first shots in the Battle of Gettysburg, and of a general whose troops helped Ulysses S. Grant avoid surrender in the Battle of Shiloh, Grant&#x27;s first major engagement of the war. Rosehill Cemetery maintains the distinction of being the largest private burial ground of Union veterans, including 16 generals, in the state of Illinois. To honor those who fought for country and cause, Rosehill officially opened its own Civil War Museum on January 15, 1995.

===Chicago Volunteer Firefighter&#x27;s Memorial===
A monument &quot;To Honor All the Courageous Volunteer Firefighters of Chicago&quot; was erected in Rosehill Cemetery in 1864. The monument, designed by Leonard Volk, features a vigilant fireman standing atop a tall column. A fire hose is wrapped around the base. Four old-style hydrants make up the corners of the memorial. The granite marker at the base contains the names of all firefighters killed in the line of duty.

==In film==
Rosehill was featured in the film &quot;Next of Kin&quot; (1989). The funeral scene in &quot;Backdraft&quot; (1991) takes place at the Volunteer Firefighter&#x27;s Monument at Rosehill, but was actually filmed elsewhere using a replica of this monument. Lulu Fellowes (the girl in the glass box) also appeared in the film &quot;U.S. Marshals&quot; (1998).

==West Ridge Nature Preserve==
In 2015, the Chicago Park District Park No. 568 – West Ridge Nature Preserve was established along the north western edge of Rosehill Cemetery. The park land, which was once part of the cemetery, features 20.585 acres of restored woodland, native plants, boardwalks, a 4.5 acre pond, a multipurpose trail around the park with elevated overlooks, educational and interpretive signage for easy identification of plantings, fishing stations and wildlife viewing opportunities.

<doc id="1310560" wikidata="Q6942144" url="?curid=1310560" title="Music of Evenkia">
<text>Evenk Autonomous Okrug (or Evenkia) was a federal subject of Russia. On January 1, 2007, it was merged into Krasnoyarsk Krai.

Oleg Chapogir from Kislokan is regarded as the most renowned composer from Evenkia. He has devoted himself to local music and poetry (such as by Nikolai Oyogir and Alitet Nemtushkin), though he was educated at Norilsk Musical College and was part of that school&#x27;s first class, which graduated in 1974.

Though not a native of Evenkia, Nikolai Nikolaevich has also had a profound effect on Evenk music. He funded the children&#x27;s national band Osikta and an influential brass band. Nikolaevich has also arranged local folklore and worked with Chapogir, Evgeniya Kureiskaya, a popular Evenk singer, and Anatoli Kustov, a composer.

<text>Patrick Allen Ramsey (born February 14, 1979) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Tulane Green Wave and was selected by the Washington Redskins in the first round of the 2002 NFL draft. Ramsey was also a member of the New York Jets, Denver Broncos, Tennessee Titans, Detroit Lions, New Orleans Saints, Jacksonville Jaguars, Miami Dolphins, and Minnesota Vikings.

==Early life==
Ramsey was born on February 14, 1979, in Ruston, Louisiana. He attended Ruston High School, where he was a two-year starter quarterback, and was also state champion in the javelin throw. His best friend was the son of Bert Jones, a Ruston native who had gone on to a distinguished career as an NFL quarterback, and the elder Jones became Ramsey&#x27;s mentor.

==College career==
Ramsey attended Tulane University and had an outstanding collegiate career as a &quot;scholar athlete&quot;, being named five times to the Conference USA Commissioner&#x27;s honor roll, and was the National Football Foundation/College Football Hall of Fame Scholar-Athlete of the Year, in 2001.

During Ramsey&#x27;s 1999 season, he set 20 Tulane passing records, including single season records for passing yards, attempts, and completions. In that season he threw for 25 touchdowns, the second-most ever for a Tulane player. In 2000, he led the third-best passing offense in the nation. He also made the All-Conference USA second-team, leading the conference in most meaningful passing statistics. In his senior season in 2001 he started 11 games and threw for 22 touchdowns. He set a school record, having at least one touchdown pass in 31 consecutive games. Upon graduating, he had the top five passing games in school history. His career totals at Tulane were surpassed only (in various individual statistics, none overall) by Shaun King, Mike McKay, Roch Hontas, and Terrence Jones.

Ramsey graduated with degrees in accounting and finance.

==Professional career==
===Washington Redskins===
Ramsey was selected 32nd overall in the 2002 NFL draft by the Washington Redskins, to replace Tony Banks as quarterback.

On October 13, 2002, the Redskins hosted the team from Ramsey&#x27;s home state, the New Orleans Saints. Ramsey threw four interceptions as the Saints won 43–27.

The 2003 season, Ramsey&#x27;s first full season as a starter was even more difficult. He was one of the most sacked quarterbacks in the NFL that year, which was also Spurrier&#x27;s last season as head coach. In 2004, Joe Gibbs returned to coach the team after a prolonged absence; he originally traded for Mark Brunell as the starting quarterback (and then quickly signed him to a long term extension) but replaced him with Ramsey in November. A month later, Gibbs named Ramsey as the starting quarterback for the 2005 season.

In the Redskins&#x27; first game against the Chicago Bears, Ramsey suffered a minor neck injury after a clothesline hit by Chicago Bears linebacker Lance Briggs. Gibbs demoted Ramsey to the role of Brunell&#x27;s back-up for the second game versus the Dallas Cowboys. It was reported that Ramsey requested a trade from the Redskins, following announcement of his demotion. This report was later claimed to be false by Ramsey and the Redskins organization.

===New York Jets===
In March 2006, Ramsey was traded to the New York Jets for a 6th round pick in the 2006 NFL draft. After failing to earn the starting quarterback position from incumbent Chad Pennington, he was cut after the 2006 season. He only threw a single pass for the Jets.

===Denver Broncos===
Following the season, Ramsey signed with the Denver Broncos, serving as the backup to starter Jay Cutler. He was released in the beginning of free agency in March 2009.

===Tennessee Titans===
Ramsey signed a one-year contract with the Tennessee Titans on April 3, 2009, serving as the third quarterback on the depth chart after Kerry Collins and Vince Young. He was released on October 3 when cornerback Cary Williams was activated from the practice squad.

===Detroit Lions===
Ramsey was signed by the Detroit Lions on December 26, 2009, after quarterback Matthew Stafford was placed on injured reserve.

===New Orleans Saints===
Ramsey signed a one-year contract with the New Orleans Saints on July 28, 2010; he was projected to serve as a veteran backup for the Saints&#x27; starting quarterback, Drew Brees, filling the role vacated by Mark Brunell who was not re-signed after the 2009 season. On September 3, Ramsey was released as part of final cuts before the start of the 2010 NFL season, with Chase Daniel having won the backup spot.

===Jacksonville Jaguars===
Due to the Jacksonville Jaguars&#x27; quarterback injury problems in early 2010, Ramsey was brought on as a potential temporary backup for the team. He was released from the team shortly after on October 29, 2010.

===Miami Dolphins===
On November 15, 2010, it was reported that he was signed by the Miami Dolphins following injuries to Chad Pennington and Chad Henne. He was released on waivers November 30, 2010.

===Minnesota Vikings===
On December 15, 2010, Ramsey signed a contract with the Minnesota Vikings but did not play any games that year and was not on the Vikings&#x27; 2011 roster.

==Personal life==
Ramsey married his wife, Virginia, on April 13, 2002, the week before the 2002 NFL draft. The couple has two daughters, Virginia and Jane. He and his wife had their third child in the fall of 2011, Grey.

<doc id="1310568" wikidata="Q3235556" url="?curid=1310568" title="The Adventure of the Six Napoleons">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Six Napoleons&quot;, one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 13 stories in the cycle collected as &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was first published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; in the United States on 30 April 1904, and in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom in May 1904.

== Plot ==
Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard brings Holmes a mysterious problem about a man who shatters plaster busts of Napoleon. One was shattered in Morse Hudson&#x27;s shop, and two others, sold by Hudson to a Dr. Barnicot, were smashed after the doctor&#x27;s house and branch office had been burgled. Nothing else was taken. In the former case, the bust was taken outside before being broken.

Holmes knows that Lestrade&#x27;s theory about a Napoleon-hating lunatic must be wrong. The busts in question all came from the same mould, when there are thousands of images of Napoleon all over London.

The next day, Lestrade calls Holmes to a house where there has been yet another bust-shattering, but there has also been a murder. Mr. Horace Harker found the dead man on his doorstep after investigating a noise. His Napoleon bust was also taken by a burglar entering through a window. It, too, was from the same mould. Also, a photograph of a rather ape-ish-looking man is found in the dead man&#x27;s pocket.


The fragments of Harker&#x27;s bust are in the front garden of an empty house up the street. Holmes concludes that the burglar wanted to see what he was doing, for there is a streetlamp here, whereas the bust could have been broken at another empty house nearer Harker&#x27;s, but it had been dark there.

Holmes tells Lestrade to tell Harker, a journalist for the Central Press Syndicate, that he is convinced that the culprit is a lunatic. Holmes knows that this is not true, but it is expedient to use the press to convince the culprit that this is what the investigators believe.

Holmes interviews the two shopkeepers who sold the busts and finds out whom they were sold to, and where they were made, Gelder &amp; Co. A couple of his informants also recognise the ape-ish man in the picture. They know him as Beppo, an Italian immigrant. He even worked in the shop where the first bust was broken, having left his job there only two days earlier.

Holmes goes to Gelder &amp; Co. and finds out that the busts were part of a batch of six, but other than that, the manager can think of no reason why they should be special, or why anyone would want to destroy them. He recognises Beppo&#x27;s picture, and describes him as a rascal. He was imprisoned for a street-fight stabbing a year earlier, but has likely been released now. He once worked at Gelder &amp; Co., but has not been back. His cousin still works there. Holmes begs the manager not to talk to the cousin about Beppo.

That evening, Lestrade brings news that the dead man has been identified as Pietro Venucci, a Mafioso. Lestrade believes that Venucci was sent to kill the culprit, but wound up dead himself.

After sending an express message, Holmes invites Dr. Watson and Lestrade to join him outside a house in Chiswick where apparently Holmes is expecting another bust-breaking. Lestrade by now is exasperated with Holmes&#x27;s preoccupation with the busts, but comes. They are not disappointed. Beppo shows up, enters the house, and comes back out of the window minutes later with a Napoleon bust, which he proceeds to shatter. He then examines the pieces, quite unaware that Holmes and Lestrade are sneaking up behind him. They pounce, and Beppo is arrested. He will not talk, however.

The mystery is at last laid bare after Holmes offers £10 (£ in ) to the owner of the last existing bust, making him sign a document transferring all rights and ownership of the bust to Holmes. After the seller has left, Holmes smashes the bust with a hunting crop. Among the plaster shards is a gem, the black pearl of the Borgias. Holmes was aware of the case of its disappearance from the beginning. Suspicion had fallen on the owner&#x27;s maid, whose name was Lucretia Venucci – the dead man&#x27;s sister. Beppo somehow got the pearl from Pietro Venucci, and hid it inside a still-soft plaster bust at the factory where he worked, moments before his arrest for the street-fight stabbing.

After serving his one-year sentence, he sought to retrieve the hidden pearl. He found out from his cousin who bought the busts, and through his own efforts and his confederates’, even found out who the end buyers were. He then proceeded to seek the busts out, smashing them one by one to find the pearl.

== Details ==
Although he appears in later published works, this is one of Lestrade&#x27;s last appearances within the official canon, near the midpoint of the 60 combined Holmes works by Doyle. After this he is only mentioned by Holmes or Watson – in &quot;The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax&quot; and &quot;The Adventure of the Three Garridebs&quot; – as a working member of the Yard.

The story&#x27;s basic plot device is similar to that used by Doyle in the earlier &quot;Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle&quot; where a stolen gem was hidden inside the belly of a goose – but the criminal is not sure which of the similar geese holds the jewel.

== Publication history ==
&quot;The Adventure of the Six Napoleons&quot; was published in the US in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 30 April 1904, and in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in May 1904. The story was published with six illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, and with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the &quot;Strand&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in the US in February 1905 and in the UK in March 1905.

== Adaptations ==
=== Film and television ===
The story was adapted as a short silent film titled &quot;The Six Napoleons&quot; (1922) in the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes.

&quot;The Pearl of Death&quot; is a 1944 Sherlock Holmes film that is loosely based on &quot;The Six Napoleons&quot;.

&quot;Dressed to Kill&quot; – also known as &quot;Prelude to Murder&quot; (working title) and &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Code&quot; (in the United Kingdom) – is a 1946 adaptation loosely based on &quot;The Six Napoleons&quot;, the busts being replaced with musical boxes.

The episode of &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; TV series (Episode 4 of season 1) called &quot;Mystery of the Broken Statues&quot; is mainly based on &quot;The Six Napoleons&quot;.

The 1965 television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring Douglas Wilmer as Holmes and Nigel Stock as Watson featured an adaptation of &quot;The Six Napoleons&quot;.

This story was dramatised in the popular Granada Television Sherlock Holmes series starring Jeremy Brett. This version is faithful to the original story—although there is a twist. In the original story, Beppo is captured after killing Venucci and his punishment is left unsaid for the audience to guess. In the episode, Beppo had gone to prison for a year after wounding Venucci in a brawl; at the end, Beppo is hanged. Furthermore, Beppo&#x27;s surname is Cicollini and his role is expanded to have been previously engaged to Lucretia Venucci. Marina Sirtis played Lucretia in this episode.

An episode of the animated television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century&quot; was based on the story. The episode, titled &quot;The Adventure of the Six Napoleons&quot;, aired in 2001.

The opening episode of season 4 of the BBC series &quot;Sherlock&quot; is called &quot;The Six Thatchers&quot; and is based loosely on this story; at one point Sherlock believes that the suspect is hunting for the black pearl, which he had been asked to look into earlier and dismissed as uninteresting, but it is soon revealed that the suspect is actually hunting for a memory stick containing information about Mary Watson&#x27;s past.

The American TV series on CBS Television, &quot;Elementary&quot; &quot;The Further Adventures&quot; also adapts the story. In the cold opening, a break-in occurs at 221-B Baker Street. We find Bernardo &quot;Beppo&quot; Pugliesi retrieving the last of 6 busts, sold from the Royal Wedding 2018. Holmes lets Beppo break the bust, and take the Pearl from the shards. Only to explain the history of Black Pearl, and how Beppo stole the pearl. The day after the original theft, he stabbed a man in a bar fight. Knowing he is being sought in the stabbing, he hid the pearl in his brother&#x27;s ceramics factory, before his arrest. His brother made 1,000 busts, that were so ugly, he only sold 6. A year later, Beppo is paroled, and begins the search, leaving a trail of broken statues. In the robbery of the fifth, Beppo strangled the owner. Holmes purchased the last of the six, making quite a show of the purchase, such that Beppo comes to Baker Street. Later at Scotland Yard, Holmes destroys the Pearl. It was made of painted glass. The glass pearl contained a ring with a hollow compartment that Lucrezia Borgia put poison used to kill her family&#x27;s enemies. When she fell out of favour with certain members of the Vatican, she was told to dispose of the ring, her favourite murder weapon. Female DCI Athelney Jones comments to Holmes, &quot;My God, Holmes. You did not get the goods on one murder tonight, but two!&quot;

=== Radio ===
A radio adaptation aired as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The episode was adapted by Edith Meiser and aired on 25 May 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.

Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. The episode aired on 12 October 1941. Another episode in the same series adapted from the story aired on 7 March 1948, with John Stanley playing Holmes and Alfred Shirley playing Watson.

A radio adaptation of the story was broadcast on BBC Light Programme on 7 December 1954 with John Gielgud as Holmes and Ralph Richardson as Watson. The production aired on NBC radio on 6 March 1955.

Michael Hardwick adapted the story for the BBC Light Programme in 1966, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson.

An adaptation of the story aired on BBC radio in 1978, starring Barry Foster as Holmes and David Buck as Watson.

&quot;The Six Napoleons&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1993 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Donald Gee as Inspector Lestrade and Peter Penry-Jones as Horace Harker.

The story was adapted as a 2013 episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

=== Other media ===
The story is referenced in The Three Investigators book #7 &quot;The Mystery of the Fiery Eye&quot; which deals with a hidden gemstone and false clue of busts, used by a Holmes afficianado.

<text>Jason Lee &quot;Jay&quot; Payton (born November 22, 1972) is an American former Major League Baseball (MLB) outfielder who played for the New York Mets (-), Colorado Rockies (2002-, 2010), San Diego Padres (), Boston Red Sox (), Oakland Athletics (2005-) and Baltimore Orioles (-). He batted and threw right-handed. Payton was an opposite-field hitter with some power. He had great speed as a runner, but did not steal many bases. Defensively, he was a solid outfielder with an above-average arm, and his quickness getting rid of the ball helped him hold baserunners on the base paths. He is currently serving as an in game analyst with ESPNU for college baseball.

==Pre-professional career==
Payton attended Zanesville High School in Zanesville, Ohio, and starred in soccer, basketball, and baseball. He was also an excellent student and graduated fourth in his class. While in Zanesville, Payton played for the Junior Pioneers. After his senior year, he helped lead the Midland Redskins of Cincinnati to the Connie Mack World Series Title, where he was named MVP of the tournament. That exposure helped lead to a full ride scholarship to Georgia Tech, where he would team up with future Major League All Stars Nomar Garciaparra and Jason Varitek to help lead Georgia Tech to their first ever College World Series appearance in school history. The Yellow Jackets came up short losing to Oklahoma in the 1994 championship game. In 1992 and 1993, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Orleans Cardinals of the Cape Cod Baseball League, where he teamed up with Garciaparra in 1993 to lead Orleans to the league championship.

==Baseball career==

===New York Mets (1994–2002)===
Selected by the Mets in the first round (29th overall) of the 1994 MLB draft, Payton hadn&#x27;t fulfilled the great expectations he projected at Georgia Tech when he was drafted in the first round with fellow All Americans and Teammates Nomar Garciaparra and Jason Varitek, due in large part to four surgeries while in the minor leagues. Payton had three elbow surgeries, two of which were Tommy John, and surgery on his left shoulder. He spent the better part of his first five years on and off the DL while rehabbing from surgeries. He made his debut in 1998 after finally battling through all the elbow troubles. He helped lead the Mets to a World Series berth as the starting CF in 2000, his official rookie year, in which he finished third in the rookie of the year voting. In Game 2 of the World Series, Payton hit a dramatic three-run home run against Mariano Rivera in the ninth inning, the second and last postseason home run Rivera gave up in his career.

=== Colorado Rockies (2002–2003) ===
With limited duty in 2001 due to a torn hamstring early in the season, the Mets explored trading Payton. On July 31, 2002, Payton was traded to the Colorado Rockies along with pitcher Mark Corey and minor league outfielder Robert Stratton in exchange for pitchers John Thomson and Steve Reed. In 2003, Payton enjoyed his most productive season with career highs in home runs (28), RBI (89), runs (93), hits (181), doubles (32), on-base percentage (.354), slugging average (.512), at bats (600) and games played (157), and added a respectable .302 batting average.

=== San Diego Padres (2004) ===
On January 13, 2004, Payton signed a two-year, $5.5 million contract with the San Diego Padres, becoming the team&#x27;s starting center fielder. He had a subpar 2004 season, batting .260 with eight homers and 55 RBI in 143 games.

=== Boston Red Sox (2005) ===
On December 20, 2004, Payton was traded to the Boston Red Sox along with infielder Ramón Vázquez, minor league pitcher David Pauley and cash considerations in exchange for Dave Roberts. Payton took over Roberts&#x27; role as the team&#x27;s fourth outfielder.
Payton was designated for assignment by the Red Sox on July 7, , after being publicly disgruntled over his lack of playing time. At the time, he was batting .263 with five home runs and 21 RBI in 55 games.

=== Oakland Athletics (2005–2006) ===
On July 13, 2005, Payton was traded to the Oakland Athletics for pitcher Chad Bradford. On July 15, Payton hit a home run in his first at bat with the A&#x27;s, and earned a cult status for a brief period after winning many games for the A&#x27;s with an otherwise struggling offense. In 2006, Payton played regularly in the outfield for the Athletics while batting .296 with 10 home runs and 59 RBI in 142 games. On July 3, , he hit his 100th career home run against the Detroit Tigers.

=== Baltimore Orioles (2007–2008) ===
On December 11, 2006, Payton agreed to terms on a two-year, $9.75 million contract with the Baltimore Orioles. After becoming a free agent during the 2008–09 offseason, Payton suffered a shoulder injury while lifting weights in March 2009. He did not play during the 2009 season.

=== Second stint with Colorado Rockies (2010) ===
On January 20, 2010, Payton signed a minor league contract with his former team, the Colorado Rockies. Payton was called up to the Rockies active roster in September after spending most of the season with the Rockies minor league affiliate, the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox. He hit .343 with an RBI in 20 games. He retired in February 2011.

===Career statistics===
In 1,259 games over 12 seasons, Payton posted a .279 batting average (1,157-for-4,154) with 561 runs, 193 doubles, 30 triples, 119 home runs, 522 RBI, 47 stolen bases, 255 bases on balls, .323 on-base percentage and .425 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .987 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions. In 21 postseason games, he hit .253 (21-for-83) with nine runs, three home runs and 10 RBI.

<doc id="1310577" wikidata="Q1983260" url="?curid=1310577" title="The Sun (New York City)">
<text>The Sun was a New York newspaper published from 1833 until 1950. It was considered a serious paper, like the city&#x27;s two more successful broadsheets, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. &quot;The Sun&quot; was the first successful penny daily newspaper in the United States, and was for a time, the most successful newspaper in America.

The paper had a central focus on crime news, in which it was a pioneer, and was the first journal to hire a police reporter. Its audience was primarily working class readers.

&quot;The Sun&quot; is well-known for publishing the Great Moon Hoax of 1835, as well as Francis Pharcellus Church&#x27;s 1897 editorial containing the line &quot;Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus&quot;.

It merged with the &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot; in 1950.

== History ==

&quot;The Sun&quot; began publication in New York on September 3, 1833, as a morning newspaper edited by Benjamin Day (1810–1889), with the slogan &quot;It Shines for All&quot;. It cost only one penny (equivalent to ¢ in ), was easy to carry, and had illustrations and crime reporting popular with working-class readers.

It inspired a new genre across the nation, known as the penny press, which made the news more accessible to low-income readers at a time when most papers cost five cents. &quot;The Sun&quot; was also the first newspaper to hire newspaper hawkers to sell it on the street, developing the trade of newsboys shouting headlines.

&quot;The Sun&quot; was the first newspaper to report crimes and personal events such as suicides, deaths, and divorces. The paper had a focus on police reports and human-interest stories for the masses, which consisted of short descriptions of arrests, thefts, and violence. With their competitor the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, founded by James Gordon Bennett, they covered murder cases such as Helen Jewett&#x27;s murder, the murder of John C. Colt&#x27;s murder, Samuel Colt&#x27;s brother, and Mary Rogers&#x27;s case near Sybil&#x27;s Cave. &quot;The Sun&quot; and &quot;The Herald&quot; took sides in these cases, championing working class people over the traditional landed and mercantile elites which, during this era, held disproportionate power over the nation&#x27;s politics and economy.

Benjamin Day&#x27;s brother-in-law, Moses Yale Beach, joined the venture in 1834, became co-owner in 1835, and a few years later, became sole proprietor, bringing a number of innovations to the industry. It became the largest among the Gotham papers for 20 years, sometimes eclipsed by the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; or the &quot;New York Herald&quot;.

The newspaper printed the first newspaper account of a suicide. This story was significant because it was the first about the death of an ordinary person. It changed journalism forever, making the newspaper an integral part of the community and the lives of the readers.

Day was the first to hire reporters to go out and collect stories. Prior to this, newspapers dealt almost exclusively in articles about politics or reviews of books or the theater and relied, in the days before the organization of syndicates such as the Associated Press (AP) and United Press International (UPI), on items sent in by readers and unauthorized copies of stories from other newspapers. &quot;The Sun&quot;″s focus on crime was the beginning of &quot;the craft of reporting and storytelling&quot;.

Crime news provided New Yorkers with information about how the city worked, dwelling on violations of justice, abuse of state power and corrupt schemes.

&quot;The Sun&quot; was also the first newspaper to show that a newspaper could be substantially supported by advertisements rather than subscription fees, and could be sold on the street instead of delivered to each subscriber. Prior to &quot;The Sun&quot;, printers produced newspapers, often at a loss, making their living selling printing services. Day and &quot;The Sun&quot; recognized that the masses were fast becoming literate, and demonstrated that a profit could be made selling to them.

The offices of &quot;The Sun&quot; were initially located on Printing House Square, now called Park Row, Manhattan, and was next to New York City Hall and New York City Police Department. It had a pigeon house built on the roof of its New York office at Nassau Street, receiving news from New York Harbor. They also later used horses, steamships, trains, and the telegraph, the Pony Express and Royal Mail Ships.

===Later history===
Moses Yale Beach&#x27;s sons, Alfred Ely Beach and Moses S. Beach, took over the paper following his retirement. He celebrated the event at his house on Chambers Street, along with the other editors of Gotham, with guests including Congressmen Horace Greeley and James Brooks, and Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Chairman Henry Jarvis Raymond.

In 1868, Moses S. Beach sold the newspaper to Charles A. Dana, the Assistant Secretary of War of Abraham Lincoln, and stayed a stockholder. In 1872 &quot;The Sun&quot; exposed the Crédit Mobilier Scandal, implicating a number of corrupt Congressmen and Vice President Schuyler Colfax in a corrupt scheme involving the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad, and in 1881 exposed the Star Route Scandal, implicating a number of high-profile politicians and businessmen in a scheme relating to the US Postal Service, resulting in number of trials and increasing public support for civil service reform.

An evening edition, known as &quot;The Evening Sun&quot;, was introduced in 1887. The newspaper magnate Frank Munsey bought both editions of the paper in 1916 and merged &quot;The Evening Sun&quot; with his &quot;New York Press&quot;. The morning edition of &quot;The Sun&quot; was merged for a time with Munsey&#x27;s &quot;New York Herald&quot; as &quot;The Sun and New York Herald&quot;, but in 1920, Munsey separated them again, killed &quot;The Evening Sun&quot;, and switched &quot;The Sun&quot; to an evening publishing format.

From 1914 to 1919, &quot;The Sun&quot; moved its offices to 150 Nassau Street, one of the first skyscrapers made of steel, and one of the tallest in the city at the time. The tower was close to the New York Times Building, Woolworth Tower, and New York City Hall. In 1919, &quot;The Sun&quot; moved its offices to the A.T. Stewart Company Building, site of America&#x27;s first department store, at 280 Broadway between Reade and Chambers Streets. 280 Broadway was renamed &quot;The Sun Building&quot; in 1928. A clock featuring &quot;The Sun&quot; name and slogan was built at the corner with Broadway and Chambers Street.

Munsey died in 1925 with a fortune of about 20 million dollars, and was ranked as one of the most powerful media moguls of his time, along with William Randolph Hearst. He left the bulk of his estate, including &quot;The Sun&quot;, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The next year &quot;The Sun&quot; was sold to William Dewart, a longtime associate of Munsey&#x27;s. Dewart&#x27;s son Thomas later ran the paper.

In the 1940s, the newspaper was considered among the most conservative in New York City and was strongly opposed to the New Deal and labor unions. &quot;The Sun&quot; won a Pulitzer Prize in 1949 for an exposé of labor racketeering; it also published the early work of sportswriter W.C. Heinz.

It continued until January 4, 1950, when it merged with the &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot; to form a new paper called the &quot;New York World-Telegram and Sun&quot;. That paper continued for 16 years; in 1966, it joined with the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; to briefly become part of the &quot;World Journal Tribune&quot;, preserving the names of three of the most historic city newspapers, which folded amid disputes with the unions representing its staff the following year.

== Milestones ==

&quot;The Sun&quot; first gained notice for its central role in the Great Moon Hoax of 1835, a fabricated story of life and civilization on the Moon which the paper falsely attributed to British astronomer John Herschel and never retracted. The hoax featured man-bat creatures named the &quot;Vespertilio-homo&quot; that inhabited the moon and built temples. A Yale University delegation was sent to look after the article, and the whole story created much sensation at the time.

On April 13, 1844, &quot;The Sun&quot; published a story by Edgar Allan Poe now known as &quot;The Balloon-Hoax&quot;, retracted two days after publication. The story told of an imagined Atlantic crossing by hot-air balloon.

Today the paper is best known for the 1897 editorial &quot;Is There a Santa Claus?&quot; (commonly referred to as &quot;Yes, Virginia, There Is a Santa Claus&quot;), written by Francis Pharcellus Church.

John B. Bogart, city editor of &quot;The Sun&quot; between 1873 and 1890, made what is perhaps the most frequently quoted definition of the journalistic endeavor: &quot;When a dog bites a man, that is not news, because it happens so often. But if a man bites a dog, that is news.&quot; (The quotation is frequently attributed to Charles Dana, &quot;The Sun&quot; editor and part-owner between 1868 and his death in 1897.)

From 1912, Don Marquis wrote a regular column, &#x27;The Sundial&#x27;, for the Evening Sun. In 1916, he used this to introduce his characters Archy and Mehitabel.

In 1926, &quot;The Sun&quot; published a review by John Grierson of Robert Flaherty&#x27;s film &quot;Moana&quot;, in which Grierson said the film had &quot;documentary value&quot;. This is considered the origin of the term &quot;documentary film&quot;.

The newspaper&#x27;s editorial cartoonist, Rube Goldberg, received the 1948 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning for his cartoon, &quot;Peace Today&quot;. In 1949, &quot;The Sun&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting for a groundbreaking series of articles by Malcolm Johnson, &quot;Crime on the Waterfront&quot;. The series served as the basis for the 1954 movie &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;.

&quot;The Sun&quot;″s first female reporter was Emily Verdery Bettey, hired in 1868. Eleanor Hoyt Brainerd was hired as a reporter and fashion editor in the 1880s. Brainerd was one of the first women to become a professional editor, and perhaps the first full-time fashion editor in American newspaper history.

In 1881, the heroic legend of sheriff Bartholomew Masterson, known as &quot;Bat Masterson&quot;, started from the coverage of a &quot;Sun&quot; reporter whom he had duped. He was a companion of Buffalo Bill, and fought at the Battle of Dodge City War, and was later the subject of a book titled &quot;Gunfighter in Gotham&quot; and the American TV series &quot;Bat Masterson&quot;.

== Legacy ==

The film &quot;Deadline – U.S.A.&quot; (1952) is a story about the death of a New York newspaper called &quot;The Day&quot;, loosely based upon the &quot;Sun&quot;, which closed in 1950. The original &quot;Sun&quot; newspaper was edited by Benjamin Day, making the film&#x27;s newspaper name a play on words (not to be confused with the real-life New London, Connecticut newspaper of the same name).

The masthead of the original &quot;Sun&quot; is visible in a montage of newspaper clippings in a scene of the 1972 film &quot;The Godfather&quot;. The newspaper&#x27;s offices were a converted department store at 280 Broadway, between Chambers and Reade streets in lower Manhattan, now known as &quot;The Sun Building&quot; and famous for the clocks that bear the newspaper&#x27;s masthead and motto. They were recognized as a New York City landmark in 1986. The building now houses the New York City Department of Buildings.

In the 1994 movie &quot;The Paper&quot;, a fictional tabloid newspaper based in New York City bore the same name and motto of &quot;The Sun&quot;, with a slightly different masthead.

In 2002, a new broadsheet was launched, styled &quot;The New York Sun&quot;, and bearing the old newspaper&#x27;s masthead and motto. It was intended as a &quot;conservative alternative&quot; and local news-focused alternative to the more liberal &quot;The New York Times&quot; and other New York newspapers. It was published by Ronald Weintraub and edited by Seth Lipsky, and ceased publication on September 30, 2008. In 2022, it was revived as an online newspaper, under the ownership of Dovid Efune, while Lipsky remained editor.

The history of the &quot;New York Sun&quot; is extensively covered in the Pulitzer Prize-winning book &quot;&quot;. Past reporters of the paper have included NYC Police Commissioner, Col. Arthur H. Woods, and NYC Fire Commissioner Robert Adamson.
