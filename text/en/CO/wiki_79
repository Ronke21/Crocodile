<text>In North American broadcast television frequencies, channel 1 was a former broadcast (over-the-air) television channel which was removed from service in 1948.

During the experimental era of TV operation, Channel 1 was moved around the lower VHF spectrum repeatedly, with the entire band displaced upward at one point due to an early 40 MHz allocation for the FM broadcast band. After FM was moved to its current frequencies in 1946, TV Channel 1&#x27;s last assigned band was 44 to 50 MHz. This allocation was short-lived.

Until 1948, Land Mobile Radio and television broadcasters shared the same frequencies, which caused interference. This shared allocation was eventually found to be unworkable, so the FCC reallocated the Channel 1 frequencies for public safety and land mobile use and assigned TV channels 2–13 exclusively to broadcasters. Aside from the shared frequency issue, this part of the VHF band was (and to some extent still is) prone to higher levels of radio-frequency interference (RFI) than even Channel 2 (System M).

As Mexico signed on its first station in 1950 and Canada&#x27;s first station went on-air in 1952, the historical Channel 1 (System M) is exclusively a U.S. allocation artifact.

== History ==
Channel 1 was allocated at 44–50 MHz between 1937 and 1940. Visual and aural carrier frequencies within the channel fluctuated with changes in overall TV broadcast standards prior to the establishment of permanent standards by the National Television Systems Committee.

In 1940, the FCC reassigned 42–50 MHz to the FM broadcast band. Television&#x27;s channel 1 frequency range was moved to 50–56 MHz (see table below). Experimental television stations in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles were affected.

Commercial TV allocations were made by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under the NTSC system on July 1, 1941. Channel 1 was located at 50–56 MHz, with visual carrier at 51.25 MHz and aural carrier at 55.75 MHz. At the same time, the spectrum from 42 to 50 MHz was allocated to FM radio. Several commercial and experimental television stations operated on the 50–56 MHz Channel 1 between 1941 and 1946, including one station, WNBT (now WNBC, channel 4) in New York City, which had a full commercial operating license.

In the first postwar allocation in the spring of 1946, Channel 1 was moved back to 44–50 MHz, with visual at 45.25 MHz and aural at 49.75 MHz. FM was moved to its current 88–108 MHz band. But WNBT and all other existing stations were moved to other channels, because the final Channel 1 was reserved for low-power community stations covering a limited area. While a handful of construction permits were issued for this final version of Channel 1, no station ever actually broadcast on it before it was removed from use in 1948.

When the FCC initially allocated broadcast television frequencies, channel 1 was logically the first channel. These U.S. TV stations originally broadcast on the 50–56 MHz channel 1:
* W2XBS/WNBT/WRCA (today&#x27;s WNBC), New York City (1941–1946), reassigned in 1946 to channel 4;
* W6XAO/KTSL/KNXT (today&#x27;s KCBS-TV), Los Angeles, reassigned post-war to channel 2;
* W9XZV Chicago, Zenith&#x27;s experimental station, billed as the first all-electric TV station in 1939. Reassigned post-war to Channel 2, it broadcast an early form of monochrome pay-TV in 1951 as K2XBS Phonevision and conducted early color television experiments before ultimately going dark in 1953. Its transmitters were donated to WTTW (PBS 11 Chicago) and its channel 2 assignment was taken by CBS O&amp;O WBBM-TV.
* KARO, Riverside, California; never began broadcasting, no current VHF allocation;
* WSBE, South Bend, Indiana; never began broadcasting on channel 1, but was reallocated to UHF channel 34 in the 1952 revised channel allocation table, where it went on the air as WSBT-TV that year. As part of a consolidation of the Elkhart and South Bend communities into a single television market, WSBT-TV was moved in 1958 to UHF channel 22, where it remains as a digital CBS affiliate today; channel 34 became the home of PBS member station WNIT. No full-service VHF TV allocations were made available to South Bend due to its proximity to Chicago, making the city a UHF island.
By September 1945, additional stations temporarily granted construction permits to operate on channel 1 included: 
* W8XCT (WLW) Cincinnati, Ohio ultimately built on channel 4 as commercial station WLWT, later moved to channel 5.
* W9RUI Iowa City, Iowa held an unbuilt construction permit, and additionally given a channel 12 assignment.
* W8XGZ Charleston, West Virginia, licensed to a chemical company, also held a channel one construction permit; there is no indication the stations ever got on the air.

As a virtual channel, however, KAXT-CD in San Francisco (broadcasting on physical UHF channel 22) was assigned virtual channel 1 in July 2009, becoming the first American station to be assigned virtual channel 1 via the digital television PSIP standard, which shows the channel as such on a digital television set. KAXT-CD&#x27;s physical broadcasts on UHF channel 22 cause no interference for Channel 1 physically. XHDF-TDT and all Azteca Uno stations broadcast on Virtual 1.

=== Community television ===
In 1946, prior to cable TV and the invention of public-access television channels, the FCC decided to reserve channel 1 for low-power Community television stations, and moved existing channel 1 stations to higher frequencies. Community television stations covered smaller cities and were allowed to use less radiated power. None of these stations were built before the FCC imposed a freeze on all television station construction permits in mid-1948, and removed the channel one allocations.

=== A shared (non-primary) allocation ===
From 1945 to 1948 TV stations in the U.S. shared Channel 1 and other channels with fixed and mobile services. The FCC decided in 1948 that a primary (non-shared) allocation of the VHF radio spectrum was needed for television broadcasting. Except for selected VHF frequencies in Alaska and Hawaii (and some overseas territories) the FCC-administered VHF band is primarily allocated for television broadcasting to this day.

The FCC in May 1948 formally changed the rules on TV band allocations based on propagation knowledge gained during the era of shared-user allocations. The 44–50 MHz band used by Channel 1 was replaced by lower-power narrowband users.

Channel 1 was reassigned to fixed and mobile services (44–50 MHz) in order to end their former shared use of other VHF TV frequencies. Rather than renumber the TV channel table, it was decided to merely remove Channel 1 from the table.

===Cable television===
On cable television systems, channel 1 was optionally used by some providers in between channels 4 and 5 at the frequencies of 72–78 MHz (moving channel 5 and 6 allocations up by 2 MHz; however, this would prevent channels 5 and 6 from being viewed on non-cable-ready television sets). Channel 1, where available, has also been mapped to 99 (frequency range 114–120 MHz) on some cable boxes.

===Modern allocations 43–50 MHz===
As of September 2000, the Federal Spectrum Use of the band (which is regulated by the NTIA and not the FCC) was as follows:

*43.69–46.6 Non-Military Land Mobile Radio (LMR):&lt;br&gt;Primarily used by Federal agencies for mutual aid response with local communities.&lt;br&gt; Military LMR: Used by the military services for tactical and training operations on a non-interference basis. (Band is otherwise non-government exclusive).
*46.6–47 Govt. FIXED MOBILE Allocation: &lt;br&gt;Non-Military LMR: Extensive use of this band is for contingency response to various national disasters. Others uses are for national resources management, law enforcement, tornado tracking, and various meteorological research support. &lt;br&gt; Military LMR: This band is used primarily for tactical and training operations by U.S. military units for combat net radio operations that provide command and control for combat, combat support, and combat service support units. Frequencies also used for air-to-ground communications for military close air support requirements as well as some other tactical air-ground and air-air communications.
*47–49.6 Experimental:&lt;br&gt;Used for experimental research to observe and measure currents in harbor areas in support of vessel safety.&lt;br&gt; Military LMR: Used by the military services for tactical and training operations on a non-interference basis. (Band is otherwise non-government exclusive).
*49.6–50 Govt. FIXED MOBILE Allocation:&lt;br&gt; Non-Military LMR: This band is used extensively to support contingencies or ecological emergencies, some public safety requirements, MARS system, and air-quality measurements.&lt;br&gt; Experimental: Research is performed in various regions of the atmosphere as well as experimental development of portable space orbital debris ground radars.&lt;br&gt; Military LMR: This band is used primarily for tactical and training operations by U.S. military units for combat net radio operations that provide command and control for combat, combat support, and combat service support units. Frequencies also used for air-to-ground communications for military close air support requirements as well as some other tactical air-ground and air-air communications.

FCC (NON-Federal) allocations for the band:
*Primarily Land Mobile use from 43-46.6.
*46.61-46.89 is used by older cordless phone base stations. The handsets use the 49.61 - 49.89 range for transmitting to the base unit.
*47.0-49.60 is used by LMR and then the cordless phone range. Early experiments with meteor scatter one way messaging was in the 49 - 50 range back in the early 1990s but it no longer exists due to reliable and cheaper satellite communications.

There is also a conflict with the de facto intermediate frequency for system M television, where receiver tuners shift and flip the incoming signal onto 41.25 MHz (analogue audio) and 45.75 MHz (analogue video) after the initial RF amplifier. This standard was adopted due to image frequency problems when UHF television broadcasting initially struggled to life in 1952.

Any receivers capable of tuning VHF TV 1, by necessity, operated on a lower intermediate frequency as 45.75 MHz video IF would overlap the incoming signal at 44-50 MHz.

==Channel 1 in other NTSC-using countries==
Canada did not start regular television broadcasts until after the U.S. had decommissioned Channel 1 (44–50 MHz) for television use; CBFT and CBLT signed on in 1952. This TV channel was never used in Latin America, South Korea and the Philippines excluding Japan as TV broadcasting did not start in these areas until the 1950s.

Japanese public broadcaster NHK General TV broadcast on Channel 1 in Tokyo and other cities. The Japanese Channel 1 was assigned to the frequency 90 to 96 MHz, just above the Japanese FM band which is 76 to 90 MHz. Frequencies corresponding to Japan&#x27;s channel 1 through 3 (90–108 MHz) are used primarily for FM radio broadcasting (88–108 MHz) outside Japan and correspond to cable 95–97 in North America. With the advent of digital television, these frequencies are being vacated by TV broadcasters and allocated to &quot;wide FM&quot; broadcasters, relocating from mediumwave AM to an extended FM band above 90 MHz.

The following commercial television stations operated on channel 1 on analog:
* Hokkaido Broadcasting (HBC) in Sapporo, Hokkaido
* Aomori Broadcasting Corporation (RAB) in Aomori, Aomori Prefecture
* Tohoku Broadcasting Company (TBC) in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture
* Tokai Television Broadcasting (THK) in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture
* Kitanihon Broadcasting (KNB) in Toyama, Toyama Prefecture
* Shikoku Broadcasting (JRT) in Tokushima, Tokushima Prefecture
* Nihonkai Television (NKT) in Tottori, Tottori Prefecture (also serving Matsue, Shimane Prefecture)
* Kyushu Asahi Broadcasting (KBC) in Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture
* Minaminihon Broadcasting (MBC) in Kagoshima, Kagoshima Prefecture
On digital television, their virtual channel number is 1 for historical reasons.

<text>Hugh of Cyfeiliog, 5th Earl of Chester ( , ; 1147 – 30 June 1181), also written Hugh de Kevilioc, was an Anglo-Norman magnate who was active in England, Wales, Ireland and France during the reign of King Henry II of England.

==Origins==
Born in 1147, he was the son of Ranulf II, 4th Earl of Chester, and his wife Maud, daughter of Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester, who was an illegitimate son of King Henry I of England. A later tradition claims he was born in the Cyfeiliog district of Wales.

==Career==
On his father&#x27;s death in 1153, he became heir to extensive estates. In France, these included the hereditary viscountcies of Avranches, Bessin, and Val de Vire, as well as the honours of St Sever and Briquessart. In England and Wales, there was the earldom of Chester with its associated honours. Together, they made him one of the most important Anglo-Norman landholders when he was declared of age in 1162 and took possession. He quickly took his place among King Henry II&#x27;s magnates, being present at Dover in 1163 for the renewal of the Anglo-Flemish alliance and in 1164 at the Council of Clarendon.

In 1173, however, he joined the revolt of the king&#x27;s sons and led the rebels in Brittany. After sending an army of Brabantines, who forced the rebels to retreat into the castle of Dol, in August 1174 Henry arrived in person to lead the siege. Hugh and his companions, with no food left, surrendered after being promised no executions or mutilations. Held prisoner in various castles, he made his peace with Henry and was one of the witnesses of the Treaty of Falaise in October 1174 that ended hostilities.

At the Council of Northampton in January 1177 his lands were restored, but not his castles, and in March he was a witness to Henry&#x27;s arbitration between the kings of Castile and Navarre. Then in May, at the Council of Windsor, Henry restored his castles and ordered him to Ireland. There is no record of him gaining any military successes or grants of land there.

He died on 30 June 1181 at Leek in Staffordshire and was buried beside his father on the south side of the chapter house of St Werburgh&#x27;s Abbey in Chester, now Chester Cathedral. His successor was his only legitimate son.
==Benefactions==
During his life he made grants to St Werburgh&#x27;s Abbey at Chester, to Stanlow Abbey, to St Mary&#x27;s Priory at Coventry, to Bullington Priory, to Greenfield Priory, to Trentham Priory, and to Bordesley Abbey. He also confirmed grants of his parents to Calke Abbey, to St Mary-on-the-Hill, Chester, and to the Abbey of Saint-Étienne, Caen, in Normandy.
==Family==
In 1169 he married Bertrade, daughter of Simon III de Montfort, Count of Évreux, who in turn was the son of Amaury III of Montfort. Their children were:

*Ranulf III, who became 6th Earl of Chester but died childless in 1232, when his four legitimate sisters became his heirs.
*Maud, who married David of Scotland, 8th Earl of Huntingdon.
*Mabel, who married William d&#x27;Aubigny, 3rd Earl of Arundel.
*Agnes, who married William de Ferrers, 4th Earl of Derby.
*Hawise, who married Robert II de Quincy.
Known illegitimate children were: Pagan; Roger; Amice, who married Ranulf Mainwaring, justice of Chester; and an unknown daughter who married Richard Bacon, founder of Rocester Abbey. Other illegitimate daughters have been claimed: one called Beatrix was alleged to have married a William Belward, while another unnamed daughter was said to have married Llywelyn the Great.

<doc id="1300733" wikidata="Q329972" url="?curid=1300733" title="John Hubley">
<text>John Kirkham Hubley (May 21, 1914 – February 21, 1977) was an American animated film director, art director, producer, and writer known for his work with the United Productions of America (UPA) and his own independent studio, Storyboard, Inc. (later renamed Hubley Studio). A pioneer and innovator in the American animation industry, Hubley pushed for more visually and emotionally complex films than those being produced by contemporaries like the Walt Disney Company and Warner Brothers Animation. He and his second wife, Faith Hubley (née Chestman), who he worked alongside from 1953 onward, were nominated for seven Academy Awards, winning three.

Hubley was born in Marinette, Wisconsin, in 1914 and developed an interest in art from a young age, as both his mother and maternal grandfather were professional painters. After high school, Hubley attended the ArtCenter College of Design to study painting. After three years of classes, he got a job at the Walt Disney Animation Studio at the age of 22. Although his talents were recognized by the studio and he was given a position as an animation director on &quot;Fantasia&quot;, Hubley felt restricted by the studio&#x27;s conservative animation style. Hubley left Disney in 1941 during the Disney animator&#x27;s strike and joined the First Motion Pictures Unit, later following many of his fellow unit artists to the newly-formed Industrial Poster Service (later renamed the United Productions of America). Hubley served many roles at UPA and directed several Academy Award-nominated animated shorts. Most famously, he directed &quot;The Ragtime Bear&quot; (1949), the debut of Mr. Magoo, a character he co-created.

In 1952, Hubley was forced to leave UPA after refusing to denounce communism, leading to his eventual investigation by the House Un-American Activities Committee. He soon opened his own independent studio to capitalize on commercial work for the new market of television advertising, directing the successful &quot;I Want My Maypo!&quot; spot. In 1954, he was commissioned by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum to make an animated short film, the first short ever funded by an art museum.

Hubley (alongside his wife Faith) is often considered the most important figure in American independent animation and one of the most important figures in the history of animation. The Hubleys&#x27; film &quot;Moonbird&quot; (1959) became the first independent film to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Short. Hubley collaborated with jazz musicians like Dizzy Gillespie, Benny Carter, and Quincy Jones and often used unscripted, improvised dialogue in his films, creating an entirely new way of expressing emotion and feeling through the medium of animation. His films are considered important in the evolution of post-war modernism in film. The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences claim the Hubleys&#x27; films &quot;bucked the establishment and defined an era of independent animation production&quot;.

== Early life and education ==

Hubley was born on May 21, 1914, at 1212 11th Street (now Shore Drive) in Marinette, Wisconsin. His father, John Raymond Hubley, was a secretary at the John B Goodman Company – a logging company – in Marinette, and his mother, Verena Kirkham Hubley, was a homemaker. Verena&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Jacob Leisen, was one of the founders of the Leisen &amp; Henes Brewing Company in Menominee, Michigan. The Leisen-Kirkham family were economically stable, allowing Verena&#x27;s parents to send her to the Art Institute of Chicago, where she studied painting from 1907 to 1909. Verena&#x27;s father, Richard Archibald Kirkham, was also a painter and one of the earliest photographers in Menominee.

Hubley was encouraged at a young age to become an artist by his mother and maternal grandfather. In a 1974 interview, Hubley stated &quot;I used to watch my grandfather when I was a little kid...It was always ordained that I would go to art school as soon as I got out of high school&quot;.

In 1921, John Raymond Hubley partnered with his cousin Loren O. Robeck opened Robeck &amp; Hubley, a Ford dealership at 1919 Hall Avenue in Marinette. The business was only modestly successful and closed in 1928, the same year the Hubleys left Marinette and moved to Iron Mountain, Michigan. Hubley attended Iron Mountain High School from 1929 to 1932. While a student, Hubley would partake in a wide array of extracurricular activities, including the debate, drama, a capella, basketball, Hi-Y (a male-only group associated with the YMCA), and mathematics clubs. Hubley also wrote for the school&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Mountaineer&quot;, and from 1930 to 1932 provided the illustrations for the school&#x27;s yearbook, &quot;The Argonaut&quot;. While in high school, Hubley worked as a bank cashier in Iron Mountain.

In the fall of 1933, Hubley enrolled at the ArtCenter College of Design in Los Angeles, California, to study painting. Unable to support himself, Hubley lived with his aunt, Kathleen Kirkham Woodruff, who had moved to Los Angeles for her film career. Her husband, Harry Woodruff, inspired the character Mr. Magoo. During his time in college, the newly-formed Walt Disney Animation Studio was scouting local art schools for talent. Hubley&#x27;s painting talents caught the studio&#x27;s eye, and he was hired as a background and layout artist.

== Career ==
===Working at Disney and the 1941 Animator&#x27;s Strike: 1936–1941===
Hubley started working at Walt Disney Productions on January 1, 1936. He started as an apprentice on &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937) producing background tracings and painting backgrounds and layouts for animators. He was quickly promoted to an art director for &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (1940).

On February 25, 1939, the architect Frank Lloyd Wright visited the studio with a copy of &quot;The Tale of the Czar Durandai &quot;(1934), a Russian animated film directed by Ivan Ivanov-Vano. Wright showed the film to Disney&#x27;s staff, including Hubley,
 who was greatly inspired by the film&#x27;s stylized visuals and animation.

Hubley was chosen as one of three directors (alongside Dick Kelsey and McLaren Stewart) to handle the &quot;Rite of Spring&quot; passage of &quot;Fantasia&quot; (1940). Specifically, Hubley directed the section covering the molten stage of Earth&#x27;s creation to the cooling off into greenery. Hubley was upset by the film&#x27;s inaccuracy, stating that &quot;it was not scientifically accurate in terms of the demise of the reptiles. It was more likely they were frozen by the ice age. But Disney didn&#x27;t want an ice age; he wanted a desert sequence&quot;. Hubley also painted several backgrounds for the &quot;Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; segment. This same year, Hubley moved out of the Woodruffs&#x27; house to his own house at 3827 Ronda Vista Place in Los Angeles. Hubley lived here with fellow Disney Studios artist and actor John McLeish.

In the spring of 1941, employees at Disney Studios were unhappy with salary inequalities and the studio discouraging unionization. Hubley and his wife Claudia both participated in the 1941 Disney animators&#x27; strike, with John taking dozens of photographs to document the event. Hubley was one of the better-paid employees of the studio, making $67.50 a week (equivalent to $1,367.04 in 2023), but decided to strike in support of unionization. The strike, organized by Hubley&#x27;s friend Art Babbitt, strengthened Hubley&#x27;s relationship with strikers like Bill Littlejohn, Herb Klynn, Stephen Bosustow, and Jules Engel, all of whom later worked with Hubley at UPA or Hubley Studios. On August 10, 1941, John and Claudia were two of the 256 employees fired by the studio when the strike ended.

===Enlistment and beginning of UPA: 1942–1948===
After being fired from Disney Studios, Hubley briefly worked at Columbia&#x27;s Screen Gems under Dave Fleischer. Hubley called Fleischer one of &quot;one of the world&#x27;s intellectual lightweights&quot;. Hubley disliked his work at Screen Gems, but Fleischer&#x27;s detachment from the employees allowed Hubley a creative freedom he had not found at the Disney Studio.
On November 23, 1942, Hubley enlisted in the United States Armed Forces to work in the First Motion Picture Unit, an independent film production unit in the Air Force. Here, Hubley directed animated training films related to flight safety and firearm equipment. Though uncredited, &quot;Old Blackout Joe&quot; (1942) was Hubley&#x27;s first time directing. Hubley&#x27;s time in the Air Force was leisurely, and he &quot;got to go home every night&quot; and &quot;spent half [his] time drawing [gags] and passing them around&quot;. The Air Force had few expectations for how the films should aesthetically look or feel, allowing Hubley and his team near-complete creative control. Hubley, who had grown increasingly more interested in the works of modern artists like Paul Klee, pushed his films to have flat, abstract visuals. Since the films were often uncredited, it is unknown how many films Hubley directed for the First Motion Picture Unit, but &quot;Flight Safety: Landing Accidents&quot; (1946) was likely his last. Hubley is credited with the animations on &quot;Tuesday in November&quot; (1945), produced by the US Office of War Information.

In 1943, Hubley was contacted by the United Automobile Workers (UAW), who were looking to hire Hubley to produce a short film endorsing Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1944 Presidential Election. Hubley took the project to the newly-formed Industrial Film and Poster Service, which was soon renamed to United Productions of America (UPA). The film, &quot;Hell-Bent for Election&quot; (1944), was storyboarded by Hubley and directed by Chuck Jones. At UPA, Hubley found the creative freedom he had yearned for his entire career. The UAW was pleased with &quot;Hell-Bent for Election&quot; and hired UPA for &quot;The Brotherhood of Man&quot; (1946), a film on race relations. Hubley co-wrote the film and led the production design. With both UAW films, Hubley pushed for a modernist aesthetic of sleek lines, flat shapes, and bold colors that were completely unique to UPA&#x27;s films.

By 1947, Hubley had been promoted to vice president and creative head of UPA. That same year, UPA founder Stephen Bosustow struck a distribution deal with Columbia: UPA would produce several &quot;trial&quot; films for the studio using Columbia&#x27;s cartoon stars The Fox and The Crow. If the films were a success, Columbia would enter a formal distribution partnership with UPA. Hubley was tasked with directing the first &quot;trial&quot; films, &quot;Robin Hoodlum&quot; (1948) and &quot;The Magic Fluke&quot; (1949).

===UPA and Mr. Magoo: 1949–1952===

Hubley and the UPA team felt restricted with The Fox and The Crow shorts, and approached Columbia with an idea for an original short. Hubley, inspired by his uncle Harry Woodruff, pitched an idea for a short-tempered, aggressive old curmudgeon. &quot;The character was based upon an uncle of mine, Harry Woodruff&quot;he later said. Hubley and writer Millard Kaufman would name the character Mr. Magoo after Point Mugu in Malibu, California.While Hubley is often credited as the sole creator of Mr. Magoo, the character was a combined effort with Kaufman, who based Magoo partially on his own uncle.

Hubley and UPA founder Zachary Schwartz made their intentions with UPA clear in a 1946 issue of &quot;Film Quarterly&quot;. Hubley and Schwartz believed it had become &quot;necessary for the craftsman-animators of the motion picture industry to analyze and reevaluate their medium&quot;. Hubley and Schwartz were influenced by their shared experience in the First Motion Picture Unit making training films, specifically by how animation was being used as an educational tool, as the two believed &quot;animation usage in the educational film [was] singularly undeveloped&quot; before the war. Now, Hubley and Schwartz understood the &quot;significance of the animated film as means of communication&quot; and aimed to create films that could &quot;express the essence of an idea&quot; with &quot;line, shape, color, and symbols&quot;.

Hubley served as the supervising director of &quot;Gerald McBoing-Boing&quot; (1950), written by Theodor Geisel and directed by Robert Cannon. The film won UPA their first Academy Award for Best Short Subject Cartoon, which &quot;stung&quot; and &quot;really shocked&quot; Hubley, claimed layout artist Bill Hurtz. Hubley, now determined to win his own Academy Award for the studio, directed &quot;Rooty Toot Toot&quot; (1952), UPA&#x27;s most expensive and ambitious film at the time. Hubley wrote the film alongside Bill Scott and hired Phil Moore to compose the score. At the recommendation of Art Babbitt, Hubley hired dancer Olga Lunick to choreograph the film&#x27;s dance elements, and much of the film&#x27;s animation was done by Betty Boop creator Grim Natwick. The film&#x27;s dark themes of murder, sex, violence, jealousy, and infidelity were a &quot;groundbreaking moment for animation&quot;. While the film was nominated for the Academy Award, it lost to &quot;The Two Mouseketeers&quot;. The same year, Hubley also directed the animated segments of Irving Reis&#x27;s &quot;The Four Poster&quot; (1952).

In September 1951, UPA layout artist Bernyce Fleury testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee that several UPA artists, including Hubley, were promoting communism through their films. In response, the following April Columbia sent UPA a list of eight suspected communist employees which included Hubley. Columbia, threatening to end their distribution deal with UPA, wanted the named employees to either confess or leave UPA. Hubley refused to denounce communism and was subsequently fired from UPA on May 31, 1952. Reflecting upon his time at UPA, Hubley would say &quot;it got too large. Before we knew where we were, we were getting more and more concerned with administration and less with creation.&quot;

=== Independent success with Storyboard, Inc. 1952–1969 ===
Following his firing from UPA, Hubley was effectively blacklisted from the animation industry. He found work illustrating album covers for Westminster and Clef Records for artists such as Al Hibbler, Aaron Copland, Slim Gaillard, and Chico O&#x27;Farrill. These covers showed Hubley&#x27;s art progressing further into abstract expressionism and modernism, taking heavy influence from Pablo Picasso.

Still &quot;undercover&quot; in Hollywood, Hubley founded Storyboard, Inc. (sometimes referred to as Storyboard Studios or simply Storyboard) in 1953. Since television work was both uncredited and in high demand, Hubley quickly found work directing animated commercials for companies such as Heinz, Bank of America, and E-Z Pop. Since many of his clients were looking for a fast turnaround, Hubley&#x27;s highly-stylized approach to limited animation and bold graphics became both practical and popular. For these early commercials, Hubley would again collaborate with animators such as Bill Littlejohn, Emery Hawkins, and Rob Scribner. Also in 1953, Hubley and producer Michael Shore began developing an animated adaptation of the musical &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;. Shore wanted Hubley to direct, and Hubley was motivated to &quot;develop the visual art even further than the UPA films&quot;. Shore had difficulty interesting studios with the project due to the musical&#x27;s strong racial themes, but eventually secured funding and a distribution deal with the Distributors Corporation of America (DCA). Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald were signed on for the film, marking their only collaboration. By the end of 1954, all of the dialogue and music had been recorded for the film and Hubley had assembled a large team of past collaborators, such as Littlejohn, Babbitt, and Les Goldman. Faith Elliott (née Chestman), later Hubley&#x27;s second wife, served as a script supervisor on the film. While Hubley was very excited for the project, his &quot;easygoing manner&quot; made him &quot;hard to work with because he wasn&#x27;t very disciplined&quot;. The musical&#x27;s writers, Burton Lane and Yip Harburg (a fellow victim of the blacklist), kept a close watch on Hubley, and tensions soon arose over the musical direction of the film and Hubley&#x27;s visuals. Issues also arose between DCA and members of the film&#x27;s crew who were members of the Screen Cartoonists Guild (SCG) and not the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE). DCA was concerned that since many members of the crew were not IATSE, the film would not be played in theaters. Soon thereafter, DCA president Fred J. Schwartz received a call from IATSE representative Roy Brewer, who ousted Hubley for his refusal to cooperate with the HUAC. Hubley, who still refused to testify before the HUAC, caused DCA&#x27;s parent company to stop funding the film. While Schwartz did attempt to save the film by approaching RKO, it was no use. The film was canceled in 1955, with the contents of the entire studio impounded.

In 1955, after the collapse of &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, Hubley moved Storyboard, Inc. with him to New York City, where he soon married his second wife, Faith Hubley (née Chestman). Faith, herself an editor and script supervisor on films such as &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; (1957), collaborated closely with her husband on all of their subsequent films. Towards the end of 1954, Hubley and James J. Sweeney, the director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, began discussing the museum commissioning a film from Hubley. Hubley and Sweeney were determined to create a film that also served as a piece of modern art and communicated the importance of &quot;play&quot; and &quot;the sensuous pleasures of [approaching pictures through] the eye rather than [the] intellectual pleasure [of] the ear&quot;. The resulting film, &quot;The Adventures of *&quot; (1957) was the first short film Hubley directed after leaving UPA, as well as the first animated film ever commissioned by an art museum. The film&#x27;s visuals were heavily influenced by the Guggenheim Museum&#x27;s collection of modern art, as well as Hubley&#x27;s desire to &quot;transform [animation] from hard-lined cel animation to textured, subtle, new styles more connected to the history of art than to the Disney or UPA look&quot;. Benny Carter composed the film&#x27;s score, including vibraphone by Lionel Hampton. The film won several awards, including a diploma speciale from the 1957 Venice Film Festival and the Grand Prize at the 1958 Montevideo Film Festival. In 1957, Hubley was also hired by the advertising firm Fletcher, Richards, Calkins &amp; Holden to direct the hugely successful &quot;I Want My Maypo!&quot; commercial. For the first time in his career, Hubley used the voice of one of his children, his stepson Mark, for the commercial. The commercial led to a boom of sales for Maypo, and the character of &quot;Marky Maypo&quot; (named after his stepson) became the cereal&#x27;s mascot. The commercial is also credited for beginning the trend of using animation to sell products to children, as it &quot;exploit[ed] children&#x27;s less than fully developed ability to distinguish between entertainment and selling&quot;. Around this time, Hubley met musician Dizzy Gillespie through mutual friend Paul Robeson, and the Hubleys soon made their first film with Gillespie, &quot;A Date with Dizzy&quot; (1956). The film contained many of the advertisements Hubley had already made at Storyboard, Inc., as well as an original segment by a then-unknown R.O. Blechman.

Following the success of the Maypo spot, John and Faith turned their attention to producing more short films. Their next film, &quot;Harlem Wednesday&quot; (1957), marked the first time John and Faith were credited alongside one another on-screen (though Faith is credited as Faith Elliott). The film, an experimental montage of paintings by Gregorio Prestopino with a score by Carter, further explored the Hubleys&#x27; desires to push animation towards modern art. Their next film, &quot;Tender Game&quot; (1958), included an unused track by Fitzgerald from &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;. Hubley experimented with multiple exposure effects on the film to give it a distinct look and dimensionality. Mark Hubley would later remark &quot;the film has always struck me...as a love letter between [John and Faith], the figures...look like mom and dad&quot;. The film won the grand prize at both the Venice Film Festival and the Montevideo Film Festival. Hubley was inspired by his earlier work on the Mr. Magoo films with Jim Backus to experiment with films centered around improvised dialogue, as he often encouraged Backus to riff in the studio. In 1958, Hubley recorded his sons Mark (aged 6) and Ray (aged 3) his sons playing a game where they search for a &quot;Moonbird&quot;, referring to a pet bird the family had lost recently by leaving a window open. Faith edited the conversations together into a narrative, and John enlisted Ed Smith and former UPA director Robert Cannon for animation. The resulting film, &quot;Moonbird&quot; (1959), marked one of the earliest examples of using real children voices in an animated film. &quot;Moonbird&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short in 1960, becoming the first independent film to win in the category. The success of &quot;Moonbird&quot; caught the attention of Susan Burnett, the film officer of the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF), who commissioned the Hubleys to make a film for UNICEF. For the first time, Hubley used the voices of all of he and Faith&#x27;s children, though most of their vocals are gurgles and mumbles made by his infant daughters Emily and Georgia. The film, &quot;Children of the Sun&quot; (1960), addressed &quot;how hunger affects the world&#x27;s children&quot;.

Hubley wanted to make a film about Albert Einstein&#x27;s Theory of Relativity, and was inspired after reading Harlow Shapley&#x27;s &quot;Of Stars and Men&quot; (1959) in 1959. Intrigued by Shapley&#x27;s attempts to understand mankind&#x27;s place in the universe, Hubley wrote to Shapley with the idea to adapt the book&#x27;s themes into an animated film. Instead of simply writing a script and getting Shapley&#x27;s approval, Hubley and Shapley chose to collaborate closely on nearly every aspect of the film, with Hubley sending Shapley detailed outlines for the film&#x27;s structure and frequently traveling to Shapley&#x27;s home in Peterborough, New Hampshire, to meet with him. Hubley and Shapley became close friends during this period, resulting in &quot;Of Stars and Men&quot; (1962), the Hubleys&#x27; first feature-length film. The film follows a very loose narrative style, relying predominantly on Shapley&#x27;s narration. Hubley&#x27;s children would again appear in the film, with their improvised conversations again being presented much in the same way as in &quot;Moonbird&quot;. Due to the nature of the film&#x27;s presentation, the Hubleys, audiences, and distributors alike were unsure if the film could be categorized as a documentary. At the 1961 San Francisco International Film Festival, the film won Best Documentary, and at the Venice Film Festival - where the Hubleys&#x27; films had been previously screened as part of the animation category - the film was placed in the feature category alongside live-action films. Author Sybil DelGaudio cites the film as one of the earliest examples of an animated documentary. While the film was screened in festivals as early as 1962, the Hubleys would continue to revise the film and appeal to both Columbia and Show Corp. for distribution; it would be released to the general public in 1964 by Films, Inc.

While shopping around &quot;Of Stars and Men&quot;, the Hubleys collaborated again with Gillespie for &quot;The Hole&quot; (1962). Gillespie and actor George Matthews improvised a conversation between two construction workers discussing life and nuclear war. The film mirrored American anxieties over the Cold War, as it was in production during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The film won the Hubleys their second Academy Award for Best Animated Short, with John and Faith both being recognized by the Academy for the first time. &quot;The Hole&quot; led to the World Law Foundation commissioning the Hubleys to make &quot;The Hat&quot; (1964), a spiritual successor of sorts to &quot;The Hole&quot; centered around an improvised conversation between Gillespie and Dudley Moore as soldiers debating the morality of war. &quot;The Hat&quot; came from the World Law Foundation&#x27;s initiative to &quot;reach...broader audiences&quot; through &quot;arts and media&quot;. Both &quot;The Hole&quot; and &quot;The Hat&quot; use a more grounded visual style than the abstract expressionism of &quot;The Adventures of *&quot; and &quot;Of Stars and Men&quot; and address more serious themes of violence, nuclear war, nuclear anxieties, and death. &quot;The Hat&quot; was the only film by the Hubleys distributed by McGraw-Hill, and was also released as a book with illustrations taken from the film. Carter would collaborate with the Hubleys again on &quot;Urbanissimo&quot; (1966), a film humorously examining the impact of urban sprawl on the environment made for Expo 67 in Montreal, Quebec. &quot;A Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass Double Feature&quot; (1966), a film interpreting the music of jazz musician Herb Alpert, was released the same year. John and Faith won their third Academy Award for the short, and the film is today considered to be an early prototypical example of a music video.
The film was distributed by Paramount, marking the first collaboration between Hubley and a major Hollywood studio following his 1952 blacklisting.

Hubley began teaching filmmaking at Harvard in 1962, becoming the first teacher of animation at Harvard&#x27;s Visual Arts Center. Hubley wrote an adaptation of Edwin Abbot&#x27;s 1884 novella &quot;Flatland&quot;, and collaborated with his students as well as Dudley Moore and several members of Beyond the Fringe. The resulting film, &quot;Flatland&quot; (1965), was directed by Eric Martin. As early as 1964, filmmaker Joseph Koenig pitched a film explaining the importance of voting to the National Film Board of Canada (NFB). Hubley was chosen to direct the film for the NFB, which eventually became &quot;The Cruise&quot; (1967). The film was designed to be an educational tool for school use, though Hubley had very little involvement with creating the curriculum surrounding the film. The film would be screened in high schools and colleges across the United States and Canada throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Hubley&#x27;s involvement with education would continue in the 1970s, when he and Faith became professors of film at Yale University teaching animation and &quot;The Visualization of Abstract Themes&quot;.

The Hubleys continued to make short films together for the rest of the 1960s. Their next film, &quot;Windy Day&quot; (1967) featured an improvised conversation between their daughters Georgia and Emily &quot;explor[ing] the child&#x27;s projection of fantasy to enact romance, marriage, and growing up&quot;. The film was nominated for the 1968 Academy Award for Best Animated Short, but lost to Disney&#x27;s &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day&quot;. The Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions commissioned Hubley for &quot;Zuckerkandl!&quot; (1968), a short film interpreting a comical routine by Robert M. Hutchins. The short was also released as a book with illustrations by Hubley. Hubley was commissioned again for Storyboard, Inc.&#x27;s next film, &quot;Of Men and Demons&quot; (1969), by IBM for Expo &#x27;70 in Osaka, Japan. The film earned John and Faith their fifth Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Short.

=== Hubley Studios, Inc. and late career: 1970–1977 ===
1970 saw the release of Hubley&#x27;s fifteenth independent directorial credit with &quot;Eggs&quot; (1970). For the first time, John and Faith collaborated with musician Quincy Jones, who composed and performed the film&#x27;s score. The film addressed themes of fertility and death and continues Hubley&#x27;s run of collaborating with musicians as voice actors, as singers Anita Ellis and Grady Tate lent their voices for the film, as did actor David Burns. The film was entirely animated by Tissa David, a recent hire of the Hubleys best known as the second woman to ever direct a feature-length animated film, &quot;Bonjour Paris!&quot; (1953). Around this time, Storyboard, Inc. was renamed Hubley Studios, Inc. (sometimes referred to as The Hubley Studio or Hubley Studios), indicating Hubley&#x27;s growing confidence towards using his name as the effects of the blacklist faded away.

Despite the critical acclaim the studio&#x27;s films received, Hubley was still struggling financially. &quot;Film shorts seem inevitably to be financial failures, for the only people who come out ahead on them are the distributors. Even &quot;Moonbird&quot;, for instance, grossed at least as much as its production costs (about $25,000), but only a third of the gross wound up at Storyboard, Inc.&quot;, revealed a 1964 profile by The Harvard Crimson. By the beginning of the 1970s, John and Faith understood they needed to take on more commercial work in order to fund their shorts, and began contributing animated segments for New York-based children&#x27;s variety programs such as &quot;The Electric Company&quot; and &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Notably, Hubley directed the &quot;Letter E&quot; segment for the latter&#x27;s first episode on November 10, 1969. Hubley directed over thirty animated segments for the show between 1969 and 1977. His most notable contributions would be on &quot;The Electric Company&quot;, where Hubley directed &quot;The Adventures of Letterman&quot; segments from 1972 to 1977 featuring Joan Rivers, Gene Wilder, and Zero Mostel. On both &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;The Electric Company&quot; Hubley would again collaborate with artists like Quincy Jones and Dizzy Gillespie for voice acting and music. To help handle the new workload at the studio, Hubley hired several new artists, including Tissa David and Michael Sporn.

While working on animated segments for &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;The Electric Company&quot;, Hubley became more recognized for his television work (as he hadn&#x27;t made a television commercial since the late 1950s). CBS approached the Hubleys to produce an educational program on geology for the station. Hubley enlisted the help of geoscientist Bruce Heezen to research the film. Originally titled &quot;What&#x27;s Under My Foot?&quot;, &quot;Dig&quot; (1972) premiered on CBS on April 8, 1972. The film&#x27;s music was composed by Jones and featured Jack Warden and Hubley&#x27;s son, Ray. The following year, the film was adapted into a book co-written by John and Faith. Much in the same way &quot;The Hole&quot; and &quot;The Hat&quot; were companion pieces, Hubley&#x27;s next film, &quot;Cockaboody&quot; (1973) was a companion piece to &quot;Windy Day&quot; (1967). Hubley again recorded a conversation between his daughters Georgia and Emily and brought it to life through animation. Unlike &quot;Windy Day&quot;, John and Faith collaborated with students in their animation class at Yale University to create the film. &quot;Cockaboody&quot; was created in conjunction with the Hubleys&#x27; students at Yale, as well as the Yale Child Study Center. The process of making &quot;Cockaboody&quot; at Yale was filmed by Howard Sayre Weaver for the documentary &quot;In Quest of Cockaboody&quot; (1973). &quot;Cockaboody&quot; marked the first time The Hubley Studio name was used in one of Hubley&#x27;s films, and the second film at the studio animated solely by David.

John and Faith earned another Academy Award nomination for their next shot, &quot;Voyage to the Next&quot; (1974), another collaboration with Gillespie, as well as actresses Maureen Stapleton and Dee Dee Bridgewater commissioned by The Institute for World Order. Continuing the themes of previous films like &quot;Eggs&quot; and &quot;The Hat&quot;, &quot;Voyage to the Next&quot; tackles themes of environmentalism, nationalism, and war. The same year, the Zagreb Film Festival held a career-long retrospective on John and Faith&#x27;s films, with John serving as president of the year&#x27;s jury. In an ironic turn of events, Hubley&#x27;s next film, &quot;People People People&quot; (1975), was commissioned by the United States Bicentennial Commission. Hubley, now being commissioned by the same government that had practically forced him out of UPA in 1952, was finally free from the effects of the blacklist. This same year, both John and Faith were awarded the Winsor McCay Award from ASIFA, the highest honor an artist in the animation industry can receive.

Now one of the most respected artists in an industry that had blacklisted him only two decades prior, Hubley began his most ambitious project to date. As early as 1973, John and Faith became interested in adapting Erik Erikson&#x27;s Theory of the Eight Stages of Life in a feature-length animated film. As they did with &quot;Cockaboody&quot;, the Hubleys planned to make the film in conjunction with Yale&#x27;s Film Laboratory Center. Initially, Erikson was dismissive of the idea, but by 1975 he agreed, with CBS interested in airing the film. Initially, CBS and Hubley agreed the film would be three half-hour episodes, but CBS changed it to be one ninety-minute film during the final three months of production. John and Faith created the film&#x27;s storyboards alongside their Yale class, supervised by professor Ken Kennison. Hubley picked many unknown actors with few or no prior credits for the film, including Lawrence Pressman, his then-girlfriend Lanna Saunders, and Yale student Meryl Streep in her first acting role. The Hubley children also appear in the film for different stages of life. &quot;Everybody Rides the Carousel&quot; (1976) was broadcast on September 10, 1976. Much like the Hubleys&#x27; previous films, the film is built from improvised conversations between the actors relating to Erikson&#x27;s stages of life. The larger production led to Hubley Studios hiring a handful of new employees, including Erikson&#x27;s daughter, Sue Erikson, coincidentally a student of the Hubleys at Yale. The film was a success, and won the Blue Ribbon Award at that year&#x27;s American Film Festival.

Around the time Hubley began production on &quot;Everybody Rides the Carousel&quot;, producer Martin Rosen hired Hubley to direct an animated adaptation of Richard Adams&#x27; &quot;Watership Down&quot; (1972). Hubley flew to London to meet Rosen at the new studio Rosen opened for the film and the two took trips to the English countryside for inspiration, but Hubley&#x27;s interest in the project quickly faded. Rosen and Hubley frequently disagreed on the film&#x27;s narrative, with Rosen pushing for grittiness and Hubley pushing for a lighter tone and more abstract visual style. Hubley had signed an exclusivity contract to work on the film, but Rosen soon found out he was secretly developing a new film, leading to Rosen firing Hubley from the film and becoming the director himself. Hubley&#x27;s work can be seen in the opening &quot;fable&quot; scene, animated by Bill Littlejohn, Phil Duncan, Ruth Kissane, and Barrie Nelson. Hubley is often credited as the co-director of the film, but his name does not appear in the credits. In November 1976, cartoonist Garry Trudeau approached Hubley with the idea of an animated special featuring Trudeau&#x27;s characters from Doonesbury. Hubley and Trudeau had already known one another, as Trudeau was one of Hubley&#x27;s students in the early seventies, and Trudeau and the Hubleys greatly enjoyed working with one another. In 1976, Doonesbury was one of the most popular newspaper comics in America, having won a Pulitzer Prize the year prior and frequently making headlines for being dropped by papers across the country over Trudeau&#x27;s decision to tackle topical and controversial real-world events. Unlike their previous films, John and Faith shared directing and producing credits with Trudeau and followed a tight script for the film. Toward the middle of production in February 1977 Hubley died, leaving Faith and Trudeau to finish the film themselves. &quot;A Doonesbury Special&quot; (1977) was broadcast on NBC on November 27, 1977. The film earned Hubley a posthumous Academy Award Nomination and posthumous Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, tying with &quot;Oh, My Darling&quot; by Dutch animator Børge Ring.

== Personal life ==

On May 30, 1941, Hubley married Claudia Sewell, one of Disney&#x27;s &quot;ink and paint girls&quot;, in Reno, Nevada. The couple did not go on a honeymoon, and instead sped back to California to partake in the 1941 animator&#x27;s strike, which had started the day prior. The Hubleys moved to a house at 10543 Woodbridge Street in the Toluca Lake section of Los Angeles. The couple&#x27;s first child, Anne, was born in 1942. John and Claudia had two more children, Mark and Susan, while living at 11689 Laurelwood Drive in Los Angeles. Both houses were only a short drive from the UPA studio in Burbank.

Sometime in the 1940s, Hubley met Faith Elliott, a stage manager from New York City who had come to Los Angeles to become a script clerk at Columbia. Faith recalled she &quot;met John in Hollywood...when he was in the Army&quot;. The two became friends and remained friends during Hubley&#x27;s time at UPA. When Hubley was fired from UPA and began work on &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, Yip Harburg assigned Elliott to be Hubley&#x27;s assistant. By all accounts, the relationship between Hubley and Elliott was platonic, with Elliott saying they &quot;both... controlled their friendship for ten years and after all [Hubley] was a married man with three children&quot;. Nonetheless, as Elliott and Hubley grew closer, Hubley&#x27;s own marriage crumbled. John and Claudia divorced in 1954, with his children staying in Los Angeles while Hubley left to focus on Storyboard, Inc. in New York City.

Hubley married Elliott in 1955. Faith Elliott was born Faith Chestman in 1924, but kept the name of her first husband, Melvin Elliott, a radio announcer on WQXR. Faith already had one child, Mark, born in 1952. When the Hubleys married, they vowed to make one film a year together, and to have dinner with their family every night. The Hubleys moved to the Upper West Side of New York City at 110 Riverside Drive, and had three more children: Raymond, Emily, and Georgia. All of the Hubley&#x27;s children would voice characters in their films, with Mark and Ray appearing in &quot;Moonbird&quot; and &quot;Dig&quot;, and Emily and Georgia appearing in &quot;Windy Day&quot; and &quot;Cockaboody&quot;. All four are featured in &quot;Everybody Rides the Carousel&quot;. Raymond Hubley later remembered &quot;there were a lot of enforced things...in our family that [were] connected to the work regiment of [John and Faith&#x27;s] relationship...they used to have a thing where we&#x27;d go around the table and tell [about] your day, and it was like a pitch meeting or something&quot;. Many of Hubleys kids went on to pursue their own artistic careers, with Raymond becoming a film editor, Emily becoming an animator, and Georgia founding the band Yo La Tengo with her husband Ira Kaplan. Given the nature of John and Faith&#x27;s collaboration, Faith was sometimes looked over professionally with the attention and credit for their films given to her husband. Hubley actively fought against this, highlighting Faith&#x27;s contributions and their collaboration whenever possible. Following Hubley&#x27;s solo Academy Award win for &quot;Moonbird&quot;, he and Faith would be nominated together for the rest of their career. In his final interview before his death, Hubley insisted interviewer Michael Barrier was &quot;sure to write [the article] in terms of the partnership of me and Faith, because all of the films, right from the beginning of our stuff, from Guggenheim on up, have always been a very close collaboration, creatively and on every other level.&quot;

Hubley remained close with a number of UPA and Disney animators, many of whom he worked with on Storyboard, Inc. films. The Hubleys also became close friends with musician Dizzy Gillespie in the 1950s, meeting through mutual friend Paul Robeson. Gillespie made several films with Storyboard, Inc., including the Academy Award-winning &quot;The Hole&quot;. Gillespie &quot;respect[ed] them and appreciate[d] their creativity&quot;, calling them &quot;wonderful people, very warm and very generous&quot; who &quot;seem[ed] to see me in things other people don&#x27;t see&quot;. Gillespie was a constant presence around the Hubley&#x27;s house, with Mark Hubley remembering John and Faith &quot;having parties [with Gillespie]&quot; often, and Gillespie once &quot;standing on his head playing &#x27;Happy Birthday&#x27;&quot; for Raymond. Hubley was also close with Benny Carter and Quincy Jones.

== Political views and HUAC investigation ==

Hubley was a lifelong registered Democrat. In 1951, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) heard the testimony of UPA layout artist Bernyce Fleury, who claimed Hubley&#x27;s films promoted communism and Hubley held communist sympathies. On April 25, 1952, Hubley was formally subpoenaed by the HUAC to appear at the Los Angeles Federal Building for questioning. The subpoena was served to Hubley&#x27;s attorney on May 2. While Hubley did leave UPA, he did not respond to the subpoena, and on February 2, 1953, Hubley was again summoned to the Federal Building for questioning. Boyle found that Hubley had moved in the year prior before receiving the subpoena, hence his lack of response. For an unknown reason, Hubley was not subpoenaed again until May 4, 1955, to appear before the HUAC. Hubley responded, and was set to appear before the HUAC on June 20, 1956. Hubley&#x27;s attorney, Arthur McNulty, postponed the hearing twice, first until June 28, then to July 5, likely since Hubley had already moved to New York City.

On July 5, 1956, Hubley appeared before the HUAC in Room 227 of the Los Angeles Federal Building with McNulty as his counsel. California Representatives Clyde Doyle and Donald L. Jackson presided over the hearing. When asked if he held communist sympathies, Hubley responded &quot;I feel that in the area of politics...I do not feel personally that your committee should ask me to reveal or speak on these matters, either with my opinions or associations...I do not agree it is a proper question for a person such as myself to be asked&quot;. Hubley invoked the Fifth Amendment for the remainder of the hearing. When asked if his films at UPA promoted communist ideas, Hubley replied:
I have a lot of opinions on art...It is public work, and anyone is welcome to examine it and to look at it, and I stand on my work, and not on my opinions. My opinions can change, and I have changed them many times, all through my life, and I like the right we have to be able to change them. But the work stands. I have no shame about it. If anyone wants to examine it, it is there...My work has been my own work, and my own talent, and my own opinions.

Hubley was never formally indicted by the HUAC, but the investigation did effectively blacklist him from Hollywood afterwards. He named his new studio Storyboard, Inc. out of fear of using his own name.

== Style and technique ==
While at UPA, Hubley&#x27;s films were more flat and graphic than those of Disney Studios or Warner Bros. Cartoons. Hubley was greatly influenced by Ivan Ivanov-Vano&#x27;s &quot;The Tale of Czar Durandai&quot; (1934), which used limited animation and flat compositions to create an incredibly stylized world. While Hubley&#x27;s early UPA films featuring The Fox and the Crow animate the main characters in a style similar to that of Disney Studios, the films&#x27; backgrounds showcase Hubley&#x27;s influence from European design. &quot;Punchy De Leon&quot; opens with a panning shot of a highly-stylized graphic background that uses skewed perspective, large blocks of color, and exaggerated shape language. Hints of Hubley&#x27;s stylization of background perspectives and crows shots can also be seen in &quot;Robin Hoodlum&quot; and &quot;The Magic Fluke&quot;.

After UPA finished its trial run with Columbia in 1950, Hubley&#x27;s films became more visually ambitious. As the supervising director of &quot;Gerald McBoing-Boing&quot;, Hubley oversaw the film&#x27;s unique visuals provided by designer Bill Hurtz and colorists Herb Klynn and Jules Engel. &quot;Rooty Toot Toot&quot; uses complex color blocking to tell its story visually, and implements even stronger skewed perspective and stylized line art backgrounds. Unlike &quot;Gerald Mc-Boing Boing&quot;, which uses abstract blocks of color in its backgrounds, &quot;Rooty Toot Toot&quot; experimented with different patterns and brush types. The film&#x27;s last act is illustrated in the style of sponge painting, pulling inspiration from European abstract expressionist artists. This push towards replicating brush strokes and printmaking in backgrounds extended to the animated segments Hubley directed for &quot;The Four Poster&quot;.

For his independent directorial debut, &quot;The Adventures of *&quot;, Hubley drew heavily from the visual style of artists like Paul Klee, Joan Miró, and Pablo Picasso. The film&#x27;s backgrounds were painted with sponges and thick brushes for texture. The characters were drawn in yellow crayon on black paper to give them a more unique, handmade look. In subsequent films, Hubley would experiment with watercolors, ballpoint pen, and fabric markers to give his films distinctive visuals. Hubley used both cels and the Xerox method (popularized by Ub Iwerks on the 1961 film &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;) depending on the film. For &quot;Cockaboody&quot;, characters were drawn on paper by Tissa David, then cut out and placed on cels. Hubley sometimes opted to use underlighting - wherein the drawing or cel is lit from below rather than above - to make the films more distinct, and often used multiple exposure for more complex elements, like the river in &quot;Tender Game&quot; or the abstract color section in &quot;Everybody Rides the Carousel&quot;.

While directing &quot;The Ragtime Bear&quot;, Hubley encouraged actor Jim Backus to improvise his dialogue and ramble on as his character Mr. Magoo would. Bauckus&#x27; unique vocal performance would make Mr. Magoo a hit, becoming UPA&#x27;s flagship character. The idea of using improvised dialogue in animation was not created by Hubley, as Dave Fleischer often encouraged his actors to make up their own dialogue for his Popeye and Betty Boop shorts, but the success of Bauckus as Mr. Magoo inspired Hubley to pursue stream of consciousness improvisation for his independent films. Hubley took the idea a step further by recording his children playing together, interpreting their conversations through animation after Faith had edited them together into a story. Films like &quot;The Hat&quot;, &quot;The Hole&quot;, and &quot;Everybody Rides the Carousel&quot; consist entirely of improvised conversations between actors, and &quot;Zuckerlandl!&quot; is an animated interpretation of a comedy routine by Robert M. Hutchins.

Many of Hubley&#x27;s films at Storyboard, Inc. with his wife explore war and the nature of conflict. &quot;The Hat&quot;, &quot;The Hole&quot;, &quot;Eggs&quot;, &quot;Voyage to the Next&quot;, and &quot;Urbanissimo&quot; tackle industrialization, war, overpopulation, and the environment, all subjects the Hubleys were highly concerned with. Hubley, himself an avid reader of psychology books, also looked to explore complex psychological theories in his films, as he believed animation to be the perfect medium to visualize such intricate ideas. Fittingly, the Hubleys taught a class at Yale called &quot;The Visualization of Abstract Themes&quot;. Hubley was also fascinated with the way children discussed life and their own experiences, which can be seen in &quot;Moonbird&quot;, &quot;Windy Day&quot;, and &quot;Cockaboody&quot;.

==Death, preservation and legacy==

During the production of &quot;A Doonesbury Special&quot;, Hubley went to the Yale New Haven Medical Center for what was thought to be a standard heart procedure. Hubley died during the surgery on February 21, 1977, at the age of 62. &quot;A Doonesbury Special&quot; was completed by his wife and Garry Trudeau, earning John Hubley a posthumous Academy Award nomination and Palme d&#x27;Or win. Hubley was cremated, and his ashes were spread over the Atlantic Ocean.

During his life and after his death, retrospectives and screenings of Hubley&#x27;s films have been held all over the world. The Museum of Modern Art held a major two-part exhibition on the Hubleys&#x27; films and artwork in 1997 and 1998, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences held a salute to Hubley in 2011. Mr. Magoo, a character co-created by Hubley, would become one of the most famous cartoon characters of all time, ranking #29 on TV Guide&#x27;s &quot;50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time&quot; list in 2002. Hubley is often cited as one of the most influential figures in the history of animation, influencing artists such as Michael Sporn, Gene Deitch, and his own daughter, Emily Hubley. On October 2, 2022, Garry Trudeau&#x27;s &quot;Doonesbury&quot; ran a strip encouraging readers to watch Hubley&#x27;s &quot;Windy Day&quot;.

Eight of Hubley&#x27;s films (&quot;Moonbird&quot;, &quot;The Hole&quot;, &quot;A Herb Alpert &amp; The Tijuana Brass Double Feature&quot;, &quot;Windy Day&quot;, &quot;Of Men and Demons&quot;, &quot;Voyage to the Next&quot;, &quot;A Doonesbury Special&quot;, and &quot;A Smattering of Spots&quot; - a reel of Storyboard, Inc. commercials) are preserved in the Academy Film Archive. Papers from Hubley&#x27;s life are held at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Harvard University Library, the Yale University Library, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In 2013, &quot;The Hole&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. Artwork from &quot;Moonbird&quot;, &quot;Windy Day&quot;, &quot;Cockaboody&quot;, and several other of the Hubleys&#x27; films are on display at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles.

In 2021, a crowdfunded campaign headed by the Animation Education Association to have a Wisconsin State Historical Marker for Hubley placed in Marinette, Wisconsin, reached its goal. The marker was unveiled on May 20, 2023. To coincide with the unveiling, May 20, 2023, was proclaimed &quot;John and Faith Hubley Day&quot; in Wisconsin by Marinette&#x27;s mayor Steve Genisot.

<text>90Y-DOTA-biotin consists of a radioactive substance (yttrium-90) complexed by a chelating agent (DOTA), which in turn is attached to the vitamin biotin via a chemical linker. It is used experimentally in pretargeted radioimmunotherapy. Animal studies have been conducted as well as clinical studies in humans.

In pretargeted radioimmunotherapy, two or three medications are applied in succession. At first, an antibody-drug conjugate is administered, which consists of a monoclonal antibody designed to target the tumour, and a chemical marker which in the case of DOTA-biotin therapy is one of the proteins avidin and streptavidin. After a time of typically one or two days to let the antibody accumulate in the tumour, a clearing agent may be given to eliminate residues of antibody that are still circulating in the bloodstream; this is especially done in humans. After a further waiting time, the radiotherapy (90Y-DOTA-biotin) is administered. Due to the high affinity of biotin to avidin and streptavidin, the radiotherapy accumulates where the antibody is, namely in the tumour, where it delivers its radioactivity.

<text>Burgazada, or Burgaz Adası (Burgaz for short), is the third largest of the Princes&#x27; Islands in the Sea of Marmara, near Istanbul, Turkey. It is officially a neighbourhood in the municipality and district of Adalar, Istanbul Province, Turkey. Its population is 1,655 (2022). In the past, it was called Antigoni () after Antigonus I Monophthalmus, the father of Demetrius I of Macedon, one of the Diadochi (Successors) of Alexander the Great, who built a fort (Greek: &quot;Pyrgos&quot; for fort/tower) here. The name Burgas is thought to be derived from Pyrgos.

The island covers an area of 1.5 mi² and is dominated by a single hill, Bayraktepe (Flag Hill, 170m/558 ft), also known as Hristos Tepesi (Christ Hill). In 2003, a terrible fire decimated most of its woodland. Visible just offshore is tiny uninhabited Kaşıkadası (Spoon Island). There are great views back towards the mainland from the remote Kalpazankaya (&quot;Counterfeiter&#x27;s Rock&quot; in Turkish).

Historically, the island was mainly inhabited by Greeks and in the 20th century many Jews from Istanbul settled here. However, with the dwindling of Turkey&#x27;s minorities, the make-up of the local population is now virtually indistinguishable from the rest of Istanbul.

Şehir Hatları ferries connect the island with the mainland from terminals at Eminönü and Kabataş on the European side of Istanbul and from Kadıköy and Bostancı on the Asian side. Most of the ferries call at Burgaz after Kınalıada and before Heybeliada and Büyükada.

== Attractions ==
The island was home to short-story writer Sait Faik Abasıyanık whose house, originally called Spanudis Mansion, is sometimes open to visitors. Many of Sait Faik&#x27;s stories are set on Burgazada.

The Church of Iohannes Prodromos (John the Baptist), built in 1899, dominates the small town on the island. It was extensively restored after the Marmara Earthquake of 1999. The site was originally occupied by a Byzantine church which became a prison for St Methodius the Confessor, who was exiled here for his opposition to iconoclasm but eventually went on to become the Greek patriarch.

The Monastery of Hagios Georgios Garipi was largely built in 1897 and had to be extensively restored after the 1999 Marmara Earthquake. In 1917 it served as a refuge for some of the White Russians fleeing the Russian Revolution. There has been a monastery on the site since at least the 17th century.

On the top of Bayraktepe stands the Monastery of the Transfiguration, dating back to Byzantine time and standing on the site of an Ancient Greek temple. The current building is mainly a work of the 19th century.

The Burgazada Sanitorium, founded in 1928, is one of the oldest sanitoria in the country. The site has been unoccupied for quite a time and recently been transformed to a restaurant.

<text>Membrane alanyl aminopeptidase () also known as alanyl aminopeptidase (AAP) or aminopeptidase N (AP-N) is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the ANPEP gene.

== Function ==

Aminopeptidase N is located in the small-intestinal and renal microvillar membrane, and also in other plasma membranes. In the small intestine aminopeptidase N plays a role in the final digestion of peptides generated from hydrolysis of proteins by gastric and pancreatic proteases. Its function in proximal tubular epithelial cells and other cell types is less clear. The large extracellular carboxyterminal domain contains a pentapeptide consensus sequence characteristic of members of the zinc-binding metalloproteinase superfamily. Sequence comparisons with known enzymes of this class showed that CD13 and aminopeptidase N are identical. The latter enzyme was thought to be involved in the metabolism of regulatory peptides by diverse cell types, including small intestinal and renal tubular epithelial cells, macrophages, granulocytes, and synaptic membranes from the CNS. Defects in this gene appear to be a cause of various types of leukemia or lymphoma.

AAP is also used by some viruses as a receptor to which these viruses bind to and then enter cells. It is a receptor for human coronavirus 229E, feline coronavirus serotype II (FCoV-II), TGEV, PEDV, canine coronavirus genotype II (CCoV-II) as well as several Deltacoronaviruses.

<doc id="1300769" wikidata="Q25245116" url="?curid=1300769" title="Tender offer">
<text>In corporate finance, a tender offer is a type of public takeover bid. The tender offer is a public, open offer or invitation (usually announced in a newspaper advertisement) by a prospective acquirer to all stockholders of a publicly traded corporation (the target corporation) to tender their stock for sale at a specified price during a specified time, subject to the tendering of a minimum and maximum number of shares. In a tender offer, the bidder contacts shareholders directly; the directors of the company may or may not have endorsed the tender offer proposal.

To induce the shareholders of the target company to sell, the acquirer&#x27;s offer price is usually at a premium over the current market price of the target company&#x27;s shares. For example, if a target corporation&#x27;s stock was trading at $10 per share, an acquirer might offer $11.50 per share to shareholders on the condition that 51% of shareholders agree. Cash or securities may be offered to the target company&#x27;s shareholders, although a tender offer in which securities are offered as consideration is generally referred to as an &quot;exchange offer&quot;.

==Governing law==
===United States===
====General====
In the United States, tender offers are regulated by the Williams Act. SEC Regulation 14E also governs tender offers. It covers such matters as:
#the minimum length of time a tender offer must remain open
#procedures for modifying a tender offer after it has been issued
#insider trading in the context of tender offers
#whether one class of shareholders can receive preferential treatment over another

====Required disclosures====
In the United States, under the Williams Act, codified in Section 13(d) and Section 14(d)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a bidder must file Schedule TO with the SEC upon commencement of the tender offer. Among the matters required to be disclosed in schedule TO are: (i) a term sheet which summarizes the material terms of the tender offer in plain English; (ii) the bidder&#x27;s identity and background; and (iii) the bidder&#x27;s history with the target company. In addition, a potential acquirer must file Schedule 13D within 10 days of acquiring more than 5% of the shares of another company.

=====Tax consequence=====
The consummation of a tender offer resulting in payment to the shareholder is a taxable event triggering capital gains or losses, which may be long-term or short-term depending on the shareholder&#x27;s holding period.

<text>Physics often deals with classical models where the dynamical variables are a collection of functions 
{&quot;φ&quot;&quot;α&quot;}&quot;α&quot; over a d-dimensional space/spacetime manifold &quot;M&quot; where &quot;α&quot; is the &quot;flavor&quot; index. This involves functionals over the &quot;φ&quot;&#x27;s, functional derivatives, functional integrals, etc. From a functional point of view this is equivalent to working with an infinite-dimensional smooth manifold where its points are an assignment of a function for each &quot;α&quot;, and the procedure is in analogy with differential geometry where the coordinates for a point &quot;x&quot; of the manifold &quot;M&quot; are &quot;φ&quot;&quot;α&quot;(&quot;x&quot;).

In the DeWitt notation (named after theoretical physicist Bryce DeWitt), φ&quot;α&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is written as φ&quot;i&quot; where &quot;i&quot; is now understood as an index covering both &quot;α&quot; and &quot;x&quot;.

So, given a smooth functional &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;,&quot;i&quot; stands for the functional derivative

:formula_1

as a functional of &quot;φ&quot;. In other words, a &quot;1-form&quot; field over the infinite dimensional &quot;functional manifold&quot;.

In integrals, the Einstein summation convention is used. Alternatively,

<doc id="1300787" wikidata="Q1131546" url="?curid=1300787" title="Óscar Elías Biscet">
<text>Óscar Elías Biscet González (born July 20, 1961 in Havana, Cuba) is a Cuban physician and an advocate for human rights and democratic freedoms in Cuba. He is also the founder of the Lawton Foundation.

Biscet was given a 25-year prison sentence in Cuba for allegedly committing crimes against the sovereignty and the integrity of the Cuban territory. Despite appeals from the United Nations, foreign governments, and international human rights organizations, the Cuban Government refused to release Biscet until March 11, 2011. In recognition of his &quot;advocacy efforts for human rights and democracy&quot; in Cuba. In 2007 Biscet was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by U.S. President George W. Bush.

==Beginnings==
Biscet received a degree in medicine in 1985; the following year he initiated protests which led to his immediate suspension. Starting in 1988, Biscet revealed his political tension with the communist regime through speech. The Cuban government in 1994 officially opened a case file on Biscet, labeling him a counter-revolutionary and &quot;dangerous&quot;. In 1997, Biscet founded the Lawton Foundation.

==Political and philosophical background==
Henry David Thoreau, Mohandas Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr. are major influences in Biscet&#x27;s writing and motivation. Others from whom Biscet has taken inspiration are Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, José Martí, and Frederick Douglass. He is a strong believer in a democratic government and proved perseverance in criticizing abortion and the suppression of civil liberties.

==Expulsion from the National Health Service==
Biscet was expelled from the Cuban National Health System in February 1998 because of his activism. The physician&#x27;s wife, Elsa Morejón was also expelled from nursing (her profession) when her husband started to oppose a widespread use of Rivanol for abortions.

==1999 arrest==
In August 1999, Biscet, along with two dozen other dissidents, were detained by Cuban police for organizing meetings in Havana and Matanzas. He was released five days earlier on August 17, 1999. He claimed that while in custody, the police tortured him by beating, kicking, stripping, and burning him. The government then threatened to detain him longer if he continued promoting his counterrevolutionary activities in Cuba. Later in 1999, he was sent back in prison for a three-year sentence. Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience and called for his immediate release. He was released from a high-security prison in the Holguín Province after having served his full sentence.

==2002 arrest==

One month after being released from custody, on December 6, 2002, Biscet was arrested in a private house with 11 other dissidents while discussing a petition drive and human rights. Biscet&#x27;s wife later said the activists &quot;were beaten and violently arrested&quot;. During their removal from the house they shouted &quot;Long live human rights&quot; and &quot;Freedom for political prisoners&quot;.

Biscet was one of the 75 dissidents imprisoned in 2003 by the Cuban authorities for his association with the head of the US Interests Section in Havana, James Cason. He was given a 25-year sentence for &quot;disorderly conduct&quot; and &quot;counter-revolutionary activities&quot;. He was subsequently held at Combinado del Este Prison in Havana, where he was generally not allowed outside visitors, including medical practitioners and clergy, under conditions described as &quot;wretched&quot;. He had previously been imprisoned in the &quot;Cinco Y Medio&quot; prison in Pinar del Río. A replica of his cell while there was displayed at the residence of the chief of mission, James Cason.

In 2003, in response to a petition concerning Biscet and other Cuban prisoners of conscience, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention determined that Biscet is being held in violation of Articles 9, 10, 19, 20, and 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and called for his immediate release.

On September 1, 2005, in response to an Urgent Action Appeal filed by Freedom Now on behalf of Biscet, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the Question of Torture, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Human Rights Defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and Association issued a joint urgent appeal to the Government of the Republic of Cuba calling again for Biscet&#x27;s immediate release.

==Campaign to release==
Freedom Now, a non-profit organization located in Washington, D.C., was retained in 2005 to assist in obtaining Biscet&#x27;s release from prison. On September 1, 2005, in response to an Urgent Action Appeal filed by Freedom Now on Biscet&#x27;s behalf, the United Nations called on the Government of the Republic of Cuba to immediately release Biscet.

Nat Hentoff was one of the chief advocates for Biscet in the United States, penning numerous pleas in his syndicated and &quot;Village Voice&quot; column calling for his release, and highlighting his plight within the Cuban criminal justice system.

===Release===

On March 11, 2011, it was announced that Biscet had been freed, along with more than 50 other dissidents. The Catholic Church in Cuba was responsible for negotiating their release. Biscet said shortly after being freed that he planned to remain in Cuba and continue his advocacy for human rights.

In August 2012, he began an independent television show, &quot;Revelando Cuba&quot; (&quot;Revealing Cuba&quot;), on which he discussed national and international events. The program is produced and distributed by the Lawton Foundation.

== International support ==
In 2007, Biscet received &quot;in absentia&quot; the Presidential Medal of Freedom, from US President George W. Bush, but the Cuban government denied him a permit to travel to receive it. Finally nine years later, on June 23, 2016, he received it from Mr. George W Bush in a private ceremony in Dallas, Texas. In 2007 Biscet received in absentia the Dr. Rainer Hildebrandt Human Rights Award endowed by Alexandra Hildebrandt. The award is given annually in recognition of extraordinary, non-violent commitment to human rights.

<doc id="1300800" wikidata="Q1019402" url="?curid=1300800" title="Winkler, Manitoba">
<text>Winkler is a city in Manitoba, Canada with a population of 13,745 (census agglomeration 32,655), making it the 4th largest city in Manitoba, as of the 2021 Canadian census. It is located in southern Manitoba, surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Stanley, about one hundred kilometres southwest of Winnipeg and east of its &quot;twin city&quot; Morden. As the largest city in the Pembina Valley, it serves as a regional hub for commerce, agriculture and industry. Winkler is the third-fastest growing city in the province after Morden and Steinbach.

== History ==
===Pre-European settlement===
The land in southeast Manitoba upon which Winkler sits, was the traditional lands of the nomadic Ojibwe-speaking Anishinaabe people. They used their lands for hunting, fishing, and trapping. The Anishinaabe knew no borders at the time and their land ranged both north and south of the Canada–United States border, and both east and west of the Red River. On 3 August 1871 the Anishinaabe signed Treaty 1 and moved onto reserves.

===Early history===
European settlement in the Winkler area history dates back to 1876 when Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites began settling in the area known as the West Reserve, which had been set aside exclusively for the Russian Mennonites. The West Reserve as established two years after an earlier Mennonite Reserve called the East Reserve was founded east of the Red River. Many of Winkler-area&#x27;s first settlers moved from the East Reserve. The first official Mennonite Brethren congregation was founded in Burwalde, near Winkler in 1888.

In 1892, Valentine Winkler, a lumber entrepreneur and politician who owned and operated his own lumber business in nearby Morden founded the village of Winkler. Because Winkler&#x27;s many customers from the Mennonite settlement wanted him to build a market in their vicinity, he persuaded the Canadian Pacific Railway to build a spur route on the northeastern edge of the settlement where Winkler had been established.

===Incorporation as a village===
Winkler was incorporated as a village on May 9, 1906. By that time, the flourishing village had become home to a number of German, Jewish and English merchants. The Mennonites began moving into the village soon after and by World War I, they outnumbered all other groups.

Winkler experienced significant floods in 1916, 1917, 1933 and 1966. On Tuesday, March 22, 1966, several merchants in Winkler closed down their shops for the day when they found the street flooded and water up to their doorsteps. Most of the business section was covered with two feet of water. Shopkeepers sandbagged their store front entrances while homeowners had flooded basements. A spokesman for the Emergency Measures Organization, said that about two-thirds of the town was under water. A tornado and accompanying cloudburst passed a mile west of Winkler on May 23,
1933, resulting in the worst flooding that locals could recall. The twister struck late in the afternoon, and on May 24, the whole town was flooded.

===Incorporation as a town===
During the early 1900s, a large number of Jewish and German merchants emigrated from Winkler, causing a decline in population. However, the village&#x27;s population increased after World War II, and on April 7, 1954, Winkler was incorporated as a town.

In 1985, the Habitat for Humanity movement spread to Canada with the first Canadian build in Winkler.

===Winkler becomes a city===

Following a halt in growth during the 1960s, the town&#x27;s rapid growth in population resumed and continued into the 1990s. On April 7, 2002, Winkler was officially granted city status. The city celebrated its centennial anniversary in the summer of 2006.

==Geography and climate==

Located on the western edge of the Red River Valley, Winkler is located at the corner of provincial highways 14 and 32.

Winkler is situated on the prehistoric beaches of Lake Agassiz. The lake&#x27;s shores were formed over 10,000 years ago by the Pembina Escarpment, located a few kilometres west of Winkler.

<text>An [[abdomen|abdomino]] [[Perineum|perineal]] [[Segmental resection|resection]], formally known as abdominoperineal resection of the rectum and abdominoperineal excision of the [[rectum]] is a surgery for rectal cancer or anal cancer. It is frequently abbreviated as AP resection, APR and APER.

==Indication and description==
See image on National Cancer Institute website
The principal indication for AP resection is a rectal carcinoma situated in the distal (lower) one-third of the rectum. Other indications include recurrent or residual anal carcinoma (squamous cell carcinoma) following initial, usually definitive combination chemoradiotherapy.

APRs involves removal of the anus, the rectum and part of the sigmoid colon along with the associated (regional) lymph nodes, through incisions made in the abdomen and perineum. The end of the remaining sigmoid colon is brought out permanently as an opening, called a stoma, which is used by the patient in conjunction with a colostomy pouch, on the surface of the abdomen.

==Centralisation of rectal surgery==
This operation is one of the less commonly performed by general surgeons, although they are specifically trained to perform this operation. As low case volumes in rectal surgery have been found to be associated with higher complication rates, it is often centralised in larger centres, where case volumes are higher.

==Laparoscopic approach==
There are several advantages in terms of outcomes if the surgery can be performed laparoscopically

==Relation to low anterior resection (LAR)==
An APR, generally, results in a worse quality of life than the less invasive lower anterior resection (LAR). Thus, LARs are generally the preferred treatment for rectal cancer insofar as this is surgically feasible.

==History==
William Ernest Miles (1869–1947), an English surgeon first performed the surgery of removing the rectum in 1907. He assumed that the rectal cancer can spread in both upwards and downward directions, thus necessitating the removal of the entire rectum together with the anal sphincters, resulting in a permanent stoma by connecting the proximal end of the descending colon to the skin. Mile&#x27;s operation became the gold standard for treating rectal cancer because his technique successfully reduced the rate of cancer recurrence. 

To reduce the incidence of death and suffering of the patients associated with the APR procedure, Henri Albert Hartmann introduced the anterior resection of the rectum by preserving the distal rectum and anal sphincters, while producing end-sigmoid colostomy. There were attempts to restore bowel continuity by joining the proximal colon with the rectum, but the high incidence of leakage from the anastomotic site caused an increased risk of death to patients. It was only in 1948, Claude Dixon successfully connected the proximal bowel to the rectum, thus allowing patients to have a 64% 5-year survival rate.

<text>The Nanaimo bar ( ) is a bar dessert that requires no baking and is named after the Canadian city of Nanaimo in British Columbia. It consists of three layers: a wafer, nut (walnuts, almonds, or pecans), and coconut crumb base; custard icing in the middle; and a layer of chocolate ganache on top. Many varieties exist, consisting of various types of crumb, various flavours of icing (such as peanut butter or coconut, mocha), and various types of chocolate.

== Origins ==
The earliest confirmed printed copy of the recipe using the name &quot;Nanaimo bars&quot; appears in the Edith Adams&#x27; prize cookbook (14th edition) from 1953. Following research into the origins of Nanaimo bars, Lenore Newman writes that the same recipe was published in the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; earlier that same year under the name &quot;London Fog Bar&quot;. The recipe later also appears in the publication &quot;His/Her Favourite Recipes&quot;, Compiled by the Women&#x27;s Association of the Brechin United Church (1957), with the recipe submitted by Joy Wilgress, a Baltimore, Maryland, native. (Brechin United Church is in Nanaimo.)

In 1954, the recipe &quot;Mabel&#x27;s Squares&quot; was published in &quot;The Country Woman&#x27;s Favourite&quot; by the Upper Gloucester Women&#x27;s Institute (New Brunswick). The recipe was submitted by Mrs. Harold Payne, the daughter of Mabel (Knowles) Scott (1883–1957).

The first printing of recipes featuring Nanaimo bar ingredients is found in the 1952 &quot;Women&#x27;s Auxiliary to the Nanaimo Hospital Cookbook&quot;, which features three nearly identical recipes that differ only slightly from the modern Nanaimo bar. They are referred to as the &quot;chocolate square&quot; or the &quot;chocolate slice&quot;.

Other unconfirmed references date the bar back to the 1930s, when it was said to be known locally as &quot;chocolate fridge cake&quot;. One modern reference mentions the bars&#x27; existence in 19th century Nanaimo.

== Popularity ==

The popularity of the bar in Nanaimo led local residents to mobilise to have it voted &quot;Canada&#x27;s Favourite Confection&quot; in a &quot;National Post&quot; reader survey. In 1985, Mayor Graeme Roberts initiated a contest to find the ultimate Nanaimo bar recipe. The recipe submitted by Joyce Hardcastle, a resident of Nanaimo, was unanimously selected by a panel of judges. The Nanaimo bar was popularized nationwide after being highlighted as a classic Canadian dessert at Expo 86.
Recipes for similar desserts are found in various places, under various names, in North America and Europe. The designation &quot;Nanaimo bar&quot; is Canadian, and appears in the &quot;Canadian Oxford Dictionary&quot;, but not in other language or dialect versions.

An episode from the first season of the competition television show &quot;MasterChef Canada&quot; features an elimination challenge where competitors made desserts inspired by Nanaimo bars, chosen among three Canadian desserts.

A 2016 US state dinner in honour of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau featured Nanaimo bars as the main dessert. The elaborate dinner, hosted by then-US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle Obama, consisted of a blend of American and Canadian dishes. The Nanaimo bars were presented on a plate inspired by the Rocky Mountains.

In April 2019, Canada Post announced the release of a booklet of postage stamps dedicated to Canadian desserts and sweets. The booklet of 10 stamps features images of the Nanaimo bar, the butter tart, &quot;tarte au sucre&quot; (sugar pie), blueberry grunt, and Saskatoon berry pie. Canada Post described the stamps as &quot;fun-shaped&quot;, and the booklet of stamps resembled a recipe card. The image of the Nanaimo bar on the stamp received some criticism for its ratio of &quot;the crumbly base, the custard filling, and the chocolate ganache icing.&quot;

<text>The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) is the regulatory body for veterinary surgeons in the United Kingdom, established in 1844 by royal charter. It is responsible for monitoring the educational, ethical and clinical standards of the veterinary profession. Anyone wishing to practice as a vet in the United Kingdom must be registered with the RCVS.

==Role==
*To safeguard the health and welfare of animals committed to veterinary care through the regulation of the educational, ethical and clinical standards of the veterinary profession, thereby protecting the interests of those dependent on animals and assuring public health.
*To act as an impartial source of informed opinion on animal health and welfare issues and their interaction with human health.

Anyone who wishes to practice as a vet in the United Kingdom must first register with the RCVS. Eligibility for registration is based either on having a recognised qualification or by passing the RCVS statutory membership examination. After registration, the vet is entitled to use the letters MRCVS (Member of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons) or FRCVS (Fellow of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons) after their name.

During the ceremony of admission to the RCVS, members make a declaration:

==The Royal Charter==
The 1844 charter regulates particular aspects of the college&#x27;s management of its affairs and gives it the power to award fellowships, diplomas and certificates to veterinary surgeons, veterinary nurses, and others engaged in veterinary science and its auxiliary sciences.

The statutory duties of the RCVS are laid out in the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966.

==RCVS Practice Standards Scheme==
The regulatory role of the RCVS has always meant that members of the public could rest assured that their individual vet is properly qualified and fit to practise, and now the same assurance can apply to practice premises. The RCVS Practice Standards Scheme is a voluntary initiative to accredit veterinary practices in the UK. Through setting standards and carrying out regular inspections, the Scheme aims to promote and maintain the highest standards of veterinary care.

RCVS Accredited practices are able to display the RCVS accredited practice logo, which indicates that the practice has undergone a rigorous, independent inspection and various minimum standards have been met.

== The Disciplinary Committee of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons ==
The Disciplinary Committee of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons hears charges against veterinary surgeons accused of serious professional misconduct or being unfit to practice because of a criminal conviction.

Appeals from decisions of the Disciplinary Committee are heard by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

==Officials==
In order to carry out its statutory duties a council of 33 members governs the RCVS and meets eight times a year. The President, vice-presidents (two), and Treasurer are elected by Council and together with the Chief Executive and Head of Legal Services/Registrar, form a team of officers who have the main responsibility for running the RCVS.

*President: Melissa Donald
*Vice President: Kate Richards 
*Vice President: Sue Patterson
*Treasurer: Prof Susan Dawson 
*Chief Executive: Lizzie Lockett
*Registrar: Eleanor Ferguson

<doc id="1300834" wikidata="Q341500" url="?curid=1300834" title="Acitretin">
<text>Acitretin, sold under the brand names Neotigason and Soriatane, is a second-generation retinoid. It is taken orally, and is typically used for psoriasis.

Acitretin is an oral retinoid used in the treatment of severe resistant psoriasis. Because of the potential for problems and severe side effects it is generally used in only very severe cases of psoriasis that have been unresponsive to other treatments. It binds to nuclear receptors that regulates gene transcription. They induce keratinocyte differentiation and reduce epidermal hyperplasia, leading to the slowing of cell reproduction. Acitretin is readily absorbed and widely distributed after oral administration. A therapeutic effect occurs after two to four weeks or longer.

Patients who have received the medication are advised against giving blood for at least three years due to the risk of birth defects.
==Adverse effects==
Acitretin is highly teratogenic and noted for the possibility of severe birth defects. It should not be used by pregnant women or women planning to get pregnant within 3 years following the use of acitretin. Sexually active women of childbearing age who use acitretin should also use at least two forms of birth control concurrently. Men and women who use it should not donate blood for three years after using it, because of the possibility that the blood might be used in a pregnant patient and cause birth defects. In addition, it may cause nausea, headache, itching, dry, red or flaky skin, dry or red eyes, dry or chapped lips, swollen lips, dry mouth, thirst, cystic acne or hair loss.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Acitretin is a metabolite of etretinate, which was used prior to the introduction of acitretin. Etretinate was discontinued because it had a narrow therapeutic index as well as a long elimination half-life (&quot;t&quot;1/2 = 120 days), making dosing difficult. In contrast, acitretin&#x27;s half-life is approximately 2 days. However, because acitretin can be reverse metabolised into etretinate which has an extremely long half-life, women must avoid becoming pregnant for at least three years after discontinuing acitretin. Therefore, acitretin is generally not recommended for women of child-bearing age with a risk of becoming pregnant.

<doc id="1300870" wikidata="Q3445010" url="?curid=1300870" title="Carson–Newman University">
<text>Carson-Newman University is a private university in Jefferson City, Tennessee, United States. Carson-Newman is affiliated with the Tennessee Baptist Mission Board. Founded in 1851, the university enrolls about 2,500 students. Studies are offered in approximately 90 different academic programs.

==History==

Following a ten-year effort of five early East Tennessee Baptists, the school was established and chartered with the state of Tennessee as Mossy Creek Missionary Baptist Seminary in 1851, and construction began that summer on the first building on the west bank of the creek. While this was ongoing, the school held classes in a local Baptist church located near the old zinc mine on the current Allen and Phyllis Morgan East Campus. Within a year the school occupied its own building between the current Silver Diamond Baseball Complex and the East Campus. The campus gradually grew to the west, and is now a mile wide stretching across the northern end of Jefferson City. 

In 1880, the institution was named Carson College for James Harvey Carson, who left $15,000 of his estate to the school. For several years it existed alongside Newman College, a separate facility for the education of women named for William Cate Newman, who had donated money to the women&#x27;s college. In 1889, the two colleges united as one of the first coeducational institutions in the South. The institution operated as Carson-Newman College until 2012 when the board of trustees voted to acknowledge recent organizational changes by changing the name to Carson-Newman University.

In 1919, Carson-Newman became officially affiliated with the Tennessee Baptist Convention. The college was admitted to membership in the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1927 and the Association of American Colleges in 1928.

During World War II, Carson-Newman was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

In 2015 the school applied for and received a Title IX exemption so that it could maintain its status as a private Christian institution and also granting it the right to turn away &quot;gay students, unwed mothers, women who&#x27;ve had an abortion and even students who may be pregnant&quot; should it so choose to do so. Then-President Randall O&#x27;Brien stated that the decision was made based on the advice of legal counsel and that the school does not discriminate and does not plan to.

Through an alumni donation in 2007, the university acquired an overgrown wooded area of land along Mossy Creek, known as a dead creek. The property was turned into a park called Allen and Phyllis Morgan East Campus. In Fall 2017, the creek started showing fresh signs of life once again. In 2019, the university completed construction on a 250-seat open air amphitheater on the East Campus.

On June 7, 2019, the trustees appointed Charles A. Fowler as the 23rd president of the university. Fowler began his tenure July 1, 2019.

<doc id="1300874" wikidata="Q422225" url="?curid=1300874" title="Actinic keratosis">
<text>Actinic keratosis (AK), sometimes called solar keratosis or senile keratosis, is a pre-cancerous area of thick, scaly, or crusty skin. Actinic keratosis is a disorder (&quot;&quot;) of epidermal keratinocytes that is induced by ultraviolet (UV) light exposure (&quot;&quot;). 

These growths are more common in fair-skinned people and those who are frequently in the sun. They are believed to form when skin gets damaged by UV radiation from the sun or indoor tanning beds, usually over the course of decades. Given their pre-cancerous nature, if left untreated, they may turn into a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma. Untreated lesions have up to a 20% risk of progression to squamous cell carcinoma, so treatment by a dermatologist is recommended.

Actinic keratoses characteristically appear as thick, scaly, or crusty areas that often feel dry or rough. Size commonly ranges between 2 and 6 millimeters, but they can grow to be several centimeters in diameter. AKs are often felt before they are seen, and the texture is sometimes compared to sandpaper. They may be dark, light, tan, pink, red, a combination of all these, or have the same color as the surrounding skin.

Given the causal relationship between sun exposure and AK growth, they often appear on a background of sun-damaged skin and in areas that are commonly sun-exposed, such as the face, ears, neck, scalp, chest, backs of hands, forearms, or lips. Because sun exposure is rarely limited to a small area, most people who have an AK have more than one.

If clinical examination findings are not typical of AK and the possibility of in situ or invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cannot be excluded based on clinical examination alone, a biopsy or excision can be considered for definitive diagnosis by histologic examination of the lesional tissue. Multiple treatment options for AK are available. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is one option for the treatment of numerous AK lesions in a region of the skin, termed field cancerization. It involves the application of a photosensitizer to the skin followed by illumination with a strong light source. Topical creams, such as 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod, may require daily application to affected skin areas over a typical time course of weeks.

Cryotherapy is frequently used for few and well-defined lesions, but undesired skin lightening, or hypopigmentation, may occur at the treatment site. By following up with a dermatologist, AKs can be treated before they progress to skin cancer. If cancer does develop from an AK lesion, it can be caught early with close monitoring, at a time when treatment is likely to have a high cure rate.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Actinic keratoses (AKs) most commonly present as a white, scaly plaque of variable thickness with surrounding redness; they have a sandpaper-like texture when felt with a gloved hand. Skin nearby the lesion often shows evidence of solar damage characterized by pigmentary alterations, being yellow or pale in color with areas of hyperpigmentation; deep wrinkles, coarse texture, purpura and ecchymoses, dry skin, and scattered telangiectasias are also characteristic.

Photoaging leads to an accumulation of oncogenic changes, resulting in a proliferation of mutated keratinocytes that can manifest as AKs or other neoplastic growths. With years of sun damage, it is possible to develop multiple AKs in a single area on the skin. This condition is termed field cancerization.

The lesions are usually asymptomatic, but can be tender, itch, bleed, or produce a stinging or burning sensation. AKs are typically graded in accordance with their clinical presentation: Grade I (easily visible, slightly palpable), Grade II (easily visible, palpable), and Grade III (frankly visible and hyperkeratotic).

=== Variants ===

Actinic keratoses can have various clinical presentations, often characterized as follows:

*Classic (or common): Classic AKs present as white, scaly macules, papules or plaques of various thickness, often with surrounding erythema. They are usually 2–6mm in diameter but can sometimes reach several centimeters in diameter.
*Hypertrophic (or hyperkeratotic): Hypertrophic AKs (HAKs) appears as a thicker scale or rough papule or plaque, often adherent to an erythematous base. Classic AKs can progress to become HAKs, and HAKs themselves can be difficult to distinguish from malignant lesions.
*Atrophic: Atrophic AKs lack an overlying scale, and therefore appear as a nonpalpable change in color (or macule). They are often smooth and red and are less than 10mm in diameter.
*AK with cutaneous horn: A cutaneous horn is a keratinic projection with its height at least one-half of its diameter, often conical in shape. They can be seen in the setting of actinic keratosis as a progression of an HAK, but are also present in other skin conditions. 38–40% of cutaneous horns represent AKs.
*Pigmented AK: Pigmented AKs are rare variants that often present as macules or plaques that are tan to brown in color. They can be difficult to distinguish from a solar lentigo or lentigo maligna.
*Actinic cheilitis: When an AK forms on the lip, it is called actinic cheilitis. This usually presents as a rough, scaly patch on the lip, often accompanied by the sensation of dry mouth and symptomatic splitting of the lips.
*Bowenoid AK: Usually presents as a solitary, erythematous, scaly patch or plaque with well-defined borders. Bowenoid AKs are differentiated from Bowen&#x27;s disease by degree of epithelial involvement as seen on histology.

The presence of ulceration, nodularity, or bleeding should raise concern for malignancy. Specifically, clinical findings suggesting an increased risk of progression to squamous cell carcinoma can be recognized as &quot;IDRBEU&quot;: I (induration/inflammation), D (diameter &gt; 1 cm), R (rapid enlargement), B (bleeding), E (erythema), and U (ulceration). AKs are usually diagnosed clinically, but because they are difficult to clinically differentiate from squamous cell carcinoma, any concerning features warrant biopsy for diagnostic confirmation.

== Causes ==
The most important cause of AK formation is solar radiation, through a variety of mechanisms. Mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, induced by UV radiation, has been identified as a crucial step in AK formation. This tumor suppressor gene, located on chromosome 17p132, allows for cell cycle arrest when DNA or RNA is damaged. Dysregulation of the p53 pathway can thus result in unchecked replication of dysplastic keratinocytes, thereby serving as a source of neoplastic growth and the development of AK, as well as possible progression from AK to skin cancer. Other molecular markers that have been associated with the development of AK include the expression of p16ink4, p14, the CD95 ligand, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and TRAIL receptors, and loss of heterozygosity.

Evidence also suggests that the human papillomavirus (HPV) plays a role in the development of AKs. The HPV virus has been detected in AKs, with measurable HPV viral loads (one HPV-DNA copy per less than 50 cells) measured in 40% of AKs. Similar to UV radiation, higher levels of HPV found in AKs reflect enhanced viral DNA replication. This is suspected to be related to the abnormal keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation in AKs, which facilitate an environment for HPV replication. This in turn may further stimulate the abnormal proliferation that contributes to the development of AKs and carcinogenesis.

=== Ultraviolet radiation ===
It is thought that ultraviolet (UV) radiation induces mutations in the keratinocytes of the epidermis, promoting the survival and proliferation of these atypical cells. Both UV-A and UV-B radiation have been implicated as causes of AKs. UV-A radiation (wavelength 320–400 nm) reaches more deeply into the skin and can lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species, which in turn can damage cell membranes, signaling proteins, and nucleic acids. UV-B radiation (wavelength 290–320 nm) causes thymidine dimer formation in DNA and RNA, leading to significant cellular mutations. In particular, mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been found in 30–50% of AK lesion skin samples.

UV radiation has also been shown to cause elevated inflammatory markers such as arachidonic acid, as well as other molecules associated with inflammation. Eventually, over time these changes lead to the formation of AKs. Several predictors for increased AK risk from UV radiation have been identified:

* Extent of sun exposure: Cumulative sun exposure leads to an increased risk for development of AKs. In one U.S. study, AKs were found in 55% of fair-skinned men with high cumulative sun exposure, and in only 19% of fair-skinned men with low cumulative sun exposure in an age-matched cohort (the percents for women in this same study were 37% and 12% respectively). Furthermore, the use of sunscreen (SPF 17 or higher) has been found to significantly reduce the development of AK lesions, and also promotes the regression of existing lesions.
* History of sunburn: Studies show that even a single episode of painful sunburn as a child can increase an individual&#x27;s risk of developing AK as an adult. Six or more painful sunburns over the course of a lifetime was found to be significantly associated with the likelihood of developing AK.

=== Skin pigmentation ===

Melanin is a pigment in the epidermis that functions to protect keratinocytes from the damage caused by UV radiation; it is found in higher concentrations in the epidermis of darker-skinned individuals, affording them protection against the development of AKs.

Fair-skinned individuals have a significantly increased risk of developing AKs when compared to olive-skinned individuals (odds ratios of 14.1 and 6.5, respectively), and AKs are uncommon in dark-skinned people of African descent. Other phenotypic features seen in fair-skinned individuals that are associated with an increased propensity to develop AKs include:

*Freckling
* Light hair and eye color
* Propensity to sunburn
* Inability to tan

=== Other risk factors ===

*Immunosuppression: People with a compromised immune system from medical conditions (such as AIDS) or immunosuppressive therapy (such as chronic immunosuppression after organ transplantation, or chemotherapy for cancer) are at increased risk for developing AKs. They may develop AK at an earlier age or have an increased number of AK lesions compared to immunocompetent people.
* Human papillomavirus (HPV): The role of HPV in the development of AK remains unclear, but evidence suggests that infection with the betapapillomavirus type of HPV may be associated with an increased likelihood of AK.
*Genodermatoses: Certain genetic disorders interfere with DNA repair after sun exposure, thereby putting these individuals at higher risk for the development of AKs. Examples of such genetic disorders include xeroderma pigmentosum and Bloom syndrome.
* Balding: AKs are commonly found on the scalps of balding men. The degree of baldness seems to be a risk factor for lesion development, as men with severe baldness were found to be seven times more likely to have 10 or more AKs when compared to men with minimal or no baldness. This observation can be explained by an absence of hair causing a larger proportion of scalp to be exposed to UV radiation if other sun protection measures are not taken.

== Diagnosis ==

Physicians usually diagnose actinic keratosis by doing a thorough physical examination, through a combination of visual observation and touch. However a biopsy may be necessary when the keratosis is large in diameter, thick, or bleeding, in order to make sure that the lesion is not a skin cancer. Actinic keratosis may progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) but both diseases can present similarly upon physical exam and can be difficult to distinguish clinically. 

Histological examination of the lesion from a biopsy or excision may be necessary to definitively distinguish AK from in situ or invasive SCC. In addition to SCCs, AKs can be mistaken for other cutaneous lesions including seborrheic keratoses, basal cell carcinoma, lichenoid keratosis, porokeratosis, viral warts, erosive pustular dermatosis of the scalp, pemphigus foliaceus, inflammatory dermatoses like psoriasis, or melanoma.

=== Biopsy ===
A lesion biopsy is performed if the diagnosis remains uncertain after a clinical physical exam, or if there is suspicion that the AK might have progressed to squamous cell carcinoma. The most common tissue sampling techniques include shave or punch biopsy. When only a portion of the lesion can be removed due to its size or location, the biopsy should sample tissue from the thickest area of the lesion, as SCCs are most likely to be detected in that area.

If a shave biopsy is performed, it should extend through to the level of the dermis in order to provide sufficient tissue for diagnosis; ideally, it would extend to the mid-reticular dermis. Punch biopsy usually extends to the subcutaneous fat when the entire length of the punch blade is utilized.

==== Histopathology ====
On histologic examination, actinic keratoses usually show a collection of atypical keratinocytes with hyperpigmented or pleomorphic nuclei, extending to the basal layer of the epidermis. A &quot;flag sign&quot; is often described, referring to alternating areas of orthokeratosis and parakeratosis. Epidermal thickening and surrounding areas of sun-damaged skin are often seen. The normal ordered maturation of the keratinocytes is disordered to varying degrees: there may be widening of the intracellular spaces, cytologic atypia such as abnormally large nuclei, and a mild chronic inflammatory infiltrate.

Specific findings depend on the clinical variant and particular lesion characteristics. The seven major histopathologic variants are all characterized by atypical keratinocytic proliferation beginning in the basal layer and confined to the epidermis; they include:

*Hypertrophic: Notable for marked hyperkeratosis, often with evident parakeratosis. Keratinocytes in the stratum malphigii may show a loss of polarity, pleomorphism, and anaplasia. Some irregular downward proliferation into the uppermost dermis may be observed, but does not represent frank invasion.
*Atrophic: With slight hyperkeratosis and overall atrophic changes to the epidermis; the basal layer shows cells with large, hyperchromatic nuclei in close proximity to each other. These cells have been observed to proliferate into the dermis as buds and duct-like structures.
*Lichenoid: Demonstrate a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate in the papillary dermis, directly beneath the dermal-epidermal junction.
*Achantholytic: Intercellular clefts or lacunae in the lowermost epidermal layer that result from anaplastic changes; these produce dyskeratotic cells with disrupted intercellular bridges.
*Bowenoid: This term is controversial and usually refers to full-thickness atypia, microscopically indistinguishable from Bowen&#x27;s Disease. However most dermatologists and pathologists will use it in reference to tissue samples that are notable for small foci of atypia that involve the full thickness of the epidermis, in the background of a lesion that is otherwise consistent with an AK.
*Epidermolytic: With granular degeneration.
*Pigmented: Show pigmentation in the basal layer of the epidermis, similar to a solar lentigo.

=== Dermoscopy ===
Dermoscopy is a noninvasive technique utilizing a handheld magnifying device coupled with a transilluminating lift. It is often used in the evaluation of cutaneous lesions but lacks the definitive diagnostic ability of biopsy-based tissue diagnosis. Histopathologic exam remains the gold standard.

Polarized contact dermoscopy of AKs occasionally reveals a &quot;rosette sign,&quot; described as four white points arranged in a clover pattern, often localized to within a follicular opening. It is hypothesized that the &quot;rosette sign&quot; corresponds histologically to the changes of orthokeratosis and parakeratosis known as the &quot;flag sign.&quot;

* Non-pigmented AKs: linear or wavy vascular patterning, or a &quot;strawberry pattern,&quot; described as unfocused vessels between hair follicles, with white-haloed follicular openings.
* Pigmented AKs: gray to brown dots or globules surrounding follicular openings, and annular-granular rhomboidal structures; often difficult to differentiate from lentigo maligna.

== Prevention ==
Ultraviolet radiation is believed to contribute to the development of actinic keratoses by inducing mutations in epidermal keratinocytes, leading to proliferation of atypical cells. Therefore, preventive measures for AKs are targeted at limiting exposure to solar radiation, including:

* Limiting extent of sun exposure
** Avoid sun exposure during noontime hours between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM when UV light is most powerful
** Minimize all time in the sun, since UV exposure occurs even in the winter and on cloudy days
* Using sun protection
** Applying sunscreens with SPF ratings 30 or greater that also block both UVA and UVB light, at least every 2 hours and after swimming or sweating
** Applying sunscreen at least 15 minutes before going outside, as this allows time for the sunscreen to be absorbed appropriately by the skin
** Wearing sun protective clothing such as hats, sunglasses, long-sleeved shirts, long skirts, or trousers. “Consider taking 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day if you always cover up outdoors. This is because you may not get enough vitamin D from sunlight.”

Recent research implicating human papillomavirus (HPV) in the development of AKs suggests that HPV prevention might in turn help prevent development of AKs, as UV-induced mutations and oncogenic transformation are likely facilitated in cases of active HPV infection. A key component of HPV prevention includes vaccination, and the CDC currently recommends routine vaccination in all children at age 11 or 12.

There are some data that in individuals with a history of non-melanoma skin cancer, a low-fat diet can serve as a preventative measure against future actinic keratoses.

== Management ==

There are a variety of treatment options for AK depending on the patient and the clinical characteristics of the lesion. AKs show a wide range of features, which guide decision-making in choosing treatment. As there are multiple effective treatments, patient preference and lifestyle are also factors that physicians consider when determining the management plan for actinic keratosis. Regular follow-up is advisable after any treatment to make sure no new lesions have developed and that old ones are not progressing. Adding topical treatment after a procedure may improve outcomes.

=== Medication ===
Topical medications are often recommended for areas where multiple or ill-defined AKs are present, as the medication can easily be used to treat a relatively large area.

==== Fluorouracil cream ====
Topical fluorouracil (5-FU) destroys AKs by blocking methylation of thymidylate synthetase, thereby interrupting DNA and RNA synthesis. This in turn prevents the proliferation of dysplastic cells in AK. Topical 5-FU is the most utilized treatment for AK, and often results in effective removal of the lesion. Overall, there is a 50% efficacy rate resulting in 100% clearance of AKs treated with topical 5-FU. 5-FU may be up to 90% effective in treating non-hyperkeratotic lesions. While topical 5-FU is a widely used and cost-effective treatment for AKs and is generally well tolerated, its potential side-effects can include: pain, crusting, redness, and local swelling. These adverse effects can be mitigated or minimized by reducing the frequency of application or taking breaks between uses. The most commonly used application regimen consists of applying a layer of topical cream to the lesion twice a day after washing; duration of treatment is typically 2–4 weeks to thinner skin like the cheeks and up to 8 weeks for the arms; treatment of up to 8 weeks has demonstrated a higher cure rate.

==== Imiquimod cream ====
Imiquimod is a topical immune-enhancing agent licensed for the treatment of genital warts. Imiquimod stimulates the immune system through the release and up-regulation of cytokines. Treatment with Imiquimod cream applied 2–3 times per week for 12 to 16 weeks was found to result in complete resolution of AKs in 50% of people, compared to 5% of controls. The Imiquimod 3.75% cream has been validated in a treatment regimen consisting of daily application to entire face and scalp for two 2-week treatment cycles, with a complete clearance rate of 36%.

While the clearance rate observed with the Imiquimod 3.75% cream was lower than that observed with the 5% cream (36 and 50 percent, respectively), there are lower reported rates of adverse reactions with the 3.75% cream: 19% of individuals using Imiquimod 3.75% cream reported adverse reactions including local erythema, scabbing, and flaking at the application site, while nearly a third of individuals using the 5% cream reported the same types of reactions with Imiquimod treatment. However, it is ultimately difficult to compare the efficacy of the different strength creams directly, as current study data varies in methodology (e.g. duration and frequency of treatment, and amount of skin surface area covered).

==== Ingenol mebutate gel ====
Ingenol mebutate is a newer treatment for AK used in Europe and the United States. It works in two ways, first by disrupting cell membranes and mitochondria resulting cell death, and then by inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity to eliminate remaining tumor cells. A 3-day treatment course with the 0.015% gel is recommended for the scalp and face, while a 2-day treatment course with the 0.05% gel is recommended for the trunk and extremities. Treatment with the 0.015% gel was found to completely clear 57% of AK, while the 0.05% gel had a 34% clearance rate. Advantages of ingenol mebutate treatment include the short duration of therapy and a low recurrence rate. Local skin reactions including pain, itching and redness can be expected during treatment with ingenol mebutate. This treatment was derived from the petty spurge, &quot;Euphorbia peplus&quot; which has been used as a traditional remedy for keratosis.

==== Diclofenac sodium gel ====
Topical diclofenac sodium gel is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that is thought to work in the treatment of AK through its inhibition of the arachidonic acid pathway, thereby limiting the production of prostaglandins which are thought to be involved in the development of UVB-induced skin cancers. Recommended duration of therapy is 60 to 90 days with twice daily application. Treatment of facial AK with diclofenac gel led to complete lesion resolution in 40% of cases. Common side effects include dryness, itching, redness, and rash at the site of application.

==== Retinoids ====
Topical retinoids have been studied in the treatment of AK with modest results, and the American Academy of Dermatology does not currently recommend this as first-line therapy. Treatment with adapalene gel daily for 4 weeks, and then twice daily thereafter for a total of nine months led to a significant but modest reduction in the number AKs compared to placebo; it demonstrated the additional advantage of improving the appearance of photodamaged skin.

Topical tretinoin is ineffective as treatment for reducing the number of AKs. For secondary prevention of AK, systemic, low-dose acitretin was found to be safe, well tolerated and moderately effective in chemoprophylaxis for skin cancers in kidney transplant patients. Acitretin is a viable treatment option for organ transplant patients according to expert opinion.

==== Tirbanibulin ====
Tirbanibulin (Klisyri) was approved for medical use in the United States in December 2020, for the treatment of actinic keratosis on the face or scalp.

=== Procedures ===
==== Cryotherapy ====

Liquid nitrogen (−195.8 °C) is the most commonly used destructive therapy for the treatment of AK in the United States. It is a well-tolerated office procedure that does not require anesthesia.

Cryotherapy is particularly indicated for cases where there are fewer than 15 thin, well-demarcated lesions. Caution is encouraged for thicker, more hyperkeratotic lesions, as dysplastic cells may evade treatment. Treatment with both cryotherapy and field treatment can be considered for these more advanced lesions. Cryotherapy is generally performed using an open-spray technique, wherein the AK is sprayed for several seconds.

The process can be repeated multiple times in one office visit, as tolerated. Cure rates from 67 to 99 percent have been reported, depending on freeze time and lesion characteristics. Disadvantages include discomfort during and after the procedure; blistering, scarring and redness; hypo- or hyperpigmentation; and destruction of healthy tissue.

==== Photodynamic therapy ====

AKs are one of the most common dermatologic lesions for which photodynamic therapy, including topical methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) or 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), is indicated.

Treatment begins with preparation of the lesion, which includes scraping away scales and crusts using a dermal curette. A thick layer of topical MAL or 5-ALA cream is applied to the lesion and a small area surrounding the lesion, which is then covered with an occlusive dressing and left for a period of time. During this time the photosensitizer accumulates in the target cells within the AK lesion. The dressings are then removed and the lesion is treated with light at a specified wavelength.

Multiple treatment regimens using different photosensitizers, incubation times, light sources, and pretreatment regimens have been studied and suggest that longer incubation times lead to higher rates of lesion clearance. Photodynamic therapy is gaining in popularity. It has been found to have a 14% higher likelihood of achieving complete lesion clearance at 3 months compared to cryotherapy, and seems to result in superior cosmetic outcomes when compared to cryotherapy or 5-FU treatment. Photodynamic therapy can be particularly effective in treating areas with multiple AK lesions.

==== Surgical techniques ====

*Surgical excision: Excision should be reserved for cases when the AK is a thick, horny papule, or when deeper invasion is suspected and histopathologic diagnosis is necessary. It is a rarely utilized technique for AK treatment.
*Shave excision and curettage (sometimes followed by electrodesiccation when deemed appropriate by the physician): This technique is often used for treatment of AKs, and particularly for lesions appearing more similar to squamous cell carcinoma, or those that are unresponsive to other treatments. The surface of the lesion can be scraped away using a scalpel, or the base can be removed with a curette. Tissue can be evaluated histopathologically under the microscope, but specimens acquired using this technique are not often adequate to determine whether a lesion is invasive or intraepidermal.
*Dermabrasion: Dermabrasion is useful in the treatment of large areas with multiple AK lesions. The process involves using a hand-held instrument to &quot;sand&quot; the skin, removing the stratum corneum layer of the epidermis. Diamond fraises or wire brushes revolving at high speeds are used. The procedure can be quite painful and requires procedural sedation and anesthetic, necessitating a hospital stay. One-year clearance rates with dermabrasion treatment are as high as 96%, but diminish drastically to 54% at five years.

==== Laser therapy ====
Laser therapy using carbon dioxide () or erbium:yttrium aluminum garnet () lasers is a treatment approach being utilized with increased frequency, and sometimes in conjunction with computer scanning technology. Laser therapy has not been extensively studied, but current evidence suggests it may be effective in cases involving multiple AKs refractive to medical therapy, or AKs located in cosmetically sensitive locations such as the face. The laser has been recommended for extensive actinic cheilitis that has not responded to 5-FU.

==== Chemical peels ====
A chemical peel is a topically applied agent that wounds the outermost layer of the skin, promoting organized repair, exfoliation, and eventually the development of smooth and rejuvenated skin. Multiple therapies have been studied. A medium-depth peel may effectively treat multiple non-hyperkeratotic AKs. It can be achieved with 35% to 50% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) alone or at 35% in combination with Jessner&#x27;s solution in a once-daily application for a minimum of 3 weeks; 70% glycolic acid (α-hydroxy acid); or solid . 

When compared to treatment with 5-FU, chemical peels have demonstrated similar efficacy and increased ease of use with similar morbidity. Chemical peels must be performed in a controlled clinic environment and are recommended only for individuals who are able to comply with follow-up precautions, including avoidance of sun exposure. Furthermore, they should be avoided in individuals with a history of HSV infection or keloids, and in those who are immunosuppressed or who are taking photosensitizing medications.

== Prognosis ==

Untreated AKs follow one of three paths: they can either persist as AKs, regress, or progress to invasive skin cancer, as AK lesions are considered to be on the same continuum with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). AK lesions that regress also have the potential to recur.

* Progression: The overall risk of an AK turning into invasive cancer is low. In average-risk individuals, likelihood of an AK lesion progressing to SCC is less than 1% per year. Despite this low rate of progression, studies suggest that a full 60% of SCCs arise from pre-existing AKs, reinforcing the idea that these lesions are closely related.
* Regression: Reported regression rates for single AK lesions have ranged between 15 and 63% after one year.
* Recurrence: Recurrence rates after 1 year for single AK lesions that have regressed range between 15 and 53%.

=== Clinical course ===
Given the aforementioned differering clinical outcomes, it is difficult to predict the clinical course of any given actinic keratosis. AK lesions may also come and go—in a cycle of appearing on the skin, remaining for months, and then disappearing. Often they will reappear in a few weeks or months, particularly after unprotected sun exposure. Left untreated, there is a chance that the lesion will advance to become invasive. Although it is difficult to predict whether an AK will advance to become squamous cell carcinoma, it has been noted that squamous cell carcinomas originate in lesions formerly diagnosed as AKs with frequencies reported between 65 and 97%.

== Epidemiology ==
Actinic keratosis is very common, with an estimated 14% of dermatology visits related to AKs. It is seen more often in fair-skinned individuals, and rates vary with geographical location and age. Other factors such as exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, certain phenotypic features, and immunosuppression can also contribute to the development of AKs.

Men are more likely to develop AK than women, and the risk of developing AK lesions increases with age. These findings have been observed in multiple studies, with numbers from one study suggesting that approximately 5% of women ages 20–29 develop AK compared to 68% of women ages 60–69, and 10% of men ages 20–29 develop AK compared to 79% of men ages 60–69.

Geography seems to play a role in the sense that individuals living in locations where they are exposed to more UV radiation throughout their lifetime have a significantly higher risk of developing AK. Much of the literature on AK comes from Australia, where the prevalence of AK is estimated at 40–50% in adults over 40, as compared to the United States and Europe, where prevalence is estimated at under 11–38% in adults. One study found that those who immigrated to Australia after age 20 had fewer AKs than native Australians in all age groups.

== Research ==
Diagnostically, researchers are investigating the role of novel biomarkers to assist in determining which AKs are more likely to develop into cutaneous or metastatic SCC. Upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) is seen in many different types of cancers, and the expression and production of MMP-7 in particular has been found to be elevated in SCC specifically. The role of serin peptidase inhibitors (Serpins) is also being investigated. SerpinA1 was found to be elevated in the keratinocytes of SCC cell lines, and SerpinA1 upregulation was correlated with SCC tumor progression &quot;in vivo&quot;. Further investigation into specific biomarkers could help providers better assess prognosis and determine best treatment approaches for particular lesions.

In terms of treatment, a number of medications are being studied. Resiquimod is a TLR 7/8 agonist that works similarly to imiquimod, but is 10 to 100 times more potent; when used to treat AK lesions, complete response rates have range from 40 to 74%. Afamelanotide is a drug that induces the production of melanin by melanocytes to act as a protective factor against UVB radiation. It is being studied to determine its efficacy in preventing AKs in organ transplant patients who are on immunosuppressive therapy. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors such as gefitinib, and anti-EGFR antibodies such as cetuximab are used in the treatment of various types of cancers, and are currently being investigated for potential use in the treatment and prevention of AKs.

<doc id="1300883" wikidata="Q5723370" url="?curid=1300883" title="Henry Hub">
<text>The Henry Hub is a distribution hub on the natural gas pipeline system in Erath, Louisiana, owned by Sabine Pipe Line LLC, a subsidiary of EnLink Midstream Partners LP who purchased the asset from Chevron Corporation in 2014. Due to its importance, it lends its name to the pricing point for natural gas futures contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the OTC swaps traded on Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).

It interconnects with nine interstate and four intrastate pipelines: Acadian, Columbia Gulf Transmission, Gulf South Pipeline, Bridgeline, NGPL, Sea Robin, Southern Natural Pipeline, Texas Gas Transmission, Transcontinental Pipeline, Trunkline Pipeline, Jefferson Island, and Sabine. The two compressor stations can compress 520,000 decatherm/d (6.3 GW). The transportation capacity is 1.8 billion ft3/d (bcf) (590 m3/s) (20.4 GW).

Spot and future natural gas prices set at Henry Hub are denominated in US$ per millions of British thermal units and are generally seen to be the primary price set for the North American natural gas market. North American unregulated wellhead prices are closely correlated to those set at Henry Hub.

==History==
The &quot;Henry&quot; hub is so named for its location in the Henry hamlet of Erath, which was named after the Henry High School that stood there until damaged by the flooding and storm surge from Hurricanes Ike (2008) and Rita (2005), though the natural gas facilities suffered minimal damage.

This school was named for its benefactor, William Henry, who originally immigrated from Germany as Ludwig Wilhelm Kattentidt circa 1840, and replaced his surname with Henry, taken from his father&#x27;s middle name &#x27;Heinrich&#x27;. There are Henry descendants in the area to this day. It was customary for benefactors to sponsor schools; there were other similarly sponsored schools in Vermilion Parish around that time.

Henry Hub began operations during the early 1950s when Stone and Webster, Inc. built the original facility with unionized labor for The Texas Company (Texaco). The facility was staffed by the International Union of Operating Engineers. In the 1960s, the Texas Company built and operated an adjoining facility, Sea Robin Plant, without utilizing union labor based on right-to-work laws implemented in Louisiana. By the 2000s, all of the unionized labor were replaced by contract laborers when Texaco and Chevron merged in October 2000.

NYMEX began offering standardized natural gas contracts with delivery at the Henry Hub in April 1990.

In 2011, the Henry Hub was the site of a land dispute, in which Sabine sued to condemn land near the site of their hub, and expropriate it from the Broussard family, who had owned it for generations, arguing that it was acting in the national interest. The lawsuit was settled in 2012, and in 2013 a second, older, lawsuit was settled with Texaco (like Sabine, a Chevron company) for contamination of Broussard land which Texaco had leased for many decades.

<text>A myeloid sarcoma (chloroma, granulocytic sarcoma, extramedullary myeloid tumor) is a solid tumor composed of immature white blood cells called myeloblasts. A chloroma is an extramedullary manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia; in other words, it is a solid collection of leukemic cells occurring outside of the bone marrow.

== Types ==

=== In acute leukemia ===
Chloromas are rare; exact estimates of their prevalence are lacking, but they are uncommonly seen even by physicians specializing in the treatment of leukemia. Chloromas may be somewhat more common in patients with the following disease features:
* French–American–British (FAB) classification class M2
* WHO Classification (2016 revision) is a separate entity under the &quot;Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and related neoplasms&quot;
* those with specific cytogenetic abnormalities (e.g. t(8;21) or inv(16))
* those whose myeloblasts express T-cell surface markers, CD13, or CD14
* those with high peripheral white blood cell counts

However, even in patients with the above risk factors, chloroma remains an uncommon complication of acute myeloid leukemia.

Rarely, a chloroma can develop as the sole manifestation of relapse after apparently successful treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. In keeping with the general behavior of chloromas, such an event must be regarded as an early herald of a systemic relapse, rather than as a localized process. In one review of 24 patients who developed isolated chloromas after treatment for acute myeloid leukemia, the mean interval until bone marrow relapse was 7 months (range, 1 to 19 months).

=== In myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic syndromes ===
Chloromas may occur in patients with a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myeloproliferative syndromes (MPS) (e.g. chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis, or myelofibrosis). The detection of a chloroma is considered &quot;de facto&quot; evidence these premalignant conditions have transformed into an acute leukemia requiring appropriate treatment. For example, presence of a chloroma is sufficient to indicate chronic myelogenous leukemia has entered its &#x27;blast crisis&#x27; phase.

=== In eosinophilic leukemia ===
At least one case of &quot;FIP1L1-PDGFRA&quot; fusion gene-induced eosinophilic leukemia presenting with myeloid sarcoma and eosinophilia has been reported. This form of myeloid sarcoma is distinguished by its highly successful treatment with imatinib (the recommended treatment for &quot;FIP1L1-PDGRGA&quot; fusion gene-induced eosinophilic leukemia) rather than more aggressive and toxic therapy.

=== Primary chloroma ===
Very rarely, chloroma can occur without a known pre-existing or concomitant diagnosis of acute leukemia, acute promyelocytic leukemia or MDS/MPS; this is known as primary chloroma. Diagnosis is particularly challenging in this situation (see below). In almost all reported cases of primary chloroma, acute leukemia has developed shortly afterward (median time to development of acute leukemia 7 months, range 1–25 months). Therefore, primary chloroma could be considered an initial manifestation of acute leukemia, rather than a localized process, and could be treated as such. Where disease development or markers indicate progresses to acute promyleocytic leukemia (AML3) treatment should be tailored to this form of disease.

== Location and symptoms ==
Chloromas may occur in virtually any organ or tissue. The most common areas of involvement are the skin (also known as &quot;leukemia cutis&quot;) and the gums. Skin involvement typically appears as violaceous, raised, nontender plaques or nodules, which on biopsy are found to be infiltrated with myeloblasts&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26063639&quot;&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Note that leukemia cutis differs from Sweet&#x27;s syndrome, in which the skin is infiltrated by mature neutrophils in a paraneoplastic process. Gum involvement (gingival hypertrophy) leads to swollen, sometimes painful gums which bleed easily with tooth brushing and other minor trauma.

Other tissues which can be involved include lymph nodes, the small intestine, the mediastinum, the lung, epidural sites, the uterus, the ovaries, and the orbit of the eye. Symptoms of chloroma at these sites are related to their anatomic location; chloromas may also be asymptomatic and be discovered incidentally in the course of evaluation of a person with acute myeloid leukemia.

Central nervous system involvement, as described above, most often takes the form of &quot;meningeal leukemia&quot;, or invasion of the subarachnoid space by leukemic cells. This condition is usually considered separately from chloroma, as it requires different treatment modalities. True chloromas (i.e. solid leukemic tumors) of the central nervous system are exceedingly rare, but have been described.

== Diagnosis ==
Definitive diagnosis of a chloroma usually requires a biopsy of the lesion in question. Historically, even with a tissue biopsy, pathologic misdiagnosis was an important problem, particularly in patients without a clear pre-existing diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia to guide the pathologist. In one published series on chloroma, the authors stated that 47% of the patients were initially misdiagnosed, most often as having a malignant lymphoma.

However, with advances in diagnostic techniques, the diagnosis of chloromas can be made more reliable. Traweek et al. described the use of a commercially available panel of monoclonal antibodies, against myeloperoxidase, CD68, CD43, and CD20, to accurately diagnose chloroma via immunohistochemistry and differentiate it from lymphoma. Nowadays, immunohistochemical staining using monoclonal antibodies against CD33 and CD117 would be the mainstay of diagnosis. The increasingly refined use of flow cytometry has also facilitated more accurate diagnosis of these lesions.

== Prognostic significance ==
Evidence is conflicting on the prognostic significance of chloromas in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. In general, they are felt to augur a poorer prognosis, with a poorer response to treatment and worse survival; however, others have reported chloromas associate, as a biologic marker, with other poor prognostic factors, and therefore do not have independent prognostic significance. In case of primary isolated choloroma, prognosis is better 

== Treatment ==
As described above, chloromas should always be considered manifestations of systemic disease, rather than isolated local phenomena, and treated as such. In the patient with newly diagnosed leukemia and an associated chloroma, systemic chemotherapy against the leukemia is typically used as the first-line treatment, unless an indication for local treatment of the chloroma (e.g. compromise of the spinal cord) emerges. Chloromas are typically quite sensitive to standard antileukemic chemotherapy. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation should be considered in fit patients with suitable available donor, as long term remissions have been reported.

If the chloroma is persistent after completion of induction chemotherapy, local treatment, such as surgery or radiation therapy, may be considered, although neither has an effect on survival.

Patients presenting with a primary chloroma typically receive systemic chemotherapy, as development of acute leukemia is nearly universal in the short term after detection of the chloroma.

Patients treated for acute leukemia who relapse with an isolated chloroma are typically treated with systemic therapy for relapsed leukemia. However, as with any relapsed leukemia, outcomes are unfortunately poor.

Patients with &quot;preleukemic&quot; conditions, such as myelodysplastic syndromes or myeloproliferative syndromes, who develop a chloroma are often treated as if they have transformed to acute leukemia.

== History ==
The condition now known as chloroma was first described by the British physician A. Burns in 1811, although the term &quot;chloroma&quot; did not appear until 1853. This name is derived from the Greek word &quot;chloros&quot; (green), as these tumors often have a green tint due to the presence of myeloperoxidase. The link between chloroma and acute leukemia was first recognized in 1902 by Dock and Warthin. However, because up to 30% of these tumors can be white, gray, or brown rather than green, the more correct term &quot;granulocytic sarcoma&quot; was proposed by Rappaport in 1967 and has since become virtually synonymous with the term &quot;chloroma&quot;.

Currently, any extramedullary manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia can be termed a granulocytic sarcoma or chloroma. Specific terms which overlap with granulocytic sarcoma include:
* Leukemia cutis, describing infiltration of the dermis (skin) by leukemic cells, which is also referred to as cutaneous granulocytic sarcoma.
* Meningeal leukemia, or invasion of the subarachnoid space by leukemic cells, is usually considered distinct from chloroma, although very rarely occurring solid central nervous system tumors composed of leukemic cells can be termed chloromas.

In recent years, the term &quot;myeloid sarcoma&quot; has been favored.

<doc id="1300903" wikidata="Q5333886" url="?curid=1300903" title="Ecosystem valuation">
<text>Ecosystem valuation is an economic process which assigns a value (either monetary, biophysical, or other) to an ecosystem and/or its ecosystem services. By quantifying, for example, the human welfare benefits of a forest to reduce flooding and erosion while sequestering carbon, providing habitat for endangered species, and absorbing harmful chemicals, such monetization ideally provides a tool for policy-makers and conservationists to evaluate management impacts and compare a cost-benefit analysis of potential policies. However, such valuations are estimates, and involve the inherent quantitative uncertainty and philosophical debate of evaluating a range non-market costs and benefits.

==History and Economic Model==

=== History ===
Cost-benefit analyses and the generation of market value have existed within the economic literature for centuries. However, in 1997, Robert Costanza, Distinguished University Professor of sustainability at Portland State University, Oregon, was the first to estimate the worldwide worth of ecosystem services—bringing new attention to the field of ecosystem valuation. He and his colleagues calculated that such services were worth $33 trillion annually ($44 trillion present dollars).

Despite Costanza&#x27;s fanfare, the World Bank, three decades later, that &quot;the benefits provided by natural ecosystems are both widely recognized and poorly understood.”

Citing the importance of such knowledge to informed policy-making, in 2007, Environmental Ministers from the G8 + 5 nations agreed to both publicly call for and begin to undertake the calculation of global ecosystem benefits, conservation costs, and the opportunity costs of developing such ecosystems. The resulting watershed initiative and ongoing project is The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB).

In the United States, the President&#x27;s Council on Science and Technology suggested in 2011 that the “U.S. government should institute and fund a Quadrennial Ecosystems Services Trends (QuEST) Assessment” that studying trends in ecosystem performance, quality, and value.

=== Economic Models: Values, Costs, and Value Methodology ===
Ecosystem valuation attempts to capture the range of benefits and costs contained within a complicated natural web with a range of economic methodologies.

Ecological systems provide four general categories of services: provisioning (e.g. fish to eat, timber to sell), regulatory, supporting, and cultural (e.g. ecosystems supporting indigenous gathering techniques, or supplies for traditional clothing). See Figure 1. for a mangrove-specific example of this complex subject.
These four types of services can then provide two basic categories of value: the use and non-use categories. Environmental economists have further separated categorizes for which individuals are willing to pay:
* Direct-use value.
** The simplest form of ecosystem valuation for orthodox environmental economists, this translates the direct ecological yield as it would be on international trade markets: e.g. the value of water, timber, fish, or other commodities if immediately developed and sold at market price.Thus, an exchange value or &#x27;price&#x27; is associated with the objects of value, regarded as natural capital, associated with ecosystems and this may be based on the ability of a system to produce yields each year that are exchangeable in operating markets and have existing exchange prices.
* Indirect use value attributed to indirect utilization of ecosystem services, through the positive externalities that ecosystems provide.
** The World Bank explains that these values are &quot;derived from ecosystem services that provide benefits outside the ecosystem itself. Examples include natural water filtration which often benefits people far downstream, the storm protection function of mangrove forests which benefits coastal properties and infrastructure, and carbon sequestration which benefits the entire global community by abating climate change.&quot;
* &quot;Option value&quot; attributed to preserving the option to utilize ecosystem services in the future.
* &quot;Existence value&quot; attributed to the pure existence of an ecosystem.
* &quot;Altruistic value&quot; based on the welfare the ecosystem may give other people.
* &quot;Bequest value&quot; based on the welfare the ecosystem may give future generations.
Given these types of potential ecological values, economists utilize a variety of methods to calculate those market values and measure non-market values. Standard environmental economic methods are used to place a monetary value on ecosystem services where there are no market prices. These include &quot;stated preference&quot; methods and &quot;revealed preference&quot; methods. Stated preference methods, such as the contingent valuation method ask people for their willingness to pay for a certain ecosystem (service). Revealed preference methods, such as hedonic pricing and the travel cost method, use a relation with a market good or service to estimate the willingness-to-pay for the service. Applying such preference based approaches has been criticized as a means of deriving the value of ecosystems and biodiversity and for avoiding deliberation, justification and judgment in making choices. The monetary value society attaches to ecosystem services depends on the income distribution. It is argued that ecosystem valuations must steadily increase over time, in line with rising global income as well as increasing scarcity of functioning ecosystems.

==Valuation Results==
While the literature is still emerging, many important studies have resulting in striking valuations.

One academic paper by de Groot et al., which synthesized more than 300 scholarly works collectively evaluating the 10 main biomes, &quot;shows that the total value of ecosystem services is considerable and ranges between 490 int$/year for the total bundle of ecosystem services that can potentially be provided by an ‘average’ hectare of open oceans to almost 350,000 int$/year for the potential services of an ‘average’ hectare of coral reefs.&quot; This potential benefit can take many forms depending on the degree of exploitation and such exploitation&#x27;s sustainability, but can result, for example, in large ecotourist revenues for local communities, protection from storm destruction, or profit for an international lumber company.

Furthermore, de Groot et al. find that most of their paper&#x27;s calculated value is &quot;outside the market and best considered as non-tradable public benefits. The continued over-exploitation of ecosystems thus comes at the expense of the livelihood of the poor and future generations.&quot;

The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB), in one of its first large, cumulative reports, also found that ecosystem services start at roughly $100/hectare/year for open ocean, and top off to more than $1,000,000/hectare/year for the most lucrative coral reefs.

Beyond biome &quot;price tags,&quot; these environmental valuations can explore quite complex policy questions. For example, the Copenhagen Consensus think tank calculated that stemming the loss of coral reefs by 50 percent by 2030 would return more than $24 for every dollar spent. The Consensus&#x27; founder, Bjorn Lomborg, explains that &quot;coral reefs, which both act as fishery hatcheries and fishing resources while storing abundant numbers of species. At the same time, coral reefs possess an amazing beauty, which both shows up in large tourism revenues but also in most individuals saying they are willing to pay a certain amount to make sure they continue to exist for our grand children. … [Programs to preserve 50% more coral reef by 2030] cost about $3 billion per year but the total benefits likely run to at least $72, or about $24 dollars back for every dollar invested.&quot;

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) manages the Integrated Valuation Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) Natural Capital Project. This open-source tool—although geared towards policy-makers, advocates, and scientists—allows anyone to interact with a map quantifying &quot;trade-offs between alternative management choices&quot; and identifying &quot;areas where investment in natural capital can enhance human development and conservation.”

As another example, the Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3) hosts the Artificial Intelligence for Environment &amp; Sustainability (ARIES) Project. This open-source software was designed to integrate scientific models for environmental sustainability assessment and policy-making, with an initial focus on ecosystem services

=== Payment for Environmental Services (PES) ===
After (and, sometimes, before) evaluating the ecosystem costs and benefits, some programs have attempted to internalize those values with specific programs providing payments for environmental services. Costa Rica paid about $42/hectare for landowners to preserve forests; in 2010 Norway began paying Indonesia a total of $1 billion to mitigate deforestation; China responded to 1998 floods with payments targeting deforestation and soil erosion; and many other programs large and small.

== Controversies with and Limits to Ecosystem Valuations ==
From an academic perspective, although scholarly research is quite rapidly adding to this field of understanding, many knowledge gaps still remain. For example, there is an inherent uncertainty in attempting to quantify non-market goods. As pointed to by de Groot et al., many environmental goods (such as clean air and biodiversity) are simply not traded in established markets. In addition, many environmental goods may be non-rival, non-excludable, and even inseparable goods with multiple value options further complicating any valuation.

From an ethical and philosophical perspective, too, ecosystem valuation is far from uncontroversial. Arguments about the non-market valuation of ecosystem can be found by referring to environmental ethics and deep ecology.

Since animals do not put explicit prices on ecosystems they use, but do behave as if they are valuable, e.g. by selecting one territory vs. another, defending their territories, etc., it is mostly a matter of definition whether ecology should include valuation as an issue. It may be anthropocentric to do so, since &quot;valuation&quot; more clearly refers to a human perception rather than being an &quot;objective&quot; attribute of the system perceived. Ecology itself is also human perception, and such related concepts as a food chain are constructed by humans to help them understand ecosystems. In many cases by those who hold that markets and pricing exist independently of any individual human observers and &quot;users&quot;, and especially those who deem markets to be &quot;out of control&quot;, ecosystem valuation is considered a (marginal, ignored) part of economics. Others argue that natural capital is an economic concept that is at least as viable as financial capital, which itself is determined on subjective valuation. Some even suggest that valuation of ecosystem services is more cogent than financial valuation, as the ecosystem would continue after the collapse of the economy, while the inverse is not valid.

In addition, many fascinating questions about where ecosystem benefits go, and who should pay for those benefits, is an ongoing political debate. In one Washington city, residents now pay a water bill in order for the town to buy and restore land adjacent to the municipal water source; and international examples of evaluating and paying for services is no less a fascinating field of ongoing development.

<doc id="1300914" wikidata="Q472549" url="?curid=1300914" title="Stan Greenberg">
<text>Stanley Bernard Greenberg (born May 10, 1945) is an American pollster and political strategist affiliated with the Democratic Party. Greenberg is a founding partner of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research (GQR) and Democracy Corps, political consulting and research firms headquartered in Washington, D.C.

Described as a &quot;pollster supremo&quot;, Greenberg is known to have played a crucial role in the elections of Bill Clinton as President of the United States, Tony Blair as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and Isaac Herzog as President of Israel. As an anti-racist activist, Greenberg has written extensively about race relations in South Africa, and assisted Nelson Mandela&#x27;s successful campaign in the 1994 South African general election.

== Early life and career ==
Greenberg grew up in a Jewish family in Washington, D.C. In an article for &quot;Pacific Standard&quot; titled &quot;Why Are You So Smart, Stan Greenberg?&quot;, Greenberg explained that a high school course called &quot;American Civilization&quot; partially inspired him to seek a career in politics. A political scientist who received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Miami University and his Ph.D. from Harvard, Greenberg spent a decade teaching at Yale University before becoming a political consultant. Greenberg was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1976. 

Greenberg&#x27;s 1985 study of Reagan Democrats in Macomb County, Michigan, became a classic of progressive political strategy and the basis for his continuing argument that Democrats must actively work to present themselves as populists advocating the expansion of opportunity for the middle class. In 2021, Greenberg argued that educated and affluent white middle class Republicans who oppose the policies and social views of Donald Trump had voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 United States presidential election. Greenberg referred to these voters as &quot;Biden Republicans&quot;, and argued they could harm the long-term electoral strength of the Republican Party.

== Political consulting career ==
As the pollster for Clinton in the 1992 United States presidential election, Greenberg was a major figure in the famed campaign &quot;war room&quot; and hence the documentary film of the same name. He was the CEO and principal owner of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner until 2016. After that, Greenberg was solely involved in Greenberg Research, where he is the CEO. He is co-founder (with James Carville and Bob Shrum) of Democracy Corps, a non-profit organization that produces left-leaning political strategy. He was previously a partner at Greenberg Carville Shrum, a political campaign consultancy firm. Greenberg is a noted advocate of progressive economic policies, and collaborated with left-wing think tank Economic Policy Institute (EPI) on a seminar titled &quot;It&#x27;s The Middle Class, Stupid!&quot;.

In May 2010, Greenberg was linked to a controversy involving White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. As a House member, Emanuel had lived rent-free for five years in a basement guest room in the DC house owned by Greenberg and his wife, Democratic House member Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut. During this time, Emanuel served as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which awarded large polling contracts to Greenberg&#x27;s firm. Greenberg&#x27;s former corporate clients include British Petroleum, British Airways, Monsanto Company, Boeing, General Motors, and Microsoft.

=== International political work ===
Greenberg advised the presidential campaigns of Bill Clinton and Al Gore, as well as hundreds of other candidates and organizations in the United States, Latin America, Europe, and around the world, including Nelson Mandela, Ehud Barak (the former Israeli prime minister), Gerhard Schröder (the former Chancellor of Germany), and Tony Blair (the former British prime minister). During his work for the Austrian SPÖ in 2001, Greenberg was criticized by FPÖ leader Jörg Haider over allegations of negative campaigning. Greenberg works as a political consultant to the Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.

==Personal life==
Greenberg is married to Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, who represents Connecticut&#x27;s 3rd congressional district. Public financial disclosures filed in Congress indicate Greenberg&#x27;s company, Greenberg Research, is worth up to $5 million.

<doc id="1300916" wikidata="Q356005" url="?curid=1300916" title="Adenoid cystic carcinoma">
<text>Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a rare type of cancer that can exist in many different body sites. This tumor most often occurs in the salivary glands, but it can also be found in many anatomic sites, including the breast, lacrimal gland, lung, brain, Bartholin gland, trachea, and the paranasal sinuses.

It is the third-most common malignant salivary gland tumor overall (after mucoepidermoid carcinoma and polymorphous adenocarcinoma). It represents 28% of malignant submandibular gland tumors, making it the single most common malignant salivary gland tumor in this region. Patients may survive for years with metastases because this tumor is generally well-differentiated and slow growing. In a 1999 study of a cohort of 160 ACC patients, disease-specific survival was 89% at 5 years, but only 40% at 15 years, reflecting deaths from late-occurring metastatic disease.

==Cause==
Activation of the oncogenic transcription factor gene &quot;MYB&quot; is the key genomic event of ACC and seen in the vast majority of cases.
Most commonly, &quot;MYB&quot; is activated through gene fusion with the transcription factor encoding &quot;NFIB&quot; gene as a result of a t(6;9) translocation. Alternatively, &quot;MYB&quot; is activated by copy number gain or by juxtaposition of enhancer elements in the vicinity of the &quot;MYB&quot; gene.
In a subset of ACCs, the closely related &quot;MYBL1&quot; gene is fused to &quot;NFIB&quot; or to other fusion partners.

MYB drives proliferation of ACC cells and regulates genes involved in cell cycle control, DNA replication and repair, and RNA processing. Thus, the &quot;MYB&quot; oncogene is a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target in ACC.

ACC has a relatively quiet genome with few recurrent copy number alterations or point mutations, consistent with the view that MYB and MYBL1 are the main oncogenic drivers of the disease.

==Treatment==
Primary treatment for this cancer, regardless of body site, is surgical removal with clean margins. This surgery can prove challenging in the head and neck region due to this tumor&#x27;s tendency to show a perineural discontinuous growth, meaning that it follows nerves and different &quot;nests&quot; of the tumor can exist without a connection to the original tumor. Therefore, MRI-images should be analysed following nerve tracts up to the brainstem. Adjuvant or palliative radiotherapy is commonly given following surgery. For advanced major and minor salivary gland tumors that are inoperable, recurrent, or exhibit gross residual disease after surgery, fast neutron therapy is widely regarded as the most effective form of treatment.
Chemotherapy is used for metastatic disease. Chemotherapy is considered on a case-by-case basis, as data on the positive effects of chemotherapy are limited. Clinical studies are ongoing, however.

<doc id="1300918" wikidata="Q3228823" url="?curid=1300918" title="Ledward Kaapana">
<text>Ledward Kaapana (born August 25, 1948) is a Hawaiian musician, best known for playing in the slack key guitar style. In 2011, he received a National Heritage Fellowship, the United States government&#x27;s highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. He also plays steel guitar, ukulele, autoharp, and bass guitar, and is a baritone and falsetto vocalist. He received Na Hoku Hanohano Awards from the Hawai&#x27;i Academy of Recording Arts (HARA), and has been nominated for Grammy Awards.

==Early life==
Born on August 25, 1948, Led grew up in a musical family living in the small black sand bay village of Kalapana (mostly destroyed by the 1986 volcanic eruption of Kilauea), where he states there were few distractions. &quot;We didn&#x27;t have electricity, not television, not even much radio, so we entertained ourselves. You could go to any house and everybody was playing music.&quot; He was taught by his mother, Tina, and his uncle, the rarely recorded slack-key master Fred Punahoa.

==Professional career==
In his teens, Kaapana formed the musical group Hui &#x27;Ohana (means &quot;Family Group&quot;), with his twin brother, Nedward Kaapana, and his cousin, falsetto-great Dennis Pavao. Hui &#x27;Ohana released fourteen albums, each of which was a commercial and critical success. Kaapana left the group eventually, and then released six albums as the leader of another trio, I Kona, and performed with the Pahinui Brothers, &#x27;Aunty&#x27; Genoa Keawe, David Chun, Barney Isaacs, and Uncle Joe Keawe.

His first solo album, &quot;Lima Wela&quot; (means &quot;Hot Hands&quot;), was released in 1983; the album won the Na Hoku Hanohano (means &quot;Honored Stars&quot;) Award for &quot;Instrumental Album of the Year&quot; in 1984. He released &quot;Simply Slack Key&quot; in 1988, and &quot;Led Live&quot; in 1994 on Dancing Cat Records. He has performed and recorded with acoustic lap-steel player Bob Brozman, and released several more albums on the Dancing Cat label from the late 1990s onward. One of the greatest living slack key masters, Ledward has deep roots in the older styles, using only index finger and thumb picks to combine traditional musical phrases, some modern influences, and spontaneous improvisation to create beautiful multipart arrangements that are simultaneously old and new.

Nashville great Chet Atkins was so impressed by Ledward&#x27;s playing that he paid him the ultimate country music compliment by giving Ledward his guitar. Ledward has played at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C., and made many tours of North America; his fans frequently refer to themselves as &quot;Led Heads.&quot;

Kaapana (&quot;Kah-ah-pah-nah&quot;) spells his name without using the modern &quot; ʻokina &quot; marking that is used to indicate a glottal stop for the proper pronunciation of certain Hawaiian words. Kaapana has said that his family has always spelled it without an &quot;ʻokina&quot; and he prefers the traditional spelling (not Kaʻapana.)

==Quotes==
&quot;Everything you play, every time you play, there&#x27;s a mood, an energy. If you plug into it, the music just flows. Even in a simple song, there are so many different ways to play the melody, the rhythm, the harmony. It never stops if you stay open to it.&quot;

==Awards==
He is one of the very few Hawaiian recording artists who has received Na Hoku Hanohano Awards from the Hawai&#x27;i Academy of Recording Arts (HARA) for work as a member of three different recording entities—as a solo artist, as a member of Ledward Kaapana &amp; I Kona, and as a member of Hui &#x27;Ohana. As of 2010, four of his solo albums have received Grammy Award nominations in the Best Hawaiian Music Album category.

Kaapana is a recipient of the 2011 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government&#x27;s highest honor in the folk and traditional arts.

<doc id="1300923" wikidata="Q7919370" url="?curid=1300923" title="Velveeta">
<text>Velveeta is a brand name for a processed cheese similar to American cheese. It was invented in 1918 by Emil Frey (1867–1951) of the Monroe Cheese Company in Monroe, New York. In 1923, The Velveeta Cheese Company was incorporated as a separate company. In 1925, it advertised two varieties, Swiss and American. The firm was purchased by Kraft Foods Inc. in 1927. 

== History ==
In 1888, the new owners of the Monroe Cheese Co., Adolphe Tode and Ferdinand Wolfe, hired former Neuesswanders Cheese Factory’s cheesemaker Emil Frey. While they would see success with one of Frey’s creations, Liederkranz cheese, they still ultimately fell into financial problems resulting in the foreclosure of the property. In 1891, Jacob Weisl purchased the company from the Goshen Savings Bank. Weisl set up a second factory in Covington, Pennsylvania, that made mostly Swiss cheese. He would have the broken pieces of cheese sent up to Monroe hoping to find a way to prevent the waste. It was during this time that Frey began taking broken pieces of cheese back to his house where he spent two years working on a process to make use of them. In 1918 he had his breakthrough, mixing cheese byproducts with the broken cheese bits to form a cheese blend that would become known as Velveeta. The name &quot;Velveeta&quot; was intended to connote a &quot;velvety smooth&quot; product.

On February 14, 1923, Frey incorporated a separate Velveeta company independent from the Monroe Cheese Co. In 1926, the Monroe Cheese company closed down and one year later Velveeta was sold to Kraft. The brand has since been expanded into a line of products including cheesy bites, macaroni and cheese, and cheesy skillets.

In the 1930s, Velveeta became the first cheese product to gain the American Medical Association&#x27;s seal of approval. It was reformulated in 1953 as a &quot;cheese spread&quot;; however, as of 2002, Velveeta is labeled in the United States as a &quot;pasteurized prepared cheese product&quot;.

==Ingredients==

Kraft Foods lists Velveeta&#x27;s ingredients as: milk, canola oil, whey, milk protein concentrate, milkfat, whey protein concentrate, sodium phosphate, and 2% or less of salt, calcium phosphate, lactic acid, sorbic acid, sodium citrate, sodium alginate, enzymes, apocarotenal, annatto, and cheese culture.

== Classification as a pasteurized prepared cheese product ==
In 2002, the FDA issued a warning letter to Kraft that Velveeta was being sold with packaging that falsely described it as a &quot;pasteurized process cheese spread&quot;, The product listed milk protein concentrate (MPC) in its ingredients, which meant it no longer fit any of the FDA&#x27;s cheese-related definitions. Velveeta is now sold in the US as a &quot;pasteurized prepared cheese product&quot;, a term not defined by the FDA.

== Marketing and advertising ==

Kraft Foods has marketed Velveeta as an ingredient for chile con queso and grilled cheese sandwiches. It is sold in the United States, Canada, Panama, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and South Korea. In the 1930s and 1940s, it was sold in the United Kingdom and Germany as &quot;Velveta&quot;. 

In the 1980s, Velveeta used the advertising jingle, &quot;Colby, Swiss and Cheddar, blended all together&quot; in its US television commercials to explain its taste and texture because real cheese was used in the product at that time.

<doc id="1300924" wikidata="Q45769835" url="?curid=1300924" title="Alteplase">
<text>Alteplase, sold under the brand name Activase among others, is a biosynthetic form of human tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). It is a thrombolytic medication used to treat acute ischemic stroke, acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (a type of heart attack), pulmonary embolism associated with low blood pressure, and blocked central venous catheter. Alteplase is given by injection into a vein or artery. Alteplase is the same as the normal human plasminogen activator produced in vascular endothelial cells and is synthesized via recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO). Alteplase causes the breakdown of a clot by inducing fibrinolysis.

It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

== Medical uses ==
Alteplase is indicated for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, acute myocardial infarction, acute massive pulmonary embolism, and blocked catheters. Similar to other thrombolytic drugs, alteplase is used to dissolve clots to restore tissue perfusion, but this can vary depending on the pathology. Generally, alteplase is delivered intravenously into the body. To treat blocked catheters, alteplase is administered directly into the catheter.

=== Ischemic stroke ===
In adults diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke, thrombolytic treatment with alteplase is the standard of care. Administration of alteplase is associated with improved functional outcomes and reduced incidence of disability. Alteplase used in conjunction with mechanical thrombectomy is associated with better outcomes.

=== Pulmonary embolism===
As of 2019, alteplase is the most commonly used medication to treat pulmonary embolism (PE). Alteplase has a short infusion time of 2 hours and a half-life of 4–6 minutes. Alteplase has been approved by the FDA, and treatment can be done via systemic thrombolysis or catheter-directed thrombolysis.

Systemic thrombolysis can quickly restore right ventricular function, heart rate, and blood pressure in patients with acute PE. However, standard doses of alteplase used in systemic thrombolysis may lead to massive bleeding, such as intracranial hemorrhage, particularly in older patients. A systematic review has shown that low-dose alteplase is safer than and as effective as the standard amount.

=== Blocked catheters ===
Alteplase can be used in small doses to clear blood clots that obstruct a catheter, reopening the catheter so it can continue to be used. Catheter obstruction is commonly observed with a central venous catheter. Currently, the standard treatment for catheter obstructions in the United States is alteplase administration. Alteplase is effective and low risk for treating blocked catheters in adults and children. Overall, adverse effects of alteplase for clearing blood clots are rare. Novel alternatives to treat catheter occlusion, such as tenecteplase, reteplase, and recombinant urokinase, offer the advantage of shorter dwell times than alteplase.

== Contraindications ==
A person should not receive alteplase treatment if testing shows they are not suffering from an acute ischemic stroke or if the risks of treatment outweigh the likely benefits. Alteplase is contraindicated in those with bleeding disorders that increase a person&#x27;s tendency to bleed and in those with an abnormally low platelet count. Active internal bleeding and high blood pressure are additional contraindications for alteplase. The safety of alteplase in the pediatric population has not been determined definitively. Additional contraindications for alteplase when used specifically for acute ischemic stroke include current intracranial hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Contraindications for use of alteplase in people with a STEMI are similar to those of acute ischemic stroke. People with an acute ischemic stroke may also receive other therapies including mechanical thrombectomy.

== Adverse effects ==
Given that alteplase is a thrombolytic medication, a common adverse effect is bleeding, which can be life-threatening. Adverse effects of alteplase include symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and fatal intracranial hemorrhage.

Angioedema is another adverse effect of alteplase, which can be life-threatening if the airway becomes obstructed. Other side effects may rarely include allergic reactions.

== Mechanism of action ==
Alteplase binds to fibrin in a blood clot and activates the clot-bound plasminogen. Alteplase cleaves plasminogen at the site of its Arg561-Val562 peptide bond to form plasmin. Plasmin is a fibrinolytic enzyme that cleaves the cross-links between polymerized fibrin molecules, causing the blood clot to break down and dissolve, a process called fibrinolysis.

=== Regulation and inhibition ===
Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 stops alteplase activity by binding to it and forming an inactive complex, which is removed from the bloodstream by the liver. Fibrinolysis by plasmin is extremely short-lived due to plasmin inhibitors, which inactivate and regulate plasmin activity.

== History ==
In 1995, a study by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke showed the effectiveness of administering intravenous alteplase to treat ischemic stroke. This sparked a medical paradigm shift as it redesigned stroke treatment in the emergency department to allow for timely assessment and therapy for ischemic stroke patients.

==Society and culture==
Alteplase was added to the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines in 2019, for use in ischemic stroke.

=== Legal status ===
In May 1987, the United States FDA requested additional data for the drug rather than approve it outright, causing Genentech stock prices to fall by nearly one quarter. The decision was described as a surprise to the company as well as many cardiologists and regulators, and it generated significant criticism of the FDA, including from &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; editorial board.

After results from two additional trials were obtained, Alteplase was approved for medical use in the United States in November 1987 for the treatment of myocardial infarction. This was just seven years after the first efforts were made to produce recombinant t-PA, making it one of the fastest drug developments in history.

=== Economics ===
The cost of alteplase in the United States increased by 111% between 2005 and 2014, despite there being no proportional increase in the costs of other prescription drugs. However, alteplase continues to be cost-effective.

=== Brand names ===
Alteplase is sold under brand names Actilyse, Activase, and Cathflo Activase.

=== Controversies ===
Alteplase is extremely underused in low- and middle-income countries. This may be due to its high cost and the fact that it is often not covered by health insurance.

There may be citation bias in the literature on alteplase in ischemic stroke, as studies reporting positive results for tissue plasminogen activator are more likely to be cited in following studies than those reporting negative or neutral results.

There is a sex difference in the use of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, as it is less likely to be used for women with acute ischemic stroke than men. However, this difference has been improving since 2008.

<doc id="1300927" wikidata="Q2394718" url="?curid=1300927" title="Texas hold 'em starting hands">
<text>In Texas hold &#x27;em, a starting hand consists of two hole cards, which belong solely to the player and remain hidden from the other players. Five community cards are also dealt into play. Betting begins before any of the community cards are exposed, and continues throughout the hand. The player&#x27;s &quot;playing hand&quot;, which will be compared against that of each competing player, is the best 5-card poker hand available from his two hole cards and the five community cards. Unless otherwise specified, here the term &quot;hand&quot; applies to the player&#x27;s two hole cards, or &quot;starting hand&quot;.

== Essentials ==
There are 1326 distinct possible combinations of two hole cards from a standard 52-card deck in hold &#x27;em, but since suits have no absolute value in this poker variant, many of these hands are identical in value before the flop. For example, and are identical in value, because each is a hand consisting of an ace and a jack of the same suit.

Therefore, there are 169 non-equivalent starting hands in hold &#x27;em, which is the total count of 13 pocket pairs, 13 × 12 x 1 / 2 = 78 suited hands and likewise 78 unsuited hands (13 + 78 + 78 = 169).

These 169 hands are &quot;not&quot; equally likely. Hold &#x27;em hands are sometimes classified as having one of three &quot;shapes&quot;:

* &quot;Pairs,&quot; (or &quot;pocket pairs&quot;), which consist of two cards of the same rank (e.g. ). One hand in 17 will be a pair, P(pair) = 1/17.

:Alternative means of making this calculation

:First Step 
:As confirmed above.

:There are 1326 possible combinations of opening hand.

:Second Step

:There are 6 different combos of each pair. 9h9c, 9h9s, 9h9d, 9c9s, 9c9d, 9d9s. Therefore, there are 78 possible combinations of pocket pairs (6 multiplied by 13 i.e. 22-AA)

:To calculate the odds of being dealt a pair

:78 (the number of any particular pair being dealt. As above) divided by 1326 (possible opening hands)

:78/1326 ≈ 0.0588 or 5.88%

* &quot;Suited&quot; hands, which contain two cards of the same suit (e.g. ).
Probability of first card is 1.0 (any of the 52 cards)
Probability of second hand suit matching the first:
There are 13 cards per suit, and one is in your hand leaving 12 remaining of the 51 cards remaining in the deck. 12/51 ≈ 0.2353 or 23.53%

* &quot;Offsuit&quot; hands, which contain two cards of a different suit and rank (e.g. ). 70.59% of all hands are offsuit non-paired hands
Offsuit pairs = 78

Other offsuit hands = 936
It is typical to abbreviate suited hands in hold &#x27;em by affixing an &quot;s&quot; to the hand, as well as to abbreviate non-suited hands with an &quot;o&quot; (for offsuit). That is,

:QQ represents any pair of queens,
:KQ represents any king and queen,
:AKo represents any ace and king of different suits, and
:JTs represents any jack and ten of the same suit.

==Limit hand rankings==
Some notable theorists and players have created systems to rank the value of starting hands in limit Texas hold&#x27;em. These rankings do not apply to no limit play.

===Sklansky hand groups===

David Sklansky and Mason Malmuth assigned each hand to a group, and proposed all hands in the group could normally be played similarly. Stronger starting hands are identified by a lower number. Hands without a number are the weakest starting hands. As a general rule, books on Texas hold&#x27;em present hand strengths starting with the assumption of a nine or ten person table. The table below illustrates the concept:

===Chen formula===
The &quot;Chen Formula&quot; is a way to compute the &quot;power ratings&quot; of starting hands that was originally developed by Bill Chen.

;Highest Card
:Based on the highest card, assign points as follows: 
:Ace = 10 points, K = 8 points, Q = 7 points, J = 6 points.
:10 through 2, half of face value (10 = 5 points, 9 = 4.5 points, etc.)

;Pairs
:For pairs, multiply the points by 2 (AA=20, KK=16, etc.), with a minimum of 5 points for any pair. 55 is given an extra point (i.e., 6).

;Suited
:Add 2 points for suited cards.

;Closeness
:Subtract 1 point for 1 gappers (AQ, J9)
:2 points for 2 gappers (J8, AJ).
:4 points for 3 gappers (J7, 73).
:5 points for larger gappers, including A2 A3 A4

:Add an extra point if connected or 1-gap and your highest card is lower than Q (since you then can make all higher straights)

===Phil Hellmuth&#x27;s: &quot;Play Poker Like the Pros&quot;===
Phil Hellmuth&#x27;s &quot;Play Poker Like the Pros&quot; book published in 2003.

===Statistics based on real online play===
Statistics based on real play with their associated actual value in real bets.

==Nicknames for starting hands==

In poker communities, it is common for hole cards to be given nicknames. While most combinations have a nickname, stronger handed nicknames are generally more recognized, the most notable probably being the &quot;Big Slick&quot; - Ace and King of the same suit, although an Ace-King of any suit combination is less occasionally referred to as an Anna Kournikova, derived from the initials AK and because it &quot;looks really good but rarely wins.&quot; Hands can be named according to their shapes (e.g., paired aces look like &quot;rockets&quot;, paired jacks look like &quot;fish hooks&quot;); a historic event (e.g., A&#x27;s and 8&#x27;s - dead man&#x27;s hand, representing the hand held by Wild Bill Hickok when he was fatally shot in the back by Jack McCall in 1876); many other reasons like animal names, alliteration and rhyming are also used in nicknames.

<text>Związek Harcerstwa Rzeczypospolitej (&quot;Scouting Association of the Republic&quot;, ZHR) is a Polish Scouting organization founded on 12 February 1989. At present, Związek Harcerstwa Rzeczypospolitej has over 17,500 members. At present, Związek Harcerstwa Rzeczypospolitej is an associate member of the Confederation of European Scouts.

==History==
In 1956, after Stalin&#x27;s and Bierut&#x27;s death, the communist party youth movement ZMP OH was transformed and renamed to ZHP, the same name the Polish Scouting association had before World War II. After 1958 many pre-war instructors were removed from the new ZHP or marginalized, and the original oath, law, educational content and methods were changed. After Pope John Paul II&#x27;s first pilgrimage to Poland in August 1980, some &quot;non-conforming&quot; instructors inside the ZHP created the Andrzej Małkowski Circle of Scout Instructors (KIHAM), with the objective of restoring the original Scout ideals. After the 7th Congress of ZHP at the beginning of 1981 rejected all their motions and the martial law was imposed in December 1981, they went underground. The underground movement came to light in the fall of 1988. After they were unsuccessful in reforming the ZHP their way, the ZHR was founded.

=== Canada: ZHRwK ===
In June 1996, a new branch of ZHR (&quot;Związek Harcerstwa Rzeczypospolitej w Kanadzie&quot;) was established in Canada by Elżbieta Lyszkiewicz with the stated goal of continuing the traditions of Polish scouting for the Polish diaspora. ZHRwK remains in operation, holding annual summer camps in the Madawaska Valley of Southern Ontario, an area known to the Polish diaspora in Canada as &quot;Kaszuby&quot;. 

==Organization==
The association is divided into Girl Guide and Boy Scout Organizations which involve:

* Cub Scouts (7–10 years old)
* Boy and Girl Scouts (11–14 years old)
* Boy and Girl Wanderers (15–18 years old)
* Senior Boy and Girl Scouts (over 18).

ZHR is divided into 13 Districts. Each District consists of a girl scout company and a boy scout company. The companies consists of troops which consist of squads.

The logo of the ZHR and the Boy Scout Organization is a white Fleur-de-Lis with the Polish Flag. The logo of the Girl Guide Organization is a modified ZHR logo on a blue trefoil.

<doc id="1300938" wikidata="Q174378" url="?curid=1300938" title="Histone deacetylase">
<text>Histone deacetylases (, HDAC) are a class of enzymes that remove acetyl groups (O=C-CH3) from an ε-N-acetyl lysine amino acid on both histone and non-histone proteins. HDACs allow histones to wrap the DNA more tightly. This is important because DNA is wrapped around histones, and DNA expression is regulated by acetylation and de-acetylation. HDAC&#x27;s action is opposite to that of histone acetyltransferase. HDAC proteins are now also called lysine deacetylases (KDAC), to describe their function rather than their target, which also includes non-histone proteins. In general, they suppress gene expression.

== HDAC super family ==
Together with the acetylpolyamine amidohydrolases and the acetoin utilization proteins, the histone deacetylases form an ancient protein superfamily known as the histone deacetylase superfamily.

== Classes of HDACs in higher eukaryotes ==
HDACs, are classified in four classes depending on sequence homology to the yeast original enzymes and domain organization:

HDAC (except class III) contain zinc and are known as Zn2+-dependent histone deacetylases. They feature a classical arginase fold and are structurally and mechanistically distinct from sirtuins (class III), which fold into a Rossmann architecture and are NAD+ dependent.

== Subtypes ==
HDAC proteins are grouped into four classes (see above) based on function and DNA sequence similarity. Class I, II and IV are considered &quot;classical&quot; HDACs whose activities are inhibited by trichostatin A (TSA) and have a zinc dependent active site, whereas Class III enzymes are a family of NAD+-dependent proteins known as sirtuins and are not affected by TSA. Homologues to these three groups are found in yeast having the names: reduced potassium dependency 3 (Rpd3), which corresponds to Class I; histone deacetylase 1 (hda1), corresponding to Class II; and silent information regulator 2 (Sir2), corresponding to Class III. Class IV contains just one isoform (HDAC11), which is not highly homologous with either Rpd3 or hda1 yeast enzymes, and therefore HDAC11 is assigned to its own class. The Class III enzymes are considered a separate type of enzyme and have a different mechanism of action; these enzymes are NAD+-dependent, whereas HDACs in other classes require Zn2+ as a cofactor.

== Evolution ==
HDACs are conserved across evolution, showing orthologs in all eukaryotes and even in Archaea. All upper eukaryotes, including vertebrates, plants and arthropods, possess at least one HDAC per class, while most vertebrates carry the 11 canonical HDACs, with the exception of bone fish, which lack HDAC2 but appears to have an extra copy of HDAC11, dubbed HDAC12. Plants carry additional HDACs compared to animals, putatively to carry out the more complex transcriptional regulation required by these sessile organisms. HDACs appear to be deriving from an ancestral acetyl-binding domain, as HDAC homologs have been found in bacteria in the form of Acetoin utilization proteins (AcuC) proteins.
== Subcellular distribution ==
Within the Class I HDACs, HDAC1, 2, and 3 are found primarily in the nucleus, whereas HDAC8 is found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and is also membrane-associated. Class II HDACs (HDAC4, 5, 6, 7 9, and 10) are able to shuttle in and out of the nucleus, depending on different signals.

HDAC6 is a cytoplasmic, microtubule-associated enzyme. HDAC6 deacetylates tubulin, Hsp90, and cortactin, and forms complexes with other partner proteins, and is, therefore, involved in a variety of biological processes.

== Function ==
===Histone modification===
Histone tails are normally positively charged due to amine groups present on their lysine and arginine amino acids. These positive charges help the histone tails to interact with and bind to the negatively charged phosphate groups on the DNA backbone. Acetylation, which occurs normally in a cell, neutralizes the positive charges on the histone by changing amines into amides and decreases the ability of the histones to bind to DNA. This decreased binding allows chromatin expansion, permitting genetic transcription to take place. Histone deacetylases remove those acetyl groups, increasing the positive charge of histone tails and encouraging high-affinity binding between the histones and DNA backbone. The increased DNA binding condenses DNA structure, preventing transcription.

Histone deacetylase is involved in a series of pathways within the living system. According to the &quot;Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes&quot; (KEGG), these are:

* Environmental information processing; signal transduction; notch signaling pathway PATH:ko04330
* Cellular processes; cell growth and death; cell cycle PATH:ko04110
* Human diseases; cancers; chronic myeloid leukemia PATH:ko05220

Histone acetylation plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression. Hyperacetylated chromatin is transcriptionally active, and hypoacetylated chromatin is silent. A study on mice found that a specific subset of mouse genes (7%) was deregulated in the absence of HDAC1. Their study also found a regulatory crosstalk between HDAC1 and HDAC2 and suggest a novel function for HDAC1 as a transcriptional coactivator. HDAC1 expression was found to be increased in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia subjects, negatively correlating with the expression of GAD67 mRNA.

===Non-histone effects===
It is a mistake to regard HDACs solely in the context of regulating gene transcription by modifying histones and chromatin structure, although that appears to be the predominant function. The function, activity, and stability of proteins can be controlled by post-translational modifications. Protein phosphorylation is perhaps the most widely studied and understood modification in which certain amino acid residues are phosphorylated by the action of protein kinases or dephosphorylated by the action of phosphatases. The acetylation of lysine residues is emerging as an analogous mechanism, in which non-histone proteins are acted on by acetylases and deacetylases. It is in this context that HDACs are being found to interact with a variety of non-histone proteins—some of these are transcription factors and co-regulators, some are not. Note the following four examples:
* HDAC6 is associated with aggresomes. Misfolded protein aggregates are tagged by ubiquitination and removed from the cytoplasm by dynein motors via the microtubule network to an organelle termed the aggresome. HDAC 6 binds polyubiquitinated misfolded proteins and links to dynein motors, thereby allowing the misfolded protein cargo to be physically transported to chaperones and proteasomes for subsequent destruction. HDAC6 is important regulator of HSP90 function and its inhibitor proposed to treat metabolic disorders.
* PTEN is an important phosphatase involved in cell signaling via phosphoinositols and the AKT/PI3 kinase pathway. PTEN is subject to complex regulatory control via phosphorylation, ubiquitination, oxidation and acetylation. Acetylation of PTEN by the histone acetyltransferase p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) can repress its activity; on the converse, deacetylation of PTEN by SIRT1 deacetylase and, by HDAC1, can stimulate its activity.
* APE1/Ref-1 (APEX1) is a multifunctional protein possessing both DNA repair activity (on abasic and single-strand break sites) and transcriptional regulatory activity associated with oxidative stress. APE1/Ref-1 is acetylated by PCAF; on the converse, it is stably associated with and deacetylated by Class I HDACs. The acetylation state of APE1/Ref-1 does not appear to affect its DNA repair activity, but it does regulate its transcriptional activity such as its ability to bind to the PTH promoter and initiate transcription of the parathyroid hormone gene.
* NF-κB is a key transcription factor and effector molecule involved in responses to cell stress, consisting of a p50/p65 heterodimer. The p65 subunit is controlled by acetylation via PCAF and by deacetylation via HDAC3 and HDAC6.
These are just some examples of constantly emerging non-histone, non-chromatin roles for HDACs.

==HDAC inhibitors==
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs) have a long history of use in psychiatry and neurology as mood stabilizers and anti-epileptics, for example, valproic acid. In more recent times, HDIs are being studied as a mitigator or treatment for neurodegenerative diseases. Also in recent years, there has been an effort to develop HDIs for cancer therapy. Vorinostat (SAHA) was FDA approved in 2006 for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations in patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) that have failed previous treatments. A second HDI, Istodax (romidepsin), was approved in 2009 for patients with CTCL. The exact mechanisms by which the compounds may work are unclear, but epigenetic pathways are proposed. In addition, a clinical trial is studying valproic acid effects on the latent pools of HIV in infected persons. HDIs are currently being investigated as chemosensitizers for cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or in association with DNA methylation inhibitors based on in vitro synergy. Isoform selective HDIs which can aid in elucidating role of individual HDAC isoforms have been developed.

HDAC inhibitors have effects on non-histone proteins that are related to acetylation. HDIs can alter the degree of acetylation of these molecules and, therefore, increase or repress their activity. For the four examples given above (see &quot;Function&quot;) on HDACs acting on non-histone proteins, in each of those instances the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) blocks the effect. HDIs have been shown to alter the activity of many transcription factors, including ACTR, cMyb, E2F1, EKLF, FEN 1, GATA, HNF-4, HSP90, Ku70, NFκB, PCNA, p53, RB, Runx, SF1 Sp3, STAT, TFIIE, TCF, and YY1.

The ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate has been shown in mice to increase gene expression of FOXO3a by histone deacetylase inhibition.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors may modulate the latency of some viruses, resulting in reactivation. This has been shown to occur, for instance, with a latent &quot;human herpesvirus-6&quot; infection.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors have shown activity against certain &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species and stages which may indicate they have potential in malaria treatment. It has been shown that HDIs accumulate acetylated histone H3K9/H3K14, a downstream target of class I HDACs.

<doc id="1300939" wikidata="Q6029718" url="?curid=1300939" title="Infinite-dimensional optimization">
<text>In certain optimization problems the unknown optimal solution might not be a number or a vector, but rather a continuous quantity, for example a function or the shape of a body. Such a problem is an infinite-dimensional optimization problem, because, a continuous quantity cannot be determined by a finite number of certain degrees of freedom.

== Examples ==

* Find the shortest path between two points in a plane. The variables in this problem are the curves connecting the two points. The optimal solution is of course the line segment joining the points, if the metric defined on the plane is the Euclidean metric.
* Given two cities in a country with many hills and valleys, find the shortest road going from one city to the other. This problem is a generalization of the above, and the solution is not as obvious.
* Given two circles which will serve as top and bottom for a cup of given height, find the shape of the side wall of the cup so that the side wall has minimal area. The intuition would suggest that the cup must have conical or cylindrical shape, which is false. The actual minimum surface is the catenoid.
* Find the shape of a bridge capable of sustaining given amount of traffic using the smallest amount of material.
* Find the shape of an airplane which bounces away most of the radio waves from an enemy radar.

Infinite-dimensional optimization problems can be more challenging than finite-dimensional ones. Typically one needs to employ methods from partial differential equations to solve such problems.

Several disciplines which study infinite-dimensional optimization problems are calculus of variations, optimal control and shape optimization.

<text>HMCS &quot;Glace Bay&quot; is a that has served in the Canadian Forces and Royal Canadian Navy since 1996. &quot;Glace Bay&quot; is the second ship of her class which is the name for the Maritime Coastal Defence Vessel Project. She is the second vessel to use the designation . She is assigned to Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT) and is homeported at CFB Halifax.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Kingston&quot; class was designed to fill the minesweeper, coastal patrol and reserve training needs of the Canadian Forces, replacing the s, s and Royal Canadian Mounted Police coastal launches in those roles. In order to perform these varied duties the &quot;Kingston&quot;-class vessels are designed to carry up to three ISO containers with power hookups on the open deck aft in order to embark mission-specific payloads. The seven module types available for embarkation include four route survey, two mechanical minesweeping and one bottom inspection modules.

The &quot;Kingston&quot; class displace and are long overall with a beam and a draught of . The coastal defence vessels are powered by four Jeumont ANR-53-50 alternators coupled to four Wärtsilä UD 23V12 diesel engines creating . Two LIPS Z-drive azimuth thrusters are driven by two Jeumont CI 560L motors creating and the Z drives can be rotated 360°. This gives the ships a maximum speed of and a range of at .

The &quot;Kingston&quot; class is equipped with a Kelvin Hughes navigational radar using the I band and a Kelvin Hughes 6000 surface search radar scanning the E and F bands. The vessels carry an AN/SQS-511 towed side scan sonar for minesweeping and a Remote-control Mine Hunting System (RMHS). The vessels are equipped with one Bofors 40 mm/60 calibre Mk 5C gun and two M2 machine guns. The 40 mm gun was declared obsolete and removed from the vessels in 2014. Some of them ended up as museum pieces and on display at naval reserve installations across Canada. The &quot;Kingston&quot;-class coastal defence vessels have a complement of 37.

==Service history==
The ship&#x27;s keel was laid down on 28 April 1995 by Halifax Shipyards Ltd. at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and was launched on 22 January 1996. &quot;Glace Bay&quot; was commissioned into the Canadian Forces at Sydney, Nova Scotia, on 26 October 1996 and carries the hull number MM 701. In 1997, the coastal defence vessel deployed to the Great Lakes. Following the crash of Swissair Flight 111, &quot;Glace Bay&quot; was among the vessels sent to search for the downed aircraft in September 1998. The following year, she was sent to the Baltic Sea to participate in minesweeping exercises with NATO.

In November 2009, the Canadian trials for the Boeing Insitu ScanEagle unmanned aircraft system were performed aboard &quot;Glace Bay&quot;.

In June 2013, &quot;Glace Bay&quot; and sister ship were sent on a seven-week tour of the Saint Lawrence Seaway and the Great Lakes, making several port calls along the way. In 2014, she was deployed to serve in Operation Caribbe. During the ship&#x27;s deployment, in collaboration with the United States Coast Guard, the vessel seized a large shipment of cocaine valued at $84 million. In October 2018, &quot;Glace Bay&quot; was among the Canadian ships deployed to the North Atlantic and Baltic Sea as part of the large NATO exercise, Trident Juncture. On 17 December 2018 and &quot;Glace Bay&quot; were sailing home to Halifax from their deployment in European waters when they were called to the aid of the sailing vessel &quot;Makena&quot; which had been disabled southeast of Halifax. &quot;Summerside&quot; and &quot;Glace Bay&quot; took part in the rescue of the four crew members of &quot;Makena&quot; by a Royal Canadian Air Force Cormorant helicopter, with additional support by a United States C-130 Hercules aircraft.

On 26 January 2020, &quot;Glace Bay&quot; and departed Halifax as part of Operation Projection off West Africa. Once there, the two vessels were to take part in two naval exercises Obangame Express and Phoenix Express. They were recalled in March during the COVID-19 pandemic after their exercises were cancelled. They returned to Halifax on 9 April. In August 2020, &quot;Glace Bay&quot; was deployed to the Arctic as part of Operation Nanook along with and from the Royal Canadian Navy and warships from the Danish, French, U.S. navies.

In January 2023, &quot;Glace Bay&quot; and sister ship sailed from Halifax for operations off West Africa in the Gulf of Guinea, participating in several exercises and diplomatic engagements in the area. However, with the situation in Haiti worsening, the Canadian government redeployed the two ships to the seas off that nation&#x27;s capital Port-au-Prince for patrols in February. In June 2023, &quot;Glace Bay&quot; was part of a fleet of vessels that took part in the search for the submersible &quot;Titan&quot; which went missing near the wreck of &quot;Titanic&quot;.

<doc id="1300953" wikidata="Q335120" url="?curid=1300953" title="Eric Drummond, 7th Earl of Perth">
<text>James Eric Drummond, 7th Earl of Perth, (17 August 1876 – 15 December 1951), was a British politician and diplomat who was the first Secretary-General of the League of Nations from 1920 to 1933.

Quiet and unassuming, he succeeded in building an effective international staff. However he failed to resolve major international disputes because of pressure from Britain and France, the most powerful League members. He moved on to become British Ambassador to Italy (1933–1939) and then the chief adviser on foreign publicity in the Ministry of Information (1939–1940). In 1946, he became deputy leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Lords.

==Early life and career==

===Family===
Drummond was born into the Scottish nobility, the Chiefs of Clan Drummond. His father was James David Drummond, 10th Viscount Strathallan (1839–1893), an army officer of Machany in Perthshire who had three children with his second wife, Margaret Smythe, the daughter of William Smythe of Methven Castle in Perthshire. James Eric Drummond was the eldest and the only son but Drummond had two half-sisters and one half-brother, William Huntley Drummond, from his father&#x27;s first marriage to Ellen Thornhill. Drummond&#x27;s brother William succeeded their father as Viscount Strathallan in 1893 and, in 1902, succeeded their distant cousin, George Drummond, 5th Earl of Perth, to become the 6th Earl of Perth.

On 20 August 1937 Drummond&#x27;s half-brother died and so Drummond became the 7th Earl of Perth and inherited these titles: Lord Drummond of Cargill and Stobhall, Lord Maderty, 12th Viscount Strathallan, Lord Drummond of Cromlix, Hereditary thegn of Lennox, Hereditary Steward of Menteith and Strathearn and Chief of Clan Drummond.

He was raised in a Presbyterian family but converted to Catholicism in 1903. That became a hindrance during his career when Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald vetoed his appointment as ambassador at Washington in 1933. His conversion was most likely caused by his wish to marry a Catholic, the Hon. Angela Mary Constable-Maxwell (1877–1965), the daughter of Marmaduke Constable-Maxwell, 11th Lord Herries of Terregles and Hon. Angela Mary Charlotte Fitzalan-Howard (daughter of the 1st Baron Howard of Glossop), which he did on 20 April 1904. They had four children: 
* Lady Margaret Gwendolyn Mary (1905)
* John David Drummond, Viscount Strathallan (1907), inherited his father&#x27;s titles
* Lady Angela Alice Maryel Drummond (1912) 
* Lady Gillian Mary Drummond (1920).

===Education and early career===
Drummond was educated at Eton College, where he graduated in 1895. There, he learned French, which later would become an important tool in his diplomatic career. His upbringing in the British establishment helped to pave the way into the diplomatic world as a civil servant.

Drummond is best known for his 13 years as secretary-general in the League of Nations. Before accepting that prestigious position, however, he had served mainly as a private secretary for various British politicians and diplomats, including the Prime Minister H. H. Asquith.

On 20 April 1900, Drummond entered the British Foreign Office as a clerk.

From 1906 to 1908, he was the private secretary of the under-secretary to Lord Fitzmaurice. Between 1908 and 1910, he occupied two functions: précis writer of the foreign secretary Sir Edward Grey and the private secretary of the parliamentary under-secretary, Thomas McKinnon Wood. From 1912 to 1918, Drummond worked as the private secretary of respectively: the prime minister, H. H. Asquith, and the foreign secretaries, Sir Edward Grey and Arthur Balfour. In April to May 1917 he was a member of the Balfour Mission, which was intended to promote cooperation between the British and the Americans during the First World War.

==League of Nations career==
Between 1918 and 1919, he was a member of the British delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, where he was engaged in the drafting of the Covenant of the League of Nations.

In 1919 he accepted the position of the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, on the recommendation of Lord Robert Cecil.

Before the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 much work had been put into finding a suitable candidate for secretary-general of the newly established League of Nations.

Cecil, who played an important role in drafting the Covenant and organising the League, initially wanted a person with a background in politics for the post; but despite the existence of several candidates, none accepted his proposal. He believed that only somebody of the highest ability would be sufficient for this role. However, after the office would not be given as many powers as initially thought, Cecil reconsidered and sought to find somebody who was a well-trained civil servant and less known as a big political figure. He first approached Maurice Hankey, who for some time showed interest in the position but in the end rejected the offer only ten days prior to the Paris plenary session. In the event that Hankey would turn down the offer, Cecil and the American Edward M. House had developed a contingency plan to substitute Hankey with Sir Eric Drummond.

As early as 1915, Drummond expressed himself favourably towards the establishment of an international organisation. As such, Drummond was involved in negotiations regarding the establishment of the League of Nations. In addition, he was also a British national, which Cecil valued very highly. Drummond was an experienced diplomat and had earned a high reputation during his 19 years at the Foreign Office, which helped him to be considered the best choice available.
After some initial doubt in which Drummond expressed anxiety about organising the League, he finally accepted the proposal. At the Paris Peace Conference&#x27;s plenary session on 28 April 1919, the conference accepted the appointment of Drummond as the first secretary-general of the League of Nations.

===Establishment of permanent secretariat (1919–1920)===

One of the secretary-general&#x27;s major deeds was the establishment of a permanent and strictly-international secretariat. No such thing had ever been attempted, and prewar secretariats had largely been confined to the national sphere in both the context of who supplied them and the civil servants who worked there. The creation of an international civil service was not without problems, and administrative leaders thought it unthinkable that such a body would ever be united, loyal or efficient. By August 1920 the secretariat was fully established.

The personnel staffing the secretariat came from over 30 countries and differed in language, religion and training, all of whom were appointed by the League, not by national governments. That once again underscored the difference between the new international body and previous national secretariats. In total, the secretariat came to consist of seven sections: a Mandate Section, an Economic and Financial Section, a Section for Transit and Communication, a Social Section, a Political Section, a Legal Section and an International Bureau Section.

In establishing the permanent secretariat, Drummond pushed back against ideas (promulgated by Sir Maurice Hankey) that great powers would bring their own national staff to the secretariat. Drummond wanted the secretariat to hire staff who owed their allegiance to the League.

===Leadership style===
Drummond approached the role conservatively. His somewhat-subdued role in the British Foreign Office easily transferred over to the position of secretary-general. He was not a major political figure and so did not seek to turn the office into a reflection of his personality.

Drummond set about creating the administrative divisions for the League. He took no risk in his appointments to senior positions in the League of Nations and chose to appoint only members who supported their nation&#x27;s government and gave the positions only to members of leading states.

Drummond was regarded as taking great care with issues and taking his position very seriously. He would read everything that came to his desk and would often call meetings regularly to discuss various issues. The meetings would often take place with various members of governments, which managed to established contact by his appointments to the League. Drummond thus became aware of sensitive information from various governments and nongovernmental organisations but became someone who could be trusted by various politicians worldwide.

He was widely regarded as shying away from the public and political spotlight, despite the high-profile nature of his position. He, however, was believed to be highly political behind the scenes but was often forced to do to appease various nations and because of often lacking support from many governments. One example was his 1920s dealings with Benito Mussolini&#x27;s policies towards the Balkans, Africa and Europe. Drummond was unable to condemn any of Mussolini&#x27;s policies publicly, as he did not have the backing of Britain and France. He wanted to maintain good relations with Italy, which helped to render him somewhat impotent.

Drummond had to perform his function behind the scenes of the League of Nations. He took great care to maintain world peace, as was hoped during the creation of the League, but he also appeased nations, rather than keeping them in check against international law. Despite the limitations coming from outside the League, he largely decided how he would run the office since he was very seldom under any kind of supervision. Drummond became regarded as a central hub within the League of Nations for most issues, and he would often pick the ones that interested him the most and delegate the lesser issues to his staff. He could thus be regarded as a leader who used the office for his own political interests.

During his tenure as League Secretary General, Drummond helped to suppress anticolonial claims by indigenous groups.

===National allegiance of League staff===
The ideal underpinning the secretariat and those working there was one much resembling a Weberian understanding of bureaucracy that was also seen in Protestant-secular rationalism, the idea of a non-political, neutral, effective and efficient bureaucrat. Drummond admitted, &quot;It is not always those who secure public praise to whom thanks are mainly due, and the work unknown to the public which is done behind the scenes is often a large factor in the success which has been obtained&quot;.

The ideal was not always upheld, and national preferences were never really abandoned. New under-secretaries-general who were appointed were more often than not of the same nationality, with candidates of smaller powers excluded. Drummond did not practice what he preached, which created small national islands from which the appointed officials conducted national, rather than international, politics.

In 1929, the Assembly decided to make a thorough investigation of the secretariats, the International Labour Organization and the Permanent Court of International Justice. The minority report showed that the political influence in substantive issues by the secretariats and its main officers was enormous and could not be overlooked. However, that was not recognised by Drummond before the 1950s and until then had readily defended the notion of nonpolitical character of international secretariats.

Despite the political character of the international civil service, the Secretariat came to be widely recognised as an instrument of the highest efficiency and the structural framework became a model for future international civil services, such as seen in the United Nations.

===Role during crises===
During Drummond&#x27;s secretary-generalship were several crises that called for his attention. The League of Nations&#x27; Council relied on the willingness of its members to use their militaries to apply its collective security mandate during crises. Many of them centred on border disputes from the collapse of empires after the First World War. As the League got involved in such matters throughout the 1920s with members and non-members alike, Drummond was at the centre of the talks and the negotiations. The League was involved in disputes in Latin America, the Baltics and then China. Peter Yearwood argues that although Drummond was an idealist, as were most other people, he also &#x27;made use&#x27; of his connections in politics. Drummond was widely regarded as somebody who shied away from the public and political limelight, despite the high-profile nature of his position. He managed to achieve that but was believed to be highly political behind the scenes. He was often forced to appease various nations because he often lacked support from governments.

One example was his dealings with Benito Mussolini&#x27;s policies in the 1920s towards the Balkans, Africa and the rest of Europe. Drummond was unable to give a public condemnation of Mussolini&#x27;s policies, as he had the backing of neither Britain nor France and wanted to maintain good relations with Italy. That was one of the many reasons that helped to render him a somewhat-impotent leader.

Drummond had to perform his function behind the scenes of the League of Nations. He took great care to maintain world peace, as was hoped during the creation of the League of Nations, but he appeased nations, rather than keep them in check against international law. Despite the limitations coming from outside the League of Nations, he largely decided how he would run the office within it since he was very seldom under any kind of supervision. He became regarded as a central hub within the League of Nations for most issues and would often pick the ones that interested him the most and delegate the lesser issues to his staff. He could thus be regarded as a leader who used the office for his own political interests.

Another issue that partly drove Drummond&#x27;s ambitions and his way of handling the crises presented before him was his religion. A devout Catholic, that had a significant impact in his dealings with the Polish–Lithuanian War early in his career. He strongly urged for a plebiscite to which Poland could agree, most Poles being Catholic. Aldo, Drummond seemed to be pro-active. On the crisis between Russia and Finland over the latter&#x27;s independence gained after the First World War, Drummond was one of the first to consider a possible solution.

Another important factor of his secretary-generalship was his willingness to step beyond the boundaries given to him in his position. During the crisis over the Chaco War near the very end of Drummond&#x27;s career at the League, he was praised for being a helpful mediator and for doing more than his position allowed.

===Mukden Incident===

One of the less successful moments for Drummond&#x27;s was one of the most prominent crises of Drummond&#x27;s career, the Mukden Incident. China allegedly blew up part of a railroad, which Japan then used as an excuse to invade Manchuria. China appealed to the League for measures against Japan.

According to Michael E. Chapman, Drummond&#x27;s initial response was not that of an imperialistic western leader but that of a bureaucrat. Somewhat limited in his powers, he looked towards the two most powerful Western nations in the region, Britain and the United States, which more or less stated that they were &#x27;too busy&#x27; to deal with the crisis at hand.

When the crisis reached its peak, Stimson advised Drummond to &quot;strengthen and support treaty obligations&quot; the Japanese action had caused British discomfort. He was advised to try not to arouse nationalist feelings in Japan. Drummond wanted to be an active player in the crisis but was mostly outplayed by Henry Stimson and Hugh R. Wilson.

He resigned in 1933 and was succeeded by his deputy Joseph Avenol, from France.

==British ambassador in Rome (1933–1939)==
After leaving the League, Drummond was chosen as candidate to the post of British ambassador to Washington, but his candidacy was vetoed by British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, allegedly because Drummond had converted to Roman Catholicism at 27. Instead, he was appointed British ambassador to Rome in October 1933 and he served there until he left Italy in April 1939. He retired from foreign politics a month later, in May 1939.

Throughout his time in Rome, Drummond found it &quot;difficult to get close to Mussolini&quot;. He noted that &quot;[Mussolini]... had to be treated with great caution when he [was] in &#x27;a highly sensitive condition&#x27;&quot;

The Italian foreign minister, Galeazzo Ciano, thought that Perth, as he had now become, was convinced that the harsh attitude of France towards Italy was unreasonable. Furthermore, Perth tried to convince the Italians that the British government was &quot;conciliatory&quot; and even went so far as &quot;[...defending] Italian policy.&quot; Ciano, whose Italian secret service efficiency allowed him to read many of Perth&#x27;s reports, states in his diary that the British ambassador had been opposed to the fascist regime when he came to Rome but had developed into a &quot;sincere convert&quot; who &quot;understood and even loved Fascism&quot;. Caution must always be employed in using Ciano&#x27;s statements, but Perth&#x27;s reports suggested that there was a certain amount of truth in the remarks:

Piers Brendon, who describes Drummond as &quot;peculiarly obtuse even by diplomatic standards&quot;, points out that as late as February 1935 he was assuring the Foreign Office that the Italians had &quot;no aggressive intentions&quot; but were &quot;genuinely afraid of overwhelming Abyssinian attack&quot;. The Foreign Office was to rebuke him for his feebleness due to his meek protest following the Italian invasion on Ethiopia.

:&quot;Perth may have misjudged Mussolini&#x27;s attitude to Germany but, in the last analysis, even here he was not far wrong, for the limitations of Italian power made it impossible for Mussolini, in 1939, to carry out his intention of siding with Germany in the war&quot;.

==Second World War and domestic politics (1939–1951)==
During the Second World War, Perth worked for the Ministry of Information as a senior bureaucrat. After the war, he served until his death as a deputy leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Lords. His involvement with the party did not slow its decline in electoral and ideological influence.

==Legacy==
In regards to the security role of the League, his role could be assessed as negligible, especially for the second half of his tenureship, which was characterised by the systematic undermining competition of the great powers, notably Britain and France and the security structure impaired by 19th-century imperialism of the League: its council. His pragmatic and co-operative approach resulted in some successes in the early years of the League, but his role is considered inadequate when it was confronted with issues such as the Manchurian Crisis.

His involvement in setting the organizational infrastructure in areas such as the dealing with refugees, the minority regime and the mandate system could be seen more positively since during his time, especially during the first half of the 1920s, had some successes in resolving and tackling issues, such as the 1925 Greek–Bulgarian Conflict in 1925 and the 1932–1933 Colombia–Peru War.

However, it was the technical issues, such as humanitarian aid and the supervision of a series of &quot;technical organizations and committees&quot;, in which he had the most enduring positive legacy. Drummond was part of an international technocratic elite of experts that favoured the initiation of international standards in health and labour issues, the gathering and the sharing of statistical information and a spirit of internationalism to deal with problems.

After his post at the League, he was assigned to the post of ambassador to Fascist Italy. A combination of his own restricted ability to see the overall situation and Britain&#x27;s strategy of appeasement of fascist regimes that he served could account as a failure and quite possibly the darkest period of his career. The non-resolution of the Ethiopian Crisis had the effects of undermining League&#x27;s security role and sending the wrong signals to both Mussolini and Hitler. Drummond, as the British ambassador to Italy, was one of the actors who failed to anticipate the negative results of the British appeasement policy. According to Gordon Craig and Felix Gilbert &quot;His handling of the political tasks of the League [of Nations] has been criticized as over cautious, but he did not lack courage for decisive action when such action was necessary for the maintenance of the authority of the League. His slow somewhat hesitant approach was useful in avoiding disappointments and setbacks and contributed to the League&#x27;s steady gain in prestige.&quot;

Susan Pederson described Drummond as &quot;highly organized, meticulous, good at selecting staff)... and able to mediate disputes.&quot;

<doc id="1300955" wikidata="Q706079" url="?curid=1300955" title="Artamon Matveyev">
<text>Artamon Sergeyevich Matveyev (; – ) was a Russian statesman, diplomat and reformer. He served as the head (&quot;dyak&quot;) of the foreign ministry (&quot;Posolsky prikaz&quot;) from 1671 to 1676 during the reign of Alexis of Russia, succeeding Afanasy Ordin-Nashchokin.

==Biography==
Because his father, Sergey Matveyev, was a notable diplomat, Artamon Matveyev was brought up at the royal court since the age of 13, where he would become close friends with Alexius I. Matveyev started his career as a government official, who worked in Ukraine and took part in some of Russia&#x27;s wars with Poland. He was a member of the Russian delegation at the conclusion of the Treaty of Pereyaslav in 1654 and Russian diplomatic mission to Poland in 1656–1657. As the head of the &quot;Streletsky prikaz&quot;, Matveyev participated in suppression of the Copper Riot in 1662. Seven years later, he was put in charge of the &quot;Malorossiysky prikaz&quot;, and in 1671, the head of the &quot;Posolsky prikaz&quot; (foreign ministry) and other ministries. Matveyev was known to have considered unification of Ukraine and Russia as the most important issue of the Russian foreign policy. He once said that it was even possible to temporarily forget about the struggle with the Swedes for the Baltic Sea for the sake of unification with Ukraine. In 1672, Matveyev managed to secure Kiev for Russia during the talks with Poland.

After Matveev had become head of the Little Russian Chancellery in 1669 and after the death of the tsar&#x27;s first consort Maria Miloslavskaya, tsar Alexis visited the house of Matveev to meet prospective brides. Here Alexis also met Natalia Naryshkina, whom he married on 22 January 1671. Matveev had &#x27;sponsored&#x27; several young ladies at his house, including Natalia. She was put forward due to her family connections as her brothers were subordinant officers in Matveev&#x27;s musketeer regiments. At the end of the year Matveyev was raised to the rank of &quot;okolnichy&quot;, and on 1 September 1674 attained the still higher dignity of boyar. The deplorable physical condition of Alexius&#x27;s immediate successor, Feodor III, suggested to Matveyev the desirability of elevating to the throne the sturdy little tsarevich Peter, then in his fourth year. He purchased the allegiance of the &quot;Streltsy&quot; and then, summoning the boyars of the council, earnestly represented to them that Feodor was unable to reign and urged the substitution of little Peter. But the reactionary boyars, among whom were the near kinsmen of Feodor, proclaimed him tsar and Matveyev was banished to Pustozyorsk, where he remained until Feodor&#x27;s death on 7 May 1682. Immediately afterwards Peter was proclaimed tsar by Patriarch Joachim, and the first &quot;ukaz&quot; issued in Peter&#x27;s name summoned Matveyev to return to the capital and act as chief adviser to the tsaritsa Natalia. Matveyev came to Moscow on 11 May, and four days later had to meet with the rebellious &quot;Streltsy&quot;, who had been instigated to rebel by the anti-Petrine faction. He had already succeeded in partially pacifying them, when one of their colonels began to abuse the still hesitating and suspicious musketeers. Infuriated, they seized Matveyev and hacked him to pieces.

Matveyev was a very educated and versatile individual for his time. He organized a publishing house on the premises of the &quot;Posolsky Prikaz&quot; and compiled the so-called &quot;Tsarsky titulyarnik&quot; (Царский титулярник), an illustrated reference book about titles of the Russian tsar and foreign rulers, with some information on Russian history, pictures of different coats of arms, stamps, monarchs and patriarchs. Matveyev was also a collector of rare books and had a huge library. He decorated his house with pieces of fine art, optical devices and models of different ships. Matveyev was the one to introduce theater to the court by organizing a group of actors guided by George Hüfner who staged various plays. He was also one of the organizers of the first apothecary in Moscow. His son Andrey Matveev was made a count and served as the first President of Justice Collegium.

The city of Baranavichy is not only one of the largest cities of Belarus in terms of population (eighth largest in the country) but also one of the most important industrial, cultural, and educational centers of Belarus.

At the beginning of 2010, Baranavichy had 21 sister cities, including Russian Mytishchi (Moscow Oblast), Vasileostrovsky district of St. Petersburg, Finnish Heinola, Austrian Stockerau, Polish Biala Podlaska, Gdynia, Sulentsin povet, Chinese Chibi, Italian Ferrara, Latvian Jelgava, Ukrainian Poltava, Novovolynsk and others.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
In the second half of the 17th century, Baranavichy housed the Jesuit mission. In the second half of the 18th century, Baranavichy was the property of Massalski and Niesiołowski families. The village was administratively part of the Nowogródek Voivodeship until the Third Partition of Poland (1795) when it was annexed by Imperial Russia. In the 19th century, it belonged to the Countess E.A. Rozwadowski. It was part of the Novogrodek (now Navahrudak) okrug, which was part of Slonim Governorate, the Lithuania Governorate, the Grodno Governorate and then the Minsk Governorate.

=== Growth ===

The town&#x27;s history began on 17 (29) November 1871, the beginning of construction of a movement to the new section of the Smolensk-Brest. The name of the station arose during the construction of the nearby village, Baranavichy, whose first mention was in the testament of A.E Sinyavskaya in 1627. Then, in 1871, not far from the station, the locomotive depot was built.

In 1874 came the appearance of the railway junction. In the wooden station buildings lived the railway workers of Baranavichy. The new railway linked Moscow with the western outskirts of Imperial Russia.

The impetus for more intensive settlement of the areas adjacent to the station from the south was the 27 May 1884 decision by the governor of Minsk to build a town, Rozvadovo, on the lands of the landlord, Rozwadowski. The town was built according to the governor&#x27;s approved plan. In the village were 120 houses and 500 people.

The plans approved by Emperor Alexander III assumed that there would also be one railway linking Vilnius, Luninets, Pinsk, and Rovno. Therefore, 2.5 km from the station, the Moscow-Brest railway crossed the track Vilnius-Rovno from Polesie railways. At the junction was another station, Baranavichy (according to Polesie Railways), which became the second centre of the city.

As before, workers and traders settled near the station. The new settlement was called New Baranavichy, unlike Rozvadovo, which became informally called Old Baranavichy. It was developed on the land owned by peasants of the villages near the new station (Svetilovichi, Gierow and Uznogi). More convenient than the landlords&#x27; land, its lease terms and proximity to administrative agencies contributed to the rapid growth of this settlement.

=== 20th century ===
At the beginning of World War I, Baranavichy was the location for the Stavka, the headquarters of the Russian General Staff, until the Great Retreat.
After the settlement was left by the Germans, it was captured on 5 January 1919, by the Soviets. In the early stages of the Polish–Soviet War, it was briefly captured by the Poles on 18 March 1919 and again captured, for longer, in April 1919, five months after Poland regained independence. The Russians retook it on 17 July 1920, but the Poles took it again on 30 September 1920.
On 1 August 1919, it received city rights and became a powiat centre in the Polish Nowogródek Voivodeship. According to the 1921 census, the city had a population of 11,471, 56.2% Jewish, 25.5% Polish, 16.6% Belarusian and 1.5% Russian. Soon, the city started to grow and became an important centre of trade and commerce for the area. The city&#x27;s Orthodox cathedral was built in the Neoclassical style in 1924 to 1931 and was decorated with mosaics that had survived the demolition of the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Warsaw. In 1930, a monument to Hungarian Lieutenant colonel Artur Buol, a hero of Polish fights in the Polish–Soviet War, was unveiled in Baranowicze. In the interbellum, the grandparents and the father of Polish politicians Lech Kaczyński and Jarosław Kaczyński lived in Baranowicze.

The city was also an important military garrison, with a KOP Cavalry Brigade, the 20th Infantry Division and the Nowogródzka Cavalry Brigade stationed there. Because of the fast growth of local industry, a local branch of the Polish Radio was opened in 1938. In 1939 Baranavichy had almost 30,000 inhabitants and was the biggest and the most important city in the Nowogródek Voivodeship.

After the invasion of Poland, the Soviet Union took the city on 17 September 1939 and annexed it to the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. The local Jewish population of 9,000 was joined by approximately 3,000 Jewish refugees from the Polish areas occupied by Germany. After the start of Operation Barbarossa, the city was seized by the Wehrmacht on 27 June 1941. It was part of &quot;Generalbezirk Weißruthenien&quot; in Reichskommissariat Ostland during the German occupation. In August 1941, the Baranavichy Ghetto was created in the city, with more than 12,000 Jews kept in terrible conditions in six buildings on the outskirts. From 4 March to 14 December 1942, the entire Jewish population of the ghetto was sent to various extermination camps and killed in gas chambers. Only about 250 survived the war. Hugo Armann, head of a unit that arranged travel for soldiers and security police, saved six people from a murder squad and another 35 to 40 people who worked for him.

The city was liberated by the Red Army on 8 July 1944. It was also the seat of the Baranavichy Voblast from 1939 to 1941 and again from 1944 to 1954. Meanwhile, intensive industrialization took place. In 1991, the city became part of independent Belarus.

== Sights ==
As a fairly young city, Baranavichy does not have many cultural heritage monuments. Most are buildings erected in the interwar period, including the Catholic Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, the former Bank of Poland building, the building of the Polish Radio Baranowicze station, the fire station and the Orthodox Church of the Protection of the Holy Virgin. A few old houses from the early 20th century are preserved. There is a railway museum in the city.
== Transport ==

The city is on the main east–west highway in Belarus, the M1, which forms a part of European route E30.

The first rail line through the city opened in around 1870. Additional railways built helped the city become an important rail junction.

The large airbase, south of the city, is used by the Belarusian Air Force.

<doc id="1300961" wikidata="Q7293428" url="?curid=1300961" title="Ranpirnase">
<text>Ranpirnase is a ribonuclease enzyme found in the oocytes of the Northern Leopard Frog (&quot;Rana pipiens&quot;). Ranpirnase is a member of the pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase A) protein superfamily and degrades RNA substrates with a sequence preference for uracil and guanine nucleotides. Along with amphinase, another leopard frog ribonuclease, Ranpirnase has been studied as a potential cancer and antiviral treatment due to its unusual mechanism of cytotoxicity tested against transformed cells and antiviral activity.

Ranpirnase was originally discovered by scientists at TamirBio, a biotechnology company (formerly Alfacell Corporation), where it was tested in preclinical assays and in clinical trials under the name &quot;Pannon&quot; or &quot;Onconase&quot;, and &quot;TMR004&quot;. The mechanism of action of ranpirnase has been attributed to the RNA interference pathway, potentially through cleaving siRNA molecules; to cleavage of transfer RNA; and to interference with the NF-κB pathway. Currently (as of March 2020) Ranpirnase is in clinical trials as a potential antiviral.

== EC number ==
The EC system, or enzyme classification system was created to both standardize enzyme names, as well as allow for association of enzyme reaction type and function.  The EC number for Ranpirnase is EC 4.6.1.18, but was previously EC 3.1.27.5.  This means that ranpirnase is in class 4, subclass 6, sub-subclass 1, and serial #18.  Class 4 are considered lyases, while subclass 4.6.1 further classifies the enzyme as a phosphorus-oxygen lyase.  Ultimately, ranpirnase can be classified as a pancreatic ribonuclease.  

== Reaction pathway ==
The reaction pathway of ranpirnase is initiated by the enzyme adhering to the surface of the targeted cell.  Ranpirnase then penetrates and enters the cell through energy-dependent endocytosis.  Once in the cell, ranpirnase is directed via the Golgi apparatus to the cytosol, where the enzyme then can selectively break down tRNA, while ignoring rRNA and mRNA.  Ranpirnase degrades tRNA by facilitating the cleavage of the P-O5’ bond found in RNA, specifically on the 3’ side of pyrimidine nucleosides.  As a result of this RNA degradation process, protein synthesis is hindered.  This inhibition of protein synthesis contributes to the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of ranpirnase.

== Structure ==
Ranpirnase is found in the oocytes of &quot;Rana pipiens, also known as the Northern leopard frog.  These oocytes have two similar variations of pancreatic ribonuclease A, which both&quot; exhibit cytostatic and cytotoxic properties. Ranpirnase contains 104 amino acid residues, making it the smallest identified member of the RNase A superfamily.  Overall, ranpirnase is considered small single chain protein that has a molecular weight around 12,000 Da.  Once ranpirnase was isolated from the oocytes, it was discovered that ranpirnase is polymorphic at amino acid position 25.  Specifically, this position has historically been occupied by Thr amino acids, but Ser amino acids have also been identified.  This replacement, however, does not appear to change the function of the enzyme.  Additionally, ranpirnase contains 4 disulfide bonds that give the enzyme high heat stability.

== Function ==
Once in the cell, ranpirnase plays both a cytostatic and cytotoxic role.  Cytostatically, ranpirnase halts the cell cycle in G1, but simultaneously acts as a cytotoxin.  There is evidence indicating that the damage caused to tRNA is irreversible and can serve as a pro-apoptotic signal, however this appears to be dependent on additional enzymes that assist in programmed cell death.  Ranpirnase appears to be most active and effective against tumor cells compared to normal cells.  Within these tumor cells, ranpirnase activates a signal-transduction pathway called stress-activated protein kinase or SAPK.  SAPK1 contains JNK-1 and -2 alleles that are targeted and disturbed by ranpirnase.  These JNKs play a significant role as moderators of the cytotoxic effects induced by ranpirnase.  Ultimately, ranpirnase appears to be more apoptotic in cancer cells due to the induction of multiple pro-apoptotic pathways.

== Known crystal structures ==
The crystal structure of ranpirnase contains a segment that encompasses the beginning of a helix.  This is where the main chain assumes a strained conformation leading to noticeable deviations from planarity within the peptide bonds of this enzyme.  Specifically, the peptide bonds of Ser39, Arg40, and Pro41 experience ω dihedral angles of 160.0, 192.1, and 193.5°, respectively.  The orientations of the side chains of Arg40 and Glu42 are clearly defined, and Arg40&#x27;s guanidino group aligns itself with a sulfate ion.

== Known active sites ==
Ranpirnase&#x27;s active site encompasses a catalytic triad that commonly found in the RNase A superfamily.  This catalytic triad consists of His10, Lys31, and His97.  In addition to the common catalytic triad, ranpirnase has two extra active-site residues: Lys9 and an N-terminal pyroglutamate residue.  These additional active sites are created within the endoplasmic reticulum through the co-translational cyclization of its encoded glutamine.

== Structure tied to function ==
The structure of ranpirnase does appear to have an impact on its function.  Specifically, studies suggest that ranpirnase uses Coulombic interactions as well as a hydrogen bonding system to adjust substrate specificity. Additionally, it has been seen that intentional changes in amino acid replacements can also modify substrate specificity.  Studies have also investigated the structural characteristics that underlie the reduced catalytic activity of ranpirnase.  This decreased catalytic activity is associated with low affinity for substrate.  A solution to this appears to be undergoing T5R substitution.  A T5R substitution is engineered to establish a successful Coulombic interaction between ranpirnase and a phosphoryl group in RNA.  This then resulted in a twofold enhancement of ribonucleolytic activity.

<text>Crown attorneys or crown counsel () or, in Alberta and New Brunswick, crown prosecutors are the prosecutors in the legal system of Canada.

Crown attorneys represent the Crown and act as prosecutor in proceedings under the Criminal Code and various other statutes. Criminal prosecutions pursuant to federal statutes other than the Criminal Code, such as the &quot;Controlled Drugs and Substances Act&quot;, the &quot;Income Tax Act&quot;, and others, are generally (but not exclusively) conducted by the Public Prosecution Service of Canada, which also handles most narcotic case outside of Quebec and New Brunswick. There are similarities between this role and the procurator fiscal in Scotland, crown prosecutor in England and Wales and United States Attorney or district attorney in the United States. Crown attorneys are not elected. They are civil servants and may be removed from their positions pursuant to their employment agreements.

Although the enactment of criminal law is under federal jurisdiction in Canada, the prosecution of most Criminal Code offences—outside of Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut—is the responsibility of the provincial Attorneys General and their lawful deputies by virtue of the &quot;interpretation&quot; section of the Criminal Code. As a result, the vast majority of crown attorneys are employed by Canada&#x27;s ten provinces.

Lawyers who act on civil or administrative matters for the provincial Crown are not referred to as crown attorneys (Senior General Counsel, general counsel), or simply crown counsel although both criminal and civil attorneys generally report to the provincial Attorney-General&#x27;s office. Lawyers who work for the Federal Ministry of Justice are often referred to as Crowns even if acting in civil matters. Moreover, lawyers, students-at-law and other persons who only represent the Crown on provincial offences matters (such as municipal by-law enforcement and traffic offences) are referred to as &quot;provincial prosecutors&quot; or &quot;provincial offences attorneys&quot; (POAs) rather than crown attorneys. Regardless of whether the prosecuted matter is a criminal offence or a provincial offence, crown Attorneys represent and argue on behalf of the Crown. In the province of Ontario, there is only one crown attorney appointed by the Attorney General per judicial district. The crown attorney is charged with supervising the office at the local level, and has a level of autonomy from the Attorney General&#x27;s office. A crown attorney will then, in consultation with the Attorney General&#x27;s office, hire &quot;assistant crown attorneys&quot; to further staff the office and prosecute offences. In this respect, Ontario functions similar to the US system of district attorneys and assistant district attorneys, although within the aspects of the Canadian legal system.

As crown attorneys are not elected, the Canadian prosecutorial system is often seen as less politically motivated than other systems.

<doc id="1300967" wikidata="Q1276739" url="?curid=1300967" title="Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina">
<text>Islam is the most widespread religion in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was introduced to the local population in the 15th and 16th centuries as a result of the Ottoman conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Muslims make the largest religious community in Bosnia and Herzegovina (51.3%) (the other two large groups being Eastern Orthodox Christians (30.7%), almost all of whom identify as Serbs, and Roman Catholics (15.4%), almost all of whom identify as Croats).

Almost all of Bosnian Muslims identify as Bosniaks; until 1993, Bosnians of Muslim culture or origin (regardless of religious practice) were defined by Yugoslav authorities as &quot;Muslimani&quot; (Muslims) in an ethno-national sense (hence the capital M), though some people of Bosniak or Muslim backgrounds identified their nationality (in an ethnic sense rather than strictly in terms of citizenship) as &quot;Yugoslav&quot; prior to the early 1990s. A small minority of non-Bosniak Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina include Albanians, Roma and Turks.

Albeit traditionally adherent to Sunni Islam of the Hanafi school of jurisprudence, a 2012 survey found 54% of Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s Muslims to consider themselves just Muslims, while 38% told that they are Sunni Muslims. There is also a small Sufi community, located primarily in Central Bosnia. A small Shia Muslim community is also present in Bosnia. Almost all Muslim congregations in Bosnia and Herzegovina refer to the Islamic Community of Bosnia and Herzegovina as their religious organisation.

The Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina guarantees freedom of religion, which is generally upheld throughout the country.

== History ==
=== The Ottoman era ===

Islam was first introduced to the Balkans on a large scale by the Ottomans in the mid-to-late 15th century who gained control of most of Bosnia in 1463, and seized Herzegovina in the 1480s. Over the next century, the Bosnians – composed of native Christians and Slavic tribes living in the Bosnian kingdom under the name of &quot;Bošnjani&quot; – were converted to Islam in great numbers during the Islamization of Bosnia under Ottoman rule. During the Ottoman era the name &quot;Bošnjanin&quot; was definitely transformed into the current &quot;Bošnjak&quot; (&#x27;Bosniak&#x27;), with the suffix &quot;-ak&quot; replacing the traditional &quot;-anin&quot;. By the early 1600s, approximately two thirds of the population of Bosnia were Muslim. Bosnia and Herzegovina remained a province in the Ottoman Empire and gained autonomy after the Bosnian uprising in 1831. Large numbers of mosques were built all over the province. Most mosques erected during the Ottoman era were of relatively modest construction, often with a single minaret and central prayer hall with few adjoining foyers.

=== The Austro-Hungarian era ===

After the 1878 Congress of Berlin, Bosnia and Herzegovina came under the control of Austria-Hungary. In 1908, Austria-Hungary formally annexed the region. Unlike post-Reconquista Spain, the Austro-Hungarian authorities made no attempt to force convert the citizens of this newly-acquired territory as the December Constitution guaranteed freedom of religion, and so Bosnia and Herzegovina remained Muslim.

Bosnia, along with Albania and Kosovo were the only parts of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans where large percentages of people converted to Islam, and remained there after independence. In other areas of the former Ottoman Empire where Muslims formed the majority or started to form the majority, those Muslims were either expelled, assimilated/Christianized, massacred, or fled elsewhere (Muhajirs).

=== The post-war period ===

Many Islamic religious buildings were damaged or destroyed in the Bosnian War during the 90s, with up to 80% of well-over 4000 different buildings, and several mosques were rebuilt with the aid of funds from Saudi Arabia and other countries from the Middle and far East.

Historically, Bosnian Muslims had always practiced a form of Islam that is strongly influenced by Sufism. Since the Bosnian War, however, some remnants of groups of foreign fighters from the Middle East fighting on the side of Bosnian Army, remained for some time and attempted to spread Wahhabism among locals. With very limited success these foreigners only created friction between local Muslim population, steeped in their own traditional practice of the faith, and without any previous contact with this strain in Islam, and themselves.
Although these communities were relatively small and peaceful, restricted to a certain number of villages around central and northern Bosnia, the issue was highly politicized by local nationalists and officials, as well as officials and diplomats from countries like Croatia, Czech Republic and Serbia, to the point of outright fiction. Security Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time, Dragan Mektić of SDS, reacted strongly on such falsehoods by pointing on seriousness of such conspiratorial claims, and warned on possibility of further dangerous politicization and even acts of violence with an aim of labeling Bosnian Muslims as radicals.

== Demographics ==
In the 2013 census the declared religious affiliation of the population was: Islam (1,790,454 people) and Muslim (22,068 people) which makes up a total number of 1,812,522 (51.3%) followers of the Islamic faith in Bosnia and Herzegovina. PEW survey says that there are 52% Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The municipalities of Bužim (99.7%) and Teočak (99.7%) have the highest share of Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

== Contemporary relations ==

For a majority of Bosniaks that identify themselves as Muslims, religion often serves as a community linkage, and religious practice is confined to occasional visits to the mosque (especially during Ramadan and the two Eids) and significant rites of passage such as aqiqah, marriage, and death. Headscarves for women, or the hijab, is worn only by a minority of Bosniak women, or otherwise mostly for religious purpose (such as the &quot;çarşaf&quot; for prayer and going to the mosque).

Religious leaders from the three major faiths claim that observance is increasing among younger people as an expression of increased identification with their ethnic heritage, in large part due to the national religious revival that occurred as a result of the Bosnian war.
Leaders from the three main religious communities observed that they enjoy greater support from their believers after the end of Bosnian war. On the other hand, however, the violence and misery caused by religious conflict has led a small number of Bosnians to reject religion altogether. This atheist community faces discrimination, and is frequently verbally attacked by religious leaders as &quot;corrupt people without morals&quot;. According to the latest census, openly-declared atheists make up 0.79% of Bosnia&#x27;s population.

In a 1998 public opinion poll, 78.3% of Bosniaks in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared themselves to be religious.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina, there are eight muftis located in major municipalities across the country: Sarajevo, Bihać, Travnik, Tuzla, Goražde, Zenica, Mostar, and Banja Luka. The head of the Islamic Community of Bosnia and Herzegovina is Husein Kavazović.

<text>The 2004 United States presidential election in California took place on November 2 as part of the 2004 United States presidential election. Voters chose 55 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.

California was won by Democratic nominee John Kerry by a 9.94% margin of victory. Prior to the election, all leading news organizations considered this a state Kerry would win, or otherwise considered as a safe blue state. Republican presidential candidates have not taken California&#x27;s electoral votes since Bush&#x27;s father George H. W. Bush in his victory over Michael Dukakis in 1988. Bush would become the first Republican to win two terms in the White House without winning California at least once. With its 55 electoral votes, California was John Kerry&#x27;s biggest electoral prize in 2004.

This marked the first election since 1880 in which the Republican nominee won the nationwide popular vote without California and the first time since 1976 that it voted for the popular vote loser. It was also the first time since Californian statehood in 1850 that a presidential candidate, of any party, was elected to two terms to the presidency without winning the state either time. 

2004 is the most recent election in which a Republican presidential candidate has received more than 40% of the vote in California. It is also the most recent time a Republican has won more than a third of the vote in Los Angeles County, and the latest time the gap between the Republican and Democratic candidates was less than two million votes and single-digit points.

==Primaries==
* 2004 California Democratic presidential primary
* 2004 California Republican presidential primary

==Campaign==
===Predictions===
There were 12 news organizations who made state-by-state predictions of the election. Here are their last predictions before election day.

===Polling===
Kerry led every single pre-election poll. The final 3 polls average Kerry leading at 52% to Bush at 43% to Nader at 2%.

===Fundraising===
Bush raised $20,296,645, the second most money raised state for him. It accounted for 10.7% of all the money he raised in 2004. Kerry raised $36,378,063, which is by far the most money raised for Kerry by any state. The money raised in California accounted for almost 20% of all money he raised in 2004.

===Advertising and visits===
Neither Kerry nor Bush advertised or campaigned in the state during the fall election.

==Analysis==

California was once a Republican-leaning swing state, supporting Republican candidates in every election from 1952 through 1988, except in 1964. However, since the 1990s, California has become a reliably Democratic state with a highly diverse ethnic population (mostly Latino) and liberal bastions such as the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles County. The last time a Republican candidate won the state was in 1988 by George H. W. Bush.

In 2004, the state did swing slightly Republican by a 1.9% margin from 2000 due to strong swings in heavily populated San Diego, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura, Kern, Fresno, Stanislaus, and San Joaquin counties, in all of which Bush increased his margin by substantially more than he did nationally, and all of which save San Diego, San Joaquin, and Ventura he won by double digits. Bush also won over a million votes in Los Angeles County, the most populous county in the United States; and he held Kerry to a 0.2% margin in Sacramento County (which Gore had won by 4.0%). Bush also benefited from strong support by Arnold Schwarzenegger, the state&#x27;s Republican governor. These factors likely contributed to California being closer than expected in 2004.

Bush remains the last Republican candidate to win San Diego, San Luis Obispo and Ventura counties in a presidential election. Fresno, Merced, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Joaquin, and Stanislaus counties would not vote Republican again until 2024. He is also the last candidate of any party to win Butte county by a majority. This is the last time the Democratic Party failed to obtain at least 60% of the vote until 2024.

==Electors==
Technically the voters of California cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. California is allocated 55 electors because it has 53 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 53 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 53 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.

The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 13, 2004, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.

The following were the members of the Electoral College from California. All were pledged to and voted for John Kerry and John Edwards.

<doc id="1300970" wikidata="Q440121" url="?curid=1300970" title="Dave Bing">
<text>David Bing (born November 24, 1943) is an American former professional basketball player, businessman, and politician who served as the 74th mayor of Detroit, Michigan from 2009 to 2014. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

After starring at Syracuse University, Bing played 12 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a point guard for the Detroit Pistons (1966–1975), Washington Bullets (1975–1977), and Boston Celtics (1977–78). During his career, he averaged over 20 points and six assists per game and made seven NBA All-Star Game appearances, winning the game&#x27;s Most Valuable Player award in 1976. The Pistons celebrated his career accomplishments with the retirement of his #21 jersey. In addition, he was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and named to the NBA 50th Anniversary All-Time Team and the NBA 75th Anniversary All-Time Team.

Bing founded Bing Steel, a processing company that earned him the National Minority Small Business Person of the Year award in 1984. Soon the business grew into the multimillion-dollar Detroit-based conglomerate, the Bing Group, one of the largest steel companies in Michigan.

Bing entered Detroit politics as a Democrat in 2008, announcing his intentions to run for mayor in the city&#x27;s non-partisan primary to finish the term of Kwame Kilpatrick, who had resigned amid a corruption scandal. After winning the primary, Bing then defeated Interim Mayor Kenneth Cockrel Jr. and was sworn in as mayor in May 2009. Later that year, Bing was re-elected to a full term. However, he lost most of his power to Detroit&#x27;s emergency manager Kevyn Orr, had numerous health problems, and suffered approval ratings as low as 14%. Bing thus did not seek re-election in 2013 and was succeeded by politician and businessman Mike Duggan.

== Early life ==
Bing was born November 24, 1943, in Washington, D.C., to mother Juanita, a housekeeper, and father Hasker, a bricklayer and deacon for the local Baptist church. He was the second child of four living in a two-bedroom, one-story house in the northeast part of town. In his childhood, Bing received the nickname &quot;Duke&quot; from his father, because, according to Bing, he always &quot;wanted to be top dog.&quot; He suffered a traumatic eye injury at age five, when, while playing with an improvised hobby horse he constructed with two sticks nailed together; Bing tripped and accidentally poked his left eye with a rusty nail. The family could not afford emergency surgery, leaving the eye to heal on its own and diminishing his vision thereafter. Bing&#x27;s father also suffered a severe head injury during the boy&#x27;s childhood. While working a construction site, a brick fell four stories onto his head, causing a brain clot. The episode led young Bing to promise himself that he would never work in such a profession.

In athletics, Bing played basketball, but older children often told him he was too small for the game. However, he played well, triumphing over such older and bigger children as future Motown musician Marvin Gaye, who, after not performing well on the court, chose to sing on the sidelines. Bing and Gaye forged a friendship, which continued later in life. Despite his basketball play, Bing, a fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers and Jackie Robinson, focused primarily on baseball, the neighborhood&#x27;s preferred game.

Despite his fuzzy vision, he excelled in baseball at Spingarn High School, where he enrolled in 1958. Nevertheless, the school&#x27;s head basketball coach William Roundtree encouraged him to revisit basketball. Roundtree became a fatherly figure to Bing, who decided to join the team. He developed into a double-digits per game scorer, noted for his jump shot and knack for driving to the basket. He continued also to compete in baseball into his senior year, but was forced to choose between it and basketball when a scheduling conflict between two tournaments arose. Though he felt he was better at baseball, Bing opted for basketball, believing it gave him a greater chance at a full-ride college scholarship, well aware of the path taken by Los Angeles Lakers forward Elgin Baylor, a Spingarn alum. At the tournament, Bing led his team to victory and earned MVP honors. All in all, in high school, Bing was a three-year letter winner, all–Inter High, all-Metro, and all-East member. In 1962, he was featured in &quot;Parade&quot; magazine and made the All-American Team.

==College career==
Bing attended Syracuse University, where he was once roommates with Jim Boeheim. He led the Orangemen in scoring as a sophomore (22.2) in 1964, as a junior (23.2) in 1965, and as a senior (28.4) in 1966. During his senior year, Bing was fifth in the nation in scoring and was Syracuse&#x27;s first consensus All-American in 39 years. He was also named to &quot;The Sporting News&quot; All-America First Team and was named Syracuse Athlete of the Year.

In his three-year varsity career at Syracuse, Bing averaged 24.8 points and 10.3 rebounds, with 1883 total points and 786 total rebounds in 76 games.

While attending Syracuse, he became acquainted with Joe Biden, who was as student in the law school. Biden would later serve as a U.S. senator, vice president, and president of the United States.

==Professional career==
Bing&#x27;s playing style was somewhat unusual for the time. As a lean, athletic and explosive point guard, he functioned as the playmaker distributing the ball, but also did more shooting and scoring than most others who had this position. At one time a joke about him and his backcourt partner, Jimmy Walker, was that it was a shame they could only play the game with one ball at a time.

===Detroit Pistons (1966–1975)===
In 1966, after being selected 2nd overall in the 1966 NBA draft by the Detroit Pistons, Bing scored 1,601 points (20.0 points per game), and won the 1967 NBA Rookie of the Year Award while also being named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team. The next year, he led the NBA in scoring with 2,142 points (27.1 points per game) in 1968.

On November 23, 1968, Bing recorded a triple-double of 39 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists in a 127–128 loss to the Baltimore Bullets.

Bing sat out 2½ months of the 1971–72 season due to a detached retina incurred from a preseason game against the Los Angeles Lakers, playing in only 45 games that season. While with the Pistons, he played in six NBA All-Star Games (1968, 1969, 1971, 1973–1975), and was named to the All-NBA First Team in 1968 and 1971.

=== Washington Bullets (1975–1977) ===
After leaving the Detroit Pistons, Bing went on to spend his next two seasons with the Washington Bullets, for whom he was named an NBA All-Star once more in 1976, this time winning the game&#x27;s MVP Award.

=== Boston Celtics (1977–1978) ===
He played his final season with the Boston Celtics, averaging 13.6 points. He then retired at the conclusion of the 1977–1978 season.

Overall, in his NBA career, Bing averaged 20.3 points, 6.0 assists and 3.8 rebounds in 901 games over 12 NBA seasons, scoring 18,327 points with 5,397 assists.

== National Basketball Retired Players Association ==
In 1992, Bing co-founded the National Basketball Retired Players Association. , he continues to serve on its board of directors.

==Business career==
At age 22 with an NBA contract worth $15,000, Bing was rebuffed by the National Bank of Detroit on getting a mortgage to finance a home. This led Bing to work at the bank during the offseason, holding jobs in the teller, customer relations, and mortgage departments.

Immediately after retiring, he worked at a warehouse of the steel processing company Paragon Steel and was paid $35,000. He left after two years, after stints in the company&#x27;s shipping and sales operations.

===Bing Steel===
In 1980, Bing opened Bing Steel with four employees in a rented warehouse from $250,000 in loans and $80,000 of his own money. Losing all his money in six months, the company shied away from manufacturing to focus on being a middleman. With General Motors as their first major client, the company turned a profit in its second year on revenues of $4.2 million. By 1984, Bing was awarded by President Ronald Reagan the National Minority Small Business Person of the Year. By 1985, Bing Steel had expanded to two plants with 63 employees posting revenues of $40 million. Company assets were sold off in 2009.

===The Bing Group===
Bing Steel transformed itself to the Bing Group, a conglomerate with headquarters located in Detroit&#x27;s North End. The company, among other things, supplies metal stampings to the automobile industry.

At the 1990 NBA All-Star Game, Bing received the Schick Achievement Award for his work after his NBA career.

==Early political involvement and activism==
Bing was an early political supporter of Kwame Kilpatrick. However, Bing was among the first Michigan business community leaders to urge the resignation of Kilpatrick from his office as mayor of Detroit when scandals emerged surrounding Kilpatrick. Kilpatrick resigned as mayor in September 2008.

Bing led Detroit&#x27;s effort to receive the rights to host the 2004 Democratic National Convention. In November 2002, Detroit lost to Boston. Detroit&#x27;s weak spot was considered to be its smaller number of hotel rooms.

In January 2009, on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Bing received the National Civil Rights Museum Sports Legacy Award. The award honors King&#x27;s legacy as a leader of the civil rights movement, by acknowledging athletes who have made significant contributions to civil and human rights and who helped establish a foundation for future leaders in athletic careers. The honor was to be presented during the half-time show of the game between the Memphis Grizzlies and the Detroit Pistons in Memphis, Tennessee.

Bing volunteered in the Big Brothers Big Sisters of America program.

==Mayoralty==
===2009 elections===
On October 16, 2008, Bing announced that he would be a candidate for mayor of Detroit in the 2009 Detroit mayoral special election to finish the term of Kwame Kilpatrick, who had resigned as part of a plea bargain agreement after being charged with the crime of perjury. Bing finished first in a 15 candidate non-partisan primary on February 24, 2009. On May 5, 2009, Bing was elected with 52.3% of the vote, defeating interim mayor Kenneth Cockrel Jr., who received 47.7%. Bing had only moved to a residence within city limits shortly before his campaign for mayor. Bing had previously resided in suburban Franklin, Michigan.

Bing was reelected to a full term on November 3, 2009. Bing&#x27;s inauguration for his full term was held at the Fox Theatre.

===Leadership style===
In comparison to his predecessor Kwame Kilaptrick, Bing opted for a more low-key presence as mayor and opted to forgo enjoying many of the benefits to which the mayor was entitled. Bing additionally forwent accepting salary as mayor during at least his first year as mayor. Bing did not shy away from making decisions that were unpopular.

===Fiscal and economic matters===
When Bing took office, the city was suffering significant economic trouble and its government was suffering major fiscal trouble. The city was suffering a $30 million budget deficit. The city also had overall accumulated $332 million in deficit, more than $15 million in long-term liabilities. The city government&#x27;s fiscal troubles persisted under Bing, with Detroit suffering increased budget deficits during much of his tenure. However, by the time he left office, the city&#x27;s deficit had decreased by $7 million from where it stood when he assumed office.

Due to the importance of the automotive industry to Detroit, Bing was involved in discussions related to the 2009 auto bailout. These discussions also included Vice President Joe Biden, who Bing had first known when they were students at Syracuse University.

In 2011, Bing proposed that the city&#x27;s next budget include a $4 million decrease in funding for City Council staff, and fund new hires for the city&#x27;s fire department. In mid-2011, Bing vetoed the budget passed by the City Council, claiming its cuts were excessive and could be to the detriment of the services of the city&#x27;s police and fire departments. The City Council&#x27;s budget made $50 million more in cuts than Bing&#x27;s initial proposed budget had made. Bing&#x27;s budget proposal was for $3.1 billion in spending. The City Council overrode this veto in an 8–1 vote. The city&#x27;s 2012 budget made a 20% decrease to the city&#x27;s fire department. This has been seen as having a detrimental effect on the city&#x27;s ability to handle fires, including arson. In mid-2012, the fire department announced 164 layoffs. In 2013, Bing proposed a $1 billion budget, a $300 million decrease from the previous year&#x27;s budget.

By the time he was reelected to a full term, Bing had dismissed more than 400 city employees and had ended 16 out of 51 contracts that the city had with trade unions. Bing faced protests by unions during his mayoralty. By the end of his mayoralty, Bing had eliminated 1,000 positions in the city government, a 9% decrease to the municipal workforce. Additionally, many city employees faced decreased salaries, decreased benefits, and even furloughs. Bing also outsourced many roles of the city government. The city&#x27;s public health department was replaced by the Institution for Population Health public-private partnership. The workforce-development department was replaced by Detroit Employment Solutions, a nonprofit organization. Management of payroll and benefits for city employees was also outsourced.

The city enjoyed new private development over the course of Bing&#x27;s tenure. This included both the opening of new small businesses, an investment of $198 million by Chrysler in its Mack Avenue Engine Plant (which created 250 new jobs), and significant development in the city&#x27;s downtown by businessman Dan Gilbert.

===Blight management===
Bing proposed the idea of demolishing neighborhoods and decreasing city services. Bing spoke of his intention to depopulate neighborhoods, including through forcible means such as eminent domain. This was controversial among city residents. Bing sought to incentivize residents to relocate from largely depopulated neighborhoods so that those neighborhoods could be demolished and the public services could be consolidated to more densely populated areas of the city. Past mayors had made pledges to demolish abandoned homes but taken little action to do so. Under Bing, the city took action to demolish abandoned homes, reporting in early 2013 to have demolished 6,700 since Bing took office. However, the city still had tens of thousands more abandoned homes. Bing&#x27;s program of demolishing abandoned homes was controversial with some city residents. Aiming to repopulate certain neighborhoods, in early 2011 Bing began a program to give $150,000 in grants to assist in renovations of foreclosed homes in select neighborhoods. Hoping to encourage members of the city&#x27;s police force to reside within city limits, Bing only required police officers to place a mere $1,000 in order to acquire abandoned residences and be eligible for renovation grants.

Bing launched the Detroit Works Project (later renamed Detroit Future City), an effort to create a 50-year outline for the city&#x27;s future. The project was intended to create a community-planned vision for how the city would manage its problems. The city government underestimated how many citizens would attend community meetings. Controversy arose during the process, when Bing publicized his intention to depopulate certain neighborhoods by forcibly relocating residents to denser neighborhoods. The public anger at this threatened the project.

Bing sought to fix the city&#x27;s broken street lights, which were considered a serious problem. In 2012, Bing persuaded the state legislature and governor to create the Public Lighting Authority of Detroit and dedicate utility and income tax revenue for the $185 million in bonds for this purpose. Bing appointed a lighting authority board, which then signed a contract with DTE Energy to repair the city&#x27;s streetlights. However, the contract did not take place until early 2013, by which time Bing had left office. Bing&#x27;s successor Mike Duggan built upon Bing&#x27;s efforts to repair the city&#x27;s streetlights to significant success. It has been noted that, due to Bing being out of office when the work was carried out, he has not received much public credit for it.

===Policing and crime===
During Bing&#x27;s tenure, there was trouble within the Detroit Police Department. This included instability in leadership, with the city cycling through four different police chiefs during Bing&#x27;s less-than-5-years in office. While he gave no explicit reason for the firing, it was speculated that Bing dismissed the first police chief of his mayoralty, Warren Evans, both due to the police raid that resulted in the killing of Aiyana Jones and due to Bing&#x27;s dissatisfaction with Warren&#x27;s pursuit of media exposure through participation in reality television shows such as &quot;The First 48&quot;. Even as crime in large cities was declining overall in the United States, Detroit saw its homicide rate rise to a 20-year high in 2012.

===Other projects===
Early into his mayoralty, Bing began pursuing a renovation of Cobo Center, the city&#x27;s main convention center. Renovation occurred while Bing was mayor, taking place under the management of a new cooperative governing authority for the convention center.

Bing established the city&#x27;s Active and Safe Campaign public-private partnership to raise funds for public safety initiatives, as well as raise funds for recreational programs and enhancements to the city&#x27;s recreation facilities.

Bing made an unpopular proposal to decrease city bus service on Sundays. This never came into fruition.

===Emergency management and municipal bankruptcy===
On March 1, 2013, Governor Rick Snyder announced that he would appoint an emergency manager for the city of Detroit due to the city&#x27;s fiscal troubles, making Detroit the United States largest city&#x27;s to be placed under emergency management. Bing had, in the years prior, warned that this was a possibility, and expressed his desire for the city to avert such a situation. The placement of the city under emergency management deprived Bing of much of his mayoral authority. Bing declared that while he opposed emergency management, he was willing to work collaboratively with the emergency manager that would be appointed. Kevyn Orr was soon after appointed to the emergency manager role. Many in the city criticized Bing for not being more resistant to emergency management.

In July 2013, before Bing left office, Detroit became the largest city in United States history to declare municipal bankruptcy. This was the decision of emergency manager Kevin Orr. Many criticized Bing for not doing more to fight this move by Orr.

===Decision to forgo seeking reelection in 2013===
In addition to losing authority to the emergency manager, Bing suffered numerous health problems, and had seen approval ratings as low as 14%. Bing announced on May 14, 2013, he would not run for reelection to another term in the election to be held later that year.

==Later political activities==
In August 2023, Bing endorsed Elissa Slotkin&#x27;s candidacy for the 2024 United States Senate election in Michigan.

==Personal life==
Bing is the godfather of Jalen Rose. In 2020, Bing published his autobiography titled &#x27;Attacking the Rim&#x27;.

==Honors==
Bing was awarded the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award in 1977.

Bing was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1990.

Bing was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996.

<text>The Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen (B of LF&amp;E) was a North American railroad fraternal benefit society and trade union in the 19th and 20th centuries. The organization began in 1873 as the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen (B of LF), a mutual benefit society for workers employed as firemen for steam locomotives, before expanding its name in 1907 in acknowledgement that many of its members had been promoted to the job of railroad engineer. Gradually taking on the functions of a trade union over time, in 1969 the B of LF&amp;E merged with three other railway labor organizations to form the United Transportation Union.

== Organizational history ==
=== Background ===

Early railway transportation relied upon steam engines to power railway locomotives—large coal-fired boilers which generated motive power through the manipulation of concentrated steam. These boilers required a regular input of fuel to keep the train fired up and running. It was the task of so-called locomotive firemen to shovel coal into a train engine&#x27;s firebox through a narrow opening, thereby feeding the fire.

The job of a locomotive fireman was physically demanding—strenuous, filthy and dangerous. Although by no means a highly skilled task, locomotive firemen nevertheless needed to develop not only physical prowess, moving heavy coal on a swaying platform, but also a certain job savvy, estimating the engine&#x27;s burn rate and future fuel needs, making sure that water was continuously in the boiler to avoid an explosion and ensuring that coal was sufficiently and properly spread in the firebox to ensure the locomotive&#x27;s efficient operation.

A locomotive&#x27;s fireman worked in a tandem with the train&#x27;s engineer, serving in a subordinate role as his assistant. Firemen were in practice often engineers-in-training, learning the skills of train operation and assisting the engineer with the observation of signals and other routine aspects of his job performance, waiting for a job opportunity for promotion.

Locomotive firemen were consequently lower paid and of lower status than the highly paid railroad engineers—although both of these were actually subordinate to the train&#x27;s conductor. It was the conductor, not the locomotive engineer, who was most comparable to the captain of a ship. The conductor oversaw the crew and assigned them their mission, made sure the train ran on schedule, inspected car couplings, arranged for the train to maintain adequate supplies, collected passenger fares and supervised the train&#x27;s freight documentation. Conductors acted as both supervisors and traveling clerks and were in practice the figures of the highest authority on a train. Locomotive fireman generally received but half the salary of a conductor or engineer and shared in none of their authority.

Despite the hard nature of the work process, their low professional status and their mediocre pay, locomotive firemen performed very dangerous jobs. Boiler explosions and other railway accidents made railroad work among the most deadly in the United States at the end of the 19th century, with an annual fatality rate in the early 1890s of approximately 9 per 1,000 workers—higher even than the 7.8 per 1,000 fatality rate suffered by hard rock miners in the Western United States. Non-fatal workplace accidents were also endemic among railroad workers, with one study by the Illinois Bureau of Labor Statistics determining that railroad workers suffered more than half the broken arms and ribs and 71 percent of all arms and legs amputated as the result of mishaps on the job.

During the 19th century, occupational safety regulation was non-existent in the United States as were the social benefits of the welfare state for employees injured on the job or the families of workers who suffered fatal accidents. As a result, workers themselves endeavored to form fraternal organizations among their peers for the purposes of insurance and the payment of benefits for death or disability suffered on the job. Some of these organizations were based upon religion or ethnicity, while others were occupational in nature. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen—later known as the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen—was one such organization.

===Establishment===

It was the engineers who pioneered occupational fraternal benefit organization in the railroad industry, with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers launching a charity called the Widows&#x27;, Orphans&#x27;, and Disabled Members&#x27; Fund in 1866. That organization went on to expand its benefits package through the establishment of a formal life insurance package via the Locomotive Engineers&#x27; Mutual Life Insurance Association in 1867. Conductors followed by establishing their own fraternal order in 1868.

Five years later came the locomotive firemen&#x27;s turn to establish a fraternal benefits society of their own. This organization, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen (B of LF) was founded on December 1, 1873 in Port Jervis, New York by Joshua A. Leach and 10 other Erie Railroad firemen. These men had recently been forced to pass on the news of the fatal accident in a wreck of fellow fireman George Page to his grieving widow the previous month and decided to establish a mutual benefit society for those employed in the locomotive firemen&#x27;s trade. Other lodges soon followed and within a year there were a dozen functioning local groups scattered about the states of New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Indiana. These met in convention in 1874 and adopted a first constitution for the organization and established a subsidiary institution called the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen&#x27;s Life Insurance Association of the United States.

Indeed, the main practical purpose of the organization was its utility as a mutual insurance association, with each member to receive death benefit coverage of 50 cents per member up to a maximum of $1,000 for loss of life on the job. A second optional fund provided for disability benefits. In 1881, the death benefit was pegged at a fixed level of $1,000 in 1883, with no more than 3 settlements per month to be paid, with premiums set at 50 cents per month per member. Total disability through loss of an arm, leg, or eyesight on the job was to be treated the same as loss of life under the revised system.

In 1884, benefits were expanded, with the death benefit raised to $1,500. By February 1889, a total of $1.35 million had been paid out in benefits by the B of LF. A total of 18,000 locomotive firemen were members of the organization at that date.

As a general rule in the B of LF and the other similar railroad brotherhoods, death and permanent disability benefits were administered by the national organization while local lodges handled sickness and accident insurance through a separate fund, raised and disbursed independently of the national organization. During the decade of the 1880s, such a local assessment might amount to 50 cents per member per month. Local units also saw to the emotional support of ill or injured members, with committees visiting the bedridden and attempting to provide personal solace to family members.

===Organizational form===

The B of LF in this early period organized itself into a network of &quot;lodges&quot;, which provided a place for members to meet others in the profession to discuss matters of common concern. Social functions such as balls and picnics were periodically conducted under the B of LF&#x27;s auspices. The organization also published a monthly magazine, &quot;The Firemen&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (later &quot;Locomotive Firemen&#x27;s Magazine&quot;), including railroad news of the day and articles appealing to the membership&#x27;s professional interests. Little attention was paid to labor-management relations, with the B of LF mildly offering the suggestion that &quot;the oldest firemen in service&quot; should be promoted to positions as engineers &quot;when they are competent and worthy, and opportunity offers&quot;.

The early B of LF took the form of a secret society, complete with an elaborate initiation ritual, membership oaths, secret signs of recognition, and formulaic protocol for the conduct of lodge meetings. Much of the original inspiration in this regard derived from the quasi-mystic religious tradition of Freemasonry. Meetings formally opened with a prayer conducted by the lodge chaplain and were modest and subdued, emphasizing the sacred task of the organization and the need for members to maintain appropriate decorum and professionalism in daily life.

In the B of LF&#x27;s initiation ceremony of the 1870s, the initiate was seated in the darkened lodge room in front of a large backdrop used as a screen, while wearing a &quot;hoodwink&quot;—blindfolding headgear with retractable opaque lenses. First the prospective member was instructed by the lodge chaplain as to the benevolent purposes of the organization and the sacred duties of the members thereof. Next, lodge members then joined in by collectively reciting the four principles ensconced in the organization&#x27;s motto &quot;Protection, Charity, Sobriety, Industry&quot;.

At this point a stereopticon began to project a series of images on the screen, after each of which the lenses of the hoodwink were briefly raised and the image was explained to the initiate. First, a locomotive fireman leaving his family to go to work; then, a train with its crew industriously fulfilling their assigned task. Next came an image of a train wreck, followed by another of a funeral attended by members of the brotherhood, paying their respects to the deceased. This was followed by an image of a lodge representative relieving the grieving widow with a payment of the organization&#x27;s death indemnity. Having witnessed his own symbolic death, the new candidate was thus made acutely aware both of the importance of his own support of families of maimed or fallen brothers in their time of need as well as the confidence that his own family would be provided for should he himself fall to misfortune.

The initiation experience was memorable and effective in building lasting commitments to the organization. Three decades after his own initiation into the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, Eugene V. Debs recalled the evening as a watershed in his life: A new purpose entered my life, a fresh force impelled me as I repeated the obligation to serve the &#x27;brotherhood,&#x27; and I left that meeting with a totally different and far loftier ambition than I had ever known before.

Formulaic rituals and organizational secrecy also helped to insure that lodge meetings were orderly, intimate and confidential and contributed to group cohesion among B of LF members. The value of the B of LF&#x27;s mission was emphasized, allowing serious-minded members a sense of personal fulfillment through participation in an important collective entity.

=== Membership exclusion ===
The benefits of membership in the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen were not universally available as the organization was based on the systematic exclusion of African American men and of women of all races. The organization&#x27;s constitution in 1888 specified that membership requirements included that a candidate be a man &quot;white born, of good moral character, sober and industrious, sound of body and limb&quot;. Additional &quot;de facto&quot; membership discrimination was practiced against recent unskilled immigrants from Europe, who were similarly held to be unsuitable for membership.

The white-only rule came up for debate in 1896-97, when the B of LF explored membership in the American Federation of Labor, only to learn that the AF of L would require the removal of the offending clause from the group&#x27;s constitution. Rank and file membership erupted in protest over the change, flooding the organization with letters of protest, with members of lodges in the Southern United States most vociferous in their opposition. The racial exclusion was ruled unconstitutional in 1944 by the Supreme Court decision &quot;Tunstall v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen&quot;.

The B of LF and other similar railroad brother hoods were, in short, based as much upon a process of exclusion as they were upon unification, as historian Mary Ann Clawson has noted in a 1989 book.

=== Leading officials ===

The pioneer head of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen during the decade of the 1870s was Frank W. Arnold (1851–1917). Arnold would be succeeded as Grand Master of the B of LF in 1885 by a man who would remain the iconic chief of the brotherhood for the rest of the 19th century, Frank P. Sargent. The New England-born Sargent remained the head official of the B of LF until 1902, when he was named Commissioner General of Immigration by Republican President Theodore Roosevelt.

The eventuality of a Grand Master&#x27;s incapacity to serve was provided for by the periodic election of a Vice Grand Master, nominally the second ranking officer of the organization. In practice, however, the number two functionary in the &quot;Grand Lodge&quot; of officers of the B of LF was the Grand Secretary and Treasurer—running the organization&#x27;s office on a day-to-day basis and providing for the publication of the B of LF&#x27;s monthly magazine.
The first Grand Secretary and Treasurer was William Sayre of Galion, Ohio, who professed to be a staunch advocate of the theory that personal virtue and good character, economic efficiency and a stable and democratic republic were closely interrelated. While Sayre espoused these sacred values on a theoretical plain, in practice his behavior seems to have been rather more profane. In July 1880, a young locomotive fireman turned city clerk from Terre Haute, Indiana named Eugene V. Debs was elected as Grand Secretary and Treasurer of the B of LF. Upon gaining access to the books, Debs discovered that his predecessor had been embezzling funds from the organization. With the B of LF about $6,000 in debt, Debs stabilized the organization&#x27;s shaky finances with a promissory note which he personally backed and began a new era of careful financial management. Two years later, the Brotherhood had recovered, with nearly $13,000 in the bank to the credit of the organization&#x27;s 6,000 members.

Debs was named editor of the &quot;Locomotive Firemen&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1881 and he remained in that capacity and in the position of Grand Secretary and Treasurer until September 1894. While remaining supportive of the B of LF and its limited mission, over time Debs began to feel the insufficiency of a mere fraternal benefits to solve the fundamental problems facing locomotive firemen and other railway workers, which were often financial in nature and seemed to call for collective action.

In 1893, Debs was instrumental in forming an industrial union bringing together railway workers of all occupational tasks, the American Railway Union (ARU). This organization conducted several strikes for higher wages and better working conditions before ultimately being broken by judicial injunction in the 1894 Pullman strike.

=== Change of name ===
The 23rd Convention of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, held in Milwaukee in September 1906, took the step of expanding the scope of the organization and changing its name—an idea that had been discussed for many years previously. Over time a steady stream of the organization&#x27;s members had been promoted to the position of Engineer while remaining inside the organization. This presented a situation in which the organization&#x27;s name did not reflect its actual membership composition. Despite great sympathy for the traditional organizational moniker, the convention voted to formally acknowledge the participation of engineers among its membership and changed its name to the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen (B of LF&amp;E).

This change went into effect on January 1, 1907.

=== Disestablishment and legacy ===
In 1969, the union merged with the Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen, the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and the Switchmen&#x27;s Union of North America to form the United Transportation Union.

A massive collection of materials of the B of LF&amp;E, including over 200 linear feet of minutes, bulletins, correspondence, internal documents and other ephemera is housed at the Kheel Center for Labor-Management Documentation and Archives at the library of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.

<doc id="1300990" wikidata="Q3189970" url="?curid=1300990" title="Jumping Flash!">
<text>is a 1995 platform video game developed by Exact and Ultra and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation. It was originally released on April 28, 1995 in Japan, September 29, 1995 in PAL territories as well as November 2, 1995 in North America.

Presented in a first-person perspective, the game follows a robotic rabbit named &quot;Robbit&quot; as he searches for missing jet pods scattered by the game&#x27;s astrophysicist antagonist character Baron Aloha. Robbit must explore each section of Crater Planet to retrieve all of the jet pods, stop Aloha and save the world from being destroyed. The game was designed as a technology demonstrator for the PlayStation console and was revealed in early 1994 under the provisional title of &quot;Spring Man&quot;. &quot;Jumping Flash!&quot; utilizes much of the game engine used in &quot;Geograph Seal&quot;, an earlier game by Exact for the Sharp X68000 home computer.

&quot;Jumping Flash!&quot; has been described as an ancestor of, as well as an early showcase for, 3D graphics in console gaming. It was generally well received by critics, who praised its graphics and unique 3D platforming gameplay, but it was eventually overshadowed by later 3D platformers of the fifth console generation. &quot;Jumping Flash!&quot; spawned two sequels: &quot;Jumping Flash! 2&quot; and &quot;Robbit Mon Dieu&quot;. It received positive reviews at the time of release, and made an appearance in &quot;Next Generation&quot;″s &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot; just one year after. The game was described as the third-most underrated video game of all time by Matt Casamassina of IGN in 2007. It holds the Guinness World Record as the &quot;first platform video game in true 3D&quot;.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Jumping Flash!&quot; is presented in a first-person perspective. The player assumes the role of Robbit, a robotic rabbit, and can freely move Robbit in three-dimensional space and can rotate the camera in any direction. The top part of the screen shows the remaining time, the player&#x27;s score, and a character named Kumagoro—Robbit&#x27;s sidekick artificial intelligence who offers the player warnings and hints. The top left corner of the screen shows the collected power-ups; the top right corner contains the radar showing the locations of objects including enemies, power-ups, jet pods and enemy projectiles. The bottom shows a health meter on the sides and the number of remaining lives in the centre. The player starts the game with three lives; a new life is granted once one million points are earned.

The core of the gameplay is focused on the player&#x27;s ability to make Robbit jump. Robbit can jump up to three times in mid-air, which allows him to reach extreme heights. Unlike other platform games that continue to face horizontally when the player jumps, in &quot;Jumping Flash!&quot; the camera tilts downwards when a double-jump or triple-jump is performed to allow the player to see Robbit&#x27;s shadow and easily plan a landing spot. The player has the ability to shoot a low-powered laser beam at a target indicator in the middle of the screen. The player can find and use fireworks for Robbit to damage enemies. These include cherry bombs, rockets, Roman candles and spinners.

Each level has a time limit of ten minutes, which ends the game if it is exceeded. Losing all lives is presented with a choice to continue or return to the title screen. Power-ups scattered across each world, presented as picture frames, include carrots that extend Robbit&#x27;s health, extra lives, time-outs that stop the clock and freeze the level&#x27;s dynamics for a few seconds, hourglasses that extend the player&#x27;s time, and power pills that make Robbit invincible for a short period of time. Enemies in the game vary from anthropomorphic versions of creatures to robots and plants.

The game is composed of six worlds with three levels each, totalling to 18 main levels. The objective of the main levels in each world is to collect four jet pods. Each final level of a world consists of a boss fight. The level designs vary from snow-capped mountains to carnivals. While most of the levels are large, outdoor excursions, two are enclosed within a narrow interior. The game features hidden bonus levels, which are triggered when secret entrances are found. Bonus levels consist of blocks with balloons in them; popping the balloons yields either coins or power-ups. A time attack mode is available for any level the player has completed.

== Plot ==
The game begins on Crater Planet and revolves around the story of an insane astrophysicist, Baron Aloha. Planning to make a large profit from his evil ingenuity, Aloha removes giant pieces of land from the planet using machines to turn them into private resorts. Aloha removes and hides the twelve jet pods that propel each world. Witnessing the destruction, the residents of Crater Planet call for help, and in response the Universal City Hall dispatches one of their agents, a mechanical rabbit named Robbit. Robbit is ordered to explore each world to retrieve the jet pods, stop Aloha, and save Crater Planet from destruction. At the end of the game, Aloha flees to his home, Little Muu, and vows revenge on Robbit.

Throughout the game, Aloha surrounds himself with creatures called MuuMuus that appear as small, white, five-limbed creatures with miniature palm trees on their heads. Many of the game&#x27;s full motion videos feature the MuuMuus in an izakaya tavern, recounting their defeat at the hands of Robbit.

== Development and release ==
&quot;Jumping Flash!&quot; was developed by Japanese developers Exact and Ultra. Exact, short for Excellent Application Create Team, was previously known for developing games for the Sharp X68000; their previous game, &quot;Geograph Seal&quot;, serves as a spiritual predecessor to &quot;Jumping Flash!&quot;, utilizing the same engine and some gameplay designs. After seeing &quot;Geograph Seal&quot; and realising the potential in their game design, Sony&#x27;s director of entertainment in Japan, Koji Tada, paired Exact with Ultra to develop a new game for the upcoming PlayStation console. Tada replaced Hiroyuki Saegusa as director of the game, although he had kept all key Exact staff to work on the project. Sony Computer Entertainment hoped &quot;Jumping Flash!&quot; would be remembered as the first appearance of a new &quot;platform star&quot; with the same longevity as Sonic the Hedgehog or Mario. The game was first revealed in early 1994 under the provisional title &quot;Spring Man&quot; as a technology demonstration for the upcoming PlayStation console.

The initial development was split into two phases. Exact developed the game engine and its gameplay; Ultra designed the story and 3D cutscenes, and created characters including the protagonist, a mechanical rabbit named Robbit. Ultra felt they needed to depart from the &quot;stereotypical science fiction vibe&quot; that included the usual &quot;space ranger&quot; or double agent protagonists. To create a sense of individuality among platform games, the developers implemented a dynamic camera that would automatically pan down towards the shadow of Robbit on the ground during large jumps, allowing players to carefully line up their landings. &quot;Jumping Flash!&quot; was considered the first game of the platform genre to be developed with full 3D computer graphics. The music for &quot;Jumping Flash!&quot; was composed by Japanese video games and anime music composer Takeo Miratsu. Many of the tracks, along with tracks from &quot;Jumping Flash! 2&quot;, were included on the &quot;Jumping Flash! 2 Original Soundtrack&quot; album, which Miratsu also composed.

== Reception and legacy ==
The game received generally positive reviews upon release. Critics mainly praised its unique innovation, advanced graphics, gameplay and clean textures. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave it their &quot;Game of the Month&quot; award, citing the outstanding graphics and particularly the innovative 3D gameplay. They described the style as &quot;cutesy&quot; but not off-putting. &quot;Major Mike&quot; of &quot;GamePro&quot; said that despite the game appearing &quot;strange&quot;, it had action, strategy, and some humour. &quot;Next Generation&quot; said that &quot;[many] of the boundaries have been redefined in a big way&quot;, contrasting it with side-scrolling platformers with a first-person perspective and explorable 3D environments. They called it &quot;simply superb&quot; and gave it a &quot;Revolutionary&quot; five-star rating. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine called it &quot;one of the most innovative and entertaining games seen&quot; and &quot;the first true 3D platformer.&quot; &quot;Official UK PlayStation Magazine&quot; wrote that &quot;To suggest that &quot;Jumping Flash&quot; is innovative is a criminal understatement: there&#x27;s never been anything like this game in terms of sheer brain-popping wow factor.&quot;

&quot;Maximum&quot; stated that &quot;Jumping Flash!&quot; was one of the most &quot;imaginative, playable, enjoyable&quot; and original titles seen on the fifth generation of video game consoles. They criticised its length and lack of difficulty, expressing that it could have been one of the &quot;greatest games ever&quot; if it was longer and more difficult, and questioned whether it was &quot;a really worthwhile&quot; purchase. Game Revolution called the graphics &quot;mind blowing&quot; and the game itself &quot;totally unique&quot;, but criticised the overall length and ease of play. IGN&#x27;s 1996 review similarly disapproved the difficulty, stating that despite the small worlds and easy difficulty, it is &quot;a great, genre-pushing game&quot;, also saying it is an essential for all PlayStation owners. 

=== Retrospective ===
In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed it as number 86 on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, saying it had created the genre of 3D platforming. They particularly praised &quot;the vertigo inducing sense of height as Robbit leaps from platform to platform&quot;. In a 2007 review, Greg Miller of IGN condemned the graphics as &quot;dated&quot;, having &quot;jagged edges&quot; and &quot;muddled&quot; colours, and said every aspect of the game is &quot;weak&quot; and that it had not stood &quot;the test of time&quot;. In a retrospective review, Andrew Yoon of Engadget praised the gameplay and innovation, saying the &quot;grainy&quot; and &quot;antiquated&quot; graphics did no harm to the vibrant atmosphere of the game.

Speaking in 2007, Rob Fahey of Eurogamer stated that &quot;Jumping Flash!&quot; was arguably one of the most important ancestors of any 3D platform game, as well as asserting that the game would always have a part in videogaming history. Albert Kim of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated that the game provided perhaps the most euphoric sensation of video gaming at the time and described the first-person perspective as &quot;hypnotic&quot;. Maddy Thorson, the creator of the indie video game &quot;TowerFall&quot;, praised the game, saying &quot;something about the sensation of leaping through 3D space captured my childhood imagination&quot;.

1UP.com cited its first-person platforming as a precursor to &quot;Mirror&#x27;s Edge&quot;, despite suggesting that the jumping remained &quot;woefully out of place&quot; in the platform genre. In 2007, Matt Casamassina of IGN ranked &quot;Jumping Flash!&quot; as the third-most underrated video game of all time. After release, co-developer Ultra renamed themselves &quot;Muu Muu&quot;, after the creatures featured in the game.

== Legacy ==
Due to its popularity, Sony produced two sequels to &quot;Jumping Flash!&quot;, including one spin-off. A direct sequel, &quot;Jumping Flash! 2&quot;—also developed by Exact—was released worldwide for the PlayStation the following year; it continued the story of Robbit and the subsequent rise and fall of Baron Aloha. The game received positive reviews upon release, with critics particularly praising its updated features. &quot;Robbit Mon Dieu&quot; was released in Japan for the PlayStation in 1999. It was met with mixed reviews. Exact merged into Sony Computer Entertainment in 2000. A loose spin-off utilizing the PocketStation titled &quot;Pocket MuuMuu&quot; was released in 1999, making it the most recent game in the series to be released.

The game was re-released through the PlayStation Network store on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable in 2007, in 2012 on PlayStation Vita and again in 2022 on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. Despite the series&#x27; dormancy, Sony honored the series with Robbit&#x27;s frequent appearances as collectibles in PlayStation Stars, a loyalty program on PlayStation Network.

<text>Phi Beta Fraternity () is an American professional collegiate fraternity for the creative and performing arts. It was founded in 1912 at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Phi Beta is gender inclusive and incorporates all art forms into its membership. It is a founding member of the Professional Fraternity Association.

== History ==
Phi Beta Fraternity began as a local club at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, on May 5, 1912. It was established as a women&#x27;s professional fraternity for music and speech. Its three founders were Gladys Burnside, Josephine Mack, and Elsie Schultz.

The fraternity was incorporated in the State of Illinois in 1914. Phi Beta organized its first residence, renting a house at 1928 Sherman Avenue in Evanston, Illinois.

In 1915, Phi Beta petitioned the women&#x27;s social fraternity Alpha Delta Pi for a charter. Because most of Phi Beta&#x27;s members were enrolled in professional two- or three-year coursework, as opposed to traditional four-year programs, that petition was denied. Also in 1915, a group of women at the Chicago Conservatory petitioned to become a chapter of Phi Beta Fraternity; &quot;Beta chapter&quot; was installed on .

Helen Rowan served as Phi Beta&#x27;s first national president. Phi Beta&#x27;s first convention was held in the spring of 1918 in Chicago, Illinois. The fraternity became a member of the Professional Panhellenic Association when that group formed in 1925.

By 1963, the fraternity had chartered 41 chapters (31 actives) and had 34 alumni chapters, with more than 13,000 members.

In 1974 and 1975, its chapters voted to become co-ed, prompted by Title IX. Today, Phi Beta is gender inclusive. In 1978, Phi Beta became a founding member of the Professional Fraternity Association (PFA), with Phi Beta member Mary Ellin Frohmader serving as the first president of PFA.

Phi Beta is also affiliated with the Fraternity Communication Association (FCA) and the National Interfraternity Music Council (NIMC). It was a member of the American Educational Theatre Association, Music Educators&#x27; National Conference, the National Federation of Music Clubs, the American Educational Theatre Association, and the Speech Association of America.

== Symbols ==
Phi Beta&#x27;s badge is a monogram of the Greek letters &#x27;; the outside of the &#x27; can be set with pearls and its bar can be set with pearls or diamonds. The fraternity&#x27;s pledge pin is a small gold . The fraternity also has a recognition pin, in the shape of a gold laurel wreath that has a baton through it middle.

Phi Beta&#x27;s colors are violet and gold. Violet represents sincerity and gold symbolizes success. Its flower is the yellow rose, tied by a violet ribbon. Symbolically, the rose and ribbon reflect the fraternity&#x27;s colors, but are also intended to represent &quot;joy, friendship, and new beginnings.&quot; Its motto is &quot;To be rather to seem to be&quot;. Its quarterly publication is &quot;The Baton&quot;.

== Membership ==
In the beginning, the fraternity limited its membership to women majoring in music and speech. Over time, the fraternity has grown to embrace all of the creative and performing arts and their related therapies and histories, marking this broader acceptance of art students instead of &quot;only&quot; fine arts, or &quot;only&quot; dance.

== Philanthropy ==
Annually, Phi Beta awards scholarships to its collegiate members and grants to its alumni members.

Phi Beta has completed several national projects including: enlarging by hand sheet music for the visually impaired, service in USO shows, aiding music programs in Mexico, and most notably its continued work with The MacDowell (artists&#x27; residency and workshop) in Peterborough, New Hampshire.

In 1931, the fraternity built and endowed a stone cottage at the MacDowell Colony for use by creative artists. Pi Sigma also built a practice studio at the National Music Camp in Interlochen, Michigan in 1934.

== Chapters ==

<doc id="1301018" wikidata="Q3588848" url="?curid=1301018" title="Central Alabama">
<text>Central Alabama is a region in the state of Alabama. It is sometimes considered part of North Alabama because both regions are mountainous, but in some definitions they are different regions.

The Valley and Ridge Province of the Appalachians consist mainly of long, low ridges such as Red Mountain, Sand Mountain, Beaver Creek Mountain, Shades Mountain, and Coldwater Mountain in this region, and make impressive backdrops in the Greater Birmingham, Gadsden, and Anniston metropolitan areas. The easternmost part of Central Alabama around Anniston has the steepest mountains and highest elevations of the region. Coldwater Mountain and Mount Cheaha make up the highest of the mountain ridges that are located in the eastern portion of the region. The Coosa River divides the easternmost portion of the region from the central portion with the Birmingham area. The westernmost portion of Central Alabama is relatively a flat region with fertile black soil called the Black Belt. The Black Warrior River and its tributaries contribute to the fertile land of the area, and also serve as a demarcation line between the western and the central portions of the region. The central portion of Central Alabama varies from rugged in the east to flat in the west. Numerous valleys are scattered throughout this region between the mountain ridges including the densely populated Jones Valley and Shades Valley. Because the central portion is more rugged compared to the westernmost portion of Central Alabama, it is also the most flood-prone. Urban sprawl has exacerbated the risk of flooding by increasing the proportion of land covered by hard surfaces, leading to greater runoff during storms.

The Black Warrior, Cahaba, and Coosa Rivers and their tributaries are among the many waterways that wind their way through the region. Other major waterways that run through the area include Choccolocco Creek, Shades Creek, and Little Cahaba River.

Large deposits of iron ore, limestone, and coal are chief among the plentiful mineral resources found in the region. The coincidence of these three in close proximity was a major incentive for the rapid development of industry in the Birmingham District after the American Civil War.

== Economy ==
The economic engine of the region ranges from the diversified economy of Greater Birmingham, to the college town of Tuscaloosa, to the heavily industrialized economy of Anniston and Gadsden. 

The primary economic center of the region is Greater Birmingham because of its size and diversified economy. It is home to the state&#x27;s most diversified employer, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). UAB is not only the state&#x27;s largest single employer with some 20,000 employees on its payroll, but also one of the largest medical districts in the Southeast. In addition, most of the state-based corporations such as Alabama Power, Energen Corporation, HealthSouth Corporation, Regions Financial Corporation, Saks Incorporated, and Southern Research Institute have their world headquarters located in the area. Though the Mercedes-Benz and Honda automotive production facilities are not technically located in any of the Greater Birmingham metropolitan counties, they are both considered as substantial contributors to its economy. 

Tuscaloosa is the retail business center of a several-county area in Alabama and nearby Mississippi, and is chiefly a university town. The city hosts the University of Alabama&#x27;s main campus as well as Stillman College and Shelton State Community College. Other major components of the economy include government, health, and industry. The city&#x27;s largest industrial employer is the Mercedes-Benz production facility located ten miles from the main part of the city next to Vance. 

Anniston and Gadsden are very similar in their heavily industrialized economies. Gadsden, however, is a river town so it has helped in building and creating a tourist industry to slight the blow of its declining primary industry. Gadsden is now home to many riverfront-based festivals that goes on throughout the year to boost its economy. Anniston, on the other hand, has also suffered a major blow on two fronts with the closings of Fort McClellan and many iron smelting facilities in the 1990s. However, it has turned more towards military production at the Anniston Army Depot with several government production contracts issued to this facility.

<doc id="1301022" wikidata="Q205077" url="?curid=1301022" title="Cofferdam">
<text>A cofferdam is an enclosure built within a body of water to allow the enclosed area to be pumped out or drained. This pumping creates a dry working environment so that the work can be carried out safely. Cofferdams are commonly used for construction or repair of permanent dams, oil platforms, bridge piers, etc., built within water. They also form an integral part of naval architecture.

These cofferdams are usually welded steel structures, with components consisting of sheet piles, wales, and cross braces. Such structures are usually dismantled after the construction work is completed.

The origin of the word comes from &quot;coffer&quot; (originally from Latin meaning &#x27;basket&#x27;) and &quot;dam&quot; from Proto-Germanic meaning &#x27;barrier across a stream of water to obstruct its flow and raise its level&#x27;).

== Uses ==
For dam construction, two cofferdams are usually built, one upstream and one downstream of the proposed dam, after an alternative diversion tunnel or channel has been provided for the river flow to bypass the foundation area of the dam. These cofferdams are typically a conventional embankment dam of both earth- and rock-fill, but concrete or some sheet piling also may be used. Usually, upon completion of the dam and associated structures, the downstream coffer is removed and the upstream coffer is flooded as the diversion is closed and the reservoir begins to fill. Depending on the geography of a dam site, in some applications, a U-shaped cofferdam is used in the construction of one half of a dam. When complete, the cofferdam is removed and a similar one is created on the opposite side of the river for the construction of the dam&#x27;s other half.

Cofferdams are used in ship husbandry to allow dry access to underwater equipment and to close underwater openings while work is done on the fittings inside the ship. This is more common in naval vessels where a cofferdam may fit several vessels of a class.

The cofferdam is also used on occasion in the shipbuilding and ship repair industry, when it is not practical to put a ship in drydock for repair work or modernization. An example of such an application is the lengthening of ships. In some cases a ship is actually cut in two while still in the water, and a new section of ship is floated in to lengthen the ship. The cutting of the hull is done inside a cofferdam attached directly to the hull of the ship; the cofferdam is then detached before the hull sections are floated apart. The cofferdam is later replaced while the hull sections are welded together again. As expensive as this may be to accomplish, the use of a drydock might be even more expensive. 

Cofferdams are also used in some marine salvage operations. Cofferdams have been used to recover aircraft from water as well, as in the case of Avro Lancaster &quot;ED603&quot;, which was recovered from the IJsselmeer in 2023 using a cofferdam, allowing for close examination of the wreckage, as well as to locate and repatriate the remains of its crew.
===Examples===

A 100-ton open caisson that was lowered more than a mile to the sea floor in attempts to stop the flow of oil in the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; oil spill has been called a cofferdam.

A cofferdam over 1 mile long was built to permit the construction of the Livingstone Channel in the Detroit River. See main article at Stony Island.

The museum battleships USS &quot;Alabama&quot; (BB-60) and USS &quot;North Carolina&quot; (BB-55) have had cofferdams since 2003 and 2018, respectively. This saves much money compared to towing and dry docking them after the tow and this also provides additional security so there is a low chance of the ships sinking and becoming impossible to repair.

==Types==
Several types of structure performing this function can be distinguished, depending on how they are constructed and how they are used.

===Civil and coastal engineering===

In civil and costal engineering applications cofferdams are usually made from interlocking steel sheet piles which are driven deep into the bed of the water source in order to create a temporary dam behind which the engineering contractors can carry out their works. After the construction project is complete the sheet piles can then be removed and the area behind them rewetted.

===Naval architecture===

A cofferdam is a space between two watertight bulkheads or decks within a ship. It is usually a void (empty) space intended to ensure that the contents of nearly adjacent tanks cannot leak directly from one to the other which would result in contamination of the contents of one or both of the compartments. The cofferdam would be kept empty at all times and the ship may have sensors within it to warn if it has begun to fill with liquid. If two different cargoes that react dangerously with each other are carried on the same vessel, one or more cofferdams are usually required between the cargo spaces.

===Marine salvage===

When all or part of the main deck of a sunken ship is submerged, flooded spaces cannot be dewatered until all openings are sealed or the effective freeboard is extended above the high water level. One method of doing this is to build a temporary watertight extension of the entire hull of the ship, or the space to be dewatered, to the surface. This watertight extension is a cofferdam. Although they are temporary structures, cofferdams for this purpose have to be strongly built, adequately stiffened, and reinforced to withstand the hydrostatic and other loads that they will have to withstand. Large cofferdams are normally restricted to harbor operations.

Complete cofferdams cover most or all of the sunken vessel and are equivalent to extensions of the ship&#x27;s sides to above the water surface.

Partial cofferdams are constructed around moderate-sized
openings or areas such as a cargo hatch or small deckhouse. They can often be prefabricated and installed as a unit, or prefabricated panels can be joined during erection. When partial cofferdams are used, it may be necessary to compensate for hydrostatic pressure on the deck by shoring the decks. With both complete and partial cofferdams, there is usually a large free surface in the spaces being pumped. Sometimes this can be limited by dewatering one compartment at a time, or in groups, taking into account the beam strength loads on the ship induced by the load distribution.

Small cofferdams are used for pumping or to allow salvors
access to spaces that are covered by water at some stage of the tide. They are usually prefabricated and fitted
around minor openings.

Diving work on cofferdams often involves clearing obstructions, fitting, and fastening, including underwater welding, and where necessary, caulking, bracing and shoring the adjacent structure.

===Ship husbandry===

There are two common types of dry chambers used in underwater ship husbandry. Open bottom cofferdams allow divers direct access to the enclosed hull area, system, or opening. The flange sides of the chamber secure and seal against the hull, acting as an airtight boundary. Open bottom cofferdams are typically used as diver work space for rigging or welding and ventilation for welding or epoxy cure, where there is no opening to the interior of the vessel, or the interior is pressurised in this area. The air space is at the pressure of the water surface at the bottom of the chamber. Open top cofferdams allow surface access to the work area below the waterline, and are at atmospheric pressure. Openings through the hull to the interior of the ship are possible.

===Portable cofferdams===
Portable cofferdams can be inflatable or frame and fabric cofferdams that can be reused. Inflatable cofferdams are stretched across the site, then inflated with water from the prospected dry area. Frame and fabric cofferdams are erected in the water and covered with watertight fabric. Once the area is dry, water still remaining from the dry area can be siphoned over to the wet area.

<doc id="1301026" wikidata="Q897993" url="?curid=1301026" title="Dongzhi Festival">
<text>The Dongzhi Festival or Winter Solstice Festival is a traditional Chinese festival celebrated during the Dongzhi solar term (winter solstice), which falls between December 21 and December 23.

The origins of this festival can be traced back to the yin and yang philosophy of balance and harmony in the cosmos. After this celebration, it is believed that days will have longer daylight hours and therefore create an increase in positive energy flowing in. The philosophical significance of this is symbolized by the I Ching hexagram &quot;fu&quot; (, &quot;Returning&quot;).

==Traditional activities==

In Chinese, the word &quot;Dong&quot; means &quot;winter&quot; while &quot;Zhi&quot; means &quot;arrival&quot; giving the literal meaning of the festival &quot;the coming of winter&quot;. Dongzhi celebrates the winter solstice, usually around December 21 to 23, and is observed on the longest night of the year. Symbolizing the victory of light over darkness, Dongzhi, represents that the days will start to grow longer and bring a sense of balance and harmony to people&#x27;s lives. Based on Chinese beliefs of yin yang, &quot;Yang&quot; represents positive energy, warmth, and light. Following the Dongzhi Festival, daytime will gradually lengthen, as &quot;Yang&quot; will also increase. It was also believed by some that it was the day the Kitchen God went to heaven to report to the Jade Emperor the conduct of a family.

The festival was first celebrated by the Chinese people during the Zhou dynasty (1045 BCE–256 BCE) and declared an official celebration during the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE). The Han people would take a break from work to celebrate with their families. They would hold heaven worshipping as well as honoring their ancestors by burning joss paper at their ancestral shrines to show gratitude. In ancient times, the day was also known as the &quot;festival of extreme length () as the sun&#x27;s extreme position lengthens shadows. It was traditionally a very important holiday, comparable to Chinese New Year.

The Chinese people still celebrate certain practices during the Dongzhi festival, such as the union of family. In Hong Kong, many businesses let employees off early to spend time with their families on this day, while in some areas shops close for the holiday. In Suzhou, it is traditional to light incense at dawn.

The Dongzhi Festival has historically been associated with various agricultural activities in China, particularly in rural areas. As the festival represents the winter solstice, it is a crucial time to harvest winter crops, such as wheat, barley, and radishes. It is also an important time to pay respect to certain livestock and feed these animals special meals to celebrate the occasion.

Traditionally, the Dongzhi Festival is a time for families to eat together. One activity that occurs during these get-togethers (especially in the Asia and in Overseas Asian communities) is the making and eating of &quot;tangyuan&quot; (湯圓) or balls of glutinous rice, which symbolize reunion. &quot;Tangyuan&quot; are made of glutinous rice flour and are sometimes coloured pink or green. Each family member receives at least one large &quot;tangyuan&quot; in addition to several small ones. The flour balls are cooked in a sweet soup or savory broth with both the ball and the soup/broth served in one bowl. It is also often served with &quot;jiuniang,&quot; a mildly alcoholic, unfiltered rice wine containing whole grains of glutinous rice (and often also sweet osmanthus flowers).

People typically eat Winter Solstice dumplings (), which sounds like &quot;reunion&quot;. This custom is said to have been started by the celebrated physician Zhang Zhongjing during the Han dynasty. One cold winter&#x27;s day, he noticed that the poor were afflicted with chilblains on their ears. Moved to pity, he ordered his apprentices to make dumplings with lamb and other ingredients, and distribute them among the poor to keep them warm and prevent their ears from getting chilblains. Since the dumplings were shaped like ears, Zhang named the dish &quot;qùhán jiāoěr tāng&quot; (祛寒嬌耳湯) or dumpling soup that expels the cold. From that time on, it has been a tradition to eat dumplings on the day of Dongzhi. Dumplings are not only eaten by the family, but also shared with friends and relatives as a blessing. The dumplings may be molded into the shapes of animals such as dogs and cats. Common superstitions include that married people should leave two uneaten to have their wishes come true, and a single person should leave one for an auspicious year. According to one tradition, the dumplings should be eaten by an even number of people for good luck. Many people take some of the &quot;tangyuan&quot; that have been used as offerings and stick them on the back of the door or on windows and tables and other pieces of furniture. These &quot;empowered&quot; &quot;tangyuan&quot; serve as protective talismans to keep evil spirits away from children.

Old traditions also require people with the same surname or from the same clan to gather at their ancestral temples to worship on this day. There is always a grand reunion dinner following the sacrificial ceremony.

Other traditional foods include hot pot and wontons. &quot;Shuijiao&quot; dumplings are popular in northern China.

The festive food is also a reminder that celebrators are now a year older and should behave better in the coming year. Even today, many Chinese around the world, especially the elderly, still insist that one is &quot;a year older&quot; right after the Dongzhi celebration instead of waiting for the Chinese New Year.

===In Taiwan===

In Taiwan, like in the culturally related province of Fujian, Dongzhi is a day for spending time with families and making offerings to ancestors. It is also a tradition for Taiwanese to eat &quot;tangyuan&quot; on this day. They also use the festive food as an offering dish to worship the ancestors.

As well as following some of the customs practiced on mainland China, the people of Taiwan have a unique custom of offering nine-layer cakes as a ceremonial sacrifice to worship their ancestors. These cakes are made using glutinous rice flour in the shape of a chicken, duck, tortoise, pig, cow, or sheep, and then steamed in different layers of a pot. These animals all signify auspiciousness in Chinese tradition.

Many people take invigorating tonic foods during this particular winter festival. To the Taiwanese, winter is a time when most physical activities should be limited and you should eat well to nourish your body. This practice follows the habits shown by many animals which follow the law of nature and hibernate throughout winter months to rejuvenate and to preserve life. In order to fight cold temperatures, it is necessary to eat more fatty and meaty foods during winter when your body can better absorb the rich and nutritional foods at this time due to a slower metabolic rate.

Since Dongzhi is the &quot;extreme of winter&quot;, Taiwanese regard it as the best time of the year to take tonic foods. Some of the most widely popular winter tonic foods enjoyed by Taiwanese to fight cold and strengthen the body&#x27;s resistance are mutton hot pot and ginger duck hot pot. Other foods like chicken, pork, and abalone are also common ingredients used in making tonic foods with nurturing herbs such as ginseng, deer horn, and the fungus cordyceps.

Abernathy was a member of the Washington Senators (1955–57, 1960), Cleveland Indians (1963–64), Chicago Cubs (1965–66, 1969–70), Atlanta Braves (1966), Cincinnati Reds (1967–68), St. Louis Cardinals (1970) and Kansas City Royals (1970–72). He compiled a 63–69 record with 765 strikeouts and a 3.46 ERA in 1,147 innings pitched. He gave up 1,010 hits and permitted 592 bases on balls.

A native of Stanley, North Carolina, Abernathy was born on March 6, 1933, to Wade and Genora (McGinnis) Abernathy. He graduated from Stanley High School and signed with the Senators in 1952. In 1953 he married Margie Clemmer. The couple had two sons, Ted Jr. and Todd.

==Pitching career==
Abernathy changed his pitching motion from an overhead delivery to a three-quarter delivery after tearing two muscles in his shoulder making a throw from the outfield during his freshman year of high school. After shoulder surgery in 1959 left his career in doubt, he switched from the three-quarter delivery and become an effective sidearmer who developed a submarine pitch. Abernathy spent two years in the minor leagues before being called up by the Senators in April 1955. Throughout most of the 1950s, he split time between the Senators&#x27; major league squad and their farm system.

During the Korean War, Abernathy was drafted into the U.S. Army, serving with medics, driving an ambulance and repairing vehicles. He served at Fort McPherson, Georgia. Abernathy was discharged as a corporal in time to join the Senators for 1955 spring training. He made his Major League debut for the Senators at age 22 on April 13, 1955, in 19–1 loss to the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium. In the fourth inning, Abernathy relieved Mickey McDermott and struck out Andy Carey before giving up a home run to Mickey Mantle followed by a groundout by Yogi Berra. Every one of his 34 MLB starting pitcher assignments came with the 1955–57 Senators, a struggling, second-division team in the American League. Abernathy threw seven complete games and two shutouts as a starter, but won only eight of 30 decisions during that three-year period.

Apart from two games with Washington in , Abernathy spent five years (1958–62) toiling in minor league baseball before returning to the majors as a bullpen ace for the 1963 Indians. Sold to the Cubs in April 1965, Abernathy recorded a league-leading 31 saves (again for a second-division team), along with 104 strikeouts and a 2.57 ERA. He had 28 saves, 88 strikeouts, and a 1.27 ERA two seasons later with Cincinnati. In both 1965 and 1967, he led the league in saves, and won the &quot;TSN&quot; Reliever of the Year Award. In , Abernathy won 10 games with 13 saves, and had 10 wins and 14 saves in . He led the National League in games pitched three times: 1965 (with 84, a major-league record at the time), 1967 and 1968.

==After baseball==
After retiring from the game, Abernathy worked at Summey Building Systems in Dallas, North Carolina, and later worked with his son at his landscaping business, Todd Abernathy Landscaping, and was a member of the First United Methodist Church of Dallas. He enjoyed playing softball and tinkering with old cars and was active in several organizations including the Masonic Lodge, the Shriners and Major League Baseball&#x27;s alumni society.

During his later years, Abernathy suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and lived at the Belaire Health Care Center in Gastonia, North Carolina. Ted Abernathy died at age 71 on December 16, 2004, in Gastonia. He is interred at the Garden of Four Seasons in Gaston Memorial Park, Gastonia, North Carolina.

<doc id="1301031" wikidata="Q664291" url="?curid=1301031" title="Larry Rivers">
<text>Larry Rivers (born Yitzroch Loiza Grossberg; August 17, 1923 – August 14, 2002) was an American artist, musician, filmmaker, and occasional actor. Considered by many scholars to be the &quot;Godfather&quot; and &quot;Grandfather&quot; of Pop art, he was one of the first artists to merge non-objective, non-narrative art with narrative and objective abstraction.

==Career==

Larry Rivers was born as Yitzroch Loiza Grossberg in the Bronx, New York, in the family of Jewish immigrants from Ukraine. Rivers took up painting in 1945 and studied at the Hans Hofmann School from 1947 through 1948. He earned a BA in art education from New York University in 1951.

His work was quickly acquired by the Museum of Modern Art. A 1953 painting &quot;Washington Crossing the Delaware&quot; was damaged in fire at the museum five years later.

He was a pop artist of the New York School, reproducing everyday objects of American popular culture as art. He was one of eleven New York artists featured in the opening exhibition at the Terrain Gallery in 1955.

He has been contextualised as working out of the Abstract expressionist legacy of Willem de Kooning, &quot;adapting the freedom of the Abstract Expressionist technique towards figurative ends.&quot;

During the early 1960s Rivers lived in Manhattan&#x27;s Hotel Chelsea, notable for its artistic residents such as Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin, Leonard Cohen, Arthur C. Clarke, Dylan Thomas, Sid Vicious and multiple people associated with Andy Warhol&#x27;s Factory and where he brought several of his French nouveau réalistes friends like Yves Klein who wrote there in April 1961 his &quot;Manifeste de l&#x27;hôtel Chelsea&quot;, Arman, Martial Raysse, Jean Tinguely, Niki de Saint-Phalle, Christo, Daniel Spoerri or Alain Jacquet, several of whom, like Rivers, left some pieces of art in the lobby of the hotel for payment of their rooms. In 1965, Rivers had his first comprehensive retrospective in five important American museums. 

His final work for the exhibition was &quot;The History of the Russian Revolution&quot;, which was later on extended permanent display at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, DC. He spent 1967 in London collaborating with the American painter Howard Kanovitz.

In 1967, Rivers traveled to Africa for a second time with Pierre Dominique Gaisseau to finish their documentary &quot;Africa and I&quot;, which was a part of the groundbreaking NBC series &quot;Experiments in Television&quot;. During this trip they narrowly escaped execution as suspected mercenaries.

During the 1970s, Rivers worked closely with Diana Molinari and Michel Auder on many video tape projects, including the infamous &quot;Tits&quot;, and also worked in neon.

Rivers&#x27;s legs appeared in John Lennon and Yoko Ono&#x27;s 1971 film &quot;Up Your Legs Forever&quot;.

In 1971, he curated &quot;Some American History&quot; at the Institute for the Arts at Rice University in Houston, where his own work was exhibited alongside that of African-American artists Ellsworth Ausby, Peter Bradley, Frank Bowling, Daniel LaRue Johnson, Joe Overstreet, and William T. Williams. The exhibition, which intended to focus on violence against African-Americans, was widely criticized by national press along with the black artists whose work was shown, many of whom felt that Rivers&#x27; curation focused on his own experiences as a non-black person instead of uplifting and highlighting the perspectives of the black artists who had experienced the racism the show was supposed to foreground.

==Music==
Between 1940 and 1945, he worked as a jazz saxophonist in New York City; he changed his name to Larry Rivers in 1940 after being introduced as &quot;Larry Rivers and the Mudcats&quot;. He studied at the Juilliard School of Music in 1945–46, along with Miles Davis, with whom he remained friends until Davis&#x27;s death in 1991.

==Personal life==
Larry Rivers was born in the Bronx to Samuel and Sonya Grossberg, Jewish immigrants from Ukraine. He changed his name to Rivers in 1940 at the start of his career as jazz saxophonist.

In 1945, he married Augusta Berger, and they had one son, Steven. Rivers also adopted Joseph, Berger&#x27;s son from a previous relationship, and reared both children after the couple divorced. He lived with his mother-in-law, Berdie Burger, who was a favorite model of his, in Southampton, Long Island, from 1953 through 1957.

In 1961, he married Clarice Price, a Welsh school teacher, who cared for his two sons. The couple had two daughters together, Gwynne and Emma, but the relationship lasted only six years before Larry and Clarice separated. 

Shortly after, he lived and collaborated with Diana Molinari, who featured in many of his works of the 1970s.

Rivers then lived with Sheila Lanham, a Baltimore artist and poet.

In the early 1980s, Rivers and East Village figurative painter Daria Deshuk (1956–2017) lived together and, in 1985, they produced a son, Sam Deshuk Rivers. They remained good friends until Rivers&#x27;s death.

Rivers also maintained a relationship with poet Frank O&#x27;Hara in the late 1950s and delivered the eulogy at O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s funeral, in 1966.

Throughout his career, the artist maintained studios in New York City; Southampton, Long Island; and Zihuatanejo, Mexico.

Rivers died in 2002, leaving behind his five children and then companion, poet Jeni Olin.

==Legacy==
His primary gallery was the Marlborough Gallery in New York City. In 2002, a major retrospective of Rivers&#x27;s work was held at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. New York University bought correspondences and other documents from the Larry Rivers Foundation to house in their archive. However, his daughters Gwynne and Emma objected to one particular film being displayed, as it depicts them naked as children and adolescents. The film&#x27;s purpose is supposedly the documentation of their growth through puberty, but it was made when they were not consenting adults. The matter was addressed in the December 2010 issue of the magazine &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, and the October 2010 issue of &quot;Grazia&quot;. The film will never be publicly displayed as requested by both children.

<doc id="1301040" wikidata="Q889216" url="?curid=1301040" title="Paul E. Patton">
<text>Paul Edward Patton (born May 26, 1937) is an American politician who served as the 59th governor of Kentucky from 1995 to 2003. Because of a 1992 amendment to the Kentucky Constitution, he was the first governor eligible to run for a second term in office, since James Garrard, in 1800. Since 2013, he has been the chancellor of the University of Pikeville in Pikeville, Kentucky, after serving as its president from 2010 to 2013. He also served as chairman of the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education from 2009 to 2011.

After graduating from the University of Kentucky in 1959, Patton became wealthy by operating coal mines for 20 years. He sold most of his coal interests, in the late 1970s, and he entered politics, serving, briefly, in the cabinet of Governor John Y. Brown Jr. and chairing the state Democratic Party. In 1981, he was elected judge/executive of Pike County. He made an unsuccessful bid for lieutenant governor in 1987, but he was elected in 1991, serving, concurrently, as lieutenant governor and secretary of economic development, under Governor Brereton Jones.

Four years later, Patton was elected Governor, over Larry Forgy. The major achievement of his first term was overhauling higher education, including making the state&#x27;s community colleges and technical schools independent of the University of Kentucky and organizing them into the Kentucky Community and Technical College System. Shortly after Patton turned back a weak challenge to his re-election in 1999, two Democratic state senators defected to the Republican Party, giving Republicans an unprecedented majority in that legislative house. The economic prosperity that fueled Patton&#x27;s first term success faded into a recession in the early 2000s. Faced with a hostile legislature and a dire economic forecast, Patton was unable to enact much significant legislation in his second term, and his situation was exacerbated, in 2002, when news of an extramarital affair and allegations of a sex-for-favors scandal broke. After initially denying the affair, Patton later admitted to it, but he continued to deny using his office to benefit his mistress. Later in his term, Patton was attacked for pardoning four of his political advisers who were indicted for violating Kentucky&#x27;s campaign finance laws and for allegedly abusing his patronage powers. These successive scandals derailed any further political aspirations.

==Early life and education==
Patton was born in Fallsburg, Kentucky, on May 26, 1937, in a retrofitted silo with no indoor plumbing, electricity, or telephone. He was the only son of the three children born to Ward and Irene Patton. The family moved, often, because Ward Patton, a teacher, was assigned to a different school every year. When he was hired by a railroad in Pike County, he and his wife agreed that she would remain in Fallsburg with the children, until they finished school. Patton attended Fallsburg Elementary School, a four-room schoolhouse in his hometown. He was active in the 4-H club, where he began to develop his public speaking ability. In 1951, he enrolled at Louisa High School in Louisa, Kentucky. He was an honor student, a member of the drama club, a football and baseball player, and class president, during his senior year. In 1955, he graduated with the third-highest grade point average in his class of 73.

After high school, Patton attended the University of Kentucky. During the spring of 1956, he was initiated into the Kappa Sigma fraternity. Later that year, he unsuccessfully sought a seat in the Student Government Association. In 1959, he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering. He was later awarded an honorary Doctor of Public Service degree from the University of Louisville.

== Career ==

===Coal industry===
In 1959, after graduation, Patton began work as a day laborer picking slate for the Sizemore Mining Corporation that was owned by his father-in-law. In 1961, he moved to Virgie and founded the Elkhorn Coal Company, with his brother-in-law. In 1972, he purchased Chapperal Coal Company and became extremely wealthy during the coal boom that resulted from the 1973 oil crisis. He sold Chapperal in 1978 and then helped develop Campbell Coal and Oil Supply into a major supply outlet in the eastern part of the state. He became a leader in the coal industry, serving on the board of directors of the Kentucky Coal Association, chairing the Board of the National Independent Coal Operators Association, and becoming a member of the Kentucky Deep Mine Safety Commission. He denounced the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 as &quot;right in its diagnosis of the problem but wrong in prescription for the cure&quot;. By 1976, he had become president of the National Independent Coal Operators Association. He railed against a federal regulation that would prohibit strip mining on slopes of greater than 20 degrees, which would have effectively ended that method of mining in the Eastern Mountain Coal Fields and lamented the economic disadvantage imposed on Kentucky coal miners by the state&#x27;s coal severance tax.

Patton was regarded as more moderate than most coal operators, in his relationship to labor unions. Most of his mine workers were not unionized, and those who were generally belonged to the Southern Labor Union, rather than the more confrontational United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). Members of the UMWA local at Shelby Gap maintained that Patton was arrested for clipping a striking miner on a picket line with his pickup truck in the late 1970s. Local law enforcement officials claim no recollection of the incident, and there is no record of an arrest warrant against Patton or an actual arrest.

On October 18, 1976, Patton filed for divorce from Carol Cooley, saying only that their marriage was irretrievably broken. The divorce was final on February 25, 1977. Later that year, Patton married Judi Jane Conway of Pikeville, a secretary at his Kentucky Elkhorn mine. In 1973, Conway had divorced her first husband, Bill Harvey Johnson, with whom she had two children.

===Politics===
Patton was introduced to politics by State Senator Kelsey Friend, who arranged for Patton to be a delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention. Friend also convinced Patton to help raise money for Walter &quot;Dee&quot; Huddleston&#x27;s congressional campaign.

As the coal boom began to wane, Patton sold most of his coal interests in 1978. After a meeting with allies of his friend First District Congressman Carroll Hubbard in Madisonville on September 20, 1978, Patton considered a run for governor in 1979. However, he subsequently decided that he lacked the time to organize a campaign before the May primary election; a letter leaked to &quot;The Paducah Sun&quot; showed that he believed he was losing Hubbard&#x27;s support. He joined Terry McBrayer&#x27;s campaign, during the primary, and after McBrayer lost, he worked to elect John Y. Brown Jr., the Democratic nominee. Brown won the election, and Patton was appointed deputy secretary of transportation. He served only three months, before resigning to protest Brown&#x27;s proposal for a coal severance tax.

In late 1981, Brown asked Patton to become vice-chair of the Kentucky Democratic Party. He would serve under Dale Sights of Henderson. Brown then informed Patton that there had been a change of plans: he had decided to appoint his father, former U.S. Representative John Y. Brown Sr. to the chair, instead of Sights. Brown&#x27;s advisers convinced him that this would be politically damaging; finally, Brown appointed Patton chair, with June Taylor, daughter of former governor Ruby Laffoon, as vice-chair. The announcement was a surprise to most political observers, as Sights had been the odds-on favorite for the chairmanship. Patton served as chairman until 1983. During his tenure, he learned much about politics from Taylor and was introduced to Andrew &quot;Skipper&quot; Martin of Louisville, who would later become an important adviser and ally.

====Pike County judge/executive====
In 1981, Patton ran for county judge/executive of Pike County. On the way to a victory in the Democratic primary, he outspent incumbent Wayne Rutherford $191,252 to $49,000. In the general election, he garnered more than 75 percent of the vote against Republican challenger Jim Polley.

Within six months of his election, Patton instituted the state&#x27;s first mandatory, county-wide garbage collection program, to combat illegal garbage dumping, which was rampant in the county. The program won Patton statewide acclaim. When Patton sought re-election in 1985, he, again, faced Rutherford in the Democratic primary. Rutherford campaigned against the garbage-collection program, promising to repeal it, if elected. This stance may have hurt him, because although some county residents resented the mandatory fee for garbage pick-up, many more recognized the benefits, as illegal dump sites became less common. Patton won the primary, again, and he went on to re-election. However, he won both races by much smaller margins than in 1981 (2,524 votes in the primary and 3,916 votes in the general election).

In his second term, Patton initiated an oil recycling program and established a work program for welfare mothers in day care centers. He oversaw construction of a new jail and a $5 million renovation to the county courthouse. He brought the county its first manufacturing company and stopped the practice of giving away gravel, drains, and bridge lumber from district warehouses to private citizens. Among his other priorities as judge/executive were the construction of rural roads and recreation facilities.

In 1987, Patton ran for Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky. In a crowded primary, his 130,713 votes placed him third, behind Brereton Jones (189,058 votes) and Attorney General David L. Armstrong (147,718 votes), but ahead of state senator David Boswell and Superintendent of Public Instruction Alice McDonald. In the most expensive primary in Kentucky history, at that point, Patton spent more than $2 million of his personal fortune, but he was outspent by Jones, who committed more than $3 million to the campaign. By comparison, Martha Layne Collins had spent $140,000 to win the office in 1979 and Steve Beshear $250,000 to win it in 1983.

Following his defeat, Patton returned to Pike County. In 1989 he was re-elected for a third term as judge/executive, receiving over 70 percent of the vote in a three-way Democratic primary and subsequently winning the general election by nearly a three-to-one margin. He immediately began preparing for another run for lieutenant governor in 1991. In the earlier campaign, the UMWA had been vociferously opposed to Patton, because employees in his coal mines had been affiliated with the Southern Labor Union. Skipper Martin introduced him to Teamsters leaders, and Patton worked with them to unionize Pike County employees. He also worked with Kelsey Friend to pass the Kentucky Rural Economic Development Act, a measure giving financial incentives to companies that located in economically depressed rural counties.

====Lieutenant governor====
Patton sought the office of lieutenant governor, again, in 1991. In a crowded seven-candidate field in the Democratic primary, the front runner was Attorney General Fred Cowan of Louisville. Other candidates included Steve Collins, son of former governor Martha Layne Collins, and former Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives Bobby H. Richardson. Just days before the primary, it was reported that Cowan&#x27;s campaign had sought funds from a company that his office was investigating for criminal conduct. Patton beat Cowan by a margin of 146,102 votes to 104,337.

In the general election, Patton faced Republican Eugene Goss. Goss criticized Patton for announcing that, if elected, he would seek the governor&#x27;s office at the expiration of his term. Goss insisted that he would not seek the governorship, if elected, and he maintained that using the lieutenant governor&#x27;s post as a stepping stone to the governor&#x27;s office was a betrayal of the office and its authority. Goss ran an unorthodox campaign, limiting individual contributions to his campaign to $300 and refusing to run television commercials. Patton went on to a lopsided victory in the general election, winning 514,023 votes to Goss&#x27;s 250,857.

Upon his election as lieutenant governor, Patton resigned his office as Pike County judge-executive. While presiding over the Senate in the 1991 legislative session, Patton voted against a mandatory seat belt law, breaking a 19–19 tie. He was the last Kentucky lieutenant governor to preside over the Kentucky Senate; a 1992 amendment to the state constitution created a new position, President of the Kentucky Senate, and relieved the lieutenant governor of his duties in that body.

In November 1991, Governor Brereton Jones appointed Patton as secretary of economic development, making Patton the first lieutenant governor to serve as an appointed cabinet secretary. In this capacity, he encouraged the use of tax incentives to bring new industry to the state. Bill Bishop, a journalist for the &quot;Lexington Herald-Leader&quot;, criticized these incentives, saying that Patton, too often, used them to attract low-wage jobs. In response, Patton wrote a series of essays. While he never published them in the newspaper, he later compiled them into a book entitled &quot;Kentucky&#x27;s Approach to Economic Development&quot;. He also reorganized Kentucky economic development efforts, securing the adoption of four new development incentive programs and establishing the Kentucky Economic Development Partnership.

===1995 gubernatorial election===

At the expiration of his term as lieutenant governor in 1995, Patton announced his candidacy for governor. The 1995 gubernatorial election was novel, in several ways, following a 1992 constitutional amendment. It was the first election in Kentucky history in which the governor and lieutenant governor were elected as a ticket. Another new provision stated that if no candidate received at least 40 percent of the vote in his or her party&#x27;s primary, a runoff election would occur between the top two candidates. Most significantly, for the first time in Kentucky history, the winners of each race would be allowed to succeed themselves in office and serve another term. Also, as a result of campaign finance reform passed under Governor Jones, candidates would receive public campaign financing and would have their campaign spending capped, negating the advantage of wealthy candidates.

Patton chose Steve Henry, a surgeon and county commissioner from Louisville, as his running mate. His major opposition in the Democratic primary came from secretary of state Bob Babbage and President Pro Tempore of the Kentucky Senate John &quot;Eck&quot; Rose. Although sitting governor Brereton Jones did not officially endorse Patton, Rose referred to Jones as Patton&#x27;s &quot;mentor&quot;. Rose charged that, like Jones, Patton would not take a hard stand on the issues. Referring to a nickname given to Jones in the 1991 campaign, Rose remarked &quot;If you have liked Jell-O Jones, then you are going to be in a position to love Puddin&#x27; Paul Patton.&quot; Particularly odious to Rose was that Patton had publicly supported collective wage bargaining for public employees, but he had declared that he would not fight for it, in the upcoming 1996 legislative session. Though Babbage and Rose were political veterans and solid campaigners, Patton won 152,203 votes in the primary, well over the 40 percent needed to avoid a runoff. Babbage ran second with 81,352 votes and Rose was third with 71,740 votes. Two other candidates split the remaining 33,344 votes.

Patton entered the general election as a perceived underdog. The previous year, Republicans had taken over both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, and for the first time in decades, a majority of Kentucky&#x27;s congressional delegation was Republican. State Democrats were also tainted by the Operation Boptrot investigation that sent many of their legislators, including House Speaker Don Blandford, to prison for political corruption. With Democrats in charge of state government for the previous 24 years, Patton feared that the &quot;time for a change&quot; argument would resonate with voters.

Patton&#x27;s opponent, Republican Larry Forgy, hurt his campaign by aligning himself with the Christian right, alienating moderates in both parties, particularly in Louisville. He also openly opposed the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA), which was passed in 1990, during the administration of Wallace G. Wilkinson. Republican supporters of education reform deserted his campaign and helped form a bi-partisan coalition supporting KERA. Traditional Democratic voting blocs such as organized labor and African-Americans turned out, in force, for Patton. To further undermine Forgy, Patton reminded voters of the budget cuts by Congressional Republicans to programs affecting the elderly. These issues ultimately delivered a Patton victory of 500,787 votes to 479,227. It was the closest Kentucky gubernatorial election in 32 years, and it marked the first time an eastern Kentuckian had won the governorship since Bert T. Combs in 1959.

=== Governor of Kentucky ===

====First term (1995–1999)====
Though Patton had ambitions to enact education reform, early in his administration, his financial adviser, James R. Ramsey, convinced him to propose a conservative budget in the first legislative session. The two developed a plan to modernize the state government, making it more efficient. State employees were leery of increased efficiency, believing it was a code word for cutting state jobs. Patton dispelled this notion, by promising no involuntary layoffs. Patton also anticipated difficulty persuading legislators to invest an estimated $100 million in equipment and processes to realize improved efficiency. However, when economists projected a budget surplus for 1996, Patton agreed to invest half of it in capital projects, in exchange for using the other half for measures to improve government efficiency. Patton formed an Office for Technology and made improvements in the compatibility and interoperability of the state&#x27;s computer systems that were recommended by his son, Chris. Investments of $23.3 million yielded a return of $300 million in state revenue. By the time Patton&#x27;s efficiency program was fully implemented, the state was realizing an annual return of 75 cents for every dollar initially invested.

In December 1996, Patton called a special legislative session to consider the issue of worker&#x27;s compensation reform. Both Patton and the state&#x27;s legislators believed that the generous benefits, provided under Kentucky state law, created an unfavorable business climate in the state. The reform measures adopted in the special session included a substantial reduction in benefits, including those to coal miners who developed black lung disease. Patton&#x27;s support of this measure alienated labor leaders, especially in eastern Kentucky&#x27;s coal mining communities – which had previously been among his strongest supporters. As the law began to take effect, Patton, himself, agreed that it had gone too far, and his Secretary of Labor worked with representatives from organized labor to draft changes in the law. Those changes were eventually made in the 2002 legislative session.

=====Education reform=====
In the 1997 legislature, Patton began his mission of reforming the state&#x27;s system of higher education. Noting that the state&#x27;s community colleges, under the control of the University of Kentucky and technical schools, under the control of the state government, were too often competing with each other in the same community, he proposed removing the community colleges from the university&#x27;s control. Part of the plan was upgrading the technical schools to colleges, allowing them to award associate&#x27;s degrees, not just diplomas and certificates. Control of the community and technical colleges would be invested in a new entity, the Kentucky Community and Technical College System. Patton believed that severing the community colleges from the University of Kentucky would allow the university to reallocate resources toward becoming a &quot;Top 20&quot; research university in the nation. The plan also charged the University of Louisville with becoming a nationally recognized urban university. The state&#x27;s Council on Postsecondary Education (CPE) would help eliminate duplication of programs among the colleges and oversee the improvements in the state&#x27;s two major universities. In addition, the CPE was to oversee the formation of a &quot;Commonwealth Virtual University&quot; that would serve as a clearinghouse for all the distance learning opportunities offered by the colleges and universities of Kentucky. The new CPE president, Gordon K. Davies, appointed former University of Kentucky engineering faculty and then Databeam Corp. co-founder Lee T. Todd to chair the new Distance Learning Task Force which created the Kentucky Virtual University (now the Kentucky Virtual Campus) and the Kentucky Virtual Library, and worked with the Kentucky Department of Education to create the Kentucky Virtual High School (now the Kentucky Virtual Schools). Patton&#x27;s plan was outlined in the Kentucky Postsecondary Education Improvement Act of 1997, nicknamed House Bill 1.

While supported by the state&#x27;s smaller, regional universities, House Bill 1 immediately drew the ire of University of Kentucky president Charles T. Wethington Jr. Before becoming university president, Wethington had administered the community-college system. Most of the community colleges and the constituencies in their communities also opposed the plan. The university and the community colleges ran advertisements, encouraging opposition to the plan; Patton characterized these ads as &quot;mean&quot;. Patton was disappointed when Greg Stumbo, a leader in the Kentucky House of Representatives and former advocate of an independent community-college system, announced his opposition the plan. Stumbo represented the community of Prestonsburg, an eastern Kentucky coal mining town, and Patton surmised that he was still angry about the worker&#x27;s compensation bill. Prestonsburg was also the home of Prestonsburg Community College (now Big Sandy Community and Technical College). In the face of this opposition, Patton negotiated with individual legislators, until he was convinced that he had a majority in both houses of the Kentucky General Assembly. He, then, pushed forward and was able to get the legislation passed.

In addition to this victory, Patton also secured passage of other higher education measures. In the 1998 legislative session, he proposed a $100 million bond issue to fund the Research Challenge Trust Fund, a fund that the state&#x27;s universities could tap to hire researchers for special projects. The program, later nicknamed &quot;Bucks for Brains,” required the universities to match any resources leveraged from the fund, dollar-for-dollar. The 1998 legislature also approved funding for the Kentucky Educational Excellence Scholarship (KEES) program, which channeled money from the Kentucky Lottery into a special fund for scholarships. To qualify for a KEES scholarship, students have to score at least a 2.5 grade point average in high school and attend a college or university in Kentucky. Awards are made on a sliding scale, with factors such as high school grades, scores on college entrance exams, and continued academic success in college affecting the amount of the award, which is renewable for up to eight college terms.

Patton&#x27;s education reforms were not confined to higher education. He also sought to make changes to the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA) that would mollify its critics, without gutting the law, itself. One of the major complaints, regarding KERA, was the inability to compare the scores to those from other states, to determine progress relative to the rest of the nation. Opponents of KERA in the Senate passed a bill to eliminate the testing, until something better could be implemented. In the House, a more moderate measure was advanced, which added a component to the testing system that would allow students to be compared to national norms. Patton supported the House version of the bill, which ultimately emerged from the conference committee and was enacted into law. The administration&#x27;s strong support of KERA kept the legislation from being seriously challenged, again, during Patton&#x27;s term. One notable exception occurred in 2000, when legislators tried to repeal the anti-nepotism provision regarding school hiring. The measure passed both houses of the legislature, but Patton vetoed it.

The passage of his higher education reforms led to Patton becoming the chairman of the Southern Regional Education Board from 1997 to 1998. In 1999, he was chosen chairman of the Education Commission of the States. Other educational organizations, then, sought Patton&#x27;s leadership; he chaired the National Education Goals Panel and was chosen by the U.S. Secretary of Education to lead a commission to study the high-school senior year.

In the 1998 legislative session, the state enjoyed a $200 million budget surplus. Patton was able to distribute this surplus to legislative allies, giving him substantial leverage for his proposals. As one legislative leader opined, &quot;Money buys a lot of silence.&quot; Legislators were also reluctant to oppose the administration for fear that Patton would be re-elected in 1999. Consequently, Patton was able to gain approval of a very ambitious legislative agenda in 1998, including tougher criminal laws, improved economic development, reform for Medicaid, and further reform of the higher-education system. Patton also used some of the budget surplus to provide computers for public classrooms. Because of Patton&#x27;s commitment to education, Kentucky was the first state in the nation to have every public school classroom wired to the Internet. Once this was accomplished, Patton charged his education secretary, Ed Ford, with developing the Kentucky Virtual High School, a system of distance education that would allow students in smaller high schools in Kentucky to have access to courses in foreign languages and other subjects offered only at larger high schools. The virtual high school was brought online m, in January 2000.

The last plank in Patton&#x27;s education platform was the improvement of adult education. This issue allowed him to work with a political foe, Republican senator David L. Williams, who had been pushing for additional resources for adult education since 1997. In 1998, Patton personally chaired a task force on adult education, and 18 months later, the task force&#x27;s recommendations were incorporated into a bill sponsored by Williams. The bill, which increased and equalized funding and tied continuing funds to successful performance by individual adult-education programs, passed both houses of the General Assembly, unanimously. By 2003, the number of adults completing their GED rose by 17 percent, and the number of GED recipients who matriculated to college rose from 13 percent to 18 percent.

=====Criminal justice reform=====
Also on Patton&#x27;s agenda was a reformation of Kentucky&#x27;s juvenile justice system. Under Brereton Jones, because of its system of housing and treating juvenile offenders, Kentucky had been one of only two states unable to qualify for federal grants. Among the problems cited by the Department of Justice were abuse of juveniles by state employees and failure to hold juvenile and adult offenders separately from each other. Governor Jones entered into a consent decree, to ameliorate the situation, but his term expired before he could meaningfully address the terms of the decree. Patton went beyond the terms of the decree by implementing mandatory training for state employees who dealt with juvenile offenders and by setting up a hotline for juveniles to report abuse, anonymously. He shifted the responsibility for housing juveniles from local communities to the state, constructing nine new juvenile detention centers. In January 2001, Attorney General Janet Reno proclaimed Kentucky&#x27;s juvenile justice system a model for the nation.

Patton did not stop with the juvenile justice system, however. He encouraged passage of a bill that required that violent offenders serve at least 85 percent of their sentences (up from the 50 percent previously mandated), while requiring that judges consider home incarceration for first-time, non-violent offenders. The bill also allowed judges to sentence criminals to life without parole; previously, life without parole for 25 years had been the harshest non-capital sentence. The bill passed the legislature in 1999.

====1999 gubernatorial election====

Due to the constitutional amendment enacted under previous governor Brereton Jones, Patton became the first governor in more than 200 years eligible to succeed himself in office. James Garrard had served consecutive terms in 1796 and 1800, but the Kentucky Constitution of 1799 barred any future governor from being elected to consecutive terms. In 1796, Garrard was chosen as governor by an electoral college, not by popular vote, and thus Patton was the first Kentucky governor to be popularly elected for consecutive terms.

Patton was unopposed in the Democratic primary. Republicans nominated Peppy Martin, who many considered a weak candidate. In fact, Patton&#x27;s old Republican foe, David Williams, announced he would vote for Patton over Martin. In the general election Patton garnered 352,099 votes, 60.6 percent of the total. Martin finished with 128,788 votes, with 88,930 votes going to third-party candidate Gatewood Galbraith. When asked why the Republicans had chosen such a weak challenger, Patton opined &quot;They mistakenly believed I could not be beaten. They made a mistake.&quot;

====Second term as governor====
After the gubernatorial election in 1999, Louisville senator Dan Seum announced he would change his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, citing his conservative voting history, including opposition to the state lottery, KERA, and abortion. This switch, which Patton learned of too late to intervene, equalized the number of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. Six weeks later, Paducah senator Bob Leeper announced he would also change his party affiliation. Patton traveled to Paducah and met with Leeper, but he was unable to convince him to remain a Democrat. Leeper had a history of conflict with Democratic Senate President Larry Saunders, but he insisted his party switch, like Seum&#x27;s, was based on political philosophy. Leeper&#x27;s switch gave Republicans a majority in the Senate, for the first time in the state&#x27;s history. David Williams was elected President of the Senate, and he held the Republican majority together, effectively. Consequently, Patton faced a difficult task in maneuvering his agenda through a divided General Assembly.

The rift between Williams and Patton became permanent, during negotiations over the state budget in 1999. Patton proposed to Williams a 7-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax, with 1 cent of every 7 dedicated to counties with the most unpaved roads – usually heavily Republican counties ignored by past Democratic governors. Patton claimed Williams told him he had 10 votes in the Senate for the increase. But gas prices spiked, before the measure came to a vote in the Senate, and Williams failed to deliver his votes, after the House passed the tax. The administration and key Republican senators reached a compromise that saved Patton&#x27;s budget, with tax changes that were mostly revenue-neutral. Patton believed Williams had deliberately misled him, however, and the two never reconciled.

Another issue confronting both Patton and the legislature was how to spend federal funds from the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. Kentucky&#x27;s share of the settlement totaled $3.5 billion over 25 years. Because tobacco was a major cash crop in Kentucky, Patton proposed that half of the settlement be used to diversify the state&#x27;s farmers&#x27; crops. One-fourth of the money would support health care and anti-smoking efforts. The remaining one-fourth would address early-childhood care and education, a cause important to Patton&#x27;s daughter, Nikki, an early-childhood educator.

In November 2000, Kentucky voters approved a constitutional amendment providing a shorter legislative session in odd-numbered years, with longer sessions in even-numbered years. Most of Patton&#x27;s proposals failed, in the 2000 and 2001 legislative sessions. The economic boom that had provided ample funds for his programs, during the first term, slowed in 2001, and by 2002, the state was $800 million short of meeting its budget. In 2002, Republicans in the General Assembly called for an end to public campaign finance, as an economy measure. Calling it &quot;welfare for politicians,” Republicans estimated that abolishing public campaign finance could save the state $30 million. Ultimately, the issue derailed the biennial budget, during the regular legislative session. In April 2002, Patton called a special legislative session to approve the budget, but legislators were still unable to agree. For the first time in the state&#x27;s history, the fiscal year began without a budget. This left Patton to run the state government, for a year, without a budget in place.

Besides the budget, another measure that failed to pass in the 2002 session was a bill to eliminate the death penalty for juveniles. The precedent for the juvenile death penalty had been set in the 1989 Supreme Court case of &quot;Stanford v. Kentucky&quot;, wherein the court ruled that Kevin Stanford could be executed for the 1981 rape, sodomy, and murder of a gas station attendant in Jefferson County, Kentucky, even though Stanford was only 17 at the time of the crime. In 2003, Patton announced he would commute Stanford&#x27;s sentence. Patton did oversee the execution of two adult prisoners, that of Harold McQueen Jr. in 1997 and Eddie Lee Harper in 1999, making him the first Kentucky governor to do so since 1962.

=====Tina Conner sex scandal=====
Already plagued by an uncooperative legislature, Patton&#x27;s situation was exacerbated, in 2002, when it was revealed that, during his first term in office, he had engaged in an extramarital affair with a woman named Tina Conner. According to Conner, the operator of Birchtree Healthcare nursing home in Clinton, Kentucky, the relationship ended in 1999, but Patton continued to call her, until she completely broke off the affair in October 2001. After initially denying the affair, Patton tearfully admitted to it, during a televised press conference at the Kentucky History Center on September 20, 2002. The story made Patton the object of state and national ridicule, and the subject of jokes by Jay Leno on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. The &quot;Louisville Courier-Journal&quot; called for Patton&#x27;s resignation, stating that he was &quot;too damaged, as a moral authority, to lead ... [and] too powerless, as a politician, to compel.&quot;

Conner alleged that Patton arranged regulatory favors for the nursing home, while the affair was ongoing. Two months after Conner said she ended the affair, Birchtree Healthcare was cited by state regulators for numerous violations of health and safety rules. By July 2002, the state had pulled all Medicare and Medicaid payments from the facility, which soon went bankrupt. Conner further alleged that the state investigation of Birchtree was retaliation, by Patton, for her ending of the affair.

In a separate incident, Conner claimed that Patton helped a construction company she owned obtain certification as a disadvantaged business, which gave the company special preference when bidding for state contracts.

The affair appeared to take a toll on Patton&#x27;s marriage. His wife, Judi, was reported to be living in separate quarters in the governor&#x27;s mansion and was rarely seen in public with him.

Patton had risen to national prominence, successively chairing the Southern Governors Association, the Democratic Governors Association, and the National Governors Association (NGA). He was serving as NGA chair, at the time the Tina Conner scandal broke, and he planned to resign his chairmanship in November 2002. Nevertheless, the other governors rallied around him, convincing him to remain in the position. Together, with his Republican vice-chair, Idaho&#x27;s Dirk Kempthorne, Patton led the NGA effectively, securing federal funding to shore up state budgets and keeping the caucus from a partisan split in a vote over Medicaid.

Conner filed suit against Patton, in September 2002. By late 2003, all but one of her charges against Patton had been dismissed; the remaining charge alleged &quot;outrageous&quot; conduct. In March 2003, the state&#x27;s Executive Branch Ethics Commission investigated Conner&#x27;s claims and accused Patton of four ethics violations, charging that he &quot;used or attempted to use his official position&quot; to provide favors for Conner. The favors included contacting the state transportation secretary, with regard to Conner&#x27;s disadvantaged business application, recommending a promotion for an officer who allegedly helped Conner avoid paying a traffic ticket, appointing Conner to the board of directors for the Kentucky Lottery, and appointing Conner&#x27;s then-husband to the Agricultural Development Board. Patton claimed that the favors he requested for Conner were the same kind of favors that he had requested for dozens of influential constituents. He also claimed he had not profited, financially, from any of the requested favors. He maintained that his attitude toward constituent services was &quot;If you can do so legally and ethically, help them.&quot;

Tina Conner&#x27;s final claim against Patton – for &quot;outrage&quot; – was dismissed by a judge in May 2006. In October 2006, Conner filed a second lawsuit against Patton, alleging misconduct by a public official and government oppression; a Franklin County judge dismissed the suit, claiming it was an attempt, by Conner, to re-litigate the claims from her first suit.

=====Loss of legislative influence=====
Because of the deteriorating national economic situation, Kentucky faced a severe budget shortfall, in 2003. Patton proposed an overhaul of the state tax system, whereby tax revenue would keep pace with the state&#x27;s eventual economic recovery. However, such reform would necessarily have meant tax increases, and with the 2003 gubernatorial election looming, legislators from both parties strictly stuck to a pledge not to raise taxes. Consequently, in the 2003 legislative session, members of the General Assembly crafted a budget that completely disregarded any input from Patton. The budget included repealing the campaign finance reform bill, passed a decade earlier. Patton conceded &quot;I have lost any ability to influence the legislature.&quot;

=====Patronage accusations=====
During his final months in office, Patton drew criticism for abusing his patronage power. Critics charged that he had appointed several of his family and friends who were in non-merit system jobs to merit system positions, increasing their chances of being retained when a new administration took over. These charges were particularly damaging because, earlier in the year, the General Assembly had ordered Patton to cut 800 non-merit positions to help balance the budget. The &quot;Lexington Herald-Leader&quot; opined that these charges were more serious than those of the Conner affair. Patton maintained that his friends had followed proper personnel protocol, in applying for and securing merit positions.

=====Campaign finance pardons=====
In June 2003, Patton issued pardons to four men who were under indictment for violating campaign finance laws during the 1995 gubernatorial race. The indictments stemmed from charges by then-candidate Larry Forgy that Patton had skirted campaign finance laws by coordinating expenditures with the Teamsters and the state Democratic Party. A Franklin County grand jury returned the indictments in 1998, but a circuit court judge dismissed them, in 1999, on grounds that the campaign finance law was too vague. An appeals court reversed that decision, the following year, and in 2003, the Kentucky Supreme Court upheld the indictments by a vote of 5–1. The Supreme Court of the United States refused to hear an appeal on June 13, 2003. Two days later, Patton issued pardons for all four men. State attorney general Ben Chandler lamented that the pardons would eliminate the possibility of determining whether Patton won the 1995 contest &quot;honestly and openly.”

===Later career===
Patton had publicly stated that he was planning a run against Republican U.S. Senator Jim Bunning, in 2004, but the scandals that plagued him, near the end of his administration, derailed those plans. He retired to Pikeville, Kentucky, after the election of his successor, Republican Ernie Fletcher. He became a member of the First Presbyterian Church of Pikeville, a member of the Big Sandy Regional Economic Development Board, and chairman of the Pikeville/Pike County Industrial and Economic Authority.

Governor Ernie Fletcher renamed a section of U.S. Route 119, in eastern Kentucky, as the Paul E. Patton Highway at a ceremony on October 30, 2008. On February 1, 2009, Patton was chosen chairman of the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education (CPE). On August 12, 2009, he was announced as the next president of Pikeville College (now, the University of Pikeville). In September 2009, the Executive Branch Ethics Commission issued an advisory opinion that Patton could serve in both roles without a significant conflict of interest, because the CPE wields scant oversight of Kentucky&#x27;s private colleges. Patton was advised to allow someone other than himself to be the official liaison between the University of Pikeville and the CPE and to recuse himself from CPE discussions on matters &quot;that directly involve his private institution or that would affect his institution, differently, than any other similarly situated private postsecondary institution.&quot;

===University of Pikeville===
Patton was formally installed as president of the University of Pikeville on February 16, 2010. He also serves as a Distinguished Visiting Lecturer in Public Policy and Leadership. As president, Patton oversaw the construction of the Expo Center, a new facility to house the university&#x27;s indoor sports; in 2011, the center&#x27;s basketball court was named Paul E. Patton Court.

In late 2011, Patton announced that he and Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives Greg Stumbo would ask the General Assembly to consider adding the University of Pikeville as the ninth state-supported university in the Kentucky university system. On December 30, 2011, he announced his resignation from the Council on Postsecondary Education, to avoid any potential accusations of a conflict of interest regarding the proposal in the 2012 General Assembly.

In 2013, Patton announced he would step down as president of the university and instead serve as chancellor. Because of his longstanding support of the university&#x27;s athletics programs, he was inducted into the university&#x27;s Athletics Hall of Fame, in 2014. In January 2015, the university announced it would move its teacher training program out of the College of Arts and Sciences, creating the new Patton College of Education. The college was scheduled to open for the fall 2015 semester.

== Personal life ==
Following his sophomore year of college, he married Carol Cooley, daughter of a Floyd County, Kentucky, coal mine operator. They had two children together – Nikki and Christopher.

<text>James Ruse Agricultural High School (colloquially known as Ruse or JR) is a government-funded co-educational academically selective and specialist secondary day school, located in the Sydney suburb of Carlingford, New South Wales, Australia, long known for being the highest academically ranked high school in Australia. The school is also one of four New South Wales Government agricultural high schools.

The school is especially noted for its consistent academic excellence, having ranked 1st out of all New South Wales high schools in the Higher School Certificate for 27 consecutive years from 1996 to 2022, narrowly beaten by North Sydney Boys High School in 2023 and 2024, as well as 1st in the national government NAPLAN tests across Australia since their establishment. Although it ranked 2nd in the HSC in 2023 and 2024, it continues to rank 1st nationally in the NAPLAN.

As of 2023, there are approximately 857 students enrolled at James Ruse in Year 7 through to Year 12. James Ruse is an academically selective high school; admission to James Ruse in Year 7 is only through the Selective High Schools Test, which is open to all Year 6 NSW students. A small number of students from other high schools are accepted in Year 9, 10 and 11, through application made directly to the school. In 2019, approximately 97% of the student population came from a language background other than English.

== History ==
In 1949 the main part of the school grounds was purchased by the NSW Government for the purpose of agricultural education. The school that commenced on this site in 1956 was an annexe of Carlingford District Rural School with Charles Mullavey as the Master in Charge. At that time the school consisted of a wooden, five-room classroom block, a small staff-room and ablution facilities. By the start of 1958 the school was independent of Carlingford District Rural School and was called the &quot;Carlingford Junior Agricultural High School&quot; (reflecting that students could only undertake the first three years of secondary education at the school).

In 1959 the name of the school was changed to &quot;Carlingford Agricultural High School&quot; (to reflect its new full high school status – although there were no actual Fourth and Fifth Year classes at that time). The first Headmaster, James C. Hoskin, and his Deputy Headmaster, Charles Mullavey, commenced duties at the start of that year and in April, the name of the school changed again - this time to &quot;James Ruse Agricultural High School&quot;.

When James Hoskin was studying Agriculture at University, he had become interested in James Ruse due to his significance in the early development of agriculture in Australia, and also because &quot;both Ruse and I [Hoskin] are of Cornish extraction&quot;. Hoskin questioned the name of the school (Carlingford Agricultural High School) as the school was not serving just the Carlingford area. In April 1959, Hoskin put forward a proposal to the NSW Department of Education outlining two new names for the school: &quot;Sydney Agricultural High School&quot; and &quot;Ruse Agricultural High School&quot;; eventually, the Department agreed to a modification of the latter. The school was named to honour prominent late farmer James Ruse.

Hoskin soon became synonymous with the school, as he served as headmaster until his retirement aged 65 in 1978. During this time, the school became established as one of the few public schools that were selective; initially because of its agricultural speciality, then for its reputation as a quality school. For his efforts, Hoskin was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977 and the Order of Australia for Services to Education in 1990.

The first group of students to complete the full five years of secondary education at the new high school sat for the Leaving Certificate in 1961. Most of these boys were part of the initial enrolment of 1st Year pupils at the Felton Rd. site, in 1957, Harry Fox Wilson was among them. James Ruse AHS was originally a boys only school, but gradually became co-educational after an initial intake of 24 female students into Year 11 in 1977.

Since the mid-1990s, James Ruse has undergone an extensive building works program funded by both parents of students and the State and Federal Governments. 1997 saw the completion of Stage 1 of this program (encompassing a new Library block and English classrooms which replaced the old Anderson building, a new block containing Art and HSIE classrooms, the integration of the existing Powe block and the former library into a science block, and the installation of an elevator in the Perrau block to improve wheelchair accessibility).

In 2000, Stage 2 of the program began with the first building (a 180-seat lecture theatre) completed in early 2001. The Schofield block became part of the program in 2002 after the building was damaged by fires. During the next two years the old Technology Block and the Francis block were demolished due to a white ant infestation, with both blocks being rebuilt and refurnished in 2004. The final stage of the works were underway at the time of the departure of Principal Michael Quinlan, who retired in 2006 after having been Principal since 1992. These developments (including a new music block) continued with the guidance of the new principal, Larissa Treskin.

In early 2020, the Powe Science block opened after extensive renovations.

=== James Ruse Agricultural High School Army Cadet Unit (JRAHSACU) ===
The Australian Army Cadets (AAC) operates a school-based unit at James Ruse for students of the school. The unit was established in 1960, and is the largest extra-curricular activity offered at the school. With a current strength of over 300, representing over a third of the students in the school, JRAHSACU is one of the largest cadet units in Australia. 

The unit conducts a weekend bivouacs three times a year which involve hiking interspersed with lessons on topics such as fieldcraft, radio telecommunications and first aid. Each year, the unit conducts its week-long Annual Adventurous Activity at a location within Australia or occasionally New Zealand. This involves multiple days of hiking. Recent locations for the activity include the Cape to Cape Track, Kosciuszko National Park, Kangaroo Island, Coffs Harbour and the Bogong High Plains. 

During weekly home parades on Mondays, the unit conducts lessons within specialist courses developed by the Training Officer and Training Cell. Cadets are organised in platoons according to the course they are completing. Theory lessons are taught by section commanders or platoon sergeants whilst drill lessons are taught by company sergeant majors.

The unit is a part of the NSW 2nd AAC Brigade, and consists of four companies (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta). The unit&#x27;s cadet senior leadership group is known as Senior Command and consists of senior cadets, most of whom wear the rank of Cadet Under Officer (CUO), with one Cadet Regimental Sergeant Major who wears the rank of Cadet Warrant Officer Class 1 (CDTWO1). CUOs within Senior Command hold appointments such as Company Commander (one for each company), Administration Officer, Logistics Officer and Training Officer, and oversee their respective cells in the unit, as well as organise and plan activities with the support of adult staff.

Throughout its history, the JRAHSACU has been involved in community events, including Hyde Park Memorial Parade, RSL Services, services at local primary schools, and parades in Sydney CBD. JRAHSACU was awarded the high honour of parading the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Banner in 2011 and 2023. Cadets from the unit participate in the annual National Adventure Training Award. The unit has been awarded with numerous formal commendations, unit medals, and unit efficiency awards. 

JRAHSACU cadets have also taken leadership roles within the wider AAC, such as the 2021 National Cadet Under Officer (NCUO). In 2022, JRAHSACU was featured as the Guard of Honour at the Sydney Hyde Park War Memorial in the online ANZAC service video, made in lieu of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was released to units and communities around New South Wales. In 2023, JRAHSACU was featured as the Guard of Honour at the NSW Department of Education&#x27;s ANZAC Day Service, and was selected as part of the Royal Guard of Honour for the first occurrence in seventy years of the King&#x27;s Birthday Parade for the Governor of New South Wales at Government House, Sydney.

=== Student Representative Council (SRC) ===
The school&#x27;s Student Representative Council was inaugurated in 1960, making it among the first high schools in New South Wales to have such a body. Each year, each roll class elects two representatives who represent it on the SRC, with the exception of Year 11 classes who elect one representative for each English class. The SRC as a whole elect a student executive body, which consists of a President, Vice-President, Treasurer, Secretary, and Minutes Secretary, by a system first inaugurated in 1990. Through the SRC, students have some representation on the school steering committees (along with parents and staff), and also play a minor role in decision-making processes relating to curriculum, building plans, and resource allocation. This group is led by five, year 11 student executives.

The council is elected through a first-past-the-post voting system, with a voting card for male and female respectively. This replaced the instant runoff system, which caused gender imbalances in representation. Year Advisors and the school&#x27;s teacher executives have final oversight over the representatives in this body, and have the power to veto any candidate without their knowledge, giving the position to the candidate with the next highest number of votes.

== Agriculture ==
The school teaches agriculture as a compulsory subject from years 7 to 10. Formerly it was also compulsory in Year 11 (with students taking an accelerated version of the HSC course to allow completion within one year). However, following the introduction of a new HSC curriculum by the Board of Studies in 2001, the school made Year 11 optional (with the decision supported by a survey among students). Agriculture is a significant part of the school&#x27;s curriculum, with students undergoing study of the subject both on and off-site, where students study and visit agricultural enterprises both in the Greater Sydney region, with visits to regional horticultural farming enterprises such as the Sydney Royal Easter Show and farms in Bathurst and in Gloucester. There is also great involvement in with other agricultural schools, with the school linked with Yanco Agricultural High School, and previous Head Teacher of Agriculture, Lisle Brown, being the co-author of the &quot;Dynamic Agriculture&quot; textbook series, which is extensively used in agriculture in Australian schools.

The school leases approximately ten hectares of land from the neighbouring electricity sub-station for use in practical agriculture lessons. The farm land is situated north of the general school buildings, extending north to Lynch Close and east to Jenkins Road. The farm is arranged to include a vegetable garden, a classroom, a glasshouse and nursery, a greenhouse, an orchard, experimental plots, an area for field crops and a livestock section, among others. It also contains some riparian land which is currently being monitored and undergoing rehabilitation to its native state by the Streamwatch group (currently working as part of Sydney Water Streamwatch).

A significant amount of the farm land is set aside for student plots. Part of practical agriculture lessons involves students growing and maintaining their own crops, and a practical mark worth 10% of their yearly mark is awarded at the end of term. Mature crops in the students&#x27; assigned plots of land are then the students&#x27; to take home. In addition to its use for educational purposes, the farm also supplies a wide variety of agricultural produce including: Cattle – Angus stud, paraded annually at the Castle Hill Show by the Cattle Group, and sold at Camden Sales yard; Sheep – First-cross Ewes &amp; Prime Lambs; Eggs – Free-range eggs; Poultry Meat – Broilers raised and sold onsite, Oranges – Washington Navel; Peaches – Flordagold and Sherman&#x27;s Red varieties; Sweet Corn – Shimmer variety; James Ruse Gold Rose – A privately crossbred rose variety the rights were donated to the school in 1999 in celebration of its 40 years of teaching; Apiary – Honey sold on-site in jars; and Macadamia Nuts. Various groups of students have been set up to look after these, such as the Poultry Squad and a Weather Watcher group to maintain farm records. In the past, the farm also housed Merino-Border Leicester sheep, named the Sharlea Sheep. It was replaced by the Aquaculture venture, silver perch and a crayfish growing system. Now some students also participate in making peach jam and sorbet after the peach harvest.

== Campus ==
The school is situated in Carlingford, a suburb of north-western Sydney. Its main entrance is located on the southwest corner of the school, with a number of smaller entrances on its southern and western boundaries. The campus is built around a main quadrangle, another cluster of buildings around a smaller quadrangle, with an oval, sporting facilities and the farm to the north of these.

=== Barrengarry House ===
Barrengarry House, the school&#x27;s main administration block, is located near the southwest entrance of the school, adjoining the Senior Common Room and the Library and housing the offices of the principal, deputy principals, head teacher of administration and the administration staff on the lower floor, and the counsellor&#x27;s office, uniform shop and function rooms on the upper floor. It was originally the home and property of the Felton family, and was built in 1885, with the architect thought to have been Charles Slatyer. The block adjoins a roadway of the same name, both of which are named after the Feltons&#x27; estate.

=== J.C. Hoskin Auditorium ===
More commonly known as the &quot;school hall&quot;, the J.C. Hoskin Auditorium, named after the school&#x27;s founding principal (see history above), is used as a multi-purpose facility. Along with holding important school assemblies, concerts and the school musical, the hall is also used for examinations (primarily government and senior exams) and it was used for PE classes in the past—this function was largely removed with the construction of the school&#x27;s new gymnasium in 2017. Ceremonies which celebrate the school&#x27;s highest achievers are also held annually in the Auditorium.

=== Library Block ===
The Library Block (or &quot;L-Block&quot;) was built in 1997 and opened by then NSW Premier Bob Carr as part of the school&#x27;s building works program, to provide a larger, and more modern and well-equipped library to replace the smaller Shearman Block (now the school&#x27;s Music block). The block is a two-storey building, with the library occupying the top floor and English classrooms and offices on the bottom floor.

=== Technology Block ===
The Technology Block (or &quot;T-Block&quot;) is a recent addition to the school campus along with the new Canteen Block, with construction finished in 2005. The wing is a two-storey building with a mix of classrooms, workshops and modern computer labs, and overlooks the gymnasium on its northern side. To its south is the Art Block.

=== Art Block ===
The Art Block (or &quot;A-Block&quot;) is a two storey facility that contains a 5 classrooms. On the lower floor resides the Creative and Performing Arts staffroom, two art classrooms and an art storage room with kilns and other art supplies. On the upper floor are 3 classrooms that are usually used for HSIE lessons such as History, Geography, Commerce and Economics. Due to the sloped nature of the campus, the upper floor adjoins to the first floor of Cameron Block and the lower floor adjoins to the upper floor of the Technology Block.

=== Cameron Block ===
The Cameron Block (or &quot;C-Block&quot;) is a three-storey building with a variety of classrooms, science labs, computer rooms and lockers. The second floor is primarily used for Mathematics lessons, and the Mathematics Staffroom is located on the second floor accordingly. On the first floor, rooms C1.1 and C1.2 are science labs, whilst C1.4 and C1.5 are primarily used for HSIE lessons. There is also a Drama Room (C1.3) which contains a stage, as well as a hobbit hole with costumes and other drama-related objects. The topic of Multiple-Disciplinary Communications (MDC) was also formerly taught within the drama room. The HSIE/LOTE staffroom is located between C1.5 and C1.4. The cadets Q-Store is hosted in the exterior of the block.

=== Powe Block ===
The Powe Block (or &quot;P-Block&quot;) is a two-storey building connecting L-Block and C-Block which houses most (but not all) of the school&#x27;s laboratories. It has 5 classrooms. Most science lessons are held in this building and the science faculty staff room is located on the first floor. Its second storey was constructed in 2012.

=== W-Block ===
W-block is a set of 4 separate single-storey buildings. One building contains W1.1 (science lab) and W1.2 (classroom). W1.3 is a band room. W1.4 is partitioned into 5-6 music rooms and one larger classroom. The W-block building nearest to the quadrangle houses several classrooms, and the English Staffroom.

=== F-Block ===
F-Block is a single storey building with two adjoining rooms that houses agriculture lessons. The farm manager utilises this block. It is located on the farm besides the tool shed and behind the basketball courts, and overlooks the peach/orange orchard.

=== Bishop Block ===
Bishop Block is named after John Bishop. It is a 2 storey building adjacent to the canteen sails. The bottom floor is used as a sports equipment storeroom and the second floor is a single classroom often used for Latin or Japanese classes.

=== Gymnasium ===
The JRAHS Gymnasium began construction in late 2016 and opened in 2017. It is the furthest block from Barrengarry House with the exception of the F Block. The Gymnasium currently plays hosts to a majority of Physical Education classes, and can be altered to play volleyball, netball, basketball or futsal. During exam periods, the facility can be converted into an additional exam hall to supplement the J.C. Hoskin Auditorium.

<doc id="1301056" wikidata="Q2305237" url="?curid=1301056" title="Scandinavian Leather">
<text>Scandinavian Leather is an album by the Norwegian band Turbonegro that followed the band&#x27;s reunion in 2002 and was released in April 2003 on Burning Heart Records in Sweden, on Bitzcore Records in Germany, on JVC/Victor Records in Japan, and on 6 May 2003 on Epitaph Records in the United States.

==Music and lyrics==
With &quot;Scandinavian Leather&quot; Turbonegro returned to a more rock style, continuing that found on &quot;Apocalypse Dudes&quot; with a development of the &#x27;deathpunk&#x27; sound. While the songwriting is reminiscent of that of the Ramones, the sound is more multi-layered, including string arrangements, harmonic backing vocals, arena rock influences and psychedelic undertones, which the band coined &quot;Rainbow Rock&quot;, or deathpunk with a pop sensibility.

<doc id="1301058" wikidata="Q57658" url="?curid=1301058" title="Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine">
<text>Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, then Princess Louis of Battenberg, later Victoria Mountbatten, Marchioness of Milford Haven (5 April 1863 – 24 September 1950), was the eldest daughter of Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine, and Princess Alice of the United Kingdom, daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.

Born in Windsor Castle in the presence of her maternal grandmother, Princess Victoria was raised in Germany and England. Her mother died while Victoria&#x27;s brother and sisters were still young, which placed her in an early position of responsibility over her siblings. Over her father&#x27;s disapproval, she married his morganatic first cousin Prince Louis of Battenberg, an officer in the British Royal Navy. Victoria lived most of her married life in various parts of Europe at her husband&#x27;s naval posts and visiting her many royal relations. She was perceived by her family as liberal in outlook, straightforward, practical and bright. The couple had four children: Alice, Louise, George, and Louis.

During World War I, Victoria and her husband abandoned their German titles and adopted the surname of Mountbatten, which was an anglicised version of the German &quot;Battenberg&quot;. Two of her sisters—Elisabeth and Alix, who had married into the Russian imperial family—were murdered by communist revolutionaries. After World War II, her daughter Louise became queen consort of Sweden and her son Louis was appointed the last viceroy of India. She was the maternal grandmother of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, consort of Queen Elizabeth II; and paternal great-grandmother of King Charles III.

==Early life==

Victoria was born on Easter Sunday at Windsor Castle in the presence of her maternal grandmother, Queen Victoria. She was christened in the Lutheran faith in the Green Drawing Room at Windsor Castle, in the arms of the Queen on 27 April. Her godparents were Queen Victoria, Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge, Louis III, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine (represented by Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine), the Prince of Wales and Prince Heinrich of Hesse and by Rhine.

Victoria&#x27;s early life was spent at Bessungen, a suburb of Darmstadt, until the family moved to the New Palace in Darmstadt when she was three years old. There, she shared a room with her younger sister, Elisabeth, until adulthood. She was privately educated to a high standard and was, throughout her life, an avid reader.
During the Prussian invasion of Hesse in June 1866, Victoria and Elisabeth were sent to Britain to live with their grandmother until hostilities were ended by the absorption of Hesse-Kassel and parts of Hesse-Darmstadt into Prussia. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, military hospitals were set up in the palace grounds at Darmstadt, and she helped in the soup kitchens with her mother. She remembered the intense cold of the winter, and being burned on the arm by hot soup.

In 1872, Victoria&#x27;s eighteen-month-old brother, Friedrich, was diagnosed with haemophilia. The diagnosis came as a shock to the royal families of Europe; it had been twenty years since Queen Victoria had given birth to her haemophiliac son, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, and it was the first indication that the bleeding disorder in the royal family was hereditary. The following year, Friedrich fell from a window onto stone steps and died. It was the first of many tragedies to beset the Hesse family.

In early November 1878, Victoria contracted diphtheria. Elisabeth was swiftly moved out of their room and was the only member of the family to escape the disease. For days, Victoria&#x27;s mother nursed the sick, but she was unable to save her youngest daughter, Marie, who died in mid-November. Just as the rest of the family seemed to have recovered, Princess Alice fell ill. She died on 14 December, the anniversary of the death of her father, Prince Albert. As the eldest child, Victoria partly assumed the role of mother to the younger children and of companion to her father. She later wrote, &quot;My mother&#x27;s death was an irreparable loss ... My childhood ended with her death, for I became the eldest and most responsible&quot;.

==Marriage and family==
At family gatherings, Victoria had often met Prince Louis of Battenberg, who was her first cousin once removed and a member of a morganatic branch of the Hessian royal family. Prince Louis had adopted British nationality and was serving as an officer in the Royal Navy. In the winter of 1882, they met again at Darmstadt, and were engaged the following summer.

After a brief postponement because of the death of her maternal uncle Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, Victoria married Prince Louis on 30 April 1884 at Darmstadt. Her father did not approve of the match; in his view Prince Louis—his own first cousin—had little money and would deprive him of his daughter&#x27;s company, as the couple would naturally live abroad in Britain. However, Victoria was of an independent mind and took little notice of her father&#x27;s displeasure. Remarkably, that same evening, Victoria&#x27;s father secretly married his mistress, Countess Alexandrine von Hutten-Czapska, the former wife of Alexander von Kolemine, the Russian chargé d&#x27;affaires in Darmstadt. His marriage to a divorcee who was not of equal rank shocked the assembled royalty of Europe and through diplomatic and family pressure Victoria&#x27;s father was forced to seek an annulment of his own marriage.

Over the next sixteen years, Victoria and her husband had four children:


They lived in a succession of houses at Chichester, Sussex, Walton-on-Thames, and Schloss Heiligenberg, Jugenheim. When Prince Louis was serving with the Mediterranean Fleet, she spent some winters in Malta. In 1887, she contracted typhoid but, after being nursed through her illness by her husband, was sufficiently recovered by June to attend Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee celebrations in London. She was interested in science and drew a detailed geological map of Malta and also participated in archaeological digs both on the island and in Germany. In leather-bound volumes she kept meticulous records of books she had read, which reveal a wide range of interests, including socialist philosophy.

She personally taught her own children and exposed them to new ideas and inventions. She gave lessons to her younger son, Louis, until he was ten years of age. He said of her in 1968 that she was &quot;a walking encyclopedia. All through her life she stored up knowledge on all sorts of subjects, and she had the great gift of being able to make it all interesting when she taught it to me. She was completely methodical; we had time-tables for each subject, and I had to do preparation, and so forth. She taught me to enjoy working hard, and to be thorough. She was outspoken and open-minded to a degree quite unusual in members of the Royal Family. And she was also entirely free from prejudice about politics or colour and things of that kind.&quot;

In 1906, she flew in a Zeppelin airship, and even more daringly later flew in a biplane even though it was &quot;not made to carry passengers, and we perched securely attached on a little stool holding on to the flyer&#x27;s back&quot;. Up until 1914, Victoria regularly visited her relatives abroad in both Germany and Russia, including her two sisters who had married into the Russian imperial family: Elisabeth, who had married Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich, and Alix, who had married Emperor Nicholas II. Victoria was one of the Empress&#x27;s relatives who tried to persuade her away from the influence of Rasputin. On the outbreak of war between Germany and Britain in 1914, Victoria and her daughter, Louise, were in Russia at Yekaterinburg. By train and steamer, they travelled to St Petersburg and from there through Tornio to Stockholm. They sailed from Bergen, Norway, on &quot;the last ship&quot; back to Britain.

==Later life==

Prince Louis was forced to resign from the navy at the start of the war when his German origins became an embarrassment, and the couple retired for the war years to Kent House on the Isle of Wight, which Victoria had been given by her aunt Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll. Victoria blamed her husband&#x27;s forced resignation on the Government &quot;who few greatly respect or trust&quot;. She distrusted the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, because she thought him unreliable—he had once borrowed a book and failed to return it. Continued public hostility to Germany led King George V of the United Kingdom to renounce his German titles, and at the same time on 14 July 1917 Prince Louis and Victoria renounced theirs, assuming an anglicised version of Battenberg—Mountbatten—as their surname. Four months later Louis was re-ennobled by the King as Marquess of Milford Haven. During the war, Victoria&#x27;s two sisters, Alix and Elisabeth, were murdered in the Russian revolution, and her brother, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse, was deposed. On her last visit to Russia in 1914, Victoria had driven past the very house in Yekaterinburg where Alix would be murdered. In January 1921, after a long and convoluted journey, Elisabeth&#x27;s body was interred in Jerusalem in Victoria&#x27;s presence. Alix&#x27;s body was never recovered during Victoria&#x27;s lifetime.
Victoria&#x27;s husband died in London in September 1921. After meeting her at the Naval and Military Club in Piccadilly, he complained of feeling unwell and Victoria persuaded him to rest in a room they had booked in the club annexe. She called a doctor, who prescribed some medicine, and Victoria went out to fill the prescription at a nearby pharmacy. When she came back, Louis was dead. Upon her widowhood, Victoria moved into a grace-and-favour residence at Kensington Palace and, in the words of her biographer, &quot;became a central matriarchal figure in the lives of Europe&#x27;s surviving royalty&quot;. In 1930, her eldest daughter, Alice, suffered a nervous breakdown and was diagnosed as schizophrenic. In the following decade Victoria was largely responsible for her grandson Prince Philip&#x27;s education and upbringing during his parents&#x27; separation and his mother&#x27;s institutionalisation. Prince Philip recalled, &quot;I liked my grandmother very much and she was always helpful. She was very good with children ... she took the practical approach to them. She treated them in the right way—the right combination of the rational and the emotional.&quot;

In 1937, Victoria&#x27;s brother, Ernest Louis, died and soon afterwards her widowed sister-in-law, nephew, granddaughter and two of her great-grandchildren all died in an air crash at Ostend. Victoria&#x27;s granddaughter, Princess Cecilie of Greece and Denmark, had married Victoria&#x27;s nephew (Ernest Louis&#x27;s son), George Donatus of Hesse. They and their two young sons, Louis and Alexander, were all killed. Cecilie&#x27;s youngest child, Johanna, who was not on the plane, was adopted by her uncle Prince Louis of Hesse and by Rhine, whose wedding the crash victims were en route to, but the little girl only survived her parents and older brothers by eighteen months, dying in 1939 of meningitis.

Further tragedy soon followed when Victoria&#x27;s son, George, died of bone cancer the following year. Her granddaughter, Lady Pamela Hicks, remembered her grandmother&#x27;s tears. In World War II Victoria was bombed out of Kensington Palace, and spent some time at Windsor Castle with King George VI. Her surviving son (Louis) and her two grandsons (David Mountbatten and Prince Philip) served in the Royal Navy, while her German relations fought with the opposing forces. She spent most of her time reading and worrying about her children; her daughter, Alice, remained in occupied Greece and was unable to communicate with her mother for four years at the height of the war. After the Allied victory, her son, Louis, was made Viscount Mountbatten of Burma. He was offered the post of Viceroy of India, but she was deeply opposed to his accepting, knowing that the position would be dangerous and difficult; he accepted anyway.

On 15 December 1948, the Dowager Marchioness attended the christening of her great-grandson, Prince Charles. She was one of eight sponsors or godparents, along with King George VI, King Haakon VII of Norway, Queen Mary, Princess Margaret, Prince George of Greece and Denmark, Lady Brabourne, and David Bowes-Lyon.

She fell ill with bronchitis (she had smoked since the age of sixteen) at Lord Mountbatten&#x27;s home at Broadlands, Hampshire, in the summer of 1950. Saying &quot;it is better to die at home&quot;, Victoria moved back to Kensington Palace, where she died on 24 September aged 87. She was buried four days later in the grounds of St. Mildred&#x27;s Church, Whippingham on the Isle of Wight.

==Legacy==
With the help of her lady-in-waiting, Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden, Victoria wrote a memoir, held in the Mountbatten archive at the University of Southampton, which remains an interesting source for royal historians. A selection of Queen Victoria&#x27;s letters to Victoria have been published with a commentary by Richard Hough and an introduction by Victoria&#x27;s granddaughter, Patricia Mountbatten.

Lord Mountbatten remembered her fondly: &quot;My mother was very quick on the uptake, very talkative, very aggressive and argumentative. With her marvellous brain she sharpened people&#x27;s wits.&quot; Her granddaughter thought her &quot;formidable, but never intimidating ... a supremely honest woman, full of commonsense and modesty&quot;. Victoria wrote her own typically forthright epitaph at the end of her life in letters to and conversation with her son: &quot;What will live in history is the good work done by the individual &amp; that has nothing to do with rank or title ... I never thought I would be known only as your mother. You&#x27;re so well known now and no one knows about me, and I don&#x27;t want them to.&quot;

<text>Creamed honey is honey that has been processed to control crystallization. Also known as honey fondant, soft set honey, or whipped honey, it has a smooth, spreadable consistency and lighter color than liquid honey of the same floral type. A method for producing creamed honey was first patented in 1935, and other methods have since been devised.

== Description ==
Creamed honey contains a large number of small crystals, which prevent the formation of larger crystals that can occur in unprocessed honey. The processing also produces a honey with a smooth spreadable consistency. Because it is the glucose that crystallizes in the honey, and because glucose crystals are naturally pure white, creamed honey is always lighter-colored than liquid honey of the same floral type.

Creamed honey stays in its creamy consistency indefinitely if stored at approximately .

== Production methods ==

* The Dyce Method

Creamed honey was developed by Elton J. Dyce in the early 1930s. In the key production step, microscopic seed crystals are added to liquid honey. Then paddles intermittently stir the honey mixture while it is kept between ; creaming completes in 2–3 days. Dyce used the high heat of pasteurization to ensure that his honey source did not already contain crystals too large for the process, but modern techniques instead use fresh raw, liquid honey at a ratio of 1:10 or larger. The latter yields a batch of creamed honey in approximately 80 hours.

* Variations on the Dyce Method

Instead of pasteurization, fresh honey that has not yet crystallized can be used. Using the fresh honey keeps the naturally present enzymes intact, while pasteurization will denature the enzymes. All other steps remain the same as listed in the Dyce Method.

<text>Haystack Rock is a sea stack in Cannon Beach, Oregon. The monolithic rock is adjacent to the beach and accessible by foot at low tide. The Haystack Rock tide pools are home to many intertidal animals, including starfish, sea anemone, crabs, chitons, limpets, and sea slugs. The rock is also a nesting site for many sea birds, including terns and puffins.

==History==
In 1968, a protrusion of a rock that was used as a ledge by those illegally climbing it was blasted off.

In 1990, Haystack Rock was granted Marine Garden status by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. The site is protected under the Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge as a designated wilderness area.

The sea stack formation was closed temporarily during July 2023 after a cougar was documented, for the first time, climbing on the rock in search of prey.

==Location and management==
Haystack Rock is located about south of downtown Cannon Beach in Clatsop County and about west of Portland. The nearest major road is U.S. Route 101. Haystack Rock is part of the Tolovana Beach State Recreation Site.

The area below the mean high water (MHW) level is managed by Oregon Parks and Recreation. The area above the MHW level is managed by the Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.

==Geology==
Measuring tall, Haystack Rock is composed of basalt and was formed by lava flows emanating from the Blue Mountains and Columbia basin about 15-17 million years ago. The lava flows came from massive eruptions from a source believed to be what is now the Yellowstone volcanic hotspot, and created many of the Oregon coast&#x27;s natural features. Haystack Rock was once joined to the coastline but years of erosion have since separated the monolith from the coast. Three smaller, adjacent rock formations to the south of Haystack Rock are collectively called &quot;The Needles&quot;.

It is estimated that Haystack Rock may erode away in 2,000 to 3,000 years.

==Ecology==
Collecting plants or animals is strictly prohibited and to protect nesting birds, climbing above the mean high tide level barnacle line is not allowed. The Haystack Rock Awareness Program is run by the City of Cannon Beach and conducts educational seminars at the rock during low tide between February and October.

A variety of bird species, such as pigeon guillemots, common murres, black oystercatchers, and tufted puffins, roost and nest on the rock, raising their young usually between March and September.

==Recreation==

Visitors to Haystack Rock can view many species of marine wildlife in their natural habitat during low tide. The thin strip of rock and sand that connects it to the beach at these times features many tide pools. The area surrounding the rock is popular for picnicking, kite-flying, and bird-watching. , the rock averages an annual count of 350,000 visitors.

== Popular Culture ==
Several movies have featured Haystack Rock prominently in their filming, including The Goonies, Point Break and Twilight.

<doc id="1301081" wikidata="Q2026994" url="?curid=1301081" title="Solid-phase synthesis">
<text>In chemistry, solid-phase synthesis is a method in which molecules are covalently bound on a solid support material and synthesised step-by-step in a single reaction vessel utilising selective protecting group chemistry. Benefits compared with normal synthesis in a liquid state include:

* High efficiency and throughput
* Increased simplicity and speed

The reaction can be driven to completion and high yields through the use of excess reagent. In this method, building blocks are protected at all reactive functional groups. The order of functional group reactions can be controlled by the order of deprotection. This method is used for the synthesis of peptides, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), and other molecules that need to be synthesised in a certain alignment. More recently, this method has also been used in combinatorial chemistry and other synthetic applications. The process was originally developed in the 1950s and 1960s by Robert Bruce Merrifield in order to synthesise peptide chains, and which was the basis for his 1984 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

In the basic method of solid-phase synthesis, building blocks that have two functional groups are used. One of the functional groups of the building block is usually protected by a protective group. The starting material is a bead which binds to the building block. At first, this bead is added into the solution of the protected building block and stirred. After the reaction between the bead and the protected building block is completed, the solution is removed and the bead is washed. Then the protecting group is removed and the above steps are repeated. After all steps are finished, the synthesised compound is chemically cleaved from the bead.

If a compound containing more than two kinds of building blocks is synthesised, a step is added before the deprotection of the building block bound to the bead; a functional group which is on the bead and did not react with an added building block has to be protected by another protecting group which is not removed at the deprotective condition of the building block. Byproducts which lack the building block of this step only are prevented by this step. In addition, this step makes it easy to purify the synthesised compound after cleavage from the bead.

==Solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS)==

Solid-phase synthesis is a common technique for peptide synthesis. Usually, peptides are synthesised from the carbonyl group side (C-terminus) to amino group side (N-terminus) of the amino acid chain in the SPPS method, although peptides are biologically synthesised in the opposite direction in cells. In peptide synthesis, an amino-protected amino acid is bound to a solid phase material or resin (most commonly, low cross-linked polystyrene beads), forming a covalent bond between the carbonyl group and the resin, most often an amido or an ester bond. Then the amino group is deprotected and reacted with the carbonyl group of the next N-protected amino acid. The solid phase now bears a dipeptide. This cycle is repeated to form the desired peptide chain. After all reactions are complete, the synthesised peptide is cleaved from the bead.

The protecting groups for the amino groups mostly used in the peptide synthesis are 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl group (Fmoc) and t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc). A number of amino acids bear functional groups in the side chain which must be protected specifically from reacting with the incoming N-protected amino acids. In contrast to Boc and Fmoc groups, these have to be stable over the course of peptide synthesis although they are also removed during the final deprotection of peptides.

==Solid-phase synthesis of DNA and RNA==

Relatively short fragments of DNA, RNA, and modified oligonucleotides are also synthesised by the solid-phase method. Although oligonucleotides can be synthesised in a flask, they are almost always synthesised on solid phase using a DNA/RNA synthesizer. For a more comprehensive review, see oligonucleotide synthesis. The method of choice is generally phosphoramidite chemistry, developed in the 1980s.

<doc id="1301093" wikidata="Q243745" url="?curid=1301093" title="Two-port network">
<text>In electronics, a two-port network (a kind of four-terminal network or quadripole) is an electrical network (i.e. a circuit) or device with two &quot;pairs&quot; of terminals to connect to external circuits. Two terminals constitute a port if the currents applied to them satisfy the essential requirement known as the port condition: the current entering one terminal must equal the current emerging from the other terminal on the same port. The ports constitute interfaces where the network connects to other networks, the points where signals are applied or outputs are taken. In a two-port network, often port 1 is considered the input port and port 2 is considered the output port.

It is commonly used in mathematical circuit analysis.

== Application ==
The two-port network model is used in mathematical circuit analysis techniques to isolate portions of larger circuits. A two-port network is regarded as a &quot;black box&quot; with its properties specified by a matrix of numbers. This allows the response of the network to signals applied to the ports to be calculated easily, without solving for all the internal voltages and currents in the network. It also allows similar circuits or devices to be compared easily. For example, transistors are often regarded as two-ports, characterized by their -parameters (see below) which are listed by the manufacturer. Any linear circuit with four terminals can be regarded as a two-port network provided that it does not contain an independent source and satisfies the port conditions.

Examples of circuits analyzed as two-ports are filters, matching networks, transmission lines, transformers, and small-signal models for transistors (such as the hybrid-pi model). The analysis of passive two-port networks is an outgrowth of reciprocity theorems first derived by Lorentz.

In two-port mathematical models, the network is described by a 2 by 2 square matrix of complex numbers. The common models that are used are referred to as -&quot;parameters&quot;, -&quot;parameters&quot;, -&quot;parameters&quot;, -&quot;parameters&quot;, and -&quot;parameters&quot;, each described individually below. These are all limited to linear networks since an underlying assumption of their derivation is that any given circuit condition is a linear superposition of various short-circuit and open circuit conditions. They are usually expressed in matrix notation, and they establish relations between the variables
:, voltage across port 1
:, current into port 1
:, voltage across port 2
:, current into port 2

which are shown in figure 1. The difference between the various models lies in which of these variables are regarded as the independent variables. These current and voltage variables are most useful at low-to-moderate frequencies. At high frequencies (e.g., microwave frequencies), the use of power and energy variables is more appropriate, and the two-port current–voltage approach is replaced by an approach based upon scattering parameters.

==General properties==
There are certain properties of two-ports that frequently occur in practical networks and can be used to greatly simplify the analysis. These include:

; Reciprocal networks: A network is said to be reciprocal if the voltage appearing at port 2 due to a current applied at port 1 is the same as the voltage appearing at port 1 when the same current is applied to port 2. Exchanging voltage and current results in an equivalent definition of reciprocity. A network that consists entirely of linear passive components (that is, resistors, capacitors and inductors) is usually reciprocal, a notable exception being passive circulators and isolators that contain magnetized materials. In general, it &quot;will not&quot; be reciprocal if it contains active components such as generators or transistors.
; Symmetrical networks: A network is symmetrical if its input impedance is equal to its output impedance. Most often, but not necessarily, symmetrical networks are also physically symmetrical. Sometimes also antimetrical networks are of interest. These are networks where the input and output impedances are the duals of each other.
; Lossless network: A lossless network is one which contains no resistors or other dissipative elements.

==Impedance parameters (&quot;z&quot;-parameters)==

All the -parameters have dimensions of ohms.

===Example: bipolar current mirror with emitter degeneration===
Figure 3 shows a bipolar current mirror with emitter resistors to increase its output resistance. Transistor is &quot;diode connected&quot;, which is to say its collector-base voltage is zero. Figure 4 shows the small-signal circuit equivalent to Figure 3. Transistor is represented by its emitter resistance : 
:formula_3 
a simplification made possible because the dependent current source in the hybrid-pi model for draws the same current as a resistor connected across . The second transistor is represented by its hybrid-pi model. Table 1 below shows the z-parameter expressions that make the z-equivalent circuit of Figure 2 electrically equivalent to the small-signal circuit of Figure 4.

The negative feedback introduced by resistors can be seen in these parameters. For example, when used as an active load in a differential amplifier, , making the output impedance of the mirror approximately 
:formula_10
compared to only without feedback (that is with = 0Ω). At the same time, the impedance on the reference side of the mirror is approximately 
:formula_11
only a moderate value, but still larger than with no feedback. In the differential amplifier application, a large output resistance increases the difference-mode gain, a good thing, and a small mirror input resistance is desirable to avoid Miller effect.

===History===
The -parameters were initially called &quot;series-parallel parameters&quot;. The term &quot;hybrid&quot; to describe these parameters was coined by D. A. Alsberg in 1953 in &quot;Transistor metrology&quot;. In 1954 a joint committee of the IRE and the AIEE adopted the term -&quot;parameters&quot; and recommended that these become the standard method of testing and characterising transistors because they were &quot;peculiarly adaptable to the physical characteristics of transistors&quot;. In 1956, the recommendation became an issued standard; 56 IRE 28.S2. Following the merge of these two organisations as the IEEE, the standard became Std 218-1956 and was reaffirmed in 1980, but has now been withdrawn.

==Inverse hybrid parameters (g-parameters) ==

:formula_23

where

:formula_24

Often this circuit is selected when a voltage amplifier is wanted at the output. Off-diagonal g-parameters are dimensionless, while diagonal members have dimensions the reciprocal of one another. The resistors shown in the diagram can be general impedances instead.

===Example: common-base amplifier===

Note: Tabulated formulas in Table 3 make the -equivalent circuit of the transistor from Figure 8 agree with its small-signal low-frequency hybrid-pi model in Figure 9. Notation: is base resistance of transistor, is output resistance, and is mutual transconductance. The negative sign for reflects the convention that are positive when directed &quot;into&quot; the two-port. A non-zero value for means the output current affects the input current, that is, this amplifier is bilateral. If , the amplifier is unilateral.

==&quot;ABCD&quot;-parameters == 
The -parameters are known variously as chain, cascade, or transmission parameters. There are a number of definitions given for parameters, the most common is,

:formula_25

Note: Some authors chose to reverse the indicated direction of I2 and suppress the negative sign on I2.

where

:formula_26

For reciprocal networks . For symmetrical networks . For networks which are reciprocal and lossless, and are purely real while and are purely imaginary.

This representation is preferred because when the parameters are used to represent a cascade of two-ports, the matrices are written in the same order that a network diagram would be drawn, that is, left to right. However, a variant definition is also in use,

:formula_27

where

:formula_28

The negative sign of arises to make the output current of one cascaded stage (as it appears in the matrix) equal to the input current of the next. Without the minus sign the two currents would have opposite senses because the positive direction of current, by convention, is taken as the current entering the port. Consequently, the input voltage/current matrix vector can be directly replaced with the matrix equation of the preceding cascaded stage to form a combined matrix.

The terminology of representing the parameters as a matrix of elements designated etc. as adopted by some authors and the inverse parameters as a matrix of elements designated etc. is used here for both brevity and to avoid confusion with circuit elements.

:formula_29

===Table of transmission parameters===
The table below lists and inverse parameters for some simple network elements.

==Scattering parameters (S-parameters)==
The previous parameters are all defined in terms of voltages and currents at ports. -parameters are different, and are defined in terms of incident and reflected waves at ports. -parameters are used primarily at UHF and microwave frequencies where it becomes difficult to measure voltages and currents directly. On the other hand, incident and reflected power are easy to measure using directional couplers. The definition is,

:formula_30

where the are the incident waves and the are the reflected waves at port . It is conventional to define the and in terms of the square root of power. Consequently, there is a relationship with the wave voltages (see main article for details).

For reciprocal networks . For symmetrical networks . For antimetrical networks . For lossless reciprocal networks formula_31 and formula_32

==Scattering transfer parameters (&quot;T&quot;-parameters)==

Scattering transfer parameters, like scattering parameters, are defined in terms of incident and reflected waves. The difference is that -parameters relate the waves at port 1 to the waves at port 2 whereas -parameters relate the reflected waves to the incident waves. In this respect -parameters fill the same role as parameters and allow the -parameters of cascaded networks to be calculated by matrix multiplication of the component networks. -parameters, like parameters, can also be called transmission parameters. The definition is,

:formula_33

-parameters are not as easy to measure directly as -parameters. However, -parameters are easily converted to -parameters, see main article for details.

==Combinations of two-port networks==
When two or more two-port networks are connected, the two-port parameters of the combined network can be found by performing matrix algebra on the matrices of parameters for the component two-ports. The matrix operation can be made particularly simple with an appropriate choice of two-port parameters to match the form of connection of the two-ports. For instance, the -parameters are best for series connected ports.

The combination rules need to be applied with care. Some connections (when dissimilar potentials are joined) result in the port condition being invalidated and the combination rule will no longer apply. A Brune test can be used to check the permissibility of the combination. This difficulty can be overcome by placing 1:1 ideal transformers on the outputs of the problem two-ports. This does not change the parameters of the two-ports, but does ensure that they will continue to meet the port condition when interconnected. An example of this problem is shown for series-series connections in figures 11 and 12 below.

===Series-series connection===

When two-ports are connected in a series-series configuration as shown in figure 10, the best choice of two-port parameter is the -parameters. The -parameters of the combined network are found by matrix addition of the two individual -parameter matrices.

:formula_34

As mentioned above, there are some networks which will not yield directly to this analysis. A simple example is a two-port consisting of a -network of resistors and . The -parameters for this network are;

:formula_35

Figure 11 shows two identical such networks connected in series-series. The total -parameters predicted by matrix addition are;

:formula_36

However, direct analysis of the combined circuit shows that,

:formula_37

The discrepancy is explained by observing that of the lower two-port has been by-passed by the short-circuit between two terminals of the output ports. This results in no current flowing through one terminal in each of the input ports of the two individual networks. Consequently, the port condition is broken for both the input ports of the original networks since current is still able to flow into the other terminal. This problem can be resolved by inserting an ideal transformer in the output port of at least one of the two-port networks. While this is a common text-book approach to presenting the theory of two-ports, the practicality of using transformers is a matter to be decided for each individual design.

===Parallel-parallel connection===

When two-ports are connected in a parallel-parallel configuration as shown in figure 13, the best choice of two-port parameter is the -parameters. The -parameters of the combined network are found by matrix addition of the two individual -parameter matrices.

:formula_38

===Series-parallel connection===

When two-ports are connected in a series-parallel configuration as shown in figure 14, the best choice of two-port parameter is the -parameters. The -parameters of the combined network are found by matrix addition of the two individual -parameter matrices.

:formula_39

===Parallel-series connection===

When two-ports are connected in a parallel-series configuration as shown in figure 15, the best choice of two-port parameter is the -parameters. The -parameters of the combined network are found by matrix addition of the two individual -parameter matrices.

:formula_40

===Cascade connection===

When two-ports are connected with the output port of the first connected to the input port of the second (a cascade connection) as shown in figure 16, the best choice of two-port parameter is the -parameters. The -parameters of the combined network are found by matrix multiplication of the two individual -parameter matrices.

:formula_41

A chain of two-ports may be combined by matrix multiplication of the matrices. To combine a cascade of -parameter matrices, they are again multiplied, but the multiplication must be carried out in reverse order, so that;

:formula_42

====Example====

Suppose we have a two-port network consisting of a series resistor followed by a shunt capacitor . We can model the entire network as a cascade of two simpler networks:

:formula_43

The transmission matrix for the entire network is simply the matrix multiplication of the transmission matrices for the two network elements:

:formula_44

Thus:

:formula_45

==Interrelation of parameters==

Where is the determinant of .

Certain pairs of matrices have a particularly simple relationship. The admittance parameters are the matrix inverse of the impedance parameters, the inverse hybrid parameters are the matrix inverse of the hybrid parameters, and the form of the -parameters is the matrix inverse of the form. That is,

:formula_46

==Networks with more than two ports==

While two port networks are very common (e.g., amplifiers and filters), other electrical networks such as directional couplers and circulators have more than 2 ports. The following representations are also applicable to networks with an arbitrary number of ports:

*Admittance () parameters
*Impedance () parameters
*Scattering () parameters

For example, three-port impedance parameters result in the following relationship:

:formula_47

However the following representations are necessarily limited to two-port devices:

*Hybrid () parameters
*Inverse hybrid () parameters
*Transmission () parameters
*Scattering transfer () parameters

==Collapsing a two-port to a one port==

A two-port network has four variables with two of them being independent. If one of the ports is terminated by a load with no independent sources, then the load enforces a relationship between the voltage and current of that port. A degree of freedom is lost. The circuit now has only one independent parameter. The two-port becomes a one-port impedance to the remaining independent variable.

For example, consider impedance parameters

:formula_1

Connecting a load, onto port 2 effectively adds the constraint 
:formula_49

The negative sign is because the positive direction for is directed into the two-port instead of into the load. The augmented equations become

:formula_50

The second equation can be easily solved for as a function of and that expression can replace in the first equation leaving ( and and ) as functions of 

:formula_51

So, in effect, sees an input impedance and the two-port&#x27;s effect on the input circuit has been effectively collapsed down to a one-port; i.e., a simple two terminal impedance.

<doc id="1301095" wikidata="Q3322358" url="?curid=1301095" title="Side friction roller coaster">
<text>A side friction roller coaster is an early roller coaster design invented by Edward Joy Morris. The design introduced side-friction wheels to help prevent trains from derailing during curved portions of the track. In addition to weight-bearing wheels traditionally located on the underside of each train car, friction wheels were added to both sides, which roll perpendicular along the inner edge of the track.

The first side-friction coasters appeared in the late 19th century and were mild in comparison to modern-day roller coasters. They declined in popularity several decades later as newer coasters began incorporating a third set of underfriction wheels, which further improved safety and allowed for more thrilling track designs.

==History==

The earliest gravity railways in the United States were used primarily to transport coal down mountains, often to the nearest river or canal. The Mauch Chunk Railway (MCR) in eastern Pennsylvania was constructed in 1827 and was the second of its kind in the US. Before long, tourists attracted to the novelty of this technology were offered rides. Passengers enjoyed panoramic views along the descent, which started at a leisurely and reached speeds up to . The MCR and similar attractions became widely known as scenic railways. The commercial success of these amusement rides inspired future advancements in what would eventually evolve into the modern-day roller coaster.

One passenger inspired by the MCR was inventor and businessman LaMarcus Adna Thompson, founder of the Eagle Knitting Company, a hosiery manufacturer. Building upon earlier ride patents for concepts never constructed, he developed his own patent called the Switchback Railway. The first installation opened as the Gravity Pleasure Switchback Railway at Coney Island in 1884.

In 1894, Edward Joy Morris took the concept one step further with the invention of side-friction wheels that were installed vertically on the sides of each train car, which were then seated in a trough configuration. Patented as the Figure Eight Toboggan Slide, the side-friction wheels made contact with the side rails, making derailment less likely.

Side-friction roller coasters could achieve greater speeds than the switchback design, especially around curves, which led to thrill-inducing lateral g-forces. The security of the updated design enabled roller coasters to operate without a brakeman, which were previously required to ride along and slow the train at various points along the track layout. Instead, ride operators working in the loading station only needed to rely on a hand-operated friction brake to stop the train when it returned.

Morris formed the Morris Chute Company, which manufactured carousels and roller coasters. More than 250 Figure Eight coasters, also called toboggans, were installed around the world. One of the well-known installations, Leap-The-Dips, opened in 1902 at Lakemont Park in Altoona, Pennsylvania. It is one of the last remaining side-friction coasters still in operation. In 1903, Morris sold the company, which reemerged in 1904 as the Philadelphia Toboggan Company. The invention of underfriction wheels, also called up-stop wheels, resulted in the demise of the side-friction configuration. Introduced in 1912 by John A. Miller, the newer design added a third set of wheels running beneath the track, further enhancing security from derailment, which paved the way for faster speeds, steeper drops, and new elements in track design such as the airtime hill.

==Notable installations==
*Leap the Dips at Lakemont Park in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Opened in 1902, Leap the Dips is the oldest roller coaster in the world and the last remaining side-friction roller coaster in North America. It was out of service from 1985 to 1999.
*Slope Shooter at the Higashiyama Zoo and Botanical Gardens, built in 1961. It has a long, winding layout, and has troughs made of steel and concrete.

<doc id="1301102" wikidata="Q2996846" url="?curid=1301102" title="Catherine Breshkovsky">
<text>Yekaterina Konstantinovna Breshko-Breshkovskaya (; born  – 12 September 1934), also known in English sources as Catherine Breshkovsky, was a major figure in the Russian socialist movement, a Narodnik, and later one of the founders of the Socialist Revolutionary Party. She has been described as Russia&#x27;s first female political prisoner.

She spent over four decades in prison and Siberian exile for peaceful opposition to Tsarism, acquiring, in her latter years, international stature as a political prisoner. Also popularly known as &#x27;&#x27;, Breshkovsky was the grandmother of the Russian Revolution.

==Early life==

Born as Yekaterina Konstantinovna Verigo into the Russian nobility in Ivanovo village, Nevelsky district, Vitebsk province, Breshkovsky grew up on the family estate in Chernigov province, and was educated at home. Her father, Konstantin Verigo, owned serfs, but—according to her account—treated them well. In 1861, during the Emancipation reform she helped her father free the serfs on the family estate then worked voluntarily to educate them. In 1868, she married Nikolay Petrovich Breshko-Breshkovsky, a landowner and country magistrate, but left him after two years and moved to Kiev where she formed a &#x27;commune&#x27; with her sister Olga (who died young) and Maria Kolenkina. The trio followed the anarchist Mikhail Bakunin, when most of the revolutionaries in Kiev were in a group led by Pavel Axelrod, followers of the populist revolutionary Pyotr Lavrov. Axelrod introduced her to Andrei Zhelyabov, the peasant&#x27;s son who organised the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881.

In February 1874, she gave birth to a son, Nikolay Breshko-Breshkovsky, and left him to be brought up by relatives. She did not see him again until he was aged 22, and learnt that they had nothing in common. He later became a thriller writer, and Nazi sympathiser. In July 1874, she, Kolenkina and Yakov Stefanovich decided to &#x27;go to the people&#x27; and set out with false passports, disguised as itinerants labourers, to settle in a village, where they tried to instill revolutionary ideas in the peasants. Warned of imminent arrest, Kolenkina returned to Kiev, while Breshkovsky and Stefanovich moved to another village, in Kherson province, where they came into contact with evangelical Protestants, known as the Stundists. Rejected by the Stundists, they moved on to Tulchyn. After Stefanovich returned to Kiev, Breshkovsky was arrested when a police officer checking her false passport noticed that she did not act as submissively as a peasant normally would.

== Imprisonment and exile ==
Breshkovsky was transported to St Petersburg, where, at 31, she was the oldest of 37 women held in the House of Preliminary Detention, all accused of political offences. Her defiant behaviour in the dock during the Trial of the 193, when she refused to recognise the court&#x27;s authority and announced that she was proud to belong to &#x27;the Russian socialistic and revolutionary party&#x27; led to her being convicted and sentenced to five years &quot;katorga&quot; (penal labour), whereas other female defendants, including the future regicide Sophia Perovskaya, were acquitted.

She was, reputedly, the first woman in Russia sentenced to &quot;katorga&quot; for a political offence, which earned her the respect of other revolutionaries. Her friend, Maria Kolenkina, was so incensed that she planned to kill the man who prosecuted Breshkovsky, but was foiled. Sergei Kravchinsky described her as &quot;passionate and prophetic&quot;, but Perovskaya reportedly treated her &quot;very coldly&quot;, finding her &quot;extreme&quot;.

In 1879, Breshkovsky&#x27;s sentence was commuted to exile in the Transbaikal region of Siberia. In 1881, she escaped, but was recaptured and sentenced to another four years katorga in the mines in Kara katorga, and to 40 lashes. but the local authorities did not dare carry out the flogging, for fear of reprisals. She was exiled again to Seleginsk village, in Transbaikal where the American journalist and explorer George Kennan interviewed her in 1885. He wrote:

Kennan was later quoted as saying: &quot;All my standards of courage, of fortitude, and of heroic self-sacrifice have been raised for all time, and raised by the hand of a woman&quot;.

== The Socialist Revolutionary Party ==
Breshkovsky was released in 1896, after 22 years in prison or exile, under an amnesty marking the coronation of the Nicholas II, the last Tsar of Russia. With some difficulty, she made contact with revolutionaries still at large, most of whom were many years younger than her. The most important was Grigory Gershuni, who was 26 years her junior. The two of them led a revival of the populist movement in Minsk, in 1897, where &quot;Breshkovskaya had a large following among the youth of the Minsk gymnasia; Gershuni led another group which debated tactical questions.&quot;

This was one of several groups brought together in 1901 to form the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. She and Gershuni then spent two years travelling illegally around Russia, organising the new party. &quot;There existed a kind of division of labour between them: Breshkovskaya, like a &#x27;Holy Ghost of the Revolution&#x27; flitted about the country, proselytising and inciting everywhere the revolutionary temper of the youth; Gershuni usually followed in her tracks and turned to practical account the enthusiasm she aroused.&quot; When Gershuni was arrested, in May 1903, she escaped abroad via Romania, to Geneva.

== U.S. tour ==
In 1904, Breshkovsky travelled to the U.S., where her name was well known because of George Kennan&#x27;s book. The trip turned her into a celebrity. In December 1904, nearly 3,000 people came to a meeting in Boston, organised to welcome her. According to a contemporary report &quot;When the &#x27;Grand Old Lady&#x27; got up to speak, the great audience rose en masse. Handkerchiefs waved, hats were flung into the air, words of affection in five languages were rained upon her.&quot; She also visited New York and Chicago, and was befriended by feminists such as Alice Stone Blackwell, Isabel Barrows and Helena Dudley. It was during this trip that she was given the nickname &#x27;Babushka&#x27;, the grandmother of the Revolution. She raised about $10,000 for the Socialist Revolutionary Party.

== Second arrest and exile ==
Breshkovsky returned to Russia in time for the outbreak of the 1905 Revolution. In August, the police spy Yevno Azef promised to lead the police to her, and travelled to Saratov with a senior officer, but failed to locate her. She was at large until 1908, when Azef again betrayed her to the police and she was interned in the Peter and Paul Fortress. Hearing of her arrest, Isabel Barrows sailed to Russia to plead for her release, and succeeded in persuading Nikolay Breshko-Breshkovsky to visit his mother in prison, despite his hostility to her beliefs. In 1910, she was sentenced to exile for life in Siberia, and deported to a village by the Lena River where she was kept under constant supervision.

In November 1913 now almost 70 years old, she attempted an escape that involved a journey by horseback of more than 620 miles to Irkutsk, but was recaptured only seven miles outside the city. She was held in solitary confinement in Irkutsk prison for two years, then deported to Yakutsk, close to the Arctic Circle, but after protests from her American sympathisers, was returned to Irkutsk.

== After the Revolution ==

One of the first acts of the Provisional Government that took office after the February Revolution of 1917 was to send Breshkovsky a special invitation to return to Petrograd, where she was personally welcomed by the Minister of Justice, and future Prime Minister, Alexander Kerensky, and by a huge crowd. Breshkovsky was elected in October 1917 to the Pre-Parliament, ahead of a nationwide election to a Constituent Assembly, and as its oldest member was appointed to chair its first meeting. By now, she was a legendary figure in Russia. The future Nobel prize winning writer Ivan Bunin overheard peasants talking about her in the summer of 1917. One said:

Actually, far from wanting to spare peasants from being called up for military service, she advocated continuing the war with Germany, and was one of the most committed and high-profile supporters of the Kerensky government. When it was overthrown in November by the Bolsheviks, she drafted an appeal to the Czechoslovak Legion to intervene to reinstate Kerensky by force. Late in 1918, she travelled via Vladivostok to the U.S., to appeal to the government to send 50,000 troops to support the anti-Bolshevik forces in the Russian Civil War. Later she moved to Paris, then in 1924 to Czechoslovakia, where she shared her final exile with Maria Kolenkina, a friendship that spanned more than 50 years.

<text>Lubitel (, Russian for &quot;amateur&quot;) refers to any of the several medium format twin-lens reflex cameras manufactured in Russia by LOMO.
The design is based on the early 1930s Voigtländer Brillant camera with various improvements.

They are often considered toy cameras due to their cheap price, bakelite and later thermoplastic construction and low build quality. However, the Lubitels use 120 film, feature Cooke triplet, all-glass lenses and shutter speeds from bulb to 1/250 of a second. Aperture range is from f/4.5 to f/22. These characteristics are closer to those of an amateur TLR of the 1950s than a toy or disposable camera. They can achieve excellent results when the lens is stopped down but, as with any three-element lens, the results will be soft by today&#x27;s standards at larger apertures.

Lubitel cameras are often used by art photographers or amateurs looking for a cheap introduction to medium format photography.

Models and years produced:
*The Komsomolets camera was a forerunner of the Lubitel. Unlike the Lubitel, it has a non-focusing viewfinder. It is a close copy of the Voigtländer Brillant.
*Lubitel TLR 1950-1956

<doc id="1301109" wikidata="Q1188874" url="?curid=1301109" title="Solar Maximum Mission">
<text>The Solar Maximum Mission satellite (or SolarMax) was designed to investigate Solar phenomena, particularly solar flares. It was launched on February 14, 1980. The SMM was the first satellite based on the Multimission Modular Spacecraft bus manufactured by Fairchild Industries, a platform which was later used for Landsat 4 and Landsat 5 as well as the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite.

After an attitude control failure in November 1980 it was put in standby mode until April 1984 when it was repaired by a Shuttle mission.

The Solar Maximum Mission ended on December 2, 1989, when the spacecraft re-entered the atmosphere and burned up over the Indian Ocean.

== Instruments ==

== Failure and repair ==

The white-light coronagraph/polarimeter (C/P) took coronal images for about six months from March 1980 before suffering an electronics failure in September that prevented operation.

In November 1980, the second of four fuses in SMM&#x27;s attitude control system failed, causing it to rely on its magnetorquers in order to maintain attitude. In this mode, only three of the seven instruments on board were usable, as the others required the satellite to be accurately pointed at the Sun. The use of the satellite&#x27;s magnetorquers prevented the satellite from being used in a stable position and caused it to &quot;wobble&quot; around its nominally sun-pointed attitude. SMM was left in standby mode for 3 years.

The first orbiting, uncrewed satellite to be repaired in space, SMM was notable in that its useful life compared with similar spacecraft was significantly increased by the direct intervention of a crewed space mission. During STS-41-C in April 1984, the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; rendezvoused with the SMM, astronauts James van Hoften and George Nelson attempted to use the Manned Maneuvering Unit to capture the satellite and to bring it into the orbiter&#x27;s payload bay for repairs and servicing. The plan was to use an astronaut-piloted Maneuvering Unit to grapple the satellite with the Trunnion Pin Attachment Device (TPAD) mounted between the hand controllers of the Maneuvering Unit, null its rotation rates, and allow the Shuttle to bring it into the Shuttle&#x27;s payload bay for stowage. Three attempts to grapple the satellite using the TPAD failed. The TPAD jaws could not lock onto Solar Max because of an obstructing grommet on the satellite not included in its blueprints.

This led to an improvised plan which nearly ended the satellite&#x27;s mission. The improvisation had the astronaut use his hands to grab hold of a solar array and null the rotation with a push from the Maneuvering Unit&#x27;s thrusters. Instead, this attempt induced higher rates and in multiple axes; the satellite was tumbling out of control and quickly losing battery life. SMM Operations Control Center engineers shut down all non-essential satellite subsystems and with a bit of luck were able to recover the satellite minutes before total failure. The ground support engineers then stabilized the satellite and nulled its rotation rates for capture with the Shuttle&#x27;s robotic arm. This proved to be a much better plan. The satellite had been fitted with one of the arm&#x27;s grapple fixtures so that the robotic arm was able to capture and maneuver it into the shuttle&#x27;s payload bay for repairs.

During the mission, the SMM&#x27;s entire attitude control system module and the electronics module for the coronagraph/polarimeter instrument were replaced, and a gas cover was installed over the X-ray polychromator. Their successful work added five more years to the lifespan of the satellite. The mission was depicted in the 1985 IMAX movie &quot;The Dream Is Alive&quot;.

== Discovery of comets ==
10 comets were discovered in images from the SMM, all of which are members of the Kreutz sungrazer group. 
== Findings ==

Significantly, the SMM&#x27;s ACRIM instrument package showed that contrary to expectations, the Sun is actually brighter during the sunspot cycle maximum (when the greatest number of dark &#x27;sunspots&#x27; appear). This is because sunspots are surrounded by bright features called faculae, which more than cancel the darkening effect of the sunspot.

The major scientific findings from the SMM are presented in several review articles in a monograph.

== End of mission ==
SMM&#x27;s orbit slowly decayed due to atmospheric drag taking it down into denser regions. The March 1989 geomagnetic storm was reported to have led to SMM dropping half a kilometre at the start of the storm and 5 kilometres over the whole period. The satellite eventually lost attitude control on November 17, 1989, and re-entry and burn-up occurred on December 2, 1989, over the Indian Ocean.

<text>Sir Frank Bowden, 1st Baronet, (30 January 1848 – 25 April 1921) was a British businessman and inventor. He was a founder of the Raleigh Bicycle Company.

==Biography==
Frank Bowden was born in Devon, England, and made a fortune in property development in Hong Kong in the 1870s. In 1879, he married Amelia Frances, an American heiress. When he returned from Hong Kong he was seriously ill and his doctor gave him six months to live. Bowden took up cycling on his doctor&#x27;s advice and bought a bicycle from a small shop on Raleigh Street, Nottingham, run by Messrs Woodhead, Angois and Ellis. He was so impressed with his recovering health and the bicycle that in 1887–88 he acquired control of the company, which was then making three bicycles a week. Production rose, and three years later Bowden needed a bigger workshop, which he found in a four-storey building in Russell Street. He changed the company&#x27;s name to Raleigh Cycles to commemorate the original address. By 1896 it was the largest bicycle manufacturer in the world and occupied seven and a half acres in Faraday Road, Nottingham. He lived at The Ropewalk, Nottingham.
He also helped build up Sturmey Archer Gears.

He wrote &quot;Cycling for Health and Points For Cyclists&quot; in 1913. 
In 1915 he was created a baronet of the City of Nottingham. He became a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and a Justice of the Peace.

==Family==
Bowden married Amelia Frances, daughter of Colonel Alexander Houston, of California, on 17 September 1879. The couple had six children: Helen, Winifred, Caroline, Sylvia, Harold and Claud.

==Death==
Sir Frank died in April 1921, aged 73, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son Sir Harold Bowden, 2nd Baronet who ran Raleigh for the next 17 years and became President of the British Cycle and Motor-Cycle Manufacturers and Trader Union. Lady Bowden died in 1937.

<doc id="1301119" wikidata="Q3504240" url="?curid=1301119" title="Super Monkey Ball 2">
<text>is a platform video game developed by Amusement Vision and published by Sega for the GameCube. It is the second installment in the &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot; series, and the first installment to have a storyline and to be exclusively released on a home console.

&quot;Super Monkey Ball 2&quot;″s stages were remade as a part of &quot;Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania&quot;.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Super Monkey Ball 2&quot; continues its predecessor&#x27;s core &quot;Marble Madness&quot;-style gameplay. The player controls a monkey running in a ball with the joystick through maze-like stages with obstacles to dodge, which have to be completed under a time limit without the monkey falling off platform ledges. As the game progresses, there are more paths that loop, spin and corkscrew, and levels that move horizontally, vertically and 360-degrees. The sequel has a more spiked difficulty curve as a result of new design choices. Looped paths occasionally have obstacles and cockscrewed paths within them and some rotating stages have pillars popping out of holes. Another addition is switches scattered throughout that fast-forward, rewind, play and stop platforms while rolled over onto them, making the sequel more focused on strategy and puzzle-solving.

Unlike the first entry, &quot;Super Monkey Ball 2&quot; has a single-player Story Mode grouping levels by ten. Dr. Bad-Boon is an evil scientist who steals all of the bananas from Monkey Island, putting four protagonists, AiAi, MeeMee, GonGon and Baby into action to chase him through booby-trapped stages he has set up. The story takes place over 100 levels split between ten worlds with animated cutscenes that play in between each. The player is given an infinite number of lives and can complete each world&#x27;s ten stages in any order.

Challenge mode allows up to four players and plays like the main mode of the original &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot;. There are three difficulty levels: Beginner, Advanced and Expert, consisting of 10, 30 and 50 floors each. Players navigate each set in order with a limited number of lives and continues. Beginner Extra, Advanced Extra and Expert Extra floors are unlocked when each respective difficulty level is completed without a single continue. There are ten extra stages in each difficulty. A hidden set of ten Master floors can be unlocked through playing the Expert Extra floors without using a continue. At this point, the player will be able to select this difficulty as if it were a normal mode. If a player completes all ten Master stages without using a continue, they will go to the Master Extra stages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Super Monkey Ball 2 - Expert-Master Extra [Deathless/Warpless]&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multiplayer ===
There are 12 multiplayer mini-games, six of them reprisals from the predecessor with more gameplay styles and level types: Monkey Race, Monkey Fight, Monkey Target, Monkey Billiards, Monkey Bowling and Monkey Golf. Monkey Golf rejects the mini-golf courses of the first game for larger environments standard of regular golf, with terrain and wind affecting the power and trajectory of a shot, and the ability to drive and chip.

Monkey Race allows players to race up to eight computer opponents, larger than the previous game&#x27;s three, and has new weapons such as the Hunter Missile which shoots several rockets at a time. Having only three arenas, Monkey Fight introduces crumbling fighting rings, the ability to charge a fight, and a sudden death mode. Monkey Billiards has Japanese 9 ball and Rotation as new gameplay modes, as well as a few more camera angle options.

Monkey Bowling contains a Special Mode in addition to the typical game present in the first. It has ten lanes that feature non-linear paths, such as zig-zag and concave, and moving parts. The monkeys also differ in attributes, such as GonGon being the best with speed and Baby better at maneuverability. Like the first game&#x27;s mode, Monkey Target has the player controlling a gliding monkey to land on a target while avoiding falling into the water. However, it differs in how items are collected; instead of receiving them from bananas, which are now only points, they are now in the middle of the air to be collected on the monkey&#x27;s trajectory. Formation flying, where the direction of up to five monkeys can be controlled simultaneously, and a split-screen feature of up to four players are additions.

The other six mini-games, Monkey Tennis, Monkey Baseball, Monkey Soccer, Monkey Boat, Monkey Shot and Monkey Dogfight, are introduced to the series. Some of these are replicas of Sega&#x27;s &quot;Virtua&quot; franchises, such as &quot;Virtua Striker&quot; (1995–2004), &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; (1994–2003), and &quot;Virtua Tennis&quot; (1999–2012). In Monkey Baseball, the rolling monkey ball is pitched to the batter onto ramps that serve as bases and the home plate and lead into the outfield. Monkey Boat involves the racers kayaking down a river, with player&#x27;s only control being the shoulder buttons to steer. Monkey Shot is a light gun shooter that also involves moving down a track, but to shoot at incoming enemies, missiles, and bosses while collecting items like upgrades to automatic guns. In Monkey Dogfight, the monkeys fly and shoot at each other.

==Reception==

The game won the E3 2002 Game Critics Awards for Best Puzzle/Trivia/Parlor Game. &quot;GameSpot&quot; named it the best GameCube game of August 2002, and later declared it 2002&#x27;s &quot;Best Party Game on GameCube&quot;. It was nominated for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Sound on GameCube&quot; and &quot;Game of the Year on GameCube&quot; awards, which went to &quot;Eternal Darkness: Sanity&#x27;s Requiem&quot; and &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, respectively.

&quot;Super Monkey Ball 2&quot; received &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews from critics. Metacritic gave the video game a Metascore of 87, based on 34 reviews. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Matt Casamassina praised the game for its core gameplay concepts, stating that it was &quot;just as simple as the original, and also just as addictive... But where it&#x27;s an entertaining single-player experience, it&#x27;s a superb multiplayer one. All of the revamped mini-games are fantastic... this is one of the best multiplayer games for GCN, without a doubt and hands down.&quot;

Critics highlighted the level design, particularly the enhancements. Ryan Davis of &quot;GameSpot&quot; called it &quot;bolder,&quot; Casamassina &quot;revamped and fantastic,&quot; &quot;more inspired and more extravagant.&quot; He noted their increased difficulty, where some tasks seem insurmountable initially. However, he also wrote they were addictive, where even skilled players who already defeated the harder stages would come back to figure out shortcuts and tricks to beat them in a shorter amount of time. He also positively noted the pacing, specifically the constant introduction of a new challenge every level. Mike Orlando of &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; favorably discussed the levels&#x27; increased interactivity and strategy as a result of the introduction of switches, as well as the complexity of models built with otherwise simple polygons. Although finding a few stages gimmicky, particularly Launchers, he claimed the Labyrinth level was better than any stage in the first game.

The plot and cutscenes in the Story Mode were described as suitable to the exuberant nature of the overall experience, if &quot;simple and at times ridiculous, weird and borderline disturbing&quot;. Orlando dismissed the story as having confusing concepts, such as the monkeys conjuring magical spells and GonGon chanting &quot;Ei Ei Poo.&quot; However, he praised the Story Mode&#x27;s inclusion as allowing less experienced players to enjoy a majority of the stages where they could not in the challenge mode.

Casamassina highlighted the limitless possibilities of play additions to the returning party mini-games provided. He reported a huge amount of depth in Monkey Bowling alone, to the point where it could have been its own game. He also praised the new mini-games, although argued they were not &quot;as well conceived.&quot; Tennis was his most favorite of them for its combination of elements from &quot;Mario Tennis&quot; (2000) and &quot;Virtua Tennis&quot;, and the potential long replay value from the two-versus-two mode. Less favorably, he found Monkey Bassball too basic to be enjoyable for lengthy sessions, disliked Monkey Soccer&#x27;s controls, and noted high difficulty in playing the otherwise fun Monkey Target and Monkey Boat Race. Orlando positively found &quot;Super Monkey Ball 2&quot;″s Monkey Race more competitive than the first game&#x27;s, coming from the higher number of opponents and less complicated tracks. He also enjoyed the formation flying and addition of a multiplayer mode in Monkey Target, as well as the Special Mode in Monkey Bowling for adding replay value. He also enjoyed Monkey Golf, although was confused by the wind and power shot statistics. Monkey Boat Race was noted by Orlando and Casamassina for its learning curve when it came to paddling the boat, which they wrote was rewarding.

Critics praised the use of animated assets in the backgrounds, such as volcanos, lava flows, clock gears and space stations, solving the first game&#x27;s issues of drab, empty environments. They also appreciated the use of particle and lighting effects, such as sparks when a ball hits the ground and Volcanic Magma&#x27;s flying embers.

The similarity between the first and second games&#x27; upbeat techno music, voice clips and sound effects were noted. However, Orlando highlighted the increased variety and depth to the soundtrack, and particularly enjoyed the music of the multiplayer modes.

By July 2006, &quot;Super Monkey Ball 2&quot; had sold 760,000 copies and earned $22 million in the United States. &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it as the 80th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Combined sales of games in the &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot; series released between those dates reached 1.1 million units in the United States by July 2006. The game sold well enough to warrant a GameCube Player&#x27;s Choice budget re-release game.
== Legacy and impact ==
A 2002 study recognized &quot;Super Monkey Ball 2&quot; as one of several video games associated with improved performance in laparoscopic surgery. An extended study, performed over three years with 300 participants, found that surgeons who played &quot;Super Monkey Ball 2&quot; and other video games for at least six minutes prior to operating performed better in a virtual surgery simulation than surgeons that did not play. Results include a significant drop in errors and an increase in speed and overall score. In response to these findings, Dr. James Rosser created a gaming area in the physician&#x27;s lounge at Florida Hospital Celebration Health, saying &quot;I want all the surgeons to warm-up and make sure they give &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot; a chance.&quot;

<doc id="1301134" wikidata="Q575912" url="?curid=1301134" title="Alaska's Flag">
<text>Alaska&#x27;s Flag is the state song of Alaska.

==Lyrics==
Unique among state songs, its lyrics explain the symbolism of the Alaskan flag. The lyrics are:

Eight stars of gold on a field of blue&lt;br&gt;
Alaska&#x27;s flag. May it mean to you&lt;br&gt;
The blue of the sea, the evening sky,&lt;br&gt;
The mountain lakes, and the flow&#x27;rs nearby;&lt;br&gt;
The gold of the early sourdough&#x27;s dreams,&lt;br&gt;
The precious gold of the hills and streams;&lt;br&gt;
The brilliant stars in the northern sky,&lt;br&gt;
The &quot;Bear,&quot; the &quot;Dipper,&quot; and, shining high,&lt;br&gt;
The great North Star with its steady light,&lt;br&gt;
O&#x27;er land and sea a beacon bright.&lt;br&gt;
Alaska&#x27;s flag to Alaskans dear,&lt;br&gt;
The simple flag of a last frontier. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The connection between the song and the flag happened both by design and circumstance. It was the result of the linkage among three individuals: Benny Benson, Marie Drake, and Elinor Dusenbury. They did not directly collaborate, but instead, Marie Drake built on the work of Benny Benson, and Elinor Dusenbury built on the work of the other two. Benson inspired the effort, Drake wrote the lyrics, and Dusenbury composed the song.

==History==

Alaska&#x27;s official flag is based on Benny Benson&#x27;s design, which was submitted in a Territory-wide contest for schoolchildren sponsored by the American Legion in 1926. At that time Benny was a thirteen-year-old seventh-grader of Russian-Aleut and Swedish descent, studying at the Territorial School at Seward and a resident of the Jesse Lee Mission Home. The Alaska Territorial Legislature officially adopted his design on May 2, 1927. The proclamation praised his winning entry for, &quot;its simplicity, its originality and its symbolism.&quot; On the design submission, Benny had written the following words of explanation: “The blue field is for the Alaska sky and the forget-me-not, an Alaska flower. The North Star is for the future of the state of Alaska, the most northerly in the Union. The dipper is for the Great Bear — symbolizing strength.”

Alaska Department of Education employee Marie Drake echoed Benny Benson&#x27;s explanation of his design in a poem she wrote in 1935. Marie Drake had become the Territorial Assistant Commissioner of Education in 1934.
She edited and wrote most of the material for the School Bulletin, which was circulated throughout the Territorial school system. The poem first appeared on the cover of the October 1935 School Bulletin.

Elinor Dusenbury soon composed a song around the poem and the flag. The wife of the Commanding Officer of the Chilkoot Barracks at Haines from 1933 to 1936, she had fallen deeply in love with Alaska, but she left when her husband was transferred. She said, &quot;I wrote the music for Marie&#x27;s beautiful poetry from pure unadulterated homesickness for Alaska! I shed more tears on the boat going out than I ever have before or since. I had a book on Alaska with the picture the flag and Marie&#x27;s poem.&quot; In the summer of 1938, Dusenbury visited Juneau and played her setting of the poem for Marie on the piano at the Baranof Hotel. Happiness came to the poet&#x27;s eyes.

The song began gradually to be played unofficially, and steadily grew in popularity over the next two decades.
To the surprise and delight of both women, the Territorial Legislature adopted &quot;Alaska&#x27;s Flag&quot; in 1955. It became the official State song when the Territory of Alaska entered the union as the 49th state in 1959.

==Historical notes==
Benny Benson chose the background color of the flag to represent both the blue sky and the forget-me-not. The Legislature later named the forget-me-not as the official State flower. This provides another symbolic link, one between the official State flag, the official song and the official flower.

The late Carol Beery Davis, a Juneau resident and musician, wrote a second verse to the Alaska Flag song and gifted the words (protected by copyright) to the University of Alaska Foundation in 1987. It has been unsuccessfully proposed as an addition to the official lyrics several times. The last time was during the legislative session of 2011, but the time limit in the Senate expired before the bill could come up for a vote.

<doc id="1301136" wikidata="Q171976" url="?curid=1301136" title="Alexander Ostrovsky">
<text>Alexander Nikolayevich Ostrovsky (; ) was a Russian playwright, generally considered the greatest representative of the Russian realistic period. The author of 47 original plays, Ostrovsky &quot;almost single-handedly created a Russian national repertoire.&quot; His dramas are among the most widely read and frequently performed stage pieces in Russia.

== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
Alexander Nikolayevich Ostrovsky was born on 12 April 1823, in the Zamoskvorechye region of Moscow, to Nikolai Fyodorovich Ostrovsky, a lawyer who had received a seminary education. Nikolai&#x27;s ancestors came from the village Ostrov in the Nerekhta region of the Kostroma Governorate (north-east of Moscow), hence their surname. Later Nikolai Ostrovsky became a high-ranking state official and as such in 1839 received a title of nobility with corresponding privileges. His first wife ( Alexander&#x27;s mother), Lyubov Ivanovna Savvina, came from a clergyman&#x27;s family. For some time the family lived in a rented flat in the Zamoskvorechye. Then Nikolai Fyodorovich bought a plot of land in Monetchiki and built a house on it. In the early 1826 the family moved there.

Alexander had three siblings, sister Natalya, and brothers Mikhail and Sergey. The former was his major companion in their childhood years, and from her and her girl-friends the boy learned such unmanly things as sewing and knitting. Nanny Avdotya Kutuzova played an important role in his upbringing too. Ostrovsky insisted that the fairy-tales she told him inspired one of his most popular plays, &quot;The Snow Maiden&quot;.

In 1831 Ostrovsky&#x27;s mother died. In 1834 Nikolay Fyodorovich sold the Monetchiki house and bought two new ones, on Zhitnaya street. Two years later he married Baroness Emilia Andreyevna von Tessin, a noblewoman of Russian and Swedish descent. She rearranged the patriarchal ways of the Zamoskvorechye house, making it look more like a European mansion, and made sure that her stepchildren would receive high-quality education. Emilia Andreyevna had four children of her own, one of whom, Pyotr Ostrovsky, later became Alexander&#x27;s good friend. She knew several European languages, played the piano and taught Alexander to read music.

In 1840 Ostrovsky graduated from the First Moscow Gymnasium and enrolled at Moscow University to study law. His tutors there included such prominent scholars of the time as professors Pyotr Redkin, Timofey Granovsky and Mikhail Pogodin. Soon the family moved into the house on the Yauza River owned by Ivan Tessin, Alexander&#x27;s step-mother&#x27;s brother. At this time Ostrovsky started to write poetry, sketches and occasionally plays (none of the latter have survived), and by the end of his second year he had become a theatre enthusiast, spending many an evening at the Moscow Petrovsky Theatre. In May 1843 Ostrovsky failed the Roman Law exams and left the university to join the Moscow as a clerk. In 1845 his father had him transferred to the Moscow Commercial Court,
which specialised mostly in cases related to bribery and corruption. &quot;If not for such an unpleasant occasion there wouldn&#x27;t have been such a play as &quot;A Profitable Position&quot;,&quot; Ostrovsky noted later. In 1851 Ostrovsky made a decision to devote himself entirely to literature and theatre.

===Literary career===
In the mid-1840s Ostrovsky wrote numerous sketches and scenes inspired by the activities of the Zamoskvorechye merchant community and made a draft for the play called &quot;The Bankrupt&quot;. An extract from this comedy (&quot;Scenes from the comedy &quot;The Bankrupt&quot;&quot;) was published in the No.7, 1847, issue of &quot;Moskovsky Gorodskoi Listok&quot; () as a collaboration with actor and a minor dramatist Dmitry Gorev who had co-written one scene of it. Also in &quot;Listok&quot; appeared (as unsigned) &quot;Pictures of Moscow Life&quot; and &quot;The Picture of a Family Happiness&quot;, two sets of scenes which were later published in &quot;Sovremennik&quot; (No. 4, 1856) under the title &quot;The Family Picture&quot; (Семейная картина). Ostrovsky regarded it as his first original work and the starting point of his literary career.

On 14 February 1847 Ostrovsky made his public debut in the house of the university professor and literary critic Stepan Shevyryov, with the readings from &quot;The Pictures&quot;. The audience, which included Aleksey Khomyakov and several members of the &quot;Listok&quot; staff, responded positively: both Shevyryov and Khomyakov speaking of the emergence of a new major talent in Russian literature. On 27 August 1851, &quot;The Picture of Family Happiness&quot; (which reportedly the approval of (among others) Nikolai Gogol) was banned from being produced by Imperial Theatres. &quot;Judging by these scenes what the Moscow merchants only do is cheat customers and drink while their wives are cheating on them&quot;, censor M. Gedeonov wrote.

In December 1849 &quot;The Bankrupt&quot; was finished. Ostrovsky&#x27;s first audience was his university friend Alexey Pisemsky, who greeted it rapturously. The actor Prov Sadovsky, who described the comedy as a &#x27;revelation&#x27;, started to recite fragments of it, notably in the Countess Rostopchina&#x27;s salon, frequented by the young authors like Boris Almazov, Nikolai Berg, Lev Mei and Yevgeny Edelson, Ostrovsky&#x27;s friends from his university years. All of them soon accepted Mikhail Pogodin&#x27;s invitation and joined &quot;Moskvityanin&quot; to form there the so-called &quot;youth faction&quot;. Apollon Grigoriev, the informal leader of the team, started to actively promote Ostrovsky as a driving force of what he saw as the &quot;new, authentic Russian literature&quot;.

The so-called &quot;Ostrovsky circle&quot; united many of his non-literary friends too, among them actor Prov Sadovsky, musician and folklorist Terty Filippov, merchant Ivan Shanin, shoe-maker Sergey Volkov, teacher Dyakov and Ioasaf Zheleznov, a Cossack from the Urals, all attracted by the idea of Russian national revival (&quot;narodnost&quot;). It was then that Ostrovsky, initially a Westernizer, started to drift towards the Slavophiles. In the Rostopchina Salon he first met the young Ivan Turgenev and the veteran Russian mason Yury Bartenev. By this time Ostrovsky was living with Agafya Ivanova, his civil wife, whom he first met and became close to in the late 1840s.

====1850–1853====

Finally approved by censors, &quot;The Bankrupt&quot; appeared in the March issue of &quot;Moskvityanin&quot; under the new title &quot;It&#x27;s a Family Affair-We&#x27;ll Settle It Ourselves&quot; (Свои люди – сочтёмся!). The play, portraying the rude, ignorant and smug merchants of Moscow, made Ostrovsky instantly famous in the city. It was promptly banned from being produced by Imperial Theatres (the ban would be lifted in ten years) and even prompted Russian secret police to put the author under close surveillance. Ostrovsky tried his hand as a Shakespeare translator, but his 1852 version of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; () was banned as well: the censor Nordstrom found more than one hundred &quot;rude&quot; words and phrases in it and declared the translation &quot;true to the spirit of the original, quite indecent and totally unacceptable for the Russian theatre&quot;. Ostrovsky found solace in work for &quot;Moskvityanin&quot; and made a debut there as a critic, providing a positive review of &quot;The Muff&quot; by Aleksey Pisemsky.

Ostrovsky&#x27;s second play was the one-act piece &quot;The Young Man&#x27;s Morning&quot; (Утро молодого человека, 1850), partly based upon his early play &quot;The Legal Case&quot; (Исковое прошение; another act of the latter would later be developed into &quot;The Picture of Family Happiness&quot;). The follow-up, a psychological piece in the style of Alfred de Musset called &quot;The Surprise Case&quot; (Неожиданный случай, 1850), appeared in the &quot;Kometa&quot; almanac. Mikhail Pogodin was unimpressed and &quot;Sovremennik&quot;″s Ivan Panaev responded with a caustic review, parodying what he saw as its characters&#x27; vapid, insubstantial dialogues. Ostrovsky&#x27;s second full-length play, &quot;The Poor Bride&quot; (Бедная невеста), appeared in the No.4, 1852 issue of &quot;Moskvityanin&quot;. Censors gave their permission only after six months, but mangled the text in such a way that Ostrovsky lost all interest and asked the Maly inspector Alexey Verstovsky to forget about it and wait for the publication of the next play which he&#x27;d been working on already.

The melodramatic &quot;Stay in Your Own Sled&quot; (Не в свои сани не садись, 1852), less daring than &quot;Family Affair&quot; and not as ambitious as &quot;The Poor Bride&quot;, was published in &quot;Moskvityanin&quot; and became the first Ostrovsky&#x27;s play to make it on to the Maly Theatre stage. It premiered in January 1853, enjoyed great success, and was received rapturously even by Ostrovsky&#x27;s detractors like Vasily Botkin. With Lyubov Nikulina-Kositskaya in the leading role, the play, according to Lakshin, marked the birth of what would later be known as the &quot;Ostrovsky Theatre, the true union of the drama and the actors.&quot; During its first season the play ran for twelve performances in the Maly, and as many times in the Bolshoy Theatre.

In the early February 1853 Ostrovsky went to Saint Petersburg for the first time where he was warmly received by Alexander Gedeonov, the director of the Imperial Theatres. On 12 February 1853, &quot;The Young Man&#x27;s Morning&quot; was premiered at the Saint Petersburg Circus Theatre and on 19 February &quot;Stay in Your Own Sled&quot; was for the first time staged by Alexandrinsky Theatre. Tsar Nicholas I came to see the performance and left much impressed, mostly by its &#x27;edifying&#x27; finale. He figured out the play&#x27;s idea as being that &quot;children should follow their parents&#x27; advice, otherwise, everything goes wrong&quot; and, turning to Gedeonov and his own entourage, pronounced: &quot;There haven&#x27;t been many plays that gave me this much pleasure,&quot; adding in French: &quot;Се n&#x27;est pas une piece, c&#x27;est une lecon&quot; (This is not a play, but a lesson). Next day the Tsar brought his family to the theatre. Ostrovsky, though, had to leave the capital before the play&#x27;s premiere upon receiving the news of his father&#x27;s serious illness. By the time he arrived home, Nikolai Fyodorovich has been dead.

In August 1863 &quot;The Poor Bride&quot; was successfully performed at the Maly with Ekaterina Vasilyeva starring as Mariya Andreyevna. The same month Ostrovsky started to work on his next play &quot;Poverty is No Vice&quot; (Бедность не порок) and finished it in just two months to be produced by Maly Theatre as a benefit for Prov Sadovsky who played &#x27;virtuous drunkard&#x27; Lyubim Tortsov. &quot;Poverty is No Vice&quot;, reproducing the atmosphere of the old Russian folk carnival, svyatki, lacked the &quot;Bankrupt&quot;″s social awareness, but highlighted the conflict between the Slavophiles and Westernizers, the latter satirized by the author. It became popular in Moscow and prompted Apollon Grigoriev rapturous review called &quot;Step Aside, There Goes Lyubim Tortsov.&quot; In Saint Petersburg, though, it was criticized by Krayevsky &quot;Otechestvennye zapiski&quot; (which referred to Lyubim as &#x27;drunken lout&#x27;) and by the anonymous &quot;Sovremennik&quot; reviewer who happened to be the young Nikolay Chernyshevsky.

Ostrovsky&#x27;s rise to fame in both major cities was quick, but a serious opposition has already formed, notably among the Moscow actors, including Mikhail Shchepkin, Dmitry Lensky, Sergey Shumsky and Ivan Samarin. Another influential detractor was the poet Nikolay Sherbina. &quot;What kind of characters, what sort of language!.. Only in kabaks and indecent houses do people speak and act this way. Some would argue that such things do happen in real life. But we see all kind of things around us, not all of them can be put to stage. This is theatre, after all, not some market-place show or a backyard where one is free to spill garbage out,&quot; Lensky complained in a letter to a friend. Nevertheless, Maly became the second home to Ostrovsky and he was now spending there more and more of his time, often staying for the night.

====1854–1856====
By 1854 Russia has been deeply involved in the Crimean War. Sickened by the wave of what he felt to be the government-induced &#x27;trumpet patriotism,&#x27; Ostrovsky became reclusive and developed the urge to explore his own &#x27;national roots&#x27;. &quot;The cult of simplicity has now become his mania,&quot; biographer Lakshin wrote. He shifted still closer to the Slavophile doctrine with his next play, &quot;Don&#x27;t Live as You Like&quot; (Не живи, как хочется, 1854), portraying the Maslenitsa pagan folk carnival, as celebrated in the 18th century Moscow. The response to the play that premiered in the Maly on 3 December 1854, with Kornely Poltavtsev as Pyotr, was lukewarm. Some saw it as not daring enough, others as too outspoken. &quot;I was expecting the new Ostrovsky play to stir up the public in a big way but it succeeded in stirring only the negativism among critics who, unfortunately, this time proved right. It is sad to see such a talented man as Ostrovsky being so self-indulgent, spreading filth around. Once soap has become his worst enemy one can never approach him with advice, for any criticism he sees as a swipe at his &#x27;simplicity&#x27; thing. The worst thing that can happen to an author is when he finds himself among those who regard him as demi-god,&quot; the writer Sofia Engelgardt wrote to Alexander Druzhinin. Leo Tolstoy was among those few who liked it. The play ran for just four performances in Moscow and three times in Saint Petersburg&#x27;s Alexandrinka, before being dropping from both theatres&#x27; repertoires.

Meanwhile, Ostrovsky&#x27;s quest for &#x27;simplicity&#x27; appeared to be contagious. &quot;[The Russian] authors took their cues from the success of &quot;The Sledge&quot; and decided it was time to come out all &#x27;natural&#x27;. Unfortunately, this naturalism of theirs revolves around the same kind of talk, the same &#x27;sermyaga coats&#x27; which are now inundating our theatrical stage,&quot; Verstovsky complained in a December 1854 letter to Gedeonov. That was probably the first time the phrase &quot;sermyaga coat&quot; was applied to Ostrovsky&#x27;s work, a cliché that dogged him for the rest of his life.

In February 1855 Tsar Nikolai I died and the word &#x27;thaw&#x27;, first used in the political sense by Fyodor Tyutchev, entered the Russian cultural elite&#x27;s lexicon. Nikolay Nekrasov&#x27;s &quot;Sovremennik&quot; and Alexander Herzen&#x27;s &quot;Kolokol&quot; started to gain popularity. Ostrovsky, although wary of radicalism, couldn&#x27;t fail to respond to this new development. In December 1855 he finished &quot;Hangover at Somebody Else&#x27;s Feast&quot; (В чужом пиру похмелье) featuring a noble old teacher Ivanov as the main character and also Tit Titych, a boorish type of a family dictator for whom Ostrovsky coined the term &#x27;samodur&#x27; which caught on instantly. &quot;For Ostrovsky the &#x27;samodur&#x27; word became what &#x27;nihilist&#x27; was for Turgenev or &#x27;oblomovshchina&#x27; for Goncharov,&quot; biographer Lakshin remarked. The play was premiered in Moscow on 9 January 1856, with Prov Sadovsky as Tit Titych and had massive success. 1855 and 1856 were the years when the once famous Ostrovsky&#x27;s circle disbanded with Tertiy Filippov joining the pro-Slavophile &quot;Russkaya Beseda&quot; and Apollon Grigoriev departing to France.

==== &quot;Sovremennik&quot; years====

Nikolai Nekrasov&#x27;s team has long been discussing the prospects of tempting Ostrovsky from &quot;Moskvityanin&quot; over to &quot;Sovremennik&quot;, and in late 1855 he made a trip to Saint Petersburg to spend most of his time with the authors of that magazine, striking friendship with the young Leo Tolstoy. Nekrasov talked Ostrovsky into signing a four-year contract and published his first play &quot;The Pictures of Family Happiness&quot;, under the new title &quot;The Family Picture&quot;, as it has become known since.

In 1856 Grand Duke Konstantin offered several Russian writers an assignment to visit different Russian regions and provide authoritative accounts of both the industrial and everyday life there, originally with the view of gathering some basic data needed for the reformation of the Russian Navy&#x27;s recruiting system. Ostrovsky (who had to ask for special permission to be added as a volunteer to the list of eight) travelled from the Volga River&#x27;s beginnings down to Nizhny Novgorod and, apart from collecting the information requested, compiled a dictionary of local terms concerning navigation, shipbuilding and fishery. For the first time in his life he came into contact with the provincial Russian intelligentsia, the people who knew real life and had strong opinions about it. Travelling through poor, often devastated areas made profound effect upon the author who until then knew well only the life of merchants, state officials and minor noblemen.

The trip was marred by two incidents. In May 1856, as the allegations of plagiarism have been made against him in both major cities, based upon his ex-co-author Gorev&#x27;s accusations, Ostrovsky had to provide his own account of the history of the &quot;Family Affair&quot; for &quot;Moskovsky Vestnik&quot; and &quot;Sovremennik&quot;. Nekrasov supported him; besides, the Russian press&#x27; interest in Gorev died out the moment he published his own play &quot;Here and There&quot; (Сплошь да рядом, &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot;, No.56, 1856), to disastrous effect. Then in Kalyazin, Ostrovsky&#x27;s carriage overturned. He spent two months in bed with a broken leg and had to return home for further treatment. Despite urges from Ivan Panaev to start writing, he returned to Upper Volga in the spring of 1857 and resumed his journey, visiting Rybinsk, Uglich and Nizhny Novgorod in the summer. Eventually &quot;Morskoi Sbornik&quot; published only one of Ostrovsky&#x27;s reports. Since this magazine, keen on facts and figures, omitted details it deemed &#x27;too artistic&#x27;, the author decided to abandon the project entirely. It was while on this trip that Ostrovsky came up with the idea of writing a series of plays called &quot;The Nights on the Volga&quot;. The project never materialised but numerous real-life stories gathered during this voyage would be used in later plays, notably &quot;The Storm&quot;. Also based on this material were his 1860s historical dramas &quot;Kozma Zakhar&#x27;yich Minin-Sukhoruk&quot;, &quot;The False Dmitry and Vasily Shuysky&quot; and &quot;Vasilisa Melentyeva&quot;, as well as the comedy &quot;Voyevoda&quot;. After his Volga trip Ostrovsky totally lost interest in the &quot;Slavophile or Westernizer&quot; dilemma and started to develop a deeper understanding of the Russian people and Russia as a whole.

1857 saw the release of &quot;A Profitable Position&quot; (Доходное место), rated exceptionally high by Leo Tolstoy. &quot;This is a colossal thing in terms of depth, power and relevance and this impeccably real character, Yusov,&quot; the latter wrote in a letter. The play had nothing to do with the radical ideas propagated by &quot;Sovremennik&quot;, but by this time, according to Lakshin, Ostrovsky had developed a different approach to his art: &quot;Would it be worthwhile to wage wars against bribe-takers when they are only part of the way of life where the corruption serves for a hidden mechanism? Wouldn&#x27;t it be more intriguing to try and get under the skin of these people, learn how their special kind of morality works, expose the logic which helps them find excuses for themselves?&quot; Ostrovsky totally rejected didacticism. &quot;For a statement of truth to be effective and make people wiser, it has to be filtered through the soul of the highest quality, the soul of an artist,&quot; he argued.

&quot;A Profitable Position&quot;″s premiere, scheduled for 20 December 1857, was cancelled at the eleventh hour, as censors labelled it as &quot;an opus poking fun at state officials.&quot; On the brighter side, the police surveillance over Ostrovsky has been finally lifted, of which the local police chief informed the author personally, visiting him at his home. In September (seven months after it was banned for the second time) the &quot;Family Picture&quot; was at last declared eligible for being produced by Imperial Theatres. Also in 1857 &quot;Celebratory Sleep Is That Before Dinner&quot; (Праздничный сон – до обеда) came out, the first part of the Balzamininov trilogy (parts two and three, &quot;Two Dogs Fight, the Third Keep Away&quot; and &quot;Whatever You Look for, You&#x27;ll Find&quot; followed in 1861).

====1858–1867====

In 1858 &quot;Not of the Same Ilk&quot; (Не сошлись характерами), originally a novelette, came out. Subtitled &quot;The Picture of the Moscow Life&quot; and telling the story of an impoverished nobleman who marries a rich merchant woman only to be horrified by her stinginess, it was not of Ostrovsky&#x27;s best. By far more significant was his next one, &quot;A Protégée of the Mistress&quot; (Воспитанница, 1859), continuing the &#x27;degradation of the nobility&#x27; theme and written during his three weeks&#x27; visit to Saint Petersburg in 1858. It was banned from being staged on 23 October of the same year by Alexander Timashev after a censor in his report posed a question: &quot;Should we indeed give way to a play showing such immorality in Russian landowners&#x27; daily life?&quot;

In 1859 Count Grigory Kushelev-Bezborodko published the first edition of &quot;The Works by A.N. Ostrovsky&quot; in two volumes. Censored by none other than Ivan Goncharov (who helped to get the &quot;Family Affair&quot; into the collection), it inspired Nikolai Dobrolyubov to write the first of his two famous essays, hailing Ostrovsky as &quot;a ray of light in the realm of darkness.&quot; In November 1859, the author visited Dobrolyubov to thank him personally for what he saw as the first ever proper analysis of his work. &quot;In retrospect one cannot fail to see the polemic nature of [Dobrolyubov&#x27;s] two articles. Ostrovsky wasn&#x27;t a satirist, not even a humorist. What he cared for was the objectivity in depicting life... and even among the ugliest things he managed to find beauty,&quot; critic P. Morozov wrote half a century later. Ostrovsky himself saw his duty as merely portraying a Russian man the way he saw him. &quot;To have the right to correct other people&#x27;s wrongs, one has to see clearly the good side of the people too,&quot; he argued.

In 1860 came out another play inspired by Ostrovsky&#x27;s Volga voyage, &quot;The Storm&quot;, a tragic story of unhappily married Katerina, dominated by the motif of impending hurricane which never comes, the latter interpreted by Dobrolyubov as a metaphor for the social change that the Russian society was now badly in need of. To help the play overcome the censorial barrier Ostrovsky made a trip to the capital and had hard time trying to put it to the censor Nordstrom that Kabanikha (Katerina&#x27;s vile mother-in-law) was not some caricature of the late Tsar Nikolai I. &quot;The Storm&quot; was premiered on 16 November 1859, as the actor Sergey Vasilyev&#x27;s benefit, to enormous public acclaim.

Ostrovsky was greatly upset by the moral climate in both major Imperial theatres (Alexandrinka in particular, corrupted as it was by its closeness to the Court) which seemed to bring out the worst in their actors. One of the few exceptions was Alexander Martynov whom Ostrovsky admired and respected. In the spring of 1860 Martynov, terminally ill with tuberculosis, ventured on a trip down to Odessa and Ostrovsky agreed to follow him as a companion. On the way home, in Kharkov, the actor died. &quot;With Martynov I lost all that I&#x27;ve ever had in Petersburg&#x27;s theatre,&quot; Ostrovsky wrote in a letter to Panayev.

In 1861 Ostrovsky finished &quot;Whatever You Look for, You&#x27;ll Find&quot; (За чем пойдёшь, то и найдёшь), the final part of the Balzaminov trilogy (praised among others by Dostoyevsky), and the historical drama in verse, &quot;Kozma Zakharyich Minin-Sukhoruk&quot;, which took him six years to write. In 1862 the Tsar showed his approval by presenting the author with a golden ring which rather upset Ostrovsky, who saw it as a scant reward for all the pains he had to go through with censors. A year later &quot;Minin&quot; was banned without an explanation. Rumour had it that the January Uprising in Poland was the reason, making the authorities fear that the play might &quot;agitate the public&quot;, either against or for the Poles.

In the spring of 1862 Ostrovsky visited Germany, Austria, Italy, France and England, and returned with the acute feeling of the contrast between the two different time planes that Russia and Europe were living on. In London Ostrovsky visited Alexander Hertzen, although this fact became known only years later through the memoirs of his companion and personal secretary Ivan Gorbunov. In August 1862 he returned to Russia full of new ideas and by the end of the year finished &quot;Sin and Sorrow Are Common to All&quot; (Грех да беда на кого не живёт). Published by the Dostoyevsky brothers-owned &quot;Vremya&quot; magazine, it was a drama of strong characters, based on a real-life story related to the author by one of his merchant friends. In Autumn 1863 Ostrovsky finished &quot;Difficult Days&quot; (Тяжёлые дни), a sequel to the &quot;Hangover&quot;, telling the story of backward Russian provinces where ignorance rules. It was followed by &quot;Jokers&quot; (Шутники, 1864) and &quot;The Deep&quot; (Пучина, 1865), the latter concluding the Zamoskvorechye cycle. One of Ostrovsky&#x27;s experimental pieces (more a novel than a play, fashioned after the recently translated &quot;Thirty Years&quot; by Victor Ducange), it suffered from heavy-handed censorial treatment and had little success on stage. In 1865, accompanied again by Ivan Gorbunov, Ostrovsky made another trip down the Volga River.

====Troubles with censorship====
By the mid-1860s Ostrovsky&#x27;s reputation as Russia&#x27;s leading dramatist has become indisputable. Two of his plays, &quot;The Storm&quot; and &quot;Sin and Sorrow&quot;, have earned him the prestigious Uvarov Prize. Yet, being a man of the theatre, he grew more and more frustrated with his plays being banned one after another. He said:

Tsar Alexander II was an avid theatre-goer, but favoured ballet and French vaudeville. &quot;Ostrovsky is a talented man, but his plays for me are unbearable. I come to the theatre to rest from my hard work expecting to be amused, but Ostrovsky&#x27;s plays leave me depressed and distraught,&quot; the Tsar complained, according to the actor Fyodor Burdin. After the much-mangled &quot;Minin&quot; has found its way back to the Imperial Theatres&#x27; stage, Ostrovsky followed on with more historical dramas: &quot;Voyevoda&quot; (1866), &quot;The False Dmitry and Vasily Shuisky&quot; (1866) and &quot;Tushino&quot; (1867). In 1867 Stepan Gedeonov (the official who once helped him with &quot;The Sled&quot;) became the director of Imperial Theatres and in just six weeks Ostrovsky wrote &quot;Vasilisa Melentyeva&quot;, using Gedeonov&#x27;s script. But the 3rd Department suspected some political subversion, Gedeonov failed to provide financial support and the project flopped.

Back in 1846–1847 Ostrovsky&#x27;s father purchased four estates, the largest of which was Schelykovo in the Kostroma Governorate, the 18th-century mansion built by captain Mikhail Kutuzov. After Nikolai Ostrovsky&#x27;s death, Alexander with brother Mikhail bought the estate in 1867 from their stepmother. &quot;At last I&#x27;ll be able... to break free from the soul-rending theatre slavery which devoured the best years of my life,&quot; he wrote in a letter. He built a creamery, set up a garden, and even though soon it became clear that this new way of life won&#x27;t make him any richer, it was here that Ostrovsky spent his happiest days, receiving guests and enjoying bouts of inspiration for new plays. He called Shchelykovo &quot;the Kostroma Switzerland&quot; and insisted that not even in Italy had he ever seen such beauty.

===1867–1874===

By 1867, Ostrovsky had fallen into depression, feeling worthless and lonely. &quot;Tushino&quot; (1867), rejected by all the major magazines, could be published only by the humble &quot;Vsemirny Trud&quot;. After Dmitry Karakozov&#x27;s assassination attempt, many of Ostrovsky&#x27;s friends in high places lost their posts. To make ends meet he turned to translations and writing librettos. Things changed when Nekrasov became the head of &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot;. Ostrovsky was warmly welcomed in and debuted there in November 1868 with &quot;Enough Stupidity in Every Wise Man&quot; (На всякого мудреца довольно простоты).

Taking cues from his &#x27;worst enemy&#x27; operetta which came from France to conquer Petersburg and drive Ostrovsky&#x27;s plays from theatre repertoires, he wrote &quot;Ivan-tsarevich&quot;, an ironic fairytale, its Russian folklore plot mixed with modern parody and farce. The lack of finance forced Ostrovsky to cancel the project, but the idea was soon revived in &quot;Enough Stupidity in Every Wise Man&quot;, a pamphlet written in contemporary language but set in Moscow of the old times. It was followed by &quot;The Ardent Heart&quot; (Горячее сердце, 1869), part detective fiction, part naive fairytale, part modern pamphlet aimed at the Moscow traders buying huge plots of land from aristocrats. The main character Khlynov bore strong resemblance to the Moscow millionaire trader M.A. Khludov, who became famous for his bizarre projects and pranks. The premier of &quot;The Ardent Heart&quot; in The Maly on 15 January 1869 (a benefit for Prov Sadovsky who played Kuroslepov), was triumphant.

Also in 1869 &quot;Mad Money&quot; (), also translated as &quot;Money to Burn&quot;) came out, reflecting the author&#x27;s interest in (and wariness of, too) the new emerging class of capitalist entrepreneurs, &#x27;practical people&#x27;, as they have become known in Russia. Ostrovsky himself was very impractical, even if he liked to pretend otherwise. &quot;Publishers are crooks and they drink my blood,&quot; he used to say. &quot;Nekrasov openly laughed at me and called me an altruist. He said no man of literature would sell their work as cheaply as I do,&quot; complained Ostrovsky in a letter. Nekrasov (who paid him 200 rubles per act which was considered a good price) tried to help Ostrovsky in the business of publishing. &quot;But it just happened so that in the end [Ostrovsky] was always losing money... and was constantly on the verge of bankruptcy,&quot; Lakshin wrote. Each of his new plays was sent simultaneously to Maly Theatre and &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot;. Occasionally the publication preceded the premiere: such was the case with &quot;The Forest&quot; (Лес, 1871), the story of actors travelling from Vologda to Kerch which satirised the backwardness of the Russian province of the time.

Now visiting Petersburg regularly, Ostrovsky was enjoying the parties Nekrasov staged in a fashion of &quot;Sovremennik&quot; happenings, but for all the thrills of meeting people like Gleb Uspensky and Nikolai Mikhailovsky, in the capital he felt uneasy. One of the plays that were successful in Moscow but failed in Petersburg, was &quot;The Ardent Heart&quot;, due to the poor quality of the production. In January 1872 Alexander II unexpectedly visited Alexandrinka to watch &quot;It&#x27;s Not All Shrovetide for the Cat&quot; (Не всё коту масленница, 1871) and showed no enthusiasm. Gedeonov&#x27;s efforts to make sure that Ostrovsky should be granted a personal pension, in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of his literary career, came to nothing. The jubilee premiere of the play &quot;The False Dmitry and Vasily Shuisky&quot; (first published in 1866) on the Mariinsky stage on 17 February 1872 failed to meet expectations. &quot;Costumes shocked everybody with their ruggedness, decorations looked as if they were brought from Berg&#x27;s puppet show and everything reeked of negligence towards Russian theatre and Russian talents&quot;, the &quot;Grazhdanin&quot; reviewer wrote. The ceremony held behind the stage was a low profile affair with only theatre actors and director Alexander Yablochkin present. Disappointed, Ostrovsky returned to Moscow where he had always been revered as a veteran dramatist and the head of the Russian Dramatists society. Here the celebration was lavish and prolonged. &quot;Ostrovsky for Moscow has become what the Pope means for Rome,&quot; Ivan Goncharov wrote.

1872 also saw the release of &quot;The 17th Century Comic&quot; (Комик семнадцатого столетия), written for the 200th anniversary of the Russian theatre. The play was soon forgotten, but decades later Marina Tsvetayeva praised it as &quot;exemplary in language&quot;. A year later one of Ostrovsky&#x27;s most unusual plays, &quot;The Snow Maiden&quot; (Снегурочка) came out, based on the myth of the Berendey kingdom with its noble tsar, a poet and an artist. Leo Tolstoy and Nekrasov both loathed the experiment (so it had to be published in &quot;Vestnik Evropy&quot;) and the Moscow premiere drew a lukewarm response. But the musical community was enthusiastic and it took just three weeks for Pyotr Tchaikovsky to write the music for the stage production. Later Rimsky-Korsakov created the opera of the same name, keeping most of the original text in the libretto.

===1874–1880===
In the early 1870s Ostrovsky&#x27;s plays became more experimental, had little success on stage and were more or less disliked by critics. &quot;The Impotence of Creative Thought&quot;, the title of Nikolai Shelgunov&#x27;s article in &quot;Delo&quot; magazine, reflected the general mood. While in the old days Ostrovsky was criticised for being too epic and paying little attention to form, &quot;Late Love&quot; (Поздняя любовь, 1873) and &quot;Wolves and Sheep&quot; (Волки и овцы, 1875), with their perfect inner mechanism of action and technical gloss, were seen as too &quot;French-like in structure.&quot; &quot;I am at a loss, being scolded from all sides for my work which I&#x27;ve been totally honest in,&quot; Ostrovsky complained to Nekrasov in an 8 March 1874 letter.

Most of Ostrovsky&#x27;s later plays were based on real life stories. &quot;All of my plots are borrowed, they had been made up by the life itself. A dramatist does not invent stories but writes of things that have happened, or could have happened,&quot; Ostrovsky told the dramatist Dmitry Averkiyev. &quot;Wolves and Sheep&quot; told the story of a real court case involving the denouncement of hegumenness Mitrofania (Baroness Praskovia Rosen in real life) who in October 1874 was sued for fraud. Ostrovsky saw the story of this woman (portrayed as Murzavetskaya in the play) as an unusual mix of extraordinary personal ambitions and religious hypocrisy of somebody he described as &#x27;the Russian Tartuffe in frock.&#x27; &quot;The Last Victim&quot; (Последняя жертва, 1877) told the true story of the actress Yulia Linskaya who left the stage to marry an affluent man, became a rich widow and, left penniless by her younger lover, died in poverty.

&quot;Without a Dowry&quot; (Бесприданница, 1878) was based on a criminal case dealing with a murder from jealousy, which was going on in the Kineshma court where Ostrovsky had once worked and which he since then often visited. It went unnoticed and only in retrospect is regarded as a precursor to Chekhov&#x27;s similar line of work. Written especially for the young Alexandrinka actress Maria Savina, it had more success in Petersburg than in Moscow. Revived by Vera Komissarzhevskaya after the author&#x27;s death, the play, according to Lakshin, &quot;remains a timeless reminder of how deep the chasm between the two sides of success, the artistic and the public one, can be.&quot;

In the autumn of 1877 Ostrovsky left his old house at Nicola-Vorobin and moved into a posh and comfortable flat in a house on Prechistenka street. Despite having fallen out of favour with critics, Ostrovsky, a great authority and a theatre patriarch, was continuously visited by young authors seeking his advice and assessment. He discovered several new dramatists, among them Nikolai Solovyov, a monk and a gifted playwright (recommended to him by Konstantin Leontiev) who became the co-author of &quot;Belugin&#x27;s Marriage&quot; (Женитьба Белугина, a re-working of Solovyov&#x27;s &quot;Who Could Expect?&quot;) and two more plays. Ostrovsky spent now most of his time in his room writing, feeling under increasing pressure due to growing financial demands of his family. &quot;Two or three months of freedom from working and thinking would help me a lot, but this is unthinkable and, as Eternal Jew I am doomed to walk on and on and on,&quot; he wrote in 1879. People who visited him in Moscow in his last years were horrified at how jaded he looked.

====Ostrovsky and Russian theatre reform====
In 1874 Ostrovsky co-founded The Society of Russian Dramatic Art and Opera Composers which dealt mostly with legal issues and provided financial support for the authors writing for theatre. The Society published plays, organised performances and exerted a strong influence upon the development of the Russian theatre. Prior to this, in 1865, Ostrovsky initiated the formation of the Artists&#x27; Circle, a club and an informal drama school. Appalled by the deep crisis the Russian theatre found itself in the 1870s, Ostrovsky worked out a profound plan for its radical reform. In 1881 he came to Petersburg with two reports: &quot;On the Situation in the Modern Drama Art in Russia&quot; and &quot;On the Needs of the Imperial Theatre&quot;, and Minister I.I. Vorontsov-Dashkov invited Ostrovsky to join the special governmental committee. Most of his suggestions have been ignored, but at least one idea, that of founding in Moscow the first independent theatre appealed to the Tsar and (even if the Moscow project flopped) soon private theatres started to open all over Russia.

In December 1885, Ostrovsky was appointed the Imperial Theatres&#x27; repertoire director. For several months he was busy inspecting productions, having talks, trying to implement the reforms he had been thinking over for years. Driven by the idea of &quot;making the theatre the home of a thinking man&quot; Ostrovsky invited the university professors Nikolai Storozhenko and Nikolai Tikhonravov as well as the dramatist Nikolai Chayev to work on the repertoires. He was helping new authors, firing inadequate officials and trying to fight the all-pervading corruption. According to the biographer Anna Zhuravlyova, Ostrovsky in his later years had every reason to write, as he did: &quot;Other arts have schools, academies, mentors in high places... Russian drama has only myself. I am its everything: the academy, the sponsor and the protector.&quot;

===Last years===

In the autumn of 1883 Ostrovsky made a trip down to the Caucasus. The lavish reception he received in Georgia moved him to tears. Refreshed and full of new hopes, Ostrovsky came back and promptly finished &quot;Guilty Without Fault&quot; (Без вины виноватые). Back home, though, he found himself in financial trouble again. &quot;I am on the brink, there is no way out: Maria Vasilyevna is ill, all those worries have broken me totally, my heart falters and I often faint. None of the theatres pays me and I am in debt,&quot; he wrote to Fyodor Burdin.

In the early 1884 Ostrovsky was finally granted a personal pension from the Court, something he had requested 15 years earlier and had been refused. Mikhail Ostrovsky, now one of Alexander&#x27;s ministers and a member of the State Council of Imperial Russia, mentioned his brother&#x27;s financial difficulties to the Tsar and the problem was solved in a minute. Ostrovsky&#x27;s feelings were mixed, though: 3 thousand rubles a year was not a large sum and there was a tinge of humiliation too in the way it had been obtained. Still on 5 March 1884, Ostrovsky came to the Palace to see Alexander III and had a 15-minute talk with the monarch. The Tsar asked why had the author chosen such a hero for &quot;The Handsome Man&quot; (Красавец-мужчина), a play about a pimp. &quot;Such is the spirit of our times,&quot; Ostrovsky answered simply.

On 28 May 1886, Ostrovsky departed to Schelykovo, feeling already very ill. While staying at an inn he suffered a severe asthma attack. His condition started to quickly deteriorate; he spent his last days in great pain, unable to move. On 2 June Ostrovsky died in his home of angina pectoris while at his desk translating William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;.

Alexander Ostrovsky was buried in the local cemetery in Nikolo-Berezhki. Only close relatives, a couple of old friends, dramatist Nikolai Kropachev and A.A. Maykov (his colleague in the Theatre department and Apollon Maykov&#x27;s nephew) were present. The ceremony was modest and humble. Brother Mikhail&#x27;s plans to move the coffin to the Moscow Novodevichye Cemetery remained unfulfilled. &quot;Ostrovsky&#x27;s life was hard, full of strife, inner suffering and hard work. But he lived it as he wrote about it, being loyal to simple ideals: native land, pure feelings, goodness in people and the source of both happiness and torment in his life, theatre,&quot; Lakshin wrote.

==Private life==
In 1847 Ostrovsky met Agafya Ivanovna, a lower middle-class 24-year-old woman who lived in the Yauza neighborhood, and became close to her. Nothing is known of her, except that her sister&#x27;s name was Natalya Ivanovna Belenkova (but that second name might have belonged to her husband). According to Lakshin, there was strong possibility that her parents were ex-serfs; in that case her surname most certainly would have been Ivanova.

Despite his father&#x27;s strong objection, in mid-1849 Ostrovsky, while the family was away, took Agafya into the house as his civil partner. Marriage was out of question and Gasha (as she was known) never demanded that. Ostrovsky apparently wasn&#x27;t expecting this relationship to be a lasting one, but it proved otherwise and Gasha stayed with him until her death in 1867. Poorly educated, but talented and intelligent woman, she had deep knowledge of the lower classes&#x27; life and certainly exerted some influence upon the dramatist.

In the Autumn of 1859, while working upon &quot;The Storm&quot; Ostrovsky spent some time in Davydkovo and Ivankovo nearby Moscow, the two places of actors&#x27; gatherings. It was there that he became romantically involved with the actress Lyubov Nikulina-Kositskaya, whom he apparently had in mind as Katerina. Judging by the extant Kositskaya&#x27;s letters, Ostrovsky was madly in love, promising to &#x27;elevate&#x27; her &#x27;upon a pedestal&#x27;; she expressed reservations, reminding her lover of his duties towards his civil partner. After two years of uncertainty Ostrovsky proposed, and Kositskaya rejected him. By this time she has been in love with her young follower Sokolov, a flamboyant merchant&#x27;s son who first squandered his own money, then started spending hers. This whole affair proved to be a painful and humiliating experience to Ostrovsky.

In the early 1860s Ostrovsky met Maria Vasilyevna Vasilyeva, the Maly Theater actress whom he became close with in 1864. On New Year&#x27;s Eve she gave birth to a child, Alexander. In August 1866 Mikhail was born; in the end of 1867, a daughter, Maria. On 12 February 1869, Ostrovsky and Vasilyeva married.

== Musical adaptations ==
Several of Ostrovsky&#x27;s plays have been turned into operas. The play &quot;The Storm&quot; (Groza) was the inspiration behind Leoš Janáček&#x27;s opera &quot;Káťa Kabanová&quot;. The most notable Russian opera based on an Ostrovsky play is Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;The Snow Maiden&quot; (&quot;Snegurochka&quot;). Tchaikovsky also wrote incidental music for this play. Ostrovsky is known outside of Russian-speaking countries mostly because of these two works.

His 1854 comedy &quot;Don&#x27;t Live as You Like&quot; was adapted as the tragic opera &quot;The Power of the Fiend&quot; (premiered in 1871) by Alexander Serov. The historical drama &quot;The Voyevoda (Dream on the Volga)&quot; was transformed into two operas: one by Pyotr Tchaikovsky (as &quot;The Voyevoda&quot;) and later another by Anton Arensky entitled &quot;Dream on the Volga&quot;. Tchaikovsky also later wrote incidental music for a scene in the play.

==Legacy==
Alexander Ostrovsky is considered one of the most important Russian playwrights of the 19th century, credited with bringing dramatic realism to the Russian theatre stage. His best-known plays, in which he meticulously portrayed the Russian society of his time, focusing on the morals and manners of the newly emerging merchant class, were extremely popular during his lifetime and remain an integral part of the Russian repertoire. They are esteemed for their skillful characterization and use of dialect.

Ostrovsky wrote 47 original plays featuring 728 characters, &quot;a real word of its own where some figures might seem similar, but no two of them are the same,&quot; according to Y. Kholodov. &quot;Ostrovsky&#x27;s world was exceptionally diverse, as was his set of formats: he&#x27;s written dramas, historical chronicles, scenes of Moscow life, a spring fairytale and a dramatic etude... His legacy could be seen as one endless play set on one stage, that of Russia of the last three centuries,&quot; the critic continued. His work divided the critics, and while Apollon Grigoriev enthused about their originality and Nikolai Dobrolyubov praised their social straightforwardness, some (like Nikolai Chernyshevsky) criticised the author of being maudlin and sentimental as regards patriarchal habits and ways. Politically neutral critics and the theatre community especially, though, loved his work and the best Russian stage stars, like Sadovsky, S. Vasilyev, Stepanov, Kositskaya and Borozdina were totally on his side.

Some scholars expressed doubts as to the existence of the actual piece of paper on which Nikolai Gogol has allegedly scribbled the words of encouragement to the young dramatist, but in retrospect most of them agreed that regardless of that Ostrovsky came as a direct heir to Gogol&#x27;s tradition of realism, humanism and closeness to folk culture and language. Ostrovsky was foreign to pastel colours and undertones, subtlety was not his thing. Critics used to compare his scenes to paintings by Pavel Fedotov. His was juiciness of natural brightness, dramatism, strong emotions, bright humour and unforgettable, lavishly painted characters. Ostrovsky was regarded as a master of language. Back in 1859 Nikolai Dobrolyubov (in his &quot;Realm of Darkness&quot; essay) remarked that many phrases he coined were being eagerly adopted by people and became folk sayings, part of common people talk. &quot;Nobody has had such glorious, tasteful and clear Russian language before Ostrovsky,&quot; Turgenev wrote.

A master of the realistic drama, Ostrovsky was praised for his insight into the psychology of the Russian people, and many of his well-drawn characters are favorites among Russian actors and audiences. While international recognition of his talent has been limited by the difficulties of translating his heavily idiomatic dialogue, his contributions remain central to the development of modern Russian drama.

Ostrovsky never kept diaries, discussed only practical affairs in his letters and never meant them to be preserved. In 1879 he said in a &quot;Russkaya Starina&quot; interview: &quot;I&#x27;ve been for quite a while cherishing a dream of how after all I&#x27;ll start a book of memoirs and relax a bit, enjoying myself, but now I know for sure this will remain nothing more than a dream. To put my reminiscences in order I need some rest and peace – two things I haven&#x27;t got and never will have.&quot; Most of Ostrovsky&#x27;s letters disappeared. In Shchelykovo the huge bulk of documents has been destroyed through negligence. The first academic works dealing with Ostrovsky and his legacy started to appear only in the Soviet era, via scholars N. Kashin, N. Dolgov, A. Revyakin, A. Lotman, E. Kholodov and V. Lakshin. Many gaps remain, unconfirmed dates and uncorroborated facts in his biography, according to the latter.

Unlike those of his contemporaries Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and Turgenev, Ostrovsky&#x27;s works are little known outside of Russian-speaking countries. The two that are fairly well known in the West became so mostly because they were adapted for operas: &quot;Katya Kabanova&quot; (based on &quot;The Storm&quot;), and &quot;The Snow Maiden&quot; by Rimsky-Korsakov. Ostrovsky wrote mostly of the conservative &quot;old Russia&quot;, the traditional Russian society—of the everyday life of merchants and poor city dwellers—the subjects that seemed to attract little interest in the West.

The Ostrovsky Institute was founded in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, in 1945, which grew into the Uzbekistan State Institute of Arts and Culture.

The Ostrovsky Leningrad Theatre Institute was founded in Leningrad, and merged with the Leningrad Institute of Art History in 1961 to become the Leningrad Institute of Theatre, Music and Cinematography, now the St Petersburg Institute of Theatre, Music and Cinematography.
