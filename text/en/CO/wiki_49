<text>Wat Pho (, ), also spelled Wat Po, is a Buddhist temple complex in the Phra Nakhon District, Bangkok, Thailand. It is on Rattanakosin Island, directly south of the Grand Palace. Known also as the Temple of the Reclining Buddha, its official name is Wat Phra Chetuphon Wimon Mangkhalaram Rajwaramahawihan (; ). The more commonly known name, Wat Pho, is a contraction of its older name, &quot;Wat Photaram&quot; (; ).

The temple is first on the list of six temples in Thailand classed as the highest grade of the first-class royal temples. It is associated with King Rama I who rebuilt the temple complex on an earlier temple site. It became his main temple and is where some of his ashes are enshrined. The temple was later expanded and extensively renovated by Rama III. The temple complex houses the largest collection of Buddha images in Thailand, including a 46 m long huge reclining Buddha. The temple is considered the earliest centre for public education in Thailand, and the illustrations and inscriptions placed in the temple for public instructions has been recognised by UNESCO in its Memory of the World Programme. It houses a school of Thai medicine, and is also known as the birthplace of traditional Thai massage which is still taught and practiced at the temple.

== History ==
Wat Pho is one of Bangkok&#x27;s oldest temples. It existed before Bangkok was established as the capital by King Rama I. It was originally named Wat Photaram or Podharam, from which the name Wat Pho is derived. The name refers to the monastery of the Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya, India where Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment. The date of the construction of the old temple and its founder are not known; it was built sometime in the Ayutthaya period, but said to have been built or expanded during the reign of King Phetracha (1688–1703). The southern section of Wat Pho used to be occupied by part of a French Star fort that was demolished by King Phetracha after the 1688 Siege of Bangkok.

After the fall of Ayutthaya in 1767 to the Burmese, King Taksin moved the capital to Thonburi where he located his palace beside Wat Arun on the opposite side of the Chao Phraya River from Wat Pho. The proximity of Wat Pho to this royal palace elevated it to the status of a &quot;wat luang&quot; (&#x27;royal monastery&#x27;), to be administered by the royal monastic committee up to the present day.

In 1782, King Rama I moved the capital from Thonburi across the river to Bangkok and built the Grand Palace adjacent to Wat Pho. In 1788, he ordered the construction and renovation at the old temple site of Wat Pho, which had by then become dilapidated. The site, which was marshy and uneven, was drained and filled in before construction began. During its construction, Rama I also initiated a project to remove Buddha images from abandoned temples in Ayutthaya, Sukhothai, and various other sites in Thailand, and many of these retrieved Buddha images were then kept at Wat Pho. These include the remnants of an enormous Buddha image from Ayuthaya&#x27;s Wat Phra Si Sanphet destroyed by the Burmese in 1767, and these were incorporated into a &quot;chedi&quot; in the complex. The rebuilding took over seven years to complete. In 1801, twelve years after work began, the new temple complex was renamed &quot;Wat Phra Chetuphon Vimolmangklavas&quot; in reference to the vihara of Jetavana, and it became the main temple for Rama I.
The complex underwent significant changes over the next two centuries, particularly during the reign of Rama III (1824-1851). In 1832, King Rama III began renovating and enlarging the temple complex, a process that took 16 years and seven months to complete. The ground of the temple complex was expanded to , and most of the structures now present in Wat Pho were either built or rebuilt during this period, including the Chapel of the Reclining Buddha. He also turned the temple complex into a public center of learning by decorating the walls of the buildings with diagrams and inscriptions on various subjects. The inscriptions were written by about 50 people from the court of Rama III and learned monks led by Supreme Patriarch Prince Paramanuchitchinorot (1790-1853), the abbot of Wat Pho, a Buddhist scholar, historian and poet. On 21 February 2008, these marble illustrations and inscriptions was registered in the Memory of the World Programme launched by UNESCO to promote, preserve and propagate the wisdom of the world heritage. Wat Pho is regarded as Thailand&#x27;s first university and a center for traditional Thai massage. It served as a medical teaching center in the mid-19th century before the advent of modern medicine, and the temple remains a center for traditional medicine today where a private school for Thai medicine founded in 1957 still operates.

The name of the complex was changed again to Wat Phra Chetuphon Vimolmangklararm during the reign of King Rama IV. Apart from the construction of a fourth great chedi and minor modifications by Rama IV, there had been no significant changes to Wat Pho since. Repair work, however, is a continuing process, often funded by devotees of the temple. The temple was restored again in 1982 before the Bangkok Bicentennial Celebration.

== The temple complex ==
Wat Pho is one of the largest and oldest wats in Bangkok covering an area of 50 &quot;rai&quot; or 80,000 square metres. It is home to more than one thousand Buddha images, as well as one of the largest single Buddha images at in length. The Wat Pho complex consists of two walled compounds bisected by Chetuphon Road running in the east–west direction. The larger northern walled compound, the &quot;phutthawat&quot;, is open to visitors and contains the finest buildings dedicated to the Buddha, including the &quot;bot&quot; with its four directional &quot;viharn&quot;, and the temple housing the reclining Buddha. The southern compound, the &quot;sankhawat&quot;, contains the residential quarters of the monks and a school. The perimeter wall of the main temple complex has sixteen gates, two of which serve as entrances for the public (one on Chetuphon Road, the other near the northwest corner).

The temple grounds contain four great &quot;chedis&quot;, 91 small &quot;chedis&quot;, two belfries, a &quot;bot&quot; (central shrine), a number of &quot;viharas&quot; (halls) and various buildings such as pavilions, as well as gardens and a small temple museum. Architecturally the &quot;chedis&quot; and buildings in the complex are different in style and sizes. A number of large Chinese statues, some of which depict Europeans, are also found in the complex guarding the gates of the perimeter walls as well as other gates in the compound. These stone statues were originally imported as ballast on ships trading with China.

Wat Pho was also intended to serve as a place of education for the general public. To this end a pictorial encyclopedia was engraved on granite slabs covering eight subject areas: history, medicine, health, custom, literature, proverbs, lexicography, and the Buddhist religion. These plaques, inscribed with texts and illustrations on medicine, figures with pressure points for Thai traditional massage, and other subjects, are placed around the temple, for example, within the Sala Rai or satellite open pavilions. Dotted around the complex are 24 small rock gardens (&quot;khao mor&quot;) illustrating rock formations of Thailand, and one, called the Contorting Hermit Hill, contains some statues showing methods of massage and yoga positions. There are also drawings of constellations on the wall of the library, inscriptions on local administration, as well as paintings of folk tales and animal husbandry.

===Phra Ubosot===

Phra Ubosot (Phra Uposatha) or &quot;bot&quot; is the ordination hall, the main hall used for performing Buddhist rituals, and the most sacred building of the complex. It was constructed by King Rama I in the Ayuthaya-style, and later enlarged and reconstructed in the Rattanakosin-style by Rama III. The &quot;bot&quot; was dedicated in 1791, before the rebuilding of Wat Pho was completed. This building is raised on a marble platform, its teak doors are inset with mother-of-pearl illustrating stories from the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. The &quot;ubosot&quot; lies in the center of courtyard enclosed by a double cloister (Phra Rabiang).Inside the &quot;ubosot&quot; is a gold and crystal three-tiered pedestal topped with a gilded Buddha made of a gold-copper alloy, and over the statue is a nine-tiered umbrella representing the authority of Thailand. The Buddha image, known as Phra Buddha Theva Patimakorn and thought to be from the Ayutthaya period, was moved here by Rama I from &quot;Wat Sala Si Na&quot; (now called &quot;Wat Khuhasawan&quot;) in Thonburi. Rama IV later placed some ashes of Rama I under the pedestal of the Buddha image so that the public may pay homage to both Rama I and the Buddha at the same time. There are also ten images of Buddha&#x27;s disciples in the hall: Moggalana is to the left of Buddha and Sariputta to the right, with eight Arahants below.

The exterior balustrade surrounding the main hall has around 150 depictions in stone of the epic, &quot;Ramakien&quot;, the ultimate message of which is transcendence from secular to spiritual dimensions. The stone panels were recovered from a temple in Ayuthaya. The &quot;ubosot&quot; is enclosed by a low wall called &quot;kamphaeng kaew&quot;, which is punctuated by gateways guarded by mythological lions, as well as eight structures that house &quot;bai sema&quot;, stone markers that delineate the sacred space of the &quot;bot&quot;.

*Phra Rabiang - This double cloister contains around 400 images of Buddha from northern Thailand selected out of the 1,200 originally brought by King Rama I. Of these Buddha images, 150 are on the inner side of the double cloister, another 244 images are on the outer side. These Buddha figures, some standing and some seated, are evenly mounted on matching gilded pedestals. These images are from different periods in Siamese history, such as the Chiangsaen, Sukhothai, U-Thong, and Ayutthaya eras, but they were renovated by Rama I and covered with stucco and gold leaves to make them look similar. 


The Phra Rabiang is intersected by four viharns. The viharn in the east contains an eight metre tall standing Buddha, the Buddha Lokanatha (&quot;Saviour of the World&quot;), originally from Ayutthaya. In its antechamber is Buddha Maravichai (referencing victory over Mara), sitting under a bodhi tree, originally from Sawankhalok of the late-Sukhothai period. The one on the west has a seated Buddha sheltered by a naga, the Buddha Chinnasri (&quot;the victorious lion Buddha&quot;), while the Buddha on the south, the Buddha Chinnaraja (named after Phra Phuttha Chinnarat of Phitsanulok), has five disciples seated in front listening to his first sermon. Both Buddhas in the south and west viharns were brought from Sukhothai by Rama I. The Buddha in the north viharn, called Buddha Palilai (a reference to the elephant Palilaika), was cast in the reign of Rama I. The viharn on the west contains a small museum.

*Phra Prang - There are four towers, or &quot;phra&quot; &quot;prang&quot;, at each corner of the courtyard around the &quot;bot&quot;. Each of the towers is tiled with marble and contains four Khmer-style statues which are the guardian divinities of the Four Cardinal Points.

===Phra Maha Chedi Si Rajakarn===

This is a group of four large stupas, each 42 metres high. These four &quot;chedis&quot; are dedicated to the first four Chakri kings. The first, in green mosaic tiles, was constructed by Rama I to house the remnants of a great bronze standing Buddha from Ayutthaya called Phra Phuttha Sanphet. The Burmese were said to have scorched the Buddha image to remove near 2 tons of its gold covering, later the image fragmented when the &quot;vihan&quot; it was in collapsed upon it, and Rama I who brought it Wat Pho decided to encase the image in the chedi. 

Two more chedis were built by Rama III, one in white tiles to hold the ashes of his father Rama II, another in yellow for himself. A fourth in blue was built by Rama IV who then enclosed the four &quot;chedis&quot; leaving no space for more to be built.

===Viharn Phranorn===

The &quot;viharn&quot; or &quot;wihan&quot; contains the reclining Buddha and was constructed in the reign of Rama III emulating the Ayutthaya style. The interior is decorated with panels of mural.

Adjacent to this building is a small raised garden (Missakawan Park) with a Chinese-style pavilion; the centre piece of the garden is a bodhi tree which was propagated from the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi tree in Sri Lanka that is believed to have originally came from a tree in India where Buddha sat while awaiting enlightenment.

===Phra Mondop===

Phra Mondop or the &quot;ho trai&quot; is the Scripture Hall containing a small library of Buddhist scriptures. The building is not generally open to the public as the scriptures, which are inscribed on palm leaves, need to be kept in a controlled environment for preservation. The library was built by King Rama III. Guarding its entrance are figures called &quot;Yak Wat Pho&quot; (&#x27;Wat Pho&#x27;s Giants&#x27;) placed in niches beside the gates. Around Phra Mondop are three pavilions with mural paintings of the beginning of Ramayana.

===Other structures===

*Phra Chedi Rai - Outside the Phra Rabiang cloisters are dotted many smaller &quot;chedis&quot;, called &quot;Phra Chedi Rai&quot;. Seventy-one of these small &quot;chedis&quot; were built by Rama III, each five metres in height. There are also four groups of five chedis that shared a single base built by Rama I, one on each corner outside the cloister. The 71 &quot;chedis&quot; of smaller size contain the ashes of the royal family, and 20 slightly larger ones clustered in groups of five contain the relics of Buddha.

*Sala Karn Parien - Sala Karn Parien is the preaching hall, a simple pavilion used for religious instruction for monks and laymen, and also serves as a meditation hall. This hall is next to the Phra Mondop at the southwest corner of the compound, and is thought to date from the Ayutthaya period. The building contains the original Buddha image from the &quot;bot&quot;, which was moved here to make way for the Buddha image currently in the &quot;bot&quot;. The Buddha image, called Phra Phuttha Satsada, is in the late Ayutthaya style. Next to it is a garden called The Crocodile Pond.
*Sala Rai - There are 16 satellite pavilions, most of them placed around the edge of the compound, and murals depicting the life of Buddha may be found in some of these. Two of these are the medical pavilions between Phra Maha Chedi Si Ratchakarn and the main chapel. The north medicine pavilion contains Thai traditional massage inscriptions with 32 drawings of massage positions on the walls while the one to the south has a collection of inscriptions on guardian angel that protects the newborn.
*Phra Viharn Kod - This is the gallery which consists of four viharas, one on each corner outside the Phra Rabiang.
*Tamnak Wasukri - Also called the poet&#x27;s house, this is the former residence of Prince Patriarch Paramanuchitchinorot, a scholar, historian and poet. The house was a gift from his nephew Rama III. This building is in the living quarters of the monks in the southern compound and is open once a year on his birthday.

==Reclining Buddha==

The wat and the reclining Buddha (&quot;Phra Buddhasaiyas&quot;, ) were built by Rama III in 1832. The image of the reclining Buddha represents the entry of Buddha into Nirvana and the end of all reincarnations. The posture of the image is referred to as &quot;sihasaiyas&quot;, the posture of a sleeping or reclining lion. The figure is 15 m high and 46 m long, and it is one of the largest Buddha statues in Thailand.

The figure has a brick core, which was modelled and shaped with plaster, then gilded. The right arm of the Buddha supports the head with tight curls, which rests on two box-pillows encrusted with glass mosaics.
The soles of the feet of the Buddha are 3 m high and 4.5 m long, and inlaid with mother-of-pearl. They are each divided into 108 arranged panels, displaying the auspicious symbols by which Buddha can be identified, such as flowers, dancers, white elephants, tigers, and altar accessories. At the center of each foot is a circle representing a &quot;chakra&quot; or &#x27;energy point&#x27;. There are 108 bronze bowls in the corridor representing the 108 auspicious characters of Buddha. Visitors may drop coins in these bowls as it is believed to bring good fortune, and it also helps the monks to maintain the &quot;wat&quot;.

Although the reclining Buddha is not a pilgrimage destination, it remains an object of popular piety. An annual celebration for the reclining Buddha is held around the time of the Siamese Songkran or New Year in April, which also helps raise funds for the upkeep of Wat Pho.

==Thai massage==
The temple is considered the first public university of Thailand, teaching students in the fields of religion, science, and literature through murals and sculptures. A school for traditional medicine and massage was established at the temple in 1955, and now offers four courses in Thai medicine: Thai pharmacy, Thai medical practice, Thai midwifery, and Thai massage. This, the Wat Pho Thai Traditional Medical and Massage School, is the first school of Thai medicine approved by the Thai Ministry of Education, and one of the earliest massage schools. It remains the national headquarters and the center of education of traditional Thai medicine and massage to this day. Courses on Thai massage are held in Wat Pho, and these may last a few weeks to a year. Two pavilions at the eastern edge of the Wat Pho compound are used as classrooms for practising Thai traditional massage and herbal massage, and visitors can receive massage treatment here for a fee. The Thai massage or Nuad Thai taught at Wat Pho has been included in UNESCO&#x27;s list of Intangible Cultural Heritage, and Wat Pho has trained more than 200,000 massage therapists who practice in 145 countries.

There are many medical inscriptions and illustrations placed in various buildings around the temple complex, some of which serve as instructions for Thai massage therapists, particularly those in the north medical pavilion. They were inscribed by scholars during the reign of King Rama III. Among these are 60 inscribed plaques, 30 each for the front and back of human body, showing pressure points used in traditional Thai massage. These therapeutic points and energy pathways, known as &quot;sen&quot;, with explanations given on the walls next to the plaques.

<text>Curtains is the seventh solo album by American musician John Frusciante, released on February 1, 2005 on Record Collection. The album is primarily an acoustic album, in contrast to his previous album, &quot;A Sphere in the Heart of Silence&quot;, a mostly electronic collaboration with Josh Klinghoffer. According to Frusciante, the album was recorded in his living room: &quot;It was just me sitting on a pillow, on my living room floor, with my back leaning against the couch.&quot;

The album features contributions from Autolux drummer Carla Azar, upright bassist Ken Wild, and The Mars Volta guitarist Omar Rodríguez-López, with Frusciante noting, &quot;Carla from the band Autolux plays drums. I loved having a feminine energy. My friend Omar Rodriguez-Lopez of the Mars Volta played some guitar. He and I do these solos together where we&#x27;re using the same amp at the same time.&quot;

A video was released for &quot;The Past Recedes&quot;.

The vinyl edition of the record saw a repressing from Record Collection on December 11, 2012. These reissued records are 180 gram and come with a download of choice between MP3 and WAV formats of the album.

The album cover is reproduced from 17th-century painting &quot;Aeneas and the Sibyl in the Underworld&quot; by the Flemish painter Jan Brueghel the Younger.

<text>F/X (also known as or subtitled Murder by Illusion) is a 1986 American action thriller film directed by Robert Mandel, written by Gregory Fleeman and Robert T. Megginson, and starring Bryan Brown, Brian Dennehy, Diane Venora, Cliff De Young, and Angela Bassett in her film debut. The film follows a special effects expert who is hired by the U.S. Department of Justice to stage the murder of a mobster about to enter the Witness Protection Program, but complications arise when he is targeted for murder himself; meanwhile, an NYPD detective becomes suspicious of the circumstances of the case.

The film was released to positive reviews from critics and was a box office success, earning $20.6 million on a $10 million budget. A sequel, &quot;F/X2: The Deadly Art of Illusion&quot;, was released in 1991. A spinoff television series, &quot;F/X: The Series&quot;, was produced from 1996 to 1998.

==Plot==
Movie special effects expert Roland &quot;Rollie&quot; Tyler is hired by the Department of Justice to stage the murder of Mafia informant Nicholas DeFranco. DeFranco is set to testify against his former Mafia bosses and go into witness protection, but the DoJ is afraid he will be killed before the trial. Rollie rigs a gun with blanks and gives DeFranco a rig with radio transmitters and fake blood packs to simulate bullet hits. The DoJ supervisor on the case, Edward Mason, asks Rollie to be the &quot;assassin&quot; wearing a disguise. He is paid $30,000 and assured by Mason that he is &quot;100% protected&quot;.

During the preparation, Lipton, the DoJ agent in charge, handles Rollie&#x27;s gun. DeFranco wears Rollie&#x27;s rig to an Italian restaurant and the public &quot;assassination&quot; goes flawlessly. Rollie is picked up by Lipton, but he tries to shoot Rollie. In the struggle for Lipton&#x27;s gun, the driver is killed and the car crashes, allowing Rollie to escape. He contacts Mason, who is shocked by Lipton&#x27;s actions and instructs him to wait for other agents to take him to a safe location; however, another man thought to be Rollie is killed by the agents, proving that Mason is trying to kill him too. Rollie retreats to his girlfriend Ellen&#x27;s apartment, but she is killed the next morning by a sniper, whom Rollie kills in a fight.

NYPD homicide detective Leo McCarthy investigates the deaths of Ellen and the sniper and realizes it is connected to DeFranco, whom he has been pursuing for years. He discovers that the assassination was faked and that Mason planned it. When he is suspended by his captain for his reckless methods, McCarthy manages to steal his captain&#x27;s badge and gun.

Using an elaborate phone setup, Rollie lures Lipton out in the open and kidnaps him in his official car, taking him on a rough ride in the trunk to get Mason&#x27;s address out of him. After that scene, Lipton disappears from the plot, and his subsequent fate is not clear. After stealing his van from an impound with the help of his assistant and evading police, Rollie goes to Mason&#x27;s mansion where, using his special effects expertise, he defeats Mason&#x27;s guards; McCarthy follows and alerts the New York State Police.

Mason and DeFranco realize Rollie has found them. DeFranco shoots out several windows in Mason&#x27;s study and Rollie falls through one of the windows, appearing to be dead. Mason and DeFranco try to leave the house when a helicopter arrives, but DeFranco is shocked by a rigged metal screen door, disrupting his pacemaker. Before he dies of heart failure, Mason takes from him a key to a Swiss safe deposit box containing the funds DeFranco stole from the Mafia.

Mason prepares to escape, but is surprised by Rollie, who holds him at gunpoint with an Uzi. Mason tries to bribe Rollie by giving him the key, proposing that they split the money, but Rollie refuses and puts his gun down. Mason picks up the gun and demands the key back, but Rollie reveals the gun is empty and has Krazy Glue on its grip, before shoving Mason out of the mansion toward the police, who misinterpret his actions as a threat and fatally shoot him.

Rollie fakes his death and is taken to the morgue, where he is confronted by McCarthy. The film ends with Rollie impersonating DeFranco at the bank in Geneva and retrieving the $15 million in Mafia funds, which he shares with McCarthy.

==Production==
The unsolicited screenplay was written by two novice writers, actor Gregory Fleeman and documentarian Robert T. Megginson. Producer Jack Wiener read their script, which was submitted as a low-budget television movie, and felt that it should be made into a theatrical release. Wiener and his co-producer Dodi Fayed hired Robert Mandel, an Off-Broadway director. They did not want to hire an action director, but instead wanted a director who would bring a realistic touch to the film and make the audience care about the main character having been impressed with Mandel&#x27;s direction of actors in &quot;Independence Day&quot;. Mandel accepted the job because he wanted to dispel the perception that he was a &quot;soft, arty director&quot;. Initially he was not impressed with the film&#x27;s screenplay, which he felt was not well-crafted but felt that it provided for &quot;a lot of action and a lot of things I did not have under my belt&quot;. In preparation for the film&#x27;s action sequences, Mandel studied chase scenes from &quot;Bullitt&quot; and &quot;The French Connection&quot;. To pull off the film&#x27;s special effects, the producers hired John Stears, who had worked on the first eight James Bond films and shared a special effects Academy Award for &quot;Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope&quot;.

Principal photography began in the spring of 1985 in New York City, with additional filming taking place in nearby Orange, New Jersey and Rye, New York. Production was completed on July 6, 1985, in Geneva, Switzerland.

A preview screening in the San Fernando Valley produced some of the best statistics Orion Pictures had seen in some time. A week before its release, a film industry screening was very successful, as was its premiere at the United States Film Festival (later known as the Sundance Film Festival).

==Release==
While &quot;F/X&quot; performed well at the box office, grossing over $20 million in North America (well over its $10 million budget), executives at Orion Pictures, which financed and distributed the film, felt that it could have performed even better with a different title. One executive claimed that no one understood what the title meant, but they accepted it because it was what the producers wanted. Wiener admitted that they thought that the two letters together would be &quot;provocative&quot; like &quot;MASH&quot; and admitted that they had made a mistake.

==Reception==
&quot;F/X&quot; holds an 89% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 27 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus states; &quot;Smart, twisty, and perfectly cast, the effects-assisted neo-noir &quot;F/X&quot; reminds viewers that a well-told story is the most special effect of all.&quot;

Vincent Canby praised the look of the film in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, writing, &quot;the movie, which looks as if it had been made on an A-picture budget, has a lot of the zest one associates with special-effects-filled B-pictures&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars out of four: In his review for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, Jay Scott wrote, &quot;&quot;F/X&quot; is simply out to give a good time, which it does superbly&quot;. Paul Attanasio in his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised Brian Dennehy&#x27;s performance: In his review for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, George Perry praised the film&#x27;s premise as a &quot;nice idea, but the effects themselves are merely ingenious when they might have been spectacular&quot;. Sheila Benson wrote in her review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;:

<text>Aeroplan is the frequent-flyer program owned by Air Canada, Canada&#x27;s flag carrier. The Aeroplan program was created in July 1984 by Air Canada as an incentive program for its frequent flyer customers. In 2002 it was spun off as a separate corporate entity and eventually sold to Aimia. On May 11, 2017, Air Canada announced it plans to launch a new loyalty program to replace the Aeroplan program in 2020. On August 21, 2018, Air Canada, along with TD, CIBC and Visa, agreed to acquire Aeroplan from Aimia for CA$450 million in cash. There are approximately 5 million active members in the program. On August 11, 2020, Air Canada released details about its new loyalty program, which was a relaunch of Aeroplan. They launched their new Loyalty platform on November 08, 2020.

In recent years, Aeroplan has evolved into a loyalty marketing program with retail partners such as Home Hardware, Birks and Nestlé Canada. Aeroplan is also used by Air Creebec, Canadian North, Calm Air, and First Air. Internally, Aeroplan has deployed the MicroStrategy platform for business intelligence reporting and analytics for its personnel to analyze member information, track purchasing patterns, identify profiles of loyal members, and align its loyalty program with members&#x27; preferences.

Many Aeroplan members collect miles via credit cards. Credit cards were originally allocated to CIBC and Diners Club/enRoute, but were later offered to AMEX Bank of Canada, while Diners Club withdrew from the program. (The contract with CIBC expired at the end of 2013, and Aimia began a new partnership for credit cards with Toronto-Dominion Bank as the primary issuer, with CIBC relegated to a secondary role of January 1, 2014.)

In 2012, approximately 2.3 million rewards were issued to members, including more than 1.6 million flights on Air Canada or other Star Alliance carriers, which offer travel to more than 1,000 destinations worldwide.

==Corporate history==

When it was created in 1984, Aeroplan&#x27;s operations were fully integrated with those of Air Canada. In 2002, Aeroplan was spun off as a wholly owned subsidiary of Air Canada.

In June 2005, Air Canada&#x27;s parent company, ACE Aviation Holdings, sold 12.5% of Aeroplan for $250 million through an initial public offering, thereby creating the world&#x27;s first publicly traded loyalty program, Aeroplan Income Fund, at a valuation of $2 billion.

On December 20, 2007, Aeroplan Income Fund acquired Loyalty Management Group, a loyalty marketing and customer-driven insight and analysis business that owns and operates Nectar, the UK&#x27;s leading coalition loyalty program.

On May 28, 2008, ACE Aviation Holdings disposed of its remaining holdings in the fund for $438 million. As such, the Aeroplan program was no longer under direct control of Air Canada.

The corporate name was changed to Aimia in order to &quot;reflect the fact that the program has grown and diversified into a comprehensive customer loyalty program with hundreds of participating retailers.&quot;

In November 2018, Aimia signed a definitive agreement with Air Canada to sell Aeroplan back to Air Canada for $450M in cash. This means Air Canada successfully sold Aeroplan for a combined $688 million, and repurchased it 10 years later for $450 million, for a profit of $238 million before expenses or inflation adjustments. Accounting for inflation yields a sale price of $832.2 in 2018 dollars, resulting in a profit of $382M before expenses.

==Competition==

Aeroplan faces competition from many sources, including other airline reward programs (even within Star Alliance), various bank-affiliated credit card loyalty plans, and the Air Miles program.

==Mileage expiration==
Aeroplan points expire if the member has no account activity for a period of 18 months. In the past, Aeroplan had a policy where all miles would expire after seven years, even if there was continued activity in the account. This policy has since been cancelled as of June 27, 2013.

===Class action lawsuit===

When miles expire, Aeroplan offers to restore the miles for a fee of $30 plus $0.01 per mile, which in some instances has resulted in charges of several thousand dollars for high-mileage members. Members have argued that Aeroplan had already been paid for the miles through the selling partner by virtue of the retail pricing and by fees charged for certain collector credit cards. As a result, on many blogs, members were upset that their miles had been emptied from their accounts.

As Aeroplan refused to give the miles back, a class action lawsuit was launched by Montreal lawyer Owen Falquero of Merchant Law Group LLP.

On August 3, 2009, the Quebec Superior Court granted authorization to launch a class-action lawsuit challenging Groupe Aeroplan Inc.&#x27;s practice of cancelling points accumulated in its loyalty program. The motion, obtained by Montreal lawyer Owen Falquero of Merchant Law Group LLP, was filed on behalf of about seven plaintiffs across Canada; however, thousands of petitioners have registered for membership in the class. The motion was filed formally on behalf of Noella Neale of Port Coquitlam, BC, a single mother whose 150,000 points were annulled by Aeroplan because she had not made a contribution or a redemption in her account for one year, a period during which she had fallen ill. Those points fell victim to Aeroplan&#x27;s rules, under which the company erases points in an account that has been dormant for 12 months. In a telephone interview, Neale said she had been going to pay for her daughter&#x27;s trip to New Zealand—her graduation gift—until she tried to pay from her account and saw that it had been emptied. Aeroplan spokeswoman JoAnne Hayes declined to comment on the issue because it is now before the courts. In a statement, Aeroplan noted, &quot;no class action has yet been filed. This motion is the first procedural step before any such action can be instituted.&quot; The company stated, &quot;petitioners (are) seek(ing) court permission to sue Aeroplan on behalf of program members in Canada to obtain reinstatement of expired miles, reimbursement of any amounts already expended by Aeroplan members to reinstate their expired miles, $50 in compensatory damages and an undetermined amount in exemplary damages on behalf of each class member, all in relation to changes made to the Aeroplan program concerning accumulation and expiry of Aeroplan Miles as announced Oct. 16th, 2006.&quot; But Aeroplan stressed that it &quot;is of the view that there are good grounds for opposing the motion for authorization and will vigorously defend any class action, should one be authorized by the court.&quot; Neale said, &quot;I felt like they stole from me.&quot; &quot;If the bank took my money like that, it would be theft. I earned those points. They belong to me, and (Aeroplan) has no right to take them away from me.&quot; The lawsuit was settled in August 2018.

==Status Levels==

Prior to Air Canada&#x27;s acquisition and relaunch of the program in 2020, Aeroplan rewarded users with status levels upon reaching a particular level of points accumulation in a given year. This program was called Aeroplan Distinction. The levels were Aeroplan Silver, Aeroplan Black, and Aeroplan Diamond, requiring 25,000, 50,000, and 100,000 miles, respectively. Most points qualified for these levels, including those from credit card spending and actual flying, but excluded points from credit card sign up bonuses, prizes, etc. At higher levels, members were rewarded with less expensive flight redemptions, priority access to call centers, and status matching with other rewards/loyalty programs.

The Aeroplan status program was a different program from the Air Canada Altitude rewards program, which grants status and rewards while dealing with Air Canada directly. With Aeroplan back in the Air Canada fold, the Silver/Black/Diamond status program was eliminated for a refreshed Altitude rewards program.

# Other partners: Aeroplan miles can be earned and used to redeem flights from Air Canada and partner airlines. Air Canada is part of the Star Alliance, a group of 28 airlines that co-operate to expand the offerings of each individual airline. Awards are redeemable on any one of these airlines. Each flight is allocated a certain number of &quot;award seats&quot; available to be used for award redemption. There are also travel and retail partners who award Aeroplan miles for being a customer of their services.

== Buy miles ==
Since May 2020, Air Canada allows to purchase or gift Aeroplan miles. Until then, buying miles was only available when booking flight rewards, which remains the same.

==June 2013 announcements==
On June 27, 2013, it was announced that Aimia had signed a conditional agreement with Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) to become a credit-card partner as of January 1, 2014, and that Aimia would seek to terminate its decades-long relationship with CIBC. After the announcement, Aimia&#x27;s stock rose by 11 percent.

In response, CIBC suggested that Aimia was attempting to nullify CIBC&#x27;s right of first refusal. CIBC had already been hinting that it was dissatisfied with its arrangement with Aeroplan and might start its own loyalty program.

Aimia&#x27;s conditional deal with TD would last ten years and involve an up-front payment of $100 million. Aimia said that CIBC had until August 9, 2013, to exercise its right of first refusal by matching the terms of the proposed TD contract.

In another announcement, Aimia cancelled Aeroplan&#x27;s &quot;seven-year mileage redemption policy&quot;. The policy had originally come into effect at the beginning of 2007, and provided that all miles would expire if unused after seven years, with the accumulated mileage of all customers as of January 1, 2007, expiring at the end of 2013. Aimia CEO Rupert Duchesne told Bloomberg news service that people had been worried there would be a run on Aimia&#x27;s cash flow in 2013, but cancelling the seven-year expiration policy removes that worry.

In addition, on June 27, Aeroplan announced the launch of Distinction , a tiered recognition program that rewards top accumulating members based on total Aeroplan Miles earned across all coalition partners, with preferential mileage levels for redemption, bonus mile offers, and exclusive privileges. Benefits begin as of January 1, 2014, and include three status levels based on a member&#x27;s total eligible mileage accumulation during the calendar year: dSilver (25,000 miles), dBlack (50,000 miles), and dDiamond (100,000 miles).

<doc id="1285727" wikidata="Q2921452" url="?curid=1285727" title="Reclining Buddha">
<text>A reclining Buddha is an image that represents Buddha lying down and is a major iconographic theme in Buddhist art. It represents the historical Buddha during his last illness, about to enter the parinirvana. He is lying on his right side, his head resting on a cushion or relying on his right elbow, supporting his head with his hand.

This pattern seems to have emerged at the same time as other representations of the Buddha in the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara.

== In Thai art ==

For Thai Buddha attitudes (; ), the reclining Buddha (; ) can refer to three different episodes, whilst the attribute of each remains unclear.
* Nirvana attitude (; )

<text>The Zatzman Sportsplex is an indoor sports and community centre in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, opened 1982 and known as the Dartmouth Sportsplex until 2019. It houses an arena, a gymnasium, two swimming pools, and other fitness, leisure and events facilities. It is managed by the Dartmouth Sportsplex Community Association, a non-profit organization which runs the facility on behalf of the Halifax Regional Council.

== History ==

The site was formerly home to the Dartmouth Arena, which was built in 1950 and burned down on 16 May 1974. A sod-turning ceremony was held for the new Sportsplex in March 1981 by Dartmouth mayor Daniel Brownlow and Premier John Buchanan. It was constructed by Dineen Construction and cost $7 million. The Sportsplex opened in 1982. A management agreement between the municipality and the Dartmouth Sportsplex Community Association was signed in 1998, and has been renewed every year since.

The Dartmouth Sportsplex closed in early 2017 for a major renovation and expansion. A new double gymnasium and multi-purpose meeting rooms were added, while the fitness room was expanded. Most of the interior was revamped, except for the hockey arena. The project was designed by Diamond Schmitt Architects and local firm Abbott Brown. Estimated in 2016 to cost $20 million, it ended up costing about $28 million. The complex reopened in February 2019 as the Zatzman Sportsplex following a $750,000 donation from the Zatzman family in honour of the late Joseph Zatzman, businessman and former mayor of Dartmouth.

==Facilities==
 The arena has a capacity of 3,000 for hockey and 3,500 for stage events. It has been home to various junior, senior and minor and high school hockey teams. It also hosts occasional trade shows and concerts. The complex also houses a 25-metre, eight lane swimming pool, home to the Dartmouth Whalers and Dartmouth Crusaders swim clubs, as well as a smaller teaching pool.

Other facilities include meeting and community rooms, a gymnasium, fitness and cardio rooms, racquetball and squash courts, a running track, water slides, and a canteen (not yet opened following renovations).

<text>Sevilla is a town and municipality in the Valle del Cauca Department, Colombia. Widely recognized and famous as one of the best Colombian coffee producers. It is also known as the &quot;Coffee Capital of Colombia&quot; In 2003, the municipality had a population of approximately 60,000.

==History==
Founded as San Luis in 1903 by Heraclio Uribe Uribe, it was renamed for the city of Sevilla, Spain, when it became a municipality in 1914.

==Geography==
Sevilla is located in the northeastern portion of the Valle del Cauca Department, about 90 miles northeast of Cali, the department capital. Sevilla lies on the western slope of the central mountain range, the Cordillera Central, out of the three main ones resting on the beautiful landscape of Colombia. The landscape is also appropriate for long walks and horseback riding. Its climate is widely varied because it is located 1650 metres above sea level.

==Population==

According to the National census taken in 1993, Sevilla municipality had a population of 47,283, distributed as follows: men: 26,128; women: 21,155; the municipal seat had a population of 19,311. This amount was considered low as the National Census taken in 1985 gave as a result a similar amount. We mustn&#x27;t forget that on 1928 the town had a population of 22,000; then, according to National Census taken on 1961 the municipality had a population of 56,793 and was listed as the fourth most populous in the department. The last National Census, taken on 2005 gave a population of 41,632, which represented a diminished rate of growth population. In accordance with the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE), on 2010, Sevilla might have a population of 46,507.

==Resources==
There is a great variety of agricultural products as a result of its diversity on climate floors. Citrus fruits, banana, sugar cane, maize, yucca, and vegetables, among others, are abundantly produced. Cafe cultures surround the town, since the farms outside the population core are coffee producers. There are also gold, silver, and platinum mines nearby.

<text>Captain John Philip Cromwell (September 11, 1901 – November 19, 1943) was the most senior submariner awarded the Medal of Honor in World War II and one of the three submarine officers who received it posthumously. In some ways similar to his fellow honoree, Howard Gilmore, Cromwell consciously chose to sacrifice his own life to safeguard the lives of others, in a combat action which took place in November 1943.

==Early life and career==
Cromwell was born in Henry, Illinois, on September 11, 1901. Appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy in 1920, he graduated in June 1924 and served initially in the battleship USS &quot;Maryland&quot; school and was assigned to during 1927–29. He next had three year&#x27;s diesel engineering instruction, followed by further tours of duty in submarines.

Lieutenant Cromwell commanded in 1936–37, then served on the staff of Commander Submarine Division 4. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander in 1939 and spent two years in Washington, D.C., with the Bureau of Engineering and Bureau of Ships. In May 1941, he became engineer officer for the Pacific Fleet submarine force.

==World War II==
During 1942–43, Cromwell commanded Submarine Divisions 203, 44 and 43, flying his pennant in .

Following promotion to captain, he went to sea in as prospective commander of a mid-Pacific submarine wolf pack. was commanded by LCDR Fred Connaway, making his first war patrol. If conditions warranted, Cromwell would form a wolfpack with and either or under his direction. As a senior officer, Cromwell was completely familiar with the plans for the upcoming Battle of Tarawa, Operation Galvanic, and knew a lot more about ULTRA – and its source – than anyone else on . It was Cromwell&#x27;s first war patrol also.

While attacking a Japanese convoy on November 19, 1943, &quot;Sculpin&quot; was forced to the surface, fatally damaged in a gun battle and abandoned by her surviving crew members. Captain Cromwell, who knew secret details of the impending operation to capture the Gilbert Islands, deliberately remained on board as she sank. For his sacrificial heroism in preventing the enemy from obtaining this information, he posthumously received the Medal of Honor.

==Medal of Honor action==
After a brief overhaul, left Pearl Harbor for her ninth war patrol on November 5, 1943. After refueling at Johnston Island on November 7, she departed for her assigned station northeast of Truk. On November 29, COMSUBPAC radioed to order CAPT Cromwell to activate the wolfpack. When failed to acknowledge the message, even after several repetitions, she was assumed – correctly – to have been lost at sea. It wasn&#x27;t until after the war that the details of her loss – and that of John Cromwell – to enemy action became known from both Japanese sources and surviving crewmembers who had been prisoners of war.

 had actually arrived on station on November 16 and made radar contact with a large, high-speed convoy on the night of the 18th. After making a fast surface run to get ahead of the quarry, LCDR Connaway submerged for an attack at dawn. As he started his final approach, however, his periscope was spotted by the enemy, and Connaway was forced to take deep and allow the convoy to pass overhead. Then, he surfaced again to attempt another end run in broad daylight. Unfortunately, the Japanese destroyer &quot;Yamagumo&quot; had lagged behind the convoy specifically to counter such a move and, after forcing Connaway to make a quick dive, dropped a pattern of depth charges that – unbeknownst to the crew – damaged the depth gauge. went deep and laid low for several hours.

Around noon, Connaway attempted to bring back to periscope depth, seeking another opportunity to attack. However, while coming up, the broken depth gauge stuck at 125 feet, confusing the diving officer, and causing the boat to broach the surface in full view of &quot;Yamagumo&quot;, which was still patrolling the area. As crash-dived again, the Japanese destroyer dropped a string of 18 depth charges, severely damaging the boat and causing temporary loss of depth control. Numerous leaks developed in the hull, and so much water came on board that the submarine was forced to run at high speed to maintain depth. This invited a second Japanese attack that did even more damage.

At this point, Connaway concluded that the only chance of saving his crew was to come to the surface and fight it out there. surfaced, and with decks awash, her crew manned the deck guns. The result of this uneven contest was hardly in doubt. &quot;Yamagumo&#x27;s&quot; first salvo hit &#x27;s conning tower, killing the entire bridge watch team, including Connaway and his executive and gunnery officers. The gun crew died almost instantly from shrapnel. The senior ship&#x27;s officer surviving, a reserve lieutenant, ordered the boat scuttled and the crew to abandon ship.

This action left CAPT Cromwell facing a fateful choice. With his personal knowledge of both ULTRA and GALVANIC, he realized immediately that to abandon ship and become a prisoner of the Japanese would create a serious danger of compromising these vital secrets to the enemy under the influence of drugs or torture. For this reason, he refused to leave the stricken submarine and gave his life to avoid capture. He and 11 others went down with as she sank.

==After action summary==
Forty-two members of &quot;Sculpin&#x27;s&quot; crew – three officers and 39 enlisted men – were pulled from the sea by the Japanese, though one of the latter, badly wounded, was thrown back. The 41 survivors were taken to Truk and interrogated for ten days by Japanese intelligence officers. The group was divided in half for transport back to Japan on two escort carriers – 21 on &quot;Chuyo&quot; and 20 on . Those on &quot;Unyo&quot; arrived in Japan in early December and spent the rest of the war working in the Ashio copper mines, after which they were repatriated to tell their story.

On the evening of December 3, 1943, southeast of Yokosuka – with some help from ULTRA – sank &quot;Chuyo&quot;, and only one of the prisoners on board survived.

When the story of John Cromwell&#x27;s heroic sacrifice was revealed in the accounts of the survivors, COMSUBPAC VADM Charles Lockwood nominated him for the Medal of Honor. The award was approved and presented posthumously to Cromwell&#x27;s widow after the war.

==Awards and honors==


===Medal of Honor citation===
Rank and organization: Captain, U.S. Navy. Born: September 11, 1901, Henry, Ill. Appointed from: Illinois. Other Navy award: Legion of Merit.

Citation
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as Commander of a Submarine Coordinated Attack Group with Flag in the U.S.S. &quot;Sculpin&quot;, during the Ninth War Patrol of that vessel in enemy-controlled waters off Truk Island, November 19, 1943. Undertaking this patrol prior to the launching of our first large-scale offensive in the Pacific, Captain Cromwell, alone of the entire Task Group, possessed secret intelligence information of our submarine strategy and tactics, scheduled Fleet movements and specific attack plans. Constantly vigilant and precise in carrying out his secret orders, he moved his underseas flotilla inexorably forward despite savage opposition and established a line of submarines to southeastward of the main Japanese stronghold at Truk. Cool and undaunted as the submarine, rocked and battered by Japanese depth-charges, sustained terrific battle damage and sank to an excessive depth, he authorized the &quot;Sculpin&quot; to surface and engage the enemy in a gun-fight, thereby providing an opportunity for the crew to abandon ship. Determined to sacrifice himself rather than risk capture and subsequent danger of revealing plans under Japanese torture or use of drugs, he stoically remained aboard the mortally wounded vessel as she plunged to her death. Preserving the security of his mission at the cost of his own life, he had served his country as he had served the Navy, with deep integrity and an uncompromising devotion to duty. His great moral courage in the face of certain death adds new luster to the traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.

===Other honors===
In 1954, the destroyer escort was named in his honor.

Cromwell Hall, the Navy&#x27;s Submarine Learning Center at the submarine base in Groton, Connecticut, was also named for him.

<text>Fort Herkimer was a colonial fort located on the south side of the Mohawk River, opposite the mouth of its tributary West Canada Creek, in German Flatts, New York, United States.

It should not be confused with [[Fort Dayton]], which was located on the north side of the Mohawk River, in what is now Herkimer, New York.

==History==
The fort was first built in 1740 around the homestead of the Hercheimer (Herkimer) family. In 1757 during the Seven Years&#x27; War, young Captain Nicholas Herkimer (later to be a heroic general in the Revolutionary War) had his first military command of colonial forces here when the French attacked German Flatts in 1757 and 1758. It has originally known as Fort &quot;Kaouri&quot; (Fort Bear).

During the American Revolutionary War, settlers rebuilt the fort as a defensive stone stockade around the Fort Herkimer Church. A joint British and Onondaga force attacked German Flatts and the forts on each side of the river in 1778. They captured some of the settlers who were outside the southern fort, including three children of the Demuth family: Catherine, George, and Samuel. After the two older children returned to their family during a prisoner exchange but Samuel, the youngest Demuth captive, had been adopted by the Onondaga and chose to stay with them, as he had become assimilated. He later settled with them on a reservation near Syracuse, from where he kept in touch with his family and acted as an interpreter for the Onondaga and settlers.

Both the old and new forts were destroyed in 1840 during expansion of the Erie Canal, as their stones were used for its construction. The Fort Herkimer Church still stands today. The church belongs to the regional Montgomery Classis of the Reformed Church in America.

The former site of Fort Herkimer is located in the current town of German Flatts, on the south side of the Mohawk River in Herkimer County, New York. Fort Herkimer is sometimes confused with nearby Fort Dayton on the north side of the river, around which the Village of Herkimer developed.

<text>Percival Stockdale (1736–1811) was an English poet, writer and reformer, active especially in opposing slavery.

==Biography==
Born 26 October 1736 (O. S.) at Branxton, Northumberland, he was the only child of Thomas Stockdale, vicar of the parish and perpetual curate of Cornhill-on-Tweed, and his wife, Dorothy Collingwood of Murton, Northumberland. After spending six years at Alnwick grammar school, he went in 1751 to the grammar school at Berwick-upon-Tweed. He became acquainted with the Greek and Latin classics, and acquired a taste for poetry.

In 1754 Stockdale entered the University of Aberdeen, with a bursary for the united colleges of St. Leonard and St. Salvador. The death of his father in 1755 left the family with money troubles, and he accepted the offer of a lieutenancy in the Royal Welsh Fusiliers. He joined Admiral John Byng &#x27;s fleet, which anchored in the Bay of Gibraltar in May 1756. Stockdale, with part of his regiment, was on board HMS &quot;Revenge&quot;, in the expedition sent, under the command of Byng and Temple West, to the relief of the besieged garrison of St. Philip on Menorca. He returned to England in October 1756, and in November 1757 he left the army with the pretext of poor health.

Introduced to Thomas Sharp (1693–1758), archdeacon of Northumberland, Stockdale was persuaded to take holy orders. At Michaelmas 1759 he was ordained deacon by Richard Trevor, bishop of Durham. Immediately afterwards he went to London as Sharp&#x27;s substitute in the curacy and lectureship of Duke&#x27;s Place, near Aldgate. He mixed with London literati, meeting David Garrick, Samuel Johnson, Sir William Browne, Oliver Goldsmith, John Hawkesworth, and Lord Lyttelton. In 1767, having no church employment, he visited Italy, and resided for two years at Villafranca, where he read and wrote. [Possible correction: Wouldn&#x27;t Villafranca be the Italian Villafranca di Verona, the Scaliger fortress alluded to by Shakespeare as &quot;old Freetown&quot; in Romeo and Juliet? (For information on Villafranca, see Richard Roe&#x27;s The Shakespeare Guide to Italy.) He returned to London in 1769.

Stockdale succeeded William Guthrie in editing &quot;The Critical Review&quot;, and edited the &quot;Universal Magazine&quot; in 1771. Lord Sandwich, First Lord of the Admiralty, appointed him chaplain of HMS &quot;Resolution&quot;, a guardship lying at Spithead; he was attached to the vessel for three years. In 1779 he contributed to the &quot;Public Advertiser&quot; political letters under the signature of &quot;Agricola&quot;. According to his own account, he missed out on the work that became Samuel Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Poets&quot; (1779–81).

After a brief time as tutor to the eldest son of Lord Craven, Stockdale was presented in 1780 by Sir Adam Gordon to the rectory of Hinxworth, Hertfordshire; while there he took priest&#x27;s orders. In 1783 Lord-chancellor Thurlow presented him to the vicarage of Lesbury, Northumberland, and to this the Duke of Northumberland added the vicarage of Long Houghton, in the same county. On 28 October 1784 Archbishop John Moore conferred on him the Lambeth degree of M.A.

After paying a visit to Tangier for the sake of his health, Stockdale returned to Lesbury in 1790. His reaction to the Haitian Revolution of 1792 put him among the radical abolitionists. With William Roscoe, he defended the violence with which slaves liberated themselves.

Stockdale died at Lesbury on 14 September 1811, and was buried at Cornhill-on-Tweed.

<text>Johannes Nikolaus Tetens (also Johann; ; 16 September 1736 – 17 August 1807) was a German-Danish philosopher, statistician and scientist.

He has been called the &quot;German Locke,&quot; on the basis of a comparison of his major work &quot;Philosophische Versuche über die menschliche Natur und ihre Entwickelung&quot; (1777) with the work of John Locke. He is considered to have been an influence on Immanuel Kant.
==Biography==
Tetens was born 1736 in Tetenbüll/Tetenbøl in the Danish Duchy of Schleswig. He studied mathematics and physics at the University of Rostock and the University of Copenhagen. He acquired an MA in 1759 and his PhD in 1760. From 1760 to 1765, he taught philosophy and physics (&quot;natural philosophy&quot; at that time) at the (in Bützow, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania). During this decade, he wrote many treatises on various subjects, ranging from the color of the sky to the existence of God through the origins of languages (see e. g. references in Johann Christian Poggendorff, 1863). After this polygraphic formation period, Tetens goes back to more fundamental enquiries: after having read David Hume&#x27;s work, he popularized it throughout the German-speaking world. Tetens is therefore supposed to have introduced Immanuel Kant to phenomenalistic thought and to the empiricism / transcendence dualism.

In 1776, Tetens became Professor of Philosophy at the University of Kiel. Nonetheless, in the years following 1789, Tetens began another career as a high-ranking Danish civil servant: member of the &quot;Finanzcollegium&quot; in Copenhagen, then (1791) counselor of state, and (1803) co-director of the state bank and director of the widow pension funds. By this time, he was interested in pure mathematics as well as in applications. His interest in polynomial algebra was influenced by his belonging to the German combinatorial school of Carl Friederich Hindenburg, Christian Kramp and others. His main applied work was concentrated on actuarial mathematics. He taught at Kiel until 1785.

The book &quot;Einleitung zur Berechnung der Leibrenten und Anwartschaften&quot;, published in Leipzig in 1785 (first part) and 1786 (second part) was a landmark of actuarial science. It contains an extensive synthesis of previous work on the subject, from Halley&#x27;s mortality table to Richard Price&#x27;s &quot;Observations on reversionary payments&quot;. It is recognized by actuaries for featuring the first risk measure ever (the &quot;Risico der Casse&quot;); moreover it offers some insights in mathematical statistics: by using an approximation of the binomial distribution, Tetens tried to compute the confidence level of a given sampling procedure.

<text>Penetrating oil, also known as penetrating fluid, is a low-viscosity oil. It can be used to free rusted mechanical parts (such as nuts and bolts) so that they can be removed, because it can penetrate into the narrow space between the threads of two parts. It can also be used as a cleaner; however, it should not be used as a general-purpose lubricant or a corrosion stopper. Using penetrating fluids as general-purpose lubricants is not advisable, because such oils are relatively volatile. As a result, much of the penetrating oil will evaporate in a short amount of time, leaving little residual lubricant. 

Other uses include removing chewing gum and adhesive stickers, and lessening friction on metal-stringed musical instruments.

<text>The Harding Tomb is the burial location of the 29th President of the United States, Warren G. Harding and First Lady Florence Kling Harding. It is located in Marion, Ohio. Also known as the Harding Memorial, it was the last of the elaborate presidential tombs. 

==Construction==
Shortly after Harding died in office, the Harding Memorial Association formed to raise money for a memorial site in honor of the late president. The association ultimately received $978,000 in donations from more than one million people across the country, as well as contributions from several European nations. Among the list of contributors from the United States were an estimated 200,000 school children, who donated pennies towards the memorial. The tomb is located in Marion, Ohio, at the southeast corner of Vernon Heights Boulevard and Delaware Avenue, just south of Marion Cemetery.

==Architecture==
Construction began in 1926 and finished in the early winter of 1927. It is designed in the style of a circular Greek temple with Doric order marble columns. The columns are built of Georgia white marble and are high and in diameter at the base. Designed by Henry Hornbostel, Eric Fisher Wood and Edward Mellon, the winners of a 1925 national design competition, the structure is in diameter and in height.

The structure is unroofed (&quot;peribolus&quot;), in the style of some Greek temples in which the center (Hypaethros) was open to the sky and without a roof (&quot;medium autem sub diva est sine tecto&quot;). The open design honors the Hardings&#x27; wishes that they be buried outside, and is covered in ivy and other plantings.

==Burials==
At their deaths, the bodies of the Hardings were entombed in the Marion Cemetery Receiving Vault. Once the Harding Memorial was completed in 1927, the bodies were reinterred in the Memorial&#x27;s sarcophagus and it was sealed. Because Harding&#x27;s reputation was damaged by personal controversies and presidential scandals, the Harding Memorial was not officially dedicated until 1931 when President Herbert Hoover presided.

== Dedication ==
On June 16, 1931, President Herbert Hoover gave a speech at the dedication ceremony of the Warren G. Harding memorial. The following are excerpts from Hoover&#x27;s eulogy:

==Oversight==
The Harding Memorial Association transferred ownership of the Harding Memorial to the Ohio Historical Society (OHS) in March 1979, after passage of state legislation authorizing the takeover. OHS undertook a federally-funded, $538,000 restoration in 1988, and began to refer to the site as the Harding Tomb.

Following a reduction in state funding, the Ohio Historical Society transferred day-to-day management of the tomb and the nearby Harding Home to Marion Technical College (MTC) in April 2010. OHS paid MTC $105,000 a year to run the two sites, achieving a savings of about $60,000 annually. MTC agreed to spend $20,000 in 2010 to help run the site. OHS continues to co-ordinate with MTC on major site issues.

The memorial is the last of the elaborate presidential tombs. This trend began with the burial of President Abraham Lincoln in his tomb in Springfield, Illinois. Since Harding, presidents have chosen burial plot designs that are simpler or combined those with their library sites.

<doc id="1285771" wikidata="Q2890611" url="?curid=1285771" title="Battle of Fish Creek">
<text>The Battle of Fish Creek (also known as the Battle of [[Tourond&#x27;s Coulee|Tourond&#x27;s Coulée]]), fought April 24, 1885 at Fish Creek, Saskatchewan, was a major Métis victory over the Canadian forces attempting to quell Louis Riel&#x27;s North-West Rebellion. Although the reversal was not decisive enough to alter the ultimate outcome of the conflict, it was convincing enough to persuade Major General Frederick Middleton to temporarily halt his advance on Batoche, where the Métis would later make their final stand.

==Battle==
Middleton, having led his Field Force out from Qu&#x27;Appelle on April 10, was advancing upstream from Clarke&#x27;s Crossing along the South Saskatchewan River when scouts discovered an apparent ambush by Gabriel Dumont&#x27;s Métis / Dakota force at Fish Creek, about south of Batoche. Fish Creek was Métis land.

Upon learning that Middleton was marching toward Batoche, Dumont suggested to Riel the use of guerrilla warfare, by blowing up train tracks to slow their progress. Riel countered that guerrilla tactics were &quot;too much like Indian warfare&quot;. Dumont also proposed to attack them by surprise at night, but after he learned that Middleton&#x27;s scouts were already on the lookout, he had to scrap the idea.

On April 23, as the militia began advancing from Clarke&#x27;s Crossing, south of Batoche, Dumont took 200 men and rode out from Batoche toward Tourond&#x27;s Coulée. Louis Riel accompanied them. When a (false) report arrived that the North-West Mounted Police were advancing on Batoche, Riel returned there with 50 men. Dumont stationed most of his men in the coulée, where they set to work digging rifle pits. Meanwhile, Middleton had arrived at a point about south of Fish Creek, and set up camp. Dumont took a party of twenty horsemen forward of the coulée. Their task was to seal the exit when the ambush was sprung, like a buffalo pound. However, an inexperienced Métis soldier had forgotten Dumont&#x27;s specific demand to stay away from the road as it could give the location of the Métis away. The next day, the militia were about to attempt to cross the coulée. A scout spotted the tracks of the inexperienced Métis soldier and began to follow them. The scout was coming close to Dumont and his men, and Dumont stealthily attempted to catch him. Before Dumont could catch the scout, the Métis and Canadian Militia had come into contact with each other, and it was then that the concealed Métis in the rifle pits attempted to ambush the militia. Dumont, under pressure, shot the militia&#x27;s scout and returned to his men in the poplar bluff rifle pits to fight the rest of the Canadian militia.

The Métis pounded Middleton&#x27;s men with one devastating fusillade before withdrawing into cover and restricting themselves to sniper fire in order to conserve ammunition. Their position was strategically selected and enabled a simple and effective strategy of defence.

Since the Métis were positioned in the coulée, they were restricted to shooting up towards the Canadian Militia, and many of the wounds were mainly in the upper body and head area.

With half of his force on the opposite side of the river, Middleton was unable to bring his full numbers to bear. One of his artillery batteries opened fire on the Métis to little effect, although well-fired cannonades did succeed in driving away Dumont&#x27;s Cree allies before their weight could be added to the battle.

Many of Dumont&#x27;s men were fleeing the battle. Dumont stopped as many men as he could from leaving and convinced them to keep fighting. Dumont&#x27;s numbers were decreasing vastly, as he had 47 of the 130 men that he began fighting with. Dumont very outnumbered, but was able to keep the Métis casualties to a minimum.

Strung out along the coulée&#x27;s edge, silhouetted against the sky, the militia fired a vast amount of ammunition at the resistance, succeeding mostly in showering tree branches across the ravine, but when the artillerymen pushed their guns to the coulée&#x27;s edge to try to fire down at the concealed Métis, they suffered heavy casualties. The only targets the militia could clearly see were the Métis&#x27; tethered horses: they killed about 55 of them.

General Middleton attempted to place himself in full view of the resistance. However, a bullet tore through his fur hat, and his two aides-de-camp were both wounded by his side. The frustrated Canadians, their casualties mounting, undertook several fruitless rushes into the ravine. A few infantry regulars under Middleton&#x27;s command made one charge. Another, larger one was carried out by the 90th &quot;Winnipeg&quot; Battalion of Rifles. This latter advance was parried by the Métis&#x27; use of improvised barricades within the coulée. These uncoordinated advances accomplished nothing but more Canadian casualties. Middleton in a statement later on said: &quot;[Métis] plans were well arranged beforehand and had my scouts not been well to the front we should have been attacked in the ravine and probably wiped out&quot;.

With night coming on, Middleton, distressed by the casualties he was taking, opted for retreat. At the battle&#x27;s end, both sides had withdrawn from the battlefield but the Métis had inflicted greater casualties and had delayed Middleton&#x27;s march on the Métis&#x27; headquarters at Batoche. Weeks later, after news reached him of the Cree victory over Colonel William Dillon Otter – to whom had been issued a Gatling gun – at Cut Knife, Middleton arrived at Batoche.

==Legacy==
The site of the battle was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1923.

In the spring of 2008, Tourism, Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Christine Tell proclaimed in Duck Lake, that &quot;the 125th commemoration, in 2010, of the 1885 Northwest Resistance is an excellent opportunity to tell the story of the prairie Métis and First Nations peoples&#x27; struggle with Government forces and how it has shaped Canada today.&quot;

The Battle of Fish Creek National Historic Site, now named Tourond&#x27;s Coulée / Fish Creek National Historic Site, preserves the battlefield of April 24, 1885 at &quot;la coulée des Tourond &quot;, and the story of Madame Tourond&#x27;s home. The National Historic site of Middleton&#x27;s camp and graveyard is across the Fish Creek water body and is north west of the theatre of battle which occurred in the creek valley west of the Tourond farmhouse site.

<doc id="1285781" wikidata="Q3014899" url="?curid=1285781" title="Haugh unit">
<text>The Haugh unit is a measure of egg protein quality based on the height of its egg white (albumen). The test was introduced by Raymond Haugh in 1937 and is an important industry measure of egg quality next to other measures such as shell thickness and strength.

An egg is weighed, then broken onto a flat surface (breakout method), and a micrometer used to determine the height of the thick albumen (egg white) that immediately surrounds the yolk. The height, correlated with the weight, determines the Haugh unit, or HU, rating. The higher the number, the better the quality of the egg (fresher, higher quality eggs have thicker whites). Although the measurement determines the protein content and freshness of the egg, it does not measure other important nutrient contents such as the micronutrient or vitamins present in the egg.

==Formula==
The formula for calculating the Haugh unit is:
:formula_1

Where:
*HU = Haugh unit
*&quot;h&quot; = observed height of the albumen in millimeters
*&quot;w&quot; = weight of egg in grams

Haugh Index :

AA : 72 or more

A : 71 - 60

B : 59 - 31

C : 30 or less

Below are the USDA&#x27;s terms describing egg white and its corresponding Haugh unit:

(a) Clear. A white that is free from discolorations or from any foreign bodies floating in it. (Prominent chalazas should not be confused with foreign bodies such as spots or blood clots.)

(b) Firm (AA quality). A white that is sufficiently thick or viscous to prevent the yolk outline from being more than slightly defined or indistinctly indicated when the egg is twirled. With respect to a broken-out egg, a firm white has a Haugh unit value of 72 or higher when measured at a temperature between 45formula_2F and 60formula_2F.

(c) Reasonably firm (A quality). A white that is somewhat less thick or viscous than a firm white. A reasonably firm white permits the yolk to approach the shell more closely which results in a fairly well defined yolk outline when the egg is twirled. With respect to a broken-out egg, a reasonably firm white has a Haugh unit value of 60 up to, but not including, 72 when measured at a temperature between 45formula_2F and 60formula_2F.

(d) Weak and watery (B quality). A white that is weak, thin, and generally lacking in viscosity. A weak and watery white permits the yolk to approach the shell closely, thus causing the yolk outline to appear plainly visible and dark when the egg is twirled. With respect to a broken-out egg, a weak and watery white has a Haugh unit value lower than 60 when measured at a temperature between 45formula_2F and 60formula_2F.

<text>Picketing is a form of protest in which people (called pickets or picketers) congregate outside a place of work or location where an event is taking place. Often, this is done in an attempt to dissuade others from going in (&quot;crossing the picket line&quot;), but it can also be done to draw public attention to a cause. Picketers normally endeavor to be non-violent. It can have a number of aims but is generally to put pressure on the party targeted to meet particular demands or cease operations. This pressure is achieved by harming the business through loss of customers and negative publicity, or by discouraging or preventing workers or customers from entering the site and thereby preventing the business from operating normally.

Picketing is a common tactic used by trade unions during strikes, who will try to prevent dissident members of the union, members of other unions and non-unionised workers from working. Those who cross the picket line and work despite the strike are known pejoratively as scabs.

==Types of picket==
Informational picketing is the legal name given to awareness-raising picketing. Per Merriam-Webster&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Law&quot;, it entails picketing by a group, typically a labour or trade union, which inform the public about a cause of its concern. In almost all cases this is a disliked policy or practice of the business or organisation. It is a popular picketing technique for nurses to use outside of healthcare facilities. For example, on April 5, 2006, nurses of the UMass Memorial Medical Center (UMMHC) took part in two separate such events to protect the quality of their nursing program. Informational picketing was used to gain public support and promote further bargaining with management. It may also be a spur or auxiliary to a petition to government to seek regulatory intervention, reliefs, dispensations or funds.

A mass picket is an attempt to bring as many people as possible to a picket line to demonstrate support for the cause. It is primarily used when only one workplace is being picketed or for a symbolically or practically important workplace. Due to the numbers involved, and depending on behaviors, it may turn into an unlawful blockade such as a right of way obstruction, or aggravated trespass (denial of access).

Secondary picketing is of any external entity economically connected to the main business subject to the workers&#x27; action. Thus it includes against suppliers on which the picketed business relies, retailers who sell its products, physical premises with shared management or majority shareholders (sister/allied premises) and homes of any of the latter persons. For example, at the Battle of Saltley Gate in 1972 in England, striking miners picketed a coke works in Birmingham and were later joined by thousands of workers from industries locally. 
In most jurisdictions, secondary pickets lack all or many of the civil law protections given to primary pickets.

Secondary picketing has been illegal (in the sense that, unlike lawful picketing, it may give rise to a cause of action in tort) in the United Kingdom since the coming into force of section 17 of the Employment Act 1980, a law tabled and passed by the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher. Labour sought repeal of this via the party&#x27;s 1987 manifesto; the party called for a debate on such issues in the next (1992) manifesto; and dropped this position under Tony Blair and later leaders&#x27; manifestos from 1997 onwards.

Another tactic is to organise highly mobile pickets, who can turn up at any of a business&#x27;s locations quickly. These flying pickets are particularly effective against multi-facility businesses that could otherwise pursue legal prior restraint and shift operations among facilities if the locations were known with certainty ahead of time. The first highly strategic use of such may have been the example of the 1969 miners&#x27; strike in Britain. Flying pickets are usually not legal in the United Kingdom; workers must only picket at their workplace.

Picketing can interweave with boycotting campaigns by pressure groups across the political and moral spectrum. In particular, religious groups such as the Westboro Baptist Church seek to picket local store fronts and events they consider sinful. Non-employee protesters are third parties to the business so counter-actions may lie in the courts (or out-of-court remedies) for disruption of trade, unlawful protest, defamation, and certain types of illegal advertising, trespass and nuisance, against which freedom of expression, of religion and/or a public interest defense vie. Different jurisdictions weigh these two competing sets of rights differently. The global result is that the rules and outcomes are fact-sensitive (rest closely on the actions, form, subject-matter, duration and behaviors) and law-sensitive (divergently regulated or governed by case law).
==Disruptive picketing==
Disruptive picketing covers a wide variety of pickets: 
*Obstructive picketing which significantly physically narrows or stalls the flow of persons, goods or services into and out of the business.
*Public order or highway offense picketing which due to behaviors, third-party supporters, or overspill meets with or is entitled to be met with police or local authority enforcement measures to limit its activities or street-side support.
*Criminally violent or menacing picketing: use of force (battery and/or criminal damage), or reasonably perceptible and real threats of such (assault), to injure or sufficiently intimidate persons. 
**At several pickets at the height of the UK miners&#x27; strike (1984–85), picketers pelted strikebreakers with stones, paint and brake fluid. Police arrested many of these picketers for offences against the person.
*Vexatious picketing which due to very high frequency causes severe loss of economic activity and/or reputation.

Obstructive picketing may be contrasted with non-obstructive picketing, in which the impact on the business or organization is likely to be limited to the presence nearby of a group of people close in number to the number of strikers, who have an informational picketing line, assembly or rally. It is possible, but rarely allowed in labor law globally, to have an informational picket in a public place of a business which has no simultaneous strike – i.e., a protest of workers outside of their shifts. In some sectors, the immediate financial impact of a non-obstructive picket could be negligible, and the longer-term impacts could include a human resources policy or public-facing policy enhancement and a consumer relations uplift.

==Legality==
Picketing, as long as it does not cause obstruction to a highway or intimidation, is legal in many countries and in line with freedom of assembly laws, but many countries have restrictions on the use of picketing.

Legally defined, recognitional picketing is a method of picketing that applies economic pressure to an employer with the specific goal to force the employer to recognise the issues facing employees and address them by bargaining with a union. In the US, this type of picketing, under Section 8(b)(7)(A) of the National Labor Relations Act, is typically illegal if representation is not relevant or is unquestionable.

In the UK mass picketing was made illegal under the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927, moved by the leaders of what would soon be National Labour, after the 1926 General Strike. Otherwise picketing was banned by the Liberal-tabled Criminal Law Amendment Act 1871 but is decriminalised by the Conservative-tabled Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875. The Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 gives protection, under civil law, for pickets who are acting in connection with an industrial dispute at or near their workplace who are using their picketing peacefully to obtain or communicate information or persuading any person to work or abstain from working. However, many employers seek specific injunctions to limit the effect of picketing by their door if they can evidence a high likelihood of intimidation or, in general, on non-peaceful behaviour and/or any that significant numbers of the picketers are or will in all likelihood be non-workers.

In the US, any strike activity was hard to organise in the early 1900s, but picketing became more common after the Norris–La Guardia Act of 1932, which limited the ability of employers to gain injunctions to stop strikes, and further legislation to support the right to organise for unions. Mass picketing and secondary picketing was outlawed by the 1947 Taft–Hartley Act. Some kinds of pickets are constitutionally protected.

Viewing laws against stalking as potentially inconsistent with labor rights of picketing, the first anti-stalking law of the industrial world, made by California&#x27;s lawmakers, inserted provisions that disapply many of its protections from &quot;normal labor picketing&quot;, which has survived subsequent amendments.

<text>Tami Stronach (born July 31, 1972) is an actor, dancer, filmmaker, and professor.

A childhood performance as the Childlike Empress in the 1984 film &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot; led to a record deal and music video in Germany. After receiving inappropriate attention as a young star, Stronach pivoted to dancing. As an adult, she has branched into teaching, producing dance performances, filmmaking, and supporting child performers.

==Personal life==
Tami Stronach was born on July 31, 1972, in the Imperial State of Iran. Her parents were the archaeologists David Stronach from Scotland (1931–2020) and Ruth Stronach from Israel (; 1937–2017). Stronach, her sister Keren, and their parents fled the Iranian Revolution to Tel Aviv before moving to the United Kingdom and then to California in 1981 to allow David to teach at the University of California, Berkeley.

By late 2014, Stronach and her daughter Maya (born ) lived in Brooklyn; Stronach was married to Greg Steinbruner as of mid-2020.

==Performance career==
In addition to her artistic projects, Stronach also followed in her father&#x27;s footsteps, becoming a professor in New York City.

===Acting===
As a child, Stronach studied musical theatre. While portraying Piglet in a San Francisco stage adaptation of &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;, she was approached by the casting director for &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot; and asked to audition for the role of the Childlike Empress. After three auditions, Stronach beat Heather O&#x27;Rourke to star in the 1984 film; it has been her only major motion picture. Ruth Stronach lived with her daughter in Bavaria for the three-month film shoot, and afterwards declined a sequel contract for her daughter, worried about lacking the wherewithal to &quot;help her daughter navigate the turbulent waters of childhood stardom in the film industry&quot;. After &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot; became a sensational success, the Stronachs were besieged with unwanted attention: their home and telephone were stalked, adults proposed to the eleven-year-old with engagement rings, and she received &quot;offers from Hollywood to play roles featuring scenes (with nudity) completely inappropriate for someone her age&quot;.

Stronach returned to acting in 2002 with a physical theatre company, and by 2006 had performed in &quot;Chambre&quot; at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club and was continuing to study acting with Laura Esterman.

===Singing===
During the junket for &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot;, Stronach appeared on a German talk show and was asked how much German language she had learned; after explaining she only knew the lyrics to &quot;99 Luftballons&quot;, she agreed to sing live on TV. The next day, a music producer offered a record deal. With only three days left in the country, the Stronachs agreed to the contract, songs were written, Stronach recorded them and starred in a music video, and she eagerly performed one of the songs—&quot;Fairy Queen&quot;—on two German TV shows, all before returning to the US. She later said of the whirlwind experience: &quot;It was insane, [...] And then literally that was it. We didn&#x27;t change the ticket.&quot;

===Dancing===
Switching her focus from acting to professional dancing after &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot;, Stronach devoted herself to that study for ten years (through her twenties) in New York City. In 1996, Stronach began dancing with Neta Pulvermacher and Dancers, though she has also exhibited her own productions at Dixon Place, Washington Square Park, and the Galápagos Islands.

===Credits===
==Production career==
By the 2010s, Stronach had co-founded a theatre company called Shoehorn Theater; in 2012, they began creating a new play, &quot;Light: A Dark Comedy&quot; (&quot;a group generative effort where everyone is involved in every step of the creation.&quot;)

Steinbruner and Stronach created The Paper Canoe Company, an entertainment business that focused on &quot;children&#x27;s theatre, film, and education&quot;. After the TV series &quot;Stranger Things&quot; used &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot; and renewed interest in Stronach and the 1984 film, the couple began making their own 1980s-styled fantasy film. &quot;Man and Witch: The Dance of a Thousand Steps&quot; stars Shohreh Aghdashloo, Sean Astin, Michael Emerson, Christopher Lloyd, Rhea Perlman, and Stronach&#x27;s daughter, Maya. , the film was in post-production.

<text>Dennis Cooper (born January 10, 1953) is an American novelist, poet, critic, editor and performance artist. He is best known for the &quot;George Miles Cycle&quot;, a series of five semi-autobiographical novels published between 1989 and 2000 and described by Tony O&#x27;Neill &quot;as intense a dissection of human relationships and obsession that modern literature has ever attempted.&quot; Cooper is the founder and editor of &quot;Little Caesar Magazine,&quot; a punk zine, that ran between 1976 and 1982.

==Early life==
Cooper was born in Pasadena, California and raised in Arcadia, the son of Clifford Cooper, a self-made businessman who was one of the early designers of parts for uncrewed space expeditions. His parents were politically conservative, with his father acting as an advisor to several presidents, including Richard Nixon, with whom he cultivated a close friendship. One of his brothers, Richard, was named after Nixon. Cooper&#x27;s parents divorced when he was in his early teens. Cooper attended public schools before he started attending Flintridge Preparatory School in high school; he was expelled in 11th grade. He attended Pasadena City College and Pitzer College.

Cooper began reading French literature at 15 and was drawn to Marquis de Sade in particular for his risqué depictions of libertine sex. He was also inspired by French novelists/directors such as Jean Cocteau, Alain Robbe-Grillet, and Marguerite Duras. Though he had started writing surreal stories at age 12, he became a more focused writer at 15 and tried to imitate the writing styles of Arthur Rimbaud and de Sade. He began planning out a five-book series that would later become &quot;The George Miles Cycle&quot;. Punk subculture was a major part of his twenties. In 1976, Cooper moved to London for a brief period.

==Career==
Cooper started &quot;Little Caesar Magazine&quot; in 1976; the punk zine, which ran for 12 issues between 1976 and 1982, featured multimedia contributions from Andy Warhol, David Wojnarowicz, Debbie Harry, Bob Flanagan, and Toby Ross. In 1978, he started Little Caesar Press, which would go on to help establish artists such as Amy Gerstler, Peter Schjeldahl, and Elaine Equi. Cooper published his first book of poetry, &quot;Idols&quot;, in 1979 and his second, &quot;Tenderness of the Wolves&quot;, in 1981. &quot;Tenderness of Wolves&quot; was nominated for a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Book Prize the same year.

In 1979, he began working as the Director of Programming at the Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center, where he continued to produce &quot;Little Caesar Magazine&quot;. He held this position until 1983, when he moved to New York City. Shortly after, he published his first novella, &quot;Safe&quot;, and became serious about writing the five-book series he had been planning since he was fifteen. He left New York in 1985 to follow a boyfriend to Amsterdam, where he finished &quot;Closer&quot;, the first book in the &quot;George Miles Cycle&quot; and Cooper&#x27;s first novel. To get into the right headspace to write &quot;Closer&quot;, Cooper regularly took meth. The book later won the very first Ferro-Grumley Award for gay literature. During this time, he supported himself financially by writing for American magazines such as &quot;The Advocate&quot;, &quot;Art in America&quot;, and &quot;Artforum&quot;, the latter eventually taking him on as a regular.

Cooper returned to New York in 1987, where he worked on &quot;Frisk&quot; and several projects including co-curating an exhibit with Richard Hawkins entitled &quot;AGAINST NATURE: A Group Show of Work by Homosexual Men&quot;, which was open at the LACE in 1988. Cooper returned to Los Angeles in 1990 and continued collaborating with other artists, including composer John Zorn, painter Lari Pittman, sculptors Jason Meadows and Nayland Blake, and others. He also started the Little House on the Bowery curated imprint, which included works from Travis Jeppesen, Richard Hell, James Greer, Trinie Dalton, Derek McCormack, and others, under the independent publisher Akashic Books. In the 1990s, he wrote for &quot;Spin&quot; and published &quot;Period&quot;, the last book in the &quot;George Miles Cycle&quot;, in 2000. His novel &quot;The Sluts&quot; won the 2007 Prix Sade award in France and a Lammy.

Cooper moved to Paris in 2005 and has collaborated with French theater director Gisèle Vienne, composers Peter Rehberg and Stephen O&#x27;Malley, and the performer Jonathan Capdevielle on six works for the theater, &quot;I Apologize&quot; (2004), &quot;Un Belle Enfant Blonde&quot; (2005), &quot;Kindertotenlieder&quot; (2007), a stage adaption of his novella &quot;Jerk&quot; (2008), &quot;This Is How You Will Disappear&quot; (2010), and &quot;Last Spring, a Prequel&quot; (2011). &quot;The Weaklings&quot; was published in limited numbers by Fanzine Press in 2008 and was followed by a full-length collection &quot;The Weaklings (XL)&quot; in 2013.

Since living in France, Cooper has published a number of novels, had a cameo in Christophe Honoré&#x27;s &quot;Homme au Bain&quot;, released a book/CD collaboration with Gisèle Vienne and Peter Rehberg, reissued the graphic novel &quot;Horror Hospital Unplugged&quot; he released with Keith Mayerson in 1997, and curated part of the 2012 &quot;Un Nouveau Festival&quot; with Gisèle Vienne. In 2012, Kunstverein Amsterdam held &quot;CLOSER: The Dennis Cooper Papers&quot;, a multimedia exhibit celebrating &quot;The George Miles Cycle&quot;.

In 2015, Cooper worked with artist Zac Farley to write and direct an anthology of short films titled &quot;Like Cattle Towards Glow&quot;. The two later collaborated for Permanent Green Light, which premiered in 2018 at the International Film Festival Rotterdam.

==Google controversy==
In mid-2016, Cooper engaged in a two-month standoff with Google after it deleted his blog and Gmail accounts without warning, due to what the company described as unspecified violations of their terms of use policy. Ten years of Cooper&#x27;s writings were lost, including a novel. Cooper termed the situation &quot;a nightmare&quot;. Cooper&#x27;s plight attracted media attention, including from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, and &quot;Die Welt&quot;. Google&#x27;s attorneys contacted Cooper and after long negotiations, returned his data.

==Influence==
Cooper&#x27;s work has been acknowledged as an influence on a number of writers, including Travis Jeppesen, Kay Gabriel, Tony O&#x27;Neill, Jackie Ess, Noah Cicero, Shiv Kotecha, Jon Lindsey, Dominic Lyne and Poppy Z. Brite. Cooper&#x27;s poetry, including the first poem he ever wrote (about David Cassidy) appear in the film &quot;Luster&quot; as the work of lead character Jackson. American indie rock band Deerhunter, and grindcore act Pig Destroyer have both cited Dennis Cooper as a lyrical influence. Cooper has also influenced a number of artists such as Ryan Trecartin, Jonathan Mayhew, Lizz Brady, Chris Kelso, Daniel Portland, Jared Pappas-Kelley, Ken Baumann, Blair Mastbaum, which he has included in exhibitions such as the &quot;Weaklings&quot; or who he has showcased over the years. Within his work Cooper is often inspired by and quotes from underground and independent music; as with the lyrics of the band Hüsker Dü in the novel Try, and the naming of the 1992 curated show &quot;The Freed Weed&quot;, from a compilation by the band Sebadoh, which has been discussed in a number of interviews and analyses.

==George Miles Cycle==

The cycle has now been translated into 18 foreign languages and is the subject of numerous academic studies. They include two volumes of critical essays devoted to the cycle: &quot;Enter at Your Own Risk&quot; (2004), edited by Leora Lev, and &quot;Dennis Cooper: Writing at the Edge&quot; (2008), edited by Paul Hegarty and Danny Kennedy.

In the spring of 2000 Cooper published &quot;Period&quot;, the last of a series of five novels known as the George Miles cycle (ISBNs refer to the Grove Press paperback editions):
* &quot;Closer&quot; (1989), 
* &quot;Frisk&quot; (1991), 
* &quot;Try&quot; (1994), 
* &quot;Guide&quot; (1997), 
* &quot;Period&quot; (2000), 

&quot;… [I]n the ninth grade Cooper met his beloved friend George Miles. Miles had deep psychological problems and Cooper took him under his wing. Years later, when Cooper was 30, he had a brief love affair with the 27-year-old Miles. The cycle of books … came later, and were an attempt by Cooper to get to the bottom of both his fascination with sex and violence and his feelings for Miles.&quot; &lt;br&gt;       — &quot;3:AM Magazine&quot;, November 2001, &quot;American Psycho: An Interview With Dennis Cooper&quot; by Stephen Lucas

&quot;George in &quot;Closer&quot;, whose room is full of Disney figures, himself becomes the toy of two forty-year-old men obsessed with the beauty of pain and suffering. In &quot;Frisk&quot;, an ex-friend is writing Julian letters: reports or fantasies of sex and violence. The description of the sexual murdering of young men is a melange of blood and slippery internal organs, too unappetizing to quote. The letters are being sent from a Holland windmill, in its isolation an ideal place for exploring the raw reality of sex, violence and death.&quot; &lt;br&gt;       — VPRO Television; article in Dutch

In 2021, Cooper published &quot;I Wished&quot;, a sort of coda of the George Miles Cycle, through Soho Press. According to writer Justin Taylor, the novel is, &quot;a postscript that functions just as handily as an introduction, deconstruction, or reboot.&quot;

<doc id="1285790" wikidata="Q201837" url="?curid=1285790" title="Matthew Upson">
<text>Matthew James Upson (born 18 April 1979) is an English former professional footballer who played as a centre back. Upson played for England at full international level including at the 2010 World Cup.

Upson started his career with Bedfordshire club Luton Town before he joined Premier League club Arsenal for a fee of £2 million in May 1997. Upson struggled to force his way into the first team at Highbury making 57 appearances in 6 seasons and also spent time out on loan at Nottingham Forest, Crystal Palace and Reading.

Upson joined Birmingham City in 2003 where he enjoyed regular first team football. However following Birmingham&#x27;s relegation in 2006 he went on to join West Ham United for £7.5 million in January 2007. He was made captain in 2009 following the departure of Lucas Neill. At the end of the 2010–11 season West Ham were relegated to the Championship and Upson left after his contract had expired. Upson signed a two-year contract with Stoke City in August 2011. After a loan spell with Brighton &amp; Hove Albion in the 2012–13 season, he signed a one-year contract with the club in 2013.

==Club career==
===Luton Town===
Upson was born in Eye, Suffolk, and attended Diss High School in Norfolk. Originally at the Ipswich Town Centre of Excellence, he joined Luton Town as a trainee after Ipswich youth coach Terry Westley moved there. Upson signed professional forms in April 1996, and made his sole Football League appearance for the team as an 88th-minute substitute against Rotherham United in August 1996.

===Arsenal===
He joined Arsenal in May 1997 in a £2 million deal. However, faced with the longevity of Arsenal&#x27;s existing centre backs, Tony Adams, Steve Bould and Martin Keown, and struck by injury problems of his own, Upson rarely had a chance to break into the first team. He played only five matches in the 1997–98 Premier League season as Arsenal won the title, so did not qualify for a winners&#x27; medal. After spending a year out of the game recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament injury sustained in 1999, Upson made a handful of first-team appearance for Arsenal, in between loan spells at Nottingham Forest in 2000 and Crystal Palace in 2001.

In 2001–02, his final full season at Arsenal, Upson made 22 appearances. These included 14 in the league, which earned him a Premier League winners&#x27; medal, but a broken leg in February 2002 ruled him out for the rest of the season and Arsenal&#x27;s FA Cup-winning run as they won the Double. After recovering from the injury, Upson joined Reading in September 2002 on a three-month loan. It was for Reading that he scored his first professional career goal, in a 3–1 loss away to Cambridge United in the League Cup. With Arsenal&#x27;s newly established centre-back pairing of Sol Campbell and Kolo Touré keeping him out of the team, he was bought by Birmingham City in January 2003.

===Birmingham City===
Birmingham City completed the signing of Upson from Arsenal in January 2003, for what BBC Sport thought to be an initial fee of £1 million, potentially rising to £3 million depending on appearances.

He suffered a leg injury whilst preparing for the local derby against Aston Villa in April 2006 and subsequently missed the rest of the season as Birmingham City were relegated to the Championship. Upson remained with the club while he worked on regaining his fitness, and returned to action in December in the 3–0 victory over Plymouth Argyle, scoring the second of the three goals.

===West Ham United===
On 18 January 2007, Birmingham rejected West Ham United&#x27;s bid for Upson of £4 million, and turned down an improved bid of £6 million a few days later. An offer of £6 million, with the potential to rise to £7.5 million depending on appearances, was accepted on the last day of the transfer window, and Upson agreed a four-and-a-half-year contract with West Ham. Birmingham City&#x27;s manager Steve Bruce later claimed that he did not want to sell Upson, but was forced to do so by the club&#x27;s managing director Karren Brady.

Upson suffered a calf injury less than 30 minutes into his West Ham United debut, a 1–0 defeat against Aston Villa. He then lasted just 11 minutes of his comeback match before coming off injured against Tottenham Hotspur in a 4–3 loss at Upton Park in March 2007.

Upson completed his first full match for West Ham in the 2–0 home defeat to Manchester City in August 2007. One week later he made his first appearance as West Ham captain in the 1–0 away win against former club Birmingham City. On 29 December, Upson scored for the first time in West Ham colours when he headed in the winning goal against Premier League champions Manchester United.

In July 2008, Upson&#x27;s squad number of 6 was retired by the club in memory of Bobby Moore, after which he took the number 15 shirt. In August 2009, following the departure of Lucas Neill, Upson was appointed captain of West Ham. He captained West Ham through a difficult 2009–10 campaign in which he scored a goal in the opening match against Wolverhampton Wanderers and two more against Stoke City and Portsmouth.

Following West Ham&#x27;s relegation from the Premier League in May 2011, new manager Sam Allardyce confirmed that Upson would leave the club when his contract expired.

===Stoke City===
Upson joined Stoke City on a two-year contract on 9 August 2011. He said that playing in the UEFA Europa League was one of the main reasons he decided to join Stoke. Upson made his debut for Stoke in a 1–0 victory over FC Thun in the Europa League, and scored his first goal for the club in the second leg in a 4–1 victory at the Britannia Stadium. After joining Stoke, Upson and fellow summer signing Jonathan Woodgate were used as backup to first-choice centre backs Robert Huth and Ryan Shawcross. He was a regular in the Europa League, appearing in all six group matches, but was sent off in the last as Stoke qualified for the round of 32. He scored his first league goal for Stoke in a 2–0 home win against Swansea City on 26 February 2012 in a man-of-the-match performance. With Shawcross suspended, Upson made his first League appearance of the 2012–13 season on 29 December 2012 against Southampton; he scored Stoke&#x27;s second goal in a 3–3 draw.

===Brighton &amp; Hove Albion===
On 31 January 2013, Upson joined Championship club Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on loan until the end of the season. He scored his first goal for the Seagulls in a 6–1 win over Blackpool on 20 April. Released by Stoke at the end of the season, Upson joined Brighton on a permanent basis on 10 July 2013, signing a one-year contract. He was voted the club&#x27;s Player of the Year in 2013–14.

===Leicester City===
On 23 May 2014, Upson agreed a one-year contract with newly promoted Premier League club Leicester City. After spending the first half of the season on the sidelines with injury, he returned to full training in late January 2015. On 10 February, Upson made his Leicester debut, playing nearly an hour before being substituted, in a 2–1 defeat to his former club Arsenal. He was released when his contract expired at the end of the season.

===Milton Keynes Dons===
On 30 July 2015, Upson signed for Championship club Milton Keynes Dons on a one-year contract. He made his debut on 11 August in the 2–1 League Cup first round win against Leyton Orient, but made only six more appearances for the club and his contract was not renewed. He retired from playing in 2016.

==International career==
Upson played for England at youth level before being capped twelve times for the under-21 team, for whom he scored two goals. Regular Premier League football for Birmingham City in the 2002–03 season led to his selection for the senior squad, and he made his debut for England against South Africa in May 2003. He won seven full caps while a Birmingham player.

Upson was named in Fabio Capello&#x27;s first provisional England squad for the February 2008 friendly against Switzerland at Wembley. He was named in the starting line-up to partner Rio Ferdinand, winning his eighth England cap more than three years after his last appearance. He also started against Kazakhstan in October after John Terry picked up an injury.

Upson scored his first goal for England on 19 November 2008 in a friendly match against Germany. The match finished 2–1 to England and Upson picked up ITV&#x27;s man of the match award. He was included in England&#x27;s squad for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. On 23 June, making his World Cup debut, he played in the third match of the group stage, against Slovenia after being an unused substitute in the first two matches. He scored England&#x27;s goal in the 4–1 defeat against Germany in the round of 16his second goal for England and his second against Germany. It made him England&#x27;s joint top scorer for the 2010 World Cup, tying with Steven Gerrard and Jermain Defoe on one goal each. The match was a defensive fiasco for Upson, who, along with Terry was caught out by a goal-kick allowing Miroslav Klose to score the opener on 20 minutes. The defenders were also opened up for Lukas Podolski to score 12 minutes later. In the second half, Upson and Terry were caught on the break twice as England attempted to equalise.

==Personal life==
Upson and British runner Ellie Darby have a son named Elijah. Upson has appeared as a football pundit for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Match of the Day&quot; and during their 2018 World Cup and 2022 World Cup coverage.

<text>Richard Reader Harris, K.C. (1847 – 25 March 1909) was a prominent English barrister, King&#x27;s Counsel and Master of the Bench of Gray&#x27;s Inn, who was also a Methodist minister, founder of the Pentecostal League of Prayer, and author of 34 Christian books. He is particularly remembered as an advocate of British Israelism, the belief that people of Western European descent are also the direct lineal descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes.

== Professional career ==
He started his career as a civil engineer for the Great Western Railway (GWR) and Great Eastern Railway (GER), before taking a post as chief engineer to the Republic of Bolivia. On his return to London in 1883 he trained for the bar, and was called at Gray&#x27;s Inn, where he was later elected to the Bench.

== Christian life ==
===Early beliefs===
Reader Harris drifted from the liberal view of Christianity of his teens to join Charles Bradlaugh&#x27;s Ethical Society. Bradlaugh, an atheist, mocked Christians who lived immoral lives while he lectured on Bible texts and advocated that his audience abide by ideas expressed in the Sermon on the Mount. As a member of the Puritan wing of Bradlaugh&#x27;s Ethical Society, Harris pledged not to smoke or drink.

===Marriage &amp; Christian Conversion===
When Reader Harris married Mary Griffin Bristow in 1880, he converted to Christianity. At the same time the elevated social status of his wife&#x27;s family brought him entry to the upper strata of London society.

===Pentecostal League of Prayer===
In 1891 both he and his wife founded the Pentecostal League of Prayer as &quot;an interdenominational union of Christian people who, conscious of their own need, would join in prayer to fill believers with the Holy Spirit; revive Christian churches and spread scriptural holiness.&quot; Harris became a close friend of evangelist Oswald Chambers.

When the new League began publishing the &quot;Tongues of Fire&quot; magazine it became associated in the mind of the public with the emerging &quot;tongues movement&quot;. Reader Harris claimed that the two had no connection other than their reference to the second chapter of the Book of Acts (Acts 2:6-12). In November 1907 he stated that:

There is nothing wrong with speaking in tongues; it was the privilege of the early Church, and it may be the privilege of any believer today.

===Wife===
His wife was a leader in her own right, which was uncommon but not unheard of for a woman in her day. Another more famous example was Catherine Booth, who was also of Methodist background. Apart from having helped him start the League of Prayer, she was also an author who went under the name Mrs Reader Harris.

===&quot;Ten Lost Tribes&quot;===
In 1907 Reader Harris wrote his book &quot;The Lost Tribes of Israel&quot;, which expressed his belief in the theory that the Anglo-Saxons are descended from the Ten Lost Tribes:

Such then are the Scriptures that appear to me to furnish strong evidence in favour of the contention of those who believe that in the Anglo-Saxon race God possesses today the descendants of the house of Israel. If this be true, it adds tremendously to our responsibilities, and opens before us in a way that no human tongue can describe, spiritual possibilities, temporal possibilities, national possibilities, and universal possibilities.

==Death==
On 25 March 1909 Reader Harris suffered a stroke and remained in a coma at his home in London and without regaining consciousness he died four days later at the age of sixty-one. On 6 April, two thousand people attempted to attend his funeral at West Norwood Cemetery. Hundreds stood outside.

<doc id="1285795" wikidata="Q144703" url="?curid=1285795" title="Kevin Willis">
<text>Kevin Alvin Willis (born September 6, 1962) is an American former professional basketball player mostly known for playing with the Atlanta Hawks in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was a 7-foot power forward/center. Excluding players not yet eligible, he holds the record for most games played among those not in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

Willis is one of fifteen players in NBA history with over 16,000 career points and 11,000 career rebounds. He was named to the NBA Eastern Conference All-Star Team in 1992, when he finished the season with a career-high average of 15.5 rebounds a game. 
Willis holds career averages of 12.2 ppg, 8.4 rpg, and 0.9 apg while averaging 27 minutes per game in 21 NBA seasons. During his 23 years in the league, Willis won one championship, with the San Antonio Spurs in 2003. He shares the second position for most seasons played in the NBA with Robert Parish, Kevin Garnett, and Dirk Nowitzki.

During the 2004–05 season, Willis was the oldest player in the league at age 42, and he would continue to be until his retirement at the conclusion of the 2006–07 season at the age of 44.

==Early life==
Born in Los Angeles, Willis graduated from Pershing High School in Detroit and joined the basketball team in his junior year.

==College career==
Willis played competitively at Jackson College for his freshman season and transferred to Michigan State University, where he would play three seasons as a fashion and textiles major.

==Professional career==

===Atlanta Hawks (1984–1994)===
He was selected in the 1984 NBA draft by the Atlanta Hawks. On March 11, 1986, Willis scored a career-high 39 points and grabbed 21 rebounds during a 128–116 win over the Denver Nuggets.
In total, he played with the Hawks for nine seasons (plus two games of a tenth season) until 1994. Willis teamed with Dominique Wilkins, Spud Webb, and Doc Rivers to frequently guide the Hawks to playoff appearances as well as providing a fierce rebounding presence in the post. Near the end of his stint with the Hawks, he and Wilkins were both made team captains.

===Miami Heat (1994–1996)===
Willis was traded to the Miami Heat in 1994 for Grant Long and Steve Smith. Willis&#x27; first season was tumultuous, and the trade was so poorly received in Miami that it indirectly led to the organization seeking to, and eventually succeeding in, hiring Pat Riley to be their new head coach and General Manager.

===Golden State Warriors (1996)===
On the 1996 NBA trade deadline, the Golden State Warriors acquired Willis, along with Bimbo Coles, in exchange for Chris Gatling and Tim Hardaway.

===Houston Rockets (1996–1998)===
Willis signed with the Houston Rockets in 1996.

===Toronto Raptors (1998–2001)===
On June 9, 1998, Willis was traded to the Toronto Raptors for Roy Rogers and two 1998 first-round picks.

===Denver Nuggets (2001)===
On January 12, 2001, the Denver Nuggets acquired Willis, Aleksandar Radojević, Garth Joseph, and a 2001 2nd-round pick in a deal that brought Tracy Murray, Keon Clark, and Mamadou N&#x27;Diaye to Toronto. He and Radojević were traded together nine months later to the Milwaukee Bucks for Scott Williams and a 2002 second-round pick.

===Return to Houston Rockets (2001–2002)===
Without playing a game for the Bucks, Willis was traded back to the Rockets for another 2002 second-round pick.

===San Antonio Spurs (2002–2004)===
Willis signed with the San Antonio Spurs. It was in 2003 with the Spurs that he finally won an NBA Championship ring.

===Return to Atlanta Hawks (2004–2005)===
Willis returned to the Hawks for one more season in 2004–05, and by doing so, positioned himself to be the oldest player in the league.

===Dallas Mavericks (2007)===
On March 30, 2007, &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; reported that Willis needed only to pass a physical to be able to sign with the Western Conference-leading Dallas Mavericks. Willis, who did not play in 2005–06, was reported to take the team&#x27;s vacant 15th roster spot. The deal became official when he signed a 10-day contract with the Mavericks on April 2, 2007. He appeared in five late regular-season games and was on the Mavericks playoff roster as the 12th man but did not play in the Mavericks&#x27; shocking early first-round exit. By playing five games during 2006–07, Willis became the oldest person to play more than two games in an NBA season (Providence Steamrollers coach Nat Hickey activated himself for two games in 1948, at 45 years and 363 days old.) Hall of Famer Robert Parish, who – at age 43 – played 43 games with the Chicago Bulls in 1996–97, previously held many of Willis&#x27; longevity and age-based records.

===Retirement===
Willis ended his playing career after the 2006–07 season, returning to his clothing business, Willis &amp; Walker. The Atlanta-based company, which specializes in custom wear for big and tall men, was founded in 1988 by Willis and his former Michigan State teammate Ralph Walker.

Professional wrestler Lex Luger revealed that Willis made him various suits in his time as a clothier, as well as a white, collared Nehru shirt that he would later prominently wear in his WCW return on Nitro in 1995. Luger knew Willis from years prior, with the former having worked in the Georgia-based promotion originally from 1987 to 1992.

==Television appearances==
In 2007, Willis made three appearances on the Spike TV reality show, &quot;Pros vs Joes&quot;.

<text>Quest for Camelot (released internationally as The Magic Sword: Quest for Camelot) is a 1998 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Warner Bros. Feature Animation and directed by Frederik Du Chau and very loosely based on the 1976 novel &quot;The King&#x27;s Damosel&quot; by Vera Chapman. It features the voices of Jessalyn Gilsig, Cary Elwes, Gary Oldman, Eric Idle, Don Rickles, Jaleel White, Jane Seymour, Pierce Brosnan, Bronson Pinchot, Gabriel Byrne, John Gielgud (his final film), Frank Welker, and Sarah Rayne. Andrea Corr, Bryan White, Celine Dion, and Steve Perry perform the singing voices for Gilsig, Elwes, Seymour, and Brosnan. The story follows Kayley (Gilsig), the adventurous daughter of a Knight of the Round Table killed by the power-hungry Sir Ruber (Oldman). When Ruber&#x27;s renewed attempt to usurp Camelot from King Arthur (Brosnan) by stealing Excalibur goes awry, Kayley enlists the help of the blind hermit Garrett (Elwes) and a two-headed dragon, Devon and Cornwall (Idle and Rickles), to help her retrieve the sword and save the kingdom.

In May 1995, the film, initially titled &quot;The Quest for the Holy Grail&quot;, was announced to be Warner Bros. Feature Animation&#x27;s first project, with Bill Kroyer and Du Chau jointly directing the film. The film went into production later that year, but was delayed when animators were reassigned to help finish &quot;Space Jam&quot; (1996). During the interim, the story was heavily re-tooled; among these changes was its central focus on the Holy Grail being replaced with Excalibur. Creative differences spurred by these alterations resulted in prominent members of the animation and management staff, including Kroyer, leaving the project. Due to its troubled production, the film&#x27;s release was delayed by six months, from November 1997 to May 1998. Animation was mostly done in Glendale, California and London, England.

&quot;Quest for Camelot&quot; was released by Warner Bros. under their Family Entertainment label on May 15, 1998 in the United States and Canada. It received mixed reviews and was a commercial failure, grossing $38.1 million against a $40 million budget. One of the film&#x27;s songs, &quot;The Prayer&quot;, won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song.

==Plot==

Set in a Celtic mythology, Sir Lionel is a knight of the Round Table, who is killed foiling an assassination attempt on King Arthur by the evil Sir Ruber, who is then driven off by Excalibur, Arthur&#x27;s sword. Later, while at Lionel&#x27;s funeral, Arthur tells Lionel&#x27;s daughter, Kayley, and his widow, Juliana, that they will always be welcome at Camelot. Kayley dreams of becoming a Knight, like her father, and trains herself while working on their farm.

A decade later, Ruber&#x27;s griffin attacks Camelot, where he steals Excalibur and injures Arthur. Merlin&#x27;s pet falcon, Ayden, attacks the griffin, causing it to drop the sword into the Forbidden Forest. The Griffin is driven away by the forest&#x27;s sentient trees. When Kayley hears the news she plans to search for Excalibur herself, which leads to an argument with her mother. Ruber attacks the farm and captures Kayley and Juliana, planning to use them to gain entry to Camelot. He uses a potion he got from some witches to fuse his henchmen with their weapons and a henpecked rooster named Bladebeak. After hearing Ruber&#x27;s plans, Kayley escapes and heads to the forest, pursued by the steel men and Bladebeak. Once in the forest, Kayley is saved by Garrett, a blind hermit, and Ayden. They decide to search for Excalibur, and Kayley persuades him to let her join the quest. Ruber learns of this from Bladebeak and decides to follow them in order to obtain Excalibur.

Kayley and Garrett encounter a wisecracking two-headed dragon named Devon and Cornwall, whose two heads can not stand each other and dream of being separated, and can neither fly nor breathe fire. They escape from a group of attacking dragons, who are taken out by Ruber and his henchmen, and Devon and Cornwall join their quest. During a night of rest (much to Kayley&#x27;s reluctance), Garrett reveals he was once a stable boy in Camelot, and dreamt of becoming a knight. He was kicked in the head while saving the horses from a fire, causing his blindness. Following the accident, Sir Lionel still believed in Garrett and trained him personally. Garrett teaches Kayley more about the forest, including the existence of magical healing plants.

The next day, they only find the belt and scabbard of Excalibur in a giant footprint. Kayley&#x27;s frustrated ranting causes Garrett to miss Ayden&#x27;s signal, and he is injured by Ruber&#x27;s men. Kayley uses the sentient trees to trap Ruber and his men, and escorts Garrett into a remote cave where she uses a healing plant to heal Garrett&#x27;s wounds. Kayley and Garrett reconcile and profess their love for each other. The next day, the group goes into a giant cave where a rock-like ogre holds Excalibur, using it as a toothpick. They recover Excalibur and flee from Ruber in the process.

After reaching the end of the forest, Garrett decides to stay behind, claiming he does not belong in Camelot, and gives Excalibur to Kayley. Ruber captures Kayley, takes Excalibur and melds it to his right arm before imprisoning Kayley in the wagon with Juliana. Devon and Cornwall, who witness this, rush to Garrett and convince him to save Kayley. By working together for the first time, Devon and Cornwall are able to fly and breathe fire, and they fly Garrett to Camelot. Bladebeak reconciles with his constantly henpecking hen and frees Kayley from her ropes, and she warns the guards of Ruber&#x27;s trap, exposing him and his steel men. Garrett, Devon and Cornwall arrive shortly after and come to her aid. Kayley and Garrett enter the castle while Devon and Cornwall rescue Ayden from the Griffin by breathing fire at the creature.

Inside, Kayley and Garrett find Ruber attempting to kill Arthur with Excalibur. They intervene and trick Ruber into returning Excalibur to its stone, causing its magic to vaporize Ruber, revert his henchmen, including Bladebeak, back to normal and temporarily separate Devon and Cornwall, but they decide to end up back together again. Later, with Camelot and Excalibur restored to their former glory, Kayley and Garrett marry and become Knights of the Round Table before they ride off into the distance together on their horse.

==Production==
In May 1995, &quot;The Quest for the Grail&quot; was Warner Bros. Feature Animation&#x27;s first announced project. Bill Kroyer and Frederik Du Chau were announced as the directors, with Sue Kroyer serving as co-producer. Elizabeth Chandler, who had co-written the screenplay for &quot;A Little Princess&quot; (1995), was enlisted to write the script, but was eventually replaced by a trio of writers before Kirk DeMicco eventually got the job (who would go on to direct animated features such as the 2023 film &quot;Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken&quot;). The initial story centered around a young female character named Susannah, who embarks on a dangerous quest for the Holy Grail to save her sister from a ruthless and powerful knight. According to Lauren Faust, who was an animator for the film, it was initially envisioned with a PG-13 rating and was meant to draw homage to Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s &quot;Wizards&quot; (1977), but it was changed to be more family-friendly to compete with the Disney Renaissance films.

The film was put into production before the story was finalized. However, during the fall of 1995, the animators were reassigned to finish &quot;Space Jam&quot; (1996). Meanwhile, in April 1996, Christopher Reeve was cast as King Arthur. During the interim, several story changes were made that resulted in creative differences between the Kroyers and the studio management. In particular, Excalibur replaced the Holy Grail, which Warner Bros. Feature Animation president Max Howard felt better reflected the film&#x27;s setting: &quot;The symbol of Camelot is the power of Excalibur, and that became a more interesting theme: Whoever held the sword, held the power.&quot; By the middle of 1996, the Kroyers were allegedly fired by Howard, who later moved on to developing another project at Warner Bros. Feature Animation.

Following the departure of the Kroyers, two supervising animators along with several employees in the studio&#x27;s art department subsequently left the project. The film&#x27;s initial producer, Frank Gladstone, left the project in February 1997 and was replaced with Dalisa Cohen. Effects supervisor Michel Gagné recalled that &quot;People were giving up. The head of layout was kicked out, the head of background, the executive producer, the producer, the director, the associate producer—all the heads rolled. It&#x27;s kind of a hard environment to work in.&quot; Eventually, Du Chau was promoted to be the film&#x27;s director. Meanwhile, Reeve was replaced by Pierce Brosnan when he became unavailable to record new dialogue.

In an article in &quot;Animation Magazine&quot;, Chrystal Klabunde, the leading animator of Garrett, stated, &quot;It was top heavy. All the executives were happily running around and playing executive, getting corner offices—but very few of them had any concept about animation at all, about doing an animated film. It never occurred to anybody at the top that they had to start from the bottom and build that up. The problems were really coming at the inexperience of everyone involved. Those were people from Disney that had the idea that you just said, &#x27;Do it,&#x27; and it gets done. It never occurred to them that it got done because Disney had an infrastructure in place, working like clockwork. We didn&#x27;t have that.&quot; Reportedly, &quot;cost overruns and production nightmares&quot; led the studio to &quot;reconsider their commitment to feature animation.&quot; Filmmaker Brad Bird (who directed &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;, Warner Bros.&#x27; next animated film) thought that micromanaging, which he said had worked well for Disney but not for Warner Bros., had been part of the problem.

===Animation===
The film was mainly animated at the main Warner Bros. Feature Animation facility located in Glendale, California and London, England. In January 1996, the London animation studio was opened where more than 50 animators were expected to animate 20 minutes of animation, which would be sent back to Glendale to be inked-and-painted. Additional studios that worked on the film included Yowza! Animation in Toronto, Ontario, where they assisted in clean-up animation, Heart of Texas Productions in Austin, and A. Film A/S in Copenhagen where, along with London, about a quarter of the film was animated overseas. The supervising animators were Athanassios Vakalis for Kayley, Chrystal Klabunde for Garrett, Cynthia Overman for Juliana, Alexander Williams for Ruber, Dan Wagner for Devon and Cornwall, Stephan Franck for the Griffin and Bladebeak, and Mike Nguyen for Ayden.

To create the rock-like ogre and other computer-generated effects, the production team used Silicon Graphics&#x27; Alias Research software. According to Katherine Percy, the head of CGI effects, the software was originally designed for special effects used in live-action films.

==Music==

On January 31, 1996, David Foster and Carole Bayer Sager were attached to compose several songs for the film. The album peaked at #117 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song for &quot;The Prayer&quot;. The song was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song, but lost to &quot;When You Believe&quot; from DreamWorks&#x27; &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;.

On the soundtrack, &quot;The Prayer&quot; was performed separately by Celine Dion in English, and by Andrea Bocelli in Italian. The now better-known Dion-Bocelli duet in both languages first appeared in October 1998 on Dion&#x27;s Christmas album &quot;These Are Special Times&quot;; it was also released as a single in March 1999 and on Bocelli&#x27;s album &quot;Sogno&quot; in April 1999.

&quot;Looking Through Your Eyes&quot; was the lead single for the soundtrack. Andrea Corr of The Corrs and Bryan White performed the song as a duet in the film, while LeAnn Rimes performed the song during the end credits as the pop version. The second single off the soundtrack, &quot;I Stand Alone&quot;, performed by White in the film, and Steve Perry for the end credits. Other original songs composed for the film include &quot;United We Stand&quot;, &quot;On My Father&#x27;s Wings&quot;, &quot;Ruber&quot;, and &quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Have You&quot;.

===Songs===
Original songs performed in the film include:

==Release==
The film was originally slated for November 14, 1997, but was pushed to May 15, 1998, to give the production team more time to finish the film.

===Marketing===
The film was accompanied with a marketing campaign with promotional licensees including Tyson Foods, Kraft Foods, PepsiCo via Frito-Lay, Kodak, ConAgra Foods via Act II Popcorn, and Hasbro via Kenner Products. The fast food restaurant chain Wendy&#x27;s had toys based on the characters included in a kid&#x27;s meal, while Kodak had print advertisements on over 200 million photo processing envelopes. Warner Bros. also partnered with Scholastic to produce children&#x27;s books based on the film.

===Home media===
&quot;Quest for Camelot&quot; was released on VHS and DVD by Warner Home Video in the United States and Canada on October 13, 1998. The VHS edition includes a teaser trailer for Warner Bros. and Morgan Creek Productions&#x27; &quot;The King and I&quot; (1999) and the &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoon, &quot;The Two Mouseketeers&quot;, while the DVD included several making-of documentaries with interviews of the filmmakers and cast and a music video of &quot;I Stand Alone&quot;. To help promote the home video release of the film, Warner partnered with Act II Popcorn, Smucker&#x27;s, American Express, Continental Airlines, Best Western Hotels, CoinStar and UNICEF, which advertised its trick-or-treat donation boxes before Halloween arrived. Other promotions with the purchase of every video included a free &quot;Devon &amp; Cornwall&quot; pendant, a mail-in offer for a free 14-inch &quot;Devon &amp; Cornwall&quot; stuffed toy, and a Warner Bros. 75th Anniversary savings booklet worth over $150 in special offers and valuable savings.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 41% based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Diminished by uneven animation and treacly songs,&quot; Quest for Camelot&quot; is an adventure that ought to be tossed back to the Lady in the Lake.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 50 based on 22 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a B+ on a grade scale from A to F.

Owen Gleiberman, reviewing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, wrote, &quot;The images are playful and serviceably lush, but the story and characters might have come out of a screenwriting software program, and the songs (sung by Celine Dion and Steve Perry, among others) are Vegas-pop wallpaper.&quot; David Kronke of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the film as &quot;formulaic&quot; and wrote that it was &quot;a nearly perfect reflection of troubling trends in animated features&quot;. He called Kayley &quot;a standard-issue spunky female heroine&quot; and said that &quot;Garrett&#x27;s blindness is the one adventurous element to the film, but even it seems calculated; his lack of sight is hardly debilitating, yet still provides kids a lesson in acceptance.&quot;

Critical of the story, animation, characters, and music, James Berardinelli of &quot;ReelViews&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;dull, uninspired, and, worst of all, characterized by artwork that could charitably be called &#x27;unimpressive. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Coming on the heels of 20th Century Fox&#x27;s lush but silly &quot;Anastasia&quot; (a much better film than this one), &quot;Quest for Camelot&quot; suggests that Disney still owns the artistic franchise on animated features.&quot; Kevin J. Harty, an editor of a collection of essays titled &quot;Cinema Arthuriana&quot;, says that the film is &quot;slightly indebted to, rather than, as Warner publicity claims, actually based on&quot; Chapman&#x27;s novel.

Peter Stack of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; said that the film is &quot;a spirited adventure with generous romantic and comic charms&quot; that &quot;aims to please a range of ages, with loopy gags, corny romance, an oversized villain and catchy tunes performed by Celine Dion and LeAnn Rimes, among others.&quot; Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; considered the film as a &quot;lightweight but likable fantasy that offers a playfully feminist twist to Arthurian legends&quot; and noted that the &quot;animation, though not quite up to Disney standards, is impressive enough on its own terms to dazzle the eye and serve the story.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;Quest for Camelot&quot; grossed $6 million on its opening weekend, ranking third behind &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot; and &quot;Deep Impact&quot;. The film ultimately grossed $22.5 million during its theatrical run in North America. Cumulatively, the film grossed $38.1 million worldwide. The studio lost about $40 million on the film.

===Accolades===
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2004: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs:
** &quot;The Prayer&quot; – Nominated

==Adaptations==
===Stage adaptation===

Prior to the release of the film, Warner Bros. had plans to make a stage adaptation of the film that would tour around to different renaissance fairs throughout the United States, as well as a nightly fireworks show for Six Flags Great Adventure. Both shows were designed by SLG Design &amp; Creative Talent and Steve Gilliam.

The touring aspect of the project was cancelled soon after the film&#x27;s release due to poor box office performance and the tour&#x27;s anticipated cost, but the nightly firework show did end up coming to fruition. Quest for Camelot Nights debuted at Six Flags Great Adventure in 1998, and ran through 2001.

The show told the story of the film, with much of the film&#x27;s main characters appearing as live characters in the show. The film&#x27;s musical numbers were acted out with scenes from the film displayed with projections onto the show&#x27;s &quot;water curtains&quot;.

===Audiobook===
The Quest for Camelot Audio Action-Adventure was a follow along audiobook based on the film. Released April 7, 1998, the interactive story features two new songs that were not included in the movie, &quot;Camelot&quot; and &quot;To Be a Knight&quot;. Initially announced in 1996, the audiobook was scheduled to be released October 1997, but was delayed until April 1998. The story was narrated by Val Bettin.

===Video games===
The first video game was titled &quot;Quest for Camelot&quot; and is an action-adventure video game developed by Titus Interactive and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Color in 1998, and later was added to the Nintendo Switch Online service on September 5, 2023. A Nintendo 64 version of the game was planned, but was scrapped due to the film&#x27;s performance at the box office. The second video game was titled &quot;Quest for Camelot: Dragon Games&quot; is a computer game developed by Knowledge Adventure, it gives the player the ability to explore Camelot after the events of the film. In addition to exploring the world, the player gets to raise a dragon egg and watch it grow.

<text>The Oncidiinae is a subtribe within the Orchidaceae that consists of a number of genera that are closely related.

This subtribe consists of about 70 genera with over 1000 species, with &quot;Oncidium&quot; as its largest genus. These genera consist of a single floral type based on the angle of the attachment of the lip to the column, reflecting pollinator preferences. This has however led to several unreliable results and polyphyletic taxa within &quot;Oncidium&quot;. These were transferred to &quot;Gomesa&quot; and a new genus &quot;Nohawilliamsia&quot;, has been described for &quot;Oncidium orthostates&quot;

Most species have well-developed pseudobulbs and conduplicate leaves.

It is possible to form hybrids in some instances between multiple genera within the Oncidiinae. These hybrids are often colloquially referred to as &quot;intergenerics.&quot;

<text>George Clayton Johnson (July 10, 1929 – December 25, 2015) was an American science fiction writer, who co-wrote with William F. Nolan the novel &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;, the basis for the MGM 1976 film. He also wrote television scripts for &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (including &quot;Nothing in the Dark&quot;, &quot;Kick the Can&quot;, &quot;A Game of Pool&quot;, and &quot;A Penny for Your Thoughts&quot;), and the first telecast episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, entitled &quot;The Man Trap&quot;. He also wrote the story and screenplay on which the 1960 film &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot; and its 2001 remake were based.

==Early life==
Johnson was born in a barn in Cheyenne, Wyoming, was forced to repeat the sixth grade, and dropped out of school entirely in the eighth. He briefly served as a telegraph operator and draftsman in the United States Army, then enrolled at the Alabama Polytechnic Institute (now Auburn University) under the G.I. Bill, but quit to return to his travels around the U.S., working as a draftsman, before becoming a writer.

==Writing career==

Between 1956 and early 1957, he created the story entitled &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; beginning with a 40,000 word attempt at a novel. During this time he asked his friend Jack Golden Russell, a former WWII paratrooper, if he could add ideas of authenticity to the tale, later crediting him for his contributions to the story. Johnson then thought of approaching the story as a screenplay. Under the name &quot;George Johnson&quot;, he solely authored the script on which the 1960 and 2001 films were based for the Rat Pack film &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11,&quot; although most of the details were changed for the actual film. The story and screenplay were optioned to Peter Lawford and his wife, Patricia Kennedy (sister, at that time, of the future President John F. Kennedy) in 1957. 

In 1959, Johnson wrote the story &quot;I&#x27;ll Take Care of You&quot; for &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;. From 1959 onward, Johnson&#x27;s work began to regularly appear in magazines such as &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone Magazine&quot;, &quot;Rogue&quot;, and &quot;Gamma&quot;, and he began to write stories and scripts for TV. Later, Johnson joined the Southern California School of Writers that included, among others, William F. Nolan, Charles Beaumont, Richard Matheson and Ray Bradbury.

Through them he met Rod Serling, to whom he sold his story &quot;All of Us Are Dying&quot;, which was produced as &quot;The Four of Us Are Dying&quot;, scripted by Serling. Eventually, after selling other stories and having them scripted by other writers for the show, Johnson asked Serling to let him attempt a teleplay for the series, which was &quot;A Penny for Your Thoughts&quot;. Later, after completing more scripts for &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, he worked as a writer for other television series, including &quot;Honey West&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Route 66&quot; and &quot;Kung Fu&quot;. Johnson also wrote the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;The Man Trap&quot;, which was the first episode telecast. Johnson briefly had a L.A.-based radio program called &quot;The Writer and the Story&quot; which featured interviews with authors, including Charles Beaumont and William F. Nolan. As his career progressed, Johnson formed, in the 1960s, a loose, short-lived federation with fellow authors and friends Matheson, Theodore Sturgeon, and others called &quot;The Green Hand&quot;. The intent was to leverage their works in the fashion of a union within the Hollywood system for TV production. Unfortunately, the enterprise fell apart after a few months. In his later years, he wrote comic books and was a frequent guest at science fiction and comics conventions. Johnson co-created the comic book series &quot;Deepest Dimension Terror Anthology&quot; with cartoonist and author Jay Allen Sanford.

==Personal life==
Johnson married Lola Brownstein on October 10, 1952, in Los Angeles, and fathered two children, Paul and Judy. He was a vocal advocate for the legalization of marijuana. Along with his writing output, Johnson was instrumental to the early development of San Diego Comic Con. He was also a longtime vegetarian.

===Death===
Johnson died on Christmas Day 2015, of bladder and prostate cancer at a Veterans Administration Medical Center hospital in North Hills, California. He is interred at Riverside National Cemetery.

<doc id="1285802" wikidata="Q7226182" url="?curid=1285802" title="Polycarp (children's TV show host)">
<text>Polycarp ( in the Cajun French manner) was a fictional character who was a local children&#x27;s television show host. His program, &quot;Polycarp and Pals&quot;, was broadcast from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s on KATC Channel 3 in Lafayette, Louisiana, USA.

==Background==
Polycarp was portrayed by the KATC employee John Plauché (27 July 1932 - June 1978), hired by KATC in May 1963 and who it credited for the show&#x27;s originality. &quot;It is a land created through the wonderful imagination of John Plauche, who as Polycarp Phillipe Pecot Number 2, makes our lives a little happier, the world a brighter place [in which] to live.&quot; (Polycarp often jokingly warned viewers in his Cajun-accented English, &quot;Don’t ask for Number One &#x27;cuz dat&#x27;s my daddy and dey don&#x27;t like him anyway.&quot;)

An avuncular Cajun dressed in a plaid shirt, waistcoat and crumpled straw hat, Polycarp lived on a houseboat, the &quot;Narcisse Number 3&quot;, &quot;somewhere way back in the Anse La Butte Swamp midway between the Parishes of Fantaisie and Réalité&quot;, as a KATC newsletter put it in 1967. (In later programs, Polycarp traded his houseboat for a general store.) KATC described Polycarp&#x27;s imaginary world as &quot;A modern-day &#x27;fairytale&#x27; land of happiness and laughter for girls and boys and tall people . . . undoubtedly the happiest place in Acadiana&quot;. The station likened his program to &quot;a cruise . . . [through] his small but laughing world of Cajun friends and swamp critters . . . [such as] Maurice Mostique, the giant mosquito with a wingspan of 13¾ feet, [who] sings a pesky song while Ole Blue, the 738½ pound junk-collecting catfish, thumps against the boat as we float along the bayou&quot;.

In addition to showing classic Warner Bros. cartoons, the program had original skits and recurring characters. These cincluded T&#x27;Toot (a retired Indian fighter), the Crazy Professor (an inventor and graduate &quot;emeritus&quot; of the University of Pecan Island), Tante Baseline (owner of the Anse La Butte Swamp Gumbo factory), Joycie (a female filling station attendant &quot;who&#x27;s the world&#x27;s champion dual-wheel semi-trailer flat-tire fixer&quot;), The Headless Man (who &quot;sent his head out to be cleaned and it was accidentally sent to the Avery Island Pickle Factory instead&quot; and lived in the locked cabin of Polycarp&#x27;s boat), Doctor Rollingstone (&quot;the hipster swamp doctor who has a transistor radio stuck in his stethoscope), King Simon (&quot;the duly elected boss of the swamp&quot;) and the Stumblebum Sheriff (who arrived at the general store each morning and told jokes to Polycarp).

==Popularity==
KATC noted that, &quot;Polycarp&#x27;s much loved pals . . . [are] as familiar to the children of Acadiana as Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck&quot; and claimed that Polycarp was &quot;ranked as the top children&#x27;s TV personality in the state&quot;. As evidence of this popularity, Polycarp received over 3,000 letters and postcards from local children over a seven-day period during a fall 1967 Halloween costume giveaway promotion. In October that year, the University of Southwestern Louisiana&#x27;s Alumni Association, Athletic Association and its band named Polycarp the first &quot;Mr. Acadiana&quot;, an honor it bestowed annually during the school&#x27;s homecoming American football game to the USL alumnus who best &quot;fosters the tradition and the ideals of the school and of the area. . . .&quot;. (Plauché had graduated from the university in 1957.) By 1967, Polycarp appeared in Lafayette-area parades driving a restored 1935 International Harvester vegetable truck, dubbed by KATC the &quot;Poly-Car&quot; (a play on the Cajun French pronunciation of &quot;Polycarp&quot;).

In 1976, the producer J. D. &quot;Jay&quot; Miller of Crowley, Louisiana, issued a 45rpm record on his Yule Time record label of Polycarp reading &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot;.
==Theme song==
Polycarp&#x27;s eponymous theme song (rendered &quot;Polycarp Phillip Pecot #II&quot; on the 45rpm record label) was recorded in 1966 by the local swamp pop musician Johnnie Allan to the tune of The McCoys&#x27; 1965 Number 1 hit song &quot;Hang On Sloopy&quot;.

==Broadcast schedule==
In spring 1969, &quot;Polycarp and Pals&quot; was broadcast for one hour each weekday and Saturday beginning at 7am CST (although on some weekdays it ran for an hour and a half, ending at 8:30am). There is some evidence that a short-lived spin-off program, &quot;The Polycarp Palace&quot;, was broadcast on Tuesdays from 3:30 to 5:50pm beginning in October 1967.

<doc id="1285803" wikidata="Q131649" url="?curid=1285803" title="Corynebacterium diphtheriae">
<text>Corynebacterium diphtheriae is a Gram-positive pathogenic bacterium that causes diphtheria. It is also known as the Klebs–Löffler bacillus because it was discovered in 1884 by German bacteriologists Edwin Klebs (1834–1912) and Friedrich Löffler (1852–1915). These bacteria are usually harmless, unless they are infected by a bacteriophage carrying a gene which gives rise to a toxin. This toxin causes the disease. Diphtheria is caused by the adhesion and infiltration of the bacteria into the mucosal layers of the body, primarily affecting the respiratory tract and causing the subsequent release of an exotoxin. The toxin has a localized effect on skin lesions, as well as a metastatic, proteolytic effects on other organ systems in severe infections. Originally a major cause of childhood mortality, diphtheria has been almost entirely eradicated due to the vigorous administration of the diphtheria vaccination in the 1910s.

Diphtheria is no longer transmitted as frequently due to the development of the vaccine, DTaP. Although diphtheria outbreaks continue to occur, this is often in developing countries where the majority of the population is not vaccinated.

==Classification==
Four subspecies are recognized: &quot;C. d. mitis&quot;, &quot;C. d. intermedius&quot;, &quot;C. d. gravis&quot;, and &quot;C. d. belfanti&quot;. The four subspecies differ slightly in their colonial morphology and biochemical properties, such as the ability to metabolize certain nutrients. All may be either toxigenic (and therefore cause diphtheria) or not toxigenic.

Strain subtyping involves comparing species of bacteria and categorizing them into subspecies. Strain subtyping also helps with identifying the origin of a certain bacteria&#x27;s outbreak. However, when it comes to the subtyping of &quot;C. diphtheriae&quot;, there is not a lot of useful or accurate classification due to the lack of publicly available resources to identify strains and therefore find the origin of outbreaks.

==Toxin==
&quot;C. diphtheriae&quot; produces the diphtheria toxin which alters protein function in the host by inactivating the elongation factor EF-2. This causes pharyngitis and &#x27;pseudomembrane&#x27; in the throat. The strains that are toxigenic are ones which have been infected with a bacteriophage.

The diphtheria toxin gene is encoded by the bacteriophage found in toxigenic strains, integrated into the bacterial chromosome.

The diphtheria toxin repressor is mainly controlled by iron. It serves as the essential cofactor for the activation of target DNA binding. A
low concentration of iron is required in the medium for toxin production. At high iron concentrations, iron molecules bind to an aporepressor on the beta bacteriophage, which carries the &quot;Tox&quot; gene. When bound to iron, the aporepressor shuts down toxin production. Elek&#x27;s test for toxigenicity is used to determine whether the organism is able to produce the diphtheria toxin.

==Identification==
To identify &quot;C. diphtheriae&quot;, a Gram stain is performed to show Gram-positive, highly pleomorphic organisms often looking like Chinese letters. Stains such as Albert&#x27;s stain and Ponder&#x27;s stain are used to demonstrate the metachromatic granules formed in the polar regions. The granules are called polar granules, or volutin granules, known under the eponymous name Babes-Ernst granules after their inventors Paul Ernst and Victor Babes. An enrichment medium, such as Löffler&#x27;s medium, preferentially grows &quot;C. diphtheriae&quot;. After that, a differential plate known as tellurite agar, allows all &quot;Corynebacteria&quot; (including &quot;C. diphtheriae&quot;) to reduce tellurite to metallic tellurium. The tellurite reduction is colourimetrically indicated by brown colonies for most &quot;Cornyebacterium&quot; species or by a black halo around the &quot;C. diphtheriae&quot; colonies. The organism produces catalase but not urease, which differentiates it from &quot;Corynebacterium ulcerans&quot;. &quot;C. diphtheriae&quot; does not produce pyrazinamidase which differentiates from &quot;Corynebacterium striatum&quot; and &quot;Corynebacterium jeikeium&quot;.

== Pathogenicity ==
&quot;Corynebacterium diphtheriae&quot; is the bacterium that causes the disease called diphtheria. Bacteriophages introduce a gene into the bacterial cells that makes a strain toxigenic. The strains that are not infected with these viruses are harmless. &quot;C. diphtheriae&quot; is a rod-shaped, Gram-positive, non spore-forming, and nonmotile bacterium. &quot;C. diphtheriae&quot; has shown to exclusively infect humans. It is believed that humans may be the reservoir for this pathogen. However, there have been extremely rare cases in which &quot;C. diphtheriae&quot; has been found in animals. These infections were only toxigenic in two dogs and two horses.

The disease occurs primarily in tropical regions and developing countries. Immunocompromised individuals, poorly immunized adults, and unvaccinated children are at the greatest risk of contracting diphtheria. Mode of transmission is person-to-person contact via respiratory droplets (i.e., coughing or sneezing). Less commonly, it could also be passed by touching open sores or contaminated surfaces. During the typical course of disease, the body region most commonly affected is the upper respiratory system. A thick, grey coating accumulates in the nasopharyngeal region, making breathing and swallowing more difficult. The disease remains contagious for at least two weeks following the disappearance of symptoms but has been known to last for up to a month.

The most common routes of entry for &quot;C. diphtheriae&quot; are the nose, tonsils, and throat. Individuals suffering from the disease may experience sore throat, weakness, fever, and swollen glands. This could cause even more dangerous symptoms such as shortness of breath. If left untreated, diphtheria toxin may enter the bloodstream, causing damage to the kidneys, nerves, and heart. Extremely rare complications include suffocation and partial paralysis. A vaccine, DTaP, effectively prevents the disease and is mandatory in the United States for participation in public education and some professions (exceptions apply).

The first step of &quot;C. diphtheriae&quot; infection involves the toxigenic bacteria colonizing a mucosal layer. In young children, this typically occurs in the upper respiratory tract mucosa. In adults, the infection is limited mostly to the tonsillar region. Some unusual sites of infection include the heart, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and anterior areas of the mouth including the buccal mucosa, the lips, tongue, and the hard and soft palate. The bacteria have several virulence factors to help them localize on areas of the respiratory tract, many of which are yet to be fully understood as diphtheria does not affect many model hosts such as mice. One common virulence factor that has been studied &quot;in vitro&quot; is DIP0733, a multi-functional protein that has been shown to have a role in bacterial adhesion to host cells and fibrogen-binding qualities. In experiments with mutant strains of the &quot;C. diphtheriae&quot;, adhesion and epithelial infiltration decreased significantly. The ability to bind to extracellular matrices aids the bacteria in avoiding detection by the body&#x27;s immune system.

The diphtheritic lesion is often covered by a pseudomembrane composed of fibrin, bacterial cells, and inflammatory cells. Diphtheria toxin can be proteolytically cleaved into two fragments: an N-terminal fragment A (catalytic domain), and fragment B (transmembrane and receptor binding domain). Fragment A catalyzes the NAD+ -dependent ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. Fragment B binds to the cell surface receptor and facilitates the delivery of fragment A to the cytosol.

Once the bacteria have localized in one area, they start multiplying and create the inflammatory pseudomembrane. Individuals with faucial diphtheria typically have the pseudomembrane grow over the tonsil and accessory structures, uvula, soft palate, and possibly the nasopharyngeal area. In upper respiratory tract diphtheria, the pseudomembrane can grow on the pharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchi/bronchioles. The pseudomembrane starts off white in colour and then later becomes dirty-grey and tough due to the necrotic epithelium.

Pseudomembrane formation on the trachea or bronchi will decrease the efficiency of airflow. Over time, the diffusion rate in the alveoli decreases due to the lower airflow and decreases the partial pressure of oxygen in the systemic circulation, which can cause cyanosis and suffocation.

==Transmission==
Mode of transmission is person-to-person contact via respiratory droplets (i.e., coughing or sneezing), and less commonly, by touching open sores or contaminated surfaces.

==Vaccine==
A vaccine, DTaP, effectively prevents the disease and is mandatory in the United States for participation in public education and some professions (exceptions apply).

The invention of the toxoid vaccine, which provides protection against &quot;Corynebacterium diphtheriae&quot;, caused a dramatic shift in the bacterium&#x27;s rate of infection in the United States. Even though the vaccine was first made in the early 1800s, it did not become widely available until the early 1910s. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), &quot;80 per cent of persons age 12 to 19 years were immune to diphtheria&quot; due to the wide use of the vaccine in the United States.

== Diagnosis ==

Diagnosis of respiratory &quot;C. diphtheriae&quot; is made based on presentation clinically, whereas non-respiratory diphtheria may not be clinically suspected therefore laboratory testing is more reliant. Culturing is the most accurate kind of testing that will confirm or deny the prevalence of diphtheria toxins. The testing is done by swabbing the possibly infected area, as well as any lesions and sores.

== Treatment and prevention ==

When a toxigenic strain of &quot;Corynebacterium diphtheriae&quot; infects the human body, it releases harmful toxins, especially to the throat. Antitoxins are used to prevent further harm. Antibiotics are also used to fight the infection. Typical antibiotics that are used against diphtheria involve penicillin or erythromycin. People infected with diphtheria must quarantine for at least 48 hours after being prescribed antibiotics. To confirm that the person is no longer contagious, tests are performed ensure that the bacteria have been cleared. People are then vaccinated prevent further transmission of the disease.

The wide use of the diphtheria vaccine dramatically decreased the rate of infection and allows for primary prevention of the disease. Most people receive a 3-in-1 vaccine that consists of protection against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, which is commonly known as the DTaP or Tdap vaccine. DTaP vaccine is for children while the Tdap vaccine is known for adolescents and adults.

In the United States, the DTaP vaccine to parents of infants which typically involves a series of five shots is recommended. These vaccines are injected through the arm or thigh and are administered when the infant is 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15–18 months and then 4–6 years old.

Possible side events that are associated with the diphtheria vaccine include &quot;mild fever, fussiness, drowsiness or tenderness at the injection site&quot;. Although it is rare, the DTaP vaccine may cause an allergic reaction that causes hives or a rash to breakout within minutes of administering the vaccine.

==Genetics==
The genome of &quot;C. diphtheriae&quot; consists of a single circular chromosome of 2.5 Mbp, with no plasmids. Its genome shows an extreme compositional bias, being noticeably higher in G+C near the origin than at the terminus.

The &quot;Corynebacterium diphtheriae&quot; genome is a single circular chromosome that has no plasmids. These chromosomes have a high G+C content which is what contributes to their high genetic diversity. The high content of guanine and cytosine is not constant across the entire genome of the bacteria. There is a terminus of replication around the ~740kb region that causes a decrease in the G+C content. In other bacteria, it is often seen that the G+C content gets smaller near the terminus, but &quot;C. diphtheriae&quot; is a considerably strong genome that has this occurrence. Chromosomal replication is one of the ways this happens within this genome.

<doc id="1285805" wikidata="Q2928741" url="?curid=1285805" title="Fat Man and Little Boy (The Simpsons)">
<text>&quot;Fat Man and Little Boy&quot; is the fifth episode of the sixteenth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 12, 2004. The episode was directed by Mike B. Anderson and written by Joel H. Cohen.

In this episode, Bart makes money selling T-shirts, so a jealous Homer decides to support Lisa&#x27;s science fair project. Eric Idle guest starred as Declan Desmond. The episode received mixed reviews.

==Plot==
After losing his last baby tooth, Bart does not enjoy playing with his toys anymore and feels that he is maturing. To get out of his depression and express his emotions, Bart writes sarcastic and insulting phrases on his T-shirts. The shirts make him popular in town, and Bart sets up a stand in front of his house selling them. His business is shut down for not having a vending license, and he goes to a retailer&#x27;s convention to obtain one. While leaving, he meets Goose Gladwell, a Willy Wonka-type salesman who sells joke products. Bart agrees to sell his shirts at Gladwell&#x27;s stores, which turn in a considerable profit. When Homer is caught wearing one of Bart&#x27;s shirts whilst sleeping on the job at the power plant, he is suspended without pay, and decides to quit since Bart is making so much money from t-shirt sales.

Fearing that Bart has replaced him, Homer decides to nurture Lisa. They quickly bond, and Homer sees her entry for the science fair: a history of nuclear physics and a scale model of the first nuclear reactor. However, Martin shows them his project, a childlike robot. Homer helps Lisa ensure her project&#x27;s victory by stealing plutonium from the power plant and using it to make her reactor fully operational. He shows it to Lisa, she is horrified when she discovers it is dangerous, and alerts Marge, who tells Homer to get rid of it.

Meanwhile, Bart learns that Gladwell has sold the rights to the shirts to Disney under a contract that allows him to stop paying Bart. Homer stands up for Bart by threatening to detonate his nuclear reactor and destroy Gladwell&#x27;s store. Gladwell accepts defeat, giving Bart and Homer all the money he has. As they leave, Bart thanks Homer for straightening things out. Happy to be back to their respective roles as father and son, Homer and Bart go to the dump to dispose of the nuclear reactor together.

==Cultural references==
The title of the episode references the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki: &quot;Fat Man&quot; is the name of the bomb dropped on Nagasaki, and &quot;Little Boy&quot; was the one dropped on Hiroshima. At the start of the episode, Lisa and Janey sing &quot;Miss Susie.&quot; Bart finds that the Tooth Fairy has donated in his name to the United Way of America, rather than giving him a quarter. The toys that Bart disposes of are based on Spirograph, Etch A Sketch, &quot;Hungry Hungry Hippos&quot;, &quot;Monopoly&quot;, &quot;Parcheesi&quot;, Silly Putty, and Rock &#x27;Em Sock &#x27;Em Robots. He gives his toys a Viking funeral, and the Sea Captain quotes Robert Frost&#x27;s poem &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot;. Marge and Homer list &quot;support our troops&quot; and &quot;Keep On Truckin&#x27;&quot; as examples of T-shirt slogans. Moe asks if Bart has any T-shirts with &quot;Calvin peeing on Hobbes.&quot; This references the newspaper comic &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;, and a series of bootleg stickers depicting Calvin urinating on various logos and symbols. The designs on Krusty&#x27;s T-shirt line include Itchy dressed as Austin Powers, SpongeBob SquarePants, and a Confederate, and Scratchy modeled after Osama bin Laden. Lisa&#x27;s model of science history contains displays of scientists Marie Curie, Wilhelm Röntgen, and Albert Einstein. Goose Gladwell looks similar to Willy Wonka from &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, and he sells the rights to Bart&#x27;s shirts to The Walt Disney Company.

The episode features various real-life songs. &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot; by Kansas plays as Bart carries his toys to the ocean, and &quot;I&#x27;m Too Sexy&quot; by Right Said Fred is heard over a montage of Bart walking around town with his shirts. The introduction to Krusty&#x27;s T-shirt display is accompanied by &quot;Get Ready for This&quot; by 2 Unlimited. Gladwell&#x27;s car horn is a variation of &quot;La Cucaracha.&quot; &quot;The Pink Panther Theme&quot; is set to a scene of Homer sneaking into the power plant.

===Critical response===
&quot;ReviewStream&quot; wrote that &quot;only the Simpsons can combine a Willy Wonka look-a-like[&quot;sic&quot;], a Robert Frost poem, and a Viking funeral all into one episode.&quot;

Colin Jacobson of &quot;DVD Movie Guide&quot; liked the beginning with Bart selling T-shirts but did not enjoy the episode becoming a Willy Wonka parody.

On &quot;Four Finger Discount&quot;, Guy Davis and Brendan Dando liked the episode. They enjoyed the &quot;potent&quot; idea of Bart growing up and being a provider and liked that Homer supported him in the end.

<text>Andre Lloyd Miller (born March 19, 1976) is an American former professional basketball player and the current head coach for the Grand Rapids Gold. Miller has played professional basketball for the Cleveland Cavaliers, Los Angeles Clippers, Philadelphia 76ers, Portland Trail Blazers, Denver Nuggets, Washington Wizards, Sacramento Kings, Minnesota Timberwolves and San Antonio Spurs. Currently, he ranks eleventh all-time in NBA career assists and only missed three games to injury in his 17-year career.

He is the only player in NBA history to have at least 16,000 career points, 8,000 assists and 1,500 steals without making an NBA All-Star Game.

==High school career==
Miller played high school basketball at Verbum Dei in Los Angeles where during his time there, the team found great success under coach Mike Kearney.

==College career==
Miller played college basketball at the University of Utah. He became a starter at point guard early in his freshman season, and remained a team leader throughout his career at the school. In 1997, following the graduation of Keith Van Horn, Miller and Michael Doleac took charge of the team, and they led the Runnin&#x27; Utes to the championship game of the 1998 Final Four. It was during that tournament run that Miller gained national attention.

Utah faced Arizona in the West Regional finals. The Wildcats were defending national champions and the top seed in the region, and thus were heavily favored over the Utes. Arizona boasted an All-American guard line of Mike Bibby, Miles Simon, and Jason Terry, but Miller wasn&#x27;t intimidated. He single-handedly dominated the Wildcats, totaling 18 points, 14 rebounds, and 13 assists in the game. It was just the fourth triple-double in the recorded history of the NCAA tournament. Utah won in a rout, 76–51.

With Miller leading the way, the Utes continued their surprising run all the way to the title game, where they ultimately lost to Kentucky 78–69. Miller was a national star during his senior season (1999), earning First Team All-America honors from the Associated Press, the NABC, the Sporting News, and USBWA. Also, he was named Player of the Year in the Western Athletic Conference (WAC), in addition to First Team All-WAC and WAC All-Defensive Team honors.

Miller averaged 12.1 points, 5.4 assists and 4.8 rebounds per game over his four-year collegiate career at Utah. He also finished his career as Utah&#x27;s all-time leader in steals (254) and second in all-time assists (721). He graduated in 1999 and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Sociology.

==Professional career==

===Cleveland Cavaliers (1999–2002)===
Miller was drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the eighth overall pick in the 1999 NBA draft. He averaged 11.1 points and 5.8 assists per game in his rookie year. In his second year, he averaged 15.8 points per game and 8 assists per game. In his final year as a Cavalier, his averages increased to 16.5 points and 10.8 assists per game. That season, on February 28, 2002, Miller set a then career high of 37 points scored during a 114–107 victory against the San Antonio Spurs. During his career as a Cavalier, he was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team, became the first player in Cleveland history to win player of the week twice, set a franchise record for total assists in a season (882), and was the only NBA player to average 10+ assists and points during the 2001–02 NBA season. He also played for the United States national team in the 2002 FIBA World Championship.

===Los Angeles Clippers (2002–2003)===
On July 30, 2002, Miller was traded, along with Bryant Stith, to the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Darius Miles and Harold Jamison. He averaged 13.6 points, 6.7 assists, 4.0 rebounds and 1.24 steals in 80 games for the Clippers in 2002–03. He ranked ninth in the NBA in assists and led the Clippers in games played, games started (80) and minutes played (2,913).

===Denver Nuggets (2003–2006)===
On August 1, 2003, Miller signed a six-year deal with the Denver Nuggets. In his first season in Denver he averaged 15.8 points and 6.1 assists, along with 4.5 rebounds and a career-high 1.7 steals per game. They made the playoffs but the Nuggets were eliminated in the first round 4 games to 1 by the Minnesota Timberwolves. In the 2004–05 he averaged 13.6 points, 6.9 assists, 4.1 rebounds, and 1.5 steals in 82 games. In the playoffs after winning game one in San Antonio, the Nuggets proceeded to lose the next four games and lost the series 4–1. In his last full season with the Nuggets his averages would go down. With his 13.7 points, 8.2 assists, 4.3 rebounds, and 1.3 steals he helped the team to win the Northwest division. They lost to the Los Angeles Clippers in 5 games.

On December 19, 2006, Miller was traded by the Nuggets to the Philadelphia 76ers as part of a trade for guard Allen Iverson.

Miller&#x27;s statistics went up in multiple categories; in 2006–07, Miller ranked fourth in the NBA in total assists (625) and seventh in assists per game (7.8), and also ranked 20th in steals per game (1.38) and 15th in assist to turnover ratio (2.82). He recorded 19 double-doubles in 2006–07 (148 for his career), and the Sixers were 7–5 in games in which he had a double-double and 17–8 when he scored 15+ points. He finished the final 35 games in 2006–07, shot 47.7% from the floor and 82.4% shooting from the line after shooting 44.5% FGs and 74.8% FTs in his first 22 games as a Sixer.

Miller tied his playoff career high of 31 points in a first-round opening win against the Phoenix Suns on April 18, 2010.

In December 2010, Miller&#x27;s streak of 632 straight games ended because of a suspension for a game after shoving Clippers player Blake Griffin. The shove was missed by the refs and not called as a foul during the game with the suspension handed after review.

===Return to the Nuggets (2011–2014)===
During the 2011 NBA draft on June 23, 2011, Miller was involved in a trade sending him to the Nuggets along with the rights to #26 draft pick Jordan Hamilton in exchange for Raymond Felton.

<doc id="1285813" wikidata="Q133976" url="?curid=1285813" title="Corynebacterium">
<text>Corynebacterium () is a genus of Gram-positive bacteria and most are aerobic. They are bacilli (rod-shaped), and in some phases of life they are, more specifically, club-shaped, which inspired the genus name (&quot;coryneform&quot; means &quot;club-shaped&quot;).

They are widely distributed in nature in the microbiota of animals (including the human microbiota) and are mostly innocuous, most commonly existing in commensal relationships with their hosts. Some, such as &quot;C. glutamicum&quot;, are commercially and industrially useful. Others can cause human disease, including, most notably, diphtheria, which is caused by &quot;C. diphtheriae&quot;. Like various species of microbiota (including their relatives in the genera &quot;Arcanobacterium&quot; and &quot;Trueperella&quot;), they are usually not pathogenic, but can occasionally capitalize opportunistically on atypical access to tissues (via wounds) or weakened host defenses.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus &quot;Corynebacterium&quot; was created by Lehmann and Neumann in 1896 as a taxonomic group to contain the bacterial rods responsible for causing diphtheria. The genus was defined based on morphological characteristics. Based on studies of 16S rRNA, they have been grouped into the subdivision of Gram-positive Eubacteria with high G:C content, with close phylogenetic relationships to &quot;Arthrobacter&quot;, &quot;Mycobacterium&quot;, &quot;Nocardia&quot;, and &quot;Streptomyces&quot;.

The term comes from Greek κορύνη, &#x27; &#x27;club, mace, staff, knobby plant bud or shoot&#x27; and βακτήριον, &#x27; &#x27;little rod&#x27;. The term &quot;diphtheroids&quot; is used to represent corynebacteria that are nonpathogenic; for example, &quot;C. diphtheriae&quot; would be excluded. The term diphtheroid comes from Greek διφθέρα, &quot;&quot; &#x27;prepared hide, leather&#x27;.

==Genomics==
Comparative analysis of corynebacterial genomes has led to the identification of several conserved signature indels (CSIs) that are unique to the genus. Two examples of CSIs are a two-amino-acid insertion in a conserved region of the enzyme phosphoribose diphosphate:decaprenyl-phosphate phosphoribosyltransferase and a three-amino-acid insertion in acetate kinase, both of which are found only in &quot;Corynebacterium&quot; species. Both of these indels serve as molecular markers for species of the genus &quot;Corynebacterium&quot;. Additionally, 16 conserved signature proteins, which are uniquely found in &quot;Corynebacterium&quot; species, have been identified. Three of these have homologs found in the genus &quot;Dietzia&quot;, which is believed to be the closest related genus to &quot;Corynebacterium&quot;. In phylogenetic trees based on concatenated protein sequences or 16S rRNA, the genus &quot;Corynebacterium&quot; forms a distinct clade, within which is a distinct subclade, cluster I. The cluster is made up of the species &quot;C. diphtheriae, C. pseudotuberculosis, C. ulcerans, C. aurimucosum, C. glutamicum,&quot; and &quot;C. efficiens&quot;. This cluster is distinguished by several conserved signature indels, such as a two-amino-acid insertion in LepA and a seven- or eight-amino-acid insertions in RpoC. Also, 21 conserved signature proteins are found only in members of cluster I. Another cluster has been proposed, consisting of &quot;C. jeikeium&quot; and &quot;C. urealyticum&quot;, which is supported by the presence of 19 distinct conserved signature proteins which are unique to these two species. Corynebacteria have a high G+C content ranging from 46-74 mol%.

== Characteristics ==
The principal features of the genus &quot;Corynebacterium&quot; were described by Collins and Cummins, for Coryn Taylor in 1986. They are gram-positive, catalase-positive, non-spore-forming, non-motile, rod-shaped bacteria that are straight or slightly curved. Metachromatic granules are usually present representing stored phosphate regions. Their size falls between 2 and 6 μm in length and 0.5 μm in diameter. The bacteria group together in a characteristic way, which has been described as the form of a &quot;V&quot;, &quot;palisades&quot;, or &quot;Chinese characters&quot;. They may also appear elliptical. They are aerobic or facultatively anaerobic, chemoorganotrophs. They are pleomorphic through their lifecycles, they occur in various lengths, and they frequently have thickenings at either end, depending on the surrounding conditions.

Some corynebacteria are lipophilic (such as CDC coryneform groups F-1 and G, &quot;C. accolens&quot;, &quot;C. afermentans&quot; subsp. &quot;lipophilum&quot;, &quot;C. bovis&quot;, &quot;C. jeikeium&quot;, &quot;C. macginleyi&quot;, &quot;C. uropygiale&quot;, and &quot;C. urealyticum&quot;), but medically relevant corynebacteria are typically not. The nonlipophilic bacteria may be classified as fermentative (such as &quot;C. amycolatum&quot;; &quot;C. argentoratense&quot;, members of the &quot;C. diphtheriae&quot; group, &quot;C. glucuronolyticum&quot;, &quot;C. glutamicum&quot;, &quot;C. matruchotii&quot;, &quot;C. minutissimum&quot;, &quot;C. striatum&quot;, and &quot;C. xerosis&quot;) or nonfermentative (such as &quot;C. afermentans&quot; subsp. &quot;afermentans&quot;, &quot;C. auris&quot;, &quot;C. pseudodiphtheriticum&quot;, and &quot;C. propinquum&quot;).

=== Cell wall ===
The cell wall is distinctive, with a predominance of mesodiaminopimelic acid in the murein wall and many repetitions of arabinogalactan, as well as corynemycolic acid (a mycolic acid with 22 to 26 carbon atoms), bound by disaccharide bonds called L-Rha&quot;p&quot;-(1 → 4)--D-GlcNAc-phosphate. These form a complex commonly seen in &quot;Corynebacterium&quot; species: the mycolyl-AG–peptidoglican (mAGP). Unlike most corynebacteria, &quot;Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii&quot; does not contain mycolic acids.

=== Culture ===
Corynebacteria grow slowly, even on enriched media. In nutritional requirements, all need biotin to grow. Some strains also need thiamine and PABA. Some of the &quot;Corynebacterium&quot; species with sequenced genomes have between 2.5 and 3.0 million base pairs. The bacteria grow in Loeffler&#x27;s medium, blood agar, and trypticase soy agar (TSA). They form small, grayish colonies with a granular appearance, mostly translucent, but with opaque centers, convex, with continuous borders. The color tends to be yellowish-white in Loeffler&#x27;s medium. In TSA, they can form grey colonies with black centers and dentated borders that either resemble flowers (&quot;C. gravis&quot;), continuous borders (&quot;C. mitis&quot;), or a mix between the two forms (&quot;C. intermedium&quot;).

== Habitat ==
&quot;Corynebacterium&quot; species occur commonly in nature in soil, water, plants, and food products. The non-diphtheroid &quot;Corynebacterium&quot; species can even be found in the mucosa and normal skin flora of humans and animals. Unusual habitats, such as the preen gland of birds, have been recently reported for &quot;Corynebacterium uropygiale&quot;. Some species are known for their pathogenic effects in humans and other animals. Perhaps the most notable one is &quot;C. diphtheriae&quot;, which acquires the capacity to produce diphtheria toxin only after interacting with a bacteriophage. Other pathogenic species in humans include: &quot;C. amycolatum&quot;, &quot;C. striatum&quot;, &quot;C. jeikeium&quot;, &quot;C. urealyticum&quot;, and &quot;C. xerosis&quot;; all of these are important as pathogens in immunosuppressed patients. Pathogenic species in other animals include &quot;C. bovis&quot; and &quot;C. renale&quot;. This genus has been found to be part of the human salivary microbiome.

==Role in disease==

The most notable human infection is diphtheria, caused by &quot;C. diphtheriae&quot;. It is an acute, contagious infection characterized by pseudomembranes of dead epithelial cells, white blood cells, red blood cells, and fibrin that form around the tonsils and back of the throat. In developed countries, it is an uncommon illness that tends to occur in unvaccinated individuals, especially school-aged children, elderly, neutropenic or immunocompromised patients, and those with prosthetic devices such as prosthetic heart valves, shunts, or catheters. It is more common in developing countries It can occasionally infect wounds, the vulva, the conjunctiva, and the middle ear. It can be spread within a hospital. The virulent and toxigenic strains produce an exotoxin formed by two polypeptide chains, which is itself produced when a bacterium is transformed by a gene from the β prophage.

Several species cause disease in animals, most notably &quot;C. pseudotuberculosis&quot;, which causes the disease caseous lymphadenitis, and some are also pathogenic in humans. Some attack healthy hosts, while others tend to attack the immunocompromised. Effects of infection include granulomatous lymphadenopathy, pneumonitis, pharyngitis, skin infections, and endocarditis. Corynebacterial endocarditis is seen most frequently in patients with intravascular devices. Several species of &quot;Corynebacterium&quot; can cause trichomycosis axillaris. &quot;C. striatum&quot; may cause axillary odor. &quot;C. minutissimum&quot; causes erythrasma.

==Industrial uses==
Nonpathogenic species of &quot;Corynebacterium&quot; are used for important industrial applications, such as the production of amino acids and nucleotides, bioconversion of steroids, degradation of hydrocarbons, cheese aging, and production of enzymes. Some species produce metabolites similar to antibiotics: bacteriocins of the corynecin-linocin type, antitumor agents, etc. One of the most studied species is &quot;C. glutamicum&quot;, whose name refers to its capacity to produce glutamic acid in aerobic conditions.

L-Lysine production is specific to &quot;C. glutamicum&quot; in which core metabolic enzymes are manipulated through genetic engineering to drive metabolic flux towards the production of NADPH from the pentose phosphate pathway, and L-4-aspartyl phosphate, the commitment step to the synthesis of L-lysine, lysC, , , and . These enzymes are up-regulated in industry through genetic engineering to ensure adequate amounts of lysine precursors are produced to increase metabolic flux. Unwanted side reactions such as threonine and asparagine production can occur if a buildup of intermediates occurs, so scientists have developed mutant strains of&quot; C. glutamicum&quot; through PCR engineering and chemical knockouts to ensure production of side-reaction enzymes are limited. Many genetic manipulations conducted in industry are by traditional cross-over methods or inhibition of transcriptional activators.

Expression of functionally active human epidermal growth factor has been brought about in &quot;C. glutamicum&quot;, thus demonstrating a potential for industrial-scale production of human proteins. Expressed proteins can be targeted for secretion through either the general secretory pathway or the twin-arginine translocation pathway.

Unlike gram-negative bacteria, the gram-positive &quot;Corynebacterium&quot; species lack lipopolysaccharides that function as antigenic endotoxins in humans.

<text>The name Rea Brook can refer to either of two brooks in Shropshire, England.

One of the brooks, which eventually becomes the River Rea, is in southern Shropshire. It is to the east of Brown Clee Hill.

The other, described here, is a minor river that begins at Marton Pool, near the Wales-England border. This runs northeast for past the villages of Minsterley, Pontesbury, Hanwood, Hook-a-Gate and Bayston Hill to Shrewsbury, where it joins the much larger River Severn at Coleham Head. It is noted in the county for its wildlife, such as otters and kingfishers.

==Names and etymology==
The pronunciation of &quot;Rea&quot; varies between and . The pronunciation most used by locals for the Shrewsbury river is ; the pronunciation may have been introduced by incomers from Birmingham, where a different River Rea is pronounced that way. The spelling of the brook&#x27;s name also varies between &quot;Rea Brook&quot; and &quot;Reabrook&quot;. The former form is used by Natural England and on Ordinance Survey maps. The latter spelling is from Shropshire Council&#x27;s own webpage about Rea Brook Valley.

Previously in history, the Rea Brook was known as the &quot;Meole Brook&quot;, and gives its name to two villages near Shrewsbury – Meole Brace and Cruckmeole. There are two competing etymologies for the name of the brook. One is that it is simply the Old English word (&quot;meal, flour&quot;), supposedly given because of the brook&#x27;s cloudy colour. In this interpretation, the brook then gave its name to Crucmeole, whose first element would be the Old English word (&quot;cruck-framed building&quot;), and whose name would thus originally have meant &quot;cruck-framed building on the Meole Brook&quot;. Alternatively, the name of Cruckmeole could come from the Common Brittonic words found today in modern Welsh as (&quot;hillock&quot;) and (&quot;bare&quot;). In this interpretation, the name of the settlement once meant &quot;bare hillock&quot;. When the dominant language of the area became English, English-speakers, no longer understanding the name, imagined that the name of the settlement came from the brook, and called the brook &quot;Meole Brook&quot; accordingly by folk-etymology.

==Characteristics==
Rea Brook has changed dramatically since the start of the 21st century with a downturn in the recorded numbers of coarse fish. The Environment Agency put this down to the brook changing from a high capacity watercourse into a fast flowing one. It has been noted that the brook is still plentiful with salmonid type fish.

When the brook reaches Shrewsbury, it flows through a local nature reserve designated in 1994 as the Reabrook Valley Country Park. The valley is noted for its wildlife, specifically otters and orchids that are rare in that part of Shropshire. In its final reaches it curves westwards to its confluence with the River Severn just off Coleham Head in the town. The brook flooded extensively in 2000, 2007 and 2010. 

After the flooding in 2000, it was suggested that a tunnel and culvert be created to divert water away from Rea Brook eastwards where it would enter the River Severn a point further downstream and out of the environs of Shrewsbury. As the cost of this work would have exhausted the funds put aside for flood defences in the town, it was discounted. 

The 2007 flooding destroyed a bridge which was rebuilt in 2008 with additional archaeological excavations on the leat that ran alongside the Rea Brook in the valley at Shrewsbury. The leat (or mill race) had existed since the medieval period, and was disused at the time of the flooding. The bridge repairs necessitated diverting the Rea Brook into the former leat.

<text>Alicia Suskin Ostriker (born November 11, 1937) is an American poet and scholar who writes Jewish feminist poetry. 
She was called &quot;America&#x27;s most fiercely honest poet&quot; by &quot;Progressive&quot;. Additionally, she was one of the first women poets in America to write and publish poems discussing the topic of motherhood. In 2015, she was elected a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets. In 2018, she was named the New York State Poet Laureate.

==Personal life and education==
Ostriker was born in Brooklyn, New York, to David Suskin and Beatrice Linnick Suskin. She grew up in the Manhattan housing projects during the Great Depression. Her father worked for New York City Parks Department. Her mother read her William Shakespeare and Robert Browning, and Alicia began writing poems, as well as drawing, from an early age. Initially, she had hoped to be an artist and studied art as a teenager. Her books, &quot;Songs&quot; (1969) and &quot;A Dream of Springtime&quot; (1979), spotlight her own illustrations. Ostriker went to high school at Ethical Culture Fieldston School in 1955.

She holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Brandeis University (1959), and an M.A. (1961) and Ph.D. (1964) from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. In Ostriker&#x27;s first year of graduate school, she attended a conference where a visiting professor commented on her poetry by saying, &quot;&#x27;You women poets are very graphic, aren&#x27;t you?&#x27;&quot; This comment caused her to reflect on the meaning of being a woman poet. She had never thought of that term before and she realized that men were uncomfortable when women wrote about their own bodies. This encounter became a defining moment in her life and from that moment on, she wrote poems discussing the various facets of a woman: sexuality, motherhood, pregnancy, and mortality. On the other hand, her doctoral dissertation, on the work of William Blake, became her first book, &quot;Vision and Verse in William Blake&quot; (1965). Later, she edited and annotated Blake&#x27;s complete poems for Penguin Press.

She is married to astronomer Jeremiah P. Ostriker, who taught at Princeton University (1971–2001). They have three children: Rebecca (1963), Eve (1965), and Gabriel (1970). She has been a resident of Princeton, New Jersey.

==Career and work==
She began her teaching career at Rutgers University in 1965 and has served as an English professor until she retired in 2004. Ostriker decided to pursue a career while also taking care of her children which was very uncommon during this time. Ostriker&#x27;s ambition, desire to live a life different from her mother&#x27;s, and her husband&#x27;s refusal to let her become a housewife influenced her to make that choice. In 1969, her first collection of poems, &quot;Songs&quot;, was published by Holt, Rinehart and Winston. This collection contained poems that she wrote while she was still a student. Her poems reflect the influence poets such as Gerard Manley Hopkins, John Keats, W.H. Auden, William Blake, and Walt Whitman have had on her and her poetry.

Her second collection of poems published was &quot;Once More Out of Darkness.&quot; Majority of the poems were written in free verse. While she was writing this collection of poems, Ostriker became aware of her feminist views. The poems that compose this collection were based on her first two experiences of pregnancy and childbirth as she had her first two children 18 months apart. Discussing these topics in her poems made her cognizant of the fact that she had not previously read poems about these topics and that she was breaking a taboo. Her third volume of poems, &quot;A Dream of Springtime,&quot; had poems that demonstrated her growth by discussing her emerging from her past and discovering herself and her identity.

Her fourth book of poems, &quot;The Mother/Child Papers&quot; (1980), a feminist classic, was inspired by the birth of her son during the Vietnam War and weeks after the Kent State shootings. Throughout, she juxtaposes musings about motherhood with musings about war. She also discusses her husband and her other two children in her poems. This collection allowed her to explore her identity as a woman by examining her role as a mother, wife, and professor. It did take her ten years to write the poems that make up this collection as she gained more inspiration from events that were happening in society such as the American Feminist movement.
Ostriker&#x27;s books of nonfiction explore many of the same themes manifest in her verse. They include &quot;Writing Like a Woman&quot; (1983), which explores the poems of Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, H.D., May Swenson and Adrienne Rich, and &quot;The Nakedness of the Fathers: Biblical Visions and Revisions&quot; (1994), which approaches the Torah with a midrashic sensibility. She wrote the introduction to Giannina Braschi&#x27;s &quot;Empire of Dreams&quot;, a postmodern poetry classic of the Spanish Caribbean (1994).

Ostriker&#x27;s sixth collection of poems, &quot;The Imaginary Lover&quot; (1986), won the William Carlos Williams Award of the Poetry Society of America. The poems included in this collection had a feminist voice, probably due to fact that at the same time, she was doing research for her second feminist criticism book, &quot;Stealing the Language: the Emergence of Women Poets in America&quot;. In &quot;The Imaginary Lover&quot;, Ostriker examines the fantasies associated with womanhood by discussing topics such as mother-daughter relationships and marriage. &quot;The Crack in Everything&quot; (1996) was a National Book Award finalist, and won the Paterson Poetry Award and the San Francisco State Poetry Center Award. &quot;The Little Space: Poems Selected and New, 1968–1998&quot; was also a 1998 National Book Award finalist.

&quot;Green Age&quot; (1989) was Ostriker&#x27;s most visionary and successful collection of poems. Themes analyzed in this collection was time, history and politics, and inner spirituality and how these helped her heal. Ostriker highlights how there is a lack of feminist spirituality in traditional religions.

Ostriker&#x27;s most recent nonfiction book is &quot;For the Love of God&quot; (2007), a work that continues her midrash exploration of biblical texts begun with &quot;Feminist Revision and the Bible&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Nakedness of the Fathers: Biblical Visions and Revisions&quot; (1994). &quot;Dancing at the Devil&#x27;s Party&quot; (2000) examines the work of poets from William Blake and Walt Whitman to Maxine Kumin. Early in the introduction to the book, she disagrees with W. H. Auden&#x27;s assertion that poetry makes nothing happen. Poetry, Ostriker writes, &quot;can tear at the heart with its claws, make the neural nets shiver, flood us with hope, despair, longing, ecstasy, love, anger, terror&quot;.

Ostriker&#x27;s poems have appeared in a wide variety of periodicals, including &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;Poetry&quot;, &quot;American Poetry Review&quot;, &quot;Paris Review&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;Yale Review&quot;, &quot;Kenyon Review&quot;, &quot;Iowa Review&quot;, &quot;Shenandoah Review&quot;, &quot;Antaeus&quot;, &quot;Colorado Review&quot;, &quot;Denver Quarterly&quot;, &quot;Boulevard&quot;, &quot;Poetry East&quot;, &quot;New England Review&quot;, &quot;Santa Monica Review&quot;, &quot;Triquarterly Review&quot;, &quot;Seneca Review&quot;, &quot;Ms.&quot;, &quot;Ontario Review&quot;, &quot;Bridges&quot;, &quot;Tikkun&quot;, &quot;Prairie Schooner&quot;, &quot;Gettysburg Review&quot;, &quot;Lyric&quot;, &quot;Fence&quot;, and &quot;Ploughshares&quot;.

A variety of Ostriker&#x27;s poems have been translated into Italian, French, German, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Hebrew and Arabic. Stealing the Language has been translated into Japanese and published in Japan. Her fifty-year poetry career is the subject of a collection of essays by American poets and feminist literary scholars, entitled &quot;Every Woman Her Own Theology&quot;.

<text>Steam distillation is a separation process that consists of distilling water together with other volatile and non-volatile components. The steam from the boiling water carries the vapor of the volatiles to a condenser; both are cooled and return to the liquid or solid state, while the non-volatile residues remain behind in the boiling container. 

If, as is usually the case, the volatiles are not miscible with water, they will spontaneously form a distinct phase after condensation, allowing them to be separated by decantation or with a separatory funnel. 

Steam distillation can be used when the boiling point of the substance to be extracted is higher than that of water, and the starting material cannot be heated to that temperature because of decomposition or other unwanted reactions. It may also be useful when the amount of the desired substance is small compared to that of the non-volatile residues. It is often used to separate volatile essential oils from plant material. for example, to extract limonene (boiling point 176 °C) from orange peels. 

Steam distillation once was a popular laboratory method for purification of organic compounds, but it has been replaced in many such uses by vacuum distillation and supercritical fluid extraction. It is however much simpler and economical than those alternatives, and remains important in certain industrial sectors.

In the simplest form, water distillation or hydrodistillation, the water is mixed with the starting material in the boiling container. In direct steam distillation, the starting material is suspended above the water in the boiling flask, supported by a metal mesh or perforated screen. In dry steam distillation, the steam from a boiler is forced to flow through the starting material in a separate container. The latter variant allows the steam to be heated above the boiling point of water (thus becoming superheated steam), for more efficient extraction.

== History ==

Steam distillation is used in many of the recipes given in the (&#x27;Book of Gentleness on Perfume&#x27;), also known as the (&#x27;Book of the Chemistry of Perfume and Distillations&#x27;), attributed to the early Arabic philosopher al-Kindi (–873). Steam distillation was also used by the Persian philosopher and physician Avicenna (980–1037) to produce essential oils by adding water to rose petals and distilling the mixture. The process was also used by al-Dimashqi (1256–1327) to produce rose water on a large scale.

==Principle==
Every substance has some vapor pressure even below its boiling point, so in theory it could be distilled at any temperature by collecting and condensing its vapors. However, ordinary distillation below the boiling point is not practical because a layer of vapor-rich air would form over the liquid, and evaporation would stop as soon as the partial pressure of the vapor in that layer reached the vapor pressure. The vapor would then flow to the condenser only by diffusion, which is an extremely slow process.

Simple distillation is generally done by boiling the starting material, because, once its vapor pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure, that still vapor-rich layer of air will be disrupted, and there will be a significant and steady flow of vapor from the boiling flask to the condenser. 

In steam distillation, that positive flow is provided by steam from boiling water, rather than by the boiling of the substances of interest. The steam carries with it the vapors of the latter.

The substance of interest does not need to be miscible water or soluble in it. It suffices that it has significant vapor pressure at the steam&#x27;s temperature.

If the water forms an azeotrope with the substances of interest, the boiling point of the mixture may be lower than the boiling point of water. For example, bromobenzene boils at 156 °C (at normal atmospheric pressure), but a mixture with water boils at 95 °C. However, the formation of an azeotrope is not necessary for steam distillation to work.

== Applications ==

Steam distillation is often employed in the isolation of essential oils, for use in perfumes, for example. In this method, steam is passed through the plant material containing the desired oils. Eucalyptus oil, camphor oil and orange oil are obtained by this method on an industrial scale. Steam distillation is a means of purifying fatty acids, e.g. from tall oils.

Steam distillation is sometimes used in the chemical laboratory. Illustrative is a classic preparation of bromobiphenyl where steam distillation is used to first remove the excess benzene and subsequently to purifiy the brominated product. In one preparation of benzophenone, steam is employed to first recover unreacted carbon tetrachloride and subsequently to hydrolyze the intermediate benzophenone dichloride into benzophenone, which is in fact not steam distilled. It one preparation of a purine, steam distillation is used to remove volatile benzaldehyde from nonvolatile product.

== Equipment ==

On a lab scale, steam distillations are carried out using steam generated outside the system and piped through the mixture to be purified. Steam can also be generated in-situ using a Clevenger-type apparatus.

<text>Sir James Lucas Yeo, KCB, KBA (7 October 1782 – 21 August 1818) was a Royal Navy officer who served in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812. Born in Southampton, Hampshire, he joined the British navy at the age of 10 and saw his first action in the Adriatic Sea. Yeo distinguished himself in combat multiple times, most notably during the Portuguese conquest of French Guiana, earning knighthoods in the Portuguese Order of Aviz and the British Order of the Bath. He was subsequently given command of the frigate in 1812, but she was later wrecked in the Bahamas, although he was acquitted of blame for its loss. Yeo was then given command of the British squadron on Lake Ontario and commanded it in several engagements on Lake Ontario with American forces. He died off the African coast in 1818.

==Service history==

===Early life and career===
Yeo was born in Southampton, England on 7 October 1782 to a naval victualling agent. Yeo was sent to an academy near Winchester for his formal education. Yeo joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman aboard at the age of 10, thanks to his patron, Admiral Phillips Crosby. In 1796, he was made acting-lieutenant and placed in command of the 16-gun sloop . He was made lieutenant permanently on 20 February 1797. The vessel was deployed to the West Indies, where Yeo contracted Yellow fever and was ordered home to England to convalesce in 1798. By 1802, Yeo was first lieutenant aboard in the Adriatic Sea. He distinguished himself during the siege of Cesenatico in 1800, when thirteen merchant vessels were burned or sunk. Following the Peace of Amiens in 1802, Yeo was demoted to half-pay.

===Napoleonic Wars===
Once war began again between Britain and France in 1805, Yeo became first lieutenant of the frigate . The frigate was patrolling off the northwest coast of Spain when &quot;Loire&quot;″s commanding officer, Captain F.L. Maitland, chose to attack shipping in Muros Bay, Spain. Lieutenant Yeo led fifty men ashore to attack a shore battery that was firing on the frigate. Once there, they found a second, more powerful emplacement and captured that one too. During the battle, Yeo was stabbed with a bayonet. The Spanish suffered over forty casualties in the engagement, the British six. &quot;Loire&quot; captured three vessels at Muros Bay including the 22-gun corvette . As a reward, he was promoted to commander on 21 June and given the command of the captured &quot;Confiance&quot;, which had been taken into Royal Navy service.

In 1807, &quot;Confiance&quot; was part of Admiral Sidney Smith&#x27;s fleet off Portugal. &quot;Confiance&quot; transported Percy Smythe, 6th Viscount Strangford to Lisbon to negotiate an alliance with Britain. Lord Strangford also negotiated the passage of the Portuguese Prince Regent Dom João and the Portuguese royal family to Brazil. Yeo was ordered by Admiral Smith to bring word of Strangford&#x27;s success to Britain, an honour that led Yeo being named to the list of post-captains. Due to his rank, &quot;Confiance&quot; was reclassified as a post-ship. The following year, &quot;Confiance&quot; was part of Smith&#x27;s fleet stationed off Brazil.

Yeo was ordered by Smith to bring dispatches to a Portuguese general from whom he learned of French privateers based at Cayenne, French Guiana. On 6 January 1809, he took command of a small force consisting of &quot;Confiance&quot;, two Portuguese brigs, and 550 Portuguese soldiers. With them he captured Cayenne, a fortified position of two hundred guns, and took a thousand prisoners. The conquest of French Guiana would remove the French from their last South American colony. During the operation, Yeo was among the many British who became sick. In 1810, he was knighted for his services at Cayenne, both by the Portuguese who decreed him a member of the Order of Aviz and the British, who decreed him a knight commander of the Order of the Bath and was given his own coat-of-arms. Yeo was the first Protestant to be made a member of the Order of Aviz.

In 1811 Yeo was given command of the frigate . The frigate was ordered to Jamaica where it joined the fleet of Vice Admiral Charles Stirling. In 1812, he was stationed in the Bahamas. There he captured the privateer &quot;Heureuse Réunion&quot;, a brig and a corvette in the action of 3 February 1812, and the American brig in November 1812. However, shortly afterwards &quot;Southampton&quot; and &quot;Vixen&quot; were wrecked in the Crooked Island passage, although there were no deaths. As was customary in the case of the loss of a ship from any cause, Yeo was court martialled, but the court accepted that the reef on which he was wrecked was not charted, nor were the local currents documented, and Yeo was exonerated.

===War of 1812===
The importance of the naval warfare on the Great Lakes raised &quot;The Lakes Service&quot; to the status of a Flag Command and Kingston was the Commodore&#x27;s headquarters. Yeo was sent to Canada in 1813 aboard to command the British naval forces in the Great Lakes. He was appointed commodore of the fleet on Lake Ontario. Yeo&#x27;s use of his small navy was always determined and skillful, but he was hampered by a lack of cooperation from the British army. The commander of these forces, Sir George Prevost, failed to follow up key advances made by Yeo at Sackett&#x27;s Harbour and elsewhere that might have resulted in major British victories. On the whole, historians regard the war on Lake Ontario as having been a draw. During 1814 both Yeo and Isaac Chauncey, the American commander, tried to out build the other. Yeo captured Oswego, New York and then blockaded Sacketts Harbour on 6 May 1814, when reinforced by two frigates built on Point Frederick. During the final months of the war, Yeo ensured British control of the lake by the 1814 launch of , a 112-gun first rate ship of the line built in Kingston specifically for use on the lake, a three-decker man-of-war, and he had two more building. The Americans also had two first line men-o&#x27;-war on the stocks.

In August 1815, Yeo was posted to , 36 guns, at Plymouth. After the British-American War, Yeo held important commands on the West African and Caribbean stations, but saw no further action. He died in 1818 at the age of 35, while returning from Jamaica to England.

==Legacy==
The Yeo Hall at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario was named in his honour in 1936. This multifunctional building houses the Cadet Dining Hall and the Cadet Mess. The barber and Canadian Forces Exchange System (CANEX) are located in the basement.
A plaque erected by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada at the Royal Military College of Canada states &quot;Born in Southampton, England, Yeo entered the British Navy, served throughout the Napoleonic Wars and won rapid promotion by his ability. In 1813, already a Commodore, he came to Canada to command British forces on the Great Lakes. Yeo successfully blockaded the American fleet in Sackett&#x27;s Harbour for some months and subsequently commanded the naval forces at the capture of Oswego in 1814. Returning to England after the war he was posted to the West African Coast and died at sea while returning from that tour of duty.&quot;

Yeo was one of the actual historical officers on whom C. S. Forester modeled his fictional naval hero Horatio Hornblower. Forester briefly mentions him in the 1946 novel &quot;Lord Hornblower&quot;. The opening scene is a church service for members of the Order of the Bath, attended by a number of prominent historical naval officers, including Yeo, although the novel is set in 1813, when Yeo was in Canada and before he became a Knight of the Bath.

<text>Mini SQL (abbreviated mSQL) is a lightweight database management system from Hughes Technologies.

==History==
In 1993–94 David Hughes developed a network monitoring and management system called Minerva. The design of this system required a database management system to store its configuration and working data. To enable future portability, Hughes elected to use a Structured Query Language interface between the application and the database management system, despite the fact that at the time there was no free or inexpensive SQL database management implementation available. Hughes therefore developed a translation program which provided an SQL interface to the free Postgres DBMS (which did not use SQL). This product was named miniSQL, or mSQL. In time it became clear that Postgres did not perform adequately on the low-specification systems used to run Minerva, so mSQL developed into a lightweight database management system in its own right, implementing a limited subset of the SQL standard, but performing well on minimally specified hardware.

mSQL was the first low-cost SQL-based database management system. Combined with the free Linux operating system, the availability of relatively powerful low-cost PC hardware, and the development of World Wide Web standards and technologies, mSQL was an important factor in the early development of interactive, dynamic web applications, particularly in the period 1994–1997, after which it was increasingly supplanted by the more highly featured MySQL. mSQL had a large and widespread install base by the late 1990s.

==License==
Despite being offered in source code form, and being strongly associated with open source software, mSQL itself has never been offered under an open source license.

mSQL is provided free for non-commercial use. A typical license for commercial use in 1997 would cost $170, compared to a &quot;five-digit purchase price&quot; for its full-featured competitors.

==Current status==
By 1996, development on mSQL began to stagnate and MySQL arose to fill that void. By 1999, MySQL had surpassed mSQL in popularity and today mSQL has less visibility. At this time the database system is more often licensed by other companies for use in their products than used by end-users directly. mSQL is actively maintained and developed primarily to support its licensees and internal use within Hughes Technologies products and projects. It is still provided under a license that allows its use free of charge for non-commercial, educational and charitable activities. mSQL 4.4 was released in October 2021.

==Host languages==
mSQL originally supported several host languages:

* C, included with the software
* Perl
* Java via mSQL-JDBC
* Delphi
* Tcl
* PHP

<doc id="1285833" wikidata="Q1214977" url="?curid=1285833" title="The Men (1950 film)">
<text>The Men is a 1950 American drama film. Set mostly in a paraplegic ward of a VA hospital, the film stars Marlon Brando (in his film debut) as an ex-GI named Ken who, as a result of a war wound, is paralyzed and uses a wheelchair. Suffering from depression and an impaired self-concept, Ken struggles to come to terms with his disability and his need to accept care from others, including from his fiancée/wife.

Directed by Fred Zinnemann, the film was written by Carl Foreman, produced by Stanley Kramer and co-starred Teresa Wright and Everett Sloane. It received generally favorable reviews and an Academy Award nomination for writing.

== Plot ==
The film opens with a printed dedication:

In all Wars, since the beginning of History, there have been men who fought twice. The first time they battled with club, sword or machine gun. The second time they had none of these weapons. Yet this by far, was the greatest battle. It was fought with abiding faith and raw courage and in the end, Victory was achieved. This is the story of such a group of men. To them this film is dedicated.

During World War II, U.S. Army Lieutenant Ken Wilocek is shot in the back by a sniper, injuring his spinal cord. In the years that follow, he faces a series of ongoing struggles in accepting his condition, in rehabilitation and in re-entering society. The film also focuses on the challenges facing Ken and Ellen, his fiancée, as individuals and as a couple, before and after they marry. It also highlights events in the lives of the other men in the Veterans Administration hospital, from a wedding celebration to a sudden death from meningitis. Dr. Brock heads the team of doctors, nurses and physical therapists. Near the end of the film, when Ken accuses him of not understanding the difficulties threatening his marriage, Brock tells Ken about his own frustration: &quot;I can never see a patient walk out of here, never. I can keep a man alive, but in his heart he feels I failed him. You feel that way, don&#x27;t you? Took me a long time to get used to that.&quot; He reveals that he began specializing in paraplegia 18 years ago, after his wife was injured in a car accident. &quot;Paraplegia was a new field, then. At least she didn&#x27;t have to suffer too long ... I&#x27;d give anything I&#x27;ve got to know that when I go home I&#x27;d find her there, waiting for me, in a wheelchair.&quot; He can&#x27;t promise that everything will work out with Ellen, but if she loves Ken, and he behaves, chances are good. Anyway, he says, Ken has a lot of living to do, and he has to do it for himself.

Ken drives to Ellen&#x27;s parents&#x27; home, some distance from the hospital, takes out his wheelchair and goes up the steep brick front walk until a step blocks him. Ellen comes out. &quot;You&#x27;ve come a long way&quot;, she says. &quot;Do you want me to help you up the steps?&quot; He replies, &quot;Please.&quot; The film ends in a long shot of Ellen helping him to push his wheelchair into the house.

== Cast ==
* Marlon Brando as Ken Wilocek
* Teresa Wright as Ellen
* Everett Sloane as Dr. Brock
* Jack Webb as Norm
* Richard Erdman as Leo
* Arthur Jurado as Angel
* Virginia Farmer as Nurse Robbins
* Dorothy Tree as Ellen&#x27;s Mother
* Howard St. John as Ellen&#x27;s Father
* Many of the patients and staff at the Birmingham Veterans Administration Hospital” in Van Nuys, California, where much of the picture was filmed.

==Production==
According to TCM.com &quot;In addition to Arthur Jurado, a real-life paraplegic who was given a sizable speaking role, many others from Birmingham Hospital were added to the cast, including Dr. Norman Karr, physical therapist Helen Winston and nurses Rhoda Cormeny and Eunice Newberry.&quot;

In an October 16, 1949 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, &quot;Grim Masquerade&quot;, Gladwin Hill described how Brando was spending a month at the hospital, adding that writer Carl Foreman had spent longer than that. Before the film&#x27;s release, Director Fred Zinneman wrote an article titled &quot;On Using Non-Actors in Pictures&quot; for the January 8, 1950, edition of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He describes the process of working with the men and choosing those who would appear in the picture, especially Jurado. Zinneman wrote that &quot;All of the situations and dialogue in the script of &quot;The Men&quot; were written by Carl Foreman from material that he picked up from the men themselves while spending weeks with them ...&quot;

==Reception==
The film was banned in the United Kingdom because of a scene in which Dr. Brock speaks to a group of wives, mothers, fiancées and girlfriends of patients. The subject of having children (and, by implication, sexual relations) with a paraplegic husband is discussed, and Brock tells them that the ability to children varies in individual cases, but was unlikely overall. (Late in the film, Ellen asks Dr. Brock about children—or more specifically, her parents&#x27; desire for grandchildren.)

Upon release, &quot;The Men&quot; received generally positive reviews, particularly for its screenplay. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 77% based on reviews from 13 critics. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a positive review and wrote: &quot;Stern in its intimations of the terrible consequences of war, this film is a haunting and affecting, as well as a rewarding, drama to have at this time.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; also gave a favorable review, and noted: &quot;Producer Stanley Kramer turns to the difficult cinematic subject of paraplegics, so expertly treated as to be sensitive, moving and yet, withal, entertaining and earthy-humored.&quot;

Brando&#x27;s screen debut received much praise, and The &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; acclaimed him as “an important new star in the Hollywood horizon.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; saw it differently: &quot;Brando fails to deliver with the necessary sensitivity and inner warmth which would transform an adequate portrayal into an expert one. Slight speech impediment which sharply enhanced his &quot;Streetcar&quot; role jars here. His supposed college graduate depiction is consequently not completely convincing.&quot;

In 1950, &quot;The New York Times″&quot; Bosley Crowther covered the film in several articles.

==Reissue==
The film was reissued by National Telefilm Associates under the title &quot;Battle Stripe&quot; together with the 1943 Lewis Milestone film &quot;The North Star&quot; which was renamed &quot;Armored Attack&quot;.

==Accolades==
Carl Foreman was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay.
The National Board of Review placed the film on its annual list of the ten best movies of the year.

<doc id="1285835" wikidata="Q332434" url="?curid=1285835" title="Jeff McInnis">
<text>Jeff Lemans McInnis (born October 22, 1974) is an American former professional basketball player. He played in the National Basketball Association (NBA), in Greece and in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA).

==Playing career==

After his junior year playing for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, McInnis was chosen by the Denver Nuggets in the second round of the 1996 NBA draft. He played three seasons for the Quad City Thunder of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) from 1997 to 2000. He was selected as the CBA Newcomer of the Year and named to the All-CBA Second Team and All-Defensive Team in 1998. He was chosen as the CBA Most Valuable Player and a member of the All-CBA First Team in 2000.

All together, during his NBA career, McInnis would play for the Nuggets, the New Jersey Nets, the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Portland Trail Blazers, the Los Angeles Clippers, and the Washington Wizards.

For the 2005–06 season, the New Jersey Nets acquired McInnis, a free agent, mainly to back up star point guard Jason Kidd. McInnis played limited minutes, tore left-knee cartilage on January 15, and missed significant time.

Ahead of his return for the 2006 playoffs, the Nets kept McInnis inactive. The team&#x27;s attempts to negotiate a contract buyout or a trade before the new season were unsuccessful, leaving McInnis in limbo, on the roster but exiled, early in the 2006–07 season.

On January 3, 2007, the Charlotte Bobcats received McInnis from the Nets in trade for Bernard Robinson and cash considerations. McInnis, who would play 38 games for Charlotte, averaging 4.3 points and 3.3 assists per game, was waived by the Bobcats on February 29, 2008.

== Coaching career ==
In 2009, McInnis founded the AAU organization Team Charlotte. In 2015, he won 17U National Coach of the Year honors. In 2019, he became national head basketball coach at Combine Academy in Lincolnton, North Carolina. His stint there ended in 2022.

In April 2024 Chris Mack hired McInnis as an assistant coach for the Charleston Cougars, his first collegiate coaching position.

<text>Antony Patrick MacDonnell, 1st Baron MacDonnell, (7 March 1844 – 9 June 1925), known as Sir Antony MacDonnell between 1893 and 1908, was an Irish civil servant, much involved in the Indian land reform and famine relief in India. He was Permanent Under-Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (1902–1908); Member of the Council of India (1902); Privy Councillor (1902); Lieutenant-Governor of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh (1895–1901); Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal (1893–1895); Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces (1890–1893); Chief Commissioner of Burma (1889–1890); Home Secretary to the Central Government of India (1886–1889); Secretary to the Government of Bengal and the Bengal Legislative Council.

==Early life==
MacDonnell was born at Palmfield House, Shragh Lower, Carracastle, Ballaghaderreen, County Mayo, on 7 March 1844, to Mark Garvey MacDonnell (1807–1889), a local Catholic landlord, and his wife, Bedelia (née O&#x27;Hara). He was educated at Summerhill College, Athlone, County Westmeath, and at the age of fifteen enrolled at Queen&#x27;s College, Galway. His main area of study was the field of modern languages, and he graduated with first class honors in 1864, winning the Peel Gold Medal.

Little is known of MacDonnell&#x27;s early life, as he left no memoirs nor any letters. He participated in the Literary &amp; Debating Society (then known as the Literary and Scientific Society) at Queen&#x27;s College, holding the office of vice-auditor for the 1863–1864 session. He was referred to by one of his professors as the finest debater the professor had ever seen. On leaving university in 1864, MacDonnell successfully sat the entrance examination for the Indian Civil Service, and was posted to Bengal, arriving in Calcutta in November 1865.

== India ==
On arrival in India, MacDonnell served initially in various districts of Bihar and Bengal, and on the basis of his experiences in the Bengal Famine of 1873–4, he wrote his first book, &quot;Food-Grain Supply and Famine Relief in Bihar and Bengal&quot;, published in 1876. He was appointed Accountant-General to the Provincial Government at Calcutta in 1881, and later Revenue Secretary of the province. In 1886, Lord Dufferin appointed him Home Secretary to the Central Government of India; two years later, he was created Companion of the Star of India (C.S.I.). In 1889, he became Chief Commissioner of Burma; in 1890, Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces; and in 1893, Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, becoming a member of the Viceroy&#x27;s Executive Council. In 1893 he was also appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India (KCSI).

In 1895, MacDonnell became Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh (later known as the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh). Here, in 1896, he was once again faced with famine; his efforts in the management of the famine were recognised when he was made a Knight Grand Commander of the Star of India (GCSI) in 1898. In that same year, the viceroy, Lord Elgin, requested that MacDonnell again take charge of Bengal as Lieutenant-Governor, an offer he declined due to fatigue and the frail health of his wife. He became President of the Indian Famine Commission in 1901. In that year, due to his own ill-health and that of his wife, he resigned office and left India to return to London.

MacDonnell is acknowledged as one of the ablest men to work in the Indian Civil Service, particularly in dealing with famine relief. His policies on the management of famine conditions are credited with preventing the loss of million of lives. His concern for the rights of tenants and smallholders led to the Bengal Tenancy Act of 1885, a piece of progressive legislation which protected tenant farmers from rack-rents and arbitrary eviction; a similar measure was introduced to the Northwest Provinces during his lieutenant-governorship there. However it would appear that MacDonnell was not liked within the upper echelons of the service he came to occupy. His position had been achieved through intellectual ability and dedication to each task set before him, yet he was looked down upon as his background was certainly not that of a &#x27;gentleman,&#x27; lacking the familial connections of this contemporaries. He did, however, have a powerful friend in Lord Curzon the Viceroy. Curzon admired MacDonnell&#x27;s tenacious capabilities when faced with drastic problems, qualities that were gravely lacking within Curzon himself. A further insight on MacDonnell&#x27;s isolation was Curzon&#x27;s somewhat cutting reference to MacDonnell as &quot;singularly lacking any human emotion.&quot; Nevertheless, Sir Antony MacDonnell rose to some of the highest civilian offices within the British Raj. His strength and tenacity earned MacDonnell the soubriquet &quot;The Bengal Tiger&quot;; a colleague observed: &quot;If Antony and another are cast away in an open boat and only one of them can live, it will not be Antony who is eaten.&quot;

MacDonnell was sworn of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 11 August 1902, following an announcement of the King&#x27;s intention to make this appointment in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published in June that year. He was also appointed a member of the Council of India in October October 1902. It was expected that he would be appointed Governor of Bombay in that year, but instead he opted to accept an offer from George Wyndham, Chief Secretary for Ireland, to become Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Ireland, the administrative head of the Irish Government.

== The MacDonnell Hostel, Aftab Hall, Aligarh Muslim University ==
In the year 1895, Antony Patrick MacDonnell was appointed as Lieutenant Governor of North West Province and Oudh. He served in this position till the year 1901. Honouring a request for funds towards construction of a hostel at Aligarh Muslim University, MacDonnell sanctioned Rs. 20,000 from the provincial budget in 1900 for the construction of a hostel to meet lodging problems of the students at the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College. The construction work was completed in March 1904 and a hostel of Aftab Hall was named the MacDonnell Hostel after him.

==Under-Secretary for Ireland==

MacDonnell was known to be sympathetic to the cause of Irish Home Rule, and his return to London elicited an offer to join his brother, Dr Mark Anthony MacDonnell, in the House of Commons as an independent nationalist. Competing for his attention, however, was a recommendation by Lord Lansdowne, his former superior as Viceroy of India, to the Chief Secretary for Ireland that MacDonnell be offered the position of Permanent Under-Secretary for Ireland, the administrative head of the Irish government.

MacDonnell entered into lengthy negotiations with Lansdowne and the Chief Secretary, George Wyndham, regarding the terms under which he would accept the position; he was not content to occupy the traditional role of an administrative civil servant, with little input into the formulation of policy. He eventually accepted the office of Under-Secretary on the explicit understanding that he would be given &quot;adequate opportunities of influencing the policy and acts of the administration&quot;.

MacDonnell&#x27;s choice to return to head the Irish administration was surprising for several reasons. The position and authority that MacDonnell enjoyed in India was greater than any he could hope to hold as Under-Secretary in Ireland. Additionally, the Government in London was in the hands of the Conservative Party; MacDonnell was a Liberal and a Catholic. The decision to offer the role to MacDonnell may have had its origins in the Conservative policy of &quot;killing Home Rule with kindness&quot;. It is clear that MacDonnell saw his role as far more significant than that of an administrative functionary. At the time of his appointment as Under-Secretary, he was also given a seat on the Council of India, to provide an alternative should his time in Ireland fail to meet his expectations. His commitment to Ireland, however, had become clear by 1903, in which year he was offered a return to India as Governor of Bombay; King Edward VII intervened to persuade MacDonnell that he was needed more in Ireland than in India.

MacDonnell&#x27;s early years as Under-Secretary were a success. The Conservative Chief Secretary, Wyndham, was supportive of constructive steps to reform systems of land tenure in Ireland, and the 1902 Land Conference resulted in the Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903, which allowed tenants to buy their holdings from landlords through a system of state-provided loans. Plans for reform of the Dublin Castle administration were also brought forward. Following on from these administrative reforms, MacDonnell entered more politically dangerous territory, by collaborating with several liberal landlords led by the Fourth Earl of Dunraven in drawing up a plan for the devolution of some governmental authority from the Westminster parliament to an elected council in Dublin, albeit in a manner consistent with the Act of Union 1800. The landowners involved formed a group known as the Irish Reform Association, and published the outline of the scheme in a 1904 manifesto; Lord Dunraven requested that MacDonnell formulate the plan in greater detail. Understanding that he had the support of the new Lord Lieutenant, Lord Dudley, as well as Wyndham, MacDonnell proceeded to draft a document on Dublin Castle notepaper which constituted a second devolution manifesto, and sent it to Dunraven, who had it published.

It quickly became publicly known that MacDonnell had assisted the Irish Reform Association in the drafting of the scheme. This enraged Ulster Unionist interests, who had in any event been suspicious of MacDonnell due to his known sympathies toward Home Rule. The events precipitated a political crisis; Wyndham repudiated the scheme in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot;, but by March 1905, due to repeated Unionist attacks, his position as Chief Secretary had become untenable and he was forced to resign from Cabinet. He was replaced by Walter Long, a strong unionist. MacDonnell was formally censured by the Cabinet for exceeding his powers, but remained in office. Although unable to defend himself in parliament, many aristocratic associates from his service in India remained favorably disposed towards him and defended his position. He was also helped by the fact, known among prominent government figures, that he enjoyed the strong support of King Edward VII, to whom he was quite close.

On the fall of the Balfour government in 1905, James Bryce replaced Long as Chief Secretary for Ireland in the new Liberal administration. Bryce relied heavily on MacDonnell, as did his successor, Augustine Birrell, who was appointed in 1907, and together they drafted a new devolution scheme, the Irish Council Bill, which sought to initiate a committee of Irish M.P.s to deal with legislation relating purely to Ireland. The initiative was unsuccessful, failing to secure the support of a majority of Irish Nationalist MPs.

MacDonnell&#x27;s latter years in office were less eventful. One of the most colourful incidents of his later career was the crisis surrounding the theft of the regalia of the Order of St. Patrick, known popularly as the &quot;Irish Crown Jewels&quot;, from the Office of Arms in Dublin Castle shortly before a royal visit to Ireland in 1907. His relationship with Birrell was never comfortable, and, frustrated by the lack of progress towards a workable scheme of devolution for Ireland, he resigned his post in July 1908, at the age of 64. He was a delegate for the Southern Unionists during the 1917–18 Irish Convention.

MacDonnell was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in 1903, and on his retirement from office in 1908 he was elevated to the peerage as Baron MacDonnell, of Swinford in the County of Mayo (a town close to his birthplace).

== Retirement ==

MacDonnell retired to London and withdrew in large part from public life. His contributions to the House of Lords tended to focus on Irish and Indian matters. He served as Chairman of the Royal Commission on the Civil Service between 1912 and 1914, and as a member of the Irish Convention of 1917–18. He accepted only two company directorships – of the Midland Great Western Railway Company, and the National Bank, of which he became vice-chairman. On the creation of the Irish Free State in 1921, he was offered a seat in the new Senate, which he declined &quot;with much regret&quot;.

In retirement, he retained his strong interest in matters of Irish land reform. He returned to his alma mater, by then known as University College Galway, in 1911, to address the Literary and Debating Society of which he had been a distinguished officer in his student days. After a speech setting out a proposal for a workable solution to Irish agrarian demands, he finished with the patriotic lines: &quot;Oh brave young men, my pride, my hope, my promise/It is on you my heart is set/In manliness, in kindliness, in justice,/To make Ireland a nation yet.&quot;

==Family==
Lord MacDonnell married Henrietta MacDonell, daughter of Ewen MacDonell, chief of the Keppoch branch of the clan Macdonald, in 1878. They had one child, The Hon. Anne Margaret MacDonnell.

Lord MacDonnell died after a brief illness at his home in London on 9 June 1925, aged 81. Leaving no male heir, his barony became extinct at his death. A statue of MacDonnell by Sir George Frampton was erected at Lucknow by the Talukdars of Oudh in 1907.

<text>Les Horribles Cernettes (, &quot;The Horrible CERN Girls&quot;) was an all-female parody pop group, self-labelled &quot;the one and only High Energy Rock Band&quot;, which was founded by employees of CERN and performed at CERN and other HEP-related events. Their main claim to fame is that a photograph of them was one of the earliest photographic images shared on the World Wide Web.

Their musical style is often described as doo-wop. The initials of their name, LHC, are the same as those of the Large Hadron Collider, which was later built at CERN. Their humorous songs are freely available on their website.

==History==
&quot;Les Horribles Cernettes&quot; was founded in 1990 by Michele de Gennaro, a graphic designer at CERN, whose romantic relationship with a physicist was made difficult by his numerous shifts. She attracted attention by stepping on stage during the CERN Hardronic Festival, singing &quot;Collider&quot;, a melancholy song about the lonely nights endured by the girlfriend of a high energy physicist.

The group was subsequently formed with the help of Silvano de Gennaro, an analyst in the Computer Science department at CERN, who wrote additional songs. The fame of &quot;Les Horribles Cernettes&quot; grew and they were invited to international Physics conferences and The World &#x27;92 Expo in Seville, as well as celebrations such as Georges Charpak&#x27;s Nobel Prize party. At the same time the band self-released an album titled &quot;Collider&quot; through CD Baby and received press coverage from numerous newspapers, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Herald Tribune&quot;, &quot;La Tribune de Genève&quot;, and the &quot;CERN Courier&quot;.

The band&#x27;s lineup has changed over time, but they were performing under the same name until 21 July 2012, when the band had its final performance, which was at CERN&#x27;s Hardronic Festival in Switzerland.

The band went into hiatus when Silvano and Michele moved away from the CERN area and officially disbanded in late July 2012, after performing at the CERN Hardronic Festival on the 21st. Lynn Veronneau has since embarked upon a serious solo career, recording French language versions of popular standards. Angela Higney also made several solo releases.

On July 15, 2017, and in celebration of their 25th anniversary (of their historic exposure on the World Wide Web), the original members performed for a one-time-only concert in Geneva.

In May 2020 the band released a new song titled &quot;The Lockdown Song&quot; referencing to the events of COVID-19 pandemic.

On September 17, 2024, the band performed at CERN in celebration of the organisation&#x27;s 70th anniversary.

<text>Brenda Ethel Davies (née Mathews) (January 17, 1917 – January 9, 2013) was an Australian actress and stage manager. She was the wife and literary executor of Canadian novelist Robertson Davies.

Mathews was born in Melbourne, and met Davies at the University of Oxford. Sharing an interest in theatre, they became engaged at the Old Vic in 1939 and married in 1940. Returning to Canada, they settled in Peterborough, Ontario, and had three daughters. Brenda gave up her career in the theatre.

Her influence on Davies extended to persuading him to begin writing novels after some success as a playwright and to become principal of Massey College.

After Davies&#x27; death in 1995, she and one of their daughters, Jennifer Surridge, became literary executors for his estate, and formed the company Pendragon Ink for this purpose. Together they edited one volume of Davies&#x27; criticism.

She was the sister of Maisie Purves Smith, who became the second wife of the painter Sir Russell Drysdale.

<doc id="1285861" wikidata="Q819135" url="?curid=1285861" title="Beretta 93R">
<text>The Beretta 93R is an Italian selective-fire machine pistol, designed and manufactured by Beretta in the late 1970s for police and military use, that is derived from their semi-automatic Beretta 92. The &quot;R&quot; stands for &quot;Raffica&quot;, which is Italian for &quot;volley&quot;, &quot;flurry&quot;, or &quot;burst&quot; (sometimes spoken &quot;R&quot; as &quot;Rapid&quot; in English).

==History==
The Beretta 93R was designed to be used by the Italian counter-terrorism forces of the national police &quot;Nucleo Operativo Centrale di Sicurezza&quot; and Carabineri &quot;Gruppo di Intervento Speciale&quot; (both formed in the late 1970s in response to terrorism) but was also adopted by other police and military forces who required a concealable weapon with rapid fire capabilities. The pistol is a development of the Beretta 92 design.

==Mechanics==
The Beretta 93R is mechanically similar to the Beretta 92. It can be selected to fire either a three round burst or single fire. A selector switch enables the operator to alternate between the two firing modes. The pistol is fitted with a collapsible angled foregrip at the front end of the trigger guard to provide better stability when firing. A folding steel buttstock can be attached at the heel of the grip. The Beretta 93R is much more controllable compared to other machine pistols because it was designed with only a three-round burst mode as well as a ported barrel.

<doc id="1285865" wikidata="Q370006" url="?curid=1285865" title="Drew Gooden">
<text>Andrew Melvin Gooden III (born September 24, 1981) is an American former professional basketball player who is currently a broadcaster for Monumental Sports Network. The power forward played 14 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Gooden played college basketball for the Kansas Jayhawks, where he was a consensus first-team All-American in 2002. He earned NBA All-Rookie First Team honors with the Memphis Grizzlies after they selected him in the first round of the 2002 NBA draft with the fourth overall pick.

==Early life==
As a senior at El Cerrito High School, Gooden led his Gauchos to the 1999 California Interscholastic Federation Boys&#x27; Division III championship game. Washington Union High School (led by future NBA guard DeShawn Stevenson) won the championship game over El Cerrito HS by a score of 77–71.

==College career==
Gooden joined fellow freshmen Nick Collison and Kirk Hinrich for the 1999–2000 season at Kansas. Although at times, Gooden was frustrated with the way things were going his freshman year, he finally adjusted to coach Roy Williams&#x27; system.

In his freshman year, the Jayhawks went 24–10 and lost to Duke in the round of 32 during the 2000 NCAA basketball tournament. The next season, the Jayhawks went 26–7 and fell to Illinois in the 2001 NCAA basketball tournament Sweet Sixteen.

In 2002, he led the nation in rebounding and was named NABC National Player of the Year. The Jayhawks went 33–4, including 16–0 in Big 12 Conference play to win Kansas its first conference championship since 1998. The Jayhawks advanced to their first Final Four in the 2002 NCAA basketball tournament since 1993, however, they lost to the eventual national champion Maryland in the semifinal.

For being named NABC Player of the Year for 2002, Gooden&#x27;s jersey (#0) was retired in 2003. The ceremony occurred at halftime of a Kansas home game with Kansas State in what would have been Gooden&#x27;s senior year had he not foregone his senior year for the NBA.

==Professional career==

=== Memphis Grizzlies (2002–2003) ===
Gooden declared himself for the draft after his junior year. Out of Kansas, Gooden was selected as the 4th overall pick by the Memphis Grizzlies in the 2002 NBA draft.

=== Dallas Mavericks (2009–2010) ===

On July 25, 2009, Gooden posted a message on his Twitter page that said &quot;Dallas Here I Come!!!&quot; Dallas Mavericks owner, Mark Cuban, retweeted Gooden&#x27;s tweet, adding &quot;Welcome Drew.. !&quot;. On July 30, Gooden officially signed with the Mavericks.

===Los Angeles Clippers (2010)===
On February 13, 2010, Gooden was traded to the Washington Wizards along with Josh Howard, James Singleton, and Quinton Ross for Caron Butler, Brendan Haywood, and DeShawn Stevenson. Four days later, he was traded again, this time to the Los Angeles Clippers as part of a three-team, six-player trade that sent Antawn Jamison from Washington to the Cleveland Cavaliers, Žydrūnas Ilgauskas, a 2010 first-round pick and the rights to Emir Preldžič from the Cavaliers to Washington, Al Thornton from Los Angeles to Washington, and Sebastian Telfair from Los Angeles to Cleveland. Gooden changed his number from #90 to #0 during his tenure with the Clippers.

=== Milwaukee Bucks (2010–2013) ===
On July 1, 2010, Gooden agreed to a 5-year/$32 million contract with the Milwaukee Bucks, which would make the Bucks his ninth team in as many seasons in the league. On April 9, 2011, he recorded his first career triple-double in a win over the Cavaliers with 15 points, 13 rebounds, and 13 assists.

On March 7, 2012, Gooden scored a season high 27 points during a 106–104 loss to the Chicago Bulls. On March 14, Gooden recorded his second career triple-double in a win over the Cavaliers with 15 points, 10 rebounds, and 13 assists.

On July 18, 2014, Gooden re-signed with the Wizards. In the team&#x27;s season opener on October 29, 2014, against the Miami Heat, Gooden was named the starting power forward in what was his first of just seven starts for the season. He subsequently scored a season-high 18 points and did not top that mark for the rest of the season.

On July 13, 2015, Gooden again re-signed with the Wizards.

Gooden&#x27;s final NBA game was played on April 13, 2016, in a 109 – 98 win over the Atlanta Hawks; he recorded one point and one steal in two minutes of playing time. On July 7, 2016, the Wizards declined their option on Gooden&#x27;s contract, making him an unrestricted free agent.

In February 2018, Drew Gooden joined Ice Cube&#x27;s BIG3 basketball league as co-captain of 3&#x27;s Company.

==Personal life==

Gooden is half Finnish; his father, Andrew Gooden, met Drew&#x27;s mother, Ulla, while playing pro basketball in Äänekoski, Finland. Gooden&#x27;s parents divorced later on, and he stayed with his father in California. In August 2014, Gooden attempted to get Finnish citizenship in order to play for their national team, but he failed to do so before the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup.

Gooden enjoys playing the piano.

At the beginning of the 2006–07 season, Gooden appeared with a patch of hair on the back of his head. He refers to this hair style as a &quot;duck tail.&quot; Gooden said, &quot;It is drawing a lot of attention ... One thing I&#x27;ve found out is even negative publicity is good publicity. At least I had the (guts) to do it.&quot; He claims women love it: &quot;I went from not getting compliments to now being sexy.&quot;

In 2012, Gooden opened a Wingstop restaurant franchise in Altamonte Springs, Florida.

In 2016, Gooden returned to the University of Kansas and earned his degree in communications.

<text>Bernarda Bryson Shahn (March 7, 1903 – December 12, 2004) was an American painter and lithographer. She also wrote and illustrated children&#x27;s books including &quot;The Zoo of Zeus&quot; and &quot;Gilgamesh.&quot; The artist Ben Shahn was her &quot;life companion&quot; and they married in 1969, shortly before his death.

==Personal life==
Bernarda Bryson was born in Athens, Ohio, where her father owned the &quot;Athens Morning Journal&quot; and her mother was a Latin professor. Both of her parents were politically active and liberal. Her maternal grandfather was also politically active, with his home a stop on the underground railroad. In Ohio, she studied art, including etching, and art history at several schools including Ohio University, Ohio State University, and the Cleveland School of Art, and learned lithography from a friend. She married young, divorced, and then worked for a newspaper in Columbus, the &quot;Ohio State Journal&quot;, writing about art news, and teaching printmaking for the museum school at the Columbus Museum of Art. On a trip to New York in 1932 (or 1933) to interview Diego Rivera, during the production of his Rockefeller Center murals, she met his assistant Ben Shahn. After moving to New York shortly after completing the interview, Bryson reconnected with Shahn and they moved to Washington, DC. Bryson and Shahn had three children together and eventually settled in Roosevelt, New Jersey. She died at her home in Roosevelt at the age of 101 on December 12, 2004.

==Career==
Already a trained printmaker, Bryson worked for the Depression-era Resettlement Administration, later part of the Farm Security Administration on a project with Shahn in the 1930s to document rural life. Her lithographs from this series were first printed in the studio she and Shahn established in Washington for the Resettlement Administration and published in full in 1995 as &quot;The Vanishing American Frontier&quot;. In 1939, Bryson and Shahn produced a set of 13 murals for the Treasury Department Art Project&#x27;s Section of Fine Arts entitled &quot;Resources of America&quot; inspired by Walt Whitman&#x27;s poem &quot;I See America Working&quot; and installed at the United States Post Office-Bronx Central Annex. Bryson worked primarily as an illustrator beginning in the 1940s, producing works for &quot;Harpers&quot; as well as &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Seventeen&quot;, and &quot;Scientific American&quot;, and later for several children&#x27;s books&quot;.&quot; These included &quot;Zoo of Zeus&quot; in 1964 and &quot;Gilgamesh in 1967&quot;. Her illustrations of the Princeton University Eating Club and of Senator Taft as he is groomed for his 1948 Republican Presidential Candidacy exemplify her minimalistic representation of satire and straightforward style. She continued painting throughout her life in a figurative style often with references to Classical mythology, and she worked was exhibited in solo shows at galleries in New York and New Jersey.

<text>Rabbit of Seville is a Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; theatrical cartoon short released on December 16, 1950. It was directed by Chuck Jones and written by Michael Maltese, and features Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. The nonstop slapstick humor in the short is paced musically around the overture to Italian composer Gioachino Rossini&#x27;s 1816 opera buffa &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;. In 1994, &quot;Rabbit of Seville&quot; ranked number 12 in a list of &quot;The 50 Greatest Cartoons&quot; released in North America during the 20th century, a ranking compiled from votes cast by 1,000 artists, producers, directors, voice actors, and other professionals in the field of animation.

==Plot==
A local amphitheater bustles with spectators to view a rendition of &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;. Amidst the tranquil setting, Bugs Bunny is chased by hunter Elmer Fudd, traversing from the distant hills to the theater&#x27;s backstage. Bugs raises the curtain, revealing Elmer to the audience.

Exploiting the theatrical milieu to his advantage, Bugs assumes various guises from the opera to outwit Elmer, from a temptress to a snake charmer and, in particular, a barber.

As the absurd escapade unfolds, a cacophony of comedic chaos ensues, culminating in a farcical exchange of increasingly outlandish weaponry. From pedicures to peculiar grooming rituals, Bugs subjects Elmer to a series of ludicrous predicaments.

In a climactic flourish, Bugs orchestrates a mock wedding ceremony, symbolizing the culmination of their absurd escapade. After the wedding, Bugs carries Elmer high into the rafters, opens the door to a prop house, and drops Elmer into the wedding cake reserved for the opera&#x27;s second act far below. Bugs then chomps on a carrot and says &quot;Ehhh... next!&quot;

==Production==
In a plotline reminiscent of &quot;Stage Door Cartoon&quot;, &quot;Rabbit of Seville&quot; features Bugs Bunny being chased by Elmer Fudd into the stage door of the Hollywood Bowl, whereupon Bugs tricks Elmer into going onstage, and participating in a break-neck operatic production of their chase punctuated with gags and accompanied by musical arrangements by Carl Stalling, focusing on Rossini&#x27;s overture to the 1816 opera &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;.

In Stalling&#x27;s arrangement, the overture&#x27;s basic structure is kept relatively intact; some repeated passages are removed and the overall piece is conducted at a faster tempo to accommodate the cartoon&#x27;s standard running length. In a short sequence where Bugs&#x27; scalp massage follows a piano solo, the character&#x27;s hands are shown with five fingers, instead of his usual four, so the character can believably follow the tune. In 1994 it was voted No. 12 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field.

The &quot;Barber of Seville&quot; poster that appears at the start of the film features three names: Eduardo Selzeri, Michele Maltese, and Carlo Jonzi, which are Italianized versions of the names of the producer (Edward Selzer), writer (Michael Maltese), and director (Chuck Jones) of the film.

==Reception==
Animation historian Greg Ford writes, &quot;Chuck Jones&#x27; two most beloved operatic extravaganzas starring Bugs Bunny, &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot; (1957) and &quot;Rabbit of Seville&quot;, veer down somewhat different paths stylistically. &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot; relies on a more removed, high-concept graphic sense and the shock effect of Maurice Noble&#x27;s splendidly expressionistic set design. The humor of &quot;Rabbit of Seville&quot;, staged against Robert Gribbroek&#x27;s straightforward backgrounds, depends more exclusively on the cartoon&#x27;s intense synchronization whereby every bit of slapstick action, mini-movement by mini-movement, links to the accompanying Rossini score. In &quot;Seville&quot;, Jones was really harking back to an older Warner Bros. legacy: director Friz Freleng&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Rivets&quot; (1941) and &quot;Pigs in a Polka&quot; (1943), perhaps the two most insistently &#x27;Mickey Moused&#x27; (perfectly synched) musical cartoons ever made.&quot;

==Home media==
&quot;Rabbit of Seville&quot; is available, uncut and digitally remastered, on disc 1 of &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1&quot;, disc 1 of &quot;The Essential Bugs Bunny&quot;, on disc 1 of &quot;Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 1&quot;, and on disc 2 of &quot;Bugs Bunny 80th Anniversary Collection&quot;.

<text>Richard Douglas James Baker OBE RD (15 June 1925 – 17 November 2018) was an English broadcaster, best known as a newsreader for BBC News from 1954 to 1982, and as a radio presenter of classical music. He was a contemporary of Kenneth Kendall and Robert Dougall and was the first reader of the &quot;BBC Television News&quot; (in voiceover) in 1954.

==Early life ==
The eldest son of a plasterer, Baker was born in Willesden, North London, and educated at Kilburn Grammar School and at Peterhouse, Cambridge.

Baker&#x27;s undergraduate years were interrupted by war service in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve during World War II. He was on a minesweeper that protected the Allied Arctic supply convoys to the USSR. He was awarded the Royal Naval Reserve decoration. In May 2015 he was awarded the Ushakov Medal for his service in the Arctic convoys of World War II.

== Broadcasting career==
After graduating from Cambridge University, Baker worked as an actor and as a teacher. An approach to the BBC saw him gain his first broadcasting role, presenting classical music on the BBC Third Programme.

He introduced the first BBC television news broadcast on 5 July 1954, although John Snagge read the actual bulletin. A competent pianist, he also became closely associated with classical music broadcasting, and presented many music programmes on both television and radio, including, for many years, the annual live broadcast from the &quot;Last Night of the Proms&quot;. He was a regular panellist on the classical music quiz show &quot;Face the Music&quot;. From 1979-1980 he was a columnist for Now! Magazine.
On radio he presented &quot;Baker&#x27;s Dozen&quot;, &quot;Start the Week&quot; on Radio 4 from April 1970 until 1987, &quot;Mozart&quot;, &quot;These You Have Loved&quot; (1972–77), and &quot;Melodies for You&quot; for BBC Radio 2 (1986–1995, 1999–2003). He also presented the long-running &quot;Your Hundred Best Tunes&quot; for BBC Radio 2 on Sunday nights, taking over from Alan Keith, who died in 2003, and retiring in January 2007 when the programme was dropped by the BBC. In 1995, he made his first foray into independent radio with a move to Classic FM, where he presented the Classic Countdown and Evening Concert programmes.

Baker narrated &quot;Mary, Mungo and Midge&quot; (1969), a children&#x27;s cartoon produced for the BBC, and &quot;Teddy Edward&quot; (1973), another children&#x27;s series, as well as Prokofiev&#x27;s composition for children &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;. He made cameo appearances in three episodes (30, 33 and 39) of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; and in the 1977 &quot;Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show&quot;. In the former, he is performing his newsreading duties before pausing and speaking the &quot;non sequitur&quot; &quot;Lemon curry?&quot;

== Personal life ==
Baker married Margaret Martin, at St Mary The Boltons in Brompton, London, on 2 June 1961, while both were in their mid-30s. They had known each other from infancy as their mothers were friends. The couple had two sons; Andrew, a sports columnist at &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and James, a television executive at Red Arrow Studios.

Baker wrote a biography of Vice-Admiral Sir Gilbert Stephenson, under whom he had served. &quot;The Terror of Tobermory&quot; was published by W. H. Allen in 1972.

At the time of his 90th birthday Baker was living with his wife at a retirement village in Oxfordshire. He died on 17 November 2018, at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, aged 93. Following his death, fellow BBC broadcast journalist John Simpson tweeted: &quot;Richard Baker, who has just died, was one of the finest newsreaders of modern times: highly intelligent, thoughtful, gentle, yet tough in defence of his principles.&quot;

<doc id="1285876" wikidata="Q3998685" url="?curid=1285876" title="Walrus (Marvel Comics)">
<text>The Walrus is a comedic supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is the enemy of Spider-Man and Frog-Man.

==Publication history==
Walrus first appeared in &quot;The Defenders&quot; #131 (May 1984) and was created by J.M. DeMatteis, Peter Gillis, and Alan Kupperberg.

==Fictional character biography==
The Walrus is a supervillain and foe of Spider-Man. He wears a costume that resembles a walrus. Despite being physically strong, he proves to be completely inept at villainy. While most supervillains are interested in stealing money or taking over the world, but just like any other monsters (e.g., kaiju), the Walrus was content with mindless property damage; reminiscent of the Hulk, as well as his enemies, the Abomination, Juggernaut, and Rhino (also one of Spider-Man&#x27;s enemies). He considered his role as a supervillain as that of a &quot;mass-destructionist&quot;. The man who would eventually become the Walrus was once a taxicab driver named Hubert Carpenter (a reference to &quot;The Walrus and the Carpenter&quot; poem from &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;). Hubert&#x27;s uncle Humbert (a mad scientist/eccentric janitor) used devious experimental technology to endow Hubert with the attributes of a walrus that would surely make him into an eminent supervillain. Hubert, now with the &quot;proportionate speed, strength and agility of a walrus&quot;, started causing havoc. He fought the New Defenders and the second Frog-Man before collapsing.

Then he teamed with the deadly and nefarious White Rabbit, forming the Terrible Two. They fought Spider-Man and were easily beaten. One of their common goals was to murder Frog-Man, who had humiliated them both in the past. However, it was soon revealed that Frog-Man had little to worry about, as the Walrus is the sort of supervillain that has to wear velcro shoes in order to avoid accidentally tying his shoes to each other. The Walrus is not the smartest villain, as he tends to make the most stupid remarks, which even made Spider-Man laugh uncontrollably at him, allowing the Walrus to punch and knock him down. The fact that the Walrus also wears a large rainbow &quot;W&quot; on the front of his costume also tends to make his enemies laugh at him.

The Walrus later appears with Mr. Fish in an exotic nightclub where he is seen admiring an overweight dancer.

During the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, Deadpool sees the chaos caused by the Worthy and manipulates Walrus into thinking that he has been chosen to wield a magical hammer so that he can improve his security consolation business. However, his plan goes awry when the hammer turns out to be the property of the Moon-Born, a group of werewolves. The hammer exhibits special properties under the full moon which Deadpool discovers when he engages the Walrus in battle. Deadpool tricks Walrus into entering the windowless basement of a sheriff&#x27;s office where the hammer became powerless and he could take advantage of the sheriff&#x27;s weapon&#x27;s cache.

Walrus partners again with White Rabbit as well as the new Goldbug for a plan that involves tampering with New York City&#x27;s drinking water. The three are defeated by Spider-Woman and taken to a new supervillain prison, the Cellar, which is secretly run by Regent. Once incarcerated, Walrus and Ox are separated from the other prisoners and seemingly killed when they are sealed in power-siphoning tubes by Regent&#x27;s servant Dr. Shannon Stillwell. Walrus survives and is later released after Regent&#x27;s defeat.

He was later subsequently abducted and placed in Murderworld by Arcade, alongside other captives. Walrus was later rescued by Gwenpool with the help of Deadpool.

During the &quot;Hunted&quot; storyline, Walrus is among the animal-themed characters that are captured by Taskmaster and Black Ant for Kraven the Hunter&#x27;s Great Hunt that is sponsored by Arcade&#x27;s company Arcade Industries. Walrus watches the fight between Spider-Man and Scorpion until the Hunter-Bots created by Arcade Industries arrive. Walrus runs from the Hunter-Bots when the Great Hunt begins.

==Powers and abilities==
Hubert Carpenter has claimed to have the proportionate speed, strength, and agility of a walrus. The Walrus possesses some measure of superhuman strength, agility and endurance. He was actually able to hit Spider-Man with sufficient force to knock him flying, rip a metal lamp post in half and withstand razor sharp and explosive carrots fired at him by the White Rabbit as a test. However, on another occasion, Spider-Man was able to defeat the Walrus by flicking him with his index finger, which knocked him out. The Walrus also has the (unintended) ability to distract his enemies by making them laugh uncontrollably with his stupid remarks.

The Walrus was mutagenically altered by his uncle with walrus DNA which would presumably add certain walrus characteristics to his physiology, such as a layer of blubber to keep him warm in freezing water and the ability to hold his breath for a much longer time than a human. While none of these abilities would be very useful to a supervillain who never goes anywhere near water, the layer of blubber could explain his resistance to injury.

The Walrus was noticeably unintelligent but was unusually good at crossword puzzles.

==Reception==
* In 2022, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Walrus 6th in their &quot;Spider-Man&#x27;s 10 Funniest Villains&quot; list.

== Names and etymology ==

The first written mention of Vrakuňa was in 1279 as a village named Werekne. Some other recorded medieval names are Verekene (1290), Frecendorf (1297), Verekuna (1323), Oluerekenye (1356), Berekenye in theutonico Fratedorf (1393) or Vraknye (1459).

The name is probably derived from a Proto-Slavic appelative &quot;*vrakunъ&quot;, potentially reflecting Pre-Christian (pagan) rituals. The stem &quot;vra-&quot; means &quot;to speak without making any sense&quot;, &quot;vrakúň&quot; – a wizzard, preserved in Russian as вракун/vrakun – a liar, a gossip). Lajos Kiss (1988) tried to drive the name from Proto-Slavic &quot;*vir-&quot; (a whirl). Šimon Ondruš (1990) from Proto-Slavic &quot;*vorkъ&quot; (in East Slavic languages: &quot;vorok&quot; - a fence, a barrier) like Vorkonъ, Vorkunovka and other similar names, but documented only for the East Slavs.

==History==
Vrakuňa became an official borough of Bratislava on January 1, 1972.

<doc id="1285878" wikidata="Q969401" url="?curid=1285878" title="Micheal Ray Richardson">
<text>Micheal Ray Richardson (born April 11, 1955) is an American former professional basketball player and head coach. He played college basketball for the Montana Grizzlies. The No. 4 overall pick in the 1978 NBA draft, Richardson played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for eight years with the New York Knicks, Golden State Warriors and New Jersey Nets. He was a four-time NBA All-Star, and led the league in steals in three seasons. He later became a head coach in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) and National Basketball League of Canada (NBL Canada).

==Early life==
Richardson was born in Lubbock, Texas, the son of Billy Jack Richardson and Luddie Hicks. Richardson was a 1974 graduate of Manual High School in Denver, Colorado. He averaged 10 points on a talented team and did not start for the varsity team until he was a senior. Richardson played on the 1972 state championship team.

==College career==
Richardson played collegiately at the University of Montana. He was recruited to the Big Sky Conference school by Hall of Fame Coach Jud Heathcote after Richardson&#x27;s Denver basketball friend David Berry had visited the school.

As a freshman in 1974-1975 Montana went 21-8 and qualified for the 1975 NCAA Division I Basketball Tournament, as Richardson averaged 7.5 points and 3.6 rebounds. The Grizzlies defeated Utah State 79–63, before losing to the eventual National Champion UCLA Bruins 67–64. Montana then lost to UNLV in the regional 3rd place game.

Richardson averaged 18.2 points, 6.3 rebounds and 3.8 assists as a sophomore in 1975–1976, as Montana finished 13–12. After the season, Coach Heathcote left for Michigan State University, where he would win the 1979 NCAA title.

Under Coach Jim Brandenburg, who had been an assistant under Heathcote, Richardson averaged 19.2 points, 8.6 rebounds and 3.6 assists as Montana finished 18–8 in 1976–1977.

As a senior, Richardson averaged 24.2 points and 6.9 rebounds in 1977–1978, and Montana finished 20–8, capturing the Big Sky regular-season title.

In his Montana career, Richardson averaged 17.1 points, 6.3 rebounds and 3.7 assists on 49% shooting in 107 career games. Richardson was First team All-Big Sky Conference as a sophomore, junior and senior.

Today, Richardson still shares the Montana single-game scoring record of 40 points, and holds the single-game record for field goals of 18 and the single-season scoring average record of 24.2. Richardson is third on the Montana career assists list (372), second in career scoring (1,827 points) and ninth in career rebounding.
==Professional career==

===New York Knicks (1978–1982)===
The New York Knicks drafted Richardson with the fourth overall pick in the 1978 NBA draft, and he was billed as &quot;the next Walt Frazier.&quot; Two picks later, the Boston Celtics drafted future Hall of Famer Larry Bird. In his second year, Richardson became the third player in NBA history (Slick Watts – 1976, Don Buse – 1977) to lead the league in both assists (10.1) and steals (3.2), setting the Knicks&#x27; franchise records in both categories. He also recorded 18 triple-doubles, the second-most in franchise history. During the 1980-81 NBA season, Richardson made his second All-Star game, scoring 11 points, grabbing 5 rebounds, and recording 4 steals in a 123-120 Eastern Conference victory. The Knicks eventually finished 50-32 and Richardson made the playoffs for the first time in his career. However, in the first round, Richardson, who averaged 11.5 points, 9.5 rebounds, 5.5 assists, and 3.5 steals per game in the series, and the Knicks lost in an upset to the Reggie Theus-led Chicago Bulls. The following season, on November 27, 1981, Richardson scored his highest single game total as a Knick, with 33 points in a 116–95 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers.

===Golden State Warriors (1982–1983)===
At the beginning of the 1982–83 season, on October 22, 1982, Richardson was traded to the Golden State Warriors (along with a fifth-round draft choice) in exchange for Bernard King. On February 5, 1983, Richardson recorded a double-double with 10 points and 11 assists, while adding 9 steals, in a 106–102 win over the San Antonio Spurs. After playing only 33 games for the Warriors, Richardson was traded to the New Jersey Nets in exchange for Sleepy Floyd and Mickey Johnson on February 6, 1983.

===New Jersey Nets (1983–1986)===
In the 1984 playoffs, Richardson led the Nets to a shocking upset of the defending champion Philadelphia 76ers. In the fifth and deciding game, he scored 24 points and had six steals. In the following series, against the Milwaukee Bucks, Richardson led the Nets to a Game 4 victory with a team high 24 points. However, the Nets would ultimately lose the series in six games. In 1985, Richardson was named the NBA Comeback Player of the Year after averaging 20.1 points and leading the league in steals while playing all 82 games, after only playing 48 games in the prior season due to rehabilitating from substance abuse. On October 30, 1985, Richardson barely missed a quadruple-double when he scored 38 points, grabbed 11 rebounds, recorded 11 assists, and stole the ball 9 times, during a 147–138 win over the Indiana Pacers. Richardson wore Leather Converse All Stars briefly with the Nets, making him the last to wear the shoe in any form in the NBA.

In 556 career NBA games, Richardson averaged 14.8 points, 5.5 rebounds, 7.0 assists and 2.6 steals. In 18 career playoff games, he averaged 15.7 points, 7.2 rebounds, 5.5 assists and 2.8 steals.

===NBA ban===
On February 25, 1986, Richardson was banned for life by NBA commissioner David Stern for three violations of the league&#x27;s drug policy. He regained the right to play in the NBA in 1988, but decided to continue his career in Europe. He never played in the NBA again.

Richardson bitterly complained that the suspensions he received from the NBA were unfair given the fact that Chris Mullin was never disciplined by the league for his alcohol problem, implying that this &quot;double standard&quot; existed because of racism.

=== Long Island Knights (1986–1987) ===
Richardson played with the Long Island Knights of United States Basketball League in 1986–87.

=== Albany Patroons (1987–1988) ===
Richardson played with the Albany Patroons of the CBA in 1987–88, before playing for 14 seasons in Europe.

=== Europe (1988–2002) ===
In 1988, Richardson signed with Virtus Bologna, a prominent European team, with which he won the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1990. Richardson played for KK Split (1991–1992), Baker Livorno (1992–1994), Olympique Antibes (1994–1997), Cholet Basket (1997–1998) and Montana Forlì (1998–1999). Richardson played for Basket Livorno (1999–2000), Olympique Antibes again (2001) and finally, AC Golfe-Juan-Vallauris (2002) at age 47.

Richardson won the European-wide second-tier level FIBA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, in the 1989–90 season with Virtus Bologna. He won the LNB Pro A championship with Olympique Antibes in 1995.

==Coaching career==

=== Albany Patroons (2004–2007) ===
On December 14, 2004, he was named head coach of the Albany Patroons in the CBA. Richardson had previously played with Albany in 1987–1988, when it won its second CBA championship under Coach Bill Musselman.

==== Supposed anti-Semitic and homophobic comments ====
On March 28, 2007, Richardson was suspended for the remainder of the CBA championship series for comments in an interview with the &quot;Albany Times Union&quot; , in which he stated that Jews were &quot;crafty (because) they are hated worldwide.&quot; The paper also reported that Richardson directed expletives at a heckler, using profanity and an anti-gay slur, at Game 1 of the championship series.

Some sportswriters came to Richardson&#x27;s defense, in the wake of the incident. Peter Vecsey questioned the &quot;Times Union&quot;&#x27;s motives in not releasing the audio recording of their exchange with Richardson. Vecsey noted that during the course of his professional dealings with Richardson, he found the player to be &quot;so unsettled, so unsophisticated and so pliable anybody could draw him into saying anything about anything at any time.&quot; He also pointed out that Richardson&#x27;s second wife was Jewish, as was their daughter, Tamara, something that would be unlikely for a true anti-Semite. Christopher Isenberg, a Jewish writer who had earlier profiled Richardson for the &quot;Village Voice&quot; also defended Richardson&#x27;s remarks about Jews, stating in a blog post entitled &quot;Jews for Micheal Ray,&quot;

Micheal Ray is proud to have a Jewish lawyer because he thinks they are the best lawyers. Certainly it&#x27;s a stereotype, but it&#x27;s a stereotype rooted in a reality. A disproportionate number of the great lawyers in America are Jews. A disproportionate number of the great basketball players in America are black. We have learned to be very careful around these facts because here the line between fact and &quot;stereotype&quot; can get very blurry and if you&#x27;re not careful, you can get into deep water real quick. Micheal Ray was unwise to have been so indiscreet around reporters, but it wasn&#x27;t exactly Elders of Zion territory. 

NBA commissioner David Stern, who was Jewish, voiced support for Richardson. While conceding that the remarks about homosexuals were &quot;inappropriate and insensitive&quot; and worthy of a suspension, Stern said, &quot;I have no doubt that Micheal Ray is not anti-Semitic. I know that he&#x27;s not...He may have exercised very poor judgment, but that does not reflect Micheal Ray Richardson&#x27;s feelings about Jews.&quot;

Ze&#x27;ev Chafets, author of &quot;A Match Made in Heaven: American Jews, Christian Zionists and One Man&#x27;s Exploration of the Weird and Wonderful Judeo-Evangelical Alliance&quot;, wrote in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that Richardson&#x27;s comments, while perhaps stereotypical, were not anti-semitic. After discussing Richardson&#x27;s claim that Jews are &quot;crafty,&quot; Chafets stated,

What other hurtful things did Richardson supposedly say? That Israel has the best airport security in the world? This is both true and something Israel itself brags about. That Jews are hated and need to protect themselves? That&#x27;s the founding premise of the Anti-Defamation League itself ... Richardson, who was a popular player in Israel during his NBA exile years, is guilty of nothing more than free speech. Even if his observations were wrong--which they are not--there&#x27;s nothing at all insulting about them. What is insulting is the notion that you can&#x27;t speak honestly about Jews without getting into trouble.

=== Oklahoma / Lawton-Fort Sill Cavalry (2007–2011) ===
On May 24, 2007, Richardson was named head coach of the reincarnated Oklahoma Cavalry of the CBA. On December 16, 2007, he was fired by the Cavalry, for sticking up for his players when their paychecks bounced, but rehired the next season.

Richardson coached for the relocated Lawton-Ft Sill Cavalry located in Lawton, Oklahoma, winning three consecutive championships in 2008–2010. Richardson led the Cavalry to victory to the Continental Basketball Association Finals in 2008 and 2009 and in the Premiere Basketball League Finals in 2010.

Richardson was ejected from the first game of the 2010 Premiere Basketball League Championship Series. The ejection took place with under three seconds remaining in the game that was eventually won by Rochester in overtime 110–106. The ejection led to a skirmish between fans and several Lawton-Fort Sill players which ended the game with 2.6 seconds to go on the clock and Rochester about to go to the free-throw line.

=== London Lightning (2011–2014) ===
On August 17, 2011, Richardson was hired as the first head coach of NBL Canada&#x27;s London Lightning. Richardson was named the NBL Canada&#x27;s first ever Coach of the Month for November 2011, an award he would win again in January 2012. London finished the regular season at 28–8. On March 25, 2012, Richardson led the Lightning to a 116–92 victory over the Halifax Rainmen in the deciding Game Five of the NBL Canada Finals to win the NBL Canada&#x27;s inaugural championship. After the game, Richardson was named the NBL Canada Coach of the Year for 2011–12.

On April 12, 2013, Richardson led the London to an 87–80 victory over the Summerside Storm and TLondon became back to back NBL champions.

Richardson left the London Lightning following the 2013–14 season to pursue coaching positions closer to home.

<text>The Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum is a presidential library in Hyde Park, New York. Located on the grounds of Springwood, the Roosevelt family estate, it holds the records of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 32nd president of the United States (1933–1945). The library was built under the President&#x27;s personal direction in 1939–1940, and dedicated on June 30, 1941. It is the first presidential library in the United States and one of the thirteen presidential libraries under the auspices of the National Archives and Records Administration.

==History==
Roosevelt was both an avid collector of memorabilia and amateur historian. As a then two-term president who had presided over a sweeping and dramatic phase of the nation&#x27;s history during the Great Depression, he recognized the need for a facility to house the vast quantity of historical papers, books, and memorabilia he had accumulated during a lifetime of public service and private collecting.

The library he subsequently commissioned was built by Philadelphia contractor John McShain, on of land donated by Roosevelt and his mother, Sara.

Margaret Suckley, who acted as Roosevelt&#x27;s personal archivist during his life, was involved in the establishment of the library and served as its archivist for its first two decades.

===Setting a precedent===
Prior to Roosevelt&#x27;s presidency, the final disposition of Presidential papers was left to chance. Although a valued part of the nation&#x27;s heritage, the papers of chief executives were private property which they took with them upon leaving office. Some were sold or destroyed, while others remained with families but inaccessible to scholars for long periods of time. Ultimately some collections found their way into the Library of Congress and private repositories.

Franklin D. Roosevelt changed this pattern, by becoming the first president to make his papers available to the public by donating them intact to the government. These covered both all his public service, as New York state senator (1911–13), assistant secretary of the Navy (1913–20), governor of New York (1929–32), and President of the United States (1933–45), and his private collections of papers, books, and memorabilia on the history of the U.S. Navy and Dutchess County, New York.

===Location and buildings===
The Library sits on the grounds of the Roosevelt family&#x27;s Hyde Park estate. It is built of Hudson Valley fieldstone in the style reminiscent of the local Dutch colonial architecture which he favored. A sketch made by President Roosevelt dated April 12, 1937, shows the proposed building placed very close to the site ultimately chosen, and a ground plan roughly approximating that of the main block today.

The building was designed by principal architect Louis A. Simon and consulting architect Henry J. Toombs based on his sketches by Roosevelt himself It was built with privately donated funds, at a cost of $376,000, and turned-over to the federal government on July 4, 1940, to be operated by the National Archives.

Said Robert D.W. Connor, the first Archivist of the United States, of the President making his papers openly available to scholars, &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt is the nation&#x27;s answer to the historian&#x27;s prayer.&quot;

The facility was already overcrowded when completed in 1940, because Roosevelt did not expect to serve as president for more than two terms. A 1950 estimate stated that the library contained 50 million items, including 16,000 books, 15,000 photographs, of movie film, and 300 sound recordings.

The library underwent a full-scale renovation in the 21st century, its first, reopening on June 30, 2013. Funded by a combination of public support and private donations, the multi-million dollar renovation included expanded exhibit space, HVAC updates, and research room improvements. Members of the Roosevelt family and the historian Geoffrey Ward spoke at a re-dedication ceremony that day.

===Other archives===
In early planning for the library the President expressed the hope that Eleanor Roosevelt&#x27;s papers would eventually find a place here. In 1942 President Roosevelt made a rough sketch for wings to be added on to the north and south sides of the building should additional space be needed for her papers. At the time of her death in 1962 Mrs. Roosevelt&#x27;s papers totaled three million pages.

During her tenure at the library (1961–1969), Elizabeth B. Drewry raised funds for the wings to house Eleanor Roosevelt&#x27;s papers. Construction was completed in 1972.

The library contains the donated papers of others associated with Roosevelt, such as Henry Morgenthau Jr.&#x27;s diary of 840 volumes.

==Presidential Libraries Act==
Using Roosevelt&#x27;s actions as a precedent, Congress passed the Presidential Libraries Act in 1955. It regularized the procedures for privately built and federally maintained libraries to preserve the papers of future presidents; all of the presidents from Herbert Hoover to George W. Bush have a presidential center overseen by the National Archives.

Official presidential papers became public property as a result of the Presidential Records Act of 1978, backed by legislation limiting the size and financing of presidential museums.

==Museum==

Roosevelt hoped the library would become an important research center and attract visitors to the museum. The museum section of the building opened June 30, 1941. However, the onset of World War II changed Roosevelt&#x27;s plans, and the official opening of the library as a research facility was deferred as the president served a third term and then was elected to a fourth term in 1944. He visited the library often during the war to sort and classify his records and memorabilia; and from his study in the library he delivered several of his famous War-era radio speeches or &quot;fireside chats&quot;.

President Roosevelt paid his last visit to Hyde Park in March 1945 and died on April 12 at Warm Springs, Georgia, at age sixty-three.

<doc id="1285895" wikidata="Q30824875" url="?curid=1285895" title="Murder of Kriss Donald">
<text>Kriss Donald (2 July 1988 – 15 March 2004) was a 15-year-old white Scottish teenager who was kidnapped and murdered in Glasgow in 2004 by a gang of five men of Pakistani origin, some of whom fled to Pakistan after the crime. Daanish Zahid, Imran Shahid, Zeeshan Shahid and Mohammed Faisal Mustaq were later found guilty of racially motivated murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. A fifth man, Zahid Mohammed, pleaded guilty to kidnapping, assault and lying to police and was sentenced to five years in prison. He later went on to testify against the other four at their trials.

The case featured the first-ever conviction for racially motivated murder in Scotland.

==Kidnapping and murder==
On 15 March 2004, Donald was abducted from Kenmure Street in the Pollokshields area of Glasgow by five men associated with a local British Pakistani gang led by Imran Shahid. The kidnapping was ostensibly revenge for an attack on Shahid at a nightclub in Glasgow city centre the night before by a local white gang, and Donald was chosen as an example of a &quot;white boy from the McCulloch Street area&quot; despite having no involvement in the nightclub attack or in any gang activity.

Donald was taken on a journey to Dundee and back while his kidnappers made phone calls looking for a house to take him to. Having no success at this, they returned to Glasgow and took him to the Clyde Walkway, near Celtic Football Club&#x27;s training ground. There, they held his arms (ascertained due to an absence of defensive wounds) and stabbed him multiple times. He sustained internal injuries to three arteries, one of his lungs, his liver and a kidney. He was doused in petrol and set on fire as he bled to death.

==Arrests and first trials==
Initially, two men were arrested in connection with the crime. One man, Daanish Zahid, was found guilty of Kriss Donald&#x27;s murder on 18 November 2004 and was the first person to be convicted of racially motivated murder in Scotland. Another man, Zahid Mohammed, admitted involvement in the abduction of Donald and lying to police during their investigation and was imprisoned for five years. He was released after serving half of his sentence and returned to court to give evidence against three subsequent defendants.


==Special extradition and later trial==
Three suspects were arrested in Pakistan in July 2005 and extradited to the UK in October 2005, following the intervention of Mohammed Sarwar, the Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow Central.

The Pakistani police had to engage in a &quot;long struggle&quot; to capture two of the escapees. There is no extradition treaty between Pakistan and Britain, but the Pakistani authorities agreed to extradite the suspects. There were numerous diplomatic complications around the case, including apparent divergences between government activities and those of ambassadorial officials; government figures were at times alleged to be reluctant to pursue the case for diplomatic reasons.

The three extradited suspects, Imran Shahid, Zeeshan Shahid, and Mohammed Faisal Mushtaq, all in their late twenties, arrived in Scotland on 5 October 2005. They were charged with Donald&#x27;s murder the following day. Their trial opened on 2 October 2006.

On 8 November 2006, the three men were found guilty of the racially motivated murder of Kriss Donald. All three had denied the charge, but a jury at the High Court in Edinburgh convicted them of abduction and murder. Each of the killers received sentences of life imprisonment, with Imran Shahid given a 25-year minimum term, Zeeshan Shahid a 23-year minimum and Mushtaq receiving a recommended minimum of 22 years.

== Controversies surrounding the case ==

===Lack of media coverage===
The BBC has been criticised by some viewers because the case featured on national news only three times and the first trial was later largely confined to regional Scottish bulletins including the verdict itself. In preference to reporting the verdict the organisation found the time to report the opening of a new arts centre in Gateshead in its running order.
The BBC again faced criticisms for its failure to cover the second trial in its main bulletins, waiting until day 18 to mention the issue and Peter Horrocks of the BBC apologised for the organisation&#x27;s further failings. Although admitting that the BBC had &quot;got it wrong&quot;, the organisation&#x27;s Head of Newsgathering, Fran Unsworth, chose to deny the suggestion that Donald&#x27;s race played a part in the lack of reportage, instead claiming it was mostly a product of &quot;Scottish blindness&quot;.

Peter Fahy, spokesman of race issues for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said that &quot;it was a fact that it was harder to get the media interested where murder victims were young white men&quot;.

===Police response===
A March 2004 article in &quot;The Scotsman&quot; newspaper alleged a lack of response by authorities to concerns of rising racial tensions and that Strathclyde Police had felt pressured to abandon Operation Gather, an investigation into Asian gangs in the area, for fear of offending ethnic minorities. In a January 2005 interview with a Scottish newspaper, prominent Pakistani Glaswegian Bashir Maan claimed that &quot;fear and intimidation&quot; had allowed problems with Asian gangs in some parts of the city to go unchecked. The article also quoted a former senior Strathclyde police officer who criticised &quot;a culture of political correctness&quot; which had allowed gang crime to &quot;grow unfettered&quot;.

==Tributes==
Glasgow band Glasvegas wrote the song &quot;Flowers &amp; Football Tops&quot; having been inspired by the tragedy and the likely effect it would have on the victim&#x27;s parents. The band dedicated their 2008 Philip Hall Radar NME award win to Donald&#x27;s memory.

A memorial plaque was installed on a bench beside the River Clyde, near to where he was killed, in memory of Donald. In addition, a memorial plaque was placed on a public fence in Pollokshields close to the spot where he was kidnapped; in July 2018, friends and family gathered at the spot to remember him on what would have been his 30th birthday.

==Commentary==
Journalist Mark Easton cites the racist murders of Donald and also Ross Parker to argue that society has been forced to redefine racism and discard the definition of &quot;prejudice plus power&quot;, a definition which only allowed ethnic minorities to be victims of hate crime. Yasmin Alibhai-Brown also cites the Donald case to highlight what she describes as lack of concern for white victims of racist murders. She compares Donald to high-profile ethnic minority victims, asking whether Donald&#x27;s murderers were &quot;less evil&quot; than Stephen Lawrence&#x27;s killers. Alibhai-Brown argues that treating &quot;some victims as more worthy of condemnation than others is unforgivable—and a betrayal of anti-racism itself&quot;.

==Conduct of accused==
Following their convictions, the killers – particularly Imran Shahid, due to his reputation and distinctive appearance – continued to draw attention for events that occurred inside the prison system. From the time of their remand in 2005, it was known to the authorities that other prisoners had particular intent to attack the accused, and an incident at HMP Barlinnie prompted Imran Shahid to be placed in solitary confinement, a practice which continued regularly until 2010, due to the continual threat of violence against him, and the aggressive behaviour he showed when he did come into contact with others. He appealed against this measure as a breach of his human rights, which was rejected in 2011 and in 2014 but upheld in October 2015 by the UK Supreme Court. It was found that prison rules had not been correctly adhered to in the application for, or extension of, some periods totalling 14 months of his 56 months of detention, but that overall, the reasons for keeping him in solitary confinement for his own safety were valid. He was not offered any financial compensation, which he had tried to claim.

Shahid was attacked twice (the second incident, in which a fellow murderer struck him with a barbell weight in the gym at HMP Kilmarnock in 2013, caused serious injury) and also attacked another prisoner with a barbell, for which he was sentenced to additional jail time in March 2016; he had received a concurrent sentence for violence in 2009 after being racially abused by another prisoner. Shahid also received media attention for cases he brought against the prison service governors in 2017 for unlawful removal of his possessions (a &#x27;penis pump&#x27; for erectile dysfunction which was deemed to have negligible medical benefit, and an Xbox games console which it was believed could have been adjusted to access the internet), which were dismissed.

Zahid Mohammed, who later changed his name to Yusef Harris to avoid connection to the murder, was convicted and imprisoned in 2017 for another separate incident involving weapons, threats and driving his vehicle at police.

<text>John William Volek (born April 28, 1976) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Fresno State Bulldogs. He was signed by the Tennessee Titans as an undrafted free agent in 2000 and also played for the San Diego Chargers.

==Early life==
Volek attended Clovis West High School in Fresno, California, and was a letterman in football. In football, as a senior, he was named the Northwest Yosemite League Offensive Player of the Year. He then went to Fresno State, where he led the Bulldogs to a Western Athletic Conference title in 1999 and set the NCAA record for career lowest percentage of passes intercepted.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==

===Tennessee Titans===
Volek was signed by the Tennessee Titans in 2000 from free agency, after not being selected by any team in the 2000 NFL draft. He would see very little action during his rookie season, completing 0 of his 3 passes with no touchdowns and no interceptions. After such a small amount of play time, he would not be seen on the field again until the 2003 season, where he would make a name for himself as one of the National Football League&#x27;s more talented backup quarterbacks.

In 2004, he became only the fourth quarterback in NFL history—along with Dan Marino, Dan Fouts, and Phil Simms—to pass for over 400 yards in two consecutive games, a feat that was also accomplished in 2008 by New England Patriots quarterback Matt Cassel, in 2011 by Tom Brady and Cam Newton, in 2018 by Ryan Fitzpatrick, and in 2022 by Joe Burrow. It was announced on December 17, 2004, that he would be the starting quarterback for the rest of the season for the Titans, replacing the injured Steve McNair. McNair&#x27;s injuries healed in time for the next season, and Volek backed him up once again, starting only 1 game. McNair was later traded to the Baltimore Ravens during June 2006, allowing Volek the opportunity to truly earn the starting position.

In late August 2006, coach Jeff Fisher announced that the Titans intended to sign Kerry Collins to compete with Volek for the starting quarterback job. In turn, it has been reported that Volek took issue with this decision and immediately asked to be considered for a trade.

===San Diego Chargers===
On September 19, 2006, Volek was traded to the San Diego Chargers for a conditional sixth round pick in the 2007 NFL draft after the Titans played the Chargers in their second game. Titans coach Jeff Fisher has since publicly stated that Volek was untruthful with him and that this may have led to his eventual trade. Fisher was quoted as saying &quot;He was untruthful with me, untruthful with his head coach, about where he was and what he was doing. So we started off on the wrong page there, and that did not sit well with me.&quot; The trade as a whole is considered to have been messy, and although he has criticized Volek for lying to him, Fisher has not revealed what the lie was, and instead also states that Volek never took advantage of his opportunities once told he was the starter. Many critics state that Volek took full advantage of his chances to become the starting quarterback, pointing towards the reasonably good preseason that the Titans had.

Since the trade to San Diego in 2006, Volek saw spot duty behind Philip Rivers. During the AFC Divisional Playoff game against the Indianapolis Colts on January 13, 2008, Volek replaced the injured Philip Rivers and led a fourth-quarter comeback over the defending champions. He completed 3 of his 4 passes, including a 15-yard pass on his second pass attempt. He also scored his first touchdown of the year on a one-yard quarterback sneak which allowed the Chargers to win the game, 28–24, and go to the 2007 AFC Championship Game against the New England Patriots.

On February 29, 2008, Volek signed a three-year contract with San Diego. On July 30, 2011, Volek signed a two-year contract with the Chargers.

Volek was released on March 16, 2012. He announced his retirement on KMJNow News Talk Radio Show in May 2012.

<text>James &quot;Bonecrusher&quot; Smith (born April 3, 1953) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1981 to 1999 and held the WBA heavyweight title from 1986 to 1987.

==Early life==
Smith was born in Magnolia, North Carolina. After graduating from high school, he attended James Sprunt Community College in Kenansville, North Carolina. He earned an associate&#x27;s degree in business administration in 1973. Two years later, he got a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration from Shaw University in Raleigh.

==Amateur career==
After serving in the U.S. military and working as a prison guard, Smith competed as an amateur boxer, compiling a record of 35–4 [1] before turning professional in November 1981.

==Professional career==
He lost his first fight against James &quot;Broad-Axe&quot; Broad, a world-class amateur and qualifier for the 1980 Olympics who was 2–0 as a pro. The fight was broadcast on ESPN. Smith was dropped in 4 rounds with body shots and counted out.

The following year Smith upset future cruiserweight world champion and southpaw Ricky Parkey, then 2–0 as a pro, by winning a 6-round points decision. After scoring two knockouts, Smith followed up the Parkey win with another upset: an 8-round points decision over Chris McDonald, who was 8–0–1 as a pro and had been a top amateur. He went on to score nine straight knockouts, before traveling to the UK in 1984, where he fought and knocked out Frank Bruno, who was 21–0 (21 KO).

In November 1984, he fought Larry Holmes for the IBF heavyweight championship. Holmes had a record of 45–0 and won eighteen straight world title fights. Smith was stopped on advice of the doctor in the 12th round, due to a severe cut, and was behind on points again. He had Holmes in trouble from rounds five to seven.

Smith came back in 1985, fighting on Don King undercards. He lost a 10-round decision to 19–0 amateur star and future world champ Tony Tubbs in an eliminator, won a 10-round decision over 18–1 Cuban contender José Ribalta, then dropped a wide 12-round decision to ex-world champ Tim Witherspoon in a bid for Witherspoon&#x27;s NABF belt.

In 1986 he dropped Marvis Frazier, including breaking Frazier&#x27;s jaw, but lost the 10-round decision. At this time, Bonecrusher began consulting a psychiatrist. In his next fight he beat ex-world champ Mike Weaver in one round. He followed it up with two 10-round decisions over Jesse Ferguson (14–2) and David Bey (15–2).

===WBA Heavyweight Champion===

In December 1986, while preparing for a fight with Mitch &quot;Blood&quot; Green, Don King informed him at short notice that Tony Tubbs had dropped out of his upcoming challenge to WBA champ Tim Witherspoon, and now Smith would be getting a rematch with Witherspoon. He dropped Witherspoon three times in the opening round, scoring a first-round knockout and winning the WBA title in an upset.

With his victory over Witherspoon, Smith took his place in the heavyweight unification series, an ongoing competition being conducted by HBO and King to crown an undisputed world heavyweight champion for the first time since the retirement of Muhammad Ali. The victory garnered Smith another fight, where he was to defend his belt against newly crowned WBC champion Mike Tyson in a unification contest. Taking place on March 7, 1987, the bout saw Tyson beat Smith to the punch in nearly every round, while Smith resorted to holding to keep himself in the fight. The decision saw Smith lose eleven rounds on two scorecards and all twelve on another.

===Final years===
Smith returned to the ring for a few months, taking on Brazilian contender Adilson &quot;Maguila&quot; Rodrigues in São Paulo and losing by split decision.

In 1989, now aged 36, he took on the Jamaican-Canadian Donovan (Razor) Ruddock. Ruddock won by knockout in the 7th round and Smith announced his retirement afterwards, declaring he would pursue politics.

Smith was back in the ring only two months later, KOing journeyman Calvin Jones, followed by three more knockouts before being matched with former victim Mike Weaver in a battle of hard hitting ex-champs. This time, Smith was resigned to having to win a dull 12-round points decision over Weaver, although he did score a knockdown in a brief moment of excitement. He also earned the WBA Americas belt and a world ranking.

After a year-long layoff he was back, now aged 38, and scored six knockouts. Achievements included a notable 8-round knockout of the cement-skulled journeyman Everett &quot;Bigfoot&quot; Martin (who had just taken George Foreman the distance) and a first-round knockout of Jeff Sims.

Smith lost his world ranking and all his momentum in November 1991 when he dropped a shocking 10-round decision to club fighter Levi Billups who had a patchy 15–5 record. Smith looked under-prepared as he was banged around and generally outhustled by Billups. Smith rallied to knock down the underdog in the 9th; however, it was too little too late.

Still active in 1992, now aged 39 and with a 33–9–1 record, Smith regained some credibility with a 10-round decision over Mark Wills. His old agitator Don King gave him another opportunity on one of his undercards and matched him with warhorse Greg Page, in a battle of two ex-champs. In the opening round, Bonecrusher tried to rush Page as he had done Witherspoon; however, Smith was decked for his efforts and outpunched by Page over the 10 round distance.

In 1993 Smith lost to undefeated southpaw and #1 contender Michael Moorer. The paying audience jeered the two passive fighters through to the 10 round finish, where Smith lost a lopsided decision.

Smith competed in the One-Night Heavyweight Tournament in Bay St Louis (not included in the official record, counted as show), where a group of heavies of varying quality would fight a series of 3 round fights with the winner being awarded one million dollars. He beat Lester Jackson and Marshall Tillman, before losing in the semi-final to Romanian prospect Daniel Dăncuţă. Smith&#x27;s old buddy Tony (TNT) Tubbs eventually won the tournament.

In 1994 Smith was matched with power punching, Tyson-lookalike Lionel Butler, who was highly ranked and on a red-hot string of knockouts. Smith collapsed in 3 rounds with little resistance.

Later that year he traveled to Europe to drop a points decision to German Axel Schulz, and in Denmark he was stopped in 5 rounds due to a cut from a headbutt by Brian Nielsen. Smith was overweight for both fights and his days as a contender dwindled.

He fought on and off for a few more years. In 1998, he traveled to Australia to battle Joe Bugner for the WBF Heavyweight Championship, but had to retire after one round when his shoulder dislocated. The same injury ended a fight in 1999 with former world champion Larry Holmes. After this loss, Smith retired at the age of 46, touting a record of 44–17–1 (32 KOs).

In 1995, Smith helped establish the North Carolina Boxing Commission and served as the first chairman.

==Life after boxing==
Smith became an ordained minister in 1996 and dedicated his life to helping young people stay clear of crime and drugs. Three years later, he retired from boxing.

In 2004 Smith started the non-profit Champion For Kids Inc. to provide scholarships to high school students.

Smith began working as a recruiter and the Director of Intramural Athletics for Sandhills Community College in June 2005.

Deeply committed to helping impoverished fighters, Smith was a guest at the Ring 10 Veterans Boxing Foundation 2nd Annual Fundraiser in 2012, where he expressed his support of initiatives to better provide for those in need.

Smith is currently working with organizers to establish the Legends of Boxing Hall of Fame in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

<text>A geometry template is a piece of clear plastic with cut-out shapes for use in mathematics and other subjects in primary school through secondary school. It also has various measurements on its sides to be used like a ruler. In Australia, popular brands include Mathomat and MathAid.

==Brands==
===Mathomat and Mathaid===
Mathomat is a trademark used for a plastic stencil developed in Australia by Craig Young in 1969, who originally worked as an engineering tradesperson in the Government Aircraft Factories (GAF) in Melbourne before retraining and working as head of mathematics in a secondary school in Melbourne. Young designed Mathomat to address what he perceived as limitations of traditional mathematics drawing sets in classrooms, mainly caused by students losing parts of the sets. The Mathomat stencil has a large number of geometric shapes stencils combined with the functions of a technical drawing set (rulers, set squares, protractor and circles stencils to replace a compass). 

The template made use polycarbonate – a new type of thermoplastic polymer when Mathomat first came out – which was strong and transparent enough to allow for a large number of stencil shapes to be included in its design without breaking or tearing. The first template was exhibited in 1970 at a mathematics conference in Melbourne along with a series of popular mathematics teaching lesson plan; it became an immediate success with a large number of schools specifying it as a required students purchase. As of 2017, the stencil is widely specified in Australian schools, chiefly for students at early secondary school level. The manufacturing of Mathomat was taken over in 1989 by the W&amp;G drawing instrument company, which had a factory in Melbourne for manufacture of technical drawing instruments. Young also developed MathAid, which was initially produced by him when he was living in Ringwood, Victoria. He later sold the company.

W&amp;G published a series of teacher resource books for Mathomat authored by various teachers and academics who were interested in Mathomat as a teaching product.

<doc id="1285920" wikidata="Q1355040" url="?curid=1285920" title="Sir George Cockburn, 10th Baronet">
<text>Admiral of the Fleet Sir George Cockburn, 10th Baronet, (22 April 1772 – 19 August 1853) was a Royal Navy officer and politician. As a captain he was present at the Battle of Cape St Vincent in February 1797 during the French Revolutionary Wars and commanded the naval support at the invasion of Martinique in February 1809 during the Napoleonic Wars. 

He also directed the capture and Burning of Washington on 24 August 1814 as an advisor to Major General Robert Ross during the War of 1812. He went on to be First Naval Lord and in that capacity sought to improve the standards of gunnery in the fleet, forming a gunnery school at Portsmouth; later he ensured that the Navy had the latest steam and screw technology and put emphasis on the ability to manage seamen without the need to resort to physical punishment.

==Naval career==

Cockburn was born the second son of Sir James Cockburn, 8th Baronet and his second wife Augusta Anne Ayscough. He was educated at the Royal Navigational School and joined the Royal Navy in March 1781 as a Captain&#x27;s servant in the sixth-rate HMS &quot;Resource&quot;. He joined the sloop HMS &quot;Termagant&quot; in 1787, transferred to the sloop HMS &quot;Ariel&quot; under the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies in 1788, and then became midshipman in the fifth-rate HMS &quot;Hebe&quot; in the Channel Squadron in 1791. He joined the fourth-rate HMS &quot;Romney&quot; in the Mediterranean Fleet later in 1791 and then became acting lieutenant in the fifth-rate HMS &quot;Pearl&quot; in 1792. He was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant on 2 January 1793, and became lieutenant on the brig-sloop HMS &quot;Orestes&quot; later that month before transferring to the first-rate HMS &quot;Britannia&quot; in the Mediterranean Fleet in February 1793 and then to the first-rate HMS &quot;Victory&quot;, Flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet, in June 1793. He became commander of the sloop HMS &quot;Speedy&quot; in October 1793 and acting captain of the fifth-rate HMS &quot;Inconstant&quot; in January 1794.

Cockburn was promoted to the substantive rank of captain on 10 February 1794 and given command of the fifth-rate HMS &quot;Meleager&quot; in the Mediterranean Fleet later that month. He took part in the blockade of Livorno in March 1795, and he was given command of the frigate HMS &quot;Minerve&quot; in August 1796, having been mentioned in despatches in May 1796. He fought a gallant action with the Spanish frigate &quot;Santa Sabina&quot; in January 1797 and was present at the battle of Cape St Vincent in February 1797 during the French Revolutionary Wars.

&quot;Minerve&quot;″s boats&#x27; crews, in company with those of the frigate , successfully cut out the French ship &quot;Mutine&quot; at Santa Cruz, Tenerife in May 1797.

Cockburn was given command of the fifth-rate HMS &quot;Phaeton&quot; on the East Indies Station in July 1803, of the third-rate HMS &quot;Captain&quot; in July 1806, and of the third-rate HMS &quot;Pompée&quot; in March 1808. He commanded the naval support at the reduction of Martinique in February 1809 during the Napoleonic Wars, for which he received the thanks of Parliament.

Cockburn commanded a squadron of warships for the landings in Walcheren in July 1809 during the Walcheren Campaign. He took command of the third-rate HMS &quot;Implacable&quot; off the coast of Spain in January 1810 and sailed to Quiberon Bay with a small squadron whose mission was to arrange the escape of the King of Spain, whom the French had imprisoned at the Château de Valençay. The mission failed when Ferdinand refused to have anything to do with the British. Cockburn was promoted to commodore, hoisting his broad pennant in the fourth-rate HMS &quot;Grampus&quot; in November 1811.

===War of 1812===
Cockburn was promoted to rear admiral on 12 August 1812, and hoisted his flag in the third-rate HMS &quot;Marlborough&quot; as commander of a squadron of ships off Cadiz. He was reassigned in November 1812 to the North American Station, where he played a major role in the War of 1812 as second-in-command to Admiral Sir John Warren until the end of March 1814, and then to Warren&#x27;s successor Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane for the rest of the war.

He proceeded to lead forces which cruised up and down the Chesapeake Bay and other parts of the Atlantic coast in 1813 and 1814, seizing American merchant shipping, disrupting U.S. commerce, and raiding local ports. Warren &quot;had been waging a pretty tepid campaign on the Atlantic seaboard, and the Admiralty decided that he could use an aggressive subordinate&quot;. Cockburn&#x27;s prior military experience made him a suitable candidate for the role in the eyes of the Admiralty. Historian Steve Vogel compared Cockburn&#x27;s raids on U.S. interests along the Eastern Seaboard to Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea during the American Civil War. 
The most important of Cockburn&#x27;s involvements during the War was his role in the capture and burning of Washington on 24 August 1814, undertaken as an advisor to Major General Robert Ross. The plan to attack Washington had been formulated by Cockburn who accurately predicted that &quot;within a short period of time, with enough force, we could easily have at our mercy the capital&quot;. A CBC News article described General Ross as less optimistic than Cockburn, having &quot;never dreamt for one minute that an army of 3,500 men with 1,000 marines reinforcement, with no cavalry, hardly any artillery, could march 50 miles inland and capture an enemy capital&quot;.

Cockburn had reached Benedict, Maryland, via the Patuxent River with his warships; the troops then disembarked and marched to Washington to mount the attack. The 4,500 troops, commanded by Ross, successfully captured the capital city on 24 August 1814. Cockburn accompanied Ross and recommended burning the entire city. Ross decided instead to put only public buildings to the torch, including the White House and the United States Capitol, while sparing nearly all of the privately owned properties.

Following the battle, Cockburn oversaw the destruction of the National Intelligencer newspaper&#x27;s offices and printing house by his soldiers; he famously stated: &quot;Be sure that all the C&#x27;s are destroyed, so that the rascals cannot any longer abuse my name.&quot;

He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 4 January 1815.

===Subsequent years===
In August 1815, Cockburn was given the job of conveying Napoleon I in the third-rate HMS &quot;Northumberland&quot; to Saint Helena. Cockburn remained there for some months as governor of the island and Commander-in-Chief of the Cape of Good Hope Station. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 20 February 1818, and promoted to vice-admiral on 12 August 1819. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 21 December 1820.

==Political career==

Entering politics, Cockburn was elected Tory Member of Parliament for Portsmouth at the 1818 general election and was appointed a Junior Naval Lord in the Liverpool ministry in April 1818. He became Tory Member of Parliament for Weobly at the 1820 general election and, having become Major-General of the Royal Marine Forces on 5 April 1821 and a member of the Privy Council on 30 April 1827, he was elected Tory Member of Parliament for Plymouth at a by-election in June 1828. While serving as a Junior Naval Lord, he forced the resignation of the Duke of Clarence as Lord High Admiral in September 1828 for acting without the authority of the Board of the Admiralty. Cockburn was elevated to First Naval Lord in the Wellington ministry in September 1828 and in that capacity sought to improve the standards of gunnery in the fleet, forming a gunnery school at Portsmouth. He resigned when the Government fell from power in November 1830, but remained active in Parliamentary affairs, including leading the opposition to abolition of the Navy Board in 1832. After losing his seat in Parliament at the 1832 general election he returned to sea and became Commander-in-Chief of the North America and West Indies Station, hoisting his flag in the fourth-rate HMS &quot;Vernon&quot;, in December 1832.

Cockburn became First Naval Lord briefly again in the First Peel ministry in December 1834 but resigned when the Government fell from power in April 1835. He then returned to his old post as Commander-in-Chief of the North America and West Indies Station. Promoted to full admiral on 10 January 1837, he was elected Conservative Member of Parliament for Ripon at a by-election in September 1841 and also became First Naval Lord again in the Second Peel ministry later that month. As First Sea Lord he ensured that the Navy had latest steam and screw technology and put emphasis of the ability to manage seamen without the need to resort to physical punishment. He resigned when the Government fell from power in July 1846, became Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom on 10 August 1847 and was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 1 July 1851. He inherited the family baronetcy from his elder brother in February 1852 and died at Leamington Spa on 19 August 1853. He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.
Cockburn Sound in Western Australia was named after him by Captain James Stirling in 1827. Cockburn Island, at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, was named for him by Sir James Clark Ross during his Antarctic expedition between 1839 and 1843. Cape Cockburn and Cockburn Bay on Nelson Island on the west coast of Canada were named after him.

==Family==
In 1809, Cockburn married his cousin Mary Cockburn. The couple had one surviving daughter, Augusta Harriot Mary Cockburn (d. 1869), who married Captain John Cochrane Hoseason.

Cockburn&#x27;s descendants are writer Alexander Cockburn (1941-2012) and actress Olivia Wilde.

<text>Craven Arms is a market town and civil parish in Shropshire, England. It is sited on the A49 road and the Welsh Marches railway line, which link it north and south to the larger towns of Shrewsbury and Ludlow respectively. The town is enclosed to the north by the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and to the south is the fortified manor house of Stokesay Castle. 

Craven Arms is a market town for the surrounding rural area, with a number of shops, estate agents, a supermarket, an abattoir and many commercial/light industrial businesses. It is also a visitor destination, being home or nearby to a number of attractions, and is a centre for visitors to the area of outstanding natural beauty. It describes itself as the &quot;Gateway to the Marches&quot;.

==History==

Craven Arms is a relatively new town (for Shropshire), being only a small village called Newton on a map of 1695. The settlement grew when the railway station came during the mid to late 19th century, making it a railway town. Newton or Newtown is still the name for the southeastern part of the present day town, while the northern part is called Newington or New Inn (another small village which existed prior to the town). The town takes its name from the Craven Arms Hotel, which was situated on the junction of the A49 and B4368 roads, which in turn is named after the Earls of Craven (who owned nearby Stokesay Castle).

The civil parish of Craven Arms was formed in 1987 by the merging of two older parishes: Stokesay and Halford. These two older entities continued as parish wards; however, a review of the governance of the parish in 2012 concluded that these two wards would be abolished from May 2013. Small parts of the settlement overlap into neighbouring Wistanstow and Sibdon Carwood parishes.

==Geography==
Nearby towns are Bishop&#x27;s Castle, Clun, Church Stretton and Ludlow, of which the last is the most substantial with 10,000 inhabitants.

The River Onny flows to the town&#x27;s east and just over the river is the small village of Halford. To the south is the small village of Stokesay, while to the north is the village of Wistanstow.

Wenlock Edge is located to the north-east of the town and runs in a northeasterly direction, towards Much Wenlock.

==Transport==
Craven Arms railway station lies at the junction of the Welsh Marches Line and the Heart of Wales Line, south of Shrewsbury. All passenger trains calling at the station are operated by Transport for Wales, who also manage it. Most services run along a route between , , , Shrewsbury, and ; there are also irregular trains north to and south-west to .

Minsterley Motors operate two bus routes which connect Craven Arms with Ludlow, Church Stretton, Shrewsbury and Pontesbury.

==Attractions==
There are two main visitor attractions in the Craven Arms civil parish. In the town there is the Shropshire Hills Discovery Centre, a centre featuring exhibits about the county&#x27;s geography; and Stokesay Castle which is a fortified manor house located within the parish, just south of the town. Stella Mitchell&#x27;s Land of Lost Content Museum, a collection of 20th-century memorabilia, also stood in the town until closed in 2023.

==Religious sites==

Craven Arms is home to several churches. The Anglican parish church is the grade II listed church of St Thomas, outside the town in the village of Halford. The grade I listed Church of St John the Baptist, Stokesay is south of the town near Stokesay Castle. St Andrews Community Church in the town centre is &quot;non-denominational, evangelical &amp; charismatic&quot;, and there is a Methodist church, and a Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses Kingdom Hall. A small Islamic centre is in the town on Newton Street. It is the only mosque for the surrounding Shropshire Hills. The other nearest mosques are in Shrewsbury and Telford.

==Recent development==
The town has recently gone through a phase of expansion and this looks set to continue with the (2009 abolished) South Shropshire District Council stating that they wished to see the town become the district&#x27;s second main market town (after Ludlow) by 2026. Much of the recent housing development is on the west side of the town, whilst commercial development is taking place more on the northern end. Development potential towards the east is restricted by the floodplain of the River Onny, whilst to the south lies the historically important Stokesay Castle.

The town centre itself has seen some notable developments in recent years, with new commercial buildings built on Dale Street by the A49 road. Additionally, to the immediate south of the town centre is the Shropshire Hills Discovery Centre which opened in 2001 and some new housing.

<doc id="1285955" wikidata="Q1882493" url="?curid=1285955" title="Mac Raboy">
<text>Emmanuel &quot;Mac&quot; Raboy (April 9, 1914 – December 12, 1967) was an American comics artist best known for his comic-book work on Fawcett Comics&#x27; Captain Marvel Jr. and as the Sunday comic-strip artist of &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; for more than 20 years. Cartoonist Drew Friedman has stated, &quot;Raboy was an expert technician with pen and brush, and his lush covers are some of the most unusually beautiful ever to grace comic books&quot;.

==Early life==
Raboy was born in New York City on April 9, 1914, to a Jewish family. (The April 9 date is taken from Roger Hill&#x27;s biography &quot;Mac Raboy: Master of the Comics&quot;. His birthdate has also been cited as April 17, 1914, in other sources. Hill&#x27;s biography also gives his birth name as &quot;Manuel&quot;, but Friedman&#x27;s book &quot;Heroes Of The Comics&quot; lists it as &quot;Emmanuel.&quot;) Raboy&#x27;s father had emigrated from Romania; the family name&#x27;s spelling was changed from &quot;Raboi&quot;. His father worked in a hat factory before moving to North Dakota for a time to work as a blacksmith and horse handler. He moved to Connecticut to work on the family dairy farm, and finally settled in the Bronx. His father wrote poetry, political essays, and several books, including &quot;The Jewish Cowboy,&quot; about his North Dakota experience.

==Career==
Raboy began his art career with the Works Progress Administration during the Great Depression. In the 1940s he began working with the Harry A. Chesler studio of comics artists. Raboy began drawing comic books and gained fame as the illustrator for &quot;Captain Marvel, Jr.&quot; and the &quot;Green Lama&quot;. Raboy was a great admirer of Alex Raymond, and &quot;kept a portfolio of Alex Raymond&#x27;s &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; comics by his side for inspiration and guidance as he worked&quot;. In the spring of 1946, King Features hired Raboy to continue the Sunday page adventures of &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, which he continued to work on until his death.

==Death==
Raboy was diagnosed with cancer in 1967, and died that December. Hill&#x27;s biography gives the date as December 22; other sources have listed it as December 12.

<text>Ulla Erna Frieda Jürß (born 2 August 1923) was a Nazi and concentration camp guard. It is unclear in her file when Jürß became a camp guard (estimated between 1942 and 1944).

Jürß was born in Rabenhorst, Germany. She went to Ravensbrück concentration camp where she was trained as an &quot;Aufseherin&quot; and served in several capacities. She was later promoted to the rank of &quot;Blockführerin&quot;, and had over 600 women under her control. She was reportedly a brutal block overseer in the camp. In October 1944 she was relieved from duty and went back home.

She was not tracked down until 1966, and until then, lived quietly in East Germany. That year, she was charged with crimes against humanity. An East German court found her and two other former guards, Ilse Göritz and Frida Wötzel, and sentenced them to life imprisonment. After the reunification of Germany, Jürß was released on health grounds in May 1991. After her release, she has also filed a petition for rehabilitation and compensation for the time she spent in prison. This petition was denied, however. It is not known whether Jürß is still alive.

<text>Salvatore Paul Erna Jr. (born February 7, 1968) is an American singer, musician, and songwriter, best known as the vocalist and rhythm guitarist for rock band Godsmack. He is also a harmonica player, drummer, and percussionist, performing these on albums and at live shows. He was ranked 47th in the Top 100 Heavy Metal Vocalists by &quot;Hit Parader&quot;.

==Early life==
Sully Erna was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts. He began playing drums at the age of three. His father, Salvatore Erna Sr., was a trumpet player from Sicily and would rehearse in the basement where Sully would watch. His great-uncle was a famous composer in Sicily. At the age of 11, Erna discovered that it was easier for him to listen to something and play it than read sheet music. He stopped taking lessons and practiced at home, rehearsing to records by Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, Motörhead, and Rush.

==Musical career==

At 14, Dave Vose became Erna&#x27;s new instructor. He signed his first record deal in 1993 with a band called Strip Mind. Their debut album &quot;What&#x27;s in Your Mouth&quot; sold fewer than 50,000 units. Some of the band members (mainly the singer) and Erna didn&#x27;t get along, and Erna was booted out. They split-up shortly after. 

In Godsmack concerts, Erna plays the bongos and a large drum set, staging a drumming duel known as &quot;Batalla de los Tambores&quot; with drummer Shannon Larkin. This battle has become a staple of the band&#x27;s live show. He is also a harmonica player as present on the Godsmack song &quot;Shine Down&quot;. 

In 2010, Erna released his first solo album &quot;Avalon&quot;. The album took seven years to complete and differed stylistically from Godsmack. Erna wrapped up his acoustic tour with one final show at The House of Blues in Las Vegas, Nevada on June 28.

Erna has also worked with his local music scene. In April 2005, he participated in New Hampshire&#x27;s Battle of the Bands Competition. The winner (a band called Zion who hails from Salem) had the opportunity to record a demo at Erna&#x27;s California studio.

===Solo work===
Erna told &quot;Glam-Metal.com&quot; that doing his first solo shows were &quot;extremely nerve-wracking&quot;, adding, &quot;My first show, I was really, really nervous. Honestly, I haven&#x27;t been that nervous since I was, I don&#x27;t know, maybe 10 years old at a talent show or something.&quot; Erna kicked off his first solo acoustic trek on May 1 in Niagara Falls, New York and closed it out on May 31 in Las Vegas. The shows have combined Godsmack songs with a few new originals and covers ranging from the Beatles to Alice in Chains to the theme from &quot;Love Story&quot;.

Regarding how he went about selecting the material used for his solo show, Erna said, &quot;I wanted to stick a couple of originals in and try them out because there was a couple of songs that were done on the piano or the guitar that I wrote that I don&#x27;t think I would use on a GODSMACK record&quot;, he said. &quot;For example, &#x27;Eyes of a Child&#x27; and &#x27;Until Then&#x27;. It was a great opportunity to showcase that and see if I can hit home with the people on those two pieces. Those songs are the most emotional pieces of the evening. One song is about children born with or dying from AIDS and the other is about a tribute to the troops of the United States Armed Forces.&quot;

Erna told The Pulse of Radio that playing some new material live is a good way for him to test out songs that might not work for Godsmack. &quot;We&#x27;re all musicians and we like to write music and not necessarily rock all the time&quot;, he said. &quot;So, you know, if I sit home and I&#x27;m writing on the piano and sometimes just cool songs are written that don&#x27;t necessarily fit maybe what you do with Godsmack, but you don&#x27;t wanna not record them.&quot;

Erna stated at the time that he planned to work on his first solo album. On March 4, 2009, Blabbermouth.net reported that Erna had completed work on his first solo album, &quot;Avalon&quot;, released September 14, 2010. Although, the single &quot;Sinner&#x27;s Prayer&quot; will be on radio stations and on sale everywhere August 3, 2010. Erna described the album as being &quot;a very different kind of sounding record&quot;, and &quot;a huge departure from anything I&#x27;ve ever done.&quot; The album includes Lisa Guyer on vocals, Tim Theriault on guitars and vocals, Chris Decato on keyboards, midi and vocals, Chris Lester on acoustic guitars and bass, classically trained Irina Chirkova of Bulgaria on Cello, Niall Gregory of Ireland Dead Can Dance on drums and percussion, and David Stephanelli on drums and percussion. In further describing the album&#x27;s sound, Erna said that &quot;it&#x27;s very eclectic&quot; and &quot;tribal&quot; with &quot;a lot of hand drumming&quot; and &quot;beautiful piano compositions&quot;. He also stated that he &quot;worked with a percussion session for Dead Can Dance&quot; and that the album will feature Lisa Guyer, who had performed backing vocals for the song &quot;Hollow&quot; on Godsmack&#x27;s previous album.

&quot;Avalon&quot; was released on September 14, 2010. He released a live DVD, &quot;Avalon Live&quot;, in fall of 2012.

In July 2016, it was announced that Erna will release his second solo album &quot;Hometown Life&quot; on September 30, 2016. The album has since been released. &quot;Hometown Life&quot; includes a song &quot;Turn It Up&quot;, for which Erna invited his father into the recording studio to play trumpet on the track. His father performed the song live with Erna at a Sully Erna solo show.

In 2024, Erna featured on country rock artist Cory Marks&#x27;s single &quot;(Make My) Country Rock&quot; with Travis Tritt and Mick Mars.

==Other activities==
===Film and music video appearances===
Erna is good friends with Criss Angel and has participated in several episodes of the &quot;Criss Angel Mindfreak&quot; TV show. Erna&#x27;s contributions to the discography of Criss Angel include co-writing and performing &quot;Mindfreak&quot;″s new theme song &quot;MF2&quot;. Erna appears in the music video along with Criss Angel and Godsmack drummer Shannon Larkin.

Erna appeared in episode 7 of the 2007 TV series &quot;Dirt&quot;. Erna has been named to the cast of Woodhaven Pictures &quot;Army of the Damned&quot;. In 2016, he appeared as a Caesar&#x27;s blackjack dealer in the Martin Scorsese-produced film &quot;Bleed for This&quot;. Erna has reportedly signed on to appear in the movie &quot;Street Level&quot;. He also stars in a new independent action-thriller called &quot;Black Files&quot;.

In 2017, Erna appeared in the Bulgarian film &quot;Benzin&quot; (director Asen Blatechki).

===Memoir===
Erna released a memoir entitled &quot;The Paths We Choose&quot; on his birthday, February 7, 2007. The book details his struggles during the first 30 years of his life, up until the time Godsmack landed a record deal.

&quot;The book is basically just my life from the time I was born until Godsmack started&quot;, Erna said. &quot;I wanted to write about the whole experience of trying to get there, and hopefully that will inspire some people that maybe are still in the ghettos or trying to dig their way out of a hole. I mean, we&#x27;re all human and we weren&#x27;t born rock stars. So I think there&#x27;s an interesting story to tell of the pain and struggling. You know, being middle classed and being raised in crazy neighborhoods. If kids can see that they&#x27;ll be able to relate to anything they have a dream for.&quot;

The book sold 100,000 copies in its first month of release, and to date has shipped 1,000,000 copies worldwide.

===Life Story Documentary===
&quot;I Stand Alone: The Sully Erna Story&quot; is a documentary film, produced, edited, and co-written by Noah Berlow, with direction by Troy Smith, providing a glimpse into Sully Erna&#x27;s remarkable journey from adversity to triumph in the music industry.

===Poker===

Erna participated in the 2006 World Series of Poker main event, in which he made a brief appearance on the ESPN broadcast of the event; it was mentioned that he was the last of the celebrity entries. He finished in 713th out of 8,773 earning him $17,730.

Erna also played in the 2007 World Series of Poker main event. After the elimination of Tobey Maguire, Erna was the final celebrity remaining. He placed in 237th out of a field of 6,358, earning $45,422. To complement his placing at the World Series of Poker, he placed 2nd in a preliminary event at Bellagio&#x27;s 5 Diamond World Poker Classic, where he lost to J.C Tran but earned $307,325 as a consolation.

Erna also competed in the 2007 VH1 Celebrity Rock and Roll Tournament with Ace Frehley, Vinnie Paul, Scott Ian, and Dusty Hill. Erna took second, losing to Scott Ian of Anthrax.

Erna returned to play in the 2013 World Series of Poker. &quot;I&#x27;m making my comeback! I&#x27;ve studied the game. I&#x27;m getting the itch to play poker again&quot;, Erna said during an interview with Playbook.

===2010 Haiti earthquake===
Godsmack, Creed, and Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello are some of the musicians who partnered with multimedia company DC3 Music Group to fundraise and pack an MD-80 airplane with supplies and medical personnel to help in the 2010 Haiti earthquake. According to a press release, the plane was scheduled to leave from Long Beach, California, on January 27, 2010, and bring 10,000 pounds of medical supplies, along with doctors and medical staff, to Port-au-Prince.

Erna said in a statement, &quot;Since I can&#x27;t be there to help in person, I want to make my contribution as a fellow human being to give what I can while I&#x27;m in the fortunate situation that I am to help those that are so unfortunate in this time of tragedy.&quot;

===&quot;Hometown Sessions&quot;===
Erna launched a bi-weekly web series on YouTube called &quot;Hometown Sessions&quot;. The talk show has Erna hosting celebrity guests. He explained about the contents of the show:
==Personal life==
Erna has a daughter, Skylar, born in 2001. Erna is a longtime fan of the New England Patriots, having sung the national anthem prior to home games in Foxborough on numerous occasions.

===Religious views===
Erna was a practicing Wiccan early in his career. His spirituality influences some of his songwriting to include the song &quot;Spiral&quot; from Godsmack&#x27;s second album &quot;Awake&quot; and &quot;Releasing the Demons&quot; from their third album &quot;Faceless&quot;. He has stated publicly, however, that he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to be the poster boy for witchcraft.&quot; He has also said that he does not follow any specific religion; &quot;I&#x27;m just a spiritual person; I believe in karma and things like that. But religion is an ugly word to me.&quot;

===Car accident===
Erna was involved in a three-car chain-reaction accident in Methuen, Massachusetts, when his Hummer H3 and two others collided at an intersection. &quot;He&#x27;s deeply concerned for the girl who was hurt in this unfortunate accident&quot;, said Erna&#x27;s manager Paul Geary, in reference to 25-year-old Chelmsford resident Lindsay Taylor. &quot;Sully&#x27;s thankful he got out with a split lip and some aches and pains, but he&#x27;s traumatized about the girl&quot;, according to April 17, 2007, &quot;Boston Herald&quot;.

Taylor was sitting in the back seat of a dark blue Toyota Camry that was rear-ended by the H3 driven by Erna. The crash occurred on a dark night, around 7 p.m. on the ramp leading from I-93 south to Route 213.

Taylor suffered a severe, traumatic brain injury and was in a coma after the crash. She suffered lasting effects, and would later sue. A settlement was reached in 2010.

==Gear==
Erna uses Yamaha Absolute Birch drums. He plays on a signature Sully Erna Les Paul Studio guitar.

<text>The Society for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage was the first American abolition society. It was founded April 14, 1775, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and held four meetings. Seventeen of the 24 men who attended initial meetings of the Society were Quakers, that is, members of the Religious Society of Friends, a branch of Christianity notable in the early history of Pennsylvania.

It was reorganized in 1784 as the &quot;Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery and for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage&quot;, (better known as the Pennsylvania Abolition Society) and was incorporated in 1789.

At some point after 1785, Benjamin Franklin was elected as the organization&#x27;s president. The society asked him to bring the matter of slavery to the Constitutional Convention of 1787. He petitioned the U.S. Congress in 1790 to ban slavery.

The Pennsylvania Abolition (or Abolitionist) Society, which had members and leaders of both races, became a model for anti-slavery organizations in other states during the years. Prominent African-American members included Robert Purvis, who was admitted in 1842 as the Society&#x27;s first Black member.

In 1984 when the Society was revived, a Pennsylvania State Historical Marker was placed on Philadelphia&#x27;s Front Street below Chestnut Street, at the site of its original offices.

The Pennsylvania Abolition Society still exists, dedicated to the cause of combating racism. The oldest abolitionist organization in the United States, since the late twentieth century, it has worked to improve issues of criminal justice and the over-representation of African Americans in prison, reduction in harsh sentencing laws, and improving economic and environmental justice.

<doc id="1285975" wikidata="Q268545" url="?curid=1285975" title="Thérèse Raquin">
<text>Thérèse Raquin () is an 1868 novel by French writer Émile Zola, first published in serial form in the literary magazine &quot;L&#x27;Artiste&quot; in 1867. It was Zola&#x27;s third novel, though the first to earn wide fame. The novel&#x27;s adultery and murder were considered scandalous and famously described as &quot;putrid&quot; in a review in the newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot;.

&quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot; tells the story of a young woman, unhappily married to her first cousin by an overbearing aunt, who may seem to be well-intentioned but in many ways is deeply selfish. Thérèse&#x27;s husband, Camille, is sickly and egocentric and when the opportunity arises, Thérèse enters into a turbulent and sordidly passionate affair with one of Camille&#x27;s friends, Laurent.

In his preface, Zola explains that his goal in this novel was to &quot;study temperaments and not characters&quot;. Because of this detached and scientific approach, &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot; is considered an example of naturalism.

&quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot; was first adapted for the stage as an 1873 play written by Zola himself. It has since then been adapted numerous times as films, TV mini-series, musicals, and an opera, among others.

==Plot summary==
Thérèse Raquin is the daughter of a French sea captain and an Algerian mother. After her mother&#x27;s death, her father takes her to live with her aunt, Madame Raquin, and Camille, her valetudinarian son. Because her son is &quot;so ill&quot;, Madame Raquin dotes on him to the point of spoiling him, and he is very selfish. Camille and Thérèse grow up side-by-side and Madame Raquin marries them to each other when Thérèse turns 21. Shortly thereafter, Camille decides that the family should move to Paris so he can pursue a career.

Thérèse and Madame Raquin set up shop in the Passage du Pont Neuf to support Camille while he searches for a job. He eventually starts working for the Orléans Railway Company, where he runs into a childhood friend, Laurent. Laurent visits the Raquins and, while painting a portrait of Camille, contemplates an affair with the lonely Thérèse, mostly because he cannot afford prostitutes anymore.

It soon becomes a torrid love affair. They meet regularly and secretly in Thérèse&#x27;s room. After some time, Laurent&#x27;s boss no longer allows him to leave early, so the lovers must think of something new. Thérèse comes up with the idea of killing Camille, and they become infatuated with the idea of being able to be together permanently while being married. It seems Camille is the only obstacle in this. They eventually drown him during a boat trip, though in defending himself Camille succeeds in biting Laurent on the neck. Madame Raquin is in shock after hearing of her son&#x27;s disappearance. Everybody believes that the drowning was an accident and that the couple actually tried to save Camille. Laurent is still uncertain about whether Camille is truly dead and frequently visits the mortuary, which he persists in although it disturbs him, until he finally finds the dead body there. Thérèse becomes far more nervous and has nightmares; the previously calm and centered Laurent also becomes nervous. Their feelings toward each other are greatly changing, but they still plot to marry without raising suspicion and therefore reap the rewards of their actions. Thérèse acts very subdued around family and acquaintances and Laurent publicly shows great concern and care for her, so Michaud, one of the family&#x27;s regular visitors, decides that Thérèse should remarry and her ideal husband should be Laurent. They finally marry but are haunted by the memory of the murder; Laurent&#x27;s bite scar serves as a constant reminder for them both. They have hallucinations of the dead Camille in their bed every night, preventing them from touching each other and quickly driving them even more insane. They vacillate between trying desperately to rekindle their passion to get rid of the corpse hallucinations (and trying to &#x27;heal&#x27; the bite scar) and despising each other. Laurent, previously an untalented artist, is suddenly struck with surprising talent and skill, but he can no longer paint a picture (even a landscape) which does not in some way resemble the dead man. Sickened by this, he gives up art. They must also tend to Madame Raquin, who suffered a stroke after Camille&#x27;s death. She suffers a second stroke and becomes completely paralyzed (except for her eyes), after which Thérèse and Laurent accidentally reveal the murder in her presence during one of their many arguments.

Madame Raquin, previously blissfully happy, is now filled with rage, disgust, and horror. During an evening game of dominoes with friends, Madame Raquin manages to move her finger with an extreme effort of will to trace words on the table: &quot; ...&quot;. The complete sentence was intended to be &quot;&quot; (Thérèse and Laurent killed Camille). At this point, her strength gives out and the words are interpreted as &quot;Thérèse and Laurent look after me very well&quot;.

Thérèse and Laurent find life together intolerable. Laurent has started beating Thérèse, something she deliberately provokes to distract her from her life. Thérèse has convinced herself that Madame Raquin has forgiven her and spends hours kissing her and praying at the disabled woman&#x27;s feet. The couple argue almost constantly about Camille and who was responsible for his death, so they exist in an endless waking nightmare. They are being driven to rashly plot to kill each other. At the novel&#x27;s climax, they&#x27;re about to kill each other when each realizes the other&#x27;s plan. They break down sobbing in silent agreement of what they should do next, and reflect on their miserable lives. After a final embrace, they commit suicide by taking poison supplied by Laurent, all in front of the hate-filled, watchful gaze of Madame Raquin.

==Characters==
* Thérèse Raquin – the eponymous protagonist, is the wife of Camille and the orphaned daughter of Madame Raquin&#x27;s brother and an unknown African woman.
* Camille Raquin – Thérèse&#x27;s husband and first cousin.
* Madame Raquin – Camille&#x27;s mother and Thérèse&#x27;s aunt. She works as a shopkeeper to support her family.
* Laurent – a childhood friend and coworker of Camille who seduces Thérèse.
* Michaud – the police commissioner and friend of Madame Raquin
* Olivier – Michaud&#x27;s son who works at the police prefecture
* Suzanne – Olivier&#x27;s wife
* Grivet – an elderly employee of the Orléans Railroad Company, where Camille works
* François – the Raquins&#x27; cat

==Themes==

===Punishment and imprisonment===
Throughout the book, there are references to chains, cages, tombs, and pits. These contribute to the impression that Laurent and Thérèse are in a state of remorse and are plagued by guilt. The book mentions how they always claw at the chains that bound them together. The shop that Thérèse owns is compared to a tomb, where Thérèse watches corpses walk by in the day.

===Temperaments===
In his preface to the second edition, Zola writes that he intended to &quot;study temperaments and not characters&quot;. To his main characters, he assigns various humors according to Galen&#x27;s four temperaments: Thérèse is melancholic, Laurent is sanguine, Camille is phlegmatic and Madame is choleric. For Zola, the interactions of these types of personalities could only have the result that plays out in his plot.

===Human beast===
Also in his preface, Zola calls both Thérèse and Laurent &quot;human brutes&quot; and the characters are often given animal tendencies. Zola would take up this idea again in his &quot;La Bête humaine&quot; (1890).

==Literary significance and reception==
&quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot; is generally considered to be Zola&#x27;s first major work. Upon its release in 1867, &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot; was a commercial and artistic success for Zola; this led to a reprint in book form in 1868. It gained additional publicity when critic Louis Ulbach (pen name: Ferragus) called &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot; &quot;putrid&quot; in a long diatribe for &quot;Le Figaro&quot;; Zola capitalized on this for publicity and referred to it in his preface to the second edition.

Zola&#x27;s book provided the clear inspiration for James M. Cain&#x27;s 1934 novel &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot;, which has a similar plot.

==Adaptations==

===Theatrical===
Zola adapted the novel into a play, &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot;, first staged in 1873. It was not performed in London until 1891, under the auspices of the Independent Theatre Society, since the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office refused to license it.

Stage productions of Zola&#x27;s play include:
* 2006 for the Royal National Theatre, London, adaptation written by Nicholas Wright

An opera based on the novel was written by the composer Michael Finnissy. Another opera, &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot;, by Tobias Picker, opened in 2000.

The novel was made into the Broadway musical &quot;Thou Shalt Not&quot;, with music by Harry Connick Jr.

The play &quot;The Artificial Jungle&quot; by Charles Ludlam was an adaption of the novel, written in the hard-boiled crime style of James M. Cain.

Neal Bell adapted the novel into a play under the same title. It was first produced at New York University by Playwrights Horizons Theatre School on December 3, 1991, directed by Edward Elefterion, with Katie Bainbridge as the title role. Its first professional production was at the Williamstown Theatre Festival on June 30, 1993, directed by Michael Greif, with Lynn Hawley as Thérèse. On July 10, 1994, Michael Greif, in conjunction with La Jolla Playhouse in California, put up the West Coast premiere with Paul Giamatti in the role of Camille. Its professional New York premiere was on October 27, 1997, at the Classic Stage Company, directed by David Esbjornson, with Elizabeth Marvel as Thérèse. The Los Angeles premiere was directed by Charlie Stratton, with Leslie Hope as Thérèse.

A 2014 UK musical, &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot;, with music by Craig Adams and book and lyrics by Nona Shepphard, featured Julie Atherton as Thérèse, Tara Hugo as Madame, Jeremy Legat as Camille and Ben Lewis/Greg Barnett as Laurent. After a sold-out run at The Finborough Theatre the Theatre Bench production transferred to Park Theatre in Finsbury Park and was nominated for a West End Frame award. A cast recording was released in 2015.

<text>Formula Junior is an open-wheel formula racing class first adopted in October 1958 by the CSI (&quot;International Sporting Commission&quot;, the part of the FIA that then regulated motorsports). The class was intended to provide an entry level class where drivers could use inexpensive mechanical components from ordinary automobiles. The idea to form the new class came from Count Giovanni &quot;Johnny&quot; Lurani, who saw the need of a class for single-seater racing cars where younger drivers could take their first steps. It is often speculated that this class was founded as a reaction to Italy&#x27;s lack of success in the 500 cc Formula Three, and although Italian marques dominated the first year of the formula, they were soon overtaken by British constructors.

==History==
The rules for the class required the cars to be powered by production-based engines with a maximum volume of with a 360 kg (792 lb) car or with a 400 kg (880 lb) car – in practice the latter was used in almost all successful FJs (the USA adopted other cc/weight ratios but they were rarely used). Parts like engine block, head and cylinders had to come from a production car; single or twin overhead camshafts, limited slip differentials and modifications to the number of main bearings were all forbidden. The brakes and transmission also had to be production-based. Constructors were allowed to increase the number of gears, but only inside a production gearbox casing.

In Italy the popular Fiat 1100 engine was the obvious choice and in 1958 there were few other suitable engines in Italy; elsewhere the 1000 cc Mini engine as well as the DKW and the Saab three-cylinder two-stroke engines were obvious choices, as was the new oversquare Ford engine from the 105E Anglia. The first Italian FJ cars were very much in the front-engined tradition of contemporary Grand Prix cars; the first international Formula Junior championship in 1959 was won by the Swiss driver and engineer Michael May in an Automobili Stanguellini. The British constructors were initially not particularly interested; the 500cc Formula Three was still just about viable, and small-capacity sports car racing had become the accepted route into racing. As the formula gathered momentum, though, constructors started to take note.

In the UK, Frank Nichols of Elva produced the Elva 100 series powered by a BMC A-Series (Sprite or Mini) engine or a DKW two-stroke engine tuned by Gerhard Mitter in Germany. The Elva became first mass-produced British Formula Junior car. Other early British designs included the Gemini (earlier called Moorland) and Lola Mk 2.

Although these early British FJs were front-engined, the F1 car was undergoing a mid-engined revolution and there were also strands of thinking in FJ that stemmed from the 500cc Formula Three where rear-engined cars had been the norm. It was not long before Cooper started to produce a car similar to their contemporary F1/F2 thinking, later F3s and &quot;bobtail&quot; sports car fitted with BMC A-series engines. On the engine side, Keith Duckworth of Cosworth Engineering took an interest in Formula Junior and managed to get hold of two of the new engines to be used in the 1959 Ford Anglia. Lotus also came into the game with their Lotus 18, a simplified derivative of their Formula One and Formula Two chassis fitted with a Ford Anglia engine. Later Lotus also raced in Formula Junior with Lotus 20, Lotus 22 and Lotus 27. These two marques (Cooper and Lotus), with close links to their Grand Prix teams, soon came to dominate Formula Junior on an international level.

In Sweden, Saab produced the Saab Formula Junior, mainly to test new engine designs.

In Russia the most used engine came from the Moskvitch.

Through the formula&#x27;s lifetime, though, the number of manufacturers increased. By the end of 1960 there were over 100 manufacturers worldwide, and by the end of 1963 the number had increased to almost 500 – but the vast majority of race wins went to the British constructors of mid-engined cars. Brabham&#x27;s first racing car was the mid-engined BT1 (originally called the MRD, but renamed when it was realised that the initials had unfortunate connotations in French) in 1961. By 1963 the class had become expensive, the scope for wins in homebuilt or amateur cars was diminishing and the cost of tuning a 1000 cc engine to get up to 120 hp was getting too high. The 1963 series was the last series in the UK and Europe.

In the early 1960s, after Formula One was reduced to a 1.5l engine capacity and Formula Two disappeared, Formula Junior suffered from playing two roles, both an introduction to single-seater racing for novices, and the only international single seater category below F1. The latter role meant that costs were pushed up too high for many amateurs (competing against works or near-works Coopers and Lotuses meant that there was little chance of success in major races), and it was decided that two new formulae were needed to replace FJ; one-litre Formula Two and Formula Three were reintroduced for 1964, with F2 allowing pure-bred race engines and aimed very much at professional and serious up-and-coming drivers, and F3 essentially being a slightly tamer version of FJ for amateurs and those at an earlier stage in their career.

Slightly later in the 1960s, classes based on the same original idea as FJ evolved as low-cost introductions to single-seater motor racing, notably Formula Ford and Formula Vee.

Because many cars and engines are still readily available, Formula Junior is now a popular category in historic racing.

Drivers with a background in Formula Junior include: Jim Clark, Peter Arundell, Lorenzo Bandini, Giacomo Russo, Fritz d&#x27;Orey, Trevor Taylor, John Surtees (whose association with the formula was very brief), Denny Hulme, Ed Leslie, Pat Pigott and Jack McAfee. German Gerhard Mitter successfully raced (40 wins) and sold (130) two-stroke-engines for FJ.

<doc id="1285985" wikidata="Q5293142" url="?curid=1285985" title="Don Messer's Jubilee">
<text>Don Messer&#x27;s Jubilee was a Canadian folk musical variety show first broadcast on radio and later on television. The radio version aired from produced from 1939 to 1958 in Charlottetown for CBC Radio. The Television version show shot at the studios of CBHT in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. It was broadcast by CBC Television nationwide from 1957 until 1969, after almost two decades in various formats on CBC radio.

Taking its name from band leader and fiddler Don Messer, the half-hour weekly program featured Messer and his band &quot;Don Messer and His Islanders&quot;, as well as a guest performer. The show followed a consistent format throughout its years, beginning with a tune named &quot;Goin&#x27; to the Barndance Tonight&quot;, followed by fiddle tunes by Messer, songs from some of his &quot;Islanders&quot; including singers Marg Osburne and Charlie Chamberlain, numbers by the Buchta Dancers, the featured guest performance, and a closing hymn. It ended with &quot;Till We Meet Again&quot;.

The series began 7 November 1957 as a regional program limited to CBC&#x27;s Nova Scotia and New Brunswick stations. On 7 August 1959, CBC stations throughout Canada carried the show as a summer replacement for &quot;Country Hoedown&quot;&#x27;s Friday evening time slot. That fall, &quot;Don Messer&#x27;s Jubilee&quot; became a regular season CBC series as of 28 September 1959, becoming a Monday night fixture until its final 1968-1969 season when it returned to the Friday evening timeslot.

Outside of &quot;Hockey Night In Canada&quot;, in the mid-1960s &quot;Don Messer&#x27;s Jubilee&quot; was the #1 show in the country, earning higher ratings than even the imported CBS variety show, &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. The guest performance slot gave national exposure to numerous Canadian folk musicians, including Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors, Catherine McKinnon, Anne Murray, Gordon Lightfoot and Canadian singer Bud Spencer.

The cancellation of the show by the public broadcaster in 1969 caused a nationwide protest, including the raising of questions by Members of Parliament in the House of Commons. The last CBC broadcast was on 20 June 1969. Independent TV station CHCH-TV in Hamilton, Ontario picked up the show for about four years. It was distributed to stations throughout Canada in syndication. The show ended following Messer&#x27;s death in 1973.

<doc id="1285991" wikidata="Q2159013" url="?curid=1285991" title="Timeline of the Eastern Front of World War II">
<text>The Eastern Front was a theatre of World War II which primarily involved combat between the nations and allies of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Combat in the Eastern Front began with the two powers remaining peaceful towards each other, with the annexation of countries such as Albania and portions of Poland by Germany and its allies, and the annexation of Finland and the rest of Poland by the Soviet Union. However, in 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union, putting an end to the peacetime. The majority of major battles in the Eastern Theatre from 1941 until the end of the war in 1945 were fought between the two powers. The following timeline indicates major events taking place on the Eastern Front.

==1939==
* March 14–15: Under German pressure, the Slovaks declare their independence and form a Slovak Republic. The Germans occupy the dismantled Czech lands in violation of the Munich agreement and form the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.
* March 31: France and Great Britain guarantee the integrity of the borders of the Polish state.
* April 7–15: Fascist Italy invades and annexes Albania.
* August 23: Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union sign a non-aggression agreement and a secret protocol dividing eastern Europe into spheres of influence.
* September 1: Germany invades Poland, initiating World War II in Europe.
* September 3: Honoring their guarantee of Poland’s borders, Great Britain and France declare war on Germany.
* September 17: The Soviet Union invades Poland from the east. The Polish government flees into exile via Romania, first to France and then later to Great Britain.
* September 27–29: Warsaw surrenders on September 27. Germany and the Soviet Union divide Poland between them.
* October 2: The last Polish garrison stationed in Hel capitulates, ending the Battle of Hel.
==1940==
* November 30, 1939 – March 12, 1940: The Soviet Union invades Finland, initiating the so-called Winter War. The Finns sue for an armistice and cede the northern shores of Lake Ladoga to the Soviet Union. They also cede the small Finnish coastline on the Arctic Ocean.
* April 9 – June 9: Germany invades Denmark and Norway. Denmark surrenders on the day of the attack. Norway holds out until June 9.
* May 10 – June 22: Germany attacks western Europe, specifically France and the neutral Low Countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg). Luxembourg is occupied on May 10; the Netherlands surrenders on May 14; and Belgium surrenders on May 28. On June 22, France signs an armistice agreement by which the Germans occupy the northern half of the country and the entire Atlantic coastline.

<text>The University for Continuing Education Krems () is an Austrian university specializing in further education for working professionals. It is located in Krems an der Donau, Lower Austria.

==Name==
The Austrian Ministry of Education, Science and Research calls the university the &quot;Danube University Krems&quot; in English and the &quot;Legal Information System of the Republic of Austria&quot; calls the university the &quot;University&quot; of &quot;Continuing Education Krems&quot; in the English translation of the Universities Act 2002.

==History==
The first 93 students enrolled in 1995, when the institution began operation with programs in European Studies and journalism. In 2004, the Austrian parliament passed the &quot;Danube University Act&quot; (DUK-Gesetz) granting the institution the rights of a full university (such as appointing its own professors). More than 27,000 students have graduated from the university.

==Courses==

The University for Continuing Education Krems has specialized in further education of working professionals. It currently offers more than 200 academic courses and degree programs (leading to Master&#x27;s degrees) in the fields:
* Medicine, Health and Social Services
* Economics and Business Management
* Law, Administration and International Affairs
* Education, Media and Communication
* Arts, Culture and Building

==Students==
Today, more than 8,000 students (average age: 40 years) from over 90 countries study at the university. 26 percent of the students come from foreign countries.

==Campus==

The University for Continuing Education Krems is located in the Wachau region along the Danube, which has been named a world cultural heritage site by the UNESCO. A renovated tobacco factory dating back to the onset of the 20th century and new buildings on Campus Krems provide students and educators room for research and studying. The design for the new buildings is the creation of architect Dietmar Feichtinger, who places a new façade of steel, glass and aluminium opposite the industrial building from the previous century.

===Vice-chancellor===
On 2 February 2007, vice-chancellor Helmut Kramer resigned due to &quot;conceptional differences on strategic leadership&quot;. In May 2007 Heinrich Kern was assigned new vice-chancellor. The interim vice-chancellor, Ada Pellert, who also had applied, was not considered on the shortlist of three by the nomination committee. This was followed by protests in the university senate claiming the decision to be gender-discriminating.

On 8 August 2007, the university issued a statement that the discussions on the vice-chancellor&#x27;s nomination are based on structural problems in the university. The university decided to split the organisation into two universities. Kern and Pellert were asked to apply for the positions of the two universities&#x27; vice-chancellors.

In July 2008 deputy vice-chancellors Ada Pellert and Hanna Risku resigned. In August 2008, vice-chancellor Heinrich Kern resigned according to an agreement with the university council. Former deputy vice-chancellor Jürgen Willer was elected new vice-chancellor. Willer took office in January 2009. He resigned from the office in September 2012.
In its session held on 20 February 2013, the University Council elected Friedrich Faulhammer, former general secretary of the Federal Ministry for Science and Research, to become its new vice-chancellor. Faulhammer has been in office since 1 August 2013.

<doc id="1285996" wikidata="Q3065365" url="?curid=1285996" title="Molson family">
<text>The Molson family of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, was founded by John Molson, who immigrated to Canada in 1782 from his home in Lincolnshire, England. They are considered to be one of Canada&#x27;s most prominent business families with a combined net worth of C$1.75 billion.

==History==
John Molson&#x27;s success saw him and his offspring build Canada&#x27;s largest brewery (Molson Brewery), finance its first steamboat and build the first railroad. His sons established Molson&#x27;s Bank, which printed its own currency, and in the city of Montreal, which was overwhelmingly Catholic, they financed the construction of a Protestant church.

The three Molson family mausoleums, built by Irish-born architect George Browne, are among Mount Royal Cemetery&#x27;s most prestigious funerary monuments.

Hartland Molson, a businessman and statesman, expanded the family&#x27;s brewing operations nationwide, co-purchased the Canadian Arena, which included the Montreal Forum and the Montreal Canadiens ice hockey club (1957–1964), and co-sponsored Hockey Night in Canada with his brother, Thomas Henry Pentland Molson. He also served as a Governor of McGill University, and he was a senator for 38 years.

==Philanthropy==
As major contributors to the economy, Hartland Molson and his brother Thomas Henry Pentland Molson gave back by creating the Molson Foundation in 1958, which awarded annual grants for outstanding achievement in the arts by Canadian citizens (renamed the Molson Family Foundation in 1981). The Thomas Henry Pentland Molson Prize for the Arts is awarded by The Canada Council for the Arts annually to distinguished individuals in the arts and the social sciences and humanities, and is intended to encourage continuing contribution to the cultural and intellectual heritage of Canada. The Thomas Henry Pentland Prize for general excellence is awarded annually at Selwyn House School, which he attended in 1911. The Thomas Henry Pentland Molson Family Scholarship is awarded annually by the Lester B. Pearson United World College of the Pacific.

William, Thomas and John Molson Jr. provided McGill University&#x27;s first endowed chair, the Molson Chair in English Language and Literature, currently held by Maggie Kilgour. In addition, in 1860, William Molson donated Molson Hall, the west wing of the university&#x27;s Arts Building. Later generations of the Molson family provided funds to expand the university&#x27;s medical buildings, as well as a gift of land for the Redpath Library. The university&#x27;s Percival Molson Memorial Stadium is named in honour of Percival Molson, who was killed during World War I and left $75,000 in his will to help pay most of the total costs of constructing the stadium.

In 2005, the Molson Family Foundation donated the Hartland Molson Hall at Bishop&#x27;s College School and the building is named for Senator Hartland Molson, where many Molson family members attended school.

The Molson Family Foundation, together with several members of the family, contributed the major part of the funds required for the construction of the Molson Fine Arts Building at Bishop&#x27;s University. The building bears witness to the interest of members of the Molson family in the welfare of Bishop&#x27;s University, over a period of more than 60 years: 
Walter Molson, Trustee 1928–1951,
John H. Molson, President of Corporation 1947–1966,
J. David Molson, Trustee 1965–1968,
William M. Molson, Trustee 1968–1976,
Eric H. Molson, Trustee 1976–1984.

<doc id="1285998" wikidata="Q684593" url="?curid=1285998" title="The Accursed Kings">
<text>The Accursed Kings ( ) is a series of seven historical novels by French author Maurice Druon about the French monarchy in the 14th century. Published between 1955 and 1977, the series has been adapted as a miniseries twice for television in France. A new adaptation for film was announced to be in development in late 2024. 

American author George R. R. Martin called &quot;The Accursed Kings&quot; &quot;the original game of thrones&quot;, citing Druon&#x27;s novels as an inspiration for his own series &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;.

==Plot==
Set in the 14th century during the reigns of the last five kings of the direct Capetian dynasty and the first two kings of the House of Valois, the series begins as the French king Philip the Fair, already surrounded by scandal and intrigue, brings a curse upon his family when he persecutes the Knights Templar. The succession of monarchs that follows leads France and England to the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

==Characters==
==Novels==

The first six novels of &quot;Les Rois maudits&quot; were published in France by Del Duca between 1955 and 1960, and the final volume was released by Plon in 1977. The initial six books were first issued in English (translated by Humphrey Hare) between 1956 and 1961, by Rupert Hart-Davis in the United Kingdom and by Scribner&#x27;s in the United States, with periodic reprints through the 1980s. Between 2013 and 2015, HarperCollins reissued the entire series in print and audiobook, including the last instalment &quot;The King Without a Kingdom&quot;, which had never previously been published in English.

===Book 1 – &quot;Le Roi de fer&quot; (1955)===
:(English title: &quot;The Iron King&quot;)
French King Philip the Fair rules with an iron fist, but is surrounded by scandal and intrigue. Philip&#x27;s daughter Isabella, Queen of England, plots with the ambitious Robert of Artois to catch the wives of her three brothers—Marguerite, Jeanne and Blanche—in their suspected adulterous affairs. Robert&#x27;s own motive is to avenge himself on Jeanne and Blanche&#x27;s mother, his great aunt Mahaut, Countess of Artois, who he believes has stolen his rightful inheritance. Philip&#x27;s younger brother Charles, Count of Valois, resents the power and influence of the common-born Guillaume de Nogaret, Philip&#x27;s prime councillor and keeper of the seal, and Enguerrand de Marigny, Philip&#x27;s Chamberlain. When Philip&#x27;s self-serving persecution of the Knights Templar ends with the Templar Grand Master Jacques de Molay being burned at the stake, Molay curses his accusers—Pope Clement V, Nogaret and Philip himself—to the 13th generation. Marguerite and Blanche are sentenced to life imprisonment for their crimes, and their lovers Gautier and Philippe d&#x27;Aunay are tortured and executed. Jeanne, innocent of adultery herself but complicit in the scandal, is imprisoned indefinitely. Forty days after Molay&#x27;s execution, Clement dies of fever; shortly thereafter, Mahaut&#x27;s lady-in-waiting Béatrice d&#x27;Hirson arranges for Nogaret&#x27;s painful death by means of a poisoned candle. Philip fears that Molay&#x27;s curse is to blame; soon enough, he suffers a cerebral hemorrhage and collapses during a hunt, and dies days later.

===Book 2 – &quot;La Reine étranglée&quot; (1955)===
:(English title: &quot;The Strangled Queen&quot;)
Philip&#x27;s eldest son has been crowned Louis X, but his adulterous wife Marguerite remains imprisoned at the Château Gaillard. Seeking to remarry and father a male heir, Louis sends Robert of Artois to compel Marguerite to sign a statement, in exchange for her freedom, that her marriage to Louis was never consummated and that her daughter Jeanne is illegitimate. She refuses, and Louis&#x27; plan to secure an annulment and marry the beautiful Clemence of Hungary is further stalled by the papal conclave&#x27;s failure to elect a new pope. Marigny finds that his enemies—led by Charles, Count of Valois—are systematically excluding him from the new king&#x27;s inner circle. Louis&#x27; brother, Philippe, Count de Poitiers, and Valois both try to assert some influence over the indecisive king, Philippe for the good of the kingdom and Valois for personal gain. Desperate for freedom, Marguerite reconsiders, but her &quot;confession&quot; never reaches Robert. When he returns to her prison, Marguerite is ill from her confinement—and on Valois&#x27; orders, Robert&#x27;s man Lormet strangles her to death. Though his initial efforts to destroy Marigny fail, Valois manages—with the help of the Lombard banker Tolomei—to assemble a barrage of criminal charges that sees Marigny executed.

===Book 3 – &quot;Les Poisons de la couronne&quot; (1956)===
:(English title: &quot;The Poisoned Crown&quot;; literally &quot;The Poisons of the Crown&quot;)
Louis, now a widower, marries the beautiful Clemence of Hungary. Her discovery of his illegitimate daughter prompts Louis to confess all of his sins to her, and he swears to do whatever penance she requires. Mahaut and Béatrice use magic to assure that Philippe takes back his wife, Mahaut&#x27;s daughter Jeanne, from her imprisonment. Louis&#x27; uncle Charles, Count of Valois, continues grasping for influence over royal affairs by trying to secure the allegiance of the new queen, his niece by his previous marriage. Tolomei&#x27;s nephew, the young banker Guccio Baglioni, marries noblewoman Marie de Cressay in secret. With encouragement from Robert of Artois, Mahaut&#x27;s vassal barons revolt against her. Louis is compelled to intervene, and strips her of power when she refuses to submit to his arbitration. Mahaut poisons Louis with Béatrice&#x27;s help, and he dies, leaving behind a pregnant Clemence and the court in turmoil.

===Book 4 – &quot;La Loi des mâles&quot; (1957)===
:(English title: &quot;The Royal Succession&quot;; literally &quot;The Law of Males&quot;)
With Louis dead and Clemence pregnant, Louis&#x27; uncle Charles and brother Philippe plot against each other for the regency. Waiting in the wings is Marguerite&#x27;s brother Eudes of Burgundy, who seeks to defend the rights of Louis and Marguerite&#x27;s daughter Jeanne. Philippe outmaneuvers his rivals and assumes power. Having trapped the embattled cardinals together in Lyon, he forces a papal conclave that—with some subterfuge—elects Jacques Duèze as Pope Jean XXII. Marie de Cressay gives birth to Guccio&#x27;s son in a convent, and within days Clemence gives birth to Louis&#x27; son Jean. With Clemence deathly ill, Hugues de Bouville and his clever wife Marguerite enlist Marie as wet nurse to the young king. The Countess Mahaut recognizes the infant Jean as the only obstacle between Philippe—who is married to her daughter Jeanne—and the French throne. Fearful of Mahaut, Hugues and Marguerite switch Jean with Marie&#x27;s child Giannino when the baby king is presented to the barons by the countess. Poisoned by Mahaut, the infant dies almost immediately. Without direct proof of her guilt, and unsure of Philippe&#x27;s involvement, the Bouvilles are compelled to keep their secret or possibly be implicated themselves. As Philippe secures his support and accedes the throne, the Bouvilles coerce a devastated Marie to raise Jean as her own and—as a means to keep the secret—never see Guccio again.

===Book 5 – &quot;La Louve de France&quot; (1959)===
:(English title: &quot;The She-Wolf of France&quot;)
Louis and Philippe&#x27;s younger brother Charles IV is now the French king. His sister Isabella is still married to the English King Edward II, whose open favour of his lover Hugh Despenser and the extended Despenser family has marginalized Isabella and incited rebellion among Edward&#x27;s vassal barons. When rebel Baron Roger Mortimer escapes imprisonment in the Tower of London and flees to France to plot against Edward, Isabella later follows on the pretext of negotiating a treaty with her brother, and joins Mortimer as his lover and co-conspirator. A guilt-ridden Bouville finally admits the truth about the French boy king to Pope Jean, whose link to Philippe encourages him to keep the secret. Mahaut seeks her revenge against Isabella—now popularly called the &quot;She-Wolf of France&quot;—by plotting her expulsion from France and certain death at Edward&#x27;s hands. However, aided by forces from Holland and Edward&#x27;s own dissenting barons, Mortimer and Isabella invade England and depose Edward in favor of his and Isabella&#x27;s son Edward III. The daughter and wife of kings, Isabella does not want to give the order to have the elder Edward killed, but a jealous and petulant Mortimer forces her hand, and his minions brutally murder the imprisoned and humiliated former king, following Hugh Despenser&#x27;s trial and most cruel execution.

===Book 6 – &quot;Le Lis et le lion&quot; (1960)===
:(English title: &quot;The Lily and the Lion&quot;)
Charles dies and is succeeded by his cousin Philippe of Valois, thanks in no small part to the machinations of Robert of Artois. Meanwhile, young Edward III has married Philippa of Hainaut, and the popularity of his regent Mortimer is waning. When Mortimer orchestrates the execution of Edward&#x27;s uncle Edmund, Earl of Kent, Edward reclaims the throne and has Mortimer executed. With Philippe in his debt, Robert reopens his claim on Artois, but is forced to forge documents that Mahaut has destroyed. In love with Robert and excited by danger, Béatrice poisons Mahaut, and then her daughter Jeanne, to aid Robert&#x27;s cause. When his case unravels, Robert refuses Philippe&#x27;s offer of a quiet defeat, and is subsequently implicated in a lifetime of crimes. Now a fugitive and outlaw, Robert spends years wandering Europe before he seeks out Edward. Convincing the English king to make his claim on the French throne with force, Robert is killed in battle just as campaign is picking up speed. Twelve years later, Giannino Baglioni is summoned to Rome by the self-declared tribune Cola de Rienzi, who reveals to the Sienese banker that Giannino is actually Jean I, the rightful King of France. Rienzi&#x27;s murder, however, thwarts Jean&#x27;s bid for the throne, and he eventually dies in captivity in Naples, the last direct victim of the curse inflicted upon Philippe&#x27;s house. The epilogue to the novel suggests, however, that the curse would reverberate over the House of Valois and France itself until the burning of Joan of Arc in Rouen a century after the main events of the novel.

===Book 7 – &quot;Quand un Roi perd la France&quot; (1977)===
:(English title: &quot;The King Without a Kingdom&quot;; literally &quot;When A King Loses France&quot;)
Cardinal Talleyrand-Périgord recounts the troubled reign of Philippe&#x27;s son, Jean II &quot;The Good&quot;, who continues the reversal of fortune for France set in motion by his father. Jean creates discord among his lords by the disproportionate favour he bestows upon the handsome Charles de La Cerda, whose subsequent murder ignites a bitter feud between Jean and his treacherous son-in-law, Charles, King of Navarre. Encouraged by the Navarese and taking advantage of the turmoil in France, Edward III renews his claim to the French throne. His son, Edward, the Black Prince, mounts a relatively small but largely unchecked invasion of France. Finally confronted by Jean&#x27;s forces, which vastly outnumber his, young Edward still manages to turn the tables and defeat the French, capturing Jean, his youngest son Philippe and many of his great lords.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Les Rois maudits&quot; has been adapted twice for French television. In December 2024, a new adaptation for film was announced.

===1972 miniseries===
The 1972 TV adaptation of &quot;Les Rois maudits&quot; was broadcast by the ORTF from 21 December 1972 to 24 January 1973, and starred Jean Piat as Robert d&#x27;Artois and Hélène Duc as Mahaut d&#x27;Artois. Adapted by Marcel Jullian and directed by Claude Barma, its six episodes were directly based on—and named after—the first six novels in Druon&#x27;s series. Dubbed &quot;the French &quot;I, Claudius&quot;&quot;, the series was &quot;hugely successful&quot;, and brought the novels &quot;from cult to mainstream success&quot;. The production was shot in studio, with minimal sets. Bertrand Guyard of &quot;Le Figaro&quot; praised the production and cast in 2013. The series was broadcast in the United Kingdom by the BBC in French with English subtitles in June–July 1974 and again in August–September 1975.

===2005 miniseries===
In 2005, &quot;Les Rois maudits&quot; was again adapted in a joint French-Italian production directed by Josée Dayan, starring Philippe Torreton as Robert and Jeanne Moreau as Mahaut. Broadcast on France 2 from 7 November to 28 November 2005, its five episodes are named after novels 1–3 and 5–6 (the exception being &quot;La Loi des mâles&quot;). The series premiered with 8.6 million viewers, and the finale garnered over 6.2 million viewers. Overall &quot;Les Rois maudits&quot; averaged 7.2 million viewers, an audience share of 27.9%.

The miniseries was nominated for a 2006 Globes de Cristal Award for Best Television Film or Television Series.

=== 2020s film series ===
In late 2024, it was announced that newly formed distribution company Yapluka will be adapting the novels for film as its first project. The franchise is to be written and directed by frequent collaborators Matthieu Delaporte and Alexandre de La Patellièr who have most recently made &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (2024). Production for the first film, &quot;The Iron King&quot;, is planned to start in 2026.

==Reception==
According to John Lichfield, &quot;The Independent&quot; French correspondent and a friend of Druon&#x27;s, &quot;&quot;Les Rois maudits&quot; was written to make money very quickly... [Druon] himself was not very proud of it.&quot; However the series was &quot;popular and critically praised&quot;, and numbered among Druon&#x27;s best known works. Lichfield noted:
In his youth, Druon had cowritten the lyrics to &quot;Chant des Partisans&quot; (1943), a popular French Resistance anthem of World War II. In 1948 he received the Prix Goncourt for his novel &quot;&quot;. Though Ben Milne of the BBC noted in 2014 that Druon is &quot;barely known in the English-speaking world&quot;, American author George R. R. Martin called the author &quot;France&#x27;s best historical novelist since Alexandre Dumas, &quot;père&quot;&quot;. Martin dubbed &quot;The Accursed Kings&quot; &quot;the original game of thrones&quot;, citing Druon&#x27;s novels as an inspiration for his own series &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;. Martin&#x27;s UK publisher HarperCollins began reissuing the long out of print &quot;Accursed Kings&quot; series in 2013, with Martin himself writing an introduction. He wrote:
Writing for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Allan Massie praised Druon&#x27;s &quot;thorough research, depth of understanding and popular touch&quot;, noting that &quot;Druon’s re-creation of medieval Paris is so vivid that it loses nothing in comparison with the evocation of the city in the greatest of French medievalist novels, Victor Hugo’s &quot;Notre-Dame de Paris&quot;&quot;. Massie added:

In 2013, Stefan Raets suggested that &quot;The Iron King&quot; could be considered a grimdark historical novel. In a 2013 &quot;Booklist&quot; Starred Review, David Pitt called the novel &quot;historical fiction on a grand scale, full of political intrigue, family drama, and characters who, while drawn from life, are larger than it&quot;. Russell Miller wrote for &quot;Library Journal&quot;:
&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; called &quot;The Iron King&quot; &quot;dramatic and colourful as a Dumas romance but stiffened by historical accuracy and political insight&quot; and a &quot;blood-curdling tale of intrigue, murder, corruption and sexual passion&quot;. &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; described it as &quot;barbaric, sensual, teeming with life, based in wide reading and sound scholarship... among the best historical novels&quot;.

&quot;Les Rois maudits&quot; was parodied on French television in the successful 1973 series &quot;&quot; starring Roger Pierre and Jean-Marc Thibault.

<doc id="1286008" wikidata="Q1454477" url="?curid=1286008" title="Overhead line crossing">
<text>An overhead line crossing is the crossing of an obstacle—such as a traffic route, a river, a valley or a strait—by an overhead power line. The style of crossing depends on the local conditions and regulations at the time the power line is constructed. Overhead line crossings can sometimes require extensive construction and can also have operational issues. In such cases, those in charge of construction should consider whether a crossing of the obstacle would be better accomplished by an underground or submarine cable.

==Crossings of roads and railway lines==
Overhead line crossings of roads, railway lines, and small- and medium-sized watercourses do not normally require special construction. However, in the first years building overhead line when crossing a railway line or a road, a scaffold under the line was required. Later in Germany and some other countries on each end of a powerline crossing of a state-operated railway, a dead-end tower was required, which can still be seen on some old power lines. For overhead line crossings of motorways the pylons must be rebuilt before they wear out, because these demand additional maintenance. If local conditions are appropriate, an overhead line can be implemented by way of a valley bridge. For example, the Koersch valley bridge near Esslingen, Germany carries the 110 kV, three-phase line of the EnBW AG with 2 circuits. Because of the danger of short circuits from falling objects, undercrossings are typically avoided.

==Crossings of overhead lines at state borders==

There is frequently an anchor pylon on each side of state borders, particularly if the lines on either side are operated by different companies. This setup reduces maintenance work, which would otherwise require direct coordination of workers on both sides of the border, and avoids possible authority problems associated with border crossings as much as possible.

==Crossings of other overhead lines==

At crossings of overhead lines by other overhead lines, the two lines must be kept at the necessary safety distances between the lines and the ground. As a rule, the line with the lower voltage passes under the line with higher voltage. Construction workers try to plan these crossings in such a way that their construction is as economical as possible. This is usually done by leaving the line that is crossed unchanged, if possible. Undercrossings of existing lines are often constructed in proximity to the line&#x27;s pylons, since this can often be accomplished without raising the existing pylons, and while keeping the necessary safety distances between the ground and the other line.

In the course of undercrossings the pylon picture is frequently changed, and because of its small height it is preferable to create an arrangement with conductors on one level. Sometimes at such crossings there can be problems because of the maximum pylon height allowed for flight safety reasons. If it is not possible at a given location for the pylons of the upper line to be built at a necessary height, the line running below it will be rebuilt on smaller pylons or replaced with an underground cable.

A unique undercrossing of two powerlines can be found north of Kincardine at Scotland at 56°5&#x27;17&quot;N 3°43&#x27;11&quot;W. Here crosses the powerline Kincardine-Tealing two other lines. One of the two circuits of Kincardine-Tealing powerline crosses these lines on two small pylons and the other circuit via an underground cable.

=== Special crossings from overhead lines of other overhead lines ===

There are some crossings between two overhead powerlines, which are unique, either as both lines are of special type or the unique way of implementation

==Overhead line crossings of aerial tramways==
Overhead lines should cross the route of an aerial tramway only above it.

In principle, over- and undercrossings of aerial tramways are completely regulated. In the case of an undercrossing of an aerial tramway, the maximum safety distances between the overhead line and the floor of the aerial tramway cab must be followed absolutely.

Frequently at the range of the crossing section, special precautionary measures are taken. Thus, at overhead line crossings at which the overhead line runs above the rope of the aerial tramway, two catch ropes are occasionally installed to prevent the conductor from falling off the rope of the tramway in case a pylon or insulator were to break. Alternatively, auxiliary cross-bars can be installed on the pylons of the overhead line under the conductors, which prevent the conductor cables from falling in case of an insulator failure on the aerial tramway. Occasionally, the span field of the line over the aerial ropeway can be scaffolded with a rigid construction along its whole length, or at least for the span which crosses the aerial tramway.

At crossings at which the aerial tramway runs above the power line, the line is frequently installed on special masts in the crossing range, which scaffold the line in the area of the aerial tramway crossing. Such a measure is not necessary according to power line regulations, but it is often done because, in case of aerial tramway failure, it is possible to rescue people from the tram without switching off the overhead line. Such constructions may be seen at 110 kV power line crossings of the Penkenbahn at Mayrhofen, the Patscherkofelbahn at Innsbruck and south of Zermatt.

==Overhead line crossings of broad rivers and straits==

Overhead line crossings of broad rivers and of straits, if the terrain on both sides is relatively even, frequently consist of four pylons: two particularly substantial anchor pylons for bracing the conductors of the crossing section, and two tall carrying masts to keep the line high over the water. These pylons have broader cross-bars and greater distances between the cross-bars than the other pylons of the line, in order to prevent the conductor cables from striking against each other during strong winds. In contrast to normal pylons, the two carrying masts at both ends of the crossing are frequently equipped with flight safety lamps, and have stairways for easy access to the top.

Overhead line crossings of rivers and straits with spans of over 2 km are frequently prohibitively expensive to build and operate; because of the danger of wind-induced oscillatory movements of the conductor cables, it is necessary either to install very large leader distances or to mount insulators between the conductors in the area of the span. Bundle conductors, which are used for almost all extra-high voltage lines, are more susceptible to oscillations from wind forces than single conductors. Therefore, single conductors must be used for the crossing section, which means the crossing section of the power line determines the maximum transmittable power.

Further, one cannot build pylons arbitrarily high at either end of the crossing section, and there is a usually a considerable minimum height because of ships crossing under the line, so there is often a high mechanical tension in the conductors at long spans. This tension requires conductors made largely of steel, which have a worse electrical conductivity than the common overhead line conductors consisting of copper, Aldrey or aluminum-encased steel, and also limits the amount of transmittable electrical power. For this reason, for crossings with a span width of more than approximately 2 km, those in charge of construction should consider laying an underwater cable as the more practicable solution.

Alternatively, it might be possible to erect one or more pylons in the water to be crossed. Such crossings can be seen occasionally in North America. They are, however, only used when it is more economical and practical to do so than to lay a cable underwater, such as when the water is not very deep and no large passage heights are needed for vessels. Also, such construction can be very problematic as far as getting legal permission to build, because pylons standing in the water are likely to be considered dangerous obstacles for ships, especially in foggy conditions.

In some cases on bridges small crossing a wider waterway pylons or crossbars for the conductors can be mounted. Such a solution, which may lead to safety problems at bridge maintenance, was for example realized at the Danish Storstrøm Bridge.

It is quite likely that overhead line crossings of broad waters can be replaced with underwater cables. The overhead line crossing the Strait of Messina — which, with a span of 3646 meters, was one of the longest overhead line crossings in the world, with 200-meter pylons among the highest in the world — was replaced by a submarine cable, because of its small maximum transmittable electrical power.

==Overhead line crossing of valleys==
Overhead line crossings of valleys consist of two anchor pylons, one at either end of the valley. If the topography of the valley is suitable, these do not need to be very high. In very wide valleys, it is better to use a pylon for each phase in order to achieve sufficient distance between the conductors. In these cases there is frequently a further anchor pylon behind the crossing, used in order to realize the angle change of the conductor cables behind these. The problems associated with large spans also exist in these cases, but these can be easily and economically ameliorated, if the topography does not require high crossing pylons, by using a separate pylon for each conductor.

==Structures==
A &quot;crossing pylon&quot; is used for crossing over a body of water or a valley. Due to the long span, crossing pylons across rivers and sea straits are frequently taller than standard pylons. They may have marking lamps, and unlike standard pylons, often have stairways for easy access to the top. In many cases, their height makes them ideal for carrying radio antennas and transmitting equipment.

Crossing pylons for valleys, depending on the local topography, are not necessarily tall, but the distance between the conducting cables must be sufficient to prevent high winds knocking the conductors into one another; these pylons have wide crossbars to prevent this. For very long spans each phase has a separate pylon, particularly if the pylons are short.

Special crossing pylons are often used where aerial tramways cross power lines. These pylons are designed with integral scaffolding so that the tramway cars can be reached without touching a live power line. This enables passengers to be rescued from the tramway if it fails without cutting the power from the power line. Such installations can be found, for example, south of Zermatt, Switzerland; at the Patscherkofelbahn near Innsbruck, Austria; and at the Penkenbahn in Mayrhofen, Austria.

<text>The Prince of Achaea was the ruler of the Principality of Achaea, one of the crusader states founded in Greece in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade (1202–1204). The principality witnessed various overlords during its more than two centuries of existence, initially, Achaea was a vassal state of the Kingdom of Thessalonica under Boniface I of house Montferrat, then of the Latin Empire of Constantinople under the houses of Flanders-Courtenay, which had supplanted the Byzantine Empire, and later of the Angevin Kingdom of Naples. During the Angevin period, the princes were often absent, represented in the Principality by their baillis, who governed in their name. After 1404 the principality became sovereign as the Genoese Centurione II Zaccaria bought from the Neapolitan crown the princely rights.

The principality was one of the longest-lasting of the Latin states in Greece, outliving the Latin Empire itself by 171 years. It did not come to an end until 1432, when the Byzantine prince Thomas Palaiologos inherited the last remnants of the Principality through marriage to the daughter of the last prince, Centurione Zaccaria. With the Principality gone, the title of Prince of Achaea became vacant. However, in 1453 during the great Morean revolt of 1453-1454, John Asen Zaccaria, son of Centurione revived the Principality. He was confirmed as Prince by the Kingdom of Naples, the historical overlords of the Principality since 1267 and by Venice, though in 1455 John was forced to exile.

A title of the same styling, but not to be confused with the original sovereign princely title, was created almost two centuries later to honour the descent of Antonio di Tocco. Antonio was a descendant of Thomas Palaiologos and Catherine Zaccaria from a female line, twice broken. For this and several other reasons, he did not have a legal claim to the original title. Though in 1642, he successfully petitioned the King of Spain to exchange his patrimonial titles for a titular honour in the same styling of Prince of Achaea within the Neapolitan nobility. This titular honour was carried on with a sequence of titular princes that began with Antonio di Tocco and lasted until the death of his descendant Maria Maddalena Capece Galeota in 1933, whereafter the Neapolitan title became extinct.

== List of princes of Achaea, 1205–1432/54 ==

=== Champlitte dynasty (1205–1209) ===
After a brief tenure as prince, William I received news that his brother Louis in Burgundy had died and decided to return home to France to claim the family lands. To govern the principality of Achaea, he left his old friend Geoffrey of Villehardouin as bailiff. William I died on his journey home in 1209. Champlitte had stipulated before his journey home that any lawful heir of his would have to claim the principality within a year and a day in the event of his death, or their claims would be forfeit. After his death, news reached Villehardouin that a cousin of William, Robert of Champlitte, was on his way to claim the principality. Wishing to claim the principality for himself, Villehardouin, with the assistance of Venice, placed various obstacles in Robert&#x27;s way, including ensuring that he had to wait in Venice for two months before embarking, and once Robert reached Achaea, the time window stipulated by William had passed. Having obtained the principality through legal quibbles and fraud, Villehardouin was then proclaimed as the new Prince of Achaea.

=== Villehardouin dynasty (1210–1278) ===

=== Angevin domination (1278–1396) ===

==== House of Anjou (1278–1289) ====

==== Houses of Villehardouin, Avesnes and Savoy (1289–1307) ====
In 1307, Charles II revoked the position of Isabella and Philip I, on the grounds that their marriage having happened without his consent (despite having recognized Philip earlier) and Philip&#x27;s refusal to assist Charles II in the king&#x27;s campaigns against the Despotate of Epirus. Isabella and Florent had been granted the principality in 1289 on the condition that Isabella did not remarry without Charles II&#x27;s consent in the event of Florent&#x27;s death and Philip&#x27;s refusal to aid Charles II constituted a gross breach of the feudal code. Isabella&#x27;s eldest daughter, Matilda of Hainaut, may have unsuccessfully attempted to claim the principality in the immediate aftermath of her parents&#x27; deposition but was blocked from doing so by the local nobility, who awaited orders from Naples. Instead of seizing Achaea for himself once more, Charles bestowed it on his favorite son, Philip of Taranto, who soon after arrived in Achaea and received the allegiance of the local barons. To ensure that Isabella and Philip did not attempt to reclaim Achaea, their claims were also purchased and the couple were promised to County of Alba on the shores of the Fucine Lake as compensation.

==== House of Anjou (1307–1313) ====
In 1313, Philip II married Catherine of Valois, the titular Latin Empress, who had up until their marriage arrangements been betrothed to Hugh V, Duke of Burgundy. In order to compensate the House of Burgundy, it was arranged that Louis of Burgundy, Hugh V&#x27;s younger brother, would marry Matilda of Hainaut, the eldest daughter of Isabella of Villehardouin, and that the two would then be granted the Principality of Achaea. After marriage, however, Louis and Matilda delayed in travelling to Greece and in the meantime, the usurper Ferdinand of Majorca seized control of the principality.

==== House of Barcelona (1315–1316) ====

==== Houses of Avesnes and Bourbon (1316–1321) ====

After she was widowed in 1316, King Robert of Naples ruled that Matilda should marry his younger brother, John of Gravina, as part of a scheme to once more return the principality to the House of Anjou. Matilda however refused, and there was also protest from Odo IV of Burgundy, the brother and designated heir of Louis. Matilda was however brought to Naples by force and in 1318 compelled to go through with the marriage ceremony to John. Still defiant, the princess was brought before Pope John XXII at Avignon and there ordered to obey. Even when forced to marry by the pope, Matilda refused and replied that she had already married the Burgundian knight Hugh de La Palice, whom she was very attached to. This secret marriage gave Robert the excuse to revoke her position as Princess of Achaea, as she had not been allowed to marry without his consent per the agreements that preceded her elevation to the position. After a brief forced marriage to John, Matilda was imprisoned and the principality was simply bestowed upon John directly.

==== House of Anjou (1318–1381) ====

==== House of Baux (1381–1383) ====

=== Interregnum (1383–1396) ===
James of Baux died childless in 1383, which left his hired army, the Navarrese Company, as the sole authority in Achaea and putting the Angevin rule to end. The commanders of the Navarrese Company, Mahiot de Coquerel (until 1386) and Peter of San Superano (after 1386) kept up the pretense that they were representatives of the Kings of Naples, the closest and strongest of the possible claimants to the principality, but they were for all intents and purposes rulers of an independent realm.
In addition to the nominal princes listed above, there were also numerous other rival claimants that rose during this time:
* Louis I of Anjou – designated heir of James of Baux and heir of Joanna of Naples.
**Marie of Blois, Duchess of Anjou – widow and designated heir of Louis I of Anjou as regent for Louis II of Anjou. Eventually sold her claim to Juan Fernández de Heredia of the Knights Hospitaller
* Louis II, Duke of Bourbon – nephew and designated heir of Maria I of Bourbon (who ruled as princess 1364–1370).
* Amadeo of Savoy – grandson of Philip I of Savoy (who ruled as prince 1300–1307).
**Louis of Piedmont – brother and heir of Amadeo of Savoy.
* Juan Fernández de Heredia, Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller – sought to regain the principality for the Knights Hospitaller, eventually succeeded in purchasing the claims of Marie of Blois, though the sale was contested by Amadeo of Savoy and Antipope Clement VII annulled it.

=== Navarrese-Genoese dynasty (1396–1432/55) ===

== Timeline ==
== Later claimants ==

Upon the death of Centurione Zaccaria in 1432, his territories were forcefully inherited by Thomas Palaiologos, Despot of the Morea, who had married a daughter of Centurione, Catherine Zaccaria. Although Thomas thus ruled portions of the Peloponnese, including all of Centurione&#x27;s former territory, and had inherited the title through his marriage with Catherine, he never used it. Though he did not use or acknowledge the title, his brother-in-law, John Asen Zaccaria, successfully reclaimed his patrimonial inheritance and achieved international recognition as Prince of Achaea.

Some modern historians consider Thomas Palaiologos to have been the Prince of Achaea from 1432 to 1460, though that is a modern historiographical designation for him. 

=== The line of John Asen Zaccaria ===

In 1453, John Asen Zaccaria, the son of Centurione from his marriage with a woman of the Palaiologos Asen clan, reclaimed his father&#x27;s title and declared war against Thomas and his brother Demetrios. Unlike Thomas, John was confirmed as a legitimate Prince by the King of Naples Alfonso, and also by Venice. The recognition by Naples was a gesture of great significance due to the Crown of Naples being the suzerain of the Principality of Achaea since the Treaty of Viterbo that was signed in 1267 between Charles I of Anjou and William II of Villehardouin and the only legitimate force with the power to appoint Princes. It was also Naples and King Ladislaus that had also confirmed Centurione II, father of John, as Prince on 1404 and deprived Maria Zaccaria of her power as reigning princess. However, Thomas and his Turkish allies were victorious and John sought shelter in Venetian Modon and later in Italy. There he continued to be regarded as the legitimate Prince of Achaea by the Papacy. The Popes offered to John -&quot;domino Johanni Zaccarie olim Amoree principi&quot;- a symbolic pension of twenty florins a month. Zaccaria was also recognised as titular Prince of Morea by the city of Genoa, where he offered a precious reliquary, the so called &quot;Zaccaria Cross&quot; that presumably contained pieces of the True Cross belonging to St John the Evangelist. 

==== Imposter Pretenders ====

Some impostor pretenders to Byzantine descent historically claimed the position. From the late 15th century to 1530, the Albanian exile Constantine Arianiti claimed the title &quot;Duke of Achaea&quot;, among others. Later in the 16th century, the title might have been claimed by Giovanni Demetrio Angeli (1499–1571), part of the Angelo Flavio Comneno family, which claimed descent from the Byzantine Angelos dynasty.

=== The Tocco claims 1642–1933 ===
On 4 November 1642, Philip IV of Spain confirmed through a royal diploma the right of Antonio di Tocco to style himself as the titular Prince of Achaea.This title was of the same styling, but not to be confused with the original sovereign princely title, was created almost two centuries later to honour the descent of Antonio di Tocco. 

The Tocco were descended from Thomas and Catherine&#x27;s eldest daughter, Helena Palaiologina, and her middle daughter, Milica Branković. Since Antonio was a descendant from a female line, twice broken, and several other reasons, he did not have a legal claim to the original title. Though in the aforementioned year of 1642, he successfully petitioned the King of Spain to exchange his patrimonial titles for a titular honour in the same styling of Prince of Achaea within the Neapolitan nobility. This titular honour was carried on with a sequence of titular princes that began with Antonio di Tocco and lasted until the death of his descendant Maria Maddalena Capece Galeota in 1933, whereafter the Neapolitan title became extinct.

<doc id="1286017" wikidata="Q17081447" url="?curid=1286017" title="Slugs (autopilot system)">
<text>Slugs is an open-source autopilot system oriented toward inexpensive autonomous aircraft.
Low cost and wide availability enable hobbyist use in small remotely piloted aircraft. The project started in 2009 and is being further developed and used at Autonomous Systems Lab of University of California Santa Cruz. Several vendors produce Slugs autopilots and accessories.

==Overview==
An autopilot allows a remotely piloted aircraft to be flown out of sight. All hardware and software is open-source and freely available to anyone under the MIT licensing agreement. free software autopilots provide more flexible hardware and software. Users can modify the autopilot based on their own special requirements, such as forest fire evaluation. The free software approach from Slugs is similar to that from the paparazzi Project, PX4 autopilot, ArduPilot and OpenPilot where low cost and availability enables its hobbyist use in small remotely piloted aircraft such as micro air vehicles and miniature UAVs. Such frameworks are common in Open-source robotics.

===Software===
The open-source software suite contains everything to let airborne systems fly.

<doc id="1286023" wikidata="Q62918" url="?curid=1286023" title="Fazlur Rahman Khan">
<text>Fazlur Rahman Khan (, &quot;Fazlur Rôhman Khan&quot;; 3 April 1929 – 27 March 1982) was a Bangladeshi-American structural engineer and architect, who initiated important structural systems for skyscrapers. Considered the &quot;father of tubular designs&quot; for high-rises, Khan was also a pioneer in computer-aided design (CAD). He was the designer of the Sears Tower, since renamed Willis Tower, the tallest building in the world from 1973 until 1998, and the 100-story John Hancock Center.

A partner in the firm Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill in Chicago, Khan, more than any other individual, ushered in a renaissance in skyscraper construction during the second half of the 20th century. He has been called the &quot;Einstein of structural engineering&quot; and the &quot;Greatest Structural Engineer of the 20th Century&quot; for his innovative use of structural systems that remain fundamental to modern skyscraper design and construction. In his honor, the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat established the Fazlur Khan Lifetime Achievement Medal, as one of their CTBUH Skyscraper Awards.

Although best known for skyscrapers, Khan was also an active designer of other kinds of structures, including the Hajj airport terminal, the McMath–Pierce solar telescope and several stadium structures.

==Family and background==
Fazlur Rahman Khan was born on 3 April 1929 to a Bengali Muslim family in Dhaka, Bengal Presidency (present-day Bangladesh). He was from and brought up in the Khan Bari of Bhandarikandi in Madaripur, Faridpur District. His father, Khan Bahadur Abdur Rahman Khan, was a high school mathematics teacher and textbook author who eventually became the Director of Public Instruction in Bengal and after retirement served as the first Principal of Jagannath College. His mother, Khadijah Khatun, was the daughter of Abdul Basit Chowdhury, the Zamindar (aristocratic landowner) of Dulai in Pabna who traced his ancestry to a migrant from Samarkand in Turkestan. Khan&#x27;s paternal uncle, Abdul Hakim Khan, was the son-in-law of Syed Abdul Jabbar, a &quot;zamindar&quot; based in Comilla.

==Early life and education==
Khan attended Armanitola Government High School, in Dhaka. After that, he studied Civil Engineering in Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur (present day Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur), Kolkata, India, and then received his Bachelor of Civil Engineering degree from Ahsanullah Engineering College (now Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology). He received a Fulbright Scholarship and a government scholarship, which enabled him to travel to the United States in 1952. There he studied at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. In three years Khan earned two master&#x27;s degrees – one in structural engineering and one in theoretical and applied mechanics – and a PhD in structural engineering with thesis titled &quot;Analytical Study of Relations Among Various Design Criteria for Rectangular Prestressed Concrete Beams&quot;.

His hometown in Dhaka did not have any buildings taller than three stories. He did not view his first skyscraper in person until the age of 21 years old, and he had not stepped inside a mid-rise building until he moved to the United States for graduate school. Despite this, the environment of his hometown in Dhaka later influenced his tube building concept, which was inspired by the bamboo that sprouted around Dhaka. He found that a hollow tube, like the bamboo in Dhaka, lent a high-rise vertical durability.

===Career===
In 1955, employed by the architectural firm Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (SOM), he began working in Chicago. He was made a partner in 1966. He worked the rest of his life side by side with fellow architect Bruce Graham. Khan introduced design methods and concepts for efficient use of material in building architecture. His first building to employ the tube structure was the Chestnut De-Witt apartment building. During the 1960s and 1970s, he became noted for his designs for Chicago&#x27;s 100-story John Hancock Center and 110-story Sears Tower, since renamed Willis Tower, the tallest building in the world from 1973 until 1998.

He believed that engineers needed a broader perspective on life, saying, &quot;The technical man must not be lost in his own technology; he must be able to appreciate life, and life is art, drama, music, and most importantly, people.&quot;

Khan&#x27;s personal papers, most of which were in his office at the time of his death, are held by the Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago. The Fazlur Khan Collection includes manuscripts, sketches, audio cassette tapes, slides and other materials regarding his work.

===Personal life===
For enjoyment, Khan loved singing Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s poetic songs in Bengali. He and his wife, Liselotte, an immigrant from Austria, had one daughter who was born in 1960. In 1967, he elected to become a United States citizen. Khan was a Muslim at the time when he died.

==Innovations==
Khan discovered that the rigid steel frame structure that had long dominated tall building design was not the only system fitting for tall buildings, marking the start of a new era of skyscraper construction.

===Tube structural systems===
Khan&#x27;s central innovation in skyscraper design and construction was the idea of the &quot;tube&quot; structural system for tall buildings, including the &quot;framed tube&quot;, &quot;trussed tube&quot;, and &quot;bundled tube&quot; variants. His &quot;tube concept&quot;, using all the exterior wall perimeter structure of a building to simulate a thin-walled tube, revolutionized tall building design. Most buildings over 40 stories constructed since the 1960s now use a tube design derived from Khan&#x27;s structural engineering principles.

Lateral loads (horizontal forces) such as wind forces, seismic forces, etc., begin to dominate the structural system and take on increasing importance in the overall building system as the building height increases. Wind forces become very substantial, and forces caused by earthquakes, etc. are important as well. The tubular designs resist such forces for tall buildings. Tube structures are stiff and have significant advantages over other framing systems. They not only make the buildings structurally stronger and more efficient, but also significantly reduce the structural material requirements. The reduction of material makes the buildings economically more efficient and reduces environmental impact. The tubular designs enable buildings to reach even greater heights. Tubular systems allow greater interior space and further enable buildings to take on various shapes, offering added freedom to architects. These new designs opened an economic door for contractors, engineers, architects, and investors, providing vast amounts of real estate space on minimal plots of land. Khan was among a group of engineers who encouraged a rebirth in skyscraper construction after a hiatus of over thirty years.

The tubular systems have yet to reach their limit when it comes to height. Another important feature of the tubular systems is that buildings can be constructed using steel or reinforced concrete, or a composite of the two, to reach greater heights. Khan pioneered the use of lightweight concrete for high-rise buildings, at a time when reinforced concrete was used for mostly low-rise construction of only a few stories in height. Most of Khan&#x27;s designs were conceived considering pre-fabrication and repetition of components so projects could be quickly built with minimal errors.

The population explosion, starting with the baby boom of the 1950s, created widespread concern about the amount of available living space, which Khan solved by building upward. More than any other 20th-century engineer, Fazlur Rahman Khan made it possible for people to live and work in &quot;cities in the sky&quot;. Mark Sarkisian (Director of Structural and Seismic Engineering at Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill) said, &quot;Khan was a visionary who transformed skyscrapers into sky cities while staying firmly grounded in the fundamentals of engineering.&quot;

===Framed tube===
Since 1963, the new structural system of framed tubes became highly influential in skyscraper design and construction. Khan defined the framed tube structure as &quot;a three dimensional space structure composed of three, four, or possibly more frames, braced frames, or shear walls, joined at or near their edges to form a vertical tube-like structural system capable of resisting lateral forces in any direction by cantilevering from the foundation.&quot; Closely spaced interconnected exterior columns form the tube. Horizontal loads, for example from wind and earthquakes, are supported by the structure as a whole. About half the exterior surface is available for windows. Framed tubes allow fewer interior columns, and so create more usable floor space. The bundled tube structure is more efficient for tall buildings, lessening the penalty for height. The structural system also allows the interior columns to be smaller and the core of the building to be free of braced frames or shear walls that use valuable floor space. Where larger openings like garage doors are required, the tube frame must be interrupted, with transfer girders used to maintain structural integrity.

The first building to apply the tube-frame construction was the DeWitt-Chestnut Apartment Building, since renamed Plaza on DeWitt, building that Bruce Graham designed and Khan did the engineering for was completed in Chicago in 1963. This laid the foundations for the framed tube structure used in the construction of the World Trade Center.

===Trussed tube and X-bracing===
Khan pioneered several other variants of the tube structure design. One of these was the concept of applying X-bracing to the exterior of the tube to form a &quot;trussed tube&quot;. X-bracing reduces the lateral load on a building by transferring the load into the exterior columns, and the reduced need for interior columns provides a greater usable floor space. Khan first employed exterior X-bracing on his engineering of the John Hancock Center in 1965, and this can be clearly seen on the building&#x27;s exterior, making it an architectural icon.

In contrast to earlier steel frame structures, such as the Empire State Building (1931), which required about 206 kilograms of steel per square meter and One Chase Manhattan Plaza (1961), which required around 275 kilograms of steel per square meter, the John Hancock Center was far more efficient, requiring only 145 kilograms of steel per square meter. The trussed tube concept was applied to many later skyscrapers, including the Onterie Center, Citigroup Center and Bank of China Tower.
===Bundle tube===
One of Khan&#x27;s most important variants of the tube structure concept was the &quot;bundled tube&quot;, which was used for the Willis Tower and One Magnificent Mile. The bundled tube design was not only the most efficient in economic terms, but it was also &quot;innovative in its potential for versatile formulation of architectural space. Efficient towers no longer had to be box-like; the tube-units could take on various shapes and could be bundled together in different sorts of groupings.&quot;

===Tube in tube===
Tube-in-tube system takes advantage of core shear wall tubes in addition to exterior tubes. The inner tube and outer tube work together to resist gravity loads and lateral loads and to provide additional rigidity to the structure to prevent significant deflections at the top. This design was first used in One Shell Plaza. Later buildings to use this structural system include the Petronas Towers.

===Outrigger and belt truss===
The outrigger and belt truss system is a lateral load resisting system in which the tube structure is connected to the central core wall with very stiff outriggers and belt trusses at one or more levels. BHP House was the first building to use this structural system followed by the First Wisconsin Center, since renamed U.S. Bank Center, in Milwaukee. The center rises 601 feet, with three belt trusses at the bottom, middle and top of the building. The exposed belt trusses serve aesthetic and structural purposes. Later buildings to use this include Shanghai World Financial Center.

===Concrete tube structures===
The last major buildings engineered by Khan were the One Magnificent Mile and Onterie Center in Chicago, which employed his bundled tube and trussed tube system designs respectively. In contrast to his earlier buildings, which were mainly steel, his last two buildings were concrete. His earlier DeWitt-Chestnut Apartments building, built in 1963 in Chicago, was also a concrete building with a tube structure. Trump Tower in New York City is another example that adapted this system.

===Shear wall frame interaction system===
Khan developed the shear wall frame interaction system for mid high-rise buildings. This structural system uses combinations of shear walls and frames designed to resist lateral forces. The first building to use this structural system was the 35-stories Brunswick Building. The Brunswick building was completed in 1965 and became the tallest reinforced concrete structure of its time. The structural system of Brunswick Building consists of a concrete shear wall core surrounded by an outer concrete frame of columns and spandrels. Apartment buildings up to 70 stories high have successfully used this concept.

===Legacy===
Khan&#x27;s seminal work of developing tall building structural systems are still used today as the starting point when considering design options for tall buildings. Tube structures have since been used in many skyscrapers, including the construction of the World Trade Center, Aon Center, Petronas Towers, Jin Mao Building, Bank of China Tower and most other buildings in excess of 40 stories constructed since the 1960s. The strong influence of tube structure design is also evident in the world&#x27;s current tallest skyscraper, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. According to Stephen Bayley of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;:
==Life cycle civil engineering==
Khan and Mark Fintel conceived ideas of shock absorbing soft-stories, for protecting structures from abnormal loading, particularly strong earthquakes, over a long period of time. This concept was a precursor to modern seismic isolation systems. The structures are designed to behave naturally during earthquakes where traditional concepts of material ductility are replaced by mechanisms that allow for movement during ground shaking while protecting material elasticity.

The IALCCE established the Fazlur R. Khan Life-Cycle Civil Engineering Medal.

==Other architectural work==

Khan designed several notable structures that are not skyscrapers. Examples include the Hajj terminal of King Abdulaziz International Airport, completed in 1981, which consists of tent-like roofs that are folded up when not in use. The project received several awards, including the Aga Khan Award for Architecture, which described it as an &quot;outstanding contribution to architecture for Muslims&quot;. The tent-like tensile structures advanced the theory and technology of fabric as a structural material and led the way to its use for other types of terminals and large spaces.

Khan also designed the King Abdulaziz University, the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs and the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis. With Bruce Graham, Khan developed a cable-stayed roof system for the Baxter Travenol Laboratories in Deerfield, Illinois.

==Computers for structural engineering and architecture==
In the 1970s, engineers were just starting to use computer structural analysis on a large scale. SOM was at the center of these new developments, with undeniable contributions from Khan. Graham and Khan lobbied SOM partners to purchase a mainframe computer, a risky investment at a time, when new technologies were just starting to form. The partners agreed, and Khan began programming the system to calculate structural engineering equations, and later, to develop architectural drawings.

<text>Hartland de Montarville Molson, (May 29, 1907 – September 28, 2002) was an Anglo-Quebecer statesman, Canadian senator, military aviator, and a member of the Molson family of brewers.

==Education==
Born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to a wealthy brewing family (father was Colonel Herbert Molson), Hartland Molson was educated at Selwyn House School in Montreal, Bishop&#x27;s College School in Lennoxville, Quebec and Charterhouse School in England before attending the Royal Military College of Canada at Kingston, Ontario arriving in 1924, there he played ice hockey for the Kingston Juniors team that made it to 1926 Memorial Cup finals. An all-around athlete, Molson also played first string football, made it to the college&#x27;s boxing finals twice, and was a member of the track and field team. After graduating in 1928, the bilingual Molson was then sent for training in finance as an employee at a bank in Paris, France. On his return home, he earned his Chartered Accountant designation and in his spare time took flying lessons. In accord with his arrangement with the service following military college, Molson served as a reserve officer in the Militia for five years. He reached the rank of Lieutenant while with the 27th Field Battery between 1928 and 1933.
==Family==
In 1931, he married Helen Hogg but divorced in 1938. They had a daughter, Zoe. She married Henry Nicholas Paul Hardinge, 5th Viscount Hardinge, and moved to live in Jersey.

His second wife, Magdalena Posner, died in 1982. In 1990 Molson married Peggy deLancey Robinson, the widow of former Senator Theodore Meighen. He remained married to Peggy until her death on 18 December 2000. Through his marriage to Peggy, he was also a stepfather to Senator Michael Meighen.

==Wartime military service==
Molson enlisted in Montreal, Quebec on 21 September 1939 within weeks of the onset of World War II becoming a member of the Royal Canadian Air Force. He earned his wings on 11 April 1940 and was assigned to No. 115 Squadron RCAF in Montreal. He was one of a handful of No. 115 Squadron pilots transferred to No. 1 Squadron RCAF in the spring of 1940 to bolster its numbers in preparation for shipment to the United Kingdom. Arriving in England in June 1940, the squadron underwent rapid training in Royal Air Force (RAF) procedures before being thrown into the desperate battles in the skies over the UK. During the Battle of Britain, he damaged a Do 17 on 26 August, damaged two Messerschmitt Bf 110s on 4 September and claimed a Heinkel He 111 destroyed on 11 September. Molson was shot down during combat with enemy fighters over Canterbury on 5 October, bailed out, wounded, and was admitted to Chartham Hospital. His Hurricane, P3873, crashed at Deering Farm, Smarden. It was his last operational flight. Molson had flown 62 combat missions.

Molson was repatriated to Canada for convalescence. Upon being declared once again fit for flying duties, he was promoted to squadron leader and given command of No. 118 Squadron RCAF flying Grumman Goblins and later Curtiss Kittyhawks at RCAF Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. A command he held from 23 July 1941 to 14 June 1942. When No. 118 Squadron was transferred to the Pacific coast, Molson remained in Dartmouth taking command of 126 Squadron flying Hurricanes. He commanded No. 126 Squadron until 6 September 1942. He took command of No. 8 Service Flying Training School at RCAF Station Moncton in October and oversaw its move to RCAF Station Weyburn Saskatchewan in January 1944. In March 1944 Molson, now a Group Captain, was given command of RCAF Station St-Hubert after a very short stay back in Moncton. On 7 June 1945, Molson was transferred to RCAF Headquarters in Ottawa where he would work at the Directorate of Personnel for the remainder of his time in uniform. He was discharged from the service in September 1945 following the German surrender. For his leadership and wartime service, he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1946.

==Business==
At home in Montreal, in 1948 Hartland Molson was named Governor of McGill University, a position he held for the next twenty years. In 1953, he was appointed President of the family&#x27;s brewing empire, Molson Breweries. He served as president between 1953 and 1966, then Chairman until 1974 and Chairman emeritus until 1983, retiring completely in 1988. During his tenure, the company experienced substantial growth, expanding operations across Canada. Outside of the Molson family businesses, Hartland Molson served on the Board of Directors of a number of major Canadian companies including the Bank of Montreal and Sun Life Assurance.

==Senate==
In 1955, Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent appointed Molson to the Senate of Canada. Hartland Molson retired from the Senate in 1993 at the age of 86—one of the last Senators to serve past the mandatory retirement age of 75 as he was appointed before the institution of the limit in 1965 and thus exempt. John Michael Macdonald was the last senator to serve past the age of 75 (he died in office in 1997).

==Hockey==
In 1957, in partnership with his brother Thomas Henry Pentland Molson (1901–1978), Molson purchased the Montreal Canadiens ice hockey team. As a member of the Board of Governors of the National Hockey League, Molson was instrumental in raising the profile of both the league and his brewing company through sponsorship of the Hockey Night in Canada television broadcasts. As head of the Montreal Canadiens team, he helped develop the personnel to end the Detroit Red Wings dominance, building one of the greatest dynasties in all of sport. After winning the 1968 Stanley Cup Hartland retired, and David, Peter, and William Molson took over control of the Canadiens. The team was sold in 1972 to Edward and Peter Bronfman. Senator Hartland Molson&#x27;s name was engraved on the Stanley Cup 6 times 1958-59-60-65-66-68. In 1973, he was inducted into the builders category of the Hockey Hall of Fame.

==FLQ threat==
Molson&#x27;s high-profile image made him a prime target for the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ), a terrorist organization dedicated to Quebec sovereignty. During the 1970 October Crisis, when British diplomat James Cross was kidnapped and Pierre Laporte, the Vice-Premier of Quebec, was kidnapped and murdered, Hartland Molson&#x27;s name was found on a terrorists&#x27; list of future victims.

==Philanthropy==
Molson was involved with a number of philanthropic causes. He co-initiated the Molson Foundation in 1958, with his brother Thomas Henry Pentland Molson, which has contributed to a broad spectrum of areas, including the arts, sports, infrastructure projects, the Molson nature reserve, and several faculties. Renamed the Molson Family Foundation in 1981, it has dispersed over $120 million in grants. It has also made major gifts to the Montreal Neurological Institute and Montreal General Hospital, the Canadian Paraplegic Association, the Douglas Hospital Corporation, and the Boy Scouts of Canada.

==Awards and recognition==

In 1995, Molson was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and in 2000, the Ordre national du Québec, the highest civilian honor of his country and his native province. Hartland Molson Hall at Bishop&#x27;s College School is named for him. 438th Tactical Helicopter Squadron in Saint-Hubert named their hangar and a cenotaph after him on August 28, 2009. In 2009, 1800 Honourable Hartland de Montaville Molson, OC, OBE, OQ, DCL, FCA (1907–2002) was added to the wall of honour at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario.

==Fishing==
Molson was a well-known salmon fisherman on the Bonaventure River; in Gaspesie.

==Archives==
The Molson fonds at Library and Archives Canada include a Hartland Molson sub-series.

<text>New Zealanders () are people associated with New Zealand, sharing a common history, culture, and language (New Zealand English). People of various ethnicities and national origins are citizens of New Zealand, governed by its nationality law.

Originally composed solely of the indigenous Māori, the ethnic makeup of the population has been dominated since the 19th century by New Zealanders of European descent, mainly of English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish ancestry, with smaller percentages of other European and Middle Eastern ancestries such as Greek, Turkish, Italian and other groups such as Arab, German, Dutch, Scandinavian, South Slavic and Jewish, with Western European groups predominating. Today, the ethnic makeup of the New Zealand population is undergoing a process of change, with new waves of immigration, higher birth rates and increasing interracial marriage resulting in the New Zealand population of Māori, Asian, Pasifika and multiracial descent growing at a higher rate than those of solely European descent, with such groups projected to make up a larger proportion of the population in the future. New Zealand has an estimated resident population of around Over one million New Zealanders recorded in the 2013 New Zealand census were born overseas, and by 2021 over a quarter of New Zealanders are estimated to be foreign born. Rapidly increasing ethnic groups vary from being well-established, such as Indians and Chinese, to nascent ones such as African New Zealanders.

While most New Zealanders are resident in New Zealand, there is also a significant diaspora, estimated at around 750,000. Of these, about 640,800 lived in Australia (), which was equivalent to of the resident population of New Zealand. Other communities of New Zealanders abroad are heavily concentrated in other English-speaking countries, specifically the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada, with smaller numbers located elsewhere. New Zealanders have had a cultural influence on a global scale, through film, language, te ao Māori, art, science, music and technology, and founded the modern women&#x27;s suffrage and anti-nuclear movements. Technological and scientific achievements of New Zealanders stem back as far as Kupe and the earliest Polynesian navigators, who used sophisticated astral methods that helped laid the groundwork for both navigation and modern astronomy. Modern trench warfare is often argued to have originated in New Zealand among Māori in the 19th century. New Zealanders also pioneered nuclear physics (Ernest Rutherford), the women&#x27;s suffrage movement (Kate Sheppard), modern Western conceptions of gender identity (John Money&quot;)&quot; and plastic surgery (Harold Gillies).

New Zealand culture is essentially a Western culture influenced by the unique environment and geographic isolation of the islands, and the cultural input of the Māori and the various waves of multiethnic migration which followed the British colonisation of New Zealand. A colloquial name for New Zealanders is a [[Kiwi (nickname)|Kiwi]] ().

==Ethnic origins==

The table above shows the broad ethnic composition of the New Zealand population at the 1961 census compared to that from the most recent data of the 2013 census. People of European descent constituted the majority of the 4.2 million people living in New Zealand, with 2,969,391 or 74.0% of the population in the 2013 New Zealand census. Those of full or part-Māori ancestry comprise 14.9% of New Zealanders. The residual &quot;others&quot; ethnic group consists largely of Asians and Pacific Islanders.
===Māori===
The Māori people are most likely descended from people who emigrated from Taiwan to Melanesia and then travelled east through to the Society Islands. After a pause of 70 to 265 years, a new wave of exploration led to the discovery and settlement of New Zealand in about AD 1250–1300, making New Zealand one of the most recently settled major landmasses. Some researchers have suggested an earlier wave of arrivals dating to as early as AD 50–150; these people then either died out or left the islands.

Over the following centuries the Polynesian settlers developed into a distinct culture now known as Māori. The population was divided into iwi (tribes) and hapū (subtribes) which would cooperate, compete and sometimes fight with each other. At some point a group of Māori migrated to the Chatham Islands where they developed their distinct Moriori culture.

Due to New Zealand&#x27;s geographic isolation, 500 years passed before the next phase of settlement, the arrival of Europeans. Only then did the indigenous inhabitants need to distinguish themselves from the new arrivals, using the term &quot;Māori&quot; which means &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;ordinary&quot;.
Between the mid-1840s through to the 1860s, disputes over questionable land purchases led to the New Zealand Wars, which resulted in large tracts of tribal land being confiscated by the colonial government. Settlements such as Parihaka in Taranaki have become almost legendary because of injustices done there. With the loss of much of their land coupled with high fatality rate due to introduced diseases and epidemics, Māori went into a period of decline, and in the late 19th century it was believed that the Māori population would cease to exist as a separate race and would be assimilated into the European population.

However, the predicted decline did not occur, and numbers recovered. Despite a high degree of intermarriage between Māori and European populations, Māori were able to retain their cultural identity and in the 1960s and 1970s Māoridom underwent a cultural revival.
The Māori population has seen stability in the 21st century. In the 2013 Census, 598,602 people identified as being part of the Māori ethnic group, accounting for 14.9% of the New Zealand population, while 668,724 people (17.5%) claimed Māori descent. 278,199 people identified as of sole Māori ethnicity, while 291,015 identified as of both European and Māori ethnicity (with or without a third ethnicity), due to a high rate of intermarriage between the two cultures. Under the Maori Affairs Amendment Act 1974, a Māori is defined as &quot;a person of the Māori race of New Zealand; and includes any descendant of such a person&quot;, replacing an earlier legal application based on an arbitrarily defined &quot;degree of Maori blood&quot;.

According to the 2006 census, the largest iwi by population is Ngāpuhi (125,601), followed by Ngāti Porou (71,049), Ngāi Tahu (54,819) and Waikato (40,083). However, over 110,000 people of Māori descent in the 2013 census could not identify their iwi. Outside of New Zealand, a large Māori population exists in Australia, estimated at 155,000 in 2011. The Māori Party has suggested a special seat should be created in the New Zealand parliament representing Māori in Australia. Smaller communities also exist in the United Kingdom (approx. 8,000), the United States (up to 3,500) and Canada (approx. 1,000).

The most common region this group lived in was Auckland Region (23.9 percent or 142,770 people). They are the second-largest ethnic group in New Zealand, after European New Zealanders. In addition, more than 120,000 Māori live in Australia. 
The Māori language (known as &quot;Te Reo Māori&quot;) is still spoken to some extent by about a fifth of all Māori, representing 3% of the total population. Many New Zealanders regularly use Māori words and expressions, such as &quot;kia ora&quot;, while speaking English. Māori are active in all spheres of New Zealand culture and society, with independent representation in areas such as media, politics and sport.

===European===
Most European New Zealanders have British and/or Irish ancestry, with smaller percentages of other European ancestries such as Germans, Poles (historically noted as &quot;Germans&quot; due to Partitions of Poland), French, Dutch, Scandinavian and South Slavs. In 1961, the census showed that 91.8% of New Zealanders self-identified as being of European descent, down from 95% in 1926.

The Māori-language loanword &quot;Pākehā&quot; came into use to refer to European New Zealanders, although some European New Zealanders reject this appellation. Twenty-first century New Zealanders increasingly use the word &quot;Pākehā&quot; to refer to all non-Polynesian New Zealanders.

The first Europeans known to have reached New Zealand were the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman and his crew in 1642. Māori killed several of the crew, and no more Europeans went to New Zealand until British explorer James Cook&#x27;s voyage of 1768–71. Cook reached New Zealand in 1769 and mapped almost the entire coastline. Following Cook, New Zealand was visited by numerous European and North American whaling, sealing, exploring and trading ships. They traded European food and goods, especially metal tools and weapons, for Māori timber, food, artefacts and water. On occasion, Europeans and Māori traded goods for sex. Some early European arrivals integrated closely with the indigenous Māori people and became known as Pākehā Māori. James Belich characterises many of the very early European settlers as forerunners of a &quot;crew culture&quot; – as distinct from the majority of later European immigrants.
The Treaty of Waitangi was first signed in the Bay of Islands on 6 February 1840. Confusion and disagreement continue to surround the Treaty. However, most New Zealanders still regard &quot;the Treaty&quot; as marking New Zealand&#x27;s foundation as a nation.

In response to attempts by the New Zealand Company to establish a separate colony in Wellington, and mindful of French claims in Akaroa, Hobson, appointed as Lieutenant-Governor on 14 January 1840, declared British sovereignty over all of New Zealand on 21 May 1840. He published two proclamations published in the &quot;New Zealand Advertiser and Bay Of Islands Gazette&quot; issue of 19 June 1840. One &quot;assert[s] on the grounds of Discovery, the Sovereign Rights of Her Majesty over the Southern Islands of New Zealand, commonly called &#x27;The Middle Island&#x27; (South Island) and &#x27;Stewart&#x27;s Island&#x27; (Stewart Island / Rakiura); and the Island, commonly called &#x27;The Northern Island&#x27;, having been ceded Sovereignty to Her Majesty&quot;. The second proclamation expanded on how sovereignty over the &quot;Northern Island&quot; had been ceded under the treaty signed that February.

Following the formalising of sovereignty, an organised and structured flow of migrants from Great Britain and Ireland began, and by 1860 more than 100,000 British and Irish settlers lived throughout New Zealand. The Otago Association actively recruited settlers from Scotland, generating a definite Scottish influence in Murihiku, while the Canterbury Association recruited settlers from the south of England, giving a definite English influence to the &quot;Canterbury Settlement&quot;. By 1870 the non-Māori population reached over 250,000.

Other settlers came from Germany, Scandinavia, and other parts of Europe as well as from China and the Indian subcontinent, but British and Irish settlers made up the vast majority, and did so for the next 150 years.

Between 1881 and the 1920s, the New Zealand Parliament passed legislation that intended to limit Asiatic migration to New Zealand, and prevented Asians from naturalising.
In particular, the New Zealand government levied a poll tax on Chinese immigrants up until the 1930s, when Japan went to war with China. New Zealand finally abolished the poll tax in 1944.
An influx of Jewish refugees from central Europe came in the 1930s.
Many of the persons of Polish origin in New Zealand arrived as orphans from Eastern Poland via Siberia and Iran in 1944 during World War II.

==== Post-WWII European immigration ====
With the agencies of the United Nations dealing with humanitarian efforts following the Second World War, New Zealand accepted about 5,000 refugees and displaced persons from Europe, and more than 1,100 Hungarians between 1956 and 1959 (see &quot;Refugees in New Zealand&quot;). The post-WWII immigration included more persons from Greece, Italy, Poland and the former Yugoslavia.

New Zealand limited immigration to those who would meet a labour shortage in New Zealand. To encourage those to come, the Government introduced free and assisted passages in 1947, a schema expanded by the First National Government in 1950. However, when it became clear that not enough skilled migrants would come from the British Isles alone, recruitment began in Northern European countries. New Zealand signed a bilateral agreement for skilled migrants with the Netherlands, and a large number of Dutch immigrants arrived in New Zealand. Others came in the 1950s from Denmark, Germany, Switzerland and Austria to meet needs in specialised occupations.
By the 1960s, the policy of excluding people based on nationality yielded a population overwhelmingly European in origin. By the mid-1960s, a desire for cheap unskilled labour led to ethnic diversification.

===Asian===
In the 2013 Census, Asian ancestries total was 11.8% of the population, Chinese remained the largest Asian ethnic group in 2013, with 171,411 people while Indian was the second-largest Asian ethnic group in 2013, with 155,178 with Filipino a distant third with 40,350 people.

The Asian component actually predates the Pacific component. There had been people of Asian ethnicity living in New Zealand from the early days of European settlement, albeit in very small numbers. During the period of gold rushes later in the nineteenth century the number of Chinese temporary settlers both from China and from Australia and America increased sharply. This was an interlude in many respects, though there was a small population which remained and settled permanently. However, a century later in the 1980s and 1990s the number of people of Asian ethnicities grew rapidly, and they are likely to exceed the Pacific population within the next few years.

===Pacific Islanders===
In the 1950s and 1960s, New Zealand encouraged migrants from the South Pacific. The country had a large demand for unskilled labour in the manufacturing sector. As long as this demand continued, migrants were encouraged by the government to come from the South Pacific, and many overstayed. However, when the boom times stopped, some blamed the migrants for the economic downturn affecting the country, and many of those people suffered dawn raids from 1974.

===Middle Eastern, Latin American and African===

This component was 1.2% of the total population in the 2013 census. The Latin American ethnic group almost doubled in size between the 2006 and 2013 censuses, increasing from 6,654 people to 13,182. A more recent component comprises refugees and other settlers from Africa and the Middle East, most recently from Somalia. While there had been previous settlers from the Middle East, such as Syrians, people from Equatorial Africa have been very few in the past. 
* Middle Eastern ethnic group – 20,406
* African ethnic group – 13,464

===Others===
In 2013, 67,752 people or 1.7% self-identified with one or more ethnicities &quot;other than&quot; European, Māori, Pacific, Asian, Middle Eastern, Latin American, and African. The vast majority of these people, 65,973 people, identified only as &#x27;New Zealander&#x27;.

==Race and ethnic relations==
After 1840, many issues to do with sovereignty and land ownership remained unresolved and, for a long time, invisible while Māori lived in rural communities. When Māori and Pākehā (Europeans) began living in closer proximity, the belief that the country had &quot;the best race relations in the world&quot; was tested. The first Race Relations Concilitator was appointed in 1971 to help combat racial discrimination among New Zealanders.

Agitation regarding Treaty of Waitangi violations intensified in the 1970s. The Waitangi Tribunal was set up in 1975 to consider alleged breaches, and in 1984 was empowered to look back to 1840.

In general, New Zealanders of European descent consider themselves to be mostly free of racial prejudice, perceiving the country to be a more inclusive society, a notion that has been challenged especially by members of ethnic minority groups. According to research published in 2018, which analysed New Zealand adults&#x27; reported experience of racism over a 10-year period, reported recent racist experiences were highest among Asian participants followed by Māori and Pacific peoples, with Europeans reporting the lowest experience of racism.

==Culture==
New Zealand culture is essentially a Western culture influenced by the unique environment and geographic isolation of the islands, and the cultural input of the Māori and the various waves of multiethnic migration which followed the British colonisation of New Zealand. British settlers brought a legal, political, and economic system that has flourished, along with the British system of agriculture that has transformed the landscape.

The development of a New Zealand identity and national character, separate from the British colonial identity, is most often linked with the period surrounding the First World War, which gave rise to the concept of the Anzac spirit. However, cultural links between New Zealand and Great Britain are maintained by a common language, sustained immigration from the UK, and the fact that many young New Zealanders spend time in Britain on &quot;overseas experience&quot;, known as &quot;OE&quot;. New Zealanders also identify closely with Australians, as a result of the two nations&#x27; shared historical, cultural and geographic characteristics.
The New Zealand government promotes Māori culture by supporting Māori-language schools, by ensuring the language is visible in government departments and literature, by insisting on traditional Māori welcomes (pōwhiri) at government functions and state school award programs, and by having Māori run the welfare services targeted at their people.

New Zealanders are distinctive for their twangy dialect of English and propensity to travel long distances, and are quickly associated with the All Blacks rugby team and the haka. A tradition of resourcefulness came from the pioneering backgrounds of both Māori and non-Māori.

===National personifications===

&quot;Zealandia&quot; is a national personification of New Zealand and New Zealanders. In her stereotypical form, Zealandia appears as a woman of European descent who is dressed in flowing robes (or gown). She is similar in dress and appearance to Britannia (the female personification of Britain), who is said to be the mother of Zealandia.

As a rhetorical evocation of a New Zealand national identity, Zealandia appeared on postage stamps, posters, cartoons, war memorials, and New Zealand government publications most commonly during the first half of the 20th century. The personification was a commonly used symbol of the New Zealand Centennial Exhibition, which was held in Wellington in 1939 and 1940. Two large Zealandia statues serve as war memorials that honour the casualties of the Second Boer War: one is in Waimate and the other is in Palmerston. Some smaller statues exist in museums and in private hands.

The female figure who appears on the left side of the national coat of arms has been identified as Zealandia (in a &quot;cut down nightie&quot;).

===Inventions===
Māori, and other Polynesians, have been credited by many historians as being the world&#x27;s foremost navigators prior to the modern age. Polynesians made contact with nearly every island within the vast Polynesian Triangle, inventing the catamaran and conceiving some of the most complex astronomy in the world to help navigate the Pacific. The continuance of this knowledge after the immediate settlement of New Zealand is evident in the non-tangible 360° compass developed and used by Māori long before European settlement. Māori compasses were divided into 32 different &quot;whare&quot;, or houses, between north, south, east, and west. This helped navigators memorise upwards of 200 stars. Memorisation was integral to Māori knowledge, which had no written language. Oral tradition was maintained in New Zealand by guilds for centuries after Māori arrival, despite later colonial efforts to suppress it.

In the New Zealand Wars (1845–1872), the Māori developed elaborate trench and bunker systems as part of the already-existent fortified areas known as pā, employing them successfully as early as the 1840s to withstand British artillery bombardments. These systems included firing trenches, communication trenches, tunnels, and anti-artillery bunkers. The Ngāpuhi pā Ruapekapeka is often considered to be the most technologically impressive by historians, and was described in 2017 as &quot;one of the most sophisticated military installations&quot; the British Empire had ever tackled, by broadcaster Mihingarangi Forbes for RNZ. There has been an academic debate surrounding this since the 1980s, when in his book &quot;The New Zealand Wars,&quot; historian James Belich claimed that Northern Māori had effectively invented trench warfare during the first stages of the New Zealand Wars. However, given that trenches of some form or another have always been present in human warfare, this conclusion has been contentious and criticised by other historians.

New Zealanders in the modern era have been prolific innovators. Instant coffee, today a staple drink across the world, was first invented in Invercargill in 1890 by food chemist David Strang. Katherine Sheppard, a suffragette, is regarded as the mother of the modern women&#x27;s suffrage movement. Her efforts within the Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union New Zealand led to New Zealand becoming the first nation in the world to enact universal suffrage.

Sexologist John Money, recognised today as a contentious figure for his experiments regarding children and the David Reimer case, was a pioneer of modern gender identity studies. Money&#x27;s theory that gender is learnt has become outdated and even condemned, although his terms &quot;gender role&quot; and &quot;sexual orientation&quot; remain common in modern parlance. He also established the Johns Hopkins Gender Identity Clinic, the first clinic in the United States to perform sexual reassignment surgeries. Surgeon and otolaryngologist Harold Gillies is regarded as the father of modern plastic surgery, which he pioneered on soldiers physically dismembered beyond regular care during the First World War.

===Language===

English (New Zealand English) is the dominant language spoken by New Zealanders, and a &quot;de facto&quot; official language of New Zealand. According to the 2013 New Zealand census, 96.1% of New Zealanders spoke English. The country&#x27;s &quot;de jure&quot; official languages are Māori (Te Reo) and New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL). Other languages are also used by ethnic communities.

===Religion===
Just under half of the population at the 2013 census declared an affiliation to Christianity. However, regular church attendance is probably closer to 15%. Before European colonisation the religion of the indigenous Māori population was animistic, but the subsequent efforts of missionaries such as Samuel Marsden resulted in many Māori converting to Christianity.

Religious affiliation has been collected in the New Zealand census since 1851. One of the many complications in interpreting religious affiliation data in New Zealand is the large proportion who object to answering the question, roughly 173,000 in 2013. Most reporting of percentages is based on the total number of responses, rather than the total population.
